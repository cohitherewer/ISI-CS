 Yuvraj available for 2nd Test

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Nagpur: Yuvraj Singh is fit and available for selection for the second Test against England starting in Mohali on Thursday. 

The BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah, who watched the Day IV action of the first Test at the VCA Stadium here on Saturday, said the Punjab batsman had sent his fitness certificate to the BCCI. 

The left-hander missed the ongoing Test owing to a hamstring strain, which he suffered during the final ODI versus Pakistan in Karachi last month. 

I have got a report on Yuvrajs fitness and he looked to have recovered and fit, Shah said. 

Report of the Team India physiotherapist would also be taken into consideration before the selection committee decides on the squad for the second Test, he added. The squad will be of 15 players, he said. 

Meanwhile, Shah pointed out that the Champions Trophy venues will be finalised in a fortnight. 

As of now, we have selected CCI, Mohali and Calcutta. Well arrive at a concrete decision regarding this within 10-15 days, he said.

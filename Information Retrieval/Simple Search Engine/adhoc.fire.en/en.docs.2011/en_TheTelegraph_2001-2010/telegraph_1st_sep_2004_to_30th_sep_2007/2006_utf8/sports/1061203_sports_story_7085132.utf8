 Team India hoping for win at lucky venue

 - Visitors look to Laxman for a change in fortunes

Centurion: VVS Laxmans return to the one-day fold and their first win on the tour from a Twenty20 game are expected to lift the sagging morale of the Indians who would get a last chance to redeem some pride in the ODI series in the fifth and final match here Sunday. 

Having already conceded the five-match rubber 0-3 to the hosts, the Indians would be desperate to escape the ignominy of a complete whitewash and finish on a positive note ahead of the start of the three-Test series. 

The tourists, struggling to last the full quota of overs and unable to reach 200 in the one-day series, are looking to build on the Twenty20 game victory at the Wanderers Friday when they beat South Africa by six wickets. 

The biggest stumbling block in their quest for a win has been the form of openers Sachin Tendulkar, Virender Sehwag and Wasim Jaffer. The trio together has produced only 66 runs from seven innings between them. 

Tendulkar (38 from three games), Sehwag (18 from two) and Jaffer (10 from two) have proved little b etter than sitting ducks against the pace and bounce of the South African quicks. 

That the rivals in Graeme Smith (1 from 3 games) and Loots Bosman (28) have probably fared worse is little consolation as the Indians dont have a back-up to offset the disadvantage of early overs. 

The tourists are hoping that the return of Laxman would surely brighten up the picture even though the stylish right-hander would straightaway be thrust into the heat of battle. 

There is also hope in the improving form of Dinesh Mongia and Dinesh Karthik who showed the stomach to fight at the Wanderers and should start as automatic choices in the playing XI. 

Indeed, India have only happy memories from the venue where they have twice beaten South Africa in one-day Internationals and also led that memorable assault against Pakistan in the 2003 World Cup. 

Munaf Patel continues to be on the bench with a sore left ankle and Ajit Agarkar most certainly has bowled his last ball of the tour after having picked a groin injury. Patel, according to stand-in captain Virender Sehwag, continues to feel pain in his ankle. But he is expected to be fit in time for the Tests.

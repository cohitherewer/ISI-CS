The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Indian hockey campaign starts today vs Malaysia

 - Queen opens Games in a blaze of colour 

 Melbourne: The 18th Commonwealth Games opened in a blaze of colour and royal pageantry at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Wednesday. 

In keeping with tradition, Queen Elizabeth II officially declared the Games open after receiving the baton from the final relay runner, Victorian state governor John Landy, the second man to run a mile in less than four minutes. 

Tonight we celebrate the value of sport as a means of bringing together people of 71 nations and territories, and from a wide range of cultures, traditions and beliefs, Queen Elizabeth said. 

It gives me the greatest pleasure to declare the 18th Commonwealth Games open. 

About 80,000 spectators had crammed into the grand stadium for a two-and-a-half hour, multi-million-dollar production that ushered the Games into Australias second largest city. 

Meanwhile, chased by a string of poor performances in the past one year, the Indian mens hockey team would be looking forward to start their campaign on a positive note as they take on Asian rivals Malaysia at the State Netball Hockey Centre here on Thursday. 

The new-look Indian team should not be low on confidence after beating Pakistan on their home turf. 

The Indian shooters run up to the Games continued to grow stronger with Abhinav Bindra and Samresh Jung winning gold medals in their respective events on the last day of the badge matches on Tuesday. 

Bindra won the 50-metre three position event with the score of 1154 while compatriot Gagan Narang totalled 1150 to claim the silver. 

Jung fired a round of 580 to grab gold, while Jaspal Rana settled for bronze with a score of 577 in the centre fire pistol event. 

It was learnt that B. Prameelavalli was withdrawn from the weightlifting team even before leaving India following a report from dope control centre in New Delhi.

 Venus makes a successful return

Luxembourg: Venus Williams made a successful return after almost three months out through injury as she upset sixth seed Ana Ivanovic 6-3, 6-4 in the first round of the Luxembourg Championship on Wednesday. 

The former world No. 1, playing her first match since Wimbledon, held off a second-set fightback from Ivanovic, the world No. 15, to clinch victory in 71 minutes. 

I only started practising two weeks ago, so Im very happy with the way I played, Williams said. 

Having not played since Wimbledon due to a wrist injury, Williams made a slow start, dropping serve in the opening game. 

But the American, whose ranking has fallen to 54, broke back for 2-2 and broke again in the eighth game before serving out the first set.

 Dementieva, Jankovic to clash for title

 Maria Sharapova after her loss on Saturday 

Carson: The prospect of a dream Los Angeles Open final between top seed Maria Sharapova and two-time champion Serena Williams evaporated on Saturday when both players were upset in the semi-finals. 

A fatigued Sharapova, chasing a second successive WTA Tour title, went down 5-7, 2-6 to fellow-Russian Elena Dementieva, while Serena, playing her third event of the year because of a knee injury, lost 4-6, 3-6 to Serbian Jelena Jankovic. 

The 21-year-old Jankovic, who beat Serena when the pair met for the second time in Dubai last year, clinched the opening set by breaking her opponent in the 10th game before the American was warned for racket abuse. 

Refusing to be intimidated Serenas power, the Serb returned superbly, was rock-solid at the net and controlled most of the rallies from the baseline. 

Although severely tested by Serena on her own serve, Jankovic broke the American again in the fourth game of the second set to pave the way for victory. 

The former world No. 1 made a series of uncharacteristic unforced errors and was never able to get back into the match. The Serb held serve out to love to book her place in Sundays final. 

I was surprised with what I got back, but I knew that was what I had to do against Serena because she hits the ball so hard, 16th-seeded Jankovic said.

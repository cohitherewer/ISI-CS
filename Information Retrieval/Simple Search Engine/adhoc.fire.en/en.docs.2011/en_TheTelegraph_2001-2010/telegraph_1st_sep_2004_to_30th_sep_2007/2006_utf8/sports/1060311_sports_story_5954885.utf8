 Atherton tips for Chopra

 Chopra 

Chandigarh: Opener Akash Chopra grew up idolising Michael Atherton, but could only meet him on Thursday ? that, too, when the elements forced a premature end to the opening days play of the second Test in neighbouring Mohali. 

Chopra, who hasnt been picked for India after October 2004, spoke to the former England captain for around half-an-hour. It was wonderful and that interaction lifted my confidence, he told The Telegraph on Friday. 

Among other things, Atherton talked about mental toughness and the need for Chopra (28) to back himself. Set small goals, not targets, is one of the things he said to somebody whod been communicating with him through e-mail. 

Chopra is recovering from a shoulder injury sustained while turning out for Delhi last month and intends returning to the North Staffordshire-South Cheshire Leagues Hemheath Cricket Club in the summer. 

Perhaps, there will be more opportunities for a one-on-one with his idol.

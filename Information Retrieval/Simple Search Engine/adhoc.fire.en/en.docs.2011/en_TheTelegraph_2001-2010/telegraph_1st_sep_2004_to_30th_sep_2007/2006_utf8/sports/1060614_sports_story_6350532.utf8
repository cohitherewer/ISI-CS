 I must be aggressive on grass: Nadal

 - I need to change a lot of things 

London: Rafael Nadal loves the clay. Getting used to the grass is another matter. 

 Fresh off winning his second straight French Open title, Nadal is in London for his first appearance in the Queens Club grass-court tournament, a key tune-up for Wimbledon. 

 With only three wins in six career matches on grass, Nadal has to adjust his game to the faster surface but doesnt know exactly how to get it. 

I need to change a lot of things, the 20-year-old Spaniard said on Tuesday. But I dont know (what). Maybe now is not the best moment to speak about that because I just arrived yesterday. I need to change a lot of my game, and my mentality too. 

 I wanted to practice a little bit because I want to feel the grass, he said. But I feel a little bit dizzy on court. The legs (were) very tired. 

 So today we are going to see what I need to change. I need to play more aggressive. I need to serve with more decision. I need to serve like the important moments on clay.

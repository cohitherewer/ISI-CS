 Fisichella grabs pole

Sepang: Renaults Giancarlo Fisichella took pole position with a flying late lap in qualifying for the Malaysian Grand Prix on Saturday. 

The Italian grabbed the third pole of his career in a time of one minute 33.840, knocking Hondas Jenson Button off the top spot as the seconds ticked away at the end of the session. 

I was confident I would be in the front two rows, said Fisichella. But then in the qualifying session the car was just fantastic. 

Renault team boss Flavio Briatore thought it was poetic justice after Bahrain, where Fisichella was forced to retire with an engine problem he had identified in qualifying. 

It was a fantastic performance by Fisico, great, said the Italian, whose other driver world champion Fernando Alonso was eighth fastest but lines up seventh. 

After the drama of last weekend, Im happy for him. He deserves it and was quick all weekend and has done a very good job. 

Button, still chasing his first win after 101 starts, was delighted to be on the front row after struggling with the set-up in Friday practice. 

The Briton lapped in 1:33.986 just ahead of Williams rookie Nico Rosberg, who continued the impressive start to his Formula One career with the third fastest lap. 

Seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher was next quickest for Ferrari but has replaced his engine and loses 10 places on the grid as a result. 

Australian Mark Webber will therefore line up alongside Rosberg in an all-Williams second row with the McLarens of Juan Pablo Montoya and Kimi Raikkonen behind. (REUTERS)

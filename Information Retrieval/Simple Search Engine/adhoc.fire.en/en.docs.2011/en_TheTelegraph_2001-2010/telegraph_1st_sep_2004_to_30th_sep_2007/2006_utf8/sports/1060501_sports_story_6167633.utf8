The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 WI reach 242/9 in second ODI

 Series vs Zimbabwe

 St Johns: Pacer Tawanda 

 Mupariwa grabbed three wickets, including Brian Laras, 

 to help Zimbabwe restrict West Indies to a modest total 

 in the second one-day International on Sunday.

 The West Indies won the toss, 

 chose to bat and totalled 242 for nine in their allotted 

 50 overs.

 Mupariwa took three for 46 from 

 10 overs after a promising West Indian start.

 West Indies captain Brian Lara 

 took guard in the 38th over and faced just nine balls before 

 he fell to a catch at square-leg after making only five.

 Lara, back as captain for a third 

 tenure, hit an unbeaten 40 on Saturday to guide West Indies 

 to a five-wicket win in the first match. 

 He had got good support from Chris 

 Gayle, who scored 35 and Denesh Ramadin, who struck 37.

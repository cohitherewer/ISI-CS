 Inzys wake-up call to Asian teams

Karachi: Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq on Monday said teams from Asia will have to raise their preparation and training levels if they are to match their rivals in next years World Cup in the West Indies. 

The Pakistan skipper was speaking in the wake of the early exits of India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka from the ongoing Champions Trophy despite starting the ten-team competition as favourites. 

The other teams have shown in the Champions Trophy they are better prepared than us and more focussed. We now have to do the same because not seeing any Asian team qualify in India is very disappointing, he said. 

Inzamam also felt that the fielding standards of the Pakistan team had let them down. 

But I have not given up hope in my players. I know what they are capable of. We will sit down and start afresh for the home series against the West Indies, he said. (PTI)

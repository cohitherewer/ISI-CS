 Speculation on Vaughan

Melbourne: Ian Botham has refused to disclose anything regarding Michael Vaughans surprise arrival in Brisbane just days before the first Test. Vaughan, who is battling an injury, was to fly to Perth to join the academy squad. 

Botham flew in with Vaughan but surprisingly did not want to buy into the speculation. He, however, said Vaughans arrival would lift the teams morale. (PTI)

Calcutta: Winning is a habit and unfortunately, so is losing. This can easily be applied to the current bunch of East Bengal players. Once the mighty winners, they have now made peace with losing as an ingrained custom. 

There is little surprise that from Durand Cup to IFA Shield the saga of their misadventure continues. Every defeat is followed by loads of promises and every promise is followed by attempts to hide the truth. And the truth is, this East Bengal side lacks team spirit the holy quality of modern football that differentiates a winner from the loser. 

Going into their final IFA Shield group match in a must-win situation, East Bengal settled for a 1-1 draw with Mahindra United at the Salt Lake Stadium on Monday and inscribed their untimely exit from another national tournament. 

The verdict helped the Mumbai outfit advance to the semi-finals where they will take on Chinas Shenzen FC on Wednesday. Mohun Bagan and Sporting Clube de Goa will cross swords with each other in the first semi-final on the same day. 

Yusif Yakubu put Mahindra ahead in the 24th minute. East Bengal upped their tempo thereafter and Alvito DCunha duly converted a penalty in the 56th minute when Mahindra defender Samson Fernandes handled the ball inside the box. 

East Bengal should have pocketed the match handsomely but their forwards missed too many clear chances. Ashim Biswas, who replaced Thiago when the match was just 12-minute old, couldve returned a hero, but from a one-to-one position with rival goalkeeper Sandip Nandy, he missed the target in a shocking manner on as many as four occasions. 

Bad patch is a temporary ailment, but if proper treatment is not applied, it becomes chronic. The Ashims are part of the teams winless streak East Bengal havent won a single match since triumphing their CFL Premier Division title-clinching match against local outfit Eastern Railway. What is worrying is that there is very little effort from the players end to mend it. 

Brazilian coach Carlos Roberto Pereiras role also assumes significance here. With two strikers Ashim and Dipankar Roy being short in stature, adopting the strategy of sending long, high balls towards the Mahindra defence (manned by relatively taller players) defied any logic. Brazil are known for passing football, but such a concept seems alien to East Bengal who had fielded three Brazilians in the starting line-up. Of the foreigners, Thiago left the scene with an injury in the 12th minute, Daniel was painful to say the least and only debutant Christiano showed some sense and sensibility as a player. 

Pereira lamented missed chances after the match, saying the players were scoring in practice matches but those efforts were not reflected in the real battles. 

The great Muhammad Ali once said that champions arent made in the gyms Champions are made from something they have deep inside them a desire, a dream, a vision. 

The Alvito-led East Bengal cant be called the dreamer, let alone visionary. They have simply forgotten how to win. Unless a strong message is sent to these players, the Federation Cup their next challenge will remain elusive once again.

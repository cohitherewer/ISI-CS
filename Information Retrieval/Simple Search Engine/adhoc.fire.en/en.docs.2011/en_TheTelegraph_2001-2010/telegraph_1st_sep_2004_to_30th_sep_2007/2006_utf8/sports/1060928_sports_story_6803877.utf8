 Shamshad, Shukla take UP to 269/7

 - Raina leads home side after Kaif is declared unfit 

 Chawla made 48 

Dharamsala: Rizwan Shamshad and Ravi Kant Shukla eked out fine half-centuries under pressure to give Ranji Trophy champions Uttar Pradesh a respectable score against Pakistans domestic champions Sialkot in the inaugural Mohammed Nissar Trophy match here on Wednesday. 

Left-hander Ravi Kants 54 and veteran Rizwan Shamshads unbeaten 60 helped Uttar Pradesh close the day on 269 for seven in the first innings despite a shaky start after electing to bat at the HPCA Stadium. Wicketkeeper-batsman Mohammed Amir Khan on 23 was giving company to Shamshad at stumps on Day I. 

Ravi Kant, who was at his best hitting six fours and a six, also stitched a 55-run partnership with Jyoti Yadav (15) for the fifth wicket to help the home side cross the 100-run mark. As the senior most member of the team I had to take responsibility. The job is half done, Shamshad said after the days play. 

Piyush Chawla, fresh from the successful tour of Pakistan with the India under-19 squad, also made a courageous 48 to lead Uttar Pradeshs early recovery after they were reduced to 94 for four by Sialkot, the Qaid-e-Azam title winners. 

Chawla, who struck five hits to the fence and two over it, added valuable 79 runs with Shamshad for the seventh wicket before falling to Tahir Mughal in the first over after tea. Shamshad carried forward the good work along with Amir Khan in a vital eighth wicket partnership. 

Uttar Pradesh had a torrid time while facing the incisive seamers from Sialkot after stand-in skipper Suresh Raina elected to bat on a wicket that had a tinge of grass on it. Raina was leading the side after Mohammed Kaif was declared unfit to play due to exhaustion. 

But Rainas decision backfired for the home team as they lost wickets in regular intervals. Banking on the early morning moisture and the green top wicket, international Mohammed Asif troubled the UP batsmen with his accuracy and swing as he tasted success in sixth over by trapping left-handed opener Shiva Kant Shukla before the stumps. 

The UP team was trying to deal with the early blow when Asif struck again by sending back Raina at the team total of 23. The UP skipper was lured to play a slightly short of length ball which was leaving him and the left-hander gave a simple catch to Shoaib Malik at the first slip.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 High-fives for magical Monty

 - THIRD TEST 

 - Aussies restricted to 244 

 Monty Panesar in Perth on Thursday 

Perth: Monty Panesar captured five wickets on his Ashes debut to help England bowl out Australia for 244, but the tourists party was spoiled somewhat as they limped to 51 for two on the opening day of the third Test on Thursday. 

The left-arm spinner claimed the scalps of Justin Langer, Andrew Symonds, Adam Gilchrist, Shane Warne and Brett Lee to finish with figures of five for 92 and become the first English spinner to take five Test wickets in an innings at the WACA. 

Strike bowler Steve Harmison also rediscovered his form to take four for 48, including the prize wickets of Ricky Ponting and Michael Clarke, as England bowlers enjoyed their best day of the series. 

England batting, however, which collapsed in the Adelaide Test to concede a 0-2 lead in the series, looked shaky once again. 

Opener Alastair Cook continued his poor run when he departed for 15 and Ian Bell went for a second-ball duck, leaving Andrew Strauss (24 batting) and Paul Collingwood (10 batting) to battle through to stumps. 

Cook was caught by Langer at fourth slip off Glenn McGrath and Bell edged express paceman Brett Lee to wicketkeeper Gilchrist with the two wickets falling in the space of six deliveries. 

Collingwood, who made a double-century in the last Test, had a lucky escape on four when Warne dropped a regulation slip catch off the bowling of Stuart Clark. 

The only Australian batsmen to make a significant score was left-hander Mike Hussey, who finished unbeaten on 74 after chalking up his fourth successive half-century of the series. 

Hussey made 86 in Australias 277-run victory in Brisbane and 91 and 61 not out in Adelaide. Another fine innings in Perth gave him 312 runs for the series at an average of 156. 

Panesar was controversially overlooked for the first two Tests but was finally given his chance when the English selectors dropped the ineffective Ashley Giles. They also replaced seamer James Anderson with Sajid Mahmood. 

Panesars omission from the first two Tests appeared even more baffling when he claimed a wicket with his seventh delivery, bowling Langer with the last ball before lunch.

Calcutta: Arjuna Awardee Soma Biswas is contemplating retirement after the Doha Asian Games in December. 

Well, every good thing has to end? I am targeting Doha to bring the curtains down on my career, said Soma at the Salt Lake Stadium on Friday. 

Asked what prompted such a thought, Soma refused to divulge the reason, but did say that neither age nor lack of funds was a factor. Let it (the reason) be a secret now, I will reveal it only after retiring, remarked the 28-year-old. 

Whether the heart ruled in arriving at this decision, and not the head, will be clear if Soma manages to repeat her Busan performance in Doha. The 28-year-old girl from Ranaghat won a gold (4x400 relay) and a silver (heptathlon) at the 2002 Asian Games. 

Clinching a gold in Doha is top of Somas priority list. And if she does manage to do that, she could well get the energy and enthusiasm to carry on for another year or so. 

Asked what she planned to do after quitting, Soma said: I want to do a diploma in coaching and then see how things go. 

At the moment, though, Somas focus is firmly on the World Combined Events Challenge to be held in Desenzano de Garda (Italy) on May 12-13. It will be tough , but I am targeting 5600 points, said Soma. 

Sushmita Singha Roy, who will also be taking part in the Italy meet, has set herself a similar target. 

Dr Kuntal Roy, the duos coach, is optimistic that his wards will put up a good show in Desenzano de Garda, where only the top-20 of the world can participate. There are some minor injury problems, but Roy doesnt think that will hamper the two girls. 

Both of them have a hamstring problem. These are a part and parcel of every athletes life, I dont think it will make hamper their performance, the coach remarked. 

Keeping the importance of the Asian Games in mind, Roy has fixed up a foreign coach to help out the girls in javelin. South African Tresco will train both Soma and Sushmita in javelin. We are planning to bring him to India within two months for a two-week training stint, revealed Roy.

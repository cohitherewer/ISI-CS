 India fail to make elite tier

Bremen: Indias hopes of qualifying for the mens championship division were dashed when England put it across the Commonwealth Games champions 3-2 in the pre-quarter finals at the World Table Tennis Championship here. 

Indian paddlers fine form deserted them in the crucial tie as they failed to counter the spirited challenge by the young English players, specially Darius Knight who defied his low ranking to beat the Indian top two ? Achanta Sharath Kamal and Soumyadeep Roy. 

Roy tamely lost to Knight, ranked 259 spots behind him, 11-6, 7-11, 11-4, 13-11 in the decider to seal Indias fate. 

However, it was Commonwealth Games gold medallist Sharath Kamals loss to Knight in the second match that hurt India the most. 

Meanwhile, Hong Kong have the unenviable task of trying to halt the Chinese womens table tennis juggernaut when the two sides clash in the final of the team championship.

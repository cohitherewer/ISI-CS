 Lara, Sachin, Sunny are exceptional, says Sourav

Chandigarh: Former Indian captain Sourav Ganguly said on Wednesday that Brian Lara and Sachin Tendulkar were gifted with exceptional abilities and formed a trinity of legends alongwith Sunil Gavaskar. 

However, Sourav said these three players were unique in their own way and could not be compared. He is blessed with great ability, the 34-year-old said about Lara when asked him to comment on his feat of scoring 34th Test century in the second Test against Pakistan in Multan. Both Lara and Sachin together with Gavaskar are the three legends of the game, he said. 

Asked if Lara could go way beyond Sachin who has 35 centuries to his credit, he said, you cannot predict anything on this. 

Sourav said his comeback was not in his hands. 

Its not in my hands. The only thing I can do is to play good cricket. I have had a good run in domestic cricket ever since I have been left out of the (national) team of which I have been a part of for 11 years at a stretch, he said. 

Sourav declined to comment on any question pertaining to coach Greg Chappell or his relations with former BCCI president Jagmohan Dalmiya. (PTI)

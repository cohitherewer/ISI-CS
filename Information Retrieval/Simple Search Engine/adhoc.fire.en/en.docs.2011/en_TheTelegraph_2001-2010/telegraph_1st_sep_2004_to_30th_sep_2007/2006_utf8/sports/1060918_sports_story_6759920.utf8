 Pressure more on India: Lara 

 West Indies captain Brian Lara had quite a few things 

 to say at the Royal Selangor Club on Sunday afternoon. Do 

 read on: 

 Having lost one match and having been lucky 

 to get two points yesterday, the Indians are under more 

 pressure... Weve come to play good cricket and not 

 sneak into the final... Were very short of where we 

 want to be, but will get there... To beat the Australians, 

 one has to be physically, mentally and tactically stronger... 

 One must play positive cricket... The Australian team is 

 all about attitude, but Im sure there are loopholes 

 and we intend taking advantage... Glenn McGrath is a great 

 bowler and I would have said the same thing three or five 

 years ago... However, we cant afford to lose the battle 

 even before it has started... We lost the first match (by 

 78 runs) because we didnt think enough about our game... 

 We cant panic and sanity has to be maintained... Indeed, 

 its not about who we play, but what we ourselves do... 

 Do I read the Riot Act in the dressing room? Sometimes, 

 youve got to put your foot down...At other times... 

 Youve got to remember I have a young team and our 

 target is the 2007 World Cup...

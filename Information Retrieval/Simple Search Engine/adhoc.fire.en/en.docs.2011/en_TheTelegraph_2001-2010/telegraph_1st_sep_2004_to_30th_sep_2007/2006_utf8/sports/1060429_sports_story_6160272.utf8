 Narang finishes 16th

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: Ace shooter Gagan Narang, who has already booked an Olympic berth in China recently, proved to be a total disappointment in the 10m air rifle category in the shooting World Cup in Resende, Brazil on Thursday. 

According to National Rifle Association of India sources, Gagan could shot only 593 and finished 16th. In Guangzhou (China) last month, Gagan shot 597 that fetched him the gold. He, however, will compete in the 50m 3-position rifle event. 

The only Indian who could so far come anywhere near the medal mark was Tejaswni Sawant in the womens 10m air rifle event. 

The Commonwealth Games double gold medallist came up with an impressive score of 499.7 (396+103.7), but her effort was 0.2 points shorter than Polands Sylwia Bogacka, who won the bronze with a score of 499.9. 

In the qualification, Tejaswani shot a series of 98, 99, 100, 99. Teammate Avneet Kaur finished sixth with a final tally of 498.5 points. 

In the same event, Soudaminee Gavankar, who is the national champion in 10m air rifle, earned the 35th place with a score of 389. 

Anjali Bhagwat shot 397 in the Minimum Qualification Score (MQS) section, which was the highest among the five Indians in the fray.

 World record by Isinbayeva 

Donetsk (Ukraine): Olympic and world pole vault champion Yelena Isinbayeva opened her competitive year with a 19th world record in the eastern Ukrainian city of Donetsk on Sunday. 

Isinbayeva raised her own world indoor record by a centimetre to 4.91m at the annual meeting organised by Ukrainian mens pole vaulter Sergei Bubka. 

The 23-year-old Russian, who is determined to overhaul Bubkas world record tally of 35 set indoor and outdoors, broke the five metres barrier in London last July. 

In the following month she vaulted 5.01m at the Helsinki World Championships.

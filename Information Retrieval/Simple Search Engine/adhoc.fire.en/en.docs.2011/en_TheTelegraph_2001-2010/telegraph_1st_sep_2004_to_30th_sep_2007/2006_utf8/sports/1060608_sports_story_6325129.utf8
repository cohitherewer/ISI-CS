The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Kalmadi denies row with sports minister

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Commonwealth Games

 New Delhi: The Indian Olympic 

 Association (IOA) president, Suresh Kalmadi, on Wednesday 

 chose to play down the ongoing tussle between him and Mani 

 Shankar Aiyar over the organisation of 2010 Commonwealth 

 Games, saying the sports minister was not unhappy over the 

 way things were moving now.

 While there is every indication 

 of a conflict between Kalmadi and Aiyar over who would have 

 effective control on about Rs 5,000 crore budget for the 

 Commonwealth Games, Kalmadi said the organising committee 

 would only handle Rs 900 crore, as allocated.

 Speaking during a function organised 

 by the Commonwealth Games Federation, Kalmadi, who is also 

 the chairman of the organisation committee, said: Our 

 budget is Rs 900 crore, as approved by the cabinet.

 It wont be raised 

 any further and we may be able to return the entire amount 

 to the government at the end of the Games.

 The much-hyped Rs 5000 crore 

 has been sanctioned by the government to different agencies 

 such as the Sports Authority of India, Delhi Development 

 Authority and even the Delhi University for building infrastructure 

 and improvement, the IOA chief said, adding, we 

 have got nothing to do with it.

 On why he skipped the meeting 

 of the high-powered apex committee formed by the sports 

 ministry, Kalmadi said he was in Pune.

 It is wrong to say that 

 the sports minister is unhappy over things. At the moment 

 there is total coordination between various committees.

 He, however, did mention that 

 the Commonwealth Games has been awarded to the IOA. 

 Its an IOA event and 

 we will make it a success.

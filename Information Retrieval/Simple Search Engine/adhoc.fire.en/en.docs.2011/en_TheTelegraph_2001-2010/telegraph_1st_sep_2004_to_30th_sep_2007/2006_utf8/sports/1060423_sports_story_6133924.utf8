Imola: Ferraris Michael Schumacher captured the 66th pole position of his career at the San Marino Grand Prix on Saturday to take a Formula One record from the late Ayrton Senna. 

Briton Jenson Button, driving a Honda, joined the German on the front row while Renaults world champion and title front-runner Fernando Alonso could qualify only fifth. Rubens Barrichello, third fastest for Honda, and Schumachers teammate Felipe Massa filled an all-Brazilian second row. 

Already winner of more races and titles than any other Formula One driver, Schumacher overtook triple champion Senna as the sports most successful qualifier at the same circuit where the Brazilian died in 1994. 

Sennas last pole was the day before that fateful race in Imola, won by Schumacher in a Benetton ? the first of his six victories at the circuit named after Ferrari founder Enzo and son Dino. 

The record is less important in a way, you look at it once you finish your racing and you may think about it, but not now said the seven-time champion. 

But being here as an ambassador of San Marino, and getting a pole position for our supporters after all the pain they have had to go through in the last weeks obviously makes me very glad and very excited. 

Schumacher had equalled Sennas pole record at the season-opening race in Bahrain but has not won a race since June last year ? and that was the six-car US Grand Prix fiasco in Indianapolis. 

Both he and Massa crashed out of the last Australian Grand Prix after repeated engine problems in Malaysia. 

What had looked throughout practice as being a Renault-Ferrari battle, with Alonso and Schumacher set to repeat their epic nose-to-tail duel won by the Spaniard last year, suddenly looked more like a Ferrari-Honda face-off.

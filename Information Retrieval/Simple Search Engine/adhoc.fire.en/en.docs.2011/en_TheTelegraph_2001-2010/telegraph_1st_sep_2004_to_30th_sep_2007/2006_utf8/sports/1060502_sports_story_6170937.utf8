 Its all about pressure: Merk

Frankfurt: It is easy to imagine a teenager such as Argentinas Lionel Messi or Spains Cesc Fabregas taking the World Cup by storm, perhaps scoring the winner in the final. 

But a teenager refereeing the biggest match on the soccer calendar? Unthinkable. 

There will not be a single referee under the age of 30 at the 2006 World Cup next month, and the vast majority will be well into their 40s. 

The reasons are all too clear when you see pictures of players angrily remonstrating with referees, while fans scream abuse and pundits pore over TV pictures looking for the most marginal errors. 

Its all about pressure, says Markus Merk, a 44-year-old German referee. And the ability to deal with that pressure comes from experience. 

When you referee your first match its not going to be a high-profile one with 20,000 people there. But you need spirit as well. (Reuters)

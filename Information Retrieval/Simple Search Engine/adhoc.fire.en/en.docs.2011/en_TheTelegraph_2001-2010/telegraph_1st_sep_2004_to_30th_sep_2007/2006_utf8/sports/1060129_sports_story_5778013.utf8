 BCCI, ICC set to resolve differences 

New Delhi: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and International Cricket Council (ICC) on Saturday put up a friendly posturing, saying there was will on both sides to resolve the problems surrounding the venues for the Champions Trophy to be held later this year. 

BCCI president Sharad Pawar and ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed, who met here at the formers ministerial office, said that both sides had a much better understanding of each others issues. 

The BCCI finds itself in a tricky situation with regard to signing the host nation agreement with the ICC since two of the three venues ? Mumbai and Delhi ? have their own agreements with various corporates. 

Speed said that one of the issues arising out of the existing contract it had with Global Cricket Corporation, who hold the rights for all ICC events till 2007, is that we require clean cricket venues. 

The grounds must be free of any ad signs so that we can maximise the revenue for our sponsors, the ICC chief said. 

We had similar problems in 2002 (Champions Trophy) in Sri Lanka and the 2003 World Cup (in South Africa) as well. 

If we cannot resolve the issues, we look at a different venue. That is why last time in England (in 2004 Champions Trophy) there were no matches at Lords. We had it at The Oval, Speed said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Venues of semis, final not decided

 2011 World Cup

 Karachi: Pakistan Cricket 

 Board (PCB) on staked its claim to host the 2011 World Cup 

 final, saying the formula adopted during 1996 edition should 

 be applied when the Asian subcontinent holds the extravaganza 

 again.

 PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan said 

 the venues for the semi-finals and final of 2011 World Cup 

 were yet to decided and the hosts would have to thrash out 

 the issue before the International Cricket Council (ICC) 

 executive board meets in July.

 Well soon discuss 

 this matter with the other co-host countries although, in 

 principle, its decided the final will be staged in 

 Pakistan and semi-finals in India. The PCB would like the 

 formula of 1996 edition to be applied again, Shaharyar 

 was quoted as saying in a daily on Wednesday.

 [Confirming this, BCCI secretary 

 Niranjan Shah said that nothing has been decided regarding 

 venues of the semi-finals and final. Its true 

 that we are thinking along the lines of the 1996 formula, 

 but we are yet to reach a decision, he said. 

 Asked whether a decision will 

 be made before the ICC meeting in July, Shah maintained, 

 we have just got the Cup, theres enough time 

 left for us to discuss it, first among ourselves and then 

 with the host nations.]

 Earlier it was reported that India 

 would host the inaugural ceremony as well as the two semi-finals 

 while the final will be held in Pakistan, most likely at 

 the Gaddafi in Lahore.

 In 1996, India hosted two quarter 

 finals and the semi-finals while Pakistan organised two 

 quarter finals and the final in Lahore.

 Sri Lanka are set to host nine 

 games of the 2011 World Cup and Bangladesh six with India 

 organising 22 and Pakistan sixteen.

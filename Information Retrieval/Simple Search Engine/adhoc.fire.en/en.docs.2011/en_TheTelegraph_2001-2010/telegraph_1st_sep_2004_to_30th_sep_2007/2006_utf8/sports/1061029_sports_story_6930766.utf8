 Jeev tied ninth

Valderrama (Spain): Indias highest ranked golfer, Jeev Milkha Singh moved into tied ninth spot at the Volvo Masters with a round of 71 that gave him a total of even par 142 at the midway stage of the elite European event. 

Lying 19th overnight, Jeev had two birdies on the front nine, but lost the advantage with two bogeys on the back nine. 

Jeev had birdies on the first and eighth but dropped shots on 12th and 13th. He was let down by indifferent putting. 

In Miami, Arjun Atwal will have to go back to the Qualifying School for his full playing privileges after crashing out at the midway stage of the Chrysler Championship. 

Atwal, who had a roller coaster of a round with one eagle, three double bogeys, four bogeys and four birdies, carded a four-over 75 and missed the cut by a long margin. 

Currently ranked 137th on the money list, he is nevertheless eligible for limited exemptions and will get about 16 starts just as he got in 2005. (PTI)

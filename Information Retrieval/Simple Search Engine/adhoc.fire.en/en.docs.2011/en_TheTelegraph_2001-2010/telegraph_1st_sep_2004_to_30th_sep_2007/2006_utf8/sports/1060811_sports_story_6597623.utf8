 IAAF probe against Gatlin coach

 Justin Gatlin

Raleigh: The International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) said on Thursday it was investigating Justin Gatlins coach Trevor Graham for possible doping violations. 

Olympic and world 100m champion Gatlin faces a life ban after testing positive for testosterone. 

In a statement, the IAAF said an investigation was being conducted in conjunction with the US Anti-Doping Agency (USADA). 

If evidence exists, either from the ongoing Balco investigation or otherwise, that Graham has engaged in doping practices in breach of IAAF rules, disciplinary proceedings will be initiated against him through USADA, the statement said. 

The US Olympic Committee (USOC) has banned Graham from using its facilities because of the unusual number of athletes he has coached who have been convicted of doping offences. 

At least six athletes coached or previously coached by Graham, including disgraced former 100m world record holder Tim Montgomery, have been suspended for doping. 

Montgomery was banned for two years for using banned substances provided by the Balco laboratory in California. 

The group does not include Gatlin, who announced last week he had failed a test for testosterone or its precursors. 

An American daily reported last month that Graham was under investigation by the same federal grand jury which is investigating San Francisco Giants slugger Barry Bonds. 

Grahams attorney issued a statement on Tuesday asking the USOC to lift its ban. It also said Graham had passed a polygraph test in which he denied distributing illicit substances. 

Meanwhile, Gatlins attorney said on Wednesday she expected a doping review panel to consider his positive test this week. 

Sometime this week but I am not sure exactly when, Cameron Myler said via telephone from her New York office.

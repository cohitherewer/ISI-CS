 Bobby Robson to undergo surgery

London: Former England manager Bobby Robson said he would undergo surgery on Wednesday to remove a brain tumour. 

The 73-year-old, who now acts as the assistant to Ireland coach Steve Staunton, was taken to hospital while watching an Ipswich game two weeks ago. He said doctors had spotted the tumour early and were confident he would make a full recovery. 

I had a scan to assess why I felt unwell and had to leave the game at Ipswich early, and the doctors discovered a small, operable tumour that caused an affliction on the left side of my face, Robson told a local newspaper on Sunday. 

On Wednesday, I will have an operation to remove the tumour and, as surgeons tell me the rest of my body is clean, I should be able to make a full recovery. (AP)

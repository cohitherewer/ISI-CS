The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Melbourne: Lleyton Hewitt was recalled to Australia?s Davis Cup team on Monday to play Belarus in next week?s quarter finals.

 Hewitt missed the first-round win over Switzerland through injury but will replace Peter Luczak in the four-man squad.

 He will be joined by towering left-hander Chris Guccione and doubles specialists Wayne Arthurs and Paul Hanley for the April 7-9 tie at Kooyong in Melbourne.

 Belarus have yet to name their squad but are expected to be led by Max Mirnyi and Vladimir Voltchkov. 

 London: Ralf Schumacher expects another tough weekend for Toyota in Australia as Formula One?s big spenders fight to get up to speed after a poor start to the season.

 ?Heating up the tyres has been a problem for us, so Australia will show us how far we?ve come,? said the German driver in a preview for Sunday?s third round of the championship in Melbourne. ?A difficult weekend awaits but I hope we can continue to push hard and use the data that we have collected so far this year to help pushing up the grid.?

 Both Schumacher, who scored Toyota?s first point of the season with eighth place in Malaysia eight days ago, and Italian teammate Jarno Trulli returned to Europe last week to try and improve the car in testing.

 Washington: The world?s second-ranking woman golfer, Michelle Wie, recently played with Condoleezza Rice and said the US Secretary of State uses her driver ?really well,? it was reported on Monday.

 ?I can?t believe I played nine holes with her,? the 16-year-old golfing sensation told the magazine.

 She said that she had been in charge of driving rice around in a golf cart.

 ?I was like, ?if I crash, the secretary of state goes down with me,? Wie was quoted as saying. ?She was kind of a beginner, but she was pretty athletic. She actually hit her driver really well. She liked hitting her driver.?

 Milan: Inter Milan?s Portuguese winger Luis Figo is doubtful for Wednesday?s Champions League quarter final, first leg against Spain?s Villarreal.

 Figo was unable to train with the team last week due to a muscle problem and he missed Inter?s 0-1 defeat at Parma on Saturday.

 On Sunday, he managed only a light individual training session and his involvement in Wednesday?s game is in doubt.

 Inter coach Roberto Mancini could ask Serbian midfielder Dejan Stankovic to fill in on the right wing or push Argentine captain Javier Zanetti into a more advanced role.

 Madrid: Real Madrid have said there is no deal in place with a new coach, going back on president Fernando Martin?s assertions a week ago that he had chosen a successor to Juan Ramon Lopez Caro.

 In an official statement, the club said: ?Contrary to what has been reported in the Spanish and European media the club has made no decision on who will be the club?s coach next season. The club has no agreement or contract with any coach.?

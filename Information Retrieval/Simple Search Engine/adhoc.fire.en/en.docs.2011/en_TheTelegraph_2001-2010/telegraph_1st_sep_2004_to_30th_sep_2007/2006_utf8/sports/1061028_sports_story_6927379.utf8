The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Post-Doha, 

 India could try out another foreign coach 

 Stickwork

 Indian 

 hockey is at a very critical juncture. After the disappointing 

 show in the World Cup, another big challenge looms large. 

 A little over a month from now, we will be in Doha for the 

 Asian Games. Unlike the showpiece event in Germany last 

 month, realistically speaking, our priorities in Doha are 

 well-defined: we need to reach the final since this is the 

 minimum requirement for a direct entry to the Beijing Olympics. 

 An achievement to this effect can somewhat redeem our image, 

 after the recent string of failures. On the flip side also 

 lies the apprehension that the disaster in the form of 

 failing to qualify for the Olympic Games may just strike 

 us. 

 Pakistan are also in a similar 

 situation. Five of their players who did duty in Germany 

 for the World Cup failed to make the Asian Games squad. 

 True we have still reposed faith in our old guards, but 

 any mishap in Doha will surely show them the exit door. 

 I was in Rourkella to prune down 

 the squad from 26 to 22. The present captain Dilip Tirkey, 

 Kamalpreet Singh and Gagan Ajit Singh were not present in 

 the camp because they were playing in the European leagues. 

 Its surprising that at a time when the national camp 

 is going on, some of our key players have their priorities 

 elsewhere. If such is the case, India can certainly do without 

 their services. 

 Perhaps its now also time 

 to shed our reservations over the role of a foreigner to 

 help lift the game out of the existing rut. The jury is 

 yet to be out with their verdict, but Baskarans fate 

 clearly rests with the Asian Games performance. However 

 we fare there, post-Doha we can think of appointing a foreigner, 

 at least as a consultant coach if not the full-fledged one. 

 Our experience with the German Rach was not a happy one 

 and taking a leaf from that incident, the next foreign coach 

 must be a good teacher of modern hockey, one whose technique 

 and expertise have been well-received internationally. 

 Hockey is still synonymous with 

 the Indian sporting culture, even though cricket has captured 

 our attention as the No. 1 game. Because of our emotional 

 ties with hockey, we are prone to pass off our failures 

 as a mere bad phase. However this is nothing but escapism 

 for everything points to a weird system which is in place 

 here in the name of developing and promoting the game. 

 Soon after the Asian Games, the 

 next edition of PHL will hit the calendar in February. But 

 sadly, the National Games will also be going on at that 

 time in Guwahati. This clash of two meets is a real pity 

 and should have been avoided. In Europe, no meet is allowed 

 to come in the way of the national leagues. Its also 

 bizarre to note that the Asian Games camp is coinciding 

 with the national championship. 

 All this calls for having a better 

 system in place. We must have a long calendar and planning 

 of sub-junior, junior and national meets must be done at 

 least two years in advance. These are simple things to be 

 done, but sadly, procrastination is the name of the game 

 in our system.

 Monty a good student: Bedi

Mohali: Former India captain and left-arm spinner Bishan Singh Bedi on Saturday praised Monty Panesar, the first Sikh ever to play for England. 

Monty is a good student of the game and a very good learner, he said. 

On whether he found any grey areas in Panesars bowling, the former India captain said the 23-year-old spinner has to find that out himself. 

Asked if there was a result possible in this Test, he said though lot of time had been lost to the bad weather, but still it cant be said for certain. 

If Indians bat well and give a decent lead to the opposition, who knows English batsmen may find themselves on the backfoot in the last innings, he said.

 Mumbai matinee poised on razors edge

Mumbai: An England win, a hard-fought draw and a shock Indian victory all appear possible as the hosts, chasing 313 to win, reached a shaky 18 for one on the fourth day of the third and final Test on Tuesday. 

Andrew Flintoffs gritty half-century helped England reach 191 in their second innings after the Indian spin duo of Anil Kumble (four for 49) and Harbhajan Singh (two for 40) kept the touring side on the back foot on a responsive pitch. 

Makeshift opener Irfan Pathan played on to paceman James Anderson early in Indias reply. Andersons four-wicket haul in the first innings helped England gain a 121-run lead. 

India are 1-0 up in the series for the TVS Cup after winning the second Test in Mohali by nine wickets. 

Pathan was promoted to open because Virender Sehwag suffered a back spasm. The regular opener, who did not field for most of the day, can bat only after the fall of the fifth wicket. 

India were thus deprived of an initial thrust should they fancy their chances of reaching 313, way beyond the highest run chase of 166 by South Africa six years ago on this ground. 

Captain Flintoff, who had two reprieves early on, struck six boundaries and a six in his 146-ball effort. He was ninth out, stumped by Mahendra Singh Dhoni while giving leg-spinner Kumble the charge. 

The 28-year-old allrounder, who struck a fifty in each of his three previous innings, put on 66 for the sixth wicket with Paul Collingwood (32) to rescue England from 85 for five. 

After tea the Indian spinners managed to stall England, who had laid the platform for an assault after grinding through the first two sessions. 

Off-spinner Harbhajan Singh, under pressure to perform, dismissed Collingwood and Geraint Jones (3). He deceived Collingwood in the air and had him caught and bowled with a fine one-handed catch diving to his left. 

Jones skied a pull to be caught by Pathan. Kumble took the wickets of Kevin Pietersen (7), Flintoff, Matthew Hoggard (6) and James Anderson (6). 

England, resuming at 31 for two, progressed at two an over in the first two sessions. 

Kumble came up with a remarkable caught and bowled to dismiss flamboyant Kevin Pietersen after nightwatchman Shaun Udal fell to left-arm paceman Irfan Pathan for a plucky 14. 

Debutant Owais Shah (38) went in the first over after lunch. Shah, who made 88 in the first innings, was run out by Sachin Tendulkar at the wicketkeepers end after Collingwood played Kumble to short third man. 

Flintoff used his massive reach and presented the full face of the bat to counter the spinners. 

The Indians dropped no less than 10 catches in England second innings, five of them on Tuesday. 

England captain was let off on zero when Kumble got a delivery to jump and turn and Yuvraj Singh at silly point failed to latch on. 

Fourteen runs later, the Lancashire allrounder charged down the pitch to off-spinner Harbhajan and missed the line but wicketkeeper Mahendra Singh Dhoni failed to grasp the chance.

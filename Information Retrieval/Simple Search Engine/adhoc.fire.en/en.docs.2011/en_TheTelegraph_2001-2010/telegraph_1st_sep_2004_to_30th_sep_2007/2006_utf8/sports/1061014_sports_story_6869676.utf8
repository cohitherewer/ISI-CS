 Kramnik is worlds best 

Elista (Russia): Russias Vladimir Kramnik won a match against Bulgarias Veselin Topalov in a tiebreaker on Friday, becoming the first universally recognised World Chess Champion since 1993. 

Kramnik won the tension-filled match by a score of 8.5-7.5 in a final day of quick, time-limited games. 

Each of the 41-year-old players was to receive $500,000 for taking part in the match, which was arranged to heal a 13-year-old schism in the chess world dating back to world champion Garri Kasparovs withdrawal from the World Chess Federation. 

Kramnik secured his victory in the fourth game today, which Kramnik won with white. Fridays score was 2.5-1.5.

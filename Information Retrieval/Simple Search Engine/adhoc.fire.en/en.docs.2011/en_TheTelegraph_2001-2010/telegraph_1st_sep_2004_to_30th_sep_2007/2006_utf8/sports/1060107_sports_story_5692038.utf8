 It will be tough to chalk out a gameplan against India

India coach Greg Chappell has made it difficult for his Pakistani counterpart, Bob Woolmer, to chalk out gameplans against his team because every Indian batsman today is capable of batting at any number. It would be interesting to see how Woolmer counters that ploy during the India-Pakistan series. 

The other point that would be interesting to see is if Chappell and Rahul Dravid are brave enough to throw their batting order surprises against Pakistan. It can become very tricky and can also backfire. 

As I see things, it becomes extremely difficult for any captain to see Mahendra Singh Dhoni coming out with Virender Sehwag to open the innings instead of a more conventional pair of Sehwag and Gautam Gambir with Irfan Pathan following at one-down instead of Dravid. So you first need to assess and visualise what the opponent is capable of and how he can surprise. And then be prepared with plans. 

Woolmer might be under pressure because it is a home series but Chappell will have a mountain on his shoulders because of the Sourav Ganguly factor. Ganguly is the only captain to win a series in Pakistan. Now Gangulys presence in the dressing room can be destructive if he is not given the respect that he deserves. 

Naturally, every player should be selected on present day form. Thus it will be even more interesting to watch how the team management handles the situation if it decides to settle for Wasim Jaffer or Yuvraj Singh over Ganguly. 

Chappells role again becomes important. But trust me, this Ganguly factor is extremely sensitive and crucial! 

The role of the coaches is to organise quality training camps discuss problems with the players, chalk out match plans, and leave the rest to the captain. 

Unfortunately, legends of the past, in their capacities as coaches, get involved in team selection and then make it an issue if over-ruled by the captain. Both parties need to increase their tolerance level. To achieve the desired results in every series, this is the key. 

It would be unfair if I lay all responsibilities on Chappell and exempt Dravid of his charges. But Dravid, too, has his problems. He is coming as captain to Pakistan where expectations are sky high. 

Dravid will be the backbone of the batting as Sachin Tendulkar has missed most of last year with a tennis elbow and Laxman is still searching for his maiden big innings against Pakistan. 

As for Pakistan, Inzamam-ul Haq is leading the team well but Shoaib Akhtar is the man to watch. This series, weather permitting, will be thrilling and though I believe Pakistan is the best bet, I will not predict in this game of glorious uncertainties.

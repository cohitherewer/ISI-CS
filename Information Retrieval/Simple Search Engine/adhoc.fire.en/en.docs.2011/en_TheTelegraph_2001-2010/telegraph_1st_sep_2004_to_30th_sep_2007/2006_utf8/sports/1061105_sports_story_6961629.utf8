 Flintoff expects best ever series

London: England captain Andrew Flintoff believes his sides upcoming defence of the Ashes in Australia could be the biggest series ever in cricket history. 

Flintoff, speaking just before the teams departure, said: It is going to be tough. We know that 2005 was something special and whether that can be recreated I am not quite sure, said the Lancashire pace bowler and hard-hitting batsman. It could be the biggest series ever, so there is an excited group of lads. 

Australia, revitalised by a fine run since the last Ashes series, are expected to provide a sterner challenge on home soil.

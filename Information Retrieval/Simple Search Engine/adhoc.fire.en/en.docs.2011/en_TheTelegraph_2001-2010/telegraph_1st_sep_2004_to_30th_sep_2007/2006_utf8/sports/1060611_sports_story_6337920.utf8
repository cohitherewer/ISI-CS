 Going off target ?

Frankfurt: Mexican referee Marco Rodriguez was presented with an unusual problem during Englands opener against Paraguay when the ball struck the giant video cube suspended inside the Waldstadion. 

The 30-tonne cube, a distinctive feature of the 43,000 capacity arena, received a direct hit from a huge clearance by England goalkeeper Paul Robinson. 

The players looked bemused and the game was briefly stopped as Rodriguez awarded a drop ball inside the centre circle. (Reuters)

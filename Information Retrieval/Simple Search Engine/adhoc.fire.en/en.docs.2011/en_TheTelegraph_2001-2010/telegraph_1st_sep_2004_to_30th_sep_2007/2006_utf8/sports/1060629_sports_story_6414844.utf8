 Messi: Like to play with the crowd against me

Herzogenaurach: Argentinas teenage forward Lionel Messi thrives on tough away matches in front of a hostile crowd. I like to play with the crowd against me, Messi said as he contemplated Argentinas World Cup quarter final against host nation Germany in Berlin on Friday. 

Its a quarter final and from here theyre all difficult matches and this one against Germany a bit more because, apart from the football they play, theyre at home and, like it or not, that also helps. 

Messi pulled a thigh muscle in the home leg against Chelsea and only recovered in time for the World Cup. He has come off the bench in Argentinas last three matches and scored his maiden World Cup goal in the 6-0 win over Serbia amp; Montenegro. 

 Messis features look down 

 from huge Adidas posters around Germany in which he was 

 tipped to be one of the dominant players but he said he 

 does not think about becoming the worlds No. 1 player.

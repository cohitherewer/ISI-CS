 Harbhajan apologises

OUR CORRESPONDENT 

Chandigarh: In yet another instance of religious interference in sports, the Shiromani Gurudwara Prabandhak Committee (SGPC), a body entrusted with the upkeep of historical Sikh shrines and matters concerning the community, on Saturday said off-spinner Harbhajan Singh could be summoned to the Akal Takht to explain his appearance in a liquor companys advertisement with his hair untied. It also said that Harbhajan could be penalised. 

The Akal Takht is the primary seat of Sikh religious authority and central altar for Sikh political assembly. 

Harbhajan has apologised to the SGPC following protests by Sikhs in Amritsar and Jalandhar against the advertisement. 

We would also like the liquor company to apologise to the nation for using Harbhajan to tarnishing the image of the Sikhs. It depends on Akal Takht head priest Joginder Singh Vedanti to decide whether Harbhajan should be punished or not, SGPC chief Avtar Singh Makkar told The Telegraph. 

Vedanti was not available for comment. 

The Sikh code of conduct prohibits the community from drinking liquor, consuming tobacco, trimming the hair or beard and keeping the head uncovered.

 Ray: Dont blame Dalmiya

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: Former chief minister Siddhartha Shankar Ray has brushed aside any suggestion that Jagmohan Dalmiya was responsible for Sourav Gangulys ouster from the national side. 

Ive had personal experience of working with Dalmiya and I feel hes in no way responsible for this. Why is this question coming up? First, the current BCCI dispensation ruined Souravs career, ignoring him on non-cricketing grounds, and they are now out to ruin Dalmiya, Ray, who acted as Dalmiyas counsel on a number of occasions, said on Saturday. 

He also expressed dislike towards political interference in the running of a sporting organisation. Ive had a lot of differences with Jyoti Basu, but I totally agree with him that a police commissioner has a lot of other work to do than running the CAB, he said.

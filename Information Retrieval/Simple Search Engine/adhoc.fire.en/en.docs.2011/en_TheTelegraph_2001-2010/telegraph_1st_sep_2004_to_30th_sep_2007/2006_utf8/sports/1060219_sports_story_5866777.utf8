 India rally to hold Hong Kong 2-2 

 Bhaichung Bhutia scored the second goal 

Hong Kong: Down by two goals within 17 minutes, India made a splendid recovery to hold hosts Hong Kong 2-2 in an international friendly on Saturday. The hosts went into early lead but India bounced back after the break through strikes from Syed Rahim Nabi and skipper Bhaichung Bhutia to draw level. 

Hong Kong drew the first blood when the Africa-born Gerard Ambassa Guy scored a splendid goal in the third minute. The buoyed home side struck again in the 17th minute. Law Chun Bong made the most of a cross from the right to extend the lead. 

After the twin setback, India tried hard to bounce back but a strong crowd of 3,672 egged on their players to deny the visitors any ground at the Hong Kong Stadium. 

India dished out a much better display in the second half. Striker Syed Rahim Nabi started Indias recovery with a fine goal in the 61st minute. After Mahesh Gawli and Bhaichung played the ball on the left, the Indian skipper left it for Nabi to cut in and slam home. 

Six minutes later Bhutia converted a spot-kick to restore parity after he was fouled by the goalkeeper. 

India will leave for Japan on Sunday. On February 22, India play Japan in the Asian Cup match.

 Ponting, Aussies chart leaders

Dubai: Australia captain Ricky Pontings twin centuries in his 100th match have reinforced his position as the worlds top Test batsman in the LG ICC rankings. 

And as if that was not reason enough for him to celebrate, the 2-0 series win over South Africa by Pontings side has reinforced their position as the top Test team in the updated ranking. 

Pontings scores of 120 and 143 not out in Australias eight-wicket win against the Proteas in Sydney has lifted him through the 900-point threshold in the rankings, something only ever achieved by the most outstanding cricketers of all time. 

To put that into context, only Matthew Hayden among current Test batsmen has achieved a higher rating than Pontings new mark of 922 points. The big left-hander reached 935 points in 2002 after twin hundreds against England in Brisbane. 

Australias series win has lifted their lead at the top of the LG ICC Test Championship table to a healthy 14 points. 

They started the season with a lead of just eight points over England but five wins and a draw in six matches against the West Indies and South Africa, together with Englands 0-2 series loss in Pakistan have dispelled fears they may have had of being overtaken. 

Australias nearest challengers are now India after their recent series win against Sri Lanka. 

Pontings scores, his 27th and 28th Test hundreds (with the first of them helping to ease him past 8000 Test runs), were needed to retain his lead in the rankings because Jacques Kallis scores of 111 and 50 not out lifted the South African back up three places to second. 

Kallis, the ICCs Test Player of the Year, started the series in top spot in the batting list but, after missing the Perth Test through injury, twin failures in Melbourne dropped him to fifth place. 

Hayden slips down three spots to fifth, despite 90 in Australias successful run-chase on Friday, while there are contrasting fortunes for other batsmen on both sides in the wake of the Sydney Test. 

Indias Rahul Dravid, Virender Sehwag and Sachin Tendulkar occupy the sixth, seventh and ninth spots, respectively. 

In the bowling department, Glenn McGrath has regained top spot from Shane Warne, who slipped to third position, also behind Sri Lankas Muttiah Muralidharan. 

Brett Lee (21st, up two places) and Stuart MacGill (unchanged in 22nd place) are both still just outside the top 20 positions. 

For South Africa with the ball, Shaun Pollock has dropped out of the top 10 among the bowlers for the first time since 1998. The former captain now lies in 11th position. 

Kallis retains his position as the worlds leading allrounder and Pollock remains in third with the two South Africans sandwiching Englands Andrew Flintoff.

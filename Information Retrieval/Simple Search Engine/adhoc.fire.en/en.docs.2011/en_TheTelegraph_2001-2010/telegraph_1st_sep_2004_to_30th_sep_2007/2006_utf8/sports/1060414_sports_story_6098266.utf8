 Dravid praises Sehwag, Dhoni 

Indore: Rahul Dravid Thursday said Virender Sehwag and Mahendra Singh Dhoni were not one-day wonders and must be given credit the way they have handled their fame and success. 

Players like Sehwag or Dhoni were not made in one day. It has taken years of hard work which they put in to reach wherever they are today, and that should be highlighted, Dravid said at a felicitation ceremony. 

They must have had so many heartaches and disappointments (on the way). It is not easy for everyone to survive that. (PTI)

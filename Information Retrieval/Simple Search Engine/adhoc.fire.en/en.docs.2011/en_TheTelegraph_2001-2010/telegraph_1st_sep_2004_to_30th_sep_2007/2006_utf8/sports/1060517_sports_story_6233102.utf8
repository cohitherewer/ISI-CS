 Sven makes no change

London: England coach Sven-Goran Eriksson made no changes to the provisional squad he named last week. 

The list of 23 players still includes 17-year-old Arsenal striker Theo Walcott, who joined the England squad on Monday as the team left for a training camp in Portugal. 

 The teams shirt numbers were also announced, 

 with Eriksson handing No. 7 to Wayne Rooney. His standby 

 list of Scott Carson, Luke Young, Nigel Reo-Coker, Jermain 

 Defoe and Andrew Johnson remains the same.

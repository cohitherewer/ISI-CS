 Sourav must believe in his abilities: Wessels

Potchefstroom: Sourav Ganguly has been asked to back himself against South African quicks by his coach though in this case it is not Greg Chappell. 

Kepler Wessels, coach of the Indian left-hander at Northamptonshire, has some well-meaning advice for his county protege, the foremost among them being the value of self-belief. Sourav must be prepared for some really, really hard go at him by the South African fast bowlers and it is his ability to hold his ground which would count the most, he said. 

The former South Africa captain feels that a batsman can easily lose his bearing when confronted with incisive fast bowling and in these dire moments, only unshakeable belief will hold him in good stead. 

Wessels wants Sourav to practice as hard as he can in the nine days before the start of the first Test. When he came to England for the grind of county cricket, he took some time to get used to the conditions. He didnt adjust immediately so it could again be an issue with him in South Africa. The earlier he gets used to it the better. 

Wessels said the former Indian captain would be making a mistake if he goes to the crease with a pre-meditated plan. That would be a huge mistake. Sourav would have to decide on his feet in the middle. He cant go with a set mindset that he would pull or hook short-pitched delivery. He would have to make instant decisions and be really decisive in his foot movement.

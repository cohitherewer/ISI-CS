 QUICKSCAN: Group G

 France

 Founded: 1919 

 Affiliated: 1804 

 Les Bleus intend to lay ghosts 

 of 2002 to rest 

 On July 12, 1998, Les Bleus ignited 

 France with a fire that burned on for days when they ripped 

 Brazil apart in a sensational 3-0 World Cup final victory 

 on home soil. A million euphoric Frenchmen and women sung 

 and danced all night long on the famous Champs Elysees in 

 Paris. The celebrations went on for days. The superbly talented 

 Zinedine Zidane crowned a glittering tournament performance 

 with two goals against the South Americans in the final. 

 France, founder members of Fifa, have competed in 11 World 

 Cup finals, but the 1998 achievement eclipses all else. 

 Dazzling performances from players like Zidane, Youri Djorkaeff 

 and Fabien Barthez enraptured the footballing world. Under 

 coach Aime Jacquet, the home team were simply unbeatable. 

 Sixty years earlier in 1938, France 

 had hosted another World Cup. On that occasion, the host 

 team was less fortunate, going out in the quarter final 

 to eventual champions Italy. Twenty years later, in Sweden 

 in 1958, Just Fontaine set a finals record with 13 goals 

 ? a record that remains unbroken to this day. In the years 

 that followed, France produced many great talents. In the 

 1980s, players like Michel Platini, Alain Giresse and Jean 

 Tigana thrilled lovers of the game with their agility and 

 flair. 

 But despite possessing one of 

 the best midfields ever assembled, France fell twice to 

 Germany in consecutive semi-finals, first in a dramatic 

 thriller in Spain in 1982 and then in Mexico in 1986. In 

 Seville, France led 3-1 in extra time before Germany fought 

 back to win on penalties. 

Two years after winning the 1998 

 World Cup, France continued their sensational run by triumphing 

 in the 2000 European Championships. They defeated Italy 

 2-1 in the final with an extra-time golden goal by David 

 Trezeguet in a heart-stopping final in Rotterdam. 

 France duly travelled to the 2002 

 finals in the Far East as both world and European champions 

 but in the ensuing debacle, Les Bleus failed to score 

 a single goal and finished bottom of their first-round group 

 before returning home. Two years later at Euro 2004, it 

 was pretty much a case of the same problems and same punishment. 

 Beaten in the quarter finals by Greece, the French were 

 now forced to admit that their golden period was over. This 

 year they will be looking to put the ghosts of 2002 to rest.

 Put in charge of a France team 

 in the throes of transition, coach Raymond Domenech embarked 

 on the qualifying campaign for Germany in an unenviable 

 position. The situation was further exacerbated by the mass 

 retirement from international duty of players such as Bixente 

 Lizarazu, Claude Makelele, Lilian Thuram and Zidane. Savaged 

 in the media after drab displays in a Group IV generally 

 assumed to be theirs for the taking (with Switzerland, Israel, 

 Republic of Ireland, Cyprus and the Faroe Islands), Domenech 

 steadfastly continued to lead Les Bleus down his 

 chosen road.

 South Koreans look to maintain 

 the miracle 

 With the 2002 World Cup now a 

 fond memory, South Korea face a tall order in trying to 

 emulate the achievement of reaching the semi-finals on home 

 soil when they travel to Germany for their sixth successive 

 finals appearance. Some unconvincing displays in qualifying 

 ? where they lost two and drew three of their 12 matches 

 ? should at least provide a note of caution for their highly 

 expectant fans. 

 The South Koreans suffered an 

 early embarrassment on the road to Germany when they were 

 held to a goalless draw in the Maldives in the second match 

 of the preliminary group stage. That result cost Portuguese 

 coach Humberto Coelho his job, and led to the appointment 

 of Dutchman Jo Bonfrere who guided the team through to Asian 

 last eight with no further slip-ups. 

 However, come the final qualifying 

 round last year, South Korean confidence took several more 

 dents, including a 0-2 loss to Saudi Arabia. Although they 

 then defeated Uzbekistan 2-1 in Seoul, it took an injury-time 

 equaliser from debutant Park Chu-Young to rescue a point 

 in the return match in Tashkent on June 3 last year. A 4-0 

 drubbing of Kuwait five days later secured their place at 

 Germany, but after a 0-1 home loss to Saudi Arabia in their 

 final qualifier in August, Bonfrere later resigned amid 

 criticism of the teams lacklustre performances, paving 

 the way for the entrance of Dick Advocaat.South Korea are 

 Asias most frequent visitors to the World Cup finals, 

 and first appeared at the global showpiece in 1954. Prior 

 to 2002, however, they had not managed a single win in 14 

 finals matches. That all changed under Dutch coach Guus 

 Hiddink who led them to the last four, a stunning run that 

 ended only with a 0-1 loss to Germany in the semi-finals. 

 Although there have been changes 

 to the South Korean side since, the heroes of 2002 all retain 

 key roles. Park Ji-Sung, now at Manchester United, provides 

 a genuine attacking threat from midfield, while left-back 

 Lee Young-Pyo is a key figure in a defence that operates 

 in front of experienced goalkeeper Lee Woon-Jae. There are 

 plenty of options up front, with Ahn Jung-Hwan, whose golden 

 goal defeated Italy. Coach Dick Advocaat ? the third Dutchman 

 at the helm of South Korea? could field three forwards given 

 the players available and will also no doubt consider the 

 merits of youngster Park Chu-Young, who showed his predatory 

 instincts by scoring twice in his three qualifying appearances. 

 Whatever Advocaats selection, this former Netherlands 

 trainer knows that matching the feats of his compatriot 

 Hiddink is not going to be easy.

 Swiss relish German adventure 

 After failing to qualify for France 

 in 1998 and Korea-Japan in 2002, Switzerland made amends 

 for missing out on the previous two World Cup finals by 

 claiming a place at the 2006 edition. The away-goal rule 

 was the decisive factor in their success, as Kobi Kuhns 

 side edged through by a wafer-thin margin in a heart-stopping 

 play-off against Turkey. 

 Despite falling 2-4 in their second 

 leg in Istanbul, they advanced by virtue of their 2-0 victory 

 in Bern. The tournament in Germany will be the first World 

 Cup appearance since 1994 for the Swiss who are due to host 

 the 2008 Uefa European Championship jointly with Austria. 

 Switzerland made it to the round of sixteen on their last 

 finals appearance at US in 1994, but fell 0-3 against Spain 

 despite the presence of established stars such as Ciriaco 

 Sforza and Stephane Chapuisat. The current youthful and 

 ambitious crop will be hoping to achieve at least as much 

 in their countrys eighth finals outing in Germany, 

 and some observers believe they have the potential to emerge 

 as the surprise package of the tournament. .

 Before the play-off second-leg 

 defeat by Turkey, the Swiss had gone a full year and 14 

 straight games without defeat, evidence of the growing strength 

 of a team that includes players who attracted rave reviews 

 at various under-age levels. Their line-up in the play-offs 

 featured Tranquillo Barnetta and Philippe Senderos, both 

 of whom claimed Uefa European U-17 Championship honours 

 in 2002. 

 Kuhns men remained undefeated 

 throughout their qualifying campaign in European Group IV, 

 amassing 18 points from ten fixtures. The highlights of 

 a solid campaign included two draws against France and an 

 identical result against Ireland, although in the tightest 

 of all the European sections, the Swiss were left sweating 

 right to the end before edging out Israel for second place. 

 The team marshalled by skipper 

 Johann Vogel features a healthy blend of youth and experience. 

 Veteran keeper Pascal Zuberbuhler barks out commands at 

 the back, while Hamburg midfielder Raphael Wicky stamps 

 his authority on the midfield. Philippe Senderos and Tranquillo 

 Barnetta unquestionably belong in the international game, 

 while Alexander Frei has at times shown a killer instinct 

 in front of goal. Switzerland coach Jakob Kobi 

 Kuhn took the helm in 2001 and has presided over a successful 

 period in the national teams history. Kuhn claimed 

 six Swiss championship winners medals as a midfielder 

 with FC Zurich, where he spent his entire playing career 

 save for a two-month flirtation with local rivals Grasshoppers. 

 He earned 63 international caps and enjoyed a productive 

 stint as U-21 national coach before stepping up to the senior 

 job.

 World Cup debut

 Togo defy the odds 

 If Togo were unlikely contenders 

 for a first World Cup finals place at the outset of their 

 campaign, then their first three qualifiers did little to 

 alter that impression. The Hawks started off in late 2003 

 with a 0-1 defeat to lowly Equatorial Guinea and although 

 they won the return leg in Lome 2-0 to reach the group stage 

 of the qualifiers, there was little expected of them. An 

 opening Group I defeat to Zambia appeared to set the tone 

 for a struggle, but 15 days later everything changed. 

 A 3-1 triumph over group favourites 

 and Senegal proved the catalyst for an impressive unbeaten 

 run by coach Stephen Keshis side. After drawing in 

 Liberia, they secured four straight victories before travelling 

 to Dakar in June where the talismanic Emmanuel Adebayors 

 71st-minute goal secured the 2-2 draw that kept them two 

 points clear at the top, an advantage they retained with 

 subsequent victories over Liberia and Congo. 

 A record of seven wins and just 

 one defeat in ten qualifiers is remarkable for a country 

 who finished their previous three World Cup qualifying campaigns 

 ranked fourth in their group. 

 Togo may have reached the CAF 

 African Cup of Nations finals five times, but this is far 

 and away their greatest footballing achievement. The former 

 Nigerian international Keshi (he captained his country at 

 USA 94) took the Togo job after being dismissed as Nigerias 

 assistant coach after their semi-final exit from the 2002 

 Nations Cup. Initially his sights were set on a top-three 

 finish but, as he says, When we saw Germany in sight, 

 I told my players that this is a once-in-a-lifetime chance. 

 The Nigerian connection does not 

 end there as strikers Adebayor and Oulfade Adekanmi were 

 both born in Nigeria but opted to represent Togo. Adebayor 

 is the undoubted hero of Togolese football ? and has already 

 surpassed the legend status of 1960s hero Frank Fiawoo, 

 who played for Olympique Marseille and Bastia in France. 

 Based with Monaco in Ligue 1, 

 the tall, lanky Adebayor scored 11 goals ? finding the net 

 against all five of Togos Group 1 opponents ? to finish 

 as the top marksman in African qualifying.

 Mumbai restrict Uttar Pradesh to 250 

Mumbai: Mumbai fought their way back into the Ranji Trophy semi-final after restricting Uttar Pradesh to 250 in their first innings on the second day at the Wankhede Stadium on Saturday. 

Mumbai, dismissed for 199 in their first innings, were 21 for no loss in their second outing at close, with openers Sahil Kukreja on 10 and Onkar Khanvilkar on 11. The visitors, who were four for no loss overnight, were bowled out 11 overs before stumps. 

Medium-pacer Avishkar Salvi set the ball rolling with two wickets in the third over of the day. He scalped opener Jyoti Yadav and Praveen Kumar in quick succession while pace partner Usman Malvi trapped Shivakant Shukla two overs later to leave Uttar Pradesh reeling at 13 for three. 

Only a 123-run partnership for the fourth wicket between Uttar Pradesh skipper Mohammad Kaif and 19-year-old left-hander Suresh Raina salvaged the visitors as they took the first innings lead just before tea. In the process, Kaif and Raina raced to their half-centuries. 

As in the first session, the second too was rewarding for the hosts, in which they scalped the crucial wickets of Kaif, Raina and Gyanendra Pandey. 

It included Kulkarnis crucial dismissal of Kaif and his spectacular catch at gully to dismiss the dangerous Pandey. 

The Mumbai skipper latched on to four catches and claimed two wickets to lead from the front. 

As Mumbai threatened to run through the Uttar Pradesh innings, Rizwan Shamshad, who struck a vital 40, and Piyush Chawla were associated in a significant 53-run partnership for the seventh wicket that helped them to a first innings lead of 51 runs.

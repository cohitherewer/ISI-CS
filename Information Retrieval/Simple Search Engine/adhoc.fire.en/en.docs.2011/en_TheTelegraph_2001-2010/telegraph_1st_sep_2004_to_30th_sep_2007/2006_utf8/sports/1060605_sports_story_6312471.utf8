St Johns: Opener Wasim Jaffer restored Indias fortunes in the first Test against the West Indies on Sunday with an unbeaten 60 at tea on the third day. 

At the interval India were 121 for one in their second innings, a deficit of nine, after dismissing the West Indies for 371. 

At 2.30 am, India were 196 for two with Wasim Jaffer on 104 and Rahul Dravid on 14. Thanks to Jaffers second Test century, India were 66 runs ahead. V.V.S. Laxman (31) earlier got out to an indiscrete shot off Dave Mohammed. 

Opener Jaffer, who faced 95 balls and hit eight fours, put on 72 for the first wicket with Virender Sehwag who struck 41 off 58 balls including six boundaries. 

In the morning, Ian Bradshaw and Denesh Ramdin kept the Indian bowlers at bay until the days fifth over, when Munaf Patel had Ramdin caught behind by Mahendra Dhoni for 26 with a classy away swinger. 

Paceman Vikram Singh took his maiden Test wicket by forcing Bradshaw to send a bouncer looping off the shoulder of his bat and into the hands of Yuvraj Singh at point. Number eight batsman Bradshaw had hit six fours in his disciplined 33. 

VRV struck again four overs, later when Fidel Edwards fended another short delivery to Dhoni to be dismissed for four. 

The innings ended three balls later when Kumble trapped Corey Collymore in front with a googly for a first-ball duck. 

The habitually aggressive Sehwag launched the last ball of the third over of Indias second innings, bowled by Edwards, over backward point for six with an audacious slashed cut. 

Sehwag continued in similar vein until an hour after lunch, when he failed to move his feet in trying to drive a delivery from Collymore and edged to Chris Gayle at first slip. Gayle held the catch at the third attempt. 

Edwards left the field with a suspected hamstring injury bowling 5.4 overs. 

West Indies tail wagged long enough to enable the hosts gain a valuable 130-run first innings lead against India on the third morning of the first Test here Sunday. 

The hosts, resuming at 318 for six, batted for 16 more overs and added 53 runs before folding up at 371, half-an-hour before lunch. 

Dwayne Bravo, who struck 68 off 92 balls with 11 fours on Saturday, was a disappointed man. Im very disappointed with the way I got out, the shot was not called for at that point in time, Bravo said. 

Denesh (Ramdin) and myself were the last two recognised batsmen, it was up to us to bat out.

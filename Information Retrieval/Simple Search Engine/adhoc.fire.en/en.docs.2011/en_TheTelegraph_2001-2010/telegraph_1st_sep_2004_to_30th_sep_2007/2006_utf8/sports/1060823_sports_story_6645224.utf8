 Suresh gets 3-match ban 

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: East Bengal defender M. Suresh was handed a three-match ban and fine of Rs 75,000 by the IFA on Tuesday. This means he wouldnt be able to play the Derby against Mohun Bagan on Saturday. 

Suresh was contractually bound by East Bengal, yet he took an advance from Mohammedan Sporting. He eventually withdrew a case from the city civil court and signed for the former. 

Mohammedan Sporting ground secretary Iqbal Ahmed, accused of fanning supporters ire at IFA secretary Subrata Dutta during his visit to the club, was slapped with a three-year ban and barred from entering the technical area of the ground during any match organised by the association. 

The decision was taken at the IFA disciplinary committee meeting, which, however, gave a clean chit to Mohammedan Sporting coach Subhas Bhowmick.

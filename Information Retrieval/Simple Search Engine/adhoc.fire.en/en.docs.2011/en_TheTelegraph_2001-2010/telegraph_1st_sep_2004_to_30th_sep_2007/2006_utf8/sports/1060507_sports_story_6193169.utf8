 Neelotpal in joint 2nd spot

Karwar (Karnataka): Keralas K. Ratnakaran and International Master Neeraj Mishra were in the joint lead with 5.5 points each after the seventh round of the inaugural Ranjit Patkar Memorial Fide Rating Open Chess tournament here. 

GM-elect Neelotpal Das systematically outplayed his statemate Somak Palit in a game arising out of centre counter defence. Neelotpal is in second spot with five points with four others including the tournament sensation Uma Kant Sharma. 

Mishra was aggressive in applying his tactics which proved to be the crucial factor in the final outcome of the result at the event organised by United Karnataka Chess Association and Karwar Chess Club. (PTI)

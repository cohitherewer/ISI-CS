 BCCI contracts before SA tour

Mumbai: The Indian players annual contract with the Board of Control for cricket in India (BCCI) would be finalised and signed before the team departs for South Africa, to play five one-day Internationals and three Test matches next month. 

The contracts would be ready (for signing by the players) before the team leaves for South Africa, said BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah here Monday. 

Asked about the stand-off with the ICC over the BCCIs refusal to sign the Members Participation Agreement, Shah said the reply had already been sent to the world governing body. We have sent it two or three days ago, he said.

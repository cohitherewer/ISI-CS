 Kramnik, Topalov tie in jeopardy

Elista (Russia): A chess world championship 

 match between top ranked Veselin Topalov of Bulgaria and 

 Grandmaster Vladimir Kramnik was thrown into jeopardy here 

 Friday for a bizarre reason the frequent toilet breaks 

 taken by the Russian. 

The breaks gave rise to suspicion that Kramnik was cheating because the toilet is the only area where there is no video surveillance. 

Following the allegation, the resumption of the match, which is a part of a long awaited reunification of the chess world, has been delayed indefinitely. 

To protest against the allegation, Kramnik has stationed himself before his bathroom, saying he will not play until he is allowed access to it. 

In the 12-game match, four games are already over with Kramnik leading 3-1 and needs just 3.5 points more in the remaining eight games to be crowned the new world champion. 

The problem began when Kramnik excessively used the toilet during the games, following which Topalovs manager Silvio Danailov wrote a protest letter to appeals committee of the match demanding that the players use the public toilet and be accompanied by an assistant arbiter. 

Danailov also said the usage of rest rooms should also be banned for both players, lest we would seriously reconsider the participation of Topalov in this match. 

 The appeals committee decided that both the players 

 will have access to one common toilet and rejected other 

 demands, which could not satisfy Danailov. (PTI)

 McGrath fitness test today

Melbourne: Australia pacer Glenn McGrath will demonstrate his fitness in front of selectors in Brisbane on Wednesday after six months away from competitive cricket. 

McGrath last played for Australia in a one-dayer against Sri Lanka in Perth at the end of January before missing the tours of South Africa and Bangladesh to spend time with his wife Jane, who is fighting cancer. 

She gave her blessing in June for him to return to action and the 36-year-old will bowl in front of coach John Buchanan and bowling coach Troy Cooley at Cricket Australias Centre of Excellence to assess when he can return to the Australia set-up. 

It will be a really good opportunity for him just to get outdoors and have a bowl in front of a few of the coaches and get a little bit of assessment of where hes at, Buchanan told Australian Associated Press. 

He says hes been physically doing some good work (with New South Wales), so thats a good sign.

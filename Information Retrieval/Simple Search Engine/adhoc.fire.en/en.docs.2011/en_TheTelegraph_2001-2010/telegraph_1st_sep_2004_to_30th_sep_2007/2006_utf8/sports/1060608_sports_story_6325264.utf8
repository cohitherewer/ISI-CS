St Johns: The West Indies withstood some heart-racing moments and staved off a spirited bowling performance by India to clinch a thrilling draw in the first Test here on Tuesday. 

The hosts owed their great escape to a gritty half-century by No. 9 batsman Dave Mohammed who shepherded the last three wickets through the final 21 overs and saved the hosts from defeat on the fifth and final day at the Antigua Recreation Ground. 

Up against a daunting target of 392, the West Indies were comfortably placed at 171 for three at one stage before a middle order collapse saw four wickets fall for 55 runs in the final session. 

Mohammeds aggressive 52 off 55 balls then kept the Indians at bay and after his fall, Fidel Edwards and Corey Collymore saw off the last three overs to leave their team unconquered on 298 for nine. 

Anil Kumble (4/107) led the attack admirably while Virender Sehwag (2/39) and Sreesanth (2/49) provided vital breakthroughs but the West Indies tail proved to be a hard nut to crack in the end. 

Yet, to be pushing for victory on the last day after being outplayed on the first two itself was a dramatic turnaround in fortunes for the visitors. 

Man of the Match Wasim Jaffers maiden double ton and Brian Laras second innings duck on the very ground where he twice broke the world record batting score were the other highlights of the last international match at the Antigua Recreation Ground. 

Mohammeds last hour heroics put to shade a 99-run partnership between Chris Gayle (69) and Shivnarine Chanderpaul (62) who rescued them from a precarious situation earlier in the day. 

The home team made a smooth start through a 67-run opening stand between Daren Ganga and Gayle before losing three wickets in less than five overs in the first session. 

Kumble gave the first breakthrough when he had Ganga (36) caught brilliantly by Yuvraj Singh at forward short-leg. 

A run later, Ramnaresh Sarwan (1) played a reckless drive against Sreesanth (2/42) to spoon a simple catch to Kumble in the slip cordon. 

Sreesanth then got one straighten up to rap Lara plumb in front for zero. 

Gayle and Chanderpaul then led the middle order recovery adding 99 runs for the fourth wicket before the former fell leg before to Kumble. 

Gayle played an unusually subdued innings but ironically it was his belligerence that brought his downfall ultimately. Having been punished for a huge six in the over before tea by Gayle, Kumble resorted to bowling looping leg breaks in order to force Gayle out of his shell. 

The trick worked. 

After driving to cover fence and playing a lofted six over long off, Gayle thrust his front pad with the bat tucked behind to Kumble. 

Edwards and Collymore added one run to the last wicket but crucially came through the last 19 deliveries unscathed. 

 Sehwag fined 

Virender Sehwag has been fined 20 per cent of his match fee for excessive appealing. 

Sehwag, who took two for 39 in the second innings, pleaded guilty to Match Referee Jeff Crowe during a hearing after the final days play, an ICC release said on Wednesday.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Lanka up to sixth spot

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Test Ranking

 Calcutta: Sri Lanka not 

 only levelled the series versus England with their 134-run 

 win at Trent Bridge on Monday, but also climbed up the rungs 

 in the International Cricket Council (ICC) Test rankings. 

 They are currently placed sixth, a mere four rating points 

 behind fifth-placed South Africa. 

 According to the ICC website, 

 Mahela Jayawardenes team climbed to 97 points to level 

 with New Zealand, but moved above the Black Caps when the 

 figures were re-calculated to three decimal places.

 The failure to win the home series 

 against Sri Lanka means that this has been the third series 

 in a row since their overwhelming Ashes victory which England 

 have failed to win. 

 They thus dropped a point to 112 

 and are just one point ahead of India, who maintained the 

 third spot. Australia continue to remain on top of the leaderboard 

 by a whopping 19 points.

 Rahul Dravids men will now 

 need a string of Test victories in the Caribbean to put 

 more pressure on England and snatch the second spot. 

 THE standings

 1. Australia; 2. England; 3. India; 4. 

 Pakistan; 5. South Africa; 6. Sri Lanka; 7. 

 New Zealand; 8. West Indies; 9. Zimbabwe; 

 10. Bangladesh

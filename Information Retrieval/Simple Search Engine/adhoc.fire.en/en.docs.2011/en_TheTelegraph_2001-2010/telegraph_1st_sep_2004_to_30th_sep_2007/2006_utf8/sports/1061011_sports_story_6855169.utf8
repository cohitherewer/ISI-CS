 Lara best man to be captain, says Lloyd 

Jaipur: Former West Indian captain Clive Lloyd believes Match Referees should have a greater role to play to ensure that The Oval fiasco does not take place again. 

Lloyd also said The Oval controversy could have been averted had common sense prevailed. I think the Match Referee has an important part to play. I dont know what happened at The Oval, but good sense should have prevailed, Lloyd, a former Elite panel Match Referee, said here Tuesday. 

If common sense had prevailed, it might not have happened. The key is (for a Match Referee) to keep in touch with the umpires and try to knock a few things into their head. I believe the Match Referee has a great part to play and an even greater part to play in the future, said Lloyd who officiated in 53 Tests and 130 ODIs after retiring as a player in 1984-85. 

The 62-year-old from Georgetown said Brian Lara had been asked to lead the West Indies because he was the best man for the job. 

Lara knows the game. He is a pretty astute guy. He has done well and he is the guy we need at the moment, Lloyd said. 

Whenever the time comes, he will hand it over to the next guy but for the moment he is the best man for the job, said Lloyd. (PTI)

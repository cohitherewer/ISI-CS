 Chappell defends strategy

Basseterre: Greg Chappell has hit out at criticism that India erred by going into the first two Tests against the West Indies with four bowlers. 

Were not 2-0 up, so there is no point moaning about it. You can be disappointed and all those things but it is not going to help us. We played four bowlers because it was horses-for-courses kind of a situation, Chappell said. 

Everyone is looking at our bowlers and saying we havent done this or we havent done that. What we have done is to win nearly two Test matches. Youve got to look at what the West Indian bowlers have done, he said. (PTI)

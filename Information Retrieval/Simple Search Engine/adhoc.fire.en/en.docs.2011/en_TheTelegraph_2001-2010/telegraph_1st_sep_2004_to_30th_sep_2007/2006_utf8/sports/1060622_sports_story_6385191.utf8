 Wimbledon Seedings

 London: Spains Rafael 

 Nadal was named second seed for the Wimbledon mens 

 singles on Wednesday, ahead of American Andy Roddick.

 Claycourt specialist Nadal has 

 never been beyond the third round of the grasscourt Grand 

 Slam, while Roddick has been runner-up the last two years 

 to Roger Federer.

 Unlike other Grand Slams, Wimbledon 

 organisers use a formula taking into account grasscourt 

 performances over the last two years to determine seedings 

 rather than purely following the rankings.

 Nadal is a clear second in the 

 mens ATP rankings, having just won his second successive 

 French Open. However, he was knocked out in the second round 

 at Wimbledon last year and did not compete in 2004.

 By being seeded second, he cannot 

 meet defending champion Federer, the top seed, until the 

 final. But as third seed, Roddick ? who is ranked five in 

 the ATP list ? could meet Federer in the semi-finals.

 Roddicks compatriot Andre 

 Agassi, the 1992 champion widely expected to be making his 

 final appearance at the Wimbledon, is seeded 26, six places 

 below his ranking. Agassi has not played at Wimbledon since 

 2003.

 The top five womens seeds 

 are the same as in the WTA rankings. Frances Amelie 

 Mauresmo is top seed, followed by Belgians Kim Clijsters 

 and Justine Henin-Hardenne, Russias 2004 champion 

 Maria Sharapova and her compatriot Nadia Petrova.

 Defending champion Venus Williams 

 is seeded seven, five places higher than her WTA ranking. 

 She is the only American seed in the womens singles 

 with compatriots Lindsay Davenport, Serena Williams and 

 Jennifer Capriati all out injured. 

 Switzerlands Martina Hingis, 

 the 1997 champion who is playing her first Wimbledon since 

 2001, is seeded 13, two places above her WTA ranking.

 Chinas Li Na is seeded 28, 

 becoming the first player from her country to be seeded 

 in a Grand Slam singles draw.

 No British player is seeded in 

 the mens singles with Greg Rusedski, Andy Murray and 

 four-time Wimbledon semi-finalist Tim Henman all too far 

 down the rankings.

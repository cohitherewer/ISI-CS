 Jeev tied ninth 

Tokyo: Jeev Milkha Singh carried his good form into the Japan Tour championship, opening with an even par 70 at the Shishido Hills Golf Club. 

The Chandigarh golfer is enjoying a good run of form, having notched up seven top 10 finishes already this year, and his solid start here put him in a tie for the ninth place. 

The other Indian in the field, Amandeep Johl, playing on a special sponsors invite, shot a 2 over 72 to be in a tie for 39th place. Johl birdied the sixth hole but bogeyed the eighth and ninth to turn in one over 36. Coming in, he added another birdie on the 16th, but a double bogey on the 18th meant he finished on a disappointing note. 

Kiyoshi Murota took the lead with a five-under 65, followed closely by Toru Taniguchi and Tommy Nakajima with identical scores of three under 67. 

Jeev started of with an excellent front nine of three under par 32, which included birdies on the sixth, seventh and ninth holes. (PTI)

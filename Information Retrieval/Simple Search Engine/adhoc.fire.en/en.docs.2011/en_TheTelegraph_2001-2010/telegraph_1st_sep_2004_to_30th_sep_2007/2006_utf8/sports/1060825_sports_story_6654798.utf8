 Copenhagen oust Ajax

London: Four-time European champions Ajax were ousted from European Champions League qualifying on Wednesday, scoring an own-goal in their 0-2 loss at home to FC Copenhagen. 

Ajax had a 2-1 lead heading into the second leg of their third-round qualifying match at their Amsterdam Arena, but fell behind when Michael Silberbauer scored in the 59th minute. That tied the aggregate score and Copenhagen went ahead when Ajax defender Thomas Vermaelen put the ball in his own net in the 77th minute. The result sends Copenhagen to the lucrative group stage. 

Arsenal, which lost to FC Barcelona in last seasons final, also advanced to the group stage with a late goal that gave them a 2-1 win over Dinamo Zagreb. (AP)

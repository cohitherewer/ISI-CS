 Pinki faces strong field 

 - NATIONAL OPEN ATHLETICS

New Delhi: All top athletes, barring long jumper Anju Bobby George, are likely to take part in the 46th National Open athletics championships, whose main events are beginning at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium here on Thursday. The five-day meet has all the ingredients of becoming a virtual trial for the forthcoming Doha Asian Games. 

While Anju has pulled out because she doesnt yet consider herself in the best of form, the most interesting event could turn out to be the 400 metres run for women. 

Bengals Pinki Paramanik will be pitted against a strong field that includes Asian champion Manjeet Kaur, Rajvinder Kaur (both Punjab) and Ashik Beevi of Kerala in the womens 400 meters. 

Given Pinkis performance in the current season and her gold winning shows in the 400 and 800 metres in the Asian Grand Prix recently, the Bengal athlete is certainly going to be the star attraction of the meet. 

Despite her not too good show in the World Cup at Athens last month, where she finished seventh in the 800 metres, there are enough reasons to believe that Pinki has the ability to pip Asian record holder Manjeet Kaur to the post. 

Other than Pinki, two other Bengal girls Susmita Singha Roy and Soma Biswas are also like to draw a lot of attention in hepthahlon. While Susmita has already achieved the last Asian Games third place mark with 5872 points show in the Federation Cup here early this year, Soma and JJ Sobha would also try their best to impress the selectors. 

Sobha had recently been to Ukraine for a training stint. 

Interestingly, the AFI has not yet specified the qualification marks for the Asian Games. But under the normal practice and the Ministry of Sports guidelines, the athletes should at least achieve the third place marks of last Asian Games or Asian championship (whichever is better) in their respective events. 

In high jump, Bengals Harishankar Roy is likely to be included in the Asian Games squad. He has recently been performing well and jumped to 2.21 metres in the Asian Grand Prix in Bangalore. But if the guidelines are followed, then Roy must jump to 2.23 to qualify for Doha. 

Though the performances of Indian athletes in recent months have not shown an upward curve, athletes like javelin thrower Jagdish Bishnoi, discus thrower Seema Antil, shot putter Navpreet Kaur and 800 metres runner KM Beenu will be keenly watched this time around. 

All of them, after all, are strong medal contenders for the Doha Asian Games.

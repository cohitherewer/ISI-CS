 SHARP SINGLES

 A chemical is set to be used in Mohali on Wednesday in an 

 attempt to reduce the amount of dew that forms on the outfield 

 during day-night matches, says A Staff Reporter.. APSA-80, 

 used in farming industry, will be sprayed on the outfield 

 ahead of the match between New Zealand and Pakistan, according 

 to an ICC press release. The chemical is not expected to 

 eradicate dew completely, but it is hoped it will reduce 

 it significantly. ICC Manager Cricket Dave Richardson, 

 ICC manager (cricket) said: Dew and the effect it 

 has on day-night cricket has been something that everyone 

 is conscious of. And although it has not played a major 

 role in the ICC Champions Trophy so far we are keen that 

 should remain the case for the rest of the tournament and 

 that every match should be a fair contest between bat and 

 ball.

 Dalmiya: Faith in boys paid off 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The ruling group in the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), of which Inderjit Singh Bindra is very much a part, has made life miserable for Jagmohan Dalmiya the man once at its helm. 

On Saturday, however, Dalmiya (who heads the Cricket Association of Bengal) had something to smile about when the state team defeated Punjab in the Ranji Trophy face-off at the PCA Stadium in Mohali. Bindra heads the Punjab Cricket Association. 

On record, though, Dalmiya refrained from commenting on his relations with Bindra, who was once his closest ally. However, he had a quite a bit to say about Bengals fantastic win. 

When I met them on the eve of their departure to Chandigarh, I just told them that I had faith in them and that paid the dividends at the end, Dalmiya told The Telegraph on Saturday. 

The CAB president, however, didnt hide his frustration at the nature of the pitch, which saw the match getting over within three days. Whats the point in preparing such a pitch? Dalmiya asked. 

Dalmiya, interestingly, found out a connection between Bengals pre-match conditions and Indias bad show during the initial phase of the 2003 World Cup. 

When our chips were down, I, being the head of the BCCI, lent them support and ultimately, they finished runners-up, Dalmiya said, referring to his pre-match pep-talk to Sourav Ganguly amp; Co. 

Dalmiya, though, looked satisfied by winning a low-scoring match. The charm of winning a low-scoring match is something different, he maintained. 

Dalmiya, however, expressed reservations over the proposal to deduct the players match fees in case of a bad performance.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Spain bench failed to grab chances

 On Target

 Shyam Thapa

Spain moved into the last 16 stage as group H winners and with an all-win record. On Friday, they beat Saudi Arabia 1-0, thanks to Juanitos 36th-minute winner ? a great header past the keeper following Jose Antonio Reyes free-kick from the left. 

With the qualification for the next round already assured, Spain coach Luis Aragones had the luxury of tasting his bench. So the line-up was devoid of any regulars with as many as seven players making their World Cup debut. Michel Salgado ? who has represented his country 50 times earlier and even won the Champions League with Real Madrid ? was one of them. 

Every player dreams of playing in the World Cup and when this wish is fulfilled, he just counts his days of making a debut. Instances are not quite few in World Cup history when a player had to spend the entire competition without sweating it out in the middle, even if he belonged to the winning squad. Because the coach always falls back on the key and regular players in winning a tournament. 

So the reserves always takes it as an extra motivation if they are given a chance to play, however little it may turn out to be. Their aim is to impress the coach through some good performance, giving him an alternate solution if the primary plan fails. This is how new stars are born in major tournaments. 

Seen from this perspective, the Spanish coach I feel, was the happiest among his counterparts on Friday in that he could get a chance to test almost all the players in his squad. Very few coaches could chance upon such a situation in a tournament like the World Cup. 

But Im sorry to say that this Spanish bench surprisingly looked like lacking motivation. Here we had all the fresh legs and energies, but all this was hardly reflected in the match. Against hapless Saudi Arabia, Spain never looked like a bunch of players with a point to prove. Perhaps with a mind already set on the knock-out stage, they were relaxed, as if in a honeymoon mood. 

Saudi Arabia also had a point to prove. With an outside chance to qualify, they should have kept Asias prestige in mind. But after seeing Japan, Iran and Saudi play, I must say, not just 15 years ? as Id mentioned earlier ? but maybe 50 years wont be enough to see an Asian team play in the World Cup final. 

Towards the end, Aragones introduced Torres ? who has scored three goals in the previous two matches ? in the attack. The move couldve been something related to giving him a chance to score and pushing his claim as the top-scorer. This is surprising to me since hes a regular forward in the side and any injury to him might have upset the teams plans. 

 For Spain, its a great chance to come out of the shadow of that perennial under-achievers tag. Four years ago, they lost to South Korea on penalties in the quarter finals. Prior to that in Euro 2002, another defeat came again in quarters ? to France. Time has now come for Raul amp; Co. to exorcise the ghost of those past disappointments.

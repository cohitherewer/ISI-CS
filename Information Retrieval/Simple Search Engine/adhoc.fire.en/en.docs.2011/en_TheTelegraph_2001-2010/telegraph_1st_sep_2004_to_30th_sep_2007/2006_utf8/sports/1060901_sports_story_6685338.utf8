 Organisers to face charges 

London: Turkish Grand Prix organisers have been summoned to an extraordinary meeting in Paris to face charges of breaking the Formula One rules with a controversial podium ceremony last weekend. 

The FIA said in a statement on Thursday that the Turkish national sporting authority TOSFED and organisers MSO had been asked to attend a specially-convened FIA meeting on September 19. 

There they will hear charges that they have acted in breach of the FIA statutes, the international sporting code and the 2006 F1 sporting regulations. (Reuters)

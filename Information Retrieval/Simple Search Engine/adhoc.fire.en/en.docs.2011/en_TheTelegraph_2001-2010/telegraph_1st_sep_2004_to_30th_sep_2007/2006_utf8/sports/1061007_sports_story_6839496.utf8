The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Shaharyar made to quit 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Shaharyar Khan

Calcutta: Its not 

 confirmed, but Shaharyar Khans resignation as chairman 

 of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) had everything to do 

 with a message from the countrys President 

 Pervez Musharraf, who is also the bodys chief patron. According to The Telegraphs 

 sources in Pakistan, Musharraf was very upset with Shaharyars 

 handling of The Oval Test fiasco and Younis Khans 

 resignation as stand-in captain. 

Frankly, Shaharyar was asked to put in his papers because of the bad publicity Pakistan had been getting in recent times, one of the sources pointed out late on Friday. 

 President Musharraf had appointed Shaharyar to the 

 top post in December 2003. 

 Agencies add: Meanwhile, 

 PCB director of cricket operations Saleem Altaf said that 

 The new chairman will be announced on Saturday but 

 the indications are it will be Dr Naseem Ashraf. Dr Ashraf is a member of the PCBs ad-hoc committee 

 and is considered to be very close to President Musharraf.

 Senior pro makes a dream come true

Marienfeld: Portugal captain Luis Figo took time out from training for Saturdays quarter final clash against England to make one 10-year-olds dream come true. For Raquel Rodrigues, born with a condition known as cerebral thrombosis which prevents blood from reaching part of her brain, meeting her soccer hero was something to tell all her friends about. 

He was lovely. He asked me lots of questions and I asked him about his children, she said, wearing a Portuguese shirt autographed by all the players and clutching a signed sticker book. He invited me to go horse-riding with him in Madrid. I dont know if I can go, but I would like to. This was my dream, and Figo really was so nice, said Raquel. (Reuters)

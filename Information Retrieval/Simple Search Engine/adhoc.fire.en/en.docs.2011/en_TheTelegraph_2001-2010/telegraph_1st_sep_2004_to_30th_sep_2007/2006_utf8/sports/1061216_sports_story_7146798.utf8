 Jeev up to tied third

Bangkok: Birthday boy Jeev Milkha Singh shot a six-under 66 to rocket up the leaderboard into tied third place after Round Two of the $650,000 Volvo Masters of Asia golf tournament here Friday. 

The fine card saw Jeev, celebrating his 35th birthday, finish the round at six-under 138, two shots behind leader Thongchai Jaidee. 

Jeev, who had a modest 72 in the first round, said he was sharper on the course and putted very well. 

It is a nice birthday gift with a 66, so I will take that. I did not hit the ball too good but I putted great today. I am happy with the way I came back (from my opening 72), said Jeev who has won on his last two starts in Japan. 

Thai star Thongchai took the halfway lead with a four-under-par 68. 

Thongchai, winner of the event in 2003, overcame an early slip in his second round at Thai Country Club before roaring across the finish line with his seven-birdie round in the Asian Tours season finale. 

Compatriot Thaworn Wiratchant showed he was determined to sign the year off as Asias No. 1 on a winning note, carding a bogey-free 65 for second place, one behind Thongchai. 

While Jeev made the big move up, Shiv Shankar Prasad Chowrasia, Indias new star this season, shot a second successive two-under 70 and moved into ninth place. 

Shiv Kapur and Jyoti Randhawa, the last two winners of this tournament, carded three-under 69 each both had a 72 on first day to come into the frame at three-under 141 and in tied 15th place. 

Amandeep Johl, 14th overnight, slipped with a five-over 77 and was tied 46th at three-over 147, while Gaurav Ghei (76) was five-over 149 in tied 53rd. 

Rahil Gangjee made some improvement with a 72 after his first day 79, and he was tied 56th. 

Jeev had a great start with birdies on the first and second holes. After that he got it to seven-under but two bogeys on the back proved to be the dampner.

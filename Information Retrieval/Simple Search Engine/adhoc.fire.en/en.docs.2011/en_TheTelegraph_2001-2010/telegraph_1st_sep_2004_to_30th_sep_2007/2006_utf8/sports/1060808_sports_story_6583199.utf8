 Cronje case

Durban: A South African court on Monday began hearing the inquest into the death of former South African captain Hansie Cronje and the judge urged the Media to report with sensitivity. 

Judge Siraj Desai of the Cape Town high court made the call after granting permission to two TV channels to record the proceedings of the inquest. 

State prosecutor Willem Tarentaal said the families of the deceased wanted the proceedings to be concluded speedily because they did not want to relive the incident. He said family members were informed about the inquest but they declined to attend. 

Cronje, who was found guilty of match-fixing, and two pilots crashed on the Outeniqwa mountains near George four years ago, in 2002. The findings of the SA Civil Aviation Authority report indicates the aircraft was technically not airworthy. (PTI)

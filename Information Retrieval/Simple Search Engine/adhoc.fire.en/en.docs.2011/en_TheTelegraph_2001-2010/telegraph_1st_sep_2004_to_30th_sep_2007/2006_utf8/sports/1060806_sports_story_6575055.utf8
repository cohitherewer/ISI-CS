Calcutta: After having split points with Railway FC on Tuesday, Mohammedan Sporting were lucky enough to manage a 1-1 draw, this time with Calcutta Port Trust, in their second match of the Sahara CFL Premier Division match at the Salt Lake Stadium on Saturday. 

Port Trust riding high after defeating defending champions Mohun Bagan on Monday took the lead in the 29th minute via a Sujit Dey strike. But an own goal by defender Soumen Sarkar in the 67th minute saved the black-and-white brigade from ignominy. 

The match witnessed some tense moments when Mohammedan Sporting supporters started throwing chairs in the ground after a penalty was turned down in extra time. Brazilian Douglas da Silva was tripped in the box and referee Subrata Sarkar indicated at the penalty spot without noticing that the linesman had already raised his flag for an off-side. 

Subrata reversed his decision after consulting the linesman and that provoked the players to get involved in a war of words. The referees were provided police protection so that they could leave the ground. 

The black-and-white brigade received one clear chance when Douglas had only the goalie to beat, after being fed with a header from Raman Vijayan. But Port Trust goalie Sandip Guha made a brilliant save to thwart the Brazilians attempt. 

Port Trust coach Aloke Mukherjees decision to not give any room to Douglas was a clever one, and Simanto Das, who was assigned to do the job, came out with flying colours. 

We were successful in our attempt to stop the Brazilian who is not fit. Simanto did well to man him and we didnt give him enough room to play, said Mukherjee.Sujit, who had scored the all-important goal against Mohun Bagan, again proved his worth by drawing the first blood for Port Trust. Avinash Thapas left footer rebounded off Mohammedan Sporting goalie Prasanta Dora and Sujit chipped in the ball to make it 1-0. 

But luck favoured the black-and-white brigade when Port Trust defender Sarkar failed to clear a ball in the box and guided it into his own net. 

Mohammedan Sporting coach Subhas Bhowmick lamented the absence of a good striker, due to which they are not able to score goals till now in the tournament. I need a good striker because the boys are not in good shape. Even Douglas, who was out of competitive football for 18 months will still need some time to return to form, said Bhowmick. The coach also vented his anger against Mike Okoro who hasnt yet returned from Poland. 

Meanwhile in another match at Kalyani, George Telegraph crushed Chirag United SC 3-0. Gautam Thakur struck a brace while Amit Biswas scored one.

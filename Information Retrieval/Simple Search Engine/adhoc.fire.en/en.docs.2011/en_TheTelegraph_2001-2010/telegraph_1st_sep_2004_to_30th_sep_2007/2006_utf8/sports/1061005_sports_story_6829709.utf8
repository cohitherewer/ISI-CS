The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 PCB to contest ECBs claim of 

 compensation 

 The Oval Fiasco

 Islamabad: The England 

 and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) has asked Pakistan to compensate 

 it for the loss of revenues in the cancelled fourth Test 

 at The Oval in August, a Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) spokesman 

 said on Wednesday.

 The spokesman said a meeting of 

 the PCBs ad-hoc committee would contest the claim. 

 The ad-hoc committee has decided to contest the claim 

 legally, he said.

 He indicated the same team of 

 lawyers which represented PCB and Inzamam-ul Haq at the 

 ICC hearing could be hired.

 An ECB spokesman said the Board 

 would not comment on the report. There has been communication 

 between the Boards but we are not in a position to divulge 

 it, he said.

 The ad-hoc committee was also 

 told that the government had approved to give a terrestrial 

 channel to the PCB to launch its own sports channel. The 

 committee has called for a feasibility report to be carried 

 out so that a final decision can be taken on whether to 

 go for the channel or not, the official stated.

 Meanwhile, the ad-hoc committee 

 confirmed Inzamam as captain for the home series against 

 the West Indies from November 7. (Agencies)

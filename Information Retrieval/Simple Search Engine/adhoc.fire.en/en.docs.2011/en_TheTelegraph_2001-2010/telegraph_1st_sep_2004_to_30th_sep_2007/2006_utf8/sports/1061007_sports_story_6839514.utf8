The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Amorina all set to strike 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Trainer Vijay Singhs prized filly Amorina is all set to bag the 2,000m Calcutta Derby Trial Stakes, the star attraction in Saturdays eight-event race card. A winner of two races from her three starts, Amorina has been displaying amazing improvement since making her debut during the Bangalore summer season.

 The only time the Steinbeck-Alvarada daughter disappointed was against another good filly, Real Excellence, who went on to trounce the Mysore 1,000 Guineas field a performance complimenting a star in the making.

 Amorina will be traversing the slated trip for the first time. But her bloodlines and recent workouts amply indicate her staying prowess. Incidentally, her dam, Alvarada, was a fancied runner but was withdrawn from the winter Derby line-up following a cut injury on the eve of the Classic.

 Jockey C.Alford, who has been nursing a back injury and accepting rides sparingly, will partner Amorina.Read as: Sl. nos, last 4 runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:

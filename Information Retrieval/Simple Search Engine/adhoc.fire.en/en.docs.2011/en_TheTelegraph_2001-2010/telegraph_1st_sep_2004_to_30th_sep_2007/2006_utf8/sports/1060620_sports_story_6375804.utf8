 Geoff Ogilvy claims maiden major 

 - US open Jeev finishes tied 59th 

Mamaroneck: Done in by the treacherous back nine for the third day running, Jeev Milkha Singh finished tied 59th in the 106th edition of the US Open golf championship which was won by Australian Geoff Ogilvy. 

Saddled by bogies on three of the last four holes, the Indian pro signed off with a six-over-par 76, which contained two birdies and eight bogeys. 

Ogilvy was rewarded with his first major for a par on the final hole, which claimed Phil Mickelson and Colin Montgomerie as victims with double bogeys. Jim Furyk bogeyed the 18th and Ogilvy beat the trio by one shot. Jeev earned $16,767, which would come handy for his money list position on European Tour. 

On each of the previous three days, Jeev was three-over for back nine and on final day he went four over. The No. 1 on UBS Asian Tour rankings accumulated a four-day total of 302 at winged foot golf club. 

This was the second time that Jeev had qualified and played in all four rounds at the US Open, which was one of the toughest ever this time around. Not a single player broke par after four rounds, with Ogilvy totalling five-over-par 285. 

Indias Jyoti Randhawa and Koreas Choi Kyung-ju had missed the cut on Friday. 

I never expected to win it outright, a smiling Ogilvy told reporters after becoming only the second Australian to claim the US Open, after David Graham in 1981. Funny things happen sometimes. 

I was the beneficiary of a little bit of charity. I think I got a bit lucky, said Ogilvy, the first Aussie to claim a major since Steve Elkington in the 1995 PGA Championship at Riviera. 

Referring to the daunting challenge of tackling the longest course in US Open history with its thick rough and heavily contoured greens, he replied: It beats you up but I enjoyed every minute of it. (Agencies)

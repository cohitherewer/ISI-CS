 Sania reveals Steffi dream on turning 20

New Delhi: Sania Mirza has not been rattled by the criticism that has followed her recent drop in WTA rankings and says she has learnt to take failures in stride. 

Sania, who turned 20 on Wednesday, said it was difficult to live up to the expectations of a billion of people. 

The pressure of expectations is part of every sportspersons life. I have become conditioned to it and, anyway, you cannot live up to the expectations of everyone, said the tennis star who finished the year at No. 66 after starting 2006 at No. 31. 

The Hyderabad girl said she finds it amazing the way cricketers handle the pressure that comes from playing the countrys favourite sport. 

In terms of popularity, tennis has only come up lately. Indians have been crazy about cricket since ages. I really admire the cricketers for their ability to handle with ease all the pressure, she said at a promotional here. 

The pressure and the mindgames involved in sport has drawn her to psychology and she wants to pursue the subject seriously once she gives up tennis. 

If I had not been a tennis player, I would have been a psychologist. I am pursuing the subject now and once I give up tennis, I will think of a career in psychology, she said. 

Sania revealed it was her dream to meet the legendary Steffi Graf. When I started playing she had already retired. She often comes to the courts with (husband) Andre Agassi but I havent had the courage to go up and ask for her autograph. But I am hopeful one day my dream will come true. (PTI)

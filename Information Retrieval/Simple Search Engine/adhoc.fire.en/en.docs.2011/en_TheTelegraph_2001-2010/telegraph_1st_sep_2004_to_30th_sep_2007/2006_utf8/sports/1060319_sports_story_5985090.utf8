 Salgaocar hold JCT 

Ludhiana: JCT Mills, Phagwara, missed plenty of chances and drew goalless against Salgaocar Sports Club of Goa in a ninth round match of the 10th ONGC National League here on Saturday. 

Though JCT dominated the proceedings throughout the encounter, they failed to translate the chances that came their way into goals. The visitors, too, wasted a couple of scoring opportunities in the game played at the Guru Nanak Stadium. 

JCT missed the easiest chance in the dying minutes of the second session, when their foreign recruit Marcos Pereira passed it on to Daljit Singh near the striking circle, but the latter took an erratic sho. 

JCT have 10 points while Salgaocar are on seven. (Agencies)

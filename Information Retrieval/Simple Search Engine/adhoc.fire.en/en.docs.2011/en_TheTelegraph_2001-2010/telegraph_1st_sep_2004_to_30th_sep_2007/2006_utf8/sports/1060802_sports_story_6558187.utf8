 Botham backs Panesar

London: Ian Botham, one of the greatest allrounders of all times, backed left-arm spinner Monty Panesar, saying the Sikh is the answer to Englands quest for a match-winning spinner. 

Its time to stop patronising Monty Panesar about the need to improve his batting or fielding and accept him for what he is the match-winning spinner weve craved for years, Botham said in his column in a daily. 

Botham said that with his sterling performance, Panesar should be undroppable. 

The former England captain criticised national coach Duncan Fletcher for not giving enough credit to Panesar. 

Botham even went on to say that at Old Trafford Panesar turned the ball more than any England spinner since Derek Underwood. 

Meanwhile, former England selector Rod Marsh says Panesar can cause major problems for Australia during the Ashes series. 

Technically I think hes a very fine bowler, Marsh told a website. 

On the other hand, Pietersen, a fine player of spin, said: I think Monty can be a fantastic bowler. I fancy my chances against most spinners and I honestly think that he is up there.

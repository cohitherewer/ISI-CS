Melbourne: World No.1 Roger Federer overcame an early scare to beat Marcos Baghdatis 5-7, 7-5, 6-0, 6-2 on Sunday, winning the Australian Open for the second time and capturing his seventh Grand Slam title. 

The Swiss reeled off 11 straight games to end the unseeded Cypriots magical odyssey and reach another landmark on his own relentless march to tennis immortality. 

Federer became the first man to win three consecutive Grand Slams title since Pete Sampras of US 12 years ago and the third man to win his first seven Grand Slam finals. 

Only the claycourt French Open continues to elude him as it did Sampras. 

Federer, a model of on-court composure, clawed his way back from losing the first set and trailing 2-0 in the second. 

But he was unable to contain his emotions when he received the Norman Brookes Challenge Cup from Australian Rod Laver, the last player to hold all four major titles, simultaneously. 

I guess its all coming out now, said Federer, with tears streaming down his cheeks. Ive had some hard speeches but this one is really tough. 

Baghdatis had captured the imagination of tennis fans the world over with his fairytale run to the championship match, but the ever-smiling Cypriot was unable to keep pace with Federer once the top seed raised his game. 

Its like a dream and Ive just woken up at the end, Baghdatis said. The 20-year-old made a confident start in his first Grand Slam final, breaking Federers serve in the fifth game, then again in the 11th game after handing back the initial break. He skipped to a 2-0 lead in the second set as an unusually error-prone Federer struggled to find his rhythm. 

Once he did, however, the match was as good as over. 

Federer got back on level terms as mistakes started to creep into his opponents game, winning the second set off an unforced error, and he stormed through the third set in 24 minutes. 

An early break in the fourth set gave Federer a 3-0 lead and although Baghdatis held serve to end an 11-game losing streak, his body was showing signs of caving in before his spirit. 

The former junior world No.1, now ranked 54th in the world, had beaten three top-10 players in Andy Roddick, Ivan Ljubicic and David Nalbandian to reach the final. But the effort had taken its toll and he started to cramp up midway through the fourth set.

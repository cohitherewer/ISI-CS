 Pak approaching comfort zone

Karachi: Mohammed Hafeez hit a patient unbeaten half century on Wednesday as Pakistan moved toward setting up a challenging target for the West Indies in the third and final Test. 

Opening batsman Hafeez dug in well for nearly four hours on a slow and low bouncy wicket to remain unbeaten on 57 off 135 balls with Pakistan progressing to 130 for two in their second innings for an overall lead of 174 at stumps on Day III. 

Mohammed Yousuf survived a tense 12 minutes and was batting on 1 when bad light stopped play 15 overs before the scheduled close. 

Yousuf needs a further 46 runs to break Viv Richards world record of 1,710 runs in a calendar year. 

Earlier, wicketkeeper-batsman Denesh Ramdin guided the West Indies to 260 in their first innings with a gritty half century and narrowed the Pakistan lead to 44. 

Hafeez added 43 in a quiet opening stand with Imran Farhat (20) and put on a further 79 with Younis Khan, who was trapped leg-before by Chris Gayle for 38. 

The West Indies had their chance to spoil Younis 29th birthday, but Dwayne Bravo dropped a sharp return catch off his own bowling when the Pakistan vice-captain was on 10. 

The West Indies pace attack kept the Pakistan opening pair quiet in the post-tea session before Daren Powell found the edge of Farhats bat in the 23rd over as the home team crawled to 61 for one at tea.

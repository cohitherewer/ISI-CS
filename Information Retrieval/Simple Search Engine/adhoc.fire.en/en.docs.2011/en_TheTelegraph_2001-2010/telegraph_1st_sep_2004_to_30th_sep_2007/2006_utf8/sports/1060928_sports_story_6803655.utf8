Mumbai: Three of the top four made their first appearances at the Kingfisher Airlines Open on Wednesday. All of them top seed Tommy Robredo, No. 3 Tomas Berdych and No. 4 Dmitry Tursunov came through in straight sets. 

But the cynosure at the CCI on Wednesday was an Indian who turned 16 not many weeks ago. Akash Wagh, the schoolboy blessed with a wild card, went down 2-6, 5-7 to Tursunov but not before confirming Mahesh Bhupathis belief that hes a very special talent. 

Berdych was the most impressive of the trio, playing silky smooth tennis to shut out Polish journeyman Lukasz Kubot 6-2, 6-2. Robredo didnt have to exert too much either, getting an early break in the first set and running through the second to oust Austrian Alexander Peya 6-4, 6-2. 

Berdych, one of the most improved players on the Tour over the past 12 months or so, delivered eight thundering aces, including four in the eighth game, to close out the first set. In the second, his quality of returns improved significantly. 

The only time Berdych who turned 21 ten days ago faced break points was when he was serving for the match. From 0-40, though, he reeled off five straight points with an exhibition of unreturnable serves to seal a second-round meeting with German Simon Greul. 

Having played Davis Cup indoors in Holland over the weekend, I was expecting a tough opening match in totally different conditions, Berdych said later. So Im really happy it went off so well today. I felt quite good on court and hit the ball pretty well. 

Indeed he did. The man who first made the headlines by ending Roger Federers campaign at the Athens Olympics will be the one to beat this week. 

World No. 7 Robredo, too, was delighted with his opening show and celebrated with a game of remote controlled cars with a 10-year-old on court. It was no fun practising in the morning and was getting tired running around, but the weather was much better in the evening, he said . 

Back to Wagh, our boy wonder. The star trainee at Bhupathis Elite academy in Bangalore looked a fish out of water in the first six games, dropping serve twice. Then the left-handers free-swinging game caused a bother or two for the Russian. 

Tursunov, another Davis Cupper having to adjust from European conditions, struggled with his returns and the afternoon humidity. By the time he wrapped up the first set, Wagh was getting into a groove with his kicking serves and steady baseline slugging. 

There were some typical schoolboyish mistakes, especially when he tried the exaggerated forehand top-spin returns. At times, the inexperience showed, as it was bound to. But by outscoring Tursunov on the aces count (7-6), forcing four break-points and staying in touch with his famous opponent till the 10th game of the second set, Wagh certainly emerged with more points than many expected. 

Wagh, in fact, did well to breakback straight after dropping serve in the second set. And when he held serve in the fifth game, Wagh had his nose in front for the first time an achievement in itself against someone who just beat Andy Roddick in a crucial Davis Cup rubber. 

Tursunov didnt exactly shower praise on Wagh at the post-match conference. He was very inconsistenthe missed some shots which he shouldnt have and got some which I thought he would miss. But hes got a decent serve which can be developed into a weapon, was how Tursunov summed it up. 

Wagh said he wasnt nervous. I had nothing to lose and played freely. But I shouldnt have made so many mistakes. I also have to work on my fitness. 

In doubles action, the Indo-Pak combination of Leander Paes and Aisam Qureshi beat Ramon Delgado (Paraguay) and Konstantinos Economidis (Greece) 6-4, 6-4 to set up a Friday date with top seeds Mahesh Bhupathi and Mario Ancic. 

We played really well today, Aisam served excellently, said Paes. On Friday well be the underdogs If we can serve like we did today, it should be a good contest. 

Rohan Bopanna and Mustafa Ghouse completed a happy evening by beating Rik de Voest (South Africa) and Igor Kunitsyn (Russia) 7-6, 6-1 to reach the semis.

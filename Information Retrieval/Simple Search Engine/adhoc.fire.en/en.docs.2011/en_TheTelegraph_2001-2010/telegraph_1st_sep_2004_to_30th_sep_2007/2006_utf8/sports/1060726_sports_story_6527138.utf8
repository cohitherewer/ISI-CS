 Fiorentina, Lazio back in Serie A

 Rome: Fiorentina and Lazio 

 were restored to Serie A, while Juventus had their points 

 penalty in Serie B cut almost in half after successful appeals 

 in the Italian match-fixing scandal on Tuesday. 

AC Milan also had their points penalty in Serie A cut from 15 to eight. Juventus went from 30 to 17. Fiorentina will have 19 points docked in the Italian topflight next season, while Lazio will be minus 11. 

The sports court also upheld the earlier ruling stripping Juventus of their last two Serie A titles. But Milan have also been allowed to play in the Champions League preliminary rounds this season. 

The Italian news agency ANSA said the five-year bans for former Juventus executives Luciano Moggi and Antonio Giraudo ? the figures at the centre of the scandal ? were upheld. 

Uefa, meanwhile, has extended the deadline for the submission of the names of Italian clubs eligible to take part in the 2006-07 European club competitions until Wednesday.

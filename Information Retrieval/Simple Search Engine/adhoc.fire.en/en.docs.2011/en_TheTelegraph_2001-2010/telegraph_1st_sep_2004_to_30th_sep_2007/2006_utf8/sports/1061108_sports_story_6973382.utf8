 Japanese delight in Melbourne 

 Melbourne: Delta Blues beat his stablemate Pop Rock in a thrilling photo-finish to lead a Japanese one-two in Tuesdays 146th running of the Melbourne Cup. The two horses, both trained by Katsuhiko Sumii, burst clear of the field down the final stretch to fight out the finish with Delta Blues holding on to win by half a head.

 Maybe Better, ridden by Australias Hong Kong-based jockey Chris Munce, fought on strongly to take third, four and a half lengths behind the runner-up, while Irish stayer Yeats was seventh and joint favourite Tawqeet 19th.

 Delta Blues, who started at odds of 18-1, became the first Asian-trained horse to win Australias richest and most famous horse race, first run in 1861, and only the third winner prepared outside of Australia and New Zealand.

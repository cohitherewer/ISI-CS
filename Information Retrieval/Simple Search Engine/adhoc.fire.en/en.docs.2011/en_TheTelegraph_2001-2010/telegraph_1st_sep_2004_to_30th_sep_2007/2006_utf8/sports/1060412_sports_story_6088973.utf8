 ICC denies BCCI claim

 Champions Trophy

 Dubai: The ICC on Tuesday 

 denied reports that the BCCI had negotiated a reduction 

 in the cost of the fourth venue for this years ICC 

 Champions Tro5phy, from $1 million to $200,000.

 The ICC said that a larger figure 

 was arrived at on the basis of an itinerary requested by 

 the BCCI that would have meant the hire of an extra broadcasting 

 unit to provide television coverage.

 However, that cost was reduced 

 to approximately to $200,000 when the ICC, taking into account 

 the BCCIs wishes, revised the schedule and removed 

 the need for that extra unit.

 BCCI president Sharad Pawar said 

 on Sunday the board had turned down the ICCs demand 

 for $1 million and got it scaled down. (PTI)

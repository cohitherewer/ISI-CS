 Hari settles for draw

 Crimea Meet

 Crimea: Grandmaster P. 

 Harikrishna settled for a draw against Ruslan Ponomariov 

 in the 10th round of the Aerosvit International Grandmasters 

 Chess tournament here on Tuesday. Five other games also 

 ending in stalemate meant status quo was maintained with 

 regard to players position in the category-18 tournament 

 in which one more round remains.

 Harikrishna and Ponomariov signed 

 the peace treaty after 36 moves. Ponomariov opted for the 

 Tartakower Defence against the queens gambit.

 Tournament leader GM Sergei Rublevsky 

 of Russia and second placed Ukrainian GM Vassily Ivanchuk 

 drew after repetition of moves.

 The presence of opposite coloured 

 bishops on board allowed Moldovan GM Viktor Bologan to escape 

 with a draw in his game against Alexander Grischuk. The 

 draw enabled Bologan to hang on to third place in the standings.

 Nisipeanu played the Sozin attack 

 against the Sicilian Najdorf played by Sergei Karjakin.

 The battle became very exciting 

 in the middlegame as Nisipeanu sacrificed a bishop and gained 

 strong attack against the black king which was stranded 

 in the centre.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Rathore vows more glory by year-end

 - I want to retain Commonwealth gold, but thats not everything 

JAYDEEP BASU

New Delhi: One could spot Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore from a distance. He looked a forlorn figure in the well spread-out shotgun practice field at the Dr Karni Singh Shooting Range. There was no one around except a couple of assistants, who preferred to sit under the shade in the makeshift pavilion. 

With the gun in hand and full of concentration, Rathore was going through his daily practice session under the scorching sun from 8 am. It was 10.30 when the Olympic silver-medallist decided to take a break. He was sweating profusely. 

Thats my normal routine, he told The Telegraph casually. I dont really know how many hours I put in for practice. Frankly, all my waking hours are dedicated to shooting. It includes practice at the range, a few hours at the gym and meditation. 

The Commonwealth Games, beginning in Melbourne next month, is important for Rathore, but there is life beyond it. True, I am a gold-medallist of the last Games in Manchester and will like to retain the position, but thats not everything. Winning or losing does not always matter, he said. 

Slim and athletic, the Lt Col felt it was important to do well in a string of international meets after the Commonwealth Games. I am looking forward to many other competitions this year. I must do well in all these meets. 

Rathore was referring to four World Cup meets in China, America, Egypt and Germany between April and June, followed by the World Championships in July and the World Cup finals in Spain in October. The quota (qualification) for the Olympics will be on the basis of results in these meets, Rathore informed. 

Suchak Laszlo, the Hungarian coach of the Indian team, is confident of his wards bringing about 20 medals from Melbourne. 

On his prospects, Rathore said: By the end of the year, I will be able to bring more glory for the country. 

On his present form, Rathore smiled and said: I am not at my best at the moment but I am not unhappy. I want to peak at the right moment. 

Rathore is satisfied with the kind of ammunition the shooters are getting for practice. Previously, the Government used to get ammunition through tenders and we used to get a lot of sub-standard stuff. Now a committee has been formed by the Government to import ammunition. Things have improved, Rathore explained. 

Laszlo, however, is not fully satisfied. In other countries, shooters get ammunition for 300 days practice. Indian shooters get it for 70 days only. Thats not enough to compete at the world level, the Hungarian commented.

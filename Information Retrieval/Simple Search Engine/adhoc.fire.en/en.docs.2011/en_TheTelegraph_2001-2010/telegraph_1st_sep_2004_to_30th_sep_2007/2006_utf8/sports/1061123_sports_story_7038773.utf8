 Classic runners passed test 

 STAR RACER

 Barring Imran Chistys riding of Rosa Belle in the Pentire Handicap last Thursday, racing appeared to be quite clean. Stewards opened an inquiry into the running and riding of the Errol Bhungard trainee. Chisty had also disappointed on the firm favourite, Best Of The Blues in the feature event, the 1,200m R.W.I.T.C. Cup but it was for a different reason. The Warrshan colt may have needed the experience of handling the pace in the top Class company.

 The 8-10 favourite was always in a striking position behind the leaders Anzello and Serrafina but failed to match the Vijay Singh-winner, Serrafinas superior pace 300m from home. In fact, a late finishing Chill Pill, who was also unlucky to face a traffic problem along the rails sidetrack edged him out at the wire.

 Earlier in the afternoon Vijays Aromatique, had thrashed her three rivals in the 1,400m Little Lady Handicap. The Steinbeck-Allspice colt led from the start and frustrated his rivals, including the Chisty-ridden Arabie.

 Chisty was, however, in full command on Daniel Davids two Classic runners Right Again and Moon Forest. In the 2,000m Adelina Cup, Right Again was forced to hurry up his winning effort, from fourth berth to second, after the leader, El Cid, literally bolted with a double-distance threatening lead from the 1,200m marker. It was easy for the Steinbeck son once he collared the leader three furlongs from the winning post. Right Again won pulling up a furlong from home.

 Moon Forest, on the other hand, was a bit sluggish when asked to over take Clockwork 300m from the post in the 1,600m Bol Publication Cup. However, the filly was back to her task when Chisty flashed the whip. Once in her galloping rhythm she simply sailed away from her rivals.

 Trainer John Stephens surprised with a priced double. He started off with Boogie Nights victory in the Gabarnac Handicap, though the trainers Legal Lady was the favourite to win the race. However, there was no foul play as the Lady needed a longer than the slated trip of 1,200m which was perhaps tailormade for the speedy winner. Shane Domingo partnered the winner and the apprentice went on to guide Stephens Secret Desire, as well, to victory.

 Quick Takes

 De Rossi sends explanation to Fifa

 Duisburg: Italy midfielder 

 Daniele De Rossi sent a letter on Tuesday to Fifas 

 disciplinary committee explaining his elbow to an opponents 

 face. Fifa expects to announce its decision by Friday. 

 De Rossi elbowed United States 

 forward Brian McBride in the face in Saturdays 1-1 

 draw, earning a red card and drawing blood from a cut under 

 McBrides left eye. The cut required three stitches 

 to close. 

 In the letter, De Rossi took full 

 responsibility for his error and explained how he apologised 

 personally to McBride after the game. De Rossi also apologised 

 for damaging soccers image. Fifa will also consider 

 Uruguayan referee Jorge Larriondas report on the incident 

 and TV replays.

 Tough day for German police

 Cologne: Police have detained 

 15 England fans in Cologne for drunk and disorderly behaviour 

 ahead of their World Cup match with Sweden in the city and 

 expect Tuesday to be their most challenging day yet.

 In the most violent disturbance, 

 16 German police officers suffered cuts after several England 

 fans pelted them with glass bottles in the citys old 

 town. 

 Trouble broke out after drunk 

 fans tried to scale a statue in a central square to drape 

 it with England flags. One man fell from the statue at which 

 point police tried to disperse revellers with pepper spray, 

 who then began to throw bottles.

 Assistant chief constable Stephen 

 Thomas, head of the English police mission to the World 

 Cup, said six fans had been detained in the old city, another 

 fan for trying to break into Colognes Rhein-Energie 

 stadium, six for brawling among themselves and another fan 

 for being too drunk to stand.

 Ribery Lyon-bound

 Hamelin: France midfielder 

 Franck Ribery said he wished to leave Olympique Marseille 

 for French champions Olympique Lyon. My wish is not 

 to play for Marseille any more next season, Ribery 

 told a French daily. Lyon is clearly my priority. 

 I wish to stay in France for another two or three years 

 and Lyon is the ideal choice for me and my family, 

 added the 23-year-old, who had received offers from several 

 foreign clubs including Manchester United.

 Lyon really want me and 

 are offering me a really interesting challenge. Frances 

 top prospect and a member of their World Cup squad, Ribery 

 is being hailed as the next Zinedine Zidane. The gifted 

 attacking midfielder is under contract with Marseille for 

 another year and club president Pape Diouf said he wanted 

 to keep him. Lyon president Jean-Michel Aulas has said it 

 was just a matter of time before Ribery joined the five-times 

 French champions.

 Betting frenzy

 Hong Kong: Hong Kong may 

 not have a team at the World Cup but that has not stopped 

 interest reaching stratospheric proportions because of the 

 craze for soccer betting.

 The current World Cup competition 

 in Germany is the first since Hong Kong legalised soccer 

 gambling three years ago and the territorys already 

 healthy appetite for betting is at fever pitch. Soccer gambling 

 was legalised to curb illegal soccer betting, which totalled 

 at least HK$20 billion in 2001, the government estimates. 

 Taxation of legal soccer gambling meanwhile raised HK$2 

 billion in fiscal 2004-05, helping push government finances 

 into the black for the first time since the Asian financial 

 crisis.

 Golden sacrifice

 Johannesburg: South African 

 gold producer Gold Fields was told to temporarily cut power 

 usage at its mines in Ghana during the World Cup as thousands 

 of televisions sucked up power. We were asked to cut 

 down on our power use during the World Cup... It was a formal 

 letter that came through, Terence Goodlace, head of 

 international operations, told an analysts presentation 

 on Tuesday. Gold Fields has two gold mines in Ghana, Africas 

 second biggest gold producer after South Africa. 

 Ghana, playing in their first 

 World Cup, earned a stunning 2-0 victory over the highly-rated 

 Czech Republic on Saturday and meet the United States in 

 their final Group E match on Thursday. Ghana lost their 

 opening match 2-0 to Italy but can still qualify for the 

 last 16. The Italians are top with four points followed 

 by the Czechs and Ghana on three and the US on one. 

 Good job, Korea: Beckenbauer

 Berlin: German soccer legend 

 and World Cup 2006 organisation president Franz Beckenbauer 

 praised the South Korean squad and said they deserved the 

 1-1 draw with France. I was very happy when we finally 

 got the goal, Korean Football Association President 

 and Fifa Vice President Chung Moon-joon told reporters after 

 the game in Leipzig. Chung watched the game with Fifa President 

 Joseph Blatter and Beckenbauer. And Chung said Beckenbauer 

 turned to him after the result and said: Your team 

 deserved that.

 Not scared of Brazil: Zico

 Bonn: Japan coach Zico, 

 whose side faces an early World Cup exit, has said tournament 

 favourites Brazil do not scare his side ahead of Thursdays 

 group F clash. The Asian champions must pull off an astonishing 

 two-goal victory over the holders in Dortmund and hope Australia 

 do not beat Croatia to have any chance of advancing.

 quot;We have played Brazil before 

 and I dont think theyre an opponent who particularly 

 frighten us, quot; Zico said on Monday. quot;We have to 

 work out a way to beat them. quot;

 Midfielder Shunsuke Nakamura said: 

 quot;It will be a very difficult game. But rather than 

 just pulling nine men behind the ball and looking to catch 

 them on the break, its important to try to play our 

 game and see where it gets us. quot;

 Watch out, Tiger

 Berlin: The Trinidad and 

 Tobago federation already has talked to Leo Beenhakker about 

 staying on as coach after the World Cup. But the Dutch-born 

 coach has other plans before he makes his decision. Probably 

 after the World Cup I will play golf for three months and 

 make Tiger Woods a little nervous, Beenhakker said.

 Pitch invader

 Oehringen: A young woman 

 interrupted the Australian practice here on Monday, running 

 on the field in the middle of a training game to get autographs. 

 She got three from bemused Socceroos before security whisked 

 her away. The woman got one autograph from a player in the 

 game, then decided to up the ante.

 She ran to the other side of the 

 field and got midfielder Mile Sterjovski, sitting on the 

 ground, waiting for his turn in the game, to sign. She ran 

 back on to the field, where stewards converged on her. But 

 not before backup goalkeeper Zeljko Kalac signed for her.

 Viduka major threat: Kranjcar

 Bad Brueckenau: Croatia 

 have picked out Australian striker Mark Viduka as the main 

 threat to their World Cup hopes and will man-mark him during 

 their group F decider on Thursday. Their greatest 

 danger is that they play as a team and that they have Mark 

 Viduka, Croatia coach Zlatko Kranjcar said on Tuesday.

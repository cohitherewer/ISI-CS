Manama: Becoming Formula Ones youngest world champion has changed Fernando Alonsos approach to racing. 

I always arrived at the first race in the past thinking to be fighting for the races or to be on the podiums or winning races, the Renault driver told a news conference before Sundays season-opening Bahrain Grand Prix. 

Now, I am much more confident about myself and much more looking forward to the championship at the end, to be World Champion again, said the 24-year-old Spaniard. 

It doesnt matter how many races you win, its only a matter of being champion at the end. That is a different approach. 

Alonso won seven races last year, the same number as McLarens runner-up Kimi Raikkonen, but was always well ahead thanks to his consistency in scoring points. 

He won three of the first four Grands Prix, including Bahrain, and wrapped up the title in Brazil with two races to spare. Renault sealed the constructors crown despite winning fewer races than McLaren. 

Sometimes Alonso played a tactical game, banking safe points rather than going all out for victory. 

We arrive ready again, the new car is competitive and strong enough to be quick on the race pace. I think we are ready for the first race, said Alonso. (REUTERS)

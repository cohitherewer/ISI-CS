The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Its a setback: Dravid

 - A pretty complete show, says Ponting 

 Damien Martyn with Man-of-the-Match trophy on Sunday 

Rahul Dravid looked affected by yet another loss and, this one, at home when he came for the customary Media conference after Sundays match versus Australia in Mohali. Ricky Ponting, however, had a contended look. With good reasons, of course. 

The following are excerpts from what they said: 

DRAVID: Nothing is satisfying when you dont win... We didnt bowl well in the first 15 overs or so and they scored at over six an over... We ourselves fell short by some runs, but given the way Australia paced their chase, even 20 more wouldnt have made a difference... We could definitely have bowled better and our bowlers had a real bad game after a long time... Perhaps, Ajit Agarkars presence wouldve helped... His experience... Australia began the tournament as favourites and nothing happened today for me to change my opinion... With Shane Watson opening, they can have the extra bowler and he lends balance... Weve got to improve in all areas... Is time running out (with the World Cup nearing)? Well, weve got to keep working hard, keep trying to improve... Its a setback, if you want to look at it that way, but I have belief in the squad... Im quite happy with the pool of players we pick from, its only a question of some pieces falling into place... Criticism of coaches and captains comes with the territory... One must learn to accept it and deal with it... 

PONTING: Overall, it has been a very good win, especially after losing the toss... A pretty complete show... The wicket turned out to be a typical one for one-dayers, though it did spin in the second session... We chased well and our plan against Harbhajan Singh (who went wicketless) worked... I gave the new ball to Glenn (McGrath) as he enjoys the challenge of bowling to the best in the world... He began the game with his nose slightly in front of Sachin Tendulkar... Now, its gone a bit further... We took wickets at regular intervals and, towards the end, didnt give away freebies... I know we havent ever won the Champions Trophy, but cant have excuses now... Weve got players in form and the semi-finals (versus New Zealand) will be on a ground where weve just won...

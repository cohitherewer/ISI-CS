The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Windies given option to play in Asia

 - Two grounds unlikely to be ready in US by Sept. 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Lara amp; Dravid: Where will they meet for the next ODI? 

Calcutta: With the United States of America Cricket Association (USACA) unlikely to have two full-fledged grounds ready by September, theres a possibility that India and the West Indies may play three ODIs in either Singapore or Kuala Lumpur that month. 

If that materialises, the face-off is going to be after the triangular in Sri Lanka and before the Champions Trophy in India. 

The West Indies won the last bilateral series, at home, 4-1. 

Weve given that (Singapore/KL) option to the West Indies? In fact, weve even suggested the matches could be played in Europe, former Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) president Inderjit Singh Bindra told The Telegraph. 

Bindra is the very public face of the regime headed by Sharad Pawar. 

The ODIs, of course, are part of the arrangement worked out between India and the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) two months ago. 

The deal was struck in the lead-up to the International Cricket Councils meeting on determining the World Cup hosts beyond 2007. 

Asia is No.1 on that list. 

According to Bindra, the WICB is keen on having the matches in North America, but the problem is with the venues in the US. If the ODIs are scheduled in that region, one will be hosted by Toronto, Canadas showpiece city. 

While were hopeful, I fear the US wont be in a position to have two grounds ready by September? Weve been looking at Florida, New York and New Jersey, Bindra, who recently interacted with both USACA and the Canadian Cricket Association (CCA) brass, remarked. 

Significantly, even if the grounds are ready, the world bodys stamp of approval is a must. That wont come about without an inspection. 

While the West Indies keenness on North America is understandable, it wont be proper to rush into matches in that region. 

Thats why weve suggested alternatives for September? If the WICB remains intent on North America, then the three ODIs are going to be played next year, Bindra added. 

The status should be clear within a fortnight. 

While the USACA is headed by Gladstone Dainty, CCA chief Ben Sennik is of Indian origin.

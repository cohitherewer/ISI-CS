 Botham hails Dravid

Dubai: Former England captain Ian Botham has heaped praise on Rahul Dravid, saying he was different from fellow superstars who were good only in their backyards. 

You can see the way he has come on in the last few months. He took on the responsibility of captaincy under adverse circumstances with the issue of Sourav Ganguly dragging on but he has responded brilliantly, Botham said. 

The Indian team has a few superstars who are good in their backyards. But Dravid is different. He has the technique and his record proves his ability, a local daily quoted his as saying on Saturday.

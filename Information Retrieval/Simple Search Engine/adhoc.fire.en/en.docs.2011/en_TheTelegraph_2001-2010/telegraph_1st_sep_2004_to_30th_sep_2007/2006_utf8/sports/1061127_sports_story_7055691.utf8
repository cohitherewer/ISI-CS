Hyderabad: Sania Mirza and Rohan Bopanna powered electrifying wins to blank Chinese Taipei 3-0 and lift the inaugural Asian Hopman Cup. 

The win also fetched India a berth in the main draw of the Hopman Cup to be held in Australia. 

Sania set the tone of the tie with a convincing 6-2, 6-4 win over Hsuan Hwang before Davis Cupper Bopanna relied on his power packed serves to hand over a 6-3, 6-4 drubbing of Ti Chen. 

The duo then combined to win the mixed doubles tie, which Hwang and Chen conceded after losing the first 1-6. 

Sania, recovering from last nights fever, was not in her elements but outplayed his opponent, ranked 316 in world. 

Sania broke Hwang in the 5th and 7th games in the first set with huge applause from the spectators. 

In the second set, Sania drew first blood and broke Hwang in the very first game and then held her serve to lead 2-0 to the delight of the capacity crowd. 

Hwang did not give up and came close to 3-4 at one stage but the power packed forehand of Sania kept the Chinese Taipei player at bay and Sania went on to pick up the second set at 6-4 to give India a 1-0 lead. 

I did not have the energy to reply to some of the serves but was just there and could win the match, Sania said. 

In the mens singles, Bopanna displayed some of his skills and power packed serves to the delight of the holiday crowd leaving his opponent Ti Chen rattled on many occasions. 

Bopanna took the second set 6-4 enabling India to earn a berth in the main draw next month along with Australia, Croatia, Czech Republic, Germany, Russia, Spain and the US. (PTI)

Doha : The petrol-rich state of Qatar is in a state of huge excitement at the moment. 

For the tiny nation, which has an embarrassment of riches on its banks and big dreams in its sleep, Friday is going to be a biggest day in its sporting history. Having invested 2.8 billion dollars solely on the Asian Games infrastructure, the country with a population of only 800,000 people strongly believe that the opening ceremony of the continental sporting extravaganza is going to provide a lasting legacy. 

The organising committee officials have already claimed that the opening ceremony is going to be the best and the boldest in the Games history. And if the gigantic nature of the infrastructure built all around the city is of any indication, then Doha is certainly going to host the most impressive Games ever. 

For those who have come from a country like India, it was like a conducted tour of heaven. The spectacular Aspire Sports Complex is definitely the most awesome of them all. The largest indoor sports dome in the world will host gymnastics, badminton, weightlifting, wrestling, boxing, wushu and kadaddi all under one roof. 

But this captures only a small part of the great sports complex. It covers 290sq metres and includes 20 classrooms, eight full-size soccer pitches, an Olympic-size swimming pool, a 200-metre athletic track, a diving pool, gymnastic hall, multi-sports hall, table tennis arena and squash courts. 

Nearby is the refurbished Khalifa Stadium which will hold the opening and closing ceremonies and the athletics programme and has already hosted numerous crucial World Cup meets. This is one pitch, which was graced by the likes of Pele and Maradona. Here on Wednesday, India faltered and frittered away chances before being held by to a 1-1 draw by Hong Kong. 

Fridays opening ceremony at the Khalifa Stadium, which can hold 50,000 people, is likely to be seen by three billion television viewers. Australian David Atkins, who directed the opening and closing ceremonies of the Sydney Olympics Games, has been roped in by the organisers here to make it a memorable one.

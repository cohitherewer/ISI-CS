 HC division bench refuses to hear case

OUR LEGAL REPORTER

Calcutta: Samar Pal of Aryan Club on Wednesday moved an application before the Calcutta High Court demanding speedy disposal of the case he had filed in the city civil court seeking appointment of an independent observer to conduct the CAB elections on July 30. 

But the division bench of the High Court, comprising Justice P.K. Chattopaddhaya and Justice K.D. Mukherjee, refused to hear the case. The judges sent the matter to Chief Justice V.S. Sirpurkar for re-assignment. 

The case in the High Court is expected to come up for hearing in a separate bench within two days.

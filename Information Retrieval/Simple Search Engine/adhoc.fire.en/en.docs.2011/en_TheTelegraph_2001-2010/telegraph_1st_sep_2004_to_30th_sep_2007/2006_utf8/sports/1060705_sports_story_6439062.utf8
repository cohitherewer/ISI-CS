 Sri Lanka smash ODI record with 443/9

 - The Netherlands dismissed for 248 

 Dilshan

Amsterdam: Sri Lanka on Tuesday set a new one-day world record by piling up a total of 443 for nine in a mismatch against The Netherlands in Amstelveen. 

Sanath Jayasuriya hit 157 off 104 balls and Tillekeratne Dilshan finished 117 not out as they bettered South Africas 438 for the loss of nine wickets against Australia in March. 

Sri Lanka won by 195 runs. The hosts were dismissed for 248 in 48.3 overs. Dilhara Fernando and Lokuarachchi bagged three wickets each. 

It was further evidence of the tourists mastery of the one-day game following on from their 5-0 series whitewash of England. 

But it came against a hopelessly outclassed side, one of the leading six associate countries, which are not part of the full Test playing nationss club of which Sri Lanka are one. 

The International Cricket Council (ICC) on January 1 decided to award full ODI status to games involving associate countries. 

Sri Lanka won the toss in the two-match series, and after losing Upal Tharanga for 18 their batsmen went on the rampage. 

Jayasuriya, who had a six and 24 fours, and Kumar Sangakkara put on 149 for the third wicket before they were both dismissed by Dutch Debutant Mohammed Kashif. 

Dilshan then took over the charge hitting two sixes and 14 fours from just 79 deliveries.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 CA to look at long-term alliance with MCA

 - Australian state teams may train at Kinrara 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Kuala Lumpur: Highly impressed by the facilities at the Kinrara Oval, Cricket Australia (CA) will explore the possibility of a long-term relationship with the Malaysian Cricket Association (MCA). State teams, too, may come over here for off-season training and matches against the national team. 

Weve been very impressed and the tournament (tri-series) has been conducted very well... Its now a matter of having detailed discussions, CA chairman Creag Connor told The Telegraph Friday. 

He added: Its not just about Australia playing in Kuala Lumpur, but our state teams as well... As the facilities are very good, more than one state could get interested... The states are: New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania, Western Australia and Victoria. 

The Australians keenness has come as great news for the MCA. 

Were going to speak to CA... That apart, well be looking to host A tournaments and Twenty20 competitions, informed deputy president P. Krishnasamy. The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) which installed the floodlights has expressed its inability to play next year and, so, the MCA is targeting Australia, South Africa, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. 

We dont know their schedules as yet, but were keen to have a tri-series in 2007, too, he added. The cricket season in Malaysia runs from March to October. 

The MCA, which may pocket $200,000 as incentive for playing host to a tournament put together by the BCCI, intends using the earnings (a) to fund an indoor centre at the Kinrara Oval; (b) for accommodation for trainees, as the academy is housed there; (c) to have a gym and swimming pool in place. At the moment, construction of permanent stands isnt a priority, Krishnasamy said. 

The Kinrara Oval , incidentally, is going to host the semi-finals and the final of the 2008 U-19 World Cup. Its a matter of pride that Malaysia has become the first non-Test playing nation to be awarded the event, he pointed out. By Sunday evening, when the tri-series ends, the MCA should be more proud.

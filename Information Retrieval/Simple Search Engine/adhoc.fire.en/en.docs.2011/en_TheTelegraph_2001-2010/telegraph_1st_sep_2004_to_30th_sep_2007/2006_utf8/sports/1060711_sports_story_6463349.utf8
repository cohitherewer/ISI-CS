The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Ifs, butts and pure joy...

 - Checklist / Semi-Finals and Final

JAYDEEP BASU 

 Football is a great leveller. 

 For Zinedine Zidane, what was widely expected to be a fairytale 

 ending, turned out to be the worst day in his life. 

 While the French superstar walked 

 past the World Cup a lonely man after being given marching 

 orders by the referee for an off-the-ball foul, Fabio Cannavaro, 

 his counterpart ? facing match-fixing charges back home 

 with some of other teammates ? held aloft the same trophy 

 a few minutes later. It was Italys first shot at the 

 coveted Cup after 1982, and they were no doubt the worthy 

 winners. The following is a brief recapitulation of what 

 was hot and what was not: 

 Team of the tournament: Italy

 The Azzurris were undoubtedly 

 the most impressive team, notwithstanding their triumph 

 in the final via a penalty shootout. Tactically, they were 

 the most cohesive lot. While they conceded only two goals 

 in seven matches, the Italians also dazzled their rivals 

 with some good attacking display, especially against hosts 

 Germany.

 Best Player: Cannavaro (Italy) 

 The Italian skipper, who played 

 his 100th international match in the final, led from the 

 front and belied his diminutive stature with some giant 

 performances. His best came in the semi-final and the final 

 when he was able to keep both Miroslav Klose and Thierry 

 Henry under check. So dominant was his role in the Italian 

 defence that the absence of Nesta was never felt.

 Youngest performer: Podolski 

 (Germany)

 The Polish born striker not only 

 scored three goals, but also formed a deadly combination 

 with Miroslav Klose. His pressing and positive attitude 

 won him more admirers than another youngster ? Cristiano 

 Ronaldo, who was a bigger star before the start of the World 

 Cup.

 Best save: Buffon (Italy)

 The save by Italian custodian 

 Gianluigi Buffon in the 111th minute in the final against 

 France. France were dominating, and Zidane slipped the ball 

 out to Willy Sagnol and then met the ensuing cross with 

 a bullet like header, but Buffon showed remarkable reflex 

 to tip it over.

 Best goal: Materazzi (Italy)

 After being down by a goal in 

 the seventh minute, Italy hauled themselves level thanks 

 to a potent combination of Pirlos dead-ball mastery 

 and the aerial ability of Materazzi, as the latter towered 

 above the French defence to bullet the formers corner 

 past Barthez.

 Best coach: Lippi (Italy)

 The 58-year-old Italian coach 

 has proved to be a master tactician with his clever handling 

 of the team and substitution policy. He also caught his 

 rivals on the wrong foot by constantly changing his attacking 

 policy in the crucial matches against Germany and France.

 Best match: Italy vs France

 Though the match did not rise 

 to the expected level, soccer fans would always remember 

 it for the excitement and incredible drama. If two goals 

 in the first 20 minutes opened up the game into a lively 

 affair, then Zidanes head-butting Materazzi and his 

 subsequent ejection remained the most inglorious moment 

 in the history of the game.

 Best quote: France coach Domenech 

 on Zidanes red card

 Zidanes red card was one 

 of the turning-points of the match, as was Vieira coming 

 off (with an injury). I dont know what (Marco) Materazzi 

 said (to Zidane), but hes the Man of the Match, not 

 (Andrea) Pirlo. Its Materazzi who equalised and provoked 

 Zidanes sending-off. Its sad, but I think the 

 Italian player made a meal out of what happened.

 Worst miss: Ribery (France) 

 vs Italy

 Ribery created and then spurned 

 the best opportunity of the extra period on Sunday. He played 

 a wall pass with Malouda on the edge of the Italy box and 

 continued his run into the area before poking the ball just 

 wide of the far post. It could have changed the fate of 

 the final.

 Worst refereeing decision: 

 Elizondo (Italy vs France)

 France were denied a penalty when 

 midfielder Malouda was brought down for the second time 

 inside the box. The referee, who did not hesitate to award 

 a spot kick in the sixth minute, chose to ignore a more 

 blatant foul in the second half for reasons best known to 

 him.

 Biggest disappointment: Red 

 card to Zidane

 On the brink of becoming a part 

 of soccer folklore, Zidane made the most inglorious exit 

 in his farewell match when he head-butted Materazzi for 

 reasons best known to him. The incident left football fans 

 world over completely stunned.

 Surprise package: Portugal 

 Hardly anyone expected Portugal 

 to go this far, yet they made the semi-finals after a gap 

 of 40 years. Under the able guidance of Luis Scolari and 

 led by the evergreen Luis Figo, they looked a well-knit 

 side. A little more sharpness in attack could have seen 

 them through in the semi-finals, too.

 Most touching gesture: Camoranesi 

 consoles Trezeguet

 It was a failure on the part of 

 Trezeguet whose penalty ? Frances second ? crashed 

 against the crossbar and refused to cross the line. At the 

 end, his Juventus teammate Camoranesi went to him and hugged 

 him.

 Most disappointing moment: 

 Zidanes absence during prize distribution

 Red carded during extra time, 

 Zidane was not allowed to take part in the prize distribution 

 ceremony. French goalkeeper Barthez had to act as the stand-in 

 skipper to accept the runners-up trophy.

 Maximum turnout: 80,000 at 

 Berlin (Italy vs France).

 Most yellow cards in a match: 16 in Portugal 

 vs The Netherlands (Portugal 9, The Netherlands 7).

 Most red cards in a match: Four in Portugal vs 

 The Netherlands (Portugal 2, The Netherlands 2).

 Total yellow cards: 343.

 Total red cards: 21

 Total goals scored: 141

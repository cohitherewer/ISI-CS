 Vishy expects India to win both series

 Tour of West Indies

 Mumbai: Former Test middle-order 

 mainstay Gundappa Viswanath expects India to come home by 

 wrapping up both the one-day and Test rubbers on their forthcoming 

 visit to the West Indies, ending the countrys 35-year 

 Test series victory drought in the Caribbean.

 Winning abroad has not been 

 happening to Indian cricket for a long time. This series 

 gives the best chance of winning a Test series in the West 

 Indies, not because the West Indies team is going through 

 a difficult phase, but because the Indian team is doing 

 well, Viswanath said here on Wednesday.

 The one-time wrist specialist, 

 predecessor to Mohammed Azharuddin and VVS Laxman in the 

 dextrous use of his wrist, is here as a specialist coach 

 for the West Zone unit of the National Cricket Academy.

 Viswanath has been giving his 

 invaluable insights on the game to 25 U-19 youngsters chosen 

 by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) to undergo 

 the training stint.

 He said though the Test team was 

 not showing the same sort of consistency as the one-day 

 team, he still favoured the Indian squad to win both the 

 rubbers.

 Agreed, compared to one-day 

 performance the Test performance has to improve. The consistency 

 shown in one-dayers is missing in Tests. Still we have a 

 balanced side, said the former Test batsman. 

 Viswanath feels that if out-of-form 

 Virender Sehwag gets back into the groove it will be a huge 

 advantage for India. Wasim (Jaffer) has done well 

 as an opener. If Sehwag comes into form it will be a big 

 plus point.

 The middle-order is quite 

 settled and generally it is a balanced side. There are two 

 good spinners and our new ball bowlers are doing well, 

 he said. Basically its a very balanced attack 

 now. Sreesanth is doing well, and is quite aggressive too.

 Munaf has come in now, especially 

 in Test matches. Then theres the allround wicketkeeper 

 (Dhoni). I think we have a chance of winning the series, 

 he said. (PTI)

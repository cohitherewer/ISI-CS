Moscow: Marat Safin and Dmitry Tursunov beat Argentinas David Nalbandian and Agustin Calleri 6-2, 6-3, 6-4 Saturday to put Russia within one victory of their second Davis Cup title. The win put Russia 2-1 up ahead of Sundays reverse singles. 

Russia captain Shamil Tarpishchev brought in Safin to replace Mikhail Youzhny for the doubles a surprise move given Safins disappointment with the synthetic indoor carpet at Olympic Stadium, which he had blamed for his straight-sets loss to Nalbandian in Fridays opening singles. 

Nikolay Davydenko had earlier put Russia ahead by beating Juan Ignacio Chela. 

Serving hard and returning proficiently, Tursunov and Safin conceded only one point in their first-set service games and broke their struggling opponents in the fourth game. Nalbandian and Calleri saved three break points in the sixth game but were broken to love two games later and lost the set. 

Nalbandian opened the fourth game with a double-fault and lost at love to put Russia up 3-1 in the second set, an advantage that the home side never surrendered. The Russians opened the third set with a break and continued to dominate until Tursunov served out the match in 1 hour, 38 minutes. 

We didnt want to stay out there too long and let hem get in the match, said Tursunov, who had eight of Russias 11 aces. 

Marat and I agreed that we would simply play our game and let them make mistakes, and thats what they did throughout the match. 

The loss was a first in doubles this season for Nalbandian. At the beginning we couldnt make any returns, we didnt play many points when they served and they returned well and gained confidence That was tough. 

Nalbandian was drawn to play Davydenko in the first reverse singles on Sunday, while Safin was to face Chela in the second match, although substitutions can be made up to an hour before the match. 

Tarpishchev is becoming known for late substitutions. In the semi-final, he replaced Youzhny with Tursunov, who clinched Russias finals berth by beating Andy Roddick of the US in a near five-hour match. 

Youzhny has said he has fully recovered from the foot injury that prompted his withdrawal from the St. Petersburg Open in late October, but he has not played a competitive match since. I knew from the beginning of the week that I wanted to play all three days, Safin said. I wouldnt have taken no for an answer. 

Former Russian president Boris Yeltsin joined Safin and Tursunov on the court after the match, taking each by the hand and raising their arms in triumph. Soccer great Diego Maradona, part of an enthusiastic Argentine contingent that was subdued by the swift defeat, spoke with Safin on the court in Spanish and praised his play. 

He is a phenomenon. He and Tursunov gave Argentina no chance to break serve today. Everything went well for them, Maradona said.

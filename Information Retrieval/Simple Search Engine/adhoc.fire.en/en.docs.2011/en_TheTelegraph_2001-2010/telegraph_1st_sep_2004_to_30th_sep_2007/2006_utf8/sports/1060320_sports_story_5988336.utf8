Colombo: A superb all round performance by Abdul Razzaq guided Pakistan to a four-wicket victory against Sri Lanka in the second one-day International of the three-match series on Sunday. 

Razzaq starred with the ball in the morning with his medium pace, claiming two for 19, as Sri Lanka were bowled out for a paltry score of 130 in 44.2 overs on a tricky two-paced pitch. 

The 26-year-old then batted uncharacteristically with a cool head to guide Pakistan home after the tourists had slumped to 47 for five, finishing with 41 not out from 101 balls. 

Razzaq was supported in the run chase by Mohammed Yousuf (26), with whom he added 35 in 16 overs, and later with wicketkeeper Kamran Akmal (20 ..) with whom he shared an unbroken seventh-wicket stand worth 52 runs.

 Newcastle renew interest in Henrik Larsson

 - Owen not to be rushed back, declares Souness

Graeme Souness promised last night that Michael Owen would not be rushed back for his broken foot and the Newcastle manager will now consider signing a replacement in the January transfer window, which opened at midnight on Saturday. 

Souness said: Its rest now for Michael and you have to get this type of injury right first time, its like Scott Parker, he was out for the best part of a year, nine months. And he ended up having it pinned I believe, so we will have to wait and see what the surgeon says. 

We had key men out even before Michael was added to the list. There is no doubt that Kieron Dyer and Emre would make us a better passing team. But the loss of Michael is, without taking anything away from any other player, the hardest. He is the last player you would want to get injured. 

You can be on the back foot and he will snatch a goal and show a whole different light on the game. Michael is not best pleased. 

It is understood that one potential target is Henrik Larsson, the former Celtic striker. Newcastle courted Larsson two years ago when former manager Sir Bobby Robson attempted to take him to St James Park when the Swede confirmed he was leaving Celtic Park. 

At the time Robson said: Larsson is someone who could play alongside Alan Shearer ?? Ive no doubt about that. 

Now Souness is expected to monitor the availability of Larsson, 34, who suffered his own problems last season when he spent six months on the sidelines after damaging ligaments against Real Madrid. 

Shearer, who has benefited hugely from Owens return to English football from Real Madrid, is prepared to have to wait for his attacking partner but accepts it could be a long wait. 

Michael doesnt go down easily.. He got up, limped off and at half-time it was very sore, said Shearer. We all know what Michael gives to the team and to lose him for the second half at Tottenham was a big blow. 

Its a big blow for everyone and, in particular, for the club because he will be out for a while. 

Shearer, though, accepted the clash with Paul Robinson was nothing more than an accident. He added: It was just a challenge. Nobody can be blamed for it; it was one of those things. It was just a clash with their goalkeeper. That was it. 

Tord Grip, Sven-Goran Erikssons assistant, was at White Hart Lane to see Owen limp off at half-time and the England coach said: Obviously Im very disappointed for Michael. Its very bad luck for him and for Newcastle United. 

Michael is a fantastic striker and a very important player for his club and for England. I hope he returns to fitness as soon as possible and I will follow his progress very closely.

 Liverpool drawn to play Maccabi Haifa

London: Liverpool were drawn to play Maccabi Haifa of Israel in the third qualifying round of the Champions League on Friday, raising immediate security concerns for the English club. 

Because of the security situation in Israel resulting from the conflict in Lebanon, Uefa has written to the Israeli FA asking for added safety assurances for clubs due to play there. 

The match will definitely not take place in Haifa, which is close to the conflict zone, but may go ahead in Tel Aviv or be moved to a neutral country. The first leg is set for Anfield on August 8 or 9 with Haifa at home in the second on either August 22 or 23. 

AC Milan will face either Cork City of Ireland or former champions Red Star Belgrade if Uefa decides next week that Milan can compete in the competition. They are more likely to play Red Star who hold a 1-0 first-leg lead from the first leg in Ireland but Milans place has not yet been verified by Uefa because of their involvement in the Serie A match-fixing scandal. 

Arsenal are likely to face Dynamo Zagreb of Croatia, who have a 4-1 first-leg led over Ekranas of Lithuania in their second qualifying round tie.

 Slow starts by Kapur, Randhawa

St Andrews: Jyoti Randhawa and Shiv Kapur had a disappointing start at the star-studded euro 5 million Dunhill Links Championship being played at three courses here. 

Shiv Kapur shot a two-over 74 at St Andrews and was lying way behind in tied 127th place. Kapur is playing with Andrew Coltart, who comes to New Delhi later this month for Hero Honda Indian Open. Coltart also shot a 74. 

Randhawa, who has already sealed his European card for 2007, had more problems going six-over 77 at the par-71 Old Course, Carnoustie, which hosts the British Open next year. 

Randhawa has a tough task ahead of him trying to make the cut. Paul Casey shot a brilliant nine-under 63 at Kingsbarns to take the first round lead. He leads by a shot from Johan Edfors and Bradley Dredge. 

The highlight of Caseys round was an eagle two on the 337-yard sixth hole. Casey currently leads the European Tour Order of Merit and could seal the title with a good finish here. 

Edfors, three times winner on the European Tour this year, found a fine round also at Kingsbarns, with an eagle and seven birdies in his round of 64.

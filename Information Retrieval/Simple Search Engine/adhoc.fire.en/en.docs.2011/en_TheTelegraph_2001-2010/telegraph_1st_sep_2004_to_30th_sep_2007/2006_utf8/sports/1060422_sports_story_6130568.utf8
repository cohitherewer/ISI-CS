The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Captain for Mondays meeting 

 - Rahul Dravid lone current international on MCC body 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Rahul Dravid 

 Calcutta: The Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), 

 which continues to frame the laws, has saluted Rahul Dravid 

 by including him on its 15-strong World Cricket Committee. 

 The Team India captain, in fact, is the only one in 

 that distinguished line-up currently doing international 

 duty. 

Constituted last week with Tony Lewis as chairman, the Committee will have its first meeting (at Lords) on Monday. Its going to assist the Laws Working Party, which undertakes reviews. 

That body, which liaises with the International Cricket Council, is headed by outgoing MCC secretary Roger Knight. 

 This Committee isnt 

 a one-off, but is without a fixed term, informed a 

 spokesperson when contacted by The Telegraph on Friday 

 evening. 

Dravid, she said, has confirmed he will be present. 

Barring Mike Gatting, Courtney Walsh, Martin Crowe and David Shepherd, the rest are going to be at Lords, the spokesperson pointed out. 

Except the iconic Barry Richards, Shepherd (most respected umpire in the post-Dickie Bird era) and former Australian allrounder Tony Dodemaide, a one-time MCC head of cricket, everybody else has captained his country. 

Empowered to conduct research, the Committee is expected to support, constructively question or challenge changes at different levels across the globe. 

Mondays meeting will be over two sessions. 

The first may focus exclusively on unfair deliveries. After lunch, discussions could centre around research projects ? specific, perhaps, to technological advances and the biomechanical component. 

 The Committee, incidentally, is going to replace the 

 Laws, Spirit and Ethos sub-committee constituted by the 

 MCC six years ago. 

 THE COMMITTEE

 (alphabetically) 

Michael Atherton, Geoffrey Boycott, Mike Brearley, Martin Crowe, Tony Dodemaide, Rahul Dravid, Andy Flower, Mike Gatting, Majid Khan, Tony Lewis (chairman), Barry Richards, David Shepherd, Alec Stewart, Courtney Walsh, Steve Waugh.

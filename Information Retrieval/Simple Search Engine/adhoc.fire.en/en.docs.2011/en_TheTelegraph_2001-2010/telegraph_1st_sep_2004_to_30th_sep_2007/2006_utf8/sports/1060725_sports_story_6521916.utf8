 Stewards admit mistakes 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: RCTC stewards admitted their mistakes at a stormy EGM on Monday, informed a well-placed source. They failed to defend their financial deals ? of the past and those in the pipeline, including the proposed sale of the D.L. Khan Road property for peanuts to a company in which one of the stewards had a declared interest. That steward, Sujit Bhattacharyya, resigned recently. The property will now be sold after a tender is floated, and scanned by a committee.

 The meeting was heavily attended 

 and the appointment of Brig. Sudhir Johar as general manager, 

 projects, was discussed at length. Every member, however, 

 felt that he being a close relation of the steward who had 

 been at the centre of most controversies, ought to have 

 resigned by now. It was learnt that the final decision about 

 him would be taken soon ? perhaps, to give him a chance 

 to make a graceful exit.

 The payment pattern of the in-office renovation deal was also discussed. The erring officials were given a dressing-down, but no action was taken. However, Gen. Shankar Roychowdhury (retd), a senior steward, refused to comment after coming out of the meeting.

 Kishore Bhimani and Cyrus Madan were co-opted as stewards. Vacancies had followed Bhattacharyyas resignation and the poor health of Deepak Khaitan ? who is undergoing treatment in the UK.

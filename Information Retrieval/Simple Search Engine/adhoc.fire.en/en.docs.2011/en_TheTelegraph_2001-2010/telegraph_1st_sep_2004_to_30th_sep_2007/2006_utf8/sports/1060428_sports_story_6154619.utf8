 Rastogi, Ashutosh advance

 ATP challenger

 Dharwad: Prakash Amritraj 

 and Rohan Bopanna crashed out in both the singles and the 

 doubles section of the $25,000 Dharwad Open ATP Challenger 

 tournament here on Thursday.

 However, Karan Rastogi and Ashutosh 

 Singh kept Indian hopes alive as they reached the last four 

 in doubles, with a 6-4, 3-6, 10-6 win over the Ghanaian-American 

 duo of Henry Adjei-Darko and Nathan Thompson.

 United States Phillip King, 

 a qualifier, came from behind to defeat Amritraj 6-7 (2-7), 

 6-1, 6-1 and book a quarter final berth.

 Amritraj struggled from the beginning 

 but managed to win the first set. However, he lost his rhythm 

 midway and surrendered meekly.

 Victor Troicki of Serbia scored 

 a convincing 6-1, 7-5 win against Bopanna.

 In doubles, the Slovakian pair 

 of Kamil Capkovic and Lukas Lacko overpowered Amritraj and 

 Bopanna with a 4-6, 6-4, 10-8 scoreline to move into the 

 semi-finals.

 Meanwhile, Japans Go Soeda 

 overcame Darko 6-7 (11-13), 6-4, 7-6 (10-8) to advance to 

 the quarter finals, where he was joined by top-seeded Hyung-Taik 

 Lee of Korea, Polands Lukasz Kubot, Uzbek Denis Istomin 

 and Chinese Taipeis Yen-Hsun Lu. (PTI)

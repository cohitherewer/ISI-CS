 Tania in joint lead

Yerevan (Armenia): Woman Grandmaster Tania Sachdev crashed through the defences of Woman International Master Bianca Muhren of Holland to jump into joint lead at the World Junior Girls Chess Championship here. 

Tania now shares the lead with WGM Melia Salome of Georgia and Mongolian Mongontuul Bathuyag on 5.5 points apiece with six rounds remaining. 

WGMs Dronavalli Harika and Eesha Karavade signed peace with Mikadze Miranda of Georgia and Atousa Pourkashian of Iran, respectively. Mary Ann Gomes drew with Iva Videnova of Bulgaria. 

In the boys championship, GM Deepan Chakravarthy came back in the reckoning for top honours with a thumping victory over IM Boris Grachev of Russia. 

Springing an opening surprise, Deepan was always in command in the one-sided affair that started with the Keres attack. Grachev went for a dubious continuation early in the opening and did not have a chance to recover thereafter. 

The victory took Deepan to five points out of a possible seven to move into the fifth spot. (PTI)

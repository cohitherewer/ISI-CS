Calcutta: Coach Shyamal Banerjee sounded confident about Mohun Bagans chances in Bangkok where the colts would face Asian powerhouses such as Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Hong Kong and Philippines in the Nike Under-15 Manchester United Premier Cup tournament. 

The youngsters need such exposures to hone their skills and with the kind of talent at my disposal, I am hopeful of qualifying for the final phase in Manchester, Banerjee said on the eve of the squads departure for Bankok on Wednesday. The meet starts on Saturday.

 Long Whistle

A World Cup is said to be the stage where new stars are born while some are jettisoned into the dustbin of disappointment and defame. This is also an occasion where newer styles, formations and rules come to take on the old ones. The men with the whistles always remain at the centre of this continuous stream of changes . They largely go unnoticed in the theatre of football, silently and sagaciously allowing creativity to survive in the face of destructive and physical play. 

We are again on the threshold of the worlds biggest and most entertaining sporting event. After two years of hard-fought, gruelling qualifying process, the stage is now set to be on fire. Thirty-one teams have qualified from an initial pool of 194 teams . 

The referees role in this mind-blowing drama falls into the category of a good prompter, who ensures it goes on unhindered by any ugly jerks and out-of-place incidents. 

The games world governing body Fifa organised a special course for the XVIIIth World Cup from March 21-25 in Frankfurt where 44 referees were invited. Prior to that, during the preliminary rounds, a trio system was introduced where the referee and his both assistants were picked up from the same country so that they formed a synthesis, had a better understanding and didnt face any language barriers in officiating the match. 

In the Frankfurt conclave, focus had been on the referees physical fitness: They had to undergo a series of gruelling medical and psychological tests, and faced tests of their knowledge about the laws of the game and as well as the language of English. Referees had also been given recordings of matches played by various teams so that they could get familiar with different playing styles and formations. 

Fifa, finally, came up with a list of 23 referees and 46 assistants from different countries for the World Cup. From Asia, only two referees were picked up ? Toru Kamikawa of Japan and Shamsul Maidin of Singapore, though in the last World Cup ? which was jointly hosted by South Korea and Japan ? there were five Asian referees. Unfortunately, Indias solitary representative Komleswaran Shankar of Tamil Nadu failed to pass the Frankfurt test. Another Asian referee, Khalil Al Ghamdi of Saudi Arabia, has been kept as stand-by. 

Four assistant referees will, however, represent Asia in Germany ? Yoshikazu Hiroshima of Japan, Dae Young-kim of South Korea, Prachya Permpanich of Thailand and Eisa Ghuloum of the UAE. In the 2002 edition, there were of 36 referees because of two host countries. 

Of the panel of 23 referees, nine have got the experience of officiating in the last World Cup. Here is an interesting anecdote: Markus Merk of Germany is a dentist, a social worker and involved in charity work in Chennai. 

Of late, a demand for use of technology has been gaining ground to avoid controversial decisions. However, such devices wont be around in Germany. But the referees have been advised to clamp down on time-wasting, elbowing, dangerous tackles and simulation. Players attitude to the match officials will also be under strict observation. 

In 2002, it may be recalled, Claudio Caniggia was asked to leave the bench when he abused the UAE referee Ali Busjaim, but the Argentine player was not shown any card. In Germany, a player, facing such punishment, will therefore run the risk of missing one or two matches. 

Finally, a series of match-fixing scandals, involving referees, has recently rocked the European leagues. But trust me, such episodes of shame wont deface the World Cup stage. After all, the match officials are like priests, who always aim to protect the games sanctum sanctorum with honesty and uprightness.

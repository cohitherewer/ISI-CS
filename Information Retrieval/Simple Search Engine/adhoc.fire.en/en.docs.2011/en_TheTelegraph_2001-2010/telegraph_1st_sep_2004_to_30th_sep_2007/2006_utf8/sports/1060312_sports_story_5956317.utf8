 Atwal misses cut

Palm Beach Gardens: Arjun Atwal struggled on the second day of the USPGA Tours $5.5 million Honda Classic and missed the cut which came at three-over. He finished seven-over. 

For the second day in a row, the Indian ace had a triple bogey seven. It was on the seventh hole on first day and fourth on second. With four more bogeys from 12th to 15th, he shot himself out of reckoning despite two birdies. 

Daniel Chopra played a flawless round with five birdies and an eagle to shoot a seven-under 67 that took him to tied third place. 

Chopra, 42nd, after the first round, went on a birdie spree with four in a row from fifth to eighth, and then added another on the 12th and shot an eagle on 17th to complete an eventful day despite some average putting. 

David Toms moved one shot clear on top after an unusual bogey-eagle-bogey finish. (Agencies)

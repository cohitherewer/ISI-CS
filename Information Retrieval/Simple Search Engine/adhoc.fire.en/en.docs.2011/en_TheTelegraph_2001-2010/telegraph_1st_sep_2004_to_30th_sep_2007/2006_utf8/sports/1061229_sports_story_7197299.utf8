 Amorina reversed form 

 STAR RACER

 Trainer Vijay Singhs Amorina scored a facile win over Silver Print and Star Perfection, on Tuesday, in the Usha Stud Calcutta Oaks. Her victory came when the Vijay Singh-trainee was written off for the next months Derby after Star Perfection enhanced her ratings following her convincing 1000 Guineas win over the Alvarada daughter. Now Star Perfections defeat puts her in a similar position and it may come as a big surprise if she makes the line-up in the January 7 Classic.

 Star Perfection, a Daniel David trainee, looked tucked in the paddock parade. She has had two runs before the Oaks combined with her routine workouts. So did Amorina but she was able to take everything in her stride. After all fillies are difficult to train.

 The three fillies were abreast of each other at the final turn before Amorina (C.Rajendra up) kicked away from Silver Print (Mallesh Narredu) leaving Star Perfection (Donoghue) to struggle behind. To say that Star Perfection failed to stay the 2,400m trip will be injustice done to the Steinbeck-Santorini Star daughter as she inherited stamina from each side of her parentage. She is bound to bounce back to her usual self by the St Leger time. Watch out.

 Vijays Athymia scored a thumping victory while the trainers Mezzano cut a sorry figure in the 1,100m Breeders Cup. Nevertheless, Athymias was a champion-like performance, out-sprinting her rivals from the start.

 Vijays hot-favourite, Mystro, won the 2,000m Scone Stone Handicap. It was, however, far from a convincing victory for the 35-100 favourite as he faced a strong challenge from his stablemate, Clockwork. 

 Age was never a factor for trainer Harvinder Singh Baths eight-year-old, Star Magic, who had a comfortable measure of his much younger rival, Diffidence, in the 1,200m Elusive Pimpernel Cup. Diffidence was, however, trifle unlucky as Donoghue failed to get the horse jump out with the field It wasnt Donog-hues day after all. He had also faltered on Daniels Active Asset in the 1,600m Darbhanga Cup, though the visiting jockey had ample time to beat the Robin Corner-winner, Lebombo, between the final turn and the winning-post.

 Star Magic complemented his trainer for his careful upkeep. So did his other ward, Acrostic, in the T.N.Banerjee Cup which he won from a heavily fancied Kings Charter, a Daniel-trainee. It wasnt Daniels day either. The champion trainer drew a blank on the day.

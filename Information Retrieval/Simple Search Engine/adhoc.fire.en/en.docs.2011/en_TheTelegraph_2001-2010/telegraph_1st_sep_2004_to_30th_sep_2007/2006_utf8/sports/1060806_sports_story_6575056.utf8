 Hari draws, still in lead

Paks (Hungary): World junior champion P. Harikrishnas attempts did not materialise as the top seed was yet again held to a draw in the seventh round by GM Zahar Efimenko of Ukraine in the third Marx Gyorgy International Chess tournament here. 

All the three games ended in draws, leaving the standings intact as they were after the fourth round of this annual event. 

For the records, it was already the third day running without a single decisive game and fourth round overall out of the seven rounds played so far in the category-15 event. The difference in the seventh round was, however, evident as all the games were fought hard. 

Despite the draw, Harirkishna remained in sole lead with 4.5 points to his credit and the way the tournament is progressing, it seems unlikely that anyone will be able to post a challenge to Harikrishna, who is looking for his first tournament victory in this season after a dismal show in the Aerosvit tournament and prior to that in the Chess Olympiad.

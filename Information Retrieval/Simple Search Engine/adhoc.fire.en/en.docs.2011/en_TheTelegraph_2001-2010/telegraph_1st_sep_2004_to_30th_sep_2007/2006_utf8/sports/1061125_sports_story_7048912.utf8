 Hamilton to race for McLaren

London: Briton Lewis Hamilton will race for McLaren next year alongside double world champion Fernando Alonso as Formula Ones first black driver. 

Its a dream come true, said the 21-year-old, whose paternal grandparents came from the West Indies, in a McLaren statement on Friday. 

To be racing in Formula One with McLaren has been the ultimate goal for me since I was very young and this opportunity is a fantastic way to end what has been the best year for me. 

Backed by McLaren for a decade, Hamilton showed dazzling speed and maturity beyond his years in winning at the first attempt this years GP2 championship that acts as a feeder series to Formula One. 

Spaniard Alonso has joined from champions Renault in an all-new line-up for Mercedes-powered McLaren following the departure of Finlands Kimi Raikkonen to Ferrari. 

I have grown up with McLaren and Mercedes and wouldnt be where I am today without their continued support and guidance, continued Hamilton. However, Im aware that this will be a challenge and I know that there will be a lot of attention on me.

 Quyick Takes

 Raul, Fabregas may start against France

 Kamen: Spain captain Raul 

 Gonzalez could return to the starting lineup in Tuesdays 

 match against France. Raul played with the expected starting 

 formation in a training session on Sunday morning at the 

 expense of Liverpools Luis Garcia. In the midfield, 

 Cesc Fabregas replaced Brazilian-born Marcos Senna.

 Luis Garcia conceded he appeared 

 to have lost his spot in the lineup to Raul, but put on 

 a brave face. From the training it seems he (Aragones) 

 plans to start with that team, and I would be left out, 

 he said in Kamen. You cant do anything, just 

 keep working. Right now we have to think like a unit and 

 not individually.

 Ashley wins damages

 London: A British tabloid 

 has agreed to pay damages to England defender Ashley Cole 

 after he was linked to two articles they ran about two footballers 

 indulging in gay sex. We are happy to make clear that 

 Mr Cole and Masterstepz were not involved in any such activities. 

 We apologise to them for any distress caused and we will 

 be paying them each a sum by way of damages, the paper 

 said in an apology.

 flew to Germany but missed his favourite curry dish has 

 asked a restaurant to fly something over. Gary 

 Chambers, a regular diner at the two-month old restaurant

 Raucous welcome

 score a goal in its World Cup debut, but their Caribbean 

 homeland welcomed the Soca Warriors back with a raucous 

 street party. Music blared as the soccer sides fans 

 danced behind slow-moving trucks carrying dozens of massive 

 speakers along Port of Spains main avenue, which was 

 packed with raucous parade-goers decked out in the Warriors 

 red-and-black T-shirts.

 Lagerback wont quit

 Bremen: Sweden coach Lars 

 Lagerback said on Sunday he would not quit after his teams 

 World Cup exit and said media expectations back home had 

 been too high. I havent thought about it at 

 all, Lagerback said when asked about criticism blaming 

 him for the exit. I have a contract until 2008 and 

 have not had any other thoughts.

 Relief for Turkey

 Istanbul: Turkey has welcomed 

 a Fifa decision to halve their punishment for violence at 

 a World Cup qualifier versus Switzerland. Fifa ruled Turkey 

 must play their next three home competitive matches behind 

 closed doors on neutral territory. The original sanction, 

 imposed in February, covered six matches.

 Dream team

 Berlin: Didier Drogba, 

 Tomas Rosicky and Dwight Yorke have more in common than 

 the fact that they all belong to teams which have bowed 

 out at the group stage of World Cup. The trio feature in 

 a dream team of those who left, named by the 

 fifaworldcup.com.

 Radjabov to clash with Karjakin 

 - France Rapid Chess Meet 

Cap Dagde (France): Grandmaster Sergey Karjakin of Ukraine set up a final clash with top seed GM Taimour Radjabov of Azerbaijan in the Cap Dagde Rapid Chess meet. 

Karjakin defeated arch-rival Magnus Carlsen of Norway 1.5-0.5 in the first semi-final of the day, while Radjabov proved too good for Andrei Volokitin of Ukraine, winning 2-0. 

The event that started with 16 players saw Indian GMs Parimarjan Negi and Koneru Humpy eliminated in the prelims, while P. Harikrishna went down to Volokitin in the quarter finals. 

Playing white, Karjakin drew the first game in the Sicilian Sveshnikov by Carlsen and got a similar opening position in the return game in which Carlsens technique was a bit flawed. 

Radjabov was at his best in both games against Volokitin. Playing black in the first game, he also played the Sveshnikov that even the best in the world find hard to crack against him. 

 Volokitin lost a pawn in the endgame and subsequently went down in 65 moves. 

In the return game, Volokitin got no chance in an irregular queen pawn game and went down in just 32 moves.

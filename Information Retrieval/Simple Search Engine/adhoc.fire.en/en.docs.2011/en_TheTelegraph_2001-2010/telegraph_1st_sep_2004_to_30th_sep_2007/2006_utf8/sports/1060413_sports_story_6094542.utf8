 Quick-Take

 History beckons Nelly Viennot

 Berlin: Nelly Viennot 

 of France could become the first female linesman 

 at a World Cup if she passes fitness and skills tests, Fifa 

 officials said on Wednesday. The 44-year-old, who became 

 the first woman to run the line in Frances first division 

 in 1996, is one of 82 candidates for 60 places at the tournament 

 in Germany.

 There is certainly excitement 

 about the possibility she could be the first female referees 

 assistant in the World Cup, said Fifa spokesman Andreas 

 Werz. But we want to underscore the fact that she 

 is not going to be at the workshop because shes a 

 woman... Rather, she is coming because of the fact that 

 she is good enough to be among the best assistants in the 

 world.

 The assistant referees will be 

 tested from April 18-21. 

 Charter of confidence

 Berlin: Confident Brazilian 

 fans have reserved slots for charter flights to Berlin before 

 the World Cup final on July 9, a spokesman for the capitals 

 airports said on Wednesday.

 Eberhard Ilie said travel operators 

 in Brazil had reserved slots at Berlins three airports 

 ? Tegel, Tempelhof and Schoenefeld. 

 The world champions will be bidding 

 for their sixth title. 

 Amateur teams may lose 

 turfs 

 Berlin: Several German 

 amateur soccer teams may have to leave their grounds a month 

 before the end of the season to allow new turf to be laid 

 for the World Cup. Twenty-six of the 32 World Cup finalists 

 picked hotels in Germany near training grounds that are 

 now being used by amateur teams in regional leagues whose 

 season run into late May.

 The (World Cup) teams obviously 

 want to have pitches that are in perfect condition, 

 said Helmut Sandrock, the organising committee official 

 responsible for training venues.

 Six amateur sides may have to 

 reschedule matches after the end of the month, when the 

 venues are inspected, because some grounds may need to be 

 returfed, repaired or simply preserved during May. All training 

 venues have to be ready, and free of any advertising, by 

 May 29. 

 Kalou not amused

 Amsterdam: Ivory Coast-born 

 Salomon Kalou, denied the chance to play for the Netherlands 

 at the World Cup, wants a spoof advert showing him playing 

 for Germany withdrawn. Kalou has launched a court battle 

 for the withdrawal of the advert. In the advert Kalou is 

 announced as part of a German team facing the Dutch in a 

 World Cup final.

 Netherlands coach Marco van Basten 

 had guaranteed Kalou a spot in his World Cup squad if he 

 got a passport in time. The Netherlands immigration minister, 

 however, ruled last month that Kalou did not fulfil the 

 criteria for fast-track citizenship.

 Temptation-freezone for 

 Saudis

 Bad Nauheim (Germany): 

 The pictures of naked women are being removed from the hotels 

 health spa, hard-core porn channels will be switched off 

 and all alcohol will be removed from the mini bars before 

 Saudi Arabia arrives.

 Were following some 

 basic dos and donts. The whole staff 

 is taking cross cultural training sessions to make them 

 aware of the differences of Germany and Saudi Arabia, 

 Michel Prokop, the hotels general manager, said. 

 To avoid all problems, all women staffers are going to wear 

 trousers instead of dresses.

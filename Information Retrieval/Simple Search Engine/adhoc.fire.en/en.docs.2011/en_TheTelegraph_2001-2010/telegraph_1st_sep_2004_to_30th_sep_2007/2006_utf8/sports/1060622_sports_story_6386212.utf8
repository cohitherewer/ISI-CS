 Italy looking for a point against Czech Republic

Duisburg: Italy, who need a point to be sure of a place in the second round of the World Cup, meet familiar and formidable opponents in Group E rivals Czech Republic in Hamburg on Thursday. 

Former European Footballer of the Year Pavel Nedved has won three Italian titles with Juventus and Lazio, while his Czech teammate Marek Jankulovski has had six seasons in Serie A with AC Milan and Udinese. 

The pair are important to their teams counter attacking game, with Nedveds bursts from midfield and long-range shooting feared by Italy captain Fabio Cannavaro. 

Pavel is an annoying player to play against, said Cannavaro, who plays alongside Nedved at Juventus. 

He has great spirit, sets an example to teammates, has real inner-strength and plays with passion. He is a genuine professional and a player to fear, Cannavaro told reporters. 

Italy lead the group on four points with the Czechs, who need a win to be sure of going through, on three points along with Ghana. 

Jankulovski, Nedved and suspended Fiorentina defender Tomas Ujfalusi have been feeding coach Karel Brueckner with information on the Italian players. 

The coach asked the three of us who play in Serie A advice about Marcello Lippis team, and we provided him plenty of it, said Jankulovski. We have a lot to play for and are well aware of the difficulty of the task ahead. 

After six years of playing in Italy I cant deny this game has a special flavour for me, said the Milan wing back. 

Czech striker Jan Koller is injured and his replacement Vratislav Lokvenc is suspended. 

Martin Jiranek or Radoslav Kovac will stand in for Ujfalusi in defence. 

The Czechs plan to wait before deciding whether striker Milan Baros will be fit enough to start against Italy in Thursdays match, coach Karel Brueckner said on Wednesday. 

Baros missed the previous two World Cup games with a foot injury, but has resumed full training, prompting optimism that he might be able to take part against the Italians. 

Italys selection problems are more in midfield where Daniele De Rossi is suspended following his red card in the 1-1 draw with the United States and Simone Perrotta is struggling with a leg injury. 

Lippi may push fullback Gianluca Zambrotta into midfield but must wait for tests on striker Alberto Gilardino who has a sore ankle.

 Sourav not given raw deal: Lillee

Chennai: Dennis Lillee on Saturday said Sourav Ganguly had not been given a raw deal if the Indian cricket administration was indeed looking at the future. 

Lillee, who is here to assess the wards at the MRF Pace Foundation and also to train 13 bowlers, including Simon Jones, a member of the England team that will tour India in March, said: I think as far as Sourav is concerned, it is not for me to say. I do not know the history of it. 

However, I think, sometimes, there are situations in which youve got to look to the future. If the BCCI is looking towards the future, then they see the team without Sourav as a captain and a player and if that is the way it is, you got to move on, he said. 

On instances of intimidating bowling witnessed in the Test series between India and Pakistan, Lillee said he disliked beamers. 

It is dangerous even with the helmet as it can harm a batsman. It could hit on the heart or privates. The bowler has to be told, if it happens too often. In the case of bowlers with extreme pace, it is inevitable and they are not purposely trying to do it. It slips out of the hand. (PTI)

 - Golf Rankings

Asian Order of Merit leader Jeev Milkha Singh, who is also the highest ranked Indian golfer, fell five spots to 149th on the table, while Shiv Kapur slipped two places to 191. 

But the biggest loser was Atwal, who did not make it to the PGA Championship and is now out of the top 200 after losing six notches from 195th. 

Jyoti Randhawa, who will make a return to the Asian Tour at this weeks Brunei Open, held on to 161st spot. 

Daniel Chopra, who finished 41st at the years final major, climbed six spots to 187th on the back of his impressive display. 

Tiger Woods increased the gulf between him and the rest of the golfing world by winning his 12th major championship at Medinah. Phil Mickelson and Jim Furyk made sure that Americans held the top three spots. 

Fijis Vijai Singh, who missed the cut at the PGA Championship and South African Retief Goosen are fourth and fifth, respectively.

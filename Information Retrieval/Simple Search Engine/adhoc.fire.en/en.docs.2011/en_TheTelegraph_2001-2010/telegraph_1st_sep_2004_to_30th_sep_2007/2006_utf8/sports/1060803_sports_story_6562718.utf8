 Houghtons deputy may skip camp

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: Chief national coach Bob Houghton has always advocated the need of a strong support staff in proper functioning of the squad, but he may have to run the show alone for the first few days when the Indian camp opens in Calcutta on Friday. 

While Houghton will arrive in the eastern metropolis on Wednesday night from China, none of his two other assistants are likely to make an appearance before the end of the week. While goalkeepers coach Marcus Pacheco is away in Sri Lanka attending an AFC Instructors course, assistant coach Maurice Afonso is yet to receive a green signal from his employers, Dempo to join the Calcutta camp. 

I am not yet sure when I am going to Calcutta, Afonso told The Telegraph from Goa. May be at the end of the week after receive permission from Dempo. Dempo coach Armando Colaco is also in Sri Lanka at the moment to attend the AFC course and Afonso has been entrusted to run the squad till his return. 

With the Goa Professional League beginning on August 15, Dempo are believed to be not to keen on releasing their assistant coach for national duty. Salgaocar, too, had earlier taken a similar decision when they refused to allow their coach Savio Medeira to travel with the squad during the four-nation meet in Canada. 

AIFF general secretary Alberto Colaco was confident that Afonso would be released by Dempo. 

He will join the team soon. Pacheco, Colaco said, has been allowed by Houghton to join the training a few days later.

 Dravid playing safe on Sourav

Lahore: The question, perhaps, was inevitable. And, the reply was on expected lines. 

Is Sourav Ganguly going to make the XI? asked a Pakistani journalist at a Media conference on Tuesday. Team India captain Rahul Dravid gave the politically correct answer: Everyone in the XVI is fit and available for selection ... Well have a look at the wicket and the conditions before taking a decision... 

There were questions for Sourav, too ? again, on predictable lines. 

Asked whether his role had changed from the last tour (2003-04), when he was the captain, Sourav responded: I wanted to perform and wanted the team to do well, then, and its no different this time ... It hasnt changed... 

To another question, on whether he had a problem adjusting to a changed scenario and staying motivated, Sourav replied: Captain or not, playing for the country remains the biggest motivation ... Captaincy is a bonus and a captain is only successful if everybody performs... 

Having been cornered after a terrific run as Team India captain, Sourav doesnt want to fall out of line. He hasnt spelt it out to The Telegraph, but his body language has been conveying that.

Irving (Texas): Arjun Atwal missed the cut by one despite three successive birdies on the last three holes in the second round of the $6.2 million Eds Byron Nelson Tournament. 

Atwal shot a one-under 69 at Cottonwood Valley Golf Course and with his first round 73, he ended at two-over 142 and one outside the cut line. 

Also missing the cut was Daniel Chopra, who shot a second round of 68 and totalled 144, three outside the cut line.

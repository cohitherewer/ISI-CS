 Montoya affair gets a fresh twist

Magny-Cours: Colombian Juan Pablo Montoya could race again in Formula One this season and will not be allowed to compete in Nascar until his McLaren contract ends, team boss Ron Dennis said on Friday. 

Juan Pablo is fully contracted through to the end of the year, he told a French Grand Prix news conference. And if we so choose, he will test and race again. That is our option, nobody elses. 

Dennis added that the chance of Montoya coming back was more than possible. 

Montoya announced last Sunday that he was moving to the US stock car series next year and has made clear that he considers his F1 career to be finished. 

McLaren have drafted in Spanish test driver Pedro de la Rosa to replace Montoya for Sundays race, the 11th of the 18 round championship. 

While Dennis said the hot-tempered driver would not be allowed to race or test in NASCAR this year, he hinted at a likely financial settlement. 

Hes a contracted McLaren driver and will stay that way until the end of his contract, unless there is some other commercial arrangement between ourselves and the Nascar team or Juan himself, he said. 

Theres a conflict of sponsors, theres advertising campaigns, there is a whole raft of reasons why that (testing or racing in NASCAR this year) is not a practical proposition, added the team boss.

 Kuheli finishes 54th

 World Shooting

 Zagreb: Kuheli Ganguly 

 finished 54th in the womens rifle 3 position with 

 a score of 518 in womens 50m rifle prone. She shot 

 a series of 95, 97, 94, 99, 98, 98.

 Olga Dovgun of Kazakhstan fired 

 a world record equalling superb 597 to win the gold and 

 Hanne Skarpodde of Norway, who was just a point adrift, 

 clinched the silver after a series of 99, 100, 99, 100, 

 98, 100.

 Meanwhile, gold rush for Indians 

 continued, albeit off the ranges, as the International Shooting 

 Federation honoured the National Rifle Association of Indias 

 (NRAIs) senior vice-president Avtar Singh and awarded 

 him a gold medal for his meritorious services to the sport.

 Singh was presented the medal 

 at the ISSFs general assembly meeting held on the 

 sidelines of the ongoing World Championships here. (PTI)

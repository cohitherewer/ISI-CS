The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Thomsons yes to Chappell request

 - Legendary fast bowler to have a word with Team India quicks 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Kuala Lumpur: Jeff 

 Thomson has said yes to a request from Greg 

 Chappell, under whom he played 26 of his 51 Tests, that 

 he have a word with the Team India quicks. Hes 

 here as a member of the TV commentary team for the tri-series.

 I dont push myself... 

 Dont try and offer unsolicited advice, but Im 

 there to help anybody who approaches me... I feel good doing 

 that, Thomson, perhaps the fastest-ever, told The 

 Telegraph on Thursday. 

Coach Chappell made the request when Thomson, now 56, went to the Indians warm-up area prior to their match against the West Indies. Oh, I wanted to have a closer look at the newer players... Thats when Greg spoke to me... 

While the date hasnt been fixed, Thomsons session with the Munaf Patels could take place after Saturdays game versus Australia, when there will be a few off days. I guess Im going to talk about mental toughness and so on, he remarked. 

Thomson, incidentally, is a much-in-demand after-dinner speaker. At that time of the day, people want to be entertained... Thats what I do... Ive been doing it for years... He didnt entertain the batsmen, though. 

 While Thomson picked up exactly 200 wickets in Tests, 

 he had 55 from 50 ODIs.

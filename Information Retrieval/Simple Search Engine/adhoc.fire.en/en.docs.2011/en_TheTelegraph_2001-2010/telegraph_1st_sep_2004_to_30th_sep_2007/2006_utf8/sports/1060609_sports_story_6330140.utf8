Koenigstein: Ronaldo missed training with world champions Brazil on Thursday afternoon due to a fever, the Brazilian football confederation said. 

Ronaldo woke up with a slight fever, he is being treated, said the CBF in a statement on its official website. 

This is just a small anecdote to the long list of injuries plaguing the teams ahead of their World Cup openers. 

Czech Republic midfielder Pavel Nedved limped off the training ground on Thursday, but coach Karel Brueckner played down the injury. 

Meanwhile, Fifa have told Switzerland they can drop injured striker Johan Vonlanthen from their squad despite the players own claims that he is on the mend. 

Vonlanthen partially tore his left hamstring during a training session on May 22, prompting Switzerland coach Koebi Kuhn to recall midfielder Hakan Yakin from his holidays. 

In another development, Mexicos first-choice keeper Oswaldo Sanchez has returned home from the World Cup after the death of his father who was due to watch him play in the finals. 

Wayne Rooney, meanwhile, has got over his foot injury and will play at the World Cup when the striker and Sven-Goran Eriksson decide he is ready, the England manager said on Thursday. 

 Italy defender Alessandro Nesta could also recover 

 in time for the Azzurris opening match on Monday.

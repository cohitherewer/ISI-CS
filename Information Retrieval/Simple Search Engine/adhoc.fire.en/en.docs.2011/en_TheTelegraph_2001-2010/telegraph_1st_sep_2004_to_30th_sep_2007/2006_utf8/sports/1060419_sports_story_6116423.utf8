 Kaiser takes wraps off golden ball

Berlin: World Cup organising committee president Franz Beckenbauer removed a golden wrap off a 2.2-metre diameter ball with help from gold-painted Greek warriors during a bizarre ceremony at Berlins Brandenburg Gate on Tuesday. A golden ball will be used at the World Cup final on July 9. 

It only surprises me that no one thought of it before, said Beckenbauer said. The final is such a special occasion for the players, the coaches and the fans around the world. Creating a special ball for this match, the most important match every four years, was a great idea. 

Adidas chairman Herbert Hainer said the golden ball would be identical to those used throughout the month-long tournament in Germany except six of the 14 panels would be coloured gold. We would definitely like to see this as the start of a new tradition for the final match, he said. Well do this again but try to come up with something special for each final. 

Beckenbauer, meanwhile, lashed out at Fifa on Tuesday for its criticism of World Cup organisers and said Germany was ready to host the month-long tournament. 

Fifa has words of criticism for the organising committee over and over again, said Beckenbauer, the president of the organising Committee. Theyre completely superfluous.

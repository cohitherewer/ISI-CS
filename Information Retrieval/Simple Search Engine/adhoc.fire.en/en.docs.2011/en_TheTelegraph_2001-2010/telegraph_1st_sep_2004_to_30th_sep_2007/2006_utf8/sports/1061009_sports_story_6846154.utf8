 Windies off the blocks in style

 Chris Gayle took 3/3

Ahmedabad: The West Indies, defending champions, handed cricketing lessons to Zimbabwe as they recorded an emphatic nine-wicket victory and launched their bid for a place in the main draw of the ICC Champions Trophy here on Sunday. 

After bundling out Zimbabwe for a paltry 85, the lowest team total in the shorter version of the game at the Motera ground, the Caribbean islanders cruised home in just 14.2 overs. 

Nothing seemed to go right for Zimbabwe during the qualifying match, as they put up a shoddy batting display and followed it up with an equally ordinary bowling performance. Worse, the butter-fingered fielders dropped the rampaging Chris Gayle twice in quick succession. 

Gayle, who had emerged the most successful of West Indies bowlers with highly impressive figures of 3.1-1-3-3, seemed determined to end the game in a flash as he let loose an array of scintillating shots on way to scoring 41 to bag the Man of the Match award. 

The left-handed opener played 34 balls and hit seven fours and a six off Anthony Ireland during his 47-minute stay in the middle before perishing in the tenth over. 

The game was over even before the scheduled dinner break as the Caribbeans raced to 90 for two in only 65 minutes in what could be regarded as one of the most one-sided matches in the history of ODIs. 

West Indies captain Brian Lara (24 not out) ended the match with a bang, hoisting his Zimbabwean counterpart Prosper Utseya for two back-to-back sixes over long on, drawing huge cheers from the couple of thousands of spectators. 

The Zimbabweans, however, could have got rid of Gayle a little earlier. Rainsford was the unlucky bowler on two occasions, as Utseya and Ireland dropped easy catches. 

Shivnarine Chanderpaul, who opened the innings with Gayle, remained mostly a witness to the heroics at the other end and was unconquered on 14. 

Earlier, Zimbabwe gave a listless batting display. 

The innings tottered from the start after young captain Utseya won the toss and elected to bat before a small Sunday crowd.

 Inzy sympathy for duo

Karachi: Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Asif, who were banned for positive dope tests, have a sympathiser in their captain Inzamam-ul Haq who said the duo would be missed by the team. 

Being suspended myself, I can very well understand what they are going through, said Inzamam, who missed the Champions Trophy to serve a four-match ODI ban for bringing the game into disrepute during the Oval Test. 

The two are our pace spearheads. The team will miss their wicket-taking ability. 

Shoaib was banned for two years and Asif for one year after they were found guilty of a doping offence by a Pakistan Cricket Board drug tribunal in Lahore on Wednesday.

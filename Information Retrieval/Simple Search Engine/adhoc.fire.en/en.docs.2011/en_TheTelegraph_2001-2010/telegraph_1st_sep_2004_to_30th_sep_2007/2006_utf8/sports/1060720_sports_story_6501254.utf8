 Sania moves into Round II

 - CINCINNATI OPEN 

 - Serena returns in style with win over Myskina 

 Sania Mirza 

Mason (Ohio): Sania Mirza moved into the second round of the $175,000 WTA Cincinnati Open after her opponent retired during the second set on Tuesday. 

The ninth seeded Indian won the first set 6-1 and was leading 2-0 in the second when Alexandra Stevenson of the US retired. 

Serena Williams won her first competitive match in six months, beating Anastasia Myskina 6-2, 6-2. I felt really relaxed, she said. I havent felt this way in a long time. 

Serena, who has been bothered by a chronic left knee injury, chose the Tier III event for her first match since losing in the third round of the Australian Open. 

I almost could have played Wimbledon... I was about 60 or 70 per cent (fit) then... But I probably would have had an embarrassing loss, she said. 

Serena said she was mentally refreshed, but felt a bit rusty. I could have returned better. I made a few easy errors I shouldnt have made, she said. 

While Serena was on hiatus, Myskina had played regularly and well, going 14-4 in her previous 18 matches, including four wins at Wimbledon. But she was no match for Serena, whose only tentative move was her first serve, clocked at 97 mph (157 kph). 

She soon cranked it up to the 120-plus mph range. I was surprised myself, because I wasnt serving that well in practice, she said. 

Serena had beaten Myskina in all four previous matches. The Russian, ranked 11th in the world, was the tournaments No. 2 seed behind defending champion Patty Schnyder. 

She hadnt played in six months, so I didnt know what to expect, Myskina said. Her serve was pretty good. I knew I was going to have to keep winning my serve if I was going to stay in the game. 

The American, ranked No. 1 in the world for 57 weeks in 2002 and 2003, began the tournament ranked No. 139 because of her inactivity. Its devastating, she said. But I have no pressure on me. I have nowhere to go but up. 

In an earlier match, fifth-seeded Jelena Jankovic advanced to the second round with a 6-3, 6-2 win over Ukrainian Olga Savchuk. 

In other matches, fourth-seeded Katarina Srebotnik beat Paraguayan qualifier Rossana De Los Rios 6-3, 7-6 (3); sixth-seeded Marion Bartoli eliminated Chinese Taipeis qualifier Chan Chin-wei 6-2, 6-3; eighth-seeded Gisela Dulko defeated Polands Marta Domachowska 7-5, 6-3; Chinas Yuan Meng ousted Argentinas Mariana Diaz-Oliva 6-3, 7-5; and Italys Maria Elena Camerin cruised past American qualifier Carly Gullickson 6-1, 6-1. 

Abigail Spears beat Alexa Glatch 6-3, 5-7, 6-4 in an all-American clash, while Uzbekistans Varvara Lepchenko defeated South African Natalie Grandin 4-6, 6-1, 6-3.

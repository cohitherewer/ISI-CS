San Diego: Indias Sania Mirza edged out 15th seed Katarina Srebotnik 6-3, 7-6 (7-4) to slip into the third round of the $1.3-million WTA Acura Classic in San Diego on Wednesday. 

The 19-year old overcame a late fight-back from her Slovenian opponent to set up a match with her Wimbledon conqueror, Elena Dementieva. Sania lost in the first round there. The Hyderabadi girl, who has struggled this season, has now gone past the second round in two of the last three tournaments. She is already guaranteed $13,285 and 42 WTA points. 

Fourth seed Dementieva was erratic, making as many as four double faults in the first set, but managed to see off Ashley Harkleroad of the US 6-2, 6-2. 

In another second round match, defending champion Mary Pierce won her first match after a six-month layoff for right foot injuries, holding off Sybille Bammer 6-1, 6-7 (7-9), 7-6 (7-4) second round on Wednesday. 

The sixth seed squandered three match points in dropping the second-set tie-breaker before finally taking control late in the third-set tie-breaker. 

Top-seeded Kim Clijsters had no trouble in advancing to the third round with a 6-1, 6-2 win over Samantha Stosur. She broke the Australians serve all four times in the first set. 

Clijsters has won 41 of her last 42 matches on North American hardcourts, including Sundays victory at the Bank of the West Classic in Stanford. 

Pierce, playing after a first-round bye, looked as if she hadnt missed any time when she easily won the first set against her Austrian opponent. But Bammer, ranked 46th, rallied to force a second-set tie-breaker. Pierce took a 6-4 lead in the tiebreaker and held two match points. But the Frenchwoman made two unforced errors with her forehand to tie the match at 6-all. 

At 7-6, Pierce held her third match point, but Bammer hit a forehand winner before winning the set by taking the final two points on Pierce errors. 

Bammer was ahead 5-3 in the final set before Pierce held serve and Bammer scored just one point on her next service game to tie the match at 5-all. 

Bammer held serve to force the tie-breaker and took a 4-3 lead before Pierce hit two winners to go ahead 5-4. Bammer then made two straight errors, including a backhand into the net to give Pierce the victory. 

Third-seeded Nadia Petrova was upset by fellow Russian Anna Chakvetadze 3-6, 7-6 (7-5), 2-6 in their first meeting. Petrova was playing her first match since she aggravated a right hip injury in the first round of the French Open. She failed to break Chakvetadze, who hit 12 aces.

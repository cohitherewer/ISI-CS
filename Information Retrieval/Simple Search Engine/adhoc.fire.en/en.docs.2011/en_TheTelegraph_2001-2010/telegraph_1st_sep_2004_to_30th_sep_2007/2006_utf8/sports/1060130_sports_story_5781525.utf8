Perth: Adam Gilchrist returned to his swashbuckling best with his 13th one-day century to guide Australia to a six-wicket victory over Sri Lanka in their tri-series match in Perth on Sunday. 

Gilchrist smashed 116 and combined with Simon Katich (82) in a 191-run opening partnership to ensure Australia passed Sri Lankas 233 for eight with nine overs to spare. 

Damien Martyn (13 not out) and Michael Clarke (nine not out), however, failed to give Australia the bonus point because they scored the winning runs in their total of 237 after the end of the 40th over. 

The victory virtually guaranteed Australia a place in the series finals. They have 18 points, while Sri Lanka have nine and South Africa have eight. 

Gilchrist, captaining the side in the absence of the rested Ricky Ponting, destroyed the Sri Lankan attack with 11 boundaries and four sixes off 105 balls on his home ground.

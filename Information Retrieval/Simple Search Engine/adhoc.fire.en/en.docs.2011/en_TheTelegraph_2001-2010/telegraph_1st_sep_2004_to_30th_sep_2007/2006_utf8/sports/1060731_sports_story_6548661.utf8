The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Mohun Bagan kick off 3-way title race today

 - All eyes will be on rejuvenated Mohammedan Sporting 

A STAFF REPORTER 

 Bhowmick 

Calcutta: From Fabio Cannavaro lifting the World Cup to Bhaichung Bhutia amp; Co. taking the field at the Mohun Bagan ground on Monday, its time to localise all the emotions, thrills and frills the games biggest extravaganza had provided for a month in Germany. Lets get ready for the battle, here at the Maidan. 

On paper, the second edition of the CFL Premier Division kicked off 12 days after the July 9 final in Berlin, with Eastern Railways 1-0 win over Railway FC and the goalless tie between George Telegraph and Calcutta Port Trust. 

But the real thing is starting on Monday, when Mohun Bagan take on Calcutta Port Trust ? thereby setting in motion a three-way, and mind it, not a two-way, title-race. The charm of this years local league is ingrained there: Its not going to be a preordained battle between Mohun Bagan and East Bengal. Mohammedan Sporting have emerged as a strong contender in the true sense of the term. 

And how dramatic and dynamic Mohammedan Sportings sudden thrust in building up a formidable side was! A change in club administration, then roping in Subhas Bhowmick as coach and finally, snatching players from East Bengal and Mohun Bagan a la 80s and 90s. Mohammedan Sporting are going to be the surprise package in every way in the national perspective as well.

Being tipped as a team to beat is not only good for our fans, who have so long been deprived of any major title, but it will kind of ignite the title-race in the league, said a senior club official. 

Former India left-back and Bengal coach Aloke Mukherjee echoed the same feeling. The Big Two teams cant now take anything for granted. Thanks to Mohammedan Sporting, the excitement of this league will be different, he said. 

Bhowmick had quit the East Bengal post following his arrest on bribery charges, but surprised all and sundry by accepting Mohammedan Sportings job. His association with the club sparked off an exodus of players from East Bengal and Mohun Bagan to Mohammedan Sporting. 

Even Douglas da Silva ? who had left for Brazil last year with an injury after helping East Bengal win back-to-back National League titles ? has been passed fit to wear the black-and-white jersey under his former coach. 

Bhowmicks challenge is easily understandable. After serving the Maidan as player and coach for so many years, I dont feel any pressure now. But yes, every new job is a challenge and Ill try to the best of my abilities to help this team deliver the goods, he said. 

Following a season sans a major trophy, East Bengal also aim to bounce back. Their first foreign coach Philippe de Ridder of Belgium was replaced by another foreigner ? Carlos Roberto Pereira da Silva of Brazil. Bhaichung has left them, but by offering the captains arm-band to Alvito DCunha, the club has made it clear that they are looking forward towards a new beginning with a bit of Brazilian touch at hand. 

Results cannot be achieved overnight. If we work hard the results will come automatically. In the next three-four months, Ill get to know who are the players best suited to my strategy, the Brazilian said the other day.

For Biswajit Bhattacharya, the role has changed from saviour to the challenger. Having helped Mohun Bagan save relegation from NFL last season, hes now looking forward to the new challenge in a completely different perspective. 

No doubt, Ive got a brilliant side. So the level of expectation is very high. Im yet to get my full squad, but still I know I need to deliver the goods with this team, otherwise?, he told reporters after a practice session at the Howrah Stadium on Sunday. 

Tomba Singh, Dharamjit Singh and Mehtab Hussain are out with injuries while Jose Ramirez Barreto and Eduardo Coelho are yet to join. 

Bhaichung, on the other hand, stressed on having a rotation policy in place. He didnt play the IFA Shield and CFL Premier Division for East Bengal. Its not a bad idea. The squad should be rotated to avoid injury in a long season, he said, admitting hes yet to gain 100 per cent fitness.

 Lara says sorry to WICB

Port of Spain: Temperamental batting genius Brian Lara has made a grand climb-down, apologising to the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) for his public outburst following the Test series loss to India last month. 

Lara is set to remain as West Indies captain after issuing a public apology for an outburst against the selectors and pitch conditions after losing the final home Test against India last month. 

Lara, who made scathing remarks about team selection and pitch conditions at the end of the series-deciding fourth Test at Kingston, admitted he might have over-reacted to the situation. 

I recognise that I broke the confidence placed in me as West Indies captain by my overreaction during and after the fourth Test against India and I apologise to all concerned, Lara wrote in a letter dated July 31 to WICB president Ken Gordon, a daily reported on Thursday.

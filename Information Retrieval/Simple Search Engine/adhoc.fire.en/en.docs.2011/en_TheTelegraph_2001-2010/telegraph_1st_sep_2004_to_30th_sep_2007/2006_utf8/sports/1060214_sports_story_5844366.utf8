 Guccione takes Aussies past Swiss

London: Australian newcomer Chris Guccione steered his country to a 3-2 victory over Switzerland in their Davis Cup World Group first round tie on Sunday. 

The 20-year-old defeated George Bastl in the fifth rubber to put the 28-time champions into the quarter finals. 

Australia host Belarus in the last eight after they pulled off a shock 4-1 win over 2004 winners Spain in Minsk. 

Belarus, along with holders Croatia, Argentina, Chile, France and Russia, had made sure of their progress after Saturdays doubles rubbers. 

The US joined them on Sunday when Andy Roddick eased past replacement Razvan Sabau to give his side a winning 3-1 lead over Romania in San Diego. Former world No.1 Roddick won 6-3, 6-3, 6-2 against the world No.112. 

The US will next host Chile, who have an unassailable 3-0 lead over last years finalists Slovakia at Rancagua. 

 Guccione defeated Bastl 7-5, 6-3, 7-6 after Stanislas Wawrinka had kept the hosts, minus world No.1 Roger Federer, in the running with a win over Peter Luczak to level the score at 2-2. Holders Croatia lost the final two dead singles rubbers against Austria for a 3-2 win in Graz. 

The other quarter final will be between France and the country that beat them in the 2002 final, Russia. 

Russia defeated The Netherlands 5-0 and France got the better of Germany 3-2 after the home side salvaged some pride by winning the dead singles rubbers on Sunday. 

French team captain Guy Forget opted to rest Sebastien Grosjean and Richard Gasquet for the reverse singles, but Arnaud Clement and Michael Llodra were unable to repeat their doubles success losing to Rainer Schuettler and Tommy Haas, respectively. (REUTERS)

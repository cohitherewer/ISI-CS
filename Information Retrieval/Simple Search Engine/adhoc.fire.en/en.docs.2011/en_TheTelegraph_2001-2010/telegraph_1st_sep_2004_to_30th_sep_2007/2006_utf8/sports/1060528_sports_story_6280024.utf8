 Rastogi wins maiden title

 ITF Futures Meet

 New Delhi: Karan Rastogi 

 overcame mental fatigue and stifling weather conditions 

 to clinch his maiden $15,000 ITF Futures mens title 

 at the DLTA Complex here on Saturday. The 19-year old Indian, 

 who had beaten a few top-150 players this season, was nowhere 

 near his best but dug his heels in and clinched a 2-6, 6-2, 

 6-1 win over fourth-seeded American Nick Monroe in two hours.

 He (Monroe) started off 

 well but my serve got better and better as the match progressed, 

 said Rastogi after bagging 18 ATP points and a winners 

 cheque of $1950. The two met last time on clay in Bangalore 

 in March last year when the Indian emerged triumphant. 

 He is a much improved player 

 since then. I got to know his game as the match wore on 

 and accordingly adjusted my game, the third seed said. 

 After being blown away in the first set, Rastogi hit back 

 in the second set. He opened the set with an ace and a crosscourt 

 backhand pass on the run gave him an early break in the 

 second game. 

 The home favourite, however, handed 

 back the advantage by committing a double fault and a few 

 unforced errors in the very next game. But he wrested back 

 the initiative in the following game and broke once again 

 in the eighth game to take the set. Monroe was beginning 

 to tire by now while playing in hot and humid conditions 

 through the week.

 I had a long match yesterday 

 and by the third set I did not have my legs. He did well 

 to take advantage of that, said Monroe who had won 

 titles in Nigeria and Costa Rica before. Rastogi converted 

 the third breakpoint in the fourth game to go 3-1 up in 

 the decider.

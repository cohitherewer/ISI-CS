 Jerez: Italy?s Loris Capirossi held off a determined challenge from debutant Dani Pedrosa to claim a flag-to-flag victory on his Ducati in the season-opening Spanish MotoGP race in Spain on Sunday.

 World champion Valentino Rossi, bidding for a sixth consecutive win in the premier class, finished way back in 14th place after being knocked off his Yamaha on the opening corner by Spain?s Toni Elias.

 It was the first time in six seasons that the 27-year-old Italian has not won the opening race of the championship. Capirossi, who started the race on pole position after setting a new lap record in Saturday?s qualifying, led into the first bend and rode a near-perfect race as he held off 20-year-old Pedrosa for a perfect start to the season. Pedrosa?s Honda teammate Nicky Hayden of the US crossed the line in third and Elias finished in fourth.

 Salou: World champion Sebastien Loeb won the Catalunya Rally for the second year in a row on Sunday to forge nine points clear of Marcus Gronholm in the title standings.

 The Frenchman, driving a Citroen for Kronos Racing after the withdrawal of the manufacturer?s works team last year, finished the final stage 48.2 seconds ahead of Spanish teammate Dani Sordo.

 Second place, in front of his home crowd, was Sordo?s first world championship podium. Finland?s Gronholm, leader on Friday until he suffered turbo boost problems, completed a spirited fightback from 10th place on Saturday morning to take the final spot on the podium for Ford, 57.6 seconds behind Sordo.

 Calgary: American Kimmie Meissner completed a meteoric rise to the top with a shock win at the World Figure Skating Championships on Saturday, while Sasha Cohen let another golden opportunity slip through her fingers. The 16-year-old American confirmed her status as the rising star in women?s figure skating with a spotless free skate that earned her top marks and a personal best overall winning score of 218.33. Japan?s Fumie Suguri, fourth at the Olympics and twice a world championship bronze medallist, took the silver with 209.74 while Cohen settled for the bronze on 208.88.

 Beijing: China has five tennis players in the top 100 the WTA Tour rankings list for the first time, indicating the rapid rise of the Asian sporting giants in women?s tennis.

 Nineteen-year-old Yuan Meng, who has never been included in the national team, became the latest Chinese player to break into the elite list. The teenager joined Li Na (60th spot), Peng Shuai (62), Zheng Jie (65) and Yan Zi (76).

 Li Ting and Sun Tiantian made history by winning China?s first Olympic gold in women?s doubles in Athens before Zheng Jie and Yan Zi captured the country?s first Grand Slam title in Melbourne.

 Bucharest: Police in the Black Sea port of Constanta arrested 50 Dinamo Bucharest fans and fined 19 for violent behaviour before and during the match against Farul on Saturday night.

 About 500 supporters of league leaders Dinamo clashed with police on the streets surrounding the ground before the game and were evacuated from the stands half an hour into the match as violence continued.

 ?Riot police detained both Dinamo and Farul fans and fined them between 200 and 1,500 lei ($70-$500) after violent behaviour before and during the match,? police major Sorin Mustatea said from Constanta.

 Dinamo won 1-0 to increase to five points their 

 lead over Steaua Bucharest who are at home to third placed 

 Politehnica Timisoara later on Sunday.

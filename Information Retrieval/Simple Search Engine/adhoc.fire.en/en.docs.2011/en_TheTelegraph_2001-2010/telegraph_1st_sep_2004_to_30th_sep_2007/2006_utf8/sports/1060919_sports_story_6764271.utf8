 - Watching McGrath was an education: Munaf 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Kuala Lumpur: The Indians havent set the Kinrara Oval on fire, but they remain the hottest attraction in the Malaysian capital. Saturdays match against Australia drew a capacity crowd and, on Monday, every expat Indian seemed to turn up at the elite Royal Selangor Club to watch the Rahul Dravids at nets. 

Autographs, photographs (via camera phones and digital cameras)... The expats wouldnt let go and the cricketers must have realised, one more time, just what their presence and performance hold for the Indians whove settled overseas. 

No surprise that Sachin Tendulkar was the top draw and the talismanic senior-most pro didnt disappoint. His patience, even off the field, is remarkable. Later, Sachin led a small contingent (Harbhajan Singh, Ajit Agarkar, Mohammed Kaif, Yuvraj Singh and Mahendra Singh Dhoni) to the Global Indian International School for a brief interaction with pupils. 

Former India captain and chief selector Chandu Borde is a trustee and it was on his request that Sachin and the rest went. Im touched that six of our players found the time to meet the students... It will remain a big day for the school, he told The Telegraph. 

Meanwhile, the rapidly-improving Munaf Patel is intent on further improving his line and length. Im looking at bowling more dot balls (in the ODIs) and thats going to come about with better line and length... Im satisfied with the way I bowled in the first two matches, but definitely want to do better... 

Munaf, who made his India debut earlier this year, added that watching Glenn McGrath was an education and hed spoken to him for a short while. Main aur baat karunga... All the bowlers will be talking to him here... McGrath doesnt have speed, but a good line and length is his weapon. 

Asked whether success had changed him, somebody with roots in a Gujarat village, Munaf smiled and replied: Nahin, meri life waisi hi hai... Teammates Ramesh Powar and Suresh Raina, incidentally, came over to the Media conference area when he was taking questions. 

Its rare for the 23-year-old to occupy the chair at such interactions. 

Footnote: One of the umpires officiating in the ongoing tri-series is unhappy with Rudra Pratap Singhs tendency to run on to the danger area and may have a one-on-one with coach Greg Chappell before Indias next match, on Wednesday.

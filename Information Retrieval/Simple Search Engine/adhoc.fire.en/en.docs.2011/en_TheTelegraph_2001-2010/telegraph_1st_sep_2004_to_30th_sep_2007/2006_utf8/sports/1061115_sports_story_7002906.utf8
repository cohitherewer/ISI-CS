The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Squad to be picked today

A STAFF REPORTER

 Ranji tie vs Punjab 

Calcutta: The CAB senior selection committee failed to decide on the squad for the opening match against Punjab on Tuesday and deferred it by a day. The reason behind the postponement is Shib Shankar Pauls fitness test, which will be conducted by Andrew Leipus on Wednesday. 

If Paul fails to pass the fitness test, youngster Eklakh Ahmed will get the nod in the 14-member squad. It is learnt that either Safi Ahmed or Amitava Chakraborty will be selected. 

Sourav Ganguly will be offered to lead the side. In case he declines, Deep Dasgupta will be in charge. 

The match is from November 23 in Mohali. 

The Likely XIV: Sourav Ganguly (captain), Deep Dasgupta, Rohan Gavaskar, Arindam Das, Subhamoy Das, Avishek Jhunjhunwala, Laxmi Ratan Shukla, Manoj Tiwari, Sourashish Lahiri, Shiv Sagar Singh, Ranadeb Bose, Ashok Dinda, Eklakh Ahmed, Amitava Chakraborty/Safi Ahmed. Coach: Paras Mhambrey.

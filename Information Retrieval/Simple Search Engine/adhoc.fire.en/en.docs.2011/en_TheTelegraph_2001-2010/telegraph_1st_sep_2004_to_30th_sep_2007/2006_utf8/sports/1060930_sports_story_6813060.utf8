The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 No captains meet during Champions 

 - All shortlisted for ICC awards may not be present at Mumbai function 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Calcutta: All ten Test-playing nations will be in India for the Champions Trophy, though only eight are going to feature in the tournament proper, but an International Cricket Council (ICC)-hosted captains conclave isnt on the cards. 

That, of course, has been an annual feature for some years. The last was held in the lead-up to the first-ever officially sanctioned Super Test in Sydney 13 months ago. The next may now be before the 2007 World Cup. 

Because of the logistics involved and the fact that the teams are arriving in batches, all the captains wont be at one place at the same time... A conclave, therefore, wont be possible, ICC spokesman Bryan Murgatroyd told The Telegraph. 

According to the spokesman, who was contacted on Friday evening, ICCs general manager (cricket) Dave Richardson is expected to meet the captains individually and get their views on a range of issues. The Champions Trophy matches are being hosted by Ahmedabad, Jaipur, Mohali and Mumbai. 

While the qualifiers begin on October 7, the tournament proper will start with the India-England face-off in Jaipur on October 15. 

Meanwhile, as edition No.3 of the ICCs annual awards is going to be held in the middle of the Champions Trophy in Mumbai, on October 23 theres a possibility that all those shortlisted wont be around that day. The top reason being the South Africa versus Qualifier 1 (in all probability either Sri Lanka or the West Indies) match in Ahmedabad the next day. 

The function wont affect the West Indies, as just Test keeper Denesh Ramdin is in the shortlist. However, as many as four Sri Lankans (Mahela Jayawardene, Muttiah Muralidharan, Kumar Sangakkara and Malinga Bandara) picked for the tournament are in the race for the four mens player awards. Two South Africans, too Herschelle Gibbs and Makhaya Ntini. 

Murgatroyd, who was boarding a flight from London for New Delhi, explained there had been practical difficulties in finalising another date.

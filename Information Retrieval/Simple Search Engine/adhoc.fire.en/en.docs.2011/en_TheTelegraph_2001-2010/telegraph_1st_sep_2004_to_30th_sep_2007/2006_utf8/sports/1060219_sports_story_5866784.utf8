 Ardelis canters home 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Ardelis, the three-year-old colt from trainer Vijay Singhs yard, thrashed his rivals to win the richest race for juveniles at the RCTC ground on Saturday. In doing so, the Razeen-Kolar Gold son not only justified his short odds, he also issued a strong note of caution to his adversaries eyeing the summer Classics. The Deepak Khaitan-property is expected to leave for Bangalore after this engagement.

 Jockey C. Alford, who partnered Ardelis to a distance victory, was also associated with three more of Vijays winners ? Clockwork, Silver Grey and Aleksei. The last named horse lifted the Governors Cup with complete authority after being sidelined for long following burst blood vessels problem.

 Silver Grey, who was hard-pressed to win her last over a mile, returned a facile winner of the Crystal Man Handicap, over an identical trip. The Steinbeck-Silver City daughter who started her career nearly an year late, seems to be improving with each run.

 Vijays Clockwork, however, had to sweat it out to win the 1,600m Manasseh Memorial Cup from Star Memories..

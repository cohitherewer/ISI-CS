 Ronaldinhos admission

Bergisch Gladbach: World Player of the Year Ronaldinho has admitted failing to produce his best for Brazil so far at the World Cup finals. 

My goal is to do better and the fact that people expect a lot of me is great because I can only improve, he said. 

I have much more to give.

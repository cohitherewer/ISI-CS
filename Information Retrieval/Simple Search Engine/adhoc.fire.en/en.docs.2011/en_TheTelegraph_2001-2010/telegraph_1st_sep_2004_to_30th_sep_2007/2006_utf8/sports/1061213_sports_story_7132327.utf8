 Dalmiya case

OUR LEGAL REPORTER

Calcutta: P K Sarkar, chief judge of city civil court, Tuesday admitted the case moved by Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) president Jagmohan Dalmiya, challenging the legality of the special general meeting of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) disciplinary committee in Jaipur on Saturday. 

The matter will come up for hearing on Friday. 

The meeting has been convened for taking decision on the alleged financial irregularities by Dalmiya as former president of the BCCI. 

Dalmiya claimed that as per BCCIs rules and regulations, any disciplinary issue should be resolved within six months and since the process against him had commenced on February 27 this year, the committee was no longer valid. 

The judge asked the BCCI to submit affidavits on the next date of hearing.

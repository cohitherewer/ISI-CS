 Juventus, Lazio, Fiorentina relegated 

 Rome: Italys most successful soccer club 

 Juventus were relegated to the second division Serie B along 

 with former champions Fiorentina and Lazio after a sports 

 tribunal found the club guilty of offences in a match-fixing 

 trial. 

 Bringing to a head the biggest scandal in European 

 soccer for decades, the tribunal also ruled that AC Milan, 

 although they will stay in Serie A, would have their points 

 from last season reduced by 44 points ? ruling them out 

 of next seasons Champions League. 

Juventus were stripped of their last two title wins ? from 2006 and 2005. 

All four clubs will start next season with points penalties with Juventus forced to begin their Serie B campaign with minus 30 points ? almost ensuring they will spend at least two seasons in Serie B. Milan will start their Serie A campaign next season with minus 15 points. 

The scandal broke in May with the publication of intercepted telephone conversations between a former Juventus official and Italian soccer authorities discussing refereeing appointments. 

 Juventus said they would appeal 

 what they described as an unheard of decision.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Md. Sp. keen to turn the tide

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: Mohammedan Sporting are hoping that their change in fortune will start with Sundays match against the bottom-placed Fransa Pax at the Salt Lake Stadium. 

Mohammed Habibs team kicked off the NFL on a brilliant note, but faded away as the tournament wore on. they could not fetch a single point in their last three matches in a row. 

We are hoping that things will change against Fransa. Nothing but a win is our aim tomorrow, otherwise well plunge into deeper trouble, Habib said on the match-eve. 

Although he didnt reveal his starting line-up, its likely that Gley Yao Rodrigue would pair up with Patrick Okonji in the attacking zone. 

The club officials, its been learnt, are not too keen to punish the Togolese, who was charged with indiscipline. I told the coach and the officials that I needed time to settle down. Hopefully, Ill be able to play a part in the teams win, the striker, who was discarded by the Mohun Bagan, said.

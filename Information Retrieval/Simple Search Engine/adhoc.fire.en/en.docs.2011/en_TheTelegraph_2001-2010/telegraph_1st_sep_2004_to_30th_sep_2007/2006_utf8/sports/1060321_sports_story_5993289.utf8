 Pampling champion 

Orlando: Australias Rod Pampling held off Briton Greg Owen in a scrappy finish to clinch his second PGA Tour title by a shot at the Bay Hill Invitational on Sunday. 

Four strokes ahead overnight, the 36-year-old fired a level-par 72 to finish on 14-under 274 at the Bay Hill Club. 

Englishman Owen, chasing his first PGA Tour victory, had been one ahead with two holes to play before three-putting from just under four feet for a double-bogey five on 17. 

He also bogeyed the last for a 69 and outright second place, effectively gifting Pampling the title.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 BCCI, ECB settle differences

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Chandigarh: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and the England amp; Wales Cricket Board (ECB) have sorted out differences over logistics during the seven ODIs, the first of which is to be played in New Delhi on March 28. 

The disagreement arose after the ECB demanded chartered flights on some sectors. That got resolved at a meeting between BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah and ECB chief executive David Collier on Thursday evening. 

Weve agreed to chartered flights, but the additional cost is going to be shared by both boards as the Indian players will also avail of them, Shah told The Telegraph. 

The ECB sought chartered flights between Kochi (fourth ODI) and Guwahati (fifth ODI); Guwahati and Jamshedpur (sixth ODI); Jamshedpur and Indore. For technical reasons, the journey from Guwahati to Jamshedpur and from Jamshedpur to Indore is going to be via Calcutta. 

According to Shah, the chartered flights will be operated by Indian (formerly Indian Airlines).

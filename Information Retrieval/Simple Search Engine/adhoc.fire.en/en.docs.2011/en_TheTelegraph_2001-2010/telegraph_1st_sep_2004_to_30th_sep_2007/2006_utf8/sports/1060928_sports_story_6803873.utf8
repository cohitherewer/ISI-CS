 Flintoff hopes to bowl, too 

London: England captain Andrew Flintoff has not ruled out bowling in next months Champions Trophy in India when he makes his comeback after the ankle operation which ended his season prematurely. 

Allrounder Flintoff, who will lead his country at the Champions Trophy and on the subsequent Ashes tour of Australia, has not played since the third Test against Sri Lanka in June. 

My rehabilitation programme was meant to stop in mid-October and thats when the cricket starts, Flintoff said on Wednesday. 

Fingers crossed, if everything goes to plan hopefully I will bowl. But its just wait and see. 

Flintoff, who was speaking before a signing session of his new book Freddie My World, said he was confident his ankle would stand up to the rigours of the Champions Trophy, the Ashes series and next years World Cup in the Caribbean. 

Flintoff, who succeeded Michael Vaughan as England captain after the Yorkshireman suffered a serious knee injury, said he would try to emulate Vaughans approach to last years successful Ashes campaign.

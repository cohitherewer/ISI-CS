 Well treat this game as a final: Ponting

- We are searching for the ladder that will take us to the peak: Fleming 

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Chandigarh: Ricky Ponting believes the Australians will come up with the right plan and attitude needed to make the Champions Trophy final. The men from Down Under have failed to make it in their previous attempts and feels things will change for the better this time. 

You dont think about winning and losing You dont expect to win every game We are looking forward to the challenge. We will treat this game as a final Weve got a good team and a good list of guys to pick from. We cant complain about the way things have panned out for us, the Australian captain said. 

Ponting said he was happy with the way Glenn McGrath has shaped up. We knew he would take a while Im impressed with the way he bowled against India and especially Sachin Tendulkar. 

He knows his game and his body very well. Hopefully with a couple of games more here and a first-class fixture back home, he should be in fine shape before the first Ashes Test. 

Ponting informed that Shane Watson, who had cramps in the previous game, is now fit. 

Stephen Fleming felt that their moment of reckoning had arrived. Were searching for the ladder that will take us to the peak We have been wanting to win against big teams and big tournaments. I believe the win against Australia will take us in that direction. 

The Black Caps captain felt a lot of things will play a role in the outcome on Wednesday. There are not one or two things that will decide the match There will be elements of pressure Maintaining it against Australia will prove vital These can be turned into match-winning performances. 

The start will be important Then there are the conditions Youve got to counter the Aussies strategy and be a little bit more smarter, Fleming remarked. 

Fleming said he was looking forward a lot of battles within the war not just the Shane Bond versus Brett Lee contest. Australia have their own match-winners Weve got our own gameplan Were looking forward to another epic battle. 

Ponting felt the switch from one-day to Test cricket will be crucial ahead of the Ashes. And he doesnt agree about Shane Warnes observation that the Aussies will play three spinners. I think it will be two Im sure the selectors will think about it, he said.

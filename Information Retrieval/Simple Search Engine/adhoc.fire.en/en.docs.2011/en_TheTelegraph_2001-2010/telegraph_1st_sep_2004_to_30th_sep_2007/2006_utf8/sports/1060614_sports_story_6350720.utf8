The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Unbeaten run irrelevant: 

Aragones 

Leipzig: Going into the World Cup with the longest unbeaten record of any of the 32 participants is irrelevant, Spain coach Luis Aragones said on Tuesday. 

The unbeaten run means nothing to me now, Aragones told a news conference. What matters to me now is tomorrows game. For me the important thing is that we win, win and win, nothing more. 

Spains last defeat was when they went down 1-0 to hosts Portugal at Euro 2004, a result that sent them home after the first round.

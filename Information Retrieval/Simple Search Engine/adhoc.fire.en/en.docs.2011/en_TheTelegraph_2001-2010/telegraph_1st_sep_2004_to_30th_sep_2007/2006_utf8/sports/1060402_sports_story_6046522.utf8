 Fransa players woes far from 

 over

 - Roque amp; Co. worried about contracts

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Roque is uncertain about his future 

New Delhi: The All India Football Federation (AIFF) on Saturday has decided to allow the Fransa-Pax Club players to join any NFL first or second division team for the rest of the season on loan, but the players woes are far from over. 

AIFFs decision, communicated to clubs and state associations, comes with a kind of piquant rider that may help Fransa chairman Mickky Pacheco to get away without paying salaries to his footballers. 

While the AIFF has decided to exempt footballers from getting a no-objection certificate from Fransa, it has made it mandatory for players contracted with Fransa for the rest of the season, or even beyond, to obtain a release from their contracts before joining other clubs. 

The AIFF, not surprisingly, is worried about the contractual legalities, but it does no good to the players fortunes, most of whom havent been paid for the past four months. 

An official of a Goan club, who is interested in getting a couple of Fransa players on loan, felt Pacheco will ask for his pound of flesh before handing over the release order to any player. If I know Pacheco well, he will not issue the release certificate to footballers willing to go to other clubs. He may even use this opportunity to ask the players to submit no due certificate in writing before giving them release paper. 

Once the players hand him over the no due certificate, they will never be able to recover their dues, the club official felt. The AIFF has handed over Pacheco a tool to wriggle out of the difficult situation. 

Pacheco has already made it clear that he wouldnt be giving anything in writing. I am not stopping any player from joining other teams. Ive got no problems with that, but why should I give it in writing. Ive got nothing to do with football anymore, he said. 

The AIFF general secretary Alberto Colaco said the federation was officially not aware that players have not been paid their dues. I read media reports daily, but no player so far has officially complained to AIFF. 

The players, on the other hand, are a worried lot. Take the case of Roque Barreto for example. Roque is sought by Mahindra United, but without a release he remains stranded. I dont know what the future has in store for me. The AIFF should step forward and clear the mess, the player said from Mumbai. 

That might take a while to come, but as the April 6 deadline for new Fransa registrations draws near, players will continue to sleep the way they have been doing for the past four months ? restlessly.

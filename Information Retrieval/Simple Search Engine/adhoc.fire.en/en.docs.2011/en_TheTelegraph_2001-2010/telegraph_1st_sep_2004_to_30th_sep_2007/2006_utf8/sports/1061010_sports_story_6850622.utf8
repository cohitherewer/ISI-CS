 Paes keen to talk with Bhupathi

 Paes and Bhupathi 

New Delhi: Leander Paes said on Monday that he wants to sit with Mahesh Bhupathi and clear misgivings so that the country could field its best doubles team in the Doha Asian Games. 

I will sit with him in person, talk to him about how exactly is his feelings. And if he is feeling bit hurt about certain issues, will put my hand around and tell this is not the end of the world, Paes said. 

I am completely surprised to know that he has decided not to play for India. I think selection and things like that, I really do not know what the issue is. So I rather speak to him personally, the tennis ace told a TV channel. 

Paes urged Bhupathi to take back his decision of not donning India cap again as both of them are countrys best bet in doubles. 

Playing for the country is the epitome of my career. Playing with whoever for the country is something I always look into, as to who is the best person for the job. And for doubles job, Mahesh is right now my best partner. So I am basically going around the circles and saying the same thing that Mahesh is the man for the job. 

 In the last Asian Games, 

 Manisha Malhotra was No. 1 player at that time among women 

 and he (Mahesh) decided to play with her. At that stage 

 I was put with a very young Sania Mirza, he said.

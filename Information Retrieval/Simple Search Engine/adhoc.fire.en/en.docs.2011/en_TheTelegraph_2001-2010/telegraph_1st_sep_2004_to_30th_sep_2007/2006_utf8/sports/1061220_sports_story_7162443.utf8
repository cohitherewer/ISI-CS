The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Fletcher wants to carry on

Sydney: Duncan Fletcher wants to stay on as England coach despite his teams heavy Ashes defeat but plans to reconsider his long-term future over the next six months. 

The ECB said Fletchers position would be reviewed after next years World Cup in the West Indies. 

Fletcher told a news conference in Perth on Tuesday that he wanted to remain in charge through to the World Cup but would consider all his options after that. 

Ill just make up my own mind, he told reporters. It might be a move in six months. But Ill make up my mind. 

Ill have a look at where Ive been and where I want to go...and Ill continue in that way. 

Fletcher has borne the brunt of criticism for Englands below-par performances. Most of the criticism has centred around Englands short preparation time and the makeup of the team. 

How do you measure whether they were under-cooked or over-cooked or whether it was the pressure or not the pressure? he said. 

The (selection) system has worked...this is the second series weve lost in 11 and we often hear out here, if it aint broke, dont fix it. Theres blame on all us. Everyone has got to be blamed on how we performed, on how we selected.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Its as if we never existed: Barry

 - Sponsors move upsets SA icons 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Johannesburg: 

 Castle may be satisfying South Africas thirst 

 and pouring in millions of rands into the countrys 

 cricket, but it has upset greats like Barry Richards. 

The sponsors of the South African Test squad and Test cricket in the country held a dinner on Thursday, but only invited those whod played after unification in other words, 1991 onwards. 

 Im happy for the present 

 lot, but its disappointing that the contribution of 

 those who served till 1969-70 isnt getting recognised 

 and last nights function is an example. Its 

 as if we never existed, Barry told The Telegraph. 

The 61-year-old added: Its not just that I wasnt invited... What about a legend like Graeme Pollock? How can he not be called to a dinner for cricketers whove played Tests for South Africa? Each one of us has made a contribution, only that we played in a different era... 

Barry, indeed, may have gone on to break the records which got erased by the Sunil Gavaskars. He played four Tests against Australia, in what became South Africas last series in the Apartheid era. However, that was enough to make a mark: 508 runs at an average of 72-plus. 

Significantly, Sir Don Bradman chose Barry as one of his openers (the other being Arthur Morris) in the team of his choice. It was revealed some months after his death in February 2001. 

Being the hosts, Castle had every right to invite who they wished, but some are wondering why Cricket South Africa didnt speak up for those who played till 1969-70. Perhaps, theres a lack of cricket culture, is how somebody, who requested anonymity, put it. 

 Whatever, one assumes Shaun Pollocks uncle must 

 be as upset as Barry.

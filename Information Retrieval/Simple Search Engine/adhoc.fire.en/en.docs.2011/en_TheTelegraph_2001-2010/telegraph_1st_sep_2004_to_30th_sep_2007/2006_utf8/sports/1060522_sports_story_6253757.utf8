 Pity Eto wont be in Germany 

 - Fifa should review club calendar 

 in World Cup year

 Free-kick

As I sat glued to the television watching the Champions League final the other night, a scary thought crossed my mind. From among the wide canvas of stars in action at the Stade de France, what if one or two of them got seriously hurt? Just over three weeks would have remained for the World Cup to kick off, would that be sufficient time for the player/s to recover?

As it is, the stakes are always very high in a match like this. Not an inch is granted to the rivals, not a trick missed to gain the upperhand. On top of it, most of the match was played in driving rain, which obviously increased the risk of injuries. More so for ball players like Ronaldinho, speedy operators like Thierry Henry. 

All the national coaches whose soldiers were involved in the Battle of Paris must have heaved a sigh of relief on hearing the final whistle. There were no casualties, but it could so well have gone differently? 

Take the red card incident, for example. Lehmann got deceived by the speed of the pass Ronaldinho delivered for Eto and thats why he missed the ball and caught the Cameroonian. Either Lehmann, or Eto, or even both could have suffered injuries in that clash. 

Its incidents like these which should serve as a warning bell to the games governing body. Fifa cant do anything to eliminate or even diminish chances of an injury. What it can certainly do is to review the scheduling of club events. 

I strongly believe that in a World Cup year, the Champions League should be slotted in such a manner that it ends six to eight weeks before the mega event kicks off. Even the high-profile European leagues, which employ a very high percentage of the big names, should end a month before the World Cup gets underway. 

I know its easier said than done as its the clubs which drive the economy in this global sport. But I also believe if theres a strong will, theres a way. No sporting event is bigger than the World Cup finals and absolutely no effort should be spared to ensure that all the footballers the world wants to watch should be injury-free and ready for the monthlong extravaganza. 

The Champions League final had been billed as a Ronaldinho-versus-Henry battle. That didnt materialise, but there were others who shone brightly that night to stake their claim to be potential stars in Germany. 

Despite losing Lehmann in the 18th minute, Arsenals stocks were high because Sol Campbell outjumped his marker and nodded in a beauty 10 minutes before half-time. This big English defender will be an asset for Eriksson. Not only is he solid with his defensive work, he has this knack of being dangerous with pinpoint headers in dead-ball situations. 

Arsenals excellent defensive organisation held off the skilful Barcelona side in the first half. But two super substitutions by Rijkaard ? Andres Iniesta coming in for Edmilson and Henrik Larsson replacing Mark van Bommel ? gave the Spanish side the cutting edge they were missing because Ronaldinho had an off day. 

Iniesta, who struck a good rapport with Deco, came up with some incisive passes. Iniesta is part of a very strong Spanish midfield and Ill be watching with interest what role he is assigned. Im also looking forward to Portugals matches as Deco can form a very potent line-up with Figo and Cristiano Ronaldo. 

Barcelona should be indebted to Larsson for the 2-1 victory. The bald Swedish star came up with a million-dollar touch to set up the equaliser for Eto and again produced a telling pass for Belletti to drive home the winner. 

Larsson is an experienced campaigner and a big stage performer. He will have the tall Zlatan Ibrahimovic by his side in Germany and the two of them can, on their day, rock the strongest of defence lines. 

Its a pity Eto wont be there in Germany. Hes had a wonderful season, scoring almost at will for Barcelona. The way he controlled the ball with his left foot, transferred it to his right and slotted it past the keeper to neutralise Arsenals lead was the act of a high-quality striker. 

I really wish Cameroon had qualified for the finals.

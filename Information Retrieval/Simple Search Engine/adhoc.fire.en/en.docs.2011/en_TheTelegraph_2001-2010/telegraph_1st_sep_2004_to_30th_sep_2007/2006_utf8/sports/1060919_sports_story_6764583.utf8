 Visiting riders stole the show 

 STAR RACER

 Visiting jockeys made a marked difference, bringing more joy than grief among punters last Wednesday. They also provided the most entertainment in the 10 race-day old monsoon season so far. The outstation champions steered six of the eight winners on the day and each one was available at goods odds.

 Things are, perhaps, beginning to look up since RCTC tightened the noose on cellphone offenders. Stipes vigilance was also equally bright during the day and the likes of Chaturvedis and Viranis deserve pats on their backs for bring apprentice Amandeep Singh to the book for his tender handling of Anokato, a Daniel David-ward in the Sir Aali Cup. Incidentally, the race was won by the Imran Chisty-ridden Cameo Role a 5-4 favourite and stablemate of Anokato.

 Chisty had also helped Daniels cause on another favourite, Atlantic Wave. On this occasion, the jockey, however, found strong opposition from his stablemate, Best Prospect, whose challenge was quelled only in the final 100 metres.

 As usual, K.P. Appu was in his elements, delivering the goods on two strongly fancied winners Adderly and All For Love. Both horses were ridden in identical manner to good effect in third position till 200m from home before being sent into the winning lead.

 Trainer Tarak Nath Jaiswals Adderly was, however, far too convincing a winner in the 1,800m Alternator Cup, the feature event, while Robin Corners All For Love was hard put to contend the late challenge of the favourite, Asmi, in the Annihilator Handicap.

 Jaiswal junior, Vikash, on the other hand, saddled a couple. He began with a trouncing win of Mischevious Notes. The four-year-old Mischevious Music filly was virtually giving a tonne of weight to her own-age adversaries yet she won the way she liked in the hands of Rajinder. She has a couple of more surprises in store.

 Vikashs Alcades made a big killing in the Select Handicap. Neglected in the betting, the opposition was no match for the five-year-old once jockey Vinay Jaiswal put the Flitch-son in top gear 300m from home.

 Serrafina was Vijay Singhs lone winner.

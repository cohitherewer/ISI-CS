 Invincible China biggest threat this year

Birmingham: China equalled last years historic feat by winning four of the five titles at the All England Badminton Championships and will be the country to beat in a crowded 2006 calendar. 

Highlights of the year include the Thomas and Uber Cup team competitions in Japan from late April and the world championships in Spain in September. 

While Malaysia reached the mens doubles finals on Sunday and South Korean fifth seed Lee Hyun-il did well to get to the mens singles final, Indonesia had another poor championships without Olympic and world champion Taufik Hidayat, who was preparing for his wedding. 

World number one Lin Dan, the mens champion in 2004, led the way for China, regaining his crown 15-7, 15-7 on his fourth match point against a gallant but outplayed Lee. 

In an all-Chinese womens final, Xie Xingfang retained her title with an 11-6, 4-11, 11-2 victory over Olympic gold medallist Zhang Ning, who is still seeking her first All England title after 10 years of trying. 

Gao Ling and Huang Sui won the womens doubles title for an astonishing sixth year in succession, beating compatriots Yang Wei and Zhang Jiewen 6-15, 15-11, 15-2. 

Gao, with her Olympic champion mixed doubles partner Zhang Jun, saved five match points to dethrone Englands Nathan Robertson and Gail Emms 12-15, 17-14, 15-1. 

Breaking the mould, the mens doubles title went to Denmarks Jens Eriksen and Martin Lundgaard Hansen who beat Malaysians Choong Tan Fook and Lee Wan Wah 15-6, 14-17, 15-2. 

Lins path to the mens single final had not been entirely smooth. He had to survive match point against Malaysian world number two Lee Chong Wei along the way.

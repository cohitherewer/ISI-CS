 India an emerging force in golf, says Kapil

Kuala Lumpur: Kapil Dev, former cricket legend-turned-golf enthusiast, believes India is enjoying a golf revolution that would soon change the landscape of the professional game in Asia. 

With great champions constantly emerging from the subcontinent and new events such as next months Amby Valley Asian Masters being launched, Kapil predicted India may well be the new force in the region ?? in terms of the number of events staged on the Asian Tour and the quality of talent that it produces. 

Indian golfers are already making headlines over the past three to five years and events such as the Amby Valley Asian Masters (May 11-14) are indeed a positive step forward for Indian golf, said Kapil, famous for leading India to their World Cup success in 1983. 

More importantly, it also shows that corporate India is capable of creating new events, said Kapil. 

Events like this serve as a platform as you dont know you have the talent unless you try, and once people try, only then will they know that they are good enough, Kapil said. Tournaments like the Amby Valley Asian Masters will help churn out the skilful and the talented. 

Kapil stressed that more must be done at the grassroot level despite Indias continued supply of talented players. 

In reaching out to the young and boosting their interest, India should create more driving ranges and golf courses so that the kids can play the game. 

India and China are emerging in every sense and there is a need to improve sports. China has given a lot to sports and India should do the same and develop other sports such as golf. I hold golf close to my heart. 

Indians in general enjoy their cricket but it is high time to promote golf.

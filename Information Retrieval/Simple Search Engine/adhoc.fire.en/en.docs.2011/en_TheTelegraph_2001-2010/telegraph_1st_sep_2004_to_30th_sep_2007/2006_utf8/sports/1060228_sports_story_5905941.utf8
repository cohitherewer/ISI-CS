 No room for under age Murray 

 MARK HODKINSON

On Sunday night came another reminder of the rapid rise of Andy Murray, who will on Monday be officially confirmed as the youngest ever British No. 1, when it emerged, that the teenager experienced some complications booking a hotel room for this weeks tournament in Las Vegas as he was considered to be under age. 

It is learnt that the 18-year-old encountered problems with his accommodation because of the strict gambling laws in Nevada, which prohibit anyone under 21 from playing on the blackjack tables and slot machines or from even loitering nearby. 

Murrays plans were disrupted by the fact that the official hotel for the tournament, The Mirage, is also one of the major casinos along the Las Vegas Strip with around 100 blackjack tables for the high rollers. 

There were problems getting Andy a room because of the rules over gambling in Las Vegas, a source close to Murray said.

Suzuka: Ferraris Michael Schumacher moved closer to a record eighth Formula One crown on Saturday after eclipsing Renault rival Fernando Alonso in Japanese Grand Prix qualifying. 

While Ferrari swept the front row, with Schumachers Brazilian teammate Felipe Massa taking pole position for the second time in his career, champion Alonso qualified fifth and behind both the Toyotas. 

Schumacher, retiring at the end of the season as the most successful driver the sport has ever seen, will clinch the title on Sunday if he wins and Alonso fails to score. 

Its been a great weekend so far for us, beamed Schumacher. We are looking strong, we are on the first row and we have the Renaults on the third row and thats a very good starting place for the race. 

Massa indicated he is open to helping Schumacher toward the world title, without team orders that are prohibited. 

However the drivers are free to do what they want. For sure I am open to Ferrari winning both championships. We are here for that, Massa said. And I am working hard to achieve that. I am really motivated to celebrate both championships at the end of the year, the Brazilian said. 

Alonso should be able to keep the title battle alive until Brazil on October 22, but the Spaniard could do without having Schumachers younger brother Ralf and Toyota teammate Jarno Trulli acting as a potential buffer between him and the man he has to beat. 

Schumacher leads Alonso 7-6 on race wins in the standings, with Suzuka the penultimate round of the championship, after levelling the points tally at 116 each with his sensational victory in China last weekend. 

If Schumacher earns his eighth season victory on Sunday and Alonso is scoreless, the German will take a 126-116 lead into the final race at Brazil. Even if Alonso wins the last race and Schumacher is scoreless, they are tied at 126 points each. But Alonsos victory would only be his seventh. 

In case of a tie, the title goes to the one with the most firsts, which would give the nod to Schumacher. 

If Alonso wins in Japan, Schumacher can still tie in Brazil and win the championship on the victories rule. 

However if they are tied in victories and points at the end of the season, the title goes to the driver with the most second places, which Alonso leads 6-4. 

Renault, a point clear of Ferrari in the constructors championship, and partners Michelin were left reeling as the Bridgestone teams flexed their muscles on a sunny afternoon at the Japanese tyre makers home circuit. 

Ferrari, who have won six of the last seven races, and Toyota both use Bridgestone tyres, while Alonso was the leading Michelin driver. 

The weekend was supposed to be dry from today on... so we are looking pretty confident in that area and we see on the Bridgestone side that we are very strong and so are the Toyotas, said Schumacher. 

Thats a very good position for us, considering the race and the championship. 

The German can expect Massa to let him through for maximum points at one of the Ferrari greats favourite circuits, where he has won six times before. 

Im pretty happy where I am and he did a great job, said Schumacher. We are not fighting that much against each other, we are working together and therefore Im happy its him. 

Alonso has his teammate Giancarlo Fisichella alongside in sixth place. 

Hondas Briton Jenson Button and Brazilian Rubens Barrichello filled the row behind with Germanys Nick Heidfeld ninth in a BMW Sauber, and compatriot Nico Rosberg 10th for Williams. 

McLaren, in serious danger of ending the season without a win for the first time since 1996, failed to get either of their cars into the top 10. 

Kimi Raikkonen, Schumachers replacement at Ferrari next season and last years winner at Suzuka from 17th place on the starting grid, qualified 11th. Spanish teammate Pedro de la Rosa was 13th. 

Polish rookie Robert Kubica ended his 100 per cent record of qualifying in the top 10 with 12th place for BMW Sauber in his fifth Grand Prix start. Japans Sakon Yamamoto, who finished a Grand Prix for the first time in China last weekend, failed to set a timed lap at his home circuit and starts last for Super Aguri. 

Meanwhile, Renault boss Flavio Briatore branded Massa little in every sense on Saturday, accusing him of slowing down Alonso during qualifying. 

He is a kid, he is a little kid. Little in every sense, the Italian told reporters. 

Briatore felt the diminutive Brazilian held up Alonso in the decisive final qualifying session. If so, that would be a reversal of a situation that saw the world champion controversially penalised at last months Italian Grand Prix for impeding Massa. 

Felipe was in front of Fernando, braking and everything, Briatore told reporters. We will talk with (FIA race director) Charlie (Whiting) about this, this is perfect. Today we will tell Charlie, but nothing will happen. We already know what the answer will be. 

Fernando on the radio was complaining. If you are fighting with McLaren it is fine, if you fight with these guys (Ferrari) it is impossible.

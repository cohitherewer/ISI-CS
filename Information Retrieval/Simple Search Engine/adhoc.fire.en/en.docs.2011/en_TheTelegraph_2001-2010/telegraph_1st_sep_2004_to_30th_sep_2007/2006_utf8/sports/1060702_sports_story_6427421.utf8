 QUICK TAKES

 World 

 scared of Germany again, says Bierhoff 

 Berlin: Germanys 

 run to the World Cup semi-finals has made people scared 

 of the team again, manager Oliver Bierhoff said on Saturday. 

 Bierhoff is confident that his teams five-match winning 

 run will give the Italians plenty of cause for concern in 

 the semi-finals. The world is scared of the German 

 national team again, Bierhoff, part of a four-man 

 coaching team led by Juergen Klinsmann, said at a news conference 

 on Saturday. Weve gained respect for playing 

 a fast, direct, aggressive game and for always holding our 

 nerve. Germany fans and those around the world have seen 

 that Germany are up there with the best. Italy are a tough 

 opponent but they will be afraid of Germany, he said. Bierhoff 

 said it was difficult to compare the 2006 generation with 

 the victorious teams from 1954, 1974 and 1990 as they had 

 not won the title yet. If we win the title then we 

 can compare this team with other German teams, Bierhoff 

 explained. The development of the young players ? 

 many at their first major tournament ? is simply fantastic. 

 They keep getting better and better.

 Biased announcer fired 

 Berlin: A stadium announcer was replaced during 

 Fridays quarter final between Germany and Argentina 

 for encouraging home fans, Fifa said. Fifa intervened after 

 Andreas Wenzel used the announcement of a substitution to 

 tell the 72,000-strong crowd in Berlins Olympiastadion 

 that the German team needed their support. Wenzel, a veteran 

 announcer, promptly found himself substituted at the microphone 

 by the local organising committee. This had no place 

 in the balanced neutrality of an announcer, Fifa spokesman 

 said. Its not acceptable.

 50 fans arrested 

 Gelsenkirchen: German police detained 50 English 

 and German fans after skirmishes following Germanys 

 quarter final win over Argentina on Friday. Police in helmets 

 moved on to the main street to divide the two groups after 

 they threw bottles at each other. A spokesman for Gelsenkirchen 

 police said 25 English and 25 Germans had been detained.

 28.6m tuned in 

 Berlin: The television audience in Germany 

 peaked at 28.65 million people for quarter final victory 

 over Argentina, the German football association said on 

 Saturday. The share of audience was put at 90 per cent for 

 Fridays match, which Germany won 4-2 on penalties 

 after a 1-1 scoreline at 120 minutes.

 Net slur angers Italy 

 Hamburg: Italy already have some inspiration 

 to beat Germany in the World Cup semi-finals. An article 

 posted on the website of a German weekly earlier this week 

 defined Italians as parasites, mammas boys and 

 slimy, causing outrage in Italys World Cup camp. 

 The weekly pulled the story as soon it got wind of the controversy 

 it created. The magazine also issued an apology, but the 

 damage was done.

 Drink the town dry 

 Gelsenkirchen: There were three main colours 

 in Gelsenkirchen on Saturday ? red, white and yellow ? as 

 England fans did their best to drink the mining town dry. 

 Thick crowd of England supporters up to 10-deep gathered 

 in front of every pub, restaurant or convenience store selling 

 beer. If this keeps up, were going to run out 

 soon. Well have to shut down in a couple of hours, 

 said Ulrich Schiefele, 38, the manager of a local pub.

 A big yawn for US 

 New York: If you look west from Germany you 

 will see the US stifling a yawn at the World Cup. Despite 

 a doubling of television ratings for the first-round matches 

 this month, before the US squad failed miserably, soccer 

 still ranks below televised poker tournaments in a land 

 where baseball, basketball and American football rule.

 Bangla police, fans clash 

 Dhaka: At least 20 people, including policemen, 

 were injured when soccer fans in Dhaka went on the rampage 

 after electricity failed during the Argentina versus Germany 

 match, police said on Saturday. The power distribution office 

 at the citys Nazimuddin Road area came under attack 

 by hundreds of fans on Friday night. Angry fans clashed 

 with police who tried to disperse them by using batons, 

 witnesses said.

 SA to showcase Africa 

 Stuttgart: As South Africa take on the responsibility 

 of organising the next World Cup, exuberance ? and not necessarily 

 efficiency ? appears to be paramount. Fifa kicks off the 

 journey to the 2010 World Cup at a July 7 ceremony in Berlin. 

 Dubbed Africas Calling, it will be attended 

 by South African President Thabo Mbeki and African soccer 

 greats George Weah, Abedi Pele, Roger Milla and Lucas Radebe.

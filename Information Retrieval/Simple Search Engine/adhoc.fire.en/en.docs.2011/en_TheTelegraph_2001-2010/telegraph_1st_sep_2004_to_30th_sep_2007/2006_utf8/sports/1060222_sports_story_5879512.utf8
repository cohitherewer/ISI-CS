The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Its vital to keep Japan at bay for first 20 minutes

 FREE-KICK

 P.K. BANERJEE

 The word impossible has never found a place in my dictionary. Be it in my playing days or during my coaching career, I considered no mission to be impossible. When two teams confront each other, I have always believed they are doing so on a level playing field. No party can take victory for granted, its the one who performs better on that day who will triumph.

 As manager of the Indian soccer squad on Mission Yokohama, I have tried to impress upon the players that if they can take the field on Wednesday against Japan without any inferiority complex and play the game their coach Nayeem wants them to, they can achieve just about anything.

 Fortunately for Bhaichung and his boys, they have a coach who is a real toughie. Not only is he a strict disciplinarian, he sincerely believes that no opposition is unbeatable. If he has managed to rub off some of his mental toughness on the players, it will stand them in good stead next week and the months to come.

 I know Japan have left us miles behind since we beat them 1-0 to claim the Asian Games bronze in 1970. I know they have qualified for the World Cup in Germany. I also know they have a set team which served them well in the World Cup qualifiers last year and beat us 7-0 in Saitama and 4-0 at Salt Lake Stadium. So obviously, even without stars like Nakamura and Nakata, they have a very strong unit.

 The odds against India stack up further if you consider that we will have to play in the evening when the temperatures are very low. It has been raining as well, accompanied by a biting breeze. The Indian Davis Cup team faced similar cold weather in Korea recently and, by their own admission, found it extremely tough.

There is no doubt that playing Japan in Japan represents one of the toughest challenges, especially for a team like ours which is way down on the Fifa rankings list. You have to plan such a campaign very cleverly, choosing a strategy which is likely to yield maximum returns.

 I think we will have to be very careful in the opening 20 minutes. The Japanese ? or, for that matter, any big team facing a lower-ranked team ? will come at us with all their might in that initial period and try to seal the match then and there. If our boys can withstand that early onslaught, the chances of a decent result will brighten. The key will be to avoid letting in two to three goals in the early minutes.

 We have lost some key players to injury. M. Suresh, the tallest defender, wont be there. Sameer Naik hasnt made the trip either. In midfield, well be missing Venkatesh, Alvito and Climax. All these players contributed significantly to our SAFF Cup triumph in Pakistan recently.

 But we have to do with the resources at our disposal. At least we should be thankful that Bhaichung and Sandip Nandy have recovered in the nick of time. 

 We also have some young and energetic chaps like Mehrajuddin Wadao, Sanjeev Maria and Dharambir Singh. For them this is a god-sent opportunity. If they take inspiration from the likes of Dhoni, R.P. Singh and Raina, and have a good day in office, we can give Zicos boys a run for their money.

 Yes, we are in Yokohama to put up a strong fight. But we have to be realistic enough to realise that India are not among anyones favourites to win the Asian Cup. As far as I am concerned, the Asian Cup qualifying matches will serve as ideal preparation for the Doha Asian Games.

 In a way, I am very happy that we have drawn tough teams like Japan, Saudi Arabia and Yemen. These games will help us evaluate our strengths and weaknesses, and help us prepare accordingly for the Asian Games which is the real goal.

 Predicting a result in any sport is a hazardous task. All I want to say is, I am very hopeful that there wont be a repeat of the seven-goal humiliation we experienced last year.

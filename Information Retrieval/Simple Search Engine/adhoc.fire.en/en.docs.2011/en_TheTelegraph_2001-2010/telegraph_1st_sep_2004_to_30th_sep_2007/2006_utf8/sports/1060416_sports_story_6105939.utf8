 Sixty thousand pieces 30x20cms, 

 in fact. The bits where exciting incidents happen ? including 

 the winning goal, for instance ? will be marked accordingly 

 with a certificate of authenticity. Theyll cost ?75 

 each, and the company, Quelle, has promised to donate ?100,000 

 to charity. 

 Bierhoff backs kahn

 Berlin: Germanys 

 general manager Oliver Bierhoff says goalkeeper Oliver Kahn 

 has not played his last game for his country. I am 

 sure that Oliver Kahn will play another international whatever 

 happens, Bierhoff told a magazine. We no longer 

 have farewell games in international football, but we should 

 give him something fitting.

 Kahn will travel with the squad 

 to provide support but unless Jens Lehmann is injured, the 

 Bayern Munich man will be on the substitutes bench 

 and is expected to retire after the finals.

 Korea friendlies

 Seoul: South Korea have 

 pencilled in friendlies against Senegal and Bosnia in late

 take place on May 23 and 26 at Seoul World Cup Stadium or 

 another stadium in the capital area. The Koreans will leave 

 for their base camp in Scotland on May 27 and have arranged 

 final tune-ups against Norway on June 1 and Ghana on June 

 4.

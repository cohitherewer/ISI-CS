 Vaughan, Giles hope to be fit

London: Michael Vaughan, Englands Ashes-winning captain, and left-arm spinner Ashley Giles hope to be fit for Englands tour of India next month, for which the team will be named on Friday. 

Vaughan and Giles were both forced to return early from the trip to Pakistan. Vaughan had his troublesome right knee cleaned out at a Sheffield hospital and Giles underwent surgery in London on a hip complaint. Both are expected to be included in the England tour party but they will need further medical tests before the squad assembles on February 12. 

Vaughan was equally optimistic that Simon Jones would also be restored for the tour which he described as the toughest tour of all.Vaughan said: Two weeks ago I was moving slowly, but Im progressing nicely now. The real test will be running, turning and twisting with spikes on. If it continues to progress as it has been over the last two weeks, Ive no doubt I will be ready for India. 

I will be able to run on a machine in a week or so and then I will go through some cricket skills and exercise at Loughborough on January 30 -31. 

Giles is already running and hopes to start bowling again in the nets next week. 

 Theres still a bit of soreness from the operation but I saw the specialist again last week. Hes happy with my rehabilitation and I am confident of making it, he said. 

If Vaughan is fit for India, he faces a hectic 12 months. He has calculated that he will be on England duty 307 days out of 365. 

Vaughan said that he would like to play as many games as possible, scotching suggestions that he might look to reduce his one-day international workload. 

Inevitably his appearances for Yorkshire will be limited, but Vaughan was at Headingley on Wednesday to help his county unveil ambitious plans for the future development of the stadium. 

Meanwhile, a two-member team of the ECB on Thursday inspected the facilities in Indore for the ODI against England on April 15. The team visited the under-construction Maharani Usharaje Stadium. (Pti)

 Sachin slides to 16th spot

Dubai: Sachin Tendulkar has dropped in his Test rankings while England allrounder Andrew Flintoff is closing in on the No. 1 spot on the allrounders list following Indias Mumbai Test drubbing this week. 

The latest LG ICC player rankings for Test cricket saw Tendulkar drop four places to 16th following his lacklustre show in the drawn three-Test series against England. 

Tendulkars slide reflects the fact the England series was the third in succession where he failed to average 40 runs per innings. 

Two Indian batsman were ahead of him in the rankings ? captain Rahul Dravid (fifth) and Virender Sehwag (10th). 

Defeat in Mumbai, however, made it a forgettable 100th Test for Dravid as he dropped one place on the list. 

Flintoff, named Man-of-the-Series, moved up in the batting and bowling lists to be sixth in the rankings for bowlers, up one place after taking four wickets at the Wankhede Stadium. 

He is now just three rating points behind Englands leading bowler on the list, Matthew Hoggard. 

Among bowlers, five wickets for Harbhajan Singh have pushed him up three places in the rankings and he returns to the top 20. That means India have three players now in top 20 with Anil Kumble (12th) and Irfan Pathan (13th) ? both non-movers in the list ? being the other two. 

A positive note for India is the rise of young fast bowlers Munaf Patel and Sreesanth. Both men have only played two Tests each but already Patel is ranked 51st while Sreesanth is 55th after they shared 19 England wickets.

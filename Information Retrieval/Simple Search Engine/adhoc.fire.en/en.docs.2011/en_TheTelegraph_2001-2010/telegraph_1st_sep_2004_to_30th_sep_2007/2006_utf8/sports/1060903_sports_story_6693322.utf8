 squads for Malaysia tri-series and the Champions Trophy 

 will be picked on Sunday. Sourav, who is among the 30 

 probables for the Champions Trophy, will be donning

 Calcutta: Some 

 24 hours after Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) 

 secretary Niranjan Shah said the senior national selectors 

 could send an additional 16th player for the tri-series 

 in Malaysia, one of the quintet remarked that the ball wasnt 

 exactly in their court. 

Chief selector Kiran More and his colleagues meet at the Cricket Club of India in Mumbai on Sunday afternoon. Besides the squad for Malaysia, they will pick 14 for the Champions Trophy. 

The double, by the way, is this committees last assignment. Even if some selectors retain seats when the next committee is constituted, at the AGM later this month, the chief selectors term is getting over. 

To talk of the tournament which comes first (September 12-24 tri-series), the selectors are expected to retain the 15 which went to Sri Lanka, but (thanks to a mine blast and foul weather) returned without playing a single ODI. 

 The captain (Rahul Dravid) 

 and coach (Greg Chappell) have to convey their thoughts 

 Theyve got to say whether an extra player is needed 

 to facilitate rest and rotation Perhaps, even two players, 

 the selector told The Telegraph on Saturday 

 evening. 

Assuming Dravid and Chappell want an additional player, the selectors may go for a rookie Railways Tejinder Pal Singh or Tamil Nadus Subramaniam Badrinath or even recall former captain Sourav Ganguly. 

The latter bit is an exceedingly long shot, though. 

Logically, a youngster should get the extra seat, but the possibility of the BCCI suggesting that Sourav be called back cant be ruled out How thats going to be done, if at all, is another matter, the selector added. 

To avoid complications in the dressing room and outside, it wont surprise if Dravid and Chappell tell the selectors theyll be happy with 15. 

That, indeed, appears most likely. 

Sourav is one of the 30 probables for the Champions Trophy, but hasnt played ODIs for exactly a year. 

Moreover, while hes a member of the 10,000 runs club, he managed just one fifty in his last ten one-day appearances: 31, 2, 19, 20, 5, 26, 2 retired hurt, 51, 18, 4. 

More recently, Sourav flopped at Northants. 

Even if somebody in the BCCI puts in a Malaysia-specific word for him, the Champions Trophy scene is different. 

That squad is expected to include Anil Kumble, whose recovery from tendinitis on his bowling shoulder is absolutely on track. 

Strictly technically, however, the veteran who turns 36 next month wont be fit on the day of selection. 

For Kumble to make a comeback (he hasnt played ODIs for 13 months), either Dinesh Mongia or Ramesh Powar both of whom went to Sri Lanka and are certain to head for Malaysia as well has to miss out. 

As the selectors have to choose only 14, Rudra Pratap Singh isnt in the frame. He went to Sri Lanka and is expected to make the Malaysia-bound party, too. 

 Rudra Pratap was set to be axed 

 when the selectors chose the squad for Sri Lanka, earlier 

 in the season, but survived after Dravid put in a word.

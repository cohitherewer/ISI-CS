London: Last year, Real Madrid started their Champions League campaign with a 0-3 loss to French club Lyon. The two sides meet again Wednesday in the competitions opening round. 

Nine-time champions Real Madrid were knocked out by eventual runners-up Arsenal in last seasons second stage. Lyon also were eliminated in round two, by PSV Eindhoven. 

Madrid now have Arsenal midfielder Jose Antonio Reyes on their squad, and he made his debut on Sunday in a 4-1 win over Levante a match in which new striker Ruud van Nistelrooy scored a hattrick. 

We play our first Champions League match on Wednesday, and ... (Levante) served as a confidence boost heading into that game, Van Nistelrooy said. It is a very important match for us. 

They were Van Nistelrooys first goals for the club since moving from Manchester United in the offseason. Madrid will be without Michel Salgado and Ronaldo for the Lyon match because of knee injuries. 

Madrid appointed Fabio Capello as coach in a bid to win their first silverware since 2003. Capello, who won the league with Madrid in 1997, has strengthened the team with the acquisitions of Fabio Cannavaro and Emerson from Juventus, and Lyons Mahamadou Diarra. 

Capello wants greater concentration on Wednesday after complaining his side slacked off after going up 2-0 up over Levante. 

We didnt react to the ball and we didnt make long passes or feed the attack, Capello said. We need to be faster and open up the field more. 

Lyon, the five-time defending champions in the French league, warmed up for the Madrid match with a 2-0 win over Troyes. 

Interestingly, Mali midfielder Mahamadou Diarra is ready to use his inside knowledge to help Real Madrid avenge last seasons defeat by his former club Lyon. 

It was 3-0 last year and this year it is going to be difficult again, Diarra told the Real Madrid website on Tuesday. But Im sure of one thing and that is that I dont want to go back there to lose. 

Im familiar with French football and I know what we have to do to avoid losing. We are capable of springing a surprise. 

Diarra, who had been signed at the express request of Reals new coach Fabio Capello, said he was unsure how he would be received on his return to Lyon. 

Arsenal also play on Wednesday, travelling to Hamburg. The Gunners have had their worst start ever in the English Premier League, drawing two and losing one. 

We need to believe in ourselves, Arsenal midfielder Gilberto said. We have a great team and want to turn the situation around. It is not a situation we are comfortable with because we are used to winning games, to be going for the title. 

However, Arsenal captain Thierry Henry will miss the game after sustaining a minor foot injury in training on Tuesday, the club said on its website. 

Henrys absence will be a major blow to last seasons finalists, who have already been struggling domestically to turn their possession into goals. 

Manager Arsene Wenger has included teenage forward Theo Walcott in his 18-man squad, though the main attacking duties are likely to fall on Robin van Persie and Emmanuel Adebayor. 

Germany goalkeeper Jens Lehmann is available having served a two-match suspension in European competition. 

Also Wednesday, Manchester United host Scotlands Celtic, which will be a special match for managers Alex Ferguson and Gordon Strachan. 

Ferguson coached Strachan at Scottish club Aberdeen when they won the European Cup Winners Cup in 1983 and later at Manchester United. 

United welcome back Wayne Rooney and Paul Scholes, who have served three-match domestic bans, but are without Cristiano Ronaldo, who is suspended. 

Ferguson isnt keen on the Battle of Britain tag, or reminders that he played for Celtics crosstown rivals Rangers. 

I have to get rid of the Celtic-United, Scotland-England thing, Ferguson said. If we go down that road, itll make it harder for ourselves. Im going to rely on the quality and experience weve got in European games, particularly at Old Trafford. 

In other matches, its Dynamo Kiev versus Steaua Bucharest, Copenhagen versus Benfica, Porto versus CSKA Moscow and Anderlecht versus Lille. 

Six-time champions AC Milan open with a visit from Greek club AEK Athens. The Champions League is one competition where Milan start on a level playing field the club were docked eight points at the start of the Serie A season as punishment in the match-fixing scandal. 

Filippo Inzaghi and new signing Ricardo Oliveira scored for Milan in a 2-1 win over Lazio on Sunday. Milan midfielder Serginho hopes the win augured well for Wednesday. 

AEK are a proud team and they are coming to Milan hoping to win, Serginho said. We must face this game with our abilities and be confident of our strength.

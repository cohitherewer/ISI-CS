 Observer Fouzdar stays mum

 - We talked about election procedure: CAB president

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The court-appointed observer, Santosh Kumar Fouzdar, got familiar with the CAB election process during a meeting with the warring heads at the Eden on Tuesday. 

The former high court judge will scrutinise the nomination papers on Wednesday. 

Fouzdar held an indoor meeting with the CAB president, Jagmohan Dalmiya, and his challenger, Prasun Mukherjee, for over an hour and a half. 

Fouzdar refused to comment, but Dalmiya described the meeting as very successful. The election procedure had featured during the talks, said Dalmiya. 

We had a general discussion about the procedure of the election. The meeting was very successful. He laid down the process and weve agreed to it. He stressed that everything will be held according to the rules, Dalmiya said. The much-hyped election will be held on Sunday. 

Meanwhile, Ajit Panja, president of the Calcutta High Court Club, denied reports that he has filed nomination for the presidents post. This is a mischievous rumour and there is not an iota of truth, Panja said. 

According to him, the form that he had signed on and submitted to the CAB authorities with the clubs resolution entitling him to cast vote for the polls, was misinterpreted as his nomination.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Argentina win 2-1 

 Hamburg: Argentina got their quest for a third 

 World Cup off to a good start with a 2-1 victory over determined 

 debutants Ivory Coast in a Group C match on Saturday. Hernan 

 Crespo got them off the mark with their first of the tournament 

 in the 24th minute. Several players went up for Juan Roman 

 Riquelmes free-kick from the left and the ball fell 

 free in the middle where Crespo used his goal poachers 

 instincts to poke it home. 

 Riquelmes superb ball through the centre of 

 the Ivorian defence seven minutes from halftime was brilliantly 

 steered home by Javier Saviola for Argentinas second. 

But striker Didier Drogba gave Ivory Coast a reward for their efforts when he pulled a goal back in the 82nd minute by turning to tuck home a low cross from the left by Aruna Dindane.

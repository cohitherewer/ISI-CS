 Massa leaves Schumi behind

Sao Paulo: Felipe Massa swept Ferrari teammate Michael Schumacher off the top of the timesheets in the final practice session of the seven times champions glittering Formula One career on Saturday. 

Massa, who will do what he can to help Schumacher win his last race before retirement on Sunday, lapped his home Brazilian Grand Prix circuit in one minute 11.443 seconds as Ferrari flexed their muscle. Schumacher was 0.188 seconds slower but had been fastest until the dying seconds. He had one spin during the session. 

The 37-year-old German must win Sundays race at Interlagos and hope that Renaults Fernando Alonso fails to score.The Spaniard needs one point to guarantee his second successive title and replace Schumacher as the youngest double champion in the history of the sport. 

Alonso, who can take it easy on his engine knowing that he need only finish eighth, was seventh quickest, with Italian team mate Giancarlo Fisichella fifth. 

With the constructors title at stake, champions Renault need the Roman driver to take on the Ferraris. The French team are nine points clear in the standings.

 Six boards interested in hosting

Dubai: Six countries are to bid to host the Champions Trophy in 2008, the ICC said on Tuesday. 

Australia, Pakistan, South Africa, Sri Lanka and the West Indies as well as associate member United Arab Emirates have submitted letters of intent to host the event, an ICC statement said. 

ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed said the level of interest demonstrated the potential of the event. 

The range of locations of these countries also provides the ICC with the ability to schedule the event at a time of the year that will optimise its potential, said Speed. 

The members have until the end of February to produce full hosting submissions, which will be considered at the next ICC Board meeting in Dubai on March 20-21.

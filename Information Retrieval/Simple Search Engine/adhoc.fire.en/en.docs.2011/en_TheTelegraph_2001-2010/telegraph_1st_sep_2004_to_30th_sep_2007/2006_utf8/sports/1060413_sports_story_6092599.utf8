 CAB receives Dalmiya letter

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The CAB has received president Jagmohan Dalmiyas suspension letter from the BCCI. The letter had arrived yesterday, but since Tuesday was a holiday, we only received it today, confirmed CAB joint secretary Saradindu Pal. 

The CAB will call an emergent working committee meeting next week to decide on the future course of action. We havent decided the date so far, but we will do so at the earliest, Pal said. There will be a one-point agenda in the meeting. 

The BCCI had suspended Dalmiya on Monday, pending inquiry into charges of financial irregularities.

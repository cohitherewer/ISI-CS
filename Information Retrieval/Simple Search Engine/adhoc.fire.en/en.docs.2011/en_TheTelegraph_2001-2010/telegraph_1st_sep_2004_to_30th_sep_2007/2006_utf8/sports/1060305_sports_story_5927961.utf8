 Mystical for Invitation 

 OUR TURF CORRESPONDENT

 (From Top) Mystical 

 and Holding Court 

 Bangalore:The premier event 

 in the Indian racing calendar, the Indian Turf Invitation 

 Cup for four-year-old Indian horses on Sunday, has attracted 

 10 runners. But only three horses ? Mystical, Holding Court 

 and Flashing Star ? have the credentials to land the winners 

 purse of Rs 30 lakh and a trophy valued at Rs one lakh. 

 The S. Ganapathy-trained Mystical blotted his copybook in 

 last months Indian Derby when he lost to Velvet Rope. 

 But then, the Alnasr Alwasheek-Mystic Memory son was baulked 

 for a clear run at a crucial stage of the race and by the 

 time he was switched out of trouble and asked for an effort, 

 Velvet Rope had stolen a march. Mystical has been working 

 very well and his fortune may take a turn on home turf.

 Trainer S. Padmanabhans Holding Court, who finished a good second to Velvet Rope in the same race at the Mahalaxmi race ground, has been a consistent performer and the Bangalore course has also been his favourite hunting ground. Bred to stay, the Royal Kingdom progeny is sure to offer stiff resistance to Mystical. 

 Flashing Star, another horse from Ganapathys stable, is the one who is capable of upsetting the applecart of the favourites. Flashing Star won the Bangalore Derby in a very convincing manner. He is in fine trim and his summer season drubbing at the hands of Holding Court is best ignored.

 Ganapathy and Prakash have already claimed two of the five graded races ? the Sprinters Cup and the Stayers Cup ? framed in the weekend card. If Mystical win them the third, the Turf Invitation Cup, the duo may create a record of sorts. Their Southern Empire and Southern Regent may be hard to beat in the 1,400m Japan Trophy, a baby race, and the 1,600m Maj. P.K.Mehra Memorial Super Mile ? the remaining Graded races in Sundays nine-event card.

 While Southern Empires form is brilliant, Prakash has gone on record saying that he would not miss Super Mile on Southern Regent. Prakashs resolve may deny Spectacular Quest a rare double ? the Sprinters and the Super Mile.

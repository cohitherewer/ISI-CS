 Shahnaz is Pak coach

Karachi: Pakistan have named disgraced Olympian Shahnaz Sheikh as the coach and manager of the hockey team for next months World Cup to be played in Germany. 

Sheikh was banned by the then Prime Minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto for wearing the 1972 Munich Olympics silver medal on his boots on the podium. 

Sheikh was installed as the team boss in the wake of resignation by incumbent Asif Bajwa following the teams humiliation in the recent Champions Trophy in Spain.

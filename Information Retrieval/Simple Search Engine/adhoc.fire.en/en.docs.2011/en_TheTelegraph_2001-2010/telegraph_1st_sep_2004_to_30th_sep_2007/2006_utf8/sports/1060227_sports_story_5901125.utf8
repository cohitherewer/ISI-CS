Centurion: Skipper Graeme Smith hit a superb century to steer South Africa to a convincing six-wicket win over Australia in the first one-day International on Sunday. 

The opener thumped an undefeated 119 from 124 balls, the highest score by a South African in a one-dayer against Australia. 

The tourists, who won the toss and chose to bat, totalled 229 for eight in a match reduced to 47 overs a side by rain. 

South Africa, set a revised target of 204 in 41 overs after more rain, got home in 37.3 overs. Smiths innings included 12 fours and a six and beat the previous record of 112 held jointly by Gary Kirsten and Hansie Cronje. 

Smith, who faced stinging criticism after his team performed poorly on their tour of Australia, roared with satisfaction after he stroked Michael Clarke through the covers to reach his sixth one-day century. 

Clarke and Michael Hussey had resurrected Australias innings with a century stand after the visitors slumped to 25 for three. Clarke clipped his 53 off 82 balls, while Husseys 56 came off 73 balls. 

Simon Katich, who dragged a wide delivery from Makhaya Ntini onto his stumps, and Damien Martyn, trapped plumb leg-before by seamer Shaun Pollock, fell early on. 

Adam Gilchrist, standing in as skipper for the injured Ricky Ponting, then played a roundhouse hoick off Ntini and sent a looping catch to Andre Nel at mid-on. 

That was the signal for Clarke and Hussey to begin their rescuing partnership, and they scored steadily despite a slow pitch.

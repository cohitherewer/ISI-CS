The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Maintaining ranking my priority, says Federer

 - QATAR OPEN 

 World No. 1 chases 34th career title 

 Roger Federer 

Doha: The new year means business as usual for world No. 1 Roger Federer whose resolution is simply to continue to dominate once again in the new season. 

I had a good run in 2004 and I was able to match it in 2005 too. Obviously I am aiming at a repeat of that in 2006 as well, he said. 

 I dont feel like it is the beginning of a new season. There is hardly any break between seasons, Federer told reporters at the Doha International Airport on Sunday. He will be defending his Qatar Open title. 

The tennis calendar is almost round-the-year. Its almost continuous, so much so that I dont feel anything new, the Swiss said. 

The Wimbledon and US Open champion will start the new season by chasing his 34th career title at the $1 million Qatar Open, which begins on Monday. 

Since being beaten in the final by David Nalbandian in the season-ending Masters Cup, Federer, who played in the Shanghai event despite an ankle injury, has been training hard with coach Tony Roche in Sydney. We spent Christmas together but a lot of time was spent on the court for an intense preparation for 2006, Federer said. 

The Swiss ace, who admitted he was disappointed by the loss to Nalbandian and by his defeat by eventual champion Marat Safin of Russia in the Australian Open semi-finals, said he felt he could continue to dominate the game in 2006. 

Its a huge priority for me to maintain the No. 1 ranking during 2006. The Australian Open, in two weeks time, should provide the clue as to what lies ahead in 2006, he said. 

In Doha, Federer is drawn to meet Czech wild card Ivo Minar in the first round and faces a probable second-round clash with former champion Fabrice Santoro of France.

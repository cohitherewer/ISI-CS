 Spain overpower Argentina 2-1 

 - Friendly Roberto Ayala equals Diego Simeones record 

Murcia (Spain): After two morale-sapping defeats in Euro 2008 qualifiers, Spain salvaged some measure of pride with an impressive 2-1 win over Argentina in a friendly on Wednesday. 

The result will provide some respite for beleaguered coach Luis Aragones, who has come under heavy pressure following his sides recent Euro qualifying losses to Northern Ireland and Sweden. 

Im happy because we played a good game, but we also played well against Sweden in the second half, Aragones told Spanish state television. 

The home side took the lead through a spectacular long-distance drive from midfielder Xavi in the first half but Argentina equalised just over a minute later when substitute Daniel Bilos slotted home from close range after a neat pass from Lionel Messi. 

Spain dominated for long periods but did not cash in until striker David Villa converted from the penalty spot after Andres Iniesta had been tripped in the area by skipper Roberto Ayala, who was making a record-equalling 106th appearance for Argentina. Ayala equalled Diego Simeones record. (Agencies)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Woolmer: I hope to pull through

 - All have to share some responsibility for what happened: Younis 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Jaipur: Thanks, I hope to pull through, was Pakistan coach Bob Woolmers response when The Telegraph wished him luck soon after news broke that strike bowlers Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Asif had tested positive for the banned Nandrolone. Later, both Woolmer and stand-in captain Younis Khan (as also Sri Lankas Mahela Jayawardene and Tom Moody) took questions from the Media.

 The following are excerpts from what the rival captains and coaches had to say about the dramatic development ahead of Tuesdays Pakistan versus Sri Lanka Champions Trophy match: 

YOUNIS: Top players ke nahin khelne se mushkil hoti hai, 

but cricket is a team game... Because of my nature, I remain positive and Im 

confident we will play well... Actually, the team responds well to tough situations... 

Personally, Im going to put in more... All have to share some responsibility 

for what happened... Aisi koi baat nahin hai ki there are differences between 

the PCB and the team... What has happened has happened... My mission remains the 

same: Whether we win or lose, the quality of our cricket has to be good... As 

captain, Ive always backed my players and, Inshallah, we will do 

well... How many players have tested positive? Filhal do hi hain... 

WOOLMER: Younis and I are disappointed at what has happened... We havent discussed the issue as a team, thats going to be done in the evening... Im confident the players will take adversity in their stride... Its important to put such issues behind us and look at getting full points tomorrow (Tuesday)... Do I share responsibility for what happened? For everything, the buck stops at the coach... In fact, Id got the PCB to introduce dope testing... Its a coach job to pre-empt... I try to create the best environment... At times like this, a lot of things go on in ones mind... What holds me on is my love and passion for the game... Weve got to stop the hurricane from knocking the house down... Ive never experienced something like this before... Its not for me to speculate on whether this is the end for Shoaib... Who knows whats going to happen tomorrow... Its a mystery... Getting angry doesnt help... If I can, I ease off by playing golf or through music... Perhaps, a nice movie... 

JAYAWARDENE: This development wont change our planning... Usually, teams which get affected (by a controversy) find another gear... From a purely cricketing point, its disappointing as we were looking forward to the challenge of playing Shoaib... 

MOODY: The involvement of drugs isnt welcome in any sport... The full story isnt known as yet, but its sad... Our players werent tested before we came here, but they were told that the tournament would see random dope testing...

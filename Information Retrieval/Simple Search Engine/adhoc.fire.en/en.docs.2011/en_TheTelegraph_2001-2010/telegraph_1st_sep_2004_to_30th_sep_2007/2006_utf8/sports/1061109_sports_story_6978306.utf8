 AIFF plans Dubai trip

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: After failing in its attempt to organise practice matches for the Doha Asian Games-bound squad on the home soil, the All India Football Federation (AIFF) is planning to take the national squad to Dubai for a few friendly matches before the start of the Asian Games. 

According to sources, in case the federation manages to organise matches in Dubai, then the national team wont come back to India after playing in the Asian Games qualifier against Yemen on November 15. The matches in Dubai are likely to be played between November 17 and 25. 

The federation was planning to hold matches against Malaysian national team in Delhi and Gurgaon before the Asian Games, said an AIFF official. It has been cancelled as the Malaysian federation has not come back to us to confirm the tour. Now we are left with no other alternative but to look for practice matches elsewhere. 

On Thursday, the AIFF will hold talks with their counterpart in Dubai and finalise the whole tour.

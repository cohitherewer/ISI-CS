Colombo: Anwar Ali Khan wrecked havoc with a five-wicket haul as Pakistan retained the ICC under-19 World Cup with a 38-run victory over India in a low scoring final here on Sunday. 

After being bundled out for 109 in 41.1 overs, Pakistan relied on pacemen Anwar Ali (5 for 35) and Akhtar Ayub (3 for 9) to clinch a remarkable victory at the Premadasa Stadium. 

The Indians had no answer to the pace and prodigious movement generated by the opposition bowlers to be folded up for a paltry 71 in just 18.5 overs. 

Piyush Chawla, who was Indias bowling hero with four for 8, was also the highest scorer with an unbeaten 25 as wickets kept tumbling at the other end. 

The Indian reply got off to the worst possible start with Gaurav Dhiman being bowled off the first ball of the innings by Jamshed Ahmed. 

The side had hardly recovered from the shock when Anwar Ali sent back player-of-the -tournament Cheteshwar Pujara, Rohit Sharma and Mayank Tehlan in the next over.

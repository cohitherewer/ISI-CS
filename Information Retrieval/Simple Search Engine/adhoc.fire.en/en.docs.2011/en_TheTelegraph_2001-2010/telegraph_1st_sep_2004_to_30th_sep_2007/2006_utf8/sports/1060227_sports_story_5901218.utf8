 Greg Chappell backs youngsters to deliver 

 - It is all part of the policy to regenerate the team 

Nagpur: Team India coach Greg Chappell on Sunday backed his young Test side to deliver the goods against England who were struggling with worries of their own ahead of the first Test starting here on Wednesday. 

I think the selection committee has made a decision along the lines of what we have seen with the one-day side, he said. The energy and the application the young boys have brought to the one-day squad have been encouraging for everyone. 

It is all part of the policy to regenerate the team, the former Australia captain added. 

While we have got some experienced players, we need to be able to bring young players in and let them work their way in and get some experience and learn from the seniors. 

The average age of the Indian squad has come down considerably after selectors opted to go for youth, especially in the bowling attack which now consists of rookies Piyush Chawla, Sreesanth, Rudra Pratap Singh and Vikram Rajvir Singh. 

However, Chappell said that there were bowlers like Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singh who had enough Test experience. 

India have won 12 of their last 16 one-day Internationals, thrashing Sri Lanka 6-1 at home last year and easing to a 4-1 series win in Pakistan this month, helping lift morale after losing the test series. 

Everybody has to start somewhere, Chappell said. You dont get experience sitting on the sidelines. It is important that they get picked when they are ready. 

We have a fair bit of experience in the bowling line-up with (Irfan) Pathan, Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singh, so I am not unduly concerned, Chappell added. 

We worked out that we need some pace and we need some bounce and we looked to some young bowlers to provide that for us. 

Chappell also said his young side was bubbling with enthusiasm and was growing by leaps and bounds. 

It is ready to face any challenges, he told reporters after a brief net session by Team India at the Vidarbha Cricket Association ground. 

Chappell hinted that India would revert to specialist openers, although he did not rule out the possibility of implementing fresh ideas.

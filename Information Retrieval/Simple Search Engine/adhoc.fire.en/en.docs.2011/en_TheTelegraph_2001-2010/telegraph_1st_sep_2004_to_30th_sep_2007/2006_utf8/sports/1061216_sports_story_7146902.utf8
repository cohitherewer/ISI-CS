 Nobody has contacted me: Akram

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Johannesburg: Former Pakistan captain Wasim Akram has denied reports that hed been approached to work with Irfan Pathan, who is struggling with his bowling, at nets. 

Nobody has contacted me, but I wont have a problem if Im asked to sort things out, he told The Telegraph on Friday afternoon. 

Pathan, who idolises Akram, needs to work on a few technical things. He didnt get picked for the first Test.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Ive got greater responsibility, not more pressure: Dhoni

 - I dont mind the sledging... It spurs me on... Instead of succumbing, I gain in confidence... 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Mahendra Singh Dhoni 

Nagpur: Much as Mahendra Singh Dhoni would like to keep a low profile, he cant. Not after Pakistan, where the 24-year-old taught the bowlers more than a lesson or two. Dhoni spoke to The Telegraph for around 45 minutes in the lead-up to the first Test. 

 The following are excerpts 

 Q Has life changed after Pakistan?

 A It has... Doing well against 

 Pakistan lifts an Indian cricketers standing and, 

 so, its natural that things arent quite the 

 same as before. The day after wed landed there, (coach) 

 Greg Chappell said an Indo-Pak series has marquee 

 status and noboby will dispute that. Of course, I didnt 

 go to Pakistan in a state of desperation. 

 On returning, did you get much 

 time to spend at home (Ranchi)?

 Two days... It couldnt 

 be more as I had to appear for a commercial shoot in Mumbai. 

 Isnt the adulation going 

 to add to the pressure?

 Much depends on how an individual 

 handles pressure... I look at the positives... Id 

 say Ive got greater responsibility, not more pressure... 

 (After a pause) I dont think in terms of what people 

 may say if I dont get runs... What matters is being 

 happy with the level of commitment Ive put in. 

 In Pakistan, you often had 

 to come up with something special in pressure situations...

 Its nice I could 

 deliver on most occasions... Be it the Faisalabad Test or 

 in the ODIs... I learnt a lot, too. 

 Like? Under pressure, putting 

 my hand up to be counted... I can still vividly recall the 

 heat when I went to bat (258 for four) in Faisalabad... 

 Shoaib Akhtar was on fire and... 

 Did the sledging during your 

 innings of 148 make you more determined to pay Pakistan 

 back with sixes? (Laughs) I dont mind 

 the sledging... It spurs me on... Instead of succumbing, 

 I gain in confidence... I thrive in situations when the 

 tension rises. 

 Just about everybodys 

 performance nosedived in the final (Karachi) Test. Was your 

 confidence also dented? I was itching to bounce 

 back in the ODIs... You cant do anything about the 

 past, but the future is in your hands... We didnt 

 lose heart and hope, and won handsomely (4-1)... 

 Did you set yourself a target? Not so much a target... 

 I wanted to make significant contributions both behind and 

 in front of the stumps. 

 Today, how do you look back 

 on the Lahore ODI? You not only emerged MoM, but invited 

 a comment from the President of Pakistan... It wasnt an easy situation 

 when I went to bat... I need 12-15 balls to settle down, 

 but it wasnt possible that evening and I had to attack 

 straightaway. It paid off. 

 You had an excellent partnership 

 with Yuvraj Singh both in the Lahore ODI as well as in Karachi. 

 What makes the two of you combine so lethally? In Karachi, the team strategy 

 (chasing 287) was that Yuvi and I should be together at 

 the 40th-over mark and that the score be 200 or so... Thats 

 how the script unfolded... It was a calculated assault... 

 When I didnt get a big hit, Yuvi got a boundary... 

 Both Yuvi and I play positively and both have the same hunger 

 to succeed... We look to win matches, rather than just doing 

 well. 

 Yuvrajs gesture after 

 the Karachi ODI, when he declared you also deserved to be 

 both the MoM and MoS, must have been moving... Made me walk taller... However, 

 Yuvi was consistent throughout and deserved both awards 

 he got. 

 At No. 3, youre the highest 

 ranked Indian batsman in ODIs. Are you conscious of ratings 

 and rankings? Ive read about it... 

 More than being No. 3, Im happy Ive been helping 

 the team win. Cricket is a team sport and its important 

 to succeed collectively. Im only one of 11 players. 

 Conscious about having become 

 a superstar? Well, Ive lost the 

 privacy... 

 A year ago, youd just 

 played in three ODIs (versus Bangladesh)... What are your 

 thoughts on the past 12 months? I knew playing Test cricket 

 depended on being consistent in the ODIs... I tried to make 

 the most of every opportunity... Along the way, Ive 

 learnt to handle pressure... Ive also learnt to adapt 

 to situations... I think Ive batted everywhere! Most 

 important, Ive begun to read the game better. 

 Will you pick your 148 in Vizag 

 (at No. 3, against Pakistan) as the turning point? Indeed, yes... That innings 

 made everybody take notice of Mahendra Singh Dhoni... Showed 

 I could handle greater responsibility... That I wouldnt 

 let down the team. 

 Your debut was under Sourav 

 Ganguly-John Wright, but youve been blossoming under 

 Rahul Dravid-Greg Chappell... Did you have to adjust? No... Sourav promoted me 

 to No. 3 in Vizag... I was still rather new then... Ive 

 played more under Jam (Dravid)... The captain and coach 

 are using me wisely... They have lots of faith and Ive 

 got lots more responsibility. 

 Surely, your own game is being 

 developed on the wings of flexibility... Its going to help 

 me in the future, too. 

 Inzamam-ul Haq has been the 

 latest to compare you with idol Adam Gilchrist...

 (Interrupting)The comparisons 

 are misplaced for the simple reason that Gilchrist has proved 

 himself over a number of years... Ive only been around 

 (at the international level) for 14 months. 

 What are your own expectations 

 from the series which gets underway on Wednesday?

 Im hoping to carry 

 forward my Pakistan-form. 

 Have you already begun to think 

 of the 2007 World Cup? Whatever planning I do is 

 series-by-series... The World Cup is a year away... 

 Computer games apart, how do 

 you unwind when on India duty? Leafing through books on 

 bikes... And, nowadays, listening to Himesh Reshammiya chartbusters. 

 (After a pause) If theres a sniffer dog who isnt 

 busy with his own commitments, then I try and spend time 

 with him... I actually played with one before the last ODI 

 in Bangalore. Till my Faisalabad hundred, I had a German 

 Shepherd (Sam) at home. Now, theres a labrador (Zara) 

 as well. 

 Something for the fans... Please dont expect 

 a six off every ball... I play according to the situation 

 and, so, just have faith in me. I wont hit a six because 

 a section of the crowd has to be obliged. 

 Finally: Whats the finest 

 compliment youve received? When, after my Faisalabad 

 hundred, Kapil Dev said I was his hero!

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Decision on tie dates today

 A STAFF REPORTER

 UP -SIALKOT MATCH

 Calcutta: The BCCI will 

 decide on a fresh set of dates on Saturday after the Pakistan 

 Cricket Board turned down a proposal to reschedule the September 

 19-22 match between Uttar Pradesh and Sialkot in Dharamsala. 

 This was informed by the BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah. 

 Uttar Pradesh wanted the match 

 postponed since some of their players would be on national 

 duty. A BCCI official said last week the match would take 

 place from September 27-30, but the PCB said nothing had 

 been received confirming the new dates.

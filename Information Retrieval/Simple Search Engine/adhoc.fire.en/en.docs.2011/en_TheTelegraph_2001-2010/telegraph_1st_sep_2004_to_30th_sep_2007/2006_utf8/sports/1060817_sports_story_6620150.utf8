The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Current risk level was not acceptable, says CSA

 - With tri-series scrapped, India-Sri Lanka will now play three one-dayers 

Johannesburg: A threat from the Tamil Tiger 

 Youth was the clinching factor in the decision to withdraw 

 the South African team from Sri Lanka, Cricket South Africa 

 (CSA) CEO Gerald Majola said on Wednesday. 

 Weve been waiting for the report from 

 the ICC-approved security consultants and we received that 

 today from the Olive Group. The report says the current 

 risk is unacceptable and the Sri Lankan government is unable 

 to guarantee the physical safety of the team, Majola 

 told a media conference. 

We have discussed our withdrawal with the ICC (International Cricket Council) and I was on the phone to (ICC CEO) Malcolm Speed this morning and they understand our situation. 

Majola said the team had received a direct threat early on Wednesday from the Tamil Tiger Youth. 

The Tamil Tiger Youth sent an e-mail to the (South African) High Commission this morning saying that the team must come home. Ive seen the e-mail. 

The Tigers are fighting for a separate homeland for minority Tamils in Sri Lanka. 

The South African team, who were due to play a triangular series with Sri Lanka and India, had initially decided to come home on Monday, after a bomb blast in a shopping centre popular with the players, less than two km from their Colombo hotel, killed seven people. 

South Africas own security consultants, Nicholls and Steyn, who are contracted to the ICC to oversee security arrangements at the World Cup, compiled a report saying there was a real threat to the team. 

Sri Lanka Cricket refused to accept the report, although they did offer presidential-level security to the team. CSA announced that the team would stay while the Dubai-based Olive Group compiled a security report. 

The independent report...just confirms what our own security team and the High Commission have said, that it is unsafe to be in Sri Lanka at the moment, Majola said. 

We have a wonderful relationship with Sri Lanka Cricket and will now be talking to them about rescheduling the tournament in Sri Lanka once the situation improves, in South Africa or even at a neutral venue, he added. 

The Indians will stay back to play a three-match series against the hosts beginning on Friday. 

 All the three matches will be day affairs at the Sinhalese 

 Sports Club with the other two matches scheduled for Sunday 

 and Tuesday. (Reuters)

 Low-key start by Indians

Taipei: It was a low-key start for Indian golfers in the first round of the $300,000 Taiwan Open with none of them breaking par at the Sunrise Golf and Country Club here Thursday. 

Gurbaaz Mann was the only one to shoot par and was lying 34th in a field of 142. Harinder Gupta and Digvijay Singh came back with rounds of two-over 74 and were lying 63rd, while Rahil Gangjee, runner-up last week at Mercuries Masters, was three-over 75 in 83rd place. 

S.S.P. Chowrasia, who was disqualified while leading by five shots after two rounds last week, shot a four-over 76 and was tied 95 and Arjun Singh, needing a good finish to secure his card for 2007, was five-over in 77 and 107th. (PTI)

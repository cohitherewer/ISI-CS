 Anand outwits Van Wely

Monaco: Defending champion Viswanathan Anand overpowered GM Loek Van Wely of The Netherlands in the rapid game to register a 1.5-0.5 victory in the eighth round of 15th Amber Blindfold and Rapid tournament. 

After a hard-fought draw in the blindfold game, the Indian ace came up with an inspired performance in the return rapid game to remain on the heels of GM Alexander Morozevich of Russia, who defeated world champion Veselin Topalov of Bulgaria also by the same margin. 

Morozevich emerged as the sole leader with 11 points out of a possible 16, while Anand is right behind him on 10.5 points in the 2,16,000-euro prize money tournament. 

Spaniard Francisco Vallejo Pons, on 9.5 points, stayed on third spot, while Alexander Grischuk of Russia and Peter Leko of Hungary on eight points each, are distant fourth. 

Anands supremacy in the rapid section remained intact as the Indian super GM took his tally to six points out of a possible eight here. Morozevich and Vallejo Pons are next in line with 4.5 points each. 

In the blindfold section, Morozevich seems to be running away with the crown as he took his tally to an astounding 6.5 points out of a possible eight. His nearest contenders are Vallejo Pons and Hungarian Peter Leko (five points each), while Anand is in the next group with 4.5 points in his kitty. (PTI)

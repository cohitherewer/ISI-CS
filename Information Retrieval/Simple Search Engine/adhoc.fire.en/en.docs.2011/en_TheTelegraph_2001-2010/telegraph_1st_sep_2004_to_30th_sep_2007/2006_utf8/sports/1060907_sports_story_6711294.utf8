 Kovalainen to replace Alonso

 - 2007 FORMULA ONE SEASON 

 Fernando Alonso 

Enstone (England): Finlands Heikki Kovalainen will drive for Renaults Formula One team next season, while managing director Flavio Briatore will stay with the team for another two years. 

Renault said on Wednesday that the 24-year-old Kovalainen, who has been a test driver for three years, would race alongside Giancarlo Fisichella next season. 

The Finn will replace reigning F1 champion Fernando Alonso, who is moving to McLaren. 

Brazilians Ricardo Zonta and Nelson Piquet Jr., son of former three-time F1 champion Nelson Piquet, will be Renaults test drivers. 

 Kovalainen was second in the 2005 GP2 series before concentrating on testing this year. 

 My two seasons testing for the team, as well as my time in GP2, have allowed me to build my technical knowledge and to understand what it takes to win in Formula One, he said. 

I think next year is a new start for me. There will be high expectations straightaway, but I will not look at it as extra pressure. 

Fisichella, 33, has been with Renault since 2005. 

The 30-year-old Zonta has eight seasons of F1 experience, including as a driver with BAR-Honda in 1999-2000, Jordan in 2001 and Toyota in 2004-05. Piquet Jr., 21, has raced at A-1 and GP2 levels but this will be his first move into F1.

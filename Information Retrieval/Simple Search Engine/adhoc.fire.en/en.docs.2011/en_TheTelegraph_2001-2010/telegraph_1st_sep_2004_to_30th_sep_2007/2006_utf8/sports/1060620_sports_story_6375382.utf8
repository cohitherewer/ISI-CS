 Iaquinta injured 

Duisburg: Reserve forward Vincenzo Iaquinta injured his left thumb during Italys training session Monday. Iaquinta fell and hurt himself while attempting to break his fall. He was taken to a nearby hospital for tests. 

Team physician Enrico Castellacci said the thumb was not broken and that Iaquinta should be able to play in Italys next game, against the Czech Republic on Thursday. I dont think he will have any problem, Castellacci said. 

Meanwhile, striker Milan Baros resumed light training Monday, giving the team hope he might return for the Czech Republics last Group E match against Italy. Baros strained a tendon in his left foot in a friendly early June. 

Since the team arrived in Germany a few days later, he has trained once under painkillers. 

 Elsewhere, Jared Borgetti will miss a second straight Cup game with a torn left thigh muscle, but Mexico hopes to have its high-scoring forward back if it advances to the second round. 

The team yearned to have Borgetti ready for Wednesdays Group D finale against Portugal in Gelsenkirchen, but trainer Milton Graniolatti said Monday that the injury had not healed enough. 

He cannot play for this game against Portugal, Graniolatti said. 

 Iran defender Yahya Golmohammadi will also miss his teams last match against Angola and will be out for the next three to four weeks. 

He will not play because of a problem with the shoulder, a team doctor said. He injured the ligaments in the last match. (Agencies)

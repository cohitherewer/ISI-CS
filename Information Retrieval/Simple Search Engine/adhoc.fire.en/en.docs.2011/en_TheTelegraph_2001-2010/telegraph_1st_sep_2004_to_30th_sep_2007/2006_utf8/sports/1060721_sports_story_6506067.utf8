Zurich: Former France captain Zinedine Zidane and Italy defender Marco Materazzi were both fined and banned by Fifa on Thursday after the head-butting incident that marred the World Cup final. 

Zidane, who has retired as a player, was fined 7,500 Swiss francs ($6,014) and handed a three-match ban by Fifas five-man disciplinary committee following his red-card for head-butting Materazzi in Berlin on July 9. 

As he is no longer a player, he offered to undertake three days of community service on Fifas behalf as part of their humanitarian activities, which the committee accepted. 

The Italian defender, who admitted insulting Zidane, provoking the Frenchmans head-butt, was handed a two-match ban and fined 5,000 Swiss francs ($4,010). He attended a hearing last Friday, but his sentence has been fiercely criticised in Italy. 

The bans apply to international competitive matches, even though it is a symbolic ban for Zidane who has confirmed he has no intention of reversing his decision to retire. 

In their statements, both players stressed that Materazzis comments had been defamatory but not of a racist nature, a Fifa statement said. During the course of their hearings both players also apologised to Fifa for their inappropriate behaviour and expressed their regret at the incident. 

Fifa spokesman Andreas Herren told around 50 reporters at Fifas headquarters: Both players have a congruent separate account of what was said. The words will remain private, but they were of an insulting nature, not a racist nature. 

Paolo Maldini, captain of AC Milan and former captain of Italys national team said Fifas ruling was scandalous. 

Its scandalous to suspend a player for having said something. Its the first time its been done and its only because Materazzi is Italian and because they wanted to justify the action of a great champion (Zidane) but who was in the wrong. (Reuters)

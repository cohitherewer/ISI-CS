 Kahn still wants an explanation

Berlin: A frustrated Oliver Kahn broke his silence and said coach Jurgen Klinsmann still owes him an explanation for demoting him from Germanys starting line-up. 

I will never be able to justify and understand why I am not the No.1 still, the 37-year-old told a German magazine. 

Normally, Id have expected a full explanation, he was quoted as saying. But as there hasnt been one up until now, there probably wont be one. 

Kahn said the only reason he had heard for why he was dropped was that Lehmann was supposedly playing a tick better. (AP)

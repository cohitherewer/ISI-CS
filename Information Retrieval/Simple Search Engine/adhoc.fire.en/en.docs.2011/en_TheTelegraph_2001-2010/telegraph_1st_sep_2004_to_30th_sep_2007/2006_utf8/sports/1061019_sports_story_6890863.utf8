 Musharraf calls up to congratulate Younis men

Karachi: Pakistans victory against Sri Lanka in the Champions Trophy has lifted the mood of the countrys fans and even President Pervez Musharraf could not resist calling the team in India to congratulate the players personally. 

The shock announcement on Monday that fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Asif had tested positive for taking a banned performance enhancing drug had sent the nation into mourning, virtually. 

But the manner in which Younis Khan marshalled his players to win a difficult match has changed the mood to a great extent with regular skipper Inzamam-ul Haq also acknowledging the effort of the players. 

A newspaper reported that Musharraf had personally called up Younis and also spoken to Man of the Match Abdul Razzaq to congratulate them on their fine show on Tuesday night. 

Former Test captain Javed Miandad also praised the grit showed by the team. I think they knew that the only way to redeem Pakistan cricket in the eyes of the public was to win this match. I think they did well to bat sensibly and keep their cool till the end. 

PCB official Saleem Altaf said the win had come at a good time. Obviously when the team does well it lifts everyones mood. I thought they showed character winning this match after the scandals that have rocked the team, Altaf said. (PTI)

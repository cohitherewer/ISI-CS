Calcutta: Captain Rahul Dravid, his teammate Yuvraj Singh as well as Anjum Chopra of the womens team are the Indians left in the fray after shortlisting of players for the ICC Awards, to be announced in Mumbai on November 3. 

Dravid winner of the Cricketer of the Year and Test Player of the Year awards in 2004 is in the running for the Captain of the Year honour while Yuvraj scorer of 1,496 runs in the period under consideration for the awards is in contention for the ODI Player of the Year award. 

According to an ICC media release, Team India are in the fray for the Spirit of Cricket award while Chopra is vying for honours in the Womens Cricketer of the Year category. Both these awards are new. 

While Dravid was in the long list of nominees for Test and ODI Cricketer of the Year as well as Cricketer of the Year awards, Irfan Pathan was in the first list for ODI Player of the Year award along with Yuvraj. 

Names of the shortlisted players were released by ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed at a media conference in Mumbai on Sunday. 

Wicketkeeper Mahendra Singh Dhoni controversially left out from the preliminary list once again found himself out of the running, though there was a provision for the panel to add names to the original list in various categories. 

 Anjum and Yuvraj 

Speed informed that two more categories of awards to add to the eight for which players and teams have already been shortlisted the Test Team of the Year and the ODI Team of the Year, would be declared at the awards function. 

Australia captain Ricky Ponting has been nominated in four categories. Pakistan fast bowler Mohammad Asif, who has tested positive for the performanceenhancing steroid nandrolone, is among four players nominated for the Emerging Player of the Year award. 

Speed said that Asif was still eligible for the awards because his performances came before his doping offence.

Melbourne: Lindsay Davenport lost her No. 1 ranking after being knocked out of the Australian Open on Tuesday while unseeded Cypriot Marcos Baghdatis extended his extraordinary run to reach the last four. 

Eighth seed Justine Henin-Hardenne beat Davenport 2-6, 6-2, 6-3 to join Maria Sharapova in the semi-finals and ensure Kim Clijsters, or possibly Amelie Mauresmo, takes over as the new No. 1 when the next rankings are released on Monday. 

A former world junior No. 1 currently ranked 54th, Baghdatis followed his shock win over seed No. 2 Andy Roddick with a gritty 6-4, 6-2, 4-6, 3-6, 6-3 victory over seventh seed Ivan Ljubicic of Croatia. The Cypriot played superbly in the first two sets, unleashing his full range of shots to grab a two-set lead before Ljubicic fought back to win the next two and force the match into a decider. 

Baghdatis fended off two break points in a tense third game, then ripped a cross-court forehand past Ljubicic to gain the decisive break in the next game. 

Sharapova, seeded fourth in the womens draw, booked her place in the semi-finals for the second year in a row with a 7-6, 6-4 win over Nadia Petrova in an all-Russian affair. 

Davenport said she was more disappointed at missing another opportunity to win the Open than losing the top ranking.

 Sourav to get a fair deal

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: National selector Bhupinder Singh believes Sourav Ganguly will get a fair deal when the squad for the one-dayers is picked in Mumbai on January 29. 

Sourav will obviously feature in our discussions when the meeting is held. No unfair deal will be meted out to him, he said during a chat at the Eden on Friday. 

Singh, who was in Lahore during the opening Test, said personally he was not in favour of makeshift openers. The decision was taken after considering the circumstances. The importance of specialist openers in Tests can never be ignored.

 Jeev Milkha tied 57th

Okayama (Japan): Ace Indian golfer Jeev Milkha Singh was lying tied 57th after an opening round card of one-under 71 in the KSB Munsingwear Open here on Thursday. 

Riding on a streak of good finishes, Jeev had a modest round, with four birdies, one bogey and one double bogey. 

Meanwhile, strong wind and tough conditions played spoilsport as the day turned out to be a mediocre one for the Indians at the Macau Open on Thursday. 

The best score from the Indians came from Rahil Gangjee and Digvijay Singh, who posted 73 each for tied 47th place, adds another report from Macau. (PTI)

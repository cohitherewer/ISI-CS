The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Hingis presence will inspire 

 youngsters

 - Looking forward to a hattrick of titles on Indian soil 

 with Liezel 

 Daring Strokes

 Sania Mirza

Calcutta is a sports-crazy city and it is wonderful 

 to be back here for the Sunfeast Open. The atmosphere of 

 the Netaji Indoor Stadium is electric and Im looking 

 forward to playing in front of the knowledgeable home crowd. 

 The presence of the amazing Martina 

 Hingis has added a lot of colour and excitement to an already 

 popular tournament and the youngsters in the crowd are certain 

 to be inspired by watching the skills of this legendary 

 player in flesh and blood. 

Martinas re-emergence as a major force is the story of the year on the WTA circuit. To come back after such a long break and get into the top 10 within a year is a tribute to Martinas physical prowess and phenomenal talent.

 My own second year on the professional circuit has been a mixed bag of experience. I never expected the year to be easy and it certainly wasnt! I have had to grow up quickly in a professional world where a small chink in the armour is ruthlessly exploited by masters of the game, who also play for a living. 

However, contrary to what a few people seem to imagine, I consider the year 2006 to be a reasonable year for me on the circuit though, I could and should have won a few more matches, for sure. 

Though my ranking has slipped out of the top 50, I dont think I was ever blown away while competing day after day against the best in the world. 

My singles victories over the likes of Flavia Pennetta, Katarina Srebotnik, Karolina Sprem and Meghann Shaughnessy were significant for me and the close matches against Elena Dementieva, Patty Schnyder and Jelena Jankovic not only taught me a lot but also gave me hope for the future. 

This certainly has been my breakthrough year as far as doubles is concerned and the amazing part has been that I have managed to produce exciting results with different partners in various tournaments. 

Im happy to be partnering Liezel Huber of South Africa again. We have a pretty good record together, winning two out of two titles in India and an appearance in a Tour final in Amelia Island, United States. 

We also played together at the US Open and lost a close three-setter in the pre-quarter finals. Im looking forward to the opportunity of making it a hattrick of wins on Indian soil with Liezel! 

 The singles draw for the Sunfeast 

 Open has pitted me against a qualifier, my comptariot Rushmi 

 Chakravarthy, in the first round. A lot of armchair critics 

 have the wrong notion that a qualifier is the easiest player 

 to play against in a tournament but I can assure you from 

 personal experience that this is far from the truth. 

 A qualifier comes with the confidence 

 of a couple of wins under the belt and the experience gained 

 from having already pulled out two matches in the prevailing 

 court conditions is a definite advantage. I have been on 

 both sides of the coin and so I know! 

Over a year and a half ago, it was the crowd in Hyderabad that inspired me to bring about a dramatic turnaround in my career with a historic WTA title win. 

 Im hoping that my supporters 

 in this glorious sporting city of Calcutta will stand by 

 me when I need some wins again to bring cheer to the people 

 of my country.

 Players of Indian origin on AIFF radar

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: The AIFF has finally decided to start the process of acquiring the services of footballers of Indian origin from different countries to strengthen the national team. 

According to AIFF sources, national coach Bob Houghton on Friday had a meeting with AIFF president Priya Ranjan Das Munshi in Goa and urged him to scout a few quality footballers of Indian origin from overseas and induct them into the national team. He also told Das Munshi that Michael Chopra, who is currently playing in England, could be invited to play for India. 

Chopra, who played for Premiership side Newcastle United, has now joined Cardiff City, who are participating in a four-nation tournament in Vancouver where India is taking part next month. 

Das Munshi, AIFF sources said, has asked Houghton to talk to Chopra during the tournament and try to convince him. Houghton might also talk to another footballer of India origin ? Prince Rajcomar from The Netherlands. The FC Den Bosch striker has played for The Netherlands at the U-20 World Cup and has been regularly among goals. 

Only Indian passport holders can play for the national team, although rule changes now allow those of Indian origin to acquire one. According to Fifa rules, players with dual citizenship or nationality who have not played international soccer above the U-23 level are eligible to apply to change the country they represent. 

 Meanwhile, Indian skipper Bhaichung Bhutia is likely to join the camp immediately after the World Cup, AIFF sources said.

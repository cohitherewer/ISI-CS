 Randhawa lifts crown, bags Shanghai berth

 - RCGC to sponsor Chowrasia for Asian Tour events 

 Jyoti Randhawa after winning the Indian Open in New Delhi on Monday 

New Delhi: Jyoti Randhawa used his experience and newly-acquired relaxed attitude on Monday to beat Shiv Shankar Prasad Chowrasia in the second play-off hole of the Hero Honda Indian Open Golf Tournament which was extended to the fifth day here. 

Randhawa, the Indian Open winner in 2000, birdied the play-off hole which was played on the 18th after Chowrasia missed an eight-footer for birdie at the Delhi Golf Club course. 

The match lasted only 10 minutes this morning as Randhawa birdied and Chowrasia only parred after it was extended to Monday for the first time after fading light forced the game to be stopped on Sunday. 

This was Randhawas first Asian Tour title in two years. The win also earned Randhawa a berth in the $5 million HSBC Champions Tournament in Shanghai next month. He will be the fourth Indian to earn a berth in it. 

Others three are Shiv Kapur, who got it after winning the Volvo Masters in December 2005, Jeev Milkha Singh on winning Volvo China Open in April and Gaurav Ghei in Mecuries Masters in September. 

I thought about my missed four-footer on Sunday and couldnt sleep last night. But I also realised that I had started thinking about the win, rather than doing my job, which was to putt. That cost me, Randhawa said after his sixth Asian Tour title. 

It is very emotional to win the Indian Open once again and especially after such an exciting battle. I must thank my family, my father, my wife (Tina) and all friends who came on Monday morning to see this finish, he said. 

Randhawa, who also has Asian Tour title from Japan Tour (one), and four of them in India, said Chowrasia had a right attitude and would have his chances. Chowrasia is younger and he will have his chances. he said. 

Chowrasia, who has had a great season and is 36th on the money list in his rookie year on Asia Tour, said, I did not get tense and I slept well. I was relaxed. I am happy with the way I played. I know that my chance will come. 

The promising youngster said he would be sponsored by RCGC for the coming Asian Tour events. That takes a lot of pressure away. Overall I played well this season and I know I can compete with the best in Asia. I want to play in Asia for two more years and then try and play in Japan, said Chowrasia. (Agencies)

 Advani exits, Chandra up

 World Snooker 

New Delhi: National champion Manan Chandra made his maiden entry into the mens quarter finals of the IBSF World Snooker Championship in Amman, Jordan, while his more fancied compatriot Pankaj Advani bowed out of the elite competition. 

Chandra got the better of Andrew Pagett of Wales 5-3 to move into the last eight stage. The Indian got a superb start in the first frame and went on to win the tie 75-0, 46-23, 4-63, 29-74, 91-0, 67-12, 34-76, 79-11. 

He will next meet Craig Steadman of England. 

Advani, a former champion, lost 3-5 to Daniel Ward of England in the pre-quarters. 

In the womens section, Anuja Thakur created a flutter by advancing to the semi-finals in her maiden appearance in the premier tournament. Thakur defeated Kathy Parashis of Australia 4-1, scoring 37-68, 57-33, 74-30, 58-7, 65-42. 

In the Masters section, Devender Joshi reached the semi-finals by thrashing Danny Moermans of Belgium 4-1 while compatriot Geet Sethi was crushed by Pakistans Mohammad Yusuf 0-4 in another match.

New Delhi: The Bangalore-based HASC will replace Tata Football Academy (TFA) in the National Football League beginning on January 7 next. 

This was decided by the All India Football Federation (AIFF) president Priya Ranjan Das Munshi after an informal meeting with a section of the executive committee members in Calcutta on Monday. 

Goas Salgaocar Club, who got relegated from the NFL last season, were also in contention to replace TFA, but did not find favour with majority of the members. 

A decision to this effect will only be officially announced in the formal meeting of the executive committee, to be held in Goa on November 24.

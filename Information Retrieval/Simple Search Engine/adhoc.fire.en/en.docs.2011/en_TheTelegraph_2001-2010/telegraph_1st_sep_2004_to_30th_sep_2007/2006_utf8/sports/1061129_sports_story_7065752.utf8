The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Stars win a story of Perfection 

 STAR RACER

 Last Sundays fillies Classic, the Calcutta 1000 Guineas, turned out to be a close contest between the two strongly fancied runners trainer Vijay Singhs Amorina and Star Perfection from Daniel Davids yard. Expectations were very high from Amorina who hadnt done anything wrong since she returned from the south after an inspiring performance against Real Excellence, a proven Classic filly. 

 Star Perfection, too, had her share of success against meritorious rivals, and at the major turf centres. What really tilted scales in favour of the Perfection was her greater past experience against the tested opponents.

 In the Guineas, Amorina was taken to the front her customary style right after the start with a three-length lead, while the Perfection was held back in third for a brief while. Jockey C. Alford applied no pressure on the 6-10 favourite even as Colm Donoghue brought Star Perfection within a length and half of the leader from the halfway mark. It was only below the distance-post that Amorina came under pressure as the Perfection appeared to be gaining advantage over her. 

 The one-length lead established by the Perfection in the last 150m was stoutly defended by the visiting jockey, despite Alfords effort to narrow it down, albeit marginally. 

 It was the last time Donoghue had beaten Alford in the afternoons six-event card. In the 1,400m Mayfowl Cup, Alford rode a well-judged race on Aperitivo, though the slated trip was considered to be tailormade for Daniels Rasalas, and quite sharp for the Vijays trainee. Alford had the topweighted horse settled in fourth, right behind Rasalas, and improved when his rival made his move. Rasalas, though, went into a-length lead in the home stretch, it was no contest the moment Alford brought Aperitivo alongside the leader.

 Bright Blossoms significant weight advantage over Diffidence (Donighue up) made a big difference that helped the former win the Aphroze Cup for Alford. 

 Alford, on Robin Corners baby, Monticello, was, however, at his best in the Angeles Plate. He timed his challenge to perfection and snatched the verdict from the favourite, Canterbury Rocks ridden by Imran Chisty.

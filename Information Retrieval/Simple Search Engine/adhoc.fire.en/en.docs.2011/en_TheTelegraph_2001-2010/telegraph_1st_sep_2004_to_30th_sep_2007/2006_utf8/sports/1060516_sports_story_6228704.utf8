 Chelsea better than United: Ballack 

London: Germany midfielder Michael Ballack says he chose to sign for Chelsea instead of Manchester United because the English champions are a better team. 

The 29-year-old was unveiled by Chelsea on Monday after arriving from Bayern Munich on a free transfer. He signed a three-year contract with the club owned by Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich, winners of the last two Premier League titles. 

Manchester United came in quite early for me but really I saw the possibilities of Chelsea as being much greater, the playmaker and Germany captain told a news conference. 

They are a stronger team and also London has its attractions, particularly as a family man. And in the final analysis it was Chelseas aims that attracted me. 

Just look at the achievements of the club in the last two years, winning the title twice, and you can see what a super team they are. 

Also you have to consider the competition they are playing in. Liverpool won the Champions League last year and Arsenal are in the final again this week. This shows the strength of the league in England.

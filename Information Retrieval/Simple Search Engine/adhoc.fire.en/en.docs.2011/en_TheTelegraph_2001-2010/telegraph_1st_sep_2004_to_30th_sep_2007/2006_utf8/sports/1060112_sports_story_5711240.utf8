 Sethi, Advani in pre-quarters

Chennai: Seven time world champion Geet Sethi performed under pressure to recover from the jaws of elimination and storm into the pre-quarter finals of the LIC-BSNL National Billiards and Snooker Championships here on Wednesday night. 

Among others, world IBSF billiards champion Pankaj Advani topped the league players with a plus of 3,576 points, followed by Sourav Kothari of PSPB with 1,495 points, to emerge as the top two seeds in the knockout stage. 

Advanis run so far has been phenomenal as he tallied 4,519 points from five matches, and his rivals could only muster 938 points against him.

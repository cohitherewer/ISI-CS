Calcutta: Deep Dasgupta is still not willing to look beyond the Ranji Trophy semi-final on Monday. With a day still remaining at the Eden, the Bengal captain was trying to control his emotions and concentrate on the job at hand. 

With Baroda resigned to their fate, his teammates, though, have already shifted their focus to Kanpur for the final against Uttar Pradesh. At stumps, the CAB officials were busy finalising the teams travel plans (they are scheduled to leave on Friday), while the players tried to gather vital statistics and information on the Green Park pitch and Uttar Pradeshs strengths and weaknesses. 

Bengal were bundled out for 619, 23 minutes after lunch, a mammoth 378-run lead. Laxmi Ratan Shukla left in the fifth over of the day after adding just four runs to his overnight score. Sourashish Lahiri and Shiv Sagar Singh added 90 for the eighth wicket, but Irfan Pathan came up with an inspired spell after lunch to hasten Bengals doom. 

Sourashish (62 off 124 balls, 7x4) and Shiv Sagar (40 .. off 115 balls, 6x4) played with poise and patience. There was nothing in the wicket or bowling to trouble them, and they made full use of the conditions. But for Baroda, Pathans spell came a bit too late. 

Baroda youngsters ? Pinal Shah and Rakesh Solanki ? found it hard to cope with the pressure, but Connor Williams and Jacob Martin held fort. The third wicket pair has added 71 runs so far, but it will take a huge effort from the remaining batsmen to deny Bengal an outright victory. The visitors still need 277 to make Bengal bat again. 

The ball is turning but very slowly ? Lets see how the morning session goes ? If the batsmen apply themselves, they can hope to last the final day, a cautious Deep said. 

Bengal will also take the opportunity to work on their bowling and fielding inadequacies. We have dropped a few catches and there have also been occasions when we havent bowled to our plan, Deep lamented. 

Ranadeb Bose and Shib Shankar Paul bowled well in spells. Their probing line and seam movement put the batsmen in trouble, but they lacked consistency. The spinners havent been threatening either, though, Shiv Sagar was denied longer spells. 

The good thing is that Shukla has started to bowl again, and that gives Bengal more options. He may not be as talented as Ranadeb or Paul, but his aggression and dour attitude certainly puts him in good stead. 

The fielding has swung from the average to the ordinary. The physical fitness of the players has improved manifold, but it hasnt always reflected on their on-field show. 

While slip catching hasnt been of the highest standard, it will still take a while to hide a Paul in the outfield. Avishek Jhunjhunwala and Manoj Tewari have, however, been notable exceptions. 

Paras Mhambrey will have a few days to work on their shortcomings ahead of the final. The coach has done wonders to the side as has been visible right through the season. An enterprising show in the final will be the icing on the cake.

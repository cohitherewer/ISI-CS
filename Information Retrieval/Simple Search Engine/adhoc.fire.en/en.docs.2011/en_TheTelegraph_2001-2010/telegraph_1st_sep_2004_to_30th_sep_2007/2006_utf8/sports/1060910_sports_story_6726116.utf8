New York: Maria Sharapova will shoot for her first US Open title after upsetting world No. 1 Amelie Mauresmo in the semi-finals on Friday. 

 Defending champion Roger Federer crushed Nikolay Davydenko 

 6-1, 7-5, 6-4 on Saturday to reach the US Open final. The 

 world No. 1 eliminated the Russian seventh seed in one hour 

 43 minutes to become the first man in the Open Era to reach 

 six straight Grand Slam finals. 

Sharapova will face Justine Henin-Hardenne, who reached her fourth Grand Slam final of the year by beating 19th-seeded Serbian Jelena Jankovic 4-6, 6-4, 6-0 (as reported in Saturdays Late City edition). 

Third seed Sharapova struck 20 winners, double the number from her opponent, to win 6-0, 4-6, 6-0 and reach the second Grand Slam final of her career. 

I thought I played really smart, the Russian said. I wasnt making errors at the wrong times. I started off the match really well. I put pressure on her. I took my chances. 

Mauresmo, the Wimbledon and Australian Open champion, played a miserable first set and won just seven points in the third before admitting she was suffering from tiredness. 

But give all the credit to her, the 27-year-old Frenchwoman said. She played a good match. I didnt play the way I wanted to. Even when I won the second set, I didnt really feel like things were going the way I wanted them to. 

When the top seed secured her only service break in the last game of the second set, she leaped in the air and pumped her fist but she was unable to keep the momentum going. 

It was tough to get broken in that last game of the second set, the 19-year-old Sharapova said. She just played some good tennis. But I hung in there. 

Five-time Grand Slam winner Henin-Hardenne has a 4-1 record against Sharapova and has beaten her four times in a row. 

I had a terrible record against Amelie (0-3) and that ended today, Sharapova said. And I have a terrible record against Justine. 

So I hope thats a good luck charm at the Open and I will turn it around tomorrow. 

Appearing in her first Grand Slam semi-final, the 21-year-old Jankovic played aggressively and took advantage of a sub-par performance by Henin-Hardenne to lead by a set and 4-2. 

But after double-faulting on her serve for a 5-2 lead, nerves got the better of the Serbian who lost 10 straight games and the match. 

I was pretty nervous at the beginning of the match. I wasnt in good rhythm, said the Belgian second seed, who will supplant Mauresmo as world No. 1 if she beats Sharapova. She was playing terrific at that time. She was just on fire. 

But the 24-year-old said that when she trimmed Jankovics second-set lead to 5-4 she felt much better. 

I was feeling free, she said. I was playing my game. In the third set, I played really well. I came back a little bit from nowhere, but its the kind of match that I probably would have lost in the past. 

An emotional Jankovic said she self-destructed after arguing with the chair umpire over a line call and watching Henin-Hardenne hold her back in apparent pain. 

I dont know what she was doing, but she was acting like she had pain in her back, and she was trying to start me thinking or something. 

I was looking at her, and she was, Oh, I have pain in my back. Thats the time when she was losing. Then when she was winning, all of a sudden shes hitting the biggest serves ever. 

Jankovic, however, admitted that losing her concentration was her own fault. 

Ill learn from my mistakes, she said.I am young and I hope the next time I wont make the same mistake.

 1930s: A new world order

 URUGUAY 1930 

 As holders of the Olympic title 

 and the fact that 1930 marked its 100 years of independence, 

 the Fifa Congress in Barcelona (May 18, 1929) chose Uruguay 

 to host the first tournament. Although the news was greeted 

 enthusiastically in all football-playing countries, many 

 European nations harboured reservations about the prospect 

 of crossing the Atlantic. Thus, more and more European associations 

 broke their promise to participate.

 Two months before the tournament 

 was due to commence not a single European country had entered 

 the competition. Thanks to Jules Rimets personal efforts, 

 at least four delegations, Belgium, France, Yugoslavia and 

 Romania, set sail on June 21, 1930 from Villefranche-Sur-Mer 

 with the liner Conte Verde reaching Rio de Janeiro 

 on 29 June, where they picked up the Brazilian squad and 

 arrived in Montevideo on July 4. The organisation of the 

 first World Cup looked rather different from todays 

 with no qualifying competition, the 13 teams entered by 

 invitation and the final draw was not made until the teams 

 arrived in Uruguay. 

 Did You Know? 

 The matches between France and Mexico as well 

 as the USA and Belgium kicked off the meet on July 13, 

 1930. Frances Laurent scored the first goal of the 

 World Cup, in the 19th minute against Mexico. France went 

 on to win 4-1, while the USA trounced Belgium 3-0. 

 The first final was contested by the hosts and 

 neighbours Argentina. After trailing 1-2 at the interval, 

 Uruguay went on to prevail 4-2 lifting the Cup, which 

 had been designed by French sculptor Abel Lafleur. 

 Fifa president Jules Rimet presented the Victoire 

 aux Ailes dOr trophy, a statuette 30cm high, 

 made of gold and weighing 4 kg, to Uruguayan captain Jos? 

 Nazassi. Celebrations in Montevideo went on for several 

 days and the day after the famous victory, July 31, was 

 proclaimed a national holiday.

 Off-side

 The referee officiating the France-Argentina match had 

 blown the final whistle six minutes early. But after fierce 

 protests, he recalled the players to the field, some of 

 whom were already in the shower! 

 There still seems to be a difference of opinion on who 

 scored the first World Cup hattrick: while Fifa and a 

 number of other sources give Americas Bertram Patenaude 

 the honour of having done so on July 17, 1930, against 

 Paraguay, others say it was Guillermo Stabile of Argentina 

 with three goals two days later against Mexico. 

 The World Cup took place in a single city, Montevideo, 

 at its three stadiums (Centenario, Pocitos and Parque 

 Central). The tournament in Spain in 1982, with 24 teams 

 participating for the first time, was held in no less 

 than 14 cities and used 17 stadia to stage the 52 matches. 

 ITALY 1934

 When Italy, one of the unsuccessful 

 applicants for the honour of staging the inaugural tournament, 

 was chosen to host the second World Cup, Uruguay declined 

 to participate and defend the title, as a retort to many 

 withdrawals of European teams four years earlier. Other 

 South American nations, such as Argentina and Brazil, also 

 did not send their best teams to Italy. Staged between May 

 27 and June 10, 1934, this World Cup was markedly more encouraging 

 than its forerunner. Thirty-two nations took part so that 

 a preliminary round was necessary (even the hosts, Italy, 

 had to qualify), and eventually, 16 teams qualified for 

 the finals. 

 Did You Know? 

 Argentina, Austria, Brazil, Czechoslovakia, 

 Germany, Holland, Hungary and Italy were seeded teams. 

 Italy started their campaign with a 7-1 victory over the 

 US, with Schiavio scoring a hattrick. His third goal ? 

 the teams fifth ? happened to be the 100th in World 

 Cup history. 

 Italy beat Austria 1-0 while Czechoslovakia 

 coasted to a 3-1 victory over Germany in the semi-finals. 

 The final was also a meeting between two of 

 the best goalkeepers of all time, Gianpiero Combi and 

 Frantisek Planicka. Both conceded a goal in regular playing 

 time, and in extra time Italy got another to win 2-1. 

 Combi stuck to the plan he made the day before the final 

 and carried out his intention to retire immediately from 

 football. 

 Off-side 

 Italian defender Allemandi received his winners 

 medal after seven years because he was banned for life 

 in a match-fixing scandal.

 The fascists made political use of the tournament to 

 the hilt. In the opening match, involving Italy and USA, 

 the players and even the referee and linesmen gestured 

 straight-arm salutes to Mussolini who was present at the 

 stadium. 

 Atilio Demaria and Luis Monti played for Argentina in 

 1930, but played for Italy in 1934 . 

 FRANCE 1938

 Amidst the First World War clouds 

 looming large over Europe, France became the third host 

 country of the World Cup. Austria qualified, but when Germany 

 annexed Austria, the latter decided to withdraw ? though 

 some of their players appeared in the colours of Germany. 

 Spain was ravaged by civil war. Argentina and Uruguay also 

 stayed away. 

 Brazil and Poland produced one 

 of the greatest games of all time in Strasbourg with the 

 South Americans triumphing 6-5 after extra time, thanks 

 to four goals from Leonidas who played barefoot for a spell. 

 Sadly, the quarter final at Bordeaux between Brazil and 

 Czechoslovakia ended in an all-out brawl: three players 

 were sent off and five injured, two of whom were rushed 

 to hospital with broken limbs. In the final, Italy beat 

 Hungary 4-2 in Paris. And for the first time the host nation 

 and the holders qualified automatically, a privilege which 

 will end after the upcoming meet in Germany. 

 Did You Know?

 France defeated Belgium (3-1), thanks largely 

 to its right-winger Fred Aston, known as the will--the-wisp, 

 whose bursting forays to the bye line were decisive. Unhappily 

 for the 58,455 supporters crammed into the Yves-du-Manoir 

 Stadium at Colombes, near Paris, for the quarter final, 

 France went down 1-3 to Italy. 

 Unlike Uruguay and Italy in the two previous 

 competitions, France would not lift the World Cup played 

 on their own soil. 

 Hungary whipped Sweden 5-1 and Italy edged past 

 Brazil 2-1 to set up the summit clash. A highly athletic 

 Italy easily subdued Hungary 4-2, with Colaussi and Piola 

 scoring a brace each for the winners. 

 Off-side

 The Italy-Brazil semi-final promised to be the final 

 before the event itself, until the Brazilian coach Adheniar 

 Pimenta made a gross error of judgement and decided to 

 leave out two key players, most notably Leonidas. I 

 am resting him for the final, declared Pimenta. 

 Leonidas, however, had some consolation prize when he 

 won the Golden Shoe Award with 8 goals. 

 In the Brazil versus Czechoslovakia match ? which was 

 held 1-1 ? three players were sent-off. This dubious feat 

 was equalled in the Brazil-Hungary clash in 1954 and Denmark 

 versus Saudi Arabia in 1998.

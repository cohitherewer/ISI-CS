 Pariyar carries Bengal forward

 Santosh Trophy 

 Vimal Pariyar gets 

 past a Services defender on Thursday. A Telegraph picture 

 Faridabad: Vimal Pariyar 

 is on a roll in the Santosh Trophy here. On Thursday, the 

 Tata Football Academy-trained striker scored his eighth 

 goal of the tournament to steer Bengal past Services at 

 the Sector 12 Stadium on Thursday.

 The 1-0 victory that earned the 

 29-time champions a place in the quarter-final league, came 

 after 120 minutes of dogged fight that had Bengal at the 

 receiving end for most of the time. The former champions 

 were definitely lucky to end the regulation time on equal 

 terms and pull off the winner a minute before the end of 

 30 minutes of extra time.

 The goal came at a time when everyone 

 around was getting ready for the shootout. Even the Services 

 coach Stanley Rozario brought in his second goalkeeper Anil 

 Kumar, a penalty-kick specialist in place of Robikanta Singh.

 Kumar, however, did not survive 

 till the tie-breaker. As substitute Lalhmangaih Zuala dashed 

 through the right to send the ball at the goalmouth, Pariyar 

 ran past the defender to place in with his left. 

 To selectors, he is not good enough 

 for the senior national team. The under-20 coach Islam Akhmedov 

 is not too happy with his showings in the SAF Games. But 

 for Bengal, Pariyar has been an asset. 

 Two others who made things possible 

 for Bengal were skipper Sandip Nandy and young defender 

 Shyam Mondal. When Prasanta Banerjees experimentation 

 with Crispin Chhetri as the central midfielder failed flat 

 on its nose in less than half an hour, Nandy and Mondal 

 kept Bengal flag flying with some incredible saves and tackles.

 For the first half hour, Services 

 were a rampaging lot. The Bengal defence was in tatters 

 though Services could not convert their supremacy into goals. 

 They paid heavily for it.

 In Gurgaon, hosts Haryana made 

 the quarter-final league with a 1-0 win over Meghalaya. 

 Pradeep scored the winner.

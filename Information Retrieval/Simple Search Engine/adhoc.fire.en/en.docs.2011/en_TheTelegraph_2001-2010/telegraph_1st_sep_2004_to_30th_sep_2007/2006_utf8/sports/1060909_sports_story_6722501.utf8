London: Englands lesser lights turned the tables on Pakistans Big Three at Trent Bridge on Friday to keep alive their hopes of levelling their one-day International series. 

 England, in reply, were 38 for one after 10 overs. 

 Andrew Strauss (25) and Ian Bell (0) were at the crease. 

 Mohammed Asif dismissed Ed Joyce for 13. 

Inzamam-ul Haq, Mohammed Yousuf and Younis Khan, the bedrock of the Pakistan batting order, all failed to produce commanding performances as the touring side, 2-0 up in the five-match series, were restricted to 235 for eight after opting to bat first in the day-nighter. 

Englands top performers were the unlikely duo of seamer Jon Lewis, who has never established himself in the side, and part-time spinner Michael Yardy. Lewis took two for 49 while Yardy, bowling rapid, flat left-arm spin on his debut, found turn and bounce to take three for 24 off 10 overs. 

Pakistan would have fared far worse but for allrounder Abdul Razzaq, who flailed an extraordinary 75 runs off 72 balls, including five sixes off the final two overs, to get his side past 200. Englands last four overs went for 69. 

Lewis had Mohammed Hafeez and Younis Khan caught in the slip cordon in his first two overs to reduce Pakistan to 17 for two. Younis, having made a match-winning century in the previous game, went for a six-ball duck.

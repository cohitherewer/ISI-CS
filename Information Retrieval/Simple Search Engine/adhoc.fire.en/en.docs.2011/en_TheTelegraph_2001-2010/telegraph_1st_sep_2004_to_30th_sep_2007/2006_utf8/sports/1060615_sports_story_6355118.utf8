 Thugs harass Indians in Belfast

Belfast: A group of teenage Indian cricketers were chased and threatened by racist thugs in Belfast City Centre, and police on Wednesday said they are investigating a racist motive to the incident. 

The young tourists, who were in Northern Ireland as members of an under-19 cricket tour, were terrified by the incident, according to a report in a London daily. 

Five of the tourists were chased by up to 16 youths as they walked around the city on Sunday, while a house in which some of them were staying was stoned. 

Nobody is believed to have been hurt in the incidents. 

Politicians condemned the attack saying it confirmed Belfasts reputation as Europes racist capital. (PTI)

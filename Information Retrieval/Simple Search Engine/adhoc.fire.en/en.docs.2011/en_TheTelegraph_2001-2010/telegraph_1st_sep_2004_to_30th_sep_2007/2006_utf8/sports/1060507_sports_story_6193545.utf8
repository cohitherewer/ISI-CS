 20th Bundesliga crown for Bayern

Frankfurt: Bayern Munich won the German title for the 20th time and completed an historic double when closest rivals Hamburg SV were beaten 4-2 at Hertha Berlin on Saturday. 

Bayern could only manage a 1-1 draw at Kaiserslautern but Hamburgs failure to get the win they needed left them six points off the pace with one game left. 

Felix Magaths side become the first to successfully defend a Bundesliga and German Cup double, after beating Eintracht Frankfurt 1-0 in the Cup final in Berlin last Saturday. 

Thats four titles in two years now, Magath told reporters. I dont think weve made too many big mistakes. 

Hamburgs surprise defeat against 10-man Hertha means they are in danger of missing out on second spot and automatic entry to the Champions League. 

Third-placed Werder Bremen won 6-0 at home to relegated Cologne to close within a point of Hamburg. Tim Borowski, Miroslav Klose and Ivan Klasnic scored two apiece in the rout. (Reuters)

 BCCI hits back at Speed 

- What the ICC cheif executive did is gross intererence in the affairs of the Indian board, says Professor Shetty 

Mumbai: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) on Thursday hit back at International Cricket Council (ICC) chief executive Malcolm Speed, accusing him of interfering in its affairs and deriding Indian cricket. 

In a strongly-worded statement, BCCIs chief administrative officer Prof. Ratnakar Shetty also challenged Speed by asking whether he will have the guts to say that the England and Wales Cricket Board is not running its affairs well because England have never won the World Cup. 

What Speed did by talking about the status of Indian cricket and the performance is nothing but gross interference in the affairs of the Indian board. 

In any case, I wonder how much does he actually know about the stakeholders in Indian cricket to take such swipes from time to time? Speed has chosen the wrong time and wrong place to debunk Indian cricket and its stakeholders, Prof. Shetty pointed out. 

The media conference in Mohali on Wednesday was ostensibly called for the president of the International Cricket Council Percy Sonn to interact with the Indian media, but it was hijacked by the irrepressible ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed. Speed, for the umpteenth time, harangued the Indian board. This time he went a step further, deriding the entire Indian cricket itself, Prof. Shetty remarked. 

Significantly, the war of words between the two parties has been renewed just prior to the two-day ICC executive board meeting here, scheduled from Friday, and in which the members participation agreement, which the BCCI has refused to sign in its present form, will come up for discussion. 

The BCCI rejoinder came a day after Speed had criticised BCCI, saying sports organizations are not judged by the amount of money they possessed, but on the basis of the performance of the team that they represent. 

I have an old-fashioned view about sports organisations. I do not judge on how much money they have in their bank accounts. I judge them on three things their performance on the field, how well they look after their stakeholders (associations) and how their resources, that is the population, is utilised, Speed had said in Mohali on Wednesday.

 from a form of viral meningitis, the Primera Liga club said 

 on Thursday. The 26-year-old, a key player in Argentine 

 coach Jose Pekermans World Cup plans, was admitted 

 to hospital on Wednesday after complaining of fever and 

 headaches.

 Subsequent tests confirmed that

 clear made it clear that Aimar had a benign form of meningitis 

 that will not have any permanent consequences and was not 

 contagious. 

 Roque on course 

 London: Roque Santa Cruz, 

 the Paraguay forward, is on course to be fit for this summers 

 World Cup after playing in Bayern Munichs last two 

 matches. The 24-year-old sustained a cruciate ligament injury 

 to his right knee in October 2005, but has returned to action 

 well ahead of schedule. 

 I am delighted to be back 

 playing again. Everything is going faster than I expected, 

 said Santa Cruz. I did not expect to come back so 

 soon. It is getting better day by day and my confidence 

 is growing so I am not afraid to go into tackles anymore.

 Yorke at helm

 London: Trinidad amp; 

 Tobago coach Leo Beenhakker has named a provisional 24-man 

 squad for the World Cup in Germany.

 Waiting game

 London: Alan Curbishley, 

 the Charlton Athletic manager, has again called for a decision 

 on the next England manager to be made soon. Curbishley 

 is in the frame to succeed Sven-Goran Eriksson when the 

 Swede steps down after the summers World Cup, but 

 he admits he is not happy with the continuing speculation. 

 Curbishley said in a television 

 interview: They need to so something probably the 

 sooner the better. There is a lot of uncertainty and 

 that is not right. The so-called people in the frame have 

 all got jobs to do.

 West Indies staring at defeat 

 - Another fighting half-century by Dravid 

 Kingston: India took three 

 quick wickets during the post-lunch session on the third 

 day of the fourth and final Test against the West Indies 

 on Sunday. Sreesanth bagged two and Munaf Patel and Anil 

 Kumble one each as the hosts, chasing 269 for victory, went 

 into tea on 85 for four.

 At 2.45 am, the West Indies were on 144 for seven with Denesh 

 Ramdin batting on 11, accompanied by Jerome Taylor on 0. 

 Marlon Samuels (5) was the last man out. Earlier, Ramnaresh 

 Sarwan hit 51. Anil Kumble and Sreesanth took three wickets 

 each.

 The West Indies had seven overs to survive before lunch 

 but Chris Gayle, who made a duck in the first innings, bagged 

 a pair when he edged the second ball of the innings to second 

 slip.

 Sreesanth sent fellow opener Daren Ganga back to the pavilion 

 for 16 in the fourth over after lunch with a superb late-swinging 

 yorker that crashed into the off stump.

 The visitors claimed the vital wicket of captain Brian Lara 

 in the next over when Munaf cut a delivery back into the 

 left-hander, who had stayed in his crease while shuffling 

 across his stumps. Lara was adjudged leg-before for 11.

 The experienced Shivnarine Chanderpaul, who has enjoyed 

 considerable success against India in the past, then came 

 in but leg-spinner Kumble soon had him lbw for 13, the batsman 

 playing across.

 Ramnaresh Sarwan, after recovering from the bruised knee 

 that forced him to bat with a runner in the first innings, 

 steadied the ship and reached 31 not out by tea, with Dwayne 

 Bravo on 13.

 Sarwan and Bravo waged a determined battle in adding 39 

 runs for their unbroken fifth wicket partnership. 

 The pair lifted the hosts from a disastrous 56 for four 

 after speedster Sreesanth struck early blows, which were 

 followed up with crucial strikes by Munaf and Kumble.

 Seamer Corey Collymore completed his fourth five-wicket 

 haul while Taylor, who claimed his maiden fiver in the first 

 innings, returned figures of four for 45.

 India, resuming on 128 for six, were all out for 171 with 

 Collymore taking five in 24.1 overs. 

 That still left the West Indies with the daunting target 

 of 269 to win the Test and the series, which will not only 

 be the highest total of the match, but the most runs ever 

 scored at Sabina Park to win a Test.

 Captain Rahul Dravid, with a battling 68, again kept India 

 firmly in the picture after his second half century of the 

 game. 

 India, who resumed the third days play on 128 for 

 six, could add only 43 more runs. 

 Dravid, Indias vanguard of hope, was dismissed when 

 a Collymore delivery kept low. Collymore had earlier accounted 

 for Kumble (10) when he got the overnight batsman to edge 

 into the slip cordon.

 Dravid and Kumble added 19 runs for the seventh wicket, 

 which may not appear big but in the context of the game 

 was considerable.

 Harbhajan Singh struck a couple of hefty blows and Sreesanth 

 slogged a six over long on against Taylor but the end was 

 never far off.

 Sreesanth left first when he came down the track to Taylor 

 and then sparred a catch to Lara in slips.

 Harbhajan was the last man dismissed in a similar fashion 

 and it gave Lara his fifth catch of the match.

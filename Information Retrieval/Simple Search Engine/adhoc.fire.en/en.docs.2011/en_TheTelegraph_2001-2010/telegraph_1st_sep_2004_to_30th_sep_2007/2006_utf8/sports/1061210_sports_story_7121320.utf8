Of the other Bengal players, Diptayan Ghosh squandered his chances against G.V. Revant Reddy of Andhra Pradesh and lost the game in a same-coloured bishop ending in the 6th round. He went on to win his next game, against Aayush Jugele of Maharashtra, in a queen and minor piece ending. 

Aditya Chakraborty came back into reckoning by winning both his games and taking his tally to 5 points.

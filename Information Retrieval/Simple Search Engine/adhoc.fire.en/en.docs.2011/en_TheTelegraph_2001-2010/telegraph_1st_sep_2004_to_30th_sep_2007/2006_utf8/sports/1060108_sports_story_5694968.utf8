 Mahendra: Raj Singh should be recalled

 Ranbir Singh Mahendra

New Delhi: Former Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) president Ranbir Singh Mahendra on Saturday slammed Team India manager Raj Singh Dungarpur for his remarks against Sourav Ganguly and demanded his immediate recall from the tour of Pakistan. 

The Board president should intervene and Raj Singh should be recalled. He does not fit into the shoes of a manager, Mahendra told a TV channel. 

Meanwhile in Calcutta, taking strong exception to Raj Singhs attack on former captain Sourav, Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) president Jagmohan Dalmiya said he would raise the issue at the BCCIs working committee meeting. 

This is a serious matter. The issue would be raised in the working committee meeting, Dalmiya, also a former Board president, said. 

Mahendra said that it is no less than playing with the career of an individual. 

To say something repeatedly and then to retract later just lowers the morale of a individual, he said. People are playing with Souravs career and overall, they are playing with the team. 

Raj Singh earlier made a scathing attack on Sourav, describing him as the laziest and possibly the worst fielder in the Indian team. 

However, later on Saturday, Dungarpur sought to control the damage, saying the former captain was a tremendous batsman and his experience would help the team against Pakistan.

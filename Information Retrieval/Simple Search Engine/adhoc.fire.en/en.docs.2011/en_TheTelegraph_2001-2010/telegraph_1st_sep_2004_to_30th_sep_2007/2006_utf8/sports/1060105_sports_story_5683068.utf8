 Now, Nel victim of racial abuse 

Sydney: South Africa complained of another incident of racial abuse by a spectator against fast bowler Andre Nel during the third Test against Australia at the Sydney Cricket Ground on Wednesday. 

Nel, a white South African who was fielding close to the boundary, reported the incident to his captain Graeme Smith, who informed the umpires. They in turn reported it to Match Referee Chris Broad. 

All three Tests in the current series have been marred by racist incidents. 

None of the team minds any form of abuse because it happens in any country, the home side really gets behind it, South African coach Mickey Arthur said. 

Cricket Australia (CA) spokesman Peter Young reiterated that CA had a zero-tolerance policy towards racism, and had sent extra security staff to the section of the crowd but were unable to identify the culprit.

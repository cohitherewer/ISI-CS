 Parreira offer

Rio de Janeiro: Former Brazil coach Carlos Alberto Parreira said on Friday he had received an offer to coach 2010 World Cup hosts South Africa. 

Its an honour to receive an invitation from the South African national team as the country will be the centre of attention as hosts of the next World Cup, Parreira said. 

But this will only happen after sitting down and talking to representatives of the South African federation, added the 63-year-old. (Reuters)

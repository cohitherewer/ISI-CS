The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 N. Korea tame Japan

 - AFC Youth Championship final 

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: North Korea have recently made the world sit up following their nuclear test. On Sunday, they carried out another explosion at the Salt Lake Stadium, this time in Asian football. They deservedly won the AFC Youth Championship, beating Japan 6-4 via the tie-breaker. 

It was 1-1 after 120 minutes. In the shootout, North Korean goalkeeper Ju Kwang-min saved Japans first kick taken by Tsukasa Umesaki and that gave his team the advantage which ultimately proved decisive. The others all converted their shots from the spot, rendering Japans fifth kick redundant. 

South Korea finished third beating Jordan 2-0 earlier in the evening. 

It was a match that truly rose to its billing. North Korea took the lead as early as in the fourth minute when Ri Chol-myongs ambitious shot from around Japans half-line fooled goalie Akihiro Hayashi who was standing out of his line. 

Japan restored parity in the 34th minute, thanks to the brilliant Yosuke Kashiwagi. Having received a ball from the right, he cut in sharply, steered clear of the dual challenge of Ri Kwang-hyok and Chol-myong and on half-turn, unleashed a low drive which beat the keeper. 

These goals typified the match, played at a breathtaking speed and highlighted by different styles. 

Time and again, North Koreas amazing speed with the ball and off it caught the Japanese backline napping. 

Japan tackled these spells of impending danger by placing Masata Morishige as a defensive screen after the break. Yohei Fukumoto amp; Co. also slowed down the game by keeping possession and explored attacking possibilities on the break. 

Japan succeeded in frustrating the Koreans this way and at least on three occasions, they tested the rival keeper, but in vain. North Korea upped the tempo as the match spilled into extra-time. Choe Myong-ho missed a sitter with only the goalkeeper to beat. 

The North Koreans, however, had the last laugh as Hayashi who almost single-handedly defeated South Korea in the semi-finals couldnt conjure the same magic in the shootout. 

Having won the title jointly (with Iran) in as far back as 1976, North Korea announced their arrival in right earnest while for Japan, the trophy remained elusive.

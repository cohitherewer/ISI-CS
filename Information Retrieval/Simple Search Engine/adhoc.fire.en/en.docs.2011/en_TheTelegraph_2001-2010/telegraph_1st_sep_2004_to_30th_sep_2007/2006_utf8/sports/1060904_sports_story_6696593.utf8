 Giles may be back

 Champions Trophy

 London: England Left-arm 

 spinner Ashley Giles, who has not played at all this summer 

 owing to a hip injury, may make a return in the Champions 

 Trophy in India.

 Giles is now concentrating 

 on cricket-related skills. Hes walking through his 

 bowling action now, which is a very positive sign, 

 England chairman of selectors David Graveney was quoted 

 as saying on Sunday.

 But the chairman of selectors 

 admitted that fielding players returning from injury could 

 be risky.

 Because of the timeline 

 weve been given by the International Cricket Council 

 of September 7, were going to have to put people in 

 there who were not quite sure about, he said.

 Coe calls for life ban on first-time offenders

London: Track and field athletes with a first doping offence should be banned for life from the Olympics and all other top-level meets, says former two-time Olympic gold medallist Sebastian Coe. 

Coe, chairman of the London 2012 Olympic Organising Committee, is Britains representative on the IAAF ruling council and will submit the proposal at a meeting in Osaka next August. 

People are leaving our sport in droves and we have to do something or the whole sport looks stupid, Coe said at the European Championships. 

I am sure there is a level of pressure that can be brought to bear on athletes by excluding those with a doping conviction from all IAAF world-series events. 

Coe wants IAAF suspensions in line with those of the British Olympic Association, which has a lifetime Olympic ban for athletes with a doping conviction. He also wants athletes banned from the World Championships, Grand Prix finals and World Cup. 

IAAF rules currently call for a two-year ban from all competition for a first offence and life ban for a second.

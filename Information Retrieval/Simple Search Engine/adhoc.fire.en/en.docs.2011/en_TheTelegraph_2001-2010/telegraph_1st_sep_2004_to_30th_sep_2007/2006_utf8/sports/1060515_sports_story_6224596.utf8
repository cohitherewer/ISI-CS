The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Indians have the chance to repeat 35-year-old 

 history

 - Dravid perhaps has the best team at his disposal

 D eacute;ja Vu

 Ajit Wadekar

Let me be frank with you. I never expected to lead India to the West Indies in 1971! I always thought that the fight was between two giants ? Tiger Pataudi and Chandu Borde and that Tiger had better chances. When the selectors met for the purpose, I was busy shopping for my new flat with my wife. I was really stunned when I saw a large gathering for interviews. More responsibility and tension for sure! 

When the team was announced, there were mixed feelings among the critics and public. The general consensus was that it wasnt a good side to combat the mighty West Indies, that too on their own soil.

We were without Tiger Pataudi, who almost ruled the Indian team as captain for about 11 years continuously, a record by any standards. He opted out. 

We had no batting genius such as Chandu Borde. Instead, we had seniors who were not in their best form and youngsters such as Eknath Solkar, Gundappa Vishwanath, Sunil Gavaskar, Kenia Jayantilal, Devraj Govindraj, Rusi Jeejibhoy, coupled with an inexperienced captain not much heard of. 

No wonder then that when we landed in Kingston, Jamaica, their captain and my only idol then as the best allrounder, Gary Sobers, had much the same opinion at the airport which he expressed over welcome drinks. 

Sobers had a galaxy of superstars in himself, Rohan Kanhai, Clive Lloyd, Roy Fredricks, Joey Carew, Charlie Davis, George Camacho and Alvin Kallicharran waiting in the wings. 

He also had a good pace attack in Keith Boyce, Grayson Shillingford, Vanburn Holder, John Shepherd and Uton Dowe who managed to rattle us with their barrage of bouncers with increasing intimidation as the tour progressed. 

Compared to that, our so-called medium pace attack was in the hands of Govindraj, Solkar, Abid Ali and M.L. Jaisimha to a certain extent. Their short-pitched deliveries were not even knee-high! 

The only solace was that we were really better off in the spin department with the wily Bishan Singh Bedi, deceptive E. Prasanna, steady Venkatraghvan and the moody Salim Durrani. 

In addition, their umpiring wasnt that friendly with no TV to show the replays. 

 We decided to concentrate on fielding, more particularly in close-in-positions, for two reasons ? to provide support to our spinning trio and to ensure that we dont drop catches of Sobers or Kanhai or Lloyd, otherwise they may get not less than two hundreds. 

We pinpointed Solkar, Gavaskar, Abid Ali, Venkat and myself with better anticipation and reflexes for the job. The bowlers were given specific instructions to contain these great free scoring, cavalier batsmen and make them lose patience quickly. 

Thirdly, we decided to go all out when conditions and the circumstances were in our favour. 

And lo! Our strategy started working. We also had a bonus that some of our batsmen got into great form. Even the tailenders stood up to the attack courageously. None of the players flinched from the duties allotted to them. 

Also, luckily for me, a legend was being born for India in the West Indies. Yes, it was Sunil Gavaskar. 

To get a record-breaking 774 runs on debut in just four Tests, and that too on foreign soil and against one of the best teams in the world, is something which ordinary batsman cant do! 

It was Sobers who named him Little Master at the end of the series. What a tribute from a great to another! 

Had it not been for his century in the first innings and double hundred in the second innings, we wouldnt have been able to win the series 1-0. It would have been a drawn one. 

Rahul Dravid has a tremendous chance to repeat history after a gap of 35 years. 

It is really surprising that India have had to wait this long. They came close to the target but were unable to turn it into a win. 

May be, West Indies battery of pace attack had gone berserk with short-pitched deliveries and bouncers to shatter the confidence of our main batters then. May be, our attack was not good enough to capture all the 20 wickets. 

Dravid doesnt have to worry about all this. He has perhaps the best and well-balanced team at his disposal. He has a tremendous batting line-up in himself, Sachin (if fit), Yuvraj, Sehwag (if he gets cracking), Raina (most promising youngster), Dhoni (with all the ability in the world to hit any ball if he so desires) and Irfan Pathan. 

He has a good seam attack in Pathan, Sreesanth and Agarkar to exploit the fast tracks and humid conditions like we have in Mumbai or Chennai. He also has a good spin attack to boot. 

The West Indies are still in the process of rebuilding and if our bowlers contain their main batsmen like Brian Lara, Ramnaresh Sarwan, Shivnarine Chanderpaul and Chris Gayle, victory is on the platter like we had in 1971.

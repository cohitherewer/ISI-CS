 McEnroe, 47, still going strong

 - SAN JOSE DOUBLES MEET 

 McEnroe teamed up with Bjorkman 

San Jose: John McEnroe rolled back the years on Thursday to partner Swede Jonas Bjorkman to a first-round doubles win at the SAP Open. 

Bjorkman and McEnroe, on the eve of his 47th birthday, beat No. 2 seeds Wayne Arthurs and Stephen Huss 6-3, 6-3. 

I want to inspire the old people, McEnroe said. The old dog wants to teach the young guys a few new tricks. 

McEnroe, who last played an ATP Tour match in 1994, was presented with a birthday cake and fans sang happy birthday to him after the match. 

The erstwhile enfant terrible of the mens Tour teased the crowd, playfully scowling at the chair umpire on a couple of close line calls and dropping his racket in mock anger. 

During his career, McEnroe won a record 154 tournaments ? 77 singles and 77 doubles. 

It isnt going to change the world that I played a doubles tournament. Weve got to get out there and attract new customers, said McEnroe. But its nice to be out there and open peoples eyes about doubles a little bit. 

In first-round singles action, third seed Lleyton Hewitt crushed American Paul Goldstein 6-4, 6-2, while Mark Philippoussis overcame fourth seed Tommy Robredo 3-6, 7-5, 7-5. 

Hewitt, recovering from an ankle injury, looked sharp, winning six successive games with a rapid-fire attack from the baseline to clinch victory. 

The 24-year-od Australian was pushed in the first set by Goldsteins changes of pace, but won the set when he crushed a brilliant forehand down the line. 

After dropping the first two games of the second set, Hewitts game went up to another level while Goldstein had trouble keeping the ball in the court.

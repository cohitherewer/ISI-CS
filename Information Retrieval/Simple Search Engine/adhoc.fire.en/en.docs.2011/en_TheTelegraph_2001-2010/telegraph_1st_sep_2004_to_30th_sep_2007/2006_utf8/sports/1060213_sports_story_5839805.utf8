 Aussies bounce back in style

Sydney: Australia tore up the record books to thrash Sri Lanka by 167 runs in the second one-day final at the Sydney Cricket Ground on Sunday, forcing their best-of-three series into a deciding match. 

The Australians rebounded from their shock loss in Adelaide on Friday to amass a record total of 368 for five before bowling the tourists out for 201 and set up a Brisbane decider on Tuesday. 

All-rounder Andrew Symonds (151) and Australian captain Ricky Ponting (124) smashed centuries in a record fourth-wicket partnership of 237 to help the world champions register their highest ever total in a one-day International. 

Sri Lanka looked to be in control early in the match when fast bowler Chaminda Vaas captured three wickets in his first two overs to leave the home team reeling at 10 for three. 

However, Ponting and Symonds laid the foundations for their huge total then the bowlers finishing off the job. 

Forced to chase runs quickly, Sri Lankas hopes of winning were dashed almost as soon as their reply began with opener Sanath Jayasuriya dismissed for a duck then Kumar Sangakkara went for 13.

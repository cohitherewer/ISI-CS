 Lara dismissed for 83 

Napier: A classy 83 from Brian Lara and an unbeaten 70 from Runako Morton carried the West Indies to 256 for four against New Zealand before further rain brought an early end to the second day of the third and final Test on Sunday. 

Only 78 overs have been possible in the first two days, and with more rain forecast over coming days, the chance of an outright decision is becoming remote. 

But there has been enough time in the middle for Lara to display his magic after failing in his four previous innings. 

He rediscovered his classic, flowing stroke-play and as much as New Zealand tried to stack the off-side with fielders, Laras placement was too good as he cracked 12 boundaries. 

But as he was marching towards his century the gremlins struck again. He went to pull Nathan Astle, but a bottom-edge cannoned into his legs then on to the stumps, and Lara walked from the field to a standing ovation after his 107 ball stand. His dismissal was followed by the run-out of Shivnarine Chanderpaul in bizarre circumstances which saw the West Indies captain and Morton at the same end. 

At stumps, Morton was on 70, with Dwayne Bravo on 22. 

Chanderpaul was on two when Morton guided a shot to mid-off and set off for what should have been a comfortable single, until Chanderpaul backpedalled and both ground their bats at the bowlers end when Daniel Vettori broke the stumps at the other end.

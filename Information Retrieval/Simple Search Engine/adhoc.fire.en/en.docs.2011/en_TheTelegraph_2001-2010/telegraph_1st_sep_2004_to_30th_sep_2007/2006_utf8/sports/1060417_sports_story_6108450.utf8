The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 EB rally to rout Dempo 3-1 

 - National League

 - Bhaichung emerges joint top-scorer with Ranty 

 Bhaichung equalised in the 64th minute 

Mumbai: Theres no stopping East Bengal, even if the ground is the much-viled Cooperage. Theres no stopping Bhaichung Bhutia either, even if he is targeted by rivals to the hilt. 

So, the East Bengal juggernaut, under the Belgian coach Philippe de Ridder, rolled on as they made a splendid rally to rout the defending champions Dempo 3-1 in their National Football League (NFL) for the ONGC Cup at the Cooperage on Sunday. After being in arrears following a 35th-minute strike by the crafty Johnny DCruz, De Ridders side pumped in three goals in a 21-minute blitzkrieg. 

Bhaichung started the comeback with a goal in the 64th minute. Then Man-of-the-Match Syed Rahim Nabi (71st) and substitute Dipankar Roy (80th) took the wind out of Dempos sail. East Bengal won their home match 5-3 over the Goan rivals with Bhaichung scoring three. 

Bhaichung, in fact, has now emerged joint top-scorer with Dempos Ranty Martins, who remained largely off-colour in the match. Both have so far scored 10 goals. 

This was East Bengals eighth win, which took their points tally to 27, thus maintaining their four-point advantage over second-placed Mahindra United. Dempo remained in fifth spot with 19 points from 13 matches. 

A lot has been talked about the ground, which plays host to Mahindra United and Air India. The former, in fact, have come down on the ground, holding it responsible from their slip from the top position till Round IX. 

Following two defeats and a draw, Mahindra coach Derrick Pereira maintained that the Calcutta teams will face problems here. In fact any good team with skilful players will find it difficult to operate smoothly on this ground. 

East Bengal started watchfully, probably keeping the poor conditions of the ground in mind. Dempo, on the other hand, went on the offensive early with long balls being delivered towards the East Bengal box from both flanks. 

It was, however, Ranty who should be held responsible for translating these attacks into anything meaningful. 

Dempo, however, took the lead ten minutes before the breather when DCruz took possession of a throw-in from the right well inside the penalty area and volleyed home. 

Ranty should have increased the tally to 3-0 by half time, but muffed both chances. He laid a shallow diagonal pass to DCruz and then got it back only to shoot wide with the East Bengal custodian out of position. 

Soon after and just before the breather he shot over the bar after a 1-2 with DCruz had fooled the goalkeeper. 

Alvito DCunhas second-half entry galvanised East Bengal and they moved purposefully. The parity came through Bhaichungs brilliance once again. The agile striker, getting some more space, struck in splendid fashion by pivoting on his heel to shoot in from an acute angle to the far corner. 

Since then theres no looking back for the Calcutta outfit. They duly went ahead when Nabi headed in a corner ? the third successive one, taken by DCunha. 

DCunha then laid a splendid defence-splitting through for substitute Dipankar to back-heel the ball in past Dempo goalpeeper Abhijit Mondal.

Sydney: Sania Mirza pulled off a set before going down fighting against world No. 17 Daniela Hantuchova of Slovakia in the first round of the Sydney International on Monday. 

Sania, playing her first WTA Tour match of the season, went down 6-4, 2-6, 6-2 to the US Open mixed doubles champion in a centre court match at the $600,000 event. 

The 19-year old Hyderabadi, ranked 34, had marked her return with an high profile exhibition event in Hong Kong last week after a back strain brought her 2005 season to an early end. 

I think I have recovered sufficiently as I had no problem with my back, Sania said. 

The Hong Kong event featured three of the four reigning Grand Slam champions, and Sania got to play two singles and as many doubles matches, pairing up with world number two Kim Clijsters. 

Sania failed to win a set in that event but felt she was still finding her match rhythm after a tough three-week workout with Tony Roche in Sydney during the winter break. 

It ill take me a few months for sure in match pressure situations before I expect to be confident with what I am trying to execute. 

But for a start ? pretty good, Sania said of what she had picked from her training under Roche. 

Meanwhile, in another match, Justine Henin-Hardenne made a triumphant return to Australia on Monday with a 6-3, 6-3 win over Martina Hingis. 

The diminutive Belgian took just over an hour to see off Hingis to remain unbeaten in Australia for three years. 

I was a little bit nervous because I knew everybody was going to be talking about this match, she said. The first match of the season is never easy but against Martina its much more difficult.

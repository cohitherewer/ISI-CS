 Greg: We still have a lot of work to do

Kingston: Coach Greg Chappell has described the performance of the young pace bowlers in Indias series win in the Caribbean as outstanding and said the team now had the bowlers to win under any condition. 

We have won with three young fast bowlers and its a credit. Along with Irfan Pathan, we have got four fast bowlers of variety which would help us to play under any condition, inside or outside India. I think we are better equipped than ever before, Chappell said. 

The Australian great, however, made a plea not to over-react to the series triumph. 

I have been in cricket for long to know that you cant overreact to anything ? good or bad. We shouldnt get carried away. We have a lot of work to do before we become a very good Test team, remarked Chappell as he prepared to leave for a short vacation to the United States. 

Chappell underlined the performance of senior cricketers which was a major contributor to the success. 

Rahul Dravid was awesome. His performance on that wicket (at Sabina Park) was critical. He was the outstanding batsman from both sides. He continually strives to get better. 

History would show that he is one of the best players for anyone, forget about India. It takes difficult conditions for the cream to come to the top. He came to the top in this game and we needed him because he was the best equipped player. (PTI)

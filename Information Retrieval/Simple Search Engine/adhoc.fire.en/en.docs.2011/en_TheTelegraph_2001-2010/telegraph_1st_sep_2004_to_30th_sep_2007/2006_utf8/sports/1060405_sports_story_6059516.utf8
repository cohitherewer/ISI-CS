Colombo: Sri Lanka opener Sanath Jayasuriya appears to have played his last Test innings after dislocating his thumb on the second day of this second Test against Pakistan on Tuesday. 

The 36-year-old damaged the digit while catching Pakistan opener Imran Farhat in the morning session and was immediately taken to the hospital with fitness trainer C.J. Clarke. 

There was no fracture but Sanath dislocated his thumb and spilt the skin right on the joint, physiotherapist Tommy Simsek told reporters during the tea interval. 

The joint is now back in place and they are stitching up the wound but it is very, very unlikely that he will play any further part in this Test match. 

Based on what the doctors have said, I think we are looking at him being out for four to five weeks. 

Jayasuriya announced his retirement from Test cricket on Friday, saying the completion of this match would mark the end of his career. 

He scored 14 in the first innings as Sri Lanka were bowled out for 279, although he intends to continue playing one-day Internationals through to the 2007 World Cup.

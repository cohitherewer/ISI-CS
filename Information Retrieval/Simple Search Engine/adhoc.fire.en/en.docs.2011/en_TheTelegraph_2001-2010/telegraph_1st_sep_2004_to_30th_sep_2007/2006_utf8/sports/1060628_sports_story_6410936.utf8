The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 DAY V HIGHLIGHTS

 Virender Sehwag became the 11th Indian (and 96th overall) 

 to aggregate 4000 Test runs when he reached 3 in the second 

 innings of his 48th match. He is the second-quickest (with 

 Rahul Dravid) among Indians to touch the 400-run mark, Sunil 

 Gavaskar having done it in 43 Tests. In terms of innings, 

 Sehwag is the joint-quickest (with Gavaskar), both having 

 taken 81 innings

 Sehwags 65 was only his fourth second-innings half-century 

 in Tests. He now has 732 runs 26.14 in the second 

 innings, with a highest of 90. His first-innings record 

 is far superior ?3330 runs 69.38, with 12 hundreds 

 and 8 fifties

 Dravids unbeaten 68 took his Test tally to 8900, placing 

 him at joint-sixth position (with Graham Gooch) among top 

 run-getters. Those ahead of Dravid and Gooch are Brian Lara 

 (11468), Allan Border (11174), Steve Waugh (10927), Sachin 

 Tendulkar (10469) and Gavaskar (10122)

 Dravids current average of 58.55 is the third-best 

 among the 66 batsmen who have aggregated 5000 or more runs 

 in Test history. Only Don Bradman (6996 runs 99.94) 

 and Ken Barrington (6806 runs 58.67) have better 

 averages. For the record, among contemporary players with 

 at least 1000 Test runs, only Mike Hussey (1139 runs 

 75.93) exceeds the Indian captains average

 The third-wicket partnership of 100 between V.V.S. Laxman 

 and Dravid was the pairs tenth century stand in Tests. 

 Only Dravid-Tendulkar (14 ) and Gavaskar-Chetan Chauhan 

 (11) have more century stands among Indians

 Anil Kumble became the 11th bowler in Test history (on Day 

 IV) to claim 200 away victims in 53 matches. 

 The only other Indian in the list is Kapil Dev with 215 

 wickets in 66 matches. Shane Warne leads the pack with 389 

 wickets in 76 Tests

 The last time India did as well or better in the fourth 

 innings was against England at Lords in 2002, when 

 they made 397 (and still lost by 170 runs)

 A total of 357 runs were scored on the final day for the 

 loss of six wickets. The only occasion when more runs were 

 scored on Day V of a Test in the Caribbean also involved 

 India ? in the 1971 Georgetown Test when 367 runs were scored

 The last time India were involved in three drawn Tests in 

 a row was in October-December 2003

 Seventeen sixes were hit in this Test, including 14 by the 

 home team. So far, 35 sixes have been hit in this series 

 ? 22 by the West Indians and 13 by Indians

 In the last six away Tests, the Indian bowlers have been 

 hit for 59 sixes ? 37 in Pakistan and 22 in the West Indies. 

 Add the 16 hit by English batsman in India, the total swells 

 to 75 overboundaries conceded by Kumble amp; Co. in the 

 last nine Tests!

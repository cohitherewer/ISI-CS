The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Well be the underdogs, says Leander

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Leander Paes, like Mahesh Bhupathi, will seek to add to his Grand Slam collection over the weekend at Melbourne Park. But the senior pro knows his job is a tougher one. 

Paes and Damm, the seventh seeds, take on No. 1 seeds Bob and Mike Bryan in the mens doubles final on Saturday, while Bhupathi and Martina Hingis face Daniel Nestor and Elena Likhovtseva in the mixed final a day after. 

Paes has faced the Bryan brothers many times in the last three-four years, coming out on the wrong side of the scoreline more often than not. 

(Nenad) Zimonjic and I lost to them twice last year, before that David (Rikl) and I lost quite a few times? they are a very successful team and well start as the underdogs on Saturday, Paes told The Telegraph from Melbourne. 

Having said that, I must add Martin and I have beaten the second seeds (Jonas Bjorkman and Max Mirnyi) here? Now well be gunning for the top seeds, Paes added. 

Describing Fridays mixed doubles loss (with Nathalie Dechy to Nestor and Likhovtseva) as a touch-and-go affair, Paes said he would be playing with Aussie Samantha Stosur in the French Open.

 Lanka sweep series 

Bogra: Sri Lanka openers Upul Tharanga and Michael van Dort took just eight overs to secure a 10-wicket victory over Bangladesh on the fourth day of the second and final Test on Saturday. 

Needing just 43 more runs to reach 120, Tharanga moved to an unbeaten 71, while Van Dort remained undefeated on 40 as they faced little resistance from Bangladeshi bowlers.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Confidence is bred from succeeding under pressure, says Chappell

 - My agenda is to produce the best team for the Indian public 

INDRANIL MAJUMDAR

Multan: At the breakfast table the morning after the ODI series win, Greg Chappell stayed glued to the highlights of Thursdays match. The celebrations had run late into the night at the Maryam Hall of the Holiday Inn. 

The Team India coach, however, was not ready to get carried away by this success and was already focusing on bigger goals. Chappell spoke to The Telegraph before leaving for Karachi. 

The following are excerpts 

Q What are the positives from this series? 

A Winning the series is obviously one, the continued development of the team, the fact that we are understanding more and more each day about what it takes to be successful?Thats the biggest positive. The development of each individual and Rahul Dravids captaincy has also played a big role in the series win. 

How important is this one-day series win in your plans for Mission 2007? 

I understand getting a positive result in an India versus Pakistan encounter is important. But the most important thing, from my point of view, is that we are progressing. If that meant we won, thats fine, but if that meant we came second but were moving forward, that itself would have been a good result for us. 

Winning isnt everything? Its important because it means less pressure, but the most important thing at the moment is the upward curve of the improvement process. That really is what we judge ourselves by as a side. If we put all these processes in place, we increase our chances of winning. 

The development, however, is most important. If we continually look at getting a win in this tournament or this game, we will miss out on developing the players. That is my most important role? To sacrifice players for short-term results is not a good option in my opinion. The most important thing is young players getting opportunities in pressure games. 

The only way to be successful is to learn to play under pressure. Confidence is bred from succeeding under pressure. Its not bred from practising well. Its not bred at nets, its bred in the heat of the battle. 

Trying to hang on to the past in the hope that we can get a short-term result is not an option in my view. The only option is to grasp the present and the future, and give players opportunities when they need them. That has always been my agenda and what I understand from my experience is that there is no other way to learn than to be up there in the battle. 

We have been accused of experimenting too much? Its not experimenting at all, its about development. We need to give the players experience and opportunities. 

How does it feel to see players like Rudra Pratap Singh and Suresh Raina winning matches for India? 

Its satisfying in the sense that a whole range of people, from their junior days to the current selection panel, recognise that these players have something to bring to the team. These guys have precocious talent, they are exciting young cricketers. If we dont give them opportunities when they are ready, they may be lost to Indian cricket. 

My agenda is to produce the best team for the Indian public. They are the ones who benefit from the teams success. They are the ones who support the team through thick and thin, they are the ones whose emotions go up and down with the performance of the team, they are the ones we play for and they deserve the best team. 

How important is the behind-the-scenes activities that have gone into making this success possible? 

Its about giving them advice, direction and developing their skill? The mental development is critical. Its one thing to have talent, but the mental process is vital. We spend a lot of time with the youngsters on developing their thinking. We design practice sessions for them to think rather than going mindlessly through a whole range of physical activity. 

Im aware that there have been a lot of players with the physical talent to be successful at the international level but have never been. Its mainly because they have never developed their mental ability to the degree they should have done. 

We spend a lot of time with drills totally unrelated to cricket. We make them use and develop their mind as much as their physical talent. Ian Frazers role in such development cannot be underestimated. To achieve something half as what we have done over the last eight months wouldnt have been possible without Frazers help. 

You do create match atmosphere during training sessions. How does it help? 

You dont learn to handle pressure unless you put them under pressure. Normal training and net sessions dont do that. In a way youve to be crazy to do that. We come up with ideas from time to time. Some of them work, some in a minimal sort of fashion. But we keep creating that environment that allow them to develop their full potential. There are a lot of people in fields other than sport who develop things we can put into practice. 

Its critical to get the right people together. I think you can see how these young boys have invigorated everybody, including me and the senior players. I have no doubt that Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul and Veeru (Virender Sehwag) have got a real spark from these young guys. It shows in their commitment to improve themselves. 

Do you assess your role? 

Everyday? 

How do you go about it? Do you set personal targets? 

We (the support staff included) dont set quantitative targets?We assess ourselves on the basis of what is happening within the group. The spirit of the players, how enthusiastic they are, how much enjoyment they get out of their practice schedules? If we hear a lot of noise at training sessions, we know boys are enjoying themselves? If they are laughing and making comments to each other, competing against each other in the drills, then we know they are focused and mentally engaged. If they are simply going through the motions, you can understand they are not so engrossed in the process. 

We always try and get the players emotions going. Emotions play such a big role in the development of an individual? If you are not committed to something, youre not going to develop very much in that direction. 

Youve got to have the players emotionally involved? sometimes a little bit of anger is a good thing. To trigger improvement in a player, youve to trigger their emotions, youve to change their mindset and thinking. We can then get them to change as people and cricketers. 

Do you think the youngsters have been tested to the hilt? 

Not yet? Theres a long way to go. Im sure even Sachin and Rahul havent been tested to the hilt. There are challenges in the cricket field they havent yet encountered. Thats why we try and change the environment as much as we can. If we allow them to practise the way they have always practised and do things the way they have always done, we will get the results that we always had. If we have to come out of it, we have to change the way we train. There was a bit of resistance in the early days, but that was okay. You dont get change without triggering emotions and conflicts from time to time. To get angry about something means youre thinking about it. 

Finally, what about the role of selectors? 

We need to involve selectors in the process of involving the types of players we need. Its important that they understand what we do now may not have its real impact till six or 12 months down the track when we go to the World Cup. It was a risk bringing young players into the squad. To play them in important games is big risk since they are not very experienced. But how do they get experience if they are not put into pressure situations against good opposition. 

We judge ourselves by challenging and beating the teams that are better than us. The thing that I am enjoying about this group is that they want the challenges. People like Irfan Pathan, M.S. Dhoni, R.P. Singh, Suresh Raina dont shy away from playing against the best. 

They look forward to the contest. Champion players love to compete. Its part of the process to work hand in hand with the selectors and identify players who love the contest, not ones who run away from it.

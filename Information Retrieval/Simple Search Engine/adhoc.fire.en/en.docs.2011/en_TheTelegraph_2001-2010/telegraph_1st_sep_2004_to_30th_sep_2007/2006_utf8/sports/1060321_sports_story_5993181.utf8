 - REVIEW OF TEAM BENGALS PERFORMANCE IN 2005-06 SEASON 

ABHISHEK ROY

 Calcutta: Bengals 101-run loss to Railways in the semi-finals of the National One-day meet on Sunday in Lucknow brought the curtains down on the 2005-06 season for the state. It has been a season of hope and satisfaction for the players, specially if a comparison is drawn with last season when they managed to survive relegation from the Elite group in the Ranji Trophy by the proverbial hairs breadth. 

Deep Dasguptas boys not only came up with an allround and consistent showing that saw them lose to Uttar Pradesh in the Ranji Trophy final, but also managed to instil new enthusiasm and fervour in the hitherto sagging morale. 

It was Laxmi Ratan Shuklas knock of 81 that saw Bengal take a five-run lead in their final Ranji match against Madhya Pradesh on January 4 last year to ensure their position in the Elite group. In effect, it also saved the career of some of the youngsters. 

This season started on a fresh note for Bengal, a new coach (Paras Mhambrey) and a new captain (Deep Dasgupta), after Sourav Ganguly decided to step down on the eve of the first-round match against Maharashtra in Pune. It was the desire of the players to do something out of the ordinary, which acted as a catalyst in the metamorphosis of the side. 

The Sourav factor also played a big role. The presence of the former India captain rejuvenated the team. 

Stepping into the captains shoes, Deep also led by example, emerging the highest scorer in the team and fourth overall with 578 runs from nine matches. Says Mhambrey: It is always tough for a wicketkeeper captain... He has to manoeuvre his players as well as himself. As a player he has come of age, and as a captain for the first time in Ranji, he showed maturity. 

Right from the match against Maharashtra, Bengal were out to prove themselves with a vengeance and it couldnt have been better with Sourav leading the charge. The former India captain picked up five wickets for 75 in the first innings and then made a brilliant 159. Sourashish Lahiri then got into the act, bagging seven for 93 in the second innings, to help Bengal gain two points (on the basis of first innings lead). 

Souravs influence was a big factor for us. People respect him a lot and whenever he performed, it motivated us, acknowledged Deep. 

The infusion of new blood also played its part. Avishek Jhunjhunwala, Manoj Tewari and Asok Dinda came to the sides aid whenever the situation demanded. 

The commitment of the players also showed when an out-of-form Devang Gandhi decided to opt out on the eve of the Gujarat match. Avishek, who replaced Devang, came out firing on all cylinders with a 72 on debut. As a player, Devang has set an example for others. He has given a lot to Bengal cricket, pointed out Deep. 

But this hasnt created a sense of insecurity among the senior players. The latest example was Sanjib Sanyal. Dropped for reasons best known to the selectors in the knockout stage of the National one-day meet, Sanyal came back strongly picking up four for 45 against Punjab in the quarter finals. Both the coach and captain agreed that there exists a healthy competition among the players. Subhamoy Das and Laxmi Ratan Shukla played their part whenever the occasion demanded. Shib Shankar Paul and Ranadeb Boses contribution cannot also be ignored. Their untiring efforts and the early breakthroughs made the teams task that bit easier. 

Chairman of the states senior selection committee, Pronab Roy feels that it has been a 360 degree turn for the team and that Mhambrey deserves credit for the transformation. 

This year we were really hopeless, but Mhambrey took the challenge and came out with flying colours. Some credit should also be given to Karsan Ghavri (the former coach), who created the nucleus while Mhambrey worked on it. 

The season will end without a trophy, but it also marks a new beginning. This team has a good future. But consistency shall be the key if we want to emerge champions. We have to improve in every department, and hopefully we will put up a better show next season, concluded Mhambrey.

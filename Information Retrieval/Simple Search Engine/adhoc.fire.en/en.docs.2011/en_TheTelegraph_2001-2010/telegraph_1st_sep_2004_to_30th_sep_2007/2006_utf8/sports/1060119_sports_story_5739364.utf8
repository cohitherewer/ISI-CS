 Another wonderful example of Dravid leading from front

 Dravid rsquo;s rock-solid defence and ability to handle short-pitched balls can be slow poison for bowlers

Once again, an animated conversation between Rahul Dravid and Sourav Ganguly shown live by a TV channel before the start of the first Test kept the media busy for a couple of days. 

In cricket, such dressing-room discussions are commonplace. Just because it was captured on TV, the clipping made some ugly rounds in the electronic media, giving rise to ungainly discussions. In the eyes of millions of fans, who follow every bit and byte on all mediums, this meaningless debate was yet another attempt to show Indian cricket in poor light. 

We had a classic case of crowds response to some of the spiced-up media reactions during Team Indias initial loss to Australia in the 2003 World Cup in southern Africa. The end result was Rahul Dravids car being stoned in Bangalore and Mohammad Kaifs house painted black in Allahabad. 

We are already witnessing a new dangerous trend among a section of the supporters, who go to the extent of burning effigies of players and coaches to vent their disappointment. The exaggerated media projection about so-called differences between the players and coaches could play spoilsport. 

If such a trend continues, I wont be surprised if a fan takes a detrimental step towards a player. Sensational journalism can not only harm cricket in general but also the players. It is time for the irresponsible sections of the media to behave and show restraint. 

Back to cricket. The Lahore Test was surely a tame beginning for such an important series. We did see and hear a lot about how dead the pitch was. To be honest, the chorus of dead wicket gained momentum only after a befitting reply came from the newly-formed Indian opening pair. 

Sehwag, showing scant respect to the Pakistan attack was commendable. One could easily make out that the current Pakistan bowling attack was far more effective and penetrative than what it was on the previous tour. In a few spells, the Pakistan speedsters made even the unresponsive wicket talk. They were fast and furious. But it was the combination of the sword of Sehwag and the impenetrable wall presented by Dravid that denied any advantage to the hosts. 

Bad light and rain came to the rescue of bowlers in general. It is true that in India we produce some slow tracks, but even those offer some assistance to the spinners. The idea of the Pakistan thinktank was right, to provide a slow track where their speedsters can still make them count. But the Indian openers were determined to keep the hosts attack at bay. 

After all the debate and discussions about the batting order, it was yet again a masterstroke by the Indian skipper. 

Dravids average as an opener is not the best in the world. But on many occasions, Dravid at No. 3 became as good as an opener because of the fall of an early wicket. As a captain, he could have opted for a slot where he was comfortable. But yet again he put the teams interest ahead of his own. This move by Rahul would certainly inspire the others in the side to be flexible when the team needs them to be. It was another wonderful example of a captain leading from the front. 

Sehwags brutality continued from where he had left during his last visit to Pakistan. The Pakistan bowlers may console themselves that the wicket was too slow for their liking, but Sehwags demolition act would surely have dented their confidence to a great degree. 

At the other end, what was more demoralising for the bowlers was the defence of the Indian skipper. Dravids rock-solid defence and his deftness in handling the short-pitched balls can be slow poison for the bowlers. His philosophy of batting is not to give any hope whatsoever to the bowlers by draining their energy levels. 

In a drawn Test, Indias new opening pair complemented contrastingly to gain the psychological edge, which was held by Pakistan at the beginning of the series.

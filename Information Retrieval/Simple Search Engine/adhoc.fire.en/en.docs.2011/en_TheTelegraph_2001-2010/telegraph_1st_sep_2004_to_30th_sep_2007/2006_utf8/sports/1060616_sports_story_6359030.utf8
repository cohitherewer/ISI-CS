 Domenech pines for Gallic finesse

Hamelin: France need to add a touch of Gallic finesse to their trademark defensive displays if they are to go a long way at the Word Cup, coach Raymond Domenech said on Thursday. 

The 1998 champions, who started with a dull 0-0 draw with Switzerland on Tuesday, at least pleased their coach by controlling the game and neutralising their opponents. 

We were solid, compact and thats how we wanted to be, Domenech said. The Swiss were dangerous only on two set pieces and maybe on one other occasion. (Reuters)

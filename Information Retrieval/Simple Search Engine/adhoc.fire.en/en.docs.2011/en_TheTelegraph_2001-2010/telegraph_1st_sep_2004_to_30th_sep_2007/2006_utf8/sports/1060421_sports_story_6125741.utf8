 Federer cruises; Bhupathi beats Paes

Monte Carlo: World No. 1 Roger Federer cruised into the Monte Carlo Open quarter finals on Thursday, ending the adventure of hometown qualifier Benjamin Balleret 6-3, 6-2. 

In doubles second-round action, Mahesh Bhupathi triumphed over his Davis Cup captain Leander Paes. Bhupathi and Czech partner Radek Stepanek saw off fourth seeds Paes and Martin Damm 6-1, 6-4 to move into the third round. 

Federers next opponent will be eighth seed David Ferrer, who battled past 11th seed Juan Carlos Ferrero 6-1, 6-7, 6-3 in an all-Spanish baseline duel. 

Defending champion Rafael Nadal struggled for an hour and 37 minutes before overcoming Belgian Kristof Vliegen 6-3, 6-3. 

Fifteenth seed Tony Robredo of Spain upset third seed David Nalbandian of Argentina 5-7, 6-1, 7-5 after more than three hours on the claycourt. 

Croatian fourth seed Ivan Ljubicic beat Gilles Simon, the last French hope, 6-3, 6-2. The result means that France will not have a player in the Monte Carlo quarters for the second time in 10 years. (Agencies)

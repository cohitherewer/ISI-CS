The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Difficult for a small country to make final

Munich: Portugal coach Luiz Felipe Scolari 

 paid an emotional tribute to his team on Thursday, saying 

 he was proud of his players despite a 0-1 loss to France 

 in Wednesdays semi-final. 

 Thirty-two teams started the World Cup and four 

 got to the semi-finals. To be among the four is an achievement 

 for us, its historic, he told reporters. 

We want to thank everyone in Portugal for all the displays of affection towards our players and tell them our players did their best from the start. 

I want the world to know that were proud of our players, added the man known as Big Phil, who led his native Brazil to their fifth world title in 2002. 

Were not going to drop our heads or feel bad because of Wednesdays defeat, he added, after leading Portugal to the last four for the first time since 1966. 

We lost to an outstanding team, we want to thank everyone who supported us yesterday immensely, not just in Portugal but in other parts of the world. 

Scolari avoided any criticism of Uruguayan referee Jorge Larrionda, who gave France a controversial penalty from which Zinedine Zidane scored the only goal of the game. 

We will play a third place match with Germany, although we would rather be playing for first and second place against Germany, he said. 

For us, third place would be marvellous. 

When told France coach Raymond Domenech considered that Portugal had given France a tougher ride than Brazil, Scolari interjected that this gave him no satisfaction at all and attacked the attitude of the French players and the referee. 

Their players made some absurd comments about our players using words that cannot be repeated in a press conference but they had good defenders and gave Cristiano Ronaldo little room. We know South American referees ? they know how to kill a game. 

 I dont believe France were better than 

 Portugal, said Scolari. We are a small country 

 and it is difficult for a country like Portugal to reach 

 a World Cup final. 

 The luck factor was not on Portugals side, 

 Portuguese legend Eusubio told a television channel. 

 The players deserve to be 

 congratulated. But it is still not over; sadly we are not 

 in the final but we have a game ahead and that game has 

 a price as well which is the bronze.

 Indians roles should be defined: Sohail

Durban: India must have fixed batting slots if they are to taste success on the bouncy South African pitches, says Aamer Sohail, who is the only captain from Asia to have beaten South Africa in a Test in their own den. 

Sohail was the leader of the Pakistani side which beat South Africa by 29 runs in Kingsmead, Durban, on arguably the bounciest of all South African pitches in 1998, and importantly, he did it with a rank inexperienced team. 

Sohail, understandably, is proud of the achievement and his advice to the Indians is simple the batsmen must be told of their roles, but for that to happen, their batting slots too now must be fixed something, the Indians still appear averse to doing. 

Indians, I feel, should have their roles defined in the present series. For instance, I cant understand what Mohammed Kaif is doing so low in the order. He doesnt have the flamboyance and the strokes to lash out in the final overs. 

The likes of Suresh Raina should be tried up the order, it doesnt matter if he fails for a few innings, said Sohail, here as a TV commentator. (PTI)

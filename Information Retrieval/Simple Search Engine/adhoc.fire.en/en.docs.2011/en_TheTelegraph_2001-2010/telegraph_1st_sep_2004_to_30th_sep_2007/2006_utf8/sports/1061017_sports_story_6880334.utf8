 Pakistan keen to shift focus 

Jaipur: Crisis-ridden Pakistan will be keen to put behind the dope scandal involving their pace spearheads Mohammed Asif and Shoaib Akhtar and come up with a morale boosting win against Sri Lanka in the ICC Champions Trophy match here on Tuesday. 

Pakistan, who are already without their regular skipper Inzamam-ul Haq, will be forced to field a depleted side after Akhtar and Asif were pulled out of the tournament following their failing a drug test conducted back home in September. 

Sri Lanka, on the other hand, have gone from strength to strength. They have come through the qualifying stage with a clean, slate, winning all their three matches convincingly. Captain Mahela Jayawardene said he could not have asked for more from his players. We have had gradual build up. Our batting has been okay, bowling has been disciplined. The intensity and aggression has been good, he said.

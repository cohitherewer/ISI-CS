 Phone menace in RCTC ring 

 STAR RACER

Calcutta: Betting ring is always a happening place but RCTC does not seem to be aware of it. Cellphones and pagers are banned within the racecourse enclosures but a casual walk through the ring gives no indication that such a ban has been in existence. Mobile phones are used freely within the barred area. One only has to grease the palms of the men on duty to enjoy the freedom of connection with the outer world. 

 The going rate is Rs 200 per day and the racket involved could be making about Rs 10,000 a race day as nearly 50 heads were spotted using the gadget on Saturday. With five day of racing in a week, a monthly collection of Rs 2 lakh makes a tidy sum a parallel economy, that is. With festive season approaching, it has also been learnt that the rates will be hiked from the next week.

 RCTC has been slapping fines between Rs 5,000 and 10,000, each time a cellphone got confiscated. Such cases have been very few in recent weeks. Bookmakers too, are a worried lot, leave alone the state exchequer which is losing by way of betting taxes. as bets gets passed on to the illegal channels outside. Bookies have also reported the matter to the RCTC officials.

 Phone jammers may come handy but 

 the clubs present state of finances may not permit 

 such a luxury as RCTC may need at least 10 of such gadgets 

 and each one costs about Rs 75,000. Boman Parakh, secretary, 

 RCTC could not be contacted for his comments.

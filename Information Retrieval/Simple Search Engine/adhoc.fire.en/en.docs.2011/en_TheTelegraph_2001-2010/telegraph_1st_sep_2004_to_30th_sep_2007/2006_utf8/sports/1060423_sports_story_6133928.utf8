 Henry comes off bench to salvage draw

London: Thierry Henry came off the bench to salvage a 1-1 draw for Arsenal against Tottenham Hotspur in a pulsating north London derby at Highbury on Saturday. 

The Frenchman, one of several first-choice players left out of the starting line-up by Arsene Wenger, produced a delicate finish to deny Spurs a first league victory at the ground since 1993. 

Tottenham, who started the day four points above Arsenal in the battle to finish fourth in the Premier League and claim the final Champions League berth, ended with 10 men after Edgar Davids was shown the red card. 

Tottenham have 62 points with two games remaining, while Arsenal ? with three matches left ? have 58 points. 

Davids had been involved in Tottenhams controversial opener for Robbie Keane after 65 minutes ? a goal that produced a furious touchline row between Wenger and his Spurs counterpart Martin Jol. 

Arsenals Gilberto and Emmanuel Eboue collided trying to stop Tottenhams impressive midfielder Michael Carrick, but instead of kicking the ball out of play, Carrick played in Davids whose low cross was tapped in at the far post by Keane. 

The other meaningful league action involved the three clubs fighting to avoid relegation. Portsmouth moved out of relegation zone when a late penalty from Matthew Taylor gave them a 2-1 victory over already doomed Sunderland. They swapped places with Birmingham City who could only draw 0-0 at Everton. 

West Bromwich Albion look certain to join Sunderland after a 0-3 defeat at Newcastle United left them six points from safety. (Reuters)

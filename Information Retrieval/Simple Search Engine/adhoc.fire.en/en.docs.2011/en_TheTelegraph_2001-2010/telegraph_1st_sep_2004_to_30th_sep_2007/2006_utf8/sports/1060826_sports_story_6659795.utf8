 National camp in disarray

 - No asst coach, physical trainer in Goa

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: Bob Houghton may be stressing on ushering in professionalism in Indian football, but the All India Football Federation (AIFF) does not have much time to pay heed to his suggestions. 

The national camp for the Asian Cup away match against Saudi Arabia, which started in Goa on Thursday, is currently having only 15 footballers. 

While the British coach is there to take charge, he is at the moment without his assistant and the physical trainer. The only technical staff present is the goalkeepers coach Marcus Pacheco. 

With the camp entering its second day on Friday, the team management is unsure as to when assistant coach Maurice Afonso will join the squad. Afonso, an assistant coach with Dempo, is currently busy with the Goa team that is going to Macau on September 30 to participate in a multi-event sporting festival for all former Portuguese colonies. 

When contacted, Afonso said he was not in a position to join the national camp since his employers, Dempo has not given him the necessary permission. 

Dempo has asked me to join the Goa camp, so I am here. It is for Dempo to tell me to join the India team. I cannot do anything without their prior approval. 

The Goa Football Association secretary, Savio Messias, said he was not aware of the problem. 

We have received no request from the AIFF to release Afonso, he said. We requested Dempo to loan us Afonso for the Goa team. So, he is here. 

With the AIFF general secretary Alberto Colaco away in Colombo and the president busy with the Parliament session, no one in the AIFF has any idea about how to overcome this crisis. 

Please dont ask me anything. We know nothing about all these, said a federation official. He could not even say when physical trainer Pradeep Dutta will join the camp. 

Ironically, the AIFF executive committee last month discussed about appointing a team of permanent support staff for the national team. 

 It came in the light of Houghtons statement that he needs a permanent support staff to run the national team in a professional manner.

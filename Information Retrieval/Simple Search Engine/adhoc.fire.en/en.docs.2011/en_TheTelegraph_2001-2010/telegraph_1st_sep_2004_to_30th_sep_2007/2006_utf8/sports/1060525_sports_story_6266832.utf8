 Sachin may be out for six more weeks

London: Sachin Tendulkar, who has already missed Indias current tour of the West Indies, will have to wait for another six weeks to return to competitive cricket during which he will continue with a structured rehabilitation programme of his right shoulder, according to doctors who examined him here on Wednesday. 

The maestro, who flew in here on Wednesday morning from Mumbai for an examination by a team of doctors who had done a surgery on his shoulder two months ago, was reviewed at the hospital of St John and St Elizabeth here. 

The doctors reached the conclusion that Sachins shoulder is not ready for competition at the international level, although his recovery is proceeding well and as expected, a hospital statement said later. 

For Sachin, the priority now is to regain strength over the next four to six weeks so that his shoulder is ready for his return to competition, the doctors said. (PTI)

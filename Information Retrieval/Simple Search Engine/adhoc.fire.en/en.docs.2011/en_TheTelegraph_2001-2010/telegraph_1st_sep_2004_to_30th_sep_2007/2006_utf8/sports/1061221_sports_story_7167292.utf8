 Indians firm favourites

Jaipur: Indian eves, gunning for a hattrick of titles, start strong favourites when they take on Sri Lanka in the final of the third womens Asia Cup Cricket Tournament at the Sawai Man Singh Stadium here on Thursday. 

They have a psychological edge over the Sri Lankans whom they have beaten twice in the league phase and look all set to lift the Cup for the third consecutive time. 

In the first leg of the round-robin league, the home side had cruised to a huge 10-wicket victory while in the second leg they had emerged winner by seven wickets. 

The Indians have also proved that they are head and shoulders above the rest by winning all their league matches in the competition. 

The Indians look good in every department of the game but skipper Mithali Raj refused to be rushed to any conclusion. It is cricket. You never know, any thing could happen. We will have to put best efforts, said Mithali. 

Asked if she believed Sri Lankans were good enough to bounce back, Mithali said they are a good bunch and have talented players. Although we have established our upperhand we wont take it easy. 

Mithali said they were able to experiment with the team combination with the side doing well in the tournament.

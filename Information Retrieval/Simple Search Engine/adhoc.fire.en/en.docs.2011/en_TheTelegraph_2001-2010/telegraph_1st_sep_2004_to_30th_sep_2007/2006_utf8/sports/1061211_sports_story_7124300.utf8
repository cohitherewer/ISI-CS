 VRV impresses Greg Chappell

 - Akram likely to help Pathan before first Test 

Potchefstroom: Batting may have been a perennial source of concern on this tour for India, but on the bowling front it has been a problem of plenty. 

With young VRV Singh impressive in the tour game against Rest of South Africa, Greg Chappell was wearing a happy look with the options at his disposal. 

VRV has been bowling close to 145mph and with good control too, said Chappell. 

The three for 35 he claimed in the second innings has not only bowled him into contention for the first Test, starting in Johannesburg, from Friday, but has also put pressure on Irfan Pathan. 

The thing is, Pathan has been bowling around the same speed he has bowled all through his international career, said Chappell . 

That Pathan is still struggling to make an impression hasnt been lost on Chappell, who apparently has approached Pakistan legend Wasim Akram to do some correctives on the left-arm pacer. 

Akram, always eager to help Pathan or any one who seeks him out, has agreed to make himself available for a session or two. This was during the one-dayers and since then Pathan has picked up the phone and approached Akram and the meeting could happen before the first Test in Johannesburg. It might be noted that Akram had helped Pathan earlier, too. (PTI)

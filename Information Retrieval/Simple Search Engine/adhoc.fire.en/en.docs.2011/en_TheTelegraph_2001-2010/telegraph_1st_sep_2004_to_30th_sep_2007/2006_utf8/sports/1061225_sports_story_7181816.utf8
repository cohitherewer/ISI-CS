The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Sreesanth can have a long career 

 Shaun Pollock

Senior pro Shaun Pollock had a few things to say on Sunday. 

Here go excerpts 

On Makhaya Ntini not having been a big factor in the first Test: He has set high standards and when he has an average Test, people start questioning... He may not have looked good, but still picked up six wickets... Makhaya is a fantastic performer. 

On Sreesanth: He bowled superbly and has a nice action... He held the seam upright and when thats the case, anything can happen. If properly managed, he has a long career ahead. 

On the best Indian attack he has seen: The one which had Jawagal Srinath. 

On his future: As always, I assess it at the end of the season... Im not making any retirement-announcement...

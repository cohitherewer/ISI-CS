The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Portuguese 

 did well to survive ugly battle

 On Target 

 Shyam Thapa

 A 

 match, which promised to scale new heights, turned into 

 a bloody, bruised and bad-tempered battle on Sunday night 

 to claim a place in World Cup history for all the wrong 

 reasons. A beautifully executed goal by Maniche got washed 

 away in the deluge of four red and 16 yellow cards. It was 

 football at its ugliest. 

 Both The Netherlands and Portugal 

 have their own football history. Marco van Bastens 

 side has a special place in World Cup folklore, thanks to 

 their two final appearances. Portugal, on the other hand, 

 featured in the 1966 semi-finals. The exploits of Johan 

 Cruyff and Eusebio are still admired all over the globe. 

 Seeing their countrymen fight, instead of playing football, 

 was a painful experience. 

 I feel Russian referee Valentin 

 Ivanov made a mess of this match. At one point of time, 

 I was wondering who will be the next in his line of fire. 

 In the end, Portugal won 1-0 and 

 set up a mouth-watering quarter final with 1966 champions 

 England. The chance of emulating that Eusebio-powered feat 

 is very much real.

 The start of the match hardly 

 suggested what was to come. In the 23rd minute, Deco sent 

 in a low cross for Pauleta, who laid it off for Maniche 

 on the right. The midfielder side-stepped Andre Ooijers 

 challenge before unleashing a sweetly-timed right-footer. 

 Even the tall Edwin van der Sar couldnt stop it.

 The Dutch enjoyed better ball 

 possession, but could not translate it to anything threatening. 

 Even when Portugal were down to 10 men, and then nine, inexperience 

 in the Dutch attack came through because of Van Nistelrooys 

 absence. True, Van Bastens side had conceded just 

 two goals in the group stage and held Argentina goalless, 

 but against big teams, you need inspiration up front. Without 

 Nistelrooy, that vital element was missing. 

 Leaving him on the bench was Van 

 Bastens biggest mistake. Why was the Manchester United 

 striker kept out? Was it due to some personal problem? Is 

 the coachs ego bigger than the countrys interests? 

 Van Nistelrooys replacement Dirk Kuyt didnt 

 make much of an impact, and this allowed the Portugal defence 

 some breathing space when they were a man short.

 Figo amp; Co. played their hearts 

 out in defending the lead and full credit to them and coach 

 Scolari for displaying this combative spirit. 

 Portugal may have crossed a tough 

 hurdle, but in doing so, had to pay a heavy price. Deco 

 and Costinha were red-carded and thus will be out of the 

 England match. Moreover, as many as five others ? including 

 Figo ? are on one booking. 

 Khalid Boulahrouzs challenge 

 on Cristiano Ronaldo was a clear red-card offence, but I 

 hope the injury doesnt force the young Portuguese 

 out of the quarter final. Portugal now have a different 

 battle to fight against England.

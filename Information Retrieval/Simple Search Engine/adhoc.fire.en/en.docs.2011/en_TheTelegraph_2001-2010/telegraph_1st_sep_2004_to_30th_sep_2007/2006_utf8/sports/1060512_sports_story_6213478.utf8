 PCB asked to better facilities

 Peshawar Stadium

 Islamabad: Dissatisfied 

 with arrangements at the Arbab Niaz Stadium in Peshawar, 

 the ICC has asked the PCB to improve facilities there before 

 slotting any international match in the future.

 The ICC told us after the 

 ODI against India (in February) that it was not satisfied 

 with conditions at the stadium in Peshawar and we needed 

 to improve facilities there for the teams, match officials 

 and media, a PCB source was quoted as saying by a 

 Pakistani daily. (PTI)

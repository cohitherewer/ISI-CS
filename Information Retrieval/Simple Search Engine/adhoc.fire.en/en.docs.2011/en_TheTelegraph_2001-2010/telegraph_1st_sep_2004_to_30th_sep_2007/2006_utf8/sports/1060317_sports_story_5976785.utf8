 Shoaib starts light training

Lahore: Pakistani fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar said on Thursday that recent surgery on both of his knees would not hamper his career, adding that he was set to return in two months time. 

I have started light training and will be back in action on Pakistans tour to England late June, Akhtar said. 

Pakistan will play four Tests and five ODIs in England this summer. Akhtar said that his operations went smoothly and vowed they would not shorten his much talked about long bowling run-up. 

The arthroscopy went well and now I have started upper body training and will start light cycling and swimming from next week. The operation wont curtail my run-up and wont have any affect on my bowling. (AFP)

 India favourites vs Lanka

Karachi: India would start favourites when they take on Sri Lanka in the final of the Womens Asia Cup Cricket tournament here on Wednesday. 

India have beaten the eves from the Emerald Isle as well as hosts Pakistan twice each in convincing fashion and are tipped to take the trophy at the National Stadium in the competitions second edition. 

The regional powerhouses, who made it to the world cup finals in South Africa last year, defeated Sri Lanka by 10 wickets in both their round robin league encounters. 

For India, openers Rumeli Dhar and Mithali Raj have been in top form regularly giving their team a good start. 

The Sri Lankan batting has been a disappointment in the competition as the team has managed a top score of only 178 so far in the tournament. They would look towards Dumila Dedunu for putting up a good score. (PTI)

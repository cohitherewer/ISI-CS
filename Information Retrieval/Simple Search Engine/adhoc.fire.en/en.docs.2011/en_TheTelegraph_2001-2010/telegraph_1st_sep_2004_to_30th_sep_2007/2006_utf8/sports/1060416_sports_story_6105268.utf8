The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 East Bengal face Dempo test today

Mumbai: East Bengal have a tough task when they take on holders Dempo Sports Club of Goa in the 13th round of the ONGC National Football League (NFL) clash at the Cooperage Ground here on Sunday. 

The Calcutta giants and former winners of the league are sitting pretty at the top of table with 24 points from eleven games. The Goan outfit are lying fifth with 19 points from 12 ties. 

The match promises to be as much a battle between the leagues top two goal scorers ? frontrunner Ranty Martins (10 goals) of Dempo and East Bengal stalwart Bhaichung Bhutia (9) ? as between the rival outfits. 

Both the players have shown their proficiency in front of the target in this edition of the league, both having conjured hattricks in the tournament. 

Ranty achieved the feat against Mumbais top outfit Mahindra United in January in Goa, while Bhaichung did likewise against Sporting Clube de Goa in March in Calcutta. 

Incidentally Dempo lost to the red-and-golds 3-5 when they met at the Salt Lake Stadium on March 26. 

 Mahindra win 

Meanwhile in Ludhiana, a goal by Brazilian Jose Ramirez Barreto was enough for Mahindra United to beat JCT Mills in the 10th NFL match at the Guru Nanak Stadium on Saturday. 

The win took Mahindras tally to 23 points and they are now just one point behind current leaders East Bengal. 

Barreto scored the lone goal via a header in the 56th minute off a Sushanth pass from the right plank. (PTI)

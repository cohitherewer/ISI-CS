Calcutta: Cricket Association of Bengal president Jagmohan Dalmiya was among the first to arrive at the Eden Gardens for the emergent meeting of its affiliates on Sunday. Prasun Mukherjee, who is contesting the presidents post at the forthcoming AGM, entered at 3.35 pm, almost 15 minutes after Dalmiya had made his way to his chamber. 

Only five of the 121 affiliates went unrepresented ? three first division clubs, one second division club and one university. 

While there was no dearth of heavyweights at the meeting, the one who easily made himself available to the media was Ajit Panja. The chief minister was not right in commenting on Dalmiya. The members must have the right to make their choice, declared Panja. 

Asked whether he was in favour of Dalmiya staying as president, he said: I dont want to comment on that. But a change does bring in new ideas. 

Meanwhile, Dalmiya has sent a letter to the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) demanding that their letter withholding subsidies and payments to the association be withdrawn, and an unconditional apology tendered at the earliest. In the event of non-compliance, he has threatened to take legal steps. 

The letter, dated July 1 and addressed to secretary Niranjan Shah, alleged the Board was following the doctrines of unfairness and bad faith in its acts and conducts. 

If the acts and conduct of the BCCI, including contents of your letter of June 29 are considered, it would be explicitly clear that the BCCI is following the doctrines of unfairness and bad faith, apart from acting arbitrarily and capriciously, Dalmiya said in the strongly worded letter. 

Without prejudice and reserving all my accrued rights and entitlements, you are hereby called upon to withdraw your letter under reference and tender an unconditional apology forthwith. 

In the event of non-compliance, appropriate steps, as I may be legally advised, would be initiated against you personally at your peril and consequences. 

Describing as false and frivolous the charge that he had failed to reply to the show cause, Dalmiya said the chain of motivated and capricious acts and conduct of the BCCI depict an arbitrary and malafide game plan. 

Dalmiya claimed that he could not reply to the show cause notice as his authorised representative was allowed to inspect only about 20 per cent of the total documents and records related to the show cause. 

It is a matter of record and indisputable fact that as on date, I have not been provided with either any intimation for inspection of (remaining) documents or copies of the same.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Rohan, Laxmi in fine fettle

 - RANJI TIE vs GUJARAT 

 Ranadeb bags 4/65; Parthiv falls for 103

Calcutta: At tea on Day Two, Bengals score of 165 for five didnt read too promising, with another 165 still required to overtake Gujarats first-innings total. The hosts men in form Abhishek Jhunjhunwala and Manoj Tewari, who scored a century and an unbeaten double, respectively, against Mumbai were among the five dismissed in their Ranji Super League encounter at the Eden. Even skipper Deep Dasgupta, another dependable batsman, had fallen cheaply. 

With their last recognised pair Laxmi Ratan Shukla and Rohan Gavaskar at the crease, crossing 329 looked a tall order. 

At the end of the days play, though, the scoreboard read a much healthier 227 for five with Gavaskar and Shukla in an unbroken 53-run partnership. 

Known for his ability to perform when the chips are down, Gavaskars unbeaten 45 was an innings of determination personified (theres more to be done, the man himself said). In his knock spanning over three hours, he not only guarded against a deeper slide (a la Gujarat the previous day) but also made sure his stand with Laxmi who is batting on 50 frustrated Gujarat. 

Gavaskar Junior took guard at a time when everything seemed to be going right for the hosts. But with Tewari dissecting the field at ease with drives and flicks, Bengal climbed from 90 132 in no time. Parthiv was quick to spread the field, removing the three-slip cordon. 

For a moment, it looked like a one-day match, with Tewari stepping out to leggie Timil Patel in the 39th over. But in the very next over, it was curtains for Bengals CK Nayudu Trophy-winning captain who edged a Hitesh Majumdar away-swinger for Parthiv to bring off a diving catch. 

Four overs later, Deep was back, with Gavaskar being a mute spectator. From thereon, it was a battle for survival. 

In the morning, Parthiv got the three runs needed to reach his maiden Ranji century, but didnt stay long thereafter. Ranadeb Bose got the Gujarat captain for 103. 

Ranadeb finished with the best figures of four for 65. 

All in all, it was Bengal who ended the day on a high. Maybe it would be the turn of Parthivs men to spend a sleepless night. 

Footnote: Jagmohan Dalmiya came in to watch proceedings in the final session. 

And, yes, he hogged the limelight from then on. He exchanged pleasantries with Gaekwad, who was in charge of Team India when he was at the helm at BCCI.

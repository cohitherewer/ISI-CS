Calcutta: Ashok Kumar and Firoz Ali brought in identical cards which gave them a share of second place on Day I of the $400,000 inaugural Aamby Valley Asian Masters Championship on Thursday. 

According to information received here, the Indian duo was among a pack of four golfers at five-under 67, Adam Groom of Australia and Simon Hurd of Scotland being the others. They were just one stroke behind leader Hendrik Buhrmann of South Africa, giving the leaderboard a truly international flavour at the Aamby Valley City Golf Course. 

Mukesh Kumar and Uttam Singh Mundy (69 each) also did well in the first round of this new event on the Asian Tour. They were tied eighth with five others. Keith Horne of South Africa and Simon Griffiths of England were tied sixth at four-under. 

The other Indians at par or under were Dinesh Kumar and SSP Chowrasia (tied 16th with 70); Gurbaaz Mann and Amandeep Johl (tied 22nd with 71); Ali Sher, Pappan, C. Muniyappa and Ranjit Singh (tied 31st with 72). Harmeet Kahlon and Vijay Kumar, who both managed 77, will have to do much better on Friday to make the cut. 

Veteran Buhrmann, into his 11th season in Asia, is hoping to lift his maiden title in Asia. The 42-year-old fired seven birdies en route to a six-under 66. A dropped shot on the 16th hole cost him a share of the course record. 

Before I die, I want to win one here. You never know, this might be the week, said Buhrmann, who was fourth in the Swazi Open, a South African Tour event he won in 2005. 

I went back home to play in the Swazi Open and I went in there for a holiday and finished fourth. I said I might as well have the same holiday attitude here, said Buhrmann, who has finished runner-up four times in Asia. 

Ashok, who was indisposed and had very little practice over the last two days, got off to a solid start. He capitalised on the par-fives, going four-under on those holes. The highlight was on the 12th when he crunched a six iron to two feet for a tap-in eagle. 

Firoz had seven birdies and one eagle, but also three bogeys. The key was to stay on the fairways. Today I got into the rough a few times and ended with bogeys on three holes, said Firoz.

 Yuvraj: For now, its a huge relief

 - Dr Joshi feels surgery isnt needed at this point in time 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Yuvraj Singh 

Calcutta: Had destiny not played its hand, Yuvraj Singh wouldve been in Mumbai on Monday, running a last-minute check on the musts for yet another tour of South Africa. 

Instead, our key middle-order batsman was at his New Delhi residence, awaiting a visit from Dr Anant Joshi, the orthopaedic surgeon relied on most by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI). 

Eventually, Dr Joshi spent around half-an-hour examining his left knee which went for a six during a game of kho-kho on the eve of the Champions Trophy match against Australia, in Mohali, late last month. 

According to Dr Joshi, surgery isnt required at this point in time and, so, conservative treatment will be followed. 

Once the examination was completed, both Yuvraj and Dr Joshi spoke to Team India physio John Gloster, who was in Mumbai. 

For now, its a huge relief Im happy to the extent I can be However, Im keeping fingers crossed An operation could, after all, make it touch-and-go for the World Cup, Yuvraj told The Telegraph. 

As was feared, the left-hander wont be available for the Tests, too, in South Africa. Officially, thus far, hed only been ruled out of the ODIs. 

Assuming theres no surgery, Yuvraj may be back in action during the home series versus the West Indies, featuring four ODIs between January 21-30. 

The World Cup is in March-April and the 30 probables have (as of now) to be named by January 11-12. 

Yuvraj, who was contacted on his cellphone, added: Dr Joshi expressed satisfaction with the recovery and has suggested somewhat more demanding exercises Hes going to assess me once again (either in Chandigarh or New Delhi) after a fortnight or so. 

The full-fledged rehab will begin after that, assuming an operation isnt required. 

That assessment should give a clear picture, which is why fingers have to remain crossed till then, Yuvraj pointed out. 

Sources in the BCCI, by the way, suggested a trip to South Africa or Australia would be a possibility once the rehab proper got underway. 

For the record, a statement from the BCCI included the following: The Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) management plan is to give Yuvraj the best chance of being available for the World Cup 

There are many cases of players playing at the highest level of all sports with ACL deficient knees and we feel that because of the time frame involved (for the World Cup), we would like to continue with this (conservative) approach 

One hopes for the best.

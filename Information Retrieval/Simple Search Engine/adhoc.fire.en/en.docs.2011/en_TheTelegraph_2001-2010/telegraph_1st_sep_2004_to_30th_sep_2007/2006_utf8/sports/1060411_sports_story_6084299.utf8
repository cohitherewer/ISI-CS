Fatullah (Bangladesh): Mighty Australia faced the embarrassing prospect of having to follow on against lowly Bangladesh after another stellar performance by the home side in the first Test here on Monday. 

Bangladesh had reduced Australia to 145 for six by stumps on the second day after scoring 427. The visitors need another 83 to avoid the follow-on. 

Adam Gilchrist (51) and Brett Lee (13) were the unbeaten batsmen as Bangladeshs spinners held centrestage after their Australian counterpart Stuart MacGill had produced his best performance in Tests. 

Australia were fresh from their memorable 3-0 Test series win in South Africa but struggled in totally different conditions. 

The ball kept low when they came in to bat and Bangladeshs left-arm spin-pair of Mohammed Rafique and Enamul Haque Junior struck telling blows after early breakthroughs by the new-ball bowlers. 

Rafique bowled Damien Martyn (four) with a ball that skidded through and then castled opener Michael Hussey (23) between bat and pad. 

Haque bowled Michael Clarke (19) and had Shane Warne (six) caught behind by Khaled Mashud as the visiting side fell to 93 for six. 

Gilchrists brisk 74-ball knock, including seven fours and two sixes, was the lone bright spot for Australia after the early collapse. 

The slide started when opener Matthew Hayden (six) was trapped leg-before by Mashrafe Bin Mortaza. Captain Ricky Ponting fell similarly to another paceman Shahadat Hossain, the ball keeping low on both occasions. 

Earlier, MacGill returned a career-best haul of eight for 108, bagging all five remaining wickets on Monday to restrict Bangladesh after they resumed on 355 for five. 

Bangladesh crossed 400 in Tests for only the fourth time. It was their second best total after 488 against Zimbabwe in Chittagong last year during their only Test win.

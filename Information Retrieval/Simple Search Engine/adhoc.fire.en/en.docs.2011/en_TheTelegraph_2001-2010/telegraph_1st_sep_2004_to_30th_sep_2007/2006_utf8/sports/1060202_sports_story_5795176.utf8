 Deep not losing hope yet

A CORRESPONDENT

Lucknow: Despite conceding a 14-run first-innings lead to UP on the penultimate day of the Ranji Trophy final, Bengal captain Deep Dasgupta hasnt given up hopes. 

We are still in contention... A couple of wickets in the morning session will brighten chances of an outright win. But to make that happen we have to be more organised and focused, Deep said. 

The Bengal captain agreed that the reprieves given to his opposite number Mohammed Kaifs could have made the difference. 

Meanwhile, Deep submitted a letter to Match Referee Manu Nayar saying that he had been misquoted about his comments on umpiring decisions. 

He said comments attributed to him in the media were inaccurate, said a team official. 

Deep told mediapersons after Tuesdays play that a few bad decisions had been crucial for Bengal.

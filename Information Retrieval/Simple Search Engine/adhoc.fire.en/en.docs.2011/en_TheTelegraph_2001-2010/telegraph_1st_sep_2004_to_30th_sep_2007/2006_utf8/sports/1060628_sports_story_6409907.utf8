The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Hope to extend winning streak, says Federer

London: World No. 1 Roger Federer broke Bjorn Borgs record grasscourt winning sequence on Tuesday when he completed a dazzling 6-3, 6-2, 6-2 first round victory over Frenchman Richard Gasquet. 

Federer, who equalled Borgs run of 41 when he beat Czech Tomas Berdych in the Halle final earlier this month, said he was more happy with his form than yet another statistic. 

Any streak is nice and Im still going, hopefully I can make it last longer, said the 24-year-old who racked up 35 winners against the free-swinging Gasquet, one of only four players to beat him in 2005. 

Hes a big talent on any surface, and its one of the toughest draws Ive had and to come up and play so well, Im very happy, especially over two days. 

To come through today was my only wish and not really to break a streak, added Federer, who faces Tim Henman in the second round. 

Thats as tough as it gets in the second round, he said. I was hoping he wouldnt be in my section because he was always a dark horse earlier in my career. 

Federers domination on the sports slickest surface began at Halle in 2003. While the Swiss has accumulated his 42 victories with four Halle titles and three All England Club crowns, Borgs run of 41 all came at Wimbledon.

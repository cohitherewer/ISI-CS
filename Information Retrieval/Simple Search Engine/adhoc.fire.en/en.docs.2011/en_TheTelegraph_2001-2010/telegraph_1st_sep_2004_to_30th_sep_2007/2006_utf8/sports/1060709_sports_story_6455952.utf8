The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Germany, Portugal 0-0 at half-time

Stuttgart: Germany and Portugal were drawing at half-time with no goals but plenty of action at both ends in their third-place World Cup match on Saturday. 

Portugal goalkeeper Ricardo had to stretch in the 20th minute to tip a Sebastian Kehl shot over the crossbar and five minutes later lunged to stop a blazing, curling free-kick from Lukas Podolski, named the World Cups Best Young Player. 

Germanys Oliver Kahn was tested in the 15th minute when Pauleta found space on the left but the goalkeeper, inserted into the line-up for Jens Lehmann, made a superb block. 

Both teams made several changes. Most were due to injury and expected but Portugal captain Luis Figo was surprisingly left on the bench by coach Luiz Felipe Scolari. His place was taken by Simao Sabrosa, who played alongside Pauleta up front. 

The 33-year-old Figo, who is expected to retire from international soccer after this World Cup, was rested in one of the three changes to the Portugal side. 

Germany made five changes, with captain Michael Ballack sitting out owing to a knee injury. 

With Ballack absent, Kahn was captain on his 86th appearance. Klinsmann made Jens Lehmann his starting goalkeeper in April, relegating Kahn to the bench. But Klinsmann, in consultation with Lehmann, decided to let Kahn play at least one more World Cup game. 

Germany defenders Per Mertesacker and Arne Friedrich also missed out because of injury, and were replaced by Jens Nowotny and Marcell Jansen. Robert Huth was to start, but was injured in the warm-up and replaced by Nowotny. 

While warming up Robert Huth suffered a painful injury to his ankle and had to come off, the German football association (DFB) said in a statement. 

Huth had been listed in the official Fifa starting list. 

Philipp Lahm switched from right-back to left-back to accommodate Jansen. 

With midfielder Tim Borowski also injured, Sebastian Kehl took a defensive midfield position. 

Figo was replaced by Simao Sabrosa on the Portugal wing, while Paulo Ferreira came in for injured Miguel at right-back, and Ricardo Carvalhos suspension meant defender Ricardo Costa got his first World Cup appearance. 

Right back Miguel limped out of Portugals 0-1 semi-final defeat against France.

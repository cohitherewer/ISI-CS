 Atwal falters on Day 2

La Quinta: Arjun Atwal shot a two-over 74 to slip 11 places to 57th on the second day in his quest to earn a full card for the 2007 US PGA Tour. 

The Indian, who was 140th on money list this year, will need to pull his socks to get into the top-30 for the coveted card. 

With three bogeys on the front-nine and a single birdie on the 15th hole, Atwal has a total of 146. The Indian earned a conditional card with a 140th rank last season which allows him to compete in 15 events in 2007. 

Edward Loar continued his consistent run when he fired his second straight one-under-par 71. The 29-year-old American, who won two Asian Tour titles, shot two birdies against a lone bogey for a two-day total of two-under-par 142 in joint 15th place.

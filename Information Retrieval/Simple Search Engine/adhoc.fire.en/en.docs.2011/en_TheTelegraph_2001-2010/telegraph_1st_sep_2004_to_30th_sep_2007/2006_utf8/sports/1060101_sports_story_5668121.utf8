 NZ romp to 7-wkt win

Queenstown: Newcomers Jamie How and Peter Fulton shared a 95-run partnership to guide New Zealand to a seven-wicket win over Sri Lanka on Saturday in the resumption of a ODI series interrupted by last years tsunami. 

How and Fulton recorded their first limited-overs half-centuries as New Zealand overhauled Sri Lankas modest total of 164 with only three wickets down. 

How made 58, the second-highest score by a New Zealander on one-day debut, while Fulton, in his second ODI, made a fluent, unbeaten 70.

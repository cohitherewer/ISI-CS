 Hilton Head Island: Arjun 

 Atwal found the bogey trail on his back nine as he dropped 

 five shots in his last 10 holes to hamper his chances of 

 a top-10 finish at the Verizon Heritage Classic golf tournament 

 on the US Tour.

 Atwal, who is coming off a poor 

 run of four missed cuts, was five-under through eight holes 

 and comfortably inside top-10, when he began dropping shots. 

 He is now five-under for three days and lying tied 20th.

 Aaron Baddeley shot a 66 to tie 

 for the lead with Jim Furyk (68) at 14-under. Baddeley is 

 looking for his first PGA Tour win.

 Billy Mayfair (68) is three shots 

 behind at 11-under, while Jerry Kelly (66) and Ernie Els 

 (65) are at 10-under. Els shot a 65, tying for the lowest 

 score of the day, to get back in contention.

 Furyk last won at the Cialis Western 

 Open, while Baddeley is attempting a maiden win.

 Atwal, lying 16th at midway stage, 

 opened in a great fashion with birdies on first two holes 

 and then came an eagle on the fifth followed by a birdie 

 on six. At that stage he was five-under through six holes.

 Two pars followed and then trouble 

 began. Atwal dropped shot on ninth and again on tenth after 

 the turn. 

 Another bogey followed on 12th 

 before he settled for pars on next five holes. But before 

 he could heave a sigh of relief, he double bogeyed the 18th 

 and dropped to par 71 for the day and stayed at five-under 

 for the tournament and in 20th place.

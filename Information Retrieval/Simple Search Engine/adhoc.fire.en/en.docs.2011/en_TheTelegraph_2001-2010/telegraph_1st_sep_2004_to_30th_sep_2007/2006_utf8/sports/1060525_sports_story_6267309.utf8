 Anju falls to No. 6

 IAAF Ranking

 New Delhi: Anju Bobby Georges 

 recent lacklustre performances have resulted in her dropping 

 two spots to number six in the latest IAAF womens 

 long jump rankings.

 The ace Indian athlete fell from 

 the fourth place she had been holding for the past two months.

 After the Melbourne Commonwealth 

 Games where the lanky Keralite finished sixth, she took 

 time off but her fortunes did not show an upswing on her 

 return to the circuit.

 She finished a lowly seventh 

 at the Doha Super Grand Prix earlier this month and, to 

 make matters worse, suffered a heel injury during training 

 which forced her out of the first leg of the Asian Grand 

 Prix circuit in Bangkok.

 She returned to competition in 

 front of her home crowd in Bangalore, but had to settle 

 for a silver medal with a jump of 6.35m. The gold went to 

 little known Olga Rypakova of Kazakhstan. 

 Russias Tatyana Kotova continues 

 to head the rankings while the big gainer was her compatriot 

 Oksana Udmurtova, the gold medallist at Doha, who rose three 

 spots to number two. (PTI)

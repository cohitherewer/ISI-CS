London: Goals from Didier Drogba and Joe Cole gave Premier League leaders Chelsea a 2-1 victory over West Bromwich Albion in a bad-tempered Hawthorns clash on Saturday. 

Drogba punished some half-hearted defending shortly after half-time to drill a low shot past Tomasz Kuszczak and Cole wrapped up the points with a close-range effort 10 minutes after replacing Damien Duff. 

Substitute Nwankwo Kanu gave West Brom a lifeline with three minutes remaining but Chelsea hung on to strengthen their position at the top. 

In between their goals, Chelsea winger Arjen Robben was shown a straight red card for a reckless lunge on Jonathan Greening ? a decision met with sarcastic applause towards referee Mark Halsey by Chelsea coach Jose Mourinho. 

It should have been a yellow card not a red, I didnt think it was two-footed, Chelsea captain John Terry said. 

The England defender also explained the late appearance of Chelseas players for the start of the second half, an incident that provoked the first of several slanging matches between Mourinho and West Brom manager Bryan Robson. 

We got a bit of a telling off at half-time, Terry said. We got a bit of a kick up the backside. 

Mourinho also exchanged angry words with Robson after Drogba made a meal of challenge by Greening and the two managers did not shake hands at the final whistle. 

Arsenal revived their hopes of a top-four finish with a 4-0 thumping of Fulham at Craven Cottage to go fifth, West Hams surge was checked by a 2-2 home draw against Everton and Newcastle Uniteds improvement continued with a 3-1 defeat of Bolton Wanderers.

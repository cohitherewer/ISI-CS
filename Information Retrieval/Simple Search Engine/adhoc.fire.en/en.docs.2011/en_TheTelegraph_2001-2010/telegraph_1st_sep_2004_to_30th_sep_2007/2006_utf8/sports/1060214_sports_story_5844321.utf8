OUR CORRESPONDENT 

Dhanbad: An allround performnace by former India captain Sourav Ganguly and opener Subhamoy Das as Bengal outplayed Jharkhand sans wicketkeeper batsman Mahendra Singh Dhoni by nine wickets in their second East Zone one-dayer at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium on Monday. 

Sourav, the cynosure of all eyes, put up an allround performance scoring a magnificent 72 and then returning with a figure of two for 39 while bowling as Bengal continued their winning spree. Subhamoy Das unbeaten 126 off 132 balls was instrumental in Bengals successive win. 

Opting to bat first, the hosts piled up a competitive 245 for nine with Sanjay Tiwari top-scoring with 66 before being bowled by offie Sourashish Lahiri. In reply, Bengal lost only Souravs wicket with the team total at 159. Souravs 72 off 91 balls included four sixes and five hits to the fence. His four sixes came off consecutive deliveries in the 23 rd over. The hapless bowler was left-arm spinner Shahid Khan, who was the super sub for Sunny Gupta. Souravs sixes came off second, third, fourth and fifth deliveries. 

Bengal started their innings with a flurry of shots despatching the ball to every corner of the ground. Das in particular looked very aggressive and ensured that every loose ball were treated accordingly. In his individual score of 126 runs he hit 16 fours and two sixes. 

Sourav survived once at his individual score of 20. Trying to clear the ropes, Sourav was caught at long-on boundary by Shahid Khan off Mihir Diwakar, which fortunately was a no-ball. But after this he took the bowlers to task. 

After Souravs departure, Avishek Jhunjhunwala completed the last rites. Avishek remained unbeaten on 26 off 45 balls in which the ball crossed the fence only once. Earlier, while batting, Jharkhand team suffered an initial blow Manish Vardhan was caught behind by Bengal captain Deep Dasgupta of Shib Shankar Paul at his individual score of four in the opening over. Team total was six runs. Another opener Amir Hasmi followed Manish, who was bowled out for a duck off Ranadeb Bose after adding one run to the team total. 

However, the middle-order batsman debutant Saurav Tiwari and captain Rajiv Kumar stabilised the innings and scored 66 and 77, respectively. 

Sourav, Paul and Lahri shared six wickets equally.

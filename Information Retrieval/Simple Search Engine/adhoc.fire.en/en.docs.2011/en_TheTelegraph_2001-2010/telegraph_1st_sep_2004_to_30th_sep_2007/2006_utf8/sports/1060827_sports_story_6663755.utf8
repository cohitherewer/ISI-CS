Colombo: India had a mixed day in shooting at the South Asian Federation Games on Saturday, claiming the mens individual and team gold in rifle 3 position while being upstaged by Pakistan in both categories of 25mt standard pistol. 

India, who had fielded their second choice shooters, finished with an impressive haul of 18 gold, 10 silver and 5 bronze medals on the concluding day of the discipline. 

Imran Khan and Manoj Kumar won the individual gold and silver medals, respectively, in the rifle 3 position and then paired with Sushil Ghaley to clinch the team gold as well, making up to an extent for the loss to Pakistan in the mens 50m rifle 3 position earlier. The team event saw the Indians set a new Games record with a score of 3407, erasing their earlier mark of 3405 achieved in the 2004 games in Islamabad. 

In football, Indias campaign ended in shambles when they went down 0-2 to lowly Nepal in the bronze medal play-off. Jumanu Rai and Pradeep Maharjan scored for Nepal. In athletics, Susanthika Jayasinghe of Sri Lanka picked her third gold of the meet when she won the 100m, albeit with a forgettable timing of 11.32 seconds. The mens athletic showpiece event saw Rdus Surendra leave the rest of the field behind to claim the gold, clocking 10.51 seconds. 

An under-strength India was not to be left behind as Francis Sagairaj finished atop the podium with an effort of 1 minute 50.23 seconds in mens 800m. On the distaff, Pinki Pramanik confirmed her status as the athlete to watch out for in Asian Games after snatching the gold with a time of 2:03.81 seconds. 

Winner of the Asian Grand Prix meets in Bangalore and Pune, Pramanik had won the 400m gold on Friday. (PTI)

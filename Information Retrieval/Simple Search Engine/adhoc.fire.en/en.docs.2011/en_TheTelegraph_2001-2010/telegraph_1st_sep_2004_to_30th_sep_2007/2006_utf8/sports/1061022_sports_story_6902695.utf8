 Birthday-boy Martyn sizzles

 - England left looking at a miracle 

JAYDEEP BASU

 Damien Martyn in action on Saturday 

Jaipur: Damien Martyn, it seems, wanted to match the fireworks outside the stadium with his exhibition of strokes. In keeping with the Diwali mood at the Pink City, the elegant right-hander who turned 35 on Saturday hit a superb 78 to steer Australia to a six-wicket win over England in their Champions Trophy clash here. 

After dismissing England for 169 in 45 overs, Australia wrapped up the issue in the 37th over. 

On this festive day, people here preferred to stay at home than make a visit to the Sawai Man Singh Stadium to watch the battle of survival in group A. They didnt miss much except, but for a brief phase in the Australian pursuit when England gave a hint of making a match of it. It didnt happen as Martyn took charge, along with Michael Hussey, to keep Australia afloat in the tournament. 

While Australia breathed a sigh of relief after the Caribbean reversal, England suffered their second straight defeat. Technically, England are still hanging in, albeit by a slender thread. They will need more than a miracle to advance to the semis even if India or the West Indies win all their group league matches. 

The game looked headed for a predictable course after England slumped from 83 without loss to 169 all out. Adam Gilchrist and Shane Watson started the reply with a bang, tackling James Anderson and Sajid Mehmood firmly and confidently. 

But once the match got interrupted for 10 minutes due to a floodlights failure, the light seemed to have gone out of the Australian batting. Once play resumed, Mehmood forced Gilchrist to play on with a fine delivery. 

A mini collapse followed, with both Mehmood and Anderson bowling their hearts out. Ricky Ponting and Shane Watson were sent back in a span of two overs. The captain was superbly caught at slip by Andrew Strauss off Mehmood. Then Anderson castled Watson. 

With Australia on 34 for three, Andrew Flintoff decided to bring on Steve Harmison. Two overs from the giant paceman swung the match Australias way. 

It was Martyn who took the battle to the English camp with some brutal hitting. He struck Harmison for three fours in his first over. Two more boundaries followed in Harmisons next over. When Anderson was brought back in place of Harmison, the damage was already done as the latter had conceded 26 in two overs. 

Martyn didnt lose momentum thereafter. His 50 came in just 35 balls with the help of nine fours. He slowed down only when victory was in sight. When Harmison had Martyn im caught-behind for 78, England had no hopes left. Hussey provided Martyn excellent support with his unbeaten 32 off 85 balls. 

England, put into bat, flattered to deceive. The opening pair of Strauss and Ian Bell promised much with a bright 83-run stand. But once the pair was separated, the rot set in. 

Left-arm paceman Mitchell Johnson, who gave superb support to Watson, was responsible for sending back Pietersen early. After testing the right-hander with a rising ball, the next one was a full-length delivery that had Pietersen in two minds. All he managed was an edge to Gilchrist. Lee looked unimpressive, while McGrath, who bowled first-change, got some stick from the openers.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Jayasuriya, Vaas, Perera ruled out

 Jayasuriya

Colombo: Sri Lanka have been rocked by an injury crisis just 48 hours prior to the start of the one-day International series against Pakistan. 

Veteran Sanath Jayasuriya, Sri Lankas highest run-scorer in both forms of the game, and fast bowlers Chaminda Vaas and Ruchira Perera have been ruled out of the entire series. Jayasuriya has suffered a thigh strain, Vaas has a side strain, and Perera pulled a hamstring during a recent domestic semi-final. 

All three players have been ruled out of the entire one-day series, team manager Michael Tissera said on Wednesday. 

Sri Lankas selectors have named their replacements.

Jehan Mubarak has been called up to replace Jayasuriya, Lasith Malinga comes in for Perera and Dammika Prasad takes Vaas place, Tissera confirmed. 

Sri Lanka will be strengthened in the lower-order by the return of left-hander Russel Arnold after he was controversially dropped for the Bangladesh tour. 

Meanwhile, the Pakistan cricket team touring Sri Lanka walked out of practice on Tuesday after they were asked to share the venue with a group playing softball cricket. 

Its a disgrace, Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer said. When you are on an international touring side wanting a centre wicket (for practice) and cant get one, it looks a little strange.

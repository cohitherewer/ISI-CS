The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Asians can bid afresh by April 21

 2011 World Cup

 Dubai: The ICC has given 

 India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh the green light 

 to launch a new bid to host the 2011 World Cup.

 The four Asian countries missed 

 the February 20 deadline but have been allowed to make a 

 new bid by April 21 which will subsequently be discussed 

 at an ICC board meeting in Dubai nine days later.

 Australia and New Zealand have 

 already made a joint bid for the event and have raised questions 

 about discussing the late bid from the four Asian countries.

 We did reach an impasse 

 and its fair to allow more time for the Asian countries 

 to make a fresh bid, ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed 

 said on Tuesday after a two-day meeting in Dubai.

 With the ICC announcing plans 

 last month to stage a Twenty20 world championship in September 

 2007, the governing body wants to finalise venues for both 

 forms of limited overs cricket.

 Should the board accept 

 the (2011 World Cup) bid (from the Asian nations), we will 

 ask for assurances from all member countries for participation 

 in the (inaugural) ICC Twenty20 Cup, said Speed.

 It wouldnt be mandatory 

 for the 2007 edition (of the Twenty20 Cup) but from 2009 

 and thereafter, it will be.

 CA demands explanation

Melbourne: Cricket Australia (CA) Monday demanded an explanation from the International Cricket Council (ICC) for sacking Darrell Hair as a member of the Elite Panel while asking it to review its management of umpires. 

CA chief executive officer James Sutherland said CA believed Hair was still one of the best umpires in the world but more important was that appropriate processes should be followed should there be performance concerns about umpires. 

Meanwhile, the England and Wales Cricket Board was contemplating appointing Hair in its panel of first-class umpires, a report said.

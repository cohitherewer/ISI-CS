 School cricketer still missing

Patiala: Eighteen-year-old cricketer Dalbir Singh, who had gone on a 14-day tour to England along with a local team of the DAV Public School, is still missing even as efforts have been stepped up to locate him. 

Dalbir had left Patiala on July 8 to play two practice matches and a five-day triangular series organised by a London club. However, he went missing last Monday after the team was dropped for shopping in Middlesbrough. (PTI)

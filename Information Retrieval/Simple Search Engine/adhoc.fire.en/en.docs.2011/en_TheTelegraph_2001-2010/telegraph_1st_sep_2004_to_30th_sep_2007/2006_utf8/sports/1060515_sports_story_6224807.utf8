Calcutta: Ashok Kumar, who was in sole lead with seven holes to go, slipped badly to drop out of contention and ended tied fifth in the inaugural $400,000 Aamby Valley Asian Masters Tournament at the Aamby Valley City Golf Course in Lonavla on Sunday. 

According to information received here, after a tense fight over the first 12 holes, the battle petered out in the closing stages. Ashok gave away far too many shots and Simon Hurd dropped a double bogey on 17th, leaving the South African veteran Hendrik Buhrmann with a two-shot cushion on the 18th tee. That helped Buhrmann end an agonising 11-year wait for a first title in Asia with a two-stroke triumph. 

The 42-year-old carded a final round of one-under-par 71 for a winning total of 11-under-par 277. While Hurd, who at one stage looked to win, faltered with a double bogey on the 17th and finished with a 73 and a total of nine-under 279 for second place. 

Winner of eight titles in South Africa, Burhmann has always yearned for success in Asia which he regards as his second home and it took all his years of experience and fighting qualities to finally end his drought. 

Im feeling great. I said earlier in the year to some people that you know what, my dream is to win on the Asian Tour before I die. They really laughed at me but I really meant it. A few months later, Ive got my dream come true. Im really happy, said Buhrmann, who picked up a cheque of $63,400. We all need money but the win for me is so fantastic. Im just over the moon. 

Australian Terry Pilkadaris (70) finished third, a further stroke back, while compatriot Marcus Both (72) grabbed the fourth place on 283. Ashok tied for fifth with Garth Mulroy, Kane Webber and Simon Griffiths.

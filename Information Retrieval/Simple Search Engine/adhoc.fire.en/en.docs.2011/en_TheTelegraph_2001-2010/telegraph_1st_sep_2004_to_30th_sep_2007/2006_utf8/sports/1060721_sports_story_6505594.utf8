 Jeev Milkha at tied ninth spot

Hokkaido: Jeev Milkha Singh shrugged aside the disappointment of missing out on the British Open by firing a card of two-under 70 that placed him tied ninth after the first round. 

The 34-year-old Indian, who last week rose to 148th in the world and is presently the highest ranked Indian, may well have had a better day but for three bogies between the 13th and the 16th. 

Jeev got off to a blistering start with four birdies in his first five holes. He picked up shots on the first, third, fourth and fifth holes before dropping one on the seventh. But he suffered a slide on the back nine making bogeys on 13th, 15th and 16th, before picking up a shot on the 18th to round off the day. The Chandigarh golfer needed just 10 putts on the front nine and 19 on the back stretch. 

The lead after the first round was held by Masamichi Uehira who shot a five-under 67. He started from the 10th and had three consecutive birdies from the 13th and another three between the first and the fourth. He closed with bogeys on eighth and ninth. 

Y. E. Yang, Kunihiro Kamii, Koumei Oda and Kouki Idoki were tied for second spot at four-under 68 each. (PTI)

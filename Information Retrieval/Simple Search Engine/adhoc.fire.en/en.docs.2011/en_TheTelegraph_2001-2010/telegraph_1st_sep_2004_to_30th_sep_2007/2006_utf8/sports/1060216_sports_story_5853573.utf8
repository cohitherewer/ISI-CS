The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Dhoni is the best finisher right now

 - Sreesanth has been find of the series...

 India are playing their best cricket 

 at the moment. Sachin Tendulkar has been showing his talent 

 and proving what a world-class batsman he is. He played 

 an excellently-calculated innings in Lahore and together 

 with Rahul Dravid, did all the spade work before Yuvraj 

 and Dhoni delivered the killing blows.

 I think Dhoni is probably the 

 best finisher of the game in present day. I mean the way 

 he bats and delivers those deadly blows, is incredible. 

 Not shy of his poor footwork, he just thrashes the ball 

 to all parts of the park successfully and forcefully. It 

 appears that Dhoni has already established his superiority 

 over the Pakistani bowlers who are more eager to save themselves 

 from his ruthlessness instead of trying to attack his stumps.

 To me, the find of the series for India has undoubtedly 

 been Sreesanth and irrespective of what happens in the next 

 two days, this lad has the ability to go a long way and 

 serve his country with merit and distinction.

 He was unfortunate when three 

 catches, including Shoaib Maliks, were floored off 

 his bowling and he ended up with none for 74. But statistics 

 are at times deceptive. The pace he generated and the way 

 he caused all sorts of problems for the Pakistan batsmen 

 earlier in the innings, speaks volumes for the talent he 

 has.

 It is time for Inzamam-ul Haq 

 to put a cool thinking cap on his head and reassess the 

 situation.

 Pakistan have done the right thing 

 by recalling Mohammed Sami. I also believe Pakistan should 

 have also added Danish Kaneria to the squad because he has 

 this ability to take wickets.

 Malik is in rich form in this 

 series and twice in three games played so far, he has walked 

 on to the pitch in the first over.

 It wont be a bad decision 

 if he is straightaway sent to face the new ball. Younis 

 Khan has been a scourge for India in Tests while his contributions 

 in the one-day games are 18 not out, 81 and 16. Considering 

 the position on which he is batting (lower middle-order), 

 I think Pakistan are wasting his talent and not making optimum 

 use of his form. But even after this batting order, the 

 key is that Inzamam and Yousuf have to fire. Besides, Inzamam 

 should now understand that in the present situation, his 

 teams strength ? bowling ? has now become his weakness.

 Inzamam decided to bat first in 

 Rawalpindi and said in Lahore that he would have batted 

 first had he won the toss. 

 Without Shoaib Akhtar, a half-fit 

 Shahid Afridi, inexperienced Umar Gul and Mohammed Asif, 

 and a struggling Rana Naved-ul Hasan, I dont understand 

 how Inzamam thought he would be able defend the target.

 If he persists with this strategy 

 of defending targets, I see curtains for Pakistan!

London: Champions Chelsea were held to a 1-1 draw by Aston Villa, Liverpool lost 0-2 at Bolton Wanderers and Arsenal had to come from behind to beat Charlton Athletic 2-1 on a trying Saturday for the Premier Leagues top clubs. 

Chelseas Ivory Coast striker Didier Drogba, who hit a Champions League hattrick in their midweek win at Levski Sofia, opened the scoring in the second minute. But Villa winger Gabriel Agbonlahor levelled on the stroke of halftime to earn Martin Neills side a point and end Chelseas 11-match winning run at home in all competitions. 

A controversial strike by midfielder Gary Speed set Bolton on their way against Liverpool, while Dutch forward Robin van Persie scored twice for Arsenal at The Valley, two days after Arsene Wenger celebrated 10 years as club manager. 

Manchester City snatched a late 1-1 draw at Everton, while Sheffield United were facing Middlesbrough in the late kick-off. 

Despite the draw, Chelsea remain top of the table on 16 points, two ahead of Bolton. Manchester United, who play Newcastle on Sunday, are third on 13 points. 

Chelsea were clear favourites for their game at Stamford Bridge, having won every Premier League game there since January and made a dream start with Drogbas eighth goal of the season. 

However, Villa have been transformed under Neill and their fightback was rewarded when 19-year-old Agbonlahor headed an equaliser. 

Chelsea coach Jose Mourinho told Sky Sports: We did everything to win except put the ball in the net. In the second half they just defended. 

They had one chance and we had 10... it was not our day. For sure, it was our best game of the season in terms of good football and dominating your opponent. 

Mourinho also had encouraging words for Ukraine striker Andriy Shevchenko. I think he had maybe his best game... he needs a goal for his confidence, I think so. But like the team, hes improving. 

Over at The Valley, Arsenal were trailing to a Darren Bent strike before Van Persie levelled in the 32nd minute and followed up with an absolute stunner four minutes after the break volleying home a cross from the right from defender Emmanuel Eboue. 

It was a goal of a lifetime, Wenger said. It was a fantastic cross and he takes the ball with full power, full pace. Technically, his movement is perfect but at first I thought the ball would got out. It finished in the top corner.

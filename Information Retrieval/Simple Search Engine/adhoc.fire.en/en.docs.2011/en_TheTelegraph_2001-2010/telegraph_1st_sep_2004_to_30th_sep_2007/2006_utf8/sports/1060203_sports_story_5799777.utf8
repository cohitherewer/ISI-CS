 Test experiments are not working

On flat pitches, we saw batsmens encroachment of the bowling space and witnessed an undesired imbalance in the first two Tests of the Indo-Pak series. The Karachi pitch, which had a bit of moisture, allowed the bowlers to rule some sessions of the Test. 

It not only produced a result but also brought life to cricket. Although the result is too bitter for the Indians to digest, Pakistan have reassured their supremacy in the continent. India, who were in a position of strength initially, let the opportunities go abegging and lost the series. 

Irfan Pathan bowled what should have been a match-winning first over. But despite half the Pakistan side being back in the hut in the first hour, the last four batsmen won half the battle for the hosts by occupying the crease for the next five hours. 

One can accept the blinder of a knock played by Kamran Akmal but not the runs scored by controversial speedster Shoaib Akhtar. With Pakistan reeling at 39 for six, the Indian bowlers needed the element of intimidation. Instead, they allowed a match-winning partnership to develop. 

Pakistan have always been successful in finding great batsmen in wicketkeepers. After Moin Khan and Rashid Latif, its now the turn of Akmal to sparkle with the bat. 

There will be a lot of debate and discussions in the coming days on Indian opening slots. The idea of moving the batsmen like a pawn of chess somehow seems ridiculous in a Test match situation. In one-dayers, such experiments seem to work as the pace of the game calls for innovation all the time. 

Laxman walking out to open the innings in Karachi was not a great idea at all. Sehwag is a regular opener, averaging around 100 against Pakistan. His absence gave the Pak bowlers a psychological advantage. 

Though Laxman had opened the innings in the initial part of his career, he had always been reluctant to do so as he felt his style of batting was more effective in the middle order. The positions for the batsmen in Tests assume high importance in the way they mentally prepare for the game. I have every reason to believe that the Rahul-Greg duo has gone too far in experimenting in Tests. 

When it comes to evaluating Pakistan batting, one must assess the Indian bowling too. Pakistan batting truly reflected the Indian bowling strength. One argument could be that the bowlers were completely drained after playing on two flat tracks earlier. 

But Irfan was the only pacer to have figured in all three Tests. It is not fair to compare the pacemen of the two countries, but it was clear that the Pakistan bowlers in tandem bowled above the threshold pace of 135 kmph whereas the Indians operated at a rather amicable pace. 

Zaheer and Irfan have bowled with much better pace and penetration in their careers. Both Zaheer, in his late 20s, and Irfan, in his early 20s, can afford to bowl with a yard or two of extra pace. 

When it comes to spinners, there is hardly any spinner in the world who has done well in Pakistan. 

The credit for winning the Test certainly goes to the Pakistan bowlers. Shoaib did not get many wickets, but it was his constant speed which helped the others like Razzaq and new find Asif to reap rewards. In fact, they both must contribute half their success to Shoaibs pace.

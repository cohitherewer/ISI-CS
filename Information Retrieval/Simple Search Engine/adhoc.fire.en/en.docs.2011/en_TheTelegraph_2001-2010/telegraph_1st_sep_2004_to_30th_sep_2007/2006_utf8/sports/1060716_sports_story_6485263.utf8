 Pak deserve No.2 ranking: Gatting

Karachi: Former England captain Mike Gatting has rated Pakistan as a team of several gifted players and says they deserve to be ranked No.2 in the rankings. 

They are not a bad side even without Shoaib (Akhtar), Rana (Naved-ul Hasan), Mohammed (Asif), Younis Khan and (Shoaib) Malik. Once these guys come back they would be a terrific team, Gatting said as he watched Pakistan on their opening day against England in the first Test at Lords. 

Gatting, however, said he was surprised at the way Pakistanis dropped catches paving the way for England to make a strong start. 

They really did drop some dollies. It might cost them, he was quoted as saying by a newspaper from London. Gatting also ridiculed suggestions by Pakistans bowling coach Waqar Younis, who said the players dropped the catches because of visibility problems at the ground. 

Ive played here quite often and there have never been any problems. Probably its the nerves, he said. (PTI)

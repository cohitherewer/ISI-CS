The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 My natural game paid dividends: Chopra

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The star of the day Aakash Chopra seemed a pleased man on Monday shortly after he plundered a brilliant unbeaten 135. I never expected to be in the zone side and for that I must thank the selectors who had faith in me and chose me to open the innings, was his first reaction. 

The former India opener, who has the knack of holding fort at the other end, played quite uncharacteristically with a flurry of shots on Monday. I played my natural game and it paid dividends. 

Asked about his bad patches in the last two years, Chopra pointed his fingers to the niggling injuries. The niggling injuries forced me out time and again and that affected by batting, he stated. 

According to the Delhi opener, he hasnt changed his stance or done anything overnight, but admitted that the pressure was mounting on him after not getting enough runs in the last two Duleep Trophy matches in Jamshedpur and Guwahati. The pressure was there, when I walked in, it vanished and I played my shots on a nice batting wicket, Chopra remarked adding that it is one of his best innings so far. 

Chopra is very much keen on carrying the good work on Day III too. We will have to bat the whole day put enough runs on the board to put the opponents under pressure in their second innings. 

The other performer Ravneet Ricky didnt mind the team managements decision to send him at No. 3. I opened for Punjab but in the zone side we have openers like Gautam and Aakash so Ricky said. 

After finishing the zone assignment, Ricky will start preparing for the Ranji Trophy match against Bengal starting on November 23 in Mohali. 

My aim will be carry on this form in the Ranji Trophy too, but now I am only thinking of this match and nothing else, he remarked.

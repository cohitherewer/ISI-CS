 Lucic retires, others may follow suit

Munich: Teddy Lucic left the World Cup and international soccer on a sour note. Sent off in Swedens 0-2 defeat against Germany, Lucic and several others may have played for the last time in the countrys yellow and blue. 

Lucic will keep on playing for his club team Hacken in the Swedish first division. 

It felt like a joke when he showed me the red card, said the Swedish. 

Lucic may not be the only player whos quitting. Fredrik Ljungberg, Henrik Larsson, Anders Svensson and Niclas Alexandersson have not made up their minds yet. Larsson was persuaded to return to the Swedish team for the World Cup. 

I havent made up my mind yet, but Im not so old and I think I can play again for Sweden. Well see, the 29-year-old midfielder said.

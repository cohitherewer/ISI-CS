The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Bagan loss a warning for us: Alvito

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: East Bengals captain for the season, Alvito DCunha, said on Tuesday that Mohun Bagans loss to Port Trust should serve as a warning to his team. That result is a clear warning to us that we cant take anything for granted, he said on the eve of East Bengals opening match against George Telegraph in the CFL Premier Division. 

Brazilian coach Carlos Roberto Pereira da Silva, is, however, seeking inspiration from a rare statistic. In my entire coaching career, Ive never lost the opening match of a tournament. Hopefully, that record wont be broken tomorrow, he said. 

According to him, the squads fitness level has increased to a large extent after a short residential camp in Barasat. All matches are vital to me. While Im not underestimating my opponents, Ill be looking for a win tomorrow, he said. 

Meanwhile, Bibiano Fernandes and Fredy Mascarenhas signed for East Bengal on Tuesday, but the coach ruled out the possibility of playing in the match. In all likelihood, Ashim Biswas and Gouranga Dutta will play upfront.

 England striker fit to play

 Wayne Rooney

 Baden Baden: England striker Wayne Rooney has 

 been declared fit to take part in the World Cup finals in 

 Germany, the BBC said on Wednesday.

 A scan taken earlier at a hospital in Manchester cleared 

 him to play although he is not expected to take part until 

 the later stages, if England get that far.

 Rooney flew back in a private jet to rejoin the England 

 squad at their base at Baden-Baden in southwest Germany 

 on Wednesday.

 The 20-year-old, widely regarded as key to Englands 

 hopes, broke his foot on April 29 in a Premier League match 

 for Manchester United against champions Chelsea.

 Coach Sven-Goran Eriksson has maintained that Rooneys 

 fitness and willpower will enable him to play his part in 

 a campaign, which starts on Saturday against Paraguay.

 Ive always said I think he will be available, 

 that he will take part in the World Cup and I still believe 

 it very, very strongly, Eriksson had said before the 

 scan.

 His optimism also reflected the sight of Rooney beginning 

 Tuesdays training session with the rest of the squad 

 before peeling off to continue his rehabilitation in the 

 glare of the media.

 Even the England teammates who want him back were keen to 

 put his injury saga to one side.

 Defender Gary Neville, one of the elder statesmen, said: 

 We havent got him for Saturday, I know that, 

 so thats all weve got to concentrate on and 

 focus our minds on.

 I know theres a great interest in Rooney throughout 

 the country and thats not going to stop.

 But it really is important we focus on Paraguay as 

 a team and not focus on players who arent there and 

 cant play.

 England midfielder Frank Lampard said Rooneys return 

 would be a lift.

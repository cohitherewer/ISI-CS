 Sinclair back after 2 years

Wellington: Mathew Sinclairs two-year exile from Test cricket has ended with the two-time double-centurion being recalled to the New Zealand squad to play Sri Lanka. 

Sinclair and the inclusion of specialist opener Craig Cumming were the major features of another top-order reshuffle for the two-Test series, which starts on Thursday. 

A knee injury to Kyle Mills sees inexperienced duo Michael Mason and Iain Brien return to bolster the pace attack spearheaded by Shane Bond.

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Imran Khan 

Lahore: Its not confirmed, but the entire Indian team could visit the Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital on Id (Wednesday). 

Well know for sure by Tuesday evening, assistant manager Wng Cdr M. Baladitya told The Telegraph. Even if everybody doesnt make the trip to an institution conceived by Imran Khan, the Sachin Tendulkars are definitely expected to go. 

Imran, who is currently in Islamabad, is going to be in Lahore on Id. In other words, he will be the host at Shaukat Khanum. 

On Thursday, though, Imran (now a member of the National Assembly) is going to be off to Dubai for a TV assignment.

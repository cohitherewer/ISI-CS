 More: County show will be considered 

Pune: Sourav Ganguly, who has still not lost hope of staging a comeback, can take heart from the statement of chief selector Kiran More who said on Friday that the performance of players in Counties would be considered during selection. 

Sourav, out of both the one-day and Test sides, has signed up for Northamptonshire Cricket Club for a two-month stint and is scheduled to play his first match for the Northants on June 25 in the C amp;G Trophy limited-overs tie against Nottinghamshire. 

County cricket is a different ball game but it still helps. Zaheer Khan and Dinesh Mongia are playing for counties. Individual performances like taking 100 wickets and scoring centuries in a County season does help and they can always make a comeback, he told reporters. (PTI)

 Richardson, Roberts slam WIPA

Port-of-Spain: Caribbean legends Richie Richardson and Andy Roberts on Monday flayed the West Indies Players Association (WIPA) for its unwillingness to negotiate the contracts issue and asking for more money. 

While former skipper Richardson said WIPA was pushing for too much money, Roberts said the players body was dragging its feet on a decision to hold a meeting with the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB). 

We are right down at the bottom of the table, and yet our players are demanding big money, a Caribbean newspaper quoted Richardson as saying. 

I dont like to compare, but when we played we fought for a lot of things. We fought for better treatment of the players, for improvement in payments and things like that. If we were to adopt the same attitude that the players were adopting today, we would have never gone out on the field of play because there was hardly any money, he added. (PTI)

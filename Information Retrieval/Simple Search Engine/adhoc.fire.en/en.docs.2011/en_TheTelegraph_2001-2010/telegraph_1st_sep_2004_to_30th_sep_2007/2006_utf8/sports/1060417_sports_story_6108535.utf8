The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Now, opportunities have opened

 - Its a major achievement and Ive got to pick and choose the courses I think will favour me, says Jeev 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Calcutta: Having won his 

 first title in seven years, Jeev Milkha Singh has many 

 decisions to make. On Sunday night, the first revolved 

 around choosing an Indian restaurant (in Shanghai) to celebrate 

 the pocketing of a $ 300,000 cheque in Beijing earlier in 

 the day. 

Im just checking-in... Once Ive settled down, Im going to head for the finest Indian restaurant and, then, watch one of the DVDs Im travelling with, an over-the-moon Jeev told The Telegraph after the two-hour flight from the Chinese capital. 

Laughing, the 34-year-old added: It has been a long day, but I wont be forgetting it in a hurry... Hes in Shanghai for the BMW Open which begins Thursday. 

Jeevs last Tour title had been the Lexus Open in Thailand and, by winning the Volvo China Open (a co-sanctioned meet), has earned the right to play any tournament in Asia or Europe till December 2008. Its a major achievement and Ive got to pick and choose the courses I think will favour me, he said. 

But why did the iconic Milkha Singhs son have to wait for seven years? 

Jeev laughed again: Perhaps, I was trying too hard... Perhaps, I put too much pressure on myself... However, I come from the school which says dont give up and that philosophy helped in the tough times... I also believe whatever happens is for the good and, now, opportunities have opened. 

Expectedly, his first call was to his parents ? Milkha and Nirmal. 

Dad was on the way home (Chandigarh) from Delhi... He was delighted and reminded me that hard work does pay off... As for mom, she congratulated by saying its never too late...Right now, I dont see myself coming back in the next few months... Catching up with the family, then, has to wait, Jeev informed. 

The exemption for any meet in Europe or Asia for the next 30 months is terrific, but his goal is to qualify for the US Tour ? Thats the wish... Thats the aim... Thats why I need to get my planning right... Need to make the right decisions... 

Jeev is his own manager. 

Incidentally, he has hero-worshipped Fred Couples. Why? Because of his attitude... Because of the way he conducts himself on the course... Because, quite simply, hes a great golfer. 

While Jeev had a terrific Sunday, another Chandigarh da puttar, Yuvraj Singh, had a great Saturday. So, he won another (third in succession) Man-of-the-Series award? Well, thats fantastic... Obviously, Chandigarh ke paani mein kuch hai... Ive only met Yuvraj once, but youve given terrific news... 

He continued: Somehow, Ive never really followed other sport, but a big Indian win (5-1 in the ODIs against England) is reason to celebrate, too... Im happy for Yuvraj and happy for the Indian cricket team... 

According to Jeev, the facilities in Chandigarh are fantastic and that helps sportspersons. In fact, the facilities are easily accessible and that makes a difference... Seriously, then, its not just the water... 

As he prepared to run a check on Indian restaurants, one asked the final question: Arent his parents pushing him to tie the knot? Jeev laughed yet again ? Oh, absolutely... But I dont see myself getting off the road right now! 

 Not when handsome cheques come 

 his way.

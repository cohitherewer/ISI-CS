The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Im okay, says weary Sourav

 - If I was Sourav, I would fight back: Arun Lal 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Calcutta: Even if his own mind wasnt exactly 

 made up, the very public encouragement from West Bengal 

 chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and the iconic Sunil 

 Gavaskar seems to have convinced Sourav Ganguly he must 

 stay on in the ring. 

For starters, therefore, he has informed the Cricket Association of Bengal of his availability for the last two Deodhar Trophy matches (in Jaipur on March 6 and 9) and the knockout stage of the National one-day meet. 

Having been on edge for almost five months, Sourav would have opted out of both had his spirit been broken by the selectors decision to again keep him out of a Test squad. 

 Somewhat wearily, Indias 

 most successful Test captain told The Telegraph: 

 Its not nice to get dropped? One cant 

 feel good? Im okay? 

Unless Team India fares miserably against England ? nobody is going to bet on that ? the earliest that Sourav can hope for a better deal is end-September, when chief selector Kiran Mores term ends. 

But, then, coach Greg Chappell will still be there and Sourav is going to be in his 35th year. At a time when 17-year-olds are being picked, that would be a major disqualification. 

Apparently, Sourav believes plenty of hard cricket remains to be played (in the near future itself) and its all about staying firm in the mind. 

The risk, though, is greater humiliation. Will it be worth it? 

Former India opener Arun Lal, by the way, is convinced Sourav has some cricket left. 

He said: The selectors decision left me shell-shocked? If I was Sourav, I would fight back? I would do so instinctively? Of course, at the same time, one has to look at reality as well? 

 For Sourav, clearly already lonely (despite Buddhadebbabus 

 exhortation), that isnt encouraging.

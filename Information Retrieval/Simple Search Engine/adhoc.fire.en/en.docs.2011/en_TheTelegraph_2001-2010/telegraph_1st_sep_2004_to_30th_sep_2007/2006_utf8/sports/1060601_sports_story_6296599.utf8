 Sania, 

Husarova move up

Paris: Sania Mirza made light of her first round exit in the singles to advance to the second round of the womens doubles at the French Open on Wednesday. 

The 19-year old Indian, who has leaped to 37 in world doubles rankings, combined with Slovakias Janette Husarova for a facile 6-1, 6-3 against Spaniard Conchita Martinez and Castalina Castano of Columbia. 

The Hyderabadi lass lost to former champion Anastasia Myskina in the singles first round on Tuesday. 

Sania returned to the courts after a three-week break last week in Istanbul where she reached the doubles final with Australian Alicia Molik. 

Meanwhile, Leander Paes and Martin Damm have been seeded seventh in the mens doubles. (PTI)

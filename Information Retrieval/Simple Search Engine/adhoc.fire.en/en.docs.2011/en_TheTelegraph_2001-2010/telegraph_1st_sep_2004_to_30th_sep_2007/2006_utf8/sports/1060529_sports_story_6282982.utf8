 Quick Takes

 Robert Pires puts France behind him

 Robert Pires 

 Paris: Robert Pires says 

 he has put France football behind him after being omitted 

 by coach Raymond Domenech for the World Cup finals. The 

 32-year-old Pires, who left Arsenal to join Villarreal on 

 a two-year deal last week, said he was not surprised to 

 miss his second consecutive World Cup.

 In 2002, the midfielder was ruled 

 out of the competition through injury.

 I was expecting (not be 

 picked). I had no news from the coach, Pires told 

 a daily on Sunday. Today, Les Bleus are behind me 

 though Ill watch the World Cup games, he added.

 Pires won 79 caps for France, 

 scoring 14 goals. 

 Kewell back

 Sydney: Injured Australia 

 striker Harry Kewell has joined up with his teammates at 

 their training camp in the Netherlands, confident he will 

 be fit for the start of next months World Cup finals 

 in Germany.

 Kewell missed Australias 

 1-0 win over European champions Greece in Melbourne on Thursday 

 to remain in England for treatment on his injured groin.

 The injury is not ideal 

 but I am expecting to be back and ready in time for the 

 tournament, Kewell said.

 Students say no

 Dhaka: Hundreds of students 

 at a Bangladesh university besieged the office of their 

 vice-chancellor demanding exams be postponed during the 

 World Cup.

 The Bangladesh University of Engineering 

 and Technology had announced exams would run from June 3 

 to 29, ignoring a call from the students to defer the tests 

 for a month.

 Alee Murtaza, the vice-chancellor 

 of the university said: We understand the students 

 sentiments but we cannot put everything on hold for a month 

 just for the World Cup.

 Dutch rebels

 Amsterdam: A group of Dutch 

 women, fed up with their partners obsession with soccer, 

 have joined forces to revolt against the World Cup. We, 

 the Women for Football-free Netherlands, have rebelled against 

 the World Cup... Get rid of the World Cup once and forever, 

 their website (www.wegmethetwk.nl) says.

 The initiators of the website 

 say they want to encourage women to change their mens 

 mentality that life is not just football.

 Iran draw

 Florence: Italy defender 

 Gianluca Zambrotta injured his left thigh Sunday in a World 

 Cup training match against a local amateur team. I 

 hope its nothing serious, I stretched a little too 

 far and I felt the muscle pull, he said.

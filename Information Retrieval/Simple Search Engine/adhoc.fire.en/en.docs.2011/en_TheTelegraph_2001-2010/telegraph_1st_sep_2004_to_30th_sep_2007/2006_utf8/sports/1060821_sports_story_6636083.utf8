 England eves take 2-0 lead

London: Skipper Mithali Rajs second consecutive half-century went in vain as India suffered a five-wicket loss in the third ODI on Saturday to give England eves a 2-0 lead in the five-game series. 

The second game was washed out. 

Mithali scored 73 as India managed a modest 186 for six after being put in at the Arundel Castle Cricket Club. Isa Guha, a cricketer of Indian origin, took four for 29. 

England reached the target with four balls to spare, thanks to a 61-ball 47 by captain Charlotte Edwards. 

The fourth ODI will be played at Rose Bowl, Southampton, on Thursday.

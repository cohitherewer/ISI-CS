 Inzy pushed Pak to opt out

 Abu Dhabi Tri-series

 Karachi: It was on skipper 

 Inzamam-ul Haqs insistence that the PCB decided to 

 opt out of a proposed tri-series, also involving India, 

 in Abu Dhabi in September this year.

 Inzamam told top officials of 

 the PCB that players should be given proper breaks to save 

 them from fitness problems ahead of the World Cup.

 The (PCB) chairman had asked 

 Inzamam whether the players would be happy playing in the 

 unscheduled tri-series (not included in the Future Tours 

 Programme of the ICC) in September this year before the 

 ICC Champions Trophy in India, a PCB official said.

 Inzamam told the chairman 

 that it would be better if Pakistan didnt take part 

 in the tri-series as they were already playing a lot of 

 cricket before the World Cup.

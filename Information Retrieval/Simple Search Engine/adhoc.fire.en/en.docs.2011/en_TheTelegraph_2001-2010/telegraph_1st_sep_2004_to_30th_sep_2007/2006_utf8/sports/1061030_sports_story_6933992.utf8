 Jagmohan Dalmiya set to be banned from BCCI

 - Disciplinary committee takes dim view of absence 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Jagmohan Dalmiya 

Chandigarh: Former president Jagmohan Dalmiya, who is already under suspension, is set to be banished from the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI). 

The disciplinary committee, which met in neighbouring Mohali Sunday morning, has taken a dim view of his decision to ignore the latest summons. President Sharad Pawar is the committee chairman, with vice-presidents Shashank Manohar and Chirayu Amin being ordinary members. 

Dalmiya (who heads the Cricket Association of Bengal) will be banned... The only question is for how long... The committee has been unhappy with his attitude and it decided to take an ex-parte decision, a well-placed source told The Telegraph. 

According to an unsigned Media release from the BCCI, the committee felt that the endeavour of Mr Jagmohan Dalmiya is to prolong the proceedings and not cooperate... The committee decided to proceed ex-parte in the matter... 

Treasurer N. Srinivasan, one of those gunning for Dalmiya, was called as a witness and the committee took on record the documents produced by him. The Media release added (the committee) has closed the matter. The report of the committee would be submitted to the BCCI secretary. 

The committee, obviously, wasnt impressed by the clarifications sought by Dalmiya a few days ago. The Media release, in fact, makes no mention of the points he raised in response to the latest summons. There were two before this one. 

Dalmiya, who has been totally marginalised within the BCCI, is bound to respond through his lawyers. However, the ground lost by somebody who once headed the International Cricket Council, cant be regained in court rooms.

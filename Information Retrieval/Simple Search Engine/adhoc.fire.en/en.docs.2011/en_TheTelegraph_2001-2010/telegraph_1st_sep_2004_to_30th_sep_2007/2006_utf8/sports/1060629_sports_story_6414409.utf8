 Sri Lanka go 4-up as Mahela hits 100 again 

 - Fourth ODI vs England 

Manchester: Mahela Jayawardene scored a second successive ODI hundred at Old Trafford on Wednesday to help Sri Lanka post a formidable 318 for seven after opting to bat in the fourth match of the series against England. 

The Sri Lanka captain made 100 and put on a lightning 137 for the second wicket with Upul Tharanga (60). The pair lashed out at the England pace attack, scoring at eight an over. 

 Sri Lanka went four-up beating England by 33 runs. 

 The hosts were 285 all out in 48.4 overs. 

Jayawardene, averaging 108 in the series before Wednesdays game, reached three figures off just 82 balls. His side has already clinched the five-match series. 

England seemed to have given themselves a chance after taking five middle-order wickets for 60 runs, pegging their opponents back to 220 for six, but Sri Lanka provided a spectacular finish as 50 came off the final four overs. 

Fervez Mahroof hammered 58 off 50 balls while Malinga Bandara made 28 off 22. Kabir Ali, losing his length completely, was hit for 35 off his last two overs which included three sixes and three fours. He finished with none for 77 off 10 overs. 

Sri Lanka, having won the toss, continued with their successful tactic of putting Englands young bowlers under immediate, intense pressure. 

Alis first two balls of the game flashed to the off-side boundary, off Sanath Jayasuriyas bat. When Liam Plunkett replaced him his first over went for 14. On came Tim Bresnan, another medium-fast seamer, and his first ball fizzed to the rope, with 21 runs coming off his first two overs. 

Englands fielders were not helping their bowlers. Jamie Dalrymple caught Jayasuriya on the boundary off a trademark slashed drive for 14 to make it 23 for one in the fifth over but that was a lone success. 

Jayawardene was offered a clutch of early lives, dropped on seven and 27 and missed again one run later when a direct throw would have run him out. 

The Sri Lanka skipper, however, was a joy to watch as he opened up, driving on the up and whipping to leg as he hurtled to his half-century in 32 balls. Tharanga, favouring the offside and his frontfoot, soon joined him on the mark, off 60 deliveries. 

Dalrymple was the only bowler to exert any control with his off-spin and he ended the partnership to make it 160 for two just before the midway point, Tharangas drive caught above his head by Vikram Solanki at short extra. 

That sparked a collapse. Kumar Sangakkara (7) shaped to dab a Harmison lifter to thirdman but edged behind while Tillakaratne Dilshan (7) returned from a short rain interruption to miss a straight one from Plunkett. Russel Arnold (7) edged Ian Bell behind, and Jayawardene, looking to chip Dalrymple to leg, only succeeded in looping the ball straight back to the bowler.

Calcutta: Sandipan Chanda feels India have a very good chance of winning a medal in the Chess Olympiad to be held in Turin from May 20. 

Last time in Mallorca we finished sixth, but this year we are hopeful of bagging a medal, said Sandipan on Wednesday. 

The Alekhine Chess Club and Goodricke National Chess Academy felicitated Surya Sekhar Ganguly and Sandipan, Grandmasters both, for their commendable performance in the recent National A Chess Championship, on Wednesday. Surya completed a hattrick of titles, while Sandipan finished runner-up for the third time on the trot. 

The Indian team ? comprising Viswanathan Anand, P. Harikrishna, Krishnan Sasikiran, Sandipan, Surya and Diwakar Prasad Singh ? will undergo a 15-day preparatory camp in Goa from April 28 to May 12 before leaving for Italy. 

The camp is very important for us. My emphasis will be on openings. The presence of trainer GM Elizbar Ubilava will help us sharpen our skills, Sandipan pointed out. 

Surya is just as focussed on the Olympiad. I am not thinking of any other tournament now. It is just the Olympiad. We have to bag a medal this time, Surya signed off.

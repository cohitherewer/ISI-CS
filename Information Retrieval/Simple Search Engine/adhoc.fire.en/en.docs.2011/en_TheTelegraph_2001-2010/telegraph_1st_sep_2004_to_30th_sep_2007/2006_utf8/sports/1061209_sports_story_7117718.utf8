Doha: Soma Biswas kept her word, at least for the day. 

When Kazakhstan girl Olga Rypakovas stupendous effort of 1.92 metres in high jump pushed the Bengal athlete to fifth place after the first two events in heptathlon, Soma sounded unperturbed. 

Olga did some great jumps, Soma said, standing in the mixed zone at the Khalifa Stadium. I could do only 1.62 metres, but I am not disappointed. I should be able to retain at least the third position by the evening. 

On a rain-affected evening, when everyone was patiently waiting around the Khalifa Tennis and Squash Complex to watch Sania Mirza in action, the Busan Asian Games silver-medallist proved she was not boasting. Soma improved in both shot put and 200 metres to move up to third at the end of the first days action. Kazakhstan duo Olga (3589) and Irina Naumenko (3331) occupy the first two slots, while Soma has 3291 points. 

J.J. Sobha (3201) who was selected by the Athletics Federation of India ahead os another Bengal girl Sushmita Singha Roy is lying sixth among seven participants. 

High jump proved to be Somas biggest hurdle in the morning. Olga was at her awesome best and cleared 1.92 metres in her first attempt. She was aiming for more, but her coach, sitting in the stands, signalled her to quit. That is one event I am not very good at, said Soma later. 

Olga, however, had to bow to the two Indian girls in shot put. While Irina came first with a throw of 13.65 metres, Sobha (13.10) and Soma (12.66) were second and third, respectively. 

Olga regained lost ground to snatch the top spot in 200 metres, clocking 25.15. Soma was third with 25.15. 

With three more events long jump, javelin and 800 metres still to come on Saturday, Soma kept alive her hopes for a gold medal. I should be able to take as many points as possible in javelin and 800 metres, said the athlete from Ranaghat. 

In mens long jump, India s Shiv Shankar Yadav qualified for the final with an effort of 7.51 metres. Also qualifying for the final were Shanti Sunderrajan (2:08.62) and Sinimole Puaulose (2:10.16) in womens 800 metres. 

While the two shooting gold medals at the Lusail Shooting Range made all the news, the four-member Indian equestrianism squad earned a bronze in the team jumping event. The Indians consisting Bhagirath Singh, Deep Kumar Ahlawat, Palvinder Singh and Rajesh Pattu finished behind Qatar and Japan riders. 

In boxing, India were assured of a medal in 75 kg when Vijender Kumar moved into the semi-finals with a victory over Shukuralla Atajanov of Turkmenistan.

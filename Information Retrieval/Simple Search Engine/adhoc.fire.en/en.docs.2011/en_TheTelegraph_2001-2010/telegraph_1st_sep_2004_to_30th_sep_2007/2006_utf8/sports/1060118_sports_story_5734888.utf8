The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 IN THE CITY

 Local hope Rupesh Roy cantered to the second round of the ONGC-ITF Junior Championships, beating qualifier Comporto Antonio of Italy 6-0, 6-3 at the DKS Sports Complex on Tuesday.

 Top-seed Rupesh took just 23 minutes to clinch the first set. In the third game of the second set, he served three double faults but still managed to take the game. The only break came in game No. 8 when Comporto served two double faults and Rupesh capitalized on it. 

 The derby is a few days to go, but both East Bengal and Mohun Bagan have already kicked off their preparation. On Tuesday, stopper Marshall and midfielder Guy Endem ?Africans who have come from Bangladesh?s Abahani Krira Chakra ? practised with the East Bengal team under coach Phillipe De Ridder?s supervision. 

 The coach, however, wanted to ?observe them for a few more days? before giving the final verdict. However, according to a club official, the club is expecting their ITC to reach the city by Wednesday. ?If the coach gives the go-ahead (about the foreigners), we may field them in the big match,? the official said. 

 Meanwhile, Mohun Bagan players sweated out at the club ground under lights. Coach Jahar Das expressed concern over his strikers? inability to score. ?We lost to Mohammedan Sporting because we failed to capitalise on the chances. Hopefully, we will learn from the past and rectify the mistake,? Das said. 

 India international Bishnu Chhetri won the 45-48kg category of the Inter-District Boxing Championships, held in Shibpur on Saturday and Sunday. The 39-42kg category title went to another international, Srikant Routh.

 Arjun Atwal up to tied 47th

La Quinta (US): Arjun Atwal made a slight improvement in his quest for a full PGA card for 2007, by firing a three-under 69 to jump 16 places to be at tied 47th after the fourth round of the US PGA Tour final qualifying tournament at the Stadium Course at PGA West. 

Atwal carded four birdies and one bogey and was three-under 285 in the six-round tournament. 

The top-30 and ties get the full card for next season. After having finished 140th in the money list this year, Atwal has a conditional start which will allow him about 15 starts. 

Michael Boyd, who four years ago was caddying in the qualifying tournament, took a share of the lead in the event with a 6-under 66. 

Boyd shares the top spot with Rich Barcelo at 14-under 274. Barcelo shot a 69.

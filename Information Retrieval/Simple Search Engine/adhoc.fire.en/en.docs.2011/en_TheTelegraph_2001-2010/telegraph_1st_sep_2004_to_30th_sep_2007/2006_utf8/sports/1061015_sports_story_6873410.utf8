The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Yuvraj: Priority is to be consistent and improve as a Test cricketer

 - A TELEGRAPH EXCLUSIVE 

 - I had a good 2005-06 season, but need to get better 

 and take my game to the next level 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Jaipur: For India to fire like the most potent missile, in the Champions Trophy, one Yuvraj Singh will have to play a key role. The 24-year-old, who has just completed six years with Team India, spoke to The Telegraph in the lead-up to the biggest tournament after the World Cup. He was candid. 

The following are excerpts 

 Q A top gun 

 like you wasnt able to score in the two matches you 

 played in Kuala Lumpur. At the start of a fresh season, 

 it must have upset you? 

 A It left me disappointed... Its 

 not an excuse, but I fell to good balls... Id come 

 off viral fever and, looking back, shouldnt have played... 

 The fever, after all, had left me weak... Having said that, 

 you dont wish to miss international cricket... You 

 dont want to be found sitting in the dressing room... 

 (After a pause) Cricket is such that there are going 

 to be both good and bad knocks... 

 What have you worked on in the last two-three 

 weeks?

 The physical side, mainly. Besides, 

 Ive worked on my batting and did well in the practice 

 matches. Im in good shape for Sunday. 

 Your India debut (Nairobi, October 2000) was in the 

 ICC KnockOut, as the Champions Trophy was then known. Does 

 the tournament, therefore, hold special meaning? 

 It adds to the positive thoughts... 

 I got 84 in the first match I batted, against Australia... 

 We won and I still remember the thrill that generated. 

 Is playing at home an advantage or a disadvantage? 

 It works both ways... There can 

 be more pressure, plus the Media and the public will get 

 very critical if things dont work out... On the other 

 hand, the team is familiar with the conditions and, if the 

 going is good, then the fans are bound to get right behind 

 you. Its a mixed bag and pros have to be ready for 

 the challenge. 

 This time, the Champions Trophy proper is going to 

 feature the top eight teams. I suppose this makes it more 

 exciting and challenging... 

 Sure, you want to do well versus 

 the best... There wont be a single match where the 

 level of motivation may not be at its highest. 

 Do big tournaments and series weigh 

 you down? Is the pressure far too much?

 Ive got to give off my best 

 in every match... 

 You had a terrific 2005-06 (an average of 51.20 with 

 five hundreds in ODIs and 528 runs in Tests). Did the success 

 teach you anything? 

 A couple of things, yes: To not 

 get carried away and not get complacent... Also, to remain 

 level-headed I had a good season, but need to get better 

 and take my game to the next level... It helped that, because 

 of the circumstances, I got to bat up the order No.3 or 

 4. 

 Whats the next level? 

 My priority is to be consistent 

 and improve as a Test cricketer... I wish to do well in 

 the longer version as well. Having a few good matches and 

 a few bad ones isnt good enough. 

 Youve been nominated for the ICC ODI Player 

 of the Year award. Is that adding to the usual pressures? 

 Its definitely adding to 

 the excitement of being an international cricketer... Theres 

 no pressure because of that nomination. 

 Last seasons success must have had 

 a lot to do with the mind... 

 Regularly speaking to Greg (Chappell) 

 made a difference... His thoughts matched mine and that 

 helped... I changed my stance and gained from the drills 

 devised for the team. 

 Did the coach and you hit it off straightaway?

 It took some time... There was, 

 as is natural, a period of adjustment. 

 Have you been influenced by the hot-shot sports psychologist, 

 Dr Rudi Webster? 

 Different psychologists have different 

 means of showing you what you want to achieve... 

 Of putting you on that path... Sandy Gordon, for example, 

 worked differently... Rudi has, in the past, worked with 

 the West Indies team and, so, he knows how to deal with 

 cricketers. Ive learnt quite a bit by talking to him. 

 I accept, though, that its a personal thing and everybody 

 isnt bound to benefit. 

 Whats the difference hes making? 

 It wouldnt be proper to 

 go into specifics... I think the sessions with Rudi have 

 helped me get what I needed to from somebody (an outsider). 

 Of course, I havent had miracle sessions... One could 

 be doing certain things without actually realising them... 

 It probably requires somebody else to draw your attention... 

 Its important to be mentally stable... If theres 

 instability in one area, others will get affected. 

 Do you set goals? 

 Yes. 

 Some time ago, Id found you reading The 

 Monk Who Sold His Ferrari... Are you into books of a particular 

 kind in a big way? 

 (Laughs) No... Frankly, 

 I struggle to read books... The Da Vinci Code has 

 been in my bag for close to three months... However, I dont 

 have a problem going through an entire newspaper in the 

 morning. 

 Have you consciously moved away from the 

 playboy image which marked the early years of your career? 

 This image business makes a difference 

 for people in India, but it doesnt matter to me... 

 People should only look at Yuvraj Singh the cricketer, what 

 I do off the field is my concern. Yes, Im concerned 

 about my family and those Im close to... Thats 

 it. I really dont need to bother about anything except 

 giving 100 per cent on the field and looking after my game. 

 Champions Trophy, the trip to South Africa, 

 the World Cup... This 2006-07 season is your biggest yet... 

 Im not looking at this season 

 alone... I mean, theres the tour of England next summer 

 and, then, were going to be visiting Australia... 

 Theres lots of cricket, almost all of it away. 

 For the public, much of the attention is already on 

 the World Cup, which is five months away. Are the players 

 also getting transported to March 2007 instead 

 of focusing on the present? 

 Were mature enough to realise 

 doing well in the present is what will give confidence for 

 the future.

 The Champions Trophy opener is against England. That 

 must be giving more confidence as youd been the Man-of-the-Series 

 the last time we played them... 

 Im not seeing the tournament 

 from an individuals point of view Provided we play 

 to potential, we can beat any team. 

 Why cant we beat Australia? 

 (Grins) Weve got 

 to do that in the Champions Trophy... Not many teams get 

 to beat them. 

 Do we lack the Australians self-belief? 

 Self-belief is important, but 

 I cant speak for everybody in the dressing room... 

 I cant say how each one reacts in a tight situation. 

 The more the self-belief, the better a team. 

 With so many youngsters coming in, whats 

 the role of seniors in the dressing room? 

 Theyve got to open a line 

 of communication, make the newcomers feel comfortable... 

 I remember I was tongue-tied six years ago. Even (Mahendra 

 Singh) Dhoni was overawed when he made his debut 22 months 

 ago. 

 At different times in the last season, the Sunil Gavaskars 

 and Intikhab Alams spoke of you as being a future India 

 captain. Have you yourself thought of the captaincy? 

 Every cricketer who plays for 

 his country would like to one day be the captain... I dont 

 keep thinking about the captaincy... At the same time, it 

 shouldnt be that if I one day do get the job, then 

 I react by asking how do I go about it... Whatever 

 ones field of activity, one must be prepared for responsibility. 

 In any case, what is not destined to happen, isnt 

 going to take place. 

 How do you unwind?

 Doing so in India is hard... There 

 are too many demands on time... If possible, I unwind through 

 music... Michael Jackson is an all-time favourite, but Im 

 comfortable with the latest Hindi songs as well. 

 The last one: Given a chance to start 

 all over again, what would you do differently? 

 (Laughs again) Ive 

 done a bit of nonsense, Ive done good things... But, 

 then, it has been part of growing up and becoming mature... 

 Im happy with the present.

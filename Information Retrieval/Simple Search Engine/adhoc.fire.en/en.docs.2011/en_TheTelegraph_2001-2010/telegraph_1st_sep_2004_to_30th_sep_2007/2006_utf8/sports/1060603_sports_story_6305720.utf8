Sandhausen: Costa Rica were beaten 3-2 by a German regional team of third, fourth and fifth division amateurs. 

Costa Ricas central defenders Jervis Drummond and Michael Rodriguez failed to mark opponents, who scored easy goals in the fourth, 13th and 66th minutes. 

Kurt Bernard scored from a free-kick in the 11th minute and Alvaro Saborio converted a late penalty for their second goal. 

In Eindhoven, The Netherlands struck twice early in the second half to offset Jared Borgettis opening goal and beat Mexico 2-1 in a World Cup warm-up on Thursday. 

John Heitinga equalised eight minutes into the second half and Ryan Babel sealed the win four minutes later. 

In Oslo, Norway and South Korea drew 0-0 in a cautious friendly on Thursday but South Koreas Dutch coach Dick Advocaat said he was happy with the result from a reserve-laden side ahead of the World Cup finals.

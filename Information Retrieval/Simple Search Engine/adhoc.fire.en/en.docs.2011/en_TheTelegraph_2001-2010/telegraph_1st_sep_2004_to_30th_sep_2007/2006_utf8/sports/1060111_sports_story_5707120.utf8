 Indianapolis: American athletes will compete for more than $1.5 million in prize and promotional money during a four-meeting indoor series that will conclude with next month?s US Championships in Boston.

 USA Track amp; Field (USATF) announced on Monday that the series will begin on January 28 with the Boston Indoor Games and will include the February 3 Millrose Games at New York?s Madison Square Garden and February 10 Fayetteville Invitational in Arkansas. The US Championships in Boston on February 24-26 will conclude the series with the first two finishers in the meeting qualifying for the IAAF World Indoor Championships on March 10-12 in Moscow. A $50,000 jackpot and prize package will be awarded the top male and female finisher in the series, USATF said in a media release.

 Salvo (North Carolina): Twice Olympic medallist Bernard Lagat has asked his native Kenya for a waiver so he can defend his world indoor 3,000m title as a US competitor, the athlete said on Monday.

 Lagat became a naturalised US citizen in May 2004, but under IAAF rules he is ineligible to race for the US in international competition for three years after citizenship unless he receives a waiver from the Kenyan federation. A waiver would reduce the wait to one year, making Lagat eligible to represent his adopted country at the World Indoor Championships in Moscow in March.

 Wellington: New Zealand captain Tana Umaga announced his retirement from international rugby on Tuesday, saying that wanted to spend more time with his family.

 ?It?s been a tough decision but I think the time is right for me, for my family, and for the team,? the centre said in a statement, adding that he would continue to play at club and provincial level.

 The 32-year-old Umaga played 74 Tests for New Zealand between 1997 and 2005, including 21 as skipper. In his final season in charge, the dreadlocked Umaga led the All Blacks to a series win over the British and Irish Lions, victory in the Tri-Nations Championship and a ?Grand Slam? of wins against Wales, Ireland, England and Scotland.

 Berlin: Franz Beckenbauer criticised a respected German consumer products group for saying there were serious deficiencies at World Cup stadiums and said in an interview published on Tuesday they should stick to face creams.

 ?I?m really sick and tired of the army of know-it-alls trying to lift their profile at the expense of the World Cup,? the organising committee president said after sponsor Stiftung Warentest reported there could be problems if fire or panic broke out.

 ?Stiftung Warentest knows what it?s doing when comes to facial cremes, olive oil and vacuum cleaners,? Beckenbauer said referring to the agency that warns consumers about product safety. ?But they should stick to that,? Beckenbauer added.

 Madrid: Osasuna striker Savo Milosevic will be sidelined for a month with a torn thigh muscle in his left leg, the Primera Liga club said on Monday.

 The Serbia amp; Montenegro international is the club?s joint leading scorer with four goals along with Cameroon striker Pierre Webo, who is also absent after joining up with his country for the African Nations Cup in Egypt.

 Osasuna are second in the Primera Liga, four points behind runaway league leaders Barcelona.

Samui (Thailand): S.S.P. Chowrasia proved that he could mix it with the cream of Asia when he finished inside the top-10 in the Bangkok Airways Open at the Santiburi Samui Country Club on Sunday. 

A two-under 69, one of only seven under-par rounds of the day, gave the Calcuttan a four-day aggregate of three-over 287, and a share of the eighth spot with Thais Thaworn Wiratchant and Thongchai Jaidee. 

Another Thai, Chawalit Plaphol claimed the honours following a playoff with Canadas Rick Gibson. 

Digvijay Singh finished tied 12th after a one-under 70 on the final day. Amandeep Johl carded an even-par 71 to take tied 19th spot, while Gaurav Ghei (75) and Amritinder Singh (76) finished tied 34th and tied 38th, respectively. (PTI)

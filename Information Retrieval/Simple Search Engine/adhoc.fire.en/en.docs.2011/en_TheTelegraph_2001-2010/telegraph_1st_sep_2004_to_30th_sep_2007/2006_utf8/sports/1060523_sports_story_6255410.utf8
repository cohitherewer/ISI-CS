 Totti drinking in the last chance saloon

Rome: Sent off for diving as Italy crashed out of the 2002 World Cup; kicked out of Euro 2004 for spitting at an opponent. 

To say that Francesco Totti has not really flourished for the Azzurri in recent major championships is putting it mildly. 

From appearing to have the world at his feet after a dazzling Euro 2000, Tottis fans could be forgiven for wondering where it all went wrong. 

Even though he enjoys superstar status in Italy, there is still a sense of unfulfilled potential about the 29-year-old Roma captains international career, which has seen him net just eight goals in 49 appearances. 

So this summers World Cup represents something of a last chance as he seeks to earn a place in the pantheon of footballs greats. 

I really want to make an impact in Germany because it could be my last tournament for Italy, Totti said. 

The last World Cup and the European Championships two years ago didnt go as I had planned, and I want to make up for it. 

Italy coach Marcello Lippi also believes Totti is indispensable to the Azzurri. (AFP)

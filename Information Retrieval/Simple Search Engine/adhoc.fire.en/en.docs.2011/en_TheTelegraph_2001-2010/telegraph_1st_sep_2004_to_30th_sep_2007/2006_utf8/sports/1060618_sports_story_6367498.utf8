The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Im frustrated, but proud

 - Playing well is a bonus... The result is more important: Drogba 

Stuttgart: Ivory Coast captain Didier Drogba expressed his teams frustration at being knocked out of the World Cup after a 2-1 defeat by Netherlands on Friday. 

As in their opening loss to Argentina by the same score, the Ivorians played well but went two goals down before pulling one back in a vain attempt to get themselves into a Group C game. 

Its a huge disappointment, because we wanted to put on a really big performance and beat the Dutch, Drogba told reporters at the Gottlieb-Daimler-Stadion. 

We saw that they had a few weaknesses but in the end they won it ? just like Argentina did last week. 

Everyone says we play well, but its not the most important thing ? playing well is a bonus. The result is always going to be the most important, as weve learned. We are very frustrated because we had chances to come back. 

Considering it was his strife-torn nations first appearances at the finals, the Chelsea striker added: I just look at my team and I can say Im proud of them ? because we did something fantastic for our country. 

The teams French coach Henri Michel also found their exit hard to digest. We came here with ambition but unfortunately the two matches ended up being similar ? we conceded two goals in the opening stages and then we are chasing the game, he said. 

Robin van Persie and Ruud van Nistelrooy put Netherlands 2-0 ahead after 26 minutes before Bakary Kone pulled a goal back for the Ivory Coast just before halftime. 

It annoys me to hear people always saying we play with real quality. In international football, quality isnt the only thing that counts, theres effectiveness as well, said Michel. We forgot that. And its a source of great frustration. 

Midfielder Romaric tried to look on the bright side, saying: I think weve shown a lot of good things, even though we havent had the results. 

Were a young team, weve got a future ahead of us and we are learning. We want to eliminate the mistakes weve made, because in games like this its the details that make the difference. 

Fellow midfielder Kanga Akale, who came off the bench, said: The second goal coming so soon after the first pulled the rug from under us. Were all disappointed...But weve learned a lot and I hope were going to be back in 2010.

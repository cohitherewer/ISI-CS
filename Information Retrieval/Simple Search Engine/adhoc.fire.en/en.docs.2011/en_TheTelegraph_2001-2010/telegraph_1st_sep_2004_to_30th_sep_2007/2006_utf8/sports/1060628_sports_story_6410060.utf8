 Lampard vows to regain touch

Baden-Baden: Frank Lampards goal-scoring touch has deserted him at the World Cup, but he has vowed to rediscover it in the quarter finals against Portugal. 

The Chelsea attacking midfielder scored 23 times for club and country last season but has squandered countless chances in Englands first four games, missing the sort of opportunities he normally buries. 

The barren run continued against Ecuador on Sunday, but he is convinced he will come good. 

The goals are just not going in for me, chances which I would normally eat up, said Lampard. Unfortunately, its the World Cup and Ive now gone four games without a goal although theyre going in during training. 

Thats not unusual for a midfield player but with the standards I have set, I expect to score.

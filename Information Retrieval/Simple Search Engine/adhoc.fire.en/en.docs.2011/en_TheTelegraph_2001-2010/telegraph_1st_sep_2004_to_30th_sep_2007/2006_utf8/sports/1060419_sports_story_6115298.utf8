 Schumi turns off retirement indicators

 - Its very likely I will stay with Ferrari? I have to have a very good reason to move 

 KEVIN EASON

 Schumacher believes in destiny 

The scream is almost overwhelming. Each time a Formula One car blasts down the long straight of Barcelonas Circuit de Catalunya to reach almost 200mph, their engines seem as though they are about to explode. Michael Schumachers did, which is why he is sitting in the cool of his air-conditioned motorhome. 

The seven-time world champion ? winner of a record 84 Grands Prix and, arguably, the most dominant force in the history of Formula One ? is sitting idly on a grey leather sofa while his rivals put in crucial testing time for the next race, the San Marino Grand Prix, at Imola, this weekend. 

They are already up to a speed that could mean that they maintain their whiphand over a winner who has had to get used to losing over the past year. 

They may know their cars are working well, but what they really want to know is whether Schumacher will still be sitting idly on his backside this time next year ? not on his sofa but at home in his opulent farmhouse in Switzerland. 

The question of whether Schumacher is to retire from Formula One is all-consuming: whether he stays or goes is not just a matter of losing a driver but of losing the man regarded as the face of Formula One. 

Which makes it all the more infuriating that Schumacher refuses to reveal whether he will sign a new contract with Ferrari, the team he has been with for a decade and propelled to unimagined glory, or whether he is seeking new pastures. 

The grass would not be greener in one possible case, but blue in the halcyon fields of Renault, who have become almost as dominant recently as Ferrari in their heyday. 

Fernando Alonso, who deposed Schumacher last year, is racing ahead in this championship and is starting to look unbeatable. 

Lounging back in his seat with his flame-red Ferrari overalls rolled down and tied around his waist in that insouciant style of Formula One drivers, Schumacher does not see it that way. He doesnt know what Blackpool rock is, but I suggest that he is much the same: cut him open and he will read Ferrari to his core. 

It is very likely that I will stay with the colour red, he says. 

There are obviously other options but at this stage, I wont consider them. Why should I? I am so happy here. We have such a good relationship and we have known each other for so long that I would have to have a very good reason to move to another team. It is more complex than just considering myself. There are a lot of other factors that are very important, such as whether the team is competitive and what other things are going on and I need to verify those. 

Schumacher, even at the age of 37, looks fitter than ever ? all lean, tanned muscle ? and has applied himself to his winter chores with more energy than at any time. 

Schumacher says: I have plenty of hobbies but I have nothing that would make me leave Formula One and nothing that gives me such passion and pleasure. 

So why quit? Could it be that the oldest man on the grid thinks his era is over and that this is the moment to yield to Alonso and the exciting crop of youngsters coming through behind him, such as Kimi R?ikk?nen, Jenson Button and Nico Rosberg? 

No, not that. He believes this championship is very much alive. 

So, is the problem at home? 

Is his wife, Corinna, worried ? particularly after the horrifying 180mph accident in 1999 at Silverstone in which he broke a leg ? that he could be hurt again, particularly as he is the doting father of two small children, Gina-Maria and Mick? I dont think I am risking anything, Schumacher replies, calmly.

Leeds: England celebrated their first series win at home over Pakistan since 1982 with one eye on the Ashes. 

They crushed Pakistan by 167 runs on Tuesday to clinch the third Test and the four match series 2-0 after a moment of madness from Mohammed Yousuf and one of magic from Monty Panesar. 

Pakistan, set 323 to win on the final day, but were bowled out for 155 halfway through the afternoon session. 

Yousuf, the hero of the first innings after he scored 192 out of a 363-run stand with Younis Khan, ran himself out in the morning for just eight to give England the upper hand. 

Panesar then produced a classic left-arm spinners delivery, pitching on middle and clipping the top of the off stump, to get rid of Younis shortly after lunch to expose Pakistans lower order. 

Younis, with 173 to his name in his first visit and a fine player of spin, trudged back to the pavilion after making 41, knowing that the game was lost. Panesar, who also had Inzamam-ul Haq stumped to end the match, took three for 39 while teammate Sajid Mahmood, who used to support Pakistan as a boy, got four for 22. 

Yousuf and Younis dismissals sealed a fascinating game, which had sparked into life on Monday after both sides had topped 500 in their first innings. 

England had begun Tuesday as slight favourites, according to England captain Andrew Strauss. They had the runs in the bank. Pakistan, meanwhile, had to bat last on a Headingley wicket, which had begun to offer signs of variable bounce the day before. 

Strauss attributed his teams successive victories over the world No.2 side Pakistan to consistent all-round excellence. 

Strauss, who has hit two centuries in his three Tests as Flintoffs replacement, said he was happy with his form. 

I was pretty happy with that 100 yesterday, especially as it set up an England win, he said. 

He also praised the contribution of Mahmood and left-arm spinner Panesar. 

A draw seemed unlikely the last draw at the venue came 10 years and eight Tests ago and it seemed unlikelier still when Salman Butt announced Pakistans positive intentions with four fours in two overs off Matthew Hoggard. 

Those, though, would be his only scoring shots before he attempted another drive, which ended up in Marcus Trescothicks hands at first slip. 

From 21 for one, they slumped to 80 for five as lunch approached. Panesar first got into the act by getting rid of Umar Taufeeq for 11 in the second over of his spell from the Football Stand End. Taufeeq swept and the ball went bat-pad straight to Alastair Cook at silly mid-off.England knew it was a critical breakthrough as they mobbed Collingwood but Mahmood, whose parents both come from Pakistan, made sure the pre-lunch session continued with two wickets in three balls. 

Faisal Iqbal (11) flicked at a leg-side delivery and wicketkeeper Chris Read, back in the England side after a two-year exile, tumbled low to his left to take a difficult chance. Kamran Akmals edge, for a two-ball duck, also flew to Read as Mahmood squared the batsman. 

Mahmood would have as dramatic an influence in the afternoon, with two wickets in his first over back after lunch, but only after Panesar had got rid of Younis. He lured the batsman forward with the perfect ball and left him looking back in surprise at the missing bails. That made it 112 for six and the game was up.

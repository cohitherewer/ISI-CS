 Australia a win away from 5-0 glory

 - England suffer innings defeat inside 3 days 

Melbourne: Australia thrashed England by an innings and 99 runs with more than two days remaining, wrapping up a fourth straight win in the Ashes series. 

Australia secured victory after tea on the third day when they bowled the tourists out for 161 to remain on course for a first 5-0 whitewash over their oldest rivals since 1920-21. 

Fast bowler Brett Lee captured four wickets while Stuart Clark grabbed three, Shane Warne two and Glenn McGrath one as Australia registered their biggest win over England on home soil since 1954 and their biggest in Melbourne since 1937. 

Warne, who will retire after next weeks fifth and final Test in Sydney, was named Man of the Match after taking seven wickets and scoring an unbeaten 40 in Australias only innings. Warne became the first player to capture 700 Test wickets when he took five for 39 in the first innings. He needs one more scalp to reach the magical figure of 1000 international wickets. 

England had trailed Australia by 260 runs on the first innings after bowling them out for 419 before lunch, but were unable to muster enough runs to make them bat a second time. (Reuters)

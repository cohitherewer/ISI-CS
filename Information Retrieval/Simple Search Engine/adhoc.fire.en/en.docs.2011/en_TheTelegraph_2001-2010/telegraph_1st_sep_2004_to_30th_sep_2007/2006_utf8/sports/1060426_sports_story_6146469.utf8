 Indian men win; women go down

 Poulami got the lone victory for womens team 

Bremen: The Indian mens team continued their fine run at the World Team Table Tennis Championships here when they thrashed Turkey 3-0 in their second tie. 

The women, however, went down 1-3 to the Czech Republic in the championship division. Poulomi Ghataks lone victory against Iveta Vacenovska went in vain. 

Achanta Sharath Kamal, Soumyadeep Roy and national champion Shubhajit Saha prevailed over their opponents to boost Indias chances of promotion to the championship division.

Poulami, ranked 225th, upset her 91st-ranked opponent 11-5, 14-12, 9-11, 8-11, 11-6 but then went shot for shot against Renata Strbikova in the fourth match. However, she failed to pull the team through and went down 11-8, 9-11, 7-11, 15-13, 4-11. National champion Mouma Das and Nandita Saha lost their respective matches. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Singh was in his elements 

 STAR RACER

 Trainer Harvinder Singh Bath was among the winners four to be precise thanks to forceful riding of the visiting Hyderabad-based jockey D. Singh who was in his elements last Friday. The trainer-jockey duo reeled off three in a hurry starting from the curtain raiser, the 2,000 Gold Kale Handicap, which Queen Amedale won from a heavily-fancied Falaknuma.

 In fact, Falaknumas jockey Rajinder looked to be in full control of the race from the top of the final straight until the Queen decided to change gear and snap it up with her customary late run in the final 75 metres.

 Singhs riding tactics were almost same on Baths other winners, excepting Satluj who made every post of the 1,200m Bright Law Handicap a winning one. However, Satluj had Thoughtful for company before kicking away from the field 300m from home. Arrayal failed to produce his last sparkling run, which had made the horse a course favourite. The Cristofori son was always last, though he tried to sneak through a rail-run in the straight but failed to accelerate.

 Baths Vancouver was expected to triumph after his two 

 promising runs in the past. A stronger jockeyship was what the Northern Comfort son needed and Singh provided the necessary assistance in the saddle.

 In the same race Salinger came in for a heavy support but failed to touch the frame. He may shape a lot fitter after this run as was seen eating up ground in the final furlong.

 Baths Tactical Advantage reproduced his morning track form, winning the 1,400m Hokaido Cup from Body And Soul, who was impressive in her defeat mainly because the Robin Corner-trainee is known to be a six-furlong specialist. 

 Daniel Davids ward Pure Valour was the other one who surprised over a seven-furlong trip in the feature event, the Roll N Twist Cup. it was the trainers Retained Asset who cornered a sizeable betting but failed to contain the stablemate who refused to look back after streaking into the lead from the start. The winner did offer some width to the favourite nearing the distance post but the Warrshan son failed to cash in on the advantage.

 Daniels Wizard Of Oz, on the other hand, was simply unstoppable in the 1,400m Amazing Handicap. Ridden in a check, the Diffident son left his rival gasping for breath once Chisty released brakes on the five-year-old.

 Javed Khans Sweet Success had to strive hard for victory in the 1,100m Mercury Handicap. The even-money favourite found the slender lead established by the nine-year-old Sergeant Slipper too hard to tackle until the 100m from the winning post. His victory must have come as a sigh of relief for many.

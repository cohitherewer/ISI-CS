 Naresh: Sania needed this reality check

Calcutta: Sania Mirza was blown away 1-6, 0-6 by world No. 9 Martina Hingis in the semi-finals of the Sunfeast Open on Saturday. 

Former Davis Cup captain Naresh Kumar, sitting at the VIP enclosure donning a navy blue shirt, was among those to witness the annihilation. So what did he think of the semi-final match and Sanias performance? 

Even when Hingis was completely dominating her, Sania, instead of trying to do something different, was constantly feeding her from the baseline. It was but inevitable that after long rallies Hingis would prevail, said Naresh, by way of analysis. 

Of course, it has to be said that Sania did not play too poorly. But then, one does not become a Grand Slam champion at 16 for nothing. Hingis groundstrokes, varying of pace, placement, everything was superior. 

It is sad, but Sania probably needed this reality 

check, Naresh signed off.

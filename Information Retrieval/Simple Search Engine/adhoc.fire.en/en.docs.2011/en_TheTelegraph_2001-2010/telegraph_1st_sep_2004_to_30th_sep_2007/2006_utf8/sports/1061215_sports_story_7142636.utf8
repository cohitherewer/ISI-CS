 India men finish fifth

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Doha: On Thursday, while India were battling out with Malaysia for the fifth place in the Asian Games hockey at the Al Rayyan Stadium here, the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) president Suresh Kalmadi was busy criticising the poor standard of Indian hockey elsewhere in the city. 

While the hockey team didnt falter this time, winning 4-0, the IOA chief said that he was concerned about the declining standard of the game in the country. The national game has to be a national responsibility and India not qualifying for the league stage is an eye opener. 

Kalmadi said the IOA has approached the International hockey federation (FIH) and Indian Olympic Committee (IOC) for help in arresting this decline. 

Against Malaysia, however, India were in good form. After Raghunath put India in the lead in the 13th minute off a penalty corner, Rajpal Singh, Raghunath and Gurbaj Singh scored the other goals in the second half. 

Indian coach, Vasudevan Baskaran, said he was happy with the performance of the boys against Malaysia. The boys made mistakes earlier and they have to learn from them. The commitment is there, but they have to be a little quicker on the field, he said. Baskaran also congratulated the womens hockey team for winning the bronze. 

Indian captain, Dilip Tirkey, again stressed that the defence had played well. Our plan was to control the game for the first 10 minutes and then go for the attack and score as many possible. We were successful, he said. 

On the last day of the canoeing event, Indians had a disappointing day. 

There was good news for the shooters when Kalmadi hinted that he would urge the government and the Sports Authority of India to sanction more ammunition for their practice. The Chinese shooters told me that they receive much more than what our shooters receive. The SAI, I think, should be little more considerate, he said. 

Meanwhile, India took their medals tally to 54 after wrestlers Sushil Kumar Singh and Palwinder Singh Cheema earned a couple of bronzes.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 No one should take place for granted: Chappell

 - No interference in selection: Pawar 

Bangalore: Indian coach Greg Chappell has sought to put his players on notice ahead of important tournaments leading to the World Cup, saying any complacency on their part will leave the door open for others. 

Chappell said anyone who could offer something to the team would be considered for selection and pointed out Dinesh Mongias return for the upcoming tri-series in Sri Lanka as an example. 

They (players) will select themselves in or select themselves out just on their performances. We need to be vigilant as a group and each of the players has to be vigilant as an individual and make sure they dont get complacent and leave the door open for someone else, the former Australian captain said. 

You look at anyone that can offer something to the team. The minute you close your eyes or shut the door on someone you can make a mistake, he said in an interview. 

Chappells comments could sound music to players like Zaheer Khan and Sourav Ganguly, seeking to make a comeback to the side after falling out of favour with selectors. 

[Our Special Correspondent adds from Mumbai: The Board of Control for Cricket in India president, Sharad Pawar, has reiterated again that the Board would not interfere in any manner with the selection process and it was up to the selectors to decide on Sourav Ganguly. ] 

Chappell added: We have to be careful. Weve learnt some lessons that will help Irfan Pathan and some of the other young cricketers. We have to make sure that we dont overwork them and they dont overwork themselves. 

Meanwhile, the cricket specific camp, which was slated to begin Sunday, has been postponed by a day. (PTI)

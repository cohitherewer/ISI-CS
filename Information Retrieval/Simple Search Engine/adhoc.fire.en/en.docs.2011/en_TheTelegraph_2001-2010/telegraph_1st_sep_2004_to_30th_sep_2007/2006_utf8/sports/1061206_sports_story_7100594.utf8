 Good start key to Test series 

 - We expect Sourav to do well, says new vice-captain Laxman 

Potchefstroom: New vice-captain V.V.S. Laxman on Tuesday said a good start would be the key to Indias improved performance in the Test series against South Africa beginning from December 15. 

Whenever we have had a good opening start, we have done well and that would absolutely be the key for the Tests, said Laxman after nets at Sedgars Park here. 

India have the potential to do well for we have a lot of match-winners. We can also take a leaf out of our overseas performance in recent years, particularly on the tour to Australia in 2003-04 and then against the West Indies this year. 

Laxman stressed that his focus was now entirely on the Test series and the possibility of leading India in a Test in case of Rahul Dravids absence, was farthest removed from his mind. I hope and pray that Rahul is fit for the first Test, he said. 

Laxman also did not forget to mention Sourav Ganguly. Sourav has been a tremendous batsman and we expect him to do well. We expect everyone to come good in the coming weeks, he said. (PTI)

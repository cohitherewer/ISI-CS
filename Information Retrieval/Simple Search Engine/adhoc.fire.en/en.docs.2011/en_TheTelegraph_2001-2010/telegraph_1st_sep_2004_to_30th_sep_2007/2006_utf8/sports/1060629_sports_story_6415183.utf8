 Player of the day

 Patrick Vieira 

A towering figure in the midfield, Patrick Vieira, according to Zinedine Zidane is certainly the best player in the world in his position. A player with pace, power and aggression in abundance, Vieira has been a star for France for many years and it was no different against Spain on Tuesday. 

After dishing out a below-par performance in the first two matches, Vieira regained his form only in the third match against Togo. Against Spain, Vieira was once again the hero for Raymond Domenechs side. 

He first produced a pass that led to Frances first half equaliser and then scored the decisive second goal in the 83rd minute to leave Spain frustrated. The former Arsenal man, who now plays for Juventus, lived up to his reputation on Tuesday and contributed in both attack and defence. 

Managing the midfield like a general, Vieira thwarted a very skilful Spanish midfield that knocked the ball around with their usual flair but only rarely managed to create clear chances. 

Born in Senegal, Vieira came to France with his parents at the age of eight and began his soccer career with the French club AS Cannes before he was transferred to AC Milan.

 Team India goes rock climbing

Bangalore: Team India on Wednesday left for Kallukottai village, some 65 km from here, to kick off the conditioning camp before the tri-series in Sri Lanka. 

Though the squad was originally supposed to spend three days there, as per a change in plan, Team India was scheduled to return to the Karnataka capital late on Wednesday night itself and leave for the camp on Thursday morning. 

At Kallukottai, near Doddaballapur, the players are based at a private farmhouse, belonging to a local businessman. 

The training is being conducted by Surjit Singh, a retired Indian Air Force official who also runs an adventure sports academy named Pegasus. Singh said the cricketers will undergo some exercises at the remote place to improve mental toughness.

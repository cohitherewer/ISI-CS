 Hayden laid low by dog attack

Brisbane: Australian Test opener Matthew Hayden has suffered a gashed ankle after being attacked by a dog ahead of the Ashes series against England, reports said on Sunday. 

Hayden, who broke a finger while playing in his first match of the season here this month, was set upon while jogging on Friday, the reports said. 

Tests have revealed there was no ankle tendon or ligament damage. 

Hayden said the wound, about five centimetres (two and a half inches) long, would remain open for several days to minimise the risk of infection before being stitched. 

It was a vicious attack, Hayden told a Brisbane newspaper. 

I was out for a leisurely run. You are always a bit shocked by that sort of thing but I was more disappointed than anything. It just hasnt been my week. 

Hayden was already out of cricket for a couple of weeks after breaking a finger taking a catch in last weekends Sheffield Shield match against Tasmania in Brisbane. (Agencies)

 Players free to contribute to Fica: BCCI

Mumbai: The BCCI Sunday said it had no objection to the players contributing five per cent of their earnings from ICC events to the Federation of International Cricketers Association (Fica). 

We distribute the prize money to the players. It is entirely up to them what they do with it, BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah said. 

Shah was speaking after Rahul Dravid wrote a letter to the BCCI saying the players wanted to give five per cent of their prize money to Fica. 

On womens cricket, Shah said BCCI will be hosting the Asia Cup next month. (PTI)

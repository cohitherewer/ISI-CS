 Kaiser slams referees

 Berlin: Franz Beckenbauer, 

 head of 2006 World Cup, said on Friday that the referees 

 are handing out too many yellow cards and accused an African 

 official of stupidity. 

Beckenbauer told a television channel that Benins Coffi Codjias yellow cards in the match between Ecuador and Costa Rica were stupid. Codjia handed out five bookings ? about average for the competition so far. Beckenbauer said bookings for time wasting were stupid. 

As a referee in that situation, I have to go over to the player and let him know that next time he will receive a yellow card, Beckenbauer said. If the players are booked again, they will miss a match ? and that is out of proportion. 

 Fifa has ordered referees at the World Cup to clamp 

 down on time wasting by immediately booking offenders. Players 

 were told about the harsher line in pre-tournament briefings.

 Zimbabwe players suspend strike till January 31

Durban: Zimbabwes cricketers suspended their indefinite strike on Saturday, the day after the government appointed an interim board to run the game. 

Players representative Clive Field said from Harare the decision had been made at a players meeting on Saturday. 

The players walked out on December 22 in protest at financial issues, transport problems and the continued presence in office of Zimbabwe Cricket (ZC) chairman Peter Chingoka and managing director Ozias Bvute. 

The government intervened on Friday by dissolving the ZC board and naming an interim body to be led by Chingoka. 

Brigadier Gibson Mashingaidze, the army brigadier who chairs of the sports and recreation commission that announced the take-over, said on Friday that a contractual impasse between the players and ZC should be resolved by January 31. 

The players have committed themselves to continuing to at least until the end of the month in the light of what was made clear at the meeting yesterday (Friday) ? they should expect their contracts to be resolved by then, Field said. 

Field said the players did not hold out much hope that their dissatisfaction over the new ZC contracts, which are based heavily on performance incentives, would be settled soon. 

The guys dont feel for a second that it will be resolved by then, but the feeling is that this is better way of keeping the pressure on than by just walking away, Field said. 

Theyve put their pockets in front of their principles in the hopes that they can persevere and preserve their income. 

Field said the players were mindful of trying to protect Zimbabwes Test status, which could be threatened if the ICC decides the county is not putting its best available team on the field. 

The players feel that Test status is paramount, if we dont have test cricket we have no jobs and we have no financial security for the players, Field said. 

They feel they should do everything in their power to keep Test status, and clearly if they all walk off the job, it wont be long before that is taken away. 

The general uncertainty of the players plight also played a role in Saturdays decision. 

No one in the room was under any illusion that this thing might be bigger than us now, Field said. The players feel they are risks, political and otherwise, to taking a hard line. 

The players decision clears the way for Zimbabwe to send a team to the under-19 World Cup in Sri Lanka in February.

 Bangalore Lions win

Chandigarh: Drag-flick specialist Len Aiyappa scored a hattrick as the Bangalore Lions beat Maratha Warriors 3-2 in the Premier Hockey League here on Wednesday. 

Aiyappa used his powerful flick to shoot into the lead in the 17th minute. Seven minutes before half-time, the Lions forced their third short corner and Aiyappa was bang on the target with low drag-flick. Early in the third quarter, Warriors pulled one back with a smart deflection via a Dhanraj Pillay goal. 

The Lions forced their fourth penalty corner in the 62nd minute. And Aiyappa made no mistake beating rival custodian Adrian DSouza once again with his poweful drag-flick to complete the hattrick. (pti)

 Nadal tames Federer

 - DUBAI OPEN FINAL 

 Rafael Nadal 

Dubai: Roger Federer suffered his first defeat of the year when he was beaten in three sets by Rafael Nadal in the Dubai Open final between the worlds top two players on Saturday. 

Nadal, playing only his fifth match of the year after recovering from a foot injury, won 2-6, 6-4, 6-4. 

The Spanish teenager, taking his career record against the Swiss to 3-1, prevented Federer from taking revenge for last years French Open semi-final defeat. 

World No. 1 Federer, who has won the Australian Open and Qatar titles this year, had also lost to Nadal in Miami in 2004, but he beat the 19-year-old in last years Miami final.

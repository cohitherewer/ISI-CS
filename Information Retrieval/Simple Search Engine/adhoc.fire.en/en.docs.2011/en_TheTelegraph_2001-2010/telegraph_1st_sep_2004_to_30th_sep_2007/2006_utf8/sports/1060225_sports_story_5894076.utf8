 Asian nations seek more time

New Delhi: India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh have sought some more time from ICC to fill in all the conditions before meeting in Mohali on March 12 to take further the bid process for the 2011 World Cup. 

We had a very good discussion chaired by Mr Pawar. We have agreed to bid jointly for World Cup 2011, PCB chairman Shaharyar Khansaid after emerging from the nearly two-hour meeting. 

However, there are some financial modalities to be sorted out with ICC. We have raised some financial issues but everything is on course. We are very serious and very hopeful of (winning the bid), he said. 

 After sorting out the issues amicably 

 among themselves, the four countries have decided to put 

 forward their formal bid by Saturday, three days before 

 the deadline set by the ICC expires.

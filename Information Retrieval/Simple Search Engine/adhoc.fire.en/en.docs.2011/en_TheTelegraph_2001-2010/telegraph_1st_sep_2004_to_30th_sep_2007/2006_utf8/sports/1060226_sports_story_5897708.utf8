 Wonder lifts Mayors Cup

Calcutta: Trainer Javed 

 Khans Exploding Wonder made most of his favourable 

 terms to claim the 1,200m Mayors Cup on 

 Saturday. Quoted at 3-1, in an open betting field, the seven-year-old 

 responded well to jockey Mark Reubens urgings when 

 sent into the lead 300m from home to hold a late finishing 

 Gaslight at the wire.

 Javeds Helegonia justified wagering in the Aada-Rossa Cup which the sparingly raced filly won with a measure of comfort.

 However, the trainers Aluminous had to contend with half-a-win after RCTC judges declared the three-year-old as a joint winner with Harvinder Singh Baths Valintine Dancer in the Ming Dynasty Plate. The final freeze-frame clearly separated Aluminous from the Valintine, albeit by a whisker.

 Trainer Viaksh Jaiswal was among the winners, too. He notched up a double through Majestic Hills and El Cid who had helped him score his maiden victory on Debut, last Saturday. Robin Corners Alannah scored an easy win in the Indian Air Force Cup.

After missing the cut at last weeks Loch Lomond Golf Club in Scotland, the 34-year-old has decided to come back to Japan and ply his trade. He is paired in the first round with Toru Suzuki and Yoshinobu Tsukada. 

The defending champion is former Asian Tour No.1 Lin Keng Chi of Taiwan. Jeev is currently 24th on money list in Japan with four top-10 finishes in six starts.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Ace in the Orange pack

 My pick 

 of the week / PK Banerjee

 Player No 1 : Arjen Robben

This is the worlds biggest 

 stage, the standout talents of the top 32 teams are all 

 assembled in Germany parading their skills. A week into 

 the tournament, and we have already seen it all: The artistry 

 of Latin Americans, the technical soundness of the Europeans, 

 the challengers from Africa, the best of Central America 

 and Asia.

 Picking the player of the week from over 400 who tried to 

 make an impact is a tough call, to say the least. The most 

 important criterion in making such a selection should be 

 to consider those who made the biggest difference in the 

 fortunes of their respective sides.

 Casting a glance at the action of week I, there were a clutch 

 of players who stood out with their performance. Players 

 like Arjen Robben, Kaka and Riquelme among many others. 

 But I have to narrow it down even further, and my vote for 

 the best will go to Robben.

 It wasnt an easy choice, I dare say. So let me explain 

 why I chose the Dutchman ahead of the Brazilian and Argentine. 

 Robben, basically a left-winger in the three-pronged forwardline, 

 has performed the double role of key gamemaker and dependable 

 scorer. His goal won The Netherlands their match against 

 Serbia and Montenegro, then in the clash against Ivory Coast 

 he set up Ruud van Nistelrooys second goal besides 

 being instrumental in most of their attacking forays.

 Both were very tough games and had it not been for Robbens 

 creative and attacking flair, they may not have won two 

 out of two and booked a berth in the last 16. No wonder 

 he was adjudged Man of the Match in both games. A Kaka or 

 a Riquelme have a set of skilful personnel around them to 

 lend a helping hand, but Robben has to do the creative work 

 mostly on his own.

 Its a combination of his explosive speed, dribbling 

 skill and a sharp eye for goals which sets Robben apart 

 from his teammates and makes him a very special talent. 

 Times without number, he produced a sudden burst to get 

 past two defenders and create panic in the rival citadel. 

 He showed why he is called the Flying Dutchman.

 Coach Marco van Basten has realised Robben is the ace in 

 his pack and that if the Orange brigade has to progress 

 to the quarter finals or beyond, the Chelsea star has to 

 keep on performing.

 So, keeping fit should be Robbens priority. Hes 

 only 22 but has already had his share of injuries. He had 

 a hamstring problem and broke metatarsal bones to be out 

 of the game for long periods. In fact, he played very little 

 part in the first of Chelseas back-to-back Premiership 

 winning efforts in 2004-05. The last season was better and 

 he was much more visible.

 Hopefully, Robben has seen the last of serious injuries. 

 The game needs young talents like him to bloom in their 

 full glory.

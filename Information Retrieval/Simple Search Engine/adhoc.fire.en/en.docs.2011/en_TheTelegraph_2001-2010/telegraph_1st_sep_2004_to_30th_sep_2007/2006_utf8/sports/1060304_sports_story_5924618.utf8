 England will regret letting Eriksson go

 - All the criticism he has had is unfair: Lagerback 

 Christopher Davies

Lars Lagerback, the Sweden coach who will go head-to-head with fellow countryman Sven-Goran Eriksson in the World Cup finals, believes England will regret allowing the man who has occupied almost as much space on the front pages as the back during his five-year tenure to leave. 

All the criticism he has had is unfair, said Lagerback after Swedens 3-0 defeat by the Republic of Ireland. If you look over the period of time he has been the manager, I doubt another England manager has had the same run of results. 

I think he has only lost one qualification game. You won the World Cup in 1966 and got to the semi-finals in 1990, but that apart, I dont know who has had a better record than Sven. He has done a marvellous job with England and I do not understand the criticism he gets. 

Maybe it will be two years before you look back and think you made a mistake letting him go. Just because he is not a typical English manager on the touchline punching the air, you may think he isnt doing anything, but that is wrong. Thats his character. 

Lagerback hopes that their dismal display in Dublin, when Steve Staunton got off to a winning start as the Republic of Ireland manager, was a one-off, as Sweden began their World Cup preparations. 

We had a bad day at work, he said. I dont think weve had such a day since 1998 against Spain. We didnt play as a team and Ireland were more aggressive. However, it is 38 years since England defeated Sweden and they meet in the final group tie. 

Lagerback added: I think England have a chance to win it like 10 other teams. Its an interesting team because you have some players who have been there a long time but are still at the top of their game, and other young players. 

Almost inevitably it was Wayne Rooney who Lagerback singled out not only as the main threat to Sweden, but as a player who could make a significant impact on the finals. 

He said: With Rooney, you have a player who can give England that unpredictability. He is the allround forward. When you see him play for Manchester United, he drops back and plays behind the striker. Hes difficult to pick up. He is physically strong and with a good touch and, for someone so young, he is a very intelligent player. 

He is also full of energy. One moment he will be up front attacking, the next he will be back defending.

 Easy wins for Negi, Gupta 

 Dubai chess

 Dubai: Promising youngsters 

 Parimarjan Negi and International Master Abhijeet Gupta 

 came back into reckoning for their respective norms with 

 thumping victories in the seventh round of the Dubai International 

 Open Chess Championship here on Sunday.

 Double Grandmaster norm holder 

 Negi and Gupta displayed fine maturity in conquering compatriot 

 WIM Kruttika Nadig and Fide master Erik Teichmann of England, 

 respectively at the Dubai Chess and Cultural Club to take 

 their tally to a respectable five points out of a possible 

 7.

 Negis comeback has been 

 remarkable in the event as the 13-year-old had lost the 

 first round itself.

 Meanwhile, there was an expected 

 bloodshed at the top of the tables. Overnight leader Kazakhstans 

 GM Darmen Sadvakasov came in the firing line for the first 

 time in the event bowing out to GM Gabriel Sargissian of 

 Armenia.

 As things stand now, Sargissian, 

 Petrosian and Fedorchuk lead with six points. They are followed 

 by top seed Zviad Izoria of Georgia and Sadvakasov, who 

 both have 5.5 points.

 Five Indians ? GM R. B. Ramesh, 

 IMs S. Satyapragyan, Vishal Sareen, Negi and Gupta are among 

 the pack of 17 players on five points apiece. (PTI)

 Srivastavs unbeaten 213 puts India colts in control

Peshawar: Tanmay Srivastav produced a brilliant unbeaten knock of 213 to put the Indian under-19 boys in control against Pakistan colts on the first day of the second Test at the Arbab Niaz Stadium on Wednesday. 

The left-handed Srivastav laid the foundation for an imposing Indian total of 393 for four in 90 overs after the visitors won the toss and elected to bat. 

Srivastav slammed 28 fours in the 260 balls that he had faced so far. He was lent admirable support by the in-form Virat Kohli who stroked his way to 83 punctuated with 14 boundaries. 

Sumit Sharma also hit a handsome 81 with 10 fours and two huge sixes. 

For the home side, pacer Mohammed Naved was the most impressive, picking three for 87 in 21 overs even as the batsmen dominated the day in no uncertain terms. 

The Indians had won the first Test in Rawalpindi by a convincing margin of 271 runs last week.

 India go down 1-2 to Pak

Chandigarh: A new look Indian team failed to arrest their sliding fortunes as they went down 1-2 to their archrivals Pakistan in the first Test of the six-match series on Friday. 

The hosts, playing without the services of a number of established players, never really found any rhythm against the experienced Pakistanis who stuck a goal in each session in a fast-paced encounter. 

Tariq Aziz drew first blood for the visitors in the 15 th minute while veteran Shakeel Abbasi drove a penalty corner rebound home in the 57th minute to completely push the home team on the backfoot. 

The Indians narrowed the margin through the hardworking Tushar Khandekar six minutes before the hooter and had themselves to blame for not being able to find the equaliser as they frittered away the two chances that came their way in the dying minutes of the contest. 

I am hapy with the teams performance today, India coach Rajinder Singh (Jr) told reporters. (PTI)

 The iconic Zidanes last hurrah

 - Every game could be my last... Im not eternal, says Portugal captain Figo

Munich: Luis Figo and Zinedine Zidane, having seen off friends, rivals and fellow national team captains from their Real Madrid days, lead Portugal and France onto the pitch on Wednesday looking for a last shot at glory. 

However, there were question marks over Figos participation in Wednesdays semi-finals after news that the Portugal captain is struggling to regain fitness. 

Figo and Cristiano have been training well. They know they have problems and we need to check how they are to see if they can play, coach Luiz Felipe Scolari said on Tuesday. 

Frances Zinedine Zidane and Portugals Luis Figo want their teams to set them up for a big career finish by winning their semi-final encounter in Munich. For Zidane, the tournament marks an end to his soccer career altogether. The winners go to Berlin for Sundays final. The losers go to Stuttgart to play for third place. 

Figo, the winger who has drifted inside to become Portugals most creative influence in their best World Cup for 40 years, bade fellow No. 7 and captain David Beckham adios after beating England in a shootout in Saturdays quarter final. 

Beckham has since stood down as England captain. 

Zidane, the inspirational and majestic France skipper, has said goodbye to fellow captain Raul, Ronaldo and Roberto Carlos as his revitalised team swept aside Spain and Brazil. Yet, little more than a year ago, Figo and Zidane were themselves in retirement from their national teams, fatigued, bruised and demoralised by the pressures and criticism that followed Euro 2004. 

Their comebacks, like those of all great performers, have proved the old adage that form may be temporary, but class is permanent. 

Zidane, who was 34 on June 23, the evening when without him due to suspension a struggling France beat Togo 2-0 and secured a place in the second round, is retiring after this tournament. 

Figo, 34 in November, has left his future open but after playing with age-defying verve and energy may carry on in club football with Inter Milan for at least another season. 

Some star players ? Brazils Ronaldinho, Argentinas Lionel Messi, and Englands Wayne Rooney, to name a few ? have already gone home, but the pair who came out of retirement for the World Cup are leading their countries charge toward the trophy. 

Once, like Figo, the most expensive player in the world when recruited by Madrid and a former Fifa World Player of the Year, Zidane now cares little for celebrity status or media attention.Zidane is driven still by the same personal ambition and French pride that took him, the son of Algerian immigrants, from the tough La Castellane district of Marseille to World Cup glory in 1998. He did it once. Now, he wants to do it again. 

Asked if Zidane, given his scintillating form, should delay his retirement again, coach Raymond Domenech said: I think hes playing like this precisely because he is retiring. He can play with freedom and expression because he knows every game could be his last. 

The same may be said of Figo, a survivor of the golden generation that won the Fifa World Youth Championships of 1989 and 1991, and his team as they bid to reach the July 9 final. 

Reflecting on Portugals stirring progress, Figo said: You think about what you have done, about the country behind you, supporting you, suffering with you and that gives you the strength to continue to play. 

As to his own international future, he was bluntly direct. Every game could be my last? Im not eternal...

 TACTICAL SNEAK-PEEK

 France coach Raymond Domenech 

 is expected to name an unchanged side for the third successive 

 game, a preferred 4-2-3-1 formation with Henry alone up 

 front. Portugal coach Luiz Felipe Scolari prefers a combative 

 4-5-1 system with Pauleta as the lone striker. Facing technically 

 superior teams in the last two rounds, Portugal have not 

 been ashamed to use rough-arm tactics and gamesmanship to 

 unsettle the opposition.

 FRANCE

 Defence: Domenech started 

 William Gallas with Lilian Thuram in the centre of defence 

 in the build-up to the tournament. Gallas, who had previously 

 been made to play at left back against his will, adapted 

 in no time and the new formula works perfectly. Right back 

 Willy Sagnol likes to get forward. Eric Abidal, on the left, 

 is a little more cautious. Frances tight flat back 

 four restricted Brazil to one shot on goal during the quarter 

 final.

 Midfield: Patrick Vieira 

 and Claude Makelele play in front of the defence, covering 

 plenty of ground. Zidane sticks to his playmakers 

 role with Franck Ribery and Florent Malouda acting as wingers, 

 often switching sides.

 Attack: Domenech will 

 opt for a single striker in Henry, who scored the winner 

 against Brazil. 

 PORTUGAL

 Defence: The back four 

 have vulnerabilities but have proved rugged and determined, 

 held the Dutch at bay and have conceded only one goal in 

 five games. Centre backs Ricardo Carvalho and Fernando Meira 

 are happier on the ground than in the air while full-backs 

 Miguel and Nuno Valente sometimes appear to enjoy getting 

 forward more than holding position.

 Midfield: Playmaker Deco 

 and midfield holding player Costinha return after missing 

 the quarter final against England through suspension. Maniche 

 has been impressive so far and has two goals, while Cristiano 

 Ronaldo has improved and is a constant menace for defenders 

 even if his final pass is often wanting.

 Attack: Pauleta took his 

 tally to 47 goals in 85 games when he scored the winner 

 against Angola but has been pretty well shackled since. 

 He knows his role well though and makes endless runs off 

 the ball to provide a target for the midfield quintet.

 THE KEY MEN

 FRANCE

 THIERRY HENRY

 Often criticised for his apparent 

 lack of performance for the national team, Thierry Henry, 

 with already three goals under his belt, could be the biggest 

 threat to Portugal defence. He is a dedicated professional 

 who came through the ranks of the French national soccer 

 academy. He is fast, highly skilled and lethal in front 

 of goal. Against Brazil, Henry came up from almost nowhere 

 to volley home the only goal of the match to send the holders 

 packing. Given his current form, he may repeat the same 

 against Portugal.

 ZINEDINE ZIDANE

 Dismissed as a 'finished' footballer 

 at the start of the tournament, Zinedine Zidane has made 

 every opposition dance to his tune. A delicate ball player, 

 who always has something new to offer, the midfielder is 

 one player who holds the ability to make all the difference 

 between the two teams. Given his showings against a compact 

 Spain defence and a highly skilful Brazil, France will once 

 again depend on him to deliver. He is capable of tearing 

 apart the Portuguese defence and Scolaris demigod 

 status. 

 PORTUGAL

 CRISTIANO RONALDO

 Under fire from British press 

 for his role in ejecting Rooney from the pitch in the quarter 

 finals, Cristiano Ronaldo is the livewire of the Portugal 

 attack. One of the hottest young talents in world football, 

 he is a treat to watch because of his surging runs and dazzling 

 skills performed at blistering pace. Against England, after 

 Figo was taken off, Cristiano created panic whenever he 

 had the ball. Scolari has a lot of faith in Cristiano and 

 once said: Cristiano has everything needed to be 

 one of the stars of the World Cup.

 COSTINHA

 Francisco Jose da Costa, better 

 known as Costinha, is a vital part of Scolaris gameplan 

 in the current World Cup and could play a crucial role in 

 taming Zinedine Zidane. A powerful defensive midfielder, 

 Costinha has been picked up by Scolari because of his no-nonsense 

 attitude, despite a loss of form at the club level for Dynamo 

 Kiev. He had personal assurances from Scolari when the Russian 

 team relegated him to the bench. He has scored his fair 

 share of goals despite being a defensively-minded player.

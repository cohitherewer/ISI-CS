 Uefa charge against Croatia, England 

London: The Croatian and English Football Associations were charged by Uefa, European soccers governing body, for improper behaviour at their Euro 2008 qualifier in Zagreb on October 11. 

The charges relate to incidents inside and outside Dinamo Zagrebs Maksimir Stadium where Croatia beat England 2-0 in their group E qualifier. 

The charges will be heard by Uefas Control and Disciplinary Body in Nyon (Switzerland) on November 9. 

William Gaillard, Fifas director of communications, said: The charge against the Croatian FA is that they mishandled the entrance procedure and there was crowd misbehaviour. 

He said the charge against the English FA related to fans behaviour. Adrian Bevington, spokesman for the English FA, said: We are extremely surprised to have been charged by the Uefa. We will contest this and request a personal hearing and seek to call up as many witnesses as we require.

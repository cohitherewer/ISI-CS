 Atwal tied 67th

Palm Beach Garden: Arjun Atwal was tied for 67th place with a two-over par 74 in the opening round of the $5.5 million Honda Classic Golf on the USPGA Tour here on Thursday. 

Atwal was pulled down by a triple bogey on his 16th hole, the seventh of the front nine on a windy day. 

Atwal, who had three birdies, two bogeys and one triple in his round, now needs a good round to ensure a weekend berth. 

Daniel Chopra shot a one-over 73 with three birdies and four bogeys. 

David Toms made five straight birdies to highlight his 5-under round of 67, and he shared the first-round lead with Geoff Ogilvy, Ryuji Imada and Mathias Gronberg ? the seventh alternate who didnt know he was officially in the field until Wednesday morning.

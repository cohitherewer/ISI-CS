 Sandeep needs monitoring

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Chandigarh: The condition of India hockey player Sandeep Singh remained stable on Wednesday. 

Sandeep, recuperating at the intensive care unit of the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research after suffering a bullet injury accidentally fired by a RPF assistant sub-inspector on the Shatabdi Express on Tuesday, has been responding to treatment after undergoing an operation. 

Considering the magnitude of injuries, Sandeep is presently stable. However, he still needs monitoring of vital organs. His condition is still critical due to his pancreatic injury, a doctor treating him told The Telegraph. 

According to doctors, the bullet that was removed on Tuesday was lodged in the pelvis. A stomach tear was also noticed. He may have to remain in the ICU for some more days, a doctor informed. 

Family sources said they had sought a thorough probe into the accidental shooting.

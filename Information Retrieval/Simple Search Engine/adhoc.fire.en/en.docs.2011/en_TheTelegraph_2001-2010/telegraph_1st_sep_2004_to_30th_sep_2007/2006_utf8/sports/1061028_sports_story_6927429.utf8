 Akhmedov eyes winning start 

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: India coach Islam Akhmedov is eyeing a winning start in the AFC Youth Championship, which gets underway simultaneously in Calcutta and Bangalore on Sunday. 

According to Akhmedov, advancing to the quarters from the round-robin league stage will be a huge challenge. 

India are in group A with defending champions South Korea, Jordan and Kyrgyzstan. Group B comprises China, Thailand, the UAE and Australia. All group A and B matches will be held in Calcutta. 

Korea and Jordan are formidable challengers. So, to keep our hopes alive, we definitely need to defeat Kyrgyzstan in the first match (on Sunday), the India coach said. 

Indias remaining engagements are on Tuesday (versus Jordan) and Thursday (versus South Korea). 

India had a gruelling practice session under lights at the Salt Lake Stadium on Friday. Later, Akhmedov hinted he could opt for the 3-4-3 formation against Kyrgyzstan. 

We know very little about the opponents but our priorities are clear, we cant afford to lose points against them, said the Indian coach. 

Its likely that Mohun Bagan duo Shilton Paul (goalkeeper) and Sushil Singh (striker) will be in Sundays starting line-up.

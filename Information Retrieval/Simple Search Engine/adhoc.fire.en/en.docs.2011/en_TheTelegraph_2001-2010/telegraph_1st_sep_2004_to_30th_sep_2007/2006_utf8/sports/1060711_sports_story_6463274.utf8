 Italy return home 

Rome: Italians savoured their teams World Cup victory on Monday as the champions returned home from a triumph that temporarily took minds off the imminent outcome of a match-fixing trial. 

The plane carrying the Azzurri landed at Pratica di Mare, a military airport on the coast just south of the capital. 

The pilot hung an Italian flag out of the cockpit window as the plane came to a halt and team captain Fabio Cannavaro held up the gold trophy as he and coach Marcello Lippi emerged to cheers from thousands of waiting fans. (Reuters)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 England can top rankings

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: If England win by three clear Tests during the forthcoming Ashes, England will overtake Australia at the top of the LG ICC Test Championship table. 

Englands series win over Pakistan in August has left them 11 rating points adrift of Ricky Pontings side but the gap will disappear if England secure a win in the five-match series. A 3-0 or 4-1 win will take England to 124 rating points while Australia will drop to 123.

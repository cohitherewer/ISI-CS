 Upset Kaiser pulls up Klinsmann

 Klinsmann 

 Duesseldorf: German coach 

 Juergen Klinsmann was scolded by Franz Beckenbauer on Monday 

 for skipping a meeting of top officials from all 32 World 

 Cup finalists and returning home to California.

 Germanys organising committee 

 president said he was angry and disappointed that Klinsmann 

 was not in Duesseldorf for the two-day meetings to discuss 

 technical issues.

 Its incredible that 

 hes not here, Beckenbauer said. As host 

 nation you have to be here. Nearly all the coaches are here. 

 Carlos Alberto Parreira came from Brazil, Sven-Goran Eriksson 

 came from England, but our head coach is not here. I dont 

 want to say anything more about it because the more I think 

 about it, the more drastic my choice of words will become.

 Klinsmann, who has been commuting 

 between his native Germany and his home in southern California 

 since taking the job in August 2004, has faced sharp criticism 

 following his sides dreary performance in a 1-4 loss 

 in Italy last week.

 It led to a new flare-up of media 

 and public rage at Klinsmanns decision to stay based 

 in the US ahead of the tournament. Many Bundesliga coaches 

 and German officials argue Klinsmann should be in Germany 

 to watch matches each week.

 Everyone runs their business 

 the way they see fit and according to the way they were 

 raised, said Beckenbauer, who has long been an ardent 

 backer of most of Klinsmanns decisions and rarely 

 criticised his prot?ge in public before Monday.

 He should have been here. 

 This is an obligatory meeting and he does not have all that 

 many meetings that are obligatory.

 Beckenbauer, who lives just south 

 of the German border in Austria, said Klinsmann needed to 

 show his presence in Germany, if nothing else to calm the 

 countrys nerves after their humiliating defeat in 

 Florence last week.

 He was needed here to sweep 

 up some of the broken glass, said Beckenbauer, whose 

 news conference was quickly brought to a conclusion by German 

 officials just as he was growing angry.

 It doesnt make sense 

 any more to talk to him about it, said Beckenbauer, 

 60. I dont know how often Ive told him 

 that he must be in Germany during the final run-up to the 

 tournament. If thats how he views the profession then 

 he will have to live with the criticism.

 Klinsmann has defended his decision 

 to live in California, saying he spends half of each month 

 in Germany and communicates with players and coaches via 

 emails and telephone calls.

 Germany team manager Oliver Bierhoff 

 backed the coach, saying that he and assistant coach Joachim 

 Loew were handling all the issues for Klinsmann.

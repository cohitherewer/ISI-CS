 Rana Naved ruled out of Lords Test

Canterbury: Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer confirmed on Wednesday that pace bowler Rana Naved-ul Hasan will not feature in next weeks first Test against England at Lords. 

He is improving on a daily basis and we were going to give him a fitness test on Thursday. But we have put him back a little bit because we feel he is getting better, Woolmer said on Wednesday. 

He wont be available for the first Test, but certainly he could be available after that, the former England batsman added. 

We were going to see how fit he really was and put him through it. But we have just knocked that back two or three days because the groin is getting better and we dont want to rush it too much. 

Maybe we will give him a few days and he will be even better, he said. 

Naved sustained a groin injury while playing for Sussex earlier in the English season and there were fears that surgery may be required. 

But the 28-year-old has made encouraging progress in his recovery and Pakistan had planned to give him a fitness test on Thursday. (AFP)

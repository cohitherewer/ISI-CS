 Zidane: I have returned to win Cup

Paris: Zinedine Zidane on Monday said he had not returned to the international fold to be made to look a clown, but to win the World Cup. 

The 33-year-old, who had retired after Euro 2004, returned last August to help France qualify for the World Cup finals. 

He told a French newspaper that he wanted to taste World Cup glory again just as he did in 1998. 

You know, I did not come back to play the clown, said the Real Madrid star. Now that I am here, it is to go to the end! It is to win, added Zidane, who scored twice in the 3-0 victory over Brazil in the 1998 World Cup final. 

Zidane said there was no point in a player turning up at the World Cup just for the sake of it. 

Yes, we are going there (to Germany) to win the World Cup. It is a wonderful and magnificent journey, that is to say and even to repeat it: we can win. (AFP)

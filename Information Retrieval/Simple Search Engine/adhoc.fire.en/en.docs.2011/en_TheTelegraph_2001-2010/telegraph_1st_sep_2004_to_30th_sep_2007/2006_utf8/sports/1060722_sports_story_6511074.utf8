 Lara plans book launch during Cup

 - Wont be 100% on cricket 

Dubai: Brian Lara will tell his story through a book which could be launched during next years World Cup in the Caribbean. 

Nowadays I spend a lot of time on writing. I am in the process of writing a book which will tell my story, and am trying to release it during the World Cup. I have spoken to a literary agent, Lara told a newspaper here. 

It is not going to be a hundred per cent cricket-oriented book. It will be interlocked with many moments of my life that the fans dont know about, he added. 

The 37-year-old West Indies captain said he plans to play till the next England tour but would definitely step down if he became a liability. 

There are some cricketers who played well even after 40s. If I become a liability to the team, I will definitely step away, he was quoted as saying in another daily. 

Our immediate priority is to defend the Champions Trophy in October, he added. 

About Dwayne Bravo not being given a retainer contract, Lara said: He is a key player... One of our best allrounders. I am sure the issue of contracts will be sorted out very soon. 

The Twenty20 version of the game doesnt fascinate him because it does not test the ability of a player, though Lara agrees the new format has spectator value. 

Test cricket is my game. It is a game I really love to play. Before being asked to captain the team for the third time, I tried to guide my career in the direction of playing more Tests and less ODIs, said Lara. 

I dont think it (Twenty20) tests the ability of players like Tests do. But it is good for the crowd. You are playing a sport, and sport is all about spectators, Lara was quoted as saying in a daily.

 DAY III HIGHLIGHTS

 Dwayne 

 Bravo was Anil Kumbles 520th Test victim. The Indian 

 leggie, playing his 108th Test, is now No. 4 on the wicket-takers 

 list. Those ahead of him are ? Shane Warne (685 in 140 Tests), 

 Muttiah Muralidharan (635 in 106) and Glenn McGrath (542 

 in 119). Kumble pushed Courtney Walsh to the No. 5 spot 

 (519 in 132) 

 Virender 

 Sehwags three for 33 was his best Test figures, bettering 

 the two for 32 he achieved in the first match. Sehwag now 

 has seven wickets in the series 

 Sehwag 

 became only the third Indian to score 180 or more runs and 

 claim three wickets in an innings in the same Test. Only 

 Vinoo Mankad (thrice) and Ravi Shastri (once) have achieved 

 this feat 

 Sehwags 

 180-plus score and three-wicket showing was, however, the 

 first time anyone had achieved such a double 

 in the same match against the West Indies. Polly Umrigar 

 had come close, claiming five for 107 and scoring an unbeaten172 

 in Port-of-Spain in 1961-62 

 Indias 

 first-innings lead of 373 was their fourth-largest after 

 the 400-run lead vs Australia in Calcutta in 1997-98 (India 

 won by innings amp; 219 runs), the 394 run-lead vs the 

 West Indies in New Delhi in 1978-79 (match drawn) and the 

 376-run lead vs Pakistan in Rawalpindi in 2003-04 (India 

 won by innings amp; 131 runs) 

 India 

 enforced the follow-on for the fourth time against the Windies. 

 The previous occasions were in ? Kingston (1970-71), New 

 Delhi (1978-79) and Mumbai (2002-03). India managed to win 

 only the Mumbai Test, by an innings and 112 runs, while 

 the Kingston and New Delhi Tests were drawn 

 Chris 

 Gayle became the third West Indian to be dismissed twice 

 on the same day of a Test vs India. Roy Fredericks and Steve 

 Camacho fell twice in a day in the Kingston Test of the 

 1970-71 series 

 On 

 Sunday, Rahul Dravid became the seventh batsman to aggregate 

 5000 runs in away Tests when he reached 97. He joined an 

 elite group comprising Sachin Tendulkar (5552 in 72 matches), 

 Allan Border (5431 in 70), Viv Richards (5404 in 73), Brian 

 Lara (5288 in 63), Steve Waugh (5217 in 79) and Sunil Gavaskar

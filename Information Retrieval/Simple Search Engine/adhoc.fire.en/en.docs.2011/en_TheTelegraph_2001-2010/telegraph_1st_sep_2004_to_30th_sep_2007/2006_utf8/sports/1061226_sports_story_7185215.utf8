The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 EB keep faith in Pereira 

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: In a dramatic turn of events, East Bengal officials have decided to repose faith in coach Carlos Roberto Pereira for the rest of the season. 

Pereira, who had earlier sought 24-hour time to decide on his future, has also been asked to meet the officials again on Tuesday. 

We are planning to retain him for the National League also. We are in search for a striker and hope well be able to get him before the National League, said an official. 

Pereira, meanwhile, joined a Christmas party with Jose Ramirez Barreto and other Brazilians at the Mohun Bagan captains residence.

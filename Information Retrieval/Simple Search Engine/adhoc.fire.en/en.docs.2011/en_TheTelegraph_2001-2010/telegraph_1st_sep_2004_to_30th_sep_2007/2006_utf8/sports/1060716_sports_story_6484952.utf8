The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 AIFF lacks a policy on the support staff

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: To All India Football Federation (AIFF), appointing a foreign coach is like taking the final flight to the world of modern football. 

To them, the additional responsibilities attached to it for the overall growth of the national team matters little, including that of the importance of proper support staff. 

The confusion that has been created for the past few days over the Union government clearance of some of the support staff for the Vancouver-bound squad only adds to the belief that the AIFF is trying to run the show on an ad hoc basis. While a highly paid Bob Houghton has been given the charge to lift the declining standard of Indian football, he has not been provided with a permanent team of technical staff to meet the demands. 

To start with, a lot of backroom drama was enacted before the doctor and the physical trainer attached to the team could be cleared for the tour. Both Dr Manab Bhattacharya and Pradeep Dutta (physical trainer) are employees of the Sports Authority of India (SAI) and received clearance from their employers only after interventions from the AIFF president Priya Ranjan Das Munshi. 

Some in the Indian team management view that AIFF should now appoint its own permanent support staff like any other developed football countries. The AIFF first tried to rope in Mahindra United coach Derrick Pereira and his Salgaocar counterpart Savio Medeira, but finally had to settle for Mauricio Afonso after both Mahindra and Salgaocar refused to release their coaches for national duty. 

This is once again a kind of adhocism which is not going to help in the long run, said an AIFF member, who did not wish to be named. Why cant they appoint support staff under contract like chief coach Houghton? To save money the AIFF appoints Goan coaches when the camp is in Goa. They might take someone from Calcutta when the camp will be held there... This can only create confusion and will not do any good to the teams cause. 

 Houghton, when asked on the performance of his support 

 staff, sounded cautious. They are excellent, but at 

 the moment, I am doing most of the work since I need to 

 know each and every player. Later of course, the support 

 staff should be more involved in things.

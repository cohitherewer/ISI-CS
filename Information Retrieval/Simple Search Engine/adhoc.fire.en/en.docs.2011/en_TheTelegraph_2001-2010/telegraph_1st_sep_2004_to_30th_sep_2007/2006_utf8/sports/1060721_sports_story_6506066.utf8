Mumbai: Sachin Tendulkar, out of big league action for four months following shoulder surgery, returned to Indias one-day squad on Thursday for the upcoming tri-series in Sri Lanka, while Dinesh Mongia was recalled after more than a year. 

Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) secretary Niranjan Shah announced the squad after a meeting of the five-member selection panel. 

Tendulkar expectedly found his way back into the 15-member squad for the August 14 to 29 tournament after being declared fit two days ago. 

[That Mongia stood a good chance was reported by The Telegraph on Thursday.] 

Chief selector Kiran More said Tendulkar was included after being declared fit by the national squads physiotherapist, John Gloster. 

Punjabs Mongia was rewarded for his fine show on the English County circuit for Leicestershire. Opener Robin Uthappa and middle-order batsman Venugopal Rao, who went to the West Indies, were left out. 

Left-Arm paceman Zaheer Khan was ignored despite a very fine performance for Worcestershire. 

The selectors also chose to ignore Anil Kumble. The 35-year-old is Indias most successful one-day bowler with 329 wickets but has played little limited-overs cricket since the last World Cup. 

However More hinted at his possible return in the near future. Its an indication that the bowler may be recalled for the Champions Trophy. 

More said that henceforth there would not be many changes in the team. However, he added that the doors were not closed on anyone. 

We also considered Zaheer, but he did not fit into our plans. 

Irfan Pathan, who had an indifferent tour to the Caribbean, received Mores backing. Pathan is a very good cricketer and three bad matches does not mean he is a bad cricketer. 

Former India captain Sourav Ganguly, currently playing for Northamptonshire, continued to find himself out of favour. 

Captain Rahul Dravid, meanwhile, said he was happy with the selection. 

The squad will undergo a fitness camp in Bangalore from July 25 to August 1, followed by a skills-specific camp from August 6 to 10. It will leave for Colombo on August 10. 

 Shah said Sanjay Jagdale would 

 accompany the squad as manager. (AGENCIES)

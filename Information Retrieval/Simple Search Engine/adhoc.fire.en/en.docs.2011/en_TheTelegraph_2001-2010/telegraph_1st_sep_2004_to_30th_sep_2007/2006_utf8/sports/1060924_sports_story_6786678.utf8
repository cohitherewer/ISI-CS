The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Martina consoles Sania

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Top seed Martina Hingis flattened crowd favourite Sania Mirza 6-1, 6-0 in the semi-finals of the Sunfeast Open on Saturday. At the post-match press conference, Hingis was humility personified: Sania played much better than the scoreline suggests. Yes, she did miss a couple of returns in the second set. But then, it is never easy in front of the home crowd and she made it to the semi-final, which is creditable. 

Was Hingis better prepared for her opponent in this match than she was when they met in Dubai earlier this year? Certainly. Today everyone knows that Sania has a strong forehand. Her backhand is improving too. She has come a long way. This year has been difficult for her... She should take the positives from todays match and move on. 

Were the long rallies a part of her strategy? Yes, they were... so that my opponents get tired and dont overpower me. I was changing both pace and strategy. Bottomline was I had to keep the ball in court to keep up the pressure and unnerve her. 

How did she feel about the crowd? It was great that so many people came to watch. The atmosphere was just like in a cricket match. 

Sania, however, acknowledged she was caught on a day when the world No. 9 was playing at her best, while she certainly was not. Her anticipation is so good like Roger Federer that she is ready with the return before I had even hit the ball, said Sania. 

She, along with Dementieva, is one of the best movers on court on the Tour. Hingis is a born athlete who plays tennis while Im a tennis player whos just learning to run.

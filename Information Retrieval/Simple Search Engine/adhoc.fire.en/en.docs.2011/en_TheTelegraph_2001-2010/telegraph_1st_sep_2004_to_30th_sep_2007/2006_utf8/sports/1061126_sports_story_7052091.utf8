 Sourav cautioned for showing dissent 

Mohali: Bengal captain Sourav Ganguly was cautioned by the Match Referee for showing dissent to an umpiring decision in Mohali on Saturday. 

We cautioned him as he had shown dissent but the issue is settled now, Match Referee Rajo Pankule said. 

He said Sourav had shown dissent after umpire S. Ravindron turned down one of his appeals. 

Talking to reporters after his teams victory over Punjab, Sourav tried to play down the incident. 

There was lot of noise on the field and we got a bit excited. The Match Referee asked what had happened, but that was it, he said. 

On Friday also, Sourav had expressed his displeasure after being ruled out leg-before on a score of 43 and he sat brooding in the dressing room. 

The former Team India captain tried to sidestep questions on Indias poor performances of late. 

I am far away in Mohali and they are playing in South Africa. I cant really comment on anything except hoping that they will do better, he said. 

I know anything I say will make headlines, he said, adding that he was sure the team under Dravid will do well. 

Sourav, whose team snatched a 14-run win over Punjab to earn four points, patted his bowlers for helping his team bounce back after being bundled out for 156 and 148 in the match. 

We are a good side and we put a good effort to pull it through. Its a good start to the season, he said. 

Sourav, who was among the wickets in this match, said he had been working hard to improve his bowling. 

Sachin (Tendulkar with his bowling) gives good options to the team. 

I have also been working consistently in this department, he said.

 Agassi to retire after US Open 

 Andre Agassi 

London: Andre Agassi announced his retirement on Saturday and said he would play his final tennis match at the US Open which starts in August. 

The 36-year-old American, one of only five men to win all four Grand Slam titles in their career, said he planned to compete at Wimbledon and two other tournaments before the US Open which begins in New York on August 28. 

This Wimbledon will be my last and the US Open will be my last tournament, Agassi told a news conference at the All England Club two days before the start of Wimbledon. 

Agassi, who has been struggling with a chronic back problem, won the first of his eight Grand Slam singles titles at Wimbledon in 1992 when he beat Croatian Goran Ivanisevic in five sets in the final. (Reuters)

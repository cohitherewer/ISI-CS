The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Federer moves into last 4

 - Day IX sees longest tie in Big W history 

- Paes-Damm in semis 

London: Mens champion Roger Federer outclassed Croatias Mario Ancic 6-4, 6-4, 6-4 to reach the Wimbledon semi-finals on Wednesday. 

In the last four, the Swiss ? who is attempting to become only the third man in the professional era to win four consecutive Wimbledon singles titles ? will face either Czech Radek Stepanek or Swedens Jonas Bjorkman. 

Veteran Jonas Bjorkman outlasted Radek Stepanek of the Czech Republic 7-6, 4-6, 6-7, 7-6, 6-4 to set up a semi-final against top seed Federer. 

Ancics shock first round win over Federer at Wimbledon in 2002 was the last time the Swiss lost a match on grass, but the seventh seed failed to cause the top seed any real problems in humid conditions on Wednesday. 

Two rain interruptions could not distract Federer who used forehand winners to break in each of the first two sets, and he played some sublime tennis in the third, sealing his 46th successive win on grass with an ace. 

Federer could think of only one word to describe his win over Ancic on Wednesday: Incredible. 

I had a period where it was so good, it was just incredible, Federer told at a post-match news conference after setting up a semi-final against either Czech 14th seed Radek Stepanek or Swedens Jonas Bjorkman. 

Usually rain delays, they slow you down and everything, but they actually gave me more. I played even better. So I was very, very pleased. 

I knew the danger of playing against him (Ancic), said the Swiss. He has a great serve, hes got the game on grass, he can volley, he plays aggressive on everything, takes chances and so forth. 

Leander Paes and Martin Damm moved into the semi-final of the mens doubles competition when they defeated Australian Paul Hanley and Kevin Ullyet of Zimbabwe in a thrilling five setter. 

Seventh seeded Paes and Damm came from behind to win the match 7-6 (10-8), 6-7 (5-7), 6-7 (5-7), 7-6 (9-7), 6-2 against the fourth seeded duo. 

Canadas Daniel Nestor and Mark Knowles of the Bahamas won the longest match in Wimbledon history on Wednesday when they took six hours and nine minutes to win a mens doubles quarter final. 

The third seeds beat Swedens Simon Aspelin and Todd Perry of Australia 5-7, 6-3, 6-7, 6-3, 23-21 in a match that had started on Tuesday. The final set lasted 193 minutes. 

The previous record for a mens doubles was five hours five minutes in 1985, a quarter final that was completed in a day. 

The longest match of all had been a second round mens singles in 1989 between qualifier Greg Holmes and fellow American Todd Witsken which lasted five hours 28 minutes, spread over three days, before Holmes won 14-12 in the fifth set. 

In the boys singles, Indias Sanam Singh, seeded eight, went down to 12th seed Artur Chernov of Russia 6-2, 6-3 in the third round. 

 Rupesh Roy and his partner Hsin Han Lee of Chinese 

Taipei beat Edgar Rodriguez of Colombia and Jose-Roberto Velasco of Bolivia 6-7 

(2-7), 6-3, 6-4.

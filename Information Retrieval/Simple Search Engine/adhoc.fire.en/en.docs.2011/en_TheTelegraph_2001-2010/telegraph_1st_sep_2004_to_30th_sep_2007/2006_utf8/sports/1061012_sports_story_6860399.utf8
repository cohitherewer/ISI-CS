 Sehwag, Dhoni hog limelight 

Jaipur: Virender Sehwag slammed a century off 91 balls for India XI but ended up on the losing side in a warm-up for the Champions Trophy at the Neerja Modi ground on Wednesday. 

The oppositions comprised a few Team India players as well after the thinktank decided to mix the India XI and RCA XI squads to make the practice game more competitive. 

Batting first, India XI scored a strong 296 for 5 in 50 overs but RCA XI, which had Mahendra Singh Dhoni (98) and Suresh Raina (78) in their ranks, overhauled the target, making 299 for 3 in 49.1 overs. 

However, if the batting of the stars would have left the team management smiling, the form of Irfan Pathan with the ball is surely to give nightmares to Rahul Dravid and Co. 

Pathan was spanked severely by the India XI batsmen, giving away 83 runs in 10 overs. He, however, did no harm to his reputation as a batsman, chipping in with 49. 

Harbhajan Singh scored 26 not out to contribute to his sides seven-wicket win. 

Earlier, Sehwag and Sachin Tendulkar (39) set off their side to a rollicking start. Sehwag was in more destructive mood though, slamming 13 boundaries and two sixes in his belligerent knock before retiring on 107. 

Dhoni, who also batted for India XI, made 17 off 15 balls with two sixes before retiring while comeback-man Dinesh Mogia scored 27 off 24 balls with two fours. 

The Jharkhand wicketkeeper-batsman, who was tried as an opener by RCA XI, made amends for his disappointing outing by hitting 17 fours and one six in his 82-ball knock before retiring on 98. 

Meanwhile, heavy morning showers forced the cancellation of a warm-up tie between New Zealand and Mumbai at the Wankhede. 

BRIEF SCORES 

India XI 296/5 in 50 ovs (Virender Sehwag 107 retd, Sachin Tendulkar 39). RCA XI 299/3 in 49.1 ovs (Mahendra Singh Dhoni 98, Suresh Raina 78). RCA XI won by 7 wkts.

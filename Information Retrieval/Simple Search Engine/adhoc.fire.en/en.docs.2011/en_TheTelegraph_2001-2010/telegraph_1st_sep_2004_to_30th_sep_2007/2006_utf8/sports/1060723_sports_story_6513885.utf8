 Aussies pip Pak in opener

Terrassa (Spain): Australia began their Champions Trophy defence with a 3-2 win over Pakistan in the opening match on Saturday. 

With the mercury nudging 38 degrees, Pakistan turned the heat on the Australians but were unable to get their noses in front. Australia opened the scoring in the first three minutes, with Michael McCann deflecting a goal off Brent Livermores free hit outside the circle. 

Pakistan equalised when Sohai Abbas converted a penalty two minutes before the break. In the second half, Troy Elder made the difference for Australia, converting two penalty corners while Abbas responded with a penalty for Pakistan. (AFP)

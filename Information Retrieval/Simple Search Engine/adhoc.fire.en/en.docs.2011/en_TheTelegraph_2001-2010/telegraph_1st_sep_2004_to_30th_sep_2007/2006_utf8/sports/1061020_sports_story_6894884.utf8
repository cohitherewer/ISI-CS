 Were genuine contenders for the title: Fleming

OUR CORRESPONDENT 

Mumbai: New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming on Thursday sent a strong warning to his Champions Trophy rivals, describing his team as genuine contenders for the title. We have been inconsistent in the past and thats our biggest worry. So we want to put together a series of good games, which will not only help get us to the semi-final, but also to win the competition, he said on Thursday, the eve of New Zealands match against Sri Lanka. 

Fleming also drew a comparison between their trophy-winning performance in 2000 in Kenya and the current one here. In 2000, we had hoped for a good show. Now we have come here with the expectation that we are genuine contenders for the title. Now, we dont want to be the perennial dark horses of any competition. Thats the major difference. 

In the last couple of years, weve been injecting new blood in the team. Now we play in tournaments with an aim to win, thats a big change from what it was in 2000, the New Zealand opener pointed out. 

Sri Lanka skipper Mahela Jayawardene, on the other hand, admitted that his team was in a tricky situation. We have been pushed to the wall... For us, its basically two semi-finals. If destiny is in our hands we should be able to he said. 

Coach Tom Moody hoped the team would be able to carry the momentum going forward, but hinted at a deviation from the seam-based attack to a spinner-heavy line-up. The logic of going in with four pacers (in Jaipur) is that we won ten games in a row doing that. But it doesnt mean that we will go into tomorrows match with the same formula, he said.

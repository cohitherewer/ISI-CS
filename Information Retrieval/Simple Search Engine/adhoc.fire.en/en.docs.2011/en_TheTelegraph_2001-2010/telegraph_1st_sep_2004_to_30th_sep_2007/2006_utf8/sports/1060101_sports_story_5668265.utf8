 Former greats slam IHF

 Zafar Iqbal 

New Delhi: The Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) drew flak from the former greats for not adopting effective steps to control the players repeated involvement in violence during tournaments. 

Its up to the IHF. They should identify the culprits and take them to task. But, at the same time they should stop the practice of lifting a two-year ban in two months, former captain Ashok Kumar said on Saturday while condemning Fridays clash between the players of Namdhari XI and Indian Oil during the Nehru Cup Hockey Tournament at the Shivaji Stadium. 

Its sad that these things are overshadowing the matches. The conduct of the players is ultimately hampering the image of hockey. If they need to show off their power and animosity against each other then they should show it in their game by playing well, he said.The son of legendary Dhyan Chand said it was high time the IHF took the issue seriously and acted sternly against erring players and recommended a thorough process to curb the unsporting and violent conduct of players. There should be a committee to observe the conduct of players and recommend action against those who indulge in such incidents, he said. 

Another former skipper Zafar Iqbal said: Hockey is suffering because of these unpleasant issues. And its strange that the IHF is sitting silent even after 24 hours of the incident, Iqbal said.

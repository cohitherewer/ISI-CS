 England team to watch: Akram

Karachi: Former Pakistan captain Wasim Akram backed England to win the World Cup, saying he expected Sven-Goran Erikssons men to triumph against the odds. 

Ill back England. By watching them play in recent months I feel they have the firepower to win the World Cup, Akram said on Saturday. 

England is just like my second home so when your own country is not there, you back the next best country and in my case I would love to see England win. 

Wasim, a self-confessed football fan, hoped the possible absence through a foot injury of star striker Wayne Rooney would not affect the teams performance. 

Its just like we lost Waqar Younis a few days before the 1992 cricket World Cup, Wasim said. 

But the loss made us more determined, we struggled initially but overcame and went on to win, said Akram, referring to Pakistans World Cup win in Australia. 

I have watched Rooney in Manchester where he plays and although he is an extraordinary talent... Teams dont rely on one player and I hope England overcome his loss if he doesnt play.

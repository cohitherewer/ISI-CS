 Dravid to be felicitated in Mumbai 

Mumbai: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) will felicitate captain Rahul Dravid who is poised to make his 100th Test appearance in Mumbai during the third and final Test against England on March 18. 

Sharad Pawar (BCCI and Mumbai Cricket Association president) would present Dravid with a scroll of honour and a memento before commencement of play, Prof Ratnakar Shetty, BCCIs executive secretary in charge said on Tuesday. 

 Dravid is also set to be felicitated on March 16 jointly by the CCI and the Bank of Baroda at a dinner function. 

Dravid is set to join the elite list of Kapil Dev (131 Tests), Sachin Tendulkar (130 appearances after Nagpur Test against England), Sunil Gavaskar (116), Dilip Vengsarkar (116) and Anil Kumble (104 after Nagpur) as the only Indian players to play 100 or more Tests in Mumbai. 

The Mumbai Test will also see Sachin surpass Kapil to become the most capped Indian player. 

It was not known if either BCCI or MCA had any plans to honour Sachin.

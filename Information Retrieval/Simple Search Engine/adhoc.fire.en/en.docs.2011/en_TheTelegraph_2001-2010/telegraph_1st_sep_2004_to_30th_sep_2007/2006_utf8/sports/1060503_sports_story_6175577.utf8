 Pakistan to make debut

Islamabad: Pakistan will make international debut in womens football when Jordan Football Association hosts the Womens Futsal Championship in Amman from May 11 to 18. 

This is the first time we are going to play in a competition thats open to the general public, said Robina Irfan, chairperson of Pakistan Football Federations women wing. 

Futsal, one of the 78 sports that involve teams, is the indoor version of soccer that is officially sanctioned by Fifa. 

Bahrain, who beat Abu Dhabi 3-2 in the final of the Arab womens soccer meet in February, will be one of the favourites.

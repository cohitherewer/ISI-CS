 We need to take a leaf out of Jaffers book: Lara

Gros Islet: West Indian captain Brian Lara urged his players on Friday to take a leaf out of Wasim Jaffers book and sustain their performance over five days to outclass the Indians in the remaining three Tests. 

Our batsmen made 650 runs in the two innings without anyone getting a hundred. So whereas it was a good solid allround show, we needed somebody to carry on like Jaffer, Lara said on the eve of the second Test. 

We stayed ahead on the first two days of the Antigua Test and then lost control. These are the kind of horses who once they get ahead, wander around rather than keep their focus. 

In the one-dayers, Chappell said we had forgotten how to win. While in one-dayers we have started to do the corrections, in Tests we still lose control after initial advantage. This is where we need to get better at. 

Lara backed himself to bounce back from his own poor form and produce loads of runs in the remainder of the series. The host captain hailed Chris Gayle for showing his stuff in the first Test for four hours to help the team earn a draw. 

Meanwhile, India are all set to bring in seamer Irfan Pathan to shore up their bowling at tack, weakened further by the injury-induced absence of Sreesanth, for the second Test against the West Indies beginning here on Saturday. 

Sreesanth, who was in the thick of things in the drawn first Test after being asked to bowl the final over, was ruled out of the match on Thursday due to a sore left heel which the physio said would take at least four days to heal. 

It (track) probably would not help our spinners much so we have to see how we can keep the pressure through seamers, Dravid said. While Pathan gets a look in despite being low on confidence, off-spinner Harbhajan Singh might have to wait till Saturday to know his fate after being left out of the scheme of things for the first match in Antigua. Harbhajan can only make it if the team wants to play with five bowlers. 

West Indies too would have to fiddle with their bowling combination, injury playing a part here as well. With Fidel Edwards out, his half-brother Pedro Collins is set to play after a gap of more than a year. West Indies also almost certainly would go for paceman Jerome Taylor at the expense of left-arm spinner Dave Mohammed.

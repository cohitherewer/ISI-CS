Offenbach: A capacity crowd of around 25,000 watched champions Brazil hold a light World Cup training session in an atmosphere of near-hysteria on Thursday. 

The first 20 minutes took place in the backdrop of loud techno and Brazilian Axe music which was suddenly cut off, possibly on the orders of the coaching staff. 

The stadium announcer also provided a running commentary as the players warmed up for practice with a game of pig in the middle. 

There were loud screams every time playmakers Ronaldinho and Kaka went near the touchline as the scenes bore more resemblance to a pop concert. 

The session, held at the stadium of German second division club Kickers Offenbach, was also interrupted when a teenager breached security and ran on to the field. He managed to get an autograph from Ronaldinho before being led away. 

Brazil face Croatia in their group F opener on Tuesday. 

Meanwhile, Ronaldo said Brazil President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva was badly influenced by the media when he made a jibe about the strikers weight. 

The leading scorer at the 2002 World Cup also complained at continuing talk over his blisters and his disc-jockeying exploits during training camp in Switzerland. 

Ronaldos weight, a sore point with the player, was again thrown into the spotlight during the Presidents video conference with the squad from Brasilia on Thursday. Lula jokingly asked the squad: Ronaldo is fat, or isnt he? 

Coach Carlos Alberto Parreira replied: Hes strong, Mr President, the structure of his body has changed, hes no longer that thin boy from 1994. 

Hes really had a year of difficulties, including two months without playing for Real Madrid when he was injured, but he will certainly by ready for the World Cup. 

The striker, who did not take part as he was in bed with a slight temperature, blamed the media for the comment. 

Im not angry with the President, I just think he was badly influenced by whats been coming out in the media, he told reporters. 

Ive come here, Ive been training and working, its normal I might have been a little above my normal weight when I arrived but thats gone down with the training. 

However, the media insist its still a problem and the blisters are still a problem. 

Ronaldo has become increasingly exasperated with suggestions he is fighting a losing battle against the flab. 

What difference does it make if Im one kilo overweight? The media has been talking about this nonsense for three years, he said. This doesnt interest anyone. Its daft. (Reuters)

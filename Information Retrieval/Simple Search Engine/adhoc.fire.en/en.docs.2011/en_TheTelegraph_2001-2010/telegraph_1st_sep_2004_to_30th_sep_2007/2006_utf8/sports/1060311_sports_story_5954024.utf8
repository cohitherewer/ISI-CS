The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Moscow: Anastasia Myskina on Friday announced that she will skip this season?s Fed Cup campaign.

 The 24-year-old heroine of Russia?s triumph in Moscow 15 months ago, who also helped the team defend their title last year, said she wanted to concentrate on her individual performance this season.

 ?I would like to play for myself this season,? Myskina said. ?Before I played for my country every time I was invited but this season I expect a very tough WTA season and I would like to concentrate on my individual performance.?

 Myskina was ranked world No. 2 in September after winning the French Open title earlier in the year but has dropped to 12th after struggling last season. 

 London: England A wicketkeeper Chris Read flew home from the West Indies on Thursday after receiving the news of a traumatic break-in at his house for the second time in 18 months.

 He will be replaced by Steven Davies, a 19-year-old Worcestershire wicketkeeper-batsman, who captained the under-19 team last year. 

 Rome: Riders at the Tirreno-Adriatico race have threatened to refuse to undergo blood tests after the sport?s governing body (UCI) carried out early morning tests in a hotel hallway.

 The riders represented by the Italian and international professional cyclist?s associations said the nature of the tests on Wednesday were unacceptable.

 ?We strongly call on the UCI to respect the rules and announce that the riders will not accept a repetition of similar episodes,? The ACCPI (Associazione Corridori Ciclisti Professionisti Italiani) and CPA (Cyclistes Professionels Associes) said in a statement on Thursday. 

 Madrid: Real Madrid?s new president Fernando Martin has ruled out an early election at the club, arguing it could jeopardise the team?s chances of qualifying for next season?s Champions League.

 ?I carry on as Real Madrid president until the end of the season and then I will decide on the right moment to call an election,? Martin was quoted as saying. ?We can?t call an election now because if we do it will give our rivals an advantage. There are 12 games left this season and the election campaign would occupy at least six of those. It would almost certainly influence the morale of the team.?

 Martin, who was nominated by Florentino Perez after his shock decision to quit as Real president two weeks ago, said that instead of preparing for an election he would spend his time building a team for next season. 

 Madrid: Real Madrid midfielder David Beckham will miss Saturday?s Primera Liga game at Valencia after straining his groin before the Champions League match at Arsenal. ?I won?t be able to be with the team for the next five or six days,? the England captain told the club?s website on Thursday. 

 Madrid: Madrid should not be put off 

 by the failure of its bid to hold the 2012 Olympics and 

 should try again for the 2016 Games, says International 

 Olympic Committee president Jacques Rogge.

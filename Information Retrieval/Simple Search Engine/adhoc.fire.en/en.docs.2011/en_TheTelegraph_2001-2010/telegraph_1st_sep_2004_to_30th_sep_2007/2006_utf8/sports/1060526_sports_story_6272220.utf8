 Surya helps India down Hungary 

 - Swati salvages draw vs Georgia 

 Surya scored Indias lone victory 

Turin: National champion Surya Sekhar Ganguly guided the Indian men to a narrow 2.5-1.5 victory over Hungary in the fourth round of the 37th Chess Olympiad here. 

WGM Swati Ghate scored a thumping victory against higher ranked International Master Nana Dzagnidze of Georgia and helped the Indian eves salvage a draw against third seed Georgia in the fourth round of the womens Chess Olympiad here. 

It turned out to be a difficult day for the second seeded Indians after Viswanathan Anand was held by Grandmaster Zoltan Almasi on the first board, but Surya Sekhars expertise came in handy against Robert Ruck. Both Krishnan Sasikiran and P. Harikrishna drew their games. 

At the top of the tables, Russia defeated China with a 3-1 margin to stay in joint lead along with Armenia, who trounced Norway 4-0, both having pocketed 13.5 points 

The Indian men are joint ninth at this stage with 11.5 points in their kitty. 

India will be up against China in the next round of this 148-team event in which nine rounds are still to be played. 

In the absence of star players like Peter Leko and Judit Polgar, it was a depleted Hungarian team that restricted the Indians to a minimal victory. 

Anand played the Sicilian Nazdorf against Almasi on the top board and the players followed a recently fashionable variation wherein the Indian ace did not quite get the counter play he was looking for in the English attack employed by his opponent. 

A little before that, Surya Sekhar crushed Ruck with his white pieces to give the team an early lead. The Indian GM, playing against the Sicilian Nazdorf, came up with a modest opening not played at the highest level too much but found Robert off guard amidst the intricacies. 

Harikrishna could do little on the third board against Csaba Horvath who played a disciplined game to hold the much higher rated opponent. 

WGM and highest ranked girl in the world Koneru Humpys wining streak was halted by seasoned Georgian WGM Nino Khurtsidze on the top board while Mary Ann went down against experienced WGM Lela Javakhishvili before Swati carved out a fine attacking victory to draw parity with the former champions. 

Russia took sole lead with 11.5 points out of a possible 12 and is now sitting on a huge 1.5 points ahead of nearest rival Ukraine. 

Three teams ? US, China and Bulgaria ? share the third spot on 9.5 points while there are five teams right on their heels with 9 points apiece. The Indian eves are next in the standings, with 8.5 points, sharing the 11th spot with six others. 

Humpy tried hard and came close to lead India to an upset victory over Georgia but for the perseverance of Khurtsidze on the top board. Earlier in the day, Swati outwitted Dzagnidze. The Indians rested D. Harika in this round and Mary Ann Gomes was outdone by Lela Javakhishvili.

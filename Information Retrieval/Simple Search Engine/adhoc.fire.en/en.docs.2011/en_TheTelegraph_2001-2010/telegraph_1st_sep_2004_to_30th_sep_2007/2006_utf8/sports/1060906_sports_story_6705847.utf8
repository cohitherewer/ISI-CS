New York: Leander Paes kept Indian hopes alive at the US Open by moving into the quarter finals of the mens doubles event (as reported in Tuesdays Late City edition), while Sania Mirza lost her third round womens doubles match to end her campaign at the Grand Slam tournament. 

Sixth seeds Paes and his Czech partner Martin Damm on Monday registered a facile 6-4, 6-2 win over Jarkko Nieminen of Finland and Graydon Oliver of the US to reach the last eight. 

Sanias campaign ended on a disappointing note as she and Liezel Huber of South Africa went down to sixth seeds Czech Kveta Peschke and Francesca Schiavone of Italy 6-3, 3-6, 5-7. 

The 11th-seeded Indo-African duo had won the Bangalore Open earlier this year. 

The Peschke-Schiavone pairing will meet second-seeded Chinese pair of Zi Yan and Jie Zheng next. 

In boys doubles, Rupesh Roy and Roberto Maytin of Venezuela cruised to the second round by posting a convincing 6-2, 6-2 win over home pair of Chase Buchanan and Marcus Fugate. 

However, in boys singles, 15th seed Jeevan Neduncheziyan was toppled by Michal Konecny of Czech Republic 1-6, 0-6. (PTI)

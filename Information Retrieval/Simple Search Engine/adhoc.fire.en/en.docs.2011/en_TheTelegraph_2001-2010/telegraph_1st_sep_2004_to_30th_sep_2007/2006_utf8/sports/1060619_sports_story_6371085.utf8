The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Thank God we won: Fred

Munich: Substitute Fred planned a special presentation to his father to celebrate his goal in Brazils 2-0 World Cup win over Australia on Sunday. 

Im going to give the ball as a present to my father, Fred, who came on in the 88th minute, told reporters after scoring an 89th-minute goal. 

I hope I can get everyone else to sign it for him. 

Thank God we were able to win. Im really happy about scoring a goal so shortly after I got on. 

Weve qualified for the next round so now well be able to play more openly. 

Australia captain Mark Viduka was pleased with the performance of his team. 

Its very disappointing not to get something out of the game but Brazil are Brazil and we gave them a good game, Viduka told Australian television. 

We played well and on another day it could have been different for us. 

The Socceroos, however, can still qualify for the second round with a victory over Croatia in their final Group F game in Stuttgart on Thursday. 

If we can get a result against Croatia then the group is still open for us, Viduka said.

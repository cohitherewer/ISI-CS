 Mahindra stare at home disadvantage 

 - Mumbai outfit suffers another defeat at Cooperage

 Pereira feels East Bengals progress can bring out the best in them 

New Delhi: With just two days to go before the current National Football League toppers East Bengal take on their traditional rivals Mohun Bagan in Calcutta, Mahindra United coach Derrick Pereira is an extremely worried man. While the other teams are waiting to grab as many points in their home matches, the very thought of playing at home is giving Pereira sleepless nights. 

The dipping fortune of the high-budget Mumbai outfit, which started with the defeat against Sporting Clube de Goa at the start of the second phase, reached its lowest ebb on Thursday when they lost to bottom-rankers Air India 1-2 at the Cooperage. 

While the Mahindra coach is still hopeful of giving a hot chase to East Bengal, the wobbly Cooperage turf in Mumbai, according to him, could turn out to be the biggest stumbling block. 

We have many players who enjoy running with the ball. It becomes difficult to do that at the Cooperage where playing long-balls is the best possible option to counter attacks, explained Pereira. 

Mahindra captured the best available stars in the transfer market, but most of them are finding it difficult to get their rhythm back on the under-prepared turf. 

East Bengal now lead the NFL pack with 21 points from 10 matches while Mahindra are a close second with 20 points from 10 games. Things could have been far better, but the defeats to Sporting and Air India and the 2-2 draw against Salgaocar in between, has left Mahindra a struggling lot of late. 

Pereira, however, did not blame the ground only. The problem is not entirely with the Cooperage turf. We have been doing well except scoring goals, he said. 

There are few other coaches, who feel that the Mumbai ground has played a crucial role in undermining the domination of Mahindra United. 

Salgaocar coach Savio Medeira said: The ground is in bad shape. This could be one of the reasons why Mahindra United havent been able to play fluently. 

Pereira, however, felt that the challenge from East Bengal will only help the team get more determined to regain the handsome lead it enjoyed in the first phase. Its good in a way. It could bring the best out of us .

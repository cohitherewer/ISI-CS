 AIFF worried over TFA

 - 'All-students team may not be competitive

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: The All India Football Federation (AIFF), it seems, is not entirely happy with the Tata Football Academys promotion to the National Football League (NFL). 

Aware of the fact that the Jamshedpur soccer institute prefers to play their teenaged students, the AIFF is afraid that the newly promoted side could prove to be a total mis-match in the NFL. 

According to sources, the federation might approach the TFA to bring a change in their side before the start of the next NFL. 

The federation would like them to field a more competitive side, which will not only consist of their students, but also some professional players, an AIFF official said. 

The federation strongly believes that it would simply be a disaster if the TFA persist playing with their students in the premier division next season. 

The competition in the NFL is so much that even the most professional sides like Salgaocar or Churchill Brothers get demoted. It would be difficult for TFA to survive with a bunch of freshers, the official felt. 

The federation, it is believed, might approach the TFA to field a full fledged professional team in the NFL. 

When pointed out that it would directly affect the basic character of the academy, the official said: The AIFF wont mind if they take part in the NFL with a changed name. It is not necessary that the team that will play in the NFL will have to register themselves under the name of TFA. 

The Jamshedpur side will have to field a completely new side next season as all their footballers, who helped them qualify for the premier division, have decided to sign for professional clubs in Calcutta, Goa and Ludhiana. 

The TFA assistant coach, Carlton Chapman has already hinted that he might approach some former TFA players to strengthen the side.

 Azhar invitation irks ICC

A STAFF REPORTER AND AGENCIES

Calcutta/New Delhi: The already strained relationship between the International Cricket Council (ICC) and the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) just got worse. 

On Friday, the games world governing body at loggerheads with BCCI over the Members Participation Agreement issue strongly disapproved of the Indian boards decision to invite banned former captain Mohammed Azharuddin to a function to mark the inauguration of its new headquarters in Mumbai. 

The ICC has a zero tolerance policy on corruption and wed like all our members to have a similar attitude, ICC spokesman Brian Murgatroyd said. 

When asked for reaction, BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah, however, said the matter is sub-judice. Firstly, its an internal matter of the BCCI. Secondly, since its sub-judice, I cant comment more on this, Shah pointed out when contacted on his cellphone. 

BCCI, it may be recalled, has sent invitations to all its past presidents and past captains of India, including Jagmohan Dalmiya and Azharuddin for the function on November 4. This honour will be for Azhars contribution to Indian cricket, the BCCI doesnt see anything wrong in it, Shah had earlier maintained. 

The BCCIs headquarters, for long confined to a small and crowded place in the north stand of Cricket Club of Indias Brabourne Stadium, will now be shifted to the Mumbai Cricket Associations Wankhede Stadium. 

Murgatroyd, though, said ICC had no plans to issue a directive to the BCCI on this issue. It is not a matter of policy for us to dictate anything to our members. After all its a function organised by the BCCI, he said.

 Atwal ends tied 21st 

San Antonio: Showing some aggression, Arjun Atwal rebounded from a horrendous start to finish with a two-under 68 in the final round and bag a creditable tied-21st spot in the Valero Texas Open. 

It was the first top-25 result for Atwal since July when he finished tied-17th at BC Open. 

The Indian, who has been struggling with his putting, made major improvements this week. 

But he began with a bogey and a double bogey on his first two holes. 

From three-over after two holes, he recovered magnificently with seven birdies and two bogeys and ended with a 68 and a total of four-under 276 for the tournament. 

Atwal started on the tenth and dropped three shots on 10th and 11th. But he birdied the 12th, 16th and 17th and turned in even par. On the front nine of the course, he birdied the first, but dropped a shot on second. 

Again he birdied the third only to give it back on fifth. But, he again rebounded with birdies on seventh and eighth. 

Atwal took just 26 putts, but what paid off was his willingness to go for birdies. His total of 17 for the week was the fourth highest, but in his quest he also dropped a quadruple bogey in second round and a double bogey each on first and last days. 

The $36,533 he picked up while finishing tied-21st will help him go up in the money list. Atwal has missed 17 cuts in 28 starts and is fighting hard to save his card for 2007. With a little over $475,000 in earnings, he is 140th and needs to get inside top 125.

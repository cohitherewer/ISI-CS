 Blake makes semis 

Shanghai: James Blake secured a Masters Cup semi-final spot with a win over No. 3-ranked Nikolay Davydenko on Wednesday and a little help from Rafael Nadal. Blake rallied from a set and a break down to beat Davydenko 2-6, 6-4, 7-5, continuing his perfect record against the Russian and at the season-ending championship. 

 The 26-year-old American improved to 4-0 against Davydenko, two days after upsetting No. 2 Nadal in his first appearance at the Masters Cup. 

French Open champion Nadal rebounded from that loss with a 7-6 (7-2), 6-2 win over Tommy Robredo later Wednesday he has never dropped a competitive set against his fellow Spaniard. 

It was Nadals first Masters Cup win. He was forced to withdraw from the 2005 with an injured foot. 

But that was enough for unbeaten Blake, ranked eighth and the last to qualify for the eight-man Masters Cup draw, to be the first assured of a semi-final spot. (AP)

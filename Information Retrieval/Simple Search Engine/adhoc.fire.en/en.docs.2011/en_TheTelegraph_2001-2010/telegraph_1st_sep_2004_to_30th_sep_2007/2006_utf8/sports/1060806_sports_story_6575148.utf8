 Raikkonen grabs pole

 - Two-second penalties for Schumi, Alonso 

 Raikkonen 

Budapest: McLarens Kimi Raikkonen snatched pole position at the Hungarian Grand Prix on Saturday after penalty-hit title contenders Fernando Alonso and Michael Schumacher failed to make the top 10. 

Raikkonen, last years winner in Hungary, seized his second pole in a row in the final seconds to dash Brazilian Felipe Massas hopes of starting at the front for the first time in his Ferrari. 

I think we have a strong race car and I really think that we can win tomorrow, said the Finn, whose last victory was in Japan last October. 

It was his 10th pole position in his 100th Formula One race. Brazilian Rubens Barrichello was third for Honda and Spaniard Pedro de la Rosa fourth in a McLaren. 

Renaults world champion Alonso and Ferraris Schumacher failed to make the final cut after both went into the knockout qualifying with two second penalties to be added to their fastest laps. 

Ferraris seven-time champion Schumacher will start 11th, because Hondas Jenson Button who clocked the fourth best time picked up a 10-place penalty for an engine change in final practice. 

Spaniard Alonso, who took his first win in Hungary in 2003, lines up behind in 15th place at a circuit where overtaking is a real challenge and where four of the last five winners have started on pole. 

Alonso leads Schumacher by 11 points with six races remaining including Sunday. 

Formula One plumbed new depths of farce on Saturday when the leading rivals were penalised for incidents in practice amid claims that this years title race is being rigged by a race-fixing scandal. 

Both Alonso and Schumacher were given two-second penalties to carry in qualifying. Schumacher was penalised for overtaking two cars under a red flag while Alonso picked up his sanction for dangerous driving and ignoring a yellow flag on Friday.

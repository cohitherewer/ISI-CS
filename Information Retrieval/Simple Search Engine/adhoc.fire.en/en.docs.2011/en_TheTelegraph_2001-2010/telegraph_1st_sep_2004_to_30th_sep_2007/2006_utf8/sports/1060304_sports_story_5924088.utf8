 Rathore to be flag bearer

New Delhi: Olympic silver medallist Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore will be Indias flag-bearer at the opening ceremony of the 18th Commonwealth Games that begins in Melbourne on March 15. 

This was announced by Indian Olympic Association president Suresh Kalmadi at a function to send off the first batch of competitors for the quadrennial mega event. Long jumper Anju Bobby George carried the Indian flag at the last edition of the Games. 

The IOA is sending a 270-strong contingent to Melbourne, including 186 athletes and 43 coaches. The large batch assumes significance as New Delhi would host the next edition of the Commonwealth Games in 2010. 

WFI president H J Dora will be the chef-de-mission. 

India would be participating in 10 disciplines ? athletics, badminton, basketball, boxing, gymnastics, mens and womens hockey, shooting, swimming, table tennis and weightlifting. 

India came back with 69 medals from Manchester, comprising 30 gold, 22 silver and 17 bronze. But as the number of medals in weightlifting, in which India bagged 27 medals, has been cut to one-third, it would be a tough challenge to repeat the large haul. 

Meanwhile, Sunil Gavaskar and P. T. Usha will join a host of other sporting legends and personalities from the entertainment world to showcase India at the closing ceremony of the Games. 

A time slot of 15 minutes has been earmarked for India, hosts of the 2010 mega event who will receive the Commonwealth Games flag at the ceremony scheduled for March 26. 

Besides Gavaskar and Usha, other sports personalities who have confirmed their participation are Vijay Amritraj, Milkha Singh, Prakash Padukone, Michael Ferreira, Ajitpal Singh, Khazan Singh and Satpal. (PTI)

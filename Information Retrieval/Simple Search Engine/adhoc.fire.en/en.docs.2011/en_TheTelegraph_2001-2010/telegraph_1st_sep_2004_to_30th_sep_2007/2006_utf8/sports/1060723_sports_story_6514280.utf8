 Late fight not enough for Kapur to make cut

 - BRITISH OPEN 

 - I learnt it the hard way

Hoylake: A late fight did not prove enough as Indias Shiv Kapur missed the cut in his first major at the British Open golf tournament after carding one-over 73 in the second round at the Royal Liverpool Course here. 

Kapur missed the halfway cut by two strokes despite a courageous attempt which saw him birdie two of his closing three holes. It was so near and yet so far, said Kapur after his bid to make the cut ended in disappointment despite a superb birdie on the last hole on Friday. 

Standing on the last tee, Kapur realised he needed to eagle the 18th to have any chance of staying on for the weekend. 

He hit a brilliant second shot, a three wood from 260 yards, and came within 18 feet of the pin. And then the putt, a near-perfect one stopped inches short leaving him only a tap-in for a birdie which was not enough.This is a game of inches and I learnt it the hard way today, he said. 

The consolation, if any, was that even an eagle would have helped him as Vaughn Taylor, playing in Kapurs three-ball, and Andrew Marshall two groups behind him, birdied the last hole and pulled the cut up from even to one-under, leaving another 12 players high and dry and even par for 36 holes. 

Im just learning and Im basically a baby in the world of golf. I was trying my heart out. When youre in a major, youre giving 150 per cent. I grinded on every single shot, Kapur said, trying to shrug aside the disappointment. 

The cut was the lowest since one-under at St Andrews in 1990 and since that the cutline has always been even or over par. 

Kapur found himself on the wayside along with some big names like Vijai Singh (70, 76), Colin Montgomerie (73, 75), John Daly (72, 73), Stuart Appleby (74, 72), K. J. Choi (72, 74) and legends Nick Faldo (77, 71) and Seve Ballesteros (74, 77). 

Kapur, the winner of Volvo Masters of Asia and Rookie of the Year on Asian Tour in 2005, was candid enough to admit that he had left himself too much to do towards the end. 

I thought it (cut) would be even par or one-under but, I blew my chances with those bogeys at 14 and 15, he said. 

I hit a horrendous shot on 14 and didnt have a chance to get up and down and on 15, I should have saved par there from the bunker. That putt basically killed my chances. 

I just played badly. I hit the ball terribly, I wasnt driving well and wasnt comfortable with the driver and hit many wayward shots. Maybe, I did not deserve to make the cut. 

Kapur, who next week plays the Deutsche Bank Players Championships of Europe, said he never gave up in the tournament and it was a good experience. It was a good experience and I enjoyed it. I know I have the game that I shouldnt be sitting out the weekend and thats disappointing. Even though it was my first major, I wanted to do well. I was inches away from playing in the weekend and now Im not. Its the worst feeling in the world. 

There were quite a few small misses, which in the end all added up and saw Kapur crash out of weekend action. Yet, the positive was that he fought right till the end. 

Maybe one of the big positives was that I just did not give up. I just fought till the end, said Kapur, who on many occasions made some brilliant saves for par. 

I was proud of some of clutch shots from bunker or rough and saved pars. But what I needed was birdies and missed my chances. 

A birdie chance on par-five fifth, and then the missed par putt on sixth from less than 18 inches, from where the ball spun out, turned out to be the costliest mistakes for Kapur. 

On the sixth, I tried to hit it too firm. I dont know what happened. You cant do those things in major championships, said Kapur. 

Kapur started the day at even par and saved a terrific par on second, just as he had on the first on first day. 

Then came two more pars and a missed birdie putt which he pushed right from less than five feet on fifth. A missed putt from one and a half feet led to a bogey on sixth. On the par-three ninth, he dropped another when the putt slid past after coming out very well from the bunker. He turned in two over and still had no birdies to show for the day. 

On the back nine, he did well to birdie the tenth despite being in the left rough. Three more pars followed and then there was the action-packed finish. He dropped crucial shots on 14th and 15th, after hitting bad drives and then he was up against the wall. 

Like the first day, he birdied the 16th and 18th and on the latter, he very nearly eagled. At the start of the day I was even par for the round and thought it would be that or one-under. It plays on everyones mind. Every player on the bubble would think of the cut and obviously I was, said Kapur. 

It (the course) was a few shots harder today. I got the bad end of the draw. This morning was perfect conditions and when I got on the tee, the wind picked up. Thats what you get when youre a qualifier. If youre top-10 in the world, you get the best draw, so the aim is to get there, he added. (PTI)

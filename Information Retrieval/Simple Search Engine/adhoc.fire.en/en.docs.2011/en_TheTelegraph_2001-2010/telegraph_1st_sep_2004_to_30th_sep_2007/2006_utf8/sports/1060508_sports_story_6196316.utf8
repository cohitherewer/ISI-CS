 Louisville: Unbeaten Barbaro 

 unveiled serious Triple Crown potential by roaring to a 

 61/2-length victory in the Kentucky Derby on Saturday.

 Kentucky-bred Barbaro, under the guidance of jockey Edgar Prado, took the lead Just before the quarter pole and drew away from the rest in the 20-strongfield to stroll home in 2 minutes 1.36 seconds. Bluegrass Cat finished second, while Steppenwolfer grabbed the show spot.

 Barbaro, the winner of the Florida Derby on April 1, has now won all six of his starts and will be shipped to Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore for the Preakness Stakes in two weeks. The three-year-old colt by Dynaformer out of LaVille Rouge stumbled slightly at the start but recovered nicely and stalked the front-runners before grabbing the lead as he approached the stretch. When I turned him loose, he just took off like a rocket, said Prado, a Derby winner for the first time in six starts. Michael Matz, 55, becomes the fourth straight trainer to claim the Derby on his first attempt.

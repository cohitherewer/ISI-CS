 Uefa extends Italy deadline

Geneva: Uefa has extended the deadline for the submission of the names of Italian clubs eligible to take part in the 2006-07 European club competitions until Wednesday. 

European soccers governing body said in a statement issued from their headquarters at Nyon on Tuesday that it had received a letter from the Italian FA (FIGC) asking Uefa for an extension of one day from Tuesdays original deadline. 

After having carefully analysed the request, Uefas Emergency Panel decided to grant the requested extraordinary extension of the deadline, Uefa said in a statement. 

The revised deadline is therefore Wednesday July 26, 2006. 

The names of the Italian clubs are required by Uefa before the seedings can be completed for Fridays draws in Nyon for the Champions League third qualifying round and Uefa Cup second qualifying round.

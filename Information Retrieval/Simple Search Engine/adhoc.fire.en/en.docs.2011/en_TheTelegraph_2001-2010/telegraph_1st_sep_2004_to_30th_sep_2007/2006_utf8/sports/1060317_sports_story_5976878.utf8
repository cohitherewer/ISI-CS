The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Sponsors happy, no joy for players

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Women's Hockey

 New Delhi: Sponsors appear 

 to be more important to the Indian Women Hockey Federation 

 (IWHF) than the players. In an attempt to keep the sponsors 

 happy, the IWHF has decided to hold the National Championship 

 in New Delhi from March 23 to 31, heedless of the fact that 

 it might turn out to be an exercise too tiring and stressful 

 for the players.

 The womens hockey team is 

 currently in Melbourne for the Commonwealth Games and are 

 not expected to return before March 27. Yet, the IWHF has 

 announced the schedule only because its sponsors want to 

 finish off the tournament before the end of the current 

 fiscal. Our sponsors, NTPC wanted the Nationals to 

 be over before March 31, said IWHF secretary before 

 leaving for Melbourne. We had no other option, 

 she said.

 Out of the 14 teams taking part 

 in the Nationals, joint defending champions Railways face 

 the biggest problem. Fifteen Railways players are with the 

 national squad in Melbourne, and they are scheduled to play 

 their first match on March 28.

 Ashok Dewan, who guarded Indias 

 citadel during the historic World Cup triumph in Kuala Lumpur 

 in 1975 and presently is in-charge of hockey in Railways, 

 said it was a strange situation. We havent been 

 given the schedule officially, but have come to know about 

 it from other sources, he said.

 How can my girls play on 

 March 28 if they arrive here on March 27 after such a long 

 journey from Melbourne. And then they are expected to play 

 at least three matches in the next four days. It will be 

 physically too tiring, Dewan said.

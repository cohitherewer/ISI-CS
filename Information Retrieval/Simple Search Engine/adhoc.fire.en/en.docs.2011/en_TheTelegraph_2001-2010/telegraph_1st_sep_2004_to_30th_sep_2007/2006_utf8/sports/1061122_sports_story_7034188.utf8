 Dravid backs batsmen against pace

 Durban: Weighed down by the teams dismal performances of late, Indian captain Rahul Dravid on Tuesday reminded his key players that at least five or six of them have to fire collectively to be able to beat a strong team like South Africa. 

Dravid said strong teams were not beaten by the performance of one or two players and it was imperative for the entire team to play as a unit. 

You expect five or six critical players to perform well all the time, especially against good teams. Such teams are not beaten by one or two performances, Dravid said on the eve of the second one-dayer at the Kingsmead. 

The Indian batting has been under weather in recent times but even in the best of their form, consistency is something which has eluded most with the possible exception of Dravid himself. 

In the past, when we were winning, you would see different people win Man-of-the-Match awards. That was good. In the room you could find seven or eight players who could produce results. 

The captain reiterated that it was wrong to presume that Indian batsmen could not cope with the pace and bounce of South African wickets. 

Every time India travel you hear these things and every time South Africa travel to India you hear about how they cant play spin bowling. Each team has its strengths and weaknesses and the challenge is to play well in conditions which are not similar to those you have at home. 

Dravid was also pleased to see Sachin Tendulkar turning his arm over in the nets. 

Sachin is bowling 40-50 balls in nets which is good. We expect him to bowl at some stage and by the time the World Cup is around he should be able to bowl 10 overs if required. 

Meanwhile, coach Greg Chappell promised fans back home a higher level of performance that would make them happy. 

Nobody likes being criticised and we are no different, and the boys are keen to perform to a level which would make the press and the fans back home happy, Chappell said on Tuesday. 

Chappells counterpart Micky Arthur, however, sought to put the beleaguered Indians on the backfoot ahead of the second ODI, saying his bowlers were ready to unleash a good diet of pace and bounce at the visiting batsmen. 

Arthur said his team had worked out a strategy for the Indian batsmen who would be tested in these conditions. 

When we go to India, we are tried and tested against the spin. Now that they are here, they should expect to receive fast and bouncy pitches. 

Arthur also promised a hot reception for Mahendra Singh Dhoni in the series. He has done fantastically for himself but I dont think he has been tested outside the subcontinent enough. It would be interesting to see if he could get through in these conditions. We surely would test him. I hope he is good against the short-ball, he said. 

Arthur said it was difficult not to feel that his side would start favourites in this series. We are number two in the world and I do feel we deserve to be in that position. It is difficult not to rate us as favourites.

 Ronaldo looking to silence critics

 - Ive faced challenges in my career... Im strong enough to overcome them 

 Ronaldo

 Sao Paulo: Ronaldo approaches 

 the 2006 World Cup in one of the worst slumps of his career. 

 Fans have been jeering him and commentators have been criticising 

 him. Even the great Pele has hit out at him. But as far 

 as Ronaldo is concerned, everything is just fine.

 Ive been faced with 

 tough challenges my entire career, he said. But 

 now I know that Im strong enough to overcome them. 

 Im certain that Ill be well prepared for the 

 World Cup.

 Ronaldo was going through a similar 

 slump before the 2002 World Cup because of a serious knee 

 injury that nearly ended his career. Many doubted he would 

 play at a high level again, but he recovered quite nicely 

 ? as the key player in Brazils run to win a fifth 

 title in Japan and South Korea.

 Four years later, as Brazil goes 

 for their second consecutive championship, Ronaldo is dealing 

 with the same type of criticism.The striker has become an 

 easy target after an injury-plagued season in which he scored 

 only five goals in Real Madrids first 19 matches. 

 Former France star Michel Platini 

 recently said Ronaldo has too many years and 

 is carrying too many kilos. Pele suggested Ronaldos 

 career was being affected by off-field problems, including 

 a divorce last year barely three months after being married 

 to a Brazilian model and television hostess.

 The 29-year-old was struck hard 

 by the criticism ? to the point of calling Pele a cheap 

 opportunist and considering leaving Real Madrid ? 

 but he insisted it would not affect his play in Germany. 

 The World Cup is my greatest motivation, Ronaldo 

 said. Im not going to worry about what the critics 

 are talking about me, I dont need that.

 Ronaldo isnt the only one 

 thinking he can rebound in the 2006 tournament. Some of 

 those supporting the strikerinclude former star players 

 Romario and Diego Maradona, and even Brazilian president 

 Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.

 Ronaldo is one of the best 

 players in the world and doesnt need to prove anything 

 to anybody, said his teammate Ronaldinho. 

 Brazil coach Carlos Alberto Parreira 

 is another unconditional backer of Ronaldo. Ronaldo 

 still is one of the greatest strikers in the world, 

 he said recently. He will be ready to play in the 

 World Cup. 

 Most Brazilian fans remain behind 

 Ronaldo, as well. And theres plenty of reason for 

 that, because Ronaldos numbers with Brazil are more 

 than impressive:

 In 97 matches with Ronaldo on the field, Brazil have 

 lost only eight times.

 He is the nations greatest scorer in World 

 Cups with 12 goals, tied with Pele.

 Three goals in Germany would make Ronaldo the tournaments 

 leading scorer. He has two goals less than Gerd Muller 

 of Germany and one less than Just Fontaine of France.

 Ronaldo also could equal Peles feat as a three-time 

 World Cup winner. Despite being only 17, he was a member 

 of Brazils team that, led by Romario, won the 1994 

 World Cup in the US.

 Ronaldos latest injury isnt 

 nearly as serious. A muscle ailment during Spanish league 

 play kept him sidelined for most of April. But Parreira 

 already has guaranteed his spot on the roster for Germany.

 Ronaldos place in the starting 

 line-up is not as secure, however. He faces strong competition 

 from several countrymen, including Adriano and Robinho. 

 I just want Brazil to win the title, Ronaldo 

 said. Everything else doesnt matter as much.

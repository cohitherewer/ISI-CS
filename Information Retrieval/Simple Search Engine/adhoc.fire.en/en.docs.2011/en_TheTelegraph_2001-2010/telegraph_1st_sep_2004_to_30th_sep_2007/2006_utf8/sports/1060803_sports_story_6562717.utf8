Beverly Hills: Germany midfielder Michael Ballack, sporting a close-cropped haircut and smiling readily, was officially presented to the media with his No. 13 Chelsea shirt on Tuesday. 

The 29-year-old, who joined the English champions in May on a three-year contract, says he is ready for the challenge of the Premier League and is happy to play anywhere in the team. 

Ballack is expected to be rotated in the Chelsea line-up with Ghanas Michael Essien in a three-man midfield featuring top goalscorer Frank Lampard and Frenchman Claude Makelele in the holding role. 

It doesnt really matter where he (Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho) puts me in the team because we all want to succeed, Ballack told a news conference at the Beverly Hills Hotel. 

I am happy to fit in with whatever is best for the team. 

Chelsea know about my strengths, thats why they picked me. Theres great competition in the midfield and Ill just have to do my best. 

The Germany captain, who signed for Chelsea as a free agent from Bayern Munich where he was the leading player, is unfazed about moving to a team loaded with big names. 

I dont mind being less of a leader with Chelsea because Im part of a greater team, said Ballack, who has spent the last two days training with the English club at the University of California Los Angeles. 

You can see that with a bigger team like Brazil who have a lot of stars but focus on playing together as a team, rather than on one star. 

The three-time German Footballer of the Year played down any suggestion of a friendly rivalry with Lampard over their respective goal-scoring from the midfield. 

We want to be successful and we dont want to compete with each other, he said. I think Frank is a great player and, just like any other team Ive been on, I really enjoy playing with other players. 

Ballack, who was approached by Manchester United before he decided moving to Chelsea, is looking forward to the challenge of the next three years in England. 

Its a big change for me to move to a foreign country to play in the Premier League for the first time but I was looking for a challenge, he said. I am really excited about it. 

Winning the Champions League is definitely one of my goals but its not the only one. I want to focus on every match I play for Chelsea.

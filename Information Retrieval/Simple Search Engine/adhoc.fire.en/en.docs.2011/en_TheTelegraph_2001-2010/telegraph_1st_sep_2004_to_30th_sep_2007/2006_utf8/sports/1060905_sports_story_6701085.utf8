 Raghunath gets nod

 - Sandeep replacement

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: After days of uncertainty, the Indian team management in Germany has finally decided to include Karnataka drag-flicker Raghunath for the hockey World Cup beginning on Wednesday. 

Speaking to The Telegraph, IHF secretary K Jyothikumaran said: Raghunath has been selected by coach Baskaran ahead of the other two Vikramjit Singh and Jugraj Singh. 

The IHF secretary also said Vikramjit and Jugraj will be sent back to India soon. 

Given the fact that Raghunath was the overwhelming favourite to replace Sandeep Singh, who received a bullet wound during a train journey to Delhi, the IHF could have announced the Karnataka youngsters name long back. 

The team management, it was believed, did not have much confidence in Jugraj, and Vikramjit was considered too novice to play on the big stage. 

Raghunaths selection, Jyothikumaran said, was okayed following his performance against Japan in a friendly on Sunday. Raghunath, part of the SAF Games squad, could not play the earlier friendlies against a German club team and Belgium as he had arrived late.

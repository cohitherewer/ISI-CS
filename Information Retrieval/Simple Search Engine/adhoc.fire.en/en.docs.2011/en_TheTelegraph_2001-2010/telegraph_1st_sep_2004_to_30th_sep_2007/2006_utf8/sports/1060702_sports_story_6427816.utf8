The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 A team man to the core

 My Pick of the week / PK Banerjee

 Player No.1: Miroslav 

 Klose

For a change, it wasnt a 

 difficult choice. Miroslav Klose stood out with two eye-catching 

 performances in the knockout stage and gets my vote for 

 the player of the week. 

 The week under consideration saw 

 the second-round matches as well as the first set of quarter 

 finals. Against Sweden, Germany sealed the issue with two 

 goals in the first quarter of an hour. Podolski was credited 

 with a brace, but none of the goals would have materialised 

 without Kloses assistance. 

 The big man came through as an 

 unselfish striker who had Germanys welfare at heart 

 first and foremost, not personal deeds. Klose, already perched 

 atop the scorers list with four strikes in the group 

 league stage, could have been forgiven for being over-enthusiastic 

 in trying to add to his tally. But he chose to be the provider 

 for his young strike partner Podolski. Klose showed he was 

 a team man to the core. Klinsmann couldnt have bargained 

 for better qualities in his numero uno striker. 

 In the tough quarter final against 

 Argentina, with the team down by a goal till 80 minutes, 

 Klose rose to the occasion when the likes of Ballack and 

 Podolski failed to find the equaliser. A Ballack centre 

 was headed forward by Borowski and Klose was in position 

 to redirect the ball into the far corner of the Argentine 

 goal with an accurate, angular header. 

 Klose plays in the Bundesliga 

 for a one-too-glamorous side, Werder Bremen. He obviously 

 doesnt crave for the spotlight which the likes of 

 Ballack and Lehmann enjoy. But that doesnt undermine 

 Kloses importance. 

 Blessed with an enviable aerial 

 ability, Klose is equally adept with his right foot. Add 

 his distribution skill and a knack to fall back to aid his 

 defence at crunch times, and you know why Klose is a vital 

 cog in the German wheel. 

 Of course, morning didnt 

 show the day. Born in a small town of Poland, Klose took 

 to football at the relatively late age of nine after shifting 

 to Germany with his parents. And it took him a long time 

 to get a foothold in the game. Having struggled at the amateur 

 level for four-five seasons, Klose got his first professional 

 breakthrough at the age of 22. 

 His first professional goal was 

 netted in October 2000. Thereafter, there was no stopping 

 Klose. In early 2001, Voeller called him to the national 

 squad and a year later, he was not only in the World Cup 

 squad but challenged Ronaldo in the race to the Golden Boot 

 award. 

 Hes at it again, in Germanys 

 home World Cup. He may win his personal battle 

 this time with Ronaldo, or he may not. But with 10 goals 

 already under his belt with a possible two games left in 

 this World Cup, Klose is surely breathing down Gerd Mueller 

 and Ronaldos neck. 

 I see the German adding one or 

 two more in the next few days. And if he can remain fit 

 and healthy till 2010, Klose should erase Ronaldos 

 record from the books.

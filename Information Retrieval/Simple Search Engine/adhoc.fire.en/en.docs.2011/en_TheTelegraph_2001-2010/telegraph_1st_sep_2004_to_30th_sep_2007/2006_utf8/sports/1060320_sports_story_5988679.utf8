 Atwal misses cut

Miami: Daniel Chopra shot a three-under 69 with four birdies and one bogey on the third day to move to the 30th spot in the Bay Hill Invitational golf tournament. 

Chopra, who has been having a good season, birdied fourth, ninth, 16th and 17th holes and dropped a shot on the fifth. His first two rounds were 71 and 72. 

Arjun Atwal, meanwhile, shot his worst round on the PGA Tour with a 12-over 84 in second round that led to him missing another cut this year. He shot seven bogeys, one double and one triple on a horrendous day. 

Australias Rod Pampling moved into the lead after the third round after a steady five-under 67, while four-time winner Tiger Woods slipped out of contention. (PTI)

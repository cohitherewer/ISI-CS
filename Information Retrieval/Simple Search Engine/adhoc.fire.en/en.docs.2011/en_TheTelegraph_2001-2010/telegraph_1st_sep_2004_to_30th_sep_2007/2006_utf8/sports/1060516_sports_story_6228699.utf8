 AIFFs sketchy list in search of the Dhorasoos 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: India will never get a chance to adopt and field a talented midfielder like Vikash Dhorasoo, but the All India Football Federation (AIFF) is in the process of identifying players of Indian origin in an attempt to lift the standard of the national team. 

Pakistan Football Federation has already done so as it has included players like Zesh Rehman ? Pakistans first England-born player and Adnan Ahmed, the only Asian football player in the English League Division I. 

AIFF general secretary Alberto Colaco also prepared what he called a sketchy list of footballers of Indian origin, who could strengthen the Indian squad. 

Michael Chopra (Newcastle United), Harpal Singh (Stockport County), Lelee Green (Portsmouth Youth) and Kiran Bechan (Ajax Amsterdam Juniors) are among the four players who figure in the AIFFs list. Except for Green, who is in regular touch with the AIFF, no official contact is yet being established with the others. 

We are still in the process of identifying the players. We need someone who can monitor the progress of these players on a regular basis, Colaco said. 

Our former national coach Stephen Constantine was keeping a tab on the players, but somehow things did not materialise. We hope something positive will come out in the near future, the AIFF secretary said. 

Incidentally, Chopra (England) and Bechan (The Netherlands) have already played for their representative countries at junior competitions, but new Fifa guidelines enable them to do duty for the country of their origin. 

According to the guidelines, players who have played with a national team right up to junior and under-21 level can still play for their country of origin, if they so wish.

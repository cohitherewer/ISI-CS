 Shiv Kapur at tied 18th spot

 Asian Open

 Shanghai: Shiv Kapur carded 

 a one-under 71 and was the highest placed Indian at tied 

 18th place after the first round of the $1.8 million BMW 

 Asian Open here on Thursday.

 Winner of Volvo China Open last 

 week, Jeev Milkha Singh (72) began well with a flawless 

 two-under on the first nine but then lost his touch and 

 was tied for 35th.

 Kapur, playing in the company 

 of leader Henrik Stenson, impressed the world No. 15 with 

 his play but was himself disappointed with his score of 

 five birdies and four bogeys. 

 He is in the bunch of 17 players 

 at the lovely and resplendent Tomson Shanghai Pudong Golf 

 Club.

 Kapur was four behind leader Henrik 

 Stenson, who also had only five birdies, but only one bogey 

 on the third, where the Indian, too, dropped a shot.

 Behind sole leader Stenson were 

 Frenchman Jean van de Welde and Scotsman Stephen Gallacher, 

 while Montgomerie had a bogey finish, including a visit 

 into the water, for a 69, where he was tied for fourth with 

 six others. 

 With him at 69 were Thomas Bjorn, 

 Peter Lawrie, Marcus Fraser and Filipino Frankie Minoza 

 and Korean Charlie Wi, the two best Asians in the field.

 It was not a very good day for 

 other Indians, as Amandeep Johl not only went three-over 

 for the day, but was also left without his wife and caddie, 

 Hardavin, for the rest of the week.

 She was hit hard on the left hand 

 by a shank from a fellow player and had to be taken to a 

 hospital for an X-ray, which fortunately revealed no breakage. 

 Johl had just one birdie on the 

 16th and four bogeys and was tied 91st.

 Gaurav Ghei (76 and tied 110th), 

 Rahil Gangjee (77 and tied 126th) and Harmeet Kahlon (78 

 and 137th) were all left with a lot of catching up to do 

 in the second round to make the cut. (PTI)

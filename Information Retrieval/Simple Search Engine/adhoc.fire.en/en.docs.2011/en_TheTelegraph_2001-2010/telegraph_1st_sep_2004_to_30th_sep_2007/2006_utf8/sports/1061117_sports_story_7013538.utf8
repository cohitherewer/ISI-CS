The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Defeat pushes Md. Sp. into a tight corner

 - Even a win now may not help Bhowmicks team 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Noel Wilsons good work went in vain 

New Delhi: Mohammedan Sportings Durand Cup campaign kicked off on a disastrous note on Thursday as they went down 1-2 to Air India in group A pre-quarter-final league action. It virtually ended the Calcutta outfits hope of making the last eight. 

Even a win on Friday, against Assam Rifles, wont be enough for Mohammedan Sporting as Air India need only a draw against the same opposition to qualify for the quarter-final league from the three-team group. 

The toppers will join Mahindra United, Mohun Bagan and Sporting Clube de Goa in group I of the quarter final league. 

Mohammedan coach Subhas Bhowmick was naturally a disappointed man. Even without a foreign player, Mohammedan Sporting dished out attacking football, but poor defensive work cost them. 

Defensive lapses let us down, said Bhowmick. We played good football, yet had to lose. Absence of foreign players made a lot of difference. 

Mohammedan Sporting went one-up in the fourth minute. Bijen Singh received the ball on the right of the Air India box and quickly back-passed for Noel Wilson. The long-haired midfielder, who had a good day in office, fired a right-footer into the net. 

Air India regrouped well and raided the rival area a couple of times. Mohammedan Sporting, too, had a chance, but Harbinder Singh faltered at the goalmouth. 

In the 39th minute, Air Indias Noel Fernandes found the equaliser with a little help from the opposition. There was ample time for the Mohammedan Sporting defenders to clear the long throw from Uttam Singh when it dropped inside the box, yet they allowed Fernandes to score with a bicycle kick. 

Ultimately, it was Mohammedan Sporting who conceded yet another avoidable goal. No doubt, Nigerian Bashiru Abbas fine spot jump produced a strong header in the 82nd minute, but the Mohammedan Sporting defence had left him unmarked when the cross from Zaheer Abbas floated into the box.

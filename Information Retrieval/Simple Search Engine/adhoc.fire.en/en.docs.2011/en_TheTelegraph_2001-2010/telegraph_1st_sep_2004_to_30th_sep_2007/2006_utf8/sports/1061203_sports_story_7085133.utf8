 Sourav is like any other player: Sehwag

Johannesburg: Stand-in captain Virender Sehwag feels Sourav Gangulys good record in South Africa must have influenced the selectors while picking him for the Test series. 

He is like any other player in the side. But he has a wealth of experience and has done well in South Africa before So it must have influenced the selectors decision, Sehwag said after the six-wicket win in the Twenty20 international at the Wanderers Friday. 

Sehwag hoped the good luck charm of Centurion as well as the win from the Twenty20 game would help the team turn around its fortunes. Centurion has been the lucky ground for us. We will carry the confidence from the Twenty20 win and try to turn the tables on the hosts on Sunday. 

The Delhi batsman took great heart from the penultimate-ball win over South Africa and made light of the observation that the hosts were without any of their regular bowlers. As far as I am concerned, we were playing against South Africa and we have beaten them, he said. 

The Indian opener did not feel it was right to suggest that juniors like Dinesh Mongia and Dinesh Karthik had stolen a march over the seniors. 

Sehwag, who has been stripped of vice-captaincy, did not appear concerned by it. Its a selectors decision and I accept it. As far as I am concerned it is not a worry for me.

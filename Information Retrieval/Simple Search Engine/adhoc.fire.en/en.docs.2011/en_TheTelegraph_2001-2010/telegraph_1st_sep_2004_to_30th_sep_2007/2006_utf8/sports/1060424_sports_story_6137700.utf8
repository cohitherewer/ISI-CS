 Couple gives new twist to meet 

London: A British couple gave a new twist to the idea of running away together by competing on Sunday in the London Marathon in their wedding clothes and getting married halfway around the course. 

Katie Austin and Gordon Fryer from Romsey in southern England ran the race with the brides parents who gave her away at the ceremony in the Bridge Masters dining room on Tower Bridge. 

The groom and his father-in-law wore traditional waistcoats, wing-collared shirts and cravats, but with long shorts instead of trousers. 

The bride wore a full-length ivory wedding dress with train above her running shoes ? an outfit she conceded she had never run in before. 

Despite rain, the bride arrived at the Bridge with her make-up and hair still in place. (AFP)

 Divo to lip official World Cup song

Frankfurt: Vocal quartet Il Divo will perform the World Cups official song, Time of Our Lives, Fifa announced on Tuesday. 

The international chart toppers, who boast on their website to have brought opera to the masses, will perform the song before the opening match between hosts Germany and Costa Rica in Munich on June 9. 

The World Cup also has an official anthem, Celebrate the Day, which will be sung by German performer Herbert Groenemeyer in various languages. 

The official song of the 2002 World Cup in Japan and South Korea was Boom by Anastacia. 

Meanwhile, a leading world soccer official gave German stadiums a strong vote of confidence on Tuesday and played down fears that terrorists would attempt to target this summers World Cup. 

Walter Gagg, director of stadium security for Fifa, said he was more than satisfied with the 12 stadiums that will host the month-long 32-nation tournament, despite a critical report last month from a consumer watchdog. 

We are happy, we have good stadiums here in Germany, they have full security infrastructure, he told a conference in Berlin. He played down the possibility of a terrorist attack on the tournament, saying soccer ? unlike the Olympic Games ? had never fallen victim to such a disaster before. 

Football has never, really never, been sought out by terrorist attacks at this level. We are convinced we wont have any terrorist actions against the soccer World Cup, he said. 

Willy Koesling, a German security official responsible for World Cup preparations, said: Thank God, we have no concrete indications of a particular concrete threat in the area of terrorism, but we cant rule it out. We hope it stays that way. 

The comments came as a special World Cup committee of security officials from the German government and 16 federal states held a meeting to update its planning for the tournament. (Reuters)

Calcutta: The girls took the centrestage in the under 13 category on the second day of the 18th State Age-Group Chess Championship being held at the Bhowanipur Gujarati Education Society here on Saturday. 

After the completion of the third round, Mohona Sengupta and Sukanya Dutta jointly shared the lead with full points. 

The day also witnessed some upsets, as top seed Abhratanu Dutta was held by Shaati Majumder in a long fought game, where both had two minor pieces in the end. 

Fourth seed, Satyajit Kundu, too had to split points with Diptanu Das. 

Earlier in Round II, second seed Bitan Banerjee was held by Dhee Sankar in a Nimzo-Indian defence. Bitan failed to capitalise on the isolated central pawn of Dhee and had to struggle to settle for a draw. Both the players finally agreed to call it a day in 37 moves. 

Prantik Roy checkmated Rudra Pratap Adhikary in a mere 11 moves in the U-11 section, while Samrat Ghorai edged past Abhrapratim Manna in 66 moves in an English opening.

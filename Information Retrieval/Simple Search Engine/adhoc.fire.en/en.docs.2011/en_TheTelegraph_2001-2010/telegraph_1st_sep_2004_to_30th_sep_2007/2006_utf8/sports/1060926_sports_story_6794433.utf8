 Leanders sacrifice for new kid

AMITAVA DAS GUPTA

Mumbai: Heres a poser. Can you figure out who Akash Wagh is? Take a couple of clues hes a tennis player and hes closely involved with the Kingfisher Airlines Open which got underway at the CCI here on Monday. 

Very few knew the name before it was announced two days ago that he was being given the third and final main draw wild card for the inaugural edition of this event. 

Hes all of 16 who has been recently crowned the under-18 national champion. A Pune native, Wagh trained at Gaurav Natekars clinic for a year or so before being selected to join Mahesh Bhupathis Elite academy in Bangalore at the start of this year. 

A teenager who has played in no more than a solitary mens meet at the domestic level, is all set for his ATP debut that too against fourth seed Dmitry Tursunov, the Russian who scalped Andy Roddick to carry his nation to the Davis Cup final on Sunday. 

Obviously, Wagh is being considered as the new kid on the block. But isnt he too raw to be given such an honour? 

Any 16-year-old winning the junior nationals is always special, and this guy is hugely talented, Natekar, the tournament director told The Telegraph. Sometimes, you have to throw talents like these into the deep end of the pool to test their mettle. We wanted to blood him. 

Not surprisingly, a few questions are being asked about Waghs selection. There is another interesting angle to this wild card episode. The organisers (read: Mahesh Bhupathi) wanted Leander Paes to feature in the singles draw and offered him a wild card. Leander was considering it very seriously, but when he heard about this talented boy, he made up his mind not to accept it (wild card) and wanted it to go to Akash, said Natekar. 

Paes has not completely written himself off as a Davis Cup singles player. But the captain in him took over as soon as he heard such high praise of the 16-year-old. 

 Wagh must have reminded him of a March afternoon in 

 Chandigarh some 16 summers ago. Justifying the faith put 

 on a 16-year-old by captain Naresh Kumar, debutant Paes 

 played the key role in a doubles win over Japan to herald 

 a golden chapter in Indian tennis.

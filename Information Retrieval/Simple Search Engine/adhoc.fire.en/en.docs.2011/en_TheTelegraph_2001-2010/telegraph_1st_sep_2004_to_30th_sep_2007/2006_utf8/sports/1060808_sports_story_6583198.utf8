Colombo: Mahela Jayawardene hit an unbeaten 77 to get Sri Lanka within 90 runs of victory in the second Test and a series sweep against South Africa. Set 352 to win, the hosts ended the fourth day at 262 for five on Monday, leaving three sessions and five wickets to get the 90 runs required. 

The Lanka captain shared an unbroken 61-run stand for the sixth wicket with Prasanna Jayawardene, the wicketkeeper-batsman contributing 27 runs. South Africa missed a chance to dismiss Mahela Jayawardene on two when he edged an Andrew Hall delivery to gully. But Herschelle Gibbs, one of the safest fielders in the team, failed to hold the chance. 

It was a major reprieve for Sri Lanka. Jayawardene scored 374 in the first Test last week and shared a world record 624-run partnership with Kumar Sangakkara that laid the foundation for the innings victory. As long as he remains at the crease, Sri Lanka has a chance of winning. 

 South Africa resumed Monday at 257 for seven and added 54 before Mark Bouchers rearguard innings finished at 65. 

Muttiah Muralidharan completed his 56th five-wicket haul when he picked up the last three South African wickets. He finished with seven for 97 in 47 overs and ended with 12 wickets, the 18th time he has taken 10 wickets or more in a Test match. 

Despite losing opening partner Upul Tharanga for a duck, veteran Sanath Jayasuriya started the chase aggressively for Sri Lanka with 73 from 74 balls. 

The 37-year-old hit Pollocks first three balls of his third over for 4, 4, 6 and reached his 30th half-century by hoisting Pollock for another six.

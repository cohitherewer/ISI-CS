 Zimbabwe fall for 152

East London: Pace bowler Shaun Pollock missed a chance to join one of crickets elite clubs in the second one-day International between South Africa and Zimbabwe on Monday. 

Pollock went into the match needing just two more wickets to become the fifth player and the first South African to take 350 wickets in one-day Internationals. 

But, although Zimbabwe were dismissed for only 152 in 49.4 overs, Pollock took just one wicket at a cost of 28 runs. 

Zimbabwes only partnership of substance was the 47 shared by Justice Chibhabha and Elton Chigumbura for the sixth wicket. 

Their rebuilding effort started after Zimbabwe had been reduced to 73 for five in the 22nd over. 

The stand ended when Chigumbura, who faced 65 balls for his 30, lurched down the pitch to a wide delivery from left-arm spinner Robin Peterson and was stumped by wicketkeeper Mark Boucher. 

Chigumburas dismissal proved to be the start of a slide that cost Zimbabwe their last five wickets for 32 runs. 

Chibhabha, who scored his patient 38 off 98 deliveries, Zimbabwes top score, was among the victims when he pulled a delivery from fast bowler Makhaya Ntini and was caught at deep mid-wicket. 

Mediumpacer Andrew Hall took three for 23 from 8.4 overs. The match was originally scheduled to be played on Sunday but was postponed until Monday when rain washed out play.

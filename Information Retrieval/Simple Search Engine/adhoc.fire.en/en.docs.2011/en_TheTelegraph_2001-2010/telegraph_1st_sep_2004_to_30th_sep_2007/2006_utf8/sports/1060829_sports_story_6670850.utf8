 World marks by Jones, Lenton

Hobart: Leisel Jones lowered the 100m breaststroke short course world record for the second time in two days and Libby Lenton set a new 100 butterfly mark as womens records toppled on Monday at the Australian Short Course championships. 

Jones finished in 1:03.86, knocking 0.26 seconds off the record she set in the semi-finals on Sunday night. 

I didnt think I actually had it in me so I just had to psych myself up for it and found something that I probably didnt think I had, Jones said. 

Lenton beat Jessicah Schipper to win the 100 fly in 55.95 seconds, taking 0.39 off the world mark set by American Nathalie Coughlin in 2002. 

Its such a great feeling, such a rush, Lenton said.

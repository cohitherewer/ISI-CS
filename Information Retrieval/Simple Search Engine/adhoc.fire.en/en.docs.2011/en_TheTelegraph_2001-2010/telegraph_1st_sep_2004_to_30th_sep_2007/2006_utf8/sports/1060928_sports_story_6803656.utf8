 Spanish tennis isnt about Nadal 

 - My goal is to be in the top-10 for a long time: Robredo 

OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Tommy Robredo 

Mumbai: Spanish tennis has been one-dimensional ever since a muscular teenager announced his arrival on the big stage two years ago. 

Besides rewriting the record books with an incredible 11 titles (including the French Open) in 2005, Rafael Nadal has the distinction of being the only player with more wins than losses (6-2) over the seemingly invincible Roger Federer. 

A far cry from the vintage days of Carlos Moya when Spaniards dominated the mens game on surfaces other than grass. The 1998 French Open champion was the first from his country to be ranked No. 1 in the world. Juan Carlos Ferrero followed suit. They had other world-beaters too, like Alex Corretja, Albert Costa, Juan Carlos Ferrero, Felix Mantilla. But most of those distinguished names seem to have faded from memory. 

For a country with a rich tradition in the sport, Spain needed someone to hold the flag with Nadal. The transformation of Tommy Robredo from an also-ran to a serious challenger couldnt have come at a better time. 

Having broken into the top-10 recently after living in Nadals shadow for a couple of years, Robredo, though, doesnt agree with the theory that Spain has been going through a lean patch of late. 

I have been in the top 25-30 for four years. Then there are (David) Ferrer, (Fernando) Verdasco, (Feliciano) Lopez, and of course Ferrero, who is getting back the form that took him to world No. 1 in 2003, Robredo told The Telegraph during a one-on-one at the CCI. 

Costa won the French in 2002, Ferrero in 2003. We had three players in the top-20 at the end of last season besides Nadal. Of course hes a special talent, his results have been phenomenal. But that doesnt mean Spanish tennis is about Nadal, Robredo said with a firmness of a man eager to blow away myths. 

So how soon are we going to see Robredo holding aloft the trophy at a major championship? Any tennis player dreams of winning a major. Yeah, I would love to win a Grand Slam soon, but my immediate priority is to qualify for the Masters Cup (in Shanghai) and, more importantly, remain in the top-10 for a long time, said the world No. 7. 

No ambition of reaching the position Roger Federer has made his own? I dont want to look too far ahead. The goal is always to do better than last year. Like if I manage to finish this season at No. 6 or 7, I would want to break into the top-five in 2007. It gets increasingly tough as you move towards the top stair, but thats the challenge for any pro, Robredo remarked. 

Its not often that Robredo gets pride of place in the seedings list, but he points out its an honour he has earned. I am top seed (at this weeks Kingfisher Airlines Open) because I did something good in the past. Thats what you play for you want to improve and win more matches and tournaments, so that your ranking goes up, he said.

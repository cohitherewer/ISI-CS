 Lillee-Marsh boost for English players 

Perth: Australian cricket greats Dennis Lillee and Rod Marsh are encouraging Andrew Flintoff and other leading England players to test themselves in local conditions before the upcoming Ashes series. 

Fast bowler Lillee and wicketkeeper Marsh worked in tandem for Australia in the 1970s and 80s. 

Now Lillee, a former mentor to Australias pace bowlers, and Marsh, who has been head coach at the Australian and English cricket academies, are working for the Western Australia and South Australia State Cricket Associations . 

Lillee backed moves to have Flintoff play club cricket in the western capital Perth. The England allrounder has been ruled out of the northern summer with an ankle injury and is keen to get some match practice before Englands Ashes defence starts in Brisbane in November. 

Lillee said Australians had benefited from playing County cricket in England, and the English players could benefit by playing Down Under making for a highly competitive Ashes series. If they feel like theyd like to come over here and get a bit of practice and learn about the conditions before the series, good luck to them, said Lillee, head of the WACA. (AP)

 Teams forced to feed on AIFF pittance 

 - Santosh Trophy reduced to a second-grade tournament 

JAYDEEP BASU

Faridabad: Last Tuesday, when the Bengal team arrived late at night in this Haryana township to play the Santosh Trophy, they looked more worried about the accommodation than the competition ahead. 

We have been provided with an accommodation that is not worth staying, said Bengal manager Bachchu Gupta next morning. Gupta, however, didnt make an issue of it and quietly went around the city to find a decent hotel for his boys at IFAs cost. 

Bengal could afford it as they have a deeper pocket than most other associations. Most others cannot and they are all staying in the same guest houses that have been earmarked by the organising committee for putting up the teams during the Santosh Trophy. 

However, neither the organisers nor the teams could be blamed for this. Given the structure of allowances the All India Football Federation (AIFF) provides for the Santosh Trophy, most of the state associations find it difficult to make their own arrangements if they refuse the official hospitality. For the organisers, too, it is not always easy to make top class arrangements for all 32 state teams. 

Under the AIFF rules, the teams are eligible to a daily allowance of only Rs 350 per player if they wish to make their own arrangements. In Ranji Trophy, the national championship for cricket, the BCCI gives a daily allowance of Rs 4,000 per day for a player. 

On paper, the federation attaches a lot of importance to the national championship and terms it as the key platform for talent searching. In reality, Santosh Trophy has been reduced to a second-grade tournament. 

While in the National Football League, the teams are allowed to travel either by air or by air conditioned sleeper class, in Santosh Trophy the teams are only given ordinary second class fare, that too, on a concessional basis. In NFL, the daily allowance of a footballer is more than Rs 1,000. 

The AIFF terms and conditions for participation in various age-group national championships are even worse as the budding juniors are expected to find a square meal a day and manage the accommodation for Rs 170 per day. 

Syed Nasir Ali, an executive committee member of the AIFF and the venue in-charge here, admitted that the allowances are low. Previously it was even worse. Now there are proposals to increase it. Hopefully, it will be better in future.

 Real soccer kicks off today

 THE 

 KEY MEN

 GERMANY 

 Miroslav Klose 

A prolific goal-getter, Klose is currently the top scorer in the World Cup and could be the main threat to the Argentine defence. Regarded as one of the best headers of the game despite his slender frame, Klose combines a natural killer instinct inside the box with excellent technical ability, and is equally lethal with the ball at his feet. He also played a major part in Germanys 2-0 win over Sweden in the first knockout round, setting up strike partner Lukas Podolski for both the goals. At the moment with nine goals, Klose, 28, is a potential all-time World Cup top scorer. 

 Michael Ballack 

After struggling with injury during the group stage, Ballack signalled his arrival against Sweden to take charge of German attack. Known for his opportunistic strikes and quick long rangers that surprise one and all under the bar, the undoubted talisman of the German team has the ability to send the Argentine defence the wrong way. In 2002, he provided much of the inspiration in Germanys run to the final with three goals but missed the showdown with Brazil due to suspension. This time, the German skipper will surely give his all to lift the trophy on home soil. 

 ARGENTINA 

 Juan Pablo Sorin 

The Argentine skipper made his debut for the senior national side against Bulgaria in 1995 on Valentines Day, but has very little love for strikers all over the world. Though not as glamorous as his other celebrated colleagues, this tireless attacking left-back has become one of the leaders of the Argentine team in recent years. Affectionately known as Juampi to his friends, Sorin is known for his eye-catching displays in central defence. An avid reader in his free time, Sorin, who once used to host a radio programme dedicated to music and politics, has the ability to blunt the three-prong German attack. 

 Juan Roman Riquelme 

 If Argentina are one of the favourites to win the 

 World Cup, it is mainly because of Riquelme. In every match, 

 he provided excellent playmaking skills, which created a 

 perfect backbone for the Argentines to romp home. Once described 

 by the then Barcelona coach Louis van Gaal as a political 

 signing, Riquelme is today regarded as an extremely 

 talented playmaker with terrific creative vision and close 

 ball control. Riquelme is sometimes accused of not having 

 much pace, but he has turned it into a positive asset, often 

 decreasing the tempo of the game in his teams favour 

 while still retaining the possession.

 ITALY 

 Gianluigi Buffon 

 Gianluigi Gigi Buffon 

 is presently the worlds highest paid goalkeeper and 

 he richly deserves every cent of it. Having gone to Juventus 

 from Parma on a world record transfer fee of ?33 million, 

 Buffon is characterised by great bravery both in his statements 

 and as while smothering the ball at the feet of onrushing 

 players. Born to a sporting family and a nephew of former 

 Milan and Italy goalkeeper Lorenzo Buffon, Gigi was at his 

 best against Australia in the second round, making some 

 spectacular saves in Italys hard-fought 1-0 win and 

 could be a stumbling block to Ukraines aspirations.

 Luca Toni 

 A natural goal scorer, Luca Toni could be Marcello 

 Lippis trump card in this World Cup. Strong and crafty, 

 Toni doesnt possess electrifying pace, but has an 

 incredible goal-scoring instinct that has made him the most 

 lethal striker in the world today. Having scored 31 goals 

 in Serie A for Fiorentina, who paid Palermo 10 million euros 

 for his transfer, Toni has bagged the European Golden Shoe 

 award for the continents top marksman last season. 

 He has also established himself as the teams main 

 goal-scorer, scoring four goals in the qualifying round, 

 including a hattrick against Belarus last September.

 UKRAINE 

 Andriy Shevchenko 

 Adelightful striker, Andriy Mykolayovych Shevchenko, 

 nicknamed Sheva, is the backbone of Ukraine 

 and is expected to carry the teams fortune on his 

 shoulders. His loss of form in the defeat against Spain 

 became a worrying factor, but he came back strongly to guide 

 Ukraine to the last eight. The winner of European Footballer 

 of the Year in 2004 for AC Milan, Shevchenko was a competitive 

 boxer at an early age in the Ukrainian junior circuit before 

 switching to football. In 67 matches for Ukraine, Shevchenko 

 has scored 31 goals and no one knows the weakness of the 

 Italian defence more than him.

 Oleksander Shovkovsky 

After saving two penalty kicks against Switzerland, the Ukraine goalkeeper should be at the top of his confidence and would like to extend his record of not conceding a goal for 300 minutes in this World Cup. In the qualifiers, Shovkovsky did not concede a goal for six straight matches between October 2004 and September 2005. At 31, Shovkovsky says that he is not yet at the peak of his power. A veteran in the circuit since 1993 and widely known as a big-match player, Shovkovsky is likely to give his best against Italy, which may make him a part of soccer folklore.

 Blisters force Ronaldo off

Geneva: Brazil striker Ronaldo was forced off midway through Sundays 4-0 World Cup warm-up win over New Zealand (as reported in Mondays Late City edition) because of blisters on his feet. 

There were three or four on my left foot and two on the right, he said. I couldnt go on. One of them was raw flesh. We tried to put on some more protection and a powder but there wasnt enough time. 

Coach Carlos Alberto Parreira said it was a minor injury and told the media not to make a big issue out of it. 

We tried to do something at half-time but it continued to bother him and the doctor decided the best thing to do was to rest, he said. 

Please dont make a seven-headed animal out of this... its not a big issue. It will be alright in 48 hours. 

Ronaldo, who has not played a competitive game since limping out of Real Madrids 1-1 draw with Real Sociedad on April 8, netted the opening goal for the world champions two minutes before half-time. (AGENCIES)

 The imperious class of Kaiser

Berlin: Outstanding vision and a steely resilience cloaked in velvety footballing skills were Franz Beckenbauers hallmarks during a distinguished career at the heart of successive German teams. 

A veteran of three World Cups, the defender who was to become known simply as Der Kaiser, played a part in revolutionising football in his role as an attacking libero. 

His brilliant organisational qualities helped him become only one of two men to have won World Cups as both a player and a manager, in 1974 and 1990, respectively. 

Born in Bavaria in 1945, a lifelong association with Bayern Munich began when he made his debut for the club shortly before his 18th birthday in 1963. Soon after that he was a fixture in West Germanys national team. 

In 1966 he was the Bundesligas Player of the Year and arrived in England for that summers World Cup finals shouldering German hopes of a victory. 

The fresh-faced 20-year-old was a revelation throughout the tournament, scoring four goals as the Germans progressed smoothly into the final against England. 

Football historians remain convinced that German coach Helmut Schon blundered in the final by forcing Beckenbauer to play an unfamiliar role in man-marking Bobby Charltons. 

England ran out 4-2 winners, but Beckenbauer was to exact handsome revenge four years later when the same two nations met in the 1970 Mexico World Cup quarter finals. 

Beckenbauer scored the first goal as the Germans fought back from 2-0 down to record a 3-2 victory and advance to the semi-finals. 

Another heroic performance from Beckenbauer in the last four, where he played with one arm strapped to his chest because of shoulder injury, could not stop Italy from winning 4-3 however. But having suffered two near-misses in 1966 and 1970, Beckenbauer made it third-time lucky on home soil in 1974. 

He was not around to lead Germanys defence of the title four years later. In 1977, one year after being named European Player of the Year for the second time, he retired.

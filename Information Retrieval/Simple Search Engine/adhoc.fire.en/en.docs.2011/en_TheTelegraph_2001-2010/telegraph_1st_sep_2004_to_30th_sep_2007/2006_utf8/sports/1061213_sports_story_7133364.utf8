 Boje calls it a day

 - Surprise announcement by SA spinner 

Johannesburg: In a surprise announcement, former South African vice-captain Nicky Boje, who had been recalled last week to the South African squad for the first Test against India after almost two years in wilderness, on Tuesday said he would retire from all international cricket immediately. 

I have decided to retire from international cricket immediately and I am accordingly unavailable to form part of the Proteas squad for this season, Boje said in a statement released by the South African Cricketers Association, of which he is the president. 

I wish my former team-mates side the very best for the future and Im confident that the team has a very bright future, the 33-year-old said. Haroon Lorgat, the convenor of the national selectors, was not available to comment on who would replace the all-rounder in South Africas 15-man squad. 

The 33-year-old bowler said his decision stemmed from the desire to concentrate on his domestic career. 

Boje said he felt the time had come for him to devote the remainder of his playing years to Eagles, the team he represents in domestic cricket. 

I have had 11 years of international cricket and will always cherish wonderful memories of playing for South Africa. 

I now feel that the time has come for me to devote the remainder of my playing years to Eagles cricket, he said in the statement. 

Left-arm spinner Boje, who took 100 wickets at an average of 42.65 in 43 Tests and 96 wickets from 115 ODIs at 35.57, last played an ODI in October 2005 against New Zealand. 

He was overlooked for the Champions Trophy in India amid controversy over his alleged role in the match-fixing scandal of 2000 being investigated by Delhi Police. While Gibbs made himself available for questioning, Boje is still to give his statement to Delhi Police. 

Captaining the Eagles in South African domestic cricket, Boje leads the bowling statistics with 17 wickets from the three matches his side have played this season. He is well-placed in the batting list too with 272 runs at 54.40. (Reuters)

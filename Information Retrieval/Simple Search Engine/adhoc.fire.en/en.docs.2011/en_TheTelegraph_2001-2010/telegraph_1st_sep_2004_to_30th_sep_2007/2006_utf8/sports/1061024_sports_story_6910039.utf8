The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 IN THE CITY

 The IFA, in a joint effort with Vipin Vohra, has offered help to Shyamal Bag, M.A. Sattar, Prabhat Kumar Ghosh and the family of late Bhaskar Adhikary, who are associated with the state football in a way or other.

 A stalwart of yesteryears, Sattar is now in financial distress. A promising footballer, Bag had to stop playing after an on-field accident. Ghosh is a Salt Lake Stadium staff and is seeking help for his ailing four-year-old daughter. Adhikary, a Milan Bithee player, passed away owing to lack of treatment on July 5. 

 Mohun Bagan forward P.C. Lalawmpuia has been suspended for a week over allegation that he was leading an indisciplined life. 

 CHESS: WBCA all India meet at Khudiram Anushilan Kendra: Round II from 9.30 am. 

 WRESTLING: Meet in memory of Dr Bidhan Chandra Roy at the Burrabazar Byam Samity.

 France paired with Italy 

 - EURO 2008 QUALIFIERS 

Montreux: France were paired with Italy, who they beat to win Euro 2000, at Fridays draw for the qualifying competition for Euro 2008. 

France, who won that final with a golden goal from David Trezeguet in Rotterdam, were also paired with World Cup finalists Ukraine in Group B. Scotland, Lithuania, Georgia and the Faroe Islands complete the opposition. 

World Cup hosts Germany, three-time the European champions, were drawn with the Czech Republic, who they overcame in the Euro 1996 final, in Group D. Germany were placed in the second group of seeds because they had no World Cup qualifying points contributing to their coefficient for the draw and will also face Slovakia, Ireland, Wales, Cyprus and San Marino. 

European champions Greece, surprising winners in Portugal in 2004, will lock horns with old rivals Turkey in Group C. They are joined by Norway, Bosnia, Hungary, Moldova and Malta in Group C. 

England, who are among the favourites to do well in the World Cup in Germany in June, will face fellow World Cup finalists Croatia, who they beat 4-2 at Euro 2004, as well as Russia, Israel, Estonia, Macedonia and Andorra in Group E. 

Portugal, hosts of the last tournament and also through to the finals in Germany, face tough matches against Poland and Serbia amp; Montenegro as well as Belgium, Finland and long-haul trips to Armenia, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan in the only eight-team group. 

World Cup finalists Sweden face neighbouring Denmark, European champions in 1992, in Group F which also includes World Cup finalists Spain, as well as Latvia, Iceland, Northern Ireland and Liechtenstein. 

Top seeds The Netherlands face Romania, who they also played in the World Cup qualifiers, Bulgaria, Slovenia, Albania, Belarus and Luxembourg in Group G. (Reuters)

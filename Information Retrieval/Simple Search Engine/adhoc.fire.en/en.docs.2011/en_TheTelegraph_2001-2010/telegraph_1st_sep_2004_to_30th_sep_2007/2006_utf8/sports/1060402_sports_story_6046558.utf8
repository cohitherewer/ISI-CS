 PHF bans Aziz for six months

Karachi: Striker Tariq Aziz has been banned for six months by the PHF for his off-the-ball hit on a rival player in the Commonwealth Games final against Australia last week. 

PHF president Tariq Kirmani banned Aziz on Friday after getting reports from team management as well as some observers who witnessed the incident, a Pakistani paper reported on Saturday. 

Aziz was given a red card in the final for hitting Australias Robert Hammond. The player received stitches on his top lip and had to sit out for the rest of the match. 

The PHF ban effectively rules Aziz out of the World Cup which is to be held in Germany in September. 

He will also miss the World Cup qualifiers in China, Sultan Azlan Shah Cup in Malaysia and the Champions Trophy in Spain in July.Even before the ban became effective, the forward was omitted from the list of 23 probables for Pakistans campaign in the World Cup qualifiers. (PTI)

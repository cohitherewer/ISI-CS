Taipei: A proven star on the India turf, Gaurav Ghei turned the clock back playing a superb final round of six-under 66 to win the $500,000 Mercuries Masters Golf Tournament while compatriot and overnight leader Rahil Gangjee had to be content with the second spot. 

Ghei, who won his only Asian Tour title way back in 1995 at the Gadgil Western Masters, rallied from a four-shot deficit to total 10-under 278, one shot clear of Gangjee (72) who led overnight at eight-under 280 at the Taiwan Golf and Country Club. Ted Oh was third at six-under. 

Ghei, sixth overnight, played calmly and parred the final hole to set the target. Gangjee needed birdies in his last two holes but managed only one on 18th to finish one shot behind. It was a case of so near and yet to so far for Gangjee, who has been in great form. He was third at Brunei Open and then again third last week in Korea and now second. 

This victory was the third for an Indian in last 10 months after Shiv Kapurs win at the Volvo Masters of Asia in December 2005 and Jeev Milkha Singhs victory at the Volvo China Open in April. 

Gheis immediate reaction to the win was one of relief, this was great and came after such a long time. I have had ups and downs, some injuries a couple of years back and some other problems, but now I have been playing well. So, it is nice to have won this one. 

It has been 11 years since I won and the way I played in the last two days without dropping a shot, it is just fantastic. This is all going to take a while to sink in, said Ghei, who also made a giant leap to 10 places on the Asian Tours UBS Order of Merit, with earnings of $218,000. 

In 1995 Ghei had finished fifth on the money list but with just under $125,000. 

I had a great start and was five under on the front and I told myself to play well and keep it on the fairway. 

The likeable Ghei, now a senior player in the Indian contingent, spared a thought for the unlucky SSP Chowrasia, when he said, its been a crazy week. My thoughts go out to Chowrasia, who was disqualified for not signing his scorecard while leading by five shots after two rounds but at the same time Im very happy to have won after a long time. 

The key hole for me is probably the par save at the 10th hole. I struck it of the tee and the ball landed in the bunker around six feet away from the pin. The second shot was awesome as the ball landed right next to the Cup and I putted for par, he added. 

The win also opens a lot of doors for Ghei, who gets to play in the elite company of Tiger Woods and others at the HSBC Champions in Shanghai in November. There will be at least two other Indians, Kapur and Jeev, as other winners since last edition of the tournament. 

Ghei, who turned 38 last week on September 25, has always been a dangerous customer on Indian courses, particularly in the final round and more so if the tournament is at the Delhi Golf Club, which is his home course. 

Considered a trail-blazer of sorts in Indian golf, Ghei was a prodigy in Indian golf when he started coming up in the mid and late 1980s. The Delhi boy won a lot of junior events and then in 1990, he represented India at the Asian Games in Beijing alongside Jeev Milkha Singh. He also represented India in the Asian Games and Nomura Cup. 

Winner of numerous amateur titles across India, he turned pro in 1991 and one of his early international wins came at the Desaru Classic in Malaysia and the Asia Nations Cup in 1999 in Malaysia, where he was first individually. In 1995, when he won the Gadgil Western Masters, his winning cheque of $80,750 was the single largest cheque for an Indian sportsperson. 

A year later, Ghei in the company of Jeev and Ali Sher, formed the Indian team, which stunned Scotland including Colin Montgomerie and Andrew Coltart, 2-1 in the Dunhill Cup, which Scotland nevertheless went on to win. In 1997, Ghei became the first Indian to qualify for the British Open in 1997 after shooting a two-day score of 135 to finish second in his qualifying venue and earn a place in the starting line-up at Royal Troon.

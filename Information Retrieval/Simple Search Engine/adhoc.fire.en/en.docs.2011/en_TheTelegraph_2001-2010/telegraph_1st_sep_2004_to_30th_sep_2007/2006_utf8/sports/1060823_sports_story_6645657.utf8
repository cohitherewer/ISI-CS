 Schnyder upset

New Haven: Svetlana Kuznetsova wanted to get some work in before the US Open. 

She got a little more than she had bargained for in the first set before beating American Jill Craybas 6-7, 6-1, 6-1 on Monday in the first round of the Pilot Pen meet. 

The first set lasted an hour and 22 minutes and the final two took just 22 and 25 minutes, respectively. 

Kuznetsova, the seventh-ranked player in the world, came out slow. Tied at three games apiece, she lost a marathon seventh game that went to deuce 14 times before Craybas held serve. 

The rallies were long and it was a very hard match, she said. 

I just felt so tired. You have bad days sometimes, you know, and Im very happy I got through. 

She also had to overcome a crowd that was clearly behind Craybas, 

Kuznetsova, the tournaments fifth seed, avoided the fate of sixth-seeded Patty Schnyder, who was beaten by qualifier Sun Tiantian of China 1-6, 3-6. 

I just held my serve on the court and had great games, said Sun, who played three qualifying matches before facing Schnyder. 

I played better and better every match. 

It was the first time the two had met. Schnyder entered the tournament ranked No. 8 in the world with 10 career titles. Sun, who was ranked No. 93, has never won a tour event. 

Her only other victory against a top 10 player came last year in Beijing when she upset Serena Williams. 

I was not on my game and she really mixed it up, Schnyder said. She was really good, mixed up her serves and I really didnt know her.

 Azzurris get time to relax

 Vincenzo Iaquinta 

Duisburg: Italy relaxed on Tuesday after opening the World Cup with a convincing 2-0 win over Ghana. Reserves that did not play in Mondays game stayed in shape with a training match against a local U-19 squad. Assistant coach Ciro Ferrara also took part. 

Defender Gianluca Zambrotta, who sat out against Ghana with a left thigh injury, took part in the match and was cleared to play in Italys next group E game against the US on Saturday. 

Playmaker Francesco Totti was also given the go-ahead to play after an X-ray showed his previously injured left leg did not suffer more serious damage when took a hit below the knee against Ghana. 

After the morning training match, coach Marcello Lippi gave the squad the rest of the day off, its first since arriving in Germany. Goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon said he would spend the time with his girlfriend, Czech model Alena Seredova. 

The guys get along well within the team, but if you look hard youll find theres quite a difference between Alena and (Gennaro) Gattuso, Buffon said, referring to the midfielder known for his snarling features. A half day off will do us some good.

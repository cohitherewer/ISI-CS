The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 CAB irked, but will host

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah, in his letter to his CAB counterpart Saradindu Pal on Monday, asked the latter whether the association is prepared to hold Champions Trophy matches slated to be in the month of October and November. 

Shah has asked for reply within 48 hours. BCCI has given us only 48 hours to reply, which is very less for us to decide whether we are prepared to organise such a big international tournament. There are certain protocols, which we have to maintain like calling a working committee meeting for the members consent, said a CAB official on Tuesday. 

But it is clear that CAB will reply on Wednesday, stating that they are ready to stage the tournament.

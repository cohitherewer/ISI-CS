Calcutta: The second edition of the Sunfeast Open would feature nine players among the WTA top-100 led by former Swiss world No.1 Martina Hingis and Sania Mirza, Globosport, the organisers of the Tier III meet, said in a statement here on Tuesday. 

Of those who would slug it out in the $175,000 September 18-24 meet at the Netaji Indoor Stadium include Croatias Karolina Sprem, the runner-up in the inaugural edition in 2005. 

Yuliana Fedak from Ukraine, Hungarys Melinda Czink, Galina Voskoboeva ( Russia), Kaia Kanepi (Estonia), Aravane Rezai (France) and Yulia Beygelzimer (Ukraine), make up the list. 

Announcing the field, Mahesh Bhupathi said, In its second edition only the meet has grown in stature and this year too we have an array of top players who will provide some scintillating action. 

The presence of a group of promising youngsters, each capable of winning their first WTA title will add excitement to the challenge. 

For Ukranian Yuliana Fedak, this will be the second visit to India during the year. 

 In February, she played at the Bangalore WTA tournament 

 where she recorded a quarter final appearance before losing 

 to the eventual winner.

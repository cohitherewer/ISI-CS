Ramnaresh Sarwan (56) and Daren Ganga (54) both made half-centuries while Dwayne Smith chipped in with a lusty 38 but the visitors crumbled to be all out in the 48th over. 

Daniel Vettori finishedwith two for 29 from his 10 overs, while super sub Jeetan Patel and paceman Michael Mason also bagged two wickets each. 

Astle and How put on 136 for the opening wicket, setting a New Zealand record against the West Indies. 

How, playing in only his fifth ODI, reached his second half-century off 76 balls while Astle posted his 39th ODI fifty off 58 deliveries.

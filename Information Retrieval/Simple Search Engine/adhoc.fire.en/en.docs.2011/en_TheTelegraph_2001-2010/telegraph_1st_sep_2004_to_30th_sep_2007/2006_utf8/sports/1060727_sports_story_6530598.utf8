 Goldstein upsets Hewitt 

 - LOS ANGELES OPEN 

 - Haas, Safin move into Round II 

 Hewitt during his match against Paul Goldstein on Tuesday 

Los Angeles: Paul Goldstein, a journeyman professional who has never cracked the top 50 on the ATP Tour, scored one of the biggest wins of his nine-year career on Tuesday night. He upset former world No. 1 Lleyton Hewitt, 6-4, 6-4, in the first round of the Countrywide Classic Tennis Tournament here. 

I think it has to be one of my best matches, said Goldstein, 29, of San Francisco. In the past when Ive been in position to win (a big match) I just want it so bloody bad Id lose the ability to execute. Today I was able to maintain that calm demeanour and execute. 

Goldstein, who hasnt won more than one match at any tournament since mid-April, used the combination of consistent groundstrokes and well-timed advances to the net to beat the second-seeded Hewitt for the first time in five meetings. 

He took the lead in the second set with a service break in the fifth game, then fought off two break points to hold serve for 5-3 and closed out the match with his eighth ace. 

The win evened Goldsteins record for the year at 14-14, with two of those losses coming at the hands of Hewitt in San Jose and Las Vegas. 

Id played him close three out of the four times, said Goldstein, who credited his breakthrough win to a telephone conversation with his coach, Scott McCain. 

He said, Youve got a chance to measure yourself against one of the best in the world. Just go out and take advantage of that opportunity, Goldstein said. That made me go out there with a little looser attitude, an enjoy-the-moment attitude. 

The 13th-ranked Hewitt, playing his first match since Wimbledon, said Goldstein played well. Hes a guy youve got to get out there and beat. He was running a lot of balls down and didnt give me a lot of cheap points. He played well on the big points; better than I did. 

Earlier in the day, Tommy Haas took another step toward regaining his early-season form with a 6-4, 6-4 victory over Wayne Arthurs. Haas, who won this event in 2004, captured a pair of titles in the first two months of this year, then injured his right wrist in April. 

Two-time Grand Slam champion and former No. 1 Marat Safin, whos also trying to regroup after an injury, moved into the second round with a 6-4, 7-5 win over American Mardy Fish. Safin will face No. 3 seed Fernando Gonzalez of Chile in the second round. 

In other matches Tuesday, No. 7 Dominik Hrbaty of Slovakia beat American Zack Fleishman, 7-5, 7-5; George Bastl of Switzerland was a 6-3, 7- 6 (1) winner over Nicolas Mahut of France; and Lars Burgsmuller of Germany outlasted American Michael Yani 6-4, 3-6, 6-3; Scott Oudsema of the US beat Benjamin Becker of Germany, 7-5, 6-3; and Sam Querrey of the US beat countryman Vince Spadea, 7-5, 6-4.

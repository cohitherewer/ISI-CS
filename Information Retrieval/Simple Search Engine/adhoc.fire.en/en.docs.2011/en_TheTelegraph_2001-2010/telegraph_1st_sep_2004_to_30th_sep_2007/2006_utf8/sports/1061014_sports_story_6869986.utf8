 Sending Gibbs a big mistake: Bacher

 - Why should we open old wounds? 

Durban: Former South African cricket chief Dr Ali Bacher has said it was a big mistake to send Herschelle Gibbs to India for questioning by the Indian police six years after the scandal broke out in 2000. 

I am not so certain that I would have taken such a risk. Why should we open old wounds, particularly during a championship, the veteran cricket administrator told a local newspaper. 

Bacher was referring to the interrogation of Gibbs by Delhi Police, hardly a week before the South Africans were to start their campaign in the ICC Champions Trophy being held in India. 

I have interacted with the Indian media for 15 years and you can be assured they will not back off on this issue until the South African team departs for home, said Bacher, who was in charge of South African cricket when the match fixing scandal broke out in 2000. 

Gibbs had stayed away from the previous two tours of India fearing arrest before agreeing to be interrogated in the presence of his lawyer this time around.

Meanwhile, a day after the South African opener was interrogated in the high-profile case, a senior police officer involved in the interrogation said he appeared to be disturbed during the session. 

During his interrogation, the South African cricketer was also understood to have admitted his ignorance about the enormity of the issue of match-fixing. 

Gibbs, who was accompanied by his lawyer Peter Whelan, faced a volley of over 100 questions pertaining to all aspects of the scandal. 

The much-documented match-fixing episode shook the cricketing world in 2000 when Delhi Police made public the telephonic conversation between Cronje and London-based bookie Sanjeev Chawla to throw away a one-day International match.

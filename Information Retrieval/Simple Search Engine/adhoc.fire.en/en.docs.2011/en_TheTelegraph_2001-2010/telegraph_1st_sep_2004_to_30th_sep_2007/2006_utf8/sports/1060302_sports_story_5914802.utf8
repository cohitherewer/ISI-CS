 Vaughan ready to give up ODIs

 - I would compromise if the specialists recommend it 

 Michael Vaughan 

London: England captain Michael Vaughan said he could consider giving up one-day cricket if the specialist advice recommended so. 

One of my ambitions is to go with England to the World Cup and do very well, which we havent done for a long time. Of course, Id compromise if the specialists recommend that I give up one-day cricket, Vaughan, who is back here from India, owing to a recurring injury to his right knee, told The Daily Telegraph on Wednesday. 

I just feel unfit to play cricket at the moment though Id want to be available for both forms of the game. 

He said the right decision now is to get things sorted out fully and make sure that when I come back Im able to play a full part. 

The recovery period for an arthroscopy is usually six weeks (the time set aside for Vaughan), but he was struggling last week once his workload increased. Running in a straight line was pain free, but not when twisting or playing forcing strokes off the back foot. 

Im not sure when Ill play again, but I think it unlikely that Ill be back for the Tests in India, he said. 

Meanwhile, Vaughan and Simon Jones are to see a surgeon in the England captains home town of Sheffield. 

Reverse-swing specialist Jones collapsed in the nets on Monday minutes after Yorkshire batsman Vaughan was ruled out of the first Test, which started in Nagpur Wednesday, with a recurrence of his longstanding knee problem. 

Now they are set to see knee surgeon Derek Bickerstaff at Sheffields Thornbury Hospital.

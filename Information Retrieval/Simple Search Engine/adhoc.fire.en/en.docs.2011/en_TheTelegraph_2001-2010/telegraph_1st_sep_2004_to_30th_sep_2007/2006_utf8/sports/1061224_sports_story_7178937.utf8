 Vettori to lead NZ

 First 2 ODIs 

Sydney: Spinner Daniel Vettori will lead New Zealand in two one-day Internationals against Sri Lanka as regular captain Stephen Fleming would be rested, the New Zealand Press Association reported on Saturday. 

Fleming, who also has a slight elbow strain, and fast bowler Shane Bond will sit out the first two games of the five-match series against Sri Lanka as part of a rotational policy designed to help preparations for next years World Cup. 

Vettori has led New Zealand in eight one-day Internationals. 

Batsman Hamish Marshall returns to the squad after being dropped for the Test series against Sri Lanka. Uncapped seamer Mark Gillespie was also called up. The first match of the series is in Napier on December 28.

 Ronaldo out for 3 weeks

 - Brazilian faces a years driving ban 

Madrid: Ronaldo will be sidelined for three weeks after having a minor operation on his left knee in Brazil, Real Madrid said on Saturday. 

The operation was a success and we believe he will be able to return to work in three weeks time, Real doctor Alfonso del Corral told the clubs website. 

Brazil doctor Jose Luiz Runco had said the player was suffering from tibial calcification around the tendon in his knee and needed surgery to remove the calcium after the World Cup finals. Ronaldo backed Runcos diagnosis though Real said the player would not need surgery and that they had advised him to rest. 

The 29-year-old striker struggled with minor health problems and suggestions he was overweight before the tournament, in which Brazil were knocked out in the quarter finals by France. 

Meanwhile, according to a daily in Rio de Janeiro, the Brazil striker faces a years driving ban after racking up more than a dozen traffic offences. Ronaldo was fined 13 times in a year and owed Rio de Janeiros traffic department $1,363 in fines. The report said Ronaldo had paid just two fines. 

A spokesman for Ronaldo, however, said he was not responsible for the offences as he didnt live in Rio and often lent his car ? a luxurious black Audi ? to family members. There was a fine even in June while he was playing in the World Cup. (Agencies)

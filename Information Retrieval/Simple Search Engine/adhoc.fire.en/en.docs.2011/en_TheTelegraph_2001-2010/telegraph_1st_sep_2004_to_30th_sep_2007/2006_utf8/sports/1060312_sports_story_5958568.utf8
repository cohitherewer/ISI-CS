 Anju (6.34) leaps out of contention

Moscow: Anju Bobby George failed to make the womens long jump finals at the IAAF World Andoor Athletics Championships on Saturday. 

Anjus best jump was 6.34 metres, which was 20 centimetres below the cut-off mark and also outside the best eight from groups A and B. 

The lanky girl from Kerala could have made it to the finals had she repeated her Federation Cup performance back home last week when she jumped 6.47. That would have been better than the 6.46 by Cuban Savigne Yargelis who qualified as the eighth best. 

Anju leaped 6.16 in her first attempt, improved on it, only to slip to 6.33 in the third chance. 

Meanwhile, husband and coach Robert Bobby George alleged on Saturday that Anju missed out because the measuring instrument malfunctioned and because the tournament officials were incompet. 

We are sure that Anju cleared 6.55m which was the qualifying mark for the finals, but the officials gave a much lower reading for her jump, he said. 

The measurement indicator on the side of the pit showed that Anju had cleared 6.55m comfortably, but the event officials decreed that her attempt was much less. 

They said there was some problem in measurement and gave Anju a much lower mark which was not enough for qualification, he claimed. 

The officials stated that they were giving Anju a measurement of 6.34m as a compromise since they were having some problems with the instrument, Robert said. 

We lodged a complaint with the tournament organisers but the jury brushed our claims aside. 

On Friday, world and Olympic pole vault champion Yelena Isinbayeva had no problems qualifying for the final. The world record-holder cleared 4.50 metres, albeit on her second attempt after misjudging her opening vault and hitting the bar on the way up. 

Holder Tatyana Lebedeva of Russia qualified for the triple jump final with her opening leap of 14.37m.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 We must remain calm, says Totti

 - De Rossi apologises to McBride 

 Francesco Totti 

Kaiserslautern: Italy came out bruised and battered from their 1-1 draw with the US on Saturday. It wasnt pretty but it was worth it ? the Azzurri sit atop Group E after two matches and can ensure their qualification to the second round with a draw in next weeks match against the Czech Republic. 

I think well bounce back, said midfielder Simone Perrotta. It was a step backwards with respect to the Ghana match, but we can count on a very strong team. 

Perrotta said Italy were surprised by the strength of Americans, who held on for a draw despite playing most of the second half at a man disadvantage. 

We certainly werent expecting them to play like they did, Perrotta said. The Italian midfielder was bruised in the second half but finished the match. Italy had made three substitutions before and couldnt replace him. 

By that time, Italy already had Daniele De Rossi sent off for bloodying Brian McBrides face with his elbow. The Americans had two players sent off. 

Weve got to remain calm, Francesco Totti said. Were still in first place in the standings and the next game will be decisive. 

Totti exited a few minutes after De Rossis ejection. He picked up a yellow card in the fifth minute for a sliding tackle on Clint Dempsey. 

The referee was very stingy with us for the entire match. I didnt understand my yellow card because I didnt even touch the opponent, Totti said. From that moment on, the game had set its course. 

Coach Marcello Lippi said I havent talked with De Rossi yet. He needs to be left to stew on things a little more. He needs to think over things for a bit ? about last night but not only about last night. 

Meanwhile, De Rossi, who bloodied Brian McBride with his elbow, so much so that the American striker required three stitches under his left eye, has apologised to McBride. 

Im sorry for myself, my team and the fans. I want to apologise, I didnt intend to harm him. I talked with him and now Im hoping the punishment isnt too harsh, said De Rossi. 

I feel terrible about it. I explained what happened with McBride and he was very kind. 

McBride called the 22-year-old AS Roma midfielder classy for coming over to him after the match. 

He paid his punishment. I dont think he should be expelled from the World Cup, Lippi said. (AP)

 Pressure on Lippi to resign

Milan: Calls for Italy coach Marcello Lippi to resign over a football scandal clouded the national teams World Cup preparations on Sunday, three weeks before they start their campaign in Germany. Italian newspapers reported pressure was rising on Lippi to step down, a move that would seriously disrupt Italys World Cup campaign. 

Magistrates summoned Lippi on Friday as a witness in the match-fixing scandal and he is expected to be questioned more extensively next week. 

Lippi denied last week that former Juventus general manager Luciano Moggi, who is at the centre of match-fixing allegations, forced him to select certain players for the national side for his personal profit from transfer deals. 

Lippis son Davide is also an agent at the sports transfer agency being probed by authorities. (Reuters)

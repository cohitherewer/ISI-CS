Sydney: South Africa skipper Graeme Smith ended his prolonged slump in form with a strong allround performance to lead his team to a five-wicket win over Sri Lanka in a one-day International at the WACA in Perth on Tuesday. 

Smith took career-best figures of three wickets for 30 runs as Sri Lanka collapsed for 222 and then made 41 to lay the foundations for a comfortable South African victory. 

It was a good win for us at the end of the day, Smith said. It gives us a bit of confidence going into the next game against Australia. South Africas victory means Australia are already assured of a place in the best-of-three finals series. 

South Africa need just one win from their last three matches to claim the other spot ahead of Sri Lanka. 

Sanath Jayasuriya top-scored for Sri Lanka with a brilliant 86 from only 65 balls but did not get enough support from the lower order. 

South Africa cruised to the victory target with 4.5 overs to spare. In-form opener Boeta Dippenaar held the innings together with 87 from 94 deliveries, adorned by seven fours and three sixes. 

Jayasuriya smacked nine boundaries and three sixes in a dazzling display, but only Dilshan Tillekeratne (37) and Jehan Mubarak (31) made more than 20. 

Part-time spinner Smith dismissed Mubarak, Jayasuriya and Mahela Jayawardene in a four-over spell to trigger a collapse that saw Sri Lankas last nine wickets tumble for just 84 runs. 

South Africa were always in control after Smith and Dippenaar piled on 84 for the opening wicket. There was a slight wobble in the middle-order when Sri Lanka spinner Muttiah Muralidharan grabbed three wickets, but an unbeaten 30 from Mark Boucher and 20 not out from Ashwell Prince steered the South Africans home.

 Zaheer not surprised

Karachi: Zaheer Abbas said he had no regrets at being replaced as manager of the national squad for the Champions Trophy in India from October 7. 

I think the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has a policy of changing the manager for each series. It is not surprising to me, the former Test cricketer said. 

Zaheer was replaced by another former Test player Talat Ali on Tuesday, a move which was strongly criticised by another Pakistan great Javed Miandad. 

The general impression on Zaheers being replaced is that the PCB wanted to bring in someone who could act with more authority as The Oval Test fiasco has not gone down well with the PCB. 

But, Zaheer claimed that he performed his duty well during the tour of England.

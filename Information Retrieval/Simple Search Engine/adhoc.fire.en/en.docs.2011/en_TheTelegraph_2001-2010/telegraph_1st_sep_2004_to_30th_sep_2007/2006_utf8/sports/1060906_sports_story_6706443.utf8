Norton (Massachusetts): Tiger Woods unleashed two eagles (As reported in Tuesdays Late City edition) and four birdies in his final round to win the Deutsche Bank Championship on Monday, extending his winning streak to five tournaments. 

This is Woods longest winning streak in a season, a streak that began in July with a victory in the British Open. 

Byron Nelson won 11 straight tournaments in 1945, a streak regarded as one of the most untouchable in sports. Woods won six straight at the end of 1999 and the start of 2000, and Ben Hogan won six in a row in 1948. 

Woods, the British Open and PGA champion, fired an exquisite final-round 63 to finish on 16-under-par 268, two shots clear of Fijis overnight leader Vijai Singh and eight shots ahead of third placed Brian Bateman of the US. 

This was also Woods lowest final round in a tournament he has won. He twice shot 63 in the final round at the Byron Nelson Championship and once at Disney. 

It also was his largest comeback in the final round since he overcame a five-shot deficit at the Pebble Beach National Pro-Am in 2000, which he won for his sixth straight victory. Woods made up seven shots over his final seven holes. 

Woods came out hard, taking only three holes to erase Singhs three-stroke lead, which the Fijian had amassed by shooting a course record and personal best 10-under-par 61 on Sunday. 

Woods first eagle came on the 554-yard, par-five second hole, where he landed on the green in two strokes, flying his approach shot over the holes water hazard and making an 11-foot putt. 

His second eagle was on the 600-yard, par-five seventh, where Woods, leading by one stroke, again marched to the green in two strokes to massive applause and sunk another 11-foot putt. 

Singh, who had consistently dropped his approach shots close to the holes on Sundays soft, rain-soaked greens, frequently found his ball in the rough on the dry, sunny day, making only four birdies in shooting a three-under-par 68. 

At the 426-yard, par-four 15th hole, Singh nearly tied it up, when his approach shot almost landed in the hole, bouncing off the base of the flagstick instead. Singh made birdie on that hole, as did Woods, his playing partner.

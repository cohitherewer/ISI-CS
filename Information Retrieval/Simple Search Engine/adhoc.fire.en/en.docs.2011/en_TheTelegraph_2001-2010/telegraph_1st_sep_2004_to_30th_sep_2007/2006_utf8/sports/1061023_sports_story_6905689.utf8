 Give Houghton at least 2 years, says Bhaichung

Siliguri: Indian football captain Baichung Bhutia said on Sunday that the national squad would have to practise hard to play well throughout the 90-minute duration of a match instead of shining in patches. 

Bhutia said coach Bob Houghton should be given at least two seasons to implement his strategy for improving the performance of the Indians. 

Houghton should be given at least two years to spot the boys and implement his strategy, the striker said. 

When asked about the AFC Asian Cup qualifier against Japan in which India conceded three goals and scored none, resulting in Indias drop by seven places in Fifa ranking, Bhutia said our players played well and could have dished out a better show had the first goal been barred. 

Referring to his three-match suspension for misconduct in a CFL Premier Division match, Bhutia said, I should not have acted like that. My misconduct could have influenced young players. 

Bhutia was suspended for three league matches by IFA on October 11 for arguing with the referee and refusing to leave the field after being shown red card during a CFL Premier Division match against East Bengal. 

He was also handed out a fine of Rs 50,000 and would be automatically suspended for two matches of next years Premier League, if he failed to pay the amount. 

To another query about involvement of politicians in soccer management, he said it was a good trend and would have no bad effect on the players. 

For each and every player the challenge is first to perform, in front of a sizeable crowd, as it was related to his existence, Bhutia said. 

The ace striker said he was considering a football academy for improving Indian soccer.

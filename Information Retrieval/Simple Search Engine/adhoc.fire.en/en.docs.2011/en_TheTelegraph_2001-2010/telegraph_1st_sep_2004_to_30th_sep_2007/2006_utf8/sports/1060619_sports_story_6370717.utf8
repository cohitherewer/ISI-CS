 Luis Aragones warns of Tunisian backlash

 - Theyre a better side than they showed in the first game, says Spain coach 

Stuttgart: Spain coach Luis Aragones feared a backlash from Tunisia after the north Africans failed to live up to World Cup expectations in the 2-2 draw with Saudi Arabia. 

Im worried because Tunisia didnt play well in the first game, Aragones said on the eve of Mondays group H match against the 2004 African champions. 

They are a better side than they showed in the first game, they have an intelligent coach (Roger Lemerre) and a high-quality midfield. 

Aragones said he would not be underestimating his opponents. 

Tunisia are a very well organised and well-coached outfit. Their midfield is strong, pretty skilful and very athletic. 

Up front (Ziad) Jaziri is quick, mobile and dangerous. All the teams in this competition are very evenly matched and anything can happen. 

Spain crushed Ukraine 4-0 in their first game but Aragones said his side has not get carried away. 

The euphoria was only in Spain and there was never any danger of us getting carried away, he said. I havent had to tell the players to stay focused because they know it. Every game is different and every game in this tournament will be very tough. 

Not everything went right against Ukraine, Aragones said. 

What some people havent mentioned is that there were some negative aspects in the Ukraine match, for example, they had a couple of chances to score after they had a man sent off, he said. 

We can repeat that sort of performance but Ill be demanding the maximum from the team as the players want to achieve something big at this World Cup. 

Aragones hinted he would field an unchanged side, with captain and all-time leading scorer Raul remaining on the bench. 

The 67-year-old dismissed suggestions Raul was upset with his decision to leave the striker out. 

Its understandable he is more serious because he is not playing, Id be the same if I was him, he said. 

But he played 40 minutes the other day and I think people are taking it all out of context. I dont understand the fuss. Raul is a very humble lad and Im not talking about this matter for another second longer, said the coach. 

Playmaker Xavi believes Spain will win again, but expects a much tougher match against Tunisia. 

On paper we are superior to Tunisia but they play at a frenetic rhythm and are a skilful side, probably more skilful than Ukraine, he said. 

Tunisia, who needed a last-gasp goal from defender Radhi Jaidi to snatch a point from Saudi Arabia, are confident they can produce a much-improved performance against the group leaders. 

Sure we will be motivated, said Jaidi. They are a big team with big players. We can repair what weve done. In any case we cant do as badly or worse than in the last game. We must concentrate and keep cool. 

Once more Tunisia will have to do without injured leading striker Francileudo dos Santos. The Brazilian-born player, who has scored 18 goals in 28 matches, is out with a shin injury.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Bhowmick hopes for a turnaround

 NFL tie vs Mahindra

 Panaji: Buoyed by their 

 win against Al Ahed in the AFC Cup, Federation Cup winners 

 Mahindra United are determined to collect full points against 

 Mohammedan Sporting Friday in a National Football League 

 match in Margao.

 A victory will bring Mahindra 

 within sniffing distance of their maiden NFL title. The 

 club is currently perched atop the table with 29 points 

 from 13 matches, which is two games less than East Bengal 

 who are second with 28 points.

 Mohammedan Sporting, who are fighting 

 to avoid relegation along with Salgaocar, have one point 

 more than the Goan side who are languishing at the bottom.

 Mohammedan Sporting suffered back-to-back 

 defeats since Subhas Bhowmick took over the sides 

 charge. The former East Bengal coach knows the gravity of 

 the situation and hopes his side will play to their potential 

 for a turnaround. 

 Their success will depend much 

 on their strikers, particularly Patrick Okonji. 

 Mahindra will be playing without 

 Jose Ramirez Barreto, who is nursing an injury, and Sur 

 Kumar due to a double booking. (PTI)

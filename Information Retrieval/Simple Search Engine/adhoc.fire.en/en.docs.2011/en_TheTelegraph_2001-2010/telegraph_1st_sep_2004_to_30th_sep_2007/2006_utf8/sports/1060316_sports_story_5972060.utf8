 Dravid now No. 3 batsman

 - ICC test ranking

London: India will replace England as the second-best team in Tests if they win the ongoing home series. 

Rahul Dravid and Anil Kumble moved up the batting charts in the ICC Test rankings after the nine-wicket win in Mohali. 

Dravids 95 and 42 not out lifted him three spots and put him behind Ricky Ponting and Jacques Kallis in the latest rankings for Test batsmen. 

Sachin Tendulkar slipped three spots to be at 15th while Virender Sehwag, whose unbeaten 76 secured his sides victory on Monday, remained 10th. 

Kumble is now the leading Indian bowler after his nine for 146, including the record 500th wicket, eased him up one place to 12th and saw him overtake Irfan Pathan. 

The left-arm fast bowler has slipped two positions to 13th but he has strengthened his hold on fourth spot in the allrounders list and is now within striking distance of South Africas Shaun Pollock.

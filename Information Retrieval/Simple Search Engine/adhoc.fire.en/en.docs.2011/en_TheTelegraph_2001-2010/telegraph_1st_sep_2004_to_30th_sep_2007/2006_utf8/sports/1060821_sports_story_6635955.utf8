 Johl finishes at 9th spot

Sanya: Amandeep Johl started the second half of the Asian Tour season with a top-10 finish as he ended up being ninth on the $200,000 Crowne Plaza Open at the Yalong Bay Golf Club Sunday. 

The 37-year-old veteran golfer shot a round of two-under 70 and finished at 12-under 276 to be four shots behind the winner, 17-year-old Thai Chinarat Phadsungil. 

Phadsungil beat another Thai youngster Prom Meesawat and Chinese Taipeis Lin Wen Tang in a three-way play-off on the second play-off hole. 

Johl was the best among the six Indians, who made the cut. SSP Chowrasia also added a two-under 70 to get to eight-under 280 and finish tied 15th up from overnight tied 19th. Two other Indians, Rahil Gangjee (69) and Gaurav Ghei (72) also figured in the tie for 15th place. 

Harmeet Kahlon slipped to tied 32nd with an even par round, while Digvijay Singh (75) who started the tournament with a four-under card, ended tied 47th. 

Phadsungil, while still being an amateur, underlined his amazing potential. The youngster dedicated the win to his coach, who died last month. 

He also re-affirmed his steely nerves while winning the play-off. Last year, he beat Indias Shiv Kapur in a play-off and this time, he beat Meesawat and Lin Wen Tang. 

Johl started the day sedately with six pars and found his birdie on the seventh. He got another on tenth to be two-under at that stage. He dropped a shot on 15th but got that back on 16th and parred the last two holes. 

I should have been up there, but it is a good start to the second half of the season, said Johl. 

Chowrasia enhanced his reputation with a good round of 70 that gave him a good 15th place. Playing aggressively he had six birdies and four bogeys on his card. (PTI)

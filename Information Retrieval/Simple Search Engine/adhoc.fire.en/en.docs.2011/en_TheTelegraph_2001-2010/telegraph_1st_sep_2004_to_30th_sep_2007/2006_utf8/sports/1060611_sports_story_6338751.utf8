 Quick Takes

 Federer may fly in to cheer Switzerland

 Bad Bertrich: Switzerlands 

 players will have at least one world-beater cheering them 

 on as they begin their World Cup campaign against France 

 on Tuesday, with tennis icon Roger Federer hoping to be 

 at the match. World No.1 Federer, who plays Spains 

 Rafael Nadal in Sundays French Open final, is planning 

 to fly from next weeks Halle tournament to the Stuttgart 

 game, said Swiss officials.

 It will be great if he does 

 come because he can definitely be a role model for our team, 

 Switzerland goalkeeper Pascal Zuberbuehler said on Saturday. 

 When you look at his calmness on the court and his 

 style, I think its something that us footballers can 

 all learn from.

 Rogers a pretty good 

 footballer, so hopefully he can pull on his boots and join 

 us for a training session, Zuberbuehler added.

 Benitez on warpath over Cisse

 Berlin: Liverpool manager 

 Rafael Benitez wants Fifa regulations changed and his club 

 to be compensated for the broken leg suffered by their France 

 striker Djibril Cisse in a World Cup warm-up match with 

 China last week. Cisse was expected to leave Liverpool in 

 the close season but no transfer can now be arranged while 

 he recovers from the fracture that cost him his place in 

 Frances World Cup squad.

 Meanwhile, Cisse may travel to 

 the tournament to support his team. France team spokesman 

 Yann Le Guillard said that the idea had come from players 

 including Eric Abidal and that coach Raymond Domenech supported 

 the idea. It has been talked about but nothing has 

 been fixed yet, Le Guillard said. 

 Baros blow for Czechs

 Westerburg: From being 

 doubtful, striker Milan Baros has now almost 

 no chance of making the Czech Republics 

 opening World Cup game against the US. Baros did not participate 

 again in training Saturday, the seventh straight day he 

 has missed practice since straining a tendon in his left 

 foot in the first half of the final warm-up against Trinidad 

 and Tobago a week ago. Kept out of Saturdays training 

 session held behind close doors at the teams base 

 in the central German town of Westerburg, Czech team physician 

 Petr Krejci lost almost all hope Baros could be fit in time 

 for the opener.

 Martinez dream ends

 Walldorf: Costa Rica defender 

 Gilberto Martinez is out of the World Cup owing to a tendinitis 

 in left leg. Gilberto is out because we studied the 

 situation and determined there is no chance he will recover 

 in the next 10 days, Costa Rica coach Alexandre Guimaraes 

 said. Gilberto, with the bravery we all know he has, 

 admitted the situation and agreed to leave the team. 

 Gilberto said he was okay before the match on Friday. But 

 as the game progressed I started to feel the pain, 

 he said.

 unisian crisis deepens

 Schweinfurt: Tunisias 

 injury crisis deepened on Friday when defender Mehdi Meriah 

 joined striker Francileudo Santos on the injured list. Five 

 days before Tunisias World Cup opener against Saudi 

 Arabia, a scan confirmed an injury to Meriahs left 

 leg, the Tunisian soccer federation said on its Web site. 

 It was unclear how quickly he might recover. Coach Roger 

 Lemerre has been sweating on the fitness of Santos since 

 he pulled up during the North African sides last practice 

 match on Wednesday.

 Lahm inspired by Jordan

 Berlin: Michael Jordan 

 is providing inspiration at the World Cup. Relaxing on the 

 eve of the opening match of the World Cup with a buddy, 

 Germany defender Philipp Lahm watched a DVD of Jordans 

 career highlights. Lahms buddy, goalkeeper Timo Hildebrand, 

 then told him, Friday would be a good day to score 

 a goal. And thats exactly what Lahm did.

 Lahm scored the first goal of 

 the tournament six minutes into Friday opening 

 match in Munich, drifting past two defenders and curling 

 a right-foot shot off the far post into the goal from the 

 edge of the box. Germany went on to win 4-2.

 French surprise

 Paris: A vast majority 

 of French fans would be surprised if France were to become 

 world champions for the second time. A poll conducted by 

 the Ifop institute showed 66 per cent of the 1,003 asked 

 believed the 1998 champions would not go all the way in 

 in Germany. The poll, to be published on Sunday, showed 

 69 per cent wanted newcomer Franck Ribery to start Frances 

 opening match against Switzerland on Tuesday in Stuttgart.

 Indonesians upset

 Bantul (Indonesia): For 

 many soccer-crazed Indonesians who survived last months 

 devastating earthquake, not being able to watch the World 

 Cup is the final indignity. Our sorrows are complete, 

 Kusumo, 21, said Saturday as he sifted through the rubble 

 that was once his house. First the earthquake, then 

 the volcano, and now we have no televisions or radios to 

 follow the World Cup. The May 27 earthquake on Java 

 island killed more than 5,700 people and collapsed 80 percent 

 of the homes in hardest-hit Bantul district.

 France hopes boosted

 - Italy play out uninspired draw

Paris: France were given a timely boost before the World Cup with a 2-0 win over Denmark but Italy struggled against Switzerland in a tame 1-1 draw on Wednesday. Goals in either half from Thierry Henry and Sylvain Wiltord boosted French hopes of a repeat of their World Cup triumph in 1998. 

Italy looked uninspired during a 1-1 draw against the Swiss, while Saudi Arabia were done in by a goal from Galatasarays Necati Ates. 

Fellow finalists Trinidad and Tobago suffered an even more humiliating defeat, going down 1-3 to Slovenia, a sole Chris Birchall goal the only compensation. 

 Paraguay beat Georgia 1-0, while Iran ran out 5-2 victors in a seven-goal thriller against Bosnia-Herzegovina. 

 Iraq, meanwhile, have withdrawn from a warm-up match 

 with Tunisia for administrative reasons, the Tunisian federation 

 said on Thursday. The match was to be played on June 7. 

 The Iraqis were replacing Kuwait who had pulled out.

 Ronaldo rooting for Argentina-Brazil final

Rio de Janeiro: Brazil could win a record sixth World Cup in Germany this year. Real Madrid striker Ronaldo has personal ambitions as well. 

The three-time winner of Fifas Player of the Year award has scored 12 goals in World Cup play, two short of Gerd Mullers record. 

Im two goals away from equalling the record of the tournaments top scorer. If I score three, I pass everyone. Its a special motivation, he said in an interview with a Rio daily. 

Ronaldo also could join Pele as the only player on three World Cup champion teams. Pele played on Brazils title-winning sides in 1958, 1962 and 1970, while Ronaldo won titles in 1994 and 2002. 

He came close to a third title in 1998, but Ronaldo had unexplained convulsions on the day of the final. He played poorly, and Brazil lost 0-3 to hosts France. 

Ronaldo, 29, considers Brazil as the favourites this year. He heads an exceptionally talented attack that includes Inter Milans Adriano, Milans Kaka and Barcelonas Ronaldinho, Fifas Player of the Year the past two years.

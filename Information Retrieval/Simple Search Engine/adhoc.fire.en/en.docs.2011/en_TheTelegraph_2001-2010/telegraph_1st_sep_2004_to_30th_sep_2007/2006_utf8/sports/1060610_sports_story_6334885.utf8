The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Focus now on next match: Klinsmann

Munich: Miroslav Klose struck twice on his 28th birthday to lead Germany to a 4-2 win over Costa Rica on Friday, getting the World Cup off to a record-breaking start. 

The goal total broke the record for the most in the opening match of a finals tournament, surpassing the five scored in Frances 4-1 triumph over Mexico in the inaugural competition in 1930. 

At such a mega event like the World Cup, weve got to put this behind us quickly, coach Juergen Klinsmann said. The players can have a little glass of beer tonight if they want, but our focus has to turn right away to the next match (against Poland on Wednesday). Were happy with this start. 

Philipp Lahm, who fired hosts Germany to a dream start at the World Cup with the first goal praised the noisy home fans for their support. Its always important to start off with a win. You could see what euphoria there was in the stadium, the right back said. 

Part of the victory should be credited to the fans. They were the 12th man on the pitch. We scored four goals and thats important, but clearly we cant let so many goals in. 

Klinsmann said: Sure, there was some tension. We wanted to get through it without any yellow cards and we wanted to give the crowd something to cheer about

 Lanka board backs Pawar nomination for top ICC post

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: Few hours after Sharad Pawar filed nomination for the post of International Cricket Council (ICC) president, it appears that the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) chief is the favourite against his solitary contestant as of now David Morgan, chairman of the England and Wales Cricket Board. 

The neighbouring Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) has already said they will support Pawar 200 per cent. Speaking on behalf of the chairman of SLC, Jayantha Dharmadasa, PA Jeevika Fernando told The Telegraph that if Pawar becomes the president of ICC it will be a great honour for the Asian block. Well all love to seem him there 

In the ACC meeting Friday, Pawar agreed to file up the nomination after the four Asian Test playing nations reached a consensus to support the BCCI supremo. Confirming this, BCCI administrative officer Professor Ratnakar Shetty said: All the Asian Test playing nations (Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh) have agreed to support Pawar. 

By the way, the Indian board is expecting to get support from the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB), which was earlier said by its secretary Niranjan Shah. Away in Singapore Pawar and Shah could not be reached for comments. 

With the official deadline being January 1, the ICC is expecting few more nominations. ICC headquarters have informed that the relevant documents from the nominees (Pawar and Morgan) have been received and are being sent to A.C. Muttiah, the chairman of the six-member nomination committee for their decision. 

It maybe noted that ICC president Percy Sonns successor would be named by June next year, even as he would vacate the office in June 2008. Succeeding Pakistans Ehsan Mani, Sonn assumed charge in 2006. 

In case Pawar succeeds in his bid, he will be the seventh in the line after Lord Colin Cowdrey of England (1989-93), West Indian Sir Clyde Walcott (1993-97), Indias Jagmohan Dalmiya (1997-2000), Australias Malcolm Gray (2000-2003), Mani (2003-2006) and Sonn. Prior to the appointment of Cowdrey, ICC was administered by the secretary of the Marleybone Cricket Club.

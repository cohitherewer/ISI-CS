Shanghai: Jyoti Randhawa stole the thunder from world No. 1 Tiger Woods with a flawless seven-under 65 for a one-stroke lead on Day I of the $5 million HSBC Champions golf on Thursday. 

Randhawa fired seven birdies to lead by one stroke from South Koreas Yang Yong-eun, 2005 US Open champion Michael Campbell of New Zealand and Scotsman Marc Warren at the Sheshan International Club Course. 

Jeev Milkha Singh, playing alongside Woods and Paul Casey, enjoyed the satisfaction of out-scoring his more famous playing partner with a 70. 

Indias Shiv Kapur brought in a one-under 71, while compatriot Gaurav Ghei carded a par 72. Woods, who had new friend and mens tennis No. 1 Roger Federer watching him in the crowd, also had a 72 that included four birdies, two bogeys and a double bogey. 

Thailands Chawalit Plaphol ensured a strong Asian presence on the star-studded leaderboard with a 67 that was matched by Europe No. 1 Padraig Harrington of Ireland, in tied fifth place. 

Randhawa, who frequently indulges in high-speed biking in India, said catching up with his favourite pastime helped him relax ahead of the prestigious event. 

I did a lot of biking which has rejuvenated me, said Randhawa who lifted a second Hero Honda Indian Open title last month and then won the Bilt Open the following week on the Indian Tour. 

I was quite relaxed. I was focused. I played the way the golf course should be played. Its great to have gotten in a good round in a field like this, especially with Tiger here. 

Looking to emulate Jeevs stunning victory at the Volvo Masters in Spain a fortnight ago, Randhawa birdied all the par fives and enjoyed a chip-in birdie on the fourth. 

The presence of Federer, here to play in ATP Masters Cup, failed to inspire Woods as he left the course a frustrated man. Despite a superb start with an opening birdie from six feet, the American double bogeyed the next hole by hooking his drive into the jungle and took a penalty drop. 

Very frustrating because I was in great position to get to about four under and that would have been fine, said Woods. 

Ive got a lot of work to do. The course is playing a lot harder this year, its firm and fast. There are some pretty good numbers out there and if you make good putts, they are going in. It can be done. 

Roger is a great guy, weve become pretty good friends and its great of him to come out here and watch and support.

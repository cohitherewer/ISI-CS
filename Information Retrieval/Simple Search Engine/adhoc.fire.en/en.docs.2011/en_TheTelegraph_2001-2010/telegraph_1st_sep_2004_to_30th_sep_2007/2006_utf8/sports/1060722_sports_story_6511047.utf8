 Zambrotta, Thuram for Barcelona

Madrid: Barcelona have signed a deal with troubled Serie A club Juventus for Italy defender Gianluca Zambrotta and France defender Lilian Thuram, the Primera Liga club said on their website on Thursday. 

Zambrotta, 29, has agreed a four-year contract while 34-year-old Thuram has negotiated a two-year deal. 

Spanish media have reported that Barcelona will pay 14 million euros ($23.74 million) for the Italian and five million for the Frenchman. 

They become the European and Spanish champions second and third new recruits in the close season after Icelandic striker Eidur Gudjohnsen joined from Chelsea. 

Meanwhile, Barcelona president Joan Laporta has said he and his board will step down next Wednesday to set in motion a presidential election at the club, as ordered by a Spanish judge earlier in the week. 

In another development, Chelsea agreed Friday to sell defender Asier Del Horno to Spanish club Valencia.

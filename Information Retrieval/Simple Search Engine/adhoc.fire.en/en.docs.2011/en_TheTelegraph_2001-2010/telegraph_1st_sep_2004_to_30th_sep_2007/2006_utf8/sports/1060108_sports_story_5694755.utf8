 Sachin carries greater burden than Don: Greg

 Greg Chappell

Sydney: Looking back over the past eight months of his coaching stint with India, Greg Chappell says he was yet to fully grasp the enormity, complexity and occasional danger of his role. 

There is nothing like it in world cricket or even world sport, Chappell said. 

Maybe there are some similarities in Brazil with soccer but, then again, they arent dealing with these kind of numbers, he was quoted as saying by Sydney Morning Herald Saturday. 

The former Australian captain also said it was the expectation of a billion people and the often overpowering hype which proved just how resilient the Indian players were. 

Sachin Tendulkar carries a weight of collective expectation to the crease that few can comprehend. Bradman would not have had the weight of expectation that Sachin has on him everytime he went out to bat, he said. 

You cant just look at his statistical record. Thats not even close to summing up what he is and what he has done. 

He has been the great hope of this country for 16 or 17 years. Because India, as a team, has not been as successful as other teams over the years, the expectations of the nation have tended to shift onto the shoulders of the individuals, Chappell said. 

They have become the de facto team that everyone supports. Hopefully, the focus will shift back to the team rather than the individual with a long period of good results. I cant imagine living through what they live through, from a players perspective. 

You try living in India and carrying the expectations of a billion people on you every time you go out, Chappell said.

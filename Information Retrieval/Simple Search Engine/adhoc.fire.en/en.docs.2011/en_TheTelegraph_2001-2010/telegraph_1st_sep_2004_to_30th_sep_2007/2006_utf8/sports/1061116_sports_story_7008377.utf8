 Dhoni has set new standards, says Karthik

Benoni: Dinesh Karthik feels that Mahendra Singh Dhonis performance has raised the bar for wicketkeepers in the country. 

There is little doubt that Dhoni has set new standards for wicketkeeper-batsman in India. He hits so powerfully that he can clear any ground in the world. He has definitely been a major asset for the Indian team, said Karthik, the second wicketkeeper in the squad. 

However, the Tamil Nadu wicketkeeper said his technique would stand him in good stead in the tough tour. My seniors have praised me for my technique and that is a boost. I think on wickets such as the ones you have in South Africa, you need technique to survive and score runs. Technique would matter a lot. 

He emphatically denied that the flamboyance of Dhoni has put pressure on his batting. I dont think his flamboyance has put any pressure on me. He bats in his own way and I bat in my way. I can only do well if I bat in my own style and similarly he would do well if he follows his methods. 

Karthik said he focussed on being consistent in batting at the domestic level to force his comeback. When I spoke to the seniors, they said I needed to score consistently in domestic cricket and thats exactly what I did. (PTI)

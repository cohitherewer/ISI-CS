 Anticipatory bail for Vijayan

Thrissur: Former India football captain I.M. Vijayan, wanted by police in connection with an assault case, was on Thursday granted anticipatory bail by the district sessions court here. 

A complaint had been lodged against Vijayan and five others for allegedly assaulting the workers of a bar-attached tourist home here on August 13 midnight after trespassing into their lodge room. 

Earlier in the day, police had said that Vijayan was absconding and all efforts were being made to nab the star footballer. (PTI)

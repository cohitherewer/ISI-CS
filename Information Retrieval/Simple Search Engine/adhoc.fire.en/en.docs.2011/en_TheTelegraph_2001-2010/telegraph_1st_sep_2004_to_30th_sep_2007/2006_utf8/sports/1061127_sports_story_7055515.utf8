 Nel exclusion infuriates Smith

Cape Town: South Africa won the third ODI convincingly on Sunday to take an unbeatable 2-0 lead in the five-game series. But a row involving skipper Graeme Smith and convenor of selectors Haroon Lorgat marred the fine recovery by the hosts. 

The showdown, which took place 15 minutes before the toss, was over the inclusion of Andrew Hall in place of Andre Nel for the Newlands game. 

Nel played a key role in South Africas crushing 157-run victory, bowling with a lot of fire to return figures of four for 13. He hurt a finger on Saturday, but having passed a fitness test after bowling in the nets Sunday morning, he was almost certain to play until the team management was told that Hall should be brought in for the game. 

A furious Smith had to be pacified by Jacques Kallis and Gordon Templeton, the media manager. 

That the incident angered Smith and affected his focus was obvious from his second-ball dismissal. 

The body language of senior pros like Mark Boucher suggested they were also peeved by the last-minute change.

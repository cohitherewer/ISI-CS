 Quick Takes

 Italy, England best bets among Europeans, 

 says Pele

 Mexico City: Footballing 

 great Pele has said he fancied Brazil to win the World Cup. 

 For me, Brazil is the best team but its not 

 easy to win the World Cup, he told a press conference 

 on Monday. Italy and England are very good and are 

 the two European teams that have the greatest chance. 

 France could also do something. 

 Because they didnt finish the last World Cup as it 

 was expecting it could arrive with the best intentions. 

 There are some players of great talent like Zinedine Zidane 

 and David Trezeguet. 

 Hotel to cash in on samba 

 stars

 Zurich: Do you fancy spending 

 a night in the same hotel room that Ronaldinho, star of 

 Brazils World Cup squad, has just slept in?

 If so, make your bid in an eBay 

 online auction launched by a luxury hotel in central Switzerland 

 where the Brazilian team will set up training camp next 

 Monday. The highest bid so far for Ronaldinhos double 

 room is 502 Swiss francs ($415). 

 Lahm injured

 Mannheim: Germany defender 

 Philipp Lahm was taken to hospital on Tuesday after injuring 

 his left elbow in a fall during a practice match against 

 amateur side Luckenwalde. We dont know how serious 

 it is yet but hope that he will be able to fly with us to 

 our training camp in Sardinia, Juergen Klinsmann said. 

 Lahm was racing towards the Luckenwalde goal when he tripped 

 over a defender and landed hard on his left arm. Germany 

 won the match 7-0.

 Refs to spot streakers

 Berlin: World Cup organisers 

 will employ pitch-side referees to spot streakers before 

 they disrupt games. Referees and German football association 

 (DFB) members will be seated in areas near the pitch and 

 assigned to keep an eye on the crowd around them, Germanys 

 organising committee said. Nine of the 12 World Cup venues 

 have also introduced physical barriers to deter streakers. 

 Goleo maker insolvent

 Berlin: The German manufacturer 

 of World Cup mascot Goleo has declared itself 

 insolvent. German media reports said sluggish demand for 

 the cuddly toy lion was partly responsible for the firms 

 problems.

 The firm cited its inability to 

 make payments as its reason for filing for insolvency, a 

 spokesman for the district court in Coburg said.

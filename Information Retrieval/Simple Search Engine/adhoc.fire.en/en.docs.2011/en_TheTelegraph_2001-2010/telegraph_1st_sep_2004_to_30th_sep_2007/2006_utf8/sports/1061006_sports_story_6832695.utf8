The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 England need Rooney to fire

 - EURO QUALIFIERS 

 - Italy aim to rediscover winning ways vs Ukraine 

London: Striker Wayne Rooney will need to put suspension and a loss of form firmly behind him when England take on Macedonia in Saturdays Euro 2008 qualifier. 

England play host to a Macedonia side they only managed to beat 1-0 away last month in Rooneys absence and who can be guaranteed to make life difficult again at Old Trafford. 

Rooney, who also missed Englands opening Group E win over Andorra owing to his red card in their World Cup exit to Portugal, has not had a particularly happy start to the season for club or country. 

However, England coach Steve McClaren has made it clear that his support for such a gifted talent is unswerving, despite the sometimes volatile temper that comes with it. 

Players have to be playing well and have to be in form but Rooney is a world-class player and can make the difference at any given moment, McClaren said. Hes in my team. 

That team is being tweaked in all departments, with Jermain Defoe making way for Rooney, Scott Parker tipped to stand in for injured Owen Hargreaves as a defensive midfielder and fit-again Gary Neville taking over from brother Phil at right back. 

Parker faces competition for the holding role from Rooneys club teammate Michael Carrick, whose unhurried passing impressed at the World Cup. 

However, Parkers energetic box-to-box performances for Newcastle this season could well tip the balance, particularly in a game where England will need to harry a side who are expected to pack the final third. 

Whoever is chosen will give Frank Lampard the freedom to get forward, with the midfielders promising return to form with Chelsea coming just at the right time for his country. 

Steven Gerrard will again take the right midfield slot once filled by Beckham, who is still out of the squad despite an injury to Gerrards understudy Aaron Lennon. 

Meanwhile, world champions Italy, having stumbled at the start of their Euro 2008 qualifying campaign, are aiming to rediscover their World Cup form against Ukraine in Rome on Saturday. 

Roberto Donadonis team drew at home to Lithuania and lost away to France in their opening two Group B qualifiers and now face opponents they beat on their way to success in Germany in July. 

Italy beat Ukraine 3-0 in their quarter final in Hamburg and striker Luca Toni, who scored twice in that game, believes the Azzurri still have the same desire for success. 

Although Donadoni, who replaced World Cup winning coach Marcello Lippi who stood down following the triumph in Berlin, is still without Francesco Totti, he has 18 of the World Cup squad available for Saturdays match at the Olympic stadium. 

Alessandro Del Piero, playing in Serie B with Juventus, returns along with Toni. The pair could start in attack while in defence an injury to left back Fabio Grosso means that Barcelonas Gianluca Zambrotta is likely to switch flanks to left back. 

Italy lie sixth out of seven teams with one point from two matches, five points behind joint leaders France and Scotland. 

Ukraine striker Andriy Shevchenko, known well to the Italians after his seven seasons with AC Milan, is suffering from a high temperature and could miss the match. 

Coach Oleg Blokhin also has to contend with injuries to Sergei Rebrov and Ruslan Rotan of Dynamo Kiev. 

Despite his expectation of a tough, physical challenge, France coach Raymond Domenech, meanwhile, is eyeing a six-point return from Scotland to help provide a cushion for the tough finale of their Euro 2008 Group B campaign. 

The French have made an impressive start to their qualifying bid with a 3-0 victory over Georgia in Tbilisi and a 3-1 home win over world champions Italy in Paris last month. 

Scotland are above them on goal difference thanks to their 6-0 thrashing of Faroe Islands 6-0 and a 2-1 win in Lithuania and Domenech knows his side will have to fight for everything in Glasgow on Saturday. 

France snatched a 1-0 victory at Lansdowne Road in September 2005, a result which proved decisive in the qualification for this years World Cup. 

The only difference is that now we dont have the knife at our throat. Against Ireland, we had no choice but to win, Domenech said. 

Since the retirement of Zinedine Zidane after the World Cup, Domenech has returned to a 4-4-2 line-up built on the combined midfield talents of Claude Makelele and captain Patrick Vieira. 

We have found a good balance. The team is feeling pretty well and Im not going to make changes for the sake of it, Domenech said. 

The only change from the side which started against Italy last month could be the return of striker David Trezeguet up front as Sidney Govou and Louis Saha are struggling with injuries. Nicolas Anelka could also get another taste of international football after a late call-up to the squad. 

The much-travelled former Paris St Germain, Arsenal, Real Madrid and Liverpool forward will join Frances training camp in Clairefontaine later on Thursday. 

Anelka, 27, has scored seven goals in 31 internationals but has always had a rocky relationship with the national team.

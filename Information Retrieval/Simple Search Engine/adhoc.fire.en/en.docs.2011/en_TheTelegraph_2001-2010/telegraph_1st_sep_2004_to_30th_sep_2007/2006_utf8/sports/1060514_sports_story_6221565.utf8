 Liverpool win on penalties

 - FA Cup Final

 Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard lifts the FA Cup after defeating West Ham United in the final at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff on Saturday 

Cardiff: Liverpool won the FA Cup for the seventh time on Saturday when they beat West Ham United 3-1 on penalties after the teams were level at 3-3 after extra time. Liverpool keeper Jose Reina saved three of the four West Ham penalties he faced, becoming the hero after handing West Ham two goals with errors earlier in the match. 

The Spaniard saved from Bobby Zamora, Paul Konchesky and Anton Ferdinand while Liverpool scored three of their four attempts as the final was decided on penalties for the second successive season. 

One of the greatest of all the 125 FA Cup finals was taken into extra time by a stunning last-minute 30-metre shot by Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard, who also converted a shoot-out penalty. 

West Ham had blasted into a two goal lead when Jamie Carragher turned a low cross into his own goal after 20 minutes and Dean Ashton pounced eight minutes later after Liverpool keeper Jose Reina spilled a Matthew Etherington shot. 

Djibril Cisse pulled one back after 32 minutes and Gerrard, whose pinpoint pass led to that goal, equalised with a thunderous shot in the 54th as both teams poured everything into attack. West Ham regained the lead when Paul Koncheskys attempted cross from the left caught out Reina and curved into the top corner in the 64th minute. 

West Hams fans were singing to acclaim their first FA Cup triumph since 1980 until Gerrards brilliant intervention.

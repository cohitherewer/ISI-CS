Bangalore: Team India will explore novel ways of training at Yelahanka ? an air force base camp on the outskirts outside Bangalore city on Wednesday to kick off the conditioning camp for next months tri-series in Sri Lanka. 

Although the team management refused to reveal the venue for the three-day programme aimed at encouraging teaming up among players, highly placed sources said the squad would be heading off to the base camp which also houses the BSF and CRPF cantonments. 

Wednesday morning, the boys will leave for a place outside Bangalore for teaming up and doing physical training. It will not be open to the media, trainer Gregory King said on Tuesday. 

King said the team management favoured adopting new techniques of training. 

It is a management decision to try out new things. In the past too, we tried out some new routines which produced positive results, he said. 

I do not wish to inform the players exactly about what we are going to do in the next three days. It wont be very different from the camps we had in the last three years, he said. 

The players will be back to the NCA premises in Bangalore on Friday. 

On Saturday morning, they will be put through medical, skill-specific and body composition assessments. 

King said since the three-day training session would be very demanding in nature, there would be a recovery session ? yoga, swimming and teki ? in the evening on Saturday. 

Teki is a good method of training. It is all about balance and focus. The players wont have normally encountered these before, he said. 

After the recovery session, the media will be briefed about the training camp held outside the city. 

On Sunday, there will be a closed-door fitness assessment session at NCA followed by nets in the afternoon. The cricketers would have a trip to the defence sports unit close to Bangalore the next day. 

 The conditioning camp will conclude 

 on August 1. Coach Greg Chappell, holidaying in the US, 

 will join the team on August 4. 

King made it clear that choosing a place outside Bangalore had nothing to do with the facilities at NCA. 

NCA is not lacking in anything. We are only trying to do something new which I cant elaborate, he said. 

On Sachin Tendulkars fitness, King said the maestro has recovered fully. 

John (Gloster) told me Sachins fitness level is normal. The man himself would not have been available if he was not fit. From my own perspective, I will be watching Sachin in action, he said. 

Explaining the reason behind choosing Bangalore ahead of Chennai for the training camp, King said the Tamil Nadu capital was not selected as venue owing to threat of rains. 

 Last time, we wasted some 

 days due to rain. Besides, this time we have a lot of time 

 to acclimatise in Colombo before the tournament.

 Meanwhile in Mumbai, off-spinner 

 Harbhajan Singh blamed poor Indian batting for the defeat 

 in ODI series in the West Indies. They (West Indies) 

 were not scoring more than 240-250, which are scores we 

 should be successfully chasing any day with the kind of 

 batting we have.

 But the offie hopes that India will bounce back and win 

 an overdue trophy in next months triangular series 

 in Sri Lanka. South Africa are the third team in the August 

 14-29 tournament.

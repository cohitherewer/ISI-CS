 Atwal way down

 - Florida Classic 

Lake Buena Vista (Florida): Arjun Atwals attempt to secure his playing card for next year continued to suffer as he managed only a two-under 70 in the opening round of the Funai Classic Walt Disney World Resort Tournament. 

Atwal, who had three birdies and one bogey in his 70, was tied 70th at Palm Course. Atwal needs to get inside top-125 to get a full card next season as he is currently 138th on the money list. 

Daniel Chopra, runner-up last week, opened with a three-under 69 at Magnolia Course and was tied 52nd after five birdies and two bogeys. 

The highlight of the day was a 12-under 60 by Justin Rose at Disneys Palm Course.

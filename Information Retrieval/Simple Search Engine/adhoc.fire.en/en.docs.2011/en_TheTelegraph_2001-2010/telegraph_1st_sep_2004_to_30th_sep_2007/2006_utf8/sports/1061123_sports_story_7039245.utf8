 Sudhakar upsets Wu

 COMMONWEALTH CHESS 

Mumbai: Grandmasters Wu Shaobin of Singapore, Zia-ur Rahman of Bangladesh and Indias RB Ramesh committed costly errors and lost to unfancied opponents in the third round of the Commonwealth Chess Championship in Suburban Borivali on Wednesday. 

Wu continued his poor run in the tournament when he followed up his drawn second round game with a shock loss to Indian International Master Sudhakar Babu while Rahman was beaten by Indias Woman Grand Master S. Meenakshi. 

Ramesh went down to Praveen Kumar on a day when ten-year-old sensation from Vijayawada GV Saikrishna suffered his first defeat in three days at the hands of IM Saptarshi Roy Chowdhary. 

Two of the top Indian GMs, Sandipan Chanda and Dibyendu Barua also suffered minor setbacks when they were forced to split points with lower rated GN Gopal and Shashikant Kutwal, respectively. 

In fact, Kutwal was having a pawn advantage against Barua but could not convert the same to a win due to time pressure. 

Top seeded GM Nigel Short of Britain gave a superb display while cracking the Sicilian Dragon Defence of Saptarshi Roy in just 30 moves while current national champion, GM Surya Sekhar Ganguly proved too good with black pieces against IM S. Satyapragyan with his commendable pre-tournament preparations. 

At the end of three rounds in the $14,000-tournament, sponsored by public sector undertakings LIC, ONGC and MTNL, eleven players shared the lead with full points in the 168-player draw. (PTI)

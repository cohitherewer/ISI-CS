Lahore: The West Indies faced an innings defeat at the close of the third day of the first Test on Monday after paceman Umar Gul reduced them to 74 for three in their second innings. 

The tourists still trail Pakistan by 205 after Mohammed Yousuf scored 192 in his teams first innings of 485 all out. West Indies were dismissed for 206 in their first innings. 

Gul, who took five for 65 in the first innings, captured the key wickets of Chris Gayle (11) and Ramnaresh Sarwan (23) as the West Indies struggled to avoid an innings defeat. 

Pakistans only concern is the ominous form of Windies captain Brian Lara, who followed up his first innings of 61 with an unbeaten 28 including four boundaries when play ended 20 overs early. 

Forty-four overs have so far been lost in the Test due to bad light. 

Lara played some glorious shots and also displayed classic defence after Daren Ganga had been run out in the third over for five. In the next over, Gayle was caught behind to leave the visitors on a precarious 20 for two. 

Sarwan, who had been playing well, was given out leg-before by Sri Lankan umpire Asoka de Silva although television replays suggested the ball would have gone over the stumps. 

The West Indies began their second innings 25 minutes before tea after a spectacular seventh wicket stand of 148 from 230 balls between Yousuf and Kamran Akmal (78). 

West Indies coach Bennett King said he thought his team was still in the game. 

We need to buckle down, we still have a fair bit of batting left. If we can apply ourselves on this pitch we can put some runs on the board and put them under pressure, he said. 

I am not surprised at the disciplined bowling by Pakistans reserve bowlers Umer Gul and Shahid Nazir. They know how to bowl on these sort of pitches. 

Yousuf, who resumed on 107, got a third let-off on 114 when Lara floored him at second slip off the luckless Corey Collymore. He had previously given chances on 43 and 101. His marathon innings took 504 minutes and 330 balls with 24 fours and one six.

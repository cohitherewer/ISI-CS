 Bengal tumble in semis 

 - National One-Day Meet

 Pauls three for 44 was not enough for Bengal 

Lucknow: Bengal had a bad day in office and made an unceremonious exit from the national one-day meet on Sunday. 

At the K.D. Singh Babu Stadium, Deep Dasgupta amp; Co. suffered a huge 101-run defeat by Railways in the semi-finals. Sourav Ganguly failed, so did his teammates as Bengal were folded out for 165 in just 38.4 overs, in reply to Railways 266 for 8. 

No excuse, we simply failed to rise to the occasion, Bengal manager Samir Dasgupta said after the match. 

Electing to bat, Railways captain Sanjay Bangar and Amit Pagnis put 83 for the first wicket. Amit (31) was removed by Shib Shankar Paul while Bangar (44) was picked by Sourashish Lahiri. 

Tejinder Pal Singh then steadied the ship with an unbeaten 90 off 104 balls, which included six hits to the fence. 

Bengal bowlers, however, checked the run-flow at the death overs by taking five wickets ? four of those Railways batsmen were unable to reach double figures. 

Deep took recourse to various bowling options and used as many as eight bowlers, including Souravs four overs for 23. 

Paul returned the most impressive figures of 10-0-44-3. 

Chasing the target, Sourav and Subhamoy Das seemed to have started from where they left in the previous match against Punjab. In a flying start, they put on 62 in 12.5 overs before Subhamoy (39) was trapped leg before by M. Yadav. 

Sourav, who had hit an unbeaten 89 in the quarter final tie in Kanpur, lost his wicket in next over when Harvinder Singh castled him. The former India captains 22 came off 32 balls and included three boundaries. 

Bengal thinktank, in a desperate measure, promoted Sourashish and Manoj Tewari up the order to accelerate scoring, but both failed. Rohan Gavaskar (10) and Deep (10) couldnt sustain the pressure either. 

However, Bengal lost the plot in as early as the 14th over, following Souravs dismissal. Three more wickets fell within six overs ? a setback from which Bengal never managed to recover.

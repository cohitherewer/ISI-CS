 Younis should replace Inzy: Intikhab

Karachi: Former Pakistan skipper Intikhab Alam demanded the scalp of incumbent Inzamam-ul Haq on Wednesday, saying it was time to hand over the reins to a more enthusiastic Younis Khan. 

Inzamam has not been able to motivate his teammates in the recent series, Intikhab was quoted as saying in a Pakistan daily. He has rarely appeared involved with the proceedings on the field and has not led from the front, he said. 

The former allrounder said the time has come to replace Inzamam with Younis who had shown the qualities of becoming a fine skipper. 

Younis looks more enthusiastic on the field and he is always making things happen. He should at once be handed the control of the team as the World Cup is less than a year away, said Intikhab. (PTI)

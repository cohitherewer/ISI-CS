 Fransa jolt to players 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: With the All India Football Federation (AIFF) deadline for the transfer of players coming to an end on Sunday, Fransa Club chairman Micky Pacheco on Saturday flatly refused to sign the transfer papers, leaving the footballers high and dry. 

Around a dozen Fransa footballers, led by skipper Cressan Antao and veteran goalkeeper Virender Singh met Pacheco in Goa on Saturday morning, but failed to persuade him to sign the transfer papers of players who were willing to shift to other clubs. 

Former East Bengal player Akshay Das, who signed for Fransa this season, however, proved luckier than others. He cited family problems and wanted the money immediately.

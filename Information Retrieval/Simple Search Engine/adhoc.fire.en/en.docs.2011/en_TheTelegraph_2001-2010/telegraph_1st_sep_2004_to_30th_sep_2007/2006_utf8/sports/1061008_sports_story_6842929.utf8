Calcutta: Shaharyar Khans resignation as Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman wont affect the joint hosting of the 2011 World Cup by Asias four Test-playing nations. 

Shaharyar had been one of the key players when the joint bid got the International Cricket Councils approval some months ago. 

Of course, individuals do matter, but Boards provide the continuity I dont foresee any problems, former Board of Control for Cricket in India president Inderjit Singh Bindra told The Telegraph on Saturday. 

Bindra, whod himself lobbied hard in Dubai, added: There had been changes in the PCB both before the 1987 and 1996 World Cups, but the events went off smoothly It should be the same this time as well. 

While the 1987 World Cup was jointly hosted by India and Pakistan, the 1996 edition had been co-hosted by India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Bangladesh is the addition for 2011. 

Bindra, who heads the Punjab Cricket Association, pointed out that in keeping with tradition, he would invite the present PCB chairman (Dr Nasim Ashraf) and his predecessors Shaharyar included for Pakistans matches in Mohali. 

Pakistan are scheduled to make two Champions Trophy league appearances (versus New Zealand and South Africa) there. Mohali, by the way, is also going to host the first semi-final.

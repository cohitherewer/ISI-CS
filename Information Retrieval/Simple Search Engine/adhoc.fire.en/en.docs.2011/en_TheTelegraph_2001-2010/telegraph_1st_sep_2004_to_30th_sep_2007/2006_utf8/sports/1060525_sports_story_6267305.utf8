Calcutta: Brazilian striker Jose Ramirez Barreto, who has been part of a an NFL winning team for the third time (twice for Mohun Bagan and once for Mahindra United), indicated that he could turn out for his old club Mohun Bagan in the coming season. 

Barreto was a member of the Mohun Bagan side when it lifted the NFL title in 1999-00 and 2001-02 and also played a stellar role for champions Mahindra United in the just concluded edition. 

There is a possibility, a beaming Barreto said at a function in a city hotel on Wednesday. 

Ever since the group led by general secretary Anjan Mitra came to power in Mohun Bagan, speculation has been rife that Barreto would rejoin his old club. But Barreto admitted that the just concluded season was the best in his career so far in this country. 

Meanwhile, the Adidas Challenge, a five-a-side soccer tournament would be staged at the Rabindra Sarobar Stadium on Friday and Saturday. The winners of the leg would participate in the national final at the same venue on Sunday. 

The national winners would represent India at the global finals to be staged in Berlin from July 1-4. The tournament is being held in seven cities across the country.

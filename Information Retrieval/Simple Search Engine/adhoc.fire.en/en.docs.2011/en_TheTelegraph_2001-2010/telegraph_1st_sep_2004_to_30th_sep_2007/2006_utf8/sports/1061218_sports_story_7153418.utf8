The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 After a good innings, Dalmiya should have given it all up

 - We remember him as being the driving force behind our re-admission into world cricket: Dr Bacher 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Jagmohan Dalmiya with Dr Ali Bacher 

Johannesburg: Former International Cricket Council president Jagmohan Dalmiya is the only Indian cricket administrator who was mentioned by name when Dr Ali Bacher spoke about South Africa-India relations (his speech, though, was pre-recorded) and more during an awards ceremony here last Thursday. 

He had kind words for somebody whom hed worked with. 

On Sunday, a day after the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) banned its former head for life, Bacher had this to tell The Telegraph: Id made a couple of trips to India last year and could sense a very strong anti-Dalmiya sentiment among officials... 

That the BCCI took the decision with a 29-2 majority says its own story... Clearly, Dalmiya has lost all his friends... Its for Raj Singh Dungarpur, (Inderjit Singh) Bindra and (A.C.) Muthiah to say why they, in particular, fell out with him... 

Dalmiya did good, made India an economic power in world cricket, but I feel he stayed on too long... After a good innings, he should have given it all up... He was, of course, the one person who didnt believe in the word no and we remember him as being the driving force behind our re-admission into world cricket in 1991... 

Dr Bacher, it may be recalled, is a former South African captain and managing director of the United Cricket Board (now Cricket South Africa).

 Murali is tougher than Warne, feels Flintoff

 Full-time captaincy too great a workload for Fintoff, feels Waugh 

London: England allrounder Andrew Flintoff says Muttiah Muralidharan is tougher to play than Shane Warne and that the Sri Lankan must be spared further insinuations about his bowling action. 

Im not saying I find Warney easy but Murali is the bowler who has given me most problems over the years, Flintoff said ahead of Englands first Test against Sri Lanka starting at Lords on May 11. 

Flintoff said it was time that people just focussed on the achievements of his former Lancashire club teammate. 

His action has been cleared and its time everyone just focussed on his achievements, Flintoff was quoted as saying in BCC Sport. 

I have total respect for him. I know he has been hurt by the criticism over the years but he knows there wont be any from me. 

Sri Lanka are to play three Tests and five one-day Internationals from May 11 to July 1. 

The 34-year-old Muralidharan, Test crickets second highest wicket-taker with 614 scalps, said he wanted to make the most of what could be his last tour of England. 

It could be the last tour for me. We may not be back until 2009 or 2010. How long my career will last I dont know, so I have to make it memorable, he said. 

I hope I can play for another three years. Ill see after the World Cup how things go.

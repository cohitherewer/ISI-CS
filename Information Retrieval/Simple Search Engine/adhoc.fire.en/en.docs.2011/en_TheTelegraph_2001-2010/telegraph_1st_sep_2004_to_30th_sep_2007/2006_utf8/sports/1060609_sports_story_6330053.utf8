New Delhi: Salgaocar coach Savio Medeira is set to become Indias assistant coach next week, according to AIFF sources. 

Medeira, who is arriving in the capital from Goa on Friday to attend the launch of Indias World Cup project for 2010, being organised jointly by the I amp; B Ministry and the AIFF, is likely to meet Alberto Colaco on Saturday to finalise the deal. 

It was learnt that Mahindra United coach Derrick Pereira is also interested in the job, but his chances are bleak, as the Mumbai team management is not ready to release him for the entire season. 

Mohun Bagan coach Biswajit Bhattacharya has already expressed his inability to take up the post. 

 While Medeira maintained that he would only give his consent after obtaining permission from his employers, he also made no secret of his desire to be attached with the Indian team. I am keen on the assistant coachs job. It will be a good learning experience under Houghton, he said. 

Dr Gagan Kapoor is likely to be appointed physio of the national team. Pradeep Dutta may be given the job of physical instructor. 

Meanwhile a host of former internationals will watch the World Cup opener between Germany and Costa Rica live on television at the Doordarshan Bhawan. 

The I amp; B Minister and AIFF president, Priyaranjan Das Munshi will also launch his plans for Indias 2010 World Cup qualification project on this occasion.

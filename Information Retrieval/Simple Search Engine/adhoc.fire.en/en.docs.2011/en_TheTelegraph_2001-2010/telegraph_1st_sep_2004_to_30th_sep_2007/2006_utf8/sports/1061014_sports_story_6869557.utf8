 3-month ban for champion

London: Britains world triathlon champion Tim Don has been given a three-month ban for missing three drugs tests and faces a lifetime ban from the Olympics, the British Triathlon Association (BTA) said on Friday. 

The 28-year-old, who won the world title in Lausanne a month ago, competed in the 2000 and 2004 Olympics but is now set to be ruled out of any future Games under the British Olympic Associations (BOA) strict anti-doping rules. 

However, he said he did not plan to appeal against the three-month BTA ban, given after he missed three out-of-competition tests. 

I have never taken, or even considered taking, a performance-enhancing drug in my life, Don said in a statement. 

I fully understand that it is my responsibility as a professional athlete to log my whereabouts on the UK Sport system and accept that it is due to my forgetfulness and lack of understanding of the online system following its launch last year that I have received this ban. 

Norman Brook, chief executive of British Triathlon, said: There is no suggestion that Tim Don was guilty of anything other than forgetfulness. (Reuters)

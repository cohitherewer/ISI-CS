 Federer, Nadal in semis; Bhupathi up

Monte Carlo: Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal are one match away from their first clash of the season on Friday after clinical wins in the quarter finals of the Monte Carlo Masters. 

Swiss world No. 1 Federer outclassed David Ferrer of Spain 6-1, 6-3 in 61 minutes, while defending champion and No. 2 Nadal defeated Argentine Guillermo Coria 6-2, 6-1. 

Federer will play Chilean Fernando Gonzalez, the No. 12 seed who beat fourth-seeded Ivan Ljubicic of Croatia 7-5, 6-1. Nadal will face Gaston Gaudio after the seventh-seeded Argentine, winner of the 2004 French Open, defeated Spains Tommy Robredo 6-1, 6-3. 

In doubles, Federer and fellow-Swiss came a cropper against Mahesh Bhupathi and Radek Stepanek. The Indo-Czech pair won 6-4, 7-5 to reach the semis. 

Nadal, the French Open champion, picked up his 40th consecutive win on clay which puts him joint third with Austrian Thomas Muster of Austria on the all-time list headed by Argentine Guillermo Vilas who won 53 in a row. 

Nadal won 11 games in a row to lead 6-2, 5-0 before Coria escaped a humiliating 6-0 defeat with a last-gasp effort and saved two match-points in the next game. The Spaniard sealed the match on the third. 

Federer clinched his quarter final on his first match point, dominating eighth seed Ferrer throughout.

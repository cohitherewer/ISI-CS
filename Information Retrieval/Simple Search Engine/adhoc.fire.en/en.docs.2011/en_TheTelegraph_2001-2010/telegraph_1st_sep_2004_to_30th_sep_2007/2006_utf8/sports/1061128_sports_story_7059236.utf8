 202 at Lords my best knock

 - Yousuf to gun for Vivs record in second innings 

Karachi: Pakistans prolific batsman Mohammed Yousuf Monday rated his double century at Lords this year as the best among his record-breaking eight hundreds in 2006. 

I think 202 at Lords was my best, Yousuf said. 

The 32-year-old, right-handed Yousuf made an elegant 102 with 15 fours Monday on an unpredictable low bouncy wicket of the National Stadium on the first day of the third and final Test against the West Indies. 

He became the first batsman in Test history to score eight centuries in a calendar year surpassing the West Indies Viv Richards and Sri Lankan Aravinda de Silvas record of seven centuries from 11 Test matches in 1976 and 1997, respectively. 

No batsman can match the batting qualities of Richards, Yousuf said. Beating the record of Richards is a big thing for me because hes the best player of this era. 

Wickets all around the world nowadays usually favour the batsman, but I want to score on difficult wickets, Yousuf said. 

Mondays century was Yousufs fifth successive century in Tests and he has joined South African Jacques Kallis in number two spot in scoring the most consecutive Test hundreds. 

Yousuf needs another 47 runs to break Richards record of most Test runs in a calendar year after he raised his run-tally in 2006 to 1,664. Lots of people have told me about this record and I would try to break it in the second innings, Yousuf said. 

Meanwhile, the West Indies captain Brian Lara on Monday expressed hope that next years World Cup will bring new hope for the Caribbean Islands both on and off the field. 

The World Cup is a watershed moment in our cricket Not only for the practical side of it on the field, but financially and administratively, we think the World Cup is going to be the sort of kickstart, something very much needed, Lara said. 

The corporate world in the West Indies is not as great as in India or the subcontinent, but were depending a lot on the revenues coming out of the World Cup to move us forward, he added. (AP)

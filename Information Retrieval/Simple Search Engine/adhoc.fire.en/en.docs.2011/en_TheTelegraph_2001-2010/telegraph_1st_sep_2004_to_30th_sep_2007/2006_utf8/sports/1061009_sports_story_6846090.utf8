 Its gods gift: Alonso

Suzuka: World champion Fernando Alonso hailed his surprise Japanese Grand Prix victory as a gift from God on Sunday after an engine failure left Michael Schumachers Formula One title hopes in tatters. 

Not only Monza where we lost points, I think we had very unlucky moments in Hungary as well and in some other places. We lost a lot of points in bad luck moments, he said. 

For sure these 10 points are a little present that God gave to us, he added after his seventh win of the season but first since Canada in June. 

Alonso had led last weekend in China only to lose out to Schumacher after he and the team made a wrong tyre choice at his first pitstop. 

In Monza he was penalised five places to 10th on the starting grid for allegedly impeding Ferraris Felipe Massa in qualifying and was then sidelined when his engine blew. 

The 25-year-old led in Hungary before a wheel nut came loose and pitched him out. 

Alonso said Schumachers engine failure, the seven time champions first since the 2000 French Grand Prix, was the surprise of the race. 

I just didnt believe what I was seeing. Victory means a lot, not only for me and the team as well, getting back their confidence. We deserved this victory a long time ago, I think. 

When you win it is a really happy moment and this victory is even better because it was a complete surprise, said the Spaniard, who danced a jig on his car after parking up. 

Ferraris Michael Schumacher wrote off his chances of winning a record eighth Formula One championship. 

Weve got to see that as clearly as it is, because we all know that Fernando only needs one point now, said the 37-year-old.That means itll be more or less a walk in the park for him now and go easy on everything. Ive digested it already, he said of the failure.

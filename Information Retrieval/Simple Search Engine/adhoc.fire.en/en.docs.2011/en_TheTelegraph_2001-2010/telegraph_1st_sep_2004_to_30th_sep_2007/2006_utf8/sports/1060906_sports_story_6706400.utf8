 ICC relaxes deadline for England 

 Champions Trophy

 London: England were given 

 at least three more days to name their squad for the Champions 

 Trophy on Tuesday due to injury concerns.

 The International Cricket Council 

 (ICC) has given England until the end of their five-match 

 one-day series against Pakistan to name a 14-man squad. 

 The last match is Sunday. The original deadline had been 

 on Thursday.

 We are extremely grateful 

 to the ICC for this concession, England chairman of 

 selectors David Graveney said. We have collected injuries 

 during this series and we will now have more time to evaluate 

 some of the replacements. (AP)

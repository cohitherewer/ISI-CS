 Italy

 Founded: 1898 

 Affiliated: 1905 

 A new generation emerges

 With three World Cups to their 

 name, Italy are rightly held as one of the great football 

 nations. Their first triumph was way back in 1934 at the 

 second ever global showcase held on Italian soil. Four years 

 later in France, they became the first team to successfully 

 defend their crown and their third title was secured in 

 1982 in Spain. 

 Germany will mark Italys 

 16th appearance at a World Cup finals, making Sweden 1958 

 the only finals they did not grace with their presence. 

 Following their successes in 1934 

 and 1938, Italy lifted the World Cup for the third time 

 in Spain in 1982 thanks largely to an outstanding performance 

 by striker Paolo Rossi. After a subdued start to the tournament, 

 Rossi burst into life in the knockout stages, scoring a 

 hattrick against Brazil to put his side through to the semi-final, 

 where he struck twice more against Poland. Brimming with 

 confidence, the Italians then went on to beat West Germany 

 3-1 in the final, with Rossi scoring a sixth tournament 

 goal to clinch the Golden Shoe as top scorer. 

 However, life has not always been 

 a bed of roses for the Italians, who have suffered their 

 fair share of disappointments, including an abrupt exit 

 from the 2002 World Cup in Korea-Japan. After battling their 

 way through to the round of 16, the Azzurri succumbed to 

 hosts Korea Republic. Italy led for most of the match but 

 conceded a late equaliser and the South Koreans secured 

 victory with an extra-time golden goal. In the wake of this 

 crushing blow, Giovanni Trapattoni replaced Dino Zoff and 

 led Italy through qualifying for the Euro 2004. One defeat 

 and just four goals conceded in eight matches marked a return 

 to the traditional Italian virtue of resolute defending. 

 However, more disappointment awaited the Azzuri in the finals 

 in Portugal where they failed to progress beyond the group 

 stage despite not losing a match. 

 Trapattoni then made way for former 

 Juventus coach Marcello Lippi who immediately adopted the 

 mantra No one is guaranteed a place. A new generation 

 emerged, all eager to seize their opportunity. Between summer 

 2004 and autumn 2005, nine players made their debut ? Cristian 

 Zaccardo, Andrea Barzagli, Giorgio Chiellini, Daniele De 

 Rossi, Manuele Blasi, Mauro Esposito, Luca Toni, Alberto 

 Gilardino and Vincenzo Iaquinta ? and together they accounted 

 for eight of the 15 goals scored by Italy on the road to 

 Germany.

 US continue on upward curve 

 Consistent play, comprehensive 

 preparations and a slew of talented players ? many of whom 

 helped see them through to the quarter finals at Korea-Japan 

 in 2002 ? ensured the United States a fifth consecutive 

 appearance on the worlds biggest stage at Germany. 

 Gone are the days when the North American nation was derided 

 as a second-tier footballing side, and coach Bruce Arena 

 has his team believing that their capricious mix of young 

 talents such as DaMarcus Beasley and Landon Donovan and 

 wily old campaigners like Brian McBride and Claudio Reyna 

 could be enough to see off the worlds best. 

 Arenas Americans reached 

 the World Cup finals with three matches still to play in 

 the final round of North, Central American and Caribbean 

 qualifying. And even with a loss late in the campaign to 

 fellow qualifiers Costa Rica, the US still finished top 

 of the regional pack for the first time in their history. 

 With only one loss in their opening 

 six final round matches, the US needed a win at home against 

 arch-rivals Mexico on September 3 last year to book their 

 place. Goals from Steve Ralston and Beasley saw the Americans 

 defeat their neighbours and kick off wild celebrations

 After reaching the semi-finals 

 of the inaugural World Cup in 1930, the USs fortunes 

 were decidedly less impressive for a long time, but they 

 have been on an upward trajectory of late. After nearly 

 a half century without reaching the finals (from 1950 to 

 1990) the US finally returned to the big stage at Italia 

 90.

 With a host of new players and 

 the old guard from Korea-Japan still largely intact, the 

 US will be keen to improve on their performance of 2002.

 A new era begins

 After two 1-0 play-off wins over 

 Norway, Karel Bruckners team have booked their place 

 at Germany. As was the case in previous campaigns ? as the 

 erstwhile Czechoslovakia, the Czech Republic did not have 

 things entirely their own way. In European qualifying Group 

 I, their haul of 27 points was good only for second place 

 behind The Netherlands, and put them a mere two points ahead 

 of Romania, on 25. Another play-off lay-in wait for the 

 Czechs if they were to secure their World Cup berth. This 

 awakened unhappy memories of 2001, when a strong Czech squad 

 missed the 2002 World Cup in Korea-Japan after losing under 

 similar circumstances to Belgium. This time, however, it 

 was a different story. Bruckners men set about their 

 task with steely determination and outplayed the Norwegians 

 both home and away. 

 This Czechs qualification 

 was merely the continuation of their success at the Euro 

 2004 in Portugal, despite losing in the semi-finals to eventual 

 winners Greece. They were the only team not to drop a point 

 in the group stages, coming from behind to win against both 

 Germany and The Netherlands. The emergence of Bruckners 

 men was one of the definite highlights of the tournament. 

 They will be hoping to make a similar impact at the World 

 Cup. Alongside old warhorses such as Jan Koller, Pavel Nedved 

 and Karel Poborsky, a new generation of top-class players 

 has been evolving, like Milan Baros, Tomas Rosicky and goalkeeping 

 star Petr Cech.

 World Cup debut

 Black Stars shine at last 

 Ghanas historic journey 

 to their first World Cup finals began with a comfortable 

 qualifying victory over Somalia, a 7-0 aggregate success 

 that sent the Black Stars into the group stage. There they 

 were drawn with 2010 World Cup hosts South Africa in group 

 II and after opening their campaign with a 0-1 defeat in 

 Burkina Faso, they signalled their intent by beating South 

 Africa 3-0 in Kumasi on June 20, 2004. 

 They topped the group for the 

 first time in September 2004 after beating Cape Verde Islands 

 2-0, again in Kumasi but their momentum faltered following 

 the sudden departure of coach Mariano Barreto, who quit 

 to take over at Portuguese club Maritimo. Sam Arday held 

 the reins for a short time before the Serbian Ratomir Dujkovic 

 took charge in late 2004. His reign began with a draw against 

 Congo DR but after scraping a 2-1 home win against Burkina 

 Faso on June 5 last year, the Black Stars were back on track, 

 making it to Germany in style with a 4-0 victory over Cape 

 Verde in Praia. 

 For Ghana, a place on world footballs 

 greatest stage is long overdue. They have won four African 

 Cup of Nations titles ? in 1963, 1965, 1978 and 1982 ? and 

 twice captured the Under-17 World Cup. Moreover, they have 

 produced some of Africas most talented footballers 

 down the years ? Osei Koffi, Abdulrazak Karim, Ben Acheampong, 

 Afriye and George Al Hassan, in addition to 1990s stars 

 Abedi Pele and Anthony Yeboah. The shining lights in this 

 team are captain Stephen Appiah and Michael Essien who together 

 with skilful Muntari, give Ghana a formidable-looking midfield.

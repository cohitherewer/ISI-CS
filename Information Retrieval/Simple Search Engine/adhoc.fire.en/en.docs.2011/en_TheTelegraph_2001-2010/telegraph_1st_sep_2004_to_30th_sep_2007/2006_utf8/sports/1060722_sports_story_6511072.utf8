 Sri Lanka have edge but were determined, says Prince

Colombo: South Africa captain Ashwell Prince admits his inexperienced squad, missing three senior players including regular skipper Graeme Smith, start their two-Test series against Sri Lanka as the underdogs. 

We are coming here without three of our regulars ? Smith, Jacques Kallis and Shaun Pollock ? so considering this and the fact we are playing away from home makes us the underdogs in the series, Prince told reporters on his teams arrival. 

They have been enjoying a good time. Mahela (Jayawardene) has been doing well as captain and as a batsman, Sangakkara (Kumar) has been among runs and Sanath Jayasuriya has done well on his return. 

Sri Lanka will have the edge. But we are determined to face the challenge, he added. 

Prince, the first coloured player to captain South Africa, also pinpointed spinner Muttiah Muralidharan as the major threat during a two-match series that starts on July 27 at the Sinhalese Sports Club. 

Muralidharan, in superb form against England in June, has taken 82 wickets in 13 Tests against South Africa at an average of 23.34. His record at home is even better with 47 wickets from seven games. 

Our main worry will be Murali, said Prince. Weve got a lot of footage and will be analysing how best to combat him.

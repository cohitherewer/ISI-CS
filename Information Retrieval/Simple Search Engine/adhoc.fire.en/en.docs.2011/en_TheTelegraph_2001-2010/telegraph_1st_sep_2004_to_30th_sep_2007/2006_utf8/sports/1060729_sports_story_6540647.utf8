 Jeev up to joint 10th

Shizuoka: Jeev Milkha Singh sank three birdies in five holes over his second nine to record a three-under 68 in the second round of the Omazaeki golf tournament at the par-71 Shizuoka Country Hamaoka Course amp; Hotel. 

Jeev, who may have been even better placed but for his bogey on the last hole, rose from overnight 30th to tied 10th, seven shots off the pace with a total of four-under par. 

The leader continued to be Soushi Tajima, who added a four-under 67 to his first round tally of 65 to be 10-under, three clear of second placed S. K. Ho, who had a three-under 68 on the second day on Friday. 

Ho was the best Asian Tour player at last weeks British Open with a tied 11th place finish. 

There are still 36 holes to go, said Jeev, who in five years has yet to win on the Japan Tour. This year, Jeev has four top-10 finishes in six starts in Japan. 

The Chandigarh golfer improved his putting from 29 to 26 putts, but he dropped a crucial shot on his last hole of the day, the ninth. 

He started on the 10th and had a bogey on the 15th, but recovered quickly with birdies on the 16th and 17th. He had birdies on third, fourth and seventh and was four-under, when he dropped a shot on ninth, but for which he would have been tied fifth. (PTI)

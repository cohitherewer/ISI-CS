The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Outcast in India, a big hit in Asia

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Shaji Kurian 

Faridabad: As far as the All India Football Federation (AIFF) is concerned, he has been an outcast since the last Santosh Trophy in Kerala. According to the Asian Football Confederation (AFC), however, he is one of the best in the continent. 

Meet Shaji Kurian, the 36-year-old Fifa assistant referee from Kerala, who became only the second Indian to supervise in the final of the under-17 Asian championships in Singapore on Sunday. A huge honour, indeed, but sadly he hasnt got recognition from his own country. 

Kurian was the referee in a controversial match during the last Santosh Trophy when Goa equalised immediately after a Manipur goal with the latter apparently not ready for the kick-off. The video recordings proved that the referee did no wrong. 

Yet, Kurian has not been posted for any national-level match since January, apparently under instructions from federation bosses. 

Kurian, however, is not complaining against AIFF officials. True, I have not been given any match at the national level, but the AIFF is not stopping my AFC assignments, he said. 

Kurians performance as an assistant referee was so impressive in Singapore that he got seven important matches, including one quarter final, semi-final and the final between Japan and North Korea, which the former won 4-2. 

Asked why Kurian is being given a raw deal in India, an AIFF official felt it was done to keep the Manipur Football Association happy. They threatened to withdraw the team from all national championships after losing to Goa last year. To keep them happy, Kurian has been made a scapegoat, he said, adding that Kurian could find himself out of the Fifa list if he is being constantly denied assignments at home. 

Former Fifa referee S.M. Balu of Karnataka met with a similar fate after the ill-fated 2004 Federation Cup final between Dempo and Mohun Bagan in Bangalore. 

While the Karnataka Football Association went scot free, Balu was indicted and eased out of the Fifa list.

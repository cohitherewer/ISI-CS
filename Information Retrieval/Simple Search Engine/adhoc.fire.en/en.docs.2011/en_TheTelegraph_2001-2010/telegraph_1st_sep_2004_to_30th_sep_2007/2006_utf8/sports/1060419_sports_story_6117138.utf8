 Surya, Swati best 

 National A Chess

 Surya 

 Visakhapatnam: Grandmaster 

 Surya Sekhar Ganguly of Petroleum Sports Promotion Board 

 (PSPB) annexed the national title for the third time on 

 the trot after defeating S. Kidambi in the final round of 

 the 43rd National A Chess Championship on Tuesday.

 WGM Swati Ghate won the womens 

 title with ease after drawing her final-round game with 

 second finisher WIM Mary Ann Gomes.

 The third place went to WGM D. 

 Harika and these three will now represent the Indian team 

 in the next Womens Chess Olympiad along with Grandmaster 

 Koneru Humpy, who has been given a direct seeding in the 

 team.

 GM Sandipan Chanda (PSPB) retained 

 his second spot with a win over IM Deepan Chakravarthy.

 The third place went to Jharkhands 

 Diwakar Prasad Singh, who has been labelled the (Mahendra 

 Singh) Dhoni of Indian chess following his impressive performance 

 here.

 In the final round, Diwakar defeated 

 GM R. B. Ramesh. The top three will join Viswanathan Anand, 

 Krishnan Sasikiran and P. Harikrishna in the Olympiad in 

 Turin next month.

 It was, in fact, a three-way tie 

 at the top with Surya, Sandipan and Diwakar finishing on 

 an identical score of 14 points apiece. As the tie was resolved 

 according to the Koya system, Surya had the best score followed 

 by Sandipan and finally Diwakar.

 Interestingly, this is the third 

 time on the trot that Sandipan has tied for the first place 

 with Surya and on all the three occasions he has had to 

 be satisfied with second spot.

 Kunte (13.5) finished fourth despite 

 winning the final round game against IM Lanka Ravi. 

 The fifth place went to Chakravarthy 

 who had to pay a very heavy price for losing his last two 

 round games. Taking lead midway in the event, Chakravarthy 

 was looking all set to annex the national title but losing 

 the penultimate round to Dinesh Kumar Sharma and the last 

 one against Sandipan forced him to finish fifth overall 

 on 13.5 points.

 Also finishing on the same score 

 was Humpy who accounted for IM Saptarshi Roy Chowdhury in 

 the last round. Seventh spot was taken by IM M. R. Venkatesh 

 who finished with 13 points while Saptarshi finished eighth 

 on 11 points. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Crucial EGM today

Calcutta: The EGM called 

 for Monday to discuss the disposal of RCTCs property 

 at D.L. Khan Road, a prime location in the city, has already 

 become a non-issue. The reason being the resignation of 

 a stewards, who had a disclosed interest in the property, 

 and also largely because of some startling exposure made 

 by a section of the club members ? pertaining to the malfunctioning 

 of the club machinery ? at another meeting with the stewards 

 held on July 16, the day EGM notice was dispatched.

 However, the property which is valued at about Rs 20 crore is up for grabs again but not before the stewards were forced by the members to lift all veils of secrecy in such deals. A proper global tender, under the stewardship of a five or seven committee members, would be formed to scan such sales. The property in question almost changed hands at half its price had the members of the cash-strapped RCTC not taken the matter to the streets.

 With the property sale issue becoming a non-starter, the focus is bound to shift to the freshly renovated racecourse office and also some awkward questions raised by an ex-chief stewards in respect to the appointment of a retired army officer ? at a six-figured salary ? related to the steward who has just resigned. About two dozen of club members, including those who have served as chiefs are expected to generate heat as each one has a question to hurl ? of awkward nature, obviously.

 Stewards, too, are busy doing their homework. Never before a situation of such a gravity has been faced by the august company. The last one that comes to mind is the misuse of clubs funds ? Rs 35 lakh ? by a stewards, engineered with the help of a key finance functionary, about a decade and half ago. A spate of resignation followed but the amount was recovered through a legal course.

 The renovation of office has cost the cl;ub to the tune of Rs 1.31 crore but the most interesting part is learnt to be the payment pattern which was mostly in cash on a daily basis and without any signed voucher. Stewards are not receiving any call, though the present chief has promised The Telegraph that he would make a statement after the EGM.

 Racegoers are, however, more concerned punishment for guilty but RCTC may not like to pursue the time and money-consuming legal course.

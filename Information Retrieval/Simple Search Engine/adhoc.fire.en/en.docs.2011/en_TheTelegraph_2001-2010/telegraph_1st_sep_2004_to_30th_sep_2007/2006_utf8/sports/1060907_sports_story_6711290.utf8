 Video umpire makes debut

Moenchengladbach: The video umpire, equivalent to the third umpire in cricket, was introduced in the mens World Cup hockey on Wednesday. 

The concept was successfully tried at the 2006 womens Champions Trophy and also the Premier Hockey League in India. 

Based on the feedback, it was implemented at the 11th ongoing World Cup, according to tournament director Ken Read. 

 Read said the match umpires may refer a decision to the video umpire only in three instances as per regulation 14 of the World Cup. 

They are: 

1. Whether the ball has crossed the goal line (within the area bound by the goalposts and crossbar) when attempting to score a goal. 

2. Whether the ball is played inside or outside the circle when attempting to score a goal. 

3. Following a deflection, whether the ball has been touched inside the circle by the stick of an attacker before the ball crosses the goal line. 

 Read was optimistic that the video umpires decision will be conveyed to the match umpires within 30 seconds. 

During the referral, the match and the clock will be stopped. 

 If the referral is about legitimacy of a goal and the video footage is unclear for the video umpire to decide, then it will be declared as no goal, Read said. 

 The match umpire will make a rectangular hand signal, as in cricket, to indicate a referral to the video umpire. 

 Read asserted that the decision of the video umpire would be final and no protest will be entertained.

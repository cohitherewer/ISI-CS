Calcutta: Former Team India captain Sourav Ganguly will lead East Zone in the October 19-November 16 Duleep Trophy. 

After the selection committee meeting on Wednesday, national selector Ranjib Biswal said 10 from Bengal have been inducted into the 15-member squad. 

Either Manoj Tewari or Abu Nachim Ahmed of Assam will be the 16th member, but the decision will be taken after two trial matches in Kalyani on Friday and Saturday, Biswal said. 

The East Zone selectors Ranjib Biswal, Arup Bhattacharya (Bengal), Rajesh Bora (Assam), Rajesh Verma (Jharkhand), Malay Chakraborty (Tripura) and Sritam Das (Orissa) along with Sourav took over an hour to select the squad, which includes promising left-arm spinner Sourav Saigal of Orissa. Shib Sagar Singh, however, missed out. 

East Zone will kick off the proceedings against Central on October 19 in Gwalior. The final will be held in Calcutta from November 12-16. 

Bengals Paras Mhambrey has been chosen as the coach-cum-manager. 

Meanwhile, Biswal felt that Bengals Sourashish Lahiri, member of the India Green side in the Challenger Trophy, got a raw deal. 

It is unfortunate that Sourashish got to play only one match. I also feel that he should have been given more opportunities. However, as selectors, our job is to select the squad. Whether or not he will be in the final XI, remains the prerogative of the team management. 

 THE SQUAD 

Sourav Ganguly (captain), Subhamoy Das, Arindam Das, Abhishek Jhunjhunwala, Deep Dasgupta, Laxmi Ratan Shukla, Rohan Gavaskar, Ranadeb Bose, Asok Dinda; Sourashish Lahiri (all Bengal); Shiv Sundar Das, Prabhanjan Mullick, Debasish Mohanty, Sourav Saigal (all Orissa); S. S. Rao (Jharkhand). 

Stand-bys: P. Aziz (Assam), R. Kumar, S. Nadim (both Jharkhand), Rajib Dutta (Tripura), Subir Biswas (Orissa). 

Coach-cum-manager: Paras Mhambrey.

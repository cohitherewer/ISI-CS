 Japan face champions in must-win tie

 - We know theres still a little bit more to improve: Kaka 

Bergisch Gladbach: Brazil and Japan enter Thursdays last Group F match with very distinct goals. 

Brazil are looking to improve. Japan are just trying to survive. With their mind already on the second round, Brazil would try to polish their previous performances against Croatia and Australia. 

Despite winning both matches, the defending champions failed to impress and were heavily challenged in the both their outings. 

Japan, coached by former Brazilian all-star Zico, desperately need to win in Dortmund to keep their chances of advancing alive. A draw will automatically send the Japanese back home. 

Were playing the best team in the world and thats exciting but obviously we have to win, said Alessandro Santos, a Brazilian native who has taken Japanese citizenship. We just have to go out there and see what happens. 

Brazil lead the group with six points, three more than Australia and five more than Japan and Croatia. The top two teams advance. 

We have the responsibility to win so we can finish first, Brazil striker Adriano said. 

If Brazil finish first, they will face the second-placed team in Group E, which include Italy, the US, Ghana and the Czech Republic. 

We know theres still a little bit more to improve, midfielder Kaka said. But we are getting there. 

Besides beating the five-time champions, Japan will hope that Australia fail to defeat Croatia in the other Group F match on Thursday. Japan lost 1-3 to Australia in their opener, then drew Croatia 0-0. 

Coach Carlos Alberto Parreira said after Brazils match against Australia on Sunday that he was considering fielding reserves against Japan to give some of the starters rest ahead of the next round. 

He hasnt given any indication on who will be left out, however, only saying that striker Ronaldo was likely to stay in the starting line-up so he can continue to gain rhythm. 

Ronaldo, who would become Brazils all-time leading scorer in the World Cup if he scores a goal on Thursday, arrived for the championship overweight after a series of injuries earlier in the season. 

Ronaldo is tied with Pele with 12 World Cup goals and two shy of West Germanys Gerd Muellers career record. 

I havent scored in two matches... hopefully (I will) in this next (one), the Real Madrid striker said. 

Brazil werent worrying too much about having to face Zico, whos knowledge of Brazilian soccer could give him an edge preparing his team. 

He knows our strengths and he knows our weaknesses, striker Robinho said. But even though he knows our team very well, it will be difficult to make Japan win if we play our best soccer. 

Zico, a standout on the Brazilian World Cup teams of 1978, 1982 and 1986, will become the 13th coach in World Cup history to face his own country. 

Its not Zico against Brazil or Brazil against Zico, its Brazil against Japan, captain Cafu said. Thats how we have to think. 

If he starts, Cafu will set a Brazilian record with his 19th World Cup appearance. He is currently even with Dunga and Claudio Taffarel with 18 matches. 

With 14 victories, Cafu already has won more World Cup matches than any other Brazilian, and has played a record 148 games for his country. He has lost only 19 of those matches. 

Brazil are unbeaten against Japan in seven matches. They have five wins and two draws, including 2-2 in the Confederations Cup in Germany last year.

Beijing: Armed with a spanking new bag that has a lions face etched on it, Jeev Milkha Singh seems to be getting the seven-year itch as he carded the days best of five-under 67 on Saturday to move within one shot of the lead going into the final day of the $1.8 million Volvo China Open. 

It has been a long time since he last held a trophy in 1999. On the third day of the event, co-sanctioned by Asian and European Tours, Jeev braved strong winds and overcame the scare of a twister resembling a mini tornado barely 50m away to tie for the second spot with Prayad Marksaeng, who himself had a roller-coaster 72 to be at eight-under for three days. 

The Indian and the Thai are one shot behind Englishman David Lynn, who managed a 72 to stay at nine-under and in lead. 

Marksaeng played in high wind and experienced agony and ecstasy during his 72, which had six birdies, two bogeys and two double bogeys. 

The stocky Thai struck a purple patch with a hattrick of birdies from fifth to seventh sandwiched between two bogeys and ended with a double on 18th, which once again played very tough and gave away just two birdies and claimed many a bogey. 

Lynn also had a double on 11th, but he made up with a streak of three birdies from 12th to 14th before bogeys on 15th and 18th reduced his lead over Jeev and Marksaeng to just one. 

Meanwhile, the other Indians had to struggle. Rahil Gangjee, tied fifth overnight, had a free fall of sorts after starting well. 

He birdied the second and moved to seven-under, and then the bogey trail began. He ended the day with a 10-over 82 and slipped from overnight fifth to 63rd. 

Amandeep Johl, who just squeezed into the weekend rounds, improved his position to 45th with a 72 that had two birdies and two bogeys to be one-over after 54 holes. 

Harmeet Kahlon went three-over for the front nine and then with one each of birdie and bogey ended with a 75 that put his total at two-over and in 49th place.

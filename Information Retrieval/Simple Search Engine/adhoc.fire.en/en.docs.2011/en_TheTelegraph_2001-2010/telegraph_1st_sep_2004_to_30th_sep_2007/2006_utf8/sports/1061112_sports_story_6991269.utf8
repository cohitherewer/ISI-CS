Shanghai: Jyoti Randhawa lost his lead but stayed in touch with the leaders after the third round even as all four Indians moved inside top-20 to indicate the strength of the Indian challenge at the star-studded $5 million HSBC Champions Golf Tournament. 

Randhawa, who led in both the first and second rounds, had a great start with birdies on first two holes, but then began faltering after dropping a double bogey on the fifth at the Sheshan Country Club. 

His days work of even par-72 saw him finish at 10-under 206 and two shy of the lead held by two-time US Open champion Retief Goosen (67), who played consistent golf for his three-under 69 to move into sole lead at 12-under 204. 

Tiger Woods playing in the lead group with Randhawa and Goosen also struggled during the day with one double bogey, four bogeys and three birdies and an eagle during his round of one-over 73 that pegged him at seven-under 209 and five off the leader. 

Woods was now tied fifth with Paul Casey (68) who made a big move from overnight 23rd. Also tied fifth Francesco Molinari (69) at seven-under 209. 

As Randhawa lay third, Jeev Milkha Singh made a small upward move from tied 10th to tied eighth with his one-under 71 and six-under 210, that also included a double bogey. Shiv Kapur ran into problems with his putting and shot a 74 that saw him slip to tied 17th at four-under 212 while Gaurav Ghei (71) moved from tied 29th to tied 19th at three-under 215. 

Randhawa was one-shot behind second placed Koreas Yang Yong-Eun, who played a stunning four-under 32 on the back nine in his five-under 67 to climb to 11-under 205 and tied second. Yang had six birdies and one bogey. 

The Indian seemed to be trying a bit too hard and at times lapsed into mistakes. Still, he did well to hang in there with an even par round that ensured he will play in the lead group with Goosen and Yang. 

I missed a few putts out there and made some mistakes, too. There is one more round to go and I am only two behind, thats fine. I am not going to feel any pressure, he said. It was sure was an experience playing with Tiger Woods. 

The putter went cold once again for Shiv Kapur, who made just birdie through the day in his card of two-over 74 that saw him slip down to tied 17th in the leaderboard after being tied eighth overnight. 

Kapur had just one bogey and eight pars on his front nine and then two bogeys and just one birdie on the second nine on a frustrating day. 

Ghei had a good start with a birdie on the second but bogeys on fifth, sixth and eighth saw him slide to two-over for the first half of the round. He recovered very well on the back stretch with back-to-back birdies on tenth and 11th and a third on 14th and had no bogeys to finish the day at one-under 71. He improved his position from tied 29th to 19th.

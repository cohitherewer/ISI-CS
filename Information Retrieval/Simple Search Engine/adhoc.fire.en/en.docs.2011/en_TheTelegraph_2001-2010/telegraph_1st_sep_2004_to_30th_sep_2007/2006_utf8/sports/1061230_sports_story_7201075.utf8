The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Bhutia wishes to fulfil long-cherished dream

 - Team spirit will be the key, says Sporting coach

Calcutta: There is dream in the Mohun Bagan air. 

The dream of achieving what has so far remained elusive in an emotional journey of ups and downs; the dream of reaching out for the highest both individually and collectively. 

There has been dream in the reunion of Bhaichung Bhutia and Jose Ramirez Barreto, prompting the new dispensation of the club to announce that conquering India would just be a matter of time. It has not been fulfilled as Mohun Bagan first had to surrender the CFL Premier Division title to East Bengal and then, suffered setback in Durand Cup, which is followed by the loss to Mahindra United in the IFA Shield final. 

Its time for the duo to deliver the goods. Only this trophy is missing on my cupboard. I hope my dream will become reality tomorrow, Bhaichung said on the eve of the Federation Cup final against Sporting Clube de Goa. We are all determined to give it our best try, he added. There is dream in Bhaichungs eyes. 

As a team, we are improving by every tournament. Ive won this tournament with Mahindra last year, but I want to gift a New Years present to the Mohun Bagan fans, Barreto maintained. There is dream in the Mohun Bagan captains eyes also. 

There is revenge in the Sporting Clube de Goa air. The Clifford Chukwumas team lost 0-1 to Mohun Bagan in the IFA Shield semi-final. The Nigerian coach swaggered on Friday that his team has the necessary resources to beat any team convincingly. No doubt, he has reasons to believe it. 

In a way, revenge is a confession of pain. Sporting, it may be recalled, lost to Mahindra in the last years Federation Cup final and, so, Chukwuma hasnt appeared a good listener to the so-near-yet-so-far script. 

We certainly dont wish to dwell on the past. Tomorrow is a fresh battle, fresh challenge and we are ready for it, Chukwuma added. 

There is pressure in the Mohun Bagan air. More than the pressure of delivering in the final, its the push for lending strength and stability to the defence. There will be no Eduardo Coelho (this cancels out the possibility of another IFA Shield-like scuffle with Sportings Dudu Omagbemi, leading to their suspension). Sanjeev Maria has pulled a hamstring problem while Deepak Mondal is suffering from mild fever. 

In the changed circumstances, its likely that midfielder Suman Dutta will be employed as the special watchdog for the dangerous Dudu. Absence of Eduardo is a setback for us, Bhaichung admitted and he was spot-on. 

There is promise in the Sporting camp too. With Dudu and Ernest Jeremiah at their disposal, the Goan team is inarguably a force to reckon with in the national perspective. Dudu is surely in good form, but we bank on the team spirit and this is the key to our success, reminded Chukwuma. 

However, Sporting havent fired much to their reputation so far. After the Durand Cup and IFA Shield, they will surely target Saturdays challenge as the opportunity for their promise to get realised. 

As Mohun Bagan coach pointed out: Sporting is one of the best teams in the country. You never know how they will crush you. A warning the Bhaichungs cant afford to ignore. 

How things can change for Mohun Bagan. Following Biswajit Bhattacharyas sudden resignation after the Durand Cup, the interim arrangement with Robson has so far assumed a positive direction. Yet the clubs cupboard is waiting for the maiden trophy. 

But as it is said that dreams are todays answers to tomorrows questions. Bhaichung knows it, so does his Dream Team.

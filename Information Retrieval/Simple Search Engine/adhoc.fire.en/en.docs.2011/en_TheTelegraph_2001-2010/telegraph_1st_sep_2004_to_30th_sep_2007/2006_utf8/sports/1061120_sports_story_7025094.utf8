New Delhi: Happy days are here again for Mohun Bagan. Jose Ramirez Barreto is back to shoulder the responsibilities of a side that looked mediocre till the other day. 

The Durand Cup on Sunday got one of its biggest crowds in recent memory. Perhaps they were keen to see how the most sought-after foreign footballer of recent times would begin his new innings with his old club. 

Well, the fans at Ambedkar Stadium didnt go home disappointed. The Brazilian got into the act after Mohun Bagan had struggled for 73 minutes, to steer his side to a 2-1 victory over Sporting Clube de Goa in group I quarter-final league action. 

He had played a role in setting up the first goal and then himself struck two minutes later. It was easily one of the best goals of the meet this year. 

Having scored two minutes earlier through Dulal Biswas, Mohun Bagan increased men in attack and earned a free-kick 10 yards outside the Sporting box. As midfielder Lalkamal Bhowmick floated the ball into the box, Barreto arrived in a flash, rose above the defence and sent in a flying header. None in the Sporting ranks had any answer to this super-quick exercise, which was a typical Barreto act. 

The Brazilian was slower than in previous years and played well only in patches. But his occasional brilliant touches made all the difference. He was tightly marked and given very little room by the Sporting defenders. Yet, he found his way to test the Sporting defence on several occasions. 

Late in the second half, when Dudu Omagbemi pulled one back for Sporting in the 79th minute, Barreto dropped down deep into his half to help out the defenders. 

 quot;The team has won, I am happy, quot; said Barreto. quot;I didnt expect to score. It was like a bonus. quot; 

It was a day for the veterans. Dulal, another senior footballer, had a good day in office as well. He broke the deadlock in the lead in the 73rd minute when he slammed in a rebound after Endems shot was blocked by the diving Sporting goalkeeper Louis Barreto. The move was initiated by Barreto, whose splitting through ball found Endem on the left.

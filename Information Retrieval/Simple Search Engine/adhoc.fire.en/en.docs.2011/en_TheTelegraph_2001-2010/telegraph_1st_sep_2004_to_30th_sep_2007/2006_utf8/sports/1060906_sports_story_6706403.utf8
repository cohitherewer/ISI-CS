Bangalore: The ongoing camp for Indian squad here was disrupted on Tuesday when some fans watching the proceedings intruded into the ground and mobbed batting maestro Sachin Tendulkar, forcing the session to be shifted to an adjacent venue. 

The incident occurred after a barbed wire fence on the compound of the Karnataka State Cricket Association (B) ground on which a dozen people were leaning heavily came down. 

The fans crashed into the footpath with their back to the ground after it collapsed apparently because of overweight. At least three persons received injuries, including one in the head resulting in profuse bleeding, but it was not life threatening, police said. 

The crash brought the training session, being guided by coach Greg Chappell, to a stand-still. A few of the fans standing on the sidelines watching the nets took advantage of the commotion, entered the ground and mobbed Tendulkar and appeared, from a distance, to have virtually forced the Maestro to pose for cameras along with them. 

Scores of others who were watching the practice session, involving skipper Rahul Dravid, Tendulkar, Harbhajan Singh, Dinesh Mongia, Ramesh Powar and VRV Singh, from trees, quietly climbed down and took to their heels, fearing a crack-down on them. 

As more people tried to get into the training area, in what seemed to be a security lapse, an angry Dravid shouted at the top of his voice, get out, and then he summoned security personnel to bring the situation under control. 

The incident forced the shifting of the rolling camp to the adjacent M Chinnaswamy Stadium. 

As Tendulkar walked back to National Cricket Academy in the same premises, he was seen being pestered by a man to pose for photograph, but this time the batsman had to push him back. (PTI)

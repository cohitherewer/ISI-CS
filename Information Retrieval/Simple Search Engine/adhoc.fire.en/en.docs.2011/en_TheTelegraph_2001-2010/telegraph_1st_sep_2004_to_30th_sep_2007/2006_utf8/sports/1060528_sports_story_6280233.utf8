 D/L system to be introduced

 Domestic Cricket

 New Delhi: To decide results 

 of rain interrupted games, ICCs Duckworth-Lewis system 

 will be in operation in the domestic circuit next season 

 onwards. 

 The recommendation to introduce 

 this system instead of the current VJD System and a host 

 of other recommendations were taken at a BCCI technical 

 committee meeting in Bangalore on Saturday.

 The technical committee also suggested 

 to adopt the Power Play system. 

 Another recommendation was to 

 stage maximum number of one-day tournaments ?? such as National 

 One Dayers and Deodhar Torphy ?? as day and night matches.

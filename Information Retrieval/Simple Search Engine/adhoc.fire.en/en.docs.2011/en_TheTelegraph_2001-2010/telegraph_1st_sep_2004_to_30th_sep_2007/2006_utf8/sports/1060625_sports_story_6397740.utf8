Basseterre: Shivnarine Chanderpaul and Marlon Samuels ground the Indian attack to submission and put the West Indies in total command in the third Test at the Warner Park here on Saturday. 

 West Indies were all out for 581 with the last five 

 wickets falling for 19. Harbhajan Singh finished with five 

 for 147. India, in reply, were 64 for one at Day III tea. 

 Virender Sehwag was dismissed for 31. Wasim Jaffer (24) 

 and VVS Laxman (2) were at the crease. 

The two batsmen had raised prospects of two more individual centuries in the innings as the hosts resuming at 420 for 5, cruised to 536 for 5 by lunch on the third day. 

Chanderpaul, unbeaten on 24 overnight, was unconquered on 76 while Samuels, starting the day on 8, was undefeated on 69. The two have so far put on 130 runs for the sixth-wicket stand. 

Should the two go on to convert their knocks into hundreds, which seems more likely, it would be four three-figure scores ? going with 135 and 116 made by Daren Ganga and Ramnaresh Sarwan, respectively. 

Chanderpaul and Samuels made runs steadily without taking recourse to extravagant shots and made the most of spread out field. Still they had their moments of total aggression as when they hit Anil Kumble for a six each down the ground. 

Kumble suffered a rare miserable day in the field and had toiled 47 overs without any reward so far. 

Earlier on Friday, centuries from Ganga and Sarwan set the tone for a mammoth West Indian total before the Indians fought back through some disciplined bowling. The hosts ended the rain-curtailed Day II at 420 for five. 

Ganga, 64 overnight, registered his third Test century with a sedate 135 that consumed 294 balls and included 15 fours.

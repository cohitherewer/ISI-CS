 Ankle feels good: Jones

 We have some of the best bowling in the world, says Jones 

Mumbai: Pace bowler Simon Jones, coming off after a six-months injury lay-off, said that his ankle is feeling fine, at the end of the visiting teams three-day practice game against the CCI Presidents XI. 

Jones, one of the architects of Englands Ashes triumph over Australia last summer, injured his ankle before the end of the series last September and also missed the subsequent tour of Pakistan. 

I am feeling good. I looked a little bit easier on Sunday. I bowled off my long run-up and am happy with the way things went. I bowled again after the game in the nets and the ankle is feeling good, he said after the match on Monday. 

Jones took two wickets for nine in the CCI Presidents second innings tally of 75. He along with the other team members left for Vadodara on Tuesday. 

Jones, who had a short stint under pace guru Dennis Lillee at the MRF Pace Foundation in Chennai last month, said that because of the huge temperature difference between England and India, he is looking to spend more time on the field to get adjusted to the hot conditions. 

Its minus two back home and its like 35 over here. Its a big difference and the sooner you gauge the better, he said. 

Its hot and going to get hotter. Its your summer. The more time we spend on the field, the better for us, he said. Jones said he knew the bowlers have to really work hard to get wickets in Indian conditions, especially against what he called the best batting line-up in the world which he experienced as a member of the England A teams visit to India in 2004. 

It was a tough tour. I have never been to India before that. The turning wicket in Chennai was a not encouraging for fast bowlers. We went to Delhi and other places where the wickets were slow, he said. 

You have to work hard for your wickets. Thats going to happen in this series against the Indians. We are going to work hard against the best batting line up in the world. We are up to the challenge. We have got some of the best bowling in the world. It should be quite challenging, he said. 

The 27-year-old Welshman, who took 18 of his 59 Test wickets in the last Ashes series against Australia after making is debut at Lords against India in 2002, said he was happy coming in to bowl after the new ball had been shared by Matthew Hoggard and Steve Harmison. 

To be fair Hoggy (Mathew Hoggard) and Harmy (Steve Harmison) have done a very good job in the last few years. I dont see any reason to change that. I just come as a first or second change. It had worked well for us in the Ashes, he said. 

It (not opening the bowling) doesnt bother me. I like bowling with the new ball, like bowling with the old ball too. Ill do what the captain (Michael Vaughan) tells me, he said. 

Jones, who used reverse swing to unsettle the high-flying Australian batsmen, said he expected it to happen in Tests as the are played over five days. 

It might reverse as it (Test) is for five days. Obviously with more batting and bowling on the wicket, reverse swing might come into the game, he said.

 1st career pole for Massa 

Istanbul: Felipe Massa gained his first pole position, leading a Ferrari 1-2 with Michael Schumacher at the Turkish Grand Prix on Saturday. Schumacher came in ahead of rival Fernando Alonso who fionished third. 

Massa timed 1:26.907 on the 5.32-km circuit. Schumacher was at 1:27.284. Alonso of Renault did 1:27.321. 

It is a fantastic moment for me, Massa said. The first pole is always much more important than the others. 

It is the fourth time this season Ferrari went 1-2 but the first with the Brazilian ahead of Schumacher. The team is doing a great job and I will never forget it, Massa said. 

He came to Ferrari this year as the second driver after three unproductive years at Sauber. 

Last year Kimi Raikkonen of McLaren-Mercedes had the pole position in 1:26.797 and went on to win the race. Raikkonen was eighth in qualification this time. 

Hondas Jenson Button, who won the Hungarian GP three weeks ago for his first victory in nearly seven years of F1 racing, was seventh.

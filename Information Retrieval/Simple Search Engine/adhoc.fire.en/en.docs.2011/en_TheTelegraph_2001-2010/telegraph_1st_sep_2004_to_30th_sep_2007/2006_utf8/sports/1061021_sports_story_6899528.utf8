The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Not a curtain-raiser for Ashes, says Flintoff

 - Tight situation brings the best out of us: Ponting 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Jaipur: Faced with the threat of elimination, both Australian captain Ricky Ponting and his England counterpart, Andrew Flintoff, on Friday said that the Champions Trophy match would not be a prelude to the Ashes series beginning in Brisbane next month. 

Its still a month to go for the Ashes, said Ponting. At the moment, we are totally focused on Saturdays match. It is going to be a strong game and we are looking forward to an exciting day of cricket. 

The Aussie skipper agreed that at the moment it is difficult not to think about the upcoming Ashes battle. 

We will be playing each other in a great series very soon. At least seven from both teams that will be playing on Saturday will also be there for the Ashes. But then, our priority at the moment is to win this game. In fact, we would like to take the Champions Trophy home. This one title has always eluded us. 

England captain Andrew Flintoff also spoke on similar lines. 

This match is certainly not a curtain-raiser for the Ashes. That would come later. Let us win the tie here first, he said. I am not sure whether it would be a big scoring match or not. I know in one-day cricket spectators do enjoy big scores. But I can assure them that this is going to be a highly competitive and tough affair. 

Ponting is still livid after the defeat against the West Indies in Mumbai. 

That was a rank bad performance, no doubt, Ponting said. We batted badly. We lost wickets at regular intervals, which included a run out. That was unpardonable. I even dropped a catch. How can we win a match with such mistakes, he said. 

Reminded that a defeat could throw the Australians out of the tournament, Ponting laughed and said he was not giving much thought to it. 

We have faced such situations many times. It always brings the best out of us, he said and added in a light vein: We have now become quite used to experience an early exit from the Champions Trophy. 

On the tight scheduling of the tournament, the Australian captain said it was not bothering him too much.

 Sehwag injury jolt for India

Benoni: India were hit by an injury scare ahead of the five-match one-day series with opener Virender Sehwag sustaining a cut on his middle finger. 

The Delhi opener injured the finger while practising before the start of the warm-up game against South Africa A on Thursday. 

The injury ruled out Sehwag from the tour-opener, giving Mumbai player Wasim Jaffer a look-in. 

India are already without Yuvraj Singh, a key player in the teams one-day scheme of things, after the middle-order batsman suffered a knee ligament injury last month. 

India will begin their one-day campaign on Sunday in Johannesburg, which means that Sehwag has just two days to be fit for the match.

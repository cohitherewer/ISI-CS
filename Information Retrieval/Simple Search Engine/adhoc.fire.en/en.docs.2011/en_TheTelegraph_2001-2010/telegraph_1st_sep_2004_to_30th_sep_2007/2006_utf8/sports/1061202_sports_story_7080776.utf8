Moscow: David Nalbandian beat a struggling Marat Safin in straight sets Friday to draw Argentina level with Russia at 1-1 in the Davis Cup final. 

Nalbandian withstood a hail of aces from the powerful but erratic Safin to earn a 6-4, 6-4, 6-4 victory on a synthetic indoor carpet at Moscows Olympic Stadium where the visitors were backed by vociferous Argentine fans including soccer great Diego Maradona. 

That levelled the scores after Nikolay Davydenko had given Russia the lead by overcoming Juan Ignacio Chela for the first time. The third-ranked Davydenko, who had lost five previous matches against Chela, overcame shaky starts in his early service games and a third-set stumble to win 6-1, 6-2, 5-7, 6-4. 

The final, at home how could I not be nervous? Davydenko said. I lost the third set because I made so many mistakes. In the fourth set, I made fewer and played well. 

Dmitry Tursunov and Mikhail Youzhny continue Russias attempt for a first title since 2002 against Nalbandian and Agustin Calleri in Saturdays doubles. The decisive reverse singles are scheduled for Sunday. 

Davydenko, who had his own brand of VIP support headed by former Russian President Boris Yeltsin, with honorary president of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) Juan Antonio Samaranch also in attendance among the 10,500 crowd, took victory in his stride. 

If you saw me play in (the Masters Cup) in Shanghai and other tournaments, you would notice that I always start well but then get tired in the second set, said the Russian, who committed 64 unforced errors in the match to Chelas 55. 

Here, I played really well in the first two sets but began to tire and losing concentration in the third. But fortunately, I was able to hang on. 

Returning to the venue where he won the Kremlin Cup in October, Davydenko, a winner of five titles this season, overpowered Chela and controlled the first two sets. The US Open semifinalist broke Chela at the first opportunity and took the first set. He won the second after breaking Chela in the fifth game. 

Davydenko fell to 1-4 down in the third set when Chela broke him for the first time and then held serve. The Russian broke back and took it to 5-5 before Chela broke him again. 

Chela took the first fourth-set game at love, but Davydenko came back from 40-love in Chelas next service game for a 2-1 lead. Chela handed Davydenko the following game by angling an easy backhand wide and lost at love on his next serve for 1-4 to Davydenko. 

After time out for a thigh massage, Chela brought it back to 3-4, but Davydenko ended his next service game with his seventh ace and took the match in 3 hours, 5 minutes with a service winner.

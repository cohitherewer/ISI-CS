 Important to be in history: Nadal 

Paris: Rafael Nadal was bursting with pride after he broke Guillermo Vilas record of 53 consecutive claycourt wins with a 6-2, 7-5, 6-1 victory over Swede Robin Soderling in the first round of the French Open on Monday, as reported in Tuesdays late City edition. 

The defending champions win over Soderling put him at the top of the tree in mens claycourt tennis in the professional era, surpassing the Argentines mark set in 1977. For me it is special because it is 54 victories, Nadal said. 

It is very difficult. Very, very difficult. A lot of tournaments, a lot of matches. It is not normal because one day you can have bad luck, anything. I am very happy for that. It is important for me to be in history. 

Nadal, the second seed, is looking to become the first man since Brazilian Gustavo Kuerten in 2001 to successfully defend the French Open title. 

I thought about this record when I started to get close, so obviously its something that you want to go for, Nadal said. 

Vilas compiled his winning streak in 1977, the year he won his only French Open title and the Argentine presented him with a special trophy on court after the match. 

I never saw him play but the people tell me he was very, very tough, Nadal said of Vilas. 

Vilas, though, wasnt very impressed. First of all, Nadals performance has spanned over two years, which is not the same, said Vilas. Then, I have the feeling he added easy tournaments on his schedule just for that purpose. (Reuters)

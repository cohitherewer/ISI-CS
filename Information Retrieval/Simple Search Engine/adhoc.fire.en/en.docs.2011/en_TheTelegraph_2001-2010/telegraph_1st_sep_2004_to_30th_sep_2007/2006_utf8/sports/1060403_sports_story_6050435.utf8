 Hamburg cut Bayerns lead 

Frankfurt: Hamburg SV cut Bayern Munichs lead in the Bundesliga to seven points with a 2-0 win at 10-man Schalke on Sunday. 

Schalke lost Brazilian full-back Rafinha to a red card in the 28th minute and fell behind 12 minutes after the break when a Rafael van der Vaart free-kick evaded everyone and crept in. 

Ailton added the second with a cool finish 10 minutes from time to secure a win that takes Hamburg back up to second place. 

Bayern, surprisingly held to a 2-2 draw at home by bottom club Cologne on Saturday, have 66 points from 28 games. 

Their seven-point lead looks comfortable enough with six games to play but the Bavarians have a difficult game away to Werder Bremen next weekend and may just be starting to look nervously over their shoulders. 

Werder are in third place on 56 points after winning 1-0 at Eintracht Frankfurt on Saturday. 

They now have a four-point advantage over Schalke 04 in the race for third place and the final Champions League slot.

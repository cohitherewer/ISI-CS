 IFA penalises Nabi, Mukhtar

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The IFA standing sub-committee on Tuesday penalised Syed Rahim Nabi and Mukhtar Ahmed and kept the decision on M. Suresh and Shylo Malsawmtluanga pending. All these players were facing sanctions following disputes over their transfers. 

After a two-hour meeting, attended by advocates Ushanath Banerjee and Sourav Ganguly (as special invitees), the committee reached the unanimous decision that Nabi would be handed a two-match ban (in the ongoing CFL Premier Division) and a fine of Rs 50,000. Mukhtar was slapped with a one-month suspension besides coughing up a penalty of Rs. 10,000. 

No decision has been taken on Suresh and Malsawmtluanga because their case is sub-judice, IFA secretary Subrata Dutta said. 

Nabi initially intended to play for Mohammedan Sporting, but later changed his mind and applied for registration in favour of East Bengal. Suresh and Malsawmtluanga are contractually bound to play for East Bengal but decided to switch allegiance in favour of Mohammedan Sporting. Mukhtar is yet to sign for any club, but has handed his token to East Bengal. 

Since Mukhtar is still to sign, his suspension will start once he joins. Since his token is with East Bengal, he cant play for Mohammedan Sporting unless the red-and-golds release him, Dutta pointed out.

 Randhawa tied 10th after carding days best 

 - Hansen, Woods share lead 

 Tiger Woods tees off on the second hole during Round III in Dubai on Saturday 

Dubai: Tiger Woods, chasing his second consecutive win, shrugged off two wayward shots to birdie the 18th hole and share the lead with Denmarks Anders Hansen after the third round of the Dubai Desert Classic on Saturday. 

Indias Jyoti Randhawa moved into the top-10 with a brilliant six-under 66 that included seven birdies and one bogey. The Indian ace, tied 28th overnight, jumped up to tied 10th. 

Randhawa, sixth in Abu Dhabi two weeks ago, had pulled out of the Qatar Masters last week after playing three days in severe pain because of a rib injury sustained in a bike accident. 

On Saturday, he showed he had recovered well with the days best score, also achieved by Englishman Simon Dyson, the Asian Tour number one in 2000, and the Spaniard Miguel Angel Jimenez. 

World No. 1 Woods overcame a sluggish start as four birdies on the back nine earned him a five-under 67 for a 16-under total of 200. 

Hansen, who had shared the overnight lead with South African Retief Goosen, carded a 69. 

Goosen (70) was back in third place on 201 while holder Ernie Els stayed in contention for a record fourth Dubai Desert Classic title after returning a 68 for 202. 

Els shares fourth spot with Richard Green of Australia and Spains Miguel Angel Jimenez. 

Woods, who won last weeks Buick Invitational in San Diego, did well to salvage his par at the 359-yard par-four 17th. 

The 30-year-old American went for the green but his drive landed in the rough and he had to produce an excellent chip to get out of trouble. 

Woods then hooked his tee shot into the rough at the 18th before he mishit a four-iron into the stands where the ball was jubilantly caught by a spectator. 

He took a free drop and made his up-and-down for a birdie. 

The 18th is a funky hole, Woods said. 

It would be nice to win this one. Look at the past champions of this meet and it is an impressive list, said Woods, who will also feature in a $1 million putting competition on Sunday to raise funds for the development of Arab golf. 

Hansen, who registered four birdies and a bogey on Saturday, will play alongside Woods and Goosen for the second successive day in the final round. (Reuters)

 AS Nancy make knockout stage

London: Frances AS Nancy reached the last 32 of the Uefa Cup on Thursday but their celebrations were soured by crowd disturbances on a dark night for Dutch soccer. 

The Ligue 1 side were leading 3-0 at home to former winners Feyenoord when their Group E match was halted 12 minutes from time after tear gas drifted on to the pitch at the Marcel Picot Stadium and affected players and officials. 

After a 30-minute delay, and with only the Dutch sides supporters remaining in the stadium, the match resumed without further scoring. Feyenoord financial director Onno Jacobs blamed ticket-less Dutch fans for causing the trouble. 

Ajax Amsterdam also slumped 0-2 at home to Espanyol, a victory which sent the Spaniards through to the knockout stage and left the former European champions needing a draw from their final group F game at Belgiums Zulte-Waregem in two weeks time to guarantee qualification. 

Ajaxs defeat also secured Zulte a place in the knockout rounds. Greek side Panathinaikos were the other side to make the last 32 after drawing 0-0 at home to Rapid Bucharest in group G. (Reuters)

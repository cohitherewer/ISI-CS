 Adams gets a recall

 - First Test vs India 

Durban: Left-arm wrist spinner Paul Adams made a return to the South African squad for the first Test against India starting in Johannesburg from December 15, as reported in Fridays Late City edition. 

The South African selectors named two spinners in the 15-member squad, the other tweaker being Nicky Boje. 

We have selected a 15-man squad that includes two spinners as we continue in our quest to be the best Test cricket team, convenor of selectors Haroon Lorgat said. 

Paul is capable as a strike bowler and, in the absence of obvious alternatives, we want to give ourselves the opportunity of looking at him in building our Test squad. It will be up to Paul to show us that he can still do the job, he added. 

Robin Peterson, who was the only spinner in the South African squad for the one-day series, missed out. 

Adams has not played for the Proteas since a Test against New Zealand in 2003-04. He has taken 134 wickets in 45 Tests. 

Paceman Dale Steyn, who rocked the Indians in a tour match before the limited overs series, has been included. 

The Johannesburg Test will be followed by ones in Durban (December 26 to 30), and Cape Town (January 2 to 6).

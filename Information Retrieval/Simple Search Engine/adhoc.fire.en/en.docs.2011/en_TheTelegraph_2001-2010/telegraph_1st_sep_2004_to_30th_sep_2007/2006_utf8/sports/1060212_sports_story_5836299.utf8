 Kapur set for 

top-10 finish

 - PERTH GOLF 

 Kapur is placed tied 17th 

Perth: Shiv Kapur sunk a brilliant hattrick of birdies to finish the day with five-under 67 that saw him climb into tied 17th place after the penultimate round of the $2.3 million Johnnie Walker Classic here on Saturday. 

Kapur, who had first rounds of 68 and 71, began the third round with a pair of pars and then sealed an eagle, which was followed by a birdie at the Vines Resort and Country Club. 

The Indian slotted a birdie on the ninth and another on the tenth, followed by four pars. He then bogeyed the 15th, but did not allow the slip-up to affect him as he got into an overdrive and birdied the next three holes to set himself up for a top-10 finish. 

Meanwhile, Koreas K. J. Choi was still in line to claim the title despite watching Kevin Stadler of US soar into a two-shot third round lead with a sensational eagle on the last hole. 

The 36-year-old Stadler finished his day on a high note, snaring a three at the par five 18th en route to a six-under-par 66 and a three-day total of 17-under-par 199 on a sweltering day. 

Defending champion Adam Scott of Australia slipped six back off the pace after carding a 70. 

Kapur was delighted with his finish although not with the bogey on the 15th. 

Choi, the overnight leader by two, slipped to joint second place with in-form Australian Richard Green after a mixed bag of 70 which included one eagle, four birdies, two bogeys and one double bogey. Green, third in Dubai last week, charged into contention with a 66. 

Korean Lee Sung-Man fired a blistering 64 to move up to 10-under for the tournament, matched by Kapur.

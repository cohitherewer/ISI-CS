 Frustrated Warne throws tantrums

London: Shane Warne is known to deal in leg-breaks, googlies and flippers, but he resorted to bowling bouncers and throwing tantrums while leading Hampshire in an English County game against Lancashire which ended in a farce. 

The Australian leggie made his frustration well known after the opposition did not declare their second innings in a bid to cement second place in the championship. A chase would have given Hampshire a chance to take the second spot for themselves. 

Lancashire had already lost out on the title to Sussex, but they had made their runners-up position safe earlier in this game when Hampshire failed to secure maximum bonus points. 

Warne had hoped that there would be a declaration and a run chase, but Lancashire skipper Mark Chilton opted to bat on to a score of 339 for six, an overall lead of 562. 

The leg-spinner did not appreciate the thinking behind the decision to continue batting. (PTI)

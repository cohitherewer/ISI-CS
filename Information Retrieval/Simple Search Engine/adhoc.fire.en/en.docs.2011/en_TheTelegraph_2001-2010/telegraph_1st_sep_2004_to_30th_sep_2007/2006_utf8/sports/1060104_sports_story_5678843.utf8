Sydney: South Africa seized control of the third and final Test on Tuesday after Ashwell Prince and Jacques Kallis both scored centuries then Australias top order collapsed. 

Prince scored 119 and Kallis 111 to help the Proteas amass a daunting total of 451 for nine declared before the Australians slumped to 54 for three in reply, 397 runs behind. 

Matthew Hayden and Justin Langer both played on against Charl Langeveldt while Brad Hodge fell to Andre Nel in the last over of the day at the Sydney Cricket Ground. 

The umpires immediately drew stumps after Hodge fell, leaving the Australian captain Ricky Ponting on 13 and the home team struggling to survive just four days after they won the second Test in Melbourne by 184 runs to take a 1-0 series lead. 

Graeme Smith sent the Australians in to face a tricky 15-over spell before close of play after declaring South Africas innings with debutant Johan Botha on 20 and Langeveldt on one. The tourists had resumed on 230 for three and added 221 runs for the loss of six wickets on a flat pitch that offered the bowlers little encouragement but was ideal for batting. 

Prince and Kallis shared a record 219-run partnership for the fourth wicket that turned the match South Africas way.

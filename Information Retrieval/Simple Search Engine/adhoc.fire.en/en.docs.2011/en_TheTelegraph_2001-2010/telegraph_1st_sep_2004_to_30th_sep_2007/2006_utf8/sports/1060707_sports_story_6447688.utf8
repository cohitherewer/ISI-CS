 Lehmann ready to give Kahn a game

Berlin: Germanys No. 1 goalkeeper Jens Lehmann said on Thursday he would be prepared to sit out the third-place match against Portugal to give Oliver Kahn a taste of the World Cup. 

If the coach says it would be a nice gesture for Oliver to play then that would be fine by me, Lehmann said. 

On his future with the national team, Lehmann said it could depend on Juergen Klinsmann. Whether or not I stay on would depend on my personal situation and whether Juergen stays, Lehmann said. 

I dont think its up to us to demand anything of Juergen. I dont think he needs any more petitions for him to know we all want him to stay on. (Reuters)

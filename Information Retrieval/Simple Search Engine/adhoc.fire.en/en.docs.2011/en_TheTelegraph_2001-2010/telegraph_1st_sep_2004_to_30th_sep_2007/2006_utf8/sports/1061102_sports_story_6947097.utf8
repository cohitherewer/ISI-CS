 Another Zimbabwe crisis

Harare: The Zimbabwe cricket team lost its training kit and equipment in a suspected arson attack that also damaged offices at a training academy in Harare, the national governing body said on Wednesday. 

Zimbabwe Cricket (ZC) said in a statement that the fire on Tuesday night had destroyed computers, office files and video equipment after the roof of the two-storey building caved in. 

Also burnt was the playing kit and equipment for the national team that is in camp for the tour of Bangladesh later this month, the association said, adding that the fire could be an act of arson. 

The fire came a day after a mysterious fire broke out in the ZC boardroon at the main cricket arena, the Harare Sports Club. Curtains and carpets went up in flames before municipal fire fighters arrived. 

The coincidence is just too much that we can have the fires on consecutive days on ZC premises, said ZC president Ozias Bvute.

 QUICK TAKES

 93% 

 Germans want Klinsmann to stay 

 Berlin: Germanys 

 World Cup run has won coach Juergen Klinsmann poll ratings 

 that would turn politicians green with envy. A survey published 

 on Thursday found that 93 per cent Germans want Klinsmann 

 to remain as coach of the national team, with only 3 per 

 cent opposing the move. All but 5 per cent said Germans 

 could be proud of the teams achievement in reaching 

 the World Cup semi-finals, where it lost to Italy 0-2 on 

 Tuesday. The survey of 1,002 people was carried out on Wednesday 

 by the Forsa polling institute for a local TV channel.

 Tribute to fans 

 Berlin: Germanys World Cup squad will 

 return to Berlin on the day of the final to pay tribute 

 to their supporters on the Fan Mile. Millions of Germans 

 packed the area close to the Brandenburg Gate to watch the 

 hosts on huge television screens over the course of the 

 tournament. Instead of going home after Saturdays 

 semi-final loss, the players have decided to return to their 

 Berlin hotel before going out to meet the fans at around 

 midday on Sunday.

 Tickets at $1900 

 Berlin: Four days before the final, tickets 

 for the match in Berlin were selling on the black market 

 for 10 times their original price. It is going for 

 1,500 euros ($1,900) at the moment, a dealer said 

 in Munich. 

 Security checks 

 Bern: Organisers of the 2008 European Championship 

 will not carry out pre-match security checks based on named 

 tickets after the complications surrounding the ticketing 

 system at the World Cup. Fifa and the German organising 

 committee said before the World Cup that no supporter would 

 be admitted to stadiums unless the name on their ticket 

 matched that on their passport or ID card. In the event 

 only two per cent of fans had their tickets checked and 

 touts had a field day. 

 Blatter defends SA 

 Berlin: German newspapers have been bombarding 

 Sepp Blatter, the Fifa president, with questions about South 

 Africas ability to stage the 2010 World Cup. Some 

 have even suggested that, if they do not have the resources, 

 Germany should take over as hosts again. In South 

 Africa, there are problems, Blatter admitted this 

 week. South Africa is a multi-cultural country where 

 you have different tribes and you require a certain kind 

 of intelligence to bring these forces together. Also the 

 countrys presidential elections will be held before 

 the World Cup, but we are sure we will cope. 

 Pranksters nabbed 

 Berlin: Police in Berlin believe they have 

 solved the mystery of Berlins concrete soccer balls. 

 Two young men suffered slight foot injuries in recent days 

 after kicking concrete-filled balls chained to lamp posts 

 and trees in the capital. The words can u kick it 

 were sprayed in pink paint close to each of the balls, at 

 least six of which were left in the streets. Officers found 

 three new concrete-filled balls, spray cans and chains.

 Cristiano, Messi ahead 

 Berlin: Portugals Cristiano Ronaldo 

 and Argentinas Lionel Messi are among the six candidates 

 for Best Young Player at the World Cup. Other finalists 

 are Luis Valencia of Ecuador, Tranquillo Barnetta of Switzerland, 

 Cesc Fabregas of Spain and Lukas Podolski of Germany. I 

 believe Cristiano Ronaldo and Lukas Podolski have to be 

 the favourites because of their contributions, Lothar 

 Matthaeus, who announced the shortlist on Thursday, said. 

 The Fifa Technical Study Group will decide the winner, who 

 will be announced on Friday.

 French casualties 

 Paris: Two French revellers died and a third 

 was feared drowned after more than half a million fans took 

 to the streets early on Thursday to celebrate Le Bleus 

 qualification for the World Cup final. In Paris, an 18-year-old 

 man was crushed to death as he tried to jump between the 

 roofs of two metro trains at Opera station, police said. 

 A young man was also missing, feared drowned in Lyon after 

 jumping off a bridge into the river Saone with friends. 

 And in Lens, a 20-year-old woman was killed in a car accident 

 minutes after the French win, police said. 

 Owen surgery 

 Newcastle: Michael Owen will have to wait 

 eight weeks before doctors can operate on his injured right 

 knee. I spoke to our club doctor Roddy McDonald after 

 the first stage of the procedure had been done, and he explained 

 to me what the second stage would involve and that it could 

 take place in eight weeks, Newcastle coach Glenn Roeder 

 said. 

 No surgery: Real 

 Madrid: Real Madrid denied Ronaldo was to have knee surgery, saying on Thursday that doctors had simply told the Brazil striker to rest. Ronaldo returned from the World Cup with pain in his left knee that obliged him to be examined by Reals doctors, the club said on their website. The player has now been told to rest to preserve the tendon in his right knee.

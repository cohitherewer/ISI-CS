 Shevchenko keeps Spain guessing 

 - Were favourites because of the team and players we have: Fabregas 

Leipzig: It is Ukraines first World Cup match in history, and already it could be the nations most important. 

Playing powerhouse Spain in their debut Wednesday in Leipzig wont be an easy task, but Ukraine will need to prove it really belongs among soccers world elite if it hopes to gain a valuable foothold in what could be a tricky first round. We cant afford to lose our first match, captain Andriy Shevchenko said. Spain will be a tough team but we still need to win. There are more hazards ahead of us. 

A win for both Spain and Ukraine could be crucial, with African Cup of Nations champion Tunisia on the horizon. Saudi Arabia is the other team in Group H. Tunisia is just as dangerous for us, said Ukraine coach Oleg Blokhin. African teams are famous for surprising their opponents. 

Wednesdays clash marks Ukraines long-awaited debut World Cup match after years of struggle that followed the dissolution of the Soviet Union. 

For veterans Raul Gonzalez and David Villa, its the start of yet another Spanish bid for the title after 11 failed attempts. On the surface, much distinguishes the neophyte Ukrainians and the experienced Spaniards, who boast players such as Villa, Fernando Torres and Luis Garcia. 

Though Spain is a perennial soccer power making its eighth consecutive World Cup appearance, it has never come close to the title. Their best World Cup finish was fourth in 1950. 

Were the favourites because of the team and the players we have, but if we want to be first in the group we have to keep working hard, Spanish midfielder Cesc Fabregas said. We know theyre a great team. They have players like Shevchenko who can kill the game in one second. 

Both team captains are uncertain starters. 

Raul, in his third World Cup, has struggled since partially tearing the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee in November while playing with Real Madrid.Spain coach Luis Aragones seems ready to bench Raul.. Raul will probably make way for Villa, who scored 25 goals for Valencia this season, second only to FC Barcelonas Samuel Eto in the Spanish league. 

Blokhin has been evasive about whether Shevchenko is sufficiently recovered from a knee injury he picked up in May. The newly signed Chelsea strikers participation will probably be announced just an hour before the match, presumably to keep Aragones guessing. I am okay, Shevchenko said. But Blokhin and I will only decide tomorrow if I can play on his team. No one wants me to come back too early, and risk re-injury.

 South Africa wont be a cakewalk: Murali

 - Srinath begins new innings today 

 - Injury rules out Vaas 

 Muttiah Muralidharan during training on Wednesday 

Colombo: Injury-hit South Africa received unexpected support for the first Test against Sri Lanka from the man likely to cause them the biggest headache. 

Prolific spinner Muttiah Muralidharan said the Proteas will be tough to beat in the two-match series despite being crippled by the absence of three key players, including captain Graeme Smith. 

Lots of people think the series will be a cakewalk for us, but that is not going to happen, said Muralidharan. 

They are a very competitive side. They may lack two or three key players, but theyll still push us hard. We cant take them lightly. 

There was another good news coming the visitors way when Chaminda Vaas was ruled out with a hamstring injury. The 32-year-old left-arm seamer has not fully recovered from the injury which he sustained in England. 

In Vaas absence, Sri Lanka are poised to play Dilhara Fernando, Lasith Malinga and Fervez Mahroof in a three-man pace attack supported by Muralidharan. 

Wicketkeeper Prasanna Jayawardene is expected to play to allow Kumar Sangakkara to concentrate on his batting. Jayawardene hinted that Sanath Jayasuriya may once again open the innings, displacing young Michael Vandort who opened in England. 

South Africas stand-in captain Ashwell Prince said the tourists were geared for the battle ahead. 

We will obviously miss our three big players but its an opportunity for others to show their worth, said the left-handed batsman. 

Herschelle Gibbs returns as opener to partner Boeta Dippenaar after being dropped from the home series against New Zealand in April-May due to poor form. 

Former India pacer Jawagal Srinath will begin his innings as Match Referee on Friday. Srinath is the youngest member on the Elite Match Referees panel.

 India match a big one: Ponting

Chandigarh: Australian cricket team skipper Ricky Ponting said on Thursday that his team was well aware of the Indian might and his team was treating the Sundays match in Mohali as a big game. 

He said that India have match winning players and added they had been training hard to take on the opposition on their home turf. We got enough time in between the games to prepare and work hard. 

We are ready for the challenge and are hoping to have a good game of cricket, Ponting said on the sidelines of a promotional event here on Thursday evening. 

He said their last game of the ICC Champions Trophy was also important, but now the whole focus was on the next match. Its a big game for us, no doubt, he said. 

Ponting said that allrounder Shane Watson, who had to be hospitalised on Tuesday after he complained of chest and stomach pain, was much better now. 

He had a good session at the nets today, he said.

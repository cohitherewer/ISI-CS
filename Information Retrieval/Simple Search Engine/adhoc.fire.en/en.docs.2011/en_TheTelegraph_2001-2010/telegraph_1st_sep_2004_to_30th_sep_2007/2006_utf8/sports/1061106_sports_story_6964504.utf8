 Sourav holds key for East

Guwahati: Joginder Sharma gave national selectors a timely reminder of his utility with a belligerent 122, which put North in the drivers seat against East at the Nehru Stadium on Sunday. This is Sharmas second straight century in the Duleep Trophy. 

 The 24-year-old allrounder from Haryana was also involved in a 106-run sixth-wicket partnership with wicketkeeper-batsman Mahesh Rawat (62) and 72-run seven wicket stand with Gagandeep Singh (18) to help North Zone post a first innings total of 504 on Day II. 

With East precariously placed at 22 for 2 in 10.5 overs, the stage also appears just right for Sourav Ganguly to come good with the bat for himself and his team. To remind the selectors, just like Sharma on Sunday and Gautam Gambhir the day before, that he is around. 

Play was called off at 3.45 pm due to bad light. 

Before Sharma took guard, overnight batsmen Yashpal Singh and Rawat set the tone, putting 46 in the first hour, before Singh was brilliantly caught behind for 89 off Mohanty. Ashish Nehra played a sweet unbeaten cameo of 23 that included two sixes. 

East openers Subhomoy Das (1) and former international Shiv Sundar Das (4) fell with the total on 5, bringing Sourav to the crease. He looked in good nick and hit a sweetly times four.

 SSP Chowrasia finishes tied 12th

Manila: A double bogey on the 16th robbed S.S.P. Chowrasia of a chance of registering his first top-10 finish outside India as he finished tied 12th in the Philippine Open. 

At the Wack Wack Golf and Country Clubs east course, Chowrasia, who had a one-under on Sunday and even par for the tournament at the 16th tee, finished one-over for the day and two-over 290 for the tournament. 

However, Australian Scott Strange cantered to an emphatic five-shot triumph with a final round of two-under-par 70 for his second Asian Tour title. 

Among other Indians, Uttam Singh Mundy (76) and Gurbaaz Mann (77) dropped two and three strokes, respectively over the last two holes to miss out on a top-20 finish. Mundy finished at six-over 294 in tied 26th, and Mann at seven-over 295 for tied 31st. Digvijay Singh (76) and Harmeet Kahlon (78) were tied 56th and tied 62nd, respectively. 

I am yet to get used to foreign courses, but I have decided that I will go out more often on Asian Tour, said Chowrasia. 

The performance here has been Chowrasias best this season. He was 44th in Macau after a last round 76, and in the Aamby Valley Asian Masters, a final round of 77 saw him tumble down to 26th after looking good for top-10. He was also tied 36th in the Pakistan Open. 

 Randhawa slips 

Meanwhile, Indias Jyoti Randhwa slipped to tied 57th from overnight tied 32nd spot in the third round in the BMW Championship in Wentworth on Saturday. Randhawa carded a four-over 76 with two double bogeys for a three day total of three-over par 219. 

Britains David Howell maintained his three-shot lead after the third round.

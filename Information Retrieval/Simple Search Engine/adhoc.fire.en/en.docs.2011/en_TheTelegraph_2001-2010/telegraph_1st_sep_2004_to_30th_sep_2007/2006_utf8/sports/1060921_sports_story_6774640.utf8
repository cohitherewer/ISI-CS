The opening round of any tournament can be dicey. No matter where you are playing and against whom, you are always anxious to get the first match behind you. Not just me, ask all top players, theyll tell you the same thing. 

I was playing against somebody I respect a lot and with whom I had some very close matches in the past. The last time I faced Rushmi, though, was some years back and I didnt know what exactly to expect. I wanted to start off on the right note. Thankfully, I did just that. My serve, my forehand, the backhand everything clicked in the first set which I won quite easily. 

Rushmi played much better in the second set and pushed me. But since I had already got into a groove, I was able to handle the situation and win in straight sets. 

It was a very good workout for me. It felt nice to get a good match under the belt first up. And the best thing for me was that I wasnt broken even once. 

I also have to mention here that I found the court to my liking. Its a little faster than the one we had at the Indoor Stadium last year and that should suit me better. 

Next up for me is Sandra Kloesel. I have played the girl she beat on Wednesday, Voskoboeva, but not Kloesel. I got some feedback from Kloesels match and hope to use the information when I face her on Thursday. 

As Ive said before, I dont expect any easy matches on the Tour. Everyone plays tough tennis simply because we all make a living out of the game. Just as I would be trying my utmost to win, so will Kloesel. 

Ill need all the help I can from the wonderful crowd. I had expected the Calcutta fans to be very supportive and knowledgeable, they didnt disappoint me on Tuesday. I hope they would turn up in bigger numbers to cheer me on the rest of the week. 

It was so nice to have Sourav coming over to see my match. He has been a great supporter and I want to thank him from the bottom of my heart. 

This is a very important tournament for me. I am eager to do well, not only for myself but my fans as well. Thats why I am trying to minimise my off-court activities. Its not easy, especially when Im playing at home, but I am sure everyone understands tennis is priority No. 1.

 Simpson needs to change with times: Buchanan

 Coaching has evolved, feels Buchanan 

Sydney: Former Australian coach Bob Simpson should change with the times and understand the role of the modern-day coach, national coach John Buchanan said on Monday. 

Simpson, 70, who will later be inducted into Cricket Australias (CA) Hall of Fame, has criticised contemporary coaches methods. 

The former Test captain said coaches should spend less time behind the laptop analysing statistics and more time developing players ability. 

Simpson was appointed Australias first full-time coach two decades ago and his ability to transform a struggling cricket nation to a World Cup-winning side within a couple of years was credited as the start of Australias resurgence as a power. 

Although a fan of using video analysis for reviewing players techniques, Simpson questioned the effectiveness of computer analysis over the game itself. 

Weve got all the computers and weve got everything like that and youd think that youd get your fielding positions perfect wouldnt you?, Simpson said on Monday. 

You should know where the ball is. Why do we have two men behind square leg? Why do we have no one at third man for so long when something like 25-30 percent of all runs are scored at third man? 

But Buchanan, a former university lecturer who guided Australia to a successful World Cup defence in 2003 and kept the side on top of the Test rankings, hit back at Simpsons criticism. 

I think sometimes people make comments out of ignorance, Buchanan told Australian Associated Press. 

I really just think people dont understand what the role of the coach is now, he said. Its evolving with new technology. It doesnt mean what was done before was wrong. 

For those people who choose to criticise they should spend some time with the team and try to come to terms with whats required. (AFP)

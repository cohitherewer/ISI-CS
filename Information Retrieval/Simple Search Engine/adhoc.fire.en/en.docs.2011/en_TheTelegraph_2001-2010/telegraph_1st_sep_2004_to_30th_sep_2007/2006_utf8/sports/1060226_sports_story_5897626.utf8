 Flintoffs wickets best: Patel

Vadodara: Munaf Patel, who finished with a match-haul of 10 wickets for Board Presidents XI against England, said he cherished Andrew Flintoffs wickets the most. Patel had dismissed the English allrounder in both the innings. 

Flintoffs wickets were the best, the 22-year-old said. 

England made 238 and 158 and the hosts replied with 342 and 58 for two to romp home to a eight-wicket victory. Patel grabbed five for 59 on the opening day and five for 32 on the third and final day. 

It has been a complete turnaround for the native of Ikhar, Gujarat, who had gone out of the national reckoning with the same speed with which he had appeared on the scene three years ago. 

Patel played a tour match against New Zealand in 2003-04, but was soon out of action due to an injury. He picked five wickets in that match while playing for India A and must take motivation from the fact that his then teammate, Sreesanth, has earned a call up now. 

I have improved a lot on my line and length as well as fitness. Working with Darren Holder who was the coach of Maharashtra team has helped. And I recently had a stint with Dennis Lillee at the MRF Pace Foundation, said the youngster. 

England coach Duncan Fletcher had a word of praise for Patel. The seamer used the pitch. He got some reverse swing going, Fletcher said. (PTI)

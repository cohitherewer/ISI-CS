The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Bhutia hints at retirement, again

 - Ill be happy if a deserving player takes my place 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Doha: The gigantic Al-Rayyan Sports Complex has a striking similarity with an oasis in the desert. Spread well over a couple of miles in a deserted area, the facilities at the stadium simply have to be seen to be believed. 

After walking through the main gate, one is greeted by the huge doom of the indoor stadium that reaches up into the sky. On the left is the football stadium with a lush green pitch that will host quite a few matches in the group league. 

There are more surprises in store when one walks into the big open space between the two complexes. With temporary stands being erected on either side, there are three hockey fields that are being used for the womens competition. 

On the far side are the two full size practice football grounds. On early Friday morning, with hardly a soul around, the ground was being used by a team that has lost its way in the Games even before it could officially begin. 

Skipper Bhaichung Bhutia, however, was not ready to accept defeat so easily. The mathematics of football could be different on the field, he said. Let us first win the match against the Maldives. Then we should think about Iran. 

The Indian captain, however, hinted that he was seriously thinking about calling it a day from international football after the Asian Games. When asked about his future plans, Bhutia said he would like to talk to his family first before taking a final decision. 

I havent taken a final decision yet. Let me go back to Calcutta and talk to my wife first, he said. Bhutia, in fact, was of the opinion that since India s next campaign would be under-23 pre-Olympics, he may not be needed to serve the team at the moment. 

Houghton is looking for new boys now. He is trying to rebuild the side. I would be more than happy if a deserving player takes my place. I should not block a youngsters way, the ace striker said. 

Chief coach Bob Houghton also indicated that he has been looking forward to pick up more youngsters next year. The senior team that played against Saudi Arabia and Japan in the Asian Cup qualifiers only played in phases. The present lot of youngsters is dishing out something little better. 

In the last four matches we played, these young boys proved they have been improving steadily. By the end of next year, I should be able to know where exactly they stand, the chief coach said. 

On Bhutias performance, the Briton smiled and said: Because of his injury he couldnt practice for a week in between. Its fine when you are 21, but when you are 31 it certainly doesnt help in improving performance.

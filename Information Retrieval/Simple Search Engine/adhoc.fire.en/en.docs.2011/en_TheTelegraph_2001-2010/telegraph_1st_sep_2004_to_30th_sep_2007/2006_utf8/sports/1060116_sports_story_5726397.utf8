Honolulu: Indias Arjun Atwal fired three birdies but then dropped two shots on the 16th and 18th to finish at one-under 69 at the $5.1 million Sony Open at the par-70 Waialae Golf and Country Club here. 

Atwal slipped from overnight 17th to tied 30th. 

David Toms birdied the final hole for a tournament record, nine-under-par 61 to move into a share of the lead with Chad Campbell after Saturdays third round. 

Campbell, co-leader overnight, fired an eight-birdie 62 to end a relatively calm day of bright sunshine, level with fellow American Toms at 14-under 196. 

The pair, playing in the final group with 1996 champion Jim Furyk, matched each other with sparkling approach play and ice-cool putting as the 2006 PGA Tours second event developed into a two-horse race. 

After scoring birdies on ninth, 11th and 14th holes, Atwals last miss was an eight-footer for par on 18th, and is now at two-under 208 for 54 holes and 12 off the leaders. 

Daniel Chopra ended the third day with a par 70 with four each of birdies and bogeys and slipped from 40th to tied 51st for a total of one-over 211. 

K. J. Choi fired a birdie on the closing 18th for a two-under 69 and was still Asias best bet at five-under 205 at the years first full field event on the PGA Tour. He was tied eighth place in a group of eight that also included defending champion Vijai Singh (65) and the in-form Stuart Appleby (69), winner of Mercedes Championships. 

Bubba Watson (66) and Shane Bertsch (63) were tied for third at seven-under 203. Jim

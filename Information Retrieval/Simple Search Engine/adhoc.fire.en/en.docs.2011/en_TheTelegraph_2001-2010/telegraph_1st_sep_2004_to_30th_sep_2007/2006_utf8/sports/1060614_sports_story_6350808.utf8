 Cafu acquitted

Rome: Brazil captain Cafu was acquitted of passport fraud on Tuesday, a defence lawyer said. 

AS Roma owner Franco Sensi and former argentine player Gustavo Bartelt were also acquitted, said lawyer Pierpaolo DellAnno. 

Prosecutors had alleged that Cafu and Bartelt used false passports to gain Italian citizenship and join Roma, circumventing rules that limit the number of non-European Union players joining Italian clubs. 

DellAnno said the court would formally indicate its reasons for the decision later. Both players had been investigated over several years, and Bartelt was suspended for 12 months in 2001 by the Italian Soccer Federation. (AP)

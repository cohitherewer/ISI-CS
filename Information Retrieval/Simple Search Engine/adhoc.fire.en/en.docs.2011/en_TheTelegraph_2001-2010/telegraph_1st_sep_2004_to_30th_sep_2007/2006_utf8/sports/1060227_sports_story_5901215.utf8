 England call up Shah

Nagpur: England on Sunday called in Owais Shah following the pull out of vice-captain Marcus Trescothick from the India tour due to personal reasons. 

Karachi-born Shah, who was with the England A squad currently touring the West Indies, would join the team here on Tuesday, a day before the first Test starts, England team media manager Andrew Walpole said. 

 The visitors were facing a fitness 

 crisis with skipper Michael Vaughan suffering from soreness 

 in his right knee, and Kevin Pietersen recovering from a 

 back injury. 

Vaughan looked a doubtful starter and a decision on him is expected to be made on Monday while the visitors were reasonably hopeful of playing Pietersen. 

Fast bowler Simon Jones and spinner Shaun Udal along with Vaughan, missed the three-day first class match that ended in Vadodara on Saturday. 

 Paul Collingwood too had a back spasm during a warm 

 up match in Mumbai and Liam Plunkett bruised his left heel 

 at Vadodara but both were said to have recovered. 

 Alastair Cook and James Anderson 

 ? who were earlier drafted in as cover for the injured players 

 in the England squad ? reached Nagpur late on Sunday.

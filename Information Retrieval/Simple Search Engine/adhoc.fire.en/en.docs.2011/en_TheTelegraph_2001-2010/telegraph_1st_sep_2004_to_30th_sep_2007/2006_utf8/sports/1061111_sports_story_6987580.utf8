The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Mani has advisor status

 - Former ICC president to have big say in the awarding of TV and sponsorship rights for 2007-2015 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Ehsan Mani 

Calcutta: Former International Cricket Council (ICC) president Ehsan Mani, who was the finance and marketing committee chairman when the commercial rights for 2000-2007 were sold, will have a big role in deals to be struck for the period 2007-2015: He has officially been appointed an advisor. 

Mr Manis experience is going to be very handy, which is why he was requested to stay on board in an advisory capacity even after relinquishing (the presidents) office earlier this year, a well-placed source told The Telegraph. 

The London-based Mani is a banker by profession. 

The 2000-2007 rights, it may be recalled, were bagged by World Sports Group for $550 million. The highest (combined) bid, though, had come from Zee and Trans World International. 

Its to be seen whether the ICC again chooses comfort over cash. 

Bids for the TV rights have already been invited and the tenders are expected to be opened in Dubai on Saturday. 

To eliminate the possibility of accusations of any kind, a lawyers firm has been given the task of stamping each page of the tender documents Evaluating them will be the next stage, the source added. 

A former partner of PricewaterhouseCoopers is going to be involved, too. 

The sponsorship rights will be decided after the TV issue has been settled. A package (for the sponsors) cant be put together till its known who does the telecasting, the source pointed out. 

Who gets the TV rights should be clear by mid-December, by when the next Executive Board meeting is likely to be held. 

The ICC stands to make many, many millions more as the rights for 2007-2015 are going to include the Twenty20 World Cups as well. 

Potentially, that form alone is a huge money-spinner.

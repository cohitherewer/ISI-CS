 Lara: Must make use of hectic schedule 

 - Were here to win, not experiment: Buchanan 

 Brian Lara 

Kuala Lumpur: West Indies captain Brian Lara has asked his players to stop worrying about the hectic schedule ahead and instead treat it as an opportunity to prove themselves and improve the teams rankings. 

Burnout will always be a factor and there will always be a concern. I hope, however, that the guys dont miss the most important parts of the two-year period, Lara said, ahead of the tri-series starting here on Tuesday. 

Laras men take on three-time world champions Australia in the series opener on Tuesday. We want to play cricket. We are languishing near the bottom of world cricket in both forms of the game, so we need to play cricket to lift our game, and we need to start winning to lift our spirits. 

West Indies next travel to India for the Champions Trophy from October 7 to November 5, where they are the defending champions. The team then proceeds to play three Tests and five one-dayers before returning to India for a five-match one-day series in January. 

They then head back home to be ready for the World Cup in March-April on their home soil. And that only sets the tone for the visit to England followed by the Twenty20 world championship in South Africa and Test series in South Africa, Zimbabwe. 

We will have burn-outs and we will have injuries at some time, but the exposure the West Indies team will be getting will be very important, Lara was quoted as saying in the media. 

I hope that the guys will see it necessary to get themselves fully focussed-mentally and physically. Its necessary for us to play and wind our way back to the top. 

Meanwhile, the Aussies were looking anxiously at the skys as sudden downpours in the afternoon are common in this tropical country. 

Asked if bad weather could spoil the teams preparation for the Champions Trophy, coach John Buchanan said, hopefully not. (But) then the curator said the weather in Malaysia is very unpredictable at this time of year. 

Buchanan, who is to step down at the end of the World Cup, said although the Aussies had brought an 18-member squad, playing to win, rather than experimentation, will be the teams prime objective. The tournaments not experimental. Were here to play the best cricket we possibly can at this point in time, he said. 

Speedster Brett Lee is keen to make use of the tri-series to get into the groove ahead of the Champions Trophy, a tournament they are yet to win. 

Its a good chance to get out there, the ball will swing around a fair bit, Lee said in media reports. Weve just finished a bit of a run and sweats pouring out, but it is pretty warm here, quite humid. It is like playing in India too I think, from what Ive been told. (PTI)

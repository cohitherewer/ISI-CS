The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 I can always come back: Dalmiya

 -Cant sit quiet seeing CAB in trouble 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Biswanath Dutt has decided to make a comeback after Jagmohan Dalmiya resigned from the presidents post. The Telegraph spoke to both Wednesday. The following are excerpts (alphabetically): 

JAGMOHAN DALMIYA: No one from the CAB has asked me to step down. The BCCI is talking about a non-existent rule. The CAB is being threatened and hounded owing to pre-determined and vindictive moves by the current BCCI regime. Some members feel I am using the associations platform, and so, Ive decided to fight it out on my own. My priority is to get my name cleared. I will go all out and see the end of it. Under the circumstances, I thought its much better to step down I can always come back when the circumstances are back to normal. 

BISWANATH DUTT: I think Dalmiya has done the right thing at the right time. Ive decided to take charge at this critical juncture because Dalmiya told me that if you take charge things can be set right. There have been requests from Siddhartha Shankar Ray and Somnath Chatterjee. How can I turn down all the requests? I am not in good health, yet, Ive decided to sacrifice my personal interests for the sake of CAB Its not that Im enjoying the role. How can I sit quiet even after seeing CAB in trouble?

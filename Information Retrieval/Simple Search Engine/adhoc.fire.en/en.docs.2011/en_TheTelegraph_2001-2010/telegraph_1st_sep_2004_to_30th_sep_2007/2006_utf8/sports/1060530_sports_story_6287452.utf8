 Srikkanth slams team policy 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: Former India captain Krishnamachari Srikkanth on Monday held Rahul Dravid and Greg Chappell responsible for Indias 1-4 defeat against the West Indies. 

According to the former dashing opener, the captain and the coach shuffled the batting order too many times and messed up the whole thing. The Indian batting order was shuffled too many times. That was one of the prime reasons why our batsmen failed to deliver, said Srikkanth, who was in the capital along with Vinod Kambli to launch his website www. kriscricket.com. 

One-day cricket is after all a batsmans game. You cant win a match if the top order fails. It happened with India there. The batting order shouldnt be shuffled beyond a point. If I were the captain or the coach, I wouldnt have sent Dravid to open, Srikkanth said. 

After all, he is our best batsman. And the best batsman should normally be sent at the number three position. Dravid should have been guiding the team in the middle order. 

Srikkanths views were echoed by Vinod Kambli when he was asked to comment on the subject. Dravid shouldnt open. It created problems in batting order throughout the one-day series. Its time India got a better opener, he said. 

Ganguly has done well in the past. I feel he has some cricket still left in him. I hope he gets runs in County cricket. It will help him in the season ahead, Kambli remarked.

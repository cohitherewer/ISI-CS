 Ntini: Souravs wicket special 

 - We arent taking anything for granted: Smith 

South African captain Graeme Smith and MoM Makhaya Ntini took questions after the second Test, on Saturday. The following are excerpts: 

SMITH: Im very proud of the boys... A lot had been going around, but being honest about where we needed to improve helped... There had been a lot of junk (in the Media), but we used it as a motivation... It also gave the boys a different perspective... When I woke up and saw the clouds from my hotel room this morning, I cursed Durban... The start (of Day V) was delayed, but I remained hopeful... Wed got one key wicket (Rahul Dravids) yesterday and wanted the other one (V.V.S.) Laxman... Despite the win, we arent taking anything for granted... We respect cricket and we respect India... Personally, Im happy to have got some runs (50-plus in the second innings)... Its important to see the new ball through and I took some big steps in this Test... 

NTINI: (Sourav) Gangulys wicket was special... I enjoy bowling to left-handers and like giving a tough time to Ganguly... I didnt do anything very differently from the first Test, except having a chat with Ian Bishop... Hes not my idol, but I speak to him whenever opportunities arise... (Debutant Morne) Morkel had to make full use of the opportunity... He did... 

Bishop, meanwhile, revealed that hed only asked Ntini to work on his rhythm.

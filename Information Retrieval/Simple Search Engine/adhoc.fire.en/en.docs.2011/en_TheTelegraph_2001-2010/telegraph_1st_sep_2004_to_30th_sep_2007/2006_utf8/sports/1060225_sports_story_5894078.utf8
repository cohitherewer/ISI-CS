 Woolmer vacation irks Inzamam

 - Coach, support staff sanctioned leave

Islamabad: Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq has expressed his displeasure over special vacations granted to coach Bob Woolmer and his support staff by Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) ahead of the upcoming series against Sri Lanka. 

Woolmer, teams trainer Murray Stevenson and physiotherapist Darryn Lifsun have gone on another vacation after the home series against India and are slated to return to Lahore next month when the training camp for the Sri Lanka tour starts around March 6. 

According to a report in a Pakistan daily, Inzamam conveyed his surprise at the trainer and physio being allowed to go on leave when he was himself recovering from a back injury and some other players also required every-day attention in their rehabilitation process. 

Inzamam is not happy because he has to follow certain exercises and training regimes which need to be monitored by specialists to regain full fitness and recover from his back problem before the tour of Sri Lanka next month, a PCB source was quoted as saying. 

Inzamam is also surprised at the absence of the three because there is little time before the Lanka tour and after the ODI series defeat to India. Inzamam is keen to put the team back on track, sit down and analyse what went wrong, the source said. (PTI)

 Sourav scores 9

London: Sourav Gangulys County stint appears to be drawing to a disappointing close with the former Team India captain scoring just nine for Northamptonshire in a four-day County Championship Division II match against Essex here on Wednesday. 

Sourav struck two fours off 11 balls before he was caught by Ben Phillip off James Middlebrook on the opening day. 

Zaheer Khan also met with similar luck, going wicketless in his 11-over spell against Derbyshire.

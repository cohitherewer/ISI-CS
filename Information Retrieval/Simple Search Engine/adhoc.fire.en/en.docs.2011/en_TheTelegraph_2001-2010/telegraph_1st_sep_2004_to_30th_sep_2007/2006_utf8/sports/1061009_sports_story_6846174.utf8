 Mann ends tied 17th

Taipei: Gurbaaz Mann fired his best round of the week and with an effort of four-under 68, finished tied 17th at the $300,000 Taiwan Open on Sunday. 

Shiv Shankar Prasad Chowrasia, the other Indian to make the cut, shot an under-par score of two-under 70 to finish tied 40th, up from tied 61st overnight. Chowrasia, with rounds of 76, 69, 76 and 70, totalled three-over 291. 

Manns four rounds were 72, 74, 72 and 68 as he, registering his best finish on the Asian Tour, aggregated two-under 286 to pick up $3,720. 

Chowrasia, who earned $1,830, is now 56th on the money list and is in line to pick up his full Asian Tour card for 2007 besides earning a berth into Volvo Masters of Asia. 

Chinese Taipeis Lin Wen-tang secured his maiden title on the Asian Tour with a three-stroke victory. The 32-year-old Lin led by two strokes after three rounds. On the final day, he carded a closing three-under-par 69 at the Sunrise Golf and Country Club to push Scotsman Simon Yates into second place by three shots. 

It was a long-awaited triumph for Lin, who had previously amassed 15 top-10s, including two runner-up finishes in 80 starts on the Asian Tour since 1998. But, in front of his home crowd, Lin produced a masterly performance to join his younger brother Wen-ko as a tour champion. Yates played a final round of 68 and made a determined charge, but Lin made few errors as he held on to close a fine win. (PTI)

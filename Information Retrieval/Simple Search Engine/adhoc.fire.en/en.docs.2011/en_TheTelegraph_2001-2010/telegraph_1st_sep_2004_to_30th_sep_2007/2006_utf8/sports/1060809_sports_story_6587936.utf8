The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Another players body in offing 

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: Following a period of hibernation, Indian footballers appear to have made significant headway towards forming their own association. 

Though no players, currently undergoing the national camp for the AFC Asian Cup qualifier against Saudi Arabia here, have said anything, it has been learnt that a formal announcement to this effect could be made in as early as the next week. 

Ive no comment, Bhaichung Bhutia said when his view was sought on the subject. 

In the past, the players tried to form an association at least on two occasions in the 80s and late 90s and both attempts failed before they actually took any shape. 

The current players were understood to have taken the step towards it during the first camp under the new coach Bob Houghton in Goa. 

Interestingly, the AFC guidelines to the AIFF dont mention any professional association by the players. But according to a senior AIFF official, the federation wont object to such body from the players.

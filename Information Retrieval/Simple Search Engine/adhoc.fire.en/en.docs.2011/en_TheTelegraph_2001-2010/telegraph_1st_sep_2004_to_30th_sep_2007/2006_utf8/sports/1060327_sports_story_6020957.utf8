Madrid: Barcelonas march towards the Primera Liga title slowed on Saturday after a goalless draw at bottom side Malaga, although second-placed Osasuna failed to capitalise as they lost 0-1 away to Athletic Bilbao. 

Barcelona had a goal ruled out in the first-half and Samuel Eto hit the bar at the end, while Malaga goalkeeper Francesc Arnau made a string of impressive saves. 

The draw saw leaders Barcelona move 13 points clear of Osasuna on 68 points after Bilbao defender Luis Prieto headed the only goal of the game in an intense encounter in San Mames. 

Both sides finished with 10 men after Osasunas Ludovic Delporte and Bilbaos Ismael Urzaiz were sent off at the end. 

Earlier, two first-half goals from Brazilian striker Robert gave Real Betis a surprise 2-1 win at eighth-placed Villarreal. 

Robert scored a superb diving header, and then pounced on an error in the defence for the second. 

Villarreal pulled a goal back through Argentine midfielder Juan Pablo Sorin 11 minutes from time and were denied a penalty in the last move of the game. 

The win dragged an improving Betis five points above the relegation zone up to 13th, level with Bilbao on 33 points. 

Meanwhile, Serie A leaders Juventus were held to a 1-1 draw at home by AS Roma on Saturday allowing rivals AC Milan to cut their lead to eight points with their 3-1 victory over Fiorentina. 

Juventus led through a 35th minute header from Brazilian midfielder Emerson but had Pavel Nedved sent off on the stroke of halftime. 

Down to 10 men for the second half, Juventus looked to have held on but five minutes from the end Roma drew level with a header from Moroccan midfielder Houssine Kharja. 

At the San Siro, Milan came from behind to beat Fiorentina comfortably after Italy international and Serie As top scorer Luca Toni had put the Florence side ahead in the 13th minute with his 25th strike of the season.

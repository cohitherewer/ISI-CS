The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 David hopes to be Indias Rooney

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Hailing from a remote state such as Mizoram doesnt stop David Lalranmuana from dreaming big. 

David, the teenage striker of the U-15 Mohun Bagan SAIL Football Academy side which won the south-east Asian leg of the Manchester United Premier Cup, idolises Wayne Rooney. 

And as luck would have it, the teenager, who was the leading goal scorer in the just-concluded meet, accompanied by his teammates, would be flying to England to take part in the final round in August against Rooneys side and other top European clubs such as Arsenal and Inter Milan. 

It was a great feeling, said David after arriving in Calcutta on Monday. 

Academy chief coach Jahar Das had earlier said David is a good prospect for Indian football and on Monday, U-15 coach Shyamal Banerjee echoed the same opinion. 

We have created history. I think we have an excellent supply line for the senior team, remarked Banerjee. 

The team will be feted on Mohun Bagan Day (July 30).

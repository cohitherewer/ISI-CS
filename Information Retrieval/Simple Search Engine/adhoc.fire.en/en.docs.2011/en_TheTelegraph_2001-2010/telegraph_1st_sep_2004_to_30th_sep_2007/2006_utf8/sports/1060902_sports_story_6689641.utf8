The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Tri-series squad may have 16

 - Anil Kumbles recovery for Champions Trophy on track 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Kumble 

 Calcutta: The Board of 

 Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) wont object if 

 the senior national selectors wish to send a 16th player 

 for the September 12-24 tri-series in Kuala Lumpur. While 

 the West Indies have picked 14, world champions Australia 

 have chosen as many as 18. 

 That wont be a problem, 

 even though all teams are supposed to pick only 15... The 

 expenses of the extra player will then be taken care of 

 by the BCCI, secretary Niranjan Shah told The 

 Telegraph on Friday evening. In any case, the tournament 

 has been put together by the BCCI. 

The squad is to be chosen in Mumbai on Sunday afternoon. The Champions Trophy 14 is also going to be picked at the same meeting. Shah confirmed captain Rahul Dravid and coach Greg Chappell will be present. 

In normal circumstances, the BCCI would have insisted on just 15 being picked, but the Champions Trophy isnt many weeks away and, so, the selectors may want some kind of rest and rotation in Kuala Lumpur. An extra player is going to be required for that, Shah added. 

While its to be seen whether a 16th player is chosen, its certain that the squad which went to Sri Lanka and returned without playing a single ODI will be retained. 

After all, on what grounds can anybody be dropped? 

Shah, meanwhile, informed that Anil Kumbles recovery from tendinitis on his right shoulder is on track. I spoke to the physio (John Gloster) earlier in the day and he indicated things are fine... In fact, hes confident Kumble is going be fit before our first match in the Champions Trophy (October 15, against England)... 

The veteran, who will turn 36 next month, is currently on a rehab programme in hometown Bangalore. 

 With such a positive medical update, Kumbles 

 return to the one-day squad after 13 months is as good as 

 guaranteed. Ramesh Powar is the one expected to make way.

 Donald withdraws 

Johannesburg: Allan Donald has withdrawn his application for the post of England bowling coach and will remain involved with his countrys high performance coaching programme. 

I have given much thought to the matter and have withdrawn my application for the England bowling coach post, Donald said in a statement released on Friday by Cricket South Africa. 

I will rather stay with Cricket South Africas high performance programme and throw my full weight behind it. My heart lies with South African cricket. (Reuters)

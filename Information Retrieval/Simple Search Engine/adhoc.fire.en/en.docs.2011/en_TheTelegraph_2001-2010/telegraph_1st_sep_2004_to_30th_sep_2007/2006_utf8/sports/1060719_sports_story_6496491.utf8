 Strauss defends declaration 

London: Acting England captain Andrew Strauss defended his decision to delay a declaration into the final day of the drawn first Test against Pakistan at Lords on Monday. 

Strauss decided to continue batting for 34 minutes on Monday before declaring Englands second innings at 296 for eight, leaving Pakistan a target of 380 from 80 overs. 

Monty got extravagant movement at times and sometimes he got too much down the hill, added Strauss. To win we probably needed one of those days where everything went right. 

Most of our boys are young and its the first time theyve played at Lords, Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq said. 

Strauss will step down as soon as allrounder Andy Flintoff is available again. 

Flintoff, playing for Lancashire, lasted just 10 minutes, made four versus Kent on Day I of their four-day County match on Tuesday. 

 Backing for Mushtaq 

Meanwhile, veteran leg spinner Mushtaq Ahmed has received the backing of Pakistan selectors for a possible recall to the injury-hit side for the second Test. 

It all depends on the teams planning for the Test. If Inzamam wants to play him because of special circumstances, we will support him, chief selector Wasim Bari said on Tuesday.

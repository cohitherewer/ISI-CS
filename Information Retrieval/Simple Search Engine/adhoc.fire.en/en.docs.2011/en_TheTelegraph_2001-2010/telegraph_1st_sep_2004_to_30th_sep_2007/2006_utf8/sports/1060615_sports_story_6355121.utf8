 Bopanna puts up a fight vs Federer

Halle: Rohan Bopanna put up a fight before going down to Roger Federer in the first round of the $ 800,000 Gerry Weber Open here on Wednesday. Bopanna, ranked 267th, went down 6-7 (4-7), 2-6 to the world No. 1 in the grasscourt event. 

The 26-year-old Indian served six aces and saved four breakpoints in the first set, pushing it into the tie-breaker. But double-faults, which have been Bopannas bane for long, began to catch up with him. 

There were as many as four of them in the second set, seven in all, by Bopanna even as Federer began to pull away. 

The second set also marked a drop in the Indians first serve percentage, from 50 in the first set to 32. 

Bopanna couldnt take the two breakpoints that came his way in the final set. 

I learnt that I have to be really solid. Playing the crucial points is the key, Bopanna said later. 

 Paes-Damm out 

Meanwhile, Leander Paes and Martin Damm, seeded third, suffered a shock 6-7 (4-7), 6-4, 8-10 loss against Chriss Haggard of South Africa and Czech Republics Jiri Novak in the first round of mens doubles. (Pti)

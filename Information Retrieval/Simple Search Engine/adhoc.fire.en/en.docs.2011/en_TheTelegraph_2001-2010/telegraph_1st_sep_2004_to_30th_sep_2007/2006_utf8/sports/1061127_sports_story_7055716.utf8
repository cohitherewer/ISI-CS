The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Foreigners hold the key in Durand final

 - Spotlight on Beto, Chidi in Dempo vs JCT battle 

JAYDEEP BASU

 Chidi 

New Delhi: The Durand Cup organisers, of late, have stopped complaining. There was a time when Durand Cup without a Calcutta team in the final, would be deemed as a meaningless affair by the tournament officials. The attendance in the stands would invariably be thin, the media coverage would drastically be reduced and the organisers would be low in their morale. 

Things have changed now. The domination of Calcutta teams in Durand is now a part of history. And on Monday, when Goas Dempo Sports Club take on JCT Mills, Phagwara in their maiden quest to win India s oldest and the most prestigious tournament, there would hardly be anyone around to shed tears for the absence of two so called Calcutta giants. 

Rather, there could be enthusiastic spectators to debate whether Goa and Punjab have grabbed the two top spot in Indian football. Going by the results in the last one week at the Ambedkar Stadium, the final match could well be termed as a battle between two of the best teams in the country. 

But then, to put it frankly, both Dempo and JCT owe their current success more to their foreign players than the sons of the soil. While the freshly recruited foreigners of East Bengal, Churchill Brothers and Mahindra United struggled to perform, Dempo and JCT chose the tested ones, who were able to deliver the goods. 

To say that the final may turn out to be a battle between Dempos Roberto Beto Silva and JCTs Edeh Chidi wont be an overstatement. In the semi-finals on Saturday, both displayed exceptional skills to steer their respective teams to the final. While the JCT coach Sukhwinder Singh is busy chalking out plans to thwart Beto in the midfield, Dempo may go for special markings to keep Chidi in check. 

The convincing victory over Mohun Bagan in the semi-final has given Dempo a new-found confidence. If we can play like that, then no one can stop us from winning, said Dempo assistant coach Maurice Afonso. We have never won the Durand Cup. This time we will not allow it to slip out of our hands. Dempo, however, will be poorer by the absence of their star midfielder Clifford Miranda, who has earned two yellow cards.

London: England striker Wayne Rooney hit a quick-fire double, his first league goals of the year, to power Manchester United to a 2-0 victory over Newcastle United at Old Trafford on Sunday. 

Uniteds one-sided victory consolidated second place on 60 points although they still trail champions Chelsea, who beat Tottenham Hotspur 2-1 on Saturday, by 15 points. 

France striker Thierry Henry scored twice, including a winner seven minutes from time, as Arsenal defeated third-placed Liverpool 2-1. 

Henry pounced on Steven Gerrards backpass to cap a fine week for Arsene Wengers side, who overcame Real Madrid on Wednesday to reach the Champions League quarter-finals. 

Henrys goal came a minute after Spaniard Xabi Alonso had been sent off for his second yellow card. Luis Garcia had hauled Liverpool level on 76 minutes. 

Liverpool have 55 points from 29 games, followed by Tottenham on 49 and Arsenal on 47. 

In Sundays other game, England striker Darren Bent, who made his debut against Uruguay this month, hit an 87th-minute winner for Charlton Athletic who defeated Middlesbrough 2-1. 

Meanwhile, Real Madrid had to settle for a 0-0 draw at Valencia in the Primera Liga on Saturday after substitute Ronaldo spurned a golden opportunity to give his side victory when he missed a last-minute penalty. 

The Brazilian, who was dropped to the bench by Real coach Juan Ramon Lopez Caro, earned the spot-kick after he was fouled by Santiago Canizares but the Valencia goalkeeper atoned for his error when he saved Ronaldos low shot. 

Barcelona top the table on 61 points, Valencia and Real have 52 and Osasuna are six further back with 46. 

Earlier, Celta Vigo missed their chance to move into the Champions League places when they lost 2-0 at 10-man Espanyol. 

The defeat meant the Galicians, who had won four of their last five games, remain fifth a point behind Osasuna. 

Real s first clear opportunity did not come until just before the break when Valencia striker David Villa had a goal-bound free kick tipped over the bar by Iker Casillas. 

Valencia continued their pressing game in midfield in the second half and although Real had more possession they had problems getting near the opposition area. 

Lopez Caro sent Ronaldo on in place of Raul just after the hour, although it was his strike partner Baptista who almost opened the scoring a few minutes later. 

The Italian had a hand in winning the penalty when he exchanged a neat one-two with Ronaldo a minute from time. 

The Brazilian was felled by Canizares as he burst towards goal but was then denied his 11th goal of the season when the Valencia keeper went the right way to save his spot kick.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 I dont react in extremes, says Greg

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Kuala Lumpur: Over the years, Ive learnt not to get either too excited or too dejected... I dont react in extremes, was Greg Chappells response when The Telegraph asked whether hed got over the disappointment of Team Indias poor show in the tri-series here. 

Interacting briefly at breakfast time, Sunday, the coach added: There are always some positives to come out even in defeats... However, Ive come to accept that everything (in India) is driven by results only... In fact, Dinesh Mongias comeback (against Australia) wasnt the solitary positive, but... Having said all that, a loss is a loss... 

The Indians won just one match, the second versus the West Indies, and didnt make the final. They were, of course, widely expected to not merely because of a higher ranking than the West Indies, mind you. 

Chappell didnt leave with the team, Saturday, as hes going off to Adelaide to meet his ailing mother. Shes 85 and probably requires surgery. I wouldnt like to say anything more... Hes in Kuala Lumpur till Monday. 

Its expected that Chappell will be back in India in the first week of October.

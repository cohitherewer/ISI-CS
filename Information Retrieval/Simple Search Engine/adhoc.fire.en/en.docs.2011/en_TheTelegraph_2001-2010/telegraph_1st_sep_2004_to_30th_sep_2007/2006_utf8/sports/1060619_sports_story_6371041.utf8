 Strong tackles part of game, says Ballack

Berlin: Michael Ballack said on Sunday that he would be his usual aggressive self against Ecuador in Germanys final group game, even though he has a yellow card against his name. 

Its very difficult to hold back at the World Cup, the Germany captain said on Sunday. We want to win this game, play well and keep our confidence high. Strong tackling is part of the game. 

Germany have ruled out resting Ballack for Tuesdays match at the Olympiastadion, when they will have to beat Ecuador to secure first place in Group A. 

Another yellow card would rule Ballack out of the second round match, which is likely to be against Sweden or England. 

The defenders have found themselves, Ballack said. 

You need consistency and stability in defence.

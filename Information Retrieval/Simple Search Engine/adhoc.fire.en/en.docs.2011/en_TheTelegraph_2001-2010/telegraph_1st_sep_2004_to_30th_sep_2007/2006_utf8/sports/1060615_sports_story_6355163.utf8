 Card woes bother Hiddink

 - Aussie coach ponders selection ahead of Brazil match 

 Guus Hiddink 

Stuttgart: Guus Hiddink is pondering sitting out players with yellow cards for Australias next World Cup match against defending champion Brazil rather than risk them missing the subsequent Group F match against Croatia. 

Goalscorers Tim Cahill and John Aloisi, midfielder Vince Grella and defender Craig Moore were all cautioned in the Socceroos 3-1 comeback win over Japan on Monday in Kaiserslautern. 

A player who picks up two yellow cards gets a one-game suspension. After the first round, players on one yellow get a clean slate for the knockout rounds. 

Brazil opened with a 1-0 win over Croatia in Berlin on Tuesday and go into Sundays match against Australia in Munich as hot favourites regardless of what squad Hiddink selects. I have to think strongly if I can use all the players (against Brazil), Hiddink was quoted saying Wednesday on the Australian football federations website. 

 One of the negative aspects of the game (Monday) was that we had some silly yellow cards, which we talked about before the game, so there is a little bit of criticism from my side to that. 

Moore and Grella both started against Japan. Cahill, who is recovering from a knee injury and Aloisi, came off the bench. 

 Brazil and Australia both have three points in the group while Croatia and Japan have none. With Brazil expected to win the group, the Australia versus Croatia match on June 22 in Stuttgart could determine who joins the Brazilians in the knockout round of 16. 

Australia beat Brazil 1-0 the last time they met, but the South Americans were fielding a second-tier side at the 2001 Confederations Cup. The loss cost Brazilian coach Emerson Leao his job, although an earlier 0-0 tie with Canada could not have helped his cause. 

Assistant coach Graham Arnold said the yellow cards were a concern, but would probably not influence the composition of the starting eleven. 

 Asked whether Australia might sit out the players on cautions, he responded: Well, if you ask the players who are on the yellows, theyll want to play against Brazil, wont they? And its a fantastic experience for them to be in that position to play against them. 

Wednesday was a day off for the Socceroos squad. 

Meanwhile, The Netherlands have one unbeaten team and four unbeaten coaches at the World Cup. 

 The quartet ? in charge of the Netherlands, South Korea, Australia and Trinidad and Tobago ? earned three wins and a draw from their opening games. One of them ? Hiddink ? had already taken The Netherlands and South Korea to World Cup semi-finals before taking charge of Australia. 

I think (its) the way he motivates a team, Australia winger Harry Kewell said. The way he gets them up there, the way he prepares, the way he gets them going. Organisation. 

The Netherlands is relying on a virtual rookie in Van Basten to lead their team. One of soccers greatest ever forwards with AC Milan and the 1988 European Championship-winning Dutch team. 

The Netherlands captain Edwin van der Sar said Van Bastens lack of experience was a bonus, meaning he approached things differently to many established figures. (AP)

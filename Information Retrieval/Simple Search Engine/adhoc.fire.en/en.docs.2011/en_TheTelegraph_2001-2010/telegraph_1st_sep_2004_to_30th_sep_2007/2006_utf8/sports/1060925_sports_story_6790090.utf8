 - WI to have a week-long camp at the Kinrara Oval ahead of the Champions Trophy

Kuala Lumpur: A couple of poor decisions, one each from Asad Rauf (Chris Gayle, sent back off a no ball) and Mark Benson (Brian Lara, ruled caught behind when the bat made no contact) didnt help, but the West Indies should still have made a fight of the tri-series final Sunday. The Australians won the DLF Cup big by all of 127 runs, but Ricky Ponting acknowledged fine-tuning will be needed as the season gathers momentum. 

We didnt play to the best of our skills and one-day cricket is such that (regular) fine-tuning is required... One has to get used to the tempo... I believe weve got a pretty good structure in place, but players have to keep challenging themselves and improving individually, the World Cup-winning captain pointed out. 

Spearhead Brett Lee, incidentally, bagged a double Man of the Series (12 wickets, including four in the final, in a mere three games) and Man of the Match. The wicket, which had already been used four times, wasnt ideal. However, some may argue theres no point offering featherbeds which dont challenge batsmen. 

While the Australians are heading home in batches, the West Indians are going to stay put in the Malaysian capital for a week-long camp ahead of the Champions Trophy in India. They will be using the facilities at the Kinrara Oval, which houses the Malaysian Cricket Association Academy. 

The following, meanwhile, are excerpts from what the captains as also the MoS and MoM had to say after the rather boring final: 

PONTING: We didnt play our best cricket, but its a good result... Our game plan was to be circumspect at the start and, then, give the later batsmen the freedom to play shots... The wicket wasnt easy as there was no pace at all with the new ball... Simon Katich struggled (he scored his only boundary on the 52nd ball), but laid a good foundation... It was important for Damien Martyn to spend time at the wicket and he did... I think weve been very successful with our experimentation and got a look at guys we otherwise wouldnt have seen... Were pretty close to our best XI, but Matthew Hayden (who isnt in the Champions Trophy 14) is somebody were going to look at... I wouldnt say the West Indies surrendered, at this level, nobody does... They havent been chasing well and things fell in place for us...That we havent won the Champions Trophy is something that keeps cropping up... Weve got time off between now and that tournament and the guys will be working at the club level and with their state teams... Im not concerned about my own form (just one fifty in four matches)... Thats cricket, I guess... Glenn McGrath had very fine figures (once again), but he wont be jumping up and down... He needs more overs... Andrew Symonds is pretty much a complete player and its nice to have versatility in the team... Leaving out Brad Hogg was tough, but only XI can be played... He took it on the chin today, but is going to celebrate like the rest... 

 LARA: 

 Wouldnt agree we surrendered, for wed 

 worked hard in the first session... We just didnt 

 get our act right... Yes, I was disappointed to get out, 

 but wasnt looking at the umpire to call me back (like 

 Sachin Tendulkar)... Finishing second best in a three-team 

 competition, with the others ranked above us, is creditable... 

 I have faith in my players... You cant be playing 

 for the West Indies if you dont have the desire to 

 work hard... Some players have limited skills and, so, well 

 be working with them (in the camp here)... Indeed, some 

 players have to give that extra effort themselves... Weve 

 got to put this tournament behind us and take to the Champions 

 Trophy full of bubble and zest after all, were the 

 defending champions... Weve got to qualify, but I 

 see that as a bit of a plus unlike most teams, were 

 going to have the opportunity of taking to the competition 

 with matches under our belt (in Indian conditions)... 

LEE: I really enjoyed bowling in the tri-series... I was rested in the first two matches and that allowed me to work on my fitness... It was nice to get a wicket (Gayles) off the first ball... Id actually set out to bowl one which would swing back in... 

Footnote: Neither Ponting nor Lara concurred that the West Indies gave in meekly, admittedly on a difficult wicket, but former quick Ian Bishop said as much. Who wouldve thought the West Indies would get only 113? I expected the final to be competitive, he told The Telegraph. He wasnt alone in looking forward to a down-to-the-wire finish.

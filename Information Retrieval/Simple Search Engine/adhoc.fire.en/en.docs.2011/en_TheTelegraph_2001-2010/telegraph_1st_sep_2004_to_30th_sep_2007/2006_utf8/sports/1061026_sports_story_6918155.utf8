 Chowrasia has great attitude: Randhawa

Noida: Senior pros hail him as the next superstar of Indian golf, but Shiv Shankar Prasad Chowrasia is not so confident of nurturing higher amibitions. 

While Jyoti Randhawa is impressed with Chowrasias cool attitude, Rahil Gangjee is bowled over by his solid all-round game. 

He is a great golfer with a great attitude, says Randhawa, who edged past Chowrasia in the second play-off to win the Indian Open on Monday. 

Gangjee goes a step further. He can be the next superstar. He is solid, has a strong putting and can do it on any surface. He is awesome, but laidback. Somebody needs to put that ambition in his head (to play in bigger league like the European Tour), says Gangjee. 

But the humble Chowrasia says he is happy with what he is doing and is in no hurry to seek stardom in the golfing world.

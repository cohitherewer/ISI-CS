 Sourav axed when doing well: Sidhu

Sangrur: Former cricketer Navjyot Singh Sidhu said on Tuesday he regretted that Sourav Ganguly was axed from Indias one-day International squad when the former captain was batting well. 

The cricketer who completed his 10,000 runs in one-day matches and has distinction of winning a number of international matches under his captaincy, was shown the door when he was batting well, the cricketer-turned-politician said in Malerkotla near here. 

Sourav has missed Indias three ODI series in a row against Sri Lanka and South Africa at home last year and against Pakistan, which has just concluded in Pakistan. 

Sidhu, a BJP MP, lauded the present team combination for being disciplined and exhibiting a superb performance against their rivals in Pakistan.

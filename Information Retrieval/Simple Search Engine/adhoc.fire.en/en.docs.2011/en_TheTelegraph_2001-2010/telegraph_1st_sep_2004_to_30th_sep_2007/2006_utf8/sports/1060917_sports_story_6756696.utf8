 Kapur-Ghei misses berth 

Kuala Lumpur: Shiv Kapur and Gaurav Ghei slipped badly on the final day at the Seri Selangor Golf Club here on Saturday and missed out on the World Cup to be held in Barbados in December. 

The Indian pair had a rough time on a day that was tough for scoring. They scored four-over 76 and slipped one spot to tied third with Switzerland. It was Singapore and Italy booked their spots to Barbados. 

Singapores Mardan Mamat and Lam Chih Bing, who led since the second round, scored a one-under-par 70 in the foursomes format and finished on top with a four-day total of 13-under-par 271. It will be their third World Cup appearance together. 

Emanuele Canonica and in-form Francesco Molinari of Italy, who finished even-par in the final round, ended their campaign seven strokes behind the Singaporean duo. 

Unable to get going, the Indians had nothing going for them. Their birdies refused to fall and even their iron play was not good enough. 

The Barbados World Cup will be held at the Sandy Lane Resort from December 7-10. (PTI)

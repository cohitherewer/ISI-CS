 Zaheer banks on Worcester stint

 - Trescothicks double-failure 

London: Zaheer Khan believes that his stint with Worcestershire can help revive his international career. 

I want to win matches here and regain my place in the national side, the 27-year-old said on a radio interview. 

After being overlooked for the home series against England, the Baroda pacer was approached by the County and he readily agreed to replace Australian Nathan Bracken for the season. 

This is the off-season in India, and I dont have international duty. So this is a good opportunity for me to play in England. 

The wickets (in England) will be helpful to seamers, very different from the sub-continent. As a bowler, Ill definitely enjoy these conditions. If I can get good rhythm, stay fit and take lots of wickets, it will help me regain my place in the Indian side, said Zaheer, who has 121 wickets in Test and 155 in ODIs. 

Meanwhile, England opener Marcus Trescothick suffered a miserable return to action when he was dismissed twice in the same day in Somersets County championship match against Gloucestershire in Bristol. 

Trescothick, who returned home early from Englands tour of India, scored 12 in the first innings and 4 in the second as Somerset followed on and suffered an innings defeat. (AGENCIES)

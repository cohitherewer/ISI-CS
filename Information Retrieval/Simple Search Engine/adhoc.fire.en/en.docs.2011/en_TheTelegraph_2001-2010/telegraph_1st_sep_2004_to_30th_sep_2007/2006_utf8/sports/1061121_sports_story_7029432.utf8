 Hair mulls legal action 

Melbourne: Sacked umpire Darrell Hair is considering legal action against the ICC and has hired a leading lawyer from the MCC. 

I am still trying to work a few things out. I can only say that I am extremely disappointed at the decision made by the ICC to remove me from the Elite panel of umpires, Hair was quoted as saying in a newspaper. 

Hair was contracted until March 2008 and it would appear he has a clear case of breach of contract. His last assessment by the ICC umpiring panel rated him as one of the best and most accurate in the world, the report said.

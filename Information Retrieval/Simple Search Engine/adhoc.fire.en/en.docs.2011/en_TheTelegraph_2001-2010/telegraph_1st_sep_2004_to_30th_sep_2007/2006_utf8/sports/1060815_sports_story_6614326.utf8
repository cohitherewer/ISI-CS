 Slippery turf may pose problems for Saudis

 Japan didnt take India for granted when they hosted us earlier this year. Now, Saudi Arabia are not taking us lightly either. They have brought 13 players from the World Cup squad for Thursdays Asian Cup qualifier at the Salt Lake Stadium and, as far as I am concerned, thats good for Indian football. The only way to judge ourselves is by locking horns with the best in Asia on a regular basis.

 The Saudis, having qualified for the World Cup finals as Asian Zone runners-up, didnt quite set Germany on fire. They came from behind to lead Tunisia 2-1 before letting in a late equaliser. Then they were walloped 0-4 by Ukraine and signed off with a 0-1 defeat at the hands of a second-string Spanish side, which had already qualified for the second round.

 Saudia Arabia were hardly a force in Asia during our playing days. But, powered by petro-dollars and fired by a burning ambition, they have developed beyond recognition in the last two-three decades and have been among the continents top five consistently.

 Blessed with footballers of good height and solid physique, it would have been convenient for Saudi coaches to follow the European style.

 But, over the years, they have preferred to adopt the South American (read: Brazilian) gharana, daring to be aggressive by blending fine skills with subtle touches. 

 Not that its been an unqualified success, but that hasnt dissuaded the Saudis from abandoning their first choice and taking a more cautious approach.

 Their preference is clear from the fact that they have had a number of Brazilian coaches down the years, including Marcos Paqueta, the man who was in charge in Germany and here in Calcutta as well.

 There can be no arguments on who will start Thursdays game as the favourites. The relative rankings, the difference in quality all point to a gap between Saudi Arabia and India. I believe the difference between the two teams is no more than two to three goals.

 I also believe that such a gap can be bridged provided the conditions favour the underdogs. India have the home advantage and we are well into the monsoon season. If it rains next two days like it did on Monday, playing at the Salt Lake Stadium wont be a pleasing proposition.

 The four-goal drubbing Ukraine inflicted on Saudi Arabia in Germany two months ago was on a rain-soaked pitch. It was clear from the proceedings that evening the Saudis dont like playing on a slushy surface. Indias best chance of pulling off a surprise result would a damp, slippery pitch. I wish there were more local players in this Indian squad.

 Of course, just slushy and heavy underfoot conditions wont ensure a draw or win for the hosts. They have to do the basics right and not concede a penalty or a free-kick close to the 18-yard box.

 This is Houghtons first big test. One month is too short a time to evaluate a coach, but I think he is experienced enough to have realised what basic things to do and what not to do. 

 For example, he has been quietly doing his work, without talking too much. Thats the right way for someone like him to go about the job and in stark contrast to our previous foreign coach Constantine.

 He handled the Bhaichung issue very maturely. Having done his homework thoroughly, Houghton realised he was the best Indian footballer and was prepared to wait. 

 The coach gave Bhaichung the time he needed and the importance he deserved. Bhaichung, as we all know, can be dangerous inside the box and can make the difference on a slushy turf. I am also looking forward to Alvito having a good day in office. 

 One of the best left-footed ball players since Krishanu Dey, Alvito can spell danger in the Saudi defence in tandem with Bhaichung.

 Before the Bhaichungs and Alvitos 

 can get a chance to have a crack at the Saudi goal, the 

 Indian defence has to keep the visitors forwards at 

 bay. The onus will be on the likes of Deepak Mondal, Manju 

 and Maria to avoid letting in early goals. Only then can 

 Houghton and his team dream of an upset.

 Chinese offer for Zidane 

Beijing: Three-time World Player of the Year Zinedine Zidane has been offered the chance to extend his career in China, according to a report on a Chinese daily website on Sunday. 

The 33-year-old France and Real Madrid midfielder announced last month he would be hanging up his boots for good after the World Cup finals, which start in Germany on June 9. 

Chinese Super League clubs Changchun Yatai and Beijing Guoan, however, are hoping to tempt the Frenchman to postpone his retirement and say they have been in touch with him through agents. 

If the dribbling master could join us, it would be perfect, Liu Yuming, director of Changchun told the paper. 

Meanwhile, Zidane lashed out at fans who scandalously jeered and whistled team-mates including goalkeeper Fabien Barthez during their friendly win over Mexico in Paris. That was Zidanes 100th cap for France. 

Barthez was despised by Parisian fans largely because he plays for the citys bitter rivals Marseille.

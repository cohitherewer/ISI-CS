Hyderabad: B Manoj Kumar and Mohammed Shaibaaz Tumbi, who stunned the cricket fraternity by smashing the Sachin Tendulkar-Vinod Kambli record for highest partnership by putting on 721 runs in a school match, say they had planned to play out the entire 40 overs and score as many runs as possible. 

The openers struck unbeaten triple centuries each in the under-13 inter-school match here Wednesday to wipe out the long-standing record of 664 runs registered by Tendulkar and Kambli in 1987-88 for their school Sharadashram Vidyamandir in Mumbai. 

We thought of playing full 40 overs and scoring runs because first years selection is very important, said Manoj, whose role model is Yuvraj Singh. 

Shaibaaz, who idolises Tendulkar, said, actually we didnt plan this. We just kept on playing. We thought we have to play the full 40 overs. 

Manoj cracked 320 not out off 127 balls studded with 46 fours, while Shaibaazs 324 not out was laced with 67 hits to the fence for St Peters High School at the Gymkhana Ground against St Phillips High School. 

Their baffled opponents folded for 21 in seven overs. 

Manoj and Shaibaaz said their rivals were so tired of fielding that they stopped chasing the ball towards the end. In almost 15 overs, he completed his century and I completed my 120 runs. So they were really tired and were just walking and not running behind the balls, Shaibaaz said. (PTI)

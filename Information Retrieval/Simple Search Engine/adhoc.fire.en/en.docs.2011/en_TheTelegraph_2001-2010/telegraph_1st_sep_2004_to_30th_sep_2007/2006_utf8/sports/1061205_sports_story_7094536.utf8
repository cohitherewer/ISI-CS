 We will miss Bhaichung: Coach Houghton 

 - TIE vs IRAN 

 Surkumar Singh to don the mantle of captaincy 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Doha: For Bhaichung Bhutia, whose international career spanning over 11 years has almost reached its last leg, it was an inglorious exit from his third and final Asian Games. 

On Wednesday, when India take on Iran in their last group league match, the captain would be sitting outside the technical area for being booked twice in the tournament. 

While the mantle of captaincy has now gone to defender Surkumar Singh, Bhaichung said he was disappointed to miss the match. 

At that point in time, we were tied 1-1 and I was going all out for a goal. It happened at the heat of the moment, said Bhutia about his needless foul on the Maldives goalkeeper, which led to his missing the Iran game. 

Surprisingly, coach Bob Houghton did not sound too disturbed by Bhaichungs absence. Yes, we will miss Bhaichung, he answered when asked about the ace strikers double booking. 

Then he paused and said: The team is playing well. We now have some good midfielders. We hope to do well against Iran. 

Bhutia said he was confident that in his absence the rest of the boys would go all out to take full points from Iran. 

I know that Iran are the defending champions, but that wont make any difference. We will give our best. 

In the absence of Bhaichung, JCT striker Sunil Chhetri is likely to pair up with Manjit Singh in the forwardline. In 2006, no Indian forward has scored a goal in an international match. 

Against the Maldives on Sunday, the goals came from defender Surkumar and Subhas Chakraborty, who is a midfielder.

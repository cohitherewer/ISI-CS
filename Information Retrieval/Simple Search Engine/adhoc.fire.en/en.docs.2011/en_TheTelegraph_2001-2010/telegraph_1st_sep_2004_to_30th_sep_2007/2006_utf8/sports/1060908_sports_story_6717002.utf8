Calcutta: Had referee Dilip Ghosh been a bit impartial and Railway FC goalie Rabindra Nath Poddar not made a blunder, it would have been a different story for Mohammedan Sporting before their Sahara CFL Premier Division encounter against East Bengal. However, the black-and-whites logged three points against the Railwaymen via a Mike Okoro strike in the 32nd minute at the Vidyasagar Stadium in Barasat on Thursday. 

The referee denied Railway FC two penalties one in the 55th minute when the ball hit Douglas da Silvas hand inside the box, and the next in the 77th when Debjit Ghosh tripped Biplab Naskar, also inside the danger area. Quite surprisingly, Ghosh, on the second occasion, ordered a free-kick in favour of Mohammedan Sporting after Naskar was tripped illegitimately. 

The black-and-whites got their all-important goal when Mir Farooq Hyder essayed a ball from the left for Okoro inside the box. Okoro received the ball neatly, deceived the goalie and captain Rabindra Nath Poddar by his false turn, and put the ball home through the first post where Poddar was actually standing. Poddars mistake ultimately proved costly for Railway FC, who are at the bottom of the chart and fighting to save relegation. 

Mohammedan Sporting are now leading the chart with 15 points from seven matches, followed by East Bengal on 13 after six outings. Defending champions Mohun Bagan are on 11 points from seven matches.

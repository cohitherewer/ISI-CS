 Sporting whip Army XI 

 - federation Cup 

 Jeremiah scores in 20th second, khabra hits a brace 

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: Sporting Clube de Goa steamrolled Army XI 4-0 to move into the last eight stage of the 28th Peerless Federation Cup at the Salt Lake Stadium on Tuesday. 

Ernest Jeremiah kickstarted the rout with one of the quickest goals of the tournament when the Nigerian provided the finishing touch to the brilliant quickfire four-man move. The match had just rolled onto the 20th second at that time. Harmanjot Singh Khabra added a brace inside the first half and Nicolau Borges the pivot on which Sportings extraordinary domination revolved completed the formalities after the break. 

Such was Sportings authority on the encounter that the final verdict could have easily been 6-0 or 7-0 had Jeremiah (twice at least) or Borges not flirted with some golden opportunities. 

In contrast, Army XIs best chance came in the 58th minute when substitute Raghu Kumar chipped the ball for Vijay Thapa in the clear. But the striker made a mess of it, hitting the ball straight to the goalkeeper Felix DSouza, and, worse, Thirunavakarsu ballooned it over the bar from close on the rebound. The match, however, was as good as over for them. 

Sporting came out a welcome change in their approach to exploring the attacking third in comparison to their previous appearance here (a 0-1 loss to Mohun Bagan in the IFA Shield semi-final on Wednesday). That put the Army XI nowhere near their efficiency of quick countermoves, which felled giants like East Bengal in the Durand Cup. 

Jeremiah signalled the positive outlook in the Goan teams ambitions barely seconds after the kick-off. Following a cross from the right, Borges back-heeled the ball for Jeremiah, whose acceleration completely caught the Army XI backline off-guard. He advanced further and slotted the ball home to the right of the goalkeeper. 

Khabra then took the centrestage with back-to-back goals. In the 31st minute, he tapped in nicely following Borges ill-directed attempt. Seven minutes later, he picked up the pace from behind as Joseph Pereira landed a long ball into the opponents area. The Army defence paid no heed to his run as Jeremiah was in the offside position at that time. But the Nigerian did the right thing standing unmoved as Khabra collected the ball unchallenged and finished with remarkable precision. 

Exactly a week ago, against Mohun Bagan, the typical passing game of Sporting was very much in evidence, but their hesitancy in taking goal-bound shots even from close cost them dear. The Sporting coach Clifford Chukwuma must have learnt from that mistake since the likes of Jeremiah and Borges on Tuesday maintained a good blend of long-range shots and quick exchange of passes as routes for their forays. 

Borges, in fact, produced the gem of a finish, justifying his presence as livewire in the midfield. Having been fed by Jeremiah on the right, he steered clear of S. Rameshs challenge with a defect inside turn and then placed the ball in intelligently over the goalkeepers head with his left foot.

Dudu stays on bench 

There was a surprise presence of Dudu Omagbemi on the Sporting bench during the match. The Nigerian has been suspended for two matches for his on-field altercation with Mohun Bagans Eduardo Coelho (who has already completed his one-game ban) during the IFA Shield match. Dudu, however, didnt play. 

According to an AIFF official, the Dudu-Eduardo incident has been referred to the Asian Football Confederation. Since the national federation is yet to receive anything on the issue, Dudu was included on the 18-member list, a Sporting official added.

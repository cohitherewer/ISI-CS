The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 A footballer who never got his due 

 - Former India captain V. P. Sathyan dies under mysterious circumstances 

 in Chennai 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Sathyan 

 New Delhi: Former India 

 captain V. P. Sathyan, 41, who died under tragic and mysterious 

 circumstances near Chennai on Tuesday was a footballer who 

 perhaps never received his due. 

 While his other teammates in the then crack Kerala 

 team, such as I.M. Vijayan and Jo Paul Ancheri, rose to 

 become glamour boys of Indian football, Sathyan somehow 

 remained the unsung hero. 

But then, no one expected the iron wall of the Indian national team for more than 10 years to fall in such a manner. While the police in Chennai said he was run over by a suburban train while trying to cross the track at Pallavaram around 11 this morning, eyewitnesses were convinced that the once dreaded defender deliberately jumped on to the track to end his life. 

What forced the ever-smiling footballer to take such an extreme step is not yet known, but Tamil Nadu Football Association sources said that there were four suicide notes in his pocket. While two were addressed to his two colleagues in office, one was addressed to a top official of the All India Football Federation. 

The last of the notes was addressed to the media ? a request to treat his death with restrain and a thank you for all that was written about him during his playing days. 

His close friends are still in a state of shock and refuse to believe the whole incident. But there are strong indications that he was preparing himself for the tragic end. 

He left house on Saturday on the pretext of going to Kerala, but never left Chennai for two days. There is a feeling in certain quarters that he was under great financial constraint and was desperately looking for money from different sources. 

No one knows why Sathyan, a well placed bank officer, needed so much money. Some say he required it to solve family problems while others attribute it to his bad habits. 

What actually led the best defender and the national captain of the Nineties to death may never be clear, but Indian football has certainly lost a great figure. 

The only regret is that though he led India for more than five years at a stretch, Sathyan never really received the recognition he should have for his contribution to Indian football. 

All these years, no one really talked and discussed the classic and world-class goal he scored against South Korea in 1986 in Merdeka. A rookie defender then, Sathyan took India to the quarter-finals with a terrific 35-yard shot that had both his teammates and rivals completely stunned. 

Sathyan himself never regretted it, leave alone talking about his achievements. 

 He never made his sorrow public 

 and even his closest friends knew nothing about it. Like 

 his playing days, he chose to fight it out alone.

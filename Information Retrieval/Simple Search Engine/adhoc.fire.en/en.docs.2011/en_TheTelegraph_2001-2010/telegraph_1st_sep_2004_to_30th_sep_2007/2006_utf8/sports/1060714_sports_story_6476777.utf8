The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Total football, Lippi style

 - The bigger the occasion, the taller 

 Cannavaro stood

 Italy are a powerhouse in world 

 football, there cannot be any argument on this issue. They 

 go into every World Cup as serious challengers. Germany 

 2006 was no different. Despite the match-fixing turmoil, 

 I considered them to be among five title-contenders, but 

 to be honest, didnt expect them to go beyond the semi-finals.

 How did Lippi transform a team 

 with several scarcely-heard names into a world-beating outfit? 

 Well, the 58-year-old coach made his players believe in 

 themselves and gave them all the freedom they needed to 

 combine flair with solidity.

 The bedrock of Italys football 

 has been the famous catenaccio. Over the years, their philosophy 

 has been to organise a sound defensive system through which 

 even a fly cant escape, and then hit the opposition 

 with sudden, pacy counters.

 Lippi didnt tamper with 

 the basic Italian structure. Like his predecessors, he put 

 enough emphasis on defence. But, he had the courage to impress 

 on his men that a defensive-minded team can also attack 

 in an organised manner.

 Cannavaro and Lippi

In Lippis modified system, 

 everyone could participate in attack provided he ensured 

 that there was somebody to plug the gap if the need arose. 

 And so we saw Materazzi coming up from the heart of defence 

 to head in the equaliser in the final, left-back Grosso 

 positioning himself at the right-inside position to swing 

 in a left-footer past Lehmann, right-back Zambrotta blasting 

 a right-footer into the Ukrainian net.

 Italy may not have scored too 

 many in the competition, but their 12 goals in seven matches 

 came from 10 players. Thats a telling statistic. That 

 was Lippis triumph. He had just one striker in his 

 line-up, but encouraged five players to move up in support, 

 either from defence or midfield.

 In a way, it reminded me of the 

 famous total football concept Michel introduced 

 for the Dutch team in 1974. Everyone had to be prepared 

 to play all kind of roles.

 Unlike most other coaches, Lippi 

 was a picture of calmness personified on the bench, hardly 

 betraying any emotion. It told me that the man believed 

 in himself and in the ability of his team.

 If I were to pick a fault with 

 Parreira in hindsight, it would be that he didnt give 

 Ronaldinho the freedom, which Lippi allowed the Italians. 

 The Brazilian superstar played forgettable football, but 

 his coach should have asked him to play as a forward.

 Lippi apart, Italys other 

 big star was their captain Cannavaro. He was simply unbeatable 

 in the heart of defence. The bigger the occasion, the taller 

 he stood, as if to make a statement that the absence of 

 Nesta wouldnt make any difference.

 Not the tallest of footballers, 

 Cannavaros best quality is his ability to tackle cleanly. 

 He won most of the aerial duels with tall strikers like 

 Shevchenko and Klose, too. However threatening the rival 

 player may have looked in danger zone, Cannavaro was always 

 there to cope with the situation without conceding a penalty 

 or a free-kick.

 He showed the speed, the agility 

 and the balance to not only excel in defensive work but 

 also move up to help the medios from time to time. With 

 side-backs Zambrotta and Grosso often overlapping, Cannavaro 

 had to cover their areas as well.

 Cannavaro was as much in the limelight 

 as forwards and attacking midfielders. He lost out on the 

 Golden Boot to Zidane by just 35 points. I cant remember 

 the last time a defender coming so close to getting the 

 best players award in a World Cup? Thats how 

 good Cannavaro was.

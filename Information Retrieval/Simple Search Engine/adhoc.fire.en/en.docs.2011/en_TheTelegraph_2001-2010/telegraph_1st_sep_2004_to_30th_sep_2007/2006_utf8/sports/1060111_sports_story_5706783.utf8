Calcutta: Its unknown if Bengal will have to pay dearly for the two dropped chances in the final session on the opening day, but Railways surely could have ended in a sorry state by close. Fighting to save relegation, the defending champions never came out of the shell to end at 191 for five. 

The positive approach was missing and, though, the Railways camp tried to blame negative bowling for their inability, their reasoning held little credence. The hosts will now need all their luck to return with full points from this match. 

If we can restrict Railways in the first session on Wednesday, we will have a lot of options. We wont hurry? We have lot of strokeplayers down the line, captain Deep Dasgupta sounded optimistic. 

Railways failed to make use of winning the toss. Amit Pagnis and Sanjay Bangar were back in the pavilion with only 30 runs on board. 

It was left to Vineet Saxena (65) and S. Khanolkar (35) to give the innings some respectability. 

Ranadeb Bose wasted the new ball and Deep had no option but to bring in Laxmi Ratan Shukla early on. 

It was after five matches that Shukla ? who has recovered from the stress fracture on his left heel ? bowled this season and he certainly gives the team more options. 

I didnt go flat out as I wanted to see how the heel responds. So far there has been no problem? If it holds like this I will gain confidence and can gradually pick up from here, a relieved Shukla, who removed Pagnis, said. 

Ranadeb bowled well only in patches and Shib Shankar Paul had to shoulder the responsibility along with Shukla. Besides claiming two wickets, Paul maintained a very disciplined line and the Railways batsmen were not willing to take any risk. 

Sourashish Lahiri and Shib Sagar Singh were impressive. Singh, though, was to be blamed for missing an easy run out. 

The over-cautiousness of Saxena rubbed off on his teammates. Saxenas innings spanned 286 minutes and 251 balls and included seven boundaries. 

Even a natural strokeplayer like Jai Prakash Yadav made a mess of the circumstances in his endeavour to stay at the wicket. 

The batting may have spoiled Railways hopes this season but this was no way to counter the bowling. The painstakingly slow batting couldnt be blamed on the wicket, which played true.

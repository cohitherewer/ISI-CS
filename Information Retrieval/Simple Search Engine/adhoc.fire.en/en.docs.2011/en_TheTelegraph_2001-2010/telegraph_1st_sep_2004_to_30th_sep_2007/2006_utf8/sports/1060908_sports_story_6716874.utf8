 ICC at a loss to explain Dhoni omission 

 Awards Nominations

 Mahendra Singh Dhoni 

 Mumbai: The International 

 Cricket Council (ICC) on Thursday appeared at a loss to 

 explain the shock omission of dashing Indian wicketkeeper-batsman 

 Mahendra Singh Dhoni from the list of nominated players 

 for the ICC ODI Player of the Year award.

 Trying to justify the glaring 

 goof-up, ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed said the list 

 of nominations contained two other wicketkeeper-batsmen. 

 Sangakkara has scored 1,700 runs last year while Adam 

 Gilchrist has a strike rate of 110 to his credit, 

 Speed said at a media conference when asked about Dhonis 

 case.

 But does the presence of two other 

 keepers prevent the panellists from nominating another 

 wicketkeeper-batsman, specially if he happens to average 

 better than 15 of the 17 players nominated for the award?

 The selection panel has 

 made the nominations. Why Dhoni was not included can best 

 be answered by them, Speed said. Dhoni does 

 not qualify any more for the Emerging Player of the Year 

 award as he has crossed the number of matches (Tests and 

 ODIs) specified.

 Dhoni, who accumulated 1,170 runs 

 from 36 ODIs at an average of 55.71 in the last one year 

 starting August 1, was ignored by the Sunil Gavaskar-led 

 panel which nominated players for various awards to be given 

 away here on October 23. The Jharkhand player also has a 

 superb career strike rate of over 100 per innings.

 Meanwhile, Indian captain Rahul 

 Dravid on Thursday said that he was honoured to be nominated 

 for the ICC awards but its not something he focuses 

 on. I guess its nice to be nominated, 

 Dravid said on being nominated in four categories including 

 the prestigious Sir Garfield Sobers award for the ICC Cricketer 

 of the Year.

 In the end, its probably 

 a reflection of the performances of the year. Yes, there 

 are some great players in the list and nominations... People 

 have really performed well in the current year. Being amongst 

 them is a nice feeling, he said in Bangalore on Thursday. 

 (But) I dont really focus on it. Being nominated 

 or not nominated for awards is not what really excites me 

 or motivates me. 

 Asked if he was surprised that 

 Dhoni was not nominated for any of the awards, he said he 

 was not sure about the criteria. Its a question 

 one should ask Dhoni whether it really matters to him, 

 he added.

 Paes-Bhupathi duel to add spice in dull doubles draw

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Mumbai: Despite two or three late pullouts, the singles field at the inaugural ATP event in Mumbai has been quite impressive: two players from the worlds top-10, one top-20 and one top-25, besides a former Grand Slam winner. The tennis connoisseur shouldnt have any reason to complain. 

The doubles field, though, is nothing to rave about. The top seeds this week were Alexander Peya (world No. 55) and Bjorn Phau (73). They got knocked out by Indians Rohan Bopanna and Mustafa Ghouse in the very first round. 

Sustaining interest in doubles are those redoubtable homegrown champions Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi. 

Paes, fresh from his US Open triumph with Martin Damm, hasnt got his regular partner this week. But his decision to pair up with Aisam Qureshi has given this maiden Indo-Pak joint venture a different dimension. Bhupathi, on the other hand, is playing with Mario Ancic and the Indo-Croat team is hoping to make it two titles in as many meets after having triumphed in Beijing a fortnight ago. 

The draw has pitted Team Paes against Team Bhupathi in the quarter finals. But with the German pair of Denis Gremelmayr and Simon Greul withdrawing from their half, the Paes versus Bhupathi clash has become a virtual semi-final. 

 This will be Paes and Bhupathis 14th ATP doubles 

 clash, with the senior pro holding a 7-6 edge. This year, 

 the score stands at 1-1. Interestingly, this 

 is the first time the two ex-partners will be locking horns 

 on home soil. The attendance at the CCI has been improving 

 with every passing day, but the organisers are banking on 

 this match to attract a full house (the capacity at the 

 makeshift centre court is about 3,500) on Super Saturday.

 Pekerman puts faith in Messi, Riquelme

 Messi has been likened to Maradona 

Buenos Aires: Argentina is hoping teenage forward Lionel Messi can erase the memories of the teams early exit from the last World Cup. 

Argentina is expected to have only six players from the tournament in South Korea and Japan, with 18-year-old Messi the big name alongside Juan Roman Riquelme, Carlos Tevez and Hernan Crespo. 

After being favoured to go far in 2002 and leaving after the first round, Argentina now feels no pressure. Or so coach Jose Pekerman says. 

 We are heading into Germany as just one more national team, without the baggage of being favourites. Thats going to let us start this tournament much more relaxed, Pekerman said. 

Now all the pressure is on them, he added, referring to defending champions Brazil. 

The 56-year-old Pekerman has never led a first-division team and only replaced Marcelo Bielsa as Argentina coach last year. 

He coached Argentinas under-20 team to World Cup titles in 1995, 97 and 2001. Many of those players he coached then are now based in Europe and expected to go to Germany. 

Pekerman will have Villarreal midfielders Riquelme and Juan Pablo Sorin, Valencias Pablo Aimar, Deportivo La Corunas Fabricio Coloccini and Sevillas Javier Saviola to choose from. 

Midfielder Esteban Cambiasso of Inter Milan, and Corinthians Tevez and Javier Mascherano will also play prominent roles. 

Then, of course, there is Messi, who has been likened to Diego Maradona. 

I think Lionel has all the necessary qualities to be the best in the world, Maradona has said. I hope it happens for him because he is a great kid and handles himself really well. 

Pekerman is wary of placing too much pressure on Messi, who should be fit from a thigh injury that could rule him out of FC Barcelonas Champions League final against Arsenal this month. 

The World Cups of Pele, Maradona and (Franz) Beckenbauer dont exist anymore, Pekerman said. 

Kempes, who emerged in Germany in 1974, delivered in 1978; Maradona inspired Argentina to victory in 1986 and Pekerman is now putting his faith in Riquelme and Messi.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 New twist to Mike Okoro episode 

A STAFF REPORTER

 Mike Okoro

Calcutta: The impasse over East Bengals Nigerian striker Mike Okoro took a new turn on Friday, when the club pushed him on the backfoot by revealing that the player owes to them an amount of Rs 3,34,000. 

When the contract was thrashed out in September last, that money was given to Okoro as an advance ? which was part of the original deal and the player had to give it back after the contract got over or in case he wished to leave the club in the middle of the season. 

Showing that part of the contract, a senior club official said that Okoros this talk of not being paid properly didnt hold water. 

Okoro, citing that he is still suffering from viral fever, didnt attend the teams practice session for the third consecutive day, at the Howrah Municipal Stadium on Friday. 

It seems unlikely that the striker would be available for East Bengals Round X match against Mohammedan Sporting in the National Football League (NFL) on Sunday. 

 My team doesnt comprise of one or two players. Football is a team game and it (Okoros unavailability) wont effect my team, coach Philippe de Ridder remarked, while reacting to the issue. 

Meanwhile, East Bengal didnt register Chandan Das, who was being expected to lead the side next season, for the NFL. Goalkeeper Abhra Mondal and defender Surya Bikash Chakraborty were registered to fill the clubs quota of 27 players for the season.

 England fans prefer Tests over ODIs

 - Ashes tickets more in demand than Caribbean carnival

 Rana Naveds variation stands him in good stead in ODIs 

Next years World Cup in the Caribbean is threatening exploitation on a scale not seen in the region since pirates and colonial overlords plundered it hundreds of years ago. Hotels are the main culprits by tripling rates and their barefaced refusal to refund hefty deposits should any plans change. 

A rip-off that scandalous would be reason enough to give the place a wide berth except that cricket lovers appear to have done so already, opting instead to spend their winter wonga on going to the Ashes. 

In fact, travel agents report seven times more interest in the Tests Down Under than the World Cup in the West Indies. 

But is this mismatch simply to do with cost? Or is it the case that people in this country ? at least those with enough disposable income to spend watching England play cricket abroad ? prefer Test matches to the one-day thrash that is worshipped by the fans in Asia, and TV rights holders everywhere else? 

In this country, Test cricket is still seen as the superior form of the game by both the public and the authority who run it. Twenty20 may be making brash inroads, but for the committed supporter, Test matches remain the superior entertainment. 

The preference has existed since the first one-day games were introduced more than 40 years ago, so it isnt just a fad to coincide with Englands present status as the best Test side in the world after Australia. The allegiance would remain in place, you suspect, even if England did win the World Cup, though the chances of that are far slimmer than them retaining the Ashes. 

Not everyone is happy to accept one-day cricket as the poor cousin, though, especially when it comes to Englands recent results, which have been poor. 

In an attempt to rectify the matter, England coach Duncan Fletcher asked to play more one-day Internationals in the hope that the extra exposure would improve standards. So far, any gains have been fleeting, though this may have to do with most games taking place after the Tests, when players are worn out. 

Apart from batsmen such as Marcus Trescothick and Kevin Pietersen, Englands one-day cricket has tended to lack verve and imagination when compared with other countries. 

At least Twenty20 and the new NatWest Pro40 are played when it is warm and pitches are firm, which is not the case for batsmen in the divisional Cheltenham amp; Gloucester matches, which began on April 23. Unsurprisingly, batsmens priorities, while pitches remain juicy and green, is survival, not improvisation. 

It is an important point when considering ways to improve the standards of one-day cricket, which rarely works either as a spectacle or a contest unless sufficient runs are scored. 

Better, perhaps, to pack April and May with championship matches (leaving all one-day cricket for later in the year), so that the bowler-friendly conditions can be countered with a defensive bat and still be called a contest. 

Another way for players to improve their one-day cricket is to watch how the best overseas players do it. 

Sussexs Rana Naved-ul Hasan, who also plays for Pakistan, often varies his bowling action, mixing a double whirl of the arm with a single one. Rana does it to ensure batsmen cannot anticipate when he is going to release the ball. It may create only a millisecond of doubt, but often that can be the difference between a six and out. Watching Darren Lehmann bat is similarly instructive.

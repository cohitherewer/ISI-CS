 Poor beginning by Atwal

Miami: Arjun Atwal carded a miserable five-over 76 in the opening round of the Chrysler Classic Championship, the final full field event on the US PGA Tour. 

Atwal, lying 137th on the money list, needs to finish inside top-125 to make the card for 2007. Right now in 120th place after the first round, he faces a huge task of making the cut for the weekend. 

Atwal with four bogeys and one double and just one birdie had a 76 that placed him tied 120th in the first round standings. He needs to shoot a low score to make the weekend rounds and then climb dramatically to avoid the qualifying school. 

Meanwhile, Daniel Chopra continued with his good run this season as he carded a four-under 67 that placed him tied third and just three off the lead held by Brian Gay, who had a seven-under 64 in the first round. 

Atwal, beginning on the first had a double bogey on third and bogeys on fourth, seventh, 16th and 17th. His only birdie came on the 11th. 

Chopra had birdies on the sixth, seventh, ninth, 11th and 14th and may well have finished better but for the bogey on 18th. The leader in putting averages, he needed just 25 putts, the second best of the day. (PTI)

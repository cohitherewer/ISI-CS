 Ardelis for Stakes 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Astrology pundits predict a good beginning for bookmakers on the New Years Day. But fields in Sundays eight-event card suggest otherwise. Trainers Vijay Singh and Daniel Davids favourites are expected to bring in cheers for the usual big crowd at the RCTC ground. However, the competition is going to be tough and close finishes are on the cards.

 The trophy-studded afternoon card includes two terms races ? the Indian Produce Stakes and the Calcutta Sprinters Trophy ? both over 1,200m sprints. The Produce Stakes, the baby-race, boasts of throwing up future champions and there are at least three youngsters in the seven-horse line-up ? Best Of The Blues, Bright Blossom and Ardelis ? who would be heard of regularly in the coming months. 

 However, it is Ardelis, a debutante, who gets the nod over the rest in view of his superior bloodline and thorough preparations.

 Romantic Fire, who outsmarted rivals in his last start, may do trick again in the Sprinters Trophy. Jockey C.Alford partners both horses from Vijays yard.Read as: Sl. nos, last 4 runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:

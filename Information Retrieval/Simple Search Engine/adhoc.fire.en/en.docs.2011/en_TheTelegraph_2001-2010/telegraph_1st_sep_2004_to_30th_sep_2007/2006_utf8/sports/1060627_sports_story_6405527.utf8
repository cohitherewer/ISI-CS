 Italians were

Ten 

 men triumphed over 11, a traditional power ousted a modern 

 challenger. In the end, the Italians were a tad lucky to 

 progress to the quarter finals, winning a 50-50 penalty 

 decision five seconds before the end of stoppage time. And 

 Totti was not one to waste this chance of resurrecting his 

 fading fortunes.

 If any team deserved some luck 

 in this second-round game, it had to be Italy and not Australia. 

 They lost Materazzi six minutes after half-time and had 

 to play with 10 men for a very long time. And it was a harsh 

 call, in keeping with the standard of refereeing in Germany 

 over the past fortnight.

 The central defender, who was 

 filling in for the injured Nesta, challenged Bresciano inside 

 the box. But it didnt look deliberate and Materazzis 

 outstretched leg hit a fellow-Italian more than the Aussie. 

 As we have seen so many times, the reaction of the victim 

 had influenced the decision.

 The Aussies enjoyed more of the 

 possession but the way the Italians mobilised their defence, 

 Viduka and his mates just couldnt get the ball into 

 the net. On the three or four occasions Hiddinks team 

 did manage to push the Italian defence, Buffon stood tall 

 under the bar. He showed why he is the worlds highest 

 paid goalkeeper.

 The Italians, who had been outwitted 

 by the Hiddink-powered Koreans four years ago, were determined 

 not to bow to another low-ranked rival coached by the Dutchman. 

 It showed in their approach. After missing a slew of opportunities 

 in the first session, the Azzurris changed their game plan 

 quickly after being reduced to 10.

 The first priority was then to 

 deny the aggressive Aussies a goal and then go for broke 

 in the final moments to avoid pushing the match to extra-time. 

 They succeeded, with a bit of luck.

 Left-back Grosso burst into the 

 penalty box, fooled the first defender and tried another 

 inside dodge to open up the goal. As Lucas Neill came in 

 the way, Grosso fell down. It wasnt a deliberate obstruction, 

 but in such a position, the referee often pulls up the defender.

 The Italians should have scored 

 at least twice in the opening 45 minutes. Toni, preferred 

 to Totti in the starting line-up, headed wide after taking 

 up a very good position to meet a Del Piero cross. Minutes 

 later, Toni turned skilfully outside the top box and let 

 go a left-footer which was smartly pushed away by Schwarzer.

 Gilardino came close to scoring 

 twice as well, once he delayed in aiming at goal and then 

 shot wide from very close. Maybe had Totti been there from 

 the start, he would have converted one of those chances.

 Italy are still not looking like 

 potential champions, but they are in a good section of the 

 draw and have a good chance of going through to the last 

 four. 

 Lippi, however, has to address 

 the scoring problem. At this stage of a competition like 

 this, a team can ill-afford to squander so many scoring 

 chances.

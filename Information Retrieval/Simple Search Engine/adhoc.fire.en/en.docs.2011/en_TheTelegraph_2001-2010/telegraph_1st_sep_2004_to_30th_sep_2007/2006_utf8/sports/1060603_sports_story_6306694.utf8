 QUICKSCAN: Group C

 Argentina

 Argentina out to make amends 

Although they have yet to emerge 

 from the shadow cast by the legendary figure of Diego Maradona, 

 Argentina invariably figure among the select band of favourites 

 for the World Cup, a status unaltered by their poor showing 

 at Korea-Japan 2002. The qualifying campaign proved something 

 of a roller-coaster ride for the Argentines and Marcelo 

 Bielsas unexpected resignation threatened to blow 

 them off course. Jose Pekermans appointment steadied 

 the ship, however, and the Albiceleste sealed qualification 

 defeating old foes Brazil in front of a packed house in 

 Buenos Aires. By the time the World Cup starts, two decades 

 will have passed since a Maradona-inspired Argentina tasted 

 glory at Mexico 1986. At Italia 90, they came tantalisingly 

 close to a third title, only to lose the final to West Germany. 

 Four years later, Maradona led 

 his side to USA 94 where they were, once again, widely 

 tipped for success. The legend was ejected from the tournament 

 after failing a drugs test. Alfio Basiles side never 

 recovered from the shock and crashed out in the next round. 

 In 2002, they were unceremoniously dumped out of the competition 

 in the first round. Not content with having the likes of 

 Juan Roman Riquelme, Javier Mascherano and Javier Saviola 

 in their ranks, as well as the experienced Roberto Ayala, 

 Juan Pablo Sorin, Pablo Aimar and Hernan Crespo, the Argentinians 

 have just unearthed another rough diamond ready to make 

 his mark: Lionel Messi, who helped his country win the World 

 Youth Championship in June 2005. Pekerman will surely be 

 looking to the gifted starlet and a strong showing from 

 the rest to avenge that painful exit of four years ago.

 The Netherlands

 Founded: 1889 

 Affiliated: 1904 

 The Oranjes rediscover their 

 ambition 

 After finishing fourth at France 

 98, the Netherlands failed to reach Asias first finals 

 after being thwarted in qualifying group II by Portugal 

 and the Republic of Ireland. It was a devastating blow for 

 a nation rich in football tradition, and a memory the current 

 crop of Oranje stars will be looking to erase at Germany 

 2006. The Dutch teams greatest moments were back in 

 the 1970s. Under coach Rinus Michels, they finished runners-up 

 in the 1974 World Cup as a team boasting the great Johan 

 Cruyff and Johan Neeskens lost 1-2 to the hosts Germany. 

 Four years later in Argentina they made it to the final 

 again, losing out 1-3 to the host country in Buenos Aires 

 to become the first back-to-back runners-up. 

 As reigning European champions, 

 the Netherlands looked set for glory at Italia 90, 

 but despite the presence of international stars such as 

 Ruud Gullit, Ronald Koeman, Frank Rijkaard and Marco van 

 Basten, they came unstuck in the second round against Germany.

 As they prepare for their first 

 World Cup since reaching the last four at France 98, 

 the Dutch can point to some impressive results in qualifying. 

 Former star striker van Basten has rejuvenated the national 

 squad since replacing the experienced Dick Advocaat following 

 the Netherlands semi-final exit at Euro 2004. It has 

 to be said that in international stars of the calibre of 

 Ruud van Nistelrooy, Edwin van der Sar and captain Phillip 

 Cocu, van Basten possessed an almost cast-iron insurance 

 policy. Consequently, he was able to gently introduce a 

 new generation featuring the likes of Dirk Kuyt and Hedwiges 

 Maduro, in addition to using the maturing talents of Arjen 

 Robben, Wesley Sneijder and Rafael van der Vaart.

 Serbia and 

 Montenegro

 Founded: 1919 

 Affiliated: 1919 

 World Cup debut

 Defence is jewel in Serbian 

 crown 

 It is fair to describe Serbia 

 and Montenegro as one of Europes surprise packages. 

 They beat off stiff competition in group VII from Spain, 

 Bosnia and Herzegovina and Belgium, to claim one of the 

 2006 World Cup places reserved for group winners. Serbia 

 and Montenegro were one of eight European teams to remain 

 undefeated throughout the qualifying campaign, winning six 

 of their ten fixtures and drawing the other four. Serbia 

 and Montenegro appeared on the international stage under 

 the banner of Yugoslavia until 2003. The team made the semi-finals 

 at the very first World Cup in 1930, losing to eventual 

 champions Uruguay. They appeared at six further finals, 

 most recently at France 98 where they lost 1-2 to 

 the Netherlands in the last 16. 

 Their star names include Atletico 

 Madrids Kezman, Dejan Stankovic of Inter Milan, and 

 experienced Osasuna hitman Savo Milosevic. However, the 

 real jewel in the crown is Europes best defensive 

 line: they put up the continents meanest performance 

 in their ten qualifying fixtures with just one goal condeded 

 in a 1-1 draw versus Spain in Madrid. Keeper Dragoslav 

 Jevric and a back four marshalled by captain Mladen Krstajic 

 of Schalke take much of the credit. 

 Ivory Coast

 Founded: 1960 

 Affiliated: 1960 

 World Cup debut

 Ivory Coast reach the promised 

 land 

 Like Senegal and China at Korea-Japan 

 and Jamaica before them at France 98, the Elephants 

 of Ivory Coast will be one of the major novelties in Germany, 

 where they will take their bow on footballs greatest 

 stage. Following the draw for the qualifiers, no one held 

 out much hope for the Ivorians, such was the formidable 

 opposition in their group in the form of Cameroon, Egypt, 

 Sudan and Libya. The underdogs nevertheless got off to a 

 flying start, registering four wins and only one defeat 

 in their opening five matches. The Elephants embarked on 

 the second half of the qualifiers as leaders of group III 

 and brushed Benin aside in an emphatic 3-0 home victory. 

 They faltered somewhat in their next match, managing only 

 a 0-0 draw against Libya in Tripoli. Cameroon set out to 

 win their five remaining fixtures and managed to claw back 

 most of the deficit before their head-to-head encounter 

 with the Ivorians in Abidjan. That match was billed as the 

 group final, with Ivory Coast now favourites 

 to emerge victorious. The Indomitable Lions pulled off a 

 3-2 victory and took over top spot with only the final match 

 day to come. Hope had been all but banished until the miracle 

 of Omdurman where Ivory Coast recorded a 3-1 victory 

 away to Sudan, while Cameroon were held to a 1-1 draw by 

 Egypt in Yaounde. The divine qualification, 

 as Ivorians like to call it, was in the bag. 

 When you add the goalscoring talent 

 of Chelseas Didier Drogba (nine goals in qualifying), 

 it is easy to see why the Elephants have been so successful. 

 The strikers winning mentality has rubbed off on his 

 colleagues and he has gradually imposed himself as the undisputed 

 leader of the national side. 

 Guiding this impressive array 

 of talent is French coach Henri Michel, who has already 

 led France, Cameroon and Tunisia to the World Cup finals.

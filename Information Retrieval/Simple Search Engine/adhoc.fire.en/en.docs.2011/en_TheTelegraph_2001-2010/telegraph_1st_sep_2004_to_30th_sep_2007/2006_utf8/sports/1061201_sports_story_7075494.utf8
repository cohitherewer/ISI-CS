The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Souravs last lifeline, says Sambaran 

 - Mental toughness will come to the fore now: Malhotra 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Sourav Gangulys inclusion will mean that the former India captain will have to shoulder a lot of responsibility in the Test series against South Africa. It will also mean baptism by fire. 

The Telegraph spoke to some of the citys leading sportspersons on his comeback. The following are excerpts (alphabetically) from what they felt about his chances and challenges in South Africa: 

 SAMBARAN BANERJEE: 

 This comeback will be a huge challenge for Sourav. With 

 the Indian team in a disjointed state in South Africa, tough 

 times lie ahead of him. The most important aspect will be 

 if he is going to be accepted sportingly in the dressing 

 room. His fitness level is good considering he has been 

 in the thick of action in domestic cricket. 

One or two big scores will put him back on the right path. His past experience on South African wickets will also put him in good stead. This tour will be his last lifeline. 

Jagmohan Dalmiya: The right step in the right direction. Im happy both for Sourav as well as for the Indian team. At last better sense has prevailed (in the BCCI). I hope there will now be a turnaround in the teams fortune. The players confidence at the moment is at a low ebb. I am confident they will pick up with the inclusion of a couple of experienced players. 

 ASHOK MALHOTRA: 

 India needed some experienced player in the 

 middle-order and Im sure Sourav will be able to do 

 justice. I would have been happier had he been picked for 

 the one-dayers as well since his record is the best in South 

 Africa. Still, its never too late. He has been given 

 the tough route to the World cup. It will not be easy but 

 the way he is determined I am sure he will be successful. 

His mental toughness will come to the fore now. He has fought his way back and not run away. This is his biggest virtue. He has been roughing it out in domestic cricket for almost a year now. When others would have chosen to bid goodbye, he took the hard route. Remember, when the going gets tough, the tough gets going and luck always favours the brave. I am sure his attitude, body language and will to excel will pull him through. 

Syed Nayeemuddin: Souravs return is a great news for Indian cricket. I hope with his presence, India will go back to their winnings ways in South Africa and the upcoming Test series will be a different scenario altogether. He has been a great leader. And so, both as a leader as well as an experienced campaigner, he can help in all departments of the game. 

 PRANAB ROY: Good 

 news, but at the same time he must remember that he has 

 to perform. The team is not doing well and the seniors have 

 to take responsibilities now. Everybody will be under pressure, 

 but with the experience he has, Sourav should be able to 

 handle it well. 

The positive thing is that the side wont be short of quality and experienced players for the Test series. You can expect good performance from the boys. If Rahul is fit, then we can have the best combination in place. 

Sourav will need at least 10 days to get used to the conditions, and once he gets used to the bounce of the wickets, it wont be much of a problem for him. Apart from Pollock, there is no one in this South African side who can swing the ball.

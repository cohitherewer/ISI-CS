 Jones coach scoffs at latest allegation

San Jose: Marion Jones coach Steve Riddick scoffed at suggestions that the athlete used banned blood-booster EPO. 

I smell a rat, the Virginia-based coach told a San Jose paper in the wake of widespread press reports that Jones had tested positive for erythropoietin at the US nationals, where she won the 100m. 

Three leading American dailies were among the media citing unnamed sources as saying Jones A sample was positive for EPO, a result that must still be confirmed by the B sample analysis. 

It is virtually impossible for Marion Jones to take EPO and run in the nationals, said Riddick, Jones coach of two years. It just doesnt make any sense to me. 

If the B sample confirms the result, the 30-year-old Jones could face a two-year ban. 

Riddick said Jones, who withdrew from the Zurich Golden League on Friday, had sent him a text message about the reported positive result. He said he then did some research on EPO, which has long been associated with endurance athletes. 

I dont know anything about it, I just coach her, Riddick said. I believe her. I see how hard she works. It would take a dummy to walk into the US nationals the devils house with EPO in your system. No other explanation makes sense. (AFP)

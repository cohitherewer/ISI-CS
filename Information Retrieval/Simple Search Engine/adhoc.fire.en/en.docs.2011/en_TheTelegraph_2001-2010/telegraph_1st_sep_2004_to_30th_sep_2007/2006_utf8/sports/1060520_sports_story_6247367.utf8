 Atwal struggles

Houston: Arjun Atwal continued his struggle with a three-over 73 while Daniel Chopra shot an even par 70 to be tied 48th after the first round of the $6 million Colonial Golf tournament. 

Atwal had two birdies and five bogeys to be 93rd overall and will need a strong finish in Round II to make the weekend rounds. Stewart Cink is in the lead with a first round six-under 64.

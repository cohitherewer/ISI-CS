 AIFF to introduce code of conduct

 - Move independent of PK, Nayeemuddin demand to gag Bhaichung 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: The All India Football Federation (AIFF) will soon introduce a code of conduct for players, coaches, administrators and clubs. The move, however, has nothing to do with the demands made by P.K. Banerjee to gag Bhaichung Bhutia. 

Speaking to The Telegraph on Sunday, AIFF general secretary Alberto Colaco said the new code book could come out in the next one month. 

It has been introduced by Fifa and AFC and they have been pressing us hard to toe their line, he said. The AIFF may follow the guidelines given by the parent body with a few modifications. 

Colaco said he was not aware that Indian team manager PK and coach Syed Nayeemuddin had requested disciplinary action against Bhaichung and demanded that a code of conduct be imposed to restrain footballers from talking against the team management. 

What the AIFF is planning to introduce will be applicable to all connected with the game in some capacity in India. Of late, we have noticed that a lot of people are taking advantage of their position in football and saying a lot of things that is harming the interest of the game. It has to be stopped. 

Pressed to comment on the Nayeemuddin-Bhaichung issue, Colaco said he would discuss such things at the proper forum. 

The AIFF executive committee meeting is fixed for March 8 here. If I have anything to say at all, I will say it there. 

While the AIFF secretary was not ready to comment on it, some members of the federation are believed to be more upset with the attitude of the coach and the manger than skipper Bhutia. 

During the camp in Delhi, manager PK Banerjee constantly criticised the federation publicly over trifle matters, which were solved instantly. It has to be stopped, said an AIFF official. 

In some cases, coach Nayeemuddins behaviour was also disappointing. After coming back from the SAFF football in Pakistan, he even went to the extent of accusing the AIFF secretary of not providing the team with practice balls and deliberately making him travel in a cheaper car. Such things should also come under scanner, the official said.

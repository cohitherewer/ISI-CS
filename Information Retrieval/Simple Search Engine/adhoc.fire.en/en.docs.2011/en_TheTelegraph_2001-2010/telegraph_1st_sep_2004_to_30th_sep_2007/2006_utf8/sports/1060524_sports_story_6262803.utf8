The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Im a collaborative coach, says King

 - Im clear about what needs to be done for West Indies cricket 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Basseterre (St Kitts): The West Indies coach, Bennett King, is amused at the perception that hes the supremo. 

That could be the perception, but I dont see it that way... Im a collaborative coach, one who works with the captain and the rest.... I cant, of course, go around changing perceptions, the 41-year-old Australian told The Telegraph. 

Interacting on Monday, King added: Im clear about what needs to be done for West Indies cricket to move forward and Ive been seeking everybodys help... Its a challenging assignment, no doubt... 

King accepted the offer in late 2004 after having rejected it more than a year before that. Well, yes, Id been put off by the Boards decision to announce my appointment even before finalising terms and conditions... Such things arent done, he said. 

For the record, King succeeded Gus Logie and current Team India coach Greg Chappell had also been approached. Hes a selector, too, and sits with Joey Carew (convenor), Gordon Greenidge and Clyde Butts. 

Look, I dont think being a selector is a big deal... After all, good selectors will always listen to the coach, King maintained. 

Asked if there were bad vibes between Chappell and him, given their exchange of words through the Media in the not too distant past, King laughed: Not from my side, thats for sure... Both of us are mature to see beyond such things... 

A former Queensland coach (he succeeded John Buchanan) and one-time boss at the Commonwealth Bank Academy, King remarked he didnt look up to anybody as a role model. 

Ive definitely admired quite a few coaches from other disciplines... Ive learnt from them, but havent regarded anybody as a role model... Ive also learnt quite a bit from my father, Kevin, who was a headmaster... Values and so on... 

King, of course, has detractors and former wicketkeeper Jeffrey Dujon is one. Indeed, in an interview to us the other day, he went as far as to say: The funny thing about the West Indies is that people dont tend to have faith in their own... The employment of a coach from overseas stems from a colonial mentality... 

The coach himself took a swipe at former cricketers (during a Media conference) the other day when he observed: Ive been open to help from anybody, but really dont know why nobody is coming forward... 

One assumes better results are going to make his (and Brian Laras) life a lot easier.

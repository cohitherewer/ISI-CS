London: Chelsea swept to an impressive 3-1 win over West Ham United but Liverpool stumbled in their pursuit of the Premier League champions with a 2-2 draw at Bolton Wanderers on Monday. 

Victory at Upton Park gave Chelsea an imperious 14-point lead over their nearest rivals Manchester United, who face Arsenal in Highbury in the showcase match on Tuesday. 

Third-placed Liverpool ended their 10-game Premier League winning streak and lost ground with their draw at the Reebok, moving on to 41 points ? a full 17 adrift of Jose Mourinhos Chelsea, albeit with two games in hand. 

Struggling Birmingham City collected three points by beating Wigan Athletic 2-0, Everton notched a second win in three days after seeing off Charlton Athletic 3-1 helped by two Tim Cahill headers and Aston Villa edged West Bromwich Albion 2-1 in the Midlands derby. 

Both sides finished with 10 men as Sunderland lost 2-1 at Fulham while a third derby, in the north east, finished 2-2 as Newcastle United snatched a 90th-minute equaliser against Middlesbrough at St James Park. 

Argentine striker Hernan Crespo scored within seconds of coming on as a substitute and Didier Drogba lashed in the goal of the game as Chelsea romped home in the London derby.

 Germany top; India 11th

Moenchengladbach: Propelled by a brilliant brace from striker Christopher Zeller, a spirited Germany overcame Olympic champions Australia 4-3 to retain the crown in the 11th mens World Cup hockey here on Sunday. 

Trailing 1-3, the Germans lifted themselves to pull off a dramatic win for their second World Cup on-the-trot at the Warsteiner Hockey Park. 

Leading the German charge was flamboyant Zeller, whose two goals (18th, 55th) provided the inspiration, while Mauritz Fuerste (46th) and Bjoern Emmerling (49th) were the other scorers. 

The Australians, after falling a goal in arrears, had their best moments with Mark Knowles (19th), Matthew Naylor (25th) and Troy Elder (39th) giving them a 3-1 lead which was shortlived due to their own complacency. 

A 54th minute goal by Rajpal Singh saw India beat South Africa 1-0 and avoid the ignominy of finishing last in the 11th mens hockey World Cup here Sunday. 

It was Indias only win in seven matches and came against a team they had drawn 1-1 in the league last week. 

The 11th place finish meant that India, No. 6 in the FIH world rankings, earned the right to play in the 2007 Champions Challenge tournament in Boom, Belgium (June 23-July 1), the qualifying tournament for the 2008 Champions Trophy.

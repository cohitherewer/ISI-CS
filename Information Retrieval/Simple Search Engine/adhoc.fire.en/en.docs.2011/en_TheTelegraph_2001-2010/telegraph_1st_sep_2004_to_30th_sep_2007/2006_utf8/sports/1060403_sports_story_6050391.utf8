 Anand joins 2800 club

 ELO Ratings

 New Delhi: Grandmaster 

 Viswanathan Anand achieved his long-cherished dream of figuring 

 in 2800 Elo club as the chess world governing body 

 Fide announced the latest rating list.

 Anand, who was knocking on the 

 2800 door for quite sometime, finally saw it happening at 

 the Corus Super GMs meet, which he won for a record fifth 

 time in January.

 The Indian ace began the event 

 with Elo 2792 points and gained 11 points to breach the 

 landmark but missed the top rank by just one point to remain 

 at 2803.

 The top place was grabbed by World 

 Champion Veselin Topalov, who withstood some real hard time 

 in this years Linares tournament.

 After a real tough start, Topalov 

 clawed back in the tournament with some late onslaught that 

 not only kept him in the 2800 club but pushed him to the 

 top spot with 2804 points in the quarterly list.

 Garri Kasparov, who had announced 

 his retirement from professional chess at the Linares tournament 

 last year while on top of the world rankings but since his 

 inactive period surpassed a year now, the name of Russian 

 wizard was removed from the rating list.

 GM Krishnan Sasikiran was a notable 

 gainer in the list with the Indian, on 2692, clinching back 

 his No.2 position following his fine performances in the 

 Aeroflot International Open.

 P. Harikrishna, on 2680, was the 

 third best Indian.

 Among the women players, Hungarian 

 Judit Polgars supremacy remained uncontested as ever 

 on 2711 Elo points.

 But the honour of topping the 

 womens charts remained with Koneru Humpy, who moved 

 to 2548 in the new list.

Faisalabad: Mahendra Singh Dhoni smashed a lusty unbeaten 116 as the lower order pulled India out of the pits and restored balance in the second Test against Pakistan here on Monday. 

Captain Rahul Dravids gritty 103 was overshadowed as the dashing Dhonis breathtaking array of strokes not only led him to his maiden Test century, but steered his team to a relatively safe position of 441 for five at stumps on Day III. 

The prospects of a follow-on loomed large at one stage when the visitors were left struggling at 281 for five but Dhoni showed no signs of nerves by unleashing a blistering assault on Pakistani bowlers who bowled well in patches. 

The wicket-keeper batsman found an able ally in young Irfan Pathan (49 not out) as the sixth wicket pair put on a record unfinished 160-run partnership, to leave the tourists 147 runs adrift of Pakistans 588 on a placid track at the Iqbal Stadium. 

Resuming at the overnight score of 110 for one, Dravid recorded his 22nd Test century and stitched 197 runs for the second wicket with V.V.S. Laxman (90). But Laxmans dismissal triggered off a middle order collapse as Dravid, Sachin Tendulkar (14) and Yuvraj Singh (4) perished in quick succession to leave the visitors in a spot of bother. 

The 24-year-old wicket-keeper batsman paid scant respect either to the bowlers reputation or the situation as he counter-attacked the fiery Shoaib Akhtar-led rival attack with gusto to race to his century in only 93 balls. His 123-ball essay was embellished with four huge sixes and 14 fours. 

The Indian stumpers knock, that bettered his previous best of 51 not out made in Delhi in the last series against Sri Lanka, guided the tourists out of trouble after a dramatic mid-session collapse reduced India from 236 for one to 281 for five in just 11 overs. 

The day, interspersed with a lot of chatting between the Pakistani players and Indian batsmen, turned out to be the best of the series so far in terms of intensity and sudden change in fortunes. 

Pathan was at the receiving end of most of these taunts as the host team resorted to sledging to give vent to their apparent frustration over their inability to separate the sixth wicket pair.

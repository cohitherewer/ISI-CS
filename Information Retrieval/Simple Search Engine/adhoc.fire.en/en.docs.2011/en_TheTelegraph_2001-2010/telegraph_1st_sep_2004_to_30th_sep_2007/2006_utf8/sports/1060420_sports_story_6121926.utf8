 SA pack off NZ in six overs 

 - Second successive 10-wkt haul for Ntini 

 Dale Steyn, who finished with five wickets, celebrates the dismissal of one of his victims on Wednesday 

Centurion: Makhaya Ntini completed his second successive ten-wicket haul as South Africa beat New Zealand by 128 runs on the fifth and final day of the first Test here on Wednesday. 

Ntini and fellow new ball bowler Dale Steyn captured five wickets each as New Zealand were bowled out for 120. 

It took South Africa just six overs to capture the remaining three wickets after the visitors resumed on 98 for seven. 

Left-hander Daniel Vettori went on the attack, racing to 38 but opening batsman Hamish Marshall, who batted through the teams collapse on the fourth day, added only one to his overnight 24. 

Marshall was dropped at first slip by Boeta Dippenaar off Steyn on 25 but without adding to his score he was out to Ntini, when he edged a lifting ball to Mark Boucher. 

Four balls later, Vettori flashed at Steyn and was caught by Boucher. Steyn then produced a fast, straight ball to bowl last man Chris Martin.

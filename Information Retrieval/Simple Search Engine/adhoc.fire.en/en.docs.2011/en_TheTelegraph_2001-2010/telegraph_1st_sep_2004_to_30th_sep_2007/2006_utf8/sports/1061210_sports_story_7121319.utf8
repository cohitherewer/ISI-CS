 Vaughans return 

Perth: Former captain Michael Vaughan made his long-awaited return to the England side here on Saturday. The 2005 Ashes hero took another step in his comeback when he fielded all day in the tour match against Western Australia (WA) at the WACA, even winding back the clock by taking over the reins of the team for two overs when acting captain Andrew Strauss was off the field. 

Having blown away a few of the cobwebs with two one-day matches for the England Academy, Vaughan returned to the senior side against WA and appeared to move well in the field. 

He will be hoping to improve on his scores of nought and nine for the Academy as he continues his comeback from the knee surgery that has sidelined him from first-class cricket since April. 

Vaughan will almost certainly get his chance with the bat on Sunday, but England fast bowler Sajid Mahmood said it was just great to have the former skipper back in the mix. 

Vaughan hasnt played Test cricket since November last year.

 Sadova gets 2-year ban

Monte Carlo: Olympic discus champion Natalya Sadova was banned for two years by the IAAF for a second doping violation. The 34-year-old Russian tested positive for the methandienone at a meet in Hengelo on May 28. 

The IAAF said on Tuesday that would be ineligible to compete until July 6, 2008. 

Sadova was stripped of her 2001 world title and received a public warning after testing positive for caffeine. She won the gold at the 2004 Athens Olympics. (AP)

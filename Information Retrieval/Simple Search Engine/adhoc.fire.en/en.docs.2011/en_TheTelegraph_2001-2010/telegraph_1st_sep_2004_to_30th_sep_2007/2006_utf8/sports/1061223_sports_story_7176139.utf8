 Gambhir strikes a fluent 79 

 - Two-day Practice Tie

Durban: Gautam Gambhir struck a fluent half-century to make his stake for the opening slot stronger and guide India to a comfortable position on the opening day of the two-day practice game against Kwazulu Natal XI at Crusaders Ground here on Friday. 

Gambhir made an impressive 79 after opener Wasim Jaffer (2) fell cheaply and Virender Sehwag (40) departed after having a decent start. But the game meandered along at a nonsensical pace as the visitors finished the day on 270 for 6. 

The Delhi left-hander retired after giving notice of his form and confidence. He along with captain Rahul Dravid (39), who also retired, put up a useful stand of 126 runs for the third wicket. 

Sourav Ganguly helped himself to an unbeaten 41 but he took 100 balls and over a session to do so, striking four fours and a six. Harbhajan Singh was keeping him company at stumps. 

VVS Laxman (2) missed out on the fun as he edged S. McMillan behind the stumps and Dinesh Karthik (12) too fell in the slip cordon. 

Veteran leg-spinner Anil Kumble had some batting practice as he scored 23 runs and helped the visitors tail wag a bit on the day. 

Both Jaffer and Sehwag fell to catches in the slips as Indias batting woes continued unabated in the series. 

However, Gambhir underlined his utility as he virtually toyed with the second-rate attack of the home team. 

The left-hander bisected the field and made a mincemeat of leg-spinner Pillay whom he clouted for most of the 40 runs conceded in his 10 overs. 

Gambhir produced all shots from the book, driving, cutting and pulling local bowlers to desperation and earning more than a nod of approval from chief selector Dilip Vengsarkar. He batted for 101 balls and smashed eight fours and two sixes. 

Dravid too was in complete control during his knock of 39 runs, made from 77 balls and inclusive of five fours, before allowing others to have some match practice. The second Test starts at Kingsmead on the Boxing Day. 

India lost openers Jaffer and Sehwag for 49 on the board. Jaffer left early for two and must now consider himself very lucky if he makes it to the second Test. 

Sehwag tried to bat with his characteristic freedom and muscled a few hits to the boundary and beyond, despite a very heavy and slow outfield, but his dismissal in the second hour like his partner, caught in first slip, makes him appear under-cooked.

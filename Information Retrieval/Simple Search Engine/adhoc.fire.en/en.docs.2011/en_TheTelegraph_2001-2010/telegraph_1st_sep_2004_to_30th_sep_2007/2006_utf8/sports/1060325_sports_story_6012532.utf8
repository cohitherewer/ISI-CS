 Love III, Furyk top of pack

Ponte Vedra Beach (Florida): Davis Love III again demonstrated his fondness for the TPC at Sawgrass by snatching a share of the lead in the Players Championship first round on Thursday. 

The twice former winner fired seven birdies on a damp, overcast day to join playing partner Jim Furyk on seven-under-par 65, two ahead of the chasing pack. 

I feel like I can contend every week but, when you get to a place like here or Hilton Head where youve done well consistently, it gives you a lot of confidence, said American Love. 

Champion at Sawgrass in 1992 and 2003, Love triumphed at Hilton head five times between 1987 and 2003. 

This is such a big tournament, said the 41-year-old. Youre pointing towards this one and its nice to get off to a good start like I did today. 

The 1997 US PGA champion raced to the turn in four-under 32, sparkling approach play setting up birdies at the second, sixth, eighth and ninth. 

Love then picked up further shots on 11, 12 and 16 to finish level with good friend Furyk in the tournament dubbed the fifth major.

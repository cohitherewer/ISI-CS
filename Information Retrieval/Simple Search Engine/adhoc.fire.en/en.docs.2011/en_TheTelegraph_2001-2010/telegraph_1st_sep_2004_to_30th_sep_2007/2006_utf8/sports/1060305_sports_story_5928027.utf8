Miami: Phil Mickelson birdied two of the last three holes to join defending champion Tiger Woods, Scott Verplank and Colombias Camilo Villegas in a tie for the second-round lead at the Doral Championship on Friday. 

Mickelson, overhauled by Woods in a gripping last-day duel for the title 12 months ago, shot a six-under-par 66 on a calm morning at Dorals Blue Monster Course. 

That left him on 13-under 131, level with world No. 1 Woods, who mixed six birdies with a bogey for a 67, fellow-American Verplank (65) and PGA Tour rookie Villegas, who birdied his last three holes for a 66. 

American David Toms , winner of the Sony Open in Hawaii in January, fired a blemish-free 66 to share fifth place with compatriots Rich Beem and Mark Wilson, who carded matching 67s. 

Indias Arjun Atwal ensured he didnt miss the cut again with a flawless three-under 69 for an aggregate seven-under. He is in tied 25th place, down from overnight 20th. 

Atwal birdied the first, third and eighth holes but then parred ten in a row for his 69. 

Daniel Chopra brought in a five-under 67 to be in eighth place with an 11-under 133. Tied seventh overnight, the Swede had six birdies and just one bogey on the 13th to be two off the lead. 

Ernie Els improved on his first round 72 with a 65 to vault into contention at seven under. 

Of the other big names, world No. 6 Sergio Garcia returned a second successive 69 to finish at six-under 138, with two-time US Open champion Retief Goosen a shot behind after signing for a 69. 

World No. 2 Vijai Singh bogeyed the last for a 73 but qualified for the last two rounds by finishing right on the cut line of four-under 140. 

Among those missing out were twice winner Steve Elkington of Australia, 2004 European Ryder Cup captain Bernhard Langer, Nick Faldo and world No. 7 Jim Furyk. 

I played well today (Friday) and was able to get by the first 36 (holes) without a bogey, world No. 5 Mickelson said. 

Without the wind, the course doesnt have the normal defence, and we were able to attack and make a lot of birdies. 

Left-hander Mickelson finished in style with birdies on 16, where he pitched to nine feet, and on 17, after his wedge approach ended up just three feet from the flag. 

I was finding myself having to push and push to keep pace with these guys because I could see the lead was going lower and lower, added the 35-year-old Californian, who kick-started his round with an eagle-three at the eighth. 

A stroke clear at the start of the day, 10-time major winner Woods retained his advantage by picking up shots at the 10th, his first hole, the 16th and 18th. 

He also birdied one and two before stumbling with a bogey at the par-three fourth, where he was bunkered off the tee. Despite making another birdie at the fifth, Woods had to settle for a share of the lead. 

I feel like I hit the golf ball well today (Friday), I didnt putt near as well as I did yesterday (Thursday), said Woods, who is hunting his third victory of the year in five starts. 

I had a bunch of looks at some putts and didnt make very good strokes today. Everybody was making a bunch of birdies. I was somehow trying to post six under today. 

Verplank, among the late starters, joined them at the top of the leaderboard after covering the back nine in five-under 31 in the breezier conditions of the afternoon. The big-hitting Villegas, in the final group of the day, also got to 13 under with his three-birdie finish.

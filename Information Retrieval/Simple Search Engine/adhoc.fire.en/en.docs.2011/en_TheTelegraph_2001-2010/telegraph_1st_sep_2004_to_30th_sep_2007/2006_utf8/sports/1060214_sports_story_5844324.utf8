 McGrath doubtful for ODIs

Sydney: Glenn McGrath is unlikely to play for Australia on their one-day tour of South Africa next week but has yet to scrap playing in the following three-Test series, his manager said on Monday. 

The worlds leading Test fast bowler has been excused from playing in the triangular one-day series finals against Sri Lanka to be with his wife Jane, who has had further complications from breast cancer. 

McGrath, 36 last week, is understood to have told chairman of selectors Trevor Hohns that he would be unavailable for the first par of the South African tour. 

McGraths manager Warren Craig said there was little chance that the ace fast bowler will be included in the one-day touring squad later this week. I doubt he would be going, Craig said. 

He might have changed his mind over the weekend, but I think it is doubtful. 

He said McGrath would not make a decision on the Test segment of the South African tour until he needed to. 

McGrath wrote in his newspaper column last week that he did not intend to retire from international cricket just yet. 

Cricket does become a distant consideration at this time, but its still a major part of our lives, he wrote. 

We have been through this before so we know whats in front of us and what we need to do to win the battle. 

Jane McGrath has stared radiotherapy treatment after being re-diagnosed with breast cancer.

Chennai: Spin wizard Muttiah Muralidharan on Sunday said Sri Lanka were keen to avenge last years 1-6 drubbing on Indian soil in the upcoming one-day tri-series in Colombo. 

India outplayed the islanders in the one-day series in September-October last year, and the tri-series would be their first meeting since then. South Africa are also in fray for the August 14 to 29 tournament. 

We have shown our strength by winning the series against England last month. We played extremely well. We are also keen to take revenge against India, Murali said on Sunday after flagging off a heritage car rally here. 

Sri Lanka, rejuvenated by the return of veteran Sanath Jayasuriya, blanked England 5-0 in the recent one-day series. 

We will win the tri-series since we enjoy home conditions. We definitely have an edge over India and South Africa. 

The off-spinner is also looking forward to renewing his on-field rivalry against Sachin Tendulkar. 

Sachin is a great player. He knows how to recover fast from an injury. I hope he is fit to play the tri-series. 

On his chances of breaking Shane Warnes record of highest number of Test wickets, Muralidharan said, ultimately, one who plays more Tests will be the record holder. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Tuesdays 7 events added to Wednesday card 

 OUR TURF CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta: The RCTC stewards experiment with the double-day race-programme fell flat on its face. They were not only forced to postpone Tuesdays seven races by a day, they also had to declare four of Wednesdays seven events void ? owing to paucity of entries. The two-day programme has now been combined. More such cancellation are expected before the season ends.

 Nevertheless, there will be 10 events in Wednesdays card with a total strength of 60 runners. The first race will start at 12.25 pm.

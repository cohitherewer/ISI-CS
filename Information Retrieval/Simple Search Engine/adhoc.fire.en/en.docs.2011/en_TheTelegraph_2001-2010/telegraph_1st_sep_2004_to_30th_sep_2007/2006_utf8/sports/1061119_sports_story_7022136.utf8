 All eyes on Barreto

 - DURAND CUP 

 Brazilian begins season today 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Barreto 

New Delhi : The last time his magical skills were seen at the Ambedkar Stadium was in 2000. For 10 days then, Jose Ramirez Barreto mesmerised the crowd to win the Durand Cup for Mohun Bagan. 

A lot of water has flown through the Yamuna since then. The spectators participation in the century old Durand Cup has become poorer, Barretos career has gone through quite a few ups and downs. Since the memorable Durand final in 2000, when the Brazilian inspired a great Mohun Bagan comeback in the last 10 minutes to beat Mahindra United 2-1, Barreto had played only two matches here. Both his appearances were highly forgettable affairs. 

On Sunday, when Mohun Bagan take on Sporting Clube de Goa in the quarter final league match, it could be the beginning of a new innings for both Barreto and the Durand Cup. While Barreto will play his first match for Mohun Bagan this season after a long injury lay-off, Durand organisers would hope the crowd to be back in stands, which has remained elusive so far. 

No wonder, the Mohun Bagan practice session on Saturday at the Race Course ground centred on their Brazilian star. While the curious onlookers watched every movement of Barreto, the coach Biswajit Bhattacharya planned his strategies keeping Barreto at the centre of his game plan. 

Bhattacharya hinted that Dipendu Biswas could start with Barreto in the striking zone though he has both Guy Ndem Herve and Ayan Chowdhury in mind. Barreto himself said that he would like to be used more as a striker than a withdrawn forward. I am fit and raring to go and would play in any position the coach would like me to be. But my personal preference is to play as a striker. 

Bhattacharyas Sporting club counterpart, Clifford Chukuwama is, however, confident that his team would finally be able to solve the Barreto magic for once and for all on Sunday. 

Last year, in the Federation Cup final, it was Barreto who made all the difference between Mahindra and us at Goa, he admitted. But that was a different time altogether. We are a much more prepared side at the moment, he said. Sporting will field all their three foreigners Dudu Omagbemi, Jeremiah and Bello Rasak on Sunday. 

Chukuwamas confidence comes from the fact that Sporting have just won the Goa Professional League after a four-year wait. We were given the tag of India s best runners-up side after we lost a series of finals in the past two years. May be God wanted it to be like that. The Goa title has now given a new twist to the clubs career, he said confidently.

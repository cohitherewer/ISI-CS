 JSCA files petition against BCCI 

OUR CORRESPONDENT 

Ranchi: Jharkhand State Cricket Association (JSCA) on Friday filed a contempt petition against the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) for allegedly violating orders of the high court. 

The association moved the petition in Jharkhand High Court, claiming that BCCI had taken a decision on JSCAs affiliation contrary to the orders of the court, which had asked the BCCI to maintain status quo. 

The case was taken up by the division bench of Acting Chief Justice M.Y. Eqbal and Justice Permod Kohli in a courtroom filled with advocates and sportspersons, including former Indian cricketer Kirti Azad. 

BCCI advocate and Rajya Sabha member Ravi Shankar Prasad refuted the JSCAs allegation that it had flouted orders of the high court. 

Prasad said the orders had been wrongly interpreted and twisted by JSCA to frame the BCCI in a false case. 

The court, he argued, while hearing the writ filed by JSCA, had merely observed that the BCCI could take any decision regarding affiliation of the Jharkhand association, pending a final order. 

JSCA counsel Jitender Singh contended that the BCCI, having taken its decision of de-recognising the state body, had forbidden the association from participating in the BCCI meetings.

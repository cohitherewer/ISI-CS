 PCB may complain to ICC

 - Poor decisions

Karachi: The PCB is planning to complain to the ICC about some controversial umpiring decisions in the ongoing third Test against England. 

Pakistan believe they were pushed on the backfoot after umpires Billy Doctrove and Darrell Hair turned down some close appeals on the opening day. 

The PCB is planning to write a letter to the ICC complaining about the poor decisions of both umpires that ruined Pakistans chances of bowling out opposition cheaply, a source was quoted as saying in a daily on Monday. 

The report said Pakistan were against Hair standing in Tests and had even requested the ICC not to appoint him for the home series against England. The request was not heeded. 

PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan, who is in Leeds, said the matter would be taken up at the right time. Look I do not want to say anything at this point, when the proper time comes we will do something about it, he said. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 We arent going to rush things: CA chief 

 - I would like to remain in touch with cricket, says Buchanan 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 John Buchanan

 Kuala Lumpur: We 

 arent going to rush things... Weve got time... 

 We do, of course, want to get the best man, 

 is what Cricket Australia (CA) chairman Creag Connor 

 had to say about selecting John Buchanans successor 

 as coach.

 Speaking to The Telegraph 

 on Sunday night, at the Kinrara Oval (after another 

 Australian success), he added: As you know, weve 

 already appointed a committee and a time frame may be announced 

 once the five members have met... I expect the committee 

 to formally call for applications as that would be the best 

 way forward... 

Headed by former captain Mark Tubby Taylor, the other members of the committee are: Allan Border (another one-time captain), CA chief executive James Sutherland, acting chief executive Michael Brown and bio-mechanics expert Darryl Foster, who has worked with Shoaib Akhtar and the Pakistan team. 

Buchanan, who succeeded Geoff Marsh in late 1999, is contracted till the end of the March-April 2007 World Cup. Australia are the reigning champions. In fact, theyve won the last two editions. 

Meanwhile, talking exclusively, Buchanan said: I would like to remain in touch with cricket, perhaps as a mentor-coach... I could even work with the chief executives of major corporations, helping them get the best out of their staff... Thats something Im looking at seriously... 

 Buchanan, who has been giving lectures on management 

 for some years now, will be based in Brisbane.

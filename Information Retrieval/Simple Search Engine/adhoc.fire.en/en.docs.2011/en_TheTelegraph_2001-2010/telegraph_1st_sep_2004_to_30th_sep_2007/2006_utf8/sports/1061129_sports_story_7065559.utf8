 VVS Laxman counts on experience

Hyderabad: VVS Laxman, asked to join the one-day team in South Africa, Tuesday said his experience of playing on wickets with bounce and carry would come handy there. It is a great feeling to be included in the one-day series and I would try to give my best, he said . 

Laxman was recalled to the one-day side after more than a year when Dravid was ruled out of the remaining two matches of the ODI series due to a finger injury. It is sad that Rahul should be injured so badly to miss the rest of the one-dayers, he said. 

When asked if he felt as if he was on trial, Laxman evaded a direct reply. I would only work on the opportunities that come my way. I do not want to think of things that are beyond my control. 

Laxman said he was willing to bat in any position the management deemed fit for him. When pressed for his choice, he said I prefer the middle order. (PTI)

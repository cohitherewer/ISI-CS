 Dola seeks elusive medal

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Doha: Fourteen months ago, Dola Banerjee hit the top at the Lusail Archery Range here when she won an invitation tournament defeating Reena Kumari 107-96 in the final. 

On Saturday, when the Calcutta-born archer starts her campaign in the Asian Games at the same venue, things are going to be much tougher than it was in September last year. With the South Korean and Chinese rivals starting favourites, the Indian archers will really have to pull up socks to win their maiden medal in the event. 

Dola, of course, is unperturbed. Trying to counter the Chinese and Koreans has become part of our life. Wherever we go, be it Olympics, Asian Games or Grand Prix, they are always there as frontrunners, she said. 

Dola, who has won the gold medal in the South Asian Games only a few months ago and is the first Indian girl to qualify for the Olympics, said she would try her best to win the first ever medal for India in the Asian Games. A medal in the Asian Games has always eluded us despite our good showings. Let us see if we can be lucky this time. 

The rain and the windy atmosphere, Dola felt, could be a hindrance towards good archery at the venue. We faced similar atmosphere during the last Asian Games in Busan. Here the last two days have been stormy. Hope things get better during the competition, said Dola. 

What is bugging Dola the most is that she couldnt practise as much in Lusail on arriving here. The practice range at Lusail is a bit smaller than it should be. And the weather also is playing spoilsport, she complained. 

Dola, at the moment, is mainly concentrating on the womens individual qualification round (FITA). 

It is extremely necessary for us to do well in the Fita round. Since the rankings will be determined on its basis, the better we do is good for us. It will help us in playing against weaker opponents, Dola confirmed.

 Pitch to favour seamers: Curator

Mohali: England seamers and Indias new ball bowlers can look forward to a helpful track on the first two days of the second Test starting here on Thursday. 

According to curator Daljit Singh, overnight rain has increased the level of moisture and humidity. 

The weather has suddenly changed. If it rains tonight, we would have to see how much sweating there is on the track, Daljit said on Tuesday. 

Certainly the moisture and humidity levels have increased. And it will help the seamers on the first two days, he added. 

After the first drawn Test, the focus has now shifted to the 22-yard strip in the PCA Stadium. 

It is a result-oriented track. The wicket will last five days and is prepared to produce a result, the curator said. 

If you have good spinners, you can extract turn even on second day here, he added. 

Meanwhile, a truncated match is on the cards with the meteorologists predicting inclement weather ahead of the second Test. 

The Met office said light to moderate rain or thundershowers are likely at a few places in Punjab and Haryana during the next two days.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Hingis likely on September 16

 - WTA CALCUTTA MEET 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Sania Mirza will be a big draw, irrespective of whether her ranking falls further after a disappointing US Open. But the real attraction at the WTA Sunfeast Open, from September 18-24, is going to be five-time Grand Slam champion Martina Hingis. 

Most of the questions at Fridays media briefing centred around the 25-year-old Swiss. She is expected to land in Calcutta on September 16, said tournament director Jaidip Mukerjea, adding that her flight details arent yet available. 

Sania, who went into the years last Grand Slam ranked 54th, is likely to slip about 10 spots when the next list is issued on Monday as she will be dropping points following her second-round exit. Last year, she had made the fourth round. 

That could also hurt the Indians seeding at the Tier III event. She was No. 2 on the direct entry list till a fortnight ago. The seedings will be according to the next Mondays rankings, so she may be No. 3 or 4, depending on the new rankings of others like Karolina Sprem, said Jaidip. 

Canadas Tony Cho will be the tournament supervisor. The WTA will also be sending two chair umpires and two massage therapists. 

Meanwhile, the Netaji Indoor Stadium will be available to the organisers on Sunday night. The courts should be in place by Wednesday, said Jaidip. 

The process of laying out practice courts at the Khudiram Anushilan Kendra has already begun.

 Another scan for Rooney on May 25 

Vale do Lobo: England coach Sven-Goran Eriksson says he will weigh up his tactical options after Wayne Rooney has a scan on his broken foot on May 25. 

After May 25 we will know much better what is going to happen with Wayne Rooney... we have to wait and see how the scan goes, Eriksson told a news conference on Wednesday. 

Ive always been positive but not because of medical reasons, Im positive because I think he will do absolutely everything to try and get fit as soon as possible. 

Wayne Rooney not being in the World Cup ? I dont think even he believes that will be the truth. Of course he should be there. 

Eriksson was reluctant to discuss his chosen option if Rooney is ruled out of the finals. They range from a straight striker replacement in towering Peter Crouch or moving forward a goalscoring midfielder such as Joe Cole or Steven Gerrard. 

Pressed over the Liverpool captains role, Eriksson said: Ive known for many years that Steven Gerrard can play in a lot of positions and one is as a second striker. 

Of course, I hope we play with Wayne Rooney and Michael Owen up front ? thats the best formation we have ? but Steven Gerrard is an option. 

As for Cole, usually deployed in the problem position on Englands left side, Eriksson added: He can make life difficult for people if he plays on the left or as a second striker. Its a very good option.

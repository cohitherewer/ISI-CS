The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 World mark by Aussie quartet

 Melbourne: Tonique Williams-Darling is the Olympic and World champion and was a good bet to add a Commonwealth Games 400m gold medal to her collection. 

She got a great start, quickly making up the stagger, and was in the ideal position rounding into the last bend until Christine Ohuruogo kicked, flung herself into the straight and flew ahead to win in 50.28 seconds. 

 It was Englands third athletics gold medal on Tuesday and probably their least expected. 

Williams-Darling took silver in 50.76, well outside her personal best of 49.07, and Jamaicas Novlene Williams was third in 51.12. 

Englands other track golds came via decathlete Dean Macey and Lisa Dobriskey in the womens 1,500m. 

Jamaica have four golds in athletics, with Maurice Wignall winning the mens 110 hurdles in 13.26 and Trecia Smith winning the triple jump to complement the 100m wins of Asafa Powell and Sheri-Ann Brooks. 

The Kenyans remained on top in the distance events, with Lucy Kabuu surging past teammate Evelyne Nganga down the last straight in the 10,000. 

Australias all-powerful womens swim team finished with a medley relay world record and the much-maligned mens team ? missing stars Ian Thorpe and Grant Hackett ? snapped its drought in regulation finals by winning the medley relay, the last event on the programme. 

Jessicah Schipper (three golds) won the 200m butterfly, then swam the third leg as she combined with Leisel Jones (four golds), Libby Lenton (five golds) and Sophie Edington (three golds) to win the relay in 3:56.30. 

Jones was the only survivor of the Australian team that set the previous mark of 3:57.32 at the Athens Olympics. Jones lowered her 200 breaststroke world mark on Monday evening. 

While the women won 16 of the 21 womens gold medals, the local men gained only one win in the 19 world-championship disciplines. 

Michael Brown broke Canadas eight-year gold medal drought in major swimming competitions, overhauling Jim Piper in the final length to win the 200 breaststroke in a Games record of 2:12.23. 

David Davies won Wales first swimming gold with a sub-15 minute 1,500. He was the first non-Australian winner over the distance in three decades. 

South Africas Roland Schoeman won the mens 50 freestyle in 22.03 to edge out Canadas Brent Hayden. 

The Canadians also won three golds in gymnastics to go with Browns in the pool for their best day so far of the Games.

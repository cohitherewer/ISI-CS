 Pak beat India again

Chandigarh: Indias gamble to field young players backfired on them as Pakistan exploited chinks in the defence to trounce the hosts 3-1 and take a 2-0 lead in the six-match hockey series here on Saturday. 

After the 1-2 defeat in the opening tie, the Indians again cut a sorry figure as they were thoroughly outplayed by a more experienced Pakistan side, although the match seldom rose to great heights. 

The dashing Rehan Butt struck two goals in the 41st and 68th minute while Tariq Aziz (60th) chipped in with another one. (PTI)

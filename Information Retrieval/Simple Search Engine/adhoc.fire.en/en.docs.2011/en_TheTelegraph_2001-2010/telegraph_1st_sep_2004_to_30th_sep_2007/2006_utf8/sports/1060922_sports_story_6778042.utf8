 Australias lead narrows

Dubai: Australias lead at the top of the ICC ODI championship table stands at its smallest margin in almost four years and the gap may further reduce if third-placed India beat them on Friday. 

If India wins in Ku-ala Lumpur, it will not only cut Australias lead but also close in the gap with South Africa to 10 rating points as against current distance of 12 points. 

Mahendra Singh Dhoni is the only Indian among the top-10 batsmen at sixth. Among bowlers, Harbhajan Singh is ninth. (PTI)

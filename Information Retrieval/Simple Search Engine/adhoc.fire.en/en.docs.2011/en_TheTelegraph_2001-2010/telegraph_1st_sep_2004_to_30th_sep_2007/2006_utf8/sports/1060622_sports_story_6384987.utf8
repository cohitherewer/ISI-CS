Nuremberg: The stakes will be high on Thursday, when Ghana and the United States face each other for the first time, both trying to advance to the World Cups second round. 

 Ghana, who lost to the Czech Republic 0-2 and beat Italy by the same score, will go to the second round with a victory, and could possibly go through with a draw. The United States needs a victory and most likely an Italian win over the Czechs. 

The Americans opened with a 0-3 defeat against the Czechs, then forged a 1-1 draw with the Azzurri. 

 Its pretty clear to us what we need to do, US manager Bruce Arena said. Ghana on the other hand may say that a point gets us through. But for us, its pretty clear, so its a lot easier to prepare and get the mentality right. 

Arena said he would also tell his players to go all-out for a win and to ignore news from the Italy-Czech Republic match in Hamburg. 

What do I do? said Arena. Call in the goalscoring machine? Its not my business to deal with that game. All we ever wanted was to have a chance in game three. 

Ghana coach Ratomir Dujkovics main task has been to banish dreams of a possible second-round clash with Brazil. 

Instead, he wants his team to concentrate on an all-out battle between two strong and attacking sides who retain a chance of advancing to the knockout stage. 

We wont play for a draw, he said. We dont want to rely on the results from the Czechs and Italians. 

Ghana have spoken of the prospect of playing the five-time champions in the last 16. 

We are not afraid to meet the Brazilians, said midfielder Michael Essien. But first we need to deal with the United States, then we will see who our next opponents are. 

Landon Donovan, who has met Essien once before, at the 1999 Under-17 World Championship, said: Essien is dynamic. Hes kind of the modern, two-way midfielder. He scores goals, hes very tough defensively and he covers a lot of ground. 

They play good football and they will be tough, Essien said of the Americans. 

Ghana have a powerful team whose surging, adventurous football has captivated German audiences. But the Americans showed in their rugged 1-1 draw with Italy, when three men were sent off, they have immense determination. 

Dujkovic said: We have won only one match and I should calm our players down and warn them not to be too excited. 

Ghana are without striker Asamoah Gyan and midfielder Sulley Muntari. The US are minus Pablo Mastroeni and Eddie Pope, sent off against Italy.

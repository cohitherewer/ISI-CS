 Derek Kentucky Derby favourite 

 New York: Santa Anita Derby winner Brother Derek drew the 18 post for Saturdays Kentucky Derby and was installed as the 3-1 morning line favourite. A full 20-horse field is set to run at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Ky., with unbeaten Barbaro bolting from the number eight post and Lawyer Ron from the 17th,both at early 4-1 odds. 

 Brother Derek trainer Dan Hendricks, saddling his first horse for the Kentucky Derby, said he did not mind starting out wide and avoiding the early dash for the rail. We want to be out where its a little clear, Hendricks told a TV channel after the draw was made on Wed-nesday. Brother Derek jockey Alex Solis finished second in the Derby three out of last four years with Captain Bodgit in 1997, Victory Gallop in 1998 and Aptitude in 2000. 

 Lawyer Ron has seven victories in 14 career starts and is riding a six-race winning streak. Hopefully, he can outrun some of the horses on the inside, duck down, save some ground, his trainer Bob Holthus said. Its not a real good post but I didnt want to be really down on the inside either. The 71-year-old Hall of Fame trainer will have John McKee in the saddle as he searches for his first Derby victory in his fifth start in the Run for the Roses.

 Kerala, Maharashtra register wins

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Gurgaon: National team star NP Pradeep struck twice to steer Kerala to an impressive 3-1 victory over Tamil Nadu in the Group B quarter final league match of the Santosh Trophy at the Devi Lal Sports Complex here on Sunday. Levelled 1-1 at the half time, Kerala dished out some inspired football in the second half to leave their opponents stranded. 

Pradeeps second goal, which was Keralas third, was the best goal of the day. He collected the ball midway through the Tamil Nadu half, dribbled past at least three defenders and then unleashed a low angular shot that beat Tamil Nadus former India goalkeeper Satish Kumar hands down. 

In another match, Maharashtra defeated Karnataka 3-0, with goals from Abhishek Yadav, Adil Ansari and Paresh Sivalkar. All the goals were scored in second half. The lemon-break was extended by half-an-hour owing to power failure. 

For the first time in the tournament, the Devi Lal Sports Complex wore a festive look. Kerala fans came to the ground in numbers, carrying flags and drums and were a highly vocal lot throughout the encounter. It was good to find them not going home disappointed. 

Abdul Naushad put Kerala ahead in the 18th minute when he made most of a melee. Tamil Nadu organised them well for some period in the first half and found the equaliser in the 25th minute. Kulothungan neatly headed in the ball off a cross by Jestus Anthony. Pradeep put Kerala ahead again 10 minutes after the start of the second half. 

The day ended on a sour note for Kerala as the players found their personal belongings including watches, wallets and mobile phones missing after returning to the dressing room at the end of the match. A complaint has been lodged with the Match Commissioner.

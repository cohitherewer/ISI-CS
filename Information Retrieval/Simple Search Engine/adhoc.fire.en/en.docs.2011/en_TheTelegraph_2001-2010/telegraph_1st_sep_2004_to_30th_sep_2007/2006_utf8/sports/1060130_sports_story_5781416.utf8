The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Pathan caught us napping: Hanif 

 - Every wicket must be sporting, says Pakistan icon 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Hanif Mohammed 

 Karachi: The iconic Hanif Mohammed had high 

 praise for Irfan Pathan, but felt the National Stadium wicket 

 ought not to have been loaded in favour of the new ball 

 bowlers.

 I didnt defend the 

 flat tracks offered for the first two Tests (Lahore, Faisalabad) 

 and Im not going to support the green-top here... 

 The advantage ? from batsmen to bowlers ? shouldnt 

 swing so dramatically, the former Pakistan captain 

 told The Telegraph. 

Speaking during the opening days tea break, Hanif added: Just like the wickets in Lahore and Faisalabad needed to have life, the National Stadium needed much less grass. The contest ought to be even, not lop-sided, and every wicket must be sporting... 

[By stumps, of course, 14 wickets had fallen.] 

According to Hanif, nobody can judge the swing in a few deliveries and Pathan was brilliant: The ball which got Mohammed Yousuf was out of this world... Pathan caught us napping... The dressing room wasnt ready ? mentally and otherwise ? for the challenge. 

Hanif also praised Kamran Akram for the innings of his life. He said: At times, a hundred is worth a double... His 113 is actually worth 226... Clearly, nobody is going to disagree.

 Kamksy holds Anand 

Sofia: Viswanathan Anand was held to a draw by tournament leader Gata Kamsky of the United States in the eighth round of the Mtel Masters Chess here on Friday. 

The peace result did not help Anands cause to catch up with Kamksy as the Russia born American kept the Indian ace at a full point distance after the truce was signed. 

In other games of the day, former Russian champion Peter Svidler was also held to a draw by Etienne Bacrot of France. In the clash of world champions reigning world No. 1 Veselin Topalov of Bulgaria came out triumphant against former champion Ruslan Ponomariov of Ukraine in the last game. 

With just two rounds remaining in the category-20 tournament Kamksy took his tally to an enviable 5.5 points and mostly two draws in the last two rounds should ensure a maiden victory after his comeback to competitive chess. 

Topalov, who shocked Anand in the earlier round, joined the Indian on the second spot on 4.5 points after a fine victory over Ponomariov who slipped to the last spot yet again with 2.5 points in his bag.

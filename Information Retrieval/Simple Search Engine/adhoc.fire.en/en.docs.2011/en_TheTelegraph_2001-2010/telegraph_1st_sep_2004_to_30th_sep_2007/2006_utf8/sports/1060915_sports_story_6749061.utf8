 Souravs bowling will be handy: Sunny

New Delhi: Batting great Sunil Gavaskar had some words of encouragement for former Indian captain Sourav Ganguly, desperate to claw his way back into the national squad. His bowling will be handy on Caribbean wickets, Gavaskar said in a television programme. 

Gavaskar, however, also supported coach Greg Chappells plans to experiment with the batting order in the tri-series in Kuala Lumpur but believes all experimentation should be put on the back burner by the end of the series with South Africa. 

Gavaskar said the nucleus of the Indian team had still not been formed and a number of positions were up for grabs. 

The opening slot, the No. 6 and 7 positions in batting, the spinners and even the quick bowlers, these positions are still not fixed, Gavaskar said. 

India are slated to tour South Africa in November-December while the World Cup will be held in the West Indies from March 13 next year.

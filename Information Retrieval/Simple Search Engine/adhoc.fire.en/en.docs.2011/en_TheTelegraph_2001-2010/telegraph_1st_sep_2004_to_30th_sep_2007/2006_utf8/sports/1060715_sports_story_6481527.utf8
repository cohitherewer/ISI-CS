 Sachin fitness test on Wednesday

Vadodara: Sachin Tendulkar will undergo a fitness test on Wednesday, a day before the Indian squad for the tri-series in Sri Lanka is to be named. 

The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) secretary Niranjan Shah said the BCCI had been updated on Sachins fitness by physio John Gloster who would be co-ordinating with the Mumbai batsman on a daily basis. 

Sachin will undergo the test on the eve of the selection committee meeting on July 19, Shah said. 

The decision puts to rest speculation that Sachin would be allowed more time to regain match fitness since the tri-series, also involving South Africa, is slated to begin on August 14. 

Sachin tested himself in match situations while playing for celebrity club Lashings in the UK recently, but as per BCCI guidelines for injured players. (PTI)

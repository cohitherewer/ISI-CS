The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 The ICC president must be neutral, says BCCI

 - Asias joint effort to host 2011 world cup 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Calcutta: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), which is spearheading Asias effort to host the 2011 World Cup, is upset with International Cricket Council (ICC) president Ehsan Mani for his comments in Karachi. 

Mani, whose roots are in Pakistan, was quoted as saying that the late submission of the compliance book/manual had weakened Asia in its face-off with Australia-New Zealand. 

As theres no financial component, technically, its not a bid. 

We dont expect Mani to favour Asia, but we dont expect him to hurt our chances either, somebody very influential in the BCCI told The Telegraph. 

Speaking on Wednesday, the gentleman added: Mani is going to chair the April 30 meeting (of the Executive Board, in Dubai) to decide on the hosts? He must be neutral. 

Indeed, if the president had to take a negative line yesterday (while the evaluation is underway), then the ICC shouldnt have allowed Asia an extension for sending the compliance report? 

The BCCIs displeasure, one understands, is likely to be conveyed to Mani on Thursday when he interacts with key officials in New Delhi. 

The signing of the host nation agreement, between the BCCI and the ICC, plus the formal launch of the 2006 Champions Trophy is slated for the afternoon. 

As reported in these columns on April 7, Asias Big Four sought an extension (for submitting the compliance book/manual) as the first effort, according to top sources, was messy. 

The ICC agreed, but only after engaging in arm-twisting on the Twenty20 front ? a format which hadnt quite enthused the BCCI. 

The extension, though, didnt amuse Australia and New Zealand. Their compliance report, after all, had been excellent and included covering letters from the respective Prime Ministers. 

Meanwhile, one learns the Asian nations wont withdraw even if the Executive Board gives an undertaking that the 2015 edition will be awarded to the region. 

As of now, unless theres some give-and-take, an impasse cant be ruled out on Sunday. 

The World Cup has already come to Asia twice ? 1987 and 1996 ? while Australia and New Zealand were joint hosts in 1992.

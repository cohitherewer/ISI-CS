 Zimbabwe strike threat

Harare: Zimbabwes cricketers say they will not go to the West Indies in May unless their contracts are agreed upon, they are paid match fees going back to August last year, and if chairman Peter Chingoka remains in office. 

Andy Blignaut said: We do not wish to damage the ICC tours programme, nor make things difficult for West Indies. But we have no option.

 Indian hopes rest on Pinki 

 - World cup athletics 

 Pinki 

Athens: Ace middle distance runner Pinki Pramanik would be the star Indian performer on show when the two-day World Cup Athletics gets underway here on Saturday. 

The Bengal girl would be representing Asia in the 800m at the elite event contested on a continental basis. 

Meanwhile, Marion Jones pulled out of the World Cup Athletics and wont race again this season. The five-time Olympic medallist said her conditioning wasnt good enough for her to compete at a high level after missing more than a month of competition following her positive test for the banned substance EPO. 

I was in top condition when my season was interrupted more than three weeks ago by the leak of my positive A sample, Jones said in a statement released by attorney Rich Nichols on Thursday. 

Jones also withdrew from what was to have been her season-ending meet in Shanghai. 

Pinki has been in splendid form this season, winning five gold medals at the Asian GP circuit in May before doing the 400m-800m double at the recent SAF Games. But she will be up against some tough competition. 

Manjeet Kaur will fly the Indian flag in the 400m. Manjeets personal best is 51.05, while this season she has managed 52.04. 

The quartet of Manjeet, Pinki, Sathi Geetha and Chitra Soman are part of the 4x400m relay as well, but they are not expected to threaten the medal positions . 

Navpreet Singh is the only male Indian representative at the event but the shot putter has not been in the best of form lately. (PTI)

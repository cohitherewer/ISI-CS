 Hayden hopes Sourav makes a comeback

 - Ponting will break Sachins records 

Kochi: Matthew Hayden hopes Sourav Ganguly will be back in the Indian team. The Aussie opener voiced his support for the former India captain during a private visit here. 

Hayden also expressed confidence that Sachin Tendulkar, who is recuperating from a surgery, will make a strong return. 

Hayden lauded the current Indian team. 

The team has several talented young players and has been doing well under the guidance of coach Greg Chappell and captain Rahul Dravid, who has performed well as Gangulys successor, said Hayden, who does not figure in the current Aussie ODI squad. 

The left-hander is of the opinion that Ricky Ponting will break all Test batting records held by Sachin in the near future. 

Hayden added that Ponting was a phenomenal figure and an amazing, exceptional captain. 

Asked to name his favourites for next years World Cup in the West Indies, Hayden said that apart from Australia, England stood a good chance.

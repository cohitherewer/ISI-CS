 Hingis sets up date with Sharapova 

Tokyo: Martina Hingis crushed Russias Maria Kirilenko 6-2, 6-1 at the Pan Pacific Open on Friday to set up a semi-final clash with top seed Maria Sharapova. 

Defending champion Sharapova, who was just 15 when injury forced Hingis into early retirement in 2002, thrashed Australias Samantha Stosur 6-1, 6-4 in the days first quarter final. 

Hingis returned to the game last month, reaching the Australian Open quarter finals and secured a second semi-final spot in four tournaments on her comeback by blitzing Kirilenko. 

Ive got nothing to lose, said Hingis, who won the Pan Pacific Open in 1997, 1999, 2000 and 2002, and received a wild card to play in Tokyo this week. 

I always said when I came back I wanted to play Sharapova and that day has come. If I play as well as I did today I think I definitely have a chance. 

Former world No. 1 Hingis was unranked three weeks ago but rose to 117th after her strong run in Melbourne. 

The Swiss Miss demonstrated why she won five Grand Slam singles titles between 1997 and 1999 with superb shot-making and clever angles. 

The 25-year-old Hingis sealed the first set after chasing down a Kirilenko volley to whip a backhand down the line and she quickly seized control of the second. 

Former Wimbledon champion Sharapova was never seriously threatened by Stosur and the world No. 4 promised to attack Hingis in their semi-final. 

Obviously, Ive never played her before so Im really excited, said the 18-year-old Sharapova, who briefly held the top ranking last year. 

Ill try to attack her serve because I think thats one of her weaknesses. She reads the game so well so Ill try not to give her the time she needs.

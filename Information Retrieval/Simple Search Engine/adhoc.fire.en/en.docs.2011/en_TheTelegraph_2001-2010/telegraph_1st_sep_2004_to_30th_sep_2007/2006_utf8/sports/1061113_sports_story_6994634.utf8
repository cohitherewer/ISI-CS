Shanghai: Jyoti Randhawa failed to find the touch that made him one of the leading contenders over the first three days at the HSBC Champions golf tournament to finish a disappointing tied ninth in the star-studded event. 

With a one-over par 73 in the fourth and final round, the Indian ace slipped from overnight third while South Koreas Yang Young-eun (69) cruised to a brilliant two-shot win despite two bogeys in the last three holes. 

Yang (69) totalled 14-under 274, while holding off the challenge of three of the worlds finest players world No.1 tiger woods, South Africas Retief Goosen, New Zealands Michael Campbell and the rest of the high-class field. 

Randhawas ninth place was the only top-10 for India, who at one stage had three in the zone. 

Jeev Milkha Singh also had an error-riddled 73 that saw him finish 17th after being eighth overnight. Shiv Kapur had three each of birdies and bogeys and ended tied 18th, while Gaurav Ghei, began and ended with a double bogey in a roller-coaster round of 74 to finish tied 26th. 

The 34-year-old Yang overhauled overnight leader Goosen mid-way the day and survived a late stumble to eventually score a two-shot triumph over Woods (67) with the South African and Campbell tied for third a further shot back. 

The victory, by far the biggest in the Koreans career, fetched him $833,300 and with it the honour of being crowned the Champion of Champions for 2006. 

Randhawa, who led for first two days, opened with a bogey while his playing partners found safe pars. He dropped a shot on the fourth and when he double bogeyed the sixth and never did find his rhythm after that. 

He parred six holes from the seventh to the 12th and then bogeyed the 13th. Four more pars followed and he finished with a birdie to come to a disappointing seven-under after being 10-under at the midway stage of the tournament. 

Jeev had three bogeys and just one birdie on the front nine for a 38 and then managed three birdies, but also had bogeys on the back nine to finish with a 73 and a total of five-under 283. 

Shiv was two over for the front nine with three bogeys and one birdie but he did manage two birdies without dropping a bogey on back nine in even par 72 that saw him total four-under 284 for tied 18th. 

Ghei started with a double and then birdied the next two. He bogeyed the fifth and had three birdies in a row from the sixth before finding another bogey on the ninth. He had just one par on that front stretch. On the back nine, he found no birdies and had a bogey on the 16th and a double on the 18th, where he went into water. 

Yang himself stumbled when in sight of victory with his only two bogeys of the round coming on the 16th and 17th. However, by then he had already built himself a comfortable cushion that eventually enabled him to triumph with a par on the 18th that he greeted with delight. (PTI)

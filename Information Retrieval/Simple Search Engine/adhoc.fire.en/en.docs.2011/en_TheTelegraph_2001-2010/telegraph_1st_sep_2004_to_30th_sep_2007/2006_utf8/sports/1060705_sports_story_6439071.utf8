 Its a fantastic achievement

 - Anand lauds GM Negi 

 Negi

New Delhi: Viswanathan Anand is impressed by the hard work, attitude and approach of newly-crowned Grandmaster Parimarjan Negi, who he says is relentless in his pursuit for higher glory. 

Anand, the countrys first GM, said it was a fantastic accomplishment on the part of Negi, who is currently the youngest GM in the world at 13 years, four months and 20 days and second youngest in the history of the game after Sergey Karjakin of Ukraine. 

Karjakin achieved the feat at the age of 12 years and seven months. 

It is fantastic. To become the second youngest ever GM is a great accomplishment and that too with six out of nine points is absolutely great, Anand said. 

Negi also matched Anands feat of grabbing all the norms in around six months. 

Anand, the world No. 2, praised Negi for being focussed and hardworking and said that only by constantly playing can ones game be enhanced. 

He is growing fast. He is very active and thats excellent. By constantly playing you can know more about what you are doing is right or wrong. He does not even stop to celebrate his successes and is constantly working. 

He is playing as many tournaments as possible and that is very good for him, he said. 

Negi, who achieved the feat on Saturday at Chelyabinsk Region Super Final GM tournament in Russia, has straightaway headed to Athens to work with English GM Nigel Short and will return home only next month after playing a few more tournaments in Europe. 

The Madrid-based Anand said Negi had allround talent in the game but lacked experience needed for handling crucial situations. 

When you are young, your style changes very fast. But he is fairly allround. 

For instance, in Corus I noticed that sometimes he plays well, but lets opportunities slip away, he said. 

But Anand said he was impressed to see how the young player dealt with his mistakes. 

I am impressed with his attitude and approach towards the game. He looks at his mistakes objectively and that is very good. 

Asked what advise he would like to give to the promising youngster, he said keep working hard. Anand said Negis feat would definitely help India on the international scene. 

It is great for India to have the second youngest ever player under its banner, otherwise it was Ukraine to have the youngest player, he said.

Calcutta: It could have been a different story had Sri Lanka A batted with more grit in the first hour, which is always crucial at the Eden. But they lost three quick wickets in the first 14 overs the scoreboard reading 48 for three. 

It was thanks to Malintha Warnapura (65), Jehan Mubarak (39) and Chamara Silva (84) that they ultimately managed to reach 296 on the opening day of the Duleep Trophy final. 

In reply, North Zone team showed more discipline and finished the day at 51 for no loss. Aakash Chopra looked in control at the fag end of the day with a solid 39 that included eight hits to the fence. 

The other opener, Gautam Gambhir, remained unbeaten on seven. 

Delhi off-spinner Rajesh Sharma was the wrecker-in-chief scalping four wickets. His knack of getting breakthroughs at crucial junctures may take him a long way in his career. 

He extracted considerable help from the wicket in his second spell when he claimed three for 23 in six overs. His first spell of 10 overs went for 62 runs with one wicket Jehan Mubarak. 

Ashish Nehra, who is desperately trying to stage a comeback, only looked a shadow of his own. His 16 overs conceded 87 runs without any success. But his junior colleagues Gagandeep Singh and Joginder Sharma made full use of the opportunities and bowled an impeccable line on a pata wicket that offered negligible help. 

Opting to field, North bowlers did good work in the first session with Gagandeep dismissing Mahela Udawatte in the fourth over. The visitors then lost Michael Vandort, who has the experience of playing six Tests matches. A Joginder delivery nipped back sharply to take away his stumps. 

Malintha Warnapura did all the hard work during his well-crafted 65. Once Warnapura started to look dangerous, Yashpal Singh took a spectacular catch to his left at gully off Gagandeep to dismiss him. Captain Thilan Samaraweera had a brief stay in the middle for six balls before being evicted by Joginder again. 

The visitors were pinning hopes on their captain, who played 39 Tests with five hundreds, but Samraweera never looked comfortable and ended up giving a catch to wicketkeeper Mahesh Rawat for nought. 

Without taking any credit from the North bowlers, the lack of application from the Sri Lanka A batsmen was also to be blamed for their dismissals. 

Chamara looked in great touch hitting 13 boundaries during his 98-ball stay. But another good catch from Yashpal saw Chamara walking back to the pavilion at the team total of 243. Chamara was ably assisted by Jehan Mubarak, who hit 39 with seven fours, and Kaushal Silva (27). 

Akalanka Ganegama was the man who steered the side to above 250. The fast bowler, who has played four one-day Internationals, used his experience to keep the bowlers in check. He hit five fours and cleared the ropes once en route to his 31 off 41 deliveries. 

Now its turn for the home side to make full use of the situation and pile a big score to make the visitors wilt under pressure.

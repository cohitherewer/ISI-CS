 Klose: Argentina were unlucky to draw us

Berlin: Germany striker Miroslav Klose said on Wednesday that Argentina have been unlucky to draw hosts Germany in the World Cup quarter finals. 

Klose, displaying the confidence of a player who has already scored four goals at these finals, recognised Argentina as a top team but said Germany would triumph on Friday in Berlin. 

Were not nervous about this game, Klose told a news conference. Argentina were the favourites to win the World Cup but now theyve had the bad luck to be drawn against us. 

Argentina were made favourites after beating Ivory Coast 2-1 in a high-quality match and then lifting their game to an even higher level in a memorable 6-0 win over Serbia amp; Montenegro. 

They drew 0-0 with The Netherlands to clinch top spot in Group C before beating Mexico 2-1 in extra time in the second round. 

Germany have also scored 10 goals and conceded two but their passage has been even smoother, with four straight victories over Costa Rica, Poland, Ecuador and Sweden. 

We know we have a good opportunity to beat them, Klose said. Theyre a good team but if we press them for the full 90 minutes they will make mistakes. Its then up to us to exploit them. 

Klose scored five at the last World Cup but his all-round play has been even better this time. He scored twice against Costa Rica, got two more against Ecuador and set up both goals for strike partner Lukas Podolski in the commanding 2-0 win over Sweden in the second round. 

Im on top of my game and I want to prove it, the 28-year-old said. I have certain goals at this tournament and Im glad Im reaching them. Im very ambitious. Argentina are a top team at this tournament but its just unlucky for them that they have to play us. 

Germany captain Michael Ballack and striker Klose are suffering from minor injuries, although the coaching staff are confident both players will be fit for Fridays quarter final against Argentina. 

Assistant coach Joachim Loew said on Wednesday that Ballack and Klose did not train with the rest of the team on Tuesday as a precaution because they were nursing slight injuries. Michael Ballack had a slightly swollen ankle and Miroslav Klose had a slight tendinitis in his foot, Loew said. 

Thats why both did individual training on Tuesday. We didnt want to take any risks. They will both return to training on Wednesday, he said. We assume they both will be able to play on Friday. It was just a precautionary measure. 

A senior German official had originally said Ballack and Klose were working out on their own at a separate location on Tuesday due to fitness reasons and regeneration methods without a ball and that it had nothing to do with injury. 

Ballack also missed training on Sunday morning because of a minor injury to his right foot, but coach Juergen Klinsmann said on Monday he had recovered and was perfectly fit. 

Ballack sat out Germanys opening 4-2 win over Costa Rica with a calf injury and since his return they have not conceded a goal in beating Poland 1-0, Ecuador 3-0 and Sweden 2-0.

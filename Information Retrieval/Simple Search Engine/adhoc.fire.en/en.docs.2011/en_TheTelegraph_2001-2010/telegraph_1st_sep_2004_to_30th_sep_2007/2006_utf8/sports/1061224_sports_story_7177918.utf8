The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Its a sad time, says Ponting

Sydney: Tributes flowed in thick and fast as soon as fast bowler Glenn McGrath announced on Saturday his decision to retire after next years World Cup. 

The following are reactions (alphabetically) to the announcement: 

Matthew Hayden: Its a celebration of two wonderful careers. Each has displayed exactly what Australian cricket expects of its athletes. Both (Shane Warne and McGrath) have had an amazing tenacity and longevity in the game. 

Ricky Ponting: Were going to be losing two of the all-time greats in a pretty short period of time. Its sad, but weve now got to push on in the next few weeks. Weve known for a long time that these two werent going to go on forever ... so as much as its a sad time, its an exciting time too because a lot of younger players will get their opportunities. 

Andrew Symonds: Im heartbroken, to be perfectly honest, I dont want either of them to retire. But its going to be a spectacle seeing how people respond to two of our best-ever players leave the game. 

James Sutherland (CA chief executive): They say bowlers win matches they must have been thinking of players like Glenn McGrath when they said that.

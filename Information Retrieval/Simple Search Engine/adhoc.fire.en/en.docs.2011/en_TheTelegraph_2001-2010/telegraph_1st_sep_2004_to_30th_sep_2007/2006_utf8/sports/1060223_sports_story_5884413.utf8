 PCB concerned over Inzamam fitness

Karachi: The PCB on Wednesday scotched speculation that Inzamam-ul Haqs days as captain were numbered but voiced concern over his fitness. The PCB said although the ad-hoc committee had reposed faith in Inzamams captaincy, it was solely upto him to decide his future and lay emphasis on fitness and form. 

Weve reposed confidence in his captaincy as we feel he has done a good job with the team and the boys rally around him. But his back problem is a cause of concern for us and its entirely up to him how he goes about maintaining his fitness, PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan said. 

Last week, the ad-hoc committee retained Inzamam as captain for the next 11 months despite the ODI series rout against India. 

Shaharyar said Inzamam will have to pay special attention to his fitness if he was going to last till the 2007 World Cup. 

Frankly speaking, we are not worried about the ODI series loss to India, any team can go through a rough patch... But his fitness is an issue and he himself realises it, the PCB chief was quoted as saying in a local newspaper on Wednesday. 

We have reposed faith in him and its now his call how he repays this confidence. He has already told us hell be working hard on his fitness before the Sri Lanka tour and get back into top shape, he said. (PTI)

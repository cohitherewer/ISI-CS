Johannesburg: Having predicted (in his column) that Team India should wrap it up by lunch or later, on Monday, Sunil Gavaskar paced a trifle anxiously when Ashwell Prince and Shaun Pollock were in a recovery act, somewhat frustrating the Sreesanths. 

I hope thats how this Test ends, the former India captain told The Telegraph as he helped himself to tea. He neednt have worried too much, for Anil Kumble induced Pollock to play across the line one more time and that proved fatal. Thereafter, it was only a matter of time. 

After the Test, both captains interacted with the Media. Heres what they had to offer: 

 RAHUL DRAVID: Its a special moment for this group... This turnaround (after the ODIs) hasnt surprised me as wed done the same in the West Indies earlier this year... Our win in Potchefstroom laid the platform... It gave us confidence... Ive always maintained this is a team sport... Its the team which does business... Which goes and performs... The experience of Sourav Ganguly and (V.V.S.) Laxman made a difference... It was nice having players whove experienced it (tough conditions) before... Weve got a very good seam attack and I remember saying this in the West Indies as well... Id said there were kids with potential... This was Srees (Sreesanths) sixth Test and VRV (Singh) played his third... The South Africans had the more experienced attack... This morning, I didnt have to tell the boys anything... Its the senior group which kept reminding that we had a job to do (quickly)... We focus on our strengths... We arent big built like some other teams, but that doesnt mean we wont be competitive... We dont have bowlers who can consistently bowl at 150 ks, but weve got bowlers whore disciplined... Sree is quite a character and every team needs one... But he has got to be careful as Match Referees are around! Its obvious that the South Africans will hit back hard, but were going to Durban (on Wednesday) with confidence... 

 GRAEME SMITH: Weve got to take pain from this defeat and be honest in admitting we messed it up... The Indians were more hungry... We got the highest total of the Test in the fourth innings, but that didnt help... We gave away far too many runs in the first innings and the last-wicket partnership (44 between Sourav and VRV) made a difference... We knew Sourav wouldnt be a soft target, for hed made a comeback after ten months and would draw on his experience... Were very disappointed as we let ourselves down... Full credit to India, but I wouldnt say we were complacent... It wasnt the easiest wicket, but Im not offering an excuse... Application and more grafting was called for... Sreesanth bowled in the best areas and swung the ball from a straight line... He has lots of energy, too... That (Dale) Steyn couldnt bowl from late on the first day cost us... Well be meeting early in Durban and the coach (Mickey Arthur) has plans...

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 London: Chelsea have rebutted allegations of misconduct made by Manchester United in an eight-month old letter to Fifa concerning John Obi Mikel that was leaked to the media on Monday. Nigerian midfielder Mikel has been involved in a transfer dispute between Chelsea, Manchester United and Norwegian club FC Lyn Oslo, where he has been playing.

 ?Chelsea is aware that at least one copy of a confidential letter from FC Lyn Oslo and Manchester United to Fifa dated May 18, 2005, that made unfounded allegations against Chelsea in the case of John Obi Mikel, has been leaked to the media,? Chelsea said in a statement. ?It is outrageous that confidential correspondence has been leaked in an attempt to smear Chelsea?s name and undermine a Fifa process and pressurise Mikel.? 

 Madrid: Uefa will be reviewing progress in its campaign against racism in European football and calling for further action to combat the problem at the second ?Unite Against Racism? conference at Barcelona?s Nou Camp on Wednesday.

 Uefa president Lennart Johannsson says European football?s governing body is determined to take a tough stance and wants to encourage more pro-active measures by clubs, national associations and other groups. 

 Sydney: The absence of Lleyton Hewitt has forced Australia to choose a new and relatively inexperienced squad for next month?s Davis Cup first-round tie against Switzerland in Geneva.

 Wayne Arthurs, world No. 97, is the highest ranked player in the four-man squad although he is better known as a doubles player. The other members are Peter Luczak (ranked 116th), Chris Guccione (149th) and doubles specialist Paul Hanley. Mark Philippoussis was overlooked because his ranking has slipped to 166.

 Hewitt, ranked 11th in the world, announced that he was unavailable for the tie because of an ankle injury, following a protracted public row with Tennis Australia.

 London: Motorcycling world champion Valentino Rossi?s three-day test session with the Ferrari Formula One team was delayed by rain at Valencia on Tuesday.

 The charismatic Italian, who has had private sessions with Ferrari, was due to test the F2004 car at the Spanish track as part of a process some think will result in the 26-year-old switching from two wheels to four for 2007 or 2008.

 A Ferrari spokesman said that the five-time MotoGP champion was at the circuit but the team would wait until there were better track conditions before he went out. Rossi will share the track with Ferraris seven times world champion Michael Schumacher, Brazilian Felipe Massa as well as Honda, McLaren, Williams, BMW and Toyota drivers at Valencia.

 No magic potion for success: Chappell 

Kingston: Team India coach Greg Chappell warded off aggressive questions on the teams tactics in the ongoing Test series against the West Indies by claiming there is no magic potion to produce favourable results for his team. 

We have played good solid cricket in this series and could have won at least one of the three previous Tests. There is no magic potion as a lot depends on conditions and pitches, said Chappell after his team had a workout in hot and humid conditions at a club ground on Wednesday. 

India have just about failed to topple the West Indies in two of the previous three Tests and understandably it has brought the four-bowler theory under the scanner. 

But Chappell isnt the one to get bogged down in the debate. I have said on numerous occasions that though winning and losing is important, it isnt everything. As long as you keep doing the required work, keep improving, there is a good future ahead for the young bowlers and the team. 

Under the circumstances, our three young fast bowlers have done reasonably well. We have had more wickets than what the West Indies have managed in the series, Chappell said. 

Chappell backed his struggling left-handed batsman Yuvraj Singh. He had nets this morning and looked in good touch. I am sure he will bounce back in this game, Chappell on Wednesday. 

Our batsmen have done some solid work. Laxman played an important knock in the previous Test. We just need to keep doing it. (PTI)

 Randhawa finishes tied 47th 

Gleneagles: A double bogey on the 13th, soon after two back-to-back birdies, proved costly for Jyoti Randhawa as he ended with a par round of 73 and an aggregate of two-under 290 at the Johnnie Walker Golf Championship here.The Indian finished tied 47th and earned euros 9,635, taking his total to euros 238,032. He is now joint 57th on European Order of Merit. 

Randhawa had a disappointing start with a bogey on second, but he steadied his play and parred the next eight holes. 

He then birdied the 11th and 12th and seemed set for a good finish. But a double bogey on the very next hole dashed his hopes. He did, however, finish with a birdie for the third day in a row for a 73. 

Britains Paul Casey clinched his second Gleneagles title in six years with a one-under-par 72 to total 16-under 276, a stroke better than compatriot Andrew Marshall and Denmarks Soren Hansen. (Agencies)

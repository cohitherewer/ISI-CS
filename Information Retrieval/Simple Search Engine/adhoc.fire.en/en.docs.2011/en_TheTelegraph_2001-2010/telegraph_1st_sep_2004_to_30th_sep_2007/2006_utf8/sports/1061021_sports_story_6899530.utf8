 7-wkt haul for Sarkar

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Jamshedpur: A superb exhibition of pace bowling by Sourav Sarkar helped Bengal dismiss Jharkhand for 206 on the opening day of the three-day CK Nayudu (under-22) East Zone league tie at Keenan Stadium on Friday. 

Sarkar, who has represented India Under-19, returned figures of seven for 66 to negate the advantage the hosts got on winning the toss.

Meanwhile, a Bihar Cricket Association (BCA) team which arrived here from Patna for the meet went back after being refused participation by the Jharkhand State Cricket Association (JSCA).

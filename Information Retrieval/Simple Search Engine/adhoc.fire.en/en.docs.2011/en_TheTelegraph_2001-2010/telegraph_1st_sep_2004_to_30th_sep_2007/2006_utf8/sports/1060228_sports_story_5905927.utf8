 I intend trying to live up to expectations: Chawla 

 - Yuvraj hopes to be fit for second Test 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Piyush Chawla

Nagpur: Of the two absolute rookies in Team India, quick Vikram Rajvir Singh and leggie Piyush Chawla, the former isnt feeling any pressure. Its different for schoolkid Chawla, though. 

The pressure is there... However, when the chance comes my way, I intend trying to live up to expectations, the Moradabad-based Chawla pointed out on Monday evening, not too long before Wednesdays start to the three-Test series against England. 

Chandigarhs Singh (21), on the other hand, said he was positive about bowling in conditions which favour spinners a lot more than the speed merchants. Im ready... Im not feeling any pressure, he added. 

Chawla accepted he wasnt a big turner and that line and length was his forte. Anil Kumble and Shane Warne (in that order) have been his inspiration. Incidentally, the past few months have taught the 17-year-old to bowl long spells on flat wickets. 

More than Singh, who was picked for the last two ODIs against Sri Lanka (in November) despite being unfit, Chawla is in the running for a first XI berth. 

Meanwhile, the injured Yuvraj Singh has arrived for closer monitoring of his left hamstring rehab. The one positive is that he recovers fast... It differs from individual to individual, but the injury may require three weeks of rehab, physio John Gloster told The Telegraph. 

Yuvraj got injured during the final ODI, in Karachi, on February 19. Despite that, he was both Man-of-the-Match and Man-of-the-Series. Hopefully, Im going to be fit for the second Test (Mohali, from March 9), he remarked.

 Lara showed why hes so special: Dravid

 - Soca Warriors debut inspired us, says Windies captain after setting up draw in second Test 

 Brian Lara after reaching his 32nd Test century on Tuesday 

Gros Islet: Captain Rahul Dravid was left to take heart from the fact that Indias reputation as poor travellers was on the mend after the second Test too escaped from his grasp here on Wednesday. 

We have a reputation of being poor travellers. But in the last two Tests we have come very close to winning on foreign soil. We have shown that we can play good cricket abroad, said Dravid. 

Still, Dravids disappointment slipped through when he mentioned the intervention of rain on the fourth day and the possibility of his fielders doing better close to the wicket. 

There were one or two close chances we could have held. These catches on slow and low wickets, when you are standing close to the batsmen, could be tricky. But to be honest, if we can pick one or two of these sharp chances, we can produce results in close games. 

The most critical miss, in the overall context, was the half chance of Lara at forward short leg on 71 which Yuvraj Singh could not latch on to. 

Dravid also chose to mention Virender Sehwags bowling and the batting of Lara which he described as the difference in the result. 

Sehwag bowls a lovely line for an off-spinner. He bowls in good areas and it has been always a question if he would be consistent. It was great to see him bowl in consistent areas for long spells in this Test. 

As for Lara, he showed why he is such a special player. The way he played our spinners and especially Kumble was brilliant. He sussed up the wicket well, he sussed up the situation very well. He was the difference. No wonder he is the sort of genius that he is. 

Meanwhile, Lara says his match-saving knock helped him learn about aspects of his batting which he had not known existed while scoring his previous 31 centuries. 

The 37-year-old West Indian captain said he had now learnt that he could bat for long periods without scoring a double ton and also how to slug it out when the team really needed him to. 

My batting is usually an attacking treat when I look to dominate. I would set up more victories than save a Test. Today was different. I learnt a lot about my batting, he said on his outstanding 120 which helped his team draw the Test against India here on Wednesday. 

Lara also revealed that his team drew inspiration from Trinidad and Tobagos creditable draw against Sweden in World Cup football in Germany. 

Watching the Soca Warriors, they had to battle for 90 minutes for a draw. We had 98 overs to do it. That was sort of the reason why we got out there and tried to do it. 

At no point of time was I or the team on top of the bowling. The innings that you really enjoy are ones you tough out. My 153 against Australia in 1999 was much better than my 375 or 500. 

Lara did not hide his disappointment at Sarwans inability to reproduce his domination of one-dayers in the Tests. 

Explaining his coming up the order at No. 3, Lara said: I came out to bat at No. 3 because you dont want to be two down after the first 5 or 10 overs. Also the fast bowlers could get the ball to nip back to the right-handers and I thought a left-hander would be the best man to handle it. 

Lara expressed his disappointment at the kind of pitches that have been dished out in the series so far and made a subtle call for more life in the strips for the remaining two Tests. 

Lara has also urged the selectors to give him a genuine fast bowler who can trouble the prolific Indian batsmen in the remaining two matches. 

Lara said his side was sorely missing bowlers like Tino Best and Jermaine Lawson and it was unfortunate that his calls for their selection were falling on deaf ears. 

I need that fast bowler who makes the opposition uncomfortable, especially if the pitch is in his favour, he said. 

Ive spoken to the selectors and I feel its unfortunate Im getting negative feedback because of that, he said after his gritty 120-run knock helped his team salvage a draw. 

I think as captain of the team, they must have some sort of trust in that person, said the batsman whose vote is not counted in selection matters.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Parthiv aiming for a big one

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: If his unbeaten 97 a responsible knock considering the time it came in against hosts Bengal is of any indication, then the kid behind the stumps it seems has grown up. 

Once the wonderkid of Indian cricket, who had become Test crickets youngest wicketkeeper (at 17 years, 153 days), Prathiv later drew much flak after his glove-work became increasingly sloppy. 

Replaced by the Dinesh Karthik in Indias home Test series against Australia (in 2004-05), its been a walk on the tightropes for the diminutive wicketkeeper. If that was not enough, emergence of Mahendra Singh Dhoni in Indian cricket was the last nail in the coffin. 

Since then, it has been a start from the scratch for the Ahmedabad lad. 

However, at the moment its Ranji (and leading his side to victory) that is on his mind. 

Talking to The Telegraph on the sidelines of their teams post-match drill on Sunday, a relaxed-looking Parthiv said: Im still very positive about my comeback. 

Its been a good start to the season, having fared well in Challenger and then Duleep. 

On the edge of his first Ranji century, Parthiv however feels that a century is not enough to catch the selectors eyes. Hungry for more runs, he said: A big one, however, will definitely make a difference. 

The target, for the match on Day II, is to post a 300-plus total, which will be helpful with our seamers being our strength. Theres definitely something for the seamers on the green wicket. Today, Ranadeb bowled pretty well

 Indians test positive, again

Colombo: A fresh doping storm was brewing with India on Thursday being named as one of the four countries whose athletes returned positive dope tests in the recent South Asian Games. 

The Sri Lanka Olympic Committee (SLOC) refused to divulge either the names or number of the athletes who had tested positive but said the respective national associations have been informed of the findings of the drug tests done at a lab in Malaysia. 

Hemasiri Fernando, president of the SLOC, said the preliminary investigation normally lasted 24 days and the rules did not permit the hosts to reveal the names of athletes till the process was completed. 

The news of Sri Lankan woman sprinter Jani Chathurangani de Silva and Pakistani men boxers Nauman Karim and Dur Mahmud having tested positive at the Games came two days ago. 

Nepal are said to be the fourth country that has turned in a positive test. 

According to Fernando, the Malaysian lab reports were made available two days ago and three weeks remained for the investigation process to be completed. (PTI)

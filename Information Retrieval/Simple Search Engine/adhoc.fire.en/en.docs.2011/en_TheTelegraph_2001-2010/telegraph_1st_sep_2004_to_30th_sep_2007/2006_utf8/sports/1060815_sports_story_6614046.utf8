 My role has changed, says Jayasuriya

Colombo: Sanath Jayasuriya says he has shed the 1996 World Cup role of a slambang opener and has donned the mantle of mentor by virtue of being the senior most player in the Sri Lankan squad. 

In 1996, that time the combination was different. We had a lot of seniors in the team and it was up to me and Kalu (Romesh Kaluwitharana) to play the shots, the veteran batsman said. 

Now, the (my) game has not changed but the role has. Now I am a senior in the team and I share my experiences with the youngsters. And the younsters have done well. Players like Upul Tharanga are doing a great job. They are going after the bowlers. 

Jayasuriya is returning to the side after announcing his retirement prior to the England tour. 

That decision to call it a day followed a string of poor scores and chief selector Ashantha de Mels individual statement to the effect that the Matara marauders career was as good as over. 

The 37-year-old has scored 938 runs at 67.00 in 10 Tests against India and his three centuries include the marathon 340 he made here at the SSC a decade ago. 

Jayasuriya also said he was keen on getting 100 Test wickets. 

That was one milestone I was keen about but it did not work. I am looking for it, it will come naturally, said Jayasuriya, who has 96 Test scalps to his credit. (PTI)

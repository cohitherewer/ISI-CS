 Houghton hopeful

 - Tie vs Iran 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Doha: Fifty-five years ago, in New Delhi, India won their first international football title when they defeated Iran in the inaugural Asian Games final by a Mewalal goal. Later, the pint-sized scorer said that he was congratulated by the then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru after the match. 

The scenario now is different. On Wednesday night, when India take on Iran in their concluding group league match at the Al Sadd Stadium, their main aim would be to stay afloat in the tournament, which at this point in time, seems impossible. 

For a team, which is placed 148 in the Fifa rankings and has won just one match in the past 12 months, it would be far too much to imagine about taming the champions of the last two Asian Games. 

The Indian coach Bob Houghton admits that Iran are one of the best teams here, but is still hoping to perform a miracle on Wednesday. Standing under the scorching sun after a 90-minute practice session at the Al Gharrafa Stadium, Houghton smiled when asked about his teams prospects against Iran. 

Iran and Uzbekistan, in my opinion, are the two best teams here. Japan are also a good team, but they are a bit inexperienced. I still hope to beat Iran as thats the only option we are left with, said the British coach. 

I can still go for a draw and end up the Games without losing a match, but thats not my way of thinking, Houghton said. 

After beating the Maldives, my boys are in great mood. We want to go to the quarter finals and for that we need to win. I dont believe in going for a draw and concede three goals. It has no value to me. 

Houghton is not ready to attach much importance to Bhaichung Bhutias absence. That is one thing you cant help. (Sunil) Chhetri will play in his place. Surkumar (Singh) will lead the side. He played a great game in the last match, didnt he? asked the coach. 

The last time India played Iran in the 1963 pre-Olympics in 1963, they were mauled both home (Rabindra Sarovar Stadium, Calcutta) and away. (Tehran). India, then, were coached by British trainer Harry Wright, whose tactics came under widespread criticism. Wright was sacked almost immediately. 

One only hopes that Houghton doesnt repeat the mistakes of his predecessor.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Sourav and I are in same boat: Wright

 - One is hoping for a comeback, the other looking to keep his place 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Sourav Ganguly and John Wright 

Mumbai: Sourav (Ganguly) and I are in the same boat, mate... We dont know whether well be going for the World Cup, remarked former Team India coach John Wright, a familiar face on the TV screens during the Champions Trophy. 

While Sourav is still hoping to make a comeback, Wright isnt sure whether hes going to be retained on the commentators panel for crickets showpiece event. I guess things will be clear in about a month, he told The Telegraph on Sunday. 

Wright, of course, added: I must say Ive enjoyed doing television... That I did a lot of studio work (from Mumbai) and, therefore, didnt have to travel much made it easier... However, at this point, I cant say whether doing commentary is my future... 

Indias early exit from the Champions Trophy dashed his chances of a get-together with his one-time wards. Its a regret... I bumped into some of the players at the Chandigarh airport and some others made it a point to call me... I just couldnt meet them collectively, though. 

Asked to rate Indias chances on the forthcoming tour of South Africa, Wright said: Its going to be tough and the boys will have to put enough runs on the board... One of my toughest tours as coach was the one in 2001-02 to South Africa... Its going to be a huge challenge. 

Wright, it may be recalled, was coach from November 2000 till April 2005. Sourav was the captain throughout, except on the occasions he wasnt fit or got a break.

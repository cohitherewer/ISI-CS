 Abu Dhabi: India A outplayed Pakistan A in 

 all departments of the game for a convincing 34-run win 

 in the Eurasia Series limited overs tournament here on Friday 

 night.

 After producing a powerful batting performance to post a 

 challenging 269 for six, the Indians dismissed their arch-rivals 

 for 235 in the day-night encounter at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium.

 The win saw India top group A after the first phase of the 

 league stage with two wins from as many matches.

 They will now play the second and third placed teams of 

 group B hosts UAE and Ireland in the second 

 phase.

 Bazid Khan stood tall among the ruins with 87 for Pakistan 

 who had the consolation of gaining a bonus point from the 

 match.

 Rudra Pratap Singh (2/39), Vikram Rajvir Singh (3/33), Reetinder 

 Singh Sodhi (2/34) and Ravinder Jadeja (2/28) shared the 

 spoils for India.

 Earlier, India As top order batsmen fired in unison 

 to prop up the Indian total.

 After Robin Uthappa and Shikhar Dhawan put up a century 

 opening stand, captain Y. Venugopal Rao (45) and Rohit Sharma 

 (62) consolidated with another strong partnership.

 Uthappa and Dhawan each made 52, but the latter at a quicker 

 rate. 

 The Karnataka batsman faced 61 balls and hit six fours while 

 the Delhi players runs came from 51 balls with 11 

 boundaries.

 Their left-right combination kept the Pakistani attack at 

 bay while stitching 100 runs for the first wicket from inside 

 17 overs. Dhawan repeatedly slash-cut the Paksitani pacers 

 who tried to bounce the Indian batsmen.

 Sania, Leander advance

 - Partners injury forces Bhupathi out 

New York: Not discouraged by her singles exit at the US Open, Indias Sania Mirza, partnering South African Liezel Huber, moved into the second round of the womens doubles in style. 

Leander Paes and Czech Republics Martin Damm also advanced into the second round of the mens event with a facile victory over Petr Pala and Robin Vik on Friday. 

Paes and Damm, the sixth seeds, knocked out the Czech combo 6-1, 6-2 in the first round. 

Sania and her partner Liezel, the 11th seeds, outplayed the American duo of Angela Haynes and Neha Uberoi 6-4, 6-0 in the first round at Flushing Meadows on Thursday. 

Sania and Liezel, who won the Bangalore Open title this February, next play Stephanie Cohen-Aloro of France and Maria Jose Martinez Sanchez of Spain, who defeated Austrian Sybille Bammer and Julia Schruff of Germany 7-5, 6-2 in their opening match. 

Sania had earlier lost in the second round of the singles, going down 7-5, 1-6, 2-6 to Francesca Schiavone of Italy. 

Meanwhile, multiple Grand Slam champion Mahesh Bhupathi and Argentinas Paola Suarez pulled out of the mixed doubles event. 

We had to pull out because Paola was injured, Bhupathi said.

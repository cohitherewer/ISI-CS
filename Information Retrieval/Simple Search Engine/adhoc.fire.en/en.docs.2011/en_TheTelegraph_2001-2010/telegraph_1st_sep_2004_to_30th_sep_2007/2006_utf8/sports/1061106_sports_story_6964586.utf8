 Jungs Mission 

 - Shooter for 4 events in Doha 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: Samresh Jung is having mixed fortunes. 

In February, he was the biggest star in Indian shooting horizon after winning five gold medals in the Commonwealth Games. In the next few months, he was forced to take a backseat after Gagan Narang, Abhinav Bindra and Manavjit Singh clinched gold in world level meets and Jung returned home empty handed. 

The 35-year-old shooter is yet to get his Olympic berth but in the Asian Games next month, he could be Indias man to watch out for in the pistol events. Being the only Indian to qualify for four events in Doha air pistol, free pistol, centre fire pistol and standard pistol Jung is now preparing hard at the Karni Singh shooting range here to make a golden return in the international arena. 

Asked on his chances in the Asian Games, the Delhi-based shooter said: It is going to be a strong field in Doha as shooters from China and Korea will be there in full strength, said Jung. I have been training hard and hope to get a medal. 

Jung confessed he was having a problem in peaking at the right moment. Somehow, I reach my best form either a day before the match day or a day after. It seldom comes in the match day. This is something I have to overcome, said Jung with a quiet smile. 

Has the pressure of expectations after the Commonwealth Games led to his poor form in recent months? I turned famous overnight after being adjudged the best sportsperson in the Commonwealth Games. But I do not do what people expect from me. I do only what I am capable of, stated the shooter firmly.

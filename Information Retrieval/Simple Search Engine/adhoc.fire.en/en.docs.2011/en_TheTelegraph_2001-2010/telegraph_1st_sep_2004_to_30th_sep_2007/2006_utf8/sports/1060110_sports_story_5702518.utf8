 Dempo hold edge over Sporting

Margao: Defending champions Dempo take on Super Cup champions Sporting Clube de Goa in the inaugural match of the 10th ONGC National Football League at Nehru Stadium, Fatorda, on Tuesday. 

Riddled with injuries, Dempo did not start the season well, losing out early in the Federation Cup and Durand Cup. But the title win in Goas professional league early this year have lifted their morale and they are all set to make an impression in the NFL to retain the title. 

Both teams are evenly poised but Dempo hold an edge over their rivals as they have beaten them thrice from four outings. Dempo coach Armando Colacos main worry is injuries to his key players. With Riston Rodrigues, Jose Colaco and Valeriano Rebello being ruled out due to knee injuries, he will have to rely on his stop gap players in the initial stage of the league. 

Armando is hopeful his latest Brazilian recruit, Roberto Mendes Silva, will be an able foil to Nigerian Ranty Martins who has been in good nick this season. 

I know it will be tough to maintain our position. But I like the challenge. I will use all the resources available to maintain the top position till our key players return from injuries, Colaco said. 

Sporting coach Clifford Chukawama was disappointed when they lost to Mahindras in the Federation Cup finals and later to Army XI in the Durand Cup finals. 

This is a thing I do not want to be repeated. I have told my boys to concentrate till the end and I am hopeful they wont let me down this year, he said. The spirit of our boys is high since they want to start on a winning note, he added. (Pti)

 Imran hits out at Woolmer

Karachi: Imran Khan on Tuesday said he was dejected at Pakistans poor performance in the one-day series against Englands weakest outfit. 

This was the poorest performance by any Pakistan team and considering England was the weakest one-day outfit, I am disappointed at the one-day series result, Imran said. 

He strongly criticised Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer for not helping Inzamam with a proper strategy. Woolmer muddled things and its amazing that he has failed to find a suitable opening pair in two years, said Imran, who said Pakistan need to solve this problem before next years World Cup. (AFP)

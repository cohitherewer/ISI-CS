 Tiger to skip season 

opener

Kapalua (Hawaii): Tiger Woods decided Friday to skip the season-opening Mercedes-Benz Championship, meaning the PGA Tours new era in golf will begin next week amid old questions about the absence of its biggest star. 

Woods, who was skiing with his family last week in Colorado, said he did not have time to get his game ready and wanted to spend more time with his family. 

He has won six consecutive PGA Tour events, a streak that will remain on hold until January 25 at the Buick Invitational in San Diego, where Woods is the two-time defending champion. 

Woods said on his website that he has spent the last 12 days skiing and relaxing with family and friends, but Ive basically been away from golf since winning the Target World Challenge on December 17. 

I considered playing in next weeks Mercedes-Benz Championship, the official launch of the new FedExCup, but I just havent been able to prepare, Woods said. I usually spend at least one week working on my game before a tournament, and have been unable to do that this year. 

It is the second straight year Woods will not play the winners-only tournament. He missed last year to spend time with his father, whose health was failing from cancer. Earl Woods died May 3. The only other time Woods did not go to Kapalua was in 2003, when he was recovering from knee surgery. 

Hopefully, everyone will understand, Woods said. Obviously, this was a tough decision because Gary Planos and his staff at Kapalua Resort always do such a great job with the event. 

Woods absence this year is also a setback to PGA Tour officials trying to build momentum for its new FedExCup competition. 

The tour revamped its schedule to feature a points race that starts at Mercedes-Benz Championship and concludes with four playoff tournaments at the end of the season, with the winner getting euro7.6 million ($10 million) in deferred compensation. 

The season starts Thursday without two of the tours most popular players Woods and Masters champion Phil Mickelson, who has not played at Kapalua since 2001.

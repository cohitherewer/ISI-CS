 Records not my goal: Ronaldo

Koenigstein: Ronaldo wants to win the World Cup and isnt thinking about the records he could break along the way. 

The Brazil striker needs three more goals to become the tournaments all-time leading scorer. Ronaldo has 12 World Cup goals, two fewer than the record set by Germanys Gerd Muller and one fewer than Just Fontaine of France. 

Its not my main goal, Ronaldo said on Sunday. The most important thing is to win the World Cup. 

Ronaldo, who is tied with Pele as Brazils greatest scorer in World Cups, said hes not worried about trying to win the Player of the Tournament award either. The competition is not to see whos the best player, its to see which team will win it, Ronaldo said. If a Brazilian is chosen the best player, it will be a good sign, because we will likely be in the final, possibly winning it. 

Ronaldo said the recent speculation about his weight is in the past, and that hes feeling very well for the teams opener against Croatia on Tuesday in Berlin.

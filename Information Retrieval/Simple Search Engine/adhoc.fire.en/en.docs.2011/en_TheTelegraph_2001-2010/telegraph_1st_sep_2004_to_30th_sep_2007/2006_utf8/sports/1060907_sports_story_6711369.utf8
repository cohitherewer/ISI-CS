 Portugal bid to avoid Fifa ban

Lisbon: The Portuguese soccer federation asked a Lisbon court on Wednesday to grant it exceptional powers in order to avoid a threatened Fifa ban. 

Getting a public interest order would enable the federation to override a previous court decision blocking the relegation of a team Gil Vicente to the second division. 

Fifa threatened on Monday to ban Portuguese teams from all international competitions if the dispute which has disrupted the domestic league schedule is not settled by September 14. (AP)

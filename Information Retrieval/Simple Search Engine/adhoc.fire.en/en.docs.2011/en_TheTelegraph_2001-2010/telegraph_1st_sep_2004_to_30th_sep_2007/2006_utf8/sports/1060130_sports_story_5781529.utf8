 Deep amp; Co. pay price for missed chances

 - RANJI FINAL Kaif (92), Raina (61 ..) put UP in strong position 

A CORRESPONDENT

 Kaif played a composed knock 

Lucknow: Sloppy fielding put Bengal in a spot on the opening day of their Ranji Trophy final against Uttar Pradesh at the K.D. Singh Babu Stadium on Sunday. At close, the hosts were sitting pretty on 299 for three. 

Deep Dasgupta lost the toss and Mohammed Kaif had no hesitation in deciding to bat. The visitors lethargic attitude on the field led to three important catches being dropped. 

Uttar Pradesh batsmen made most of the let-offs with Praveen Kumar and Shivakant Shukla setting up a 78-run opening stand. Kaif then relished the flat wicket scoring 92, before being dismissed by Shiv Sagar Singh. Suresh Raina was batting on 61 at the close. 

After a delayed start due to a wet outfield because of overnight dew, Bengal mediumpacers expected initial breakthroughs but shoddy slip catching let them down. Praveen was let off by Subhamoy Das off Ranadeb Bose in the fourth over. Praveen went on to make a superb 48 in 55 balls with five fours and a six. 

Fellow opener Shivakant kept the momentum going along with Kaif after Praveen;s departure. Shivakant before being caught brilliantly by Rohan Gavaskar in the mid-off region, struck 71 in 181 balls with the help of 10 glorious boundaries. The pair added 123 for the second wicket. 

Kaif, who played a composed knock, was a true picture of determination. After struggling a bit in the middle, the righthander came into his own and frustrated the Bengal attack throughout the day. Kaif survived on 22 when he edged an outswinger by Shib Shankar Paul to Manoj Tewari at second slip. Tewari was slow in reacting and the ball raced to the fence for a boundary. 

His 92 runs came off 158 balls and included nine fours and two huge sixes. Kaif was dismissed after Shiv Sagar sent his middle stump flying with a good length delivery. 

But it didnt bring any respite to the Bengal bowlers as young Raina and Rizwan Shamshad kept the momentum going. Raina was dropped on 28 by Arindam Das at second slip off SS Paul. Raina ended the day with an unbeaten 61 in 94 balls with nine fours. 

Shiv Sagar was the most successful of the bowlers with two wickets. But the other bowlers failed to make an impression. 

Pacers Paul and Ranadeb bowled well only in patches while Sourashish Lahiri was unimpressive. 

Bengal coach Paras Mhambrey appeared dejected and did not wish to speak to media after the match. Instead, the former India pacer spared time with his bowlers after the days play.

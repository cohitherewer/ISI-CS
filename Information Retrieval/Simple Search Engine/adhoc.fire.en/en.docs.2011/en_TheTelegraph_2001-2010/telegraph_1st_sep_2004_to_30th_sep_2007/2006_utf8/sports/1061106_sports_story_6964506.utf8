The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Lanka A nudge ahead

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: It happened inside the opening hour of Day II at the Eden on Sunday. Kaushik Reddy dismissed Malintha Warnapura in the days very first over and then opener Mahela Udawatte, setting up a perfect platform for South to return Sri Lanka A their own medicine. 

However, Sreesanths waywardness gave the visitors the chance to bounce back. Worse, the pacer got himself engaged in a verbal exchange with the new batsman and former Sri Lankan international Jehan Mubarak. The onfield umpires intervened and the India bowler, now more charged up, went on to start his run-up again. 

The incident led to Sreesanth being cautioned by Match Referee Sanjay Patil after the match. It just happens in the game, the mediumpacer pointed out later. 

But the islanders seemed to take the bowlers act as inspiration enough to frustrate him and his team further. The result was immediate: the possibility of a South-like collapse (14 for five in the first hour of Day I) vanished, and when Sri Lanka A ended, a lead of 61 was already on the board. 

Dinesh Karthik survived a few scares to remain unbeaten on 16 along with Robin Uthappa (batting on 7) as South were 24 without loss at stumps. 

Sri Lanka A captain Thilan Samaraweera first steadied the ship with a well-compiled 69, inspired Mubarak to script a 34-ball 32 in 49-run fourth-wicket stand.

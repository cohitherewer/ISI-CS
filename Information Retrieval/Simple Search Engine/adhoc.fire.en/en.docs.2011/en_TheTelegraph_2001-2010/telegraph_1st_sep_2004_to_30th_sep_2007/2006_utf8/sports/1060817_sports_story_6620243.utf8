The Chandigarh-based athlete, a state gold medal winner, said in her FIR that the first incident happened about six months ago. We have received a complaint that the athletes coach and three accomplices first raped her about six months ago. On August 10, they raped her again when they came to visit her from Rajasthan, a Sector 5 police officer, where the complaint has been lodged, said. 

According to the police, the coach, Subhash Jogi, runs a sports club in Jhunjhunu, Rajasthan, where the athlete used to train. 

She has stated that she did not complain earlier as she was being blackmailed by Jogi who claimed that he was in possession of CDs, pictures and MMS of her in compromising positions. On August 10, Jogi visited Gurgaon and asked her to meet him and take back the CDs. Instead, she was abused again, police said.

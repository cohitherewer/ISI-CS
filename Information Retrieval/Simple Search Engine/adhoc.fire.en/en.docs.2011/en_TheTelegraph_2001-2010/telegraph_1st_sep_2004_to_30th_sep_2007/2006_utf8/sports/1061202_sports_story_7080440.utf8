Calcutta: The urgency to have bouncy pitches at home has made the headlines following Indias hattrick of humiliating defeats in South Africa. The aim is obviously to make Indian batsmen comfortable on tracks they face in countries like Australia and South Africa, and come up a cropper on. 

Though none of the BCCI mandarins were around at the Eden on Friday, chairman of selectors Dilip Vengsarkar was at hand to witness the sad state of affairs in domestic cricket. On the opening day, the ball hardly rose above the knee and the slowness made it tougher for bowlers. Perhaps unable to sit through another session of painful cricket, the former India captain decided to leave the ground almost an hour before tea. 

Having sensed the nature of the wicket in advance, Mumbai decided to go into the Super League group B Ranji match with four specialist bowlers. Such wickets not only make the task of bowlers difficult, it also sows a false sense of security in batsmens mind. Not to mention about the way it puts off the spectators. No wonder the few thousands who gathered on bandh day, hardly got entertained. 

Deep Dasgupta had no hesitation in choosing to bat first and Bengal reached 226 for two at stumps on Friday. After Arindam Das soft dismissal, Amitava Chakraborty (81) and birthday boy Avishek Jhunjhunwala (87 batting) added 130 for the second wicket that put the hosts on a solid platform. 

Amitava played the sheet anchors role to perfection. Avishek was more positive in approach. Amitava showed concentration and determination in chalking out an innings that lasted 317 minutes and 232 balls. Playing his first match after two seasons, he was circumspect to start with but showed the necessary application and patience to deliver. 

Avishek, on the other hand, was ready to punish the loose balls, as is evident from the 14 boundaries he hit. If he gets to his second first-class century on Saturday, it will be a reward for his hunger for runs. 

The Mumbai pacers were ordinary, Rajesh Verma and Swapneel Hazare hardly showing the zeal to extract something out of the lifeless track. Even Ramesh Powar and Nilesh Kulkarni were unimpressive, never able to put the batsman in any trouble. A few deliveries from the off-spinner did turn towards the close, but that wasnt encouraging enough. 

Bengal got five penalty runs after Mumbai wicketkeeper Vinayak Samant dropped his gloves to attempt a run out, but the throw hit the gloves. 

If Bengal manage to reach around 450, it might turn out to be tough for the inexperienced Mumbai batsmen. How they bat under pressure against the home bowlers will decide the course of this game.

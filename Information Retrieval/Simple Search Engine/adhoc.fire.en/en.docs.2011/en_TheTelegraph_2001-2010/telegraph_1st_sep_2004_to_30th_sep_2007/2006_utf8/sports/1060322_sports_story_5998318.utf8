The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 A bizarre decision

 - Jadeja to lead in warm-up tie vs England 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Ajay Jadeja 

Mumbai: Ajay Jadeja, who was banned by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) for being involved with match-fixing, has been named the Rajasthan Cricket Association Presidents XI captain for the limited overs match against England, in Jaipur, on Saturday. 

Thats going to be the visitors only exposure to limited overs cricket before the seven ODIs get underway on March 28. 

The Rajasthan body (headed by Lalit Modi) can, of course, argue Jadeja captained the state team in this about-to-end season. However, retaining him for such a high-profile match is nothing short of bizarre. 

The national selectors, it seems, had no role except possibly recommending eight players ? Parthiv Patel, Gautam Gambhir, Ramesh Powar, Yalaka Venugopal Rao, Suresh Raina, Rudra Pratap Singh, Piyush Chawla and Vikram Rajvir Singh ? to those who made the selection. 

All are in the 17-strong squad. 

Asked by The Telegraph (on Tuesday evening) whether the England team management had a comment, Media manager Andrew Walpole said: We have nothing to say at this stage... In any case, you should be asking the Indian Board... 

The Boards executive secretary in-charge, Prof. Ratnakar Shetty, who issued the Media release, had nothing to say apart from Ive just passed on the squad forwarded to me by Rajasthan... 

Jadeja was handed out a five-year ban in December 2000, but resumed playing domestic cricket from the 2003-04 season itself after getting a favourable court order. 

Meanwhile, its confirmed England captain Andrew Flintoff will make a quick trip home once the Test series ends on Wednesday. The visit is going to be for purely personal reasons ? to see his second child (a son) born earlier this month ? and he will be back well before March 28. 

According to Walpole, no decision has been taken on the captain for the Jaipur engagement.

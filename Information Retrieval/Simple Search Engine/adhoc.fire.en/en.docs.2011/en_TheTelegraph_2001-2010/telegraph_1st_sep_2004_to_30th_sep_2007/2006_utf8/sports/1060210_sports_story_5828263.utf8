 Taufel: Very difficult for others to comprehend our challenges

 - I have pretty much achieved my goals for this year, says No. 1 umpire 

INDRANIL MAJUMDAR

 Simon Taufel

Islamabad: Umpiring started as a hobby for Simon Taufel. Then it was an avenue to earn some extra dollars as he took up a part-time job with Cricket Australia. Now, he has established himself as the best in business. 

The ICCs Umpire of the Year for the last two years, the New South Wales-based Taufel spoke to The Telegraph on Thursday morning. 

The following are excerpts 

On his experience of officiating in Indo-Pak matches 

These are big games since the interest and hype surrounding this contest is quite large. There are on and off-the-field challenges that have to be met. On-the-field challenges are easier to deal with because you try to keep things as simple as possible and get through them making the best decisions possible as you would normally do. 

Off-the-field challenges involving security, handling the media and being in hotels where there is a lot of enthusiasm are more difficult. 

Personally, its a great opportunity to try and perform well and add something to the game. Let the people remember the great cricket that is played rather than any umpiring aspect. 

On the pressure element 

I dont think there is any extra pressure. Its the same as umpiring in any other Test or ODI. However, environmental challenges like crowd noise, spectators getting into and away from the ground make our job difficult. 

On the field, players get along as in any other match. The players handle pressure particularly well. They realise the importance of the match from a diplomatic and political standpoint. Our task is to facilitate a good match. 

On whether the crowd noise is a big hindrance 

You cant hear. When youre officiating in front of a full house, the task is simply very difficult. Cricket is one of those games where hearing is very important to a match official as you often make a decision on what you hear rather than what you see. 

If you take that important sense away, its impossible. You find yourself drawing on other instincts and experience and skill to make decisions. So occasionally, you make an error based on the fact that you didnt hear something. 

Its okay for a player to do something wrong and get away, but thats not the case with an umpire. This is because the expectation is that he will get everything right. Thats what people demand and expect. 

Until you get into such an environment and try to judge an inside or outside edge, none will understand what it is like. Hence, its very difficult for others to comprehend the challenges involved. 

On being recognised as the best umpire for two consecutive years 

Its nice to be recognised as an integral part of the game. It doesnt really matter whether I get it or somebody else does. I think this award is going to inspire others to perform better. Personally, its a recognition for the hard work Im putting in. Im constantly working on my fitness, diet, skill development and technique, mental toughness, challenges of staying away from home and dealing with the local food and language, managing travelling regimes, time zones. 

There is also the relationship challenge of looking after my wife and two growing children and trying to be involved in their lives. There are so many other skills involved with umpiring these days beyond giving outs and not outs. We need to keep rising to those challenges. 

On the mental aspect 

Ninety per cent of the game is mental. You can stay physically fit through cardio exercises, strength work and improve flexibility through stretching but its all about staying mentally aware for each session, for each ball, each day and each game. Good personal routines help maintain good performance. But the real danger in routines is it breeds complacency. Just because its worked for you in the last couple of Tests doesnt mean if you follow it again, you will have a good match coming up. Im always trying to add variety to such routines. 

To go through a Test match, mentally have the right triggers available for each different day. 

When you go to Day 3, 4 or 5 you should be able to do the right things. Its all about making sure Im really focused and working hard for each delivery. 

You can easily get motivated on the first ball on Day 1, but to have the same amount of intent, focus and application on Day 5 is the real challenge. Im always trying to work on it. Im not taking things for granted, striving for that extra effort to ensure I give the player 100 per cent when deciding his fate. Thats mental challenge. 

On his experience of managing various cricketers 

Every player is different. Players respond to different actions differently. You sometimes need to put your arm around someone to stop him from getting upset, prevent conflicts. 

Sometimes you also need to take the hardline approach to ask some players to shut up and play the game of cricket. You have to learn which approach, soft or hard, is appropriate for an individual. Sometimes you need to step in quickly to prevent any conflict. 

Its not just an umpire versus player or player versus player conflict that you need to manage but sometimes you may not necessarily agree with an interpretation of your colleague. Its a constant man-management process which you have to experience and learn. 

On the use of technology 

There are good and bad sides to the argument. The main challenge is to now work out the right balance between how technology can help without being the main focus of the sport. 

I think we are still looking for the right balance on the role involving on-field and third umpires. Everyone wants to get the right decision. 

On his personal goals 

I set my goals for every tour and year. I look at specific goals to achieve on every tour and when I sit on the flight back home, I assess myself. In the end, I assess whether such stepping stone goals tally with my annual goal. 

I have pretty much achieved my goals for this year which expires in April.

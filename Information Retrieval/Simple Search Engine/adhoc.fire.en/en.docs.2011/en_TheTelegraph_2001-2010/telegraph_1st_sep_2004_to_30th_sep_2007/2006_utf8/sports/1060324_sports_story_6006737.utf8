The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Fransa players in a soup

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi: At a time when Fransa Pax chairman 

 Micky Pacheco was busy announcing the disbanding of the 

 club at one clock on Thursday afternoon in Panjim, 

 there was darkness at the club mess in Colva beach. 

Speaking to The Telegraph from Goa, Fransa goalkeeper and former India star Virender Singh said: We are in absolute dark about our future and have nowhere to go. In our chairmans battle with the All India Football Federation (AIFF), the players have become the sacrificial lambs. 

Virender is not the only one to find himself in deep trouble midway through the season because of the whimsical attitude of the club management. Eight other outstation players have been left to fend for themselves and have no idea what is in store for them in the rest of the season. 

While footballers like Mohd. Nizam, Paramjit RK and Jitesh came all the way from Kerala to earn their living and make a mark on the national scene, there are players in the squad from far away places like Bengal (Surajit Roy and Akshay Das), Manipur (Shanta Singh), Delhi (Rajat Guha) and Karnataka (Mark Mascarenhas). 

On Thursday morning, Fransa skipper Cressan Antao led a delegation of players to Pachecos office, hoping to change his mind. He was unrelenting, said a footballer. Micky sounded emotional and said he could not suffer any more injustice. He asked us not to misunderstand him and stay in touch in future. 

There is still some hope left for a few players. While Salgaocar may recruit Godwin Franco and Marcos Peixoto on loan, Dempo is interested in taking Cressan Antao, Peter Carvalho and Roque Barreto. The rest of the footballers have no other option but to wait till they receive their payment for the season. 

The players have not received their salaries for three months, though some payment was made before the Mohun Bagan match last week. Mr Pacheco has promised to make full payment in seven days time. All we can do now is to live on hopes, Virender said. 

Meanwhile, AIFF general secretary Alberto Colaco said he was deeply concerned about the future of the players. The AIFF may allow the Fransa players to be recruited by other clubs before the 10th round, he said here on Thursday. 

Colaco refused to comment on Fransas decision to disband the team. We know nothing officially. Let us watch the development first, he said. 

But the federation is believed to be ready to run the league with nine teams. It might also consider declaring the rest of the Fransa matches null and void.

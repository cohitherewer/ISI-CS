Chennai: Carlos Moya is the king of Chennai Open no more. Towering Croat Ivan Ljubicic usurped the throne in a bloodless coup at the Nungambakkam Stadium on Sunday evening. 

The world No. 9 not only denied the popular Spaniard a rare hattrick, he also announced to the world that he was in no hurry to cut short his phenomenal run of last season when he played eight finals and won two besides guiding Croatia to the Davis Cup pinnacle. 

Ljubicic had been in the finals of the years first week both in 2004 and 2005. Both those were in Doha where he had come out second-best to Nicolas Escude and Roger Federer, respectively. 

He sought a change in fortunes this time, and accepted a wild card offered three weeks ago. And didnt he make good use of the Chennai organisers gesture! 

What made Ljubicics fourth career title doubly joyful was his double-header on the final day. The elements having stopped the second semi-final after four games on Saturday night, Ljubicic had to come out at noon to complete unfinished business. As it turned out, it required one helluva effort from top seed Ljubicic to overcome his own lethargy and unseeded Belgian Kristof Vliegens high spirits for a 6-3, 3-6,7-6 (8-6) verdict. 

In comparison, the final ? five hours later ? was a breeze, as the 7-6 (8-6), 6-2 scoreline indicates. Moya had won the last three duels with Ljubicic, after losing their first three clashes. But Moya hadnt faced Ljubicic last year. As the Spaniard found out during the 100-minute final, the Croat was a much improved player. 

 He has become a more mature player, and makes very few mistakes, observed Moya, who had gone through four three-setters en route to the title round. 

 Ljubicics serve was the key on Sunday, as it is bound to be in any clash with a lesser server. Standing six-foot-four, its mostly stand-and-deliver as he whacks the ball hard and varies the direction too. The returns are thumped flat and furious. The expressionless face often makes him look like a robot at work, but why should he care as long as the wins keep coming? 

Four times Moya came to within a point of capturing Ljubicics service game, and all the four times the Croat unfurled unreturnable serves (he had a dozen aces in the final). 

Ljubicic didnt have a good start to the tie-breaker as well, trailing 0-4 and 2-5. Yet it was again those big serves which pulled the Croat out of the rut, and ultimately it was Moya who cracked by double-faulting on set-point. 

The tie-break signalled heartbreak for Moya. He struggled big-time with his serve, getting into trouble in every game. The third seed, who has slipped out of the top-20 after five years, managed to stave off two in the first game, only to succumb in games 3 and 5. 

There was to be no escape route for Moya, like Paradorn Srichaphan had offered him in last years final. 

Ljubicic presented a contrasting picture earlier in the day. The overcast and humid conditions of noon-time seemed to have put him off. He had a break in his pocket overnight (3-1 ahead) and managed to hang on to close out the first set. 

Thereafter, Ljubicics problems gained momentum even as Vliegen played some sparkling tennis. The 23-year-old Belgian, coming off his best year on the Tour, served-and-volleyed comfortably and put pressure on Ljubicics unusually subdued serve. 

Vliegen succeeded in breaking Ljubicic in the sixth game, pinning the Croat to the baseline and then bamboozling him with a forcing forehand crosscourt drive. With Vliegens all-court game very much on song, he made capital of the solitary service break to push a reluctant Ljubicic into a third set. 

Ljubicic realized he had to step up his serving standard. He did, raining aces clocking 223 kmph. That 12 of his 20 aces came in the third set says how desperate he was to win. He had two chances to wrest the initiative, but the Belgian was unflappable. He fired two fine first serves to wriggle out of break-point situations in game 8. 

The tie-breaker was inevitable, and Ljubicic gave his wife Aida (watching from the players box) and 200-odd some heart-stopping moments. The Davis Cup final hero messed up a high overhead backhand volley and found himself 2-5 in arrears. Ljubicic evened scores pouncing on a weak Vliegen second serve. 

That was the critical moment. Ljubicic faced a match-point, but fortunately that was on his serve. It was then Vliegens turn to stare at match-point. As his sliced backhand return found the net, Ljubicic was a relieved man.

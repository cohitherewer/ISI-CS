 Randhawas 2nd title on the trot

 - S.S.P. Chowrasia finishes third 

 Randhawa 

New Delhi: Jyoti Randhawa carded a final round of three-under-par 69 to clinch the Bilt Open at the Jaypee Greens Golf Course in on Sunday. 

The ace golfer, who won the Indian Open last week, finished with a total of 15-under-par 273 for his second win on the trot on home soil. 

Randhawa started the day one stroke ahead of Singapores Bing who finished second. He birdied the par-five second hole to increase his lead to two and get to 13-under-par for the tournament. 

But a bogey on the par-four sixth hole dropped him back to 12-under-par for the tournament and a tie with Bing. 

Randhawa immediately made amends with a birdie on the par-three seventh hole. However, he hit his drive left on the par-four eighth hole and found the bunker with his approach shot resulting in a bogey to make the turn at level-par for the day. 

He gained momentum on the back nine with birdies on the tenth and 12th holes and a final birdie on the 18th saw him get to 15-under-par and cruise to a comfortable three-stroke victory. 

S.S.P Chowrasia finished third after carding a one-under-par, 71 to take his overall total to 10-under-par, 278. He made ten straight pars and then dropped a shot on the par-four 11th hole. However, he birdied the 12th, 13th and 15th holes but a final bogey on the 17th hole coming in saw him card a one-under-par. Harmeet Kahlon finished sole fourth at eight-under-par, 280 after carding a 71. 

Digvijay Singh, Rahul Ganapathy, Shiv Kapur and Chirag Kumar finished tied fifth with a total of 281. Kapur had an error-free round till the last hole where he dropped his only stroke of the day en route to a four-under-par, 68. 

Digvijay shot a one-under-par 71 and Ganapathy carded a two-over-par 74. Chirag was the leading amateur, while amateur Himmat Singh Rai finished second, just one stroke behind. 

Uttam Singh Mundy and Amandeep Singh Johl tied for eight place while Rafael Ponce finished the tournament in tenth place. (PTI)

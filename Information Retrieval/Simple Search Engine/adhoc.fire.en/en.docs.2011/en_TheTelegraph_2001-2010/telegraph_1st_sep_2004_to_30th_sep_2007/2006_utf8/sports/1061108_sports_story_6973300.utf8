The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Nadal to play in Chennai

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Come January, and Chennai will see Rafael Nadal in action at the ATP meet there. 

The world No. 2 and two-time defending French Open champion will be the main attraction at the $400,000 event to be held from January 1-7. 

Confirming his participation, Nadal said the Chennai meet is a great event where the enthusiasm of the crowds is very encouraging, according to a press release. 

I was unfortunate to miss the meet last year due to an injury. I cherish my doubles title in Chennai (in 2004) and its a pleasure to be going there again, the Spaniard said. 

Nadal won the doubles in 2004 (when he was just 16) with compatriot Tommy Robredo, but lost to Frenchman Thierry Ascione in the first round of singles. 

He had also confirmed participation for the 2006 edition, but a niggling foot injury forced him to pull out. 

Nadal, the only player who has been able to master Roger Federer so far, handed the world No. 1 his first loss of the year in Dubai.

 AIFF rejects Fransa demand

New Delhi: The All India Football Federation (AIFF) on Tuesday rejected the demand of Fransa Pax for a replay of their controversial match against Mahindra United on January 30 and gave them a 24-hour deadline to retract their withdrawal threat from the 10th National Football League for the ONGC Cup. 

The AIFFs special committee, which met here, issued a deadline to the Goan outfit to convey their regret on the whole episode to the national body by Wednesday evening so that they could be allowed to continue in the championship. 

The emergency committee of the AIFF and NFL rejected the protest of Fransa Pax and asked them to express their regret for total disregard of the NFL regulations. They would also have to withdraw their threat of not taking any further part in the NFL, said AIFF president Priya Ranjan Das Munshi. 

 The Goan outfit lodged a protest with the AIFF asking them to either conduct a replay of the match or split the points with Mahindra. 

Later Fransa did not appear for their match against Air India and also threatened to walk out of the league. 

The matter pertaining to the match between Air India and Fransa Pax and conduct of the club officials of the Goan club shall be disposed by the disciplinary committee by February 9 as per the NFL rules, he said. 

If the club refuses to tow the AIFF line, the committee has authorised the president to take further step in accordance to the rules. (PTI)

 Strauss ready for spin challenge 

 - We were slow to adapt in Pakistan

Mumbai: Opening batsman Andrew Strauss says England have put in the hard hours of practice as they ready themselves for Indias spin threat in the forthcoming Test series. 

There are not many bigger challenges than that, the 28-year-old left-hander told a news conference after the team practice in Mumbai on Thursday. Ive been working hard for a couple of months before coming here, and Ill continue doing that for the next week or two before the first Test. 

England, who won six of their last seven Test series before the 0-2 defeat in Pakistan, are aiming to clinch their first Test series on Indian soil in 21 years. We all struggled a little bit in Pakistan for a number of reasons really, said Strauss who made two centuries in the victorious Ashes campaign last year, but scored just 44 runs in the two Tests he played in Pakistan before leaving for the birth of his child. 

I think we were slow to adapt to the conditions. We have probably learnt our lessons from that a little bit and we are working as hard as possible to make sure that we have as much time out at the nets as possible here. 

The first Test starts in Nagpur on March 1. 

The team had two net sessions at the Cricket Club of India on Thursday ahead of the first warm-up match in Mumbai on Monday. 

The heat is the key here, so we spent a long time out there to adapt to the unique conditions we are going to face, said Strauss, who is yet to face India in Test cricket. 

We roughed up a few of the wickets in the afternoon and it started turning a lot for spinners and thats going to be the key really, to come up with game plans to deal with the ball that is turning prodigiously at some stages during Test matches. 

Strauss was dismissed by Shane Warne on six occasions in the Ashes series, but said he was confident of facing up to the Indian spin duo of Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singh.

Washington: Third-seeded Lleyton Hewitt escaped a near upset against Vince Spadea 6-7 (7-3), 7-6 (7-5), 6-4 and advanced to the third round of the ATP Washington Classic on Wednesday. 

I felt like it was sometimes tougher winning points on my serve than it was on his serve, said Hewitt, the 2004 champion. 

The Australian converted five of 16 break chances, while American Spadea broke four times in six opportunities in the two hour, 32-minute slog. 

Spadea also lost to Hewitt in the first round in Sydney in January. 

I had a lot of chances in that match, and it was a tough three-setter, too, Spadea said. I just havent played a lot of matches. I dont think Im match-fit or match-tough Hewitt looked pretty strong, I know that fitness is one of his best attributes. 

Fifth seed Dominik Hrbaty of Slovakia beat Gilles Muller of Luxembourg 4-6, 6-4, 6-3, while seventh seed Dmitry Tursunov of Russia advanced when Edgardo Massa of Argentina retired with a shoulder injury with the match tied 3-3 in the third set. 

Eighth-seeded Andy Murray of Britain beat Ramon Delgado of Paraguay 6-4, 6-3 and 12th-seeded Feliciano Lopez of Spain downed Teimuraz Gabashvili of Russia 6-4, 6-4. 

After a first-round bye, eighth-seeded Murray hit 13 aces and broke Delgado five times in 100-degree F (38-degree C) heat. 

It was Murrays first match under coach Brad Gilbert, who guided Andre Agassi and Andy Roddick to Grand Slam championships. 

Meanwhile, Leander Paes and Martin Damm of the Czech Republic lost in the first round of the doubles. They lost 3-6, 4-6 to wild cards Delgado and American Rick Leach. (Agencies)

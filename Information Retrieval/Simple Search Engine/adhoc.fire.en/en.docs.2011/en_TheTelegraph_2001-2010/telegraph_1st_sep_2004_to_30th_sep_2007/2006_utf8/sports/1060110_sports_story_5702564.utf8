The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Couldnt have asked for better squad: Inzy

 - Farhat in XV, but Malik remains favourite to open with Butt 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Imran Farhat 

Lahore: The selectors have picked a good squad... Its balanced and, as captain, I couldnt have asked for more, is how Inzamam-ul Haq reacted to the naming of Pakistans XV for the first Test against India. 

Its possible Wasim Bari and Co. would have selected one less, but Imran Farhat had to be rewarded for a century in the tour opener. According to The Telegraphs sources, though, Shoaib Malik remains the favourite to open with Salman Butt. 

Farhat wasnt in the probables list but, as reported in these columns, nothing prevented the selectors from recalling him. His selection, therefore, hasnt come out of the blue. Just as theres no surprise that Asim Kamal, Umar Gul and Rifatullah didnt make it. 

Typhoid ruled out Yasir Hameed. Hes expected to make a quick comeback. 

Apart from allrounder Abdul Razzaq, the squad features four specialist new ball bowlers: Shoaib Akhtar, Mohammed Sami, Rana Naved-ul Hasan and Mohammed Asif. Despite receiving tips from Imran Khan, the experienced Sami is under pressure from Asif. 

Meanwhile, allrounder Azhar Mehmood joined the nets session on Monday. His last Test appearance was as far back as 2001, but the desire to be with apne players drew him to the Gaddafi. 

The current team is doing very well, but I havent given up... Im hopeful of getting recalled... Today, Im waiting for one chance... Ive played in the ODIs till a year ago, but even in the shorter version, I would be in and out... Bus ek chance chahiye, he said, speaking exclusively. 

Mehmood, by the way, has consistently been doing well for Surrey.

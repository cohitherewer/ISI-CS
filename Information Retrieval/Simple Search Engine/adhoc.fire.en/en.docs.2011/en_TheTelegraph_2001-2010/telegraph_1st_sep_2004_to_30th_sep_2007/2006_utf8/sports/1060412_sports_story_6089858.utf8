 Quick Takes

 Germans hoping to clean up Nazi past

 Bad Boll (Germany): Hoping 

 to cleanse themselves of their Nazi past before the World 

 Cup starts, German soccer leaders have broadened their examination 

 of their shameful history in the Third Reich and embraced 

 their critics.

 The German soccer federation (DFB) 

 ? now eager to come to terms with its enthusiastic support 

 of the Nazis during the Hitler era after covering it up 

 for six decades ? has thrown open its soul, and archives, 

 in order to try and purge that nightmarish past.

 In a few weeks well 

 be welcoming the world to Germany and we want to face up 

 to our history, said DFB co-president Theo Zwanziger 

 at a symposium entitled Fussball unterm Hakenkreuz 

 (Soccer under the Swastika).

 Injured Lee may be sidelined

 Seoul: South Korea striker 

 Lee Dong-gook could miss the World Cup finals after tearing 

 knee ligaments, the Korea Football Association (KFA) said 

 on Tuesday. It would be a shattering blow to Lee, who was 

 omitted from South Koreas World Cup squad four years 

 ago by former coach Guus Hiddink.

 Lee Dong-gook tore his right 

 cruciate ligament during a K-League match on April 5, 

 KFA medical chief Yoon Young-seol said.

 South Korea reached the semi-finals 

 of the 2002 World Cup as co-hosts with Japan, but Lee has 

 become a permanent fixture since Hiddinks subsequent 

 departure.

 Shovkovsky boost for Ukraine

 Kiev: Ukraines World 

 Cup hopes were given a boost when first-choice goalkeeper 

 Oleksander Shovkovsky resumed playing at the weekend after 

 almost three months out injured. 

 Shovkovsky, who broke his collarbone 

 in a collision with an opponent during a club friendly in 

 January, helped Dynamo Kiev II to a 2-1 victory over Boryspil 

 Borsfen in the second division. The goal he conceded was 

 a penalty.

 Dynamo Kiev coach Anatoly Demyanenko 

 said Shovkovsky could play a part in the first teams 

 Cup semi-final second leg match against Karpaty Lviv on 

 Wednesday. Dynamo won the opening game 2-0.

 Special series on Cup 

 heroes

 New Delhi: Pele, Diego 

 Maradona, Roberto Baggio, Michel Platini and Franz Beckenbaur 

 are some of the names that immediately come in mind when 

 one thinks of the World Cup heroes. A special series on 

 these legends will be telecast by a television channel to 

 build on the excitement ahead of the Fifa World Cup in Germany 

 in June.

 Titled Born to Play, 

 the 13-episode series will feature some of the greatest 

 soccer players, the channel said in a release.

 Fifa to sue website

 London: Fifa are set for 

 a legal battle with popular internet auction operator eBay 

 after they failed to halt the sale of unofficial World Cup 

 tickets on their website. As revealed by The Daily Telegraph 

 earlier, the government on Monday introduced a change in 

 the law governing the sale of tickets for the World Cup 

 not authorised by Fifa.

 India to play 7 ODIs besides 3 Tests

 - 2007 TOUR OF ENGLAND 

London: India will play three Tests and seven ODIs on their tour of England next year. This is as per the international fixtures for the 2007 English season, released by the ECB on Saturday. 

The West Indies, who will also tour England in the first half of the 2007 summer, will play three Tests, three ODIs and two Twenty20 internationals. 

Indias Tests will be at Lords, Trent Bridge and The Oval. Three of their seven ODIs will be day-night affairs. 

Explaining why England will host seven ODIs against India, ECBs director of cricket operations John Carr said: The ECB and BCCI have had an agreement that Indias tour to the UK would directly reciprocate the three Tests and seven ODIs played by England in India earlier this year.

 The Indian womens 

 Test victory by five wickets in Taunton against England 

 on Friday was only their third win in 34 matches since their 

 debut Test 30 years ago, in October 1976.

 Indias first win came 

 in Patna in November 1976, when they beat the West Indies 

 by five wickets. The second came in Paarl in March 2002 

 against South Africa. India won by 10 wickets.

 Bengal quick Jhulan Goswami 

 became the first Indian woman cricketer to capture 10 wickets 

 in a Test match. She claimed 10 for 78 (5/33 and 5/45) against 

 England in Taunton in the second Test. She thus bettered 

 the previous best match haul by an Indian woman 

 9/90 by Neetu David also against England in Jamshedpur 

 during 1995-96.

 Jhulan, incidentally, 

 became only the 10th bowler in womens Test history 

 to achieve this feat. The list includes four bowlers from 

 Australia, three from England and one each from New Zealand, 

 Pakistan and India.

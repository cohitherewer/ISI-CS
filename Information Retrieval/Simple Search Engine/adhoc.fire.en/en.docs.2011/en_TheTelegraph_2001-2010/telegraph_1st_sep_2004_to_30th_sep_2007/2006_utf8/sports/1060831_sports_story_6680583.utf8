Cardiff: England got off to a shaky start against Pakistan in the first of the five one-day Internationals Wednesday, all out for 202 after being sent in to bat at Sophia Gardens. 

Pakistan fast bowlers Mohammed Asif and Shoaib Akhtar took a combined six wickets as England, having lost 0-5 to Sri Lanka in the one-day series earlier this year, failed to start strongly once again. 

Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq won the toss and decided to field with Englands only change from its five-wicket loss in Mondays Twenty20 match was allrounder Rikki Clarke replacing Michael Yardy. 

Asifs pace saw England openers Andrew Strauss (2) and Marcus Trescothick (16) caught after just 41 balls to leave the hosts 35 for two. 

Captain Strauss took over three overs for his score. 

By the time Asif had dismissed Kevin Pietersen for 2, England were 51 for three inside 14 overs with the fast bowler having figures of three for 12 from 26 balls. 

Ian Bell hit 12 fours in a career-high 88 from 117 balls to eclipse the 80 he scored against Ireland in June. 

Paul Collingwood scored 14 from 29 balls before being caught by wicketkeeper Kamran Akmal who also caught Trescothick from allrounder Shahid Afridi in the 24th over. 

England steadied themselves until the 40th over, when five batsmen fell in four overs. 

Bell was run out by Shahid Afridi, before Shoaib bowled Jamie Dalrymple for 27 on the very next ball. Mohammed Hafeez caught and bowled Chris Read for 0, before Shoaib bowled Sajid Mahmood for 1. 

Darren Gough and Stuart Broad managed 29 runs before the final wicket fell in the 49th over. 

Pakistan conceded 20 extras, including 10 wides. 

The match is Clarkes first one-day International in more than two years and will also mark England fast bowler Darren Goughs 158th appearance. He is Englands most successful one-day bowler, having taken 235 wickets. 

West Indies umpire Billy Doctrove returns for the first time since he and Darrell Hair ruled that Pakistan illegally interfered with the ball on the fourth day of the final Test and imposed a five-run penalty. After the match was forfeited due to a Pakistan protest, England won the series 3-0.

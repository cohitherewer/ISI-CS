The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Chappell pleads for Kaif

 - selectors keep faith in squad which went to abu dhabi 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Calcutta: Greg Chappells plea that Mohammed 

 Kaif be given one more chance helped the out-of-form 

 UP captain keep a place in the squad for the five-match 

 ODI series in the West Indies. 

 Rahul Dravid, too, said much the same thing during 

 Thursday afternoons selection meeting in Mumbai and, 

 so, the Abu Dhabi XV wasnt disturbed. 

The coach and captains stand (at the end of an immensely successful season of limited overs cricket) put paid to whatever little chance Sourav Ganguly had of making a comeback. 

 In any case, as reported by The 

 Telegraph,neither Dravid nor Chappell wanted the former 

 captain back in the dressing room. 

According to sources, Easts Ranjib Biswal called for Kaifs exclusion (on account of form) and the recall of Sourav (experience etc), but received only token support from one colleague ? Norths Bhupinder Singh. 

Even that fizzled out when the others ? Wests Kiran More, Souths V.B. Chandrasekhar and Centrals Sanjay Jagdale ? backed Chappell (and Dravid). 

Singh, one understands, did point out that Kaif had been short on runs ever since his comeback (after injury) against Sri Lanka, in Rajkot last November, but nobody got swayed. 

Clearly, the selectors have set a poor precedent as Kaifs ODI scores in 2006 have been 8, 5 not out, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 5 and 15. 

Worse, he wasnt good enough to play the last three ODIs ? in Indore and twice in Abu Dhabi. 

Chappell and Dravid may have good reasons for backing (actually, shielding) Kaif, but selection must be on form. Exceptions, of course, can be made for somebody of Sachin Tendulkars calibre. 

Had India lost both ODIs in Abu Dhabi, then the coach and captain may have been on less firmer footing. The 1-1 scoreline, however, ensured they would continue to speak in a powerful voice, is how a source put it. 

Its not insignificant that Dravid has himself been performing ? in both forms and in different roles. 

With Sachin expected to be fit for the four-match Test series and V.V.S. Laxman sure to be there for Stage II of the tour, there seems no future for Sourav. 

Apparently, the former captain wasnt absolutely certain of being recalled for the ODIs. Still, he was upset on finding his name missing yet again. 

For one, Sourav didnt take calls. He also didnt reply when one sent an SMS (what now?). 

 Footnote: Board vice-president Dayanand G. Narvekar, 

 who heads the Goa association and is the states health 

 minister, is being considered for the managers 

 post. As is Prof. D. Dongaonkar, secretary-general of the 

 Association of Indian Universities.

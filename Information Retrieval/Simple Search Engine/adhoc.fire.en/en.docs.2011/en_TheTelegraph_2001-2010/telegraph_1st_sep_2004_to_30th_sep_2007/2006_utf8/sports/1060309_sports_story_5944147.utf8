The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 I see Yuvraj as a future India captain, says Intikhab Alam

 - Do away with home advantage, says former Pakistan CAPTAIN and coach 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Intikhab Alam

Chandigarh: Having been exposed to cricket in the region in different capacities, Intikhab Alam has the perfect credentials to talk about whats going on. The former Pakistan captain and coach, currently Punjabs chief coach, spoke to The Telegraph (in neighbouring Mohali) on Wednesday afternoon. 

 The following are excerpts 

 On Indias recent tour of Pakistan 

 Your team finished with more gains... Except the 

 batting in the second innings of the Karachi Test, I dont 

 think India did a thing wrong on the tour... I give full 

 marks to the captain, Rahul Dravid, for leading from the 

 front. Opening is a difficult job, but he did it for the 

 team in the Test series... Dravid was bold and brave in 

 Pakistan. 

 On the wickets offered for 

 the first two Tests (Lahore, Faisalabad) 

 Those Tests were an absolute waste... A waste of 

 energy, waste of money... Such wickets will kill cricket 

 and I refuse to buy the argument that the cold weather affected 

 the preparations... Everyone knows wickets are prepared 

 on the instructions of the Board and the Pakistan team, 

 I think, was afraid of losing... The fear of losing is what 

 led to such meaningless wickets. If that fear is in the 

 system, things go haywire. 

 On what needs to be done to 

 end the preparation of lifeless wickets 

 Either the ICC chooses four of the best curators 

 and makes them work with the local ones to produce standardised 

 wickets or, in my opinion, the ICC should look at doing 

 away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option 

 of batting or fielding... The time has come for radical 

 steps... Do away with the home advantage. 

 On whether overconfidence, 

 after winning the Karachi Test, contributed to Pakistans 

 rout (1-4) in the ODIs 

 Pakistan lost because of poor strategy... I still 

 cant believe that the two best batsmen, Inzy (Inzamam-ul 

 Haq) and Younis Khan, came so low... Younis had to bat at 

 No. 3, followed by the captain, Mohammed Yousuf and the 

 allrounders... The best cant hide or be hidden... 

 The best have to get the maximum overs and Pakistan had 

 the potential to consistently score in excess of 300... 

 Somebody ought to have been held accountable for such bewildering 

 strategy... (After a pause) Shoaib Akhtars 

 absence also made a difference... Even if he doesnt 

 get wickets, his presence adds to the pressure on the opposition... 

 Having said all that, credit to your youngsters for outstanding 

 cricket. 

 On Punjab da puttar Yuvraj 

 Singh being the Man-of-the-Series in the ODIs 

 (Smiles)Wasnt he superb! I worked with him 

 at some length in the last season and noticed his back-and-across 

 shuffle wasnt proper... I suggested he work on that 

 and the results are being seen... Like Inzy, Yuvraj has 

 lots of time to play his shots and his shot-selection has 

 improved tremendously... That hes now a regular in 

 both forms seems to have helped... Hes out of Sourav 

 Gangulys shadow and, therefore, is more comfortable 

 in the mind... That has improved his cricket... I see Yuvraj 

 as a future India captain... He has the qualities and Im 

 going to be surprised if he doesnt get the job. Yuvraj 

 is the type to lead by example. 

 On having worked with one of 

 the great captains ? Imran Khan 

 We were on the same wavelength... He was positive... 

 He was aggressive... At times, though, convincing him would 

 be difficult. 

 On the Mahendra Singh Dhoni-Kamran 

 Akmal rivalry 

 Dhoni has been the find for you... He doesnt 

 succumb to pressure and his body-language is always good... 

 Akmal is a better wicketkeeper, but Dhoni is definitely 

 the more aggressive batsman... Its terrific that the 

 sub-continent has two wicketkeepers who are outstanding 

 batsmen... As somebody from the region, I feel proud... 

 (After a pause) Perhaps, Dhoni needs to adjust a 

 bit while batting in Tests. 

 On the new crop of fast bowlers 

 in India 

 Theyre fine... But, then, youve got 

 to improve the quality of wickets if you want them to improve... 

 To attract fast bowlers, youve got to have wickets 

 which will encourage them... Keep them excited. 

 On the Sourav affair 

 Has been mishandled from the time news of his differences 

 with the coach (Greg Chappell) leaked last September... 

 People have failed on the man-management front... What happens 

 in the dressing room must never come out in the public domain... 

 So many things can go wrong... Individuals may have major 

 differences, but all that isnt ever for public consumption... 

 Woh cricket nahin hai... Controlling difficult 

 situations is a challenge for the management and, in Souravs 

 case, there has been a failure. 

 On whether Sourav should continue 

 in his comeback bid

 Its his call... Nobody has the right to tell 

 anybody that his time is up... As long as Sourav is playing 

 domestic cricket, he stays eligible for selection. 

 On Chappell as coach 

 I dont want to talk about the controversies, 

 but it seems Chappell is clear about what he wants and the 

 direction this Indian team needs to take... At this level, 

 a coach cant do much technically. However, he can 

 make a difference on the mental side... Make the boys tougher... 

 Indeed, more than ability, its the attitude which 

 wins matches. In a way, Chappell is rebuilding the team 

 and thats going to take time. (After a pause) 

 He ought not to have spoken of finances when he talked about 

 Sourav in a recent interview, but has accepted his mistake... 

 Any foreigner, I suppose, takes time to get used to the 

 culture and sensitivities of the subcontinent. 

 On whether he expected England 

 to have the upperhand in the Nagpur Test 

 They deserve the full hundred marks... No captain, 

 no vice-captain and other absentees as well... They had 

 three debutants, but still... 

 On the Mohali Test, which gets 

 underway on Thursday 

 (Smiles again)All five morning sessions will be 

 crucial... India must go with three seamers... 

 On Pakistan appointing former 

 captain Waqar Younis as the bowling coach 

 Quite sensible... Waqar is bound to make it easier 

 for (coach) Bob Woolmer. 

 Finally, on whether Mohammed 

 Asif is going to be Pakistans spearhead in the foreseeable 

 future 

 I wouldnt make a hasty comment... Let him 

 first be picked for an entire season... Lets see how 

 he copes with the demands of top-grade cricket week after 

 week... I feel sorry for the fast bowlers... They hardly 

 get the time to rest and recover... Theyve got to 

 manage the body well.

 Mature Brazil held back a few tricks

 Talking Tactics

 PK Banerjee

Brazil came out unscathed from Croatias massive challenge on Tuesday night simply because Parreira realised that playing all-out aggressive football for 90 minutes against a tough, hard-running side could be foolhardy and self-destructive. 

Brazil started off quite like the all-conquering team they are being touted as. Ronaldinho came up with a couple of typically delightful passes, Roberto Carlos and Cafu produced some searing runs down the flanks, Kaka and Emerson looked good as well. Halfway through the opening session, though, Brazil shifted from fourth gear to third. And after Kakas breathtaking goal, they got even more cautious. 

I would say Parreira read the game very astutely and showed maturity in instructing his men not to go hammer and tongs at the Croatian defence, and thus risk injuries. The goal is to win seven matches, not necessarily by big margins every time they take to the field. The opposition has to be sized up and a horses-for-courses policy has to be adopted. I am quite certain the Brazilians didnt disclose all their cards. 

All credit to the Croatians for forcing the world champions to rethink their strategy. After those early minutes when Brazil held sway, Croatia adjusted quickly to make their presence felt in no uncertain manner. Ronaldinho was hounded with multiple challenges. Apart from the full-time marker, at least two more players in the vicinity were pouncing on the Brazilian superstar whenever he received the ball. 

No wonder Ronaldinho was a bit subdued in the second half. Ronaldo, on the other hand, had just one shot, which reminded us of his class. His problem is lack of match-fitness rather than weight. Parreira rightly took him off and introduced Robinho. 

The Croatians combined power with skill ? just like the Czechs ? and managed to stretch the Brazilian defence a number of times. Had they managed to convert even one of those chances, Brazil would have been forced to revert to their free-flowing, pressing style. That would have been the real test for Ronaldinho amp; Co. 

Dado Prso was most impressive. The pony-tailed striker was all over the field, looking for goals one moment and falling back to defend the next. Robert Kovac was rock solid in defence, Dario Simic marshalled the midfield efficiently. The others gave their 100 per cent as well. If Croatia can maintain this form, I can see them advancing to the second round beating Japan and Australia. 

I am not too worried about the Brazilian defence. They were tested, but gave a good account of themselves. Lucio effected some good, timely tackles, Juan looked quite secure too. The ageing Cafu looked a tad slower than usual and he has to make sure he retreats from his overlaps in time to protect his own citadel. The Croatians broke through Cafus side more than once and Parreira would have taken note of this. 

But how can you criticise Cafus attacking instincts when he provided the crucial ball for Kaka to score just before half-time? The handsome AC Milan star took the ball on his right foot, shifted it to his left and fired a blinder into the top far corner of the net. 

Known for his shooting skill with his right foot, Kaka displayed variety and caught the Croatian defence napping with a gem of a left-footer. 

Brazilian fans need not despair just because their team won by a slender margin. Even on a day when they had to compromise with their natural game and play percentage football, Brazil showed enough firepower to keep the rival camps worried.

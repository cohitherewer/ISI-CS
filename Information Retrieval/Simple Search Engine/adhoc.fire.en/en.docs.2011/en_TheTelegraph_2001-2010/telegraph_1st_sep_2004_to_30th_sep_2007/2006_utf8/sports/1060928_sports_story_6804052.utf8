 Jharkhand bow out 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Faridabad: After dishing out some good football in the first two matches, Jharkhand finally succumbed to the might of Tamil Nadu to bow out of the Santosh Trophy at the Sector 12 Stadium here on Wednesday. 

In a keenly contested Cluster VIII match, Tamil Nadu won 2-1 to enter the pre-quarter finals and set up a date with Delhi on Saturday for a place in the quarter final league to be played next month. 

Placed in a must-win position, Jharkhand began on a positive note, taking the fight to the rival camp on a number of occasions. But Tamil Nadu, aided by their two Mohammedan Sporting strikers, Kalia Kulothungan and Raman Vijayan, looked much sharper than the rival defence. 

Once Kulothungan put Tamil Nadu in the lead in the 27th minute with a deft placement, Jharkhand seemed to have lost the rhythm. 

They did manage to make a few raids in the rival area only to get thwarted on the top of the box. Tamil Nadu, on the other hand, came close to scoring at least twice in the first half. Raman Vijayan failed to capitalise on the chances on both the occasions.

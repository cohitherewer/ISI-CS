 Fifa defends Materazzi ban

 Materazzi 

London: Fifa on Friday defended its decision to ban Italy defender Marco Materazzi for insulting Zinedine Zidane in the World Cup final. 

Materazzi was handed a two-match suspension and a 3,100-euro fine by a Fifa disciplinary committee. The punishment caused outrage in Italy with newspapers describing it as scandalous and that Zidanes 3-match suspension was too low a punishment for Zizou. 

Italys sports minister Giovanna Melandri said the fact that Fifa president Sepp Blatter had not taken part in the final award ceremony, was also a sign of anti-Italian feelings within world soccers governing body.

I understand those who saw the award ceremony and yesterdays verdict and think that there is a discriminatory attitude torwards Italy, Melandri told a news conference, adding however that the Rome government accepted Fifas decision. Lawmakers from the Green party, part of Prime Minister Romano Prodis centre-left coalition, said Prodi and Melandri will have to explain in parliament what they intend to do to protect the image of Italian football. 

There is a clear disproportion between the punishment given to Materazzi and the one given to Zidane. Fifa has set a very dangerous precedent. From now on everybody will feel authorised to react violently to an insult, said one of the lawmakers, Tommaso Pellegrino. (Agencies)

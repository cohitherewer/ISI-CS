 Ref banned for 8 more months

Rome: Referee Gianluca Paparesta received an eight-month ban from the Italian referees association on Tuesday for his role in the countrys match-fixing scandal. 

Paparesta is already serving a three-month ban handed out by a sports tribunal in July. The eight-month ban will therefore begin on October 20 and run until June 19, 2007. 

Paparesta was punished for alleged illicit contact with AC Milan official Leonardo Meani. When the scandal broke last season, Paparesta acknowledged being locked up in a locker room by then Juventus general manager Luciano Moggi, for failing to assure the clubs victory in a game in the 2004-05 season.

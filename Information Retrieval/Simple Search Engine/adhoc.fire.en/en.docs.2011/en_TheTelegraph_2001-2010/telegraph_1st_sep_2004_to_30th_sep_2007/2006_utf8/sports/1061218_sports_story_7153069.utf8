 Kallis in anthem controversy

 - I havent given the issue any thought... I dont know, perhaps I wouldve joined in the singing, says Wessels 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Jacques Kallis 

Johannesburg: South African vice-captain Jacques Kallis, who has led in the past, has been caught in a controversy over not singing the national anthem when its played before international matches. 

While the seeds were sown with a reader of the Sunday Times wanting to know why he didnt join in the singing, Kallis reply (via email) has set the cat among the pigeons. The reader had asked whether Kallis reasons were because he either looked at himself as indispensable or that he was anti new South Africa. 

According to the page 1 report, Kallis said: It is my choice whether I sing or do not sing the anthem. I certainly do not have to explain my reasons to anyone, especially you. I do have good and valid personal reasons and I intend to keep it that way. 

With an undercurrent of tension between Whites and non-Whites, Kallis response may open a much wider debate and embarrass Cricket South Africa (CSA) and the government of the day. 

For its part, CSA has announced it will have a discussion with him after the first Test against India. The newspaper quoted chief executive Gerald Majola as saying the CSA insists that players sing the anthem. 

The reasons include nation-building and that it was a bridge between the players and the spectators, unifying their support of their nation and of each other. Majolas claim is that the reasons have been explained and nobody has requested that he be allowed not to sing. 

On Sunday afternoon, The Telegraph spoke to three former South African cricketers the legendary Barry Richards, one-time captain Kepler Wessels and Omar Henry, acknowledged as the first non-White to play for the country. 

Their views are as follows (alphabetically): 

Henry: Different people have different ways of showing respect... I mean, quite a few sportsmen just place their right hand over the heart... However, the issue couldve been better handled... Kallis need not have reacted the way he did and CSA shouldve settled it internally... Theres a lesson to be learnt. In any case, my view is that there are far more important issues which need to be addressed. 

Richards: I havent read the story, but Kallis is being paid to deliver as a cricketer and hes doing that... I dont go around telling people Im a Christian, but that doesnt mean Im not one... Surely, I dont have to attend church every Sunday to show the world that Im a Christian... 

Wessels: The anthem wouldnt be played in my time... I havent given the issue any thought... I dont know, perhaps I wouldve joined in the singing. 

Footnote: Meanwhile, 20-year-old Miss South Africa contestant Catherine Reiters from capital Pretoria is in the midst of an entirely different controversy. Shes in the headlines for having worn a flaming red gown which revealed too much. She didnt win the crown, but made bigger news than the winner. Newspapers have quoted her as saying: I personally think that there were other dresses which were more low-cut. It was more the size of my breasts that was the issue...

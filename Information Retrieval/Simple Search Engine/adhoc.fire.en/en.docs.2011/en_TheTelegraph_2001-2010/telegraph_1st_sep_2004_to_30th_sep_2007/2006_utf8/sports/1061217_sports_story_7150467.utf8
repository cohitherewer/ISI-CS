 Sreesanth owes it to Allan Donald

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Johannesburg: Young Sreesanth, who recorded career-best figures (five for 40) in the first innings of the opening Test, thanked South African icon Allan Donald for offering the most helpful tips. 

This morning, I got the courage to go up to him and speak a few words... Dennis Lillee is my idol, but I grew up watching Donald on the TV... Hes my dream bowler... He asked me to stick to the basics and not try too hard... That I should aim to only bowl in the right areas... It helped, Sreesanth revealed on Saturday evening. 

He acknowledged that overcast conditions at the start of South Africas innings helped and accepted hed begun to stray after taking three wickets. My teammates told me not to try too hard and it worked... Their encouragement took me to five wickets... Its important to bowl the right length and stay patient. 

Sreesanth, who has the habit of visualising the wicket on match-eve, added: We arent looking back on the past and the mood is positive... Were enjoying ourselves and, so, the (0-4) defeat in the ODIs isnt on our minds... 

Interacting briefly with The Telegraph, Sreesanth said he dedicated his performance to all Indians. He continued: Weve never won a Test in South Africa... So, it will be great if what Ive done helps...

 Gambhir falls for a blob

New Delhi: Debutants hogged the limelight on the second day even as Tamil Nadu gained control of their Ranji Trophy Super League match against Delhi at the Kotla here Friday. 

Wicketkeeper-batsman Vikram Mani struck a valuable half-century that ensured Tamil Nadu reach 347 before India under-19 seamer Yomahesh picked up the crucial wicket of opener Aakash Chopra (4) in the final session. 

Together with the dismissal of Gautam Gambhir for nought, it meant Delhi were precariously placed at 54 for two at close, 293 runs in arrears. 

In Ahmedabad, Gujarat hit back to reduce Rajasthan to 134 for five in the second innings and give themselves an outside chance of a victory at the Motera. 

After being bowled out for 128 and conceding a lead of 76 runs, the hosts fought their way back into the match with Timil Patel grabbing three for 27. 

At stumps on the second day, Rajasthan had an overall lead of 210 with veterans Gagan Khoda unbeaten on 68 and Ajay Jadeja batting on 11.

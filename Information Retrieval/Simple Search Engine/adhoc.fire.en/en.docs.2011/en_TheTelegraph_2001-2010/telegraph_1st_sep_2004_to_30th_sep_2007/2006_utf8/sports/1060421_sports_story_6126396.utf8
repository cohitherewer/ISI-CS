 Yakubu strike a blow for EB

 -National League

 -Mahindra close gap

 Bhaichung's efforts went in vain

Mumbai: Yusif Yakubu halted East Bengals five-match winning run, helping Mahindra United close the gap with frontrunners East Bengal in the 44th National Football League for the ONGC Cup at the Cooperage on Thursday. 

The 1-0 victory took Mahindras tally to 26 from 12 ties, just behind the red-and-golds 27 from 13 outings. If Mahindra beat Sporting Clube de Goa on April 28, they will move atop the table. Federation Cup winners Mahindra dominated the clash of the top two teams and got the match-winner via a penalty converted by Yusif Yakubu in the first-half stoppage time. 

The spot-kick was awarded to the local outfit when Malsawmtluanga fisted the ball while going for an aerial duel with Yakubu. He, surprisingly, was not booked for the offence. 

Just prior to the goal, East Bengal captain Bhaichung Bhutia had a good chance to put his team in the lead but delayed in taking the shot off a long clearance and Mahindra defender Mahesh Gawli cleared it. 

Soon afterwards Bhaichung again dodged two defenders to lay a fine pass, which was, however, booted wide of the target by Ndem Guy Herve. 

As the match wore on, Mahindra, however, started taking control and could have gone ahead but for East Bengal custodian Naseem Akhtar staving off a stiff shot from Yakubu off a forward pass from K. Ajayan. 

Six minutes later Rauf Khan missed an open goal off a Yakubu through after the latter got a cross from Steven Dias. (PTI)

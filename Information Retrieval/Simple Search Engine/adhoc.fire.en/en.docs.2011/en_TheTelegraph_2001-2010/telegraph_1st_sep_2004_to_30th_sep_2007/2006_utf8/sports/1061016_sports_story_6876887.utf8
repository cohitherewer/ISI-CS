 ICC like East India Co. 

Jaipur: Sharad Pawar on Sunday endorsed the view expressed by BCCI officials that the ICC was behaving like the East India Company. That is the general feeling prevailing in countries like India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, the BCCI president said. Pawar reiterated that India would not sign the MPA in its present form, but did not foresee the issue preventing the country from taking part in future World Cups and other ICC events. We wont sign the MPA in its current form. If we sign, it will harm the players. Pawar said.

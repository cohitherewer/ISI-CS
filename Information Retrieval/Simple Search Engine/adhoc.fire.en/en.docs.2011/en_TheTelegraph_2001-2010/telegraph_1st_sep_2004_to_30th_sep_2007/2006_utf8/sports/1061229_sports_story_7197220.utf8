 WADA wants Pak pacers suspended

Karachi: A top official of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) has asked the Pakistan Cricket Board to immediately suspend fast bowlers Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Asif from playing in national or international competitions. 

PCB should conduct fresh dope tests of the two bowlers and until a decision is reached by WADA on the issue, both players should be suspended from playing national or international cricket, Dr Waqar Ahmed, WADAs representative in Pakistan, told a news channel Thursday.It would be best for both players if they were stopped playing until the traces of nandrolone were gone from their bodies, Ahmed said. 

 Woolmer praise 

Pakistan Coach Bob Woolmer has said the first Test win by India in Johannesburg was a good example for his side as it exposed the South African teams frailties and proved that they could be beaten at home. 

The result in Johannesburg is a good example since it shows South Africans can be bowled out and secondly they can be beaten at home, Woolmer said. (PTI)

 Rasalas joins Aperitivos league 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta:Trainer Daniel Davids Rasalas ran the race of his life on Monday to share the 2,000m Indian Champion Cup with the 7-10 favourite Aperitivo. It was a fast-run race, which helped the duo eclipse the course-record over the trip held by Accuser since 2004.

 The victory of the four-year-old also justified the importance of the event framed about half-a-century ago to gauge the quality and improvement of successive generations. Aperitivo, a Vijay Singh-trainee, is one of the top-rated horses in the country. He had won the Derby last winter, while Rasalas was a poor third in this seasons mega Classic. Therefore, the Champion Cup results have not only put Rasalas in the elite group, but also enhanced ratings of those who finished ahead of him in the Derby held earlier this month.

 The afternoon also witnessed a scintillating performance from Vijays three-year-old champion colt, Ardelis, who claimed the Indian Champagne Stakes the way he liked. C.Alford partnered both, Aperitivo and Ardelis, while Imran Chisty guided Rasalas to victory.

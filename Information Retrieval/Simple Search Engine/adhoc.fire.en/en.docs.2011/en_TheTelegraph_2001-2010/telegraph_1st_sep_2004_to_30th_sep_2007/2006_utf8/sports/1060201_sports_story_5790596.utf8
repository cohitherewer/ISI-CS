 Karol Beck tests positive

Bratislava: Slovak tennis player Karol Beck has tested positive for a banned substance, Slovak Tennis Federation General Secretary Igor Moska said on Tuesday. 

Moska said the positive test came last year, but he did not say which substance was involved nor give any other details. 

I have known about this for quite some time. I believe the substance was taken unknowingly, he said. We have not yet received an official notification, but we are expecting to receive it later today or tomorrow. 

The International Tennis Federation declined to comment on the report. 

Beck faces a two-year ban if the test is confirmed. 

During the Davis Cup final in December between Slovakia and Croatia, Beck had vehemently denied failing a dope test after rumours circulated he had given a positive test in the Cup semi-final against Argentina. 

Slovak captain Miroslav Mecir decided to hold Beck out of the competition, citing at the time the lingering effects of a knee injury and saying the rumours surrounding Beck were an unfortunate distraction. 

Beck was ranked 57 at the time of the Davis Cup final, which Slovakia lost 3-2, and is now ranked 76. He has not played in 2006. 

Last month, Argentinas Mariano Puerta received an eight-year doping ban from the ITF. He is appealing to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). 

Earlier this month, 16-year-old Bulgarian player Sesil Karatantcheva was banned for two years for a steroid violation. She also plans to appeal.

 Credit for turning ODI series goes to Dravid

 Captain's Corner

 Inzamam-ul-Haq

I start my wrap-up column by congratulating the Pakistan U-19 team for making history by becoming the first team to retain the World Cup. It was a performance that brought a few smiles back to our faces after our below-par performance against India in the one-day series in general and the last game in particular. 

The way the boys crawled their way from the depths of despair is a lesson for everyone. They reminded us that any score is defendable if the desire for glory, zest, commitment and passion is there. Their achievement once again proves that there is no dearth of talent in our part of the world despite our limited resources, inadequate facilities and infrastructure. 

We have and will continue to stun the world by producing high quality and exceptionally talented cricketers out of nowhere. Well done boys. We are proud of you! 

As regards the one-day series, I have no hesitation in admitting that India were the worthy winners. They were outstanding in every department of the game and we just could not match them. Every time we tried to compete against them, they came up with something different, and we found them too far to catch up with. 

To me, it has been one of the most amazing series comebacks by the Indians after we had snatched victory from the jaws of defeat in the Karachi Test and then made the 328-run target in Peshawar look small. The credit for turning the series on its head must go to Rahul Dravid. 

I believe the major difference between the two teams was fielding. We were poor at times and atrocious most of the times. So much so, that when our pride was at stake in Karachi, we showed too much generosity by conceding plenty of boundaries through misfields or over-throws, failed to convert half-chances, and could not even throw down the stumps from point-blank range. 

On the contrary, the Indians were sharp and athletic on the field throughout the series. They had already raised their fielding standards through the agile and acrobatic Yuvraj Singh and Mohammed Kaif, with Irfan Pathan, Sachin Tendulkar and Dravid there for support. But the way the young trio of Suresh Raina, Rudra Pratap Singh and Sreesanth responded was incredible, and helped make the Indian team look a tremendously good fielding side. 

In the subcontinent, where you get wickets tailor-made for batsmen and quick outfields, you need be to an excellent fielding side to back your bowlers to stand any chance of winning important matches. Sadly, we were no match for India in that decisive department. 

Although our batting and bowling is being bitterly criticised, I believe despite regular top order failures, we managed to post decent scores in four of the five games and also succeeded in picking up a couple of early wickets in almost every game. But our fielding let us down and in the end helped the critics portray a horrifying picture of the Pakistan team.

To me, the turning point of the one-day series was the first hour of the Rawalpindi one-dayer where we lost four quick wickets. Then the Indian fielders compounded our problems by getting four run-outs that prevented us from reaching 300. 

The positives I take from this defeat are that we know where we lack and how we need to improve. This series has been a huge learning curve for all of us, and I am confident that we will improve with sheer hard work, dedication and commitment. 

I hate to give excuses, but just want to remind the critics that we played six Tests and 10 one-dayers in less than four months, which, I think, was extremely taxing and strenuous for the players. 

The so-called experts of the game have been critical of my captaincy, want me to bat up the order and accuse me of shuffling the batting order too much. I think this is the best time to put the record straight. 

Firstly, I dont have any defensive mindset. Its just that I dont show my aggression on the field. I am not one of those captains who throw their hands here and there, shout at players or put hands on the hips in anger. My aggression is always in my mind, not in actions and my team knows that. 

As regards my batting position, the critics unfortunately dont do their homework when they come on the screens. So, let me show them the factual position. In 356 one-dayers, I have batted 69 times at No. 3 (average 39), 145 times at No. 4 (average 40) and 91 times at No. 5 (average 42). 

They further accuse me of shuffling the batting order. Well, we stuck to the same batting order that we had followed in the previous series. Kamran Akmal, as an opener, was declared the Man-of-the-Series against England, while Shoaib Malik struggled at No. 3 against England but was persisted at the same position against India. The rest of the middle order remained unchanged. 

The critics and the followers of the game need to understand that no captain wants to see his team lose. Every captain tries his best within his means and resources. What also needs to be understood is that the other team also takes the field with the ambition to win and not to award you matches on a silver platter. 

We should be graceful in defeat and accept wholeheartedly that in this particular series, India were head and shoulders above us. (PTI)

 Randhawa in bike mishap 

Doha: Jyoti Randhawas love for bikes once again landed him in hospital, but the champion golfer was fine and hoping to be ready for the two-million-dollar Commercial Bank Qatar Masters starting here on Thursday. 

Coming fresh from a superb sixth place finish in Abu Dhabi at the weekend, the former Asian Tour No. 1 took time off on Monday to enjoy a safari romp but bruised his left forearm and ribs after falling off from a four-wheel bike. 

Randhawa took Tuesday off to rest his sore muscles and is optimistic of fully recovering to challenge the likes of defending champion Ernie Els, Vijai Singh, Darren Clarke and Thomas Bjorn in the Qatar Masters. I was trying to come off a sand dune and gassed it too soon and fell off. 

Randhawa was involved in a more serious road mishap in 2002 when he, driving a 1000cc bike in New Delhi, met with an accident and ended up with a serious fracture. (PTI)

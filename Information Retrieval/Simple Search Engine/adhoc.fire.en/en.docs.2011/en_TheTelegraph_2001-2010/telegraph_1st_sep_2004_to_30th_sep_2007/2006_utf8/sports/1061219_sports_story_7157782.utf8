Calcutta: N.P. Pradeep brought relief to Mahindra United late in the second session as they moved into the quarter finals of the 28th Peerless Federation Cup on Monday. 

The Mumbai side was done in by some brilliant goalkeeping till the 79th minute, first by Shibram Dey and then Pralay Dutta, till Pradeep found the target through a header following a Steven Dias corner. 

Chirag United SC were left to defend for most of the match as the IFA Shield champions rode roughshod over the opponents. The Manjit Singh-Yusif Yakubu-Mohammed Rafi trio combined well to expose the limitations of the home team time and again only to be thwarted by a superb Pralay. 

It could have easily been a 4-0 or 5-0 margin in Mahindras favour but their forwards squandered opportunities at will even as Amal Duttas side put up an inspiring performance. 

Yakubu shot straight into Pralay from handshaking distance, Manjit was wayward from top of the box, Surkumar Singhs shot was fisted away and K. Ajayans shot hit the crosspiece. 

An injured Shibram was forced to be replaced by Pralay in the 38th minute but that didnt change Mahindras fortunes. The substitute goalie was equally adept at keeping Mahindras offensive at bay. 

United SC hardly made any move except for once in the first session when Theodore Sunday Wrobeh nicely shielded two defenders inside the box before failing to control his volley. 

Despite managing a solitary-goal win, Mahindra impressed with their quick interchange of position and superb distribution that often had the rival team in disarray. They never let their frustration at not failing to find the target get the better of them. In the end, their professional approach paid dividends.

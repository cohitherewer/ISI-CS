The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Batting failure a cause for worry

 Venkatapathi Raju 

One-time left-arm spinner Venkatapathi Muscles Raju (93 wickets in Tests and 63 in ODIs), Souths new man on the senior national selection committee, briefly spoke to The Telegraph over the phone from Hyderabad. At 37, he has to be among the youngest of selectors. Here goes: 

On his appointment 

Im happy... Id recently been made chairman of the Hyderabad selection committee... Ill quickly learn the ropes... 

On his priority 

Batting is our strength, but the batsmen just didnt do well in the last tournament (tri-series in Kuala Lumpur). So, that needs to be quickly looked into. Also, generally, I feel the top players must play more of domestic cricket. 

Lastly, on whether the selectors are also going to be under pressure 

Yes, indeed... After all, this is the season of the World Cup and expectations will be sky high...

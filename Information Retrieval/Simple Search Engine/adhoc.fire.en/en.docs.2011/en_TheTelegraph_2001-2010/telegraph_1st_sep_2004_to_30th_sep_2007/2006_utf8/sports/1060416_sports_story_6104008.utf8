 Maiden title for Shamim

New Delhi: Shamim Khan registered his maiden title on the Amby Valley PGAI Tour as Vinod Kumar fell victim to the notorious Delhi Golf Club bushes in the 36-hole final of the Rs 12 lakh SRF All India Matchplay Championship here on Saturday. 

Shamim triumphed 3 and 2 and pocketed Rs 2,57,200, while Vinod took home Rs 1,25,000. 

In the clash for the third position, second seed Vijay Kumar beat top-seed Mukesh Kumar 2-up. Vijay and Mukesh earned Rs 75,000 and Rs 46,000, respectively. 

Shamim was 2-up at the halfway stage but found the rough with a driver, four-iron combination at the par-five first hole (19th of the contest). The subsequent bogey saw Vinod reduce the score-line to 1-up. (PTI)

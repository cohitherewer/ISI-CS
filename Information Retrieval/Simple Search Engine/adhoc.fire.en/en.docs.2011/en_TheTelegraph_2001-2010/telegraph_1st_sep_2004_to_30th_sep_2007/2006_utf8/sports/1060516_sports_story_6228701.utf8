London: Barcelona began the European Champions League as the favourites and enter Wednesdays final against Arsenal as an even bigger tip to win. 

Even arsenal dont dispute it. 

Barcelona are the super-favourites, and we are the dangerous outsiders, manager Arsene Wenger said. I feel that if we play our natural game we are a super-dangerous outsiders. 

Arsenals natural game hasnt always been on show, however. 

A midseason slump cost Arsenal from challenging for the Premier League title, and the Gunners had to wait until the final day of the English season on May 6 to scrape into fourth place in the standings to secure a place in next seasons Champions League. 

We were out of the championship race very early, and may be subconsciously we have chosen this competition, Wenger said. 

Meanwhile, Barcelona cruised to their 18th Spanish title with three games remaining, enhancing the bookies decision to make Barcelona the 1-2 favourites to win a second European Cup title at Stade de France outside Paris. 

Barcelonas former Arsenal defender Giovanni van Bronckhorst said the final will be unusual because of the way both clubs played. 

This final will be something of a one-off because normally you have teams that play a bit defensively, but you will see two teams that like to attack and so it should be a very attractive final, Van Bronckhorst said. 

Two of the worlds best forwards have heightened the anticipation ? Barcelonas Ronaldinho and Arsenals Thierry Henry, who will also lead Brazil and France, respectively at next months World Cup. 

Ronaldinho has done his best to dampen one-on-one expectations. 

This final isnt a Henry-Ronaldinho duel, said the 2002 Brazilian World Cup winner and two-time World Player of the Year. It will be a great game between two teams that play on the attack. The team which is more accurate will win. 

Were all 100 per cent, all very motivated, and I can only imagine good things in Paris. Pressure? Im not thinking about pressure, all about good soccer. 

Meanwhile, Argentina forward Lionel Messi has been included in Barcelonas 22-man squad for final despite not playing for more than two months. 

The 18-year-old trained with the team on Monday but has not been given the all-clear to play by club medical staff. 

It is expected that a decision about his inclusion in the team for the final will be made after Barcelona train at the Stade de France on Tuesday. Messi tore a thigh muscle during the second leg of his sides Champions League knockout tie against Chelsea on March 7. 

 The fact that Messi will 

 be with us will make us stronger but we dont know 

 if he will play in the final, Barcelona midfielder 

 Deco told a news conference at the Nou Camp. (Agencies)

 Draw dents Indias chances 

 - Improvement of Test Ranking

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta: Indias failure to take the last West Indies wicket and win the first Test in Antigua means it cannot now overtake England and move into second place in the ICC Test Championship table ? at least for the time being. 

According to a ICC release, a clean sweep of the four-match series would have taken India to 112 rating points, the same as England, but Rahul Dravids side would have moved into second spot when the ratings were re-calculated to three decimal places. 

However, the inability to break the resistance of last West Indies pair of Fidel Edwards and Corey Collymore on Tuesday means that, even if India win the remaining matches of the series to secure a 3-0 success, it cannot improve on its current rating of 111 points. 

 Wasim Jaffer, who hit his maiden double hundred in 

 second innings, has jumped 29 places to be in 55th spot 

 in the ICC player rankings for Test batsmen.

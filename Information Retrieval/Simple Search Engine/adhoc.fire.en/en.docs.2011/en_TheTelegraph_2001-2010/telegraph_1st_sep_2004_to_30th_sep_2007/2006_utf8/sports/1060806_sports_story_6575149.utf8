 RCTC, bookies settle dispute 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Bookmakers have 

 decided to go hand-in-hand with the RCTC after the stewards 

 gave them a good hearing on Wednesday and again on Friday. 

 The quit threat stands withdrawn now; said Dipten 

 Banerjee, secretary, Calcutta Bookmakers Association (CBA). 

 In view of the crisis at the club, we have decided 

 to cooperate with them, he added.

 Bookies had set Sunday as a deadline if the club did not sort out the issue pertaining to the Amusement Tax dues for which the CBA refused to own up the liability. Bookies arrears were understood to be close to Rs 4 crore but bookies claim they owe the RCTC and the Tax department nothing. The arrears RCTC and the Tax department have been talking about are clubs own doing. We have been paying taxes regularly and also on time; said another bookmaker.

 RCTC officials and stewards were not available for comment.

 Germany drub Ecuador 3-0 

Berlin: Miroslav Klose scored two goals on Tuesday to help Germany to a 3-0 win over Ecuador and first place in Group A of the World Cup. 

 Lukas Podolski also scored for Germany, who have nine points from their three group matches and will face the runner-up from Group B in the second round on Saturday in Munich. 

 The last time Germany won their first three matches at a World Cup was in 1970 in Mexico. Both teams were sure of advancing to the second round even before kick-off. 

 Ecuador will face the winner of Group B on Sunday in Stuttgart. 

 Our goal was to win the group and we achieved it, coach Juergen Klinsmann said. We are looking forward to the knockout stage. Our strikers are in really good shape, they are working hard and scoring. But it will be more difficult to score in later rounds so they will have to work even harder. 

 Germanys once vulnerable defence has not conceded a goal in two straight games. 

 Klose, who has scored nine World Cup goals, finished strong German pressure early in the match when he scored in the fourth minute. 

After a German corner, the Ecuadorean defence could not clear the ball away from its half and it was sent back to defender Per Mertesacker, who flicked it over to the far post. Bastian Schweinsteiger crossed it back onto the path of Klose, who drove it inside the far post. 

Klose celebrated with his trademark somersault, a gesture he says is reserved for important goals in big games. 

 The striker had several other shots on goal and another attempt stopped by Ecuador goalkeeper Cristian Mora. 

 By then, the early pace had considerably slackened and even the capacity crowd appeared to slumber in the afternoon heat. Then, the Germans came alive again. Captain Michael Ballack chipped a pass to the edge of the Ecuador box, Klose shook off two defenders, rounded Mora and coolly slotted home.

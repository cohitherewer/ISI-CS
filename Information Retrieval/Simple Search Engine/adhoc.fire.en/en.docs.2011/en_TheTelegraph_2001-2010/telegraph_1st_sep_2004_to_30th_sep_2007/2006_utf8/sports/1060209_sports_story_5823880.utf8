 Pakistan announce 20-member squad

Karachi: The temperamental Mohammed Saqlain was on Wednesday retained as the captain of a 20-member squad named for the six-match hockey series against India starting later this month. 

The team was announced by chief selector and former captain Chaudhry Akhtar Rasool in the presence of Pakistan Hockey Federation (PHF) secretary Brigadier Musarratullah Khan, coach Asif Bajwa and manager Saeed Khan after the conclusion of two-day trials in Islamabad. 

Saqlain had escaped with a three-match ban for rough tackle against a German player during the Hamburg four-nation tournament last year. The player has a history of indiscipline, and was also left out of the Athens Olympics after falling out with the then coach, Dutch Rolant Oltsman. 

Overall, Pakistan made just a few changes to the squad that finished fifth in the Champions Trophy in December last year, leaving out Akhtar Ali and including Mudassar Khan. Shabbir and Mohammed Zubair were added to the squad. 

After the series in India, we will select the best 16 players for the Melbourne Commonwealth Games, Rasool said. 

The series, to be played on home and away basis, will open in Chandigarh where the first two games will be played on February 17 and 18, while the third will be played in Jalandhar on February 20. 

The second half of the series will be hosted by Pakistan at Rawalpindi (February 22), Faisalabad (February 24) and Lahore (February 26).

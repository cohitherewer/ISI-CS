 - Briton to get $1,60,000 per year 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Bob Houghton

New Delhi: British coach Bob Houghton on Thursday was appointed the national coach, according to All India Football Federation (AIFF) sources. The official announcement in this regard is likely to be made on Friday. 

The appointment was confirmed after AIFF president Priya Ranjan Das Munshi met the 58-year-old coach on Thursday evening and gave his nod of approval after consulting the technical committee members. Houghton also had a separate one-hour meeting with the technical committee before leaving for China. 

Houghton, AIFF sources said, will be paid $1,60,000 per year. There is a strong possibility that either Biswajit Bhattacharya or Savio Medeira may be attached to him as assistant coach. 

Earlier, AIFF general secretary Alberto Colaco said that the two other coaches in the fray ? Ian Porterfield of England and Clemence Westerhoff of the Netherlands have contacted the federation and expressed their willingness to come for the interview. 

While former Chelsea coach Porterfield, in a fax message to Colaco, said he could be available on June 3, Westerhoff has requested the AIFF to send him an official invitation. 

Speaking to The Telegraph, Colaco said on Thursday: Porterfield has finally said he is ready to come. But not before June 3. 

As far as Westerhoff is concerned, there was a slight communication gap. His agent (former Nigerian footballer Stephen) requested me to speak to him. When I called him up on Thursday, he sought for an official invitation letter again, which I sent immediately. 

The panel members, however had strongly recommended Houghton. 

 He was not only quite impressive, but seems to have vast experience in working in Asian countries, said a technical committee member. 

Houghton is also believed to have asked for a much lower salary than Kerr. 

Houghton, Colaco said, was not too impressed with Indian teams visit to Canada for a four-nation tournament in July. But he understood it when we told him about our commitments. 

Meanwhile, the Vancouver Whitecaps FC will be organising the first-ever Nations Cup knock-out tournament from July 19 to 23. Other than India, three other teams ? Chinese U20, Cardiff City FC of England and the hosts Vancouver Whitecaps FC will be taking part. 

VANCOUVER MEET SCHEDULE 

19 July: India vs Vancouver Whitecaps FC; July 21: Cardiff City FC vs China U-20; July 23: Third Place Playoff; July 23: Final.

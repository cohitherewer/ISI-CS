 SA mentally frail, says Warne

Durban: Shane Warne described South Africas cricketers on Wednesday as mentally frail with suspect technique. 

The leg-spinner said South Africas performance in the first Test, which Australia won by seven wickets inside three days, did nothing to make him revise his low opinion of the home side. 

The South African team management asked the groundsman in Cape Town to water the pitch in an apparent attempt to negate the threat posed by Warne, who is most lethal on drier surfaces. 

The move backfired when seamer Stuart Clark took nine for 89. You are already winning, arent you, before you even bowl a ball, Warne told a news conference. That just shows you the state of the South African mind. 

If they are telling groundsmen to water it then weve got a psychological advantage straight away. You cant write a better script than that. 

Warne said the Australians would welcome a repetition of South Africas pitch experiment on Durbans traditionally seam-friendly pitch. 

If thats their mindset here, if they want a green thing thats going to seam all around the place ... I think the same result will happen, Warne said. 

South African all rounder Jacques Kallis smiled when told of Warnes assertions. 

The guys realise hes there for entertainment, Kallis said. (Reuters)

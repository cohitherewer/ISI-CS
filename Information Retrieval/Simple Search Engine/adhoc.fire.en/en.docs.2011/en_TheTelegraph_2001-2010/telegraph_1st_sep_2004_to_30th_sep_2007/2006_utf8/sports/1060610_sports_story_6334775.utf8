 Lighter side of Lippi

Duisburg: Italys Marcello Lippi has experienced almost everything top-flight football has to offer but the World Cup is something new for the former Juventus coach and it is bringing out a hidden side of his personality. 

The classic images of the silver-haired Lippi usually feature him with a stern expression as he gives short shrift to questions from journalists or pensively puffs on a cigar while standing on the touchline. 

But in the short time he has been in Germany for the World Cup finals, which for Italy begin on Monday with their Group E match against Ghana, the other side of Lippi has been on show. 

Im feeling really enthusiastic, it is a magical feeling, said the 58-year-old Lippi when asked how he felt after Thursdays first training session at their World Cup base. 

Ive always felt that being a national team coach is a magical thing and Ive never been at a World Cup ? not as a player, a coach or a kit man or as anything. Im feeling really enthusiastic, he added. 

Lippis dry humour was on display during his first news conference when one Italian reporter complained that a photographer, seated in the front row and with a giant Afro style haircut, was obscuring his view.

 Its Sehwag vs Kumble in Bangalore

 - RANJI ROUND-UP 

 Sehwag 

Bangalore: Virender Sehwag-led Delhi take on Karnataka, who have Anil Kumble in their ranks, in a Ranji Trophy elite group A encounter at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium here on Tuesday. 

Both teams are brimming with confidence as they have recorded victories in their last fixtures. 

Delhi derailed defending champions Railways, while the hosts carved out a huge victory over Maharashtra. 

The visitors have six points from five matches and will be looking to boost their tally. Karnataka have eight from identical number of outings. Karnataka captain Sujith Somasundar played it safe, rating Delhi as a very good side. 

In Ahmedabad, wicketkeeper-batsman Parthiv Patel would open the innings for Gujarat in another tie against Mumbai at Motera on Monday, coach Vijay Patel said. 

He is going to Pakistan and this match will provide him with a chance to face quality pace bowling, Vijay said. 

Meanwhile Railways, languishing at the bottom of the table, are praying for better luck in 2006 to avoid relegation as they take on Maharashtra in another group A match here on Monday. 

The prospects of Maharashtra are no less grim and they also have just four points to show for from five outings, with two more rounds to go. 

In another group B encounter a rejuvenated Uttar Pradesh ? with the presence of Mohammed Kaif ? will take on Hyderabad on Monday at the K.D. Singh Babu Stadium. (PTI)

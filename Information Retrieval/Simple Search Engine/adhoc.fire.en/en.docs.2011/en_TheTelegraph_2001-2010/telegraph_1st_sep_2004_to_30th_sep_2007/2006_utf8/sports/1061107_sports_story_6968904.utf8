The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 EB cautious, but confident

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: East Bengal have slipped into a cautious mode on the eve of their final CFL Premier Division match against Eastern Railway. 

East Bengal (with 29 points) need to beat Eastern Railway to be certain of claiming the title on Tuesday. Mohun Bagan (27) will pip them to the crown if they win their final game versus United SC and, also, East Bengal lose theirs. 

East Bengal (19-5) have a better goal-difference than their rivals (18-8). So the red-and-golds will be through even if they draw, provided Mohun Bagan dont win by a five-goal margin. 

East Bengal coach Carlos Roberto Pereira, however, was confident that his team wouldnt tumble in the final hurdle. Its always a nice feeling going into the match that you win and emerge champions at the home ground, the Brazilian said. 

However, its the scoring deficiency by his forwards, which is worrying the coach most. Understandably, he made his wards go through shooting practice session for a long time on the match-eve. 

Alvito DCunha, who is available for the match after his suspension got over, and Sasthi Duley, who has had a mild fever, didnt practise. 

East Bengal, however, will miss the services of Syed Rahim Nabi, Saumik Dey and Anupam Sarkar, who have joined the national camp in Goa for the Asian Cup qualifier versus Yemen. 

Meanwhile, East Bengal will play a benefit match against an IFA XI on Saturday. The proceeds will go to former international Sudhir Karmakar.

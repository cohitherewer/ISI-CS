Durban: India were faced with a Herculean task of preventing South Africa from recording a series levelling victory in the second Test which was heavily loaded in favour of the home team here on Friday. 

Chasing a stiff target of 354 for victory, India were precariously placed at 38 for two with Virender Sehwag (8) and Rahul Dravid (11) being sent back to the hut when play was called off early due to bad light again on the Day IV. 

India would now have to bat out the entire fifth day on a last day Kingsmead wicket but the weather could come to the rescue of the visitors as overcast conditions have led to early closure of play on all the four days. 

The target appears all the more daunting with the Indians having not scored more than 250 runs in any of the innings in the three-match series so far, a factor which must have been taken into account when Graeme Smith declared tat 265 for eight, about one hour before the tea break. 

The Indians plunged into trouble early with Sehwag perishing cheaply yet again to an away going delivery while it was the prized scalp of Dravid immediately after the tea break which put the visitors completely on the backfoot. 

Dravid, who has the temperament to play a long innings and hold one end up, was caught behind off Makhaya Ntini (2/14) who had also accounted for Sehwag. The fifth days play is likely to throw up an absorbing tussle between Indias key batsmen like Sachin Tendulkar, who was yet to open his account, and Sourav Ganguly against the battery of South African pacemen. Wasim Jaffer was giving company to Sachin on 22. 

Jaffer, during his stay of an hour, faced 40 deliveries and hit three fours in his 22 runs, looking elegant and promising to play once more a match-saving innings as he had done twice this year; centuries against England in Ahmedabad and in Antigua against the West Indies. 

The hosts, resuming at their overnight score of 64 for no loss, survived a few anxious moments before posting 265 for eight in their second innings, thanks largely to the opening stand of 99 between Smith (58) and De Villiers (47); and later an association of 70 for the seventh wicket between Shaun Pollock (63 not out) and Andrew Hall (21). 

Sreesanth was once again the spearhead of the Indian attack as he picked four more wickets to go with his four in the first outing as India tried their best to stop the hosts from reaching their intended declaration in double quick time. 

After conceding an 88-run first innings lead, India put the skids under the hosts batting, taking six wickets in the first session before Pollock combined with Hall to sooth the hosts nerves. 

Sreesanth brought about the shift in fortunes for the Indians, picking three wickets in the space of seven deliveries. The topsy-turvy morning session was in tune with the way the match has progressed so far. 

The Indians began with a defensive mindset as Sreesanth and Zaheer Khan bowled way outside the off-stump with packed offside field in an attempt to keep the hosts down who were 152 runs in front to start with.

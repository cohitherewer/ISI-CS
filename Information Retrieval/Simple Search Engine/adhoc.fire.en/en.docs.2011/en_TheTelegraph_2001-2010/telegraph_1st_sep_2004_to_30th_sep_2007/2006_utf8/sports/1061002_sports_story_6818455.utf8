 Lara: Only dream is to lay my hands on the trophy 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Brian Lara in New Delhi on Sunday 

New Delhi: Brian Lara, it seems, is still finding it difficult to accept the fact that the West Indies have been reduced to the level of playing the qualifiers for the ICC Champions Trophy. In his first interaction with the media after the West Indies squads arrival in the capital, the batting genius spoke with a pain in his voice every time he was probed on this subject. 

It is simply unfortunate, was the initial reaction from the captain of the defending champions. We are in a predicament for going to qualifiers. As the holders, things should have been placed better and advanced further, he said. 

But at the same time, Lara made it clear that things would be a quite different in the next few weeks as his team might turn around in the Champions Trophy. The week-long camp that the players have undergone after the DLF Cup in Kuala Lumpur recently has done enough to recharge the batteries of the cricketers, he said. Its a new tournament and the players are now fresh enough to take up the challenge. 

Asked on the experiments made with the team in the DLF Cup, Lara said: It was an impromptu tournament and we were more eager to test our bowling and batting strength. Most of the players came back from holidays, yet we reached the final. Overall, it was quite satisfactory. 

Lara is placing importance on the Champions Trophy because it marks the countdown of the World Cup. Though the West Indies captain said that his side was a nice bunch of mix of youth and experience, he made it no secret that a few spots were still available with the squad. 

Defending Champions Trophy in style is Laras goal now. 

I have a career spanning over 17 years. During this time I have achieved a lot in terms of centuries and runs. But now my only dream is to lay my hands on the Champions Trophy. It is always a great feeling to land up at the airport as the defending champions. They call the West Indies the sleeping giants. My boys want to prove that they have woken up finally to conquer the world. 

While Lara said that Australia and South Africa are definitely having the favourites tag, India, too, have a very good chance of winning. 

Other than being the hosts, Indias biggest advantage is that Sachin Tendulkar is in fine form. Had I been an Indian, I would have seriously backed the home team, he remarked.

Calcutta: The North Zone batsmen couldnt have bargained for a better preparation for their respective campaigns in the Ranji Trophy which kicks off on November 23. In a prolonged run-feast, they amassed 627 for seven against the hapless Sri Lanka A on Day III of the Duleep Trophy final at the Eden on Tuesday. 

That leaves North 331 runs ahead on first innings, with two days left. The visitors will require a miracle from here on to become the first foreign side to lay hands on the coveted trophy. 

Aakash Chopra, who resumed on 135 with his side 321 for two, was unlucky to miss the double century by a dozen runs. Also joining the party were Mahesh Rawat (96 batting), Yashpal Singh (77) and Joginder Sharma (72). 

Wicketkeeper-batsman Rawat, who struck 11 boundaries, needs another hit to the fence to reach his second first-class century. The Haryana youngster is fast turning out to be an asset for Haryana and North after having taken over from Ajay Ratra last season. 

The trio of Rawat, Yashpal and Joginder got fifties on Day III alright, but none were overjoyed with their efforts on the featherbed of a pitch. The flat Eden strip was, in fact, the talking point after stumps were drawn. Even on Day III, there was no semblance of assistance for bowlers. 

The day started in much the same manner as Day II. Captain Mithun Manhas was adjudged leg before in the second over off Ishara Amarasinghe without having added to score of 29. What a disappointment it must have been for Manhas on such a track. 

Chopra and Yashpal then added 88 for the fourth wicket before left-arm spinner Rangana Herath plotted the dismissal of the discarded India opener. 

The 29-year-old Delhi batsman shouldered arms to a straight delivery that hit him on the pad. Chopra was a trifle dissatisfied with the decision, as the ball looked to be going down the legside. 

The right-hander, keen to get back into the India fold, struck 26 boundaries and faced 400 balls during his chanceless knock that spanned 574 minutes. 

Yashpal, who had replaced Manhas, played a rock-solid 77 off 156 balls while Joginders 72 came off 90 balls. Joginder hit the only six of the day. 

Joginder is in amazing form, having smashed back-to-back centuries in the previous two Duleep matches (122 versus Central Zone in Jamshedpur and 115 against East in Guwahati). He came close this time as well, before being caught by Chamara Silva off Herath.

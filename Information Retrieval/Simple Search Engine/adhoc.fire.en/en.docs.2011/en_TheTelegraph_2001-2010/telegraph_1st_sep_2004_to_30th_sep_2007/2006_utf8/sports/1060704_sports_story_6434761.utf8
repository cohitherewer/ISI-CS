The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 History speaks for Italy, but Germany confident

 - Fifa suspends Frings for post-match fracas against Argentina 

Berlin: Michael Ballack looks at some recent scorelines involving Italy and Germany and draws a conclusion. We really stand no chance, the Germany captain jokingly said on the eve of Tuesdays semi-final match between Germany and Italy. They beat us clearly and dominated us. Everything speaks against Germany, its a wonderful feeling. 

Ballack wasnt serious, but he could have been. 

Italy thrashed Germany 4-1 in a friendly in March that nearly cost coach Juergen Klinsmann his job. And AC Milan routed Bayern Munich, then still Ballacks club, 4-1 in the Champions League. 

Germany havent lost since that March game, a run of nine matches, including a five-game winning streak at the World Cup ? their best start in history. Italy, however, are unbeaten in 23 games, their second-longest streak. 

Germany have never beaten Italy in four World Cup matches, including two draws. At the 1970 semi-finals in Mexico, Italy won 4-3 in extra time in one of the World Cups most dramatic games. They also met in a final, in 1982, when Italy won 3-1, their most recent World Cup match. Both teams have three titles. 

Italy also lead the all-time series 13-7, with eight draws. World Cup history speaks for Italy, but Germany are playing at home, at their favourite stadium in the country. Germany have never lost at Dortmunds noisy stadium and has only one draw in 14 games. 

We are really looking forward to playing in Dortmund, it adds to our faith and confidence, Ballack said. We are hot and we want to be in the final. 

The Dortmund crowd is a phenomenon, Germany midfielder Tim Borowski said this week. The spectators will be the 12th man for us. 

Ballack gave three reasons he thought were enough for Germany to win ? the team is on a roll, its confidence is great and the support of home fans. 

The captain was hobbling after the Argentina match with a calf injury but proclaimed himself fit Monday. 

Midfielder Torsten Frings has been suspended for the semi-final against Italy. 

Fifa launched an investigation after television executives from Italy said they had found evidence that Frings threw a punch at Argentina forward Julio Ricardo Cruz in the fracas that followed Germanys quarter final shootout win on Friday. 

A Fifa spokesman said the 29-year-old would be suspended initially for only one game, making him eligible for the World Cup final on Sunday if Germany defeat Italy in his absence. 

 Frings will also be on probation for the next six months and will face at least another one-match ban if he re-offends during that period, the spokesman said. He was also fined 5,000 Swiss francs. 

Team manager Oliver Bierhoff was informed of the suspension soon after the side arrived in Dortmund. 

The team is very disappointed about the Fifa decision. We found out about it on the plane on the way here to Dortmund, Bierhoff told reporters. 

We havent seen the written reasons, but will accept the FIFA decision. Frings will get a special training programme to be completely fit for the final. 

Klinsmanns young, attacking team may need all the support it can get. Germany had a tougher road into the semi-finals, only getting past Argentina on penalties after a 1-1 draw in extra time. 

Italy cruised past Ukraine 3-0 and has conceded only an own-goal. Italys toughest obstacles in reaching the World Cup semi-finals have come from home. The Azzurris have persevered amid a Serie A corruption scandal and the grave condition of former teammate Gianluca Pessotto, who was hospitalised in Turin after falling out of a window. 

Italy is one of the best teams in the world and thats why its in the final four, Klinsmann said. It has great history and tradition and deserves the highest respect. We think that with our style and game we can beat them, though. And thats what we are going to do tomorrow night. 

Miroslav Klose, Germanys striker who leads the tournament with five goals, has recovered from a calf injury and will be available. 

Italy midfielder Mauro Camoranesi has a right knee injury and is doubtful, while defender Alessandro Nesta is also likely to miss the game with a right thigh injury. 

While Germany can be sure of huge support, Italy wont be without friends from the large Italian community in the area. 

Most of the immigrants come from Italys southern regions of Calabria, Puglia and Sicily. Midfielder Gennaro Gattuso is from Calabria and three of his aunts live in Germany. 

It would bring them a huge amount of joy if Italy were able to beat Germany, although weve got to remember its just a game of soccer, Gattuso said.

 TACTICAL SNEAK PEEK

 Germany coach Juergen Klinsmann has kept a settled 4-4-2 

 formation throughout the World Cup while Italy boss Marcello 

 Lippi has changed his line-up for every match and operated 

 a number of tactical systems. In the quarter final with 

 Ukraine, Italy used Luca Toni as a lone striker but Lippi 

 might be tempted to bring back forward Alberto Gilardino 

 for Tuesdays showdown with Germany and switch to 

 a 4-3-1-2 system with Francesco Totti behind two forwards.

 GERMANY

 Defence: Germanys tall centre-backs, Per Mertesacker 

 and Christoph Metzelder, have improved beyond all recognition 

 since their nervous start in a 4-2 win over Costa Rica. 

 Fullback Philipp Lahm takes every opportunity to get forward 

 on the left. Arne Friedrich is less active on the right, 

 usually relying on passes to Bernd Schneider as his outlet.

 Midfield: Michael Ballack and Torsten Frings form an aggressive 

 partnership in the centre of an orthodox four-man midfield. 

 Ballack gets forward more often, leaving Frings to scurry 

 around in a defensive role. Ballack is an excellent header 

 of the ball and will be the dangerman at set-pieces. Left 

 winger Bastian Schweinsteiger has not been in his best form 

 at this World Cup but can be a big threat, particularly 

 when combining with his Bayern Munich teammate Lahm.

 Attack: Striker Miroslav Klose has scored five times for 

 the second World Cup in succession. He acts as a target 

 man and will try to chest the ball down and control it rather 

 than head it on to striker partner Lukas Podolski, who has 

 scored three goals himself. Oliver Neuville is the super-sub 

 and came off the bench to get a last-gasp winner against 

 Poland.

 ITALY

 Defence: With Alessandro Nesta almost certain to miss 

 out again due to a groin injury, Marco Materazzi, who was 

 suspended for the quarter final win over Ukraine, is expected 

 to return in place of the relatively inexperienced Andrea 

 Barzagli. Captain Fabio Cannavaro has been in outstanding 

 form at the heart of an Azzurri defence that has conceded 

 just one goal in five matches and will win his 99th cap 

 against Germany. Fullbacks Gianluca Zambrotta and Fabio 

 Grosso like to get forward and have done so to good effect 

 in the knockout stage.

 Midfield: The most stable part of Lippis team. 

 Andrea Pirlo operates in a deep, playmakers role 

 in front of the defence with Gennaro Gattuso and Simone 

 Perrotta covering plenty of ground in their harrying roles 

 ahead of him. If Lippi plays with two out-and-out strikers 

 then Francesco Totti, showing signs of returning to full 

 form after his three-month injury lay off, will be expected 

 to play as an attacking midfielder. 

 Attack: With a single striker, Totti would be free to play 

 close to the front line but if Lippi opts for a more offensive 

 line-up, with Gilardino and Toni operating as a pair, then 

 Totti will drift deeper. Inzaghi is likely to start on the 

 bench but is an option if the Italians need a goal in the 

 second half, while Iaquinta could offer fresh legs if Toni 

 tires.

 PCB security concerns not serious: Shah 

A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES

Calcutta/Karachi: The Board of Control for Cricket In India (BCCI) secretary Niranjan Shah on Tuesday said that Pakistans security concerns over next months Champions Trophy were not serious. 

The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) will take up the matter with its Indian counterpart over a specially arranged teleconference on Friday. 

The PCB and South Africa board want to know the security plan that has been put in place for the tournament. A security consultant of the International Cricket Council (ICC) will also be part of the teleconference. There is nothing serious about it and is more or less a routine affair, Shah told The Telegraph. 

A PCB official was earlier quoted as saying: We want some issues resolved and for this purpose the teleconference is being held. The issues came up for discussion during the meeting of the chief executives of member boards of the ICC in Dubai.

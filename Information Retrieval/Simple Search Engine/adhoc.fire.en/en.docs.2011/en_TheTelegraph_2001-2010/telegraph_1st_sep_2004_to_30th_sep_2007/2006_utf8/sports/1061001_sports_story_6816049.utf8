 Chopra up to 10th, Atwal falters

Madison: Daniel Chopra blasted a four-under 68 to climb up to tied 10th but Arjun Atwal played an error-filled round of 76 to barely make the cut at the $3 million Southern Farm Bureau Classic golf championships here. 

Moving up from overnight tied 27th, Chopra is now five-under 139 and tied 11th for two rounds. 

A former winner of the Mercuries Taiwan Masters on Asian Tour, Chopra trails leader D.J. Trahan by six strokes. 

American Trahan birdied three of the last five holes to move two shots clear of the field. 

Chopra, who had a 71 on first day, had birdies on first, third and seventh as he turned in three-under. He added birdies on 11th and 16th and was five-under at that stage. He dropped a shot on the par-4 17th for his lone blemish of the day. 

Atwal, who seemed to be showing signs of turning a corner at tied 11th overnight, lapsed into errors as he had six bogeys for a round of four-over 76 on second day. 

His first round of three-under 69 saved him as he squeezed inside the cut line of one-over. He aggregated one-over 145. 

Atwals bogeys came in a bunch as he dropped shots on second, third and fourth in a row and followed that up with another on eighth but in between he birdied two par-fives on fifth and seventh to be two-over at the turn. 

He had two more bogeys on back nine on 15th and 16th and had to wait to see if he got into the weekend rounds. He just about managed and will live to fight for his card over the third and fourth rounds. 

Atwal had a fine three-under 69 on the opening day. 

Trahan rolled in a 20-foot birdie putt on his final hole as he found birdies in three of his last five holes to retain a two-shot lead at midway stage. Fighting to retain his PGA Tour card for next year, his 68 gave him a total of 133.

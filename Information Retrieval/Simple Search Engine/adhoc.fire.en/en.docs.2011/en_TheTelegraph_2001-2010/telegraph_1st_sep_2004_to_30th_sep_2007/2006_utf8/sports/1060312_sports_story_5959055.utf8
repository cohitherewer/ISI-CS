 I have never doubted myself: Kumble

 - When I began, people questioned my kind of bowling? Guess after 16 years, that still hasnt been answered

Chandigarh: Cometh the hour and cometh the man. Very few players in international cricket can fit into this phrase better than Anil Kumble, who became the fifth bowler to get 500 Test wickets. 

Soon after Day III action got over, there were wild celebrations. Toasts were raised and there was the customary cake-cutting in the long room of the PCA Stadium, greeted him on Saturday. Then the cake was splattered all over his face by Yuvraj Singh, Irfan Pathan and Harbhajan Singh. It was time to go to the washroom before making his way to the conference hall. 

The following are excerpts 

 On reaching the milestone of 500 wickets 

 Its a great feeling? What 

 makes it more special is the fact that only four other bowlers 

 have got to the 500-mark and I am the first Indian to achieve 

 it. 

 On what kept him going in these 

 16 years 

 Id say Ive persevered. 

 When I began, people questioned my kind of bowling? People 

 do so even now? I guess after 16 years, that still hasnt 

 been answered and I find it strange. Ive just gone 

 into every game thinking I need to perform and contribute 

 to the teams cause. 

 On to whom he dedicates this milestone 

 I dedicate this to all those players 

 who have played with me. To the fielders who took the catches, 

 the fellow bowlers who applied pressure from the other end, 

 to batsmen who put runs on the board making my effort that 

 bit easier ... I would not have got 500 wickets if they 

 had not played their part. 

 On what has been the secret of his success 

 Ive always had the self-belief 

 that I can perform at this level. There have been doubts 

 created by other people over my ability to perform. When 

 you play for 16 years such doubts are bound to happen. But 

 I have never doubted my abilities. Nor have my teammates 

 and my family. My wifes (Chetna) support has always 

 been with me? Coming back from my shoulder injury (in 2000-01) 

 was crucial. 

 On his next target 

 Already the tally is 501. How 

 many more wickets Ill get depends on my body and the 

 schedule? I cant really comment. Warne has 659, Murali 

 just got to 600 yesterday, hopefully Ill also scale 

 those heights some day. 

 On the memorable wickets 

 The first wicket of Allan Lamb, 

 which was where it all started... The 10-wicket haul against 

 Pakistan in Delhi was special. Also the win against Australia 

 in Adelaide in early 2005 ... The series win in Pakistan 

 in 2004 will also remain etched in memory. 

 On setting up batsmen 

 When I bowl I believe every ball can get a wicket. 

 I always go in with that kind of attitude. Obviously you 

 try and set up a batsman, get him to play a few shots. Some 

 days it works, some days it doesnt. 

 On how he still continues to strive to improve 

 You need to constantly evolve 

 and bring up some variations because these days even before 

 you step out, the opposition knows everything about you. 

 I still try to bowl the classical leg-break, the classical 

 flipper and the classical googly. The day I think Ive 

 had enough of trying out these new things, I wont 

 be playing anymore. 

 On missing out on a hattrick on Saturday

 You cant think about all 

 this? I guess I could have bowled the same ball as the previous 

 two? You cant ask for too many things. Im happy 

 I managed to wrap up the tail quickly. 

 On his worst fears 

 There were fears that I may not 

 bowl again after the shoulder injury and when I had the 

 surgery. It took two months to just lift my hand. Thats 

 when my wife, Andrew Leipus, Omkar (yoga expert in Bangalore) 

 and Ramakant (Karnataka team physio) constantly motivated 

 and helped me in my rehabilitation. Also the thought that 

 one day when I bowl there would be no pain was enough motivation. 

 Srinaths comeback after a similar surgery also gave 

 me lot of strength. 

 On how he seems to be bowling at his best in the 

 recent past 

 The last couple of years have 

 been good. The experience that Ive gained over the 

 years and the way the ball is coming out of the hand has 

 been good. The number of overs I have bowled over the last 

 16 years have helped me understand what needs to be done. 

 On if he would like to play the 2007 World Cup 

 Theres still a long way 

 to go. To win this Test match is important? Then theres 

 the next one coming up in Mumbai. It is entirely up to the 

 team management. We have been doing well in the one-dayers? 

 Won against Sri Lanka, drew level versus South Africa and 

 recently beat Pakistan. It all depends on what the team 

 management wants and what their plans are. 

 On what Matthew Hoggard, his 300th victim, had 

 to say when Harmison departed 

 He suggested that I might have 

 been more happy if Id picked up the wicket of a batsman 

 as my 500th victim.

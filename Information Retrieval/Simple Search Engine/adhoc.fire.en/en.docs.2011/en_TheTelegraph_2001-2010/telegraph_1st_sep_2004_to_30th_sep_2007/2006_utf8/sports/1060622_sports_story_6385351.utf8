 - Four-Nation Meet

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: Ace striker Bhaichung Bhutia, who hasnt reported for the national camp at Goa yet, can still make the team for the four-nation tournament in Vancouver next month if he decides to join in the last week, according to the All India Football federation president Priyaranjan Das Munshi. 

Speaking to The Telegraph from Stuttgart in Germany on Wednesday, Das Munshi said: I had a talk with Bhaichung before I left for the World Cup here. I told him he can come to the camp at the end. 

Das Munshi said he was aware that Bhutia is involved in some television programme during the World Cup. Bhaichungs going to Canada tournament is not as important as the Asian Games in December. What is important is that Bhaichung should be available for the Asian Games. 

Meanwhile, the camp in Goa started under British coach Bob Houghton with three key players reporting injured on the opening day. Habibur Rehman Mondal also could not practice as he is running high fever.

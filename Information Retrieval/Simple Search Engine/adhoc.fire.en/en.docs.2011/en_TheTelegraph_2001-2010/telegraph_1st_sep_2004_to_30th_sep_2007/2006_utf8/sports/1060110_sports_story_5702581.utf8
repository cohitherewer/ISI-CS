The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Irina rues lack of opportunity

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Irina Brar, the No. 1 amateur lady golfer in the country, feels that womens golf is still in its nascent stages and some aggressive training programme for the juniors was important. 

In the city to play in the West Bengal Ladies Amateur Golf, Irina told The Telegraph: There are not many opportunities for lady golfers in the country. It is limited to the amateur level and if someone is planning to be a professional she has to move outside the country. 

Irina was the champion in the 44 th East India Challenge Cup which was held in the city last month. This time she is confident of also winning the championship, which will be played at the par-72 course of the Royal Calcutta Golf Club from Tuesday. 

It would be a four-round strokeplay event. Seventy entries have already been accepted out of which some top golfers of the country will participate. 

Irina, who is currently pursuing her Masters in psychology from DAV College in Chandigarh, took to the sport at the age of 12 and has been in the top spot for the last six years. 

A sports officer with IndianOil, Irina is planning to move to United States where she wants to pursue her masters in sports psychology, and also try her luck in the professional circuit there.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Md. Sporting get past Mohun Bagan 2-1 

 - Premier Division 

 - Douglas, vijayan set up victory 

A STAFF REPORTER

 Deepak Mondal tries 

 to stop MoM Raman Vijayan from making headway in their 

 CFL Premier Division match at the Salt Lake Stadium 

 on Sunday. A Telegraph picture 

 Calcutta: Make no mistake, 

 Mohammedan Sporting sizzled on Sunday!

 Raman Vijayan, Mike Okoro, Douglas 

 da Silva combined so well on Sunday that the Mohun Bagan 

 defence of the Deepak Mondals and Sanjeev Marias virtually 

 had no answer. As a result, the black-and-white brigade 

 walked away with three vital points following a 2-1 win 

 in the Sahara CFL Premier Division match at the Salt Lake 

 Stadium on Sunday.

 Douglas brilliant goal from 

 the set-piece in the 17th minute was neutralised by Dipendu 

 Biswas four minutes later and the winner was scored by Man 

 of the Match Raman Vijayan in the 52nd minute.

 Mohun Bagan had full domination 

 in the first session, but squandered a number of chances, 

 and thus, allowed Mohammedan Sporting to cherish a memorable 

 win in their recent past. 

 It was quite against the run of 

 play, Mohammedan Sporting got a direct free-kick just outside 

 the box after Vijayan was tripped by Maria. Douglas, known 

 for his finesse in these situations, took a brilliant 

 left-footer that hit the inside of the bar and went in, 

 giving his team the lead in the 17th minute.

 But joy for Subhas Bhowmicks 

 side was short-lived. A long ball was crossed towards the 

 box, which was intended for Bhaichung. The India captain 

 impeccably headed it down for Dipendu, who made no mistake 

 disturbing the net with a powerful shot. This was Dipendus 

 200th goal in a career spanning over a decade. But such 

 remarkable feat from the countrys one of the leading 

 scorers went in vain ultimately. 

 It was not Bhaichungs day 

 as well, as he missed an sitter. A Bijoy Basfore was asking 

 for a firm volley, but the star striker failed to capitalise 

 on it much to everyones surprise. Mehrajuddin Wadoo, 

 Subhas Chakraborty, Satyajit Bose and Palash Karmakar linked 

 up well with the Dipendu-Bhaichung pair, through a steady 

 supply of balls from the middle, but the duo upfront misfired 

 one opportunity after another. 

 Mohammedan Sporting went on rampage 

 after Bhowmick brought in Jamir Ali Mondal in place of Noel 

 Wilson, who had a miserable day in office. Jamirs 

 solo runs made it life difficult for Deepak and Maria in 

 the backline. 

 Soon after the breather, Vijayan 

 scored the all-important goal. Debjit Ghoshs long 

 through was nicely received by Okoro, who set it up for 

 Vijayan to do the rest. Veteran Vijayan couldnt have 

 done anything wrong on his day. 

 Jamir, operating from the left, 

 helped Okoro and Vijayan toying with the Mohun Bagan defence. 

 Using the width of the park, Jamir-Okoro-Vijayan combine 

 forced Mohun Bagan coach Biswajit Bhattacharya to bring 

 in Suman Dutta in place of Palash Karmakar. But it was of 

 no use as Mohammedan Sporting, by that time, had pressed 

 the accelerator hard. 

 Mohammedan Sporting appeared to 

 have been deprived of a penalty in the 75th minute, when 

 Jamirs long-ranger was somehow fisted out by Subrata 

 Pal. Bijen Singh, lurking in the zone, took a prompt right-footer 

 which struck Basfores hand. Referee Dhanapati Roy 

 was unmoved. By virtue of this win, Mohammedan Sporting 

 were on eight points after four matches while the green-and-maroons 

 remained on four from as many outings.

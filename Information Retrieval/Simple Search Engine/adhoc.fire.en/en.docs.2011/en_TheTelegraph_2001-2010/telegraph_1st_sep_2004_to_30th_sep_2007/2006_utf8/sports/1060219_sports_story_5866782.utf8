 Korea rout India 3-0

Jaipur: Second seed South Korea knocked off India 3-0 to march into the final of the Thomas Cup Badminton Championship qualifiers and set up a clash with Malaysia. 

Malaysia overcame stiff challenge from Indonesia, but prevailed 3-2 in the Asian Zone Qualifiers here at Sawai Man Singh Sports Complex. 

National champion Anoop Sridhar put up a spirited show against Olympic silver medallist Shon Seung Mo before losing 24-22, 25-27, 10-21. Chetan Anand had a tough time in first singles against world No.6 Lee Hyun and lost 13-21, 10-21. 

In the second singles, Anoop Sridhar gave a valiant fight and won the first game 24-22 against Shon Seung but wasted four match points in second game and allowed his opponent to strike back. 

The Korean, getting a respite, won it 27-25 and then went on to win the third 21-10 to give his team 2-0 lead. 

The doubles pair of Rupesh Kumar and Sanave Thomas started brilliantly but fizzled out soon enough as the Korean pair, boosted by a late surge, scored a facile 21-17, 21-12 victory. 

In Uber Cup, following Aparna Popats last moment withdrawal, Indian eves went down fighting 2-3 against Malaysia to finish sixth. 

The women, who have already missed the bus, were playing for 5-6 place. 

Top seeds Korea will play Singapore while Hong Kong will meet Chinese Taipei in the womens semi-finals. (PTI)

 Jayasuriya stays positive

 Jayasuriya

Hove: Sanath Jayasuriya is remaining positive about his prospects of a Test recall even though his chances of appearing in next weeks second Test against England seemed to suffer a blow this week. 

The 36-year-old lefthanded opener was recently persuaded to end his Test retirement by new chairman of selectors Asantha de Mel and arrived in England ahead of schedule (he is still a one-day regular) during the drawn first Test at Lords. 

Sri Lanka collapsed for 192 in the first innings, but a much improved performance second-time around saw them bat for 14 hours to save the game. 

Neither Sri Lanka coach Tom Moody nor captain Mahela Jayawardene were consulted about Jayasuriyas recall, and the former skipper was omitted from the ongoing tour match against Sussex, the tourists last before they go to Edgbaston for the second Test. 

But an upbeat Jayasuriya said: It doesnt rule me out because they are trying out a few players here. 

Im just practising and getting settled down in England. We dont know about the team ? if Im picked I always love to play for my country, if not Ill have to sit out the game. 

I have no problem with the players or coach, so returning was nothing serious, he added.

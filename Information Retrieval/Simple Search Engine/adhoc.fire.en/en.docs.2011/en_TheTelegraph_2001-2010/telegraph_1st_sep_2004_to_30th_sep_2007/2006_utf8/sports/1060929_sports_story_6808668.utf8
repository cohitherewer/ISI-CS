 Imran calls for action against Hair

 - THE OVAL FIASCO

 charges

Islamabad: Pakistans World Cup-winning captain Imran Khan called for action to be taken against Australian umpire Darrell Hair after Inzamam-ul Haq was cleared on ball-tampering charges. 

Imran welcomed Inzamams acquittal and dismissed the International Cricket Council (ICC) decision to ban Inzamam for four ODIs on a charge of bringing the game into disrepute after The Oval Test fiasco last month. 

I welcome the acquittal of Inzamam and the team of ball tampering charges. Pakistan have been cleared of very serious allegations of cheating, Imran said. 

The other offence is quite minor and I think the punishment is also minor. 

Pakistan forfeited the fourth Test at The Oval after refusing to take the field after tea on the fourth day in protest at the decision of umpires Hair and Billy Doctrove to penalise them five runs for ball-tampering. 

Imran, who branded Hair a mini-Hitler in a newspaper column after The Oval Test, added: now the next question is what to do with the man who created the whole controversy at the first place. If Inzamam is cleared of ball-tampering allegations, now clearly some sort of action should be taken against the man who was responsible for such serious allegations. 

That allegation caused the big incident where Pakistan ended up forfeiting the match, Imran said. 

Another former Pakistan captain Rameez Raja agreed that the ICC needed to take action against the umpire. The ICC need to pull up their socks and take a firm decision now on Darrell Hair, he said, adding that he thought Pakistan should appeal against the verdict. 

Pakistans lawyers now would be arguing that if he was not guilty of ball tampering, why has he been handed out a four-match ban punishment? I was expecting he would be exonerated from the charges of ball tampering, said former-Test captain Intikhab Alam. Inzamam should not appeal the decision, he added. 

Another former Test fast bowler Sarfraz Nawaz criticised umpire Hair for creating unnecessary chaos. I think he (Hair) wanted to collect more juicy stuff for his book by levelling charges of ball tampering against Pakistan, Nawaz said. 

Now it will be interesting to see what punishment Hair will get from the ICC, he added. 

Another former captain Javed Miandad said: I dont think Hair will now be in a position to umpire any future international matches confidently. He is going to be under pressure and every decision of his can be challenged. 

 The Pakistan Cricket Board and Inzamam said on Thursday 

 that they will not appeal the four-match ban, although former 

 pace bowler Wasim Akram said they should. When the 

 ball-tampering charges have been dismissed then why the 

 ban, he said. (Agencies)

 ADJUDICATOR MADUGALLES 

 STATEMENT

 BALL-TAMPERING: 

 On the first charge of ball-tampering under paragraph 2.9 

 of the Code, I find Mr Ul-Haq not guilty. Having regard 

 to the seriousness of the allegation of ball-tampering, 

 I am not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that 

 there is sufficiently cogent evidence that the fielding 

 team had taken action likely to interfere with the condition 

 of the ball. In my judgment, the marks are as consistent 

 with normal wear and tear of a match ball after 56 overs 

 as they are with deliberate human intervention. Mr Saini 

 (acting on behalf of the ICC) submitted that I should not 

 reject the consistent views of the experienced ICC witnesses. 

 I have considered their evidence, honestly and fairly given, 

 very carefully. But my duty is to form and give my own judgment. 

 BRINGING THE GAME INTO 

 DISREPUTE: On the second charge of bringing the 

 game into disrepute by refusing to play, I find Mr Ul-Haq 

 guilty in that on two occasions he led a protest against 

 the umpires by failing to come onto the field of play at 

 the relevant time.

 I take the view, subject of course to any further submissions 

 Mr Gay (acting on behalf of the Pakistan Cricket Board) 

 may wish to make, that this is a Level 3 charge, leading 

 to a penalty of a ban of between 2 and 4 Test matches or 

 between 4 and 8 ODI matches. I will now hear Mr Gay on any 

 submissions you wish to make on the appropriate penalty. 

 WHAT THE CODE SAYS 

 Paragraph 2.9 of the ICC Code 

 of Conduct for Players and Team Officials: Changing the 

 condition of the ball in breach of Law 42.3. It falls under 

 Level 2 offences, penalty for which shall be a fine of the 

 equivalent of between 50% of the Player or Officials 

 match fee up to their full match fee and/or a one Test Match 

 or two ODI Match ban. 

 Level 3 offences: a) Repeat of 

 any Level 2 offence within 12 months of such offence, b) 

 Intimidation of an umpire or Referee whether by language 

 or conduct, c) Threat of assault on another Player, Team 

 Official or spectator, d) Using any language or gestures 

 that offends, insults, humiliates, intimidates, threatens, 

 disparages or vilifies another person on the basis of that 

 persons race, religion, gender, colour, descent or 

 national or ethnic origin. 

 Penalties for Level 3 offences 

 can be a ban for the Player or Team Official concerned of 

 between 2 and 4 Test Matches or between 4 and 8 ODI Matches.

 Controversy will affect team morale: Akram

Jaipur: Wasim Akram Saturday said the Younis Khan episode would affect the morale of the Pakistan team in the Champions Trophy. 

Such controversies do have a bearing on any team and it will affect the morale of the Pakistan team, he said. 

Pakistan are to play their first match against a qualifier here on October 17. 

I dont know what happened there but it must be something serious. Younis is a true Pathan like me and straightforward. Controversies are not new to Pakistan. 

Asked about the poor form of Irfan Pathan, who had received some tips from him earlier, Akram said: He has perhaps lost his rythm. He needs the backing of the captain and the coach. He can come out of this patch, probably in this tournament itself. 

Akram did not think batting at No. 3 had affected Pathans bowling. It does not make much of a difference. I too had batted at that number. 

Asked about coach Greg Chappells experiments, Akram retorted, why do you talk of only Chappell? Such experiments have the nod from the captain and the rest of the team management as well. 

Rahul Dravid must have been a party to all these decisions, and if he doesnt have a say in such matters, it is not good for Indian cricket. A captain should be the boss of the team. (PTI)

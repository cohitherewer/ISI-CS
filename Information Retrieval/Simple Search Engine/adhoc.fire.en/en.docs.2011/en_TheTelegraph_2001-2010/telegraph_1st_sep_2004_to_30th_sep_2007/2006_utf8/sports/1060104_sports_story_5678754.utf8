 Sanskara gets Derby clearance 

 OUR TURF CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta: The Classic filly Sanskara was cleared by the RCTC starter to contest Sundays Derby. The unruly behaviour of the filly had prompted the sta-rter to withdraw her from the Oaks line-up, and also revoke her gate certificate. On Monday, the Bharath Singh-trainee behaved in an orderly manner at the gate practice. The following horses were seen going at easy paces, on Tuesday, in preparation for the Derby day races:Outer sand track

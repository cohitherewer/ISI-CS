 Moody, Nielsen in contention

Melbourne: The search for Australian cricket coach John Buchanans replacement will begin next month with Tim Nielsen and Tom Moody emerging as front-runners. A Cricket Australia (CA) sub-committee, which includes Allan Border and Mark Taylor, will discuss the issue. 

Captain Ricky Ponting will have a crucial vote in the selection of the next coach, an Australian daily reported on Wednesday. CA is also contemplating names of other Australians Greg Chappell, Bennett King and Dav Whatmore who are doing coachs duty for various other national squads. Buchanan will not renew his contract, which expires after the World Cup. (PTI)

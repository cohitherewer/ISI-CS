The final European game at Highbury was always going to be a special occasion, and Wednesday night featured a pitch-invading squirrel, Spanish play-acting, a rare Kolo Toure strike, Gilberto Silvas inspirational display and the thrilling reality that Arsenal have taken a significant step towards the climax of the Champions League in Paris on May 17 (as reported in Thursdays Late City edition). 

Toure scored the only goal of the game. First strike: Toure put Arsenal ahead. Patently superior to an often boorish Villarreal, Arsene Wengers side would have preferred to be taking more than Toures first goal in 14 months to El Madrigal next Tuesday, but they will still travel hopefully to Spain. If Arsenal find the net once, Villarreal will have to breach three times a back-line that has now stood firm for 829 minutes in Europe. 

Villarreal, who mixed the cautious, the cynical and the occasional counter at Highbury, will have to change their game plan now, opening up and committing bodies forward, a tactic that will suit Wengers 4-5-1 approach. With Thierry Henry leading the line, Arsenal go through the gears so quickly that Villarreal will be beware of leaving their back-line exposed. 

No complacency will temper Arsenals commitment levels in Spain either. Not with Gilberto being such a colossal influence in midfield. The Brazilian was everywhere on Wednesday, extinguishing fires in midfield, constantly intercepting the ball, calming nerves and supporting attacks. 

Just before the break, with Arsenal just having seized the lead, Gilberto dived in on Jose Mari, clearly knocking the Villarreal forward off-balance. 

It looked a clear penalty, but the Austrian referee Konrad Plautz was in generous mood to the hosts. Plautz was also singularly unimpressed by Villarreals gamesmanship, and their propensity for falling theatrically, rolling around before springing to life the moment the stretcher appeared. Yet the Spaniards certainly had a legitimate grievance over Jose Maris penalty shout. 

Indignant at the iniquity, Juan Roman Riquelme was cautioned for dissent. 

If Gilberto was Man of the Match, Toure was not far behind, partly for a poachers act that brought Arsenal their 50th European victory at Highbury. Arsenals goal was a well-worked affair, a strike full of timing, technique and instinctive understanding between teammates. Just when it seemed that the only thing that would elude a keeper was the squirrel that sped past Jens Lehmann, Arsenal seized a half-time lead. 

Reward came shortly before the turnaround. The goals origins lay in a corner in front of an expectant Clock End. Henry jogged across towards the flag and placed the ball down. He then swept it towards the far-post where Gilberto and Philippe Senderos had been peeling away to, seeking to escape their markers. 

Marcos Senna, the midfield sentry, reached Henrys corner first, intercepting the ball mid-flight and heading it out of the box, for it to drop at Henrys feet. Thirty yards out, and slightly wide, the French international darted across the field, always watching Alexandr Hlebs break down the inside-left corridor. 

Henry slipped the ball down the channel and Hleb was free. Villarreal were caught square, Toure stole in and met Hlebs driven cross with the neatest of close-range finishes. Euphoria swept Highbury because, until then, Arsenal had failed to impose their smooth-passing game in a first half pockmarked by mistakes.

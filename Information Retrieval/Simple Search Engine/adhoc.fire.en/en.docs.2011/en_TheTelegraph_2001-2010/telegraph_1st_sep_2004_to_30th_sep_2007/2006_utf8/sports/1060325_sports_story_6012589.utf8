 England players told me about crowd abuse: Pawar

Mumbai: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) chief Sharad Pawar on Friday revealed the visiting England team had brought to his notice the abusive behaviour of a section of the crowd during the third and final Test against India in Mumbai. 

England cricketers did bring up the issue. It was unfortunate that some spectators abused the players, Pawar said while chairing the annual general meeting of the Mumbai Cricket Association here. 

Besides other issues, the AGM also discussed the crowd behaviour at the Wankhede in the final Test, which England won by 212 runs. 

The topic was raised by a MCA member who mentioned the character of the crowd in the north stand, which booed Sachin Tendulkar after his dismissal in the first innings, and hurled abuses at England captain Andrew Flintoff and fast bowler Matthew Hoggard. 

The members were also informed of the BCCIs proposal seeking additional space in the new building to house its headquarters planned at the Wankhede Stadium. 

The BCCI has been allotted a floor of the four-storey building that will also serve as MCA head office. (PTI)

 Rohan Gavaskars 49 was laced with six boundaries, while flamboyant Laxmi Ratan Shukla is batting on 50

Lucknow: Bengal and Uttar Pradesh were evenly placed at close on the third day of the Ranji Trophy final at the KD Singh Babu Stadium here Tuesday. While the hosts need two wickets, Bengal require another 39 runs to take the vital first innings lead. 

Flamboyant Laxmi Ratan Shukla was unbeaten on 50 with Bengal at 349 for eight at close. Giving Shukla company was Ranadeb Bose, who scored three from 38 balls. Uttar Pradesh made 387 in their first innings. Piyush Chawla was the most successful bowler with four wickets. 

Shukla was dropped by Suresh Raina at 25 and later survived a run out chance on the same score. 

Bengal resumed this morning and lost Arindam Das almost immediately. The opener could add just one run to his overnight 59. He gave a simple catch to keeper Mohammed Amir Khan off Chawla while trying to cut. 

Nightwatchman Shiv Sagar Singh fell a little later, failing to read the line of the ball. He made 23 with three fours. 

Bengal were expected to bat into a position of strength but their batsmen let them down. None showed the temperament to stay at the wicket and let the hosts dominate. 

Former captain Rohan Gavaskar made a solid start but failed to build on it. His 49 came off 70 balls with six boundaries. He was trapped leg before by seamer Praveen Kumar. 

Manoj Tewari too, departed in similar fashion and the visitors were soon reduced to 207/5 at lunch. Tewari struck four boundaries in his 43-run essay, which came off 92 balls. He added 48 runs for the fifth wicket with captain Deep Dasgupta. 

Deep was dismissed for 20 after offering a simple catch to the keeper off Ashish Winston Zaidi. His knock included three boundaries. 

Tewari added another 50 runs for the seventh wicket with Shukla. Both the batsmen showed immense responsibility during their partnership. A rash stroke, however caused Tewaris downfall. 

Shukla then joined Sourashish Lahiri and the pair were going great guns with the score reading 313 for seven at tea. 

Lahiri, however, offered a simple bat-pad catch to Shivakant Shukla at forward short-leg, when on 21, after failing to read to Chawla delivery. 

Young leggie and Sri Lanka-bound Youth World Cupper Chawla ended with figures of 4 for 71, while Praveen Kumar ended the day with 2 for 123. Salabh Srivastava and Zaidi grabbed one wicket each. 

The third days proceedings were cut short by 18 overs before the start due to bad light.

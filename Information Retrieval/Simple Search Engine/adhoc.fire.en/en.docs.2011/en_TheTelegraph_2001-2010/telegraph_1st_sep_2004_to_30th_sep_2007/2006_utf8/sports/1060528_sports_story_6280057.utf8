 Jeev Milkha misses cut 

Wentworth: Jyoti Randhawa carded an even par-72 to make the cut to remain in tied 32nd position even as Jeev Milkha Singh shot a five-over 77 and missed the cut at the BMW Championships at the Wentworth Club. 

Jeev, who missed the cut for the first time in more than two months, had six bogeys, three birdies and one double bogey. 

Randhawa had birdies on the fourth, fifth, 12th, 16th and 18th, while his double bogeys came on the first and 15th. 

David Howell fired a scintillating seven-under 65 to take sole lead and put himself in line to win a sleek BMW car besides a hefty cheque.

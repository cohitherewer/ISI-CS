 Love to face Ogilvy in final

 WGC Match-Play Meet

 Carlsbad: Davis Love III 

 reached the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship final 

 for the second time in three years with a 4 amp;2 victory 

 over fellow American Zach Johnson on Saturday.

 Love, who spectacularly holed 

 out with a wedge to eagle the last and beat Irelands 

 Padraig Harrington one up in the mornings quarter 

 finals, sealed the win when neither player could birdie 

 the par-three 16th.

 Moments later, Australias 

 Geoff Ogilvy triumphed 4 amp;3 against US Ryder Cup captain 

 Tom Lehman when his American opponent failed to par the 

 15th hole.

 Love, beaten 3 amp;2 by Tiger 

 Woods in the 2004 final, took early charge against Johnson 

 with four birdies on the front nine.

 Although Johnson birdied the second 

 and third, he found water with his second shot at the par-five 

 eighth before running up a regulation par.

 Love holed a 13-foot birdie there 

 to forge one ahead.

 The world No. 28 then coolly rolled 

 in a 16-footer for birdie at the par-four ninth to double 

 his lead.

 A superb approach to seven feet 

 at the par-four 13th earned Love his fifth birdie of the 

 round and he then coaxed in a 23-footer at the par-four 

 14th to go four up.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Eriksson successor likely on Friday

 Henry Winter and Rob Stewart

The FAs nominations committee on Friday held what sources described as a positive meeting to discuss the credentials of the contenders for the England job. Steve McClaren is favourite ahead of Brian Barwicks preferred choice, Martin Neill, although Luis Felipe Scolari remains in the frame following an outstanding interview. 

No announcement is expected in a day or two, according to FA sources, although some senior figures within football expect a decision involving McClaren on Friday, the day after the second leg of Middlesbroughs Uefa Cup semi-final against Steaua Bucharest. 

The FA is understandably sensitive about disrupting any clubs preparation for a big match. Soho Square would also require time to negotiate a contract with McClaren and sort out compensation with Boro, which might delay matters further. 

Newcastle United are also known to have been placing pressure on Neill, their No. 1 target as manager. 

The Premier League accepted Newcastles understandable argument that their pursuit of Neill, and Sam Allardyce, has inevitably been delayed by the pair being on the England shortlist. Allardyce, like Alan Curbishley, is not now considered in contention for the England post. 

McClarens candidature still arouses mixed feelings. Teddy Sheringham, who was coached by McClaren at Manchester United and with England, said on Friday that he felt it would be a bit too soon for McClaren to be made England manager now. He has still got a lot of learning to do over the next 10 years, Sheringham said. I think its an older mans job and Steve should be allowed to get on and enjoy his club career first. Eventually I can see him getting the England job, but it should be further down the line. 

Admitting that he found the England talk about him flattering, McClaren countered mounting criticism about his credentials. I dont feel the need to defend my record, he said. People just have to look at the facts.

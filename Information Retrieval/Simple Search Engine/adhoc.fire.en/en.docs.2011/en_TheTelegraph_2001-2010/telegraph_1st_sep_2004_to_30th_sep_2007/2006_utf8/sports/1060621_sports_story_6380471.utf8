 India captains job bigger than Erikssons

London: Sourav Ganguly believes the job of an Indian captain is bigger than that of Englands football manager. 

Asked to compare the two jobs, Sourav said in a radio interview: Its as big a job as (Sven-Goran) Erikssons ? I would say probably bigger because you have more people following (the game in India), he said. 

Everybody has an opinion. There are lots of media, about 50 television channels and all of them thrive on this sport, thats what makes the channels run. 

Everybody gives an opinion how the team can play better. When you play well, they love you to bits, when you dont, they criticise you to bits. Thats the way it is, but I think after a time you just get used to it, you just put it aside and move on. At the end of the day, as long as you know you are giving your best, thats all that matters. 

Sourav added: Losing the captaincy did not hurt me much because I dont think I would have achieved any more as a captain. 

I captained 49 Test matches for India and nearly 160 one-day games, I think thats quite a bit, but I still feel I can be a part of this team and contribute successfully. Obviously, not getting a place as a player was difficult.

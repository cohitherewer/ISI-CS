Abu Dhabi: India put up a listless batting display to be bowled out for a modest 197 in the first one-day International against arch rivals Pakistan here on Tuesday. 

Pakistan rode Younis Khans unbeaten 71 to a six-wicket win, with nine balls to spare. Inzamam scored 40. Ajit Agarkar took two wickets. 

The sole resistance from the Indians came from Yalaka Venugopal Rao (61 not out) who struck his maiden one-day 50 to bail out India who were reduced to 72 for four by the disciplined Pakistani bowlers. 

Rao shared a crucial 64-run partnership with Suresh Raina, the only other notable performer with 40 after Indian captain Rahul Dravid won the toss and elected to bat at the Zayed Stadium, hosting its first ever International. 

There was an ominous ring to the way the Indians gifted away their wickets on a track which had no devils in it. As many as four batsmen were run out while another four were caught while attempting ambitious shots. 

Shoaib Malik was the most impressive among the bowlers, taking three for 40 including the prized scalp of Mahendra Singh Dhoni (3). 

Pakistan would need to score at less than four runs an over to go 1-0 up in this two-match series. 

India were off to a sedate start as the Pakistani new ball bowlers maintained a tight line and length. 

Irfan Pathan was once again promoted up the order and the left-hander tried to build up a partnership with his skipper with some intelligent batting. 

But their stand came to an early end after a misunderstanding saw Dravid being run out for 20 which came off 29 balls and included three boundaries. 

Yuvraj Singh failed to sustain his imperious form of the England series, edging behind to wicketkeeper Kamran Akmal off Rao Ifthikar Anjum for a mere 7. 

With India reduced to a precarious 72 for four, it was left to youngsters Rao and Raina to resurrect the innings. 

The duo brought some order into the proceedings and stitched a partnership of 64 runs for the fifth wicket to take a subdued India beyond the 100-run mark. 

Raina (40) looked confident during his stay at the wicket, hitting three fours which included an exquisitely straight driven four. 

Dhoni walked in to a rapturous welcome but lasted only 10 balls, bowled by a yorker from Malik for 3. 

With wickets falling at regular intervals, Rao (3x4, 93 balls) stood guard at one end before eventually running out of partners. 

A breathtaking display of laser and fireworks lit up the Arab skyline to herald a new era for cricket in the Emirates which saw its capital Abu Dhabi join the ranks of select international venues in the world with the staging of India-Pakistan one-dayer. 

The spectacular 20-minute programme was a symphony of colours and lights and reflected the opulence of this desert kingdom. 

A packed Zayed Stadium watched in awe as a giant balloon descended in the middle of the ground and around 200 acrobats took centrestage, highlighting by their performance the confluence of the east and the west.

JAYDEEP BASU

 Wayne Rooney

After eight years, Zinedine Zidane has once again decided to outshine all others on the world stage. While a scintillating display from the veteran midfielder saw France storming into the semi-finals at the cost of hot favourites and holders Brazil, Germany and Portugal proved their detractors wrong by taming their rivals in the penalty shoot-out after failing to settle scores in 120 minutes. The following is a compilation of the happenings in Germany in the knock-out rounds: 

 Best team: France 

Dismissed as a bunch of oldies after the goalless draw against Switzerland at the group stage, France thereafter has displayed the best technical football to reach the semi-finals. They did dazzle the opposition with penetration and team spirit, but their snatching, marking of the rivals and defensive organisation was more elegant. 

 Best player: Zinedine 

 Zidane (France) 

Already considered one of the greatest footballers of his time, Zinedine Zidane has now staked claims to be talked in the same breath with Pele and Maradona. With three Fifa Player of the Year awards, one World Cup and Euro title under his belt, Zidane stole the limelight with his precision passing, accurate ball control and phenomenal positional play. 

 Youngest performer: Cristiano 

 Ronaldo (Portugal) 

Often criticised for his individualistic and flashy style of play and dribbling skills, 21-year-old Ronaldo has proved to be the backbone of the Portugal team in the absence of Deco and Luis Figo, who was substituted. 

 Best save: Ricardo (Portugal) 

Portugal goalkeeper Ricardo saved a record three penalties in a shootout win against England in the quarter finals. Having stopped Frank Lampard, Steven Gerrard and Jamie Carragher from scoring, Ricardo became the first goalkeeper during a World Cup match to stop three penalty kicks. 

 Best goal: Maxi Rodriguez 

 (Argentina) 

Maxi Rodriguezs super strike against Mexico is perhaps one of the most scintillating goals in this World Cup. After 98 minutes Juan Pablo Sorins lofted cross found Rodriguez on the right edge of the area. Taming the ball with his chest, he arced a dramatically dipping volley into the top corner of the Mexico net. 

 Best coach: Luiz Felipe 

 Scolari (Portugal) 

A master tactician. Often labelled as too dramatic and an exhibitionist, the Portugal coach has shown how to steer the team out of troubled situations. Against a rampaging The Netherlands, his continuos tantrums and antics were a planned move to protect the slender lead. The same man kept his entire team under control to patiently take the match to tiebreaker against England. 

 Best match: France vs 

 Spain 

It was knock-out football at its best and pace was the compelling feature of the encounter. It turned out to be a thrilling contest with the ball travelling from one end to the other throughout 90 minutes. France, however, were the better of the two as they produced a fine allround performance to set up a quarter final against Brazil. 

 Knock-out quote: France 

 coach Domenech after beating Brazil 

Two years ago, we set out with the aim of putting the smile back on the faces of our supporters. I believe weve done a pretty good job, but I can assure you that theres more to come! 

 Worst refereeing decision: 

 Luis Medina Cantalejo (Italy vs Australia) 

The penalty award that shattered Australias World Cup dreams. Italys Fabio Grosso allowed himself to tumble over the body of Aussie defender Lucas Neill, who was lying flat on the ground inside the penalty area. Grosso chose to hook his toes on Neills body and he went tumbling. The Spanish referee Luis Medina Cantalejo awarded a penalty kick. 

 Worst behaved fans: England 

England fans remained unmatched once again. Around 400 England supporters were detained for mostly drunken and aggressive behaviour during the England-Ecuador second-round match in Stuttgart. English and German fans threw glass bottles and chairs at each other before police moved in to separate them. 

 Biggest disappointment: 

 Red card to Wayne Rooney 

The dismissal of striker Wayne Rooney from the pitch was a big reason behind Englands exit from the quarter finals against Portugal. Rooney was ejected in the 62nd minute after getting tangled up with a Portuguese player and then pushing Cristiano Ronaldo. 

 Surprise package: Ukraine 

Ukraine were rank outsiders in the elite group of eight at the knock-out stage. Having qualified for the World Cup for the first time, Ukraine were beaten by three-time champions Italy, but were never disgraced.They played an open game, created chances, but unfortunately could not convert them. 

 Most touching gesture: 

The attitude of Zinedine Zidane after France defeated Brazil in the quarter finals warmed many hearts, especially after the ugly fight in the Germany-Argentina match. As the young Brazil striker Robinho came over to shake hands with the magician from Marseilles, Zidane embraced him for a long time and a then patted him on his back. 

 Most disappointing moment: 

Players and officials of Germany and Argentina clashing with each other on the pitch which was shown live on television world over, was the poorest advertisement of the game. 

 Match with maximum turnout: 

 80,000 at Berlin (Argentina vs Germany). 

Most yellow cards in a match: 16 in Portugal vs The Netherlands (Portugal 9, The Netherlands 7). 

Most red cards in a match: Four in Portugal vs The Netherlands (Portugal 2, The Netherlands 2). 

Total yellow cards: 335 (258 in group league, 77 in knock-out) 

Total red cards: 27 (18 in group league, nine in knock-out) 

 Total goals scored: 135 (117 in group league, 18 in 

 knock-out)

 Aussies spy game botched 

Sydney: A TV blackout has thwarted 

 Australias efforts to pick on the strengths and weaknesses 

 of Mahendra Singh Dhoni ahead of their crunch ICC Champions 

 Trophy clash against India. Dhoni is one of the few players 

 about the Aussies know little. 

Coach John Buchanan was eager to watch Dhonis stint in the middle against the West Indies in Ahmedabad and had assigned teams analyst Richard McInness to record his 51-run innings. 

But a short-circuit which led to their hotels cable television failure threw a spanner in their work. Dhoni was the one player we really wanted to see, Buchanan was quoted as saying in an Australian daily. 

 That leaves Australia with the experience of having 

 bowled to the wicketkeeper-batsman in the tri-series in 

 Malaysia as their only source of information about him. 

 Miandad demand 

Karachi: Former Test captain Javed Miandad has called for the Pakistan team coach and selectors to be given more power after the sides humiliating 124-run defeat against South Africa in the Champions Trophy. Pakistan were dismissed for just 89 runs in the must-win tie against South Africa, who moved into the semi-finals with the win in Mohali on Friday. 

The cricket board must give more authority to the coach and selectors to have a say in all matters to reduce the influence of the players, Miandad said on Saturday. 

Miandad said there was also a need for appointing a former player as an advisor. The West Indies have done well since Clive Lloyd was named team advisor. We should also follow their example to support the coach.

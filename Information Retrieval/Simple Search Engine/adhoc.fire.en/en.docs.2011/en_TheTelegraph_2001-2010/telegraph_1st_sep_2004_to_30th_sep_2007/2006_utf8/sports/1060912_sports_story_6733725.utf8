 Samresh betters Olympic mark 

 - DOHA GAMES TRIALS

Indore: Ace marksman Samresh Jung shot better than Olympic mark to win the 10m air pistol event at the shooting selection trials for the Asian Games on Monday. 

Jungs score of 691.6 (591+100.6) saw him come first by more than a margin of ten points and was the highest by an Indian so far. 

The Delhi shooter shot a series of 98, 99, 99, 100, 99 and 96 to tally 591 in the qualifications and then shot 100.6 in the final.

 Blackburn beat Chelsea

 - Hamburg win to keep pressure on Bayern 

London: A header from Steven Reid secured Blackburn Rovers a spot in next seasons Uefa Cup with a 1-0 victory over English champions Chelsea on Tuesday. 

Blackburns victory handed Chelsea ? who secured their second successive Premier League title on Saturday ? their fourth league defeat of the season and sparked huge celebrations at a packed Ewood Park. 

Reids 43rd minute effort moved sixth-placed Blackburn to 60 points and ensured their nearest rivals Newcastle United, who are on 55, cannot overtake them with only one game remaining. 

Two minutes before the break, Reid claimed the only goal of the match in bizarre circumstances. His teammate Robbie Savage had appeared to have directed a spectacular curling free kick from the left side of the box into the bottom corner of the net. 

But Reid was quick to point out that he was the last man to have had any contact with the ball, jumping up from the crowded area in the box to nod in the header. 

Unaware Reid had got the final touch, Savage rushed to rejoice with the fans and was shown a yellow card for his over-zealous celebrations. Reid limped off in the 70th minute and had to be substituted . 

Meanwhile in Berlin, Hamburg SV kept up the pressure on Bayern Munich down the home stretch of the season with a 1-0 win at Cologne on Tuesday that cut the Bundesliga leaders margin on top to just two points. 

An own-goal by Colognes Lukas Sinkiewicz in the third minute made the difference for Hamburg. The Germany defender deflected a cross from Irans Mehdi Mahdavikia past his own goalkeeper Alexander Bade.

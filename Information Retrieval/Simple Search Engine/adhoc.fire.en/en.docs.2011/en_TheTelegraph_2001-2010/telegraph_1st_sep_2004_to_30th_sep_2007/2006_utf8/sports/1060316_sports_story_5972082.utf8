 Local Thriller for Arisen Cup 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: It may pay to follow the ring favourites in Thursdays seven-event race card. The likes of Local Thrillers, Silver Greys, Lasting Loves and Traditional Styles are expected to start as favourites, in their respective events, and they may give good account of themselves. 

 Local Thriller is in good form and hardly penalised for his last impressive victory. A syndicated property of trainer Javed Khans schoolmates, the four-year-old, in the 2,000m Arisen Cup, just needs to beat Grand Ceremony who was a poor fourth in their last clash.

 Jockey Imran Chisty is the other one who could be followed to profit. All his four rides in the card appear to be well-prepared, and his power-packed jockeyship may see him among winners.Read as: Sl. nos, last 4 runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:

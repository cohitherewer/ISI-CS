 Tie vs Pak at Brabourne

 - DAVIS CUP

New Delhi: The Brabourne Stadium of Cricket Club of India (CCI) in Mumbai is set to host Indias Davis Cup tie against Pakistan after captain Leander Paes opted for grass as the surface for the Asia-Oceania group I first round relegation play-off tie from April 7-9. 

The AITA has already received CCIs acceptance to host the tie and the decision would be formalised after secretary Anil Khanna meets the clubs president Raj Singh Dungarpur. 

Paes himself had personally inspected the venue a few days ago before endorsing the AITA decision. 

An AITA team is said to inspect the centre on Saturday before taking a final decision, but it would be a formality. 

We have not thought about any other centre so far, Khanna said.

 3 WI players down with viral fever

Jaipur: The West Indies had a fitness cloud hanging over them with three of their players, including vice-captain Ramnaresh Sarwan, suffering from viral fever ahead of their qualifying fixture against Bangladesh on Wednesday. 

Sarwan and Runako Morton were on the mend, having contracted the virus a day before their first match against Zimbabwe in Ahmedabad, while Dwayne Smith was the third victim of the bug, the West Indies media manager Imran Khan said. 

Sarwan and Morton are recovering well. Smith has been advised to sit out of the practice session but at this stage no player has been ruled out, Khan said on the eve of the match. 

The West Indies, the title-holders, are one win away from entering the tournament proper following the crushing win over Zimbabwe on Sunday. (PTI)

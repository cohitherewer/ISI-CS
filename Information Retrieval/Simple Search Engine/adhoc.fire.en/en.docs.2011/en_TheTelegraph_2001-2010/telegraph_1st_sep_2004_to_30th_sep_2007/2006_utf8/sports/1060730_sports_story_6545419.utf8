 No music for Souravs ears

John Wrights book Indian Summers was released in New Zealand on Thursday. Sourav Ganguly features prominently in it, not all of which will be music for the former India captains ears. 

As much as I respect Sourav and acknowledge his record as captain and contribution to cricket, I believe there were sound arguments for a change in leadership towards the end of my stint, Greg Chappells predecessor has written in the book. 

 Criticising Sourav for masterminding 

 the appointment of Sunil Gavaskar, Wright says: If 

 the captain decides to bring someone into the camp two days 

 before a Test against the best team in the world, theres 

 not a hell of a lot you can do about it.

 Jayawardene century frustrates England

London: Sri Lanka captain Mahela Jaywardene completed his 14th Test century and his second at Lords on Sunday with an innings of monumental patience on the Day IV of the first Test against England. 

Jayawardene, who was dropped by Andrew Strauss at third slip after scoring 58, reached his century through four overthrows from Sajid Mahmood after more than five hours at the crease. 

At tea, which was taken 32 minutes early when bad light stopped play, Sri Lanka were 339 for five. They had begun the day on 183 for three still needing 176 to make England bat again. 

Jayawardene added 130 from 246 balls for the fourth wicket with nightwatchman Fervez Mahroof who looked as if he planned to emulate Australias Jason Gillespie by scoring a double hundred. 

Mahroof was also dropped, by by Paul Collingwood at third slip off Andrew Flintoff.

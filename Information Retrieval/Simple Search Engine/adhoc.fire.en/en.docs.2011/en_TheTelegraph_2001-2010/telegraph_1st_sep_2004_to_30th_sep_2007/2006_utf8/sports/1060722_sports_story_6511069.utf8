 Shoaib 

Islamabad: Fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar has recovered from a stress fracture to his ankle and is likely to be available for the third Test against England, a Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) official said on Friday. 

Shoaibwas originally omitted from the touring squad because of fitness concerns that have kept him out of the side since February. 

(Shoaib) had a meeting with the team physiotherapist and trainer in England on Thursday and they reported he was physically strong now and looking good for a comeback in a weeks time, PCB director Abbas Zaidi said. 

The third Test begins at Headingley from August 4. 

Zaidi said Shoaib was with his County side Warwickshire, where he was undergoing a rehabilitation programme and would play a couple of games for them.

 Greig: Aussie sledging worst 

Sydney: Former England captain and veteran broadcaster Tony Greig has slammed the Australians for their rampant sledging during the second Test against South Africa. 

Greig, who was addressing a lunch function for a Johannesburg cricket club, said he was stunned to hear the extent of Australias sledging on the last day of the Test which ended in controversial circumstances. 

Shane Warne, for one, was heard to call Andre Nel a soft c--- and a f------ dill in South Africas first innings. 

But Greig said Australias sledging extended beyond that on the final day of the match which South Africa lost by 112 runs. 

I have never heard anything like it, Greig was quoted as saying in a newspaper. 

I thought it might have something to do with the fact that we had a very, very good stump mike. We turned that stump mike up and we could hear every word out in the centre and it was unbelievable. 

The whole thing is getting out of hand and the time has seriously come for the authorities to start rethinking the question of what players are allowed to say on the field, said the former player who himself was notorious in his playing days for his talking on the field.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 He shouldve 

 played much more for India

 TRIBUTES TO HANUMANT

 Mumbai: 

 As the news of Hanumant Singhs death spread, condolences 

 and tributes flowed in from the cricketing fraternity. They 

 felt Chhotu (Hanumants nickname) should have played 

 more than 14 Tests.

 Here are excerpts from what his 

 one-time teammates and others had to say (alphabetically):

 RAJ SINGH DUNGARPUR: I 

 am rushing for the funeral (from Dungarpur). I am not in 

 a frame of mind to talk now.

 BAPU NADKARNI: Hanumant 

 was the most unlucky cricketer and should have played much 

 more for India. He would have been the ideal batsman against 

 pace bowling on the 1967-68 tour of Australia, especially 

 after the way he played against them at home (1964). He 

 missed out as he was strangely declared medically unfit 

 for that tour due to a knee bruise but went on to play 10 

 more years in domestic cricket. Chhotu was a gentleman to 

 the core with a deep knowledge of the game. He had a natural 

 grace. Like Rusi Modi, he was poetry in motion while batting.

 PERCY SONN (ICC president): 

 I am deeply shocked and saddened to hear this news and 

 would like to take this opportunity to pass on my sincere 

 condolences to Hanumants family and friends. People 

 like Hanumant are the lifeblood of our sport who first entertain 

 as players and then give something back to the game after 

 they finish playing.

 AJIT WADEKAR: Hanumant 

 was one of the finest batsmen I played with or against. 

 He had all the strokes. He was a perfect team man. I wish 

 he had played more Test cricket. He was our (Bombay and 

 West Zone) major thorn representing Rajasthan and Central 

 Zone. We knew if we could get him, the rest would follow. 

 I and Hanumant joined the SBI on the same day, August 8, 

 1965. We were a close-knit group of five Hanumant, Budhi 

 (Kunderan), Baloo (Gupte), Jimmy (Sharad) Diwadkar, and 

 I. We were always together. Of the lot, I am the only one 

 left... Very sad. He was very serious about the game throughout, 

 even after he retired, and was involved in coaching. He 

 was a very knowledgeable cricketer.

 UP enter final

 Kaif hit 64 

Mumbai: Uttar Pradesh, led from the front by captain Mohammed Kaif, defeated former champions Mumbai by five wickets to storm into the Ranji Trophy elite group final at the Wankhede Stadium here on Monday. 

Requiring 214 for victory, Uttar Pradesh, who were 39 for one overnight, reached the target half an hour before tea on the fourth day. 

UPs passage to the championship round was facilitated by 36-time champions Mumbais shoddy fielding this morning, as Kaif (64) and Suresh Raina (44) enjoyed reprieves to steer their side to a well-deserved win. 

Kaif was on 17 when he was dropped by Vinit Indulkar at long-on off mediumpacer Avishkar Salvi, with Uttar Pradesh on 54 for two.

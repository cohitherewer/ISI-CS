 Anju focus on World Cup, Doha

New Delhi: Anju Bobby George said on Tuesday she had put the disappointment of missing out on a Commonwealth Games medal behind her and had set her sights on the World Cup and the Doha Asian Games later this year. 

Anju, who finished a disappointing sixth at the Melbourne Games which concluded on Sunday, said although a medal eluded her Down Under, she was confident of her form and of winning a medal in the upcoming international events. 

This is not the end of the season. As we go on, our rhythm improves, Anju said on arrival from Australia Tuesday night. 

Even though I did not get a medal, I am improving and am confident of getting a medal in future events. I am aiming at the World Cup in Greece and the Doha Games (in December), said Anju, who was accompanied by her husband-coach Robert Bobby George. 

Anju, a bronze-medallist at the Manchester Commonwealth Games in 2002, said things simply did not go her way in Melbourne. 

I could not find my rhythm, it was not my day, she said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Someday somebody will get 500 somewhere...

 - SA coach Mickey Arthur admits it was crazy 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Mickey Arthur 

 Calcutta: Some 20 hours 

 after his team created history, South Africas young 

 coach Mickey Arthur ? hes just 37 ? acknowledged getting 

 past Australias 434 for four (at the Wanderers on 

 Sunday) had been crazy. 

 We set targets, the first 

 of which was to reach at least 180 by the end of 25 overs... 

 Actually, we touched 229 for two! From then on, it was crazy... 

 It was unbelievable... Fact, however, is that wed 

 never lost self-belief, Arthur, less than a year into 

 the job, told The Telegraph. 

Speaking from Johannesburg, he added: Were still over the moon... Please allow us that... But, come Tuesday, well begin focusing on the three-Test series (which starts in Cape Town on Thursday)... We know Australia must be itching to hit back hard... 

Thats why a formal celebration has been put on hold ? what happened in the dressing room was impromptu. 

According to Arthur, who succeeded Ray Jennings, the stunning win was no fluke but the result of good cricket in recent weeks. He said: Weve got a settled one-day team and the boys have played good cricket over the past few weeks. 

But, now, wont the pressure be even more? 

Arthur laughed: Yeah, thats something weve got to contend with... I also realise expectations with regard to the 2007 World Cup are going to increase... Our planning is towards that tournament... But, then, pressure goes with the territory and weve got to stay focused on the processes put in place. 

Reflecting on the classic, which produced as many as 872 runs (another record), Arthur remarked: The captain (Graeme Smith) led from the front and, then, (Herschelle) Gibbs produced one of the all-time epics... Those at the Wanderers were privileged... Frankly, its difficult describing Gibbs effort... 

Smith, who opens, smashed 90. Then, Gibbs made mincemeat of the attack ? 175 (his 16th ODI hundred), to give the world champions the biggest shock after Bangladesh upset them in England last summer. 

Once banned for getting involved with the late Hansie Cronje, Gibbs is now the toast of South Africa. The one-time problem child is, quite clearly, on his way to being saluted as one of the great one-day batsmen. 

With the 400-barrier having been broken twice on the same day, getting to 500 isnt any longer an impossibility. Arthur concurred, emotionally. 

Yes, someday somebody will get 500 somewhere... After yesterday, thats not totally out of reach... Hopefully, my team is going to do it... Ill be keeping fingers crossed... Praying for my boys, too... 

 The other teams are going to be praying as well. For 

 a different reason, of course.

 This World Cup will be remembered for Zidane

Every player ? no matter how big or small a name he is ? has to time his retirement. When Zinedine Zidane decided to call it quits at club football a couple of months back, he must not have thought his international career would come to an end in such an awe-inspiring manner. This man has given the world everything, and what a time to leave the pitch forever! 

Whatever the outcome of Sundays final, this World Cup will always be remembered for Zidane and how he played catalyst in Frances unbelievable turnaround from the pit of hopelessness. This is as much a rebirth for Les Bleus 

I think before Zidane, only the great Maradona could single-handedly inspire a team in this scintillating fashion in the World Cup (1986). Maradona couldnt repeat his magic in the 1990 final. But Zidane ? already a hero of the 1998 final ? has still another shot at excelling over his legendary predecessor. 

Just a few days ago, everything was looking bleak and gloomy on the French horizon. Switzerland held them goalless, and South Korea forced them to settle for a 1-1 truce in the next match. A suspended Zidane had to watch from sidelines his teams battle for survival against Togo. The 2-0 win over the African debutants in their last group match eventually paved the way for Frances marvellous and mindboggling journey towards the final frontier of the games ultimate prize. 

Zidane ? with his ego bruised and pride battered ? took the centrestage after that and there was no looking back. He suddenly rediscovered his magic and France started basking in a new-found self-belief. 

Against the Brazilians, he was simply majestic. His vision, command and leadership was so ethereal that even the five-time champions were reduced to the status of side-characters, watching in awe the protagonist igniting the stage on his own term. 

If this was Zidane the beautiful, the world did see Zidane the bold in the semi-finals against Luis Felipe Scolaris Portugal. Henrys dubious fall might have influenced the referee to award the penalty for France, but taking it at that time with so much at stake required real character and courage. 

Italy look like the team to regain the glory after 24 years, but with Zidane around, they cant take anything for granted. He represents the soul of Frances journey from the wobbly to the wonder. Even if France lose, Zidane will be remembered as the winner of this World Cup. When a legend retires, he always leaves a sense of loss. It is cliched but I cant help but describe it in the same old way: The world will never be the same without Zidane. 

A small wish in the end. When Pele retired after winning the 1970 World Cup, he went to the US and played for Cosmos, along with other legends like Beckenbauer. Their aim at popularising the game in the US have borne fruit today as the country of baseball and NBA is a regular feature in World Cup finals. Just the other day, Fifa president Sepp Blatter insisted that India should play in the World Cup finals. Zidane, will you do a Pele for us Indians?

 India slip to sixth place in ODI list 

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: Indias 0-4 drubbing by South Africa in the ODI series has had its toll on the LG ICC ODI Championship table. 

According to an ICC release, Rahul Dravid amp; Co. have slipped to the sixth position in the table, which is their lowest ranking for more than a year. 

The last time India were lower than this in the ODI Championship table was in October 2005 when they languished in seventh position. 

Interestingly, if the West Indies win the series against Pakistan starting in Rawalpindi on Tuesday, even by one match, India will be back down to that lowly position. 

It may be recalled that Team India lay third in the table at the end of April, just three rating points behind South Africa. 

But since then, they have come up trumps in only three of their last 17 matches (with 12 losses and two no results). 

The ODI series win against India, on the other hand, has helped South Africa strengthen their second position. Graeme Smiths team is now hot on the trail of Australia. 

If Ricky Pontings side stutter in the tri-series with England and New Zealand in the New Year and South Africa do well in their five-match series with Pakistan in February, they could go into next years ICC Cricket World Cup as the top ranked ODI team. 

Shaun Pollock, who was adjudged as the Man of the Series in the ODIs against India, has moved to fourth best bowling rating of all time. 

The 33-year-old is now a remarkable 111 ratings points ahead of his nearest competitor on the top ODI bowlers list. 

Michael Hussey of Australia and Chris Gayle of the West Indies are on top of the batsmens and allrounders lists, respectively.

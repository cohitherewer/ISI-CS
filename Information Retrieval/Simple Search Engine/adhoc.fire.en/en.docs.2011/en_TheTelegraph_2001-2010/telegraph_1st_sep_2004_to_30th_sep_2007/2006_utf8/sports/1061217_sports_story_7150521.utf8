The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Itll be interesting seeing just how many players turn up

 - A TELEGRAPH EXCLUSIVE 

 - Barry Richards for Heritage Test to determine 

 who stands where 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Barry Richards

Johannesburg: The legendary Barry Richards is most concerned about the lack of quality bowlers coming through and the top reason, in his view, is that cricket has become so heavily loaded in favour of batsmen. In his opinion, who stands where would definitely be known after a Heritage Test. He said so in a chat with The Telegraph on Saturday. 

The following are excerpts: 

On the real test for todays cricketers, particularly the batsmen 

What I would call a Heritage Test between the current No.1 team, Australia, and the Rest of World... The match, of course, has to be played under special conditions. Otherwise, no purpose is going to be served. 

On the special conditions 

For one, except the thigh pad, the batsmen wont be allowed any protective gear which isnt routine. So, no helmets... Then, the wicket cant be docile and the boundaries must not be pulled in. It will be interesting seeing just how many players turn up for the Heritage Test. 

On the ideal venue 

(Grins) Perth, provided the WACA ground can have the wicket it had between 1970-75... That would test the batsmen and give the best indication of how good some actually are. 

On his Rest of World 

I would open with Chris Gayle and Andrew Strauss, followed by Jacques Kallis, Sachin Tendulkar, Brian Lara, Kevin Pietersen, Kumar Sangakkara, Andrew Flintoff, Muttiah Muralidharan, Shane Bond and either Shaun Pollock or Monty Panesar... Others in the squad would be Rahul Dravid, Mohammed Yousuf and Makhaya Ntini... Steve Harmison and Mark Boucher have narrowly missed out. 

On the captain 

Lara. 

On the coach 

One wouldnt be needed. 

Finally, on whether his Rest of World could beat Australia 

 They could... Equally, the Heritage Test 

 may end in a draw...

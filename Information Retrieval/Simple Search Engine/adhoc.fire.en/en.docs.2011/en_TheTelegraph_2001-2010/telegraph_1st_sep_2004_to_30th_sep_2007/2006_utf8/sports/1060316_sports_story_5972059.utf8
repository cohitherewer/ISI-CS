Cape Town: South Africa go into the Test series on a wave of euphoria following their astonishing series-clinching win in the fifth one-day International in Johannesburg on Sunday. 

Australia scored a world record 434 for four, but South Africa replied with 438 for nine to win with a ball to spare. South African coach Mickey Arthur said his team would take the confidence they generated on Sunday into the Test series. 

 What it has done for us as a team is huge, Arthur told a news conference. We have talked about playing brave cricket and the guys had to be brave. It made us all realise just what could be achieved. 

The first Test against begins in Cape Town on Thursday. South Africa have recalled left-arm spinner Nicky Boje for the series after off-spinner Johan Bothas action was ruled illegal by the ICC. 

Arthur said the presence of a spinner in the attack was important for more than the obvious reasons. Our fast bowlers are feeling the effects of not playing a spinner at times in Australia and theyve had a heavy workload, he said. 

He also said the South Africans wouldnt be distracted by Warne and his comments, especially those made about captain Graeme Smith. 

We dont really want to mention his name any more, he said. 

Warne said after his arrival in South Africa that Smith had made a fool of himself on South Africas recent tour of Australia when he suggested Warne was undermining Australian captain Ricky Ponting because of frustration at not having been given the job himself. 

On Sunday, before the ODI began, Warne said South Africas performance in Australia had been the worst by a South African side in that country. All Graeme Smith did was say some ridiculous stuff, he said. 

Arthur said on Wednesday: Hes come out and made statements again against Graeme. Thats probably a go back at what happened in Australia. Thats fine. Were finished talking about Shane Warne. Weve got Test matches to win and hes not going to bother us. 

Smith said Warne would be vital to Australias cause. 

Shane is a world-class performer and you do need to give him a lot of respect for the way he performs, he said.

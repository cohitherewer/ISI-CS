 He who cant stand the heat should stay out

 - Sunil Gavaskar ridicules suggestions of excessive cricket 

 Gavaskar says he would be willing to sweat it out for 365 days 

New Delhi: Sunil Gavaskar has ridiculed suggestions that excessive cricket was burning players out, saying those who could not stand the heat should stay out. 

Gavaskar, who is also the chairman of ICCs cricket committee, said he was surprised at cricketers complaining about the calender as representing ones country was an honour. 

I cant see the problem, these players are turning out for their countries, its an honour to represent your country. I would be willing to sweat 365 days in a year for India. Those who cant stand the heat should stay out, Gavaskar said on a television programme. 

The former India captain was reacting to recent reports of a possible strike by international cricketers if the ICC did not reduce the number of matches. 

Were frustrated, were concerned and were disappointed that the ICC and member countries arent abiding by principles that are supposed to be abided by in the scheduling of tours, Tim May, the president of the Federation of International Cricketers Association, was quoted as saying in the Australian media. 

Its a revenue-raising frenzy. Its pushing the players into a position where theyre just going to say, no, its too much, were walking away from this, were not going to play in these games, May said. 

Guys start going through the motions. Their bodies are extremely fatigued. They just cant keep doing it. Some players are already making a stand... he said.

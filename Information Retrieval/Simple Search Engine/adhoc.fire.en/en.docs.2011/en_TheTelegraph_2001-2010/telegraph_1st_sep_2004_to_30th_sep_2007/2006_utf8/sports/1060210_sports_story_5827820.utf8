The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Appeal not in good taste, says Amarnath

A STAFF REPORTER

 Mohinder Amarnath 

Calcutta: Former India allrounder Mohinder Amarnath feels Team India captain Rahul Dravid shouldnt have appealed against his Pakistan counterpart Inzamam-ul Haq during the first one-day International in Peshawar on Monday. 

The ball would neither have hit the stumps nor did Inzamam try to stop it deliberately, Amarnath said after landing in the city on Thursday. 

I honestly feel that the Indian captains appeal was not in good taste. There was no need for him to appeal, Amarnath told The Telegraph. 

According to the former Indian stalwart, the incident may end up affecting the cordial relationship among players of both countries in the forthcoming matches. Something may happen against the spirit of the game as the players may react to very minor matters, he stated. 

Amarnath, the second cricketer to be dismissed for a similar offence, clearly stood by the Pakistan captain, saying: it was really hard luck for Inzamam. 

The former member of the World Cup-winning side, here to conduct a coaches seminar at the Eden on Friday, felt that Sourav Ganguly has it in him to make a comeback in the ODI side. 

He is only 32, and can make it to the squad any day, he said. 

Since the team has been doing pretty well in the last few series, he didnt get a berth, but that doesnt mean that it is the end of the road for him, Amarnath said.

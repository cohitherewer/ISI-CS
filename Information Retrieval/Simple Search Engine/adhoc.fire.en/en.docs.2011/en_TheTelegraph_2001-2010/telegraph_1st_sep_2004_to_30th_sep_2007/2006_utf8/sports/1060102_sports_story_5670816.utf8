 Proper coaching system needed: Cash

Chennai: Former Wimbledon champion Pat Cash on Sunday said a proper coaching system has to be in place in both India and his country, Australia, for producing world class players and enable them shine on the world tennis scene. 

Speaking this afternoon after his practice session with Karan Rastogi, whom he is partnering in the Chennai Open, Cash said, Australia is now facing the same problem that India has been for a few years earlier. A proper coaching system has to be in place for producing world class players. 

The Australian referred to Leander Paes role in helping India in Davis Cup for over 15 years now and said, we face a similar problem in Australia too. We are yet to produce another Lleyton Hewitt. 

On his pairing with Rastogi in doubles, Cash said, When I won Wimbledon (1987), Karan must have been in his nappies. It is going to be an excellent opportunity for him. I hope he will be able to learn a few things playing alongside me. 

Cash, here as a commentator, decided to pair with Rastogi only on arrival on Saturday and the pair was given a wild card entry. 

On Sania Mirza, Cash said: History shows it is difficult to maintain ones position on the ranking list. I have seen her play in Wimbledon. She has the potential to make it big. But her success will depend on her maintaining her form and the current status of being No. 34 in the world, he said. (PTI)

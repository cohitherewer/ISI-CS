The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 BCCI may have to amend constitution

 Calcutta: The 

 Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) may have to 

 amend its constitution technically, Memorandum and Rules 

 and Regulations to allow one of the five senior selectors 

 sit on the tour selection committee. 

At the moment, the relevant clause 32 (A) (II) reads: When the team is on tour abroad, the cricket manager (coach), the captain and the vice-captain shall form the selection committee and the manager will be the convenor of the committee. 

Earlier this year, the BCCI began the practice of having one of the selection committee members present (by rotation) at every Test and ODI on major tours. 

While nobody has been assigned for the ODIs in South Africa, chairman Dilip Vengsarkar is going to be there (as of now) for the first two Tests. Who will replace him for the third and final one isnt clear. 

The decision to specifically send Vengsarkar, a former captain, was taken by president Sharad Pawar on Friday mor- ning. 

With the president likely to make it mandatory for one selector to be present at any point in time, the constitution probably has to be amended. For, strictly constitution-ally, a selector cant join the tour selection committee, a well-placed source told The Telegraph. 

According to him, thus far, the BCCI had only been formally intimating the manager about the presence of somebody from the selection committee. 

Thats going to be followed in Vengsarkars case, too, but such an arrangement cant continue for long. It definitely wont be proper, he added. 

It will be interesting to see how the BCCI takes this selector-on-tour bit forward.

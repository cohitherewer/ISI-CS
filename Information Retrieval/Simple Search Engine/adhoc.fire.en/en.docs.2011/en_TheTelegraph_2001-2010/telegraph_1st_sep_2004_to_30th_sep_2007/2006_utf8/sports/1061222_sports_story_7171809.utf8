 Drogba strikes in Chelsea win

 - European Round-up

 Inter register 10th successive victory 

London: Substitute Didier Drogba bent in a free-kick to give Chelsea a 1-0 win at Newcastle United in the League Cup quarter finals on Wednesday while Tottenham Hotspur needed extra-time to beat second division Southend United 1-0. 

Chelsea, who brought on Drogba, Frank Lampard and Michael Ballack in the second half, broke the deadlock on 79 minutes when the Ivory Coast striker scored from the edge of the area after Arjen Robben had been fouled. 

Newcastle striker Obafemi Martins had come within a whisker of opening the scoring on 27 minutes when his superb 25m shot hit the underside of the bar and bounced off the line. Andriy Shevchenko came close for Chelsea on the stroke of half time when his angled drive clipped the far post while Lampard also struck the woodwork with a chip in stoppage time. 

Tottenham were given a scare by second division bottom club Southend, who beat Manchester United 1-0 in the previous round. 

The first 90 minutes at White Hart Lane ended goalless and it was another 25 minutes before England striker Jermain Defoe scored the winner from a Mido pass. Liverpools tie with Arsenal was postponed because of fog and has been rearranged for January 9. 

In Spain, Primera Liga leaders Sevilla crushed Deportivo Coruna 4-0 on Wednesday while Real Madrid suffered an embarrassing 0-3 home defeat by Recreativo Huelva in their final game before the Christmas break. 

Reals defeat was overshadowed by the death of three visiting fans and the driver after a supporters coach crashed on the way to the game. 

In Italy, Inter Milan claimed their 10th consecutive League triumph on Wednesday, a 2-0 win at Lazio maintaining their seven-point lead in Serie A. Goals from Esteban Cambiasso and Marco Materazzi secured victory for Roberto Mancinis side, who had Sweden striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic sent off. 

Inters first win at Lazio for more than 10 years was set up when Hernan Crespo did well to slip the ball into the path of fellow Argentine Cambiasso to score after 39 minutes.Second-placed AS Roma kept up the chase with a 2-1 win at Torino. 

Palermo, 11 points adrift of Inter in third place, crushed Ascoli 4-0 while Brazilian Kaka scored twice as AC Milan beat Catania 3-0 .

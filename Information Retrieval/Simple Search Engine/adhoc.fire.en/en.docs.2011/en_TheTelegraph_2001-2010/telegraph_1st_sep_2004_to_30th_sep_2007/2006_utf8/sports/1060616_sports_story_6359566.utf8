 Mexico, Angola face striking problem 

 - We are confident of reaching the semi-finals, says captain Marquez 

Hanover: Mexico and Angola have problems up front ahead of their World Cup clash on Friday and whichever team finds a solution should come out on top. 

The Mexicans scored three goals in their opening group D match against Iran despite an injury to talismanic striker Jared Borgetti. 

Borgetti is expected to miss the remaining group games and coach Ricardo La Volpe is expected to push Omar Bravo, who hit two goals against Iran, further forward to partner Guillermo Franco in a 5-3-2 line-up. 

Jared is a loss to any team but we have plenty of faith in our other strikers, captain Rafael Marquez told reporters. 

We scored three against Iran and Jared didnt score any of them, thats a signal of what the others are capable of. They are quality players and will do us proud. 

Debutants Angola also have concerns in attack, having created few chances in their 0-1 defeat by Portugal last Sunday. 

Captain and lone striker Akwa has appealed to coach Luis Oliveira Goncalves to change tactics and play a second man up front. 

We have Mantorras, Flavio, Andre Titi Buengo, Love, Mateus. I dont care who it is, he said earlier this week. 

But after going down by a single goal against fancied Portugal, Goncalves is unlikely to change his strategy. 

The performance has given us confidence for the next game, even though it was a defeat, said keeper Joao Ricardo. 

I think we will be a little more ambitious, a little more positive against Mexico. 

Mexico are in buoyant mood after their 3-1 victory over Iran. 

We are confident we can reach at least the semi-finals, Marquez said. Reaching the last 16 will not be good enough. 

Mexico already have matched their previous victory total at the World Cup in Europe. Doubling it would virtually send El Tri to the second round for the fourth straight time. 

Before Sundays 3-1 win over Iran, Mexico had one win, five draws and five losses in four European World Cup excursions. 

A victory against Angola on Friday in Hanover would give the Mexicans six points ? which would guarantee a second-round berth if favourites Portugal win or draw against Iran on Saturday. Mexico close out group play against Portugal on Wednesday in Gelsenkirchen. 

All the games are important, defender Gonzalo Pineda said. But this one, we can make the difference by getting six points. 

In France in 1998, the last time the World Cup was held in Europe, Mexico opened with a 3-1 victory over South Korea. The team drew against Belgium and the Netherlands before losing 1-2 to Germany in the second round. 

Mexico went undefeated in pool play in Korea and Japan in 2002, opening with victories over Croatia and Ecuador before drawing against Italy and losing 0-2 to the United States in the second round. 

Starting 2-0 this time will mean doing something else Mexico have never accomplished ? beating an African team in World Cup play. 

In their only World Cup meeting against an African opponent, Mexico lost 1-3 to Tunisia in 1978 in Argentina. El Tri have never played Angola at any level. 

The Black Antelopes, making their first World Cup trip, are ranked 57th by Fifa ? second-lowest among the 32 World Cup teams ahead of only No. 63 Togo. They lost 0-1 to Portugal in their opener. 

Portugal, Mexico and Iran have already been at the World Cup for a long time, defender Jamba said. Were doing everything to see if we can at least win one game.

 Sourav (89 n.o.) steers Bengal to semi-finals

 - Ranadeb (5/34), Sanjib (4/45) restrict Punjab 

 Sanjib (Top) and 

 Ranadeb were in devastating form

Kanpur: Sourav Ganguly returned to form with an unbeaten 89 to lead Bengal to a stunning four-wicket win over Punjab in a National one-day meet quarter final here on Thursday. 

Ganguly, who has been off colour in the Deodhar Trophy, remained not out on 89 as Bengal overhauled Punjabs total of 229 with more than 11 overs and moved into the semi-finals. 

Subhomoy Das lent valuable support to the former Indian captain with a well-paced 60. 

Bengal, however, owed their victory to pacers Ranadeb Bose (5/34) and Sanjib Sanyal (4/45) who utilised the favourable dismantled the Punjab batting with clinical efficiency. 

Incidentally, Sanyal was axed by the Bengal selectors while announcing the 14-man squad for the meet. Later he was sent immediately after captain Deep Dasgupta personally asked for Sanyal. 

Punjab captain Dinesh Mongias 76 then went in vain. 

Bengal will play in the semi-finals on Monday the winner of Railways and Tamil Nadu match to be played on Friday. 

Bengal were given a fluent start by Das who made his 60 from 78 balls with 10 fours. 

Sourav was content to play the supporting cast in the opening stand with Das, contributing only 15 for the 95-run partnership. 

But Sourav took control after Das departed as he hit 11 fours in his 104-ball knock that lasted 201 minutes. 

Vikram Rajvir Singh bowled with fire and took two wickets in an over to give Punjab some hope but Sourav thwarted their hopes with some dour batting. (PTI)

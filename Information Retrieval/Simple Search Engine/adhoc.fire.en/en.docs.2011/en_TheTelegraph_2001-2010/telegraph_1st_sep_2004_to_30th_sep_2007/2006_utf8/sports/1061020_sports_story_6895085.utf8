 - INDIAN OPEN 

 Vijay Kumar shares lead with Dunn 

 Vijay Kumar shot seven birdies 

New Delhi: Vijay Kumar, who has not played a tournament since May, carded a six-under 66 and was in joint lead on the first day of the $400,000 Hero Honda Indian Open Golf Tournament here on Thursday. 

Sixty six players are yet to complete their first round on account of the more than two-hour delay due to bad weather this morning. 

It was a fine day for the Indians, as the 38-year-old Vijay Kumar, who won the Indian Open here at this same course in 2002, shot seven birdies and just one bogey to lead the field with Simon Dunn at the Delhi Golf Club course. 

There were four others at five-under in tied third place. In the bunch at four-under in tied seventh was Vivek Bhandari, who had one of his best rounds on Asian Tour this season. Among others, he was tied with Simon Dyson (68). 

At three-under 69 were Jyoti Randhawa and SSP Chowrasia, both of whom had one bogey each and four birdies. Amateur Chiragh Kumar, who will play the Asian Games in December, too shot a three-under after starting with an eagle. 

Yusuf Ali, Mukesh Kumar, Firoz Ali and Harinder Gupta were all at two-under 70. 

C. Muniyappa, with two eagles was three-under through 12 holes, was among those who could not complete their round. 

On his good show, Vijay said: I am surprised by my round. I have not played since Aamby Valley Asian Masters and I had not been tested by tournament play. 

Vijay, hailing from Lucknow, was the last local to win the Indian Open in 2002, shot ahead with some intelligent play. He took out his driver only four times and made only one bogey. 

I wanted to play cautious as careless play on this course can be very costly. The course was heavy and I knew even small carelessness could prove costly. I did not really go for any birdies as such, as I wanted to play well and post a decent score on first day. I realised that the second shot and the putting would be crucial, which is what it turned out to be, Vijay said. 

Australian duo of Scott Strange, the Philippines Open winner, and Michael Wright, who is striving hard to keep his card for next year, were tied a spot below as they carded matching 67s alongside New Zealander Brad Iles. 

Also in tied third was Koreas Suk Jong-Yul, who clinched the GS Caltex Maekyung Open in April, as he shot eight birdies against three bogeys. 

Vijay blasted birdies in the first two holes before striking his third birdie at the fourth. Enjoying the smooth momentum on the front nine, Kumar fired three more birdies at the 10th, 11th and 15th holes before dropping a shot at the 16th. He bounced back and closed in strongly with a final birdie at the 18th hole. 

Dunn was also on target with four birdies and ended his round in style with an eagle at the par five 18th hole. 

I could have holed a few more putts but what goes around comes around and I holed one on the last, said Dunn. 

Dunn, till last week I have had a terrible year. He finished third last week behind Campbell and Goosen in Taiwan, but apart from that I only made one other cut all year. His father passed away in August, when he was on his way to Brunei.

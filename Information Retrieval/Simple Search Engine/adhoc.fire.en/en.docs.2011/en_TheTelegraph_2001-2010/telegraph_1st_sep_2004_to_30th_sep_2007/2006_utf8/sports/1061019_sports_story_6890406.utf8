 Inzamam backs Shoaib, Asif

Karachi: Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Asif Wednesday received strong support from regular skipper Inzamam-ul Haq, who said they might have taken the drug by mistake. 

Inzamam also said that both the players were crucial to the teams chances in next years World Cup and this should be kept in mind before handing out any penalty. 

What I believe is they took the substance by mistake in some medication. But hopefully they can prove their innocence because our players dont indulge in these sort of things, said Inzamam, serving a ban from four ODIs for bringing the game into disrepute during The Oval fiasco. 

Pakistan Cricket Board pulled out Shoaib and Asif from the Champions Trophy on Monday and flew them home immediately after announcing that they had tested positive for banned steroid nandrolone in internal tests in September. 

The duo, who have claimed innocence, will now face a disciplinary hearing. 

Inzamam said he hoped the services of the new ball bowlers would be available during World Cup. I dont think they would suffer much and hope they would be available during the World Cup. They are our main hopes in the World Cup.

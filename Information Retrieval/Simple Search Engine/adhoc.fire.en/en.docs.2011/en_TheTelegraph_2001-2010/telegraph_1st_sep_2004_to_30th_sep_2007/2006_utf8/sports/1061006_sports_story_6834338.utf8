 PCA issues threat over Mohali

 - BCCI negotiating with the ICC, says Shah 

A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES

 Calcutta/Mohali: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) on Thursday said they were in talks with the International Cricket Council (ICC) over Punjab Cricket Association (PCA)s refusal to sign the host venue agreement. 

Secretary Niranjan Shah said: Were in talks with the ICC and will try to find a solution soon. The ICC must share some of the revenue with the host venue, he added. 

The ICC said that it had nothing to do with the PCAs refusal to sign the agreement. 

Our agreement is with the BCCI. Were not dealing with any individual association. So weve got nothing to do with the PCA complaint, ICC spokesman Bryan Murgatroyd told The Telegraph. 

With just two days for the Champions Trophy qualifiers to get underway, PCA president Inderjit Singh Bindra said it would not sign the host venue agreement unless the ICC gave a categorical assurance that it would compensate for its losses. 

The PCA warned that it would have no option but to pull out from staging the five matches of the elite event if no such assurance came from the games world governing body who hold most of the rights. 

The Sri Lanka-Bangladesh match is in Mohali on Saturday. 

As of now, the match will go on. Since the ICC is going ahead with the match, this explicitly means that they have accepted our stand, Bindra said. 

The ICC wants us to make certain commitments which we are not ready to accept. We have made our points clear to them, but they have not accepted these conditions in writing. 

If they are not willing to accept PCAs conditions, they are free to stage the matches elsewhere. Either you accept or choose another venue, Bindra said. 

Bindra also said the PCA would incur a loss of about Rs 90 lakh for each match since most of the major rights like television and in-stadia were with the ICC. It is not possible for us to bear such heavy losses. Most of the rights are with them, the only thing we have is the ticket money. 

The PCAs toughening of stand at the last minute was a little surprising considering the fact that the ICC had announced the venues nearly six months back. 

As part of its policy, the ICC had ensured the four venues selected were clean, which meant those stadiums had no contractual in-stadia and hospitality obligations.

 Anand beats Bacrot, on top with Topalov

 - WIJK AAN ZEE MEET

 Humpy outclasses Smeets 

 Viswanathan Anand 

Wijk Aan Zee: Viswanathan Anand came back into reckoning for the top honours with a fine victory over Grandmaster Etienne Bacrot of France in the eighth round of Corus International Chess tournament here. 

The much-needed victory for Anand came at an appropriate time as he joined world champion Veselin Topalov of Bulgaria, who was held by Israeli GM Boris Gelfand, in the lead on 5.5 points. 

Anand had earlier lost the sixth round against Gata Kamsky of United States and drew the next one rather quickly with Michael Adams of England. 

With five more rounds remaining in the category-19 round-robin tournament after the second rest day slated on Monday, Sergey Karjakin is on the sole third spot on five points while Vassily Ivanchuk of Ukraine, Gelfand and Adams are not far behind on 4.5 points. 

The seventh spot is held by Loek van Wely of Holland along with Hungarian Peter Leko and World Cup winner Levon Aronian of Armenia who all are on 3.5 points each. 

In the B group being held simultaneously, Koneru Humpy cruised to a fine victory over Jan Smeets of Holland. 

Playing the white side of an oft repeated variation of the semi Slav Humpy came good in all departments of the game and caught her opponents queen unawares on the queen side to win in 41 moves. 

The Norwegian talent Magnus Carlsen maintained his sole lead in this group after talking a draw with Giovanni Vescove of Brazil. 

Carlsen is on 6.5 points in the event and is currently followed by David Navara of Czech Republic and Vescovi on 5.5 points apiece. 

Anand came back strongly to beat Bacrot in a positional and technical battle. To start the proceedings Anand changed his guard and played the queens Indian defense to get a balanced position in the middle game. 

Bacrot, who had earlier shown intentions of a bloody battle by not opting for a repetition of moves, was in for a surprise as Anand regained his form in quick time and launched a massive onslaught with his minor pieces and rook in the endgame. 

Bacrots king ran for mercy that was not forthcoming thereafter and Anand romped home comfortably after 61 moves. 

Topalov drew with Gelfand in a game when neither player could achieve anything when the dust subsided. For the records it was a long game arising out of a Petroff Defense and Topalov agreed to sign the peace only after 72 moves had been played on board. 

The only other decisive game of the A group was between Levon Aronian and Shakhriyar Mamedyarov of Azerbaijan in which the former came out triumphs after 58 moves of another queens Indian defense.

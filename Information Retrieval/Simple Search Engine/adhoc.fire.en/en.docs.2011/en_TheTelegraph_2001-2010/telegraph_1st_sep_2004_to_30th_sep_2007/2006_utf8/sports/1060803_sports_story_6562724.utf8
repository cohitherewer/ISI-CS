 Aleksie claims Roubaix Cup 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Aleksei, the hot-favourite, faced a spirited challenge from Capture The Moment before winning the 1,400m Roubaix Cup on Wednesday. However, the Razeen-Remembren four-year-old deprived his trainer Vijay Singh the honour of leading in his second winner of the monsoon season as the horse unseated jockey C.Alford and bolted after passing the winning-post.

 The trainer-jockey duo had opened their seasons account when another of stables hot-favourite, Flemenco Star, landed the 1,100m Reliable Plate with a degree of comfort.

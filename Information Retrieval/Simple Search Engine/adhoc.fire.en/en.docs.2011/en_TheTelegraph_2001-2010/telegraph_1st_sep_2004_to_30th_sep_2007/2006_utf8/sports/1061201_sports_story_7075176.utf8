 Houghton frustrated after 1-1 draw 

JAYDEEP BASU

Doha: The huge Flag Plaza at the Asian Games Village was bustling with activity during the welcoming ceremony of the Indian contingent. 

With the Village Mayor, Ahmed A Al Khulaifi himself an enthusiastic participant in the entire ritual, the Indian athletes, comprising boxers, swimmers and tennis players looked an excited lot. 

As Khulafi got up to wish the athletes the Games of their lives, the Indians broke out in a spontaneous cheer. 

The simple and brief ceremony, however, could hardly lift the spirits of the Indian footballers standing in the last row of the contingent. For them the campaign is practically over and all they are here for now is to go through the motions. 

No wonder, the footballers chose to make a quick exit after the flag hoisting ceremony and immediately left for their practice session at the Al-Saad Sports Club. 

Its a strange feeling that while for most of the athletes and many are still arriving it is the beginning of the Games, for the Indian footballers the death knell has been sounded early. 

The drawn encounter against Hong Kong on Wednesday has completely killed Indias chances of making the next round even if they win their next match against the Maldives on Sunday. 

Coach Bob Houghton is quite upset with the way India frittered away the 89th minute lead against Hong Kong. It was simply unacceptable, he said. He has even made it clear that it would be foolish to expect that India had any chance of making the final round of the 2010 World Cup as per the All India Football Federations claims. 

We are not yet ready, the British coach has finally accepted. The 2010 (World Cup finals) is beyond our reach at the moment. All we can do now is to start seriously for the 2014 World Cup. May be India can make an honest effort then. 

Houghtons frustration was quite evident when he said that India are in the Asian Games for the sake of participation only. 

We havent turned too competitive yet. To play against the best in Asia, we got to plan things in a better manner. We may beat the Maldives in the next match, but have little chance to topple Iran. 

Even the Indian skipper Bhaichung Bhutia could say very little when confronted by the media. Perhaps, we need a little more time, he said quickly. The coach should also be given a longer stint.

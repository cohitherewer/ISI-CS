 Chidi scored in extra-time

New Delhi: JCT Mills (Phagwara) made their first Durand Cup final in 10 years after edging out last years finalists Sporting Clube De Goa 1-0 in Saturdays second semi-final. 

The Phagwara millmen, who had stunned East Bengal 4-0 the other day in quarter final group league action, thus ensured there wont be an all-Goa final. 

Edeh Chidi scored three minutes before the end of extra-time after the regulation period of 90 minutes ended in a stalemate. 

Substitute Sukhwinder Singh, who started the move from the right, relayed it to Praveen Kumar who, in turn, tapped the ball for Chidi. The Nigerians powerful shot hit the post before going in.

 Johl tied second, Digvijay 12th

Sanya: Amandeep Johl, buoyed by a chip-in eagle at the 16th, starred in a splendid show by the Indians on the opening day of the $200,000 Crowne Plaza Open at the Yalong Bay Golf Club. 

Johl, who finished in the top-three twice this season, shot a five-under 67 to be in a crowded 10-way tie for second place, two behind 18-year-old Chinarat Phadsungil. 

If Johl sizzled in the afternoon, the morning, from an Indian viewpoint, belonged to Digvijay Singh. 

Third at this event last year, he turned in a flawless five-under 31 for the back nine, but missed a couple of birdie putts before two late bogeys on 15th and 17th set him back. 

But Singh closed with a morale-boosting birdie on ninth to be four-under and in tied 12th place, three off the lead. 

Digvijay, who has played just three rounds of golf in more than two months, took no time in getting rid of the rust, as he made a scintillating start. 

Harmeet Kahlon started with a bogey on second, but recovered with a birdie on fifth and had an eagle two with a perfect approach shot on par-4 seventh as he turned in two-under 34. On the back nine, he dropped a shot on 11th, but birdies on 13th and 16th saw him finish in three-under 69 and in tied 16th place. 

S.S.P. Chowrasia and Rahil Gangjee shot a two-under 70 each to be tied for 22nd, while Gaurav Ghei was one-under 71, as was Gurbaan Mann, who despite a bogey-bogey finish, came with a 71. Both were tied 32nd. (PTI)

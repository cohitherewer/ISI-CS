The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 No cake, no icing... 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Kingston: There was no 

 cake to mark Greg Chappells completion of a year as 

 coach, but had Team India won ODI No.2, one would surely 

 have been arranged and the win would have served as the 

 icing. 

 Well, yes, it would have 

 been like the icing... Perhaps, its not such a bad 

 thing that the defeat came early in the series... There 

 are lessons to learn and, hopefully, theyll be learnt 

 quickly, Chappell told The Telegraph after 

 Saturdays one-run loss. 

Earlier, interacting with the Media at Sabina Park, captain Rahul Dravid said: Working with Greg has been fantastic... The boys have enjoyed it, too... He has brought new ideas... A freshness... And he has given a new perspective to winning and losing... Nowadays, we dont jump up and down after winning and dont panic if we lose... The dressing room is a lot calmer... 

 Chappell, for his part, holds his captain in very 

 high esteem.

 TFA keen on expanding base

 - Decision likely on scouting FOR talent abroad 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: Tata Football Academy (TFA) is yet not sure on their participation in the National Football League (NFL), but the team management is already eager to take advantage of the new players of Indian origin rule to expand the base of the academy. 

According to highly placed sources, the Jamshedpur based academy now might take a policy decision on scouting talents abroad among the children of people of India origin. The feeling is that these children could be moulded into better footballers if they are admitted in the academy at an younger age. 

No decision has been taken in this regard, but we may request our management to take advantage of the rule and scout talent outside India, said an official, who did not wish to be named. It will not only help the clubs to recruit Indian origin players from the TFA, the national team also stands to benefit from this arrangement at all age groups level. 

The All India Football Federation (AIFF) has clarified that the Indian origin players, willing to play in India, need not to necessarily hold Indian passport. The players of Indian origin will be determined as per the Government of India rule, said the AIFF general secretary Alberto Colaco. 

For the people of Indian origin, who reside abroad, the Government issues a People of Indian Origin (PIO) certificate. Any footballer, who wish to play in any Indian club, will have to produce that certificate to the AIFF. Colaco said he would meet the club officials very soon to explain the rule. 

Though the TFA is eager to make use of the PIO rule to strengthen its players bank, it is not yet sure about fielding the side in the NFL. The AIFF president Priya Ranjan Das Munshi has given TFA a deadline till August 15 to explain their position, but the TFA officials are awaiting the arrival of their director Satish Pillai from abroad before taking a decision. 

The problem with TFA is that it may prove to be too late even if they wish to raise a matching professional side to compete in the NFL. With TFA having released all their last seasons players and the transfers are already over, the academy might just struggle to recruit another set of good players. 

The TFA officials, however, are hoping to spot and recruit some good players from the forthcoming Santosh Trophy through the second window transfer if they receive the green signal from the management to build up a professional side. Added with recruits from the Santosh Trophy could be a few good foreign footballers, said a TFA official. That would be a decent side. Otherwise, exposing our juniors to such a tough competition wont be wise.

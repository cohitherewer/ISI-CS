 India pump in nine past Oman

Doha: Indias hopes in mens hockey flickered back to life at the Asian Games after they scored an emphatic 9-0 victory over Oman in a group B league match on Friday. 

The thumping win left the struggling team with an outside chance of securing a place in the semi-finals. 

The Indians did just what was required by scripting a huge victory and now face the Herculean task of putting it across defending champions South Korea by another big margin to remain afloat. 

Forward Shivendra Singh did the star turn for India by pumping in three goals, while Tushar Khandekar and Hari Prasad scored two each. 

Captain Dilip Tirkey and Arjun Halappa chipped in with a goal each to complete the misery for the Oman team who were left clueless at the Al Rayyan Hockey Stadium. 

India were placed third with six points from three matches while Korea topped the group with nine points, followed by China who also have nine. 

India have a goal difference of +14 while Korea have +21, which means that Vasudevan Baskarans men not only have to beat the Koreans on Sunday but also win by a big margin to push China, who have a goal difference of +6, out. 

The Indians shot into the lead in the 11th minute when Shivendra converted a penalty corner and struck two more through Prasad (28th) and Tirkey (34). 

After the break, Shivendra produced a brilliant field goal in the 40th, while Khandekar converted a penalty corner four minutes. 

Prasad made it 6-0 in the 47th.

 1st-class ties to be filmed

Mumbai: Dissatisfied with the system of rating umpires based on captains reports, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has decided to film all first-class domestic matches and some selected junior level matches from the coming season. 

The initiative was based on recommendations of the special committee to assess and grade the umpires, the BCCI said on Wednesday. 

The special committee formed to assess the umpires consisting Srinivas Venkataraghavan, SK Bansal and VK Ramaswamy has recommended this video shoot to help them in grading the umpires , joint secretary M.P. Pandove said.

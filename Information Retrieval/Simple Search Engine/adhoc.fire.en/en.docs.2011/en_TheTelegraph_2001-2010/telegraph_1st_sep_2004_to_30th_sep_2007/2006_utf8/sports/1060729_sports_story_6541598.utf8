The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Fresh twist to CAB elections

 - South Suburban representative restrained from attending AGM 

A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta: Smarting from 

 the loss of two sure votes, during the scrutiny process, 

 challenger Prasun Mukherjees camp has moved to take 

 away one of Jagmohan Dalmiyas voters ? Nirmal Mukherjee 

 of South Suburban Club. 

This, then, is the new twist in the build-up to Sundays AGM of the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB). Dalmiya has been its president for over a decade. 

The latest development took place with S. Chatterjee, acting district judge of Alipore court, passing an interim order on Thursday (which was communicated to Nirmal Mukherjee only on Friday) restraining him from representing the club at the CAB elections. 

The order followed a petition by Debashish Ganguly, who claimed to be South Suburban Clubs general secretary. According to his lawyer Pralay Roy, Nirmal Mukherjee had been allowed to represent the club despite having no locus standi. 

Nirmal Mukherjee, who is known to be close to the Dalmiya camp, is likely to challenge the order on Saturday. 

The city civil court-appointed observer Justice (Retd) Santosh Kumar Phoujdar, it may be recalled, had cancelled the nominations of Bata and Calcutta Rangers on Wednesday. Officials of both clubs had met the observer, on Thursday, but he stuck to his ruling. 

Significantly, challenger Mukherjee, who is the citys police commissioner, had declared on Thursday: All rightful voters can vote fearlessly and secretly on Sunday. The voters, then, had included Nirmal Mukherjee. 

Asked to comment about the South Suburban development, which took place after he had finalised the voters list, Phoujdar simply said: Im yet to receive any papers from the club. Let me get them first, only then can I act. 

Dalmiya, meanwhile, admitted that he had heard the news, but was yet to receive a copy of the court order from any source. The election process is being overseen by a court-appointed observer. So, I cant comment till I get to see the papers, is all that he said. 

In a related development, Nemai Dutta ? who is a candidate for the vice-presidents post on both panels ? has come out in support of challenger Mukherjee. As I was first approached by Prasun Mukherjee to join his team by contesting the vice-presidents post, I have decided to support him and his group, the Howrah Sporting representative said in a press release. 

While its a fact that the Dalmiya group nominated him on its panel, nobody was really looking forward to Duttas vote once the police commissioner paraded him as one of those on his panel. 

Dalmiya had announced his panel a day before challenger Mukherjee did.

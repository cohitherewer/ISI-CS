 Bengal face Railways today

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Bengal are likely to retain the same team that played in the quarter finals when they take on Railways in the semi-finals of the National One-day meet in Lucknow on Sunday. 

Sourav Ganguly will partner Subhamoy Das at the top of the order. Both Sourav and Subhamoy played stellar roles in the quarter final win over Punjab. The match will be another opportunity for Sourav to remind the national selectors of his utility to the side. He had scored an unbeaten 89 against Punjab. 

 In the other semis, UP will take on Baroda . 

Bengal (likely) 

Subhamoy Das, Sourav Ganguly, Avishek Jhunjhunwala, Deep Dasgupta (captain), Rohan Gavaskar, Manoj Tewari, Laxmi Ratan Shukla, Sanjib Sanyal, Sourashish Lahiri, Ranadeb Bose, Shib Shankar Paul. Super sub: Shiv Sagar Singh.

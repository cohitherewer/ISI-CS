 Narain is Williams official test driver

New Delhi: Narain Karthikeyans 

 career received a major fillip after he was appointed as 

 official test driver by Williams Formula One 

 for 2007. 

The Chennai-born Narain will occupy the slot left vacant by Alexander Wurz who got promoted to race driver following the departure of Australian Mark Webber. 

After a roller-coaster debut with Jordan in 2005, which mostly consisted of non-finishes in a ramshackle car, and a season of near-to-nothing as second test driver this year, this would be the right platform for the 29-year old Coimbatore lad to re-launch his Formula One dreams. 

It falls short of being the race driver, but Narain has preferred the hard and long route to success to the easy and short-term option of hitching a ride with a low rung team. 

Naturally as a racing driver, my first priority is to compete. But I would far rather test with a leading team than accept a race seat that offers no real potential to learn and develop, Narain said from his native town. 

 The role of official test driver is a much a 

 higher profile job than that I did this year for Williams. 

 People like Alex Wurz and Pedra de la Rosa have been test 

 drivers for five-six years before becoming race drivers.

 AIFF to bear expenses of PK treatment

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: The AIFF will bear the expenses incurred in the treatment of P.K. Banerjee. This was announced by Priya Ranjan Das Munshi after he visited the city nursing home where PK has been admitted since Thursday morning. 

The former India captain and coach, who suffered a mild cerebral attack, remained stable. Another CT scan was done Friday and the reports confirmed no deterioration in his condition. 

According to Dr Manoj Shah, who is on the medical panel looking after PK, the 70-year-old was fully conscious. He is feeling slightly drowsy partly because of the haemorrhage and partly due to medication, Dr Shah said. 

PK, a columnist for The Telegraph, will be kept in the ICCU for a few more days but wont need any surgery.

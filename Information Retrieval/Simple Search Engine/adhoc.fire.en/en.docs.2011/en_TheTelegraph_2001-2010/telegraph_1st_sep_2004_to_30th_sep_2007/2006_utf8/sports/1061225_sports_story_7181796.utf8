 Need players like Dipendu, says Bhaichung

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Though they ended up being losers, the credits poured in for Churchill Brothers in the Peerless 28th Federation Cup Football Tournament at Salt Lake Stadium here Sunday. 

Conceding that the Goan team, in fact, had given them a tough time, Mohun Bagan coach Robson Mattos said: They really played well, keeping us on toes. But we kept our cool to produce the equaliser in the dying minutes that was important in yielding a favourable result. 

But its a gamethere has to be ups and downs however Im really happy to come out winners eventually, Mattos added. 

Terming it as a team of the future, Churchill coach Karim Bencherifa said: If our players remain together, they are going to be the future of Indian football About the match, he said: Today the winner is Indian football. Im really proud for my team the way they pushed the city giants to the limit was commendable. 

But the day truly belonged to Dipendu Biswas who, coming off the bench, produced two goals one of them being the turning point which extended the game into the extra time and tie-breaker. Had it not for his 85th minute equaliser, the city club would have left with a 1-2 loss. 

Dipendu, however, was honest and took it as one more important win for the team. It really feels good having come back from the bench and played an important role Dipendu, by the way, was substituted for Sushil Singh in the 78th minute. 

Even Bhaichung Bhutia could not stop praising about Dipendu. Its good to see him scoring having come off from the bench We need players like him, said Bhaichung. However he felt that they need to improve on their game in their next match.

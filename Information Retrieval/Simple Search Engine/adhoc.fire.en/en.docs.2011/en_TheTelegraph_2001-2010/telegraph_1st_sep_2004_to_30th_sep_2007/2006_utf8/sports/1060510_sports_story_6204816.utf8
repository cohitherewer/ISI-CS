 Moody upbeat despite De Mel diatribe

 - Aussie more of a strategist than coach, says Lanka chief selector 

 Tom Moody 

London: Sri Lanka coach Tom Moody was in relaxed mood on Tuesday despite coming under fire from newly-appointed chief selector Asantha De Mel just days before the first Test against England, which starts on Thursday. 

Ive lodged nothing, said Moody, denying reports that hed made an official complaint. 

De Mel branded the Australian more of a strategist than a coach and said the former international allrounder had not done enough to help individual players with specific technical problems. 

As far as were concerned, I had a chat with the chief selector this morning and it didnt even come into our conversation, said Moody. 

Back in Sri Lanka, De Mel said that the teams form had slipped since Moody took over last year. 

We were number two in the ICC rankings when John Dyson was the coach and since Moody took over last year we have slipped to number six, he said. 

I think Moody is more of a strategist. Mahela Jayawardene at times has a problem with his foot movement and Moody hasnt been able to correct it. 

Meanwhile, Moody admitted that the controversy was bad for the preparation for a Test match. 

Its not ideal but its certainly something you tend to become a bit immune to, Moody said. There are various challenges that you face and this is just yet another one. But our guys are pretty focused. 

The Australian also said that: You get tested in various ways as a coach and managing these situations is even more important. 

Its just another challenge well have to deal with and we will move on, added Moody. 

 He also confirmed that Muttiah Muralidharan has returned after attending his aunts funeral in Sri Lanka and was gearing well for the three-match Test series. Muralis back, its his first Test at Lords, hes looking forward to it and getting out there. 

We just want to make sure we get the right balance. It is a toss up whether we go in with seven batsmen or six batsmen. Obviously, its no secret well probably play only one spinner (Muralidharan) at this time of year.

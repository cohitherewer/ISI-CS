Lahore: Pakistan spurred on by a half-century from Imran Farhat beat the West Indies by seven wickets in the third one-day International to take an unbeatable 2-0 lead in the five-match series on Sunday. 

Chasing a revised target of 191 in 35 overs under the Duckworth Lewis scoring method after a malfunction in the floodlights caused 60 minutes loss of play, Pakistan reached 192 for three in 33.4 overs. 

Mohammed Yousuf was unbeaten on 28 and Shoaib Malik 21. 

West Indies closed their innings on 207 for seven in 46.3 overs. 

The umpires initially halted play due to murky conditions and then declared the innings closed when the floodlights could not be switched on. 

The West Indian innings revolved around a maiden half-century from 21-year-old Lendl Simmons playing his second match after pacer Rana Naved took three for 37 including the key wicket of Brian Lara who was trapped leg before for a first ball duck. 

Farhat (58) and Mohammad Hafeez (31) gave Pakistan a streaky start by putting on 64 runs before the first wicket fell in the 13th over. 

Hafeez played some powerful shots in his 43-ball innings including a huge six over deep mid-wicket off Chris Gayle who eventually had him caught on the boundary by Jerome Taylor. 

The left-hander Farhat was also supported by wicketkeeper Kamran Akmal who came in and struck 23 from 20 balls with four boundaries before he was caught behind off Gayle by Denesh Ramdin. 

Corey Collymore, who beat the bat several times, had Farhat caught in the deep after he had also swiped Marlon Samuels for a big six with the total on 148. 

The tourists did not help their cause by conceding 31 extras including 17 wides. 

Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq retired hurt in the 14th over, when he hurt his index finger trying to stop a full-blooded shot from Samuels. 

Simmons batted patiently for his runs, reaching his 50 from 96 balls with five boundaries until he was bowled by Naved off the penultimate ball before the suspension. Naved also dismissed Gayle, who made a hard-hitting 41 from 37 balls with seven fours and a six. 

Simmons struck seven fours in his 130-ball knock as the tourists again missed experienced batsman, Shivnarine Chanderpaul, who is struggling with a left knee problem. 

Meanwhile, the chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Dr Nasim Ashraf ordered an inquiry into the power failure. A PCB spokesman said Dr Ashraf would head the inquiry panel to find out who was responsible for the fault that stopped the match for over an hour.

 Jeev Milkha moves to 141

New Delhi: Jeev Milkha Singhs recent good form has propelled him five places up to 141st this week on the world golf charts. 

The Chandigarh golfer, who finished tied eighth in Omazaeki in Japan, has managed five top-10 finishes in his last six starts and the latest result was his sixth top-10 placing in as many appearances on the Japan Tour. 

Jyoti Randhawa, who finished tied 22nd with compatriot Shiv Kapur at the Deutsche Bank Players Championship in Germany, saw his ranking go up four places to 160th. 

Kapur too enjoyed an upward movement in his position, climbing nine places to be 175th. 

But it was a downslide for Arjun Atwal, who faded away after a splendid first round at the US Bank Championship in Milwaukee, as he slid again, from 183rd to 194th, in the world rankings.

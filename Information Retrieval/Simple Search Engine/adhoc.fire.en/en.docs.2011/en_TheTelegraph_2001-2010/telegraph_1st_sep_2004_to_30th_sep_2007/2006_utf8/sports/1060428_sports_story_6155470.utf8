Cape Town: New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming hit a century to prevent South Africa from taking full advantage of asking the tourists to bat on the first day of the second Test at Newlands on Thursday. 

New Zealand were 265 for six at the close, with Fleming on 114 not out. It was his first century in 12 Tests against South Africa, and the ninth of a 101-Test career. 

Fleming and Nathan Astle (50) shared a fourth wicket stand of 102, but the days honours were shared, with South African fast bowler Makhaya Ntini taking three for 65 to keep the home side in contention. 

South African captain Graeme Smiths decision to send New Zealand on a pitch which held no terrors for the batsmen was surprising. 

After the start was delayed by 30 minutes by morning dew, South Africa were unable to make an early breakthrough, with Michael Papps and Peter Fulton putting on 50 for the first wicket. But three wickets fell for 32 runs to give the home side the edge before Fleming and Astle came together. 

Fleming notched his century off 190 balls with 14 fours. When bad light ended play after 78 overs, he had faced 202 deliveries and added another two boundaries.

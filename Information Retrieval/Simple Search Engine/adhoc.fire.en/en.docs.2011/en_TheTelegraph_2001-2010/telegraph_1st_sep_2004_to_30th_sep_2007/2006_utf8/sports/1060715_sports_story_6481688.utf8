 WTAs on-court coaching

 Miami: Tennis coaches will be allowed to talk to players during matches after the Womens Tennis Association (WTA) agreed to an experiment in upcoming tournaments. 

The trial will occur during tournaments in Montreal and New Haven in Connecticut, WTA officials said. 

I think on-court coaching will be really interesting, both for players and fans, former US Open champion Svetlana Kuznetsova said. 

This will add a new story to the match and I think fans will enjoy this new element. 

Players will be able to consult their coaches once per set as well as at the end of sets. If a player takes a medical or bathroom break, only the opposing player may request her coach.

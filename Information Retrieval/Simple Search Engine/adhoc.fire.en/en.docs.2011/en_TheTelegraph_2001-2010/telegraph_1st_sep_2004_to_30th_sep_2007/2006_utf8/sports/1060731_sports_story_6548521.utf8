 Jeev ends tied 8th

Shizuoka: Poor putting at crucial stages cost Jeev Milkha Singh a chance to have a crack at the Omazaeki title on the Japan Tour on Sunday. 

The Chandigarh golfer shot a scintillating six-under 65 in the final round to give himself a chance at the Shizuoka Country Hamaoka course, but two three-putts at the start and finish hurt him as he failed to get into a play-off with three others by two strokes. 

Thus Jeev, lying tied 28th overnight, finished in a tie for eighth place. His 65 was the best round of the day, equalling the one put together by fourth-placed Sushi Ishigaki. 

It was Jeevs sixth top-10 finish in as many appearances in Japan this year and fifth in the last six starts in the Far East and Europe. 

The title went to Toru Taniguchi (68), who won the title after a play-off with Tomohiro Kondo (68) and S.K. Ho (69). All three were tied at 11-under after 72 holes. 

The quartet of Sushi Ishigaki (65), Hiroyuki Fujita (66), Liang Wen Chong (67) and Yoshinobu Tsukada (69) tied for fourth place. 

Jeev was tied with Gregory Meyer (66), Ryoken Kawagishi (69), Taichi Teshima (68) and Thammanoon Srirot (71). 

In between his first and last holes of the day, Jeev found a perfect ally in his putter. He needed just 21 putts, including two birdies from off the green, on the remaining 16 holes. 

Jeev opened with a three-putt bogey but steadied himself with two pars before sinking birdies on fourth, sixth and eighth while missing another on the ninth.

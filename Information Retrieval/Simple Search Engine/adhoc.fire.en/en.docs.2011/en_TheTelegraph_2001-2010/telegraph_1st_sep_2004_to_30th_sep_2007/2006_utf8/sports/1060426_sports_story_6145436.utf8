 Chelsea deal with China

Chelsea have struck an agreement to work with the Asian Football Confederation on their grassroots development programme in China. 

Chief executive Peter Kenyon signed an exclusive deal with AFC president Mohamed bin Hammam that will see the Premiership support the confederations Vision China development project. 

The project, which is due to be expanded from two to 15 cities across China, is part of the Vision Asia plan implemented by Hammam in 2002 and is currently running in seven nations across the confederations 46 member countries. 

This is the first time ever a European club has introduced itself to Asia as a developer of football and to help out Asian football along with our coaches, leagues and referees, Hammam said. 

Im very proud today to have signed with Chelsea a memorandum of understanding and Chelsea is going to support Vision Asia. 

Chelseas involvement has yet to be determined but Kenyon said the clubs were not using the project as a public relations exercise or as a way to unearth talent from the worlds most populous nation. 

We are not in this to identify or get players cheap or to come on tours or do those things. This is a long-term market for us.

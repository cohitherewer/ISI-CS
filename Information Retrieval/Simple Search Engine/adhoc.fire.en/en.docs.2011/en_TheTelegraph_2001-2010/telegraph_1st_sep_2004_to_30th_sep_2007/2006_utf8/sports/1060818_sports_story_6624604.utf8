 ICC warning to South Africa

 Colombo: The International Cricket Council (ICC) on Thursday warned South Africa that they might be penalised if they fail to replay the matches against Sri Lanka, which were cancelled as the African team aborted a tri-series also involving India and returned home, citing security reasons. 

The ICC said the tri-series fell under the Future Tours Programme (FTP) and as per regulations, the matches have to be replayed if called off. 

If they (South Africa and Sri Lanka) dont reach an agreement on the dates, it could go to the ICC Disputes Resolution Committee, where there is a potential of a decision of fines going against South Africa, ICC media manager Brian Murgatroyd said over phone on Thursday. 

Murgatroyd, however, clarified that the ICC would step in only if the two boards fail to arrive at a consensus. 

For now, it is between the CSA and the SLC. It is up to them to arrange for the matches to be replayed. These matches are part of the FTP, he said. 

SLC chief executive Duleep Mendis, who on Wednesday expressed dismay at South Africas decision, reacted angrily to Cricket South Africa (CSA) chief executive Gerald Majolas statement that an e-mailed threat was the clinching factor. 

 Are you going to go by an 

 e-mail which we dont know was sent by whom? Anybody 

 from the South African team could have sent it. You cannot 

 go by an anonymous e-mail, Mendis said. (PTI)

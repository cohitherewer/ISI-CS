 Deepan held

Yerevan (Armenia): Grandmaster Deepan Chakravarthy was held to a draw by local hopeful International Master Levon Babujian in the third round of the World Junior Chess Championship here. 

Woman Grandmaster Dronavalli Harika saved the blushes for the Indian contingent on an otherwise ordinary day with a fine technical victory over Liana Aghabekian of Armenia in the girls championship being organised simultaneously. 

It turned out to be a bad day for overnight joint leader Deep Sengupta, who could not hold on to his own against Grandmaster Daniel Stellwagen of Germany in the open. Another Indian Tania Sachdev who was also jointly leading the girls section fell prey to an optical blunder against American Tatev Abrahamyan. (PTI)

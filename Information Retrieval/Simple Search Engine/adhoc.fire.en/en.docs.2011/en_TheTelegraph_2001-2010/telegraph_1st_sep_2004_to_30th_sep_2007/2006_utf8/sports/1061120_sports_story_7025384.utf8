Siliguri: Sania Mirza and Rushmi Chakravarty beat the Uberoi sisters in the second Videocon Invitation Challenge Tennis Tournament here on Sunday.

The most exhilarating match was the doubles tie, played between Sania-Rushmi and the Uberoi sisters. The full house of 3,500 spectators witnessed a see-saw battle which stretched to three sets.

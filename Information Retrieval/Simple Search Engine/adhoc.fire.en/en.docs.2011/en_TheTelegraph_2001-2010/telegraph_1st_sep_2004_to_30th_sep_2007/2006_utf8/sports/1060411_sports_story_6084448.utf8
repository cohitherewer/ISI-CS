The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Sourav gets invited by Jagdale

 - I cant say whether Im going: Former captain 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Calcutta: Sanjay Jagdale has been a party to Sourav Gangulys exclusion from Team India, but that hasnt stopped him from inviting the former captain for the seventh (and final) ODI versus England, in Indore, on Saturday. 

Besides being Centrals representative on the senior selection committee, Jagdale is secretary of the Madhya Pradesh Cricket Association (MPCA), which will be staging a one-dayer in Indore after five years. 

Weve invited all former captains (including the banned Mohammed Azharuddin) and, obviously, Sourav is one of them? I didnt have his fax number and, so, sent the invitation to the Cricket Association of Bengal, Jagdale told The Telegraph. 

Speaking on Monday afternoon, he added: I havent got a reply as yet, but were looking forward to hosting him? 

The invitation, though, hadnt reached Sourav by the evening. Till Ive got it, I cant say whether Im going or not, he said. 

Wanting to avoid awkward moments made Sourav decline Inderjit Singh Bindras invitation for last months Mohali Test. For much the same reason, he may say no to Jagdale. 

Owing to prior commitments, Sunil Gavaskar and Kapil Dev have already conveyed their regrets. 

Saturdays ODI, by the way, will be the first at the newly-built MPCA Stadium on the Holkars Usharaje Ground. 

Weve finally got our own facility and, hopefully, everything is going to go off without a hitch, Jagdale remarked. 

Indore, incidentally, is Rahul Dravids birthplace and his short break will end there.

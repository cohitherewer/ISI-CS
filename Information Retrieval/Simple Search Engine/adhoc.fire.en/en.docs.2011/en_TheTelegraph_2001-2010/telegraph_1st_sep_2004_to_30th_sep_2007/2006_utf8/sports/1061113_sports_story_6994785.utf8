The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Semis notes helped us

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: North Korea took some vital notes of Japans semi-final win over South Korea, and applied them in the final, which helped them win the title after three decades, according to their coach Jo Tong-sop. 

We saw the shootout between Japan and South Korea. South Korea made too many mistakes in that match. We also observed the Japanese goalkeeper (Akihiro Hayashi) and analysed his strengths and weaknesses. 

When the final went into tie-breaker, I told my boys to keep their precision and shoot wide of him, Jo said after the match. 

According to him, the win means a lot in the games development in the country. Well certainly use it as a platform to bring more glories to our country, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Daniel may call shots 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: It may pay to follow trainer Daniel David in Wednesdays seven-event race card featuring the 2,200m Pearson Surita Memorial Cup.

 In the main event itself, Daniels Star Phoenix enjoys a significant advantage over the Vijay Singh-ward, Regal Romance. The Phoenix seems to have transformed into a good galloper since the four-year-old was blinkered. He won two races subsequently. Ignore his last weeks Derby run. Now that he is back in his Class, the Dont Forget Me-Dramatic Irony son may win in the hands of jockey G.Ross.

 Daniel may also see his Lasting Love winning the other trophy event on the cards ? the Supernova Cup, for three-year-old juveniles. The run benefit of the Rebounding Thrill-Rose Amour daughter may work to her advantage as he takes on debutantes.Read as: Sl. nos, last 4 runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:

Calcutta: The positive approach in the Bengal ranks over the last two days has forced Balwinder Singh Sandhu to admit a change in attitude in the side. Subhamoy Das upset all his plans with a superbly crafted 115 at the Eden on Saturday. 

Captain Deep Dasgupta acknowledged Subhamoys efforts saying, The way he batted helped us build a platform from where we can look ahead. He also praised Manoj Tewaris innings. 

The lingering smile on Subhamoys lips was not to be missed. Its a very important innings for my career? I wanted to bat the whole day, but fell to a bad shot in the end? The shot selection was wrong and hit it straight back to the bowler, he said. 

Rating it as his best, Subhamoy said it would turn out to be memorable only if Bengal make it to the final. 

Id been working hard at nets and on my fitness? I am grateful to my teammates who stood by me during the lean phase. Paras (Mhambrey) guided me a lot? Shashanka Gupta, Pranab Nandy and Sumit Shome were also of great help? I was aware that a cricketer had to go through different phases. I always stayed focused and never lost my confidence during the bad days? Great that Im back among runs, he remarked. 

Deep felt a lot depended on how they bat on the third day. Well be looking to extend the lead and wouldnt want to bat in the fourth innings. It will depend on how we bat tomorrow. It will be crucial from our point of view. 

The course of the match will entirely depend on our performance? Ideally I would like to bat the whole of tomorrow. Only that will make us happy, the captain explained.

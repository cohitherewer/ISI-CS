 In-form Jeev starts today

 - Japan Golf

Shizuoka: Jeev Milkha Singh continues his journey on the Japan Tour as he tees up for the golf tournament, Omazaeki, at the Shizuoka Country Hamaoka course on Thursday. 

The 34-year-old Indian, who revels in playing tournaments rather than taking break for training, has been playing on the trot for almost four months. 

Jeev is now highest ranked Indian in the world at 146th, moving ahead of Jyoti Randhawa (164th), Arjun Atwal (183rd) and Shiv Kapur (184th). 

 Starting with his win at the Volvo 

 China Open in April, he has played every week, including 

 the one before the US Open, where he played 36 holes in 

 a single day to qualify for the US Open and has been achieving 

 some terrific results.

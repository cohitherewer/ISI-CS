 Venue announced

Kuala Lumpur: All the matches of the proposed tri-series, involving India, Australia and possibly the West Indies, will be staged at the Kinrara Oval in Puchong, the Malaysian Cricket Association (MCA) has said. 

While confirming the venue, MCA vice-president Mahinda Vallipuram said they were in final round of talks over the co-hosting of the tournament along with Singapore. 

We are in the final rounds of negotiations to co-host the series, which is scheduled to take place in the second or third week of September, he was quoted as saying by a Singapore daily. 

All four matches will be played at the Kinrara Oval in Puchong which is the home of Malaysian cricket, said Mahinda. While the participation of India and Australia is confirmed, there are doubts if the West Indies would be a part of the series, which would serve as a lead-up to Champions Trophy to be hosted by India in October-November. 

The tri-series will see each team play the other twice in the league stage from where the top two will advance to the final. Singapore are expected to host three matches while the remaining four would be played in Kuala Lumpur.

 Surya in joint lead

Hyderabad: Grandmaster Surya Sekhar Ganguly scored an emphatic victory over International Master Enamul Hossain of Bangladesh in the ninth and penultimate round of ONGC Cup International Grandmasters Open Chess tournament here on Saturday. 

The victory helped the national champion join overnight leaders International Master Deepan Chakravarthy and Grandmaster Pavel Kotsur of Kazakhstan in the lead on 7.5 points with just one round remaining in the Rs. 8.25 lakh prize money tournament. 

Even though it was informally announced that Chakravarthy made his second Grandmaster norm just before he took on Kotsur, the organisers were waiting for confirmation from Fide in this regard as there may be a technical hitch. The minor ambiguity is likely to be sorted out by on Sunday. 

The upsets continued in this round as D.P. Singh from Jharkhand who accounted for GM Dibyendu Barua to reach seven points. 

GM Pravin Thipsay, IM S. Arun Prasad, IM S Satyapragya, GM Ziaur Rehman and Abdullah Al Rakib from Bangladesh and GM Alexander Fominyh of Russia are the other players on seven points. 

Surya Sekhar was the star of the day as he outplayed Hossain almost nonchalantly from a theoretical position arising out of a Sicilian Sveshnikov.

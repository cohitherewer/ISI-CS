Madrid: European and Spanish champions Barcelona eased their way to a 3-0 win away at struggling Racing Santander to keep pace with leaders Sevilla in the Primera Liga on Sunday. 

Goals from Samuel Eto, Ludovic Giuly and a Ronaldinho penalty secured the win, their third in three games in the league, to put them level on nine points with Sevilla and Valencia. 

Sevilla are top on goal difference after Brazilian midfielder Renato scored a late winner to give them a 3-2 home win over city rivals Real Betis. 

In the Bernabeu, Jose Antonio Reyes and David Beckham scored to give Real Madrid a 2-0 win over Real Sociedad that put them fourth with seven points. 

After a dull first half, Reyes opened his account for Real with a curling free kick in the 69th minute, and four minutes later the visitors were reduced to 10 men as Mikel Aranburu was sent off. 

Beckham replaced Reyes as a second-half substitute soon after, and ran the length of the pitch to double the scores on a counter-attack in the final minute. 

Elsewhere in Italy, AS Roma and Palermo maintained their winning starts to the Serie A season on Sunday with victories that leave them as joint leaders after two games while AC Milan also kept their 100 per cent record. 

Milan were set on their way to victory at Parma by a superb free kick from Dutchman Clarence Seedorf before a late penalty from Brazilian Kaka secured a 2-0 victory at the Tardini stadium. 

David Di Michele scored both Palermos goals in their 2-1 win away to Lazio to complete a good week for the Sicilian club who won at West Ham United in the UEFA Cup on Thursday. Lazios second straight loss left them on minus 11 points due to the penalty imposed by a sports tribunal which investigated Italys match-fixing scandal. 

Seedorf fired Milan in front in the 24th minute with a beautifully struck free kick from more than 25 metres but Carlo Ancelottis side didnt have things all their own way.

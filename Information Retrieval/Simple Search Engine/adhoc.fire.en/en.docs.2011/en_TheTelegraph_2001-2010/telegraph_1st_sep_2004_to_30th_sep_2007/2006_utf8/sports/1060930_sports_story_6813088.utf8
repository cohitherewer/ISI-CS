 India fall to Germany 

Madrid: Mamta Kharabs sterling performance went in vain as India went down to Germany 2-3 in a Pool A match of the womens hockey World Cup on Friday. 

The Indian eves put up a spirited performance against their higher rated rivals to lead 2-1 on the hour. But the Germans exposed the gaping holes in their defence to drill in two goals in the last 10 minutes. 

With Mamta making early inroads through her swift runs, India took the fancied rivals by surprise. Germany took the early lead with Anke Kuehn scoring in the 21st minute, but India made light of it and kept up their attack. 

It was not long before the equaliser came. Surinder Kaur showed her opportunism by deflecting in a free hit in the 34th minute. 

In the second-half, Mamta helped India take the lead again in the 60th minute. But Germany hit back through Mandy Haase in the 62nd minute. 

Natascha Keller, however, scored the winner for Germany in the 65th minute. 

In other matches, The Netherlands won 1-0 against England and, in Pool B, Spain defeated China by a similar margin. (PTI)

Norton (US): Tiger Woods survived a scare at the 18th hole before snatching a birdie to break clear at the top of the Deutsche Bank Championship first-round leaderboard on Friday with a five-under-par 66. 

Americans Bob May and Joe Ogilvie, Briton Justin Rose and Australians Nathan Green and Aaron Baddeley were tied for second at four-under. 

Another pack was two off the pace, including Jason Gore, Todd Hamilton, Aussie Peter Lonard, J.J. Henry, Nicholas Thompson, Swede Robert Karlsson and Michael Allen. 

Arjun Atwal and Daniel Chopra made miserable starts, carding four-over 75 each to languish in the 114th place. Neither Atwal nor Chopra had any birdies on the opening day. 

Atwal bogeyed the first and 13th and double bogeyed the 16th to fall four-over. Chopra, starting on tenth, bogeyed the tenth, 16th, third and fifth. 

Defending champion Olin Brown fired a two-under 69 and was tied with 10 others. 

In all, 45 players broke par, including Vijai Singh, the 2004 Deutsche Bank champion who was unable to defend his title last year because of injury. He was at 70. 

Woods had reeled backwards in dismay after his second shot at the 543-yard par 5 looked headed for trouble. 

When I saw (the ball) roll backward, I thought it went in the hazard... I didnt think it rolled in the bunker, Woods said after his round. But I had a good lie. 

Woods took advantage of his good fortune and shot for the green, knocking it within a few feet and sinking the birdie putt. 

Woods is bidding for his fifth win in as many starts. Only three players have won five consecutive PGA tournaments Byron Nelson, Ben Hogan and Woods, whose streak spanned 2000 and 2001. 

Woods also has never won here, an event where the proceeds go to the charitable foundation which bears his name. 

This is Woods final tournament before the Ryder Cup, where he will be looking to reverse a string of mediocre performances when the US take on Europe at the K Club in Ireland. Most of his Ryder Cup teammates, including Phil Mickelson and Chris DiMarco, are skipping this weekends tournament. 

There had been a logjam at the top of the leaderboard throughout the day, with as many as seven golfers tied for first at four under par. 

Britains Rose started with a birdie on the 10th hole and was four-under at the turn. He then had two birdies and a double bogey coming home. 

I made the most of the best part of the day, Rose said. This morning there wasnt a lot of wind. 

Baddeley started out strong, making five birdies through the first 10 holes, but stumbled with bogeys on 12 and 15. With the remnants of Hurricane Ernesto, now a tropical depression, bringing heavy rainstorms up the East Coast, several golfers said they were concerned course conditions would deteriorate later in the weekend.

Atlanta: Australian Adam Scott put behind him a frustrating year of several close calls on the PGA Tour with a three-shot victory at the season-ending Tour Championship Sunday. 

The world No. 4, three ahead at the start of the day, survived a nervy finish before completing a four-under-par 66 in the final round at East Lake Golf Club. 

World No. 2 Jim Furyk, the highest-ranked player in the elite 27-man field, secured second place at eight under by shooting a best-of-the-day 65 with fellow-American Joe Durant (67) a further shot back in third. 

Retief Goosen, champion at East Lake two years ago, birdied two of the last four holes for a 67 and fourth spot at six under. 

Although Vijai Singh briefly trimmed Scotts overnight lead to two with a birdie at the par-four first, the Australian tightened his grip on the tournament with an immaculate display over the first 15 holes. The 26-year-old reeled off birdies at the third, seventh, ninth and 10th before picking up his fifth shot in spectacular style, holing out from a greenside bunker at the par-four 13th. 

After pumping his right fist in celebration, Scott parred the next two holes before dropping his only shot of the day at the 16th. 

However, he held his nerve over East Lakes difficult closing stretch to finish on 11-under 269 and secure his long-awaited first PGA Tour title of the year, the eighth by an Australian this season. Scott earned $1.17 million for clinching his fifth PGA Tour title. 

Furyk gained some consolation, however, by winning the prestigious Vardon Trophy for the first time with the lowest adjusted scoring average during the PGA Tour season of 68.86. (REUTERS)

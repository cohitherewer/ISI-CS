 Industrial action threat by WI players

 - Players cant be taken for granted: Ramnarine 

 Basseterre: Members of 

 the West Indies team chosen for the third Test against India, 

 starting at Warner Park on Thursday, have given the West 

 Indies Cricket Board (WICB) until Wednesday to settle matters 

 related to their contracts or face some kind of industrial 

 action. 

Although the players association and the Windies board have settled their long-running dispute over retainer contracts, the players have been playing the current series against Rahul Dravids side without either a retainer or match/tour contract in place. 

We are interested in resolving this matter, but we are not getting any response from the WICB, Dinanath Ramnarine, president of the West Indies Players Association, told a newspaper in Barbados. 

We had asked for a meeting by today, and we have heard nothing. We are hoping to have the matter sorted out by tomorrow. We have had no feedback from the board about having a meeting. 

Ramnarine disclosed that there was great displeasure and unease in the ranks about the contracts not being in place, and he had been pleading with the WICB to sort it out. 

We are not adversarial, he said. At the end of the day, we need the players to be looked after. If the matter was dealt with a long time ago, ahead of the series, nobody would be upset. 

He added: We have been writing and calling day after day. We want to sort out this matter by Wednesday, otherwise we would have to look at our options. 

They cant continue to take the players for granted. We have shown good faith and goodwill, but we cannot continue to do it forever. 

Reports have surfaced that the cash-strapped WICB had earmarked eight players for retainer contracts, but no official word has come from the body, and Ramnarine says the players remain clueless. 

 People have accused us of being militant in 

 the past, but we have written to the WICB many, many times, 

 he said.

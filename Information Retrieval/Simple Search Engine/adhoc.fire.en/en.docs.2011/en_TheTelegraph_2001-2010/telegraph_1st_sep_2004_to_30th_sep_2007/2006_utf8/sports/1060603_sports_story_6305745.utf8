The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Randhawa at tied 28th

 Wales Open

 London: Jyoti Randhawa 

 turned in a comfortable two-under 67 on the par-69 Roman 

 Road Course at the Celtic Manor Wales Open to place himself 

 at tied 28th at the star-studded European Tour event.

 Compatriot Jeev Milkha Singh, 

 continuing a punishing schedule, opened with a one-under 

 68 to be tied 40th after the first round.

 Starting on the first hole, Randhawa 

 had a sedate opening nine with a birdie on the second and 

 a bogey on the eighth to turn in an even par. He then bogeyed 

 the 13th to be one-over, but on the closing stretch, eagled 

 the par-five 16th and added a birdie on the 17th to go two-under.

 Randhawa is currently 58th on 

 the European money list with just under 195,000 euros.

 Jeev started on the 10th and opened 

 with a birdie and added two more on the 16th and 17th to 

 go three-under after eight holes.

 A disappointing bogey on the 18th 

 saw him turn in at two-under. On the second nine, he birdied 

 twice on the fourth and seventh, but had a bad stretch between 

 the second and fifth, where he dropped three shots to end 

 up at one-under 68. 

 Meanwhile, a sensational nine-under 

 60 by Philip Archer brought him close to becoming the first 

 player on the European Tour to shoot an official 59. The 

 Englishmans nine-under round passed up a great chance 

 to create history. He came to the 426 yard 18th needing 

 a birdie to match the feat of Frenchman Adrien Mwrk, who 

 became the first player to shoot a 59 on the challenge tour 

 in last weeks Tikida Hotels Agadir Moroccan Classic.

 Zaheer claims three

London: Indian paceman Zaheer Khan, who was included in Indias 30-strong probables for the Champions Trophy on Wednesday, came back strongly on Day III of the Division II County Championship match against Surrey on Thursday claiming three wickets for 142 runs. 

The Baroda left-armer had found himself at the receiving end returning one for 120 on Wednesday but he put up a decent performance at New Road on Thursday as the visitors amassed 576 in their first innings, a lead of 272 over Worcestershire. 

Zaheer added the wickets of Ian Salisbury and Azhar Mahmood to that of Mark Butcher but it did not stop the Surrey juggernaut. 

The hosts were facing defeat as they collapsed to 149 for nine in their second innings. Only Vikram Solanki put up resistance with a knock of 56. 

Azhar Mahmood was the wrecker-in-chief with figures of four for 53 and was ably assisted by Ian Salisbury (3/26). Anil Kumble and Mohammed Akram shared the other two wickets. Kumble gave away 27 while Akram conceded 42.

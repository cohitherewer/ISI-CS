The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Sreesanth called up as replacement

 - Its disappointing, but thats how it is: Agarkar 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Ajit Agarkar

Chandigarh: Allrounder Ajit Agarkar, 

 who has fractured his left thumb, is out of the Champions 

 Trophy and is also likely to miss the five-match ODI series 

 in South Africa, which begins November 19.

 I got hit trying to stop 

 a drive by (Ramnaresh) Sarwan, off my own bowling, last 

 night... It hurt then, but the x-ray was done this morning... 

 Its disappointing, but thats how it is, 

 Agarkar told The Telegraph on reaching 

 the Mountview Hotel, Friday evening. 

Hes out for at least three-four weeks and the Indians have moved the tournaments technical committee to clear Sreesanth as a replacement. Thats a formality, but as a protocol is followed, there, wont be any official word till after 10.00 am on the day after Saturday. 

Its to be seen whether Sreesanth (who is expected by Saturday afternoon) makes the XI, but hes definitely going to be careful about what and where he eats. Back in March, he missed the Test against England after a meal at a popular food chain. 

The Indians, who lost to holders West Indies in Motera Thursday, must beat world champions Australia if theyre to make the semi-finals. The match comes off Sunday in neighbouring Mohali. 

The pressure is immense, but both captain Rahul Dravid and coach Greg Chappell looked relaxed as they made their way past the security cordon and headed for their rooms in the hotels new wing. As theres no regular flight between Ahmedabad and Chandigarh, the Indians came on a chartered service. 

Munaf Patel, who bruised his right wrist (again, versus the West Indies), is fit. 

Meanwhile, physical trainer Greg King, who has become a dengue-victim, left for Bangalore instead of travelling here. He will be hospitalised there and treated by a specialist attached to the National Cricket Academy and the Karnataka State Cricket Association. 

 Should India beat Australia, the Board may get somebody 

 to stand-in for King, who has been doing the job since the 

 start of the 2003-04 season. 

 Footnote: Owing 

 to limited rooms at the Taj, the Dravids had to be accommodated 

 at Mountview, which used to host international teams till 

 the Taj came up last year. The Australians, though, are 

 there.

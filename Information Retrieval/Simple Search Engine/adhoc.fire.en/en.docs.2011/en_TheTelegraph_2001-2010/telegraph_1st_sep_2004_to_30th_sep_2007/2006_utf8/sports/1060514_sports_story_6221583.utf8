The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Important to stay in the present: Dravid 

 - Weve done well to not focus on the results alone: Team India captain 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Rahul Dravid 

 Kingston: Taking off from Mumbai and touching 

 down here (early Saturday, back in India) took exactly 24 

 hours. It was a demanding journey, but Team India captain 

 Rahul Dravid showed no signs of wear-and-tear, despite having 

 shared infant son Samits duties with wife Vijeta. 

 Its part of the game... We have some days 

 to recover before the tour-opener (a limited overs match 

 on Tuesday)... So, weve got time, he told the 

 half-a-dozen Indian journalists, who flew with the team, 

 on arrival in picturesque Kingston. 

This, of course, is Dravids first trip to the West Indies as captain. Its nice to be back... I was here as a youngster (in 1997) and returned as a more established player five years later... I look forward to enjoying the tour and, hopefully, the results will be better. 

While India did win the one-dayers in 2002, under Sourav Ganguly, the last Test series success was way back in 1971 when Ajit Wadekar was at the helm. 

Aware that the hype is on the World Cup, to be hosted by the West Indies in ten months, Dravid said: Its important to stay in the present and not look too far ahead... Processes are in place and weve done well to not focus on the results alone. 

He added: The youngsters are excited and they should enjoy the atmosphere... Theres a great buzz in these parts and theres so much history and tradition. 

Incidentally, vice-captain Virender Sehwag, Harbhajan Singh, Ajit Agarkar, Mohammed Kaif and Yuvraj Singh are the only ones besides Dravid to have toured the West Indies before. However, its a hattrick for the captain alone. 

Asked whether it was easier playing (and captaining) away from home, Dravid replied: The challenges are different... Personally, Ive always enjoyed playing away... Its nice to just stay in a team cocoon... Be in a team environment... It helps being insulated... 

The Indians were received, among others, by former West Indies wicketkeeper, selection committee chairman and manager Jackie Hendricks. Also a one-time Match Referee, Hendricks is president of the Jamaica Cricket Association. 

 Meanwhile, Saturday was a day 

 off bat and ball for Team India. The boys need to 

 recover and, so, only a pool session, yoga and a bit of 

 running got scheduled, manager Ranjib Biswal informed 

 The Telegraph. 

 The managership is a first for this senior national 

 selector and former MP.

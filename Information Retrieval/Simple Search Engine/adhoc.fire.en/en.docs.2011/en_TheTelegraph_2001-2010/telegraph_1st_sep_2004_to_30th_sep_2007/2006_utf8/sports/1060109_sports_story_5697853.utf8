The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 1st match helped me: Ljubicic 

 - He served unbelievably, says Moya 

OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Carlos Moya in action on Sunday 

Chennai: Not often do you have the singles semi-final and final on the same day of an ATP event. Saturdays unseasonal rain forced it on the Chennai Open organisers, and top seed Ivan Ljubicic suddenly found himself with his work cut out. 

The Croat, of course, had the wherewithal to pass the double-test. Kristof Vliegen stretched him to the hilt, taking him to a tie-break in the decider. Two-time champion Carlos Moyas fight was over after the first set tie-break. So how did he manage two wins in a span of seven hours? 

I went back to the hotel after beating Vliegen, had a light lunch and slept for half hour? in the evening, I felt fully fit physically. The first match helped me to be ready for the final, a beaming Ljubicic said at the post-match conference. 

The tie-breaks bothered him, though he managed to win all three during the week. In the first round (Guillermo Garcia-Lopez), I was set-point down and managed to win. Today (Sunday), I was thinking about that in both semis and final. I was telling myself if I could do it once, I can do it again, explained the 26-year-old who was playing for the first time in Chennai. 

I was planning not to play in the first week but was offered a wild card here three weeks ago? Im glad I took that offer, said the big Croat who had lost the Doha final in the last two years. 

Not ready to put any numbers vis-?-vis his goal for 2006, the world No. 9 said he wanted to enjoy this success and then focus well on the Australian Open. Of course I want win as many titles as possible, said the man who has now won four ATP crowns in 11 finals. 

Moya applauded the man who denied him a third consecutive title here. He served unbelievably, especially in the second set. I had my chances in the first set and it was mentally very tough to lose that tie-break, said the former world No. 1. 

Moya also praised Ljubicic for playing two matches in a day. I thought he would be tired in the final, but I was the one who had no energy after the second set. Its difficult to play a guy like him with such a serve.

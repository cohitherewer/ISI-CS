The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Md. Sp. go down to Shenzen 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The script, at the Salt Lake stadium, was nothing different from that of the previous day. 

If it was local giants East Bengal the other day, on Friday it was the fate of Mohammedan Sporting another home team who was made to bite the dust with the same scoreline (0-1). However, unlike the previous day, when the boisterous crowd kept on jeering East Bengal, there was reprieve for Mohammedan Sporting with a sparse turn-out for the floodlit encounter. 

With the loss to a young Chinese club Shenzen FC in the Group B encounter, Mohammedan Sportings chances of staying alive in the 112th IFA Shield, now depends on the Shenzen-Mohun Bagan result. Mohammedan Sporting and Mohun Bagan played out a goalless draw in the opener. 

Having played a drab first-half, where the city outfit missed a few chances, the black-and-white brigade got a rude awakening after the lemon break when Ma Xiao Lei did not falter to convert a Wu Lei header in the 63rd minute. 

Following his score, the 19-year-old did a Sourav Ganguly, removing his jersey and flinging it in the air.

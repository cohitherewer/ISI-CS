 Sharapova gets even with Hingis

Dubai: Russias Svetlana Kuznetsova beat Amelie Mauresmo 7-6, 6-4 in the quarter finals of the Dubai Open on Friday, robbing the Frenchwoman the chance to take the world No. 1 ranking this week. 

The defeat ended a run of 16 successive victories that earned Mauresmo three titles this year, including the Australian Open. 

In the other quarter finals, third seed Maria Sharapova gained revenge for her recent defeat by Martina Hingis in Tokyo, beating the Swiss 6-3, 6-4, while Justine Henin-Hardenne defeated Francesca Schiavone of Italy 6-4, 7-6. 

American Lindsay Davenport came from a set down to beat unseeded Russian Maria Kirilenko 4-6, 6-2, 6-3. 

Kuznetsova plays Henin-Hardenne in one semi-final while Sharapova will meet Davenport in the other. 

The quality of the clash between Sharapova and Hingis fluctuated, with a series of skilful rallies contrasting with a bunch of careless errors.

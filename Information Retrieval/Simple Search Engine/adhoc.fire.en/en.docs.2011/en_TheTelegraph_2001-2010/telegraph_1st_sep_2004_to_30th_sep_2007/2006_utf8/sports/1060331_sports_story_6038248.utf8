 Calcutta: The Indian team 

 is high on confidence on the eve of its departure for the 

 Queen Sirikit Cup golf championship in Adelaide from April 

 5-7.

 We finished ninth last year 

 in Bangkok, this time I am hopeful of an improved show, 

 said Vandana Agarwal, one of the team members, at a press 

 conference on Thursday afternoon at the RCGC.

 India No. 1 Irina Brar and Jamshedpur 

 girl Shraddhanjali Singh are the other playing members, 

 while Anu Bindra ? chairperson of the Indian Golf Union 

 Ladies Section ? is the non-playing captain.

 Vandanas optimism stems 

 from her belief that the Indians have got a strong team.

 We usually have one weak 

 link in the team? this time, Irina is in fine form, I have 

 put in a lot of hard work and Shraddhanjali is also hitting 

 the ball long. We hope to do much better, said the 

 experienced Vandana, who has featured in several Sirikit 

 Cup campaigns.

 For Shraddhanjali, this will be 

 her maiden India exposure.

 I came through trials and 

 am feeling good with my form? hope I can continue that way 

 in Australia, said the 19-year-old.

 The annual ladies amateur 

 invitational meet for Asia-Pacific countries will feature 

 14 nations. The aggregate of six rounds, made up of the 

 two best rounds of each day, will decide the champions.

 The Indian team, being supported 

 by ECCO India, Wills Lifestyle and Maxfli, leaves India 

 on Friday night and will get two days of practice at the 

 Adelaide Royal Golf Club before the competition gets underway.

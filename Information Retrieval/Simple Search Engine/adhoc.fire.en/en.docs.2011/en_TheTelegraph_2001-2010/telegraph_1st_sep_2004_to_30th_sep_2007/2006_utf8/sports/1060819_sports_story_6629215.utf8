 SA players body defends decision 

 - TRI-SERIES PULLOUT

Durban: The South African Cricketers Association (SACA) has defended the squads withdrawal from a tour of Sri Lanka due to security concerns. 

South Africa pulled out of a triangular tournament after a car bomb blast killed seven . 

The decision, taken after an independent security consultant said the risk to the team was at an unacceptable level, has been criticised in the Sri Lankan media and by senior cricket officials. 

What critics of our players fail to understand is that the decision to withdraw from the tour wasnt a decision of the players, SACA chief executive Tony Irish said in a media release. 

It was a decision made by Cricket South Africa (CSA). It was also made properly after consideration of the security reports and in consultation with SACA, which represents the players. The whole team supported the decision. 

Irish rubbished reports that the South African players had been divided over the issue. Ive heard and read statements suggesting that our players are chicken, that there was a split between players and that Mark Boucher and senior players somehow orchestrated the withdrawal. 

This is nonsense. CSA had a duty to the country to do what it did given the information at hand, he said. 

The SACA also said the South African embassy in Khartoum had received a letter on August 14 warning the team of dire consequences if it did not pull out. (Reuters)

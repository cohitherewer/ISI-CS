 Dhorasoo turns back on France

Paris: Paris St Germain midfielder Vikash Dhorasoo said on Tuesday he no longer wanted to play for France. Dhorasoo, 32, earned the last of his 18 caps as a late second-half substitute in the 1-1 draw against South Korea during the World Cup finals in Germany. 

If you ask me if Im still interested to play for France Ill answer you that Im not, Dhorasso said in a French daily. Im not interested in playing for Les Bleus anymore. Its over. Thats it. 

Dhorasoo, who made his international debut in March 1999, became a regular first choice under coach Raymond Domenech but was overlooked at the World Cup finals.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 I am closer to the end, says Zidane

 Zidane aims for last hurrah in Germany 

Paris: France captain Zinedine Zidane has confirmed on his internet site that he will end his sparkling career in the next 18 months, but first he wants to win the World Cup. 

Zidane has won all the major honours in world football, including leading his country to World Cup victory on home soil in 1998 by scoring two goals in Frances 3-0 demolition of favourites Brazil. 

Zidane also scored the winning goal for Spanish club Real Madrid in the 2002 Uefa Champions League final, firing in a spectacular volley against Bayer Leverkusen. 

But he told his website on Wednesday that he wants to make the most of what remains of his career and then retire at the top. 

I have another six months or a year, its true, he said. At most, I have another year and a half. I am closer to the end than the beginning. 

I am eager to make the most of my last moments as a footballer and to live these moments to the full. Otherwise, afterwards, I would be left with regrets. 

Last month, Zidane told French television channel Canal+ that he wanted to finish the season and then focus on the World Cup before making any decisions on the next 12 months. 

Now he is keen to make up for Frances World Cup 2002 and Euro 2004 disasters. 

In the 2002 World Cup, France failed to make it out of the group stages when faced with Uruguay, Senegal and Denmark. With Zidane injured for their first two games and only a peripheral figure in their last, France failed to score a single goal and crashed out with two defeats and a draw. 

Two years on and they fell at the first knock-out hurdle when faced with eventual champions Greece. (AFP)

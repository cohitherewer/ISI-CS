 Randhawa finishes tied 13th

Dubai: A miserable day on the greens cost Jyoti Randhawa a place in the top-10, and he had to settle for tied 13th in the star-studded Dubai Desert Classic. Tiger Woods clinched the crown in a play-off with Ernie Els. 

With three birdies and two bogeys, Randhawa carded a one-under 71 that saw him finish at 12-under 276 and in tied 13th place for a good outing in the Middle East. 

Woods turned in even par with one each of birdie and bogey and struggled with the driver. The world No.1 needed birdies on the last two holes to get into the play-off. 

A clutch player that he is, he achieved that and then won the play-off with a par, as Els went into the water and then missed his par putt. 

Woods has now won on both his starts in 2006. 

Meanwhile, in Scottsdale, Daniel Chopra, who got the birdies alright, bogeyed often to bring in only a modest card of one-under 70 to be placed at tied 34th after three rounds in the FBR Open at the TPC of Scottsdale.

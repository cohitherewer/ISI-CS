The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Air India write to AIFF again 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 NFL REPLAY vs FRANSA PAX

 New Delhi: Air India have 

 shot off yet another letter to the All India Football Federation 

 (AIFF) on Monday, requesting them to reply to their earlier 

 letter in which the Mumbai team had questioned the logic 

 behind awarding a replay of the Fransa Pax-Air India match 

 in the National Football League (NFL). They have also mentioned 

 that they would be unable to field a side as most of their 

 players are on leave and would not return before Sunday.

 We have informed the AIFF 

 that it would not be possible for us to play on Thursday 

 against Fransa at Goa as most of our players are on leave 

 and will return only on Sunday. Earlier, we were given an 

 impression that the NFL would only resume on March 10. How 

 can they tell us now to play on Thursday? Air India 

 coach Bimal Ghosh told The Telegraph from Mumbai.

 However, the AIFF general secretary, 

 Alberto Colaco said in the capital on Monday that the match 

 would be held as per schedule on Thursday.

 Air India has conveyed to 

 the AIFF that they have granted leave to their players and 

 they would face problems in re-assembling them for the match. 

 They have asked us to reconsider the schedule.

 We have asked them to give 

 their stand in writing, and any further decision would be 

 taken after we receive their letter, Colaco said.

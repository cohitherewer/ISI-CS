The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Proud Native may strike 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Trainer Daniel Davids Proud Native would be one to beat in the 1,400m Schwarzenegger Cup, the main event in Wednesdays race card. 

 The Flitch-Issabelle son was made to play a pace-makers role in the premium events during the winter. Back in the open Class and against a moderate opposition, the four-year-old may win in the hands of jockey Imran Chisty.

 Chisty is also expected to drive home the advantage on the lowly placed Lasting Love in the Moon Fairy Handicap over 1,200m. In the winter, the Rebounding Thrill-Rose Amour filly had handed a three-length beating to Flemenco Star who had a smashing victory last week.Read as: Sl. nos, last 4 runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:

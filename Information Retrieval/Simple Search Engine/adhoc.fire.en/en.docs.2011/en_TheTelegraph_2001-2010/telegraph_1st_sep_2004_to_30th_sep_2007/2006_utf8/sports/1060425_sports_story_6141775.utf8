 Afridi may lose A status: PCB

Islamabad: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) will try to persuade allrounder Shahid Afridi to change his decision to withdraw from Tests in view of the 2007 World Cup, failing which it will review his status in a fresh central contract in July. 

We think he has taken an emotional decision. And we are going to speak to him about it and ask him to change his decision, PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan said. 

But if he wants to skip Test matches then weve to see what sort of contract he should be given, Shaharyar said. 

The 26-year-old is currently in the category A of the central contract. 

Currently all the players to whom weve given contracts are available for Test and one-day Internationals (ODI). Though Afridi is not an automatic choice for Tests, his availability is important to us, Shaharyar said. 

The PCB chairman said he felt Afridi had taken the decision to play only ODIs under pressure after failing in a couple of matches. 

But the strange thing is that since making his announcement he has been under more pressure because everyone is saying he should also be available for Test matches. 

 Shaharyar said he would soon sit down with Afridi and sort things out before the England tour, after also speaking to captain Inzamam-ul Haq and the coach Bob Woolmer. 

He is a very good player and we want him for both forms of the game. We cant have players picking and choosing when and what they want to play, he added.

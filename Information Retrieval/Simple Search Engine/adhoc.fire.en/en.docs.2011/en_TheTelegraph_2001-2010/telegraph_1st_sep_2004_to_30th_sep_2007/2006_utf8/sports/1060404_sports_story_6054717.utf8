The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 One of my best hundreds: Yuvraj

 - Sehwag is an outstanding talent... well give him as many chances as we can, says Chappell 

OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Irfan Pathan in action on Monday 

 Margao: Yuvraj Singh doesnt rate his 103 on Monday as the best of his seven centuries. I would rate this as one of my best, he said after the match. 

It wasnt that I was batting badly in this series... Just getting the starts but failing to build on them. There was a bit of pressure today as someone needed to take a go at their bowling at that stage. I concentrated on playing my natural game and that did the trick, he explained. 

Rahul Dravid wasnt surprised by Yuvrajs explosive knock. This is nothing new. Yuvraj has been playing well in the recent past and has won matches for us almost single-handedly. Today was no different. 

Coach Greg Chappell, too, was effusive in praise. He has always been a free flowing batsman and a great striker of the ball. It was an outstanding innings. Weve got a good blend at the top of the order. Theres Rahul, then Sehwag... Players who can turn things around. 

He also defended both Mohammed Kaif and Virender Sehwag despite their recent run of poor scores. Sehwag is an outstanding talent. Well give him as many chances as we can... 

Chappell also ruled out making wholesale changes. you cant keep changing all the time. We are looking at particular types of players, a pool from where we can pick and choose. I think we have got a blend of what we want looking ahead.

 Asked if Suresh Raina had done 

 enough to move up the order, Chappell said: Well 

 have to see if its in his best interests. Weve 

 eased him into the team, put him in some pressure situations, 

 and hes done well... Maybe hes ready for few 

 more challenges. 

The coach was pleased with Romesh Powars performance. Im very happy with what he has done. He got some wickets in Faridabad. He is intelligent and clever and gelling nicely with the side. 

 Despite the 3-0 lead, Chappell 

 felt there remain areas that needs improvement. We 

 would want everyone to achieve success in every match. But 

 that is always not possible. As long as the guys are sharing 

 the work around its good for the team. Thats 

 what exactly happened today. 

 He warned, though, that there 

 was no room for complacency. Youre as good as 

 your next performance. 

Meanwhile, Dilip Sardesai, who made it to the ground despite poor health, was feted by the Goa cricket Association with a cheque of Rs 5 lakh. its good to be recognised after 33 years. Better late than never, a visibly moved Sardesai said. 

The former India star felt it was time the team management dropped Kaif and tried out someone else. Consistency is the most important factor in cricket. 

Sardesai, though, was for retaining Sehwag, but trying him down the order.

 Korea out to prove 2002 wasnt a fluke

 - Advocaat faces daunting task of living up to Hiddink 

 Midfielder Park Ji-sung is South Koreas marquee player Seoul: South Korea is on a mission to prove their surprising run at the last World Cup wasnt a fluke. 

The Koreans hadnt won a single match in five World Cup appearances before 2002. But that year, when they co-hosted the tournament with Japan, they went all the way to semi-finals, beating powerhouses Portugal, Italy and Spain on the way. 

It was the first time an Asian squad made it so far since North Koreas astounding run to the quarter finals in England in 1966. 

South Koreas performance made coach Guus Hiddink into a national legend. Now, another Dutchman, Dick Advocaat, faces the daunting task of meeting the high expectations of the countrys Red Devils fans. It wont be easy. 

Advocaat took over the team last September after the disappointing results of Humberto Coelho of Portugal and Jo Bonfrere of The Netherlands. 

Acknowledging the teams poor showing before 2002, Advocaat said in early April that his players were nonetheless showing confidence in their warm-ups ahead of the World Cup. I am sure that we are a very, very difficult team to beat, and I think the opponents know that as well, Advocaat said. 

The South Korean squad, ranked 30th by Fifa, will face France, Switzerland and Togo in group G in Germany. 

Still, the team has players with more experience in international play after their 2002 success attracted attention of international clubs. South Koreans have played in the English, German and Turkish leagues, among others. 

There are many players in the national team who play overseas, especially in Europe. Also many players had played in the World Cup 2002, which gave them the experience of winning games, said Kang Sin-Woo, a top official at the Korea Football Association. 

The experience of victory against the European teams will help the national team overcome the heavy burden of away matches, Kang added. 

The teams marquee player is midfielder Park Ji-sung, who plays for Manchester United, where he became the first South Korean to play in the English Premier League. 

Park uses both legs and moves endlessly across the field with great physical stamina. For man united, he has scored one goal and set up six others to help the team to a second-place finish in the premier league. 

If Park Ji-sung is just a fast player, it would be good to position him at the wing. But since Park has other multiple abilities, it is better to position him at the centre attacking middle to perform the same role as Zidane did for the France national team in 1998 when they won the World Cup, Kang said. 

Another threat will come from Lee Young-pyo, a defender who can also function as a left and right midfielder. He also plays in the premier league, for Tottenham. 

The team will suffer from the loss of Lee Dong-kook, the centre forward who wont be on the field due to a knee injury. 

But his replacement, Park Chu-Young, is considered one of the countrys finest young prospects, now playing for FC Seoul where he won the top rookie award in 2005 from the Korea Football League.

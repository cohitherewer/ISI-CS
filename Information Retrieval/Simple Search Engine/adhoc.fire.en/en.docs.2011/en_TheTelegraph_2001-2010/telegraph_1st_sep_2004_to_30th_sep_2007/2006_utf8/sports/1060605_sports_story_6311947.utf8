 Defoe to fly in as Rooney standby

Manchester: Sven-Goran Eriksson says standby striker Jermain Defoe will fly out with England to Germany on Monday despite his firm belief that injured Wayne Rooney will play at the World Cup. 

Defoe was preferred to Andy Johnson for a place on the plane as Eriksson keeps his options open before Rooney returns to Manchester for a scan on his broken foot on Wednesday. 

Defoe goes with us to Germany because we have to be insured about Wayne Rooney, Eriksson said. 

However, the Swede is defiantly optimistic that Rooney can recover in time from a double fracture suffered against Chelsea on April 29 to play some part in the finals. 

Under Fifa rules, Eriksson has until 24 hours before their opening Group B game against Paraguay to replace Rooney in his squad, should the 20-year-old be ruled out of the finals. (Reuters)

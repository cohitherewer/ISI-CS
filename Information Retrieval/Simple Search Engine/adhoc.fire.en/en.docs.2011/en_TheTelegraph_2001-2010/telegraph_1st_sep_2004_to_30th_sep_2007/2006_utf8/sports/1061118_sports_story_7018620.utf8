 Sehwag virtually out of 1st ODI 

 - Dravids 79 not enough as India lose tour-opener by 37 runs 

 Virender Sehwag 

Johannesburg: Opener Virender Sehwag has been virtually ruled out of the opening ODI against South Africa here on Sunday, compounding Indias problems ahead of the five-match series. 

Sehwag suffered a gash in the right ring finger before the start of a warm-up game in Benoni on Thursday and it was revealed that the dressing on his wound would come off only on Sunday morning, barely hours before the day-night encounter. 

The Delhi batsman needed four stitches to close the gaping wound and did not play the warm-up match against South Africa A which the visitors lost by 37 runs. 

India were chasing 256 for victory but slid to 218 all out, captain Rahul Dravid top-scoring with 79. 

Although the team management said the injury was not serious, the fact that the stitches would come off only on Sunday makes it rather unlikely for him to take the field in the first game. 

While the teams media manager Rajan Nair did not give a clear indication on Sehwags availability, coach Greg Chappells statement gives the impression that the dashing opener may not be in the scheme of things for the first match. 

His (Sehwags) injury is not serious as such but the stitches would come off only on Sunday morning and we hope the problem doesnt extend beyond the first game, Chappell said after the warm-up game in Benoni. 

The injury happened when Sehwag went for a high catch during practice before the start of the warm-up match. 

India are already without the services of Yuvraj Singh, a key member in the one-day squad, after he suffered a knee ligament injury on the eve of the Champions Trophy match against Australia in Mohali late last month. 

In case Sehwag does not play the match, the team management may have to choose between opener Wasim Jaffer, who seems to be a likely choice to partner Sachin Tendulkar, and wicketkeeper-batsman Dinesh Karthik. Captain Rahul Dravid, who has opened in one dayers in the recent past, could also be an option. 

Chappell, meanwhile, has fully recovered from food poisoning which forced him to skip the teams first practice session. (PTI)

 Lanka face double trouble 

 - Nel ruled out of tri-series 

 Murali 

Melbourne: An out-of-form Sri Lanka will be jumping from the frying pan into fire when they take on world champions Australia in the opening match of the limited-overs tri-series on Friday. 

Sri Lanka, with just two wins from their last 11 one-day matches, have slumped from second in the world rankings to sixth and will face a home side buoyed by their recent 2-1 series success in New Zealand. 

But they are also likely to face a challenging time from the home crowd. 

Off-spinner Muttiah Muralidharan refused to play in a two-Test tour of Australia in 2004 after being outraged by constant no-ball taunts from the home supporters. 

Australian Prime Minister John Howard, a devout cricket fan, publicly labelled Muralidharan a chucker. 

Muralidharan was first called for throwing by Australian umpire Darrell Hair in Melbourne during the 1995-96 Test series and has had to contend with the issue since then. 

But Sri Lankan captain Maravan Atapattu said Muralidharan had put the incidents behind him, motivated in part by Australias generous response to the tsunami in his country. 

Muralidharan is currently ranked the worlds number one bowler with 584 Test and 395 one-day wickets. 

Sri Lankan coach Tom Moody said Muralidharans action had been subjected to rigorous testing and had been cleared and it was time to move on. 

Its (taunts) not ideal and its a shame that it happens, particularly since hes gone through every test and scrutiny a player could possibly go through, Moody said. 

We just need to enjoy the special talent hes got and let the game progress. 

South Africa will make up the third nation in the series but they too face problems. Off-spinner Johan Botha, who was flown to Australia to cover for the injured Makhaya Ntini in the third Test against Australia, has been reported for a suspect bowling action. 

Andre Nel, however, will miss the series after breaking a bone in his foot.

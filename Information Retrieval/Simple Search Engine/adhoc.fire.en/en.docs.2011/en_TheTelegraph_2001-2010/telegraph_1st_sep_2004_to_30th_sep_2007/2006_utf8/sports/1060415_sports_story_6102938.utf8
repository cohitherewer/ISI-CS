 Quick-takes

 Lee Dong-gook out of World Cup

 Seoul: South Koreas 

 Lee Dong-gook will miss the World Cup after being told he 

 needs surgery to repair torn knee ligaments, his K-League 

 club said on Friday. The Pohang Steelers strikers 

 worst fears were confirmed by a specialist in Frankfurt 

 on Thursday, where he was informed he had no option but 

 to undergo surgery on his right knee.

 The ligaments have snapped 

 so surgery was the only choice, said Pohang media 

 officer Shin Joo-hyun. We expect that Lee will take 

 four to six months to recover.

 He wont be able to 

 play any part at the World Cup. Lee initially decided 

 against surgery after suffering the injury in a K-League 

 game on April 5, favouring a course of strengthening rehabilitation.

 Kalou wins court battle

 Amsterdam: Ivory Coast-born 

 Salomon Kalou, denied the chance to represent The Netherlands 

 at the World Cup, has won a court battle to have a spoof 

 advert showing him playing for Germany withdrawn. In a TV 

 spot for Dutch insurer Achmea, made without the permission 

 of the Feyenoord winger, Kalou is announced as part of a 

 German team facing the Dutch in a World Cup final. A look-alike 

 of German goalkeeper Oliver Kahn then thanks The Netherlands 

 immigration minister Rita Verdonk for failing to fast-track 

 Kalous Dutch citizenship application.

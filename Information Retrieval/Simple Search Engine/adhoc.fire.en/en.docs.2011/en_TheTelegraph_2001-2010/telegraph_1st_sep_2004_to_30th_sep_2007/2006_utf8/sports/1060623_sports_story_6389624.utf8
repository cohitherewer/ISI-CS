 Windies off to a sound start 

Basseterre: West Indies were 69 for no loss after 22 overs on the opening day of the third Test against India. Chris Gayle was batting on 46 while Daren Ganga was on 18. 

The start at Warner Park was delayed by two-and-a-half hours due to wet outfield caused by overnight rains. 

Brian Lara won the toss and elected to bat. 

India made two changes in the line-up with Harbhajan Singh and Sreesanth coming in place of VRV Singh and Irfan Pathan. The Indians again decided to go into the match with four bowlers. 

West Indies made one change from the team in the second Test with Marlon Samuels replacing Ian Bradshaw. 

Umpire Rudi Koertzen of South Africa said there was concern about a particular area in the outfield which prevented the start on schedule. The problem is in the fine leg area where there is standing water. We have only one sopper here so its takes time to dry, Koertzen said. 

The series is level at 0-0 after the draws at Antigua and St Lucia.

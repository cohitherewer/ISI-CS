 Ponting does a Bradman!

 Ashes Series 

 Ponting presented luxury watch to each teammate on winning the Ashes 

Melbourne: Australian cricket captain Ricky Ponting has emulated Sir Donald Bradmans generosity of more than a half-century ago, giving each of his teammates a limited-edition luxury watch to celebrate Australias Ashes win over England. 

After the famous invincibles tour of England in 1948, Bradman gave each of his teammates a pair of gold cufflinks. 

Its a great opportunity to say thanks to the guys personally for what theyve done over the last four or five weeks, and also something they can wear around and play in if they want to, Ponting said of the watches which will be handed out by Christmas. 

Its really capturing the moment of what weve done over the last few weeks. Theres no doubt this has been a special moment for me, as it is for the rest of the players. 

The gesture is courtesy of one of Pontings personal sponsors. He said he knew about Bradmans 1948 gesture when he decided to hand out the watches. (AP)

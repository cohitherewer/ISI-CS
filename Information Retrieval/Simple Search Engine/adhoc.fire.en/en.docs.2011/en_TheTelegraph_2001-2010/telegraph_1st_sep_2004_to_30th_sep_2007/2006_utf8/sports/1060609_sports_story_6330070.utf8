The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Only a major upset can deny Brazil

 - Argentines may revive memories of the one and only Maradona

 On Target

 Shyam Thapa

This has become a clich? ? something like a much-rubbed Aladdins lamp, but which also gives you the pleasure of seeing your wish fulfilled. Hordes of experts have been saying this over the past few months. So who am I to swim against the stream? Its Brazil who start as the red-hot favourites in the World Cup. 

Ive always had a sense of bonding with the South American giants. I came to know about how football could be so beautiful through Peles Dream Team in the 1970 Mexico World Cup. Seven years later, the legend came calling to Calcutta and yours truly had a chance to play against him. 

 But my bias towards the Ronaldinhos and Ronaldos is not just emotion-driven. Tell me, which team can match Brazil with such a constellation of stars? The likes of Argentina and Italy or England can hope for a breakthrough only when the Brazilians self-destruct. 

The presence of Cafu (AC Milan) and Roberto Carlos (Real Madrid), along with Cicinho (Real Madrid) and Lucio (Bayern Munich) in the backline means defensive organisation has also an attacking flair. Then Ze Roberto (Bayern Munich), Gilberto Silva (Arsenal), Kaka (AC Milan) form a midfield which can be a threat to any team. 

The frontline is undoubtedly the most deadly and dazzling. The quartet of Ronaldinho, Ronaldo, Robinho and Adriano is sure to trouble the best of defenders. 

Ever since Ronaldinho scored that stunning goal from a free-kick against England in 2002, the smiling magician has gone from strength to strength. Ronaldo will go into the World Cup as a wounded tiger. Much has been said about his loss of form, but remember, like Cafu and Carlos, this will also be his last World Cup and champions hate to leave on a disappointing note. 

Robinho, I think, will carry forward Ronaldos legacy. Hell be the next Brazilian star. 

Defence remains Brazils Achilles Heel. Both Cafu and Carlos are well past 30 and their penchant for attack may lead to the teams downfall. Still, Id say Brazil have to suffer a major upset to return empty-handed from Germany. 

Talking about the other contenders, France, England and Italy can test Brazil. 

Italy have a rich World Cup record and ignoring them totally will be foolish. 

Frances progress will depend on how far Henry can carry the team. They are in a tough group and the inspirational Zidane is not in prime form. 

England can sparkle and as a unit, they look very sound. The news of Rooney being declared fit must have come as a big boost. 

The hosts of any finals always come in for special attention. Germany have this tendency of keeping everyone guessing about their actual potential and before you realise, they are in the semis or even the final. Four years ago, nobody gave them a chance. They battled their way into the championship round almost unnoticed before caving in to Ronaldos brace. 

The situation is different this time. As hosts, the expectations will be huge. Home support can sometimes help, but it generates pressure as well. So Germany cant afford a shaky start, because playing with the crowds patience is risky. 

I cant see Holland anywhere beyond the quarters. Spain host the worlds best league and yet have remained the perennial under-achievers. However, my gut feeling is that Spain will reach the semis this time. 

My dark horse is Argentina. They are a young side and, like Brazil, most of their footballers play in top European clubs. In Sorin, Cambiasso, Riquelme and Crespo, Argentina have the necessary firepower and skill. If they can play as a unit, this Argentine side will revive memories of the one and only Maradona in Germany. 

Of the Asian and African representatives, I dont think any team will win the Cup in the next 10-15 years. They can upset a big team ? like Cameroon beating Argentina in 1990 and Senegal shocking France in 2002 ? but the euphoria begins and ends there. However, Ghana and South Korea have the ability to go beyond the second round. 

I would like to end with a sad reflection. Japan have embarked on a grandeur plan to win the World Cup. Its a 50-year project in which the players ? who will accomplish the dream ? are obviously not even born! The blueprint of the project, though, is ready. 

In the 1970 Asian Games, we beat Japan to win the bronze medal. Look at where Japan are now, while we Indians continue to lag far behind. Why cant we think of such a long-term project? Well, I have no answer to that one.

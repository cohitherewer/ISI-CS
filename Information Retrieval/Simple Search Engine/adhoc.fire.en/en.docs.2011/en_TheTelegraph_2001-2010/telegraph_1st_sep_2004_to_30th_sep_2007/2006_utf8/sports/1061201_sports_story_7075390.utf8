 Sourav coolness personified

 - Fans euphoric at heros return 

INDRANIL MAJUMDAR

Calcutta: Sourav Ganguly had a sheepish smile as he left the Eden on Thursday. A gently wave of the hand followed as the hundreds, who had parked themselves outside, threw traffic out of gear trying to catch a glimpse of their hero. 

Hes back and there was satisfaction that their prayers had been answered. Even an hour after Sourav had driven away, the euphoria continued. 

In the morning, while everyone was holding their breath, Sourav appeared relaxed. This is one moment he had been waiting for during the past nine months, and when it did come, he was unusually cool. Maybe the sense of relief was laced with the realisation that hard days are ahead. 

Having arrived at around ten, he went about his task like in a business-like manner. 

The tension of his followers reached a crescendo by the time the meeting started in New Delhi. 

But even if he was feeling it, he was not willing to reveal it. After an extended session at the nets both with the bat and ball, it was time to have a look at the wicket and discuss strategy with coach Paras Mhambrey. Then it was back to doing some warm-down exercises with the physio. 

News had started to trickle in around noon that he had indeed been picked. Sourav lent an ear to the murmur of the mediamen but was more eager to know if an announcement had been made. 

Once it was official, Sourav pored over a piece of paper to have a look at the 16-member squad. VVS Laxmans promotion was met with an element of surprise. 

The congratulatory messages started pouring in, Jagmohan Dalmiya being among the first to talk to him, courtesy CAB joint secretary Saradindu Pals cell. 

The practice over, it was time for teammates to wish their favourite Dadi before returning to the dressing room. The doors stayed shut for 15 minutes before the media conference. 

He answered with poise declaring at the outset that he would only take questions relating to his selection and nothing else. He spoke softly, not ruffled by any question that seemed out of place. 

Maybe, time has taught him to be patient.

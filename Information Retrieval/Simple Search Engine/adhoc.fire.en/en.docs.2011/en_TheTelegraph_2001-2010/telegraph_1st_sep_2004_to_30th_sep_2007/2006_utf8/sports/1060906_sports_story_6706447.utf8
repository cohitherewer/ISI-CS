 Coach: Well stay positive

 - AFC Asian Cup Qualifier vs Saudi Arabia

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: Hosts Saudi Arabia will be without their star striker Yasser Al Qahtani when they take on India in the return-leg tie of the AFC Asian Cup qualifiers in Jeddah on Wednesday, but national coach Bob Houghton feels the visitors should be more organised than they were in their home match in Calcutta. 

Speaking from the team hotel, Houghton said he was aware that Saudis would be too hot to handle on their home ground, but India will continue to play in the same positive fashion they did in Calcutta. 

We have to combine between good defence and good attack, naturally, Houghton said. 

My boys watched the Saudi-Japan match the other day. They know the home side will be sharper on a smooth surface like this. In Calcutta the match was played on a wet pitch. Here the conditions are perfect for them. 

Asked whether India would play for a draw against their much higher-ranked Saudis, Houghton said his team was looking forward to dish out a good display. A victory is always the most desired result, but one has to work according to the situation. I shall be most satisfied if my boys play good, positive football. 

Houghton said he has plans to play Anupam Sarkar in place of Venkatesh, but not in the midfield. While Sarkar is likely to occupy his original stopper back position, Mehrajuddin may be asked to take up the workload in the midfield. 

In Calcutta, Saudi Arabia defeated India 3-0. After beating Japan1-0 through a Saleh Bashir goal, Saudis lead the group with nine points, while Japan are second on six. Yemen, with three points, are third while India are yet to get off the mark. 

Indian captain Bhaichung Bhutia said he was aware that Saudis could be tougher at the Prince Abdullah Al-Faisal Stadium. All I can say is that we are determined to play better than what we did in Calcutta. 

The match will be telecast live on Zee Sports on Wednesday from 10.30pm.

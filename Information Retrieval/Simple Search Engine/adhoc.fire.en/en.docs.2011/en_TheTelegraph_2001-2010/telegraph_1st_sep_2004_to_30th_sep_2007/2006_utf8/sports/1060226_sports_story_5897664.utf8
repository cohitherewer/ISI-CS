 Rotterdam: Swede tennis star Thomas Johansson will be sidelined for four months after injuring his eye during a training session on Thursday. Johansson, the world No. 13, was preparing for Friday?s doubles quarter final at the Rotterdam World tournament with his playing partner Mario Ancic when a ball hit him in the eye.

 The 2002 Australian Open winner had to have surgery at the Dijkzigt hospital in Rotterdam to repair a detached retina.

 San Francisco: Soviet-born track coach Remi Korchemny, the fourth and final defendant in the Balco steroid scandal, was given a year?s probation on Friday for his role in a conspiracy to distribute illegal drugs to athletes.

 US district court Judge Susan Illston also ordered that Korchemny undergo random drug testing. However, she refused to impose a recommended $250 fine, calling it trivial, and added that ?a huge fine was not appropriate either?.

 London: The British Racing Drivers Club (BRDC) is confident that a multi-million pound redevelopment of Silverstone will go ahead despite a majority of its members forcing the postponement of a vote on the proposals this week.

 BRDC president Jackie Stewart believes the modernisation of the circuit, which is based at a former RAF site, is the only way to guarantee the future of the British Formula One Grand Prix after its current deal runs out in 2009.

 The non-profit making BRDC, which owns the Silverstone circuit, held a an EGM on Wednesday to vote on putting the facility under the control of Northern Racing, a company which runs nine British horse racing venues.

 Berlin: Health authorities in Germany?s southern state of Bavaria have said they will put up signs in brothels during the 2006 World Cup to remind clients of a local law obliging them to use condoms. ?Clearly visible and readable? posters will be put up in brothels in Bavaria during the world?s biggest football extravaganza, which Germany is hosting from June 9 to July 9, the state?s health ministry said. Bavaria has a regulation in force stating that men must wear condoms when they visit prostitutes. 

 Madrid: Real Madrid defender Jonathan Woodgate says he has put thoughts of making the England World Cup squad out of his head after suffering his latest injury setback. The English centre-back will be out of action for two to three weeks after straining his hamstring in the opening minutes of his side?s 0-1 defeat against Arsenal in the Champions League on Tuesday. Asked if he was still dreaming of winning a place in the England squad for the World Cup, Woodgate responded ?Right now, no? in an interview published by a Spanish sports daily on Saturday.

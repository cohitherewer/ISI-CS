 Nadeem leads India colts fightback

London: Left-arm spinner Shahbaz Nadeem brought India U-19 back into the game with his fine bowling performance on the opening day of the second four-day match against England U-19 at the Taunton County Ground on Tuesday. 

The hosts had a flying start with skipper Varun Chopra (123) leading from the front and putting up a solid 121-run partnership with Billy Godleman (40) for the opening wicket. 

Nadeem gave the first breakthrough with the wicket of Godleman before three wickets fell for six runs as England slipped from a strong 159 for one. 

The Jharkhand spinners scalps included Michael Shea (0) and Adam Lyth (1) while leading the tourists fightback. 

At tea, the English were 190 for four.

 Gibbs 92 steadies SA

 Herschelle Gibbs 

Colombo: Opener Herschelle Gibbs top-scored with a battling 92 to steer South Africa into a strong position against Sri Lanka on the third day of the second Test on Sunday. 

South Africa, who scored 361 in the first innings and bowled Sri Lanka out for 321, batted through a closely-fought third day to close on 257 for seven. Gibbs batted positively in the morning and then grafted hard during the afternoon as Sri Lanka bowled tightly to defensive fields. 

The 32-year-old right-hander stroked 11 boundaries and one six during a 190-ball innings before missing out of what could have been his first Test hundred for 19 months and the 15th of his career. 

Nevertheless, it was a timely return to form for a batsman who had passed 20 only once in his previous 11 innings. 

The Sri Lankans were kept in the game by Muttiah Muralidharan who snared three wickets in the final session to finish with four for 86,

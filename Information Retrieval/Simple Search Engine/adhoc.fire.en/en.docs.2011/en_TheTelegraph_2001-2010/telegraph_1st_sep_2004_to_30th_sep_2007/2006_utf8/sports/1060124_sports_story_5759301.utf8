 Allan Donald applies for England job

Cape Town: Former South Africa fast bowler Allan Donald said on Sunday he had applied for the vacant position of England bowling coach. 

Donald, who took 330 wickets in 72 Tests at an average of 22.25 for his country before retiring in 2003, said frustration had led him to apply to join coach Duncan Fletchers Team England. 

I have a passion for being around international cricketers. I love being in the dressing room and I love dealing with players at the highest level, Donald said on Monday. 

At the moment I get the feeling there is no way in for me to South African cricket, so thats one of the reasons I applied. 

There is an opportunity for me to grab onto something I love... whether its the South African cricket team or the England cricket team, it doesnt matter. I love being around the international stage and being involved. 

England were left looking for a new bowling coach after Troy Cooley agreed last month to return to Australia to help his countrymen try to win back the Ashes. (REUTERS)

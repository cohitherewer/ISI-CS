Calcutta: Last December, East Bengal became the first Calcutta club to appoint a foreign coach (its another matter he lasted less than six months). On Friday, the red-and-golds unveiled the first full-fledged Brazilian coach to take charge of any Indian outfit. 

Carlos Roberto Pereira da Silva, fresh from guiding Boavista to the second division summit in the Rio de Janeiro league, landed in Calcutta early morning to take up his new job (a one-year contract, with a provision for extension). 

Interacting with the media in the afternoon, Pereira said his knowledge of Indian football and footballers was limited to a couple of players he had seen in the 90s. I have coached in Asian countries like Singapore, Qatar and Saudi Arabia, but dont know much about Indian football. I do remember seeing a couple of Indian players when I was coaching in Qatar, they were quite good. 

Why did he leave Brazil and take up an assignment in India? I have coached outside Brazil quite a bit. Also, the standard in India is not very high, so its a big challenge coaching in such a country. I spoke to my wife when the offer came before agreeing to take it up, said the much-travelled coach. 

The coachs job is in the field, guiding the footballers, it doesnt matter which country he is working in, added the 60-year-old. He didnt have an interpreter, though he did struggle to pick up some of the questions thrown at him. 

He said it will take him one or two weeks to get a hang of the East Bengal team. I will first need to talk to my assistants (Bikash Panji and Tarun Dey, who were next to him) and maybe see some videos before getting an idea about how to shape the future, said Pereira, adding that his target was to make East Bengal the champions. 

The Brazilians personal preference is the 4-4-2 system, but wont mind any other formation which the team may be more comfortable in. There may not be players suitable for 4-4-2, in that case Ill have no problem guiding them in whatever system they are accustomed to, said Pereira. 

Tarun, who has been appointed manager (technical), pledged full support to the Brazilian and even said he was eager to learn from Pereira. 

 The teams first session with the new coach will 

 be on Saturday morning.

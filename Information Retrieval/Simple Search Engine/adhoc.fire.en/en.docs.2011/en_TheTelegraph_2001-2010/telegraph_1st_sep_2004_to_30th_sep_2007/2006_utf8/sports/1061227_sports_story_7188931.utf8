The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Vengsarkar: Cant say if a precedent has been set

 - The day after Irfan Pathan was told he would have to return home from South Africa 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 (AB0VE) IRFAN PATHAN,DILIP VENGSARKAR 

Durban: Right now, I cant say if a precedent has been set... Irfan (Pathan) hadnt been bowling well, which is why hes going home... Im sure he will make a comeback and domestic cricket is going to benefit him, is what the selection committee chairman, Dilip Vengsarkar, had to say the day after an unprecedented decision was taken. 

Speaking to The Telegraph on Tuesday morning, he added: As Ive said, the decision was made collectively and Irfan agreed that he would be better off bowling, say, 100 overs (in two first-class matches for Baroda) at home instead of sitting in the dressing room during the last two Tests in South Africa... 

That Vengsarkar played safe is understandable. I suppose such situations will have to be handled on a player-by-player basis... I cant declare weve taken a decision for all time to come... Also, how can we assume somebody else, too, is going to go through a similar patch? 

While its definitely better to be playing instead of serving as the drinks man, the top question is: Who will sort out Pathans problems in India? And, who is going to monitor his progress? 

The questions, perhaps, ought to have been answered before Pathan was asked to start packing. He may begin the journey home on Wednesday. 

Incidentally, asked whether hed discussed his suggestion for a bowling coach Bruce Reid did that job, for a while, in 2003-04 Vengsarkar replied: No... We havent talked about it... 

Bit unusual that.

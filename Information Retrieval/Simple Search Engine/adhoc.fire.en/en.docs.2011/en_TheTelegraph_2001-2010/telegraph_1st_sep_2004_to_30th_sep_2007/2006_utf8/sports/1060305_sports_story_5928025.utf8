 Jakarta: Shiv Kapur started 

 his customary weekend charge with a blemish-free six-under 

 66 that rocketed him to tied fourth from 29th place in the 

 $1 million Enjoy Jakarta Indonesian HSBC Open at Emeralda 

 Golf Club.

 After the third round, Shiv is 

 10-under with scores of 72, 68 and 66. He is five off the 

 lead held by Australians Andrew Buckle and Simon Dyson.

 Meanwhile, Rahil Gangjee overcame 

 his problems on the front nine with three birdies on the 

 back. His card of 71 saw him to a total of nine-under 207, 

 tied for eighth after being fifth after two rounds.

 Jyoti Randhawa carded an even 

 par 72 with four birdies and an equal number of bogeys to 

 total two-under 214 and is in tied 52nd place.

 Jeev Milkha Singh blotted his 

 card with three bogeys over the last four holes and dropped 

 to one-over 73 for the day and is now even par for three 

 rounds in tied 62nd place. 

 Buckle began with three birdies 

 in a row and had a bogey-free 65, while Dyson, who opened 

 with an eagle, shot a 67.

 I try not to watch the leaderboards 

 to be honest, Dyson told reporters.

 I just want to keep playing 

 as I have been doing and shooting sub-par rounds. I think 

 if one of us shoots four or five under tomorrow, it could 

 take it.

 Im playing well and 

 hitting my tee shots good as I kept the ball on the fairways, 

 the Brisbane-born Buckle said.

 I hit a couple of shots 

 off line but managed to get out of trouble, but Im 

 putting well which is the main thing here.Wang Ter-Chang 

 of Chinese Taipei, also starting with an eagle, had a 70 

 for a total of 12-under for third place.

 Shiv birdied the first, fifth 

 and ninth holes and then added three more on the 13th, 16th 

 and 17th to card a 66.

 That felt good and I am 

 happy I did not drop any shots. Andrew (Buckle) and Simon 

 (Dyson) are five ahead, but it should be an interesting 

 final day, said Shiv, who is having a good season 

 as he straddles between Asian and European tour events.

 He is tied for fourth with Thongchai 

 Jaidee (72), David Higgins (69) and Stephen Dodd (74).

 Gangjee opened on the first and 

 dropped shots at sixth and eighth and turned in two-over. 

 On the back nine, he birdied the 10th, 14th and 16th to 

 come under par at 71. (PTI)

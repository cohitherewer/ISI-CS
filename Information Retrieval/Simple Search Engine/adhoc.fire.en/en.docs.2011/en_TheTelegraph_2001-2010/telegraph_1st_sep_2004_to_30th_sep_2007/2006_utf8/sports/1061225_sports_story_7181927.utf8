 Pal denies comments

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: CAB joint secretary Saradindu Pal denied having told the BCCIs working committee in Mumbai on Saturday that Jagmohan Dalmiya no longer functioned as the affiliate units president. 

BCCI treasurer N. Srinivasan on Saturday claimed that Pal had told the working committee that Dalmiya no longer functions as CABs president and an emergency meeting on Wednesday will take steps to implement the BCCIs decision. 

Accusing Srinivasan of misinterpreting facts, Pal said on Sunday: I never said Dalmiya is not the CAB president. I have been misquoted by Srinivasan. He has twisted my comments... The BCCI asked me whether the CAB was taking steps in sync with SGMs decision to expel Dalmiya. I said, yes, we were considering the matter with all seriousness. And we have convened a working committee meeting on Wednesday to discuss it, he said. 

Pal said the CAB has to go through whatever procedure has been laid down in its constitution. 

Meanwhile, it is learnt that Dalmiya may not attend Wednesdays meeting.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Kallis confirms class with rare feat

 - SA take unbeatable 2-0 lead 

 Kallis 

East London: Allrounder Jacques Kallis became the first player to score 8,000 runs and take 200 wickets in both Test and one-day cricket in South Africas six-wicket win over Zimbabwe on Monday. 

The South African captain reached the milestone when he pushed the first ball he faced, bowled by medium pacer Piet Rinke, to mid-on for a single in the second one-day International in East London. 

Kallis, who scored 26, went into the match with 7,999 runs and 205 wickets in ODIs. In Tests, he has scored 8,033 runs and taken 200 wickets. 

South Africa took an unbeatable 2-0 lead in the three-match series with a more convincing display than they did in winning the first match by five wickets in Kimberley on Friday (reported in Tuesdays Late City edition). 

 Zimbabwe were dismissed for a mediocre 152 in 49.4 

 overs, to which South Africa replied with 156 for four in 

 27.4 overs. We got the rust out the other day in Kimberley, 

 and the boys put in a good performance, Kallis said. 

 We have lots of work to do from here, but its 

 a pleasing result, he told reporters. (Reuters)

Calcutta: Runners-up Mohun Bagan finished their CFL Premier Division campaign with a 3-0 win over United SC on Wednesday. 

In a zero-consequence game, Guy Endem Herve shot home from just inside the penalty box in the fifth minute. Dharamjit Singh made it 2-0 in the 37th minute, pouncing on a loose ball after a corner had created confusion in the United SC goalmouth. 

Quite fittingly, Dipendu Biswas netted the last goal in the 70th minute. Latching on to a fine through from the middle of the park, Dipendu finished it off with a smart shot from just outside the box. Dipendu thus finished with eight goals to take him atop the scorers list, one clear of Mike Okoro.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Ronaldo more valuable than Ronaldinho

Zurich: Ronaldos hotel room topped that of teammate Ronaldinhos in an online auction, fetching 1,010 Swiss francs ($825.8) for a one-night stay in the room of Brazils leading striker after the teams stay in Switzerland. 

I was surprised that Ronaldo came out on top, said assistant manager Philipp Musshafen at the Park Hotel in Weggis, which launched the auction. 

The Brazilian team set up camp at the luxury hotel at the foot of the Swiss Alps last week to train for the World Cup in neighbouring Germany next month. 

Ronaldinhos hotel room fetched 850 francs. In total the five rooms auctioned, including those of Kaka, Adriano and Roberto Carlos, reaped 3,200 francs. 

We will donate the amount to a Brazilian institution, Park Hotels Musshafen said. 

The winners will spend the night of June 3 at the hotel, just hours after the Brazilians move out at the end of their two-week stay. 

They will also be given signed Brazilian football shirts. Normal rates for the five rooms on offer range from 480 to 780 Swiss francs each.

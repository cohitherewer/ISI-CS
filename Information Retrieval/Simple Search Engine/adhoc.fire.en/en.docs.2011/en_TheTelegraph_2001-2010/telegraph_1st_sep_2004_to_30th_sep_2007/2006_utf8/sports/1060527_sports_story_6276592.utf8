 England lose game, keeper

Reading: England goalkeeper Robert Green is virtually certain to miss the World Cup after suffering a serious groin injury in a B international against Belarus ? which England lost 1-2 ? on Thursday. 

Jermaine Jenas gave England a 35th minute lead but Vitaly Kutuzov scored a freak equaliser in the 50th minute when Green, Englands third-choice keeper for the World Cup, collapsed in agony with a groin injury as he took a goal-kick. 

Green, who had only taken over from David James five minutes earlier for the second half, was carried off on a stretcher. Its bad news ? almost for sure he is out of the World Cup, coach Sven-Goran Eriksson said. 

Liverpools Scott Carson, Englands standby keeper for Germany, took over between the posts at Reading and will now be promoted into the World Cup squad. Manchester Uniteds Ben Foster has been called up as stand-by keeper.

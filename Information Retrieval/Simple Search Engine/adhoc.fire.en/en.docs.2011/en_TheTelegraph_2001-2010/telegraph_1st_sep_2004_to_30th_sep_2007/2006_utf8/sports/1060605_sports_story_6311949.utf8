The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Power of prayer

Berlin: Two-time champions Argentina may never win another World Cup because of a broken promise. In 1986 the national team trained for several weeks in Tilcara, a small town near the border with Bolivia. 

The team and coach Carlos Bilardo also went to pray in front of the Virgen of Copacabana, asking for strength to win the World Cup. Bilardo promised that if it won, the team would return to give thanks. 

Argentina did win, defeating West Germany 3-2 in the final. But it seems that they never returned to keep their promise, leading residents of Tilcara say they would never win the World Cup again. 

Julio Humberto Grondona, president of the Argentine Football Association, and other team officials went recently to Tilcara ? just in case Bilardo hadnt. However, Bilardo claims he did return, apparently on a private visit that went unnoticed. (AP)

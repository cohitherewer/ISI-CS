 New twist to Shaharyar departure

 2011 World Cup 

Karachi: Amid reports of disagreement between the Pakistan and Indian cricket boards over allotment of 2011 World Cup matches, it has emerged that former PCB chief Shaharyar Khan may have paid the price for not working out a deal to the liking of President Pervez Musharraf. 

According to sources, documents about the World Cup deal were sent to Musharraf some months ago. Shaharyar had apparently told Musharraf that Pakistan would get to host the final or at least both the semis but the deal which was eventually worked out had Pakistan hosting only one of the semis. 

Although it is not the only reason, it played a part in causing Shaharyar Khans exit, a newspaper quoted sources as saying on Tuesday. 

The President had asked PCB to try to get rights of organising more matches since Pakistan was the primary presenter of the bid while India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh had joined later. (PTI)

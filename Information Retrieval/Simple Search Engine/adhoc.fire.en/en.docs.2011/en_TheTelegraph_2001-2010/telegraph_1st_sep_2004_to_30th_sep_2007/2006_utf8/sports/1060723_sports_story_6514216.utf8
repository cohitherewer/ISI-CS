 Cannavaro aims high for Real

Madrid: Italys World Cup-winning captain Fabio Cannavaro has said he is looking forward to the challenge of helping Real Madrid get back to winning ways next season. 

I cant understand how a team as big as Real have not won a title for so long (three years), Cannavaro told a Spanish sports daily on Saturday. 

They are the biggest and the best and will return to being winners. I have signed for them to win things and to help Real be even bigger. 

On Wednesday the Primera Liga club said they had agreed a deal with Juventus for the 32-year-old centre-back and his Brazilian teammate Emerson. 

Real are the type of club where you are expected to win every game. For a player who wants to be the best, it is stimulating to feel the pressure to defend their interests, he said. 

Cannavaro will link up with his former coach at Juventus, Fabio Capello, who swapped Turin for Madrid earlier this month. (Reuters)

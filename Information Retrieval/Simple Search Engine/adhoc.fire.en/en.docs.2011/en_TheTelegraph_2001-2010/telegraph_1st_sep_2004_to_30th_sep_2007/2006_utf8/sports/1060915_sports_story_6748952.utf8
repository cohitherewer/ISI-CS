 Chawla adds to Pak woes with 146

Karachi: Captain Piyush Chawla showed his batting skills with a hard-hitting 146 to put India U-19 in command against Pakistan on the second day of the four-day Test in Peshawar on Thursday. 

Chawla and overnight double centurion Tanmay Srivastava (220) led India to an imposing total of 611 for nine declared at the Arbab Niazi Stadium. 

The 17-year old Uttar Pradesh player then returned to pick a crucial wicket as the Indians reduced the hosts to 109 for six in 38 overs at close. 

Chawla, a leg-spinning allrounder who has played a Test for Team India earlier this year against England, batted beautifully after the visitors resumed on a solid 393 for four with Srivastava on 213 runs.

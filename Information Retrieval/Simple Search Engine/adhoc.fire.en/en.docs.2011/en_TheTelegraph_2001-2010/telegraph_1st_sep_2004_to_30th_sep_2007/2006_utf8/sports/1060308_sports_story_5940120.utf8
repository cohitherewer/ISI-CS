 Thorpe, Radcliffe withdraw

 - GAMES ROBBED OF TWO BIGGEST DRAWs 

 Ian Thorpe in Sydney on Tuesday 

Sydney: The Commonwealth Games was robbed of two of its biggest drawcards on Tuesday when Australias Olympic and World Swimming champion Ian Thorpe and English marathon world champion Paula Radcliffe both pulled out. 

His eyes glazed and throat croaking, Thorpe revealed at a news conference that he had been suffering from bronchitis and a viral infection since February, but doctors were unable to diagnose the exact problem. 

It was difficult coming to terms with not being able to compete but in the end it was the only decision I could come to, Thorpe said at the conference, broadcast live on Australian television. 

Radcliffe, meanwhile, has pulled out because of a foot injury, her husband and manager Gary Lough said.The 32-year-old, who won gold for England in the 5,000m at the Manchester Games four years ago, has not fully recovered after bruising her right foot in January. 

Paula hit a rock when out training in January and developed a bruised foot and it is taking a long time to settle down, Lough said in a statement. 

Elite athletes are especially susceptible to infection because their intense training weakens the bodys immune system and they are unable to use medication because the most effective drugs are on the banned list. 

A five-time Olympic gold medallist, Thorpe said he cut back on his training in an attempt to shake off the bug but had resigned himself to missing the Games. Id struggled for so long and I was trying to push myself to be at a stage where I could compete ? not be up to scratch but be a part of the team. 

But it wouldnt have been a good performance by me if I did compete... I would have been of little, if any, benefit to the team. 

The 23-year-old missed last years world championships in Montreal and was eager to return to the pool in Melbourne. 

Ive never taken so many tablets as I have in the past two weeks ... I could do more damage than good even attempting to compete, he said. 

The absence of the Thorpedo will be a major blow for organisers already struggling to sell tickets at the event, which features 71 nations, mostly former British colonies, and is about one-third the size of the summer Olympics. 

Meeanwhile, Radcliffes husband said: We feel it would be too much of an unnecessary risk to compete in Melbourne. The problem is not affecting her marathon preparations. 

The world marathon champion and record holder, who finally won an elusive global title last year at the Helsinki championships, had been entered for both the 5,000 and 10,000 metres.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Apply first, says BCCIs Shah

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Calcutta: Despite being in existence for nearly four years, the Indian Cricket Players Association (ICPA) hasnt sought recognition from the Board. 

We cant be guided by what individuals say? The players body must apply and, only then, can we take a decision, informed Board secretary Niranjan Shah. 

Speaking to The Telegraph on Monday evening, not many hours after Team India captain Rahul Dravid called for the ICPAs recognition, he added: The Board, in any case, regularly has a dialogue with the senior players. We work with them? So? 

Obviously, the change in guard (Jagmohan Dalmiya wasnt bothered about the ICPA, not even in the lead-up to introducing central contracts), with Sharad Pawar now at the helm, hasnt changed the Boards stand. 

Asked why the ICPA hadnt sought recognition, vice-president (and spokesman) Arun Lal said: Thats because we didnt want the previous dispensation to say no? Perhaps, we will do so now. 

Lal, of course, was actively involved with the last players body as well ? the Association of Indian Cricketers. 

Nobody remembers it, though, just as nobody remembers the body formed by some seniors in the mid-Seventies or thereabouts. 

Dravids call has come at a time when the International Cricket Council has begun to move away from the Federation of International Cricketers Association (Fica). 

The Board, by the way, has consistently been anti Fica. 

Getting back to the ICPA, it was formed when the Sourav Gangulys were caught in the high-voltage Players Terms dispute with the world body. 

Many were of the view, then, that the enthusiasm would wane once the dispute got settled. Thats exactly how the ICPA-cookie has crumbled. 

Except possibly a chosen few, nobody knows anything about its activities. 

Thats a pity as the ICPA is headed by our most revered captain ? Mansur Ali Khan Tiger Pataudi. 

While Anil Kumble is also a vice-president, Dravid is one of the five founding members. Abbas Ali Baig, Ravi Shastri, Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav are the others. 

The profile couldnt be higher, but the Board hasnt been impressed. The ask for the Dravids doesnt seem easy.

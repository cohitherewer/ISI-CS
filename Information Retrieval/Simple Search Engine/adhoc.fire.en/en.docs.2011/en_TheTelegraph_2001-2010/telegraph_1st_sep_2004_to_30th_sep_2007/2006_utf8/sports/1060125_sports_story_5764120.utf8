 Yet another dull draw on the cards

Faisalabad: Younis Khan and Kamran Akmal scored unbeaten half centuries to take Pakistan to 152 for one and put the second Test against India firmly on the path to another draw with a day to go on Tuesday. 

After conceding a slender first innings lead of 15 runs, Pakistan ended the fourth day 137 runs ahead of India, who were bowled out for an epic 603 in reply to Pakistans 588, half an hour after lunch. 

The swashbuckling Mahendra Singh Dhoni (148) and Irfan Pathan (90) took India past the follow-on threat. The tailenders then topped it off by earning a small lead before the innings folded up for a mammoth 603. 

Resuming at the overnight score of 441 for five, Dhoni and Pathan scored freely before Danish Kaneria brought an end to the 210-run partnership by sending back the wicketkeeper batsman. 

Their stand set a new benchmark of 210 runs, erasing the nearly two-decade-old mark of 143 between Mohammed Azharuddin and Kapil Dev made at Calcutta in 1986-87. 

Dhoni clobbered 19 boundaries and four sixes during his 153-ball stay, while Pathan was unlucky to miss his maiden Test century by 10 runs. The dashing stumper added 28 more runs in quick time, forcing Pakistan pace spearhead Shoaib Akhtar off the attack after only three overs. 

He straight-drove Shoaib with disdain and then carted him to the square leg fence in the sixth over of the day to continue his defiance. 

The frustrated Shoaib came around the wicket and bowled a beamer, which was also pulled away with total disdain to fine leg for a four by Dhoni. 

The ball earned Shoaib a caution from umpire Simon Taufel and he was taken off soon afterwards after giving up 27 runs in three overs. 

The 24-year-old wicketkeeper was stumped by his Pakistani counterpart Akmal when he was stranded yards out of his crease off Kaneria, whom he had whacked for three sixes on Monday. 

India, 491 for six at Dhonis dismissal, later lost Pathan when the left-hander fell for the second time in the 90s in his short career. 

The seamer who can double up as a handy batsman, was trapped leg before by Abdul Razzaq. He struck nine fours and two sixes in his 171-ball knock and fell when India were 60 runs short of overhauling the home side score. 

But the tail wagged doggedly after their dismissal. 

Anil Kumble added 15 before being Kanerias second victim, Harbhajan Singh clubbed the ball around to hit five fours and two sixes in his 48-ball 38, while Zaheer Khan remained unbeaten on 20. 

Pakistan started briskly in the second knock with Akmal and Salman Butt (37) putting on 52 runs in 11.5 overs, before the latter pulled Kumble straight to Sachin Tendulkar at short mid wicket. 

Butt, lucky to see Laxman grassing a regulation slip catch, twice struck Pathan towards mid wicket and then cover drove the bowler for another boundary.

 Ronaldo transfer

Madrid: Real Madrid president Ramon Calderon said on Tuesday that he will receive representatives from AC Milan to talk over the possible transfer of Ronaldo. 

I will talk to Milan when they come tomorrow, Calderon said. I know they have already talked to the player and I dont think that is right, but we are still prepared to receive representatives from any friendly club. 

Calderon insisted that Real did not want to sell the 30-year-old three-time World Player of the Year, but did not rule out his sale if Milan were prepared to offer Brazil midfielder Kaka in exchange.

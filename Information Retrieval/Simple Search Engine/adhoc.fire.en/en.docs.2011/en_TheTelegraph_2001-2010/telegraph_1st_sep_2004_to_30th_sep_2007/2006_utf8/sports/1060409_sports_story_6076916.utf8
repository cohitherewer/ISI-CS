Melbourne: Wayne Arthurs and Paul Hanley ground down Max Mirnyi and Vladimir Voltchkov 3-6, 6-4, 5-7, 6-3, 7-5 to give Australia an unassailable 3-0 lead over Belarus in their Davis Cup quarter final on Saturday. 

The Australian pair coped better with the blustery conditions at Kooyong, sealing victory on their third match point when Voltchkov sent a service return long. 

Australia captain John Fitzgerald paid tribute to his inexperienced team. All you can do is prepare the right way and rely on players who have good character and who can handle the pressure, he told a news conference. 

The Belarussians started well, breaking Hanleys serve in the eighth game on the way to wining the opening set. 

Arthurs and Hanley then broke Mirnyi before levelling the match, but Voltchkov was the inspiration as Belarus again broke Hanleys serve in the third set to edge ahead. 

Belarus scented victory when they created two break points on Arthurs serve at 2-2 in the fourth, but the left-hander dug in to hold and the Australians immediately broke Mirnyi again. Voltchkov then lost his serve in the 11th game of the deciding set and Hanley calmly served out to seal victory in nearly four hours. 

I was really nervous, really tight today, and I couldnt release myself, the 35-year-old Arthurs said. 

Chris Guccione and Lleyton Hewitt had given Australia a 2-0 lead with victories over Mirnyi and Voltchkov in the opening singles matches on Friday. 

Earlier, Russia took command of their Davis Cup quarter final but holders Croatia had to be content with a share of the opening singles rubbers on Friday. 

Wins for Marat Safin and Nikolay Davydenko gave Russia a 2-0 lead over France in Pau. In Zagreb, Croatias Ivan Ljubicic came back from two sets and 4-1 down in the third set tie-break to beat Argentine Agustin Calleri in five sets. David Nalbandian, though, redressed the balance by thrashing Croatian teenager Marin Cilic. 

The US and Chile were locked at 1-1 in Rancho Mirage, California. 

Fernando Gonzalez gave Chile a surprise 1-0 lead with an epic 6-7, 0-6, 7-6, 6-4, 10-8 win over James Blake before Andy Roddick levelled the tie by beating Nicolas Massu 6-3, 7-6, 7-6. 

In Pau, French 19-year-old Richard Gasquet ran out of steam at the end of an enthralling five-setter against 2005 Australian Open champion Safin. 

Safin, who returned from a seven-month injury layoff, prevailed 7-6, 4-6, 6-3, 6-7, 6-1 to banish any fears about his match fitness. (Reuters)

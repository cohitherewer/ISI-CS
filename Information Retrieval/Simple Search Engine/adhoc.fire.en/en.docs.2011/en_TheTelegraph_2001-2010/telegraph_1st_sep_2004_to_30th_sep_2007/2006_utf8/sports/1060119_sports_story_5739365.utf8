The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 No pressure on us: Deep 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Baroda coach Balwinder Singh Sandhu is pretty confident that his boys will give their best against Bengal in their Ranji Trophy semi-final which starts at the Eden from Friday. 

It will be a good game of cricket. The boys have worked hard this season and hopefully they would perform the same here as well, said Sandhu after the teams practice at the ground on Wednesday. 

Baroda are high on spirit following a 220 run win in their last match against Hyderabad. But the absence of opener Satyajit Parab ??? out with a knee injury ??? still remains a problem for the visiting team. 

Captain Jacob Martin admitted that Parabs absence will be felt in the match. Obviously we are going to miss him and his experience, he said. 

On the absence of another senior player Zaheer Khan, who is currently with Team India in Pakistan, Sandhu said: We started the season keeping in mind that Zaheer wouldnt be with us for the full season 

Meanwhile, Bengal skipper Deep Dasgupta said that it is going to be just another match for the hosts. There is no pressure on us as such. We are not taking this game as a semi-final. It is going to be just another match which we want to win. 

The young guys have played well and have shown that they can shoulder responsibilities, added Deep.

 BCCI move on hold, not shelved

 - APPOINTMENT OF PROFESSIONAL SELECTORS 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Calcutta: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has put on hold not shelved a move for professional selectors. 

A special committee which met in New Delhi on March 26, with former president Inderjit Singh Bindra in the chair, had recommended that the senior national selectors must be on contract and should have fixed terms. 

Also, that the quintets appointment must not be on zonal lines, as has been the practice all these years. 

Among others, that meeting was attended by Team India captain Rahul Dravid and immediate predecessor Sourav Ganguly. 

However, while the selectors term got pruned from a maximum of four to three years, when the BCCIs constitution got amended earlier this year, the method of their appointment wasnt changed. 

The issue (of professional selectors) was discussed at the appropriate level, but no decision taken The top reason being finding people who dont have other commitments People are either employed, run a business or are office-bearers in state associations Bindra told The Telegraph. 

Speaking on Wednesday evening, he added: The idea, though, hasnt been shelved It has only been put on hold If I may add, the constitution wont have to be amended if the selectors have to be paid If it comes to that, a working committee meeting can take such a decision. 

Back in March, Bindra had said: An agreement was reached on having the best (selectors). Having men of integrity and getting them appointed possibly by the president rather than selected (by the five zones) as is being done Of course, we could still have one selector from each zone as India is huge. 

The next senior national selection committee, meanwhile, is going to have at least one new face as chairman Kiran Mores term is getting over. As of now, three are in contention to succeed him from West Dilip Vengsarkar, Yajuvindra Singh and Dhiraj Parsana. 

There will be another change if South sticks to its intra-zonal policy of rotation. In that case, Tamil Nadus V.B. Chandrasekhar is going to be replaced, most probably by Hyderabads nominee. 

The remaining three selectors Bhupinder Singh (North), Sanjay Jagdale (Central) and Ranjib Biswal (East) are each about to complete one year. 

After the constitutions amendment, they may have a further two years (at one go, mind you) provided they themselves get selected at the AGM in Mumbai later this month. 

Incidentally, not everyone in the region is happy with Biswal, but he heads the Orissa Cricket Association and, so, isnt a lightweight.

 Spinners to have a big role in World Cup: Harbhajan

Jalandhar: Harbhajan Singh on Monday predicted a significant role for slow bowlers in the World Cup to be held next year in the Caribbean where he said the pitches had become spinner-friendly. 

During our tour of the Caribbean, most of the pitches were slow, and especially in the Test series, during the second innings the ball kept low and ultimately the batsmen were beaten, he told reporters here on Monday. 

Wickets in the West Indies were similar to those in Asian countries like India and Sri Lanka, which helped us in understanding its nature early, he said, adding that the teams experience would come in handy at the World Cup. 

Harbhajan admitted that the fast bowlers in the team played a crucial role in the teams 1-0 Test series triumph. 

The fast bowlers contributed to the success of (the) spinners in the last two matches by their early breakthroughs, which left less pressure on the spinners, he added. 

Commenting on the tour, he said that although the one-day series was quite disappointing, ultimately the team came back strongly in the Tests. 

Laras able captaincy was the key to West Indies success in the ODI series. Although we started with a very good rhythm, later on West Indies overtook us which yielded results in their favour. 

Harbhajan sought to downplay his exclusion from the first two Tests, saying it was up to the team management to pick the best eleven. 

As far as I am concerned, I was eagerly looking for an opportunity which I finally got in the third and fourth Tests, and I proved my mettle in both of these, he said. 

Asked whether he considered his haul of five wickets for 13 runs in 4.3 overs as his best performance, he said: My best is yet to come and I will try to do much better in the forthcoming tri-series (in Sri Lanka). 

From July 25, our camps will begin, during which we will review our mistakes in the Caribbean and ensure they are not repeated in Sri Lanka. 

Seeking to put a lid to the controversy on whether he was actually injured or dropped for the first two matches, Harbhajan said he was actually injured and captain Rahul Dravid had rightly informed the media about it.

Calcutta: Punjab and Sindh Bank (PSB) lifted the 111th IndianOil Beighton Cup for the fourth time, defeating defending champions BSF, Jalandhar, 1-0 at the Mohun Bagan ground on Monday. 

Mandeep Singh struck the all-important winner in the 34th minute. 

Davinder Singh, having failed to strike the Baljit Singh Chandi penalty corner, relayed it to Mandeep on far right, who dribbled past two BSF defenders and shot home. 

After being drubbed 0-4 by BSF in the quarter final league match, PSB looked a team on a mission. Inspired by coach-cum-player Baljit Singh Saini, PSB were on the attacking mode right from the word go and ripped apart the BSF defence on several occasions. 

Thirteen minutes into the game, PSB earned their first penalty corner, but failed to take the advantage. 

Four minutes later, BSF came close to draw first blood but captain Harbhajan Singh botched up the chance. 

After getting a square pass inside the D from Marianus Lakra who was operating on the left, the BSF captain had only the goalie to beat, but failed to reach the ball in time. 

In the very next minute after PSB went ahead, BSF had a good opportunity to neutralise through a penalty corner. But Habil Topnos attempt from the top of the D was no way near the target. 

Just into the second half, BSF got another chance. An unmarked Ranjit Singh, after getting a diagonal pass from Topno on the left flank, made a solo run but failed to get past the PSB defen-ders. 

Saini proved that he has not lost his finesse as a player. The Olympian, well into his mid-thirties, exhibited brilliant stickwork and created some good chances. 

Had his wards in PSB capitalised on a few of these, the scoreline would have been different. 

PSB were richer by Rs 1,25,000 while the runners-up received Rs 50,000 for their efforts. Gurvinder Singh Chandi was adjudged the Best Player of the tournament, while Indian Airlines were awarded the fair play award.

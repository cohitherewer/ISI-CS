 Strauss to lead

London: Andrew Strauss was named captain of Englands 15-man squad to play Sri Lanka in the five-match ODI series with Andrew Flintoff ruled out for four weeks with an ankle injury. 

Strauss, who led England in the last two ODIs in India, is third choice as regular captain Michael Vaughan is still recovering from a long-term knee injury. 

Flintoff ? who has floating bone fragments in his left ankle ? was injured during the third Test against Sri Lanka, who won on Monday at Trent Bridge to level the series 1-1. 

 Hes the best allrounder in the world, 

 so losing him would affect any team in the world, 

 Kevin Pietersen said on Thursday of Flintoff.

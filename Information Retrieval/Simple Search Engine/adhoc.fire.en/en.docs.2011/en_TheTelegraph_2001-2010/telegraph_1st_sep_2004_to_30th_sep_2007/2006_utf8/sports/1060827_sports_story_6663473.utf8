 Sania falls in Round II

New Delhi: Sania Mirza went down 4-6, 7-5, 3-6 to fourth seed Lourdes Dominguez Lino of Spain in the singles second round match at the Forest Hill Classic in New York. 

Resuming at the score of 3-4 in the first set, which was interrupted when rains lashed the centre court on Thursday, Sania went down 4-6, 7-5, 3-6 in the tournament. 

The Indian, clinging on to 44th rank for around a month now, was brave enough to fight back into the match in the second set but ran out of steam in the decider to Lino, who is just one rank above her in the WTA charts. (Pti)

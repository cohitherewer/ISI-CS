 England fail to stop the Raina romp

 - Indians equal WI world record 

 - Dhoni plays second fiddle in crucial stand 

JAYDEEP BASU

Faridabad: Rahul Dravids rhetoric on inducting new blood does sound a bit boring at times. Not on Friday though, not after what happened at the Nahar Singh Stadium here. 

The Indian top order was as chaotic as the organisation of the match. It was left to a 19-year-old from Ghaziabad, who answers to the call of Suresh Raina, to show his talent at crunch time and steer India to a four-wicket win over England in the second ODI of the seven-match TVS Cup. 

It was Indias 14th straight ODI win chasing a target, the sequence having begun in Harare against New Zealand at the start of the 2005-06 season. 

No wonder a smile of great satisfaction adorned Dravids visage at the end of the day. What Raina did today was simply spectacular. And mind you, he did it under difficult conditions. It was a tough job. He made it look easy, the Indian skipper said. These youngsters would be assets for years to come. 

The task was certainly tougher than what Raina made it look like during his unbeaten 81 that easily won him the Man-of-the-Match award. The wicket was slow and the ball was not coming on to the bat. When Raina strode out to the middle, the scoreboard read a scary 80 for four. 

A dozen runs had been added to the total when Yuvraj Singh, too, departed. The stage was set for Raina and Mahendra Singh Dhoni to script a memorable fightback, and they did with a brilliant 118-run stand. 

Operation salvage was conducted so smoothly that it seemed these two had been pros for a long period. They got together in the 25th over, with the wicket not at all easy to bat on. Unlike their more illustrious colleagues, they were smart enough to cut out all heroics and took time to settle down. 

Only once had they weathered the English storm and moved to a position of confidence, did they launch the counter-attack. 

With India needing 75 in 12 overs, Raina decided to go for his shots and attacked the England bowling with all his might. First he slammed Liam Plunkett past long-on for a cracking boundary. In the next over, Andrew Flintoff got a taste of Rainas venom when a punch went past mid-off fielder like a bullet. 

Next to suffer was Ian Blackwell, Englands bowler of the day. The sixer Raina hit off the left-arm spinner was a huge hit. The left-hander simply tore into the English bowling. His unbeaten 81 came in 89 balls with the help of eight fours and one six. 

Such was the domination of Raina that even Dhoni was left playing second fiddle ? a true reflection of the left-handers dominance. 

Raina later said they decided to rotate the strike as much as possible. In reality, Raina was dictating terms. 

The 25-thousand capacity crowd greeted Dhoni with thunderous applause when he entered the ground, but soon forgot about the firebrand wicketkeeper-batsman. The chants of Raina, Raina grew louder as the partnership grew in stature and promise. 

Without Raina and his century stand with Dhoni (118 runs in 129 deliveries), it would have been difficult for India to go 2-0 up. 

Chasing 227, the Indian batting, like in Kotla, was again in deep trouble despite a decent start by the opening pair. Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir only flattered to deceive. Dravids run out was unfortunate and Yuvraj was once again played-on after hitting some spectacular boundaries. Kaif fell for a nought for the third time in four innings. 

Another performance that got drowned in Rainas classic effort was Romesh Powars bowling. India included him as the second spinner, in place of Rudra Pratap Singh and he vindicated the team managements decision. 

The Mumbai offie struck when needed most. He captured three crucial wickets ? those of Strauss, Owais Shah and Flintoff ? with deceptive deliveries. 

Kevin Pietersen held the England innings together before falling for 71. Had he been around till the end, England could have reached the 250-mark.

 Gatting hails Anils fighting spirit

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Mohali: Former England captain Mike Gatting also lauded Anil Kumble on Saturday. I didnt notice anything special about him on his debut series. He seemed just like any ordinary bowler, he said. 

The one striking feature I noticed then was his ability to keep fighting. He never surrendered in a hurry. I believe it is this quality that has kept him going over the years. Youve got to laud his achievements.

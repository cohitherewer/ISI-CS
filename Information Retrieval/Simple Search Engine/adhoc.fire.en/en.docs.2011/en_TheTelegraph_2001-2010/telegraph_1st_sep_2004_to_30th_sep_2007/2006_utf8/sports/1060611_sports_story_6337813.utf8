 Lee warning to teammates

Leverkusen: South Korean winger Lee Chun-Soo shot from the hip Saturday with a warning to his teammates that the 2002 semi-finalists had to beat Togo in their opening match or their Cup would be over after just 90 minutes. 

The brash youngster said it was a must win encounter against the African debutants on Tuesday. 

We must win the match against Togo to have a chance of advancing to the second round, was Lees blunt assessment of group G which also includes France and Switzerland.

 SHARP SINGLES 

 Doing their bit for AIDS awareness

Mohali: The ICC Champions Trophy semi-finals saw the players and umpires doing their bit to run out HIV and AIDS by wearing red ribbons as a symbol of support for people living with the illnesses. This initiative is the latest in the ICCs partnership with UNAIDS and Unicef, which aims to educate people about the disease. 

Shaun Pollock, South Africas ICC Spirit of Cricket representative, said: ...AIDS is something that affects everyone... We as cricketers are conscious that we must do our bit to highlight the problem... 

Lara milestone 

Jaipur: Brian Lara on Thursday became only the fourth batsman to hit 1000 boundaries or more in ODIs. Lara, just one away from the mark when he came in to bat against South Africa, hit the four off Robin Peterson to join the club headed by Sachin Tendulkar, who has 1540 boundaries. He is followed by Sanath Jayasuriya on 1239.

Chris Gayle also completed 1000 runs for the year when he reached 10. 

Azhar's advice

Ajmer: With the World Cup just a few months away, former India captain Mohammed Azharuddin wants coach Greg Chappell to stop experimenting. Mohammed Kaif, Yuvraj Singh and Mahendra Singh Dhoni are the finest batsmen in the team and they should play at Nos. 2, 3 and 4, he said.

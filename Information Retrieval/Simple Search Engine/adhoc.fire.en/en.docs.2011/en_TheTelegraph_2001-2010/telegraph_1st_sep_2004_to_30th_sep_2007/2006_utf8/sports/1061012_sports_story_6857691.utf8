 Contracts for Bravo, Ganga, Morton

Bridgetown: Allrounder Dwayne Bravo was one of three players offered retainer contracts by the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB), an apparent retreat for the board that was concerned his personal sponsorship contract conflicted with that of the board. 

Opening batsman Daren Ganga and middle-order batsman Runako Morton also were offered contracts, bringing to 10 the number of players tendered offers by the WICB, board spokesman Tony Deyal confirmed on Tuesday. 

Bravo originally was offered a contract in May, but was pulled from the list when it was felt his contract with bmobile, an arm of Cable amp; Wireless, conflicted with the WICBs main sponsor and telecommunications rival Digicel. 

Morton and Bravo are members of the West Indies squad currently in India for the champion trophy, while Ganga will join the team in November for the tour of Pakistan. 

Contracted players: Bravo, Shivnarine Chanderpaul, Corey Collymore, Fidel Edwards, Ganga, Chris Gayle, Brian Lara, Morton, Dinesh Ramdin and Ramnaresh Sarwan.

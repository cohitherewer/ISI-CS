 Pavel, Deepan share lead

 Hyderabad chess

 Hyderabad: Grandmaster 

 Pavel Kotsur of Kazakhstan caught up with International 

 Master Deepan Chakravarthy in lead with a fine technical 

 victory over IM P. Konguvel in the eighth round of ONGC 

 Cup International Grandmasters Chess being held at Kotla 

 Vijaya Bhaskar Reddy Indoor Stadium on Friday.

 Deepan played an exciting game 

 and finally drew with GM in waiting Reefat Bin Sattar to 

 inch up to seven points and almost made sure of his second 

 GM norm. The Indian had earlier achieved his first norm 

 by winning the Asian Junior Chess a few years back in Colombo.

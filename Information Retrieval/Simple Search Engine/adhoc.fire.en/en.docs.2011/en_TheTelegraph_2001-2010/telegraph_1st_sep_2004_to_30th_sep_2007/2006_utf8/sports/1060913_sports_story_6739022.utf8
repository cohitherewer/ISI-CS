 More slams selection system

New Delhi: Barely three weeks before relinquishing 

 his post, chief selector Kiran More has found fault with 

 the selection system and has also gone to the extent of 

 stating that it is biased. 

 More, who was hardly critical of the process in his 

 three-year tenure, has said he did not believe in the voting 

 system and cited an instance when three selectors had teamed 

 up to pick players of their choice, one of whom happened 

 to be Sourav Ganguly. 

I dont believe in the voting system, More told a television channel. 

This happened in Madras (Chennai) when three selectors walked into the meeting and said this is what they want. (Coach Greg) Chappell and (Rahul) Dravid were also present, he said, according to a press release by the broadcaster. 

We requested the selectors but once three people have decided there is little you can do. Then there is the secretary who plays an important role. But voting is not good at all, he says. 

More was referring to the selection meeting for the first Test against Sri Lanka last year which was the last selection meeting for Yashpal Sharma, Gopal Sharma and Pranab Roy. 

 More also revealed that replacing Sourav as captain 

 was the more tough decision as compared to dropping him 

 from the squad.

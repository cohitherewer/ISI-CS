 Malik surgery to improve action

Karachi: Pakistan allrounder Shoaib Malik is to undergo a shoulder operation in Cape Town next week to try to improve his suspect bowling action. 

The 24-year old has twice been reported due to problems caused by the after-effects of two road accidents which have limited the mobility of his arm extension. 

Maliks problem is that due to those two accidents his arm tendons have become loose. So when he bowls one gets the impression there is a problem with his action, PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan said on Friday. 

The operation is being carried out to loosen his tendons so that his arm extension improves.

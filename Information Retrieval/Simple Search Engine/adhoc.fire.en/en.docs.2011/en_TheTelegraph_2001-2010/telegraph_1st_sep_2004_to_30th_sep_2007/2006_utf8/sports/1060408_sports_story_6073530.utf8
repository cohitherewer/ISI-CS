Mumbai: Prakash Amritraj made amends for teammate Rohan Bopannas embarrassing defeat with a scintillating win over Aqeel Khan which allowed India to restore parity against a spirited Pakistan in the Davis Cup tie here on Friday. 

Amritraj went down 1-4 in both the first and second sets but bounced back to defeat Khan 7-6 (7-5), 7-6 (7-1), 6-4 in the second singles in two hours and 50 minutes at the Brabourne Stadium. 

Amritraj came to Indias rescue after Pakistans No. 1 player Aisam ul-Haq Qureshi had beaten an error-prone Bopanna 7-6 (7-5), 6-4, 6-4 in the opening singles of the Asia-Oceania Zone Group 1 play-off tie. Qureshi, ranked No. 416 in the world, subdued his doubles partner and friend on the tour Bopanna, ranked 235, in two minutes under two hours in the opening singles. 

Bopanna committed a whopping 19 double faults, some of them at crucial stages, to give the match on a platter to his big-serving Pakistani rival. 

Captain Leander Paes will combine with Mahesh Bhupathi to take on Jalil Khan and Asim Shafik in the doubles rubber on Saturday, to be followed by the reverse singles on Sunday. 

It could easily have been Pakistans day after Qureshi had thumped Bopanna out in the first singles and with Amritraj trailing Khan in the first two sets. 

But Amritraj showed tremendous resilience to battle it out under difficult conditions. Both players needed on-court medical attention for cramps in the second set that lasted 66 minutes. 

Amritraj played the percentage game well even as his opponent started committing errors as the match progressed. 

Amritraj, though serving only four aces, volleyed very well and hustled his rival by attacking Khans serve on occasions by rushing to the net. 

Khan committed seven double faults while acing Amritraj on nine occasions, and was especially error-prone when he looked to be on top. 

This helped his Indian rival to make light of one service break in the opening set and two in the second to win them both via the tie-breaker. 

Down 1-4 in the first set after being broken in the fourth game, Amritraj clawed his way back slowly by breaking back in the ninth game as Khan double-faulted twice to reduce his rivals lead to 4-5. 

Amritraj then held serve to draw level at 5-all. In the tie-break, the Indian youngster took a commanding 4-0 lead. Though Khan drew level with the help of some excellent returns, Amritraj had the final word. 

Amritraj went set point up (6-5) with a deep serve and followed it by engaging his rival in a six-stroke baseline rally which finally ended in the Indians favour when Khan netted a backhand. 

In the second, Amritraj was broken twice, in the first and fifth games, to be down 1-4 again before another brilliant fight-back saw him break his rivals serve in the sixth and tenth games and restore parity at five-all. 

Amritraj took a medical time out after the first break back while Khan did likewise after Amritraj went 6-5 up. But he looked increasingly error-prone and listless and lost the second set tie-break quite tamely 7-1 after Amritraj jumped to a 5-0 lead. 

Amritraj was all over his rivals serve in the final set and Khan was forced on the defensive right through his service games. 

He managed to save two break points in the first, two more after deuce was called thrice in the fifth before committing two double-faults and lost his serve in the 7th that gave Amritraj a commanding 4-3 lead.

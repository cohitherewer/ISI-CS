 Roddick sets up date with Federer

New York: Andy Roddick used his serve to subdue Mikhail Youzhny 6-7 (5), 6-0, 7-6 (3), 6-3 on Saturday and earn another chance at top-seeded and heavily favoured Roger Federer in the final of the US Open. 

Im going to go enjoy this for about five minutes, said Roddick, the 2003 champion. Im going to eat and try to get some sleep and come out and try to win a US Open tomorrow. 

Hours earlier, the No. 1-ranked Federer charged into his sixth straight Grand Slam final, overwhelming Nikolay Davydenko 6-1, 7-5, 6-4 (as reported in Sundays City edition). 

Federer is 10-1 lifetime against Roddick, winning 24 of 28 sets. Im just going to throw it all at him, Roddick said. If the guy plays too well, he plays too well. 

Asked what Roddick needed to do to stop the two-time defending US Open champion on Sunday, Youzhny paused. 

 I never beat Roger, I dont know, 

 said Youzhny. (AP)

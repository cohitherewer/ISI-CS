Mohali/Karachi: A Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) official said on Tuesday that the International Cricket Council (ICC) has agreed to review the Members Participating Agreement (MPA) after the Asian bloc refused to sign it before the scheduled deadline. 

The PCB official said the representatives of India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh held talks with ICC president Percy Sonn and his colleagues on the MPA issue on the sidelines of the Champions Trophy over the last few days. 

Contacted by The Telegraph, Inderjit Singh Bindra who is heading the BCCI committee looking into the matter said he had no knowledge of the development. 

I am not aware that the ICC has agreed to review the MPA All I know is that talks are still going on about the matter, Bindra said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Its a new challenge for me: Kumble

Bangalore: Anil Kumble rejoiced on Monday on his recall to the Indias one-day squad and said his inclusion for the South Africa Tour would provide him ample time to tune up for the World Cup. 

Hopefully it is a good start to get involved with the Indian team at this juncture, Kumble, who last played in a one-day match in the Afro-Asian Cup last august, said. 

The focus should not only be on the individuals but also on the team as a whole as the World Cup is fast approaching, the ace leg-spinner said. 

Every one-day International is important but still at the back of the mind, we do have the big event that is coming up. It is a new challenge for me. 

Asked about his shoulder injury that kept him out of the Champions Trophy, the 35-year-old said his rehabilitation was ongoing thing. 

That is a continuing process but I am fine at the moment.

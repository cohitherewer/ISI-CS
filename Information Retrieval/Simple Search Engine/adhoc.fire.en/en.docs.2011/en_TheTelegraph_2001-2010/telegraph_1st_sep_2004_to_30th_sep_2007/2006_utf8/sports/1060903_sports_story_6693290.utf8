 Jeev rallies to tied 2nd

Ito: Jeev Milkha Singh made amends after a lapse in concentration midway through to the third round to turn in a three-under 68 and get to tied second spot in the 150 million yen Fujisankei Classic golf tournament here on Saturday. 

Jeev, however, was five shots behind one of Japans golfing legends, Shingo Katayama, who with another 68, moved to eight-under 205 for 54 holes. 

With rounds of 72, 70 and 68, Jeev shares the second spot with three other local players, Hiroyuki Fujita (69), Kuoki Idoki (69) and Hideto Tanihara (69). 

Five players including Thai Prayad Marksaeng (70) are tied sixth. Only 12 players have under-par totals on the tough par-71 Fujizakura Country Club Course. 

Jeev began the day with three birdies in a row and then added a fourth on sixth, dropped a bogey on 10th and then a double bogey immediately after on 11th. Undeterred, Jeev managed birdies on the 14th and 16th to close a good day at 68. 

I putted much better and hopefully it shall continue tomorrow. That double bogey on 11th was a costly affair, said Jeev, lying 19th on money list in Japan. 

Jeev was well-served by his putter on third day, when he needed just 27 putts to finish his rounds as against 30 and 31 the first two days. 

The Indian has had six top-10 finishes in nine starts in Japan this season and his worst has been a tied 31st in Munsingwear KSB Open. 

His best has been a tied fifth at Japan PGA. He won the Volvo China Open and was also tied fourth at European Open.

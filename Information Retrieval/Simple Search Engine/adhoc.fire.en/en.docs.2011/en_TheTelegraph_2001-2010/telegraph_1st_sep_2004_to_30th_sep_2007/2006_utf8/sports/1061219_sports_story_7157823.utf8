 Had a point to prove: Ponting

Perth: Ricky Ponting was not surprised at how quickly Australia regained the Ashes, saying his team had delivered on a promise to learn from their mistakes of 2005. 

The planning started the moment we got back from England, Ponting said after winning the third Test by 206 runs on Monday. 

The team is unbeaten since the Ashes, winning their last 10 Tests on the trot, and Ponting has scored a mountain of runs to establish himself as the worlds best batsmen. 

I wasnt any more disappointed than the next guy in the dressing room at The Oval 15 months ago, but theres no doubt Ive had a burning desire to be the best player I could be from that moment on and try and lead the team as well as I could. 

Ponting said the key to Australias turnaround was their recognition that they underperformed in the last Ashes and the need to develop strategies to avoid it happening again. 

They hired a series of specialists, including Englands fast bowling coach Troy Cooley, and left no stone unturned in preparing for the series, including attending a military-style boot camp. 

We made a lot of mistakes last time and I couldnt see this team making those same mistakes all over again, Ponting said. 

Ponting said the team had drawn inspiration from claims their players were too old for Tests. 

I think weve all felt that weve had a real point to prove to a lot of people in this series, Ponting said. 

Meanwhile, England captain Andrew Flintoff dismissed suggestions that his teams crushing Ashes defeat was the result of bad planning and poor selections. 

At times weve shown on the field how talented we are... but weve not really been able to apply the pressure on Australia wed have liked to have done, Flintoff said on Monday.

 Delhi to host final

New Delhi: The 2011 World Cup final will be held in Delhi, probably at a new stadium to be built by the BCCI. 

It was decided that Delhi will host the final while the two semi-finals will be shared between Pakistan and Sri Lanka, BCCI vice-president Lalit Modi said on Monday. 

Bangladesh will host the opening ceremony, he said adding that the decision was taken at a meeting of the four national boards in London recently. 

The final is most likely to be held at the new stadium being planned by the BCCI at a land already allotted by Delhi Development Authority, and not at the Kotla which is owned by Delhi and District Cricket Association. 

Earlier this year, the four Asian Test playing nations won the bid to host the 2011 edition of crickets showpiece event. 

India and Pakistan hosted the quadrennial extravaganza jointly in 1987, marking the first time the World Cup being held outside England. 

The two countries were joined by Sri Lanka when the event returned to the subcontinent in 1996. 

Meanwhile, the BCCIs media committee chairman Rajeev Shukla has been included in the organising committee for Champions Trophy to be hosted by India in October-November this year. 

BCCI president Sharad Pawar has nominated Rajeev Shukla to the organising committee of the Champions Trophy 2006, BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah said in a press release Monday.

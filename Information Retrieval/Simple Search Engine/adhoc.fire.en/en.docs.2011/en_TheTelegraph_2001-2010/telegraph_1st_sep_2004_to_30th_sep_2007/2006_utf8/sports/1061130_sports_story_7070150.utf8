 Jeev Milkha in Asian team 

 - Royal Trophy

Bangkok: Indias Jeev Milkha Singh was on Wednesday picked in the Asian team for the Royal Trophy golf championship against Europe to be played at the Amata Spring Country Club here from January 12 to 14. 

Jeev, who is in red-hot form this season and has already bagged the UBS Asian Order of Merit honour, won the Casio World Open in Kochi, Japan, last week for his second win of the month. 

I am very pleased to join the Asian team for the Royal Trophy. I have had a tremendous year and I will go into the Royal Trophy with a lot of confidence, he said. 

Lee Westwood and Johan Edfors have been drafted in for Europe. Westwood hopes to bring his strong record of representing Europe to this tournament. 

Europe narrowly beat Asia 9-7 in the inaugural event last year. 

The Royal Trophy will consist of three formats foursomes (alternate shot) on the opening day, followed by four-ball on Day II and singles on the final day. (PTI)

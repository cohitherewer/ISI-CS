 All credit to defence and coach: Buffon 

Duisburg: Italy will seek their fourth World Cup title on Sunday with memories of two recent bitter defeats to opponents France adding extra motivation, if any were needed, for the Azzurri. 

Eight years ago, a highly-rated Italian side were knocked out of the World Cup at the quarter final stage on penalties by France who, as hosts, went on to win the final. 

Two years later, Dino Zoffs Italy came up against the French again, in the final of Euro 2000, losing out to a golden goal struck by David Trezeguet. We hope we can end that run and beat them this time, said Italy defender Marco Materazzi. 

Italys success, as always, has been built on a rock solid defence, marshalled superbly by Cannavaro, who will win his 100th cap on Sunday, and keeper Gianluigi Buffon has conceded just one goal ? a freakish own goal ? in the meet so far. 

In previous tournaments internal rivalries have led to rumours of dressing room disunity but at this World Cup, the Italians have shown an impressive unity and a great determination. 

Buffon was a reserve on the 1998 team and missed the 2000 tournament due to injury. In front of me there is an unbreachable wall and my self-belief comes from those team mates, said the Italy keeper, adding that the credit for Italys run to the final goes in large part to Lippi. 

Aside from his technical and tactical capabilities Lippi has an ability that I havent seen in other coaches ? he can really get 120 per cent out of you, said Buffon. 

Buffon will set a World Cup record if he keeps France scoreless for the first 65 minutes of the final. 

That would make it 518 minutes since Zaccardos goal, beating fellow Italian Walter Zengas mark of 517 minutes at the 1990 World Cup. 

Lippi is one win away from becoming the countrys most successful tactician. The last man to bring the World Cup home to Italy was Enzo Bearzot in 1982.

 Azhar deserves honour: Pawar 

Jaipur: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) president, Sharad Pawar, on Sunday defended the decision to felicitate Mohammed Azharuddin, saying the former captain deserved to be honoured. Why not? He had done so much for the country, Pawar said. There are other countries fielding tainted players like (Herschelle) Gibbs and (Shane) Warne. We are not playing him (Azharuddin). There is no question of that. He is not going to play anymore, added Pawar.

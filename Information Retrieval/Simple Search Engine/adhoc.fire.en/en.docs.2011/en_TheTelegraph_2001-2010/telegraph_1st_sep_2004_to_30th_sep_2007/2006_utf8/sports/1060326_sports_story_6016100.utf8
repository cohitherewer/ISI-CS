 Drogba double in Chelsea win 

London: Champions Chelsea opened a 14-point Premier League lead on Saturday when two Didier Drogba goals gave them a comfortable, though controversial, 2-0 home win over Manchester City. 

Chelsea dominated the game and Drogba scored after 30 and 33 minutes but City were fuming about the second goal, which was scored with the aid of a handball. 

City defender Sylvain Distin was sent off as the teams walked off at halftime for complaining about it, having been booked for doing the same when the goal was scored. 

Chelsea, beaten by Fulham last week, move to 78 points, 14 ahead of Liverpool, who overcame an 18th-minute red card for captain Steven Gerrard to beat Everton 3-1 at Anfield. 

Manchester United, third on 63 but with three games in hand of Liverpool, are at home to Birmingham City on Sunday. 

Blackburn Rovers moved to fifth with a 1-0 win at bottom club Sunderland, climbing above Arsenal, whose game at Portsmouth was postponed due to a waterlogged pitch. (Reuters)

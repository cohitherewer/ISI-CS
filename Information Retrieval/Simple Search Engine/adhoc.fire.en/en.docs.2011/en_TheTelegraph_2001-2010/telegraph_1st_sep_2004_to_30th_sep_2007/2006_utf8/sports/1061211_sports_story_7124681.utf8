 Arsenal held 1-1 by Chelsea

London: Arsenal dealt Chelseas title hopes a blow by holding the champions to a pulsating 1-1 draw on Sunday that boosted the chances of Premier League leaders Manchester United. 

Arsenals French midfielder Mathieu Flamini looked to have rifled in a 78th minute matchwinner, only for Chelseas Ghanaian midfielder Michael Essien to smash home a stunning 30-metre piledriver in the 86th minute at Stamford Bridge. 

The real winners on the day were United, who beat Manchester City 3-1 on Saturday and are now eight points ahead of second-placed Chelsea after playing a game more. 

United lead with 44 points from 17 games, Chelsea have 36 from 16, followed by Portsmouth and Liverpool on 28. Arsenal moved up to sixth on 26 points from 16 games. 

Arsenal, who had lost their last three away league games, packed their midfield in an effort to combat the physical presence of the champions. 

Chelsea left back Ashley Cole, facing his old club for the first time since an acrimonious August transfer, was booed by Arsenal fans and cheered loudly by the home crowd every time he touched the ball. 

Arsenal, though entertaining going forward, had let-offs when Frank Lampard struck a post and Essien had an effort cleared off the line by Cesc Fabregas. 

In Spain, Ernesto Chevantons 78th-minute header gave Sevilla a 2-1 victory over Real Madrid and moved them into sole possession of second place in the Spanish League. 

David Beckham gave Madrid the lead in the 14th with a 25-meter free kick before Frederic Kanoute tied it 4 minutes later with his league-tying 11th goal of the campaign. 

Earlier, FC Barcelona posted a 1-0 win over Real Sociedad to secure the top spot in the standings before departing for the World Club Championship in Japan. 

Ronaldinho scored his 11th league goal of the season in the 61st to put the Spanish and European champions atop of the League with 33 points. Sevilla is second with 31 and Madrid is third with 29. 

Sevilla hasnt lost at home in 10 months and improved to 7-0 at Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan Stadium this season.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 IN THE CITY

 The Fifa has clarified to the AIFF that the Indian federation cannot issue Gley Yao Rodrigue an ITC unless his national association (Togolese federation) gives it the go-ahead. 

 The striker?s hopes of donning Mohammedan Sporting colours in the ongoing NFL thus continue to be slim. Rodrigue, who played for Mohun Bagan in the early part of the season, had approached the AIFF to arrange his ITC. The AIFF had then sought Fifa?s view on the matter.

 East Bengal?s Mike Okoro left for Poland late on Sunday night to resolve a citizenship problem. Okoro, a Nigerian, has applied for Polish citizenship. He had wanted to leave earlier, but wasn?t granted permission by East Bengal. The recent appeal saw the club taking a favourable stand on humanitarian grounds. But the striker has to be on leave without pay.

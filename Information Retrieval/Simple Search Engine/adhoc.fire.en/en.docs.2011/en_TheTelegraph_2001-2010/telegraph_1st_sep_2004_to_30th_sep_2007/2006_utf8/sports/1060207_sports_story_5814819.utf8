 Chawla, Dhiman star in colts win

 - UNDER-19 WORLD CUP 

 Piyush Chawla took three wickets 

Colombo: Leg spinner Piyush Chawla celebrated his Ranji Trophy triumph with a three-wicket haul as India made light work of chasing down a modest Namibian score to start their ICC U-19 World Cup campaign with a nine-wicket victory on Monday. 

Ravikant Shuklas side bowled the Africans out for 170 and then knocked off the required runs for the loss of just opener Gaurav Dhiman, but only after he had hammered 90 from just 70 balls. 

It was left to Cheteshwar Pujara (66 not out) and Rohit Sharma (10 not out) to seal the win, which arrived with a massive 22.5 overs in hand. 

Chawla dismissed opener Keady Strauss, caught and bowled for seven and then had Pieter Grove (3) caught at slip by captain Shukla. 

He finished as Indias most successful bowler with three for 38. Dawid Botha made 61, an innings that was spread over 130 minutes and included six fours from 111 balls. 

Botha and Henno Prinsloo helped Namibia recover from a shaky start when they were reduced to 44 for three. 

Prinsloos eventual dismissal, run out for 28 just as Namibia were looking to lift the tempo, was the start of a mini-collapse that saw three wickets fall for the addition of only four runs in three overs.

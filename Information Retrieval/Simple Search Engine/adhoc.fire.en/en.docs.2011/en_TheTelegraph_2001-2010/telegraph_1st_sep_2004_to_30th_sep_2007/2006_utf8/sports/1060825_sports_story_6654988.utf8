 Woolmer has lost his marbles: Vengsarkar 

 - Scrapping of law 42.3 

 Vengsarkar 

Mumbai: Former India captain Dilip Vengsarkar on Thursday expressed incredulity and shock at the reported statement, made by Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer, suggesting to the ICC the scrapping of Law 42.3 of the game. 

How can he make such a statement? I am shocked and totally surprised at this suggestion from a man who has even been part of the ICCs coaching scheme. Its like giving freedom to the thief to steal. What are laws there for? questioned Vengsarkar. 

Woolmer had made this highly debatable suggestion to a newspaper in England in the aftermath of Pakistans forfeiting The Oval Test after being found guilty of ball tampering. 

The whole irony and tragedy of this particular story is Law 42.3, Woolmer told the newspaper on Wednesday. 

But Law 42.3 is an ass. It was brought in because of ball-tampering with razor blades and bottle tops and everything else in the past, but thats been shoved out of the game now. Id scrub out the law completely, the former England opening batsman-turned-coach remarked. 

Reacting to these suggestions, a peeved Vengsarkar said: If carried out, this will put the sport in trouble as players will start feeling that nobody is going to do anything to you (even if you cheat). Its an amazing statement to make and I think hes (Woolmer) lost his marbles. 

 Why are there any laws at 

 all then? There are umpires out there and Match Referees 

 too to prevent such happenings.

 Narain still in negotiations with Williams

New Delhi: Narain Karthikeyan is still involved in negotiations for a test drivers spot with Williams F1. 

Reports in the European media said that Karthikeyan might have lost out to Austrian Alex Wurz for the Williams test drivers spot. 

But sources close to Indias first formula one driver said on Monday he could still become a Williams test driver irrespective of the top F1 team signing up Wurz. 

Williams need two test drivers. Even if Wurz is signed, Karthikeyan still has a chance, said the sources. 

Williams themselves were yet to make an announcement on Wurz who has been with McLaren-Mercedes for the last five years. Speculation of the 31-year-old Wurz moving to Williams began with McLaren signing up Gary Paffett as their third test driver. 

A test drivers role was crucial as he drives, besides the off season testing, every Friday of the racing weekends. 

For Karthikeyan, this would help him understand the advanced machinery of a formula one car and also give him the experience of the 19 racing circuits. Sources also said that Karthikeyan in fact had a second option as well which they said, if it worked out could be better than the Williams test drivers role. 

Disclosing information at this stage would jeopardise Karthikeyans chances. All that can be said at this point of time is that it is about Formula One. 

In terms of career move, it would be a better option for Karthikeyan. If it works out for him, even if Williams offers him the test drivers spot and pays him, will not take it. It is that good an option. 

The deal should be finalised by January 15, the sources said. 

Narain, recovering from a food poisoning that kept him home in Coimbatore on new years day, could not be contacted. 

Meanwhile, Michael Schumacher turns 37 on Tuesday, hungry already for a year that could be his farewell to Ferrari and last shot at an eighth Formula One championship, adds a report from London. 

Lets hope for a better season, said the German on his website after the dominance of 2004 translated into a depressing 2005. 

Most of all, I see the same fighting spirit (at Ferrari) that I feel, said Schumacher. Were all on the same page; we want to play a major role in the fight for the title. So were going to go for it again. 

 Schumacher knows he cannot defy time for much longer. Ferrari have said Schumacher is welcome to stay on after his contract expires at the end of the year and he has said he wants to continue for as long as he is enjoying himself. 

But the situation has been complicated by world champion Fernando Alonsos surprise move from champions Renault to McLaren for 2007. 

With Schumacher now entering the twilight of his career, however competitive he might be, there is a clear successor to the German available for next year in Kimi Raikkonen. 

With Brazilian Felipe Massa signed only for 2006 at Ferrari, Schumacher and Raikkonen could be paired up next year but the wage bill would be colossal. 

Raikkonen would also not move unless he could be guaranteed at least equal terms on the track with his teammate, thereby ending Schumachers current pre-eminence.

 RCTC faces inter-venue crisis 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Royal Calcutta Turf Club (RCTC) could loose its licence to conduct inter-venue betting from next month if the club fails to clear its dues to the other racing centres, informed a reliable source. The total dues are learnt to be about Rs 1.5 crore with Royal Western India Turf Club (RWITC) heading the list of RCTCs creditors. The dues pertain to the royalty and live broadcast charges, which are paid to the host racing centres. 

 If the licence is cancelled, the city punters may have to do without the Pune inter-venue betting, beginning from August 5. However, B.A.Engineer, RWITC secretary, clarified over phone that a final decision on this (broadcast) issue has not been taken. Well take the decision about it in due course, said Engineer.

 Boman Parakh, secretary, RCTC, was confident that inter-venue will continue. We are looking into the matter and it will be resolved shortly; he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Quota places may go up at Olympics

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: From a total of only five medals in the 1990 Commonwealth Games in Auckland (including one gold), Indian shooting has reached a height in Melbourne which no other sport in India can compete with. With 16 gold, seven silver and four bronze, India are now considered a shooting prowess, notwithstanding their inability to live up to their reputation in the Olympics and the Asian Games. 

Detractors might say that India are yet to clinch a quota place for the next Olympics, but given the depth and pool of talent, it is only a matter of time before the Indians achieve the target . In Athens, India bagged eight quota places on the basis of their shooters performance in different world championships and international meets, and this time it could be more than that. 

One thing has been proved beyond doubt in Melbourne. Indian shooting is no more dependent on a few individuals like Anjali Bhagwat, Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore or Jaspal Rana, like it was in Manchester. None of the three were at their best in Melbourne, yet India could bag 16 gold medals and stand tall in the medals tally. 

Now there are enough number of shooters, who can be labelled as medal hopes in the international meets. A few days before leaving for Melbourne, Samresh Jung told The Telegraph that he was still a nobody in his locality in north Delhi. 

Ya, I am an Arjuna award winner, but I dont think many know people know me or my wife (Anuja Jung) in my neighbourhood, said Jung jokingly. 

Today, Jung with five gold medals, is certainly a celebrity. So are Gagan Narang and Avneet Kaur. In 1994, Jaspal Rana won Indias last individual gold in the Asian Games in centre fire pistol. 

With four gold medals in air rifle and 3 position rifle, Narang could surely be one of Indias best bets in the forthcoming Doha meet. 

In the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, only Mansher Singh could earn his quota with Jaspal Rana getting in as a wild card entry. It was increased to three in Sydney ? Anwar Sultan, Anjali Bhagwat and Abhinav Bindra (wild card). It jumped to eight places four years later in Athens. 

Our biggest asset is that most of our shooters have the age on their sides, said Jung. In the international arena, many people wonder how most of the Indian shooters are so young when plus 30 people generally dominate the game all over the world. But that may prove to be our biggest advantage.

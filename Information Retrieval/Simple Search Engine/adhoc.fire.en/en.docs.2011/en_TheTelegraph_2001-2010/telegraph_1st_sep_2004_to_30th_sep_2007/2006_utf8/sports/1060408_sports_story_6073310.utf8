 Star Phoenix scrapes home 

 STAR RACER

 Chisty on Star Phoenix

 Calcutta: The even-money 

 favourite Star Phoenix was hard-pressed to beat a friendless 

 Capture The Moment in the 1,600m Mr Mauritius Cup at the 

 races here on Friday. The long-shot was pushed into the 

 lead soon after a slow start and nearly brought about the 

 fall of the Imran Chisty-ridden horse, trained by Daniel 

 David.

 The Kabuki Cup was, however, an easy pick for a quietly fancied El Cid, a Vikash Jaiswal-ward who was ridden by Rajinder. Earlier, the trainer-jockey combo had won the 1,200m Pompano Handicap through a heavily-wagered No Politics Please.

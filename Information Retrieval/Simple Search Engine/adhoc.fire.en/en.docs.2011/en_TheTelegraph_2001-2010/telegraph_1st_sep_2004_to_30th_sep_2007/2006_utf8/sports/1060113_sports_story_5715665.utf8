 Dismal show by home batsmen

Calcutta: There was not much optimism in the Bengal ranks after the penultimate days play but Deep Dasgupta promised a positive approach if confronted with a realistic target. The situation could have been avoided had the home batsmen decided to show some discipline and application in the morning. 

Only an outright will confirm Bengals semi-final entry after Tamil Nadu seemed unlikely to get full points against Delhi and Gujarat were on the brink of a victory versus Karnataka. 

Bengal have already ensured two points by virtue of their 19-run lead. At close, Railways were ahead by 121 runs. 

Well definitely set a target? It will all depend on how many runs we get in the morning. We have already lost two points and doesnt really matter if we lose, Sanjay Bangar said.Weve no other way but to chase? But for that we need to grab some wickets in the morning session. Hopefully we can make it, an optimistic Deep remarked. 

Bengals hopes were dashed in the first session when they lost five wickets. It included Harvinder Singh claiming three in one over ? Laxmi Ratan Shukla, Shib Sagar Singh and Sourashish Lahiri. 

It broke the backbone of the batting and others, except for Deep, never showed the technique to tackle the moving ball. Both Harvinder and Jai Prakash Yadav showed good control in helpful conditions, finishing with four wickets each. 

Rohan Gavaskar, struggling with a stiff neck after the blow on the second evening, decided to come lower down the order. Arindam Das left early but Manoj Tewaris promise was cut short by Harvinder. Rohan resumed with a runner, but a horrible mix-up saw his end off the very first ball. 

At one stage Deep had only Shib Shankar Paul for company with Bengal still six short of 259. It was finally achieved when a wide slash by Paul off Yadav saw the ball fly past third slip for a boundary. The last wicket pair put on 25 runs. 

The Bengal bowlers failed to make any impact in the second innings. Deep could have tried out Shukla for some variety. To compound their problems, Arindam dropped Bangar at second slip. 

Amit Pagnis batted with composure for 164 minutes to remain unbeaten on 76. 

Railways will be looking for a sizeable lead while the hosts will be hoping the mediumpacers utilise the conditions to facilitate a collapse. It could turn out to be an entertaining battle. 

Rohan scan 

Rohan, who was struck below the right ear on Wednesday, underwent a precautionary scan Thursday evening. The stiffness, a doctor said, was because of soft tissue damage and haematoma in the area. Dad Sunil called CAB officials to check on Rohans conditions.

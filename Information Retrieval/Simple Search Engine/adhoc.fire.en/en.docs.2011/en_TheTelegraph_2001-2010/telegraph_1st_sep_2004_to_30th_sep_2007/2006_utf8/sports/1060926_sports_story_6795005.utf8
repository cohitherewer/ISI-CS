 Ancic ousts Kunitsyn; Rastogi falls to Phau

 - ATP MUMBAI OPEN 

 - Bopanna-Ghouse knocks out top seeds 

AMITAVA DAS GUPTA

 Bjorn Phau of Germany in action against Karan Rastogi at the ATP Mumbai Open on Monday. Phau won 6-0, 6-3. (PTI) 

Mumbai: It was known beforehand that Mario Ancic is a jolly good tennis player. Now we know he is a smart bloke, too. The Croat wasted little time flying in to India after a fabulous week in Beijing, the idea being to get accustomed to the heat and humidity before Mission Mumbai. 

Well, the five days he spent in Delhi and here came in handy as he sweated his way to a comprehensive 6-3, 6-2 win over Igor Kunitsyn in the Kingfisher Airlines Open at the CCI here on Monday evening. 

Earlier, the first of Indians guest appearance got over in less than an hour with sixth seed Bjorn Phau dismissing Karan Rastogi 6-0, 6-3. One wild card out, two more (Rohan Bopanna and Akash Wagh) to go. Sounds familiar, doesnt it? 

It was doubles which brought the Indians some joy later in the evening when Rohan Bopanna and Mustafa Ghouse knocked out top seeds Phau and Alexander Peya 6-3, 6-4. 

Back to Ancic, the last man to have humbled Roger Federer at Wimbledon. He had a far less accomplished opponent across the court Monday, but that didnt deter the world No. 11 from holding back anything in the opening set. 

The tall and strapping Croat served with delightful variation to keep Kunitsyn guessing. His returns were hit hard, deep and flat to effectively pin the Russian to the baseline. An injury had kept him out after Wimbledon till the China Open, but there was no hint of that either in his movement or smooth groundstrokes. 

I was looking forward to this match as I had prepared well for these tough conditions, so Im happy to have come through, the baby-faced Ancic said later. Every match is of huge importance to me as I want to get back to the level I was before the injury. 

A pity not even a thousand were present to watch a man who has the potential to join the ranks of Nadal and others who dream of dethroning Roger Federer. 

Phau, who looks more Asian than German, thanks to his Indonesian mother, ran away with the opening set against Rastogi 6-0. Rastogi had chances to hold serve but couldnt put away routine volleys on game point. 

The second set started with Rastogi having a good service game and that helped him get on to the scoreboard. His forehand returns had more sting now and he had the confidence to do battle from the baseline. 

The problem was, the Indian who like numerous predecessors has struggled to translate genuine potential to effective results couldnt create a single window of opportunity on Phaus serve. 

For someone who has been regularly visiting Nick Bollettieris academy, the expectation had been that bit more on Rastogi. The soon-to-be-20-year-old, though, wasnt too disheartened by the pounding he got. 

I didnt play my best today, actually he didnt let me play, said Rastogi. The first set rattled me bit, but overall I was having fun out there. The few hundred present at the temporary stands of the CCI centre court would have begged to differ. 

Rastogi went on to add that his game has been improving. I can only get better from here, he said. Well, do it fast, India is waiting. 

It was going to be a matter of time before the sixth-seeded German would tighten the noose around his feeble opponent, and he did.

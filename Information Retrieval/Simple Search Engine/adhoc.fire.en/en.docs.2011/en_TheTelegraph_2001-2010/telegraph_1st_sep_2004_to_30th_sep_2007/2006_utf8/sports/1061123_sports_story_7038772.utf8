New Delhi: The Ambedkar Stadium in Delhi has remained witness to many a glorious moments for East Bengal. It includes 16 title triumphs in the Durand Cup and seven in the DCM Trophy. 

On Wednesday, a sparse crowd at the same stadium watched with horror a shameful chapter being written in East Bengal history when the Calcutta team went down 0-4 to JCT Mills, Phagwara in the group II quarter final league match of the Durand Cup. 

It was certainly one of the worst defeats for East Bengal in recent memory. While the veterans in the stands recalled how East Bengal lost 1-5 to Mohammedan Sporting in the DCM semi-final in 1959 and 0-4 to Metallist Khardov from the USSR in 1986 DCM final, they all agreed on one point. Red and yellow brigade had never been so spineless before. 

The man who should shoulder the responsibility for such a big defeat is the Brazilian coach Carlos Pereira. 

In a match where East Bengal were pushed to a must-win position especially after Dempo defeated Army XI 2-1 in the same group, Pereira preferred to play players like Bibiano Fernandes and Freddy Mascarenhas keeping out Chandan Das and Hardeep Saini. 

It reduced East Bengal without a ball-winner in the midfield. It cost them heavily. Alvito DCunha was a total misfit, so were the two Brazilians. Daniel, of course, was more sensible of the two, but was left to play as a defender for most part of the second session. 

To cap it all, Rajat Ghosh Dastidar had a bad day under the bar and defender Sureshs fatal back pass entered the net giving JCT their fourth goal. Pitted against an organised JCT East Bengal were a side that never made a proper opening in the 90-minute period. 

It all started with a harmless Praveen Kumar header that beat an out of position Ghosh Dastidar in the 21st minute for the first goal. Thereafter, East Bengal held on, but could hardly stretch the JCT defence. 

At the stroke of an hour, Pereira fielded Japanese born Izumi Arata, perhaps more out of despair than any proper plan. Before Arata could touch the ball, JCT struck again when Nigerian Sunday Ambrose headed in following a flak-kick. 

Two more goals came in the last 10 minutes. By that time East Bengal had turned a pathetic lot. Nigerian Adebayo volleyed in from the top of the box in the 81st minute. 

Two minutes later, Suresh tried to back pass to the custodian with Rajat going in a different direction. The ball rolled in. 

With both JCT and Dempo are having four points, East Bengal (1 point) have very little chance of making the last four now. In the last match, they play Army XI.

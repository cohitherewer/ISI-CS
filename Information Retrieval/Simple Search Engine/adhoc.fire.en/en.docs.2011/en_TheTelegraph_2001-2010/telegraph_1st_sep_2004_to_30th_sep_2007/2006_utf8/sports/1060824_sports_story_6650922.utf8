 Gough back in England ODI squad

London: England have included two newcomers in a 16-man one-day International squad, including 20-year-old fast bowler Stuart Broad, the son of former Test batsman Chris. 

The squad announced on Wednesday for the ODI series against visiting Pakistan also includes another debutant, 25-year-old allrounder Michael Yardy, and 35-year-old paceman Darren Gough who returns after more than a year. 

Stuart, along with Darren Gough and Jon Lewis, give the captain and coach options when opening the bowling, something that proved to be a problem in the series against Sri Lanka, chairman of selectors David Graveney said. 

Chris Broad was an opening batsman who represented England in 25 Tests and 34 one-day Internationals between 1984 and 1989. He is also an ICC Match Referee. 

England were whitewashed 0-5 by Sri Lanka in ODIs earlier in the year, ringing alarm bells with the World Cup due to start in March next year in the Caribbean. 

Gough, who has 157 one-day Internationals behind him, is a risk as he has been struggling with a shin injury. On reflection on the NatWest Series defeat to Sri Lanka, selectors felt we needed some experience in the line-up for Andrew Strauss and Duncan Fletcher, Graveney said. 

Gough said: Im delighted to get another opportunity with England. Ive worked hard all year and this call-up is my reward.

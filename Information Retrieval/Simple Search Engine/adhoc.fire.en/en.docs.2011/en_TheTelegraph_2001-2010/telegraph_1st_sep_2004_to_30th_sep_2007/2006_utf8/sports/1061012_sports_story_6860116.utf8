New Delhi: South Africas cricketer Herschelle Gibbs will make himself available to the Delhi Police Thursday for interrogation over his role in the match-fixing scandal which shook the cricketing world in 2000. 

The stylish opener, who had avoided visiting India on two earlier occasions fearing arrest, reached Mumbai this morning. 

Gibbs is accompanied by two lawyers who will assist the player during the questioning which is scheduled to be held Thursday. 

A high-level team of crime branch officials, led by joint commissioner of police Ranjit Narayan, will grill the batsman on all aspects of the scandal, which came to light after Delhi police tapped a phone conversation of the late South African skipper Hansie Cronje during his teams tour of India in 2000. 

Gibbs is likely to be asked who all had come in contact with him and what kind of match related information had been sought from him, Delhi police sources said. 

Gibbs has already served a six-month ban slapped by South African cricket authorities while his teammate Nicky Boje, also named in the scandal, is still evading questioning. Both of them had answered a detailed questionnaire put to them by the Delhi police in 2004. 

The South African had sought permission from his cricket board that he be allowed to join his teammates later in India since his lawyers were not available at an earlier date. 

The team, which arrived on Sunday, is currently in Mumbai and will play their first match of the Champions Trophy against New Zealand on October 16. (PTI)

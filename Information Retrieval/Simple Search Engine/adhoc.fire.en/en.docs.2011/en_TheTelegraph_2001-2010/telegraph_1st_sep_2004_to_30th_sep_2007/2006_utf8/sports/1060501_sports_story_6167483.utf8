 India A blow away UAE

 - RP, VRV grab 5 each 

Abu Dhabi: Seamers Rudra Pratap Singh and Vikram Rajvir Singh produced a sensational new ball spell to blast United Arab Emirates for a paltry 70 and give India A a 126-run victory in the Eurasia Series limited overs tournament here on Sunday night. 

After a stuttering batting performance to post a modest 196, the Indians hit back to shut out the hosts in only 15.1 overs in the group C second league phase clash at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium. 

R. P. Singh returned figures of five for 30, while VRV Singh bagged five for 38 with only three UAE batsmen reaching double figures. 

In fact, 18 extras including five no balls and 11 wides were the highest entry in the UAE batting card. 

Wicketkeeper-batsman Dinesh Karthik was adjudged the Man of the Match. His score of 75 took the team to a respectable total. 

Karthik had support from Rohit Sharma who made a composed 56. 

The duo added 123 runs for the fourth wicket to lift the team from a sorry 20 for three. 

Rohit batted really well. He rotated the strike and came up with some boundaries that eased the pressure a bit, Karthik said.

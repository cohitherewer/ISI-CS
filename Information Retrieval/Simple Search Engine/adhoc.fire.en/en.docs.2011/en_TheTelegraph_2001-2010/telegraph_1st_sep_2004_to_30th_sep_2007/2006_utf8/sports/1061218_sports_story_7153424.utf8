 Parthiv ploughs lone furrow

 - RANJI TROPHY 

 Ranadebs late burst helps Bengal claw back on Day I 

A STAFF REPORTER

 Parthiv Patel 

Calcutta: I will have a sleepless night today, said Bengals last match hero Ranadeb Bose after the opening days play against Gujarat at Eden Garden Sunday. 

For had it not been for the P-factor, the hosts would have had a peaceful night after the days play in their Super League Group B round three encounter. 

Test discard Parthiv Patel three-run shy of his maiden Ranji century stood between Bengals comfort zone and discomfort level at close which was stopped (after 77 overs) due to bad light. For the record, the former India wicketkeepers highest Ranji score was 87 (vs Mumbai in 2004-05). 

Having brought the sudden downfall from a threatening 272 for five (at a time when Bhavik Thakker and Parthiv were looking dangerous during their 52-run stand) to a stuttering 276 for seven, Ranadeb was a little anxious. 

We should have wrapped up the innings, Ranadeb, who had taken five wickets in their last match against Mumbai to help his team gain two points, remarked. 

Bowling from the high court end in the first two sessions, the seamer was impressive but unlucky. As it turned out, he went wicket-less in his earlier spells. However, his third and last spell (from the pavilion end) not only saw him end the fifth-wicket partnership between Bhavik and Parhiv but end with two wickets. 

In fact, the sudden fall of wickets, at a time when Parthiv was in the nervous nineties, fetched Bengal one more, though this time in the form of a run out. A cheeky single by Parthiv cost Gujarat the non-stirkers wicket (Jayesh Makla for a duck) with a direct throw from Manoj Tewari. 

Parthiv, though, said that it was Maklas call. Bengal, on the other hand, were all smiles but for the bad light 

Incidentally, the match exposed the home teams fielding, which was enough to keep skipper Deep Dasgupta worried. Not only the fielding appeared slack, there were a couple of overthrows to the boundary. Bengal, by the way, gave away 39 in extras from which 19 were from leg byes. 

Deep lamented: We could have fielded better. He was also worried about the runs scored in boundaries. Im sure the percentage of runs in boundaries would be more than the single or twos. To add to it was a couple of overthrows, he added. 

Despite finishing on a high, Deep still did not seem content. Everything went right for us, we won the toss, got an initial breakthrough but stillWe got to be careful while batting, they have got four seamers said Deep. 

But at the moment, their target No.1 is to bowl out the tourists inside 300 on Monday. With Parthiv gunning for a comeback a la Dinesh Karthik its fingers crossed.

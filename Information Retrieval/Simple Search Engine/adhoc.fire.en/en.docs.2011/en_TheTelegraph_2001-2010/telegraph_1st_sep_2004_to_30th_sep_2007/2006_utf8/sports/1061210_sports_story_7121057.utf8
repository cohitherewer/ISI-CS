 Doping hits the Games 

Doha: Weightlifter Than Kyi Kyi of Myanmar tested positive to a banned diuretic and was the first athlete disqualified for doping at the 15th Asian Games. 

Olympic Council of Asia (OCA) director general Husain Al Musallam announced the positive case Saturday against the former world championship gold medallist. 

Than, 28, placed fourth in the womens 48kg at Doha last weekend, the first day of weightlifting competition, and was tested the same day. 

Than waived her right to have a B sample tested after her initial sample showed elevated traces of the diuretic furosemide, Al Musallam said. 

Diuretics are on the list of banned substances because they can be used to mask illegal steroids. 

After due consideration and after listening to her submission, the OCA disciplinary commission recommended that this athlete has committed an anti-doping violation and should be disqualified from the competition, Musallam said.Than won a gold medal in the snatch in the 46-kilogram class at the 1997 world championships in Chang Mai, Thailand and was a silver medallist at the Southeast Asian Games last year in Manila. 

Ranked sixth in the world rankings at the end of 2005, she was one of 40 athletes from Myanmar at the Games. Her case has been forwarded to the IWF and the IOC for further consideration, Musallam said. 

Musallam said 630 doping tests have so far been conducted at the Games, about half of the total number of tests expected to be taken. 

That includes about 86 pre-Games tests, for the first time in an Asian Games, and competition testing of 544, including blood and EPO, he said. (AP)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Chapter closed in 2004 gets reopened

 - Sharad Pawar ruling on Jharkhand orphans Mahendra Singh Dhoni 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Calcutta: The Sharad Pawar regime had no reservations in awarding the sixth ODI against England to the Jharkhand State Cricket Association (JSCA). 

Less than two months later, though, JSCA president Amitabh Choudhary is persona non grata: The senior Indian Police Service officer wasnt allowed to attend Thursdays Special General Meeting (SGM) of the Board in Mumbai. 

There was, in fact, no seat for Jharkhand. 

If thats strange, to say the least, whats the status of Mahendra Singh Dhoni? Its fair to say that Jharkhands unofficial brand ambassador has been orphaned. 

For now, the Board has appointed a three-member committee (Union minister Pawar is as fond of panels as most predecessors) to look into the Jharkhand versus (undivided) Bihar issue. 

The committee comprises vice-president Shashank Manohar, treasurer N. Srinivasan and former Union law minister Arun Jaitley, the Delhi supremo. It will give its report within a month. 

Whatever the technicalities raised now, Jharkhand (not the new Bihar) was granted affiliation at the SGM held in Chennai some 21 months ago. 

That was done unanimously and the state has been fielding teams in Board-run tournaments, most notably the Ranji Trophy. 

Then, last November, Supreme Court-appointed observer (for the Boards AGM) T.S. Krishnamurthy upheld Jharkhands affiliation. 

Choudhary, Team India manager on the controversial tour of Zimbabwe in early 2005-06 and who recently thrashed challenger Sudesh Mahto (actually his boss, the states home minister) in the JSCA elections, told The Telegraph all options would be explored. 

Jharkhand, obviously, is having to pay for Choudhary being seen as a Jagmohan Dalmiya supporter. The latter is the present dispensations No. 1 target. 

Former India player and selector Ramesh Saxena, by the way, also turned up in Mumbai. Hes in the anti-Choudhary camp. 

Bihars case was pleaded by a representative of Union minister Lalu Prasad, successful World Cupper and former MP Kirti Azad and another gentleman. 

 Neither was given a seat but Pawars ruling, 

 which hurt the JSCA and Choudhary, must have come as a moral 

 victory.

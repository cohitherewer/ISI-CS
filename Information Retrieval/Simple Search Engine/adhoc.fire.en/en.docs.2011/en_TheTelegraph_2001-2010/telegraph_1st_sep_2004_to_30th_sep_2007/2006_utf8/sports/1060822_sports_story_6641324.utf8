 Lady luck smiled on Ahmed 

 STAR RACER

 Javed

 Jockey Rafiq Ahmed spoiled trainer Vijay Singhs party last Wednesday. Vijay had already saddled Star Special and Aleksei to victory early in the afternoon and was expected to lead in his smart youngster, Bright Blossom, in the 1,400m Independence Cup. But it never happened.

 The Blossom was always in a striking position and, in the hands of Mallesh Narredu, the three-year-old looked like delivering the goods. However, in the last furlong the equation changed when an erratic running Imperial Stride came in the way of the favourite, forcing Mallesh to seek for an untroubled galloping course. The loss of a stride or two at that juncture turned the fortunes in favour of Ahmeds ride, Active Asset, who was always in close attendance of the Blossom. Incidentally, Active Asset paid Rs 572 on tote against an investment of Rs 10.

 Only half-an-hour earlier Mallesh had helped Vijays cause atop a suspect bleeder, Aleksei, in the 1,200m Wiseman Cup. In his previous start, when ridden by C. Alford, Aleksei wasnt given a punishing run, yet the horse had managed to beat Capture The Moment. Mallesh did not belt the horse on this occasion either but still the opposition was demolished. 

 Aleksei was ridden off the pace, giving long rope to the likes of Sea Legends, Star Magics, Retained Assets and Exploding Wonders. Once in motion nearing the final turn, Aleksei flew past all of them.

 Jockey S. Shanker, however, needed to use his head on Star Special, Vijays first winner on the day. In the 1,400m Shahi Bagh Plate, the filly was sent into the lead from the start. The top-weighted was in apparent danger of losing the race to Queen Amedale when shifting out in the last furlong. Shanker was, however, quick to take remedial measure for a shade under two-length victory.

 In the 1,100m Vanitas Handicap, Imran Chisty had to sweat it out right from the word go to coax Best Of The Blues into the galloping mood. Mallesh, on the other hand, was threatening to win upfront, on Champion Crusader, from the start. Chisty, nevertheless, managed to evoke some response from Daniels 14-10 favourite in the final 50m to the relief of his backers.

 Chistys harakiri on another Daniels runner, Accendere, ensured solidly fancied stablemate, Presidium, the win in the 1,800m Sans Ame Handicap. Chisty pushed Accendere into a long lead, which surely tired the 3-1 second favourite. 

 Charulata demonstrated her guts and prowess in the 1,000m Flying Glance Handicap while carrying a huge burden of 62-kg to a fluent victory. It was her mentor Javed Khans first of the two winners on the day. Alarico was the next, in the 1,200m Swatantrata Cup. The Steinbeck-As Ever son also braved heavy rain and soft underfoot condition before registering a facile back-to-back victory.

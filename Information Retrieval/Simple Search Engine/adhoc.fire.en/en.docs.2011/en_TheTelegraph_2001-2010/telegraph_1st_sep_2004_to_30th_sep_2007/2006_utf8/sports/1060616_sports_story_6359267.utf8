 Nuremberg: Savo Milosevic may have to wait longer for his 100th cap if Serbia amp; Montenegro opt for a taller striker in their must-win World Cup match against Argentina in Gelsenkirchen on Friday. 

Argentina lead group C after their 2-1 win over Ivory Coast last weekend. The Serbs lost their opener 0-1 to The Netherlands and less than three points against the South Americans will probably spell the end of their campaign. 

The Serbian midfield should remain unchanged with Dejan Stankovic and Predrag Djordjevic operating from the centre. But 2.02-metre striker Nikola Zigic may be preferred up front to 32-year-old captain Milosevic. 

Argentina could be vulnerable in the air with their relatively small centre-backs Roberto Ayala and Gabriel Heinze. 

The two-time former champions are looking to clinch their second-round ticket on Friday. We cant speculate... we must take the game to them all the time and get the result that will help us qualify, Ayala said. 

Jose Pekermans team has practised this week with a change in midfield designed to give them more speed up front, with Luis Gonzalez replacing ball-winner Esteban Cambiasso. 

Argentina sat back after going 2-0 up against Ivory Coast in Hamburg on Saturday and relinquished the initiative for long periods of the second half. 

Pekerman will almost certainly keep faith on his twin strikeforce of Hernan Crespo and Javier Saviola, who both scored against the Ivorians. 

Lionel Messi, who didnt play against Ivory Coast, will be available in case Pekerman needs him, despite a small left-foot injury he suffered during practice on Wednesday. 

He will be with us tomorrow (Friday), Pekerman said, without revealing his plans for the 18-year-old Barcelona striker. 

Serbia are handicapped by the loss of central defender Nemanja Vidic, who has been ruled out for the rest of the tournament with damaged knee ligaments. 

Goran Gavrancic will move into the centre of defence to fill in, with Igor Duljaj likely to start at right back and Ognjen Koroman on the right wing. 

Argentina are obviously a world-class side but not invulnerable... with our passionate fans behind us anything is possible and we have to reward them with a fully committed performance, said Serbias defensive midfielder Albert Nadj.

Argentina: 1-Roberto Abbondanzieri; 21-Nicolas Burdisso, 2-Roberto Ayala, 6-Gabriel Heinze, 3-Juan Pablo Sorin; 22-Luis Gonzalez, 8-Javier Mascherano, 18-Maxi Rodriguez; 10-Juan Roman Riquelme; 7-Javier Saviola, 9-Hernan Crespo

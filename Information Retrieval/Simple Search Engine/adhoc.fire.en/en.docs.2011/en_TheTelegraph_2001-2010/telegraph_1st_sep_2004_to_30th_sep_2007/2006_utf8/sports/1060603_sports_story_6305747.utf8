A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Deep Sengupta and Saptarshi Roy emerged as joint leaders in the Premier section of the Karvy the Finapolis Chess for Youth tournament at the Netaji Indoor Stadium on Friday. Both were on 6 points at the end of the penultimate round, followed by Bengal sub-junior champion Debaditya Sinha Biswas and Joydeep Dutta on 5.5 points. 

Debaditya upset fourth seed Saptarshi in the seventh round, while national junior girls champion Soumya Swaminathan emerged victorious over third seed Arghyadip Das. Soumya, however, failed to stick to winning ways and went down to Joydeep Dutta in the next round.

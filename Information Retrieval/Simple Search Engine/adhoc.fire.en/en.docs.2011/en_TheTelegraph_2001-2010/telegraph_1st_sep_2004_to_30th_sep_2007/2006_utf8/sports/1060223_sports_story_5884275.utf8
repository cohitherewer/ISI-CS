The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 India set to get another big Fifa grant 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: Come the next financial year, the All India Football Federation (AIFF) would be richer by another $400,000 (around Rs 18000000). According to AIFF general secretary Alberto Colaco, India will receive the money from Fifa under Goal Project II. 

After the successful completion of our Goal Project I (Football Bhawan in New Delhi), India has become eligible for the second project, Colaco said. Since the Fifa officials have already assured us about the money, it might help us in solving our infrastructural problems to some extent. 

The federation, according to Colaco, is planning to spend the money in developing a couple of centres, which could be permanently earmarked as AIFF venues. During every National Football League, we struggle to get grounds at various centres since none of them actually belong to us. 

With $4000,000 in the bank, AIFF plans to acquire the rights of a few stadia in different parts of the country and develop and keep them for its exclusive use. While in Calcutta it could be Rabindra Sarobar; Duler Ground in Goa, Corporation Stadium in Calicut or Football Stadium in Bangalore could be the other possible venues, Colaco said. 

AIFF also wants to keep these grounds as the reserve venues for the NFL in future. 

But then, the federation also wants the state associations to work in tandem with the parent body and also contribute financially towards the project. It hopes that the respective state associations will use their influence to acquire the centres at least on lease and take care a part of the expenditure. 

Make no mistake, Colaco said. Since the Fifa money is not enough to take care of all expenses, we are writing to state associations asking them to raise money at their end also.

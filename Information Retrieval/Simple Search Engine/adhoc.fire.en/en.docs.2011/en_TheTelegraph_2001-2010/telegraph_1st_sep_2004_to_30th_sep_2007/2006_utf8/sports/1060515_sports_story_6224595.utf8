 Erring Pak A players reprimanded 

Islamabad: Pakistan Cricket Board has let off the four members of its A team, who were detained in Dubai for overspeeding recently, with a reprimand. 

After receiving the managers report, PCB ruled that the players ? Hassan Raza, Taufeeq Umar, Misbah-ul Haq and Zulqarnain Haider ? could not be blamed for overspeeding as they were passengers travelling in a car being driven by someone else. 

But it decided to uphold the penalty of $300 imposed on the cricketers for their breach of conduct in going to Dubai from Abu Dhabi without the managers permission. 

The players were detained because they were not carrying their visas and were released immediately after the manager presented copies of their visa documents, PCB said is a statement. (PTI)

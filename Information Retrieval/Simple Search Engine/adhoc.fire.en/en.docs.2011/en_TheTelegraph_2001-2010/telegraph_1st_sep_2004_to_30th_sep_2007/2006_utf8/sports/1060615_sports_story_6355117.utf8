 Sourav effort in vain, Kalighat champions

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: A day before leaving for Northamptonshire, Sourav Ganguly had a good outing in the final of the P. Sen Trophy at Eden Gardens. But his 76, on a hot and humid day went in vain as East Bengal lost to Kalighat by 47 runs on Wednesday. Deep Dasguptas Kalighat thus won their maiden title of the season. 

Kalighat piled 303 for loss of three. They were powered by four half-centuries ? Manoj Tewari (78), Mohammed Ziauddin (72), Anustup Maumdar (55) and Sanjib Sanyal (53). 

East Bengal managed 261, Souravs 76 coming in 65 balls and included nine boundaries and four sixes. The killing weather took a toll on the former India captain and he asked for a runner when he was on 46. 

 BRIEF SCORES 

Kalighat 308/3 in 50 ovs (Manoj Tewari 78, Md Ziauddin 72, Anustup Majumdar 55, Sanjib Sanyal 53; Ritam Kundu 2/50). East Bengal 261 in 48.2 overs (Sourav Ganguly 76, Safi Ahmed 41, Prinan Dutta 36; Manoj Roy 2/38, Amit Banerjee 2/40). Kalighat won by 47 runs.

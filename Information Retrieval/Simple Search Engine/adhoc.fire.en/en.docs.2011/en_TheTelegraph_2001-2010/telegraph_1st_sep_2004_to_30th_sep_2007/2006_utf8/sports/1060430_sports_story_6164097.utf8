London: Chelsea retained the Premier League title when they crushed second-placed Manchester United 3-0 at Stamford Bridge on Saturday. 

The victory put Jose Mourinhos side 12 points clear of United with two games to play. 

Defender William Gallas gave Chelsea a perfect start, nipping in to head past Edwin van der Sar after four minutes when Didier Drogba knocked on Frank Lampards corner. 

A magnificent individual goal from midfielder Joe Cole just past the hour mark made it 2-0 and Ricardo Carvalho finished off a sweeping move with a fierce shot after 73 minutes to put the title party in full swing. 

The one blot on the occasion was United and England striker Wayne Rooney being carried off on a stretcher after a fair challenge from Paul Ferreira in the 78th minute that left him clutching his foot in pain. 

Rooney left the stadium on crutches with United manager Alex Ferguson confirming the 20-year-old had injured his foot, describing it as sore. 

Its a fantastic feeling...thats the second in England after two in Portugal, Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho said, before captain John Terry lifted the trophy. 

Mourinho also won successive titles in his native Portugal with Porto, as well as the Champions League. 

Last season no one believed we would win, last season we were six, seven points ahead and still people doubted, he said. This year, in December, people were already saying we were champions. 

Manchester United were fantastic and I think today the result doesnt show how difficult it was for us. 

United responded to the early setback of Gallas goal to carve out several chances, the best falling to Rooney after 21 minutes when he sped through on goal but pulled his shot wide of Petr Cechs goal. 

Rio Ferdinand and Cristiano Ronaldo also had chances for United but their hopes of keeping the title race alive were killed off by a moment of brilliance from Cole. 

The England player latched on to a long Cech clearance that was flicked on by Drogba, danced past Ferdinand and Mikael Silvestre before calmly finishing past Van der Sar. 

United became ragged in the final 20 minutes and Carvalhos rifling shot merely rubbed salt into their wounds as they were left to reflect on a third season without the league title. 

Chelsea deserve all the credit, said Ferguson.3-0 was harsh but we let in soft goals and when you do that against Chelsea you have to take your medicine. 

Champions for the first time in 50 years last season, Mourinhos men have carried on where they left off last term by combining rock solid defending with a relentless attack, striking from either midfield with Lampard or from the front with Didier Drogba. 

Chelseas multi-national mixture of doughty defence and speedy counter-attack led by rotated wingers Dutchman Arjen Robben, Irelands Damien Duff and Cole and Shaun Wright-Phillips of England proved a winning formula. 

But Mourinho worried that leading the table from so early in the season might cause problems with motivation later. 

The lead was whittled down to seven before Chelsea replied with renewed spirit, beating West Ham 4-1 on April 9 after scoring all their goals while a man down following the sending off of Portugal midfielder Maniche. 

United were unexpectedly held to a 0-0 draw by Sunderland and Chelsea capitalised by winning the rest of their games to move within a point of the title before Saturdays showdown. (Reuters)

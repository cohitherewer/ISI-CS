 - Hosts concede 40-run lead 

 Makhaya Ntini in Colombo 

Colombo: Youngsters Chamara Kapugedera and Prasanna Jayawardene sparked a Sri Lankan batting revival after South Africa threatened to run away with the second Test here on Saturday. 

The duo put on 105 for the sixth wicket after a four-wicket haul by South African pace spearhead Makhaya Ntini reduced the hosts to 86 for five before lunch on Day II at the Sara Oval. 

Veteran Chaminda Vaas (64) and Farveez Mahroof (56) continued the fightback by adding 117 for the eighth wicket as Sri Lanka were bowled out for 321 in reply to South Africas 361. 

The tourists, 40 runs ahead on the first innings, were six for no loss in their second knock at stumps with Herschelle Gibbs on four and Andrew Hall on two. 

South Africa, seeking a series-levelling win after being thrashed by an innings and 153 runs in the first Test, lead by 46 runs with all 10 wickets in hand in an absorbing battle between bat and ball. 

Seamer Dale Steyn finished with five for 82 and Ntini claimed four for 84 to help South Africa secure the lead.

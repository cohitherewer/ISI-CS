 Strauss to lead

London: Opener Andrew Strauss was named as Englands stand-in captain on Tuesday for the first Test against Pakistan, while allrounder Andrew Flintoff recovers from a heel injury. 

Strauss led England in their 0-5 humiliation by Sri Lanka in the one-day series, which concluded on Saturday. He was the obvious choice to take charge of the Test side in the absence of Flintoff and first choice skipper Michael Vaughan. The first Test starts at Lords on July 13. (REUTERS)

 I did ask for hard pitches: Inzamam

Rawalpindi: The flat pitches in the first two Indo-Pak Tests, both of which ended in high-scoring draws, came in for a lot of flak. 

All along, Inzamam-ul Haq had maintained that he had no role to play in the preparation of pitches. After the Lahore Test, he had even snapped: Main captain hoon, groundsman nahin. 

Now, the Pakistan captain has revealed that he did seek hard and bouncy tracks for the Lahore and Faisalabad Tests, but did not get what he had asked for. 

Yes, I did have a say in the preparation of these pitches but the truth is what I asked for was not prepared in the first two Tests. I know the strength and weaknesses of my team and was confident when asking the curators to prepare a hard and bouncy pitch, Inzamam said in a daily on Thursday. 

But I dont know for whatever reasons, I was left disappointed twice. Thankfully, we got a good track in Karachi where the surface was not fast but there was some seam movement for the bowlers and we exploited it well to win the Test, he said. Believe me, what I asked for we didnt get in Lahore and Faisalabad. Whatever the reasons for that, it hurts me when fingers are pointed at us. 

The Pakistan captain said there was perhaps a need for the PCB to consult a foreign curator who could help put in place a system for preparing good Test pitches. 

That is the conclusion I have come to after what I have been through in this series. People and critics are still pointing fingers at me saying I was responsible for the dead tracks used for the first two Tests in Lahore and Faisalabad. 

I dont know how our curators work, but I dont think it is impossible to get good Test tracks in Pakistan that produce results, Inzamam said. (Agencies)

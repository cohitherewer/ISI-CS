The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Knoxville (US): Former Australian Open champion Roscoe Tanner received a two-year prison sentence for violating terms of his probation for a 2003 grand theft conviction, according to a television report.

 Tanner, a 55-year-old Tennessee native, was arrested in his home state last October on charges of violating his parole by failing to make restitution payments, $ 80,000 in child support for a daughter he fathered. A Florida judge had sentenced Tanner to 10 years on probation in 2003 for bouncing a 2000 cheque used to purchase a boat. 

 Melbourne: Ivan Ljubicic said on Wednesday that his appointment as playing captain of Davis Cup champions Croatia was a temporary solution while talks continue with Goran Ivanisevic.

 The Croatian Tennis Association this week appointed Ljubicic as captain for Croatia?s opening tie of their Davis Cup defence against Austria in Graz from February 10-12.

 ?That?s a temporary solution. We wait for Goran?s decision what he wants to do,? Ljubicic said.

 Niki Pilic, who guided Croatia to their first title last year, resigned last week.

 London: Toyota?s Ralf Schumacher has backed a proposal for Germany?s two Grand Prix circuits to host Formula One races in alternate years.

 ?If race tracks can?t afford Formula One every year, for whatever reason, maybe its quite a good idea to adapt to that (alternation) for a while,? the German said at a recent pre-season event.

 ?It doesn?t really matter to me. I know both the circuits so well, one year here and another there is quite a good idea,? added Ralf, who has won races at both the Nuerburgring and Hockenheim.

 Hockenheim hosts the German Grand Prix while the Nuerburgring has the European Grand Prix. Neither circuit is making the money it used to, with Hockenheim saddled with an estimated operating loss of around 1.5 million euros ($1.79 million) for 2006.

 Madrid: Barcelona midfielder Deco has been handed a two-match ban by the Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) after being sent off for pulling an opponent?s hair during Sunday?s league match against Athletic Bilbao.

 Deco pulled Carlos Gurpegi?s hair after the Bilbao midfielder had tried to pick him up off the grass following a foul by tugging at his shirt in the closing minutes of Barcelona?s 2-1 victory at the Nou Camp.

 However the federation said it had decided not to take action against Barcelona striker Samuel Eto?o for spitting at defender Unai Exposito in the same match nor against Bilbao coach Javier Clemente for his comments on the incident.

 Berlin: Fifa have agreed to pay 1 million euros ($1.21 million) for a party in Berlin to mark the start of the World Cup and replace the lavish opening gala they cancelled last week.

 Soccer?s world governing body had agreed to pay the money after talks with Berlin mayor Klaus Wowereit on Tuesday, the city said in a statement.

 ?Now we begin the planning on a sound footing,? Wowereit said.

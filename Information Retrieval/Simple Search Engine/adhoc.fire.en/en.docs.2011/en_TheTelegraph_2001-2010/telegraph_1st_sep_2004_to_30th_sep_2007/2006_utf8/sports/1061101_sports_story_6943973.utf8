 Dhoni bats for Chappell 

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Jamshedpur: Greg Chappelll may be attracting criticism from various quarters, including some former India coaches and stalwarts, but he has a supporter in Mahendra Singh Dhoni. 

The swashbuckling cricketer, who is in the city to meet some of his Ranji teammates, on Tuesday supported coach Chappellls experimentation with Team India. 

Dhoni said that it is time for Team India coach to really experiment with the team as he wont have ample time till the World Cup. Of course one cant experiment with the team during next years World Cup. I think Chappelll is doing the right thing as far as experimentation with the team is concerned, he added. 

According to him, Chappell has only three months time before the mega show in the West Indies and he has to experiments with certain things within this period.

 Lara to play ODIs again

New Delhi: Having stayed away from the shorter version of the game for some time now, West Indian superstar Brian Lara on Tuesday said he would take part in the 2007 World Cup and was willing to sacrifice anything to help his team regain the lost glory. 

He said winning the World Cup, which has eluded the West Indies for the past 26 years, was one of his cherished dreams. 

I am ready to sacrifice anything to see West Indies become the best team in the world. To beat teams like Australia and England in the World Cup would be great, Lara said. 

Lara told a TV channel that he would return to the one-day fold either against Zimbabwe or India when they tour the Caribbean. (PTI)

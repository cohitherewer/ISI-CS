 AIFF drops referee

New Delhi: The All India Football Federation (AIFF) on Tuesday recalled Bikramjit, the referee from Delhi who officiated in the controversial National Football League match between Fransa Pax and Mahindra United in Goa on Monday night. 

Bikramjit had awarded two dubious penalties to the Federation Cup champions, who won the match 2-1. He has been summoned back even though he was scheduled to stay in Goa for another 10 days in order to officiate in other matches. 

The AIFF has taken the first step by calling back the referee, and we are hoping for a prompt decision to resolve this controversy, Goa Football Association (GFA) secretary Savio Messias said. 

Fransa has lodged an official complaint about the standard of refereeing in the match, besides threatening to pull out of the NFL unless the game was replayed or points shared. There is no question of playing our next NFL match against Air India on Friday unless our rightful demand is met, club president Micky Pacheco said. 

Alleging bias on the part of the referee, he said, the two penalties awarded against us were wrong decisions. Also, one of our goals was wrongly ruled as off-side, adding we were at the wrong end of some poor refereeing in the Federation Cup also. 

Messias agreed, saying: The first penalty was a wrong decision and the second was even worse. But Messias also pulled up the local supporters and club officials for their errant behaviour. 

There was stone-pelting and breaking of window-panes and the referee and Mahindra players were also under threat. Such conduct cannot be condoned. (PTI)

 Following are statistical highlights 

 of the opening days play of the India versus West 

 Indies first Test at the Antigua Recreation Ground, St Johns:

 India fielded one of their least experienced pace attacks 

 in Tests in St Johns on Friday. Sreesanth (2), Munaf 

 Patel (2) and VRV Singh (debutant) have a combined experience 

 of four Tests. Indias least experienced pace attack 

 was against England in Mohali in December 2001, when they 

 had three debutants ? Tinu Yohanan, Iqbal Siddiqui and 

 Sanjay Bangar ? in the XI.

 For the first time in West Indian history, five players 

 of Indian origin ? Shivnarine Chanderpaul, Daren Ganga, 

 Dave Mohammed, Denesh Ramdin and Ramnaresh Sarwan ? featured 

 in the XI. For the record, the last time the West Indies 

 fielded a team without a player of Indian origin was against 

 Australia, in St Johns only, in April 1999.

 VRV Singh became the 256th Indian to play Test cricket. 

 He has the experience of just eight first-class matches, 

 including six Ranji Trophy games for Punjab since November 

 2004

 Mark Waugh (181 catches in 128 Tests), Mark Taylor (157 

 in 104), Allan Border (156 in 156) and Stephen Fleming 

 (152 in 102) in the 150-catch club (excluding wicketkeepers)

 Panesar called stupid Indian

 Panesar 

Melbourne: England cricketer of Indian origin Monty Panesar got a taste of the racial abuse in Australia on Monday as the spinner was called a stupid Indian by some spectators during a tour match against New South Wales at the Sydney Cricket Ground. 

The only Sikh to play for England was targeted by some fans during the match as he fielded near the boundary, according to a report on the portal of Sydney-based daily. 

Give us a wave Monty. You cant speak English you stupid Indian, Ill have to say it in Indian. What are you doing playing in the English side, youre not English, a spectator shouted at Panesar. 

However, no official complaint was made on the issue. 

Fans face lifetime bans if found guilty of racial abuse while countries failing to uphold penalties may lose the international playing status at the venue where the incident takes place.

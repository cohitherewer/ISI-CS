 The more straightforward a captain, the better

 - Mike Gatting talks on leadership and how he was influenced 

 by Brearley

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Mike Gatting

Mumbai: It was under Mike 

 Gatting that England last won the Ashes in Australia (1986-87) 

 and, so, hes going to remain special for a lot of 

 people ? till, at least, another England captain wins Down 

 Under. Gatting, who played 79 Tests (4,409 runs) and 92 

 ODIs (2,095 runs), was solid in the middle-order with a 

 no-nonsense approach. Currently in India as Grand Cru Travels 

 host for a group of well-heeled fans from the UK, the 48-year-old 

 Gatting spoke to The Telegraph at the CCI on Tuesday 

 evening. 

 The following are excerpts 

 On hosting high-end fans

 Its a nice experience, very different of 

 course... My first assignment was to the West Indies (2003-04)... 

 Then, in the next season, I took fans to South Africa... 

 We keep the numbers to around 30 and arent driven 

 by volumes. 

On what else keeps him busy 

 Among other things, I write for one of the Sunday 

 newspapers, do some work for the BBC and am president of 

 the Lords Taverners, which is the biggest cricket 

 charity in the UK. Im also helping the Cricket Foundation, 

 with the aim of getting cricket back into the state schools. 

 (Adds laughing) I do have things on my plate. 

On coaching in Europe 

 Yeah, Ive been doing it for the European 

 Cricket Council. 

On not going on to coach England despite having been the A teams coach 

 The ECB had other plans... 

On the difference a coach can make at the international level 

 Lots, but only by way of improving the preparation 

 and ironing out deficiencies... At the top level, you cant 

 have much of coaching in the strictest sense... A coach 

 shouldnt say too much, but still make his point... 

 Must open the mind of his players... 

On who should be the boss in the dressing room 

 Without a shadow of doubt, the captain... The coach 

 has to complement him, no more. 

On Englands Ashes win last summer 

 It was a huge moment and such a great advertisement 

 for the sport... Such was the impact that kids, who would 

 usually play soccer in September, began playing cricket. 

On whether the Ashes hype affected Englands performance in Pakistan, the first engagement of a fresh season 

 Winning in the sub-continent isnt easy and 

 losing some key players didnt help... The (Ashes) 

 hype wasnt a factor. 

On England in India 

 A remarkable performance, considering that a number 

 of the big names had to either pull out or go home for one 

 reason or the other... The guys have competed very well 

 and Ive been impressed with the way (Andrew) Flintoff 

 has captained in Michael Vaughans absence. 

On whether Nasser Hussain deserves most of the credit for Englands recovery after the late 1990s slump 

 Nasser did what was needed at that time... He injected 

 steel, let everybody know England would be hard to beat... 

 But, as always, theres the next level and Vaughan 

 has taken us there... He has allowed the players to produce 

 their natural game and Flintoff is an excellent example. 

 The players have been more comfortable under Vaughan... 

 When Flintoff does get the job full-time, Im sure 

 hell do the same ? allow the players to express themselves. 

On whether Hussains toughness had everything to do with his coming from Essex and Graham Goochs school 

 Perhaps, yes... Graham was a single-minded person, 

 used to be very focused and that approach certainly helped 

 him when he batted. 

On the qualities a captain must have 

 (Grins) Honesty... The 

 more straightforward a captain, the better... Honesty brings 

 about more respect and a captain has to enjoy that in abundance... 

 The other big things are man-management skills and a sharp 

 tactical mind. Quickly responding to changing situations 

 is important. (After a pause) Flintoff has been doing 

 well because (a) hes straightforward and (b) is respected 

 by the guys for his achievements. 

On Sourav Ganguly as captain 

 I wasnt privy to the ins and outs, but he 

 did a fine job... However, there comes a time when one has 

 to move on... Rahul Dravid has settled down well and Im 

 sure hes highly respected in the dressing room... 

 Sourav wants to come back, but when theres no place 

 even for the very special (V.V.S.) Laxman, where is he going 

 to bat? The selectors wont open with him and, in the 

 middle order, there are far too many candidates... 

On his role model captain 

 Mike Brearley... I learnt everything from him... 

 Apart from the qualities most know about, Brearley had another 

 ? he made everybody feel they were part of the team... I 

 remember, as a 19-year-old playing for Middlesex, walking 

 towards the other end (at Lords) and being joined 

 by Brearley. He asked so, what should we do? 

 That made me feel so important... I mean, the England and 

 Middlesex captain wanted my opinion... From then 

 on, I kept myself totally involved... Began thinking of 

 possibilities... That one question changed my approach. 

 (After a pause) The way Brearley handled Ian Bothan 

 was exceptional... Nobody else could have done it that way. 

On what has made Australia such a powerhouse 

 The quality of players... Theyve got some 

 of the best batsmen (Ricky Ponting, Matthew Hayden), the 

 finest bowlers (Shane Warne, Glenn McGrath) and the best 

 wicketkeeper-batsman of all time ? Adam Gilchrist... Then, 

 if you go back some years, they had the Waugh Brothers and 

 so on... Weve become a force because of the emergence 

 of four quality fast bowlers: Steve Harmison, Matthew Hoggard, 

 Simon Jones and Flintoff himself... The bottomline to look 

 for is quality. 

On the England players to look out for 

 James Anderson, for one... Of course, he has already 

 played for England... Among batsmen, I would pick Middlesexs 

 Edmund Joyce (whose roots are in Ireland)... Hes an 

 outstanding left-hander. 

On whether cricket is moving in the right direction 

 I dont have a complaint and Im happy 

 that the experiment with super subs will stop... Like many 

 others, I didnt like it. I hope, though, the administrators 

 are going to pump in more money at the grassroots and give 

 attention to cricket in the schools. 

Finally, on whether the controversies involving him (the showdown with umpire Shakoor Rana and the rebel tour of South Africa, for example) have taken quite a bit away from his achievements as an England captain and player 

 (Emotionally) Some good 

 things happened, some bad things... Thats life... 

 Id like to think people will look past some of the 

 things and look at what I did for England and Middlesex... 

 However, its not that Im particularly worried.

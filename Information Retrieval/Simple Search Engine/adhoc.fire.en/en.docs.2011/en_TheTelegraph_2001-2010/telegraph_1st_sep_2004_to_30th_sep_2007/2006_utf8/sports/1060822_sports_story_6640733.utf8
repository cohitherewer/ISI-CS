 Waugh backs Hair

Melbourne: Former Australian captain Steve Waugh has come out in support of umpire Darrell Hair, saying no one is bigger than the game. 

Though Waugh said Hair could be stubborn and a bit hard-nosed, no team could get away without turning up. 

He (Hair) is not going to say it for no reason. He would know the storm it would create. He has been through the (Muttiah) Muralidharan incident so he knows the ramifications. He would not have done it lightly, he wrote in a local newspaper. 

If they (Pakistan) dont go back, the Test is over. Thats quite simple. Sunil Gavaskar tried that one on in Australia (in 1981). No one is bigger than the game, he said.

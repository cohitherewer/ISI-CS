Calcutta: As expected, East Bengal lifted their 31st title with a 1-0 victory over Eastern Railway on Tuesday. But the game of football took a beating at the East Bengal ground. 

Alvito DCunhas fourth goal in the league, in the 70th minute, was the all-important one which fetched them three points and the Sahara CFL Premier Division title. But his behaviour after scoring the winner took away much sheen off his brilliant effort. 

Alvito, who came in as replacement for Mohammed Mukhtar, scored from a free-kick. He bent it like David Beckham from around 22 yards to bulge the netting. Soon after, he seemed to lose his senses. 

Alvito ran towards Eastern Railway custodian Kalyan Lodh, who had a very good day in office, made an obscene gesture at him, and worse, elbowed him (later, he claimed it was not intentional). 

Lodh went to the ground, rather dramatically. It looked to be play-acting. Chaos ensued in the overflowing stands. 

Forgetting the Alvito act, East Bengal fans hurled crackers at the Eastern Railway players and abused them too. 

Referee Kashinath Sen took 10 minutes to send off Alvito and Eastern Railways Sanjit Dutta Bhowmick (with a second booking). 

East Bengal finished with 32 points, while Mohun Bagan are now on 27 with one match in hand. Whatever be the result of the green-and-maroons last game against United SC on Wednesday, Mohun Bagan will finish runners-up.

 Spotlight on Ghei

New Delhi: Gaurav Ghei is gunning for victory at the inaugural $400,000 Amby Valley Asian Masters next week to seal his return to form. 

The 37-year-old was one of the sub-continents first players to break through on the Asian Tour and more than a decade since his only career victory, Ghei hopes to capitalise on home advantage and complete his recovery from a lean spell. 

Playing in India is great and with the home support and local cheers, it is definitely an advantage playing on home soil. I feel good and Im looking forward to the Amby Valley Asian Masters, said Ghei. (PTI)

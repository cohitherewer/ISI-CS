 Peshawar dropped as international venue 

Islamabad: Pakistan have dropped the northwestern frontier province city of Peshawar from their list of international venues this season after complaints from the ICC. 

The ICC Match Referee had expressed his dissatisfaction over the facilities and arrangements when we played India in a one-dayer in February this year, Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Director Abbas Zaidi said. The complaints pertained to lack of facilities and proper security arrangements for the match officials and teams, he added. 

Chris Broad of England was the Match Referee of the Pakistan-India series.

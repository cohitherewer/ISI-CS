The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 I am never at my best... Sky is the limit: Bhutia 

 - We should not feel ashamed to learn from people 

JAYDEEP BASU

 Bhaichung Bhutia 

New Delhi: Bhaichung Bhutia has never been a player who wishes to sit on past laurels. Just when critics are wondering whether his down- hill journey has begun, the India captain has come back with a bang, scoring some stunning goals for East Bengal in the National Football League. 

Days before leading India in Japan in the Asian Cup qualifiers, he made it clear, while speaking to The Telegraph, that he still had a lot left in him. Dont dismiss us against Japan, he insisted. 

The following are excerpts 

Q You are finally back in form and scoring in almost every important match. Only a few months back you were criticised by coaches like Syed Nayeemuddin and Subhas Bhowmick for poor display... 

A Lets not take names. It will only create unnecessary controversies. Generally, I can tell you a few things. I know that I would come across many people in life who would say a lot of things which I should not bother about. 

Most of these people I find are simply stupid and make meaningless statements. Do you want me to respond to these stupid and senseless things daily? Then I have it. I will then never be able to concentrate on my game. 

On my part all I can say is that I was then injured and was not fully fit to give my best. Some people did not realise it. Some did realise but still did not stop criticising me. Now I am fully fit and trying to dish out my best.Are you playing at your best like it was in the late nineties? 

A very difficult question to answer because I am never at my best. I want to play far better than I ever played. For me, sky is the limit. I want to reach the top. I actually make a fresh start in every match. I totally forget about the last match and concentrate on the next assignment. 

In football, the match you played last night becomes history by the next morning. You cannot live on past. What matters is present and thats the stark reality you have to face. 

Will this two-week camp before the Japan match help? 

Hardly. Whats going on here is only a stop-gap arrangement. Not even the best coach in the world can produce result in such a short time. Football these days cannot be played in this manner, lets face this fact. 

What India need at the moment is four top and knowledgeable foreign coaches. The country should be divided into four zones and each foreign coach should be in charge of one zone each on a long-term basis. 

But you know in India there are reservations about foreign coaches... 

Thats stupid again. We are placed 118th in the Fifa rankings. Countries in Europe and Latin America are among the top 30 in the world. Why not just admit the fact that they are better than us and seek their help? Whats the harm in learning? 

We should not feel ashamed in learning from people who know this subject better than us. Did Chelsea feel embarrassed when they recruited Peter Kenyon as the CEO from Manchester United? 

You mean to say we are refusing to learn? 

Partly. There is another problem in India. There is no one here to guide people. Guidance is also very much necessary in building up the team and individual players. Look at players like I.M. Vijayan and Jo Paul Ancheri. 

Leave alone other footballers, but these two ? IM and Jo Paul ? should have and could have played in top Asian club teams and even in some European clubs. No one guided them when they were at the top. 

Why dont you then guide some of the present players to go abroad and play? 

Yes I can, but none in the present team has reached that level yet. Some of them like (Syed Rahim) Nabi or Mehtab (Hussain) are playing quite well at the national level, but they are yet to reach that height like IM or Jo Paul. They were too good by Indian standard. 

So, you feel we have no chance against Japan. 

Please dont dismiss us like that. I am practical, but optimistic. Let me tell you, We are quite high on confidence. We have got a chance to play against a team like Japan and should grab this opportunity to do our best. This is a great chance to show the world that we too can produce results. 

How long you want to play? 

As long as I can. So far I have not given a thought to retirement. I am feeling highly motivated and looking forward to play every match. Why should I think about retirement?

 Real hope Becks will stay

Madrid: Real Madrid president Ramon Calderon remains hopeful that David Beckham will sign a two-year contract extension despite admitting that other teams are interested in signing the former England captain. 

Beckham is the sort of player that has a lot of suitors and I know that he has a lot of offers because he is a key player in many ways, but especially from the sporting point of view, Calderon was quoted as saying on the Real Madrid website on Wednesday. 

I think he will sign for two more years, that is to say that he will stay here for this season and two more, but we will have to see if he wants to stay or not. (Reuters)

 Chowrasia, Vijay joint leaders

 - Indian Open 

 S.S.P. Chowrasia 

New Delhi: It was an Indian party at the Hero Honda Indian Open golf tournament here on Friday with Vijay Kumar and S.S.P. Chowrasia sharing the lead after a flawless 10-under for 36 holes on the second day. 

Six other Indians were within four shots of the co-leaders as the Indians took full advantage of home conditions and their knowledge of the Delhi Golf Club Course. 

Englands Simon Dyson and Australian Unho Park were a shot further back in the Asian Tour event, where 24 players were unable to finish as darkness fell. 

Jyoti Randhawa (67) was tied fifth, while Rahil Gangjee (66) was tied seventh with Firoz Ali, who was yet to complete his second round, but was seven-under through 15 holes. 

Mukesh Kumar (68) was tied 10th with amateur Chiragh Kumar (69) at six-under as was Vivek Bhandari, who still had two holes to play. Gaurav Ghei (68) was tied 19th with C. Muniyappa (70) at five-under. Shiv Kapur shot a five-under 67 and moved to tied 26th. 

Chowrasia nailed five birdies and an eagle, which was chipped from off the green. Chowrasia was five-under for the par-fives and was helped by an eagle on the first. On the front nine, he had a dream run with three birdies between sixth and ninth. Vijay also shot a flawless 68. He made four birdies, three on the back nine. 

Jyoti Randhawa, the winner of Indian Open in 2000, and Prom Meesawat from Thailand, who came joint third last year, were eight-under for the tournament after returning rounds of 67 and 68 respectively. 

Joint first round leader Simon Dunn from Scotland crashed to a 77. Gangjee said, I stayed in the present and tried to focus on the job at hand rather than think about scores. 

I didnt even feel the fatigue of playing 24 holes. I guess you dont feel it when you are playing well. 

I have been playing this course for the last 10 years, so I suppose I know it a bit. The greens were softer today, but the speed was still good. On some holes the ball was spinning back. So, one can go for the flag.

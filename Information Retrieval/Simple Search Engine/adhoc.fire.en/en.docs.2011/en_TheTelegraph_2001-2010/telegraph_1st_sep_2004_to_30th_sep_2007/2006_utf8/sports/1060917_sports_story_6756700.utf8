 for missed chances

 Spain were outstanding in the 

 manner they played their hockey World Cup semi-final against 

 defending champions Germany, but were unlucky not to advance 

 to the title-round.

 With Australia coming through 

 beating Korea in the other semi-final, the Aussies have 

 a chance to avenge their 2002 defeat against Germany.

 Spain, despite ripping through 

 the German defence in a manner seldom seen in international 

 hockey, were unable to convert more than half a dozen scoring 

 chances.

 Germanys famed defence wilted 

 under the Spanish onslaught, but the hosts hung on grimly. 

 That gave a glimpse of the German defenders mental 

 strength, which eventually carried them into the final.

 Germanys 3-1 victory in 

 the penalty shootout, after being tied 2-2 after regulation 

 period and extra-time, did not reflect the Spanish domination.

 Spains wayward shooting 

 allowed this young German team to have another shot at the 

 title they clinched in Kuala Lumpur.

 Once again, Germany will have 

 to overcome a robust Australia, who overcame the disappointment 

 of losing the 2002 World Cup final by winning the Olympic 

 gold medal. They will now be seeking revenge for the defeat 

 of four years ago.

 Who would have predicted this 

 line-up for the final after Germanys first match against 

 India, where the defending champions secured victory only 

 through a last-minute goal owing to a defensive lapse by 

 the Indians. But the young German outfit has exhibited its 

 growing confidence as the tournament proceeded.

 The home crowds support 

 has apparently played a huge role in lifting Germanys 

 game. Australia must be aware of the challenge confronting 

 them despite a comparatively easier 4-2 victory against 

 Asian Games champions South Korea.

 The Koreans proved that rankings 

 mean little when teams go on to the field. The nippy Koreans 

 silenced their critics by twice taking the lead against 

 Australia.

 Australia have appeared to be 

 the most-balanced team, with fine players for all positions. 

 It was this quality of the Aussie team that made the difference 

 against Korea, who played a hard game and rightly earned 

 applause for their display.

 Starting with the silver medal 

 at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, the Koreans now have two 

 appearances in the semi-finals at successive World Cups. 

 Such achievements would be the envy of any nation.

 My pick of the match was the second 

 Korean goal that Kang Seong-Jang created from an acute angle, 

 keeping the Asian team ahead after Bevan George had neutralised 

 the first-half deficit with a penalty corner strike.

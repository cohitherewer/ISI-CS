The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 He can really add value in more than one area, says Wadekar

 - If fit and in form, Sourav must be there for the World Cup, feels former captain and coach 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Mumbai: If Sourav Ganguly builds on his handsome century against North Zone in a recent Duleep Trophy face-off then, in the respected Ajit Wadekars opinion, the selectors must recall him for the World Cup next March-April. 

If I had a say, I would do that, remarked the former India captain, coach and selection committee chairman. Sourav, 34, has been off the ODI scene for over 14 months. 

While the actual selection for crickets No.1 spectacle is still some way off, the 30 probables have to be named by January 11/12. 

Speaking to The Telegraph on Friday afternoon, Wadekar added: Youve got to have a blend of experience and youth, particularly in a tournament such as the World Cup. If Sourav is consistently among the runs in domestic cricket, then he should be there. 

In fact, I would select him to partner Sachin Tendulkar at the very top of the order... Theirs was a hugely successful opening partnership and its not on sentimental grounds alone that Im saying whatever I have... It has been driven by cricket sense. 

Reacting to something being talked about, specifically that Souravs comeback may make Rahul Dravid insecure, Wadekar commented: I dont think so... Surely, Sourav knows he cant get back the captaincy... He wants to return as a player only... If hes back, Dravid can even draw on his experience (as captain) to tackle difficult situations. 

Lets not forget that Sourav has been our greatest captain... Till he took charge (March 2000), we werent aggressive enough... Moreover, his record speaks for itself... Dravid, therefore, may gain if Sourav is around... 

 Sourav Ganguly

Going back to the time he replaced Mansur Ali Khan Tiger Pataudi, in 1970-71, Wadekar said: Tiger played under me in 1972-73 and there were no bad vibes in the dressing room... Rather, there were occasions when I picked his brain, took suggestions... I didnt find Tiger scheming to get back the captaincy. He did eventually, but after I retired. 

Wadekar, though, reminded that the game is bigger than any individual and the teams interest alone must determine the choice of players. The selectors should ask themselves one question: Whats best for the country? Thats it... 

Its, of course, debatable whether that has always been done. 

Provided Sourav is in form and has kept himself fit, he can really add value in more than one area... Im not going to write him off... Hes focused on a comeback and, if he continues the good work, I dont see why he cant make the World Cup squad, Wadekar signed off. 

With East failing to make the Duleep final, Sourav lost out on a big chance. His ne xt opportunity will be in Mohali (from November 23), during Bengals first Ranji Trophy match of the 2006-07 season. 

Generally, wickets there arent batsman-friendly, so an effort high on character is going to count for much. Clearly, Souravs future is in his own hands.

 Atwal-Randhawa set for Irish test

Bangkok: Indias Jyoti Randhawa and Arjun Atwal, both former Asian number ones, have been paired together to meet Irishmen Paul McGinley and Graeme McDowell in foursomes $1.5 million Royal Trophy at the New Amata Spring golf course here. 

Local heroes, Thongchai Jaidee and Thaworn Wiratchant face an epic showdown against European legends Nick Faldo and Ian Woosnam in another match of the opening session on Saturday. 

The Thai stars will anchor the home side in the alternate-shot format matches against a battle-hardened and the proven combination of Faldo and Woosnam. 

Randhawa (2002), Atwal (2003), Jaidee (2004) and Wiratchant (2005) have been Asia No. 1 in the last four years and will be the backbone of the Asian team. 

Europes non-playing captain Seve Ballesteros will send out Englands David Howell, ranked 11th in the world, and compatriot Kenneth Ferrie for the opening encounter against Sk Ho of Korea and Japans Keiichiro Fukabori. 

Big Dane Thomas Bjorn and Swede Henrik Stenson, who enjoyed a successful partnership in the Seve Trophy last year by winning all their three matches together, take on Chinese matchplay wizard Zhang Lian-wei and Yasuharo Imano of Japan in the third foursomes match. 

Atwal and Randhawa, both past stars of dynasty cup team for Asia, also played together in the World Cup in November in Spain and were the best Asian team in ninth place. 

Kuramoto, one of the most decorated golfers in Japan with 30 career triumphs, was delighted with the draw. 

Knowing Seve, I expected him to play Faldo and Woosnam in the last match because they are both outstanding players. I am happy my guess was correct as I wanted my Thai players to be in the last match, said Kuramoto. 

If we can obtain three points in the morning, it will be nice. But looking at the pairings now, i will be happy if the score is tied 2-2 after the foursomes. Former US Masters champion Woosnam formed a formidable partnership with Faldo in the Ryder Cup, notching five wins and two halves from 10 outings together.

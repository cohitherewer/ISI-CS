 Nadeem wins it for colts

London: Left-arm spinner Shahbaz Nadeem claimed a five-wicket haul to spin India colts to a comprehensive 249-run victory against England in the third Test at the Denis Compton Oval at Shenley on Wednesday. 

Sixteen-year-old Nadeem from Bokaro picked five for 41 as England, set an improbably target of 447, were skittled out for 197 in 105.5 overs. 

A defiant half-century by Michael Shea kept Englands hopes of snatching a draw alive but their innings came to an end soon after the dismissal of the 18-year old right-handed Glamorgan bat. 

Shea, who struck a valuable 39 in the first innings, top scored with 56 and kept the Indians at bay as he stretched the hosts total from 159 for eight to 197. 

Leg-spinner Karan Singh, who claimed three wickets conceding 26 runs from Chandigarh delivered the killer punch by having shea caught by a substitute and then the No. 11 Steven Finn for a duck in the space of three balls. 

India lead the four-match series 1-0 after the first two Tests were drawn.

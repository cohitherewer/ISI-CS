 Panesar not a certainty, says Fletcher

London: England spinner Monty Panesar may not play in the first Ashes Test against Australia in Brisbane next week despite indications he would be picked, coach Duncan Fletcher said on Friday. 

Panesar impressed on the first day of the tour match against South Australia in what was meant to be the England line-up to start the Ashes. However, the pull-out of opener Marcus Trescothick with a stress-related illness could change matters. 

We wanted Monty if Trescothick was there because Trescothick added depth. Now, we might have to re-think it, Fletcher said. 

Were not going to say that side is cast in stone. The major factor is to see what the balance of the side looks like.

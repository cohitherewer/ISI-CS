The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 My drink was spiked, says Beck

Bratislava: Slovakias Karol Beck, banned from tennis on Monday for two years after a positive drug test, believes an acquaintance spiked his drink in a night club. 

In a tearful press conference on Tuesday, Beck denied taking performance-enhancing products and said he had one other possible explanation for the failed test ? that he had accidentally taken one of his mothers asthma pills. 

Beck tested positive for the anabolic agent clenbuterol during Slovakias Davis Cup semi-final win over Argentina in September, the sports ruling body (ITF) said on Monday. The player believes his drink was spiked during a night out earlier that month in Bratislava. 

I was at a night club with members of Slovakias professional tennis circle, he said. I never thought something like this could happen, but I have my suspicions who it was. 

I think its more likely someone did this to me on purpose. I have my reasons. Slovaks are jealous of success. 

He vowed to appeal against his ban and said he had filed charges with Slovak police against the unknown culprits who ruined his career. 

Slovakia beat Argentina 4-1 in the semi-final before losing 3-2 to Croatia in the final. 

In the semi-final Beck played the opening singles and also in the doubles, both of which Slovakia won. 

During the Davis Cup Final in December, Beck repeatedly denied rumours he had tested positive but did not play, citing a knee injury. Beck now says he has known the results of the dope test since October. 

He plans to keep fit for his comeback if the ban, which expires in November 2007, is upheld. 

I hope the sentence will at least be reduced, he said. But I have to keep practising, stay strong, have faith. 

I have never taken performance-enhancing drugs. I would never take drugs.

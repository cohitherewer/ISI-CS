The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Bhutia to join camp today

A STAFF REPORTER

 Bhutia 

Calcutta: Within a few hours after chief coach Bob Houghton saying on Sunday that he is keen to get Bhaichung Bhutia in the camp for the August 16 AFC Asian Cup qualifying match against Saudi Arabia, the star striker reversed his decision to quit and is now ready to join the camp. 

Bhaichung, who returned to Calcutta on Sunday afternoon from his native village of Tinki Tam in Sikkim, made himself available for the camp from Monday. I am joining the camp on Monday following a discussion with coach Bob Houghton, Bhaichung told The Telegraph on Sunday. 

Earlier, Houghton said in press conference in a city hotel on Sunday: I dont have any ego problem with him (Bhaichung) Ill speak to him tonight and he may join the camp by Tuesday. 

I dont know whether hell be available. But if you ask me whether we want him in the team, Ill say absolutely. 

The chief India coach said that he wanted Bhaichung back in the national squad, but was awaiting further discussions. Bhaichungs inclusion will definitely boost the national squad. He is a fine team-man, he said. 

Houghton revealed that Bhaichung and I.M. Vijayan, whom he had seen operating in tandem in the 1998 Asian Games, had caught his eyes. 

They both looked dangerous at that time and I kept a strict vigil on them, Houghton said. 

Bhaichung is very popular in the squad and shares a good rapport with all the support staffAs a coach I will obviously want him to be part of the squad, the Briton said. 

According to the coach, the former Indian captain had told him (before the squad left for Vancouver) that he felt a lack of motivation to represent his country. 

He (Bhaichung) told me that he needed rest. I found this natural as he has been playing for a long time, and taking a lot of pressure as well. He had also been attending long camps, Houghton stated, adding that this is one of the reasons why he is not in favour of long camps. 

Long camps may affect the players interest for the game, he said.

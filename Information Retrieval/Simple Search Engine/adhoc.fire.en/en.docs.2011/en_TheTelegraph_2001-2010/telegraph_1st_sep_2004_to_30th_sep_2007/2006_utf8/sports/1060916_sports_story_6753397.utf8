The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 No advantage from Warnes attack on Buchanan...

 - TIE vs AUSSIES 

 - For me, it will be just another cricket match: Chappell 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Chappell 

Kuala Lumpur: If the Indians were hoping to gain some advantage from Shane Warnes long-distance attack on John Buchanan, in the lead-up to Saturdays face-off at the Kinrara Oval, that got scuttled when the Australian coach had a ten-minute chat with Test crickets highest wickettaker. 

The theme: Clearing the air. 

Warne, one learns, clarified that the tone of the reports coming out from the UK (where he currently is) wasnt in harmony with what he had actually said. Also, he had been positive about the coach and remains committed to the principle of team solidarity. 

The conversation took place on Friday evening after Warne responded to messages left on his phone by captain Ricky Ponting and Buchanan. As Warne couldnt speak to Ponting, who was in the midst of a pool session, he requested the coach to brief him. 

Its unclear whether the issue is going to end with one call, but the Australians werent in disarray on the eve of the DLF Cups biggest match (Mahendra Singh Dhonis 50th) of the league stage. Incidentally, it has been quite a while 31 months since India and Australia last featured in a one-dayer which ran its course. 

The one in Amstelveen (August 2004) had to be abandoned and if the weather continues to be messy the Indians nets at the beautiful Turf Club had to be called off because of heavy rain then we may have a repeat. 

Having lost to the West Indies on the Duckworth/Lewis Method, on Thursday, the Indians cant afford a situation (because of the weather or otherwise) where the points table continues to show a blank. 

Weve had enough bad weather (from last month, in Sri Lanka) to last a couple of years... Its frustrating, but we cant control it... Weve got to be at the top of our game throughout, observed Rahul Dravid, the Indian captain. 

The other day (Tuesday), the West Indies were in control for three-fourths, but the Australians still came back strongly... We intend being positive and aggressive... Were up against the best, but in the past year, weve ourselves played good cricket, he added. 

Dravid didnt commit himself, but indicated Yuvraj Singh (who didnt play versus the West Indies) could figure in the XI. Contacted at the team hotel, the top gun said: Im feeling fine and wont have problems if selected... 

For Yuvraj to return, either Suresh Raina or one of the mediumpacers will have to sit out. On Thursday, barring Munaf Patel, others had simply not been spot on. 

The face-off is going to be the first between the two countries in the Greg Chappell era. Indias coach (who has captained Australia), though, insisted there would be no emotions of the unusual kind. He told The Telegraph: For me, it will be just another cricket match... Yeah, thats it... 

Even fleetingly, then, no divided loyalties. 

Asked whether he had seen a difference between this Indian team and the one in 2004, Ponting quipped: Having an Australian as coach can make the most difference... He (Chappell) knows our game very well... 

How well should be evident not many hours from now. 

Ponting couldnt see much of the India-West Indies match, but remarked that his team respected India. Also, that Sachin Tendulkars return at the top of the order had lent balance. 

He didnt reveal his cards where the composition of the XI is concerned, but its going to be a surprise if Brett Lee doesnt come into the frame. 

The Sachin-Glenn McGrath duel will be eagerly watched, but the maestro emphasised that the contest would be between two teams, not two individuals. Sachin added: Playing him is going to be a challenge... 

The match, by the way, will be played on the wicket which hosted Tuesdays opener between Australia and the West Indies. The batsmen, surely, are going to be relieved.

 PONTING ON BEING NO.1

 On Friday, captain Ricky Ponting 

 spoke about Australia being the No.1 team. Here goes: Others 

 can always catch up... Being No.1 comes from winning matches... 

 Winning even from difficult positions and its about 

 turning the negative to positive... Were keen to 

 stretch our lead... Winning comes from ability, yes, but 

 lots of self-belief and confidence as well... Were 

 in Kuala Lumpur to win... Typically Ponting.

 Randhawa finishes 14th, Jeev 21st 

New Delhi: After a decent tied 14th finish at the Wales Open, Jyoti Randhawa moved up to the 129th place while Jeev Milkha Singh climbed up four rungs to be 162nd in the latest world official golf rankings. 

According to information received here, Randhawa, who was placed 137th last week after his poor tied 58th finish at the BMW Championship, moved up due to a vastly improved show at the Wales Open and averaged 1.15 points. 

Jeev (.94), who finished tied 21st in the Wales Open, inched towards breaking into the top-150. Shiv Kapur (.99), who has failed to arrest the slide in form, slipped four rungs to 156 while Orlando-based Arjun Atwal (.98) was languishing at 158th, dropping two notches from his last weeks position. 

Tiger Woods was leading the charts and his total number of weeks as world No. 1 is now 394. His closest challenger Phil Mickelson was 6.89 average points behind the leader.

 Madhab Das, Okonji Patrick and Bijoy Basfore rejoice after beating Mohun Bagan 1-0 in their National League match at the Salt Lake Stadium on Saturday. Picture by Gautam Bose 

Calcutta: A few minutes into the second-half and Mohammedan Sporting coach Mohammed Habib was planning for a change in the field. Seeing Satyajit Bose standing with the fourth referee as a replacement of Bijen Singh, captain Okonji Onyelo Patrick rushed to his coach and requested him not to have the replacement carried out at that time. 

He told me that quite a few of his teammates in the middle have received injuries and it would be wiser to go for replacement after seeing how they carry on in the next few minutes. I found logic in his suggestion, Habib said after his team scored an upset 1-0 victory over Mohun Bagan at the Salt Lake Stadium on Saturday. 

Patrick not only scored the goal, a minute before the break, but inspired his teams tremendous fight against the flurry of attacks from the opposite end. That sort of involvement and inspiration was sadly missing in Mohun Bagans foreign duo ? Awudu Ibrahim and Coffi Agbessi. The way they missed chances after chances in the first half itself bordered on the inexplicable, if not unbelievable. The latter in particular was responsible for the green-and-maroons journey from the scintillating to the subdued. 

Its a pure tale of bad luck. We created innumerable chances but couldnt convert any of them, felt Mohun Bagan coach Jahar Das. 

Though he defended the foreigners role in the outcome (they need time to settle down), he pointed out that the likes of Gley Yao Rodrigue ? who was discarded by the clubs new dispensation soon after taking charge ? could come in handy in situations like Saturdays. 

The positive thing about Rodrigue was that he had the habit of scoring goals. Had he been here today, we could have won the match hands down, Das told a press conference. 

Putting Coffi and Ibrahims performances in the perspective, his craving for Rodrigues presence was quite understandable. 

Coffi failed to hit the target with the goalkeeper Gopal Das (who was later adjudged Man of the Match) at least twice, before Jerry Zirsangha substituted him after the break. His partner Ibrahim may be struggling with his fitness, but in his quick release of the ball and turns, roving movement and tenacity of playing with a marker was a promising sight. 

However, Ibrahim ? a recruit from Bangaldeshs Abahani KC ? prised open the rival defence in as early as the third minute of the match. Having received a through from Tomba Singh, captain Mehtab Hussain floated one for Ibrahim inside the box. The latter deftly controlled it in the air, steering clear of his marker Madhab Das challenge, but shot wide off the target from close. It was just the prelude to many more missed opportunities as the match wore on. 

Patrick, however, cashed in on the few that came Mohammedan Sportings way. Mehrajuddin Wadaos nasty foul on him gave his team a free-kick, almost 30 yards from the goal. But Palash Karmakars shot was breathtaking and on target, even a full-stretched Subrata Paul could not stop it. The ball hit the inside edge of the horizontal and Patrick pounced on the rebound with the Mohun Bagan backline failing to realise the immediacy of clearing the danger. 

In the second half, Das threw both Jerry and Dipendu Biswas upfront in search of the goal, but it remained elusive for ever.

 Allrounders crucial now: Mongia 

Chandigarh: Left-hander Dinesh Mongia, who has made a comeback to the Indian side for the upcoming tri-series in Sri Lanka, has said that allrounders now have a crucial role to play in a teams performance. 

I had said this two-three years back that role of allrounders will be important. Now, I feel that time has come, Mongia said. 

The Punjab left-hander, who last played for India in April 2005, was of the view that modern cricket was about being a contributor in all three departments of the game. 

Your batting, bowling and fielding count, Mongia, who was playing for English County side Leicestershire when he was named in the Indian squad, said. 

On the forthcoming tri-series, Mongia said that he would put in his best effort, but added that he will approach each game as it comes.

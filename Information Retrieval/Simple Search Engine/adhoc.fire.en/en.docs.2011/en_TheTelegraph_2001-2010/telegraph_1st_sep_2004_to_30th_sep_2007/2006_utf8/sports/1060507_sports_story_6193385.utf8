 There is too much cricket, says Sehwag 

 - If a bowler can appeal, why cant a batsman?

New Delhi: Virender Sehwag is fearing burn-out from too much cricket. Top cricketers have already told the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) to reduce the number of matches. 

There is too much cricket... Players need a break because they (may) burn-out from cricket. They need time for fitness too, time to think about their game and to recharge their batteries... If we want to win the World Cup, we need every player to be fit, Sehwag said in an interview. 

Captain Rahul Dravid and other senior players, including him, had taken up the matter with the Board which had pleaded inability to do anything about it immediately since the current calendar had been fixed long ago, he said. 

However, the Board was understanding and promised to give the players adequate breaks after the commitments already fixed were fulfilled, he said. 

How much rest do the players ideally need? I think after every series a player should get 20 to 25 days rest. If a player gets three to four months break in a year, it is good for players and good for the BCCI also. 

His recent poor form, which saw him average just 15 runs in last 9 Test innings and 31 in his last 15 ODIs, is seen by Sehwag as something that happens to international cricketers. 

A slump suddenly comes into your life, and in some ways I was ready for that, he says, adding I was just praying to myself that this patch will go quickly, but that did not happen. 

After his 73 against Pakistan in Abu Dhabi in his last one-day innings, Sehwag declares with confidence, I am now pretty confident because I have learn lessons. He is grateful for the guidance he received from Sunil Gavaskar, Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid, coach Greg Chappell and others during the lean patch. 

Does he worry a lot about his batting or is his approach cavalier? Of course, I worry about my performance. But I also have so much confidence while I am batting. I just watch the ball and play my shots, he says. 

Is a well-directed short-pitched ball a chink in his armour as is being suggested by some bowlers? 

Sehwag dismisses the theory as rubbish saying, I have got about 3000 Test runs and 4000 ODI runs. If I had a problem like that I would have got out in that manner in every innings. 

In fact, he is of the view that he encounters problems on Indian wickets because they are not bouncy enough for a strokeplayer like him. If the wicket does not have bounce, it is very hard for strokeplayers who have to hang around there and get their runs by rotating the strike. 

His happiest cricketing moment was when he scored the triple Test century against Pakistan in Multan two years ago. 

And the saddest moment? That was when India lost to Pakistan in the Bangalore Test last year chasing over 300 and losing only one wicket in the first session. We lost that match in just one session after that, he says, shaking his head. 

Sehwag welcomed the move for wider use of technology in umpiring decisions. If a bowler can appeal for a decision, why cant a batsman appeal against it. It is fair to both, he said. (PTI)

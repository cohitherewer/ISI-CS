 Churchill earn Fifas wrath 

JAYDEEP BASU 

New Delhi: For the past few days, football circle is rife with rumours that Churchill Bothers could be the possible replacement for erring Fransa Club in the NFL. But then, according to AIFF sources, Churchill are in bigger trouble than Fransa as the Fifa has already pulled up the Goan club for duping a Nigerian footballer and not paying his salary. The national federation is in full know of things, but has done nothing except passing on the Fifa letter to Churchill. 

The only other club in India so far to have earned the wrath of the world body for such malpractices is Mohun Bagan. In the past few years, the club tried to deny foreign footballers like Abdulatif Seriki and George Ekka their salaries and on each occasion had to shell out the money after Fifa threatened with sanctions. 

The Dispute Resolution Chamber of Fifa, which met in Zurich on November 2 last, has not only directed Churchill to pay $4,800 to Nigerian footballer John Kingsley, but has also said that Indian club has made false and contradictory statements to cover up for their own faults. The Nigerian footballer had lodged a complain to Fifa against Churchill. 

Fifa said Churchill has to pay the amount of $4,800 to the player within 30 days, following notification of the present decision. In the event the money is not paid within the stated deadline, the present matter shall be submitted to Fifas disciplinary committee. 

Churchill Brothers, owned by former Goa Chief Minister Churchill Alemao, now a member of Parliament from Goa, however, has decided to appeal against the judgement. 

Fifa said that Kingsley had an employment contract with Churchill from November 15, 2003 to April 30, 2005 stipulating a monthly salary of $1,100. In June 2004, the contract was terminated prematurely. On October 12, 2004, Kingsley complained to Fifa against Churchill for not paying his salary. 

While Churchill alleged the player missed matches, skipped training session and did not comply with the clubs regulations, Fifa regretted that the club could not submit any document to prove their allegations. The Goan side wrote to Fifa saying they had already paid full amount to Kingsley. But the games world governing body said the club despite having been expressly requested, did not provide the original of the agreement.

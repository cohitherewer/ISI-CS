 Champions Trophy, FTP to top agenda

 - Anti-doping, anti-racism steps also to be discussed 

Dubai: The contentious Future Tours Programme (FTP) and venues for this years Champions Trophy will top the agenda of the two-day ICC executive board meeting beginning here on Monday. 

Issues related to anti-doping, anti-racism, pitch monitoring and playing conditions would also figure prominently during the meeting, which would be attended by representatives of all the Test-playing nations as well as the associate members. 

ICC president Ehsan Mani said it would be a particularly important meeting for the board. This meeting is an important opportunity for the directors from across our membership base to guide the direction of international cricket on a range of major issues, Mani said in a statement on Sunday. 

The board will consider a request from the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) to amend the venues for the ICC Champions Trophy in India. The proposal requests an increase in the number of tournament venues from three to four. The ICC board has previously indicated that should the BCCI seek to increase the number of venues, the extra costs would be borne by the BCCI. 

The change would require amendments to the schedule but the tournament duration would remain the same. 

The ICC is also expected to approve a new six-year FTP for the 10 full members. This six-year programme of reciprocal touring obligations would replace the current five-year programme. 

It would require all of the full member sides to play home and away series against each other within the six-year period. The draft FTP also provides opportunities for several series to take place on a more frequent basis including Australia vs England, Australia vs India, Australia vs South Africa, Australia vs West Indies, Bangladesh vs Zimbabwe, England vs India, England vs West Indies, India vs Pakistan, India vs South Africa and Pakistan vs South Africa. 

As with the present five-year FTP, tours would be required to contain a minimum of two Test matches and three ODIs. The board will review the adoption of an ICC anti-doping policy for all major ICC events. 

The proposed policy complies with the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) code and its implementation would formalise the ICCs commitment to drugs-free sport. 

If the board approves the policy, it will be passed to the ICC annual conference for final ratification in July. 

The board will also receive an independent report from Indias solicitor general Goolam Vahanvati into incidents of racist crowd behaviour in Australia. 

The board would also consider the proposal of the chief executives committee meeting in Dubai in February for introduction of a formal pitch-monitoring process. 

This process would include potential sanctions ranging from a formal warning to a fine or even suspension of international status for venues that produce substandard pitches. (PTI)

 Were young, but learn quickly

 - Indians are under a lot of pressure: Bravo 

Captain Brian Lara and the other three who complete the first four positions are the big guns, but allrounder Dwayne Bravo has emerged a key member of this West Indies team. On Tuesday afternoon, he interacted with the Media at the Royal Selangor Club. 

The following are excerpts 

I enjoy batting in such (as on Monday evening, against Australia) conditions as it brings the best out of me... I also like batting where I have enough time to play myself in... Im not the type to smash the ball around the park from the beginning I need to get some balls under my belt to get into rhythm... Some may say I struggled in the beginning, but Brian soaked in the pressure... 

The only way we couldve lost was through panicking... If you panic, you play shots which are uncalled for... So, when Carlton (Baugh) came in, I told him to just stay there and be positive... That way we would get the runs... We did. 

The Indians are under a lot of pressure, but theyre a good team... If they dont win (on Wednesday), I dont think theyll qualify for Sundays final... The more wins we have in the lead-up to the Champions Trophy and the World Cup the better... 

The win over Australia has given us confidence... We missed out in the first match, but learnt our lessons... Thats the good thing about this team... Were a young team, but learn quickly... We know how to come out of (tough) situations... Thats one of the things talked about over and over again at team meetings... Thats why we didnt panic yesterday...

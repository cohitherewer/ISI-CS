 Rain truncates days card 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: The RCTCs 

 monsoon track took a beating soon after 3.30 pm when it 

 failed to cope up with lashing rain on Wednesday.

 The afternoons card was, therefore, truncated after the running of the fourth race and horses, lined up at the start for the Schwarz-enegger Cup, the fifth race, were recalled in view of the slippery track conditions and for the safety of the jockeys.

 In fact, the going became tough for punters after trainer Robin Corners heavily backed Body And Soul delivered the goods in the opener. Less-fancied winners, including Wonnabee (M.Reuben up), thereafter, added to punters woes. Corner also saddled Awesum Attitude to victory.

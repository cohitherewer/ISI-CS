 New doubles rules wont serve purpose

OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Damm 

Chennai: The talking point after Leander Paes and Martin Damms first-round win late Monday night was the new rules the ATP has enforced, ostensibly to make doubles more attractive. And no prizes for guessing that neither the Indian nor the Czech support those changes. 

Damm, the senior partner in the new Indo-Czech team, explained why he was against the rule changes. The ATP wants more singles players to play doubles to draw more crowds, so they are shortening the duration of doubles matches. But we think even under the new system, top players wont take part in doubles. 

The world No. 10 or 12 could play a few more doubles events, but they wont draw more people. 

To increase attendance at doubles matches, you need guys like Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Andy Roddick to play regularly. Thats not going to happen, so the ATPs purpose wont be served, said the 34-year-old Damm. 

As per the new rules, which had been applied selectively in the second half of 2005, there will be no advantage at deuce, so whoever wins the point after 40-all takes the game. Then, the third set has been replaced by a first-to-10-points special tie-break. 

For someone who has been on the Tour for 15 years, its not easy to accept such sweeping reforms. 

I have been used to one system for so long, it will take me some time to adjust to such huge changes, said Damm. 

We have been trying to get the ATP to revert to the old system, but were not being heard. Even if they agree to talk with the players, I dont think theyre going to climb down from their stand in a hurry. We just have to accept the changes and keep on playing. 

Paes nodded in agreement as his partner was making a point. I would still understand the no-ad rule, but discarding the third set doesnt make sense. The 10-point tie-break is like a lottery. Itll be tough for the bigger teams if its one set all, the Indian added. 

Asked why he had chosen Paes as his partner, Damm said: I am honoured to play with Leander, hes been one of the best players of our time. Also, hes a great fighter and I am looking forward to a good season. 

Damm, it may be recalled, played with Mahesh Bhupathi for the latter half of the 2005 season but the partnership didnt click, primarily because both prefer playing on the left court.

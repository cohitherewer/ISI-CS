The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 No added pressure, says Jayawardene 

OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Ahmedabad: Mahela Jayawardene feels there is no added pressure going into Tuesdays match versus the South Africans. Every game is important to usThere is nothing special about tomorrows match. Bottomline is weve to win to qualify. 

The following is what the captains had to say at the media conference: 

 JAYAWARDENE: You 

 cant say the South Africans are vulnerable against 

 spin. It is easy to say this and that before going into 

 the contest, but match situations may be entirely different. 

 Honestly how one team performs on a given day, matters most. 

 However, having the experience of Muttiah Muralidharan and 

 Sanath Jayasuriya does make a difference. The emphasis 

 will be on the top four guys getting the runs. If any one 

 of them clicks, the others can build partnerships around 

 him. Im happy Upul Tharanga and other have been contributing 

 regularly. 

 GRAEME SMITH: 

 When you study teams, you work out their combinations, you 

 work out how they plan and Sri Lanka have always relied 

 on their slow bowlers through the middle overs. From 20 

 to 50 overs they rely a lot on taking the pace off the ball 

 and it has worked for them over the last few years. That 

 has been their strategy. Hopefully we can put a good combination 

 tomorrow that wins us the game. Our bowling combination 

 is being pretty settled over the last two years and we obviously 

 want to stick to our aggression Our batting is also good. 

The top seven or eight batsmen are one of the best in the world We got big-hitters at the bottom and got power strikers at the top. Its just about getting it right on the day, being able to adapt to the conditions tomorrow. I think, how the wicket plays will be the key to our success in tomorrows gamePersonally, I have developed a lot in the last three year after playing all around the world. I am much more calm and peace with the job. I enjoy the job thoroughly, I am blessed with good bunch of cricketers and that makes the job much easier.

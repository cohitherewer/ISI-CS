 Harbhajan: I was half-fit for 2nd Test

 - Pat on the back for offie Sehwag 

Basseterre: Harbhajan Singh has made light of the criticism about his omission from the first two Tests against the West Indies, saying his selection would not have guaranteed India victory and confirming that he was only half-fit for the second one. 

Former cricketers including Sunil Gavaskar and Michael Holding have written strongly about India ignoring Harbhajan when West Indies top-order was full of lefthanders and there was a crying need to play five regular bowlers. 

Harbhajan, however, brushed aside suggestions that he would have run through the West Indies batting on pitches that seem to suit his bowling. 

Ifs and buts are best left on the coffee table. Its how you do on the field which matters, said Harbhajan as he glossed over his exclusion. I actually was only half-fit for the second Test. Still it was a game in which we distinguished ourselves? But for rain we would have surely ended up as winners. 

Harbhajan said he fancied his chances after having a look at the wicket, though. 

The pitch certainly interested me. It was helping spinners like a few do back home. The top surface had crumbled pretty early in the match, remarked Harbhajan. 

Harbhajan loves being involved in the thick of action, so it was frustrating for him to sit in the dressing room. However, he still found a role for himself in helping Virender Sehwag bowl his off-spinners in a way which gave India a lethal edge in the middle. 

Even at under-19 level, Veeru had the ability to be a good spinner. The one thing I asked him to stick to was to bowl his off-spinners in an area on or outside the off-stump. 

Its difficult to hit that line. Fortunately for him, he consistently bowled a good line and length during the Test. 

He was keen to know how to bowl a floater, a delivery which holds its line and moves away slightly. He certainly is a quick learner for he nearly trapped Dwayne Bravo with such a delivery in the second Test. 

Meanwhile, Joey Carew, convenor of the West Indies selection panel, agrees that pitches in the Caribbean need to improve.

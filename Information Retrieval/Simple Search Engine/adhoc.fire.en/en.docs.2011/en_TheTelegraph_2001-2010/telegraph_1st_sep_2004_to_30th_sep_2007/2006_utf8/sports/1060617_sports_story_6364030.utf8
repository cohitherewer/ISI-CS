 Ronaldo will bounce back: Ronaldinho

Koenigstein: Brazil playmaker Ronaldinho was confident that troubled teammate Ronaldo would bounce back to form in Sundays Group F match against Australia in Munich. 

I think Ronaldo is a player who has a lot of quality and the trust of all his teammates, Ronaldinho said on Friday. 

We have a lot of confidence that in the next match he will be able to do everything that he is capable of to help Brazil collect another win. 

Ronaldo ? who won the World Player of the Year award in 1996, 1997 and 2002, was jeered when he was substituted in the 69th minute in Tuesdays 1-0 win over Croatia after a lumbering performance in which he looked short of match fitness. (REUTERS)

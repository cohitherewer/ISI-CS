The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Mohun Bagan players to stay in hotel tomorrow 

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: In view of the two-day bandh in the state, the AIFF will provide hotel accommodation for Mohun Bagan for their Federation Cup-opener against Viva Kerala on Thursday. 

AIFF doesnt bear lodging expenses for any home team, but keeping in mind extraordinary circumstances, the federation has agreed to change the rule. 

Meanwhile, East Bengal coach Carlos Roberto Pereira is planning to field Izumi Arata as lone striker in a 4-5-1 formation against SBT on Wednesday. Syed Rahim Nabi will play the withdrawn forwards role.

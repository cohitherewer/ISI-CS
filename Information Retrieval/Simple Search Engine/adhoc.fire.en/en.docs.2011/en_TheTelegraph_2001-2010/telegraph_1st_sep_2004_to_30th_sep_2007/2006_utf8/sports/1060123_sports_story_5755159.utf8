 Baghdatis floors Roddick

Melbourne: Second seed Andy Roddick suffered a shock defeat on Sunday to a flamboyant Cypriot who is developing a cult following at the Australian Open. 

Marcos Baghdatis scored the biggest win of his career with a 6-4, 1-6, 6-3, 6-4 upset in the fourth round that sparked wild celebrations among fans from Melbournes Greek community who have adopted Baghdatis as one of their own. 

The top womens seeds all advanced safely although world No. 1 Lindsay Davenport survived an injury scare before limping to a 6-2, 6-4 win over Russias Svetlana Kuznetsova. 

Fourth seed Maria Sharapova defeated Slovakias Daniela Hantuchova 6-4, 6-4 on a brutally hot court to set up an all-Russian quarter final with Nadia Petrova. 

Baghdatis is now through to his first Grand Slam quarter final and growing in confidence. He plays seventh seed Ivan Ljubicic after the Croatian toppled Swedens former Open champion Thomas Johansson 6-2, 6-4, 6-4. 

Roddicks defeat leaves Argentinas Masters Cup champion David Nalbandian as the highest-ranked player in the bottom half of the mens singles draw. 

The fourth seed reached the quarter finals with a 6-3, 6-0, 2-6, 6-2 victory over Spains Tommy Robredo. 

He plays Fabrice Santoro after the Frenchman beat Spanish baseliner David Ferrer 6-4, 7-5, 7-5 to reach his first Grand Slam quarter-final. 

Eighth seed Justine Henin-Hardenne beat Virginia Ruano Pascual 6-0, 6-3. She will play Davenport for a place in the semi-finals. (Reuters)

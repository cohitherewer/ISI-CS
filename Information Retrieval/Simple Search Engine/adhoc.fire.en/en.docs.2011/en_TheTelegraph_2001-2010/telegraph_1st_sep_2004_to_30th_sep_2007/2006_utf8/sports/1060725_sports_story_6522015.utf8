 Hayden claims 2nd straight title 

Los Angeles: American Nicky Hayden boosted his MotoGP championship hopes with a second straight US Grand Prix win on Sunday, while Valentino Rossis bid for a sixth 500cc crown suffered a punishing blow. 

Hayden, who claimed his maiden career win on the undulating Laguna Seca circuit last year, stalked pole sitter Chris Vermeulen through the early stages of the race until passing the Australian on lap 17, then charging home 3.18 seconds ahead of Honda team mate Dani Pedrosa of Spain. 

Italys Marco Melandri, racing with a broken collar bone, was third, also on a Honda. 

Five-time 500cc champion Rossi started well back from 10th position after another disappointing qualifying effort, but was quickly on the charge working his way up to sixth midway through the 32-lap race. 

But with three laps remaining, disaster struck as blue smoke began pouring out of the back of the Italians Yamaha leaving him on the sidelines and out of the points. 

Haydens second victory of the season gives the American 194 points and a 34-point lead over Pedrosa with six races remaining. 

Rossi, who had arrived in California trailing Hayden by 26 points, slips to fourth in the standings with 143 points. 

I didnt know I had it today, Hayden said. I was so nervous before the race leading the points.

 Cole now worth ?25m, say Arsenal

THE TIMES, LONDON

Arsenal have run the risk of antagonising Ashley Cole even further by rejecting a ?16 million bid from Chelsea for the England defender. After months of speculation over Coles future, the clubs have finally entered into negotiations, with Arsenal turning down the opening offer but indicating that they would do business if the fee reached ?25 million. 

Chelsea are confident of getting their man, with Arsenals stance most likely to infuriate the player. Arsenals valuation may surprise and annoy Cole, who shook hands on a agreement that he could leave for ?15 million this summer before signing a contract extension 12 months ago. 

Given that Cole fell out with the club he supported as a boy over their failure to meet his wage demands, he may even notice a certain irony in such a sudden inflation in his valuation. Arsenal are publicly committed to keeping Cole, 25, but they have privately accepted the inevitability of his departure, given the strained nature of his relationship with David Dein, the vice-chairman, and Arsene Wenger, the manager. 

 Arsenal cannot hope to get more than ?20 million for a defender, even from a club of Chelseas resources. Cole is considered to be the final piece in the jigsaw after another hugely expensive summer of rebuilding at Stamford Bridge.

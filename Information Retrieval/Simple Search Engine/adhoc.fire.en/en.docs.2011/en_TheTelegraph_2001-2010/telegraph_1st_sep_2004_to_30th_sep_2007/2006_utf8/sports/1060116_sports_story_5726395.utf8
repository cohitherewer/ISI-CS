London: Chelsea survived an early scare and the dismissal of winger Arjen Robben to beat bottom side Sunderland 2-1 and stretch their Premier League lead to 16 points on Sunday. 

Sunderland took a shock lead through Liam Lawrence after 12 minutes with Hernan Crespo replying for the misfiring champions in the 28th. Chelsea got their reward in the 69th minute with a deflected Robben shot. 

Meanwhile, Alessandro Del Piero maintained his record-breaking form when he struck the winner in Juventuss laboured 1-0 win over Reggina in Serie A on Sunday. 

The striker hit a hattrick in midweek against Italian Cup rivals Fiorentina to become the clubs all-time top scorer.

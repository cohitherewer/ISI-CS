Cape Town: Paceman Stuart Clark took five wickets for 55 runs on his debut to snatch the advantage for Australia on the first day of the first Test against South Africa on Thursday. 

Clark and Brett Lee dismissed South Africa for 205 after the hosts chose to bat. 

In reply, Australia were 63 for one at close. Matthew Hayden was batting on 22 and Ricky Ponting on 20. 

Clark maintained a disciplined line and length and made good use of the responsive pitch. Tearaway Lee offered Clark steady support and took three for 37. 

Clark first struck when he angled a delivery across the left-handed Graeme Smith, who pushed forward tentatively and edged a catch to keeper Adam Gilchrist to be dismissed for 19. 

Jacques Kallis, who scored six, became Clarks second victim when he cut at a short delivery and was caught by Hayden in the gully. 

Nine balls before lunch Herschelle Gibbs drove down the wrong line to Clark and was bowled for 18 as South Africa stumbled to 61 for four. 

Jacques Rudolph was out eight balls after lunch when he steered a Kasprowicz delivery to first slip, where Shane Warne juggled the ball and kicked it upward as he fell backward. 

Gilchrist was on hand to complete the catch. 

Clark had Mark Boucher well caught by a diving Gilchrist for 16 as South Africa lurched to 104 for six in the ninth over after lunch. 

Ashwell Prince stood firm for 105 minutes and 67 balls for his 17 before he edged Lee to Hayden in the gully. 

Hayden took his 100th Test catch when he dived forward to hold a low chance offered by Andrew Hall, who scored 24, off Lee in the third over before tea. Nicky Boje hit five fours in his aggressive 31 before being trapped in front by Clark. 

Andre Nel and Makhaya Ntini shared 32 off 37 balls in a bright last-wicket stand, the biggest of the innings.

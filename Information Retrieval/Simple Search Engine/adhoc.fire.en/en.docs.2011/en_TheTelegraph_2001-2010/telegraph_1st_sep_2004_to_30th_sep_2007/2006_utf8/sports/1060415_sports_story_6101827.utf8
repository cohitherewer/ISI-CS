Calcutta: A below par performance notwithstanding, Mohun Bagan beat Air India 2-1 in the 10th National Football League match for the ONGC Cup at the Salt Lake Stadium on Friday. 

The Brazilian defender Eduardo Coelho headed in the winning goal in the 75th minute. The city giants drew the first blood in the 12th minute through Mehtab Hussain and it was neutralised by Napoleon Singh when he converted a penalty kick four minutes before the Brazilians winner. 

However, the win ? which followed a 1-3 defeat to arch-rivals East Bengal on Saturday last ? leaves a lot of things to be desired. 

Chances continued to be squandered and adding further woes to the coach Biswajit Bhattacharya, there was hardly a creative move worth mentioning. 

It was a much-needed win but I am not impressed by the way we played today, said Bhattacharya at the post-match press conference. 

Today we missed five of our regular players due to injuries and card problems and I was left with a set of new boys with whom I have to still work hard, the coach pointed out. 

Bhattacharya further reiterated that the absence of a genuine striker is still a worry. 

Mohun Bagan now have 20 points from 13 matches and can still hope to finish the league up the order. Air India ? who have provided excitement to the title-race by beating Mahindra United in the last match ? are with 13 points from as many matches. 

The sense of urgency was clearly visible in the green and maroon brigade as they enjoyed more ball possession and the first chance came in their way in the ninth minute. After being fed by a Mehtab cross in the box, Chinmoy Sarkar shot it way outside the left bar. In the very next minute Manjit Singh squandered another easy chance. 

It was Mehtab again whose powerful right-footer gave Mohun Bagan the lead, the move being set up by a back-pass from Awudu Ibrahim, off the edge of the box. 

Thirty minutes into the game, an unmarked Coffi flew into the box from the right flank and gave a square pass to Ibrahim. The latter failed to control his speed and overstepped to mess up the chance with the goalie at his mercy. 

The only clear chance that came the Mumbai outfits way was took place 10 minutes before the lemon break, when striker Bashiru Abbas had only Subrata Pal to beat but the shot was way off the target. 

It was Subrata, who was eventually responsible for Air Indias equaliser in the 71st minute. The goalkeeper committed a tough tackle on Bashiru Abbas and the Sikkimese referee Chamchuk Lama promptly pointed to the spot-kick. Napoleon didnt make any mistake. 

Mohun Bagan also stepped on the gas with Eduardo moving up from the backline. Within four minutes, he delivered the goods, nodding home off a Coffi free-kick from just outside the left side of the box.

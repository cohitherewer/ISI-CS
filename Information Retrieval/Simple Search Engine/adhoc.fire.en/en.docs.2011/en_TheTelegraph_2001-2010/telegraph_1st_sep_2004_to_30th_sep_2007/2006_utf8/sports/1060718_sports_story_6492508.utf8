 More made me a better keeper: Dhoni

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: Dashing wicket-keeper batsman Mahendra Singh Dhoni said on Monday that chief selector Kiran More has contributed heavily in making him a better stumper. 

More has played a crucial role in my development as a keeper, said Dhoni, while talking to reporters on the sidelines of a promotional event in Noida on Monday. 

On BCCIs decision to introduce the Twenty20 format in domestic cricket, Dhoni felt the game is here to stay. 

Twenty20 cricket no doubt is highly entertaining for the spectators. Of late, however, I feel it is turning out to be quite an important event, he said. 

After all, this is one form of the game where you get to hit more fours and sixes and spectators do enjoy such entertainment. 

Dhoni had recently taken part in a Twenty20 game along with Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid at The Oval. Asked about Sachin, Dhoni said he appeared fully fit. 

As far as Sachins fitness is concerned, he was hundred per cent okay. He was simply fabulous, to say the least.

 Real chiefs warning

Madrid: Real Madrids new president Fernando Martin issued a stern warning to his players on Thursday that those not committed to the cause would be unwelcome at the club. 

I dont want a team of millionaires. I want a team of marvellous sportsmen who work 24 hours a day to achieve the best for our fans, Martin told a news conference. Those players who think they can stay here giving only the minimum amount of effort are wrong. Those who fight and sweat for the shirt know they will have mine and the clubs full support. 

I am not afraid to take tough decisions if people dont give their all for Real Madrid. 

Martins predecessor Florentino Perez resigned after six years at the helm on Monday, saying one of the reasons for his disillusionment was the lack of commitment shown by some players. 

The Spanish press has, in particular, called into question the attitude of Brazil striker Ronaldo after he criticised fans last week. 

Since then both Sergio Ramos and Raul have hinted that unity within the team is not as strong as it should be. 

I will set up an independent commission to evaluate the effort of each of the players, and their sporting and personal conduct, he added. 

Martins tough stance is bound to win favour with the clubs fans. (Reuters)

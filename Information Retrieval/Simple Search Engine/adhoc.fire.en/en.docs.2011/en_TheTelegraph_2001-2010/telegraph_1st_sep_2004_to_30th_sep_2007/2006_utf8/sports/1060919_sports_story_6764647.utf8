The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Pontings personal apology to 

 Rauf

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 CONDUCT IN OPENER

 Kuala Lumpur: Australian 

 captain Ricky Ponting has kept his word and apologised to 

 umpire Asad Rauf for his conduct in the tri-series opener 

 against the West Indies, last Tuesday. Pontings uncaptain-like 

 act made him lose his match fee.

 After being punished by Match 

 Referee Chris Broad, Ponting issued an unprecedented public 

 apology wherein hed stated: ...Ill be 

 personally apologising to umpire Rauf at the first opportunity...

 That opportunity surfaced 

 at the official hotel (Traders) on Sunday morning and Ponting, 

 according to The Telegraphs sources, asked 

 the Pakistani umpire for five minutes. Rauf 

 obliged.

 Ponting apologised profusely for 

 questioning his decision to call a wide from Shane Watson 

 and promised not to do a repeat. Actually, he cant 

 afford to, for a similar Code of Conduct breach in the next 

 12 months is going to invite a ban.

 I hope you havent 

 kept the incident in your mind, is what Ponting is 

 supposed to have said. Rauf, its learnt, responded 

 with: I dont carry anything of the game outside 

 the boundary... For me, what happens on the field, gets 

 over there itself...

 Rauf, it seems, advised 

 Ponting that such behaviour set a poor example 

 for the youngsters in his team. Also, that it didnt 

 do him any good. Ponting, one understands, agreed with what 

 Rauf had to say.

 Real Excellence a cinch 

 SRIMAX

 Mysore: Robert Foley-trained Real Excellence is the one to beat in the 2,000m Poonawalla Mysore Derby, the main event of the season here on Sunday. The Steinbeck-Allaire thee-year-old filly who has been in rousing form is taking on a modest set and she should run as a piping hot favourite. B. Prakash partners the filly.

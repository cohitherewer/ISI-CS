 Fransa asked to show cause 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: The All India Football Federation (AIFF) started an exercise in futility when they served Fransa Pax Football Club a show cause notice nearly three weeks after the Goan club decided to disband their club. 

In a notice served to Fransa, the AIFF has asked for an explanation as to why action should not be taken against the club and officials for their non-co-operation and withdrawal from the National Football League. 

In the letter, the federation has also asked Fransa to reply to the notice by April 25, failing which the matter will be forwarded to the Disciplinary Committee of the AIFF, and NFL, for necessary action, without any further reference to the Betalbatim-based club. 

The teams sudden withdrawal from the ONGC Cup is in violation of the NFL guidelines, and other regulations of the AIFF and AFC, AIFF general secretary Alberto Colaco said in the show-cause notice. The AIFF letter has also expressed wonder as to why Fransa had refused to answer or acknowledge all correspondence from the AIFF so far. 

While the letter did not specify what action would be taken against Fransa, according to article X(2) of NFL Manual, teams withdrawing after the competition has started shall forfeit the participating fee (Rs 2.5 lakh) and shall also be fined Rs 10 lakh. 

Conceding that little action could be taken a team which has already seized to exist, an AIFF member said: No action was taken against Fransa when they threatened the match commissioner last season. 

No action was taken against the Goan club when their cheque for NFL participation fee bounced. Their players went scot-free after manhandling the referee. Now, what is the point of making a farce of threatening them with disciplinary actions? Its nothing but a part of planned eyewash.

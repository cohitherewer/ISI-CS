The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 India can move up to third spot 

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: India can put their poor one-day form behind them this week and concentrate on moving up the LG ICC Test Championship ladder when the three-match series against South Africa begins on Friday. 

Should Rahul Dravids men register a series win over the Proteas by one Test they will instantly draw level with arch-rivals Pakistan in third place on 112 ratings points, according to a ICC release. 

And if India win the series 2-0 or 3-0, they will leap-frog Pakistan and then have second-placed England in their sights. A drawn or lost series, however, will see them lose ratings points and slip away from Inzamam-ul Haqs side where they could get caught by the chasing Sri Lankans.

 Saina bows out

New Delhi: Indian teenager Saina Nehwal failed to weave her Philippines Open magic and bowed out of the six-star Indonesia Open Badminton Championship in Surabaya after losing in the qualifying rounds. 

According to information received here, the 16-year-old Saina, who became the first Indian and the youngest Asian to win a four-star event on Sunday, went down fighting 17-21, 21-23 in her second qualifying match to Yuan Kartika of Indonesia. 

Saina got a walkover in the first qualifying match against Fiona McKee of Canada before going down in the second round. (PTI)

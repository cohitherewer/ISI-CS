 England can reach final: Pele 

 - Team strong enough even without Rooney 

 WILLIAM GRAY

 Pele at the launch of his autobiography in Manchester on Friday 

Pele believes England can overcome the loss of Wayne Rooney and reach the final of this summers World Cup. The Brazilian, a three-time winner, regards his native country as favourites but has been impressed by Englands progress in recent years. 

He sees Rooney as Sven-Goran Erikssons most dangerous weapon but feels that the team is strong enough to cope without him. 

Rooney, 20, is still likely to travel with the squad but he will miss at least the group fixtures after breaking a metatarsal. Pele said: I think, in the last four years, theres no doubt England have improved a lot... and have a good chance to get to the final, no doubt. 

Unfortunately for England, they have a problem with Rooney having broken his foot. England dont have anyone at the same level at the moment. This is a big problem, but even without him I think England are a very strong team for this World Cup. 

Pele is in Britain to promote his autobiography. 

Pele does not feel there is a direct comparison between himself and Theo Walcott. 

He said: Nobody has seen him play, even his teammates havent played a game with him. It was different for me, because when I was 16 I played in a tournament against Argentina, so when I was at the World Cup I had played several games. 

Its very difficult to say whats going to happen because Walcott doesnt have the experience.

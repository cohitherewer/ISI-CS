 Negi on threshold of history

Hastings: Parimarjan Negi moved within striking distance of his maiden Grandmaster norm with a thumping victory over Bogdan Lalic of Croatia in the eighth round of Hastings International Chess Congress underway here. 

With his third victory in the event against a Grandmaster, Negi took his tally to 5.5 points out of a possible 8 and now just needs a draw against GM Yuriy Kuzubov of Ukraine in the next round to become the youngest- ever GM norm holder of the country. 

Earlier in the event, Negi had become the youngest International Master of the country. 

Third seed GM Valerij Neverov of Ukraine defeated Milos Pavlovic of Russia. Neverov now shares the lead with Israeli GM Sergey Erenburg on 6.5 points. Negi is tied 8th.

 Jeev paired with Woods

Shanghai: Jeev Milkha Singh carries his brilliant form into what will be his biggest event in Asia this year as he tees off against the worlds best like Tiger Woods and defending champion David Howell at the star-studded HSBC Champions starting on Thursday. 

Jeev will play the first two rounds with Tiger. 

The Indian ace leads the UBS Asian Tour Order of Merit, won the Volvo Masters of Europe and came within a whisker of notching back-to-back wins, but finished second in a Japan Tour event last week. 

Playing with Tiger is always an honour and I will enjoy it, said Jeev. I know I am in good form and am striking the ball well. The Japan finish was a disappointment after having been so close. I missed a short three-foot putt on 17th and then a four-footer on 18th for a three-put and lost by one. 

Jeev, who began the year at 376 in world rankings has climbed more than 300 spots and is now 73rd. 

 My first and foremost goal is to get into the top-50 of the world rankings. That will get me into the majors. Then I want to contend at the bigger events like the WGC and (US) Masters, he said. 

I have had a long season, but will now take a rest towards the end as I have some big events coming up including UBS Hong Kong and Volvo Masters of Asia. But first the aim is the HSBC Champions this week. 

Also in the field are Shiv Kapur, winner of the Volvo Masters of Asia 2005, Gaurav Ghei, winner of the Mercuries Masters 2006 and Jyoti Randhawa, winner of the Hero Honda Indian Open. The elite event is open to winners of events on eligible tours and the top-50 of the world plus some invited players. 

Thai teenage prodigy Chinarat Phadungsil hopes to mark his first anniversary as a professional with a strong outing. Chinarat has fond memories of the HSBC Champions as it was here that he made his debut last year, finishing 57th. 

Other top Asian Tour players in the field include Chinas Liang Wen-Chong and Lian-Wei, Singapores Mardan Mamat and Thailands Prom Meesawat. (PTI)

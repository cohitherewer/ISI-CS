 Beckham: My life is at Real

Madrid: Former England captain David Beckham said on Monday he wanted to stay at Real Madrid, contradicting persistent press reports linking him with a move to a British club or the American League. My future is here, my life is here, Beckham said at a news conference. Im not going to be talking to any teams Im not going anywhere in January. 

Beckham has been linked with Premier League Tottenham Hotspur, Scottish champions Celtic and a move to Major League Soccer (MLS) in the US. 

Beckham said talks about renewing his contract are continuing after they were held up due to the change of chairman and coach at Real Madrid during the close season. The contract talks have been ongoing, the former England captain said. They started up again two or three weeks ago and there will be another meeting in the next week. 

Beckham denied that Real Madrid president Ramon Calderon is trying to cut his wages as part of a new contract. Thats a hypothetical question because that hasnt happened to me, Beckham said. (Reuters)

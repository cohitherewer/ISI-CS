 Atwal finishes joint 77th

Harrison: Arjun Atwal posted his worst card of the week ? a nine-over 80 ? to finish a poor tied-77th while Fijis Vijai Singh celebrated his maiden win of the season in the Barclays Classic at the Westchester Country Club on Sunday. 

The Fijian held off the challenge of Australias Adam Scott to become the first three-time winner of this 40-year-old event, and only the second player, after Jack Nicklaus, to win three titles on this course. 

For Atwal, it went horribly wrong from the start when he doubled-bogeyed the first and second holes. Bogeys at the third, fifth, eighth and ninth saw him make the turn at eight-over. 

Atwals lone birdie of the day, on the 10th, hinted at a recovery which, however, never came. Further dropped shots on 12 and 17 completed a miserable day. The Indian had earlier shot 72, 71 and 73. 

Vijai Singh had not won since the Buick Open in July 2005, a winless streak of 21 tournaments.

 Anti-racism rules will apply at Cup: Blatter

 Sepp Blatter

London: Teams playing at the World Cup will be subject to Fifas new anti-racism rules, which include three-point deductions for racist behaviour by fans. 

Fifa will begin punishing club teams next season for racist conduct, but Fifa president Sepp Blatter said on Tuesday that national teams at the June 9-July 9 World Cup will play under the rules, which were approved last month. 

The rules officially came into force April 4, but Blatter said they could not be applied to domestic competitions midway through the season. There was no such obstacle to them being used at the World Cup, however. 

The regulations will also be applied for this World Cup, Blatter told a Britains TV channel. At the first sign (of racism) there will be a deduction of three points, then we are finished with the problems of discrimination. 

The measures for domestic leagues include a reduction of three points from a team for a first offence, six for a second and relegation for a third offence. Fines can also be give to fans or officials for any act or expression of a discriminatory and/or contemptuous nature. 

While stadium bans and match suspensions will also be considered, Blatter said he wanted extra powers to intervene if Fifa felt a country wasnt adhering to the rules. Fifa meets June 7-9 in Munich. 

We go now to the congress in 45-50 days and then it will be by decision of the congress... To give Fifa the authority to intervene in case of non-application, he said. 

Blatter said he was also concerned that players and fans could twist the rules to punish rival teams. 

He used the example of Messinas Ivory Coast defender Marc Zoro who, in November, threatened to walk off the field after being reduced to tears by racist slurs from fans. Blatter said the slurs may have come from rival fans who wanted Inter to be deducted points. 

Blatter was abrupt when asked about reports that 60,000 women from eastern Europe would be trafficked into Germany for use in prostitution during the World Cup. 

Listen lady, what can we do? he told the female anchor. We are Fifa, we are not responsible for the morality and the ethics of the whole population of the world. 

We should go against gambling, we should go against drugs, we should go against religion, we should go against weapons and so on. This is not our duty, our duty is football.

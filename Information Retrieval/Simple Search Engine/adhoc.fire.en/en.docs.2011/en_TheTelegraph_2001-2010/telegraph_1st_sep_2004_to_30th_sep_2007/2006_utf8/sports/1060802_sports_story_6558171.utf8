 Mario Ancic confirms 

Mumbai: World No. 8 Mario Ancic of Croatia has confirmed his participation in the $380,000 ATP Tour event to be held at the newly laid synthetic tennis courts of the Cricket Club of India in September. 

Mario Ancic has confirmed his participation already and we are talking to a couple of more top players. But things would be clearer when the deadline for sending in entries (six weeks before its commencement) approaches, tournament director Gaurav Natekar said on Tuesday. 

The tournament commences on September 25.

 CA to look into incident

- I was not insulted or embarrassed, says Pawar 

 Sharad Pawar

Melbourne/New Delhi: Cricket Australia on Tuesday promised to look into the nudging of Sharad Pawar by its players whose conduct was deplored by Sunil Gavaskar who disclosed that the BCCI president was addressed as hiya buddy by one of the team members. 

Cricket Australia said it would go through the footage of the incident to find out what happened exactly during the presentation ceremony of the Champions Trophy in Mumbai on Sunday night. 

The players have only just arrived back in Australia and over the course of the next few days we will be finding out what, if anything, did or did not happen, CA spokesman Peter Young said. 

Young said the players were understandably very thrilled to have won the tournament for the first time but stopped short of citing it as an excuse. 

I do know the Australian players were very excited to win the trophy. It is a bit of a holy grail because it was the only trophy in world cricket they had not won, he was quoted as saying. 

Although Pawar himself sought to downplay the incident, it continued to evoke strong criticism from former cricketers and politicians. 

Pawar, also the Union agriculture minister, said the issue was being blown out of proportion. I do not think it is an issue. I was not insulted or embarrassed, Pawar said. 

It is true that all the Australian players had crowded the stage and that I felt a jolt, but that was not intentional. I have seen the footage myself. I feel such a small issue should not be hyped this much, Pawar said. 

Gavaskar, however, added new twist to the controversy by disclosing that one of the players had addressed Pawar as hiya buddy. 

I am not amused by one of the Australian players who said hiya buddy when he went up to receive his medallion from Mr Pawar, said the legendary batsman who was also present on the stage. 

Just receive it quietly. You are not in your country. In India, we respect our elders. Certain decorum has to be maintained, you have to show respect. Would they have done such a thing to their Prime Minister? he was quoted as saying in a Mumbai eveninger. 

Australia waited all these years to win the Champions Trophy. Surely, they could have waited for Mr Pawar to be escorted by the lady from the ICC rather than nudge him away. 

Former India captain Mohammed Azharuddin also slammed the Australian team, terming its behaviour uncivilised. 

No guest would abuse the hospitality in the manner the Australians did the other night at the end of the Champions Trophy. It should completely embarrass the Australian cricket public and their board, he said. 

Meanwhile, the BCCI has said it will not lodge an official protest with CA in this issue.

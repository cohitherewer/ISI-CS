 Blatter tears into referee

Berlin: The record stream of yellow and red cards in the World Cup has soccers highest official issuing his own caution ? to the referees. 

Fifa president Sepp Blatter criticised Valentin Ivanovs handling of Portugals 1-0 second-round win over The Netherlands, when the Russian referee handed out a record-tying 16 yellow cards and an unprecedented four reds. 

Blatter told a TV channel that Ivanov was not up to the level of the players. I think there should have been a yellow card for the referee, he said. 

With 12 games to play, the four red cards shown in Sundays match brought the tournament total to 23 in 52 matches ? one more than in the entire 64 matches at the 1998 World Cup in France. The 16 yellow cards shown took that total to 291, beating the previous record of 272 shown in the whole of the last competition in Japan and South Korea. 

Ivanov attempted to establish his control from the start when he cautioned two Dutchmen in the opening seven minutes. But instead of gaining command of the game, he sent the contest into a spiral of chaos. 

This was a game of emotion, with exceptional drama in the last instant, with a deserved winner, Blatter said. But it was a great show with intervention by the referee that was not consistent, and lackedfair play. 

I must say it was a pity that there was no football in the second half, said Dutch coach Marco van Basten. The referee made a mess of it... It was chaos and it should not happen this way at a World Cup. 

Meanwhile, Portugal intend to appeal the red card handed to Deco on Sunday, coach Luiz Felipe Scolari said on Monday. The Portuguese Football Federation will put in a request to overturn the card for Deco. (AGENCIES)

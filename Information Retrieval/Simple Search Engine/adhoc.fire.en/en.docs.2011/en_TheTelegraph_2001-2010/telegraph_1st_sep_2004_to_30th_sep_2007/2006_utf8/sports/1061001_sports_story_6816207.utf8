The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Crucial Challenger for India hopefuls

 - India Blue open versus India Red at the Chepauk today 

A CORRESPONDENT

 Sourav Ganguly 

Chennai: The Challenger Trophy gets underway at the Chepauk on Sunday with India Blue taking on India Red in the opener. 

The focus is obviously going to be on the comeback bid by a host of cricketers namely Sourav Ganguly, V.V.S. Laxman, Ashish Nehra, Zaheer Khan and Lakshmipathy Balaji. 

As the Indian squad for the next engagement the Champions Trophy has already been picked, none of them can expect any immediate reward. 

As already decided, Sachin Tendulkar will not play on Sunday as he has sought rest. He however, joined his teammates in the evening. 

Still, to impress the selection committee (headed by Dilip Vengsarkar), the Souravs have to consistently make headlines during the four-day tournament. 

Vengsarkar has already made it clear that form and fitness will be the criterion for any player looking for a berth in the national side. I wouldnt like to talk of individuals, but players will be picked on merit. 

For me, form and fitness alone are going to matter. Anybody who is playing domestic cricket and meets the requirements Ive listed will be eligible for selection, the chief selector said. 

If youre looking to make a comeback or eager for a break, then perform big and stay fit 

 Vengsarkar, who was in Calcutta for much of Friday, left for hometown Mumbai on Saturday and is expected to reach here some hours before the start of the tournament. 

Players of all three teams practised on Saturday. Sourav, who arrived in the morning, also sweated it out with his India Green teammates in the afternoon. 

India Green coach Lalchand Rajput feels the tournament would be crucial for Sourav. The tournament will help players like Sourav and Sreesanth. 

Asked if he thought Sourav still had a chance to make a comeback, Rajput said: I can see the fire in his belly. 

The new selection panel has said that they have an open mind and they will pick players on the basis of their performances. Therefore, I believe, the Challenger Trophy is a crucial one 

Sourav, it may be recalled, missed last years Challenger Trophy because of tennis elbow symptoms and that actually set in motion the chain of events that lead to his ouster from the one-day team. 

Attention is also going to be on the likes of Virender Sehwag, Mohammed Kaif and Yuvraj Singh, who have hardly done anything of note in recent weeks. 

Also wanting to stand out in a crowd would be youngsters like Sourashish Lahiri, Ravindra Jadeja, Praveen Kumar, C. Raghu, Rohit Sharma and Tanmay Srivastava.

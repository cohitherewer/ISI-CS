 Dismal start by India

 - Steyns blistering pace knocks out visitors 

 Rahul Dravid 

Benoni: India had a nightmarish start to their tour of South Africa as they suffered a stinging 37-run loss in the one-day warm-up game on Thursday (briefly reported in Fridays Late City edition). 

Indias bowling and batting came apart at the seams in spectacular fashion against South Africa A a bunch from whom only a couple have a realistic chance of playing in the World Cup at the Willowmoore Park. 

After allowing the hosts to get off the hook and post a challenging 255 for eight, the tourists themselves pulled the plank from under their feet to be 82 for six by the 23rd over, and were eventually all out for 218 in 49.1 overs. 

The final margin might appear closer but it was because South Africa pressed in service some irregular bowlers. 

The only positives from the match were the strong statements made by comeback seniors Anil Kumble (2-31) and Zaheer Khan (3-43) with the ball and captain Rahul Dravids stubborn 79. 

The Indians failed to deliver the killer punch in the South African innings after Kumble and Zaheer had helped them take a strong grip of the match. 

The final five overs leaked 68 runs and 96 came from the last 10, allowing South Africa A to recover from 116 for six. 

And with openers Wasim Jaffer and Sachin Tendulkar falling for only five runs each and the middle order of Suresh Raina and Dinesh Mongia departing for blobs, India were never in the contest despite Dravid being non-displaceable at the other end. 

Fast bowler Dale Steyn did his one-day chances no harm with a haul of five for 22, his blistering pace and hostility proving too hot for the Indians. Since he bowled 10 extras, he actually conceded only 12 runs to Indians bat.

 Ferrari to unveil new car

Madonna Di Campiglio (Italy): Ferrari will unveil their new Formula One car at their Mugello test track on January 24, team boss Jean Todt said on Thursday. 

Todt said that the new car would be tested privately before the official launch possibly as early as Monday. 

With new F1 regulations coming into force for the 2006 season, the new car will feature a lower-powered V8 engine as opposed to the V10 used last season. 

Seven-times world champion Michael Schumacher and Brazilian Felipe Massa will race for Ferrari this season.

 Voronin out of Cup

Duisburg: Italy defender Alessandro Nesta ruled himself out of Fridays World Cup quarter final against Ukraine but said he hopes to be fit for the semi-final, should the Azzurri make it. 

Nesta missed the second round win over Australia due to a groin injury he picked up during the final group game against Czech Republic. 

I had another visit to the clinic at Duisburg and there is still a little problem, but I have made a lot of improvement, Nesta told reporters on Wednesday. 

I wont be ready for Fridays game but I am confident and the doctor is confident that I will be ready for the semi-final if there will be one for us, he said. 

In Bergisch Gladbach, Brazilian midfielders Emerson and Kaka underwent intensive treatment on Wednesday after both complained of pain in the right knee. 

Team doctor Jose Luis Runco said it was still too early to say if the pair were doubtful for Saturdays World Cup quarter final against France. 

They suffered injuries to the interior ligament of the right knee, a region which hurts when shooting, Runco told reporters. If the game was tomorrow (Thursday), both would be out, he said. 

Forward Robinho, who was ruled out of the Ghana match because of a twinge in his right thigh, trained under the supervision of a physiotherapist on Wednesday and said he expected to be fit for Saturday. 

Runco said that defender Lucio, who took a knock on his right thigh against Ghana, was not a doubt for Saturday. 

Meanwhile, Ukraine striker Andriy Voronin will miss the rest of the World Cup because of a thigh injury, leaving the team to find a new partner for Andriy Shevchenko ahead of Fridays quarter final against Italy. 

He has slightly torn his thigh muscle, a team spokesman said. He will be out for two weeks.

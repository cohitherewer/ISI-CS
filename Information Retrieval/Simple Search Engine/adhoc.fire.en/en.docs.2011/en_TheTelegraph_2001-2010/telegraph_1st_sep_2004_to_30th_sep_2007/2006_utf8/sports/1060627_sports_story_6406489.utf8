The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 QUICK TAKES 

 Metzelder 

 delivers bearded promise 

 Berlin: If Germany reach 

 the World Cup final on July 9 one of their players will 

 be virtually unrecognisable by the time he goes up to collect 

 his medal. Centre back Christoph Metzelder appeared at a 

 news conference on Monday with several days growth 

 of facial hair and he will not shave again until Germany 

 are out. The beard will only come off when its 

 over for us, Metzelder said. His luck was clearly 

 in during the 2-0 second-round win over Sweden on Saturday. 

 The defender gave away a penalty in the second half but 

 was able to breathe a sigh of relief when Henrik Larsson 

 blasted it over the bar.

 Not USA: Klinsmann 

 Berlin: Germany coach Juergen Klinsmann is 

 showing no interest in taking over the US national team. 

 That doesnt interest me at all, said Klinsmann, 

 reacting to speculation in the German media on Monday that 

 he was been lined up to replace Bruce Arena after the US 

 teams first-round exit. At the moment, Im 

 only interested in my job.

 Grandpas technique 

 Herzogenaurach: Maxi Rodriguez said his granddads 

 coaching had helped him develop the technique he showed 

 when scoring a superb winner against Mexico. My granddad 

 always told me to try to hit the ball with both feet, but 

 I nearly always go with the right. Ive got the left 

 one, as they say, to get on the bus, Rodriguez said 

 on Monday. Rodriguez also felt that Germany would be an 

 easier proposition for Argentina than Mexico.

 Cech surgery 

 Prague: Czech goalkeeper Petr Cech underwent 

 a shoulder operation on Monday, CTK agency said. The agency 

 quoted Cechs agent David Travnicek as saying the surgery, 

 performed in London on Monday morning to resolve long-term 

 trouble in both shoulders, had been successful.

 Nistelrooy move 

 Titisee: Netherlands striker Ruud van Nistelrooy 

 said on Monday he would be discussing his future with Manchester 

 United after watching Hollands exit at the hands of 

 Portugal from the bench. I must get away from the 

 World Cup and deal with it, then I will think about my future, 

 Van Nistelrooy told the official Manchester United website.

 Koreas new coach 

 Seoul: Dutchman Pim Verbeek was on Monday 

 named South Koreas new coach. Formerly the assistant, 

 Verbeek took over from compatriot Dick Advocaat who stepped 

 down after Korea were eliminated from the World Cup on Friday. 

 Dick Advocaat, meanwhile, has signed a two-and-a-half-year 

 contract with Russian premier league club Zenit St Petersburg.

 Hate mail 

 Berlin: Fifa had to block incoming e-mails 

 from South Korea to its website because of a flood of angry 

 messages from fans. 

 Janas on way out 

 Warsaw: Polands football authorities 

 moved a step closer to sacking coach Pawel Janas on Monday 

 after the government upped pressure for heads to roll following 

 a poor World Cup campaign. I have agreed in principle 

 that changes will have to be made in the coaching staff, 

 football association chief Michal Listkiewicz told a news 

 conference.

 Zico defends move 

 Tokyo: Japan coach Zico on Monday defended 

 his judgement over making changes in a crucial first match 

 against Australia. Japan, making their third straight World 

 Cup appearance, failed to reach the round of 16. Based 

 on my experience, I judged that we would be able to win 

 even though the result turned out otherwise, Zico 

 said. I think the choices I made were proper at the 

 time, he said at press conference in Tokyo.

 Lavolpes future 

 Goettingen: A commission will decide whether 

 to renew Ricardo Lavolpes contract as Mexico coach 

 when it runs out on July 30, the president of the national 

 federation said on Sunday. Lavolpe is Mexicos longest-serving 

 coach.

 100 arrested 

 Hong Kong: More than 100 people have been 

 arrested in Hong Kong for illegal gambling since the World 

 Cup kicked off, police said on Monday.

 Negative returns 

 Berlin: No positive doping cases were reported 

 in the first round of the World Cup. Two players from each 

 team involved in the first 48 matches were tested and all 

 returned negative, Fifa communications director Markus Siegler 

 has said. All the samples have been negative so far 

 , which is good, Siegler said.

 Over and out 

 Berlin: The pilot and co-pilot of a helicopter were cited for violating World Cup air space after straying too close to the Germany-Sweden game, police said. The two ? identified only as a 46-year-old Swiss man and a 50-year-old German woman ? entered the no-fly zone during the Saturday game in Munich in their Bell 407 helicopter, police said.

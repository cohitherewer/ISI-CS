 Middle overs will hold key, says Pollock

New Delhi: South African allrounder Shaun Pollock says contemporary cricket will be dominated by teams which work out effective strategies for middle overs. 

Pollock said that with exploiting the field restriction at the start and the death overs having become obvious strategies, teams looking for innovation would turn to the middle overs. 

The introduction of power plays would also push the batsmen to target the part-time bowlers who look to run through in the in-between overs. 

The one-day game has evolved. Initially, during the 1996 World Cup, it was the first 15 overs that dictated the results. Then everyone used the finishing overs. I think now the middle overs will prove to be crucial, he said in a recent interview.

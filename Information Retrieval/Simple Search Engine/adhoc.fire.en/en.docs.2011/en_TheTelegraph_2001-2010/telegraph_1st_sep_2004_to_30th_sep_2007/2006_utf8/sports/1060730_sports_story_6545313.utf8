 Atwal slips to joint 3rd

Milwaukee: Arjun Atwal was three-under through 11 holes when darkness suspended play on the second day of the US Bank Championship in Milwaukee at Brown Deer Park Golf Course. 

Atwal, who shot a six-under 64 on the first day, is now nine-under at just past the midway stage of his second round and is lying tied third with four others. 

Corey Pavin maintained a one-shot lead over Jason Bohn on a hot and humid day. 

The former US Open champion, who opened with a nine-under 61, was 12 under with seven holes left when play was suspended.

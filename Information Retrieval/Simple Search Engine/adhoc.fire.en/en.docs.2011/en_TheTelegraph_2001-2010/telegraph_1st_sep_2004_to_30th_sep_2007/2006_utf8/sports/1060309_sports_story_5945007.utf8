 Split with Simone cost me a lot: Warne

Sydney: Australian leg spinner Shane Warne has confessed that walking out of his marriage with Simone cost him a lot, perhaps also a chance to captain the world champion side. 

Warne, who split with his wife after repeated reports of text message-fuelled relationships with other women while he was still married, said he did not know why he continued to behave inappropriately when it meant the break-up of his family. 

Warne admitted his recklessness meant he had to forfeit a chance to captain his country. 

Yep, Warne said. And Im sorry for that. Its cost me lots of stuff. At the end of the day, its cost me probably ? a chance to captain Australia, Warne said in an interview with a magazine. 

The burly bowler, who is the highest Test wicket-taker, said he was never in love with any of the girls he text-messaged. 

Ive had a few one-night or two-night stands or whatever you want to call it ? Ive never fallen in love with anyone. 

A lot of people dont understand. I dont understand ? maybe I need to see people about it. Maybe. I dont know. 

He said the extent of his womanising had been exaggerated, but that some things just happened. 

And when youre lonely and youre away for six months, things sometimes just happen and then you regret it afterwards and you think you idiot, he said. But its very hard being on the road. Its very lonely. 

Warne said he accepted blame for the impending divorce and the public humiliation of his wife when the extent of his extramarital dalliances became clear. 

It affects absolutely everything ? what can I do about it? Sit here and cry and whinge? If I start to think like that, first of all, Im going to be no good as a parent. 

One of the hardest things Im going to have to live with in my life is that Im going to have to explain to (his children) one day why mummy and daddy split up and theyre going to see it as my fault ? which is the case. 

His relationship with Simone, who is reportedly pursuing a $10 million divorce settlement, is now like brother and sister, he said in the magazine interview. 

Warne also admitted he holds some reservations about Simones media activities, which include appearances on the television program Dancing with the Stars. 

 I think shes just got to find out whats best for her. Im not sure if some of the stuff shes doing is best for her; that doesnt mean I wont support her. I just want her to find out what she thinks shes good at ? rather than trying to do a bit too much. 

Simone understood the reason she was being presented with opportunities, Warne said. She wouldnt have got them if she wasnt with me.

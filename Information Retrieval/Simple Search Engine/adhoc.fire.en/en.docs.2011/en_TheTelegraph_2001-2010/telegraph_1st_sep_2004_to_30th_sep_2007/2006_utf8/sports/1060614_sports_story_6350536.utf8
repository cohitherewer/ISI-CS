 Fourth days proceedings called off

Gros Islet: Play was called off on the Day IV of the second Test between India and the West Indies owing to overcast conditions and wet outfield caused by persistent rains here on Tuesday. 

The start of the fourth days play in the second Test between India and the West Indies was delayed due to rain. 

West Indies, following on, were 43 for one in the second innings overnight. 

Overnight rain had made the two umpires first delay the start by half an hour but just around the rescheduled start, another heavy downpour left the ground absolutely drenched.

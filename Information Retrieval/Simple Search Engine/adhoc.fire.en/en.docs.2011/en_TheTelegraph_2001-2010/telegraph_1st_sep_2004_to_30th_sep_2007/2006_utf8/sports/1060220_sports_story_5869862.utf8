 Korea secure top position 

Jaipur: Top seed South Korea blanked unseeded Chinese Taipei 3-0 to win the Uber Cup Asian Zone qualifiers here. 

Chinese Taipei, who upset second seed Hong Kong 3-1 to storm into the finals earlier in the day, failed to match the guile and prowess of the nimble Koreans. 

The finalists, along with semi-finalists Hong Kong and Singapore, reached the main draw of the Uber Cup Badminton Championship slated to be held in Tokyo in May. 

Chinese Taipeis task became tougher as their top player Cheng Shao Cheih, ranked 13th in world, was indisposed. 

Seo Yoon-yee, world No. 11, took only half of an hour to beat Huang Chia Hsin 21-13, 21-13 to give a 1-0 lead to Korea. World No. 35 Lee Yun Hwa comfortably pulled off 21-8, 21-14 win against Chiu Yi Ju in 27 minutes in the second innings. But the doubles pair of Lee Kyung won and Ha Jung Eun were stretched in their 21-17, 29-27 win against Chen and Yu Chin.

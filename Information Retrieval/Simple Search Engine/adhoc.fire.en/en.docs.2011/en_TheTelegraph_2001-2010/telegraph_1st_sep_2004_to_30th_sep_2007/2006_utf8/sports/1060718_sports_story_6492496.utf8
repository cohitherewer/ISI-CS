London: Left-arm spinner Monty Panesar struck twice before tea on Monday to give England a glimmer of hope of snatching a win in the first Test against Pakistan at Lords. 

Captain Inzamam-ul Haq steered Pakistan to the safety of a draw in the first Test with an unbeaten 56 in the visitors 214 for four on the final day. Abdul Razzaq remained unbeaten on 25. 

Panesar, adding a deceptive flight and turning the occasional delivery sharply, accounted for first-innings double centurion Mohammed Yousuf and Faisal Iqbal for identical scores of 48, after the pair had added 83 for the third wicket. 

At tea Pakistan, who made no attempts to attack a victory target of 380 from 80 overs, were 151 for four with 32 overs remaining on the final day. 

After acting-captain Andrew Strauss declared with England on 296 for eight after 34 minutes play, Matthew Hoggard made early inroads by dismissing the left-handed opening pair of Salman Butt and Imran Farhat. 

Hoggard, whose stock delivery swings in late to left handers, dismissed Butt lbw with the first ball of the innings as the batsman moved across his stumps. 

Farhat was the next to go, caught at third slip by Paul Collingwood for 18 and at lunch Pakistan were 43 for two with 64 overs still to negotiate. 

After Steve Harmison had bowled the first over of the afternoon from the Pavilion End, Strauss introduced his potential match-winner Panesar into the attack for the first time in the innings. 

Bowling initially to a slip, silly mid-off and short leg, Panesar spun his first ball past the outside off Iqbals bat. The second ran off the edge to slip. 

Harmison, whose opening four-over spell in the morning had rarely threatened responded with a hostile spell, hurrying even Yousuf who had scored his second consecutive double century against England in the first innings. 

After several shouts for lbw were rejected by Simon Taufel, Yousuf was fortunate to get away with an inadvertent single when he ducked a bouncer with his bat pointing to the sky. The ball struck the tip and ran away harmlessly. 

Iqbal continued to have his problems against Panesar, although he did relieve the pressure by lofting a six, but it was Yousuf who provided the spinner with his first wicket of the match. 

Panesar, who had now added a second slip to his close fielders, pushed through the fifth delivery of his eighth over and Yousuf was lbw padding up.

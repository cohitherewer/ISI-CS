 Saptarshi clinches title 

Mumbai: Saptarshi Roy won the Thakur International Rating Chess tournament by defeating Umakant Sharma here on Wednesday. 

Ninth seed Saptarshi got the better of Sharma in 32 moves to finish with nine points, while all other games ended in draws. 

The eventual champion replied with Slav Defence to Sharmas D4 on the 24th move, sacrificed his knight and clinched the attacking position against the rival king before winning when Sharma moved the rooks. 

After being poised to win the championship, the unheralded Sharma ended up fourth. (PTI)

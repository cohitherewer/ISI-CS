 NZ upset Pakistan with 51-run victory

 - Fleming betters 2 Ranatunga records 

Mohali: New Zealand turned the tables on fancied Pakistan with a stunning 51-run victory to become the first team to secure a berth in the semi-finals of the ICC Champions Trophy here on Wednesday. 

The New Zealanders gave the perfect gift to their captain Stephen Fleming, who made history by becoming the most capped ODI captain, by first posting a competitive 274 for seven and then dismissing Pakistan for 223 with 3.3 overs to spare in a floodlit group B contest. 

The Black Caps innings was largely built around Flemings 105-ball 80 and Scot Styris knock of 86 as the duo stitched a vital 108-run fourth wicket partnership to bail the team out of early trouble. 

 Some lusty hittings in the slog overs by Jacob Oram (31) and Brian McCullam (27) provided the late sparks to the innings with the New Zealanders plundering 99 runs in the last ten overs which proved to be a big factor in the end. 

The result means that the last league match between Pakistan and South Africa, both of whom have two points from as many matches, will determine the second semi-finalists from group B. 

New Zealand have now completed their group engagements with four points. Since the winner of the Pakistan-South Africa match will also end with four points, the net run rate will decide the champion team from group B. Sri Lanka, the fourth team in the group, are now out of the championship. 

Mohamamed Yousuf (71), Shoaib Malik (52) and Mohammed Hafeez (43) were the notable scorers for Pakistan who found the going tough against a spirited bowling display by the Kiwis. 

With a good total to back them, the New Zealand fast bowlers came to the party at the PCA Stadium. Tearaway quick Shane Bond proved his effectiveness on a helpful track with 3 for 45 for while Jacob Oram and Kyle Mills also chipped in with tight spells. 

With the bowlers excelling under lights without any perceivable trouble due to the dew, the use of chemical spray on the ground appeared to be justified. 

 Credit should also go to the curators for preparing a beauty of a wicket which had something for both the bowlers and the batsmen and played true in both the innings. 

Fleming hit eight fours and a six in his 105-ball knock while Styris slammed 10 fours off 113 balls as Pakistan struggled to contain the rival batsmen. On reaching 76, the New Zealand captain also became the highest run getter as a captain in one-dayers surpassing Ranatungas tally of 5,606.

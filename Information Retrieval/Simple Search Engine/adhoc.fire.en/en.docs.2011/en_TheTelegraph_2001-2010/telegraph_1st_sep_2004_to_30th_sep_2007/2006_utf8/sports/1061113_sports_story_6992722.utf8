 No invitation for Malik

Lahore: The PCB has overlooked former captain Salim Malik, who is serving a life ban for match-fixing, for a seminar to discuss the state of the game in the country. 

The PCB has invited around 30 former captains and players to the seminar on November 17 (not November 16 as reported). While PCB has ignored Malik, another banned former captain Mohammed Azharuddin was invited by the BCCI at the inauguration of its headquarters in Mumbai recently. (Agencies)

 Kim Clijsters to marry 

Brussels: Former world No.1 Kim Clijsters will marry American basketball player Brian Lynch, who currently plays for Belgian side Bree, press reports said on Monday. 

The couple has been together since early 2005 and announced their engagement in April. 

Clijsters for several years was the girlfriend of Australias former world No.1 Lleyton Hewitt before they split up in October 2004, four months before their planned marriage. 

The oft-injured Belgian player also confirmed her intention to retire from tennis at some stage next year. 

I will play Wimbledon for sure, said Clijsters who indicated that her marriage to Lynch could take place shortly after that. 

Clijsters has been out of action for several weeks with a wrist injury she sustained while preparing to defend her US Open title. 

But she is to make her return to the courts on home turf in the Hasselt WTA tournament which began on Monday. (AFP)

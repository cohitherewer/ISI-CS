Vadodara: A patient century from Test discard Gautam Gambhir and useful contributions from Suresh Raina and the lower-order saw Board Presidents XI gain the upperhand in the three-day tour match against England on Friday. 

Gambhir, dumped from the Indian squad for the first Test, played an uncharacteristically subdued knock to make 108 while Raina celebrated his promotion to the five-day game with a fluent 62 as the hosts declared at 342 for eight on the second day. 

Cheeky knocks from Ramesh Powar (23 not out) and Vikram Rajvir Singh (13) meant the Board Presidents XI gained a first innings lead of 104 with a days play left. 

At stumps, England were 10 for one with stand-in captain Marcus Trescothick and nightwatchman Matthew Hoggard four each. 

The lead could have been even bigger had captain Venugopal Rao (25) and wicketkeeper-batsman Dinesh Karthik (19) lasted longer. 

But the two, as also Tamil Nadu middle-order bat S. Badrinath, fell to the second new ball which proved more productive for the visitors. As it were, the home team declined from 274 for three in the 89th over as they lost five wickets in the space of 15 overs with fast bowlers taking four of those. 

Stephen Harmison finished with three for 72 while Andrew Flintoff took three for 74. 

Gambhir gave a fitting retort to the national selectors with a well-paced knock. The fluent strokemaker from New Delhi played an unusually subdued knock when he faced 227 balls and hit 15 fours. But eight of them had come on Thursday evening and only one after lunch on Friday. The opener finally fell to Flintoff, caught at gully while trying to cut the bowler. 

Raina, who was rewarded for his one-day performance in Pakistan with a place in the squad that will take on England in the first Test in Nagpur from March 1, made 62 with six fours from 119 balls. 

Flintoff bowled with more vigour in the post-lunch session but it was clear that the tourists were missing the services of reverse swing talent Simon Jones. 

Of the two left-arm spinners, Monty Panesar derived good turn while Ian Blackwell had less of an impact than he had with the bat. 

All the seamers bowled well, Flintoff later told reporters. Its important going into the first Test that all three fast bowlers do well. 

The wicket is not quite abrasive. We did not get reverse swing. Im not quite sure what to expect in the Test series. We might have to rethink about reverse swing.

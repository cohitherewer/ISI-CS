The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 IN THE CITY

 Industrialist Aditya Kashyap will vie for the presidential post as the ruling group?s candidate at the AGM of the IFA on Wednesday. It is likely that Kashyap will make it uncontested as the opposition?s efforts to rope in sports minister Subhas Chakraborty has failed. Chakraborty told The Telegraph late Tuesday night: ?I will not contest the post.? 

 There will, however, be a contest for the post of three vice-presidents. N. R. Dutta, Krishnendu Banerjee and Mahendra Jalan will be the ruling group?s candidates while Gobinda Dutta, Dr Parimal Debnath and Ashok Bose will represent the opposition.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Paul hoping to clear next hurdle 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: For Shib Shankar Paul, making it to the list of the 30 probables for the Champions Trophy is like crossing the first hurdle, and he has already set his sights on clearing the next one. 

Though every player dreams of playing a tournament like Champions Trophy, honestly speaking, I was expecting the call, the Bengal mediumpacer said on Wednesday. 

This call-up to me is like crossing the first-hurdle. Now Im focussing on clearing the next one, that is, making the final squad, he pointed out. 

Ive already started my physical training. In the past, I have had a few meetings with Greg Chappell. He has helped me with my bowling, particularly my line and length. Ive been following his advice, Paul remarked. 

Paul wants to attribute this self-belief to his performance as an India A player in Australia. He took eight wickets in three matches during the Top End Series Down Under. 

I believe my performance in Australia must have impressed the selectors, he said. 

Incidentally, Paul had sought a few tips from the legendary Richard Hadlee during his stint in Australia an incident, which he described as an unforgettable moment. 

The exposure in Australia helped me gain a lot of confidence. If I keep on performing, I know I may be in the (final) Champions Trophy squad, he said.

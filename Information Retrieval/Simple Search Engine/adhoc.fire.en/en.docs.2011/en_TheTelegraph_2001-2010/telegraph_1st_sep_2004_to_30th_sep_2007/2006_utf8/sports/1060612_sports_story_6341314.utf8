The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Im sorry Sehwag couldnt make it

 - Majid Khan, the last batsman with a test century before lunch, praises 

 indian vice-captain 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Virender Sehwag on way to his 180 on Saturday 

 Calcutta: For somebody who wasnt driven 

 by records, its not surprising that Majid Mr 

 Majestic Khan doesnt remember anything about 

 his century before lunch on the opening day of the Karachi 

 Test against New Zealand a shade under 30 years ago.

 I wouldnt put it down 

 to the passage of time? Just cant recall how I got 

 the runs that morning (October 30, 1976)? Honestly dont 

 remember anything, Majid, now 59, told The Telegraph. 

Speaking from Islamabad on Sunday, the morning after Team India vice-captain Virender Sehwag failed by one run to become the first after him to join a truly exclusive club, he added: Im sorry he couldnt make it? Perhaps, Sehwag wont miss out on the next opportunity? 

 Majid Khan

The former Pakistan captain (and Imrans cousin) has been watching most of the India-West Indies telecasts, but missed Sehwags tornado-like innings. Its a regret. 

Almost 130 years of Test cricket has seen only four get a century before the first break. Majid followed Australians Victor Trumper, Charles Macartney and Donald Bradman. 

Our very own Farokh Engineer, though, could have beaten the Cambridge Blue had he got six more on January 13, 1967, at the Chepauk versus the West Indies. 

The visitors attack included Wesley Hall and Charles Griffith. 

One of the finest hookers the sport has seen, Majid reached his century off just 77 balls with three minutes for lunch, belting the likes of Richard Hadlee, Richard Collinge and Lance Cairns. 

He fell for 112. 

Surprisingly, Majid didnt realise hed authored a record ? the first non-Australian and the first after World War II ? till he was at the National Stadium. 

Im not sure whether somebody told me about the record that evening or the next morning? What I do recall is that I knew nothing as long we were at the ground, he pointed out. 

Commenting on Sehwag, Majid said: Irrespective of the conditions and the bowlers, he likes to dominate? Thats one quality which sets him apart? He has his own technique, but it has brought him success? Sehwag has had periods when he hasnt got big runs, but Bradman also went through that cycle. 

Majid, however, declined to compare Sehwag with anybody from an earlier era. Comparisons cant be made? You cant compare two fielders, forget comparing batsmen and bowlers? Suffice to say Sehwag has the attributes of a great batsman. 

Asked whether he continued to advocate that batsmen didnt need footwork (an opinion which caused a stir in the Seventies), Majid laughed: Absolutely? A batsman needs to pick the ball early? Thats all. 

Till his reflexes slowed, Majid proved that time and time again out on the park. Once, he even helped himself to 30 runs, via five over-boundaries, in one first-class over. 

That was at the expense of Glamorgan, a County he joined soon after the assault. Hes still revered there (and elsewhere, too). 

The Ludhiana-born Majid, who served as chief executive of the Pakistan Cricket Board for three years from mid-1996, is currently director (sports) of Pakistan Television. 

 Incidentally, son Bazid has also played for Pakistan.

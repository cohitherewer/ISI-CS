 McGrath confirms participation

 - Champions Trophy 

 McGrath 

Melbourne: Glenn McGrath has decided to make his international comeback at the Champions Trophy in India later this year as he believes it will be a good preparation for the following Ashes series. 

...Cricket wise, I can think of no better preparation for the Ashes than a six-week build-up on the flat sub-continent wickets. That will be all the workout I need leading into the summer, He said, putting to rest speculation that he might give the one-day meet a miss. 

He also said he was shocked by last weeks serial blasts in Mumbai. My heart goes out to the people there. When I saw that on the news I didnt even think of cricket, I just thought of the people. 

The bowling great said he was gladdened by comments from fast-bowling legends Dennis Lillee, Richard Hadlee and Allan Donald that his comeback would be a success and he should be handed the new ball in the first Ashes Test. 

Its great to hear positive things from people who know what the game is all about, as opposed to the opinions of a few who are less informed, Mcgrath was quoted as saying in a paper on Sunday. 

They are all quality fast bowlers ? three of them greatest ever ? and that level of support has given me a lift. 

Hadlee had said: What you lose in pace you make up for in experience, skill and variation. Theres no reason that Glenn cant come back as strong as ever. 

McGrath also said he was not thinking about retirement. Ive always said the next World Cup is a realistic goal ? and the way Im feeling, there is no reason why I cant go beyond that. As the guys have said, its all about experience and I still have some good years, maybe even my best years, ahead of me. (PTI)

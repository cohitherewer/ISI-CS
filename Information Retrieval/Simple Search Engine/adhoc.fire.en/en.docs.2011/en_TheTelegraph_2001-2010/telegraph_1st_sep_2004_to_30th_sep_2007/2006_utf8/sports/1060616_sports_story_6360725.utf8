QUICK TAKES

 64 hooligans charged with 

 criminal offence 

 Dortmund: Police have charged 

 64 people with criminal offences following clashes on Wednesday 

 in by far the worst outbreak of trouble at the tournament 

 so far. A police spokesman said on Thursday that 429 fans 

 were detained either because they were known Polish or German 

 hooligans or their behaviour was aggressive and threatening 

 and police wished to prevent violence from escalating. 

Of those detained, 278 were German and 119 were Poles. By Thursday morning police had released all but three fans, after arresting 96 and going on to charge 64 with offences ranging from damage of property to serious bodily harm. 

 Wolfgang Niersbach, a vice-president of the German 

 World Cup organising committee, praised the action of the 

 police at a briefing for reporters on Thursday. quot;The 

 police deserve tremendous praise for the way they handled 

 the situation, realised the danger and took preventive action.

 King Kahn turns 37 

 Berlin: Germany goalkeeper Oliver Kahn celebrated his 37th birthday on Thursday and received congratulations from teammates on the return flight from the game in Dortmund where they beat Poland 1-0. 

 Despite several patches of turbulence because of stormy 

 weather, the crew and the team sang Happy Birthday 

 for the goalkeeper, who was demoted to backup behind Jens 

 Lehmann before the tournament by coach Juergen Klinsmann. 

 Kahn is the oldest member of the team.

 Shop till you drop 

 Munich: All of Germany, it seems, is staying up late for the World Cup ? including the shopping malls. In a country where many shops close by 6 pm and dont open at all on Sundays, the tournament offers an excuse to relax rigid laws dictating store hours. 

 I can take my time to do my shopping, 

 said Ina Andrees, who was shopping at Potsdamer Arkaden 

 in Berlin late on Wednesday night. German law allows shops 

 to be open only from 6 am to 8 pm Monday through Saturday. 

 During the World Cup, some stores are staying open late, 

 and some like Wal-Mart in Wiesbaden is staying open 24 hours 

 a day.

 Angolan cashes in 

 Hanover: Joao Silvas entrepreneurial mind went into overdrive when he heard that Angola qualified for the World Cup. And its already paying off. The Luanda native came to Germany and set up a slice of home for the African teams fans, a restaurant called Buffet Angolano. 

 I thought it would be a good idea to set up 

 a restaurant where the Angolans accompanying the team as 

 well as the Angolan diaspora here could eat food from home 

 during the World Cup, he said. And his euro 25 buffet 

 is proving to be a hit with the Africans. There are 

 about 7,000 Angolans in Germany at the moment and every 

 day around 600 people come here. If we become too popular, 

 it could start getting complicated.

 Al-Jabers feat 

 Munich: Sami al-Jaber, who gave the Saudis a 2-1 lead in the 84th minute against Tunisia, finished a counter. He has taken part in four World Cups and now has goals in three after scoring on his first touch of the game. He also joins Pele, Uwe Seeler, Diego Maradona and Michael Laudrup as the only players to have scored a World Cup goal 12 years after their maiden strike. Al-Jaber, who had retired from the national team, returned for qualifying and had entered the game moments before. 

 This is every players dream. I am so pleased 

 with scoring and I will work hard for more goals, 

 Al-Jaber said.

 Ukraine given day off 

 Berlin: Ukraine coach Oleh Blokhin gave his 

 players the day off on Thursday, one day after their humiliating 

 0-4 defeat to Spain in their World Cup debut. Its 

 a free day for the team, Ukraine spokesman Igor Miroshnyschenko 

 said. Some who did not play will do some light training. 

 But theres a lesson in tactics for everyone. 

 A badly needed lesson, according to Blokhin. There 

 is a lot of work to do. It was embarrassing, Blokhin 

 said. Well have to analyse our mistakes very 

 closely if we want to get past Saudi Arabia and Tunisia. 

 Well also need to rebuild the defence completely.

 US coachs regret 

 Hamburg: US coach Bruce Arena said on Thursday that he regretted having a public slanging match with his versatile midfielder DaMarcus Beasley following their 0-3 loss to the Czech Republic. But Arena insisted there were no after-effects over the remarkably open criticism they had for each other about Mondays defeat in Gelsenkirchen and said there were no hard feelings between him and the 24-year-old from PSV Eindhoven. 

 Probably the remarks from me and DaMarcus should 

 not have even been stated, Arena said on Thursday 

 before the team flew to Ramstein air base near Kaiserslautern 

 for their match against Italy on Saturday.

 Pfister may sue Komlan 

 Munich: Togo coach Otto Pfister may sue the head of the West African countrys football association for comments he made about the German after his surprise return to manage the squad earlier this week. 

I might take legal action. The moment he makes those comments, what can I do? Pfister said over the phone. The Togo FAs secretary general Assogbavi Komlan said on Tuesday that Pfister drank too much. 

 He also said a decision on who would coach the World 

 Cup debutants through their next matches was due on Wednesday 

 and that he did not want Pfister.

 Swedish patriotism 

 Stockholm: A Swedish man, gripped by World 

 Cup fever, painted his whole house in the blue and yellow 

 colours of the national flag while his wife was at work. 

 I knew she would say no, so there was no point in 

 asking her about it, Janne Petterson said on Thursday. 

 It was really fun to see her face when she got home.

 Rikki the watchdog 

 Cologne: Rikki, the Belgian Malinois, paws 

 at his muzzle as his handler surveys the thousands of German 

 and Polish fans partying on the steps outside Colognes 

 spectacular cathedral. Rikkis muzzle will stay on 

 tonight. If theres trouble, I go in with the 

 dogs, the chief handler on patrol said outside the 

 citys main train station, hours after Germanys 

 win over Poland. If they dont disperse, the 

 muzzles come off and we clean up. Most German police 

 forces have switched to the Malinois from other breeds such 

 as the German Shepherd due to its agility and high prey 

 drive. The breed is described as a no-nonsense 

 dog, unmatched in terms of toughness and focus.

 Referees happy 

 Frankfurt: Referees are happy with their performance 

 at the World Cup so far and said a campaign to cut down 

 on foul play and diving had worked but said on Thursday 

 things could change as the games get more important. As 

 a team we are happy, but its only 25 percent of the 

 whole way, German referee Markus Merk said. Now 

 the second phase of the group matches has started and I 

 know with my experience that sometimes its much more 

 difficult. Before the World Cup, Fifa said referees 

 would be clamping down on foul play and sent delegations 

 to explain to teams what would not be tolerated.

 Italy hold closed session 

 Duisburg: Italy trained behind closed doors on Thursday, two days before facing the US in Group E. Midfielder Gennaro Gattuso practiced with the team and is recovering from a torn right thigh muscle. Training was held in cool and damp weather, after thunderstorms Wednesday on night ended a weeklong heat wave.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Boys should be proud of the way they played, says Rahul Dravid

 - Were going to be under pressure against any team if we dont bat well, but I dont see it as a problem... 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Jaipur: Rajasthans ambitious chief minister Vasundhara Raje wants cricket to boost the states tourism industry, but Team India will have to bat much better if its exploits are to serve as the hottest promotional. 

The hosts did collect full points in the Champions Trophy opener versus England, Sunday, but the packed Sawai Man Singh Stadium Shah Rukh Khan was among those who turned up, for a while saw no on-field fireworks even as the first display just off the ampitheatre was terribly ill-timed and left captain Rahul Dravid, whod walked in to replace Irfan Pathan, confused (I had to figure out what was happening...). 

Excellent opening bursts from Pathan and Munaf Patel, who bagged his maiden MoM award, helped bowl out England for no more than 125 (lowest in bilateral face-offs). In fact, the visitors innings ended well before the scheduled break and, despite the up-and-down wicket, it was assumed the Indians would wrap it up quick after making the most of winning the toss. 

That 48 were taken off the first five overs, for the loss of the mercurial Virender Sehwag, seemed to give the buzz credibility. The second session, however, found the Indians struggling. Later, Sachin Tendulkar (Indias top-scorer with 35) felt 175 would have been a very good total. 

Given that we lost six wickets in reaching 126, it could have been a winning score. 

Losing four wickets would have been par for the course... You may look for negatives, but the boys should be proud of the way they played... This was (after all) the first match... We came into the tournament under pressure and responded well, is what Dravid had to say. 

He added: Were going to be under pressure against any team if we dont bat well, but I dont see it as a problem... Two-three key batsmen havent been getting runs, but this batting has class... I see a lot of quality in our batting... Veeru (Sehwag) hasnt been scoring big but, when in form, he can help us win the World Cup... 

Such support must please the vice-captain, but its time he realised certain surfaces call for the building of an innings. Years in the business ought to have taught him that. 

Dravid himself played another poor shot. Actually, he hasnt even touched 30 (in ODIs) for months now. Yet, hes not allowing that to prey on his mind. Worrying about it wont help me get past 30... I did have a very good Test series (in the West Indies) in between and Im looking ahead positively... 

He accepted that keeping out Dinesh Mongia had been difficult, but explained a frontline spinner (Ramesh Powar) was given the nod. I had to look at Powars record versus England (earlier in the year) and make a call on who would I like to bowl on the wicket here... Dinesh was unlucky... 

Dravid, incidentally, revealed that the decision to play Pathan had been mulled over. I went with who I thought could make a difference... Irfan is a proven matchwinner and hasnt let me down on the big occasions... He takes early wickets, is good in the field and bats well... 

Former India captain Ravi Shastri, of course, had praised the composition of the XI even before the first ball was bowled. Speaking to The Telegraph, hed said: Its the right combination... Youve got to play five bowlers (at home) and take advantage of Pathan and (Mahendra Singh) Dhonis batting... We should stick to this even if we lose a few matches. 

The defeat notwithstanding, England captain Andrew Flintoff insisted his team wasnt despondent. It was the first match and, as the games are spaced out, weve got time to reflect on what happened today and work hard for the next match (against Australia, Saturday)... We arent out of the competition and will learn from this defeat... 

Flintoff praised Pathan and Munaf: They exploited the strange wicket and bowled in good areas... They kept asking questions all the time... About 170 runs would have... Still, that we got six batsmen shows the boys played with character... Its only that we didnt start well, both while batting (55 for five within 20 overs) and bowling... 

The Indians, whove got a Diwali break, are to assemble in Ahmedabad next Sunday. Match No.2, versus the West Indies, is on October 26. 

Footnote: The rapidly-improving Munaf pointed out hed been concentrating on line and length. Thats more important than speed... Overjoyed, he added that the good partnership with Pathan helped. Asked if he would now be under more pressure, Munaf replied grinning pressure is always there on all bowlers...

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 It was Chisty all the way 

 STAR RACER

 Barring the opening event, last Wednesdays racing was clean. The curtain-raiser, the Sholay Handicap, witnessed repeated antics of jockey Mark Reuben and his ride, Tip Toes. In her previous outing, the keyed-up filly had unseated Reuben on her way to the start. It was Reubens turn to square up the issue, which he handled with some tact. 

 In the end, Tip Toes finished a tame second after going in-and-out in the stretch run to justify why her odds had expanded from 5-4 to 4-1. The frustrated stewards also sensed foul play but they were helpless. However, they ordered the dope test.

 Legacy Of Love won the race and jockey Imran Chisty booted home first of his three winners on the day. Chistys wins came in quick succession, though he had to punish his next winner, Notable Guest, for a long-neck victory after the favo-urite, AMa Jaju, had established a three-length lead in the last furlong. Chistys coaxing of the 11-4 fancy hardly worked in the first half of the 1,100m Fizz Handicap but the horses responded well in the pressure-situation.

 Indigos handicap advantage over Ganga Bose came to Chistys rescue in the 1,400m Liberty Cup. In their recent encounter, Indigo had gone down fighting to the Bose. 

 Chisty came close to winning his fourth race with Polar Magic in the concluding event, the Idolator Handicap. 

 However, a big pull at the weights, enjoyed by Accountable, thanks to Jugnu Gurangs riding allowance, proved a stumbling block in Chistys way. 

 In the same race Candle Light let down a big following. The hot-fancy looked to be in serious contention upfront and jockey C.Alford, too, seemed to be trying his best. However, the Robin Corner-trainees challenge ended soon after the distance post. The filly may have needed the run.

 About half-an-hour earlier, Alford had romped home with Flemenco Star to lift the Real Danger Handicap. The even-money favourite, however, failed to maintain a straight course but this being his first run with the new equipment, blinkers, the San Francisco colt is sure to overcome the shortcomings.

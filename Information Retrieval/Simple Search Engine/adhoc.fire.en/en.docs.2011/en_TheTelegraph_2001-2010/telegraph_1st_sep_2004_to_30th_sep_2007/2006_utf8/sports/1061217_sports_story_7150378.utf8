Perth: Adam Gilchrist smashed the second fastest century in Test history to leave Australia poised to regain the Ashes from England in record time after the third day of the third Test on Saturday. 

Gilchrist slammed 12 fours and four sixes to reach his hundred off just 57 balls. He finished unbeaten on 102 as Australia amassed a daunting total of 527 for five declared. 

Set 557 for victory to keep the series alive, Englands hopes of a miracle plummeted when opener Andrew Strauss departed for a fourth-ball duck before they limped to the close on 19 for one. 

Michael Clarke (135 not out) and Mike Hussey (103) also made hundreds after Matthew Hayden (92) and Ricky Ponting (75) narrowly missed out, Australias batsmen going on the rampage against a dispirited England bowling attack. 

England defeated Australia 2-1 in an epic series at home last year to win the Ashes for the first time in 16 years but face the prospect of handing them back after just 15 months the shortest reign since the Ashes were first contested in 1882. 

 Gilchrist set a series of records as he chalked up his 17th hundred. He equalled Graham Thorpes record for the fastest Ashes fifty when he reached the milestone off just 40 balls. 

He also set a record for the most runs off a single six-ball Ashes over when he plundered 24 off spinner Monty Panesar and brought up his hundred in just one more ball than Viv Richards world record of 56, set against England at St Johns in 1985-86. (REUTERS)

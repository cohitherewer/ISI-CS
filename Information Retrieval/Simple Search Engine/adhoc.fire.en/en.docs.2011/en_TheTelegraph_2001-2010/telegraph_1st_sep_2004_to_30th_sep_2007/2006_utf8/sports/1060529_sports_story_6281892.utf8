 India to open versus Pak in junior hockey

New Delhi: India will take on arch-rivals Pakistan in their opening tie of the U-21 hockey tournament which will begin at Gniezno in Poland on Monday. 

The Indian side, with some experienced players who have either played international matches or top level domestic tournaments, is upbeat about their chances in the tournament and will look forward to get a winning start against the neighbours, who are considered as strong contenders for the title. 

Amidst adverse weather conditions, the Indians started their practice on Saturday and played a practice match against a local team.

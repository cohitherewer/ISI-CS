 Wada can reinforce ban

Lahore: The Wada may be able to reinforce the ban against dope-tainted Pakistani pacemen Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Asif, the countrys anti-doping tribunal chief said on Sunday. 

According to the Wada code they can apply for provisional suspension, Barrister Shahid Hamid said. 

Hamid headed the three-member PCB Tribunal which last month banned Akhtar for two years and Asif for one year, after the new-ball pair tested positive for nandrolone. 

Both bans were overturned by a committee headed by a retired High Court Judge earlier this month. (AFP)

 NZ seal series with ease

Wellington: New Zealand crushed the West Indies by 10 wickets in the second Test to take an unbeatable 2-0 lead in their three-match series on Monday. 

Set just 36 to win, New Zealand cruised to victory in less than nine overs with Hamish Marshall making an unbeaten 23 and Jamie How nine. 

It was a record fifth successive Test victory for New Zealand and an eighth defeat in a row for the West Indies. 

The tourists began the day on 118 for four in their second innings, needing another 62 to make New Zealand bat again. 

They managed to avoid an innings defeat but added just 97 runs for the loss of their last six wickets

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 First ODI washed out

Colombo: Inclement weather forced the first one-dayer between India and hosts Sri Lanka to be abandoned here on Saturday. 

The match was supposed to resume after being postponed on Friday, but overnight and morning showers dismissed any such possibility at the Sinhalese Sports Club ground. 

Play was stopped owing to bad light with India 11 for no loss after electing to bat, and soon thick clouds hanging over the ground burst open and left the ground flooded. 

The umpires and the organisers had hoped for a delayed start on Saturday, but the heavens put paid to those ambitions with another sharp spell that left the groundsmen with an improbable task on their hands. 

However, minutes after the match was called off, sun broke through. The officials would be praying that the weather holds good and allows the second match to be played on Sunday. (PTI)

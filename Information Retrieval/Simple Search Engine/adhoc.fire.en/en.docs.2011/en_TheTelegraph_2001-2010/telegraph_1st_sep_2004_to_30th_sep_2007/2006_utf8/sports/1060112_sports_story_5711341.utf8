The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Archery expert advocates changes

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Archery needs to be more instinct-oriented, feels Pascal Colmaire, Technical and Training Director of the International Archery Federation (FITA). 

Pascal ? a member of Frances 1992 Olympic gold-winning team ? is in the city for a Level I coaching clinic organised by the Sports Authority of India (SAI) and Archery Association of India (AAI). 

Speaking to The Telegraph on Wednesday on the sidelines of the clinic, Pascal said: The acid test in archery is to shoot on instinct. There lies the spirit of this game. 

The FITA, in an attempt to the make the game more instinct-oriented, wants to try out the hit-and-miss method. 

The current system has the archers aiming at a board which has five rings, each of which is divided into two sections marked accordingly. 

The hit-and-miss method, on the other hand, will be similar to combat training, which the Army undergoes. There will be a shooting gallery and the archers have to hit the target as soon as it pops up. 

FITA is in talks with the International Olympic Committee (IOC) about the change in format, informed Pascal. An archer needs to have a perfect balance of mind and body, which will enable him to excel if this hit-and-miss method is accepted. 

Pascal, on his first visit to the country, feels FITAs Bamboo Bow programme, employed in developing countries, is a perfect model for India. 

With bamboo being easily available in these countries, competitions are arranged with bows and arrows made of bamboo. 

The one who emerges best is provided with the best equipment and scholarships.

 AIFF nod for players body

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Another association by Indian footballers is going to see light on Sunday. The Bhaichung Bhutias and S. Venkateshes will formally launch the body christened as Football Players Association of India (FPAI) at a city hotel with the focus being on protecting their causes at a time when disputes over players transfers have become a common feature. 

Former India custodian Sumit Mukherjee would take charge as chief executive officer of the body, which involves almost all the current players. 

Even before its foundation, the FPAI has received a green signal from AIFF president Priya Ranjan Das Munsi, who visited the team hotel on Saturday.

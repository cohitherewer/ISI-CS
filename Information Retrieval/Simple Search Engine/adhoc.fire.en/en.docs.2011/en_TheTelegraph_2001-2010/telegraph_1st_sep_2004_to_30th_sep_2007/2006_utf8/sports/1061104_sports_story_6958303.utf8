Guwahati: The last time Sourav Ganguly played at the Nehru Stadium here was in 2002 as Team India captain. Four years down the line, he has not only lost the captaincy, but also his place in the side. A big question mark also hangs over his future. 

Despite the several hits his international career has taken and his all but being written off in certain quarters, the Sourav magic if not his form remains. This was more than underlined by the manager of the North Zone Ashok Vaswani. 

Both teams are good but a lot will depend on how Dada (Sourav) fares, he said, while sizing up both teams after nets for the virtual Duleep Trophy semi-final between East Zone and North Zone starting here on Saturday. 

The name of other internationals like SS Das, Deep Dasgupta and Rohan Gavaskar were mentioned as an afterthought. 

Sourav remarked that the wicket appeared result-oriented and it would be a good toss to win.

 ICC offers to talk to players

 - MPA issue

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: In an apparent bid to put pressure on the BCCI over the issue of Members Participation Agreement (MPA), the ICC has offered to hold direct talks with Rahul Dravid amp; Co. 

While the ICC is required to deal directly with the BCCI on player issues, Ive always enjoyed a good relationship with the Indian captain, Rahul Dravid, and several of their leading players and, should the BCCI permit, Id welcome an opportunity to answer any queries they may have, ICC general manager (cricket) Dave Richardson said in a press release on Friday. 

The BCCI, however, has vehemently opposed the idea of involving the players in discussions on the MPA. 

What Ive learnt is that the ICC has just offered to hold talks with the players. But weve earlier made our stand clear to the ICC that they need to deal directly with us in connection with the MPA issues, BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah remarked, when contacted on his cellphone. Moreover, unless BCCI gives permission to the players, they cant talk to ICC, he added. 

Richardson further stated that players will be faced with fewer restrictions regarding their own endorsement deals and will have greater control over the use of their own player attributes before, during and after ICC events. 

It may be recalled that before the 2002 Champions Trophy in Sri Lanka and 2003 World Cup in Africa, the ICC contracts imbroglio had threatened the participation of the best Indian squad in the meets. 

The then BCCI president Jagmohan Dalmiya had argued at that time that the ICC couldnt risk isolating India because most of the sponsorship money for international cricket comes from here.

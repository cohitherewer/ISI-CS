 Ecuador look to consolidate

 - Costa Ricas last chance to stay alive 

Hamburg: For Ecuador, its a chance to virtually ensure themselves of a place in the second round in only its second trip to the World Cup. For Costa Rica, Thursdays clash is the last opportunity to remain alive. 

Encouraged by a 2-0 win over Poland in their opener, Ecuador are injury free as they prepare for the match against the Ticos at the home of six-time German league champion Hamburg SV. 

Costa Rica not only were beaten 2-4 by host Germany on Friday, it also lost defender Gilberto Martinez to tendinitis in his left leg. 

A victory for Ecuador would leave the South Americans on the verge of reaching the last 16 and Costa Rica merely waiting to play out the tournament before going home. 

Still, the warning at the Ecuadorean camp is against overconfidence. 

What we did against Poland gave us more security, but we cannot think that we already have overcome the second obstacle, coach Luis Fernando Suarez said. 

Costa Rica has a lot of resources, and it wouldnt be a good idea for us to consider that we already have won a match we havent played. 

The players agreed. We defeated Poland and that gave us tranquility, but we cant feel assured because our two rivals ahead are very difficult, midfielder Edison Mendez said. 

Lets not allow our confidence to go beyond a normal limit, added defender Ivan Hurtado. 

Costa Rica coach Alexander Guimaraes is mulling some changes, including whom to replace Martinez. Most likely it will be Jervis Drummond. Guimaraes said he needs more attack, and he may give defenders more freedom to move forward. 

Ecuador is a very well organised team, which has been playing the same style 12 years now and its players like it, Guimaraes said, noting it is not an aggressive side. Ecuador is not a team that would put pressure on you, so we have to block them and attack them. 

The Brazilian-born Guimaraes said hes planning some line-up changes, but nothing major. We are not going to be as crazy as to change one half of our team, Guimaraes said. Our team has been improving its performance. And there will also be some tactical changes. 

Paulo Wanchope, who scored the two goals against Germany, again will lead the offensive ? and Ecuadoreans know that. Wanchope will again be fed by midfielders Walter Centeno and Ronald Gomez, Ecuador assistant coach Armando Osma said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Driven by a mission, one must be ready for any eventuality

 - A TELEGRAPH EXCLUSIVE

 - Imran Khan, the politician, takes guard 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Imran 

Mumbai: Fourteen years after captaining Pakistan to a World Cup triumph, Imran Khan is in the thick of a political battle. A Member of the National Assembly (MNA) for the past four years, he heads the Tehrik-e-Insaaf party. In the city for a TV shoot, Imran spoke to The Telegraph about his political agenda and related matters. 

The following are excerpts 

Q Elections are due next year. How is your party gearing up? 

A Come November 16 and were launching our first real membership drive... Were working on our base... 

But why have you waited a decade to start a concerted drive? 

Because the time hadnt been right... This time, were keeping next years elections in mind... Were going to peak at the right time, hopefully... Theres no point running out of steam by the time the real thing (elections) comes. 

Has your party actually grown in the four years since youve been an MNA? 

Yes. Im confident that the Tehrik-e-Insaaf will emerge as a force to reckon with in the next elections. 

Are you, today, being accepted more as a politician? 

I was always accepted, its just that we didnt have a political organisation... The electorate, in my opinion, understands issues a lot better now... The growth of TV, with independent channels coming in, has played a big part. Its easier for a politician to put across his thoughts. 

Two former Prime Ministers (and one-time foes), Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif, recently met in London. Clearly, realignments are on in the Opposition. Where do you stand? 

If the elections are held under General (Pervez) Musharrafs regime, then theres going be a straight divide: Pro and anti-Musharraf... Pro-democracy and anti-military... It could be different if elections are held under a caretaker government, which is what the Opposition has been demanding. 

So, despite differences, you may team up with Benazir and Sharif... 

With all anti-Musharraf forces... At this stage, one cant say who is where as talks are on. Even the Establishment is speaking to some in the Opposition. The divide should be clear within the next month or thereabouts. 

Realistically, wont you be better off straightaway striking a deal with one of the bigger parties? 

Look, we werent really prepared in the last two elections and, where the last (2002) is concerned, wed been with Musharraf till only a few months before... Because we moved away late, we were neither part of the Opposition nor the Establishment... In any case, the last elections were controlled. (After a pause) In principle, I intend being part of a coalition. But, as Ive said, I cant say what shape it will take. 

Who is best suited to head that coalition? 

Too early to comment. 

What if the elections are held under a caretaker government? 

Then, were going to be guided by our manifesto and team up with whoever is closest to our agenda. 

Can you elaborate on the partys manifesto... 

It has three points: First, we want a sovereign Pakistan... If were to be ruled by an American puppet, be a satellite of the US, then what was the point of independence? In fact, the governance had been much better under the British... Im opposed to a leadership which barters away our sovereignty... Im against the policies of (President) George Bush... Hes imperialistic and fascist. Second, Pakistan must have rule of law and the constitution has to be respected, not subverted. Third, Pakistan should be a welfare state instead of catering to 100,000 members of the elite society... Currently, we have an elitist system and, so, policies get distorted. We need a state which is sensitive to the needs of the less privileged. 

Theres this impression that your strong anti-American stand has much to do with cashing in on a sentiment in parts of Pakistan. Have you consciously done so? 

Look, Im not anti-US... Im opposed to the policies adopted by Bush and the fact that weve been reduced to a satellite state. Right now, my impression is that a majority of the Americans dont support their President. 

I suppose the next elections have that make-or-break importance for you? 

It will be make, not break... Thats going to be reflected in the number of seats we win. A political party breaks when it shifts from ideology. Its important for the people to know where you stand. 

Do you regret having turned down Musharrafs offer of Prime Ministership? Surely, you couldve used that position to effect changes... 

(Smiles) You cant bring about change by being part of the status quo... Thats a contradiction in terms. Its not a regret, though. Your best bet is to try and make a change by standing up to the status quo. 

Have you actually been an active parliamentarian? 

The Establishment has turned the National Assembly into a dummy one... Ideally, I wouldve liked the Opposition to resign en masse. We have a controlled Parliament. 

The Establishment, as you put it, may hit back hard at you... 

When driven by a mission, one must be ready for any eventuality. 

Youve got to be happy that the Indo-Pak dialogue has been put back on track... 

As they say, joy-joy is much better than war-war... Im not satisfied with the pace, but the countries are at least willing to talk. 

Who have been your favourite politicians? 

In Pakistan, (Muhammad Ali) Jinnah... He had credibility, was upright... He was in politics for a mission... Outside Pakistan, Ive admired South Africas Nelson Mandela and Malaysias Mahathir Mohamad... More recently, (Venezuelan President) Hugo Chavez as well. 

Chavez for being a US-basher? 

For being such a nationalist... Its undignified to live as a slave-nation... I cant tolerate my country being dictated to by another... How would the Americans react if another country went about dictating policies. 

The final one: Whats your take on our Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh? 

Comes through as mature and weighs everything before making a comment... However, I feel the (Congress-headed) government is vulnerable from the Right and, thereby, refrains from taking truly hard decisions. Mr Singh is probably handicapped as his party isnt in a majority.

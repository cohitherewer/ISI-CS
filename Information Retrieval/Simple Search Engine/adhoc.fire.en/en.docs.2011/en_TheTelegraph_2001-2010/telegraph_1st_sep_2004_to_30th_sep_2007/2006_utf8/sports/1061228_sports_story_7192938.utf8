 For now, Indian hopes on Sachin, Laxman

 - Second Test

 Prince hits fifth century, as South Africa reach 328 

Durban: Sachin Tendulkar was in the middle of his first substantial innings of the tour as India recovered from early jolts to leave the second Test interestingly poised on Day Two here Wednesday. 

The Indians let South Africa off the hook by allowing them to score a competitive 328, built around a fine 121 by Ashwell Prince, before losing three quick wickets in their first innings. 

Tendulkar was unbeaten on 46 when India finished on 103 for three on a day marred once again by bad light. Only 58 overs were possible on the day before bad light sent players off the field, a backlog of 32 overs to go with the 17 missed for similar reason on the first day. 

Tendulkar had only 188 runs from 10 innings on the tour before the match but he sensed his moment on a flat pitch and unfurled some glorious off-drives in compiling 46 from 89 balls with eight fours. 

He had a lucky escape on 21 when Graeme Smith dropped a sitter off Andrew Hall with the total reading 70 for three. 

It completed the frustration of the hosts who needed more than just three Indian wickets to go with their resistance in the morning. 

The wretched form of Virender Sehwag continued unabated as he perished to a first-ball duck while Wasim Jaffer (36) and Rahul Dravid (11) squandered their starts to leave India precariously placed at 61 for three before Tendulkar and VVS Laxman (10 not out) steadied the ship. 

Earlier, resuming at 257 for eight, South African tail wagged for another hour and three quarters before being all out for 328. Prince, unbeaten on 98 overnight, kept appointment with his fifth Test century, and his 121 runs from 316 minutes and off 189 balls, inclusive of 13 fours, was a priceless effort for his side. 

India did not get a breakthrough till they had the second new ball and it was Prince who fell to an uncharacteristic slash off S. Sreesanth, smartly held by Laxman at second slip. 

Another 39 runs came for the last wicket as debutant Morne Morkel put his best foot forward in compiling an unbeaten 31 and allowing even Makhaya Ntini to prosper to the extent of 16 runs. 

Anil Kumble brought an end to the innings with Ntinis scalp but his three wickets paled in comparison to Sreesanths four for 109. Zaheer Khan also impressed, taking two for 83 while VRV Singh ended up with one for 60. 

Day Three will commence half an hour early (at 1 pm IST). (AGENCIES)

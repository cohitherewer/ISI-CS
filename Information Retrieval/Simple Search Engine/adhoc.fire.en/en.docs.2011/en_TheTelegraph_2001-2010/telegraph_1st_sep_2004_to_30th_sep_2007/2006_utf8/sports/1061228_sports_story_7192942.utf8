 Fiasco over Sharma

At lunch time on Wednesday, the Media manager informed that Ishant Sharma was coming to South Africa, according to a message he had received from the BCCIs travel agency. Less than an hour later, he announced that Sharma was not coming. Afterwards, a press release was issued, which reads as follows: 

Initially, Delhi seamer Ishant Sharma was being considered to be drafted into the Indian squad presently in South Africa. This was being done to provide the youngster with the necessary international exposure. 

However, considering his recent Ranji Trophy schedule for Delhi this season it has been now decided not to have him fly down to Cape Town and instead allow him to concentrate in his domestic first-class matches. 

Mr Irfan Pathan will be heading back home on the morning of 28 th December, 2006 from Durban. He will be flying from Durban to Mumbai via Johannesburg.

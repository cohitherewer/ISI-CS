 Mauresmo sweeps past Hingis

Doha: Amelie Mauresmo pummelled Martina Hingis 6-2, 6-2 on Friday to reach the Qatar Open final and move within one victory of the world No. 1 spot. 

Mauresmo, who has already won three titles this year including the Australian Open, will face Russian second seed Nadia Petrova in Saturdays final. 

In their first meeting for nearly five years, the French top seed had too much firepower for her Swiss opponent who returned this season after a three-year retirement. 

Hingis, a former world No. 1, hung on gamely for 2-2 in the first set but once Mauresmos pressure forced a first break of serve the top seed raced away with the opener. 

The first five games of the second set all went against serve and Hingis grad- ually wilted under the onslaught. 

Mauresmo wrapped up victory when her opponent dumped a backhand volley into the net. 

Petrova beat Japans Ai Sugiyama 6-1, 7-6 to reach her first final of the year.

 Quick Takes

 Loew: Kehl injury not serious 

 Frankfurt: An ankle injury 

 to Germany midfielder Sebastian Kehl in Borussia Dortmunds 

 match against Eintracht Frankfurt on Saturday turned out 

 to be less serious than first feared.

 Germany assistant coach Joachim 

 Loew said on Sunday that Kehl had suffered only a strained 

 ligament and not a tear, as first feared. Thats 

 the best news of the day that Sebastian Kehl was not hurt 

 as badly as we first thought, Loew said. He 

 is going to play a big role in our planning.

 The 26-year-old made his comeback 

 for Germany after a long absence in a 4-1 win over the US 

 in March.

 Warm-up cancelled

 Tunis: Tunisias World 

 Cup warm-up against Kuwait has been cancelled after their 

 opponents withdrew, the Tunisian federation said. It said 

 Kuwait had told them they would not be able to assemble 

 a side for the fixture. There was no indication whether 

 Tunisia would seek an alternate opponent.

 Ivory Coast Preparations

 Abidjan: Ivory Coast will 

 prepare for the World Cup in Vittel, France, from May 19 

 to June 4, the Ivorian federation said on Sunday. During 

 this period, the African side will play three friendly internationals 

 against Switzerland in Basel on May 27, Chile on May 31 

 in Vittel and Slovenia in Evry-Bondoufle, near Paris, on 

 June 4.

 Asamoah, Aggogo invited

 Accra: English-based strikers 

 Junior Agogo and Derek Asamoah have both been invited to 

 play for Ghana in a warm-up against Nice on Tuesday. It 

 is a first call-up for the pair by coach Ratomir Dujkovic, 

 seeking striking options in the wake of a potential injury 

 crisis for Ghana.

 Chelsea down Portsmouth

 Shevchenko celebrates after scoring Saturday 

London: Ukraine striker Andriy Shevchenko ended his goal drought for Chelsea with the opening strike in his sides 2-1 victory over Portsmouth that took the champions back to the top of the Premier League on Saturday. 

Shevchenkos first goal in 10 games broke the deadlock 10 minutes after half-time. Germany midfielder Michael Ballack headed the second two minutes later before Zimbabwean forward Benjamin Mwaruwari pulled one back for Pompey. 

Victory sent Jose Mourinhos side three points clear of Manchester United, who play Liverpool in the weekends showcase match at Old Trafford on Sunday. 

Portsmouth made a bright start but keeper David James was soon being kept busy, making fine saves from Dutch winger Arjen Robben and Shevchenko. 

The Ukrainian had a strike disallowed for off-side but couldnt be denied in the 55th minute. His shot took a deflection on its way in off defender Sol Campbell. 

In Saturdays other games, Everton beat 10-man Sheffield United 2-0, Wigan Athletic notched their biggest top-flight win by thrashing Manchester City 4-0 and Charlton Athletic drew Watford goalless in a scrappy game. (Reuters)

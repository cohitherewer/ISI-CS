London: Beaten 2004 finalists Olympique Marseille overcame a shocking blunder by France goalkeeper Fabien Barthez to defeat Bolton Wanderers 2-1 on Thursday and book a place in the last 16 of the Uefa Cup. Favourites AS Roma ousted Club Bruges while 2004 Champions League finalists Monaco were eliminated 1-2 on aggregate by Swiss side Basel. 

Marseille needed Franck Ribery and a Tal Ben Haim own goal to turn around their tie after Barthez had handed Bolton the lead in the tie after a goalless first leg. 

Barthez, sent off in Marseilles 2004 final defeat by Valencia, inexplicably dropped Jay-Jay Okochas cross under no pressure to allow Greece winger Stelios Giannakopoulos to fire the Premier League side ahead midway through the first half. 

Midfielder Ribery headed home Samir Nasris cross in first-half injury time to haul Marseille level and Israeli defender Ben Haim touched Habib Beyes cross into his own net to book Marseille a meeting with Zenit St Petersburg. The Russian side knocked out Norways Rosenborg Trondheim 4-1 on aggregate. 

Roma hardly missed the presence of injured playmaker Francesco Totti, goals from Brazilian Mancini and Cesare Bovo enough to beat Bruges 2-1 at the Olympic Stadium for a 4-2 aggregate victory. 

Serie As in-form side, who could set a league record of 11 successive wins by beating Lazio this weekend, can now look forward to a last-16 tie with Middlesbrough. 

The English side, 2-1 up from the first leg against VfB Stuttgart, conceded an early goal at the Riverside to Christian Tiffert but held out to progress on away goals. 

Swede Daniel Majstorovics second-half goal accounted for Monaco and earned Basel a tie with Racing Strasbourg. Italy striker Christian Vieri had cancelled out Basels advantage from the first leg with a penalty. 

Rapid Bucharest brushed aside goal-shy Hertha Berlin 2-0 to seal a 3-0 aggregate success and a last-16 clash with Hamburg SV. 

Strikers Daniel Niculae and Mugurel Buga netted for Rapid, who began in the first qualifying round back in mid-July and have scored 23 goals to date. Niculae and Buga have hit 13 of them. 

Hamburg skipper Daniel van Buyten notched a first-half double in a 2-0 win over Swiss side Thun, overturning a 1-0 first-leg defeat.

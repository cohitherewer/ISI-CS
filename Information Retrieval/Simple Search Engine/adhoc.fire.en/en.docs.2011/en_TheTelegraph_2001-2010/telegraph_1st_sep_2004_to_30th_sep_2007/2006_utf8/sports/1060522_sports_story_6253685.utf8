 Bernardini (Castellano up).

 Baltimore: Lightly raced Longshot Bernardini easily captured the Preakness Stakes on Saturday after Kentucky Derby winner Barbaro pulled up in the first quarter-mile with a career-ending leg injury.

 Barbaro, tipped by many to become the first Triple Crown winner since 1978, suffered a fracture above and below the ankle in his right hind leg. His career is over. Were looking to try to save him as a stallion, said track veterinarian Larry Bramlage. 

 The horrific injury suffered by Barbaro overshadowed a stunning victory by Kentucky-bred Bernardini and jockey Javier Castellano. Bernardini is owned by the Darley Stable which is operated by Dubais Sheikh Mohammed.

 Bernardini, who did not run in the Kentucky Derby and entered the Preakness with only three career races, saved ground along the rail and swung out four-wide at the quarter-pole.

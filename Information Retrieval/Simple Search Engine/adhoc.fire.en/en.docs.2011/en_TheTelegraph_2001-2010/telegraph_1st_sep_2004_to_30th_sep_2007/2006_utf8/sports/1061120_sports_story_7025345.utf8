 Selector to attend team meetings

- Curbing of captain's power 

Karachi: The Pakistan cricket authorities have rung in a major change in their selection policy in an apparent bid to reduce the powers of the captain and coach. 

Starting from the second Test against the West Indies in Multan, the Pakistan Cricket Board has ensured that a national selector would be present in team meetings for both home and away matches to finalise the playing XI. 

This is a big change from past tradition when the selectors only finalised a squad of 14 to 16 players for a home series or overseas tour and the captain, coach and vice-captain then finalised the playing XI before every match. 

That is changed now. We are following the pattern of other countries. One selector would be present at every team meeting to pick the XI at home and on foreign tours, Saleem Altaf, director, cricket operations, said. 

The move is seen by many people as the first step taken by new chairman Dr Nasim Ashraf to curtail the influence of the captain and coach which have been questioned in recent times after some baffling selection decisions. 

The insistence of Inzamam-ul Haq and Bob Woolmer to ignore leg-spinner Danish Kaneria for the one-day games has drawn allround flak.

 Sachin ready for third phase 

New Delhi: Sachin Tendulkar, currently undergoing rehabilitation following a shoulder surgery, has made satisfactory progress and is now ready for the third phase of the programme. 

The Master Blaster, who has not been included in the squad for the five-match one-day series against the West Indies next month, was assessed by physio John Gloster on Thursday evening who expressed satisfaction over the recovery process. 

He has progressed at a rate anticipated by both the surgeon and myself to this point, BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah quoted Gloster in a press release here on Friday. 

Gloster found that Sachins pain had reduced. Sachin has continued to improve in the following areas ? ranges of active movement, pain levels, day-to-day functions and tissue healing. 

Sachin will now move into phase 3 of his rehab program which will involve increasing further ranges of shoulder movement as well as commencing strengthening activities as tolerated. 

His recovery process will be reviewed again after commencement of phase 4 on April 30, which will give a clearer picture on his availability for the Test series against the West Indies beginning on June 2. 

Sachin was operated upon by noted orthopaedic surgeon Dr Andrew Wallace in London in March. (PTI)

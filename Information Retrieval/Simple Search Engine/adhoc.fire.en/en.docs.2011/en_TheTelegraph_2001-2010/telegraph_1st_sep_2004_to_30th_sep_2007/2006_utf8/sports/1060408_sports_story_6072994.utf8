The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Weather may play spoilsport

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Guwahati: After bad performance, it appears to be the turn of bad weather to torment the visiting England team. A gloomy welcome is what awaits the England team when they arrive here on Saturday to salvage some pride in the now-decided seven match one-day series that has already gone Indias way. 

The mood among fans, as well as the host association turned gloomy on Friday evening after a slight drizzle. Throughout the day, however, the weather was clear and pleasant. In fact, the past week has seen thundershowers. Certainly, the forecast is not good news for England, who are trailing the series 0-4.

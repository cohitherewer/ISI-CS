The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 OC took me to meeting, says Dutta

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: One name appears in common in the two panels that has more or less been finalised on Friday evening ? Nemai Charan Dutta. The Howrah Sporting Club representative, who is also a part of the CAB medical sub-committee, was present during city police commissioner Prasun Mukherjees press conference at the Police AC tent. 

The Officer-in-Charge (OC) of Bowbazar police station is a close friend. I was sitting at the CAB medical room when the OC requested me to accompany him to the meeting of the commissioner of police, Dutta said. 

Both parties told me that they wanted me as vice-president, and I couldnt say no? Now I have to sit down with my club members and decide our representation.

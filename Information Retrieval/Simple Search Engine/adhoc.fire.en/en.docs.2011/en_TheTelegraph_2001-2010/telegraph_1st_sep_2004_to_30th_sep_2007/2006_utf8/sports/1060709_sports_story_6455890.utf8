 Atwal misses cut by 1 shot

Illinois: Daniel Chopra produced a stunning back nine with seven birdies as he shot a five-under 66 and opened up a two-shot lead over Vijai Singh of Fiji at the Western Open here on Friday. 

Chopra, who returned a similar card after the first round, began the day in tied lead with three others. The Indo-Swede went through the front nine in one-over with one bogey and then hit the purple patch beginning with the birdie on tenth. 

He hit seven back-nine birdies and a bogey to be 10-under for 36 holes. Chopra has never won on the US Tour and his best performance this year is a fifth place at Pebble Beach. 

Arjun Atwal missed another cut despite a two-under 69 on the second day. 

He totalled one-over 143 for two days and missed the cut by one shot. He had a three-over on first day. 

World No.3 Singh shot four birdies throughout his round to finish with his second consecutive round of 67 and was two behind Chopra. 

Another playing very well on second day was Stewart Cink, who shot an equal course record 29 on the front nine that included six birdies. 

Cink then fired three more birdies on the back nine, but two bogeys, including one at 18, denied him a share of the course record as he finished with a seven-under 64. 

Tiger Woods rebounded from a rough opening round at the Western Open, but Phil Mickelson struggled. 

Woods shot a four-under 67 during the second round. 

He was seven shots behind leader Chopra. 

Mickelson, who went into the second round one stroke back, shot a three-over 74 and was one-under for the tournament.

 FIA cancels Belgian GP

London: The Belgian Grand Prix has been cancelled this year to allow the Spa track to be improved, FIA, Formula Ones ruling body, said in a statement on Wednesday. 

The race was due to take place on September 17. It had been in doubt for several weeks because of problems over who would promote the race after the previous promoter went bankrupt due to poor ticket sales. 

The Belgian National Sporting Authority, the RACB, has written to notify the FIA of the withdrawal of the 2006 Belgian GP from the F1 World Championship, the statement said. 

The withdrawal has been made in order to allow the completion of extensive improvement work to facilities at the Spa-Francorchamps circuit. (Reuters)

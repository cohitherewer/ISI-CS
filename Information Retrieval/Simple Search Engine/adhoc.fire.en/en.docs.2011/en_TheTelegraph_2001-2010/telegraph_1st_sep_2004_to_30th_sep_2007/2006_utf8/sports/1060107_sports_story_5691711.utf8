 Ponting admonishes McGrath, Lee

 - Its not anything any of those guys or I as captain are proud of... 

Sydney: Skipper Ricky Ponting has admonished his two fast bowlers Glenn McGrath and Brett Lee for being reported on misconduct charges during the feisty final cricket test against South Africa at the Sydney Cricket Ground. 

McGrath was officially reprimanded by Match Referee Chris Broad for using obscene language and Lee was also reprimanded for showing dissent. 

Ponting, who has worked hard to improve Australias on-field behaviour during his time as captain, said it was not acceptable to have the players appearing before a disciplinary hearing. 

Its obviously not ideal. Its not anything, any of those guys or I as captain are proud of thats for sure, Ponting told reporters after Australias eight-wicket win in Sydney Test on Friday. We have worked hard on it over the last couple of years and the guys really pride themselves on what theyve done over the last couple of years. 

Ponting said frustration was at the heart of the disciplinary break-down amid widespread criticism of the performance of match umpires Billy Bowden and Aleem Dar. 

Frustration is the big thing that comes into it. A lot of it is game-related and happens in the heat of battle on the field. A lot of the guys are quite tired at the moment as well, Ponting said. 

Its something we have to look at and talk about theres no doubt about that. As Ive always said its not acceptable that we have guys up on report. Youd like to think that it wont happen again. 

South African coach Mickey Arthur was also hauled before the Match Referee but was found not guilty of criticising of the umpires at a press conference during the Test. 

It was a fiercely-contested match and the umpires had to intervene at one stage on Friday when Justin Langer and Mark Boucher exchanged words in the second over of the Australian second innings. (AFP)

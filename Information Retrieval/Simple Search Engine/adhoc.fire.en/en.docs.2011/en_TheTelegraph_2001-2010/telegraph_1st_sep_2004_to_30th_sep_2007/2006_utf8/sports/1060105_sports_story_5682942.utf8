 Super Aguri may rope in Narain

New Delhi: Narain Karthikeyan was in contention for a Formula One drivers seat with the sports new entrant Super Aguri F1 of Japan, media reports said on Wednesday. 

Aguri were set to get the go ahead from FIA, motorsports world governing body, to field a full-fledged team in 2006. 

Takumo Sato, who was fired by Bar-Honda at the end of 2005 season, was said to have been signed up as the first driver. 

The 29-year old first Indian F1 driver, however, faced stiff competition from many, including Sakon Yamamoto. 

Meanwhile, Williams F1 has confirmed that it could still sign up Karthikeyan for the coming season.

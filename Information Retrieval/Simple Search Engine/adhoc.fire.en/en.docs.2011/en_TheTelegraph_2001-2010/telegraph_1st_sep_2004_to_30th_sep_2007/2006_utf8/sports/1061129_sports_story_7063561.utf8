 Another doping blow for Pak 

Karachi: Pakistan were grappling with a fresh doping scandal just three days ahead of the start of the Asian Games with three of their athletes being dropped from the Doha-bound squad after testing positive for banned substances. 

A Pakistan Olympic Association official on Tuesday said three bodybuilders Atif Anwar Ali, Khalid Ali and Shoaib Zahoor were withdrawn from the Asian Games contingent after the trio tested positive in internal tests conducted by the Pakistan Bodybuilding Federation two weeks ago. 

 The withdrawal comes days after the boxing federation banned Mehrullah Lassi and Faisal Karim from taking part in any international competitions for life after testing positive in SAF Games. (PTI)

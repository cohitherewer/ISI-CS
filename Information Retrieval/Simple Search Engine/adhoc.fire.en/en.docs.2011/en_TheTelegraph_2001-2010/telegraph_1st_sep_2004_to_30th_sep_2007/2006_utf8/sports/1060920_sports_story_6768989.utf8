The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 I would rather be remembered as a team man than an award winner

 Dhoni 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Mahendra Singh Dhoni 

Kuala Lumpur: Sachin Tendulkar is the biggest draw (anywhere in fact), but not too far behind is Mahendra Singh Dhoni, who took time off to speak to The Telegraph. He isnt brooding over not being nominated for the annual ICC awards, rather hes determined (in the short run) to make a splash in the remainder of the tri-series here and the Champions Trophy. 

 The following are excerpts 

 Q Doing well in Sri 

 Lanka was one of your goals for the season. Two tournaments 

 got scrapped there and, so, have you set a fresh goal?

 A The tour to Sri Lanka was important for a number 

 of reasons, chiefly that the experience gained on wickets 

 in the West Indies would have helped as the tracks in Sri 

 Lanka are quite similar... A new goal... Well, doing well 

 in the Champions Trophy... Because it will be at home, theres 

 going to be more pressure and added responsibility. 

 Given that the Champions Trophy 

 is an ICC event and youve been ignored for the ICC 

 awards, will you be looking to make a point in that tournament? 

 There are other things to worry about, not proving 

 a point or two... If anything, I want to keep proving that 

 Im a team man... For me, performing for the team holds 

 more meaning than anything else... I may have different 

 batting positions (in the Champions Trophy), so doing well 

 in each slot is going to be a priority. 

 Frankly, how long did it take 

 you to accept that, despite terrific performances, you hadnt 

 been shortlisted for the ICC ODI Player of the Year award? 

 I felt disappointed, yes, but also looked at it 

 positively... That I hadnt done enough and needed 

 to do more... I had no choice but to accept that Im 

 not on that list... What was to happen had happened and 

 there was no point sulking. I was upset, but briefly. 

 How does a pro overcome disappointment? 

 By looking ahead positively... Its better 

 to focus on things which are in your control... Better to 

 improve things you can do... For me, playing and enjoying 

 cricket is important. Of course, being consistent depends 

 on a number of factors, not just my own will or determination. 

 What do awards mean to you? 

 Let me answer it this way: I would rather be remembered 

 as a team man than an award winner... One likes awards, 

 one likes recognition, but my approach is different... 

 Do you recall the first award 

 you received? 

 (Grins)Probably the one I got for scoring an unbeaten 

 213 (for DAV Shyamli vs KV Hinoo) in the 1997 school league 

 final in Ranchi... That was the time when Id begun 

 playing well and being adjudged MoM meant a lot... I havent 

 forgotten the appreciation from my games teacher and the 

 senior players. 

 Whats your approach? 

 Its simple I try and give off my best... 

 I may not score big, but when I return to the dressing room, 

 I do so with the conviction that I tried my best... That 

 I gave hundred per cent. 

 The tour to Pakistan was your 

 first big one. The West Indies came next. What did you learn 

 in the Caribbean? 

 I learnt or tried to learn on how to bat on 

 slow wickets... Such tracks are, as you know, very difficult 

 for strokemakers... Its important knowing when to 

 take a risk on those wickets. 

 Keeping on those tracks 

 must have been challenging? 

 Yes... One needs time getting used to conditions... 

 It becomes easier when the rhythm is achieved... Usually, 

 mistakes are made at the start of a tour. 

 Did you talk to Jeffrey Dujon? 

 No... 

 Three months later, what are 

 your thoughts on that face-off with Brian Lara 

 in the Antigua Test? 

 Over and done with... However, even now, Im 

 not sure whether I was out or not out... Lara and I have 

 spoken after that, but the disputed catch wasnt brought 

 up... 

 You had to wait 21 months to 

 play your first match against Australia... 

 Its the most talked about team and Id 

 prepared myself for tough times on the field... Its 

 sad that rain didnt allow the match my 50th to 

 go the distance. In cricket, bad days can happen, but one 

 looks to performing well against all teams. Yet, the performance 

 has a special flavour when its against teams such 

 as Australia. 

 Now that youve seen the 

 Australians from close quarters, what makes them tick? 

 Talent and aggression... They back each other, 

 trust each other and, obviously, have enormous self-belief... 

 Your one-on-one with idol Adam 

 Gilchrist has been deferred... 

 It would have been nice to meet him here, but the 

 Champions Trophy isnt far away. 

 Are you, at times, weighed 

 down by expectations? 

 Look, I should be allowed to have my own expectations... 

 I wouldnt like others to set targets for me... Im 

 responsible enough to have expectations befitting my role. 

 I know whats good for me and, more important, good 

 for the team. 

 How are you handling success? 

 My priorities are clear and Im not getting 

 carried away... As for the monetary side, I have a business 

 manager who understands what needs to be done. 

 What has 21 months of international 

 cricket taught you? 

 Batting in different positions, batting in different 

 conditions... Adapting to situations which often vary... 

 Also, taking the best option when faced with a choice. 

 Who do you go to if theres 

 a problem either with your keeping or batting? 

 A lot of my teammates have loads of experience... 

 I go to them... I go to the coach (Greg Chappell)... I have 

 the option of going to former cricketers as well... 

 Many of the current players 

 feel the ones whove retired dont have positive 

 things to say... 

 I cant think of any former player who hasnt 

 extended support... Two years ago, Jawagal Srinath (who 

 had a TV assignment) came to me during an A tournament in 

 Kenya and said I must continue playing the way I was and 

 that I would soon get into Team India. I wont forget 

 his encouragement. 

 Because of the circumstances, 

 are old acquaintances peeved that you cant give them 

 enough time? 

 The reality is that everybody wants a piece of 

 me... My closest friends dont have a problem... I 

 mean, even now, if we want to eat at a particular dhaba, 

 well go there... Only, I cant keep meeting people 

 the whole day... Its unfortunate that when I cant 

 oblige everybody, people turn around and say Dhoni 

 to star ban gaya hai... Surely, I cant 

 become a bad guy if I dont take somebodys call. 

 Basically, Im a shy person. 

 Today, are you thankful to 

 anybody in particular? 

 My parents, coaches whove worked with me 

 in different stages... Central Coalfields, for whom I played 

 for four years... So many, really. 

 Is it tough being a role model? 

 Tough living up to the expectations which, in any 

 case, get decided by others... 

 The final one: Youve 

 grown up hero-worshipping Sachin Tendulkar. What did you 

 feel when he got that superb 141 not out in his comeback 

 innings last week? 

 Its said that if cricket is a religion, 

 then Sachin is God... I was very happy for him... 

 I dont need to say anything more... Ive played 

 50 ODIs and he has got 40 ODI hundreds!

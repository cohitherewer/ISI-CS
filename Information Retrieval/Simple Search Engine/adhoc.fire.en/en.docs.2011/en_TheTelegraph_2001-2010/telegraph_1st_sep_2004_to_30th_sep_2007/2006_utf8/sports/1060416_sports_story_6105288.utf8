 Injury, fatigue bother Aussies

 - The second Test will be harder, feels Whatmore

Chittagong: Australia will be keen to avoid another close tussle against bottom-rung Bangladesh when the second Test begins on Sunday. 

They were lucky to avoid an embarrassing defeat in Fatullah when captain Ricky Ponting dug in to score an unbeaten century, steering his side to a narrow three-wicket victory in the opening match of the two-Test series. 

Injury and fatigue, however, remains a major concern for the visitors. The world champions, in fact, put off naming their XI on Sunday morning to give Shane Warne time to recovery from a sore shoulder. 

We will have to wait until the morning to see Shane bowl in order to determine the team, Ponting said on Saturday. The leggie suffered a sore shoulder in the second innings of the first Test. 

Bangladesh will take a lot of confidence from their performance in the first Test, Ponting said, adding that the wicket in Chittagong would favour the spinners. The Australians had a brief practice session on Saturday afternoon and most bowlers, including Warne, remained at the team hotel. We have been resting so that we are fresh for tomorrow, Ponting said. 

Australia have called left-arm seamer Nathan Bracken and off-spinner Dan Cullen into their squad. 

Bangladesh will now want to keep up the momentum they have gained. 

We are very happy with our performance and we want to improve it further in the second Test, Bangladesh captain Habibul Bashar said. We know that the Aussies will try to come hard on us in the second Test but my past experience says we are going to have another good match in Chittagong. 

Coach Dav Whatmore, though, had a word of caution for his boys. I think the second Test is going to be probably harder than the first test, Whatmore said. Because the first Test gave them a bit of a scare, they are going to come back very hard. It will be the biggest test for us. (Reuters)

 Rathore wins double trap gold

 - ASIAN CLAY SHOOTING 

 Rathore 

Singapore: Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore ensured Indias dominance at the Asian Clay Shooting Championships when he won the double trap event here on Wednesday. 

Rathore notched up an impressive score of 190 out of 200. 

The Indians on Wednesday took their tally of gold medals to four as, apart from Rathores individual feat, they claimed the double trap team gold. 

Rathore said this performance came as a surprise for him. I was really not expecting such a high score, as I was still preparing and it has been a long and busy year with so many competitions, said Rathore, the Athens Olympics silver medallist who also won the Commonwealth Games gold earlier this year. 

The Indian trio of Rathore (142), Ronjan Sodhi (138) and Vikram Bhatnagar (136) grabbed the team gold with 416 points. 

Shih Wei Tin, an Asian Games silver medallist behind Rathore, led Chinese Taipei to silver with 409 points. The UAE, led by individual silver medallist here Saif al Shamsy, took his team to bronze with 406 points. 

The competition was pretty decent with shooters from Qatar and UAE, who are strong in this event, added Rathore. 

Rathore had recently changed his gun and needed some time to adjust to the new one. 

I am slowly getting used to this new gun after the previous one, with which I had won the World Cup in Cairo, got damaged. The score indicates that I am getting comfortable with it, he said. 

Ronjan missed his last bird in the competition to lose out on a medal. He finished at 185, with a fine 47 in the last round. 

A kill in the last shot would have sent him into a shoot-off for silver, but he went into a fight for the bronze with Rashid al Athba and lost.

Jaipur: With logistics being a factor, the International Cricket Council (ICC) hasnt been able to schedule a captains conclave during the Champions Trophy. General manager (cricket) Dave Richardson, though, has begun seeking the views of captains and coaches. 

The last time that the captains got together was in the lead-up to the inaugural Super Test, in Sydney, exactly a year ago. 

Ive already met two captains (Rahul Dravid and Habibul Bashar) and will meet Younis Khan later today... Then, Ive also interacted with some coaches Duncan Fletcher, Dav Whatmore and Bennett King... I expect to have a word with Bob Woolmer, too, before the day is out, Richardson told The Telegraph Sunday. 

According to the former South African wicketkeeper, he has been taking a feedback on matters such as whore the better umpires and Match Referees and whats the general view on the power plays in ODIs. 

The captains and coaches are free to raise any issue and, in time, those are going to be addressed by the ICC... This idea of interacting with the coaches as well has been going off well, Richardson pointed out. 

Richardson will be submitting a report, to the ICC, once this important exercise has been completed.

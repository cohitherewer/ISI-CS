 Mohammed Asif ruled out

 - First test Pak, England seek to tide over multiple injury problems 

 Captains Andrew Strauss and Inzamam-ul Haq with the trophy England and Pakistan will be playing for. The first of four Tests starts at Lords on Thursday 

London: Unbeaten in England for nearly a quarter of a century, Pakistan bring a potpourri of audacity, variety and unpredictability to a four-Test series of critical import for the home side starting at Lords on Thursday. 

The tourists ended Englands prolonged post-Ashes celebrations with a 2-0 home victory late last year. Now they will test to the full Englands resolve and character before the hosts travel to Australia for the Ashes defence this year. 

Much has been made in England of the injuries, which have deprived the side of captain Michael Vaughan, fast bowler Simon Jones and left-arm spinner Ashley Giles for the entire season. 

Vaughan is a non-starter for the Ashes after a fourth operation on his right knee. The other two have made optimistic noises about a return sometime in September although, realistically, their hopes of touring Australia are remote. 

England will also start at least the first Test without Vaughans stand-in Andrew Flintoff, who missed the 0-5 one-day series loss to Sri Lanka with a heel injury. 

Even taking injuries into account the feeling persists that England have under-achieved in their three series since defeating Australia with a lack of concentration and rigour allowing Sri Lanka to seize a 1-1 draw in the most recent encounter. 

After winning the second Test, England lost seven matches in a row to the Sri Lankans and their bowling in the one-day series was an embarrassment with the spearhead Steve Harmison conceding 97 from his 10 overs in the final match. 

Harmison, who missed the three-Test series against Sri Lanka with sore shins, is one player with no intention of playing the injury card. 

We can make as many excuses as we want about injuries but I think its time we put them to bed, he told a news conference on Tuesday. We need to stop making excuses. 

Harmisons role at the ground where he unsettled the Australians last year with his pace and bounce becomes even more important if Matthew Hoggard is unable to take the field. 

Hoggard had six stitches in his right hand after a teammate trod on it at the weekend and will test his fitness in the nets on Wednesday morning. 

We are giving him as long as possible to prove his fitness, captain Andrew Strauss said. He had a useful workout in the nets today. We have to see how he comes through tomorrow morning. It may be that tonight we can make a decision but it may not be, Strauss said. 

Im not a big fan of Lords, Harmison said. I never feel comfortable bowling here. But Ive always been successful here. 

Jon Lewis, a similar type of bowler to Hoggard with his reliance on late outswing, is in the squad as a potential replacement while Ian Bell has been recalled to bat at No. 6 in place of Flintoff. 

Bell will share the fifth bowlers duties with Paul Collingwood. 

Pakistan, who have not lost a series in England since 1982, also have injury problems. 

Pakistan lost their third paceman when Mohammed Asif was ruled out with an elbow injury. 

Asif, who took 17 wickets on the recent two-test tour of Sri Lanka, joins Shoaib Akhtar (ankle injury) and Rana Naved-ul Hasan (groin) on the sidelines after a cortisone injection failed to ease the complaint. 

He hasnt reacted properly to an injection so he will be out, coach Bob Woolmer told reporters on Wednesday. 

Woolmer said opening batsmen Shoaib Malik, who also had a cortisone injection for a similar injury, was doubtful for the first match in the four-Test series. 

There is still plenty of talent among the remaining bowlers with leg-spinner Danish Kaneria relishing the chance to play in the latter part of the English season when the pitches are drier and offer most assistance to the spinners. 

Pakistans strength lies in their batting. Inzamam-ul Haq averaged over a hundred in the last series with a lowest score of 53 and two centuries in the second Test.

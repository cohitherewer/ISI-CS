 Quick Takes

 Becks gets some retail therapy

 London: Expect to see 

 David Beckham, the England captain, in a range of snappy 

 new outfits before the World Cup. The Real Madrid player, 

 never knowingly undersold on high fashion items, was in 

 Yves St Laurent in London last week doing his World 

 Cup shopping. 

 While the retail therapy habits 

 of his wife, Victoria, usually provoke comment, his bill 

 of ?9,500 was enough to attract attention. When he will 

 find time to sport YSL labels when his sponsor, Adidas, 

 is paying for the exposure is another question. 

 No change in design

 Amsterdam: Nike is not 

 planning to make any changes to the design of its 90 

 Supremacy football shoe, which England striker Wayne 

 Rooney was wearing when he broke his foot last week.

 Responding to intense media scrutiny 

 from the British press, and Manchester United manager Alex 

 Fergusons request that Nike take another look at the 

 boot to make sure that it did not play any part in the injury, 

 Nike said it was not to blame for Rooneys multiple 

 bone fractures. I think it is very convenient to blame 

 the shoe, a Nike spokesman said. If he hurt 

 his hamstring we would not be talking about the shorts he 

 was wearing.

 Germany squad on D-day

 Frankfurt: Germany coach 

 Juergen Klinsmann will announce his squad for the World 

 Cup on May 15, at 1100 GMT in Berlin, the German association 

 announced on Thursday. May 15 is the deadline for the 32 

 teams to name their 23-man squads.

 Terry cleared

 London: England defender 

 John Terry has been given the all-clear for the World Cup 

 after a scan on his injured ankle. He needed three stitches 

 in a cut just above his ankle after a tackle from Rooney 

 during Saturdays defeat of Manchester United. He also 

 twisted the ankle later in the game. 

 Albright in

 Hartford: Chris Albright 

 will replace injured Frankie Hejduk in the US squad for 

 the World Cup. Hejduk, a member of the 1998 and 2002 squads, 

 suffered a cruciate ligament injury at the weekend. Albright, 

 27, has one goal in 19 appearances for the US. This will 

 be his first Cup.

 Lalit Modi case

Jaipur: The Rajasthan High Court has stayed an arbitrators award of last year that gave Lalit Modi a clean chit in a moral turpitude case filed in the US and allowed him to hold the post of Rajasthan Cricket Association president. 

The court issued its order while allowing a petition filed by former BCCI treasurer Kishore Rungta on the alleged illegality of the award of arbitrator justice (retired) R.P. Saxena. 

Rungta alleged that the arbitrator was biased in favour of Modi and his award needed to be stayed.

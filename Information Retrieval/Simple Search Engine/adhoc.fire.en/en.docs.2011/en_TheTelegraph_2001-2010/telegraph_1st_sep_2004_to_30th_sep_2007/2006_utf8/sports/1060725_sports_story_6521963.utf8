 Sania slips to 42nd spot

New Delhi: Sania Mirzas first quarter final appearance on the WTA Tour this season was not of much help to the Indian tennis icon as she slipped two places to be 42nd in the latest rankings on Monday. 

Sania had lost to top seed Patty Schnyder in the quarter final of Cincinnati Open. 

US-based Shikha Uberoi was placed 171st, while Delhis Ankita Bhambri was at 345th. 

Sanias feat of reaching finals in Cincinnati with Marta Domachowska resulted in a career-best 31 in doubles. She was 33rd last week. 

Harsh Mankad scaled 109 places to displace Rohan Bopanna as the top ranked Indian, being 287th. Bopanna and Karan Rastogi are at 298th and 344th. In doubles, Leander Paes stayed at 14th while Mahesh Bhupathi climbed one to 23rd, Bopanna was 141st.

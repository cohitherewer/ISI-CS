 May issues drugs alert

London: International cricketers may be forced to resort to performance-enhancing drugs because of the number of matches they are now obliged to play, according to the Federation of International Cricketers Associations (FICA). 

FICA chief executive Tim May told a magazine the ICCs Future Tours Programme was a disaster. There are five or six guys in the five leading sides in the world who play Tests and one-day Internationals and they are being flogged, the former Australia off-spinner said. (Reuters)

New Delhi: The AIFF on Thursday effectively dismissed Syed Nayeemuddin along with manager PK Banerjee, goalkeeping coach Atanu Bhattacharya and assistant coach Gabriel Joseph for Indias poor performances in the recent Asian Cup qualifying matches. 

Nayeemuddin has a contract with the AIFF till the Doha Asian Games (December 7-22) on a salary of Rs 1.30 lakh per month. According to sources, the AIFF is likely to give him two months salary before terminating his contract as per the exit clause. 

In a carefully-worded press release, the federation has made it clear that Nayeems successor will be a foreigner. The performance of the national team (in the Asian Cup) was reviewed. Considering the preparation of the Indian team in the Asian Games, it was decided to reorganise the technical team of the AIFF and approach Fifa and AFC for a suitable foreign coach. 

Later, AIFF general secretary Alberto Colaco said the new coach will take over in June. The national teams next engagement is the four-nation Vancouver meet from July 20. The camp for this meet will begin on June 15 and the new foreign coach is expected to join before that. 

This is the second time in six months the AIFF has changed the national coach. Sukhwinder Singh, who was first appointed till the Asian Games, was removed in October 2005 after India lost two friendly series against Pakistan and Fiji. The Nayeemuddin-PK Banerjee combination, which was then appointed after an elaborate selection process, lasted only five months. 

Nayeem refused to react. I havent got any intimation yet. Ill only speak on the matter after getting the AIFF letter, he said when contacted on his cellphone. 

PK also refused to comment.

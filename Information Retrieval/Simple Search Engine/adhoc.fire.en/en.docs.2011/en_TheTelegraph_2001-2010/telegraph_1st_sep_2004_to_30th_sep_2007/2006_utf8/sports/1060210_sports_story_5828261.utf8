 Sourav to skip first match

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: After putting up a good show in the Ranji Trophy, Bengal stand-in captain Deep Dasgupta seemed upbeat about Bengals chances in not only the zonal meet which starts from Saturday, but also the upcoming national one-dayers. 

The 14-member Bengal squad ? without former India captain Sourav Ganguly ? left for Dhanbad on Thursday evening. Just before leaving, Dasgupta said Sourav would decide his own batting position. 

It is up to Sourav to decide which slot he wants to bat in. 

I will be more than happy if he opens the innings for us, Deep answered when asked about Souravs chances of coming at the top of the order. 

The man who scored over 10,000 ODI runs for India, most of those while opening, will make things easier for us if decides to come at the top of the order, Deep stated. 

Meanwhile, Arindam Das has been drafted in as the 15th member in the lung opener against Tripura on Saturday. It has been learnt that Das was included after Sourav expressed his inability to take part in the first game, citing personal reasons. 

Though the team composition hasnt been decided yet, it is almost sure that Das would open the innings on Saturday. 

Though as of now Sourav is expected to the join the squad on Sunday, a day before Bengals second outing against Jharkhand, CAB may keep Das till the end of the meet despite the BCCIs rule of a 14-member squad.

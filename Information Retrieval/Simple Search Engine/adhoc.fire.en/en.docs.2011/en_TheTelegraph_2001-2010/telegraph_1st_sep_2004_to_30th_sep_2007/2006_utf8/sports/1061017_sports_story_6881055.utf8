The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Were on the same side as the BCCI: Speed

 - Nobody, in fact, has suggested that Azharuddin cant be felicitated alongside other Indian captains 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Jaipur: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has been going hammer and tongs at the International Cricket Council (ICC) over the Members Participation Agreement for all events from after the 2007 World Cup till 2015, but the world body chief executive Malcolm Speed cut a sober picture Monday evening. 

Were on the same side as the BCCI... We just want to put together an agreement to sell the commercial rights for our tournaments... Were willing to talk with the BCCI, but our only point is that the reservations shouldve been conveyed much earlier than the last days of September, Speed remarked. 

He added that the other Test-playing nations had already thrashed out misgivings if any. 

Speed, in fact, went to the extent of saying the draft of the Agreement placed fewer restrictions on players than the one signed for events from 2000 till the 2007 World Cup. This one is more lenient, he insisted. 

Taking a swipe at BCCI vice-president Lalit Modi, he said: Mr Modi has been a vice-president for a year, but he hasnt attended a single meeting of the ICC... He has opinions, but I would rather hear facts... The ICC isnt like the East India Company, which was driven by profit... Also, the ICC is for all 97 members, not just for India... Its a members organisation. 

Speed acknowledged that the draft included a clause allowing for the Agreement to be changed, but made the point it could only be done with the consent of seven Full (Test-playing) members. Basically, that nothing can be done arbritrarily. 

According to one of The Telegraphs sources, the BCCI probably intends nominating a committee to thrash things out with the ICC. 

Speed, meanwhile, spoke on a number of issues. Among other things, he accepted that the controversial Darryl Hair was to have been on the umpires panel for the Champions Trophy. 

Here goes: 

On Hair figuring in the Media guide 

Thats because it was printed well before the tournament (and before the ICC announced the umpires panel)... Hairs future is going to be discussed during the November 3-4 Executive Board meeting in Mumbai... Its on the agenda. 

[The BCCI, it may be recalled, had requested the ICC to keep the Australian away.] 

On whether he will attend the BCCIs function on November 4, where the banned Mohammed Azharuddin is among the invitees 

Its well known that we have zero tolerance towards corruption... I cant say whether Im going to be there... Nobody, in fact, has suggested that Azharuddin cant be felicitated alongside other Indian captains... 

On former BCCI president Inderjit Singh Bindras call for an end to Azhars life ban 

Theres a procedure to be followed, not raising it through the Media... The BCCI has imposed the ban and it will have to approach the ICC if it wants it to be revoked. 

On the tainted Herschelle Gibbs being allowed to play 

Well he was banned and fined (by South Africa) in 2000... Each case must be seen independently... 

On whether the BCCI, which is a member of the ICC, can bid for the world bodys commercial rights 

Its one of the things to be deliberated upon in Mumbai (November 3-4).

 Alok knocks out Advani

New Delhi: Former Asian champion Alok Kumar was the only Indian left in fray after both former world champion Pankaj Advani and Aditya Mehta bowed out in the pre-quarter finals of the IBSF World Snooker Championships in Pontins, Wales. 

Alok, in fact, crushed the in-form Advani 5-1, while Mehta went down to home favourite and top seed David Donovan 3-5 late on Tuesday night. 

The veteran Indian will now face Gavin Pentall of Wales for a place in the last four, according to informa-tion received here on Wednesday. 

Earlier, Alok defeated Mark Joyce of England 8-3 and Advani came back from a two-frame deficit to pack off Po-hsein Lee of Chinese Taipei 5-2 in the round of 32.

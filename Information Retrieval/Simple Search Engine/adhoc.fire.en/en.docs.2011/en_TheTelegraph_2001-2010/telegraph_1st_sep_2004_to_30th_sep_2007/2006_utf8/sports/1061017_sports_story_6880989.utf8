The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 I dont think its going to affect Pak: Gilchrist

OUR CORRESPONDENT IN MUMBAI AMP; AGENCIES

Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Asifs scandal evoked mixed reactions. The following are some of the views (alphabetically): 

STEPHEN FLEMING: Like all other sports in New Zealand, cricket also falls under WADA. We are aware of the implications, and subsequently have taken steps to check such a menace. 

ADAM GILCHRIST: All of us know what is to be used and what is to be prohibited. We have endured the shock and trauma of what Pakistan are going under. But I dont think its going to affect them enormously. I can give our own example. Just before the 2003 World Cup, we lost Shane Warne on similar grounds. But we rallied behind each other, remained unbeaten throughout the tournament and eventually won it. So, I feel every Pakistani player will rally around captain Younis Khan and they will be determined to make an impact in this Champions Trophy. 

RASHID LATIF: The board has done the right thing. It was no use trying to hide the results of the tests they conducted before the tournament. But now they must try to find out the truth behind why these players tested positive for a banned substance and whether they took it accidentally or wilfully. 

JAVED MIANDAD: I have always said the board should never compromise on discipline. Players have in recent years been allowed to do what they like and that is why we have had so many incidents which dont reflect well on our cricket. No one is bigger than the game.

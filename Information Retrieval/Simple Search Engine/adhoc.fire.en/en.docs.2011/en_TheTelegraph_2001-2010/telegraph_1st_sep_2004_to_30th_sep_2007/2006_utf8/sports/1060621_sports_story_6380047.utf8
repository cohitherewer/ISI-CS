 Spain determined not to die a premature death

 On Target

 Shyam Thapa

Amid the hype surrounding Brazil and glow around Argentina, one team ? almost unnoticed ? looks set to give the title-aspirants a real run for their money. Spain have always flirted with their pre-tournament favourites tag, but this World Cup may tell a different story. Luis Aragones side doesnt seem to have come in Germany to die a premature death. 

Team game is a nice phrase but its difficult to deliver. I feel after Argentina, Spain look to be the most organised unit. They crushed Ukraine 4-0 in the first match and on Monday night, they came from behind to put Tunisias aspirations in perspective, winning 3-1. 

Riding an early goal by Joahar Mnari, Tunisia held their fort against the rampaging Spaniards till the 71st minute and must have thought of scripting an upset against the rivals, who have all along been accused of being perennial underachievers. 

But the twin substitutions in the second-half ? Raul and Fabregas coming in place of Luis Garcia and Marcos Senna, respectively ? provided the spark the Spanish attack was looking for. Raul proved to be the lucky charm for his team once again, snapping up the rebound after Fabregas shot was partially parried by the Tunisian keeper Ali Boumnijel in the 71st minute. 

Fabregas again laid the foundation for the second goal. The great move started with right back Sergio Ramos in the deep. The Arsenal player delivered a brilliant through for an advancing Fernando Torres, who rounded the keeper and coolly steered it into the empty net. 

Torres was at it again when he earned a penalty and converted it in stoppage time. 

This dramatic turnaround in a space of just 19 minutes was, in essence, based on a harmony that existed in the Spanish game ? from the defence to the midfield and to the forwardline. If Argentina had played 24 passes in scoring a goal, Spain also played 17-18 passes in their build-up to few of their innumerable forays into the opposite box. Add to this, the beautiful exchange of places among players, timely delivery of balls and throughs for the forwards. 

Against both Ukraine and Tunisia, Spain have shown character and fighting spirit. . 

Tunisia ? 2004 African champions ? were lucky as much to get the eighth-minute goal and survive the wave of Spanish attacks till the 71st minute. But for the brilliant Boumnijel under the Tunisian bar, Torres could have easily got his hattrick and Spain would have surpassed the 6-0 scoreline Argentina achieved. 

If Raul represents past glory, Torres seems to have a bright future. His opportunism, sudden turns and scent for goal, all lead to a great promise. He can be a terror to any defence. Spains progress in the tournament will hinge on how Torres copes with the pressure.

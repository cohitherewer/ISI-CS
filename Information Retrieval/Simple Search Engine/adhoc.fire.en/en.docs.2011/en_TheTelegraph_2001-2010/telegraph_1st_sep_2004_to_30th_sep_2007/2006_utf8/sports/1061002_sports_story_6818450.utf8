Chennai: India Red fringe players taught a lesson to their seniors, India Blue, in achieving a 21 run victory with 15 balls to spare in their first match of the Challenger Series for the N.P.K. Salve Trophy at the M.A. Chidambaram Stadium on Sunday night. 

 India Blue needed 281 to win but the match was virtually put beyond their grasp by the 21st over with top four batsmen back in the pavilion. However, Yuvraj Singh and Dinesh Mongia took up the revival act for about 19 overs. But after a while, the duo failed to stick to their goals and Blue rsquo;s chances of winning evaporated.

 Irfan Pathan (19), Ravindra Jadeja (11) were run out and Ajit Agarkar (6) and Harbhajan Singh were out cheaply to give victory to India Red. Vikram Rajvir Singh (3/49) was the most successful bowler for India Red.

 Earlier, centurion Gautam Gambir (110, 4x10, 6x1) and Red captain Venugopal Rao (67, 4x9) helped India Red to make 280 all out in 50 overs after opting to bat. For the Blue, Pathan (3/55), Munaf Patel (3/49) and Agarkar (2/57) shared the wickets. 

 Nothing about the first 10 overs of the Blue rsquo;s innings hinted at the glut of runs that was to follow, as Kartik and Ramesh Powar bowled good first spells of three overs each and stemmed the flow of runs. Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag were scoring at a brisk pace, at seven runs an over. But, they had to change gear adding only 24 runs in the next six overs with the spinners operating from the ends. 

 In fact, Sehwag seemed to have injured his ankle while turning around for a second run in the 13th over when his score was 23 and he had on-field medical attention. Tendulkar, who was not resilient but was looking to be aggressive, had reached his fifty, 36 runs of it coming through fours and sixes (6 fours and 2 sixes) off 54 balls. 

 Meanwhile, Delhi batsman Mithun Manhas has taken Wasim Jaffer rsquo;s place in the India Blue squad. Jaffer had been moved to the India Green squad in place of V.V.S. Laxman, who pulled out due to a hamstring injury, national selection committee chairman Dilip Vengsarkar said.

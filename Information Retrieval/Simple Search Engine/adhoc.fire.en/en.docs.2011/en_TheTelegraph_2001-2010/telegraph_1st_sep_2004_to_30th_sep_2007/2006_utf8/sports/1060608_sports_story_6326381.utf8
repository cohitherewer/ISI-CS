 Brian Lara recorded the 16th duck of his career in his 125th 

 Test. It was his third against India in 14 Tests, the bowlers 

 to dismiss him being Sreesanth in St Johns on Tuesday, 

 Manoj Prabhakar in Mumbai, 1994-95 and Jawagal Srinath in 

 Georgetown, 2001-02

 Anil Kumbles 4/107 was the best by an Indian bowler 

 at the Antigua Recreation Ground (ARG). Left-arm spinner 

 Sunil Joshi got 3/76 during the 1996-97 series

 Mahendra Singh Dhonis six dismissals (5 caught, 1 

 stumped) in the drawn Test equalled Kiran Mores effort 

 in Port-of-Spain, 1988-89, for the most dismissals by an 

 Indian keeper in a Test on Caribbean soil

 The West Indies 298/9 was the second-best fourth innings 

 total at the ARG. The highest was the world record winning 

 total of 418/7 by the home side against Australia in 2002-03

 The last time any team made 300-plus runs against India 

 in the fourth innings was Australia ? 357/6 in Sydney, 2003-04

 This was Indias fourth draw in as many Tests at this 

 venue. The two other away grounds where India 

 have not lost a Test are Georgetown (8 draws) and Auckland 

 (2 wins and 2 draws)

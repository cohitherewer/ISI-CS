Calcutta: With all events getting delayed following the opening ceremony of the 56th State Athletics Championships, Soma Biswas had to endure a long wait. When the womens shot put event finally got underway, the star athlete was slow to get into her rhythm. 

The best she managed was 12.53 metres, and it wasnt enough for a victory. Archana Mondal beat Soma to that honour, with a heave of 12.98. 

Shot put is not Somas favourite event. The fact that she has gone above this distance just once proves it. So it was hardly a debacle as she geared up for the Asian Games qualification meets to be held in the next two months. But for Archana, it counted as a major success, having come against an Asian Games gold-medallist. 

Archana apart, Manisha Dey, Jhuma Khatun and Sibani Bhumij grabbed honours on Day I. The trio battled a slippery track and damp field to rewrite meet records in their respective events. 

Manisha did 13.03 metres in triple jump to better the previous mark of 12.86. Second-placed Kalpana Das was way behind at 12.30. 

Jhuma won the 1500 metres in the girls U-20 category, clocking 4 minutes, 35.1 seconds. Her timing clipped off more than seven seconds off the previous record. 

Sibani topped the girls Under-20 triple jump with an effort of 12.06 metres, eclipsing the mark of 11.58. 

Earlier, West Bengal Athletics Association president Prasun Mukherjee said after inaugurating the meet that an East Zone Championship is being planned next month.

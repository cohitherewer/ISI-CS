 The real test for West Indies

 - First ODI

 - Ramesh Powar out; Sreesanth hasnt recovered from heel 

 injury 

 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Kingston: With the flying time no more than 20 minutes, Rahul Dravid may not have flipped through Air Jamaicas in-flight magazine on the trip back from Montego Bay late on Tuesday. If the Team India captain did, he couldnt have missed the las lick column. 

It began: Cricket and music have much in common ? pitch, movement, swing and beat, although recently beat is something that has been happening to the West Indies team rather regularly... 

The issue hit the seat pockets before Brian Laras men decimated Zimbabwe 5-0, but even the most passionate in these parts appreciates that thrashing Zimbabwe cant figure very high on anybodys CV. So, till Laras men lick a formidable opposition, that las lick column wont have to be rewritten. That theyre currently placed just above Zimbabwe and Bangladesh in the ICCs one-day rankings is a pointer to how much catching up has to be done by the one-time unbeatables. 

For the record, the No. 3 position is Indias. 

The reinstated Lara, who greeted Dravid affectionately before a Media session organised by series sponsors Digicel, accepted that the real test would begin at Sabina Park here. He was quick to add history suggests odds favour the West Indies. 

Indeed, he also remarked winning could be contagious and indicated going for a settled team rather than experimenting. 

While the West Indies whipped a weak Zimbabwe, the Indians thrashed a weakened Jamaica Cricket Association XI in the tour-opener. Yet, as Dravid explained, it was a good workout and the intensity pleased him. There have, after all, been instances of side matches being taken lightly. 

That, then, is the back-drop to the five-match face-off which gets underway on Thursday. The Sabina Park wicket wont be as fast and bouncy as in the Seventies and Eighties, when it was often terrifying, but those in the know insist it still is the quickest in the Caribbean. 

The Indians, incidentally, have never played a one-dayer here. Now, they will be featuring in two over three days. Fingers, though, are crossed over the weather. The forecast wasnt available with the Jamaica Cricket Association, but it rained around breakfast and towards lunch on Wednesday. 

Owing to the World Cup-related construction, Sabina Park doesnt have practice facilities. As for the alternative of the day, Melbourne Cricket Club, rain hampered a proper session there. The quicks, by the way, had a day off bowling. 

In keeping with his stand since he got the captaincy full time, last October, Dravid maintained were looking to improve as a team and more than suggested he would continue to open till Sachin Tendulkar returned after his latest surgery. 

Could the fact that only six (Virender Sehwag, Harbhajan Singh, Ajit Agarkar, Mohammed Kaif, Yuvraj Singh and the captain himself) of the 15 have toured the West Indies before actually be an advantage? Dravid replied: Possibly, as they arent carrying the history of the earlier tours... 

While India (under Sourav Ganguly) won the ODIs in 2002, the last Test series win was as far back as 1971. 

Dravid didnt dwell much on the hosts. He said: I focus on my team... Look after my team... However, I do know the West Indies are good and are going to be competitive. 

Meanwhile, according to The Telegraphs sources, Mohammed Kaif is set to make a comeback. That he scored 49 in Montego Bay has helped. In any case, Dravid and coach Greg Chappell have been backing him consistently. 

Had offie Ramesh Powar not hurt himself on Monday, then Yalaka Venugopal Rao would have been dropped. Many hours from the match, though, it seems he will keep his place and the Indians could (out of compulsion) field just four specialist bowlers. 

Its going to be a tricky call. 

Im not in pain... Abhi kuch dard nahin hai, Powar remarked as he headed for breakfast at the Hilton. The team management, however, doesnt want to risk aggravating the injury to his tightly strapped right ankle. 

Sreesanth, one learns, hasnt recovered from the soreness on his left heel. He participated in a beach session for the quicks, on Wednesday morning, but has been advised not to rush things. The Kochiite is far too valuable. 

So, two first XI players wont be there in match No. 1.

 Captainspeak

 The following are excerpts from 

 what the captains said, in Kingston, on Wednesday morning: 

 Rahul Dravid: Were constantly looking to improve... Weve got a young crop of fast bowlers and, within a few months, they should be more experienced... Im excited about them... We would like to get some wins under our belt early on... Weve tried to be flexible and there could be a time when the openers will bat at No. 5/6 to get a feel of the situation which prevails then... Im enjoying the captaincy... It has its challenges and its tough days... 

 Brian Lara: India have the talent and even without their premier batsman (Sachin Tendulkar) are still a force... The true competition is going to be against India, but the series versus Zimbabwe was important from the point of view of confidence... Im 90 per cent happy with our disciplines... Weve been rotating players and that has been helpful... Good teams rest the key ones... Its important to start on a winning note...

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 When Sachin met Lahore da Salman

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Lahore: Sachin Tendulkar didnt reveal if hes a Salman Khan fan, but he probably wont forget the Bollywood stars young namesake (whom he met at the Shaukat Khanum Cancer Hospital) in a hurry. 

The Lahore da Salman, as it turned out, is a big Sachin admirer. In fact, he got so overwhelmed on seeing the icon, that he blurted I want to meet Sachin Tendulkar! It took him time to realise a dream had come true. 

I chatted with Salman for a couple of minutes... I know hes ill, but that I could give him some joy made me happy, too, Sachin, brand ambassador for Mumbai-based charity Apnalaya, told The Telegraph on coming out of the chemotherapy and paediatric wards. 

[One Irfan, by the way, only wanted to meet Irfan Pathan and the introduction was done by Imran Khan.] 

Sachin has been interacting with children who are either terminally ill or handicapped in some manner, fairly regularly, but he still found Wednesday afternoons experience moving. As he put it: It wasnt the same as any other outing... 

While on hospitals, Sachin has arranged free treatment (including bypass) at the Care Hospital in Hyderabad for all state-level sportspersons. When they (Care Foundation) approached me to get involved with the project, I laid a pre-condition ? Im happy they accepted the free treatment bit, he said. 

Sachin hasnt just been accumulating runs.

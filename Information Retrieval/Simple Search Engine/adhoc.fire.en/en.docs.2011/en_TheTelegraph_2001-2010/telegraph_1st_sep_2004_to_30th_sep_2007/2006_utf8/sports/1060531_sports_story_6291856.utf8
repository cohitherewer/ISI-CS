 Giri upsets Arghyadip

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Chess for Youth Meet

 Calcutta: Unfancied Indradeep 

 Giri caused a major upset in the Premiere section beating 

 third seed National A player Arghyadip Das of Railways on 

 the opening day of Karvy the Interpolis Chess for Youth 

 meet organised by Dibyendu Barua Chess Academy at Netaji 

 Indoor Stadium here on Tuesday.

 The top seed, IM Abhijit Gupta 

 of Rajasthan was held by Bengal sub-junior champion Debaditya 

 Sinha Biswas. Debaditya, in fact, was in a clearly better 

 position in the end game but time pressure forced him to 

 settle for a draw.

 Former world U-12 champion, Deep 

 Sengupta, too, survived a scare against Debayan Majumder 

 and was lucky to win from an inferior position. 

 In the U-16 section, all the seeded 

 players won their respective games with ease and have two 

 points to their credit.

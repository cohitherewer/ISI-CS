Mumbai: Come on Mario, you can do it, screamed the teenagers who made up the majority of the half-filled centre court stadium at the CCI on Thursday evening. 

Poor Stefano Galvani must have felt like an alien from Mars. The more the Italian pushed second seed Mario Ancic, the louder the chants grew. With the marathon second set getting too close for comfort, Ancic needed all of that vociferous support. 

No wonder the popular Croat made it a point to thank the crowd during the on-court interview after the 6-1, 7-6 (8-6) win which took him to the Kingfisher Airlines Open quarter finals. 

Ancic, playing only his second tournament after a 10-week injury-induced lay-off, had problems in the second set against the same rival in Beijing two weeks ago. All credit to him (Galvani) for pushing me in the second set today also Glad the match didnt go to a third set, said Ancic. 

Tommy Robredos problems came in the first set, but the top seed managed to fix them in time to make the last eight. Left-handed Michael Berrer, a German with a mere five career wins on the Tour, was the one to give the world No. 7 a scare before bowing out 7-5, 2-6, 4-6. 

Earlier in the evening, Dmitry Tursunov came through a roller-coaster ride which saw his tennis swing from the mediocre to sublime. The fourth seed ultimately shut out Kristian Pless 6-7 (5-7), 6-3, 6-4 in an hour and 50 minutes. 

Tursunov faces British qualifier James Auckland who packed off No. 8 seed Wesley Moodie 7-6 (7-3), 7-6 (7-5) in a match-up between two big servers. For the record, Auckland belted 16 aces and Moodie 15, with neither dropping serve. 

Third seed Tomas Berdych came through a tight two-setter against German Simon Greul to set up a clash with Bjorn Phau. I was feeling a bit under the weather playing on successive days, was how the talented Czech explained his below-par 7-6 (7-4), 6-4 performance. 

Juan Marin del Potro, the giant teenager who stunned Carlos Moya two days ago, attracted a decent crowd on court No. 1. But the Argentine, up against 126th-ranked Ramon Delgado, conceded the match after vomiting on court and taking a medical time-out. He was down 3-6, 1-4 and decided to hand victory to Delgado. 

Tursunov, who had been stretched by 16-year-old Indian Akash Wagh in Round I, played at two distinctly different levels. One in which he outplayed his Danish opponent with steady serving and some stinging backhand returns, the other which saw him lose focus and commit a slew of errors. 

Going a break up in the third game, Tursunov seemed to be cruising in the first set when he handed Pless the breakback with three unforced errors in game 8. Tursunov then managed to stave off two set-points. The Russian fought off two more two set-points in the tie-break before Pless closed it out thanks to a net-cord. 

Tursunov tightened up considerably in the second set, serving flawlessly. The fact that Pless couldnt win a point in four of his opponents five service games tells its own story. 

With Pless, a former world No. 1 junior, getting increasingly bothered by some close line calls, the task got easier for Tursunov in the decider. The Dane, who got warned for racket abuse, still kept up the fight before succumbing on the third match-point. 

The Leander Paes versus Mahesh Bhupathi clash, scheduled for Friday, got postponed by a day as the German duo of Denis Gremelmaye and Greul which was in their half withdrew. The winners of Saturdays Paes-Aisam Qureshi versus Bhupathi-Ancic match will now advance straight to the final.

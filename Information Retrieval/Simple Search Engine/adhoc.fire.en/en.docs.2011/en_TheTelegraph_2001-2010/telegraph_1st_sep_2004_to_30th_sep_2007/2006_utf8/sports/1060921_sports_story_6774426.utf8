 Hingis: A match of ups-and-downs

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The first-round match against Melinda Czink had been a cakewalk for Martina Hingis. 

Not the second, where she had to fight for every point. She eventually did come up triumphs, defeating Israels Tzipora Obziler 6-2, 7-5. 

It was a match of ups-and-downs, concedes Hingis at the post-match press meet. I was just not being able to close the match out. I finally managed to break her and am happy to have won. The games were long. I was trying to keep up the intensity. Obziler doesnt miss many easy points. 

The last game was almost perfect. Why doesnt it happen like that all the time? wonders Hingis, adding, That is a question which is better discussed over a drink. 

And what about her quarter final rival Tamarine Tanasugarn? I have played against her a couple of times and have been successful so far. Shes played three-setters in both her first and second rounds So may be shell be a little tired too. grins Hingis. 

Yes, who wouldnt want to win another Grand Slam, she answers to a query, But I still have a long way to go. Remember, there are eight girls above me. The immediate aim is to enjoy everytime I go on court. 

How was her experience at the Missionaries of Charity? You know, visiting places like the Missionaries of Charity help you put life into perspective. For instance, I play tennis and my life revolves around it. But it is also necessary to think outside the box. And do your bit.

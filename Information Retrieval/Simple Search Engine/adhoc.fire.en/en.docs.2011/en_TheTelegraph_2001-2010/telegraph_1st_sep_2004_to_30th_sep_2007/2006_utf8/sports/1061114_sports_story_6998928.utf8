 Lukewarm response to Pak seminar

Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Boards (PCBs) plans to hold a seminar for formulating a strategy for the World Cup and inviting suggestions to reorganise the domestic structure has received a lukewarm response from former players. 

Former Test captain Javed Miandad, who was invited late for the seminar after being surprisingly overlooked on the original list of invitees, has refused to attend. 

Other former greats like Imran Khan, Wasim Akram and Rameez Raja have also apparently told the PCB that they would not be available on November 17 for the event in Lahore. Miandad was not happy with the fact that he did not get a proper invite. (PTI)

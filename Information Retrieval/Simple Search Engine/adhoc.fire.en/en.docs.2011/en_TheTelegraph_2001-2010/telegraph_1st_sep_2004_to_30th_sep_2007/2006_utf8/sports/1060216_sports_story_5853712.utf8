The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Sourav, Deep leave today

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Bengal captain Deep Dasgupta will leave for Dhanbad along with Sourav Ganguly on Thursday afternoon. 

Deep and Sourav will come here together. They are expected to join the squad in the evening, team manager Samir Dasgupta said from Dhanbad. 

On hearing that his one-year-old son was ill and had to be taken to hospital, Deep promptly left Dhanbad on Tuesday. 

My son is well now and its a big relief for me. Ill be able to concentrate on the game now, Deep said on Wednesday. 

Bengal, who have won both their matches so far, will take on Assam in another tie on Friday.

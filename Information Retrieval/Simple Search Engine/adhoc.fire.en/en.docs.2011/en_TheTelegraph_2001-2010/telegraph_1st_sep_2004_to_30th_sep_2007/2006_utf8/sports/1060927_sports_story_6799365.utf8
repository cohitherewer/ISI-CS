Calcutta: A league is not always won by the favourites, but the one who clinch crucial victories at crucial times. 

In this analysis, East Bengal, despite losing the prestige tie against Mohun Bagan 0-1 at the Salt Lake Stadium on Tuesday, are still better-placed to reclaim the CFL Premier Division title from the arch-rivals. 

For the defending champions Mohun Bagan, losing points to less-fancied teams such as Calcutta Port Trust or George Telegraph in this marathon competition may cost them dear in the end. 

Although Bhaichung Bhutia alleged that the tournament was fixed in favour of a particular team (without naming East Bengal) and Mohun Bagans retaining the title would be akin to a miracle, the reality points to this simple logic that wins against small teams do eventually mould a teams passage to the title. 

On paper, the tournament is still open as East Bengal lead the eight-team table with 22 points from 10 matches, followed by Mohun Bagan who are on 21 points, but have played a game more. 

However, if its the league title East Bengal are aiming at now, their thunder has already been stolen by the arch-rivals. Even if Mohun Bagan fail to defend the title, their back-to-back wins against East Bengal can more than make up that damage. 

The pattern of Tuesdays return-leg was, however, different from the first one, but the result was identical. Exactly a month ago, East Bengal dominated the entire proceedings but suffered the ignominy, thanks to Bhaichungs opportunistic strike. 

In comparison, the second derby was almost an apology, yet Ndem Guy Herve found the all important opening for Mohun Bagan. The Cameroonian was brilliantly fed by Lalkamal Bhowmick from the deep in the 49th minute. He took his marker Gurpreet Singh in his stride and stole a right-footed volley from the edge of the box, which beat goalkeeper Rajat Ghosh Dastidar hands down. 

The match, however, lived up to its reputation towards the end for all the wrong reasons. Two minutes from time, Bhaichung Bhutia was engaged in a heated exchange with referee Debashish Mishra, leading to his receiving marching orders. Surprisingly, the India captain refused to leave the ground as per rule, despite the fourth referees repeated requests. A few seconds back, he was challenged by the East Bengal keeper from a 50-50 situation, but Mishra didnt respond to the strikers appeal for a penalty. 

That sense of denial must have sparked Bhaichungs anger, leading to his uncharacteristic attempt of shoving the referee. But he clearly flouted the rule by not leaving the ground. 

Then came another red-card, inside the injury time, East Bengals M. Suresh being the culprit, when he had invited the second booking from the referee with a nasty foul on Lalkamal. But unlike Bhaichung, he left the park immediately. In the second half, Mohun Bagan had a few chances. Lalkamal acted selfishly when he wasted a golden chance by not laying it off for the unmarked Dipendu Biswas and instead going for the goal himself.

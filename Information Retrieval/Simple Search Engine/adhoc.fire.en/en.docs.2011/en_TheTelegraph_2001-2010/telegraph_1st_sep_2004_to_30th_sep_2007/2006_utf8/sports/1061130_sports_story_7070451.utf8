The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 A Prince, sans airs

 - Another gentleman-cricketer passes away 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Calcutta: Even off the field, its a sad time for Indian cricket as November has taken away two pucca gentlemen. 

Both, of course, were very fine players. 

Cancer claimed Polly Umrigar, a former captain, on November 7. On Wednesday, Hanumant Singh (centurion on Test debut) passed away following dengue-induced complications. 

Much would be written about Polly, but todays lot may not be knowing too much about Hanumant. 

He was a Prince, yes, but had no airs. 

Hanumant wasnt known to raise his voice, but was party to one of Indian crickets most sensational decisions the dropping of Kapil Dev, on disciplinary grounds, after the Kotla Test versus England in 1984-85. 

As the next match was at the Eden and Kapil had a huge following, the Board appeared keen on getting the selectors to have a rethink. 

The quintet, though, stood firm. 

Actually, Hanumant would have resigned had the Board put the selectors under unbearable pressure. 

By the evening, I may not be a selector, is what hed told The Telegraph before setting out for the HHI, where a meeting had been called. 

As it turned out, Hanumant didnt have to put in his papers. 

Expressing sorrow at his passing away, Kapil remarked that hed never borne a grudge against Hanumant or the other selectors. 

Speaking exclusively, Kapil said: The selectors did their job Sometimes, people get carried away, but I never held a grudge Hanumants passing away is very sad 

Besides having been a selector and manager, Hanumant was once the Boards National Coach and also served as an International Cricket Council Match Referee in the pre-Elite Panel days. 

More recently, six years ago, he was on the panel which picked Indias first coach from overseas John Wright. 

If the regulars at the Wankhede are missing Polly Kaka, those at the Cricket Club of India will begin to miss Chotu Hanumant.

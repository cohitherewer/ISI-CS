 Hanumant no more

Mumbai: Former Test batsman Hanumant Singh died here Wednesday morning at a private hospital after a prolonged fight with complications arising out of dengue fever and a hepatitis B infection. 

The 67-year-old Hanumant, hailing from a princely family in Rajasthans Banswara, is survived by his wife, son Sangram, who played junior level cricket for Mumbai, and a daughter, 

Hanumant contracted dengue fever when he was in Jaipur to put in place a coaching system for his former Ranji team Rajasthan. Then he got a hepatitis B infection that affects the liver and causes breathing problems. 

He was admitted to the ICU on November 6 and was later put on ventilators. He did not come out of the ICU and took his final breath around 9.30 am, BCCIs chief administrative officer Ratnakar Shetty said. 

Born on March 29, 1939, Hanumant a middle-order batsman started his international career with a bang. He hit a century on Test debut against Mike Smiths England in Delhi, but did not score another one till he was eased out in the late 1960s. 

Hanumant played 14 Tests, compiling 686 runs in 24 innings with one hundred and five fifties for an average of 31.18. He also took 11 catches. The Prince of Banswara, whose brother, the late Suryaveer Singh, also played with distinction for Rajasthan. The two, in fact, were the fulcrum for Rajasthan and Central Zone in Ranji and Duleep Trophy. 

In his 20-year first-class career, Hanumant scored 12,338 runs in 207 matches. He also took 56 wickets. 

 When he retired from first-class 

 cricket in 1974, Hanumants Ranji tally of 6,170 was 

 within striking distance of the then record aggregate of 

 former India skipper Vijay Hazare (6,312). (PTI)

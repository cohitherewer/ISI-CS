 Randhawa tied 28th in Dubai

 - Atwal at two-under 69 

 Randhawa hit 4 birdies, while Atwal shot an eagle 

Dubai: Jyoti Randhawa sizzled on the back nine with four birdies to return a card of four-under 68 and improved his prospect of a good weekend in the $ 2.4 million Desert Classic at the Majlis courses. 

The Asian No. 1 in 2002, Randhawa at five-under for two days is at tied 28th at the Emirates Golf Club. 

However, Masters of Asia champion Shiv Kapur bowed out from the championship despite a one-under 71, as his total of four-over 148 was just not enough to make the cut. 

Randhawas total of five-under 139 put him in a fine position for the last two rounds, just as he had done last year when he was tied 12th at the finish. 

Tiger Woods indicated he was all primed up for his first-ever success in the desert, when he fired a six-under 66, despite going into the water twice in the round. But he was still two off the lead, as Retief Goosen, starting with a bogey, recovered to join Dane Anders Hansen in the lead at 13-under after a second round 67 that was sealed with an eagle on par-five 18th hole. Earlier, Hansen went into lead at 13-under. 

Meanwhile in Scottsdale, Arjun Atwal shot an eagle on the 15th for a solid start of two-under 69 at the stadium course on the opening day of the $ 5.2 million FBR Open Golf tournament here. 

Atwal had two birdies on the front nine, but they were neutralised by successive bogeys on the eighth and ninth, as he turned in an even par. 

On the back nine, Atwal birdied the 15th to go two-under and was placed tied 26th in a big group.

 Arsenal, Lyon, aiming high

London: Arsenal, Olympique Lyon and Villarreal try to venture into the unknown this week when the second legs of the Champions League quarter finals take place. 

To reach the last four of Europes elite club competition for the first time, however, they will have to oust three Italian clubs dripping with European pedigree. 

Arsenal are best placed, having earned a surprise 2-0 first-leg lead over Serie A leaders Juventus at Highbury last week. Arsene Wengers team has recovered their old verve in recent times, exemplified by their 5-0 thrashing of Aston Villa on Saturday. 

We dont concede, we score goals, stated the Frenchman. The team is continuing to develop well. 

In Turin on Wednesday he will look to striker Thierry Henry to hurt Juventus on the break. Arsenal will be anxious to discover if injuries to midfielder Cesc Fabregas and ebullient full back Emmanuel Eboue will prevent them playing. 

Juventus need an early goal to unsettle Arsenals relatively inexperienced team but will not be helped by the suspensions of Mauro Camoranesi and Jonathan Zebina, both sent off at Highbury, and ex-Arsenal captain Patrick Vieira. 

Lyon failed to pierce the defence of six-times winners AC Milan in their goalless first leg in France but will have taken heart from the Italian sides embarrassing 0-1 defeat by Lecce on Saturday.

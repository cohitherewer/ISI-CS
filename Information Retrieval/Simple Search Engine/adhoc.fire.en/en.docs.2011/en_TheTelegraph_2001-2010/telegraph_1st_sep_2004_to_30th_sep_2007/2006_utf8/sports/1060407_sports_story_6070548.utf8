 Harbhajan hattrick puts BSF in semis

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Harbhajan Singhs hattrick helped defending champions BSF (Jalandhar) book a semi-final berth as they trounced Punjab and Sindh Bank (PSB) 4-1 in a quarter final league match of the 111th IndianOil Beighton Cup hockey tournament at the Mohun Bagan Ground on Thursday. 

Despite the loss, PSB also made it to the final four with six points from three matches. 

Indian Airlines and Army XI are the other two semi-finalists. 

PSB drew first blood in the ninth minute off a penalty corner conversion by Rajwinder Singh. The lead was short-lived as BSF equalised two minutes later, again off a penalty corner by Ranjit Singh. 

BSF captain Harbhajan Singh broke the deadlock. After being fed by a Topno pass from the left flank, Harbhajan had only the goalkeeper to beat and he didnt disappoint. 

It was Harbhajan again, who struck in the 63rd and 65th minutes to give BSF the much-needed win. 

In other matches, Army XI trounced CC amp;FC 4-1 and CESC drew with Punjab Police 1-1. 

Sudesh Kumar struck a brace while A.K. Majhi and Eliaza Lakra scored apiece for the Army team.

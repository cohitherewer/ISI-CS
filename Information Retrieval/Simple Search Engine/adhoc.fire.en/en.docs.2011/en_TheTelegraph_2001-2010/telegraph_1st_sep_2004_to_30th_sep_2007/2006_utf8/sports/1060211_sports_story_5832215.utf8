 Jaspal Rana betters world record score

New Delhi: Jaspal Rana shot a better-than-world-record score to win the centre fire pistol gold on the opening day of the Australia Cup in Melbourne on Friday. 

According to information received here, Rana scored 591 which was one point more than the world record score, but the Indians name will not enter the record books since the event is not on the ISSF calendar. Samresh Jung fired 585 for the silver. 

Indias rifle shooters were also bang on target with Gagan Narang, Abhinav Bindra and Sanjeev Rajput winning gold, silver and bronze in the three-position event. Narang shot 1139 followed by an excellent final round of 101.4 for the top honours with the 0.22 rifle. He shot 390 in the prone, 380 in standing and 369 in the kneeling position. 

The windy coditions were the reason for the low scores, said Gagan. Bindra, who entered the final with a score of 1141, fired 95.3 in the final for a second-place finish in the event he has recently taken up besides his pet 10m rifle event.

 Bari to reason with Afridi 

Karachi: Pakistans chief selector Wasim Bari has said he would try and talk Shahid Afridi out of his temporary retirement from Test cricket. 

Bari said Pakistan needed Afridi ? who has announced that he would not play Tests for one year as he wanted to focus on the 2007 World Cup ? in both forms of the game. 

It was Afridis personal decision but I think he is beneficial for Pakistan in both versions of the game, the former Test wicketkeeper said. 

I will talk to Afridi, but not now, because he has taken a decision very recently, and must have consulted someone before announcing retirement from Test cricket, Bari was quoted as saying in the media here. 

Afridi had cited too much cricket as the reason behind his decision.

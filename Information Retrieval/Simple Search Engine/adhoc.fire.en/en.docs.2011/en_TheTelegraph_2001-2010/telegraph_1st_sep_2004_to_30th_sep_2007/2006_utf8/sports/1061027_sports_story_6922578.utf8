London: Substitute Kieran Lee spared Manchester Uniteds blushes when he scored a minute from the end of extra time to give the League Cup holders a 2-1 win at third division Crewe Alexandra in the third round on Wednesday. 

Striker Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, United captain for the night, had put Alex Fergusons side ahead before the half hour but Luke Varney scored a deserved equaliser 17 minutes from the end of regulation time. 

There were seven internationals out there for United but you have to work hard before you can win a football match, said Ferguson. We let Crewe get a toe-hold which we shouldnt have. 

Striker Alan Smith, returning to the side for the first time since breaking his leg nine months ago, laid on the winner with a crossfield ball that Lee ran on to steer past Ben Williams. 

England midfielder Joe Cole, also back after a long injury lay-off, scored the first goal in Chelseas 2-0 win at Blackburn Rovers in one of four all-Premier League ties. 

Cole struck in the 53rd minute to net a cross from Salomon Kalou, who added the second nine minutes from time off a rebound after keeper Brad Friedel parried Shaun Wright-Phillips shot. 

Newcastle Uniteds Peruvian Nolberto Solano scored twice, his first a fine diving header into the roof of the net from Damien Duffs far post cross, in a 3-0 win over Portsmouth. 

Striker Giuseppe Rossi, on loan from Manchester United, had put Newcastle ahead with a turn and low shot in the 48th. Charlton Athletic, bottom of the Premier League, beat Bolton Wanderers 1-0 at The Valley with striker Marcus Bent heading home in the 17th minute from Jimmy Floyd Hasselbainks cross. 

Liverpool looked to be coasting against Reading at Anfield with a 3-0 lead and 15 minutes to go but in a frantic final quarter of an hour the visitors scored three times although Peter Crouch 77th minute goal ensured the home side won 4-3. 

Robbie Fowler, with a fine opening strike, John Arne Riise and Argentine defender Gabriel Paletta, with his first goal for the club, scored Liverpools first three. 

Strike partners Mido and Jermain Defoe scored two apiece to help Tottenham Hotspur rout fourth division MK Dons 5-0. Ireland captain Robbie Keane netted their fifth in the final minute. 

In Madrid, second division Malaga mauled the Primera Ligas bottom club Real Sociedad 4-1 in the first leg of their Kings Cup fourth round tie on Wednesday. 

Sociedad, who have yet to win a game this season, took the lead after only seven minutes but had two players sent off before the break after Malaga had levelled. 

The home side piled the pressure on beleaguered Sociedad coach Jose Mari Bakero with three second half goals from Ernesto, Vicente Valcarce and Perico. 

Primera Liga leaders Barcelona returned to winning ways thanks to a double strike from Icelands Eidur Gudjohnsen in a 2-1 win at third division Badalona, and two goals from Miguel Angel Angulo earned Valencia a 2-1 win at Portuense. 

After their impressive 2-0 win over Barcelona at the weekend, Real Madrid returned to earth as they were held 1-1 by third division Ecija. 

Coach Fabio Capello gave David Beckham only his second start in eight games, along with forwards Ronaldo and Antonio Cassano. 

But there was little to separate the sides until a Beckham free-kick was headed on to a post by Mahamadou Diarra, and Cassano scored from the rebound after 66 minutes. 

Battling Ecija levelled when striker Nolitos shot evaded Diego Lopez at his near post, nine minutes from time. Surprises were few and far between on a night marked by wet and windy conditions across the country.

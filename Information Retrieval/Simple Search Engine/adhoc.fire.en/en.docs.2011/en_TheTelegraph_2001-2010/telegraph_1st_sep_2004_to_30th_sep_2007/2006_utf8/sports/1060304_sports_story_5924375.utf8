 Federer to clash with Nadal in final

 - DUBAI OPEN 

Dubai: Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal, the top two players in the world, will clash for the first time since the French Open semi-finals in the Dubai Open final on Saturday. 

Spains Nadal, who won the Roland Garros clash in four sets before lifting his first Grand Slam crown, beat Rainer Schuettler of Germany 6-4, 6-2, while Federer eased past Mikhail Youzhny of Russia 6-2, 6-3. 

Switzerlands Federer has won both his tournaments this year, including the Australian Open. 

Nadal, who won 11 titles last year, is playing only his second tournament since recovering from a career-threatening foot injury. 

It was also Federers best performance so far in the tournament, which is his first since winning the Australian Open more than a month ago, and increased the feeling that this will become the first title he has won four times. 

 quot;Mikhail had many chances early on, when he could have got a lead, but I got him back, quot; said Federer, who was soon into a 3-0 lead despite being love-40 in both his first two service games. 

 quot;Its hard when you get a start like he did, to stay positive. He knows I am going to pick up my game and then hes not going to get so many chances. In the second set I think I played great tennis and I am very happy with the way I played this time. quot;

 The miracle that got scuppered

 - Champions League

 - Barcelona come from behind to win 2-1; Lehmann eviction 

 hurts Arsenal 

 Simon Barnes

We have grown accustomed to miracles when an English team gets to the Champions League final. But alas for Arsenal, Wednesday nights scheduled miracle failed to arrive. For an age, a beleaguered side seemed about to do the impossible at the rain-drenched Stade de France and beat the best team in the world when down to ten men ? and to do so by that most resonant of Arsenal scorelines, 1-0. But in the end, Barcelona simply had too much to be held and won 2-1 (as reported in Thursdays Late City edition). 

There was no Miracle of Paris, then, just a predictable victory to the predictable victors. But it did not come about in a predictable manner ? that is to say, goals of pure and perfect beauty scored or made by the nonpareil, Ronaldinho. The match turned when Jens Lehmann, the Arsenal goalkeeper, was sent off in the 18th minute. 

Samuel Eto, put clear by a wonderful pass from Ronaldinho, was brought down by Lehmann just outside the penalty area. Unquestioned foul, denying unquestioned goalscoring opportunity: he had to go. The wonder of it was that this did not destroy the game as a spectacle. Rather, it brought a dizzying drama and ? nearly, nearly, nearly ? the miracle we have grown accustomed to. 

For Arsenal took the lead with a galumphing header from Sol Campbell in the 37th minute ? a classic, old-Arsenal set-piece goal ? and then set about defending it. 

They damn near pulled it off, too. For about 40 minutes they clung on, sometimes desperately, sometimes with wild, sprinting counter-attacks, with Thierry Henry having a chance that he would score two times in three. Alas, again, for Arsenal, this was the third. 

You could see Arsenal waxing in hope, you could see Barcelona beginning to doubt themselves. 

All the ingredients for a miracle were there. The sense of certainty was changing sides; the feeling of destiny was slowly beginning to shift towards Arsenal. 

But the moral is simple: you cant defend a 1-0 lead for ever against Barcelona. Even when they play against 11 men, the opposition looks short-handed. With a genuinely depleted team, hope is a very fragile thing indeed. Eto brought the teams level in the 76th minute and it knocked the stuffing out of Arsenal, as you knew it must. Juliano Belletti smacked home the inevitable winner four minutes later. 

It left Arsenal feeling horribly bitter ? and a bitter football team always blames the referee. I dont want to start any arguments, Henry said, mendaciously on the whole, I suspect, but I dont know if the referee had a Barcelona shirt on. They kicked me all over the place in the first half. I told the referee, if you dont want us to win it, just say it at the top. Maybe next time Ill have to dive. 

Maybe next time, if he does, he will do so in a Barcelona shirt, for he has yet to commit himself to Arsenal and the champions are his main suitors. 

As a quick reality check here, Emmanuel Ebou? won the free-kick from which Arsenal scored their goal, and did so by means of an unquestioned dive. 

But twas ever thus in football: to the winner the Cup, to the loser the unshakeable belief that it was all the fault of the referee, life, the universe and God. 

It was a desperate game to lose, of that there is no question. Arsenal have had a memorable run and played some sublime football against Europes mightiest. But on Wednesday night they met a side which was mightier than all the rest and they came up short. 

Only just, mind you, but a little goes an awfully long way on a night such as that. Arsenal set out to win beautifully and in the end they only just failed to win ugly. Paris: a miracle too far.

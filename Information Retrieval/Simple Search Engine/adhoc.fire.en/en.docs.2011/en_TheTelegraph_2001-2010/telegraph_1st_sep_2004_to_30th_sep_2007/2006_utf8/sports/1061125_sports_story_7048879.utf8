 Saina up seven spots to No. 27

New Delhi: Rising badminton star Saina Nehwal received a major boost ahead of her Asian Games campaign, jumping seven spots to reach a career best ranking of 27 in the latest womens singles rankings list. 

Saina, who won the India International tournament in Mumbai before reaching the final of the World Junior Championship, has witnessed a meteoric rise since her Philippines Open win this year. 

On the mens chart, Nikhil Kanetkar, runner-up in the Mumbai tournament, leaped nine spots to occupy 43rd place. 

Indias top-ranked shuttler Chetan Anand sat pretty at 31st. 

National champion Anup Sridhar dropped one place to 39. 

P. Kashyap is at No. 46.

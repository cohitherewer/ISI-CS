 Warne theatre very appealing: Langer

 - South Africa should follow suit, feels Nel 

 Langer feels its indicative of Warnes passion for the game 

Melbourne: Shane Warne may be pushing the line with his aggressive appealing for wickets, but teammate Justin Langer says his style provides some of crickets great theatre. 

Langer, 35, is in line for a return to the Australian team for Mondays third Sydney Test after missing Fridays 184-run win over South Africa in Melbourne with a hamstring injury. 

Its indicative of his passion for the game, Langer said here on Saturday. 

I remember as a kid watching Dennis Lillee appeal. It was one of the great sights of cricket. 

I used to run around as a 10-year-old, bowl and then appeal like Dennis Lillee. 

He thinks it out and he gives it a big appeal. To me thats just part of the game, part of the great theatre of the great Shane Warne. 

Warne last week passed Lillees 1981 world record of 85 Test wickets in a calendar year. 

Leg-spinner Warne finished with 96 at 22.02 after his six wickets in the second Test at the MCG. 

But Warne, Test crickets leading wicket-taker with 657 in his career, has generated widespread debate here with his vociferous appeals for wickets. 

Langer said critics had to realise that constant appealing by slow bowlers was part of the game when fielders were crowding around the bat in a tense atmosphere. 

Paceman Andre Nel says South Africa may copy Australias aggressive appealing to match umpires in Mondays final cricket Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground. 

Nel, the firebrand bowler of the Proteas team, said that if Australian bowlers like leg-spinner Shane Warne can get away with it, then may be South Africa should follow suit. 

I think they are very, very clever about the way they do things with umpires, Nel said at Sydney Airport on Saturday.

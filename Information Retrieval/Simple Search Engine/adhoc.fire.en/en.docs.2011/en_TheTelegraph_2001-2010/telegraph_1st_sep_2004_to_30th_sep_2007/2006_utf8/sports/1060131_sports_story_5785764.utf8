The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Melbourne: World champion Jade Edmistone broke her own world record for 50m breaststroke in the heats of the Australian Commonwealth Games selection trials on Monday.

 Edmistone clocked 30.31 seconds at Melbourne?s Sports and Aquatic centre. The university student set the previous mark of 30.45 to win gold at the world championships in Montreal, Canada last July. 

 London: Seve Ballesteros wants golf?s rule-makers to act to reduce the effect the power hitters are having on the modern game.

 When told of rookie Bubba Watson?s prodigious driving feats in the US, the 48-year-old Spaniard replied: ?It proves to me that if they continue the way they are, golf courses will be 10,000 yards long?.

 ?It would be a good idea to change a few rules,? Ballesteros said while attending a Spanish property exhibition at Londons Olympia. 

 Oslo: Norway?s sporting federation has received death threats from people angered by the use of fur on the official garb of the country?s Olympic team headed for Turin in Italy next month, officials said on Monday.

 ?We take these kinds of threats very seriously,? the head of the Norwegian Confederation of Sports, Karl-Arne Johannessen, said. ?It?s a shame that people who make themselves out to be animal rights? activists resort to such irrational measures,? he added.

 The Norwegian delegation will be dressed in red and white gear equipped with hoods rimmed with fur, probably from Chinese raccoon dogs. 

 Madrid: Striker Lampros Choutos has agreed to end his loan spell at Real Mallorca and return to Inter Milan, the Primera Liga club said on their website.

 The 26-year-old, who has been capped by Greece, failed to establish himself in the team after joining Hector Cuper?s side in August.

 Madrid: Deportivo Coruna are taking legal action to have the remainder of their King?s Cup tie with Valencia postponed until their appeal against the Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) is heard.

 Last Wednesday?s quarter-final second leg was abandoned just before the break when a linesman was hit on the head by an object thrown from the crowd moments after Valencia had scored to level the tie 1-1 on aggregate.

 The RFEF ruled that the remaining 46 minutes of the match should be played behind closed doors at Valencia?s Mestalla Stadium on Wednesday.

 Deportivo are calling for the game to be suspended until an appeal against the RFEF?s decision is heard.

 ?Even if the tie is played we will continue to fight in the Spanish courts and the European courts for the failure to address the issue of violence in sport properly,? the club said in a statement on their website. 

 Roma: Serie A side Palermo named Giuseppe Papadopulo as their new coach on Sunday.

 ?I?ve had him sign a contract until June 30th,? the club?s president Maurizio Zamparini said on Sicilian television station Tgs. ?All I?ve asked him to do is ensure we dont go down (to Serie B).?

 Papadopulo, who has previous top-flight experience with Siena and Lazio, replaces Luigi Del Neri.

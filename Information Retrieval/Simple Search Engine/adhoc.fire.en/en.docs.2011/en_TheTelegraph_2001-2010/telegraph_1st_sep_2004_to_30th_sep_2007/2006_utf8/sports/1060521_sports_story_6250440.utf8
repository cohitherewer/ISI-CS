 Not making the final would be hard to take: Robinho

 - We have to remain humble and keep our feet on ground 

 Robinho

It is almost a year since Robinho wowed global audience with his stunning repertoire of feints, step-overs and dribbles at the Confederations Cup in Germany. 

After playing his part in Brazils impressive march to that particular trophy, the impish forward now aims to do it all again at the World Cup and help his country celebrate a sixth world title on July 9 in Berlin. 

Not making the final would be hard to take, as Brazil are expected to win every competition, especially the World Cup, Robinho said. 

Nevertheless, while the snake-hipped front man is setting his sights justifiably high, he is also taking nothing for granted, insisting that Brazils tag as hot favourites guarantees nothing. 

For me, teams can only be favourites off the pitch, he said. Once the game gets going, its 11 versus 11. I believe Brazil can beat any team out there, but I also believe we could lose to any of them, which is why we have to remain humble and keep our feet on the ground. 

We know there are some very strong teams who always perform well at these tournaments, countries such as Argentina, England and Germany, who also have the advantage of playing at home. That said, Brazil are good enough to beat anyone. 

By the time Robinho was six years old, he was already raising eyebrows with his silken ball skills, and it was no surprise that Pele brought him into his youth academy at the first opportunity. 

Asked recently about the youngsters prospects, the legendary Pele, himself a Santos graduate, said: He has all the qualities needed to be better than me. 

But Robinho would have none of it, embarrassed though he was with the comparison. 

I dont like comparisons much, although it makes me proud to hear things like that. However, Pele is Pele ? incomparable and truly one of a kind. 

Last summer, after five years at Santos, the then 21-year-old decided to try his luck in Europe with a move to Spanish giants Real Madrid, whom he recently helped secure the runners-up spot in the Primera Liga. 

We didnt win anything (this season), but we worked extremely hard, he reflected. The team hasnt been doing that well of late, but next season were going to improve and win trophies for our fans. 

On a personal level, it has been a particularly good year for the Brazilian. 

I think its gone quite well considering it was my first season although I still have a lot more to give, he said. 

Im capable of doing much more and will continue working hard with this end in mind. Spain is a country that enjoys a very close affinity with Brazilian football, and the more I play here the more Ill benefit from this. 

By contrast, things have not gone so well for his Madrid teammate Ronaldo, who suffered an injury-plagued season and had his form and fitness called into question ahead of the quadrennial showpiece. Robinho, however, is quick to dispel any doubts about his colleague. 

Ronaldo is the best striker in the world, he insisted. 

People were also worried about him before the last World Cup as he was recovering from a very serious injury, yet he finished up being the tournaments best player. The fans have to realise that even though he hasnt been at his peak this season physically, when he arrives in Germany hell be back to his best, doing his utmost to play well and score. Ronaldo is Ronaldo. 

My personal goal is to win the World Cup, he shoots without hesitation. 

After that Im sure Ill have other dreams to fulfil, like winning the Player of the Tournament award...

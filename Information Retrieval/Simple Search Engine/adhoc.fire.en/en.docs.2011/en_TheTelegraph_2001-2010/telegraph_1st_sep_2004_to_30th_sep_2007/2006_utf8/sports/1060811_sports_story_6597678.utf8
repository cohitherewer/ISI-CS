 - Bangladesh include six new faces 

 Darren Gough, Andrew 

 Flintoff

London: Andrew Flintoff and Darren Gough were named in Englands provisional one-day International squad on Thursday for Octobers Champions Trophy in India. 

Allrounder Flintoff is still recovering from surgery on his injured left ankle, but team doctors are confident that he will return in time for the first match against India on October 15. Six of the 30 probables, including Flintoff and spin bowler Ashley Giles, are still recovering from injury. 

The medical advice we have received is that there is a good chance that they will be available for the tournament, but we will need to review their progress before the squad has to be reduced to 14 on September 7, chairman of selectors David Graveney said. 

Fast bowler Gough returns for his first ODI since last years series against Australia. 

(Gough) is performing well for Essex and I am sure he will be seeking to further impress the selectors over the next few weeks as will all the other pace bowlers in our 30, Graveney said. 

The 36-year-old Gough has made 156 one-day International appearances for England, but asked selectors not to consider him for the tour of Pakistan last December because of personal reasons. During that time, he appeared on a British reality television show Strictly Come Dancing and won the competition. 

Left-arm spinner Monty Panesar was ignored despite an impressive display in the current Test series against Pakistan, which England won with a match to spare. 

Panesar has claimed 16 wickets in the series and took three for 39 runs in the second innings at Headingley on Tuesday. 

Ill probably ring him to explain that the door is not completely shut but for him the best thing is if he concentrates on Test cricket, Graveney said. 

There are five uncapped players with Leicestershire fast bowler Stuart Broad, joined by Essex allrounder Ravi Bopara, veteran Mal Loye, Durhams Graham Onions and Michael Yardy of Sussex. (AP)

 Sachin should be ready, says Leipus

 TRI-SERIES IN LANKA

 New Delhi: Andrew Leipus, 

 who supervised Sachin Tendulkars post-surgery rehabilitation 

 programme, says the maestro should be ready for the August 

 tri-series in Sri Lanka.

 The current status is that 

 he has a few more weeks to go before he is hundred per cent 

 fit. When we say hundred per cent, we are talking about 

 batting, fielding, throwing, the former Team India 

 physio said on a TV channel.

 The Mumbai batsman missed out 

 on being fit for the Test series in the West Indies amid 

 much speculation over his recovery process.

 Well, he actually recovered 

 very, very well considering what he had done to the shoulder 

 (its) hard to give an exact date but I think he would 

 be ready for the Sri Lanka tour.

 The surgery went fine, structurally 

 everything was a success, we literally just ran out of time 

 to get him fit for the West Indies, Leipus said.

 Sachin has said mental battles 

 with his latest injury caused him sleepless nights and days 

 full of frustration even as he battled in vain to catch 

 the flight to the Caribbean.

 Amarnath not for foreign coach

Calcutta: Mohinder Amarnath isnt one in favour of a foreign coach. I am the last person to encourage a foreign coach, the former India allrounder said. 

Amarnath, who was in the city on Friday to conduct a seminar for the coaches organised by the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB), said that as a coach, one has to understand the culture, feelings and emotions of the players. It is very difficult for a foreign coach to understand all these things. 

After all, 70 per cent of the matches we are going to play are on home soil. 

However, he also maintained that the real test for a coach would be on foreign soil. 

Amarnath, incidentally, was an aspirant for the post of Team India coach, but ultimately had to bow out to Greg Chappell who was thrust with the responsibility. 

When asked whether the team needs a bowling coach, Amarnath said that a coach is supposed to know about every aspect of the game. After all, too many people will create a lot of confusion. 

This was the first time when a state association had approached Amarnath for conducting a seminar for the coaches. I think seminars like these should be organised more frequently. We have to encourage former cricketers to take up coaching, he said. 

But he felt that coaches should be given considerable amount of time before their performance is put under scanner.

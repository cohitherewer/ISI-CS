 Vieira to make emotional return

London: Patrick Vieira will make an emotional return to Highbury on Tuesday when the Juventus midfielder tries to scupper the Champions League hopes of an Arsenal team he once inspired to a string of trophies. 

Vieira, who won three Premier League titles and four FA Cups in a nine-year career with Arsenal, will be back in north London for the quarter final first leg after joining Juventus last year. 

In a further twist, one of the 29-year-olds main tasks in what should be a pulsating encounter will be to stop the man who replaced him as Arsenals captain, Thierry Henry. 

Meanwhile, Benfica coach Ronald Koeman says his side can upset an injury-hit Barcelona when they meet their Iberian rivals in another quarter final. 

We know that we can cause a surprise, but we are facing a tough opponent, the Dutchman said.Everything is possible. 

However, Benfica will be without the Portuguese leagues top scorer Nuno Gomes through suspension, while Brazilian defender Alcides misses out through injury and is replaced by Nelson. 

Barcelona coach Frank Rijkaard clearly had one eye on the Benfica match as he rested World Player of the Year Ronaldinho and attacking midfielder Deco for Saturdays league game at Malaga. 

Barcelona will miss live-wire Argentine forward Lionel Messi, who tore a thigh muscle in the 1-1 draw against Chelsea that put them into the quarter finals. 

Swedish striker Henrik Larsson and French winger Ludovic Giuly will be vying for the vacant slot along- side Ronaldinho and Samuel Eto up front.

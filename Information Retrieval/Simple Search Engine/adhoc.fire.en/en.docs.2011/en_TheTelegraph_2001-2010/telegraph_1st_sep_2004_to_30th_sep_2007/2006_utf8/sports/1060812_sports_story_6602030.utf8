 Kapur endures tough Day I

 Golf

 Zaandvoort (The Netherlands): 

 Shiv Kapur endured a tough day in the first round of the 

 Dutch Open here, faltering on the back nine to shoot a four-over 

 75 in wet and windy conditions.

 The Indian is playing the event 

 on a sponsors exemption and is trying to gain valuable 

 experience on the European Tour during the summer break 

 in Asia. Christian Cevear and Anders Hansen shared the first 

 round lead with cards of six-under 65.

 Kapur started on the first and 

 dropped a shot on the third, but a birdie on fifth brought 

 him level. However, a bogey on ninth meant he turned in 

 one over, and another on 12th and a double bogey on the 

 par-four 15th and is tied for 123rd place. He has a lot 

 of work to do in Round II to make the cut. 

 Defending champion Gonzalo Fernandez 

 Castano had a four-over 75 as he double-bogeyed the second 

 hole and had a string of bogeys on the back nine. Colin 

 Montgomerie finished at 70.

 Asian Tour member Simon Dyson 

 of England enjoyed a good start with a 67 and is tied fifth, 

 two shot off the lead. Australian David Bransdon is a further 

 stroke back, while Thailands Thongchai Jaidee carded 

 an even par round for a share of 51st place. (PTI)

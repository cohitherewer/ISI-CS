 Surgery on Owen successful

Newcastle: Michael Owen can now focus on playing again. 

Thats the opinion of Newcastle manager Glenn Roeder, who said the England strikers knee surgery earlier this week in the US was successful. 

The 26-year-old Owen was injured during Englands World Cup group match against Sweden in June. 

Ive spoken to our club doctor Roddy MacDonald across in Colorado and he gave me the fantastic news that Michaels operation went extremely well, Roeder said in a statement. 

As far as Michael is concerned, he can now start to focus on playing again. Its going to be a long haul but he can start to focus on that. And I look forward to the day when I can write his name on a Newcastle United team-sheet. 

Owens surgery was performed in Colorado by Dr Richard Steadman. He is expected to remain in the US until next week. 

The injury was Owens second since joining Newcastle from Real Madrid before last season. He broke his foot in a Premier League game against Tottenham in December.

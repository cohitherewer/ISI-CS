 Paes-Bhupathi fallout tragic, but insoluble

- Sania needs to build on physical strangth 

Serve Volley

It was a rewarding climax to our late night vigils. Two golds and a silver were added to Indias impoverished medal tally by our tennis stars. The packed stands of the Khalifa stadium with 4000 hysterical flag-waving Indian fans celebrated to the tune of robust Bhangra beats. 

Paes, in his favourite role of hero, took centrestage winning the mens doubles partnering Bhupathi, and the mixed doubles with Sania Mirza. At 33 years of age, Paes played six tough tension-packed sets in two gold medal matches without wilting. One has to recognise and pay tribute to his physical fitness, dedication and unmatched fighting spirit. 

Describing the doubles final, in which Paes and Bhupathi saved seven match-points as a cliff-hanger is an understatement. It was like bungee jumping, without knowing you had a rope tied to your waist. Sanchal and Sonchat Ratiwatana, with victory in sight over one of the greatest doubles teams in the world, failed to deliver the coup de grace. 

 Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupath

Bhupathi and Paes, who stoked their cold boilers with chest-butts, forgot their differences and came together to salvage pride for the country. Bhupathi was far below his best. Possibly his business activities have affected his focus and fitness. He was a step slower getting to the net and missed several reflex volleys. To his credit he fought bravely with strong unyielding resolve. 

The Thais were a surprise package. They continuously used the I formation, in which the man at the net takes position at the centre service line when his partner is serving and then moves right or left, trying to confuse the returner of serve. They combined beautifully, served and returned well, intercepted brilliantly and deserved to win. They will certainly make their mark as a doubles team internationally if they can maintain such a high level of play. 

I was very impressed with Sanias game. She has become physically stronger, is moving better and more consistent with her groundshots. The manner in which Sania blasted her way through the earlier rounds shows that she is now far more confident and has developed more faith in her ability. The difference between the top-notchers and rest of the pack is the level of confidence. 

But Sania has still a long way to go. To meet her aspirations of making the top ten, she requires a higher physical platform, which will take a minimum of two years to build. She lost in the final because the large number of matches took a heavy toll of her physical reserves. 

She was at her best in the semis against the experienced Na Li, a Wimbledon quarter-finalist. Sania literally blasted Li off court with a torrent of clean winners from both flanks. She has a unique attitude of total aggression, which should never be curbed as it is her natural style. It should be augmented by hitting a topspin loopy shot when out of position and occasionally making sallies to the net. She did both in her matches and seems to be on the right track. 

However, her best shot which is the forehand crosscourt needs to be interspersed more often with the down-the-line shot and an inside-out forehand, especially while punishing a half court ball. This will keep her opponents guessing. Watching Federer tackle half-court shots will show her how it can be done. On the backhand side, she needs to develop a reliable down-the-line shot. 

Everybody knows about her poor service. She should forget about going for aces but concentrate on getting a deep first serve and vary the placement. Her shallow second serve should be hit with more speed and controlled by more spin. 

All these can be overcome. The most important thing is to stay injury-free and build her physical strength to the highest level. All-out aggression can only be sustained by the highest physical fitness level. 

The fallout between Paes and Bhupathi is tragic. Sporting icons, whatever the provocation, are not expected to behave in such a manner. They have to be role models for the younger generations. In modern times, handling of the media is a very necessary skill. A chance remark taken out of context in an unguarded moment can trigger off a forest fire. 

Paes and Bhupathi were a team only on the tennis court. They are totally different personalities and do not share any interests or spend any time with each other. Early in their career, they bonded together because they were hungry for success. When success came with bags of money, ego took over. 

Paes is a born leader, and can never play a subordinate role. It is like putting him in chains. Bhupathi, with a bag full of Grand Slam titles, grew in stature and rightfully wants to be his own man and not be dominated by Paes. 

This is the crux of the matter and, in my view, at this stage insoluble.

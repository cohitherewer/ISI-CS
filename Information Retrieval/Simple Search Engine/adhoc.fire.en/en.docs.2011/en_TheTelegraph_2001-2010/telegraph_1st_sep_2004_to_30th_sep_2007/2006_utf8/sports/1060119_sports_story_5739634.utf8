 No magic potion to beat cancer: Lance

 - Without the illness I would never have been forced to re-evaluate my life

Johannesburg: Lance Armstrong says theres no secret potion for beating cancer. 

The seven-time Tour de France winner, who is on a fund raising trip to South Africa, said he kept a positive attitude throughout his battle with the disease and that his illness helped his focus on things that were important to him. 

I have no magic potion, although there are some who think I do, Armstrong said on Wednesday, laughing in a reference to doping allegations against him. 

The retired American cyclist has denied allegations in a French newspaper that he used banned blood-booster epo during his first Tour triumph in 1999. 

If you dominate a world sport you will always have questions and doubts, Armstrong said. Perhaps at the end of the day we were too successful. When you win the Tour once, twice, seven times, it is just too hard to believe. 

Armstrong, who uses his celebrity status to raise money and awareness in the fight against cancer, arrived in South Africa on Tuesday. 

He is to attend a fund raising dinner for his host, Unite 4 Health, a social investment programme initiated by a South African pharmaceutical company. 

Armstrong believes he would have never won cyclings most prestigious race if he hadnt had cancer. All of his Tour victories came after he overcame testicular cancer, which was diagnosed in 1996. 

Without the illness I would never have been forced to re-evaluate my life and my career, Armstrong said. I know if I had not had cancer, I would not have on the Tour de France.

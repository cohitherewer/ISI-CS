The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Sreesanth admits he was under pressure

 - Local icon needed 134 tickets and complimentaries to oblige family, friends 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Kochi: Please pray for me... was Sreesanths standard response whenever a well-wisher called in the lead-up to the fourth ODI, played here on Thursday. 

Sreesanth himself went to a temple on match-eve and his prayers had two objectives: That he make the Team India XI and, secondly, be in a position to oblige family and friends with complimentaries and tickets. 

Yes, I was under pressure... Playing at home can be tough for a number of reasons. However, once I bowled the first ball, I realised it was just another match... Sreesanth told The Telegraph at the team hotel (Taj Malabar). 

The local icon, who made his India debut as recently as last October, wasnt given more than one spell but that was enough to take at least one wicket (Matt Priors, via an away-swinger) on a ground hed grown up playing on. 

Its great that my first match at home resulted in a win which gave India the series... Wow is all that Im able to say, Sreesanth remarked, grinning. He added: Please note we havent lost a series each time that Ive been in the squad... 

The pressure, it seems, was more to arrange tickets and complimentaries. 

Actually, yes... Believe it or not, I had to manage 134 complimentaries and tickets... I got quite a few from teammates, then I requested the Sirs in the association to help out with complimentaries... Still, I had to buy 50 tickets, Sreesanth informed. 

Parents V.S.Nair-Savithri Devi and all three siblings, incidentally, led the cheering.

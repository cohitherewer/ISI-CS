 Tendulkar injury 

Centurion: Sachin Tendulkar overcame a jittery start and finally found some touch, scoring 55 off 97 balls, but there was an injury scare over the maestro. 

Sachin received a sharp blow on his left forearm from Andre Nel, which needed medical attention on the field. 

He was eventually dismissed soon after reaching his 74th ODI half-century, brilliantly caught at covers by AB de Villiers off Justin Kemp. 

The injury forced him to stay off the field during South Africas innings and he was substituted by Mohammed Kaif.

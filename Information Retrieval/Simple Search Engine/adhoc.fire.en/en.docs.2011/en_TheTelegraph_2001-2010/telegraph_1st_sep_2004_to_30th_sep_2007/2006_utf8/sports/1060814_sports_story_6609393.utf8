 Atwal, Jeev miss cut

Castle Rock: Arjun Atwal and Jeev Milkha Singh missed cut after the second round at The International. 

Though thr Indians completed their round on Friday, about 70 players had to return on Saturday morning to finish the second round after Fridays action was halted following a heavy thunderstorm. The half-way cut fell at six points. 

Atwal had a second round tally of six points, while Jeev had a minus six. 

Swedens Daniel Chopra came through the first cut with a fine second round that saw him pick up nine points, but in the third round on Saturday, he scored minus two to crash out. His points tally after three days was six, way below the third round cut of 15 points. 

Meanwhile, Zach Johnson took sole lead as he birdied five holes and eagled one to score 15 points in third round and take his tally to 27. 

Title for Dyson 

In Zandvoort, Briton Simon Dyson claimed his second title of the season when he beat Australian Richard Green at the first extra hole of a sudden-death playoff in the Dutch Open on Sunday. 

Dysons birdie separated the pair, who had finished on 14-under-par 270, a stroke ahead of Irelands Damien McGrane.

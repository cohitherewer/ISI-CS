 Dravid basks in glory, Inzy stresses on confidence

INDRANIL MAJUMDAR

Karachi: If Rahul Dravid can breathe easy these days, Inzamam-ul Haq is facing the brunt of the outrage. Be it the man on the street, the local media or former captains, the common refrain has been that Pakistan have shied away from the challenge in the one-dayers. This has been reflected in the meek body language of the players. 

Add to it the persistent criticism over their batting order. The Pakistan captain, though, is staying focused. The situation is such that its difficult for me to decide on so many views, he quipped, after practice on Saturday. To keep away from the agony, he has switched himself off by deciding not to watch TV or read newspapers. 

Not without reason, Inzamam stressed on the confidence factor going into the final match of the Hutch Cup on Sunday. If a fortnight is a long time in sports, Inzamam has learnt it the hard way. Having won the Test series at the National Stadium here, he is now struggling to bring back some pride and confidence in the one-day team. 

The Indian captain, on the other hand, is basking in the glory of a turnaround in fortunes. I have gone through a difficult ten days on this tour. We showed the determination to come out well? The credit goes to the whole group, the coaching and support staff included, Dravid said. 

While giving full credit to the visitors, Inzamam feels that their fielding has been the key to the 3-1 lead. The main difference between the two teams has been the Indian fielding. In high scoring games on subcontinent pitches, every run saved comes in handy. 

It is no secret that the trio of Yuvraj Singh, Mohammed Kaif and Suresh Raina have given a new dimension to the fielding. There is more vigour and enthusiasm on the field. This seems to have rubbed off on the others as well. 

In keeping with Greg Chappells novel ideas of bringing more variety at practice sessions, the players were divided into groups, blindfolded and made to pass through certain obstacles on the field. The concerned player could move with directions from within his group. This is supposed to increase agility. 

Dravid once again stressed on the development theory. The team is pretty settled. Weve done well in one-dayers in the last few months. Obviously we will look to improve certain things. That process will be on? 

The India captain felt that both the Test and one-day teams have good balance. We are heading in a good direction. Weve tried out several things and it has worked. Some of the youngsters have developed and matured beyond their years because of the challenges they have been subjected to. 

Dravid made it clear that there will be no let up in Indias efforts on Sunday. We would like to win every game. This is an opportunity to give youngsters to handle difficult match situations in international cricket. Only the other day, Suresh Raina showed what a phenomenal player he is.

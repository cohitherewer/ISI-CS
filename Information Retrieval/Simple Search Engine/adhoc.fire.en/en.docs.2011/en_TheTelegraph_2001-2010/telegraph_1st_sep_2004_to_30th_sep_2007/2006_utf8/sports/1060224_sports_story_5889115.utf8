The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 We lacked planning, says Bhutia

 New Delhi: The Indian football 

 squad, which arrived in the capital on Thursday after a 

 disastrous campaign against Japan in Yokohama, wore a shattered 

 look. While most members chose to maintain a stony silence 

 and were eager to retreat to their hotel rooms, a few like 

 skipper Bhaichung Bhutia had forced smiles on their faces.

 We lacked both in planning 

 and preparation, Bhutia said. No doubt they 

 are a far superior side, but we could have been a little 

 more prepared. What we did in the name of preparation here 

 was far from adequate, he added.

 Bhutia felt there was no need 

 to do any kind of postmortem. They beat us in all 

 departments of the game. And then, we played below our level.

 Chief coach Syed Nayeemuddin was 

 far from his usual aggressive self. After all, they 

 are a World Cup side, he almost whispered when AIFF 

 general secretary Alberto Colaco offered his hands. My 

 only consolation is that my boys played bravely and had 

 no fear about playing World Cuppers.

 Team manager P.K. Banerjee, however, 

 was no ready to blame anyone.

 Believe me, they were simply 

 too good, was his initial reaction. I dont 

 blame my boys. They fought gallantly. But the difference 

 in class was too much. Lets see what we can do against 

 Yemen here.

 Bhutia had a more cautious reaction 

 on the Yemen match on Wednesday. We have to plan and 

 prepare in a better fashion in order to win that match. 

 We should know how to play with the ball. No one should 

 take things for granted.

 Meanwhile, Nayeem has called in 

 Rajat Ghosh Dastidar, M. Suresh, Deepak Mondal and Micky 

 Fernandes.

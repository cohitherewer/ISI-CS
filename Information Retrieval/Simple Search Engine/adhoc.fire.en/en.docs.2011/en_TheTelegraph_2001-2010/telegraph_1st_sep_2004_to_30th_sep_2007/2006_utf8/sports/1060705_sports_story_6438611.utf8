 Figo, Cristiano in doubt: Scolari

 Munich: Portugal captain 

 Luis Figo is in doubt for the semi-final against France 

 while winger Cristiano Ronaldo is also struggling to regain 

 fitness, coach Luiz Felipe Scolari said on Tuesday.

 Figo picked up a thigh strain 

 in the quarter final win over England. Ronaldo played with 

 a thigh injury and complained that the problem slowed him 

 down in the later stages of the match.

 Figo and Cristiano have 

 been training well. They know they have problems and we 

 need to check how they are to see if they can play, 

 Scolari said. 

 The possibility is that 

 Cristiano has a bigger chance and Figo a little bit less. 

 But we cant say anything right now. Historically, 

 we have a big disadvantage against France. 

 He also took a swipe at his own 

 playing career on Tuesday, saying he made the ball cry.

 Its a shame that players 

 such as Zidane and Figo are getting older. We would like 

 to see them play for another seven, eight or 15 years. The 

 ball doesnt cry at their feet. When I played, I made 

 the ball cry. They have had their own training schedule, 

 he added.

 History and a revitalised Zinedine 

 Zidane suggest France will have the upper hand on Wednesday. 

 The 1998 champions have fond memories of semi-final clashes 

 with the Portuguese, having met them twice at that stage 

 in European Championships ? in 1984 and 2000. Les Bleus 

 won both matches after close battles and, each time, 

 went on to win the title.

 The 34-year-old Zidane seems to 

 have recaptured his brilliant best and was magnificent in 

 Frances 1-0 win over holders Brazil in the quarter-finals.

 After eliminating pre-tournament 

 favourites Brazil to reach the semis, the French are bracing 

 for the worse in Munich on Wednesday.

 It will be tough? Tougher 

 than Brazil, Lilian Thuram said. 

 Its a semi-final, 

 more pressure. They also want to get to the final, 

 Franck Ribery said. Defensively theyre stronger 

 than Brazil and they have good players in attack.

 Meanwhile, France will play in 

 white for the third time in a row.

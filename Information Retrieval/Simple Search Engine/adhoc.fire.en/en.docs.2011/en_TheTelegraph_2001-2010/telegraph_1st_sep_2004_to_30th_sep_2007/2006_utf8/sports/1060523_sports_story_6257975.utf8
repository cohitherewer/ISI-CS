The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 I see Laras appointment as another stop-gap measure...

 - A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL 

 - JEFFREY DUJON ON WICKETKEEPING, COACHING AND MORE? 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Jeff Dujon 

Basseterre (St Kitts): Jeffrey Dujon was a key member of the great West Indies team captained by Clive Lloyd (and, later, Viv Richards). He wasnt just a terrific wicketkeeper, but good with the bat ? testimony being 3,322 runs at an average of 31.94 in 81 Tests and nearly 2,000 runs in 169 ODIs. In a decade-long career, he had 272 victims in Tests and 204 in ODIs. A former assistant coach, Dujon spoke to The Telegraph in Kingston the other afternoon. 

 The following are 

 excerpts 

 On what keeps him 

 busy 

 (Laughs) Giving interviews! 

 As youve seen, Im part of the TV commentary 

 team... Till recently, I was Jamaicas national coaching 

 director, but there was a difference of opinion... The vision 

 that I had wasnt getting the support it needed... 

 Ive also served as a regional development officer 

 of the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB)... In fact, if you 

 recall, I was the West Indies teams assistant coach 

 for a couple of years... Now, Im trying to establish 

 myself in a new role. 

 On the quality of 

 keeping in the present times 

 Its not as good as it used 

 to be, say, in the Eighties... Nor is it as bad as its 

 made out... Teams now want to strike a balance and the focus 

 is more on finding batsmen who can keep... Wicketkeepers 

 who predominantly are batsmen... 

 On whether hes 

 comfortable with that

 Its not such a bad thing. 

 The days of Bob Taylor and Wasim Bari are over... (After 

 a pause) I myself came on the scene (1981) when teams 

 were beginning to look for wicketkeepers who could effectively 

 be allrounders. 

 On the qualities he 

 would look for in a keeper 

 Good hands, agility and mental 

 strength. A wicketkeeper is expected to be perfect, but 

 he cant be and, so, should have it in him to handle 

 the pressure of a dropped catch or whatever? He will continue 

 making mistakes if he isnt mentally strong. 

 On his idol 

 Ive never been big on heroes 

 and idols, but it would be my father, Leroy... He played 

 only one first-class match (for Jamaica), though. 

 On whether he envied a contemporary

 I focused on my game. 

 On having kept to some of the fastest 

 bowlers ever 

 Depending on the conditions, each 

 one was (at different times) difficult to keep to... 

 The thing about wicketkeeping is not to repeat mistakes. 

 On whether its time to include keepers 

 in the allrounders category 

 Absolutely... In my book, wicketkeepers 

 have always been so... Its a question of accepting 

 that... 

 On the finest keeper of the present 

 times 

 If you want an honest answer, 

 then its that I cant say. Reason being I havent 

 seen all and it wouldnt be proper making a comment 

 on the basis of what Ive seen on the TV... Moreover, 

 we largely get to see the ODIs and the limited overs games 

 arent the best place to judge a keeper... Ive 

 not just got to see all, but see them in varying conditions. 

 On Mahendra Singh Dhoni 

 Ive only seen him live 

 in two matches... He couldnt do so in the second ODI, 

 but its interesting that Dhoni could turn a match 

 on its head... He has looked competent behind the sticks, 

 not that he has had much to do... Dhoni must play according 

 to what is demanded... If he does, then he shouldnt 

 be worrying about pressure. 

 On Carlton Baugh (Jr)

 Fundamentally, he needs to improve... 

 He must pay attention to a few things... As a batsman, he 

 has it to be explosive, which is why hes there in 

 the ODIs... (After a pause) When the Test series 

 arrives, I expect Denesh Ramdin to be back... Hes 

 a better keeper, but his work behind the sticks has 

 suffered probably because of overconfidence... Perhaps, 

 it could be fatigue, too. Ramdin, however, is a natural. 

 On Adam Gilchrist

 Is a fantastic batsman-wicketkeeper... 

 While I dont need to talk about his batting, I feel 

 hes average behind the sticks... Of course, he keeps 

 very well to Shane Warne, but Ive seen him make mistakes 

 standing back. 

 On India having capped a number of keepers 

 in the post-Nayan Mongia period 

 I suppose it had everything to 

 do with the talent available... I know we arent blessed 

 with many wicketkeepers, but your selectors would have a 

 much wider pool to choose from. When the numbers are more, 

 there is some instability. 

 On whether the West Indies performances 

 in recent years has hurt

 It has been disappointing... It 

 has been painful... My belief is that the administrators 

 and selectors caused the decline of West Indies cricket... 

 Hopefully, were now on the road to recovery... There 

 may be pain in this period of recovery as well. 

 On Brian Lara getting back the captaincy

 Im not sure what to say... 

 To develop, the West Indies team needs leadership... Weve 

 got to develop leaders... Got to develop tacticians and 

 not be dependant on Laras batting... I think weve 

 waited far too long to develop leaders... Frankly, I see 

 Laras appointment as another stop-gap measure... If 

 the powers-that-be cant find a leader from within 

 this group, well, then look outside... Somebody somewhere 

 with leadership potential could just be waiting... 

 On having played under one of the great 

 captains, Lloyd

 He was a leader... He got 

 a lot of big players to gel... Got them to play for the 

 team... 

 On the repeated dispute between the players 

 and the WICB over contracts 

 No comments. 

 On whether the 2007 World Cup is going 

 to help cricket in the West Indies ward off the threat from 

 basketball and baseball 

 We do have youngsters coming into 

 cricket, what we lack is proper coaching... The World Cup 

 will generate a lot of interest and leave us with improved 

 infrastructure. How its going to be used remains to 

 be seen. 

 On the West Indies, too, having opted 

 for a coach (Bennett King) from overseas 

 The funny thing about the West 

 Indies is that people dont tend to have faith in their 

 own... Dont have confidence in their own... As if 

 we dont know what the next level is or that we cant 

 take the team there... The employment of a coach from overseas 

 stems from a colonial mentality... If I can add, the powers 

 given to King ? hes a selector, for example ? were 

 never given to any of our own coaches... 

 On Team India 

 Batting remains a strong point. 

 On why Australia stays ahead 

 (Grins) Because the Australians 

 are better than the others, its a simple answer. They 

 plan better, execute better and are supremely confident. 

 Then, there has been consistency with selection... What 

 else do you need? 

 On the ICCs push towards more technology

 A balance needs to be struck and 

 those in authority should understand that being 100 per 

 cent right may not actually be 100 per cent right for the 

 game... 

 On Twenty20 beginning to be promoted in 

 a big way 

 Like one-day cricket, it will 

 provide entertainment. Yet, those who love watching Test 

 cricket are going to continue doing so. That will always 

 be the purest form, with the others largely giving financial 

 support... (Adds emotionally) For me, every moment 

 of Test cricket was an experience... 

 Lastly, his tips for youngsters

 Get the fundamentals right and, 

 then, keep improving with hours of practice... Of course, 

 dont repeat mistakes as they get noticed more than 

 a difficult take or a great catch.

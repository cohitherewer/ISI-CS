 Kaif hits 91, guides UP to safety

Kanpur: Mohammad Kaif hit a valuable 91 and helped defending champions Uttar Pradesh reach a respectable 249 for eight on Day One of the Ranji Trophy Super League match against Karnataka on Saturday. 

Kaif, who had special security arrangements for him in view of threat from fans who were unhappy with team Indias showing in South Africa, rescued the hosts from a precarious 17 for three in 12 overs after electing to bat. 

The skipper put on a crucial 80-run partnership with Ravikant Shukla and then added another 66 runs with Jyoti Yadav.

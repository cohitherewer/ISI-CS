The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Star Perfection has the edge 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Amorina and Star Perfection stand out in the field of four vying for Sunday afternoons star event, the 1,600m Calcutta 1000 Guineas, the first Classic of the season.

 Both fillies have been impressive in their preparatory events leading to the Classic. Although Amorina beat nothing of consequence in the monsoon Derby, she was never off the bridle all through the 2,000m trip. The Steinbeck filly had also placed behind Real Excellence in the second start of her career. But sources close to trainer Vijay Singh feel the filly has improved significantly.

 Star Perfection, on the other hand, boasts of matching strides against some of the best of her age in the southern and western centres. This factor gives a clear edge to Star Perfection who is also by Steinbeck. Colm Donoghue partners the Daniel David-trained filly.Read as: Sl. nos, last 4 runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:

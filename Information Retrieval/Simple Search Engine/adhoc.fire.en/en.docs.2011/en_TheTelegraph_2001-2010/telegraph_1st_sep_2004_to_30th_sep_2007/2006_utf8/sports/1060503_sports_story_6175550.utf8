 3 changes in WI squad

St Johns: The West Indies have increased their squad to 14 for the third and fourth limited-overs Internationals against Zimbabwe on Saturday and Sunday at Guyanas Bourda Oval. 

Left-handed opening batsman Sewnarine Chattergoon, who hails from Guyana, is the only complete newcomer of the three replacements brought into the squad. 

Fast bowler Tino Best and Chinaman bowler Dave Mohammed are the other players who have been added. Allrounder Dwayne Bravo and left-arm medium-fast bowler Ian Bradshaw are the players to make room from the 13 named for the first two matches. 

West Indies captain Brian Lara had indicated last week when he was appointed to the position for the third time that he would like to see more players exposed ahead of the 2007 ICC World Cup in the West Indies.

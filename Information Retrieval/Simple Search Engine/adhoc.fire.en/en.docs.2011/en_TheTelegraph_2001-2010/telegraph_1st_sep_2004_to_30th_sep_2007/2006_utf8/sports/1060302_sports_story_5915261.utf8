 Morton century to no avail

 - NZ ride Vincents 102 

Sydney: New Zealand crushed West Indies by 91 runs at McLean Park in Napier on Wednesday to take a 4-0 lead in their five-match series. 

New Zealand piled on 324 for six from their 50 overs, then restricted the West Indies to 233 for eight to complete another lop-sided victory with only Saturdays final match in Auckland remaining. 

New Zealand opener Lou Vincent completed his second ODI hundred with a brilliant 102 off 117 balls. Nathan Astle (81 off 88 balls) and Stephen Fleming (67 off 59) both chalked up half-centuries. 

Runako Morton registered his maiden ODI hundred with an unbeaten 110 for the West Indies while Ramnaresh Sarwan made 42 and skipper Shivnarine Chanderpaul 30. 

Fleming gave himself an early mark to allow super sub Jeetan Patel to join the game and later said he was surprised by the tourists apparent lack of urgency with the bat. 

Vincent struck 10 boundaries and a six to reach his second century after making 172 against Zimbabwe in Bulawayo last August, while Astle hit four fours and three sixes to follow up his century on Saturday. 

Fleming slammed six boundaries and four sixes as he and Vincent put on 106.

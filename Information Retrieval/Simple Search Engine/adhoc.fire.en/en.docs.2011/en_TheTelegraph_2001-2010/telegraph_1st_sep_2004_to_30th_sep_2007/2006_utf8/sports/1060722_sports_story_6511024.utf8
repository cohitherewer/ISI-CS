 Syces stir on 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Horses remain indoors for the second day as the RCTC syces continue their strike, which the Calcutta Racehorse Owner Society (CROS) says illegal. The stir prompted the RCTC stewards cancel last Fridays races. 

 Syces are demanding payment of dearness allowance without signing an agreement, despite CROS insistence since January this year.

 They (syces) should have given a mandatory 14-day notice with their charter of demands. Still, we are prepared for negotiations; said M.L.Choudhary, president, CROS.

 Meanwhile, syces body, the RCTC Karmachari Union, will hold a meeting on Saturday.

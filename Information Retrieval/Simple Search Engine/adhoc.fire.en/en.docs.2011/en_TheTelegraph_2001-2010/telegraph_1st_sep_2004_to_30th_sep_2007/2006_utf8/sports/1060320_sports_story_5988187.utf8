The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 City teams may play at neutral venues

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: The National Football League matches scheduled in Calcutta during April, including the derby tie between East Bengal and Mohun Bagan, may be shifted to neutral venues, according to AIFF general secretary Alberto Colaco. 

Speaking to The Telegraph, Colaco said that the IFA has informed him of its inability to host the matches after West Bengal polices refusal to grant permission in light of the forthcoming general elections in the state. The IFA is yet to reconfirm their stand, but in case it remains the same, we will be forced to shift the matches to neutral venues. 

The AIFF has already identified three venues ? Delhi, Bangalore and Calicut ? for the matches. Without shifting the matches to neutral venues, we will not be able to finish the league in time, Colaco said. We first planned to finish the NFL by May 11, but under the present circumstances, it may not be possible, Colaco said. 

The biggest problem is that none of the three neutral venues has floodlight facilities. Zee Sports wants the matches to be held under floodlights since it generates better viewership.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Ntini most popular in SA

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Fast bowler Makhaya Ntini has been voted as South Africas most popular sportsperson among adults for the second consecutive year, according to 2006 BMI Adult Sporttrack. 

He was chosen ahead of soccer stars Lucas Radebe, Benny McCarthy, Siyabonga Nomvete and Doctor Khumalo, according to information received here. 

Ntini was also recently voted the most popular sportsperson among juniors (2006 BMI Junior Sporttrack), and is notably the first non-soccer player to hold this position in both the adult and junior categories. 

Shaun Pollock moved up from 11th spot in 2005 to 8th position overall in the 2006 adult survey. Pollock is once again the only sportsperson to be voted in the top 10 across all race groups, which he similarly achieved in the 2006 junior survey. Jacques Kallis is in 13th place overall in the adult survey. 

Cricket remains the second-most popular sport among both adults and juniors, with a combined spectator base of 11.3 million while soccer continues to hold the top position, with rugby and athletics in third and fourth places, respectively. 

Cricket South Africa CEO Gerald Majola said: Makhaya is a role model to the youth of South Africa as well as a wonderful advertisement for the sport around the world. 

The fact that a cricketer has been acknowledged through research as the most popular sports person in the country is a massive achievement, he said.

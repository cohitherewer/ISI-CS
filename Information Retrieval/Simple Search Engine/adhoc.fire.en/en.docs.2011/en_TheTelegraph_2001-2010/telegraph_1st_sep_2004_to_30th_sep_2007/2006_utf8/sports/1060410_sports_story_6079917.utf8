 England paying for Test obsession

 Guest Column 

 Mike Atherton

How will Englands tour of India be judged in the weeks to come? Given the ravages of injuries and illness and the wholehearted effort which brought a heroic draw in Mumbai, will it be judged a modest success? 

Or, as this one-day series has become the most one-sided since the Christians were thrown to the lions, will it be seen as a miserable failure? 

My suspicion, in England at least, is that the more charitable view will prevail. If so, it will tell us much about English attitudes to the respective forms of the game and offer a clue as to why England continue to fare so badly at one-day cricket. 

The aftermath of the Mumbai Test match was similar to most other tours in recent history. Rightly, the players celebrated their achievement long and hard, took a couple of days to recuperate before scanning the one-day itinerary and wishing the next three weeks of their life away. 

One or two specialists headed home thanking their lucky stars they were to be spared the ordeal. Other specialists, who had spent some time acclimatising to conditions while being made to feel alienated from the Test squad, joined up. 

As ever, some looked for excuses to travel home. Some did. The injury to Stephen Harmison deprived the squad of a first-choice player, and prevented Matthew Hoggard from enjoying a holiday with his wife in Goa. 

Hoggard eventually made it to South India, but, having been belted all around Kochi, rather wished he hadnt. Andrew Flintoffs trip home to see his new-born meant that the one-day squad began their preparations without their captain and most important player. Reports filtered through that Englands best one-day batsman was preparing for the new season in the nets at Taunton. 

The mood caught on. As happens every tour, the cricket correspondents of the broadsheets headed home cheerily (Angus Fraser was this years honourable exception), wishing their number twos all the luck in the world filing from Guwahati and Jamshedpur. 

Keep in touch, they chortled, before heading off to recharge their batteries for the start of the English season. 

Andrew Strauss rested from the one-day warm-up match in Jaipur, so England began the tournament with a virgin opening combination. 

Faridabad, the venue for the second game, was just a bit too far from where the team were staying in Delhi and it was just too much of a hassle to trek out there to practise the day before. 

And so, even before the players got to enjoy the smell of tea leaves in the glorious state of Assam, the series was over. Just like virtually every other winter for the last decade and a half. 

England have always treated the one-day game as the poor relation of Test cricket. The coaching, the talk, the tactics all centred on trying to produce Test match batsmen. And so, by and large, England produced stiff-wristed, technically sound, low-intensity players. When the England coach, Mickey Stewart, brought in specialist help in 1989 it was to Geoffrey Boycott he turned. Kevin Pietersen, Englands best one-day player, is a product not of England but of South Africa. 

The 1987 World Cup seemed to confirm this view: Englands greatest players, David Gower and Ian Botham, took a sabbatical preferring to save their energies for the winters Tests. 

When I became an England player myself, the administrators confirmed the low esteem in which one-day cricket was held. 

While other nations played fewer Tests and more 50-over one-day Internationals, while they played triangular tournaments in coloured clothing, under floodlights with a white ball and strange fielding restrictions, England continued to play 55-over matches with conventional rules, in whites with a red ball. And just three matches only, as an hors doeuvre to the main event. In a one-day career spanning nine years I played only 54 matches. 

When Englands selectors choose their captain, they do so with Test match cricket in mind. In handing the job to Michael Vaughan, Alec Stewart, Nasser Hussain and myself ? all players with only moderate to okay one-day records ? was the potential problem of one-day cricket ever discussed? I doubt it. 

And the only England player in my time who openly expressed a preference for one-day cricket was Darren Gough, who retired from Tests to prolong his one-day career. I dont suppose its a coincidence that he has been one of our better one-day performers in recent years. 

It is not that Englands players try less hard to win one-day matches, but, through no fault of their own, through a process of osmosis the attitude that it doesnt matter as much if you lose has seeped in. 

That is probably just as well: with match blurring into match, if the players took a one-day defeat as badly as they do a Test defeat, manic depression would soon set in. 

When, the night before a one-day International, Flintoff stayed up into the early hours of the morning to receive his Sports Personality of the Year Award, there was scarcely a whisper about his professionalism, or lack of it. I cant imagine he would have stayed up so late the night before a Test match. 

India, of course, have the opposite attitude. Crowds throng to the one-day games; they lionise an unproven Test match performer like Mahendra Singh Dhoni, and the television companies charge three times the advertising rates for one-day games. For them, Test matches are the hors doeuvre to the main event. 

I readily admit to being part of the problem myself: I feel Test cricket is a far superior game to one-day cricket; it is a tougher test of all-round skill, of mental strength and of stamina; its also more complex, demanding much more tactical flexibility than one-day cricket. 

Im glad England havent yet gone down the Indian route. But, it doesnt change the fact that the dominance of one-day cricket is here to stay. If the England team dont want to experience another hellish week like the one that lies ahead of them now, with only pride at stake, they had better get used to the idea.

 Europe take charge 

Straffan (Ireland): Helped by Darren Clarkes emotional victory, Sergio Garcias clutch play and a late mistake by Jim Furyk, Europe took a slim lead after a closely fought opening day at the Ryder Cup. 

Europe led 5-3 after Fridays first day of play, in which Garcia won twice, and seven of the eight matches came down to the 18th hole. It marked the fifth straight time Europe have led after the opening day.

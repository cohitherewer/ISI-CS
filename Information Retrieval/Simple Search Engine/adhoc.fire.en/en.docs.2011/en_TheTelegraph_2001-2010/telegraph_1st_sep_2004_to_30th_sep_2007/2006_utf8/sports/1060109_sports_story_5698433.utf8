 England face the pace dilemma

 - TOUR OF INDIA 

 SCYLD BERRY

 Simon Jones and Michael Vaughan 

A sixth quick bowler or a third seamer for Englands Test tour of India: that is the question which will be keenly debated before Friday by the national selectors, David Graveney OBE, Duncan Fletcher OBE, and Geoff Miller, who as he bowled off-breaks for Derbyshire, is just a plain OB. 

It is important they make the right decision during their telephone link-ups before Englands 16-man Test squad and 15-man one-day party are announced at 11.30 am on Friday. 

England have already slipped down to third place in world Test rankings, and have to win this series and knock India out of second place if they are going to depose Australia in foreseeable future. 

At least England should be able to play their first-choice team in India as Simon Jones rehabilitation is going well and he is off to Chennai before the end of this month to test out his ankle at the Dennis Lillee academy. 

Going with him are not only Sajid Mahmood of Lancashire and Mark Footitt of Nottinghamshire, who might turn into the left-arm pace bowler England have been looking for since John Lever surprised in India in 1976-77, but Troy Cooley and Kevin Shine, an indication that the former Somerset coach has a chance of becoming Englands bowling coach in succession to Cooley in May. 

A second encouragement is that India have always been much more sympathetic than Pakistan to Englands pace bowlers. No England quick bowler has taken as many as 15 Test wickets in Pakistan and England have won only two Tests there. 

Indian pitches have always offered more to English bowlers of every kind, and starting in 1933-34, England have won 10 Tests there. 

The first Test will be in Nagpur. For the last Test there, a green pitch was supplied and the Australian fast bowlers cashed in (Jason Gillespie with nine for 80) and won. It is difficult to imagine the same conditions again, especially in March. 

The best chance for Matthew Hoggard, Steve Harmison, Andrew Flintoff and Jones ? and therefore for England ? probably lies in the second Test at Mohali, a suburb of Chandigarh, at the foot of the Himalayas. It Aint Half Hot will still apply but when England played there in December 2002 the pitch had a covering of grass and good carry, so that Hoggard swung the ball, and not just when it was new. 

If England are to play to their strength, and field four fast bowlers in these first two Tests, will Liam Plunkett be sufficient as the only back-up? 

He has surely taken over the No.5 spot because he has a wonderful temperament for a 20-year-old and he can bat. But is there space also for James Anderson, who is getting his rhythm back, and, if one of the Big Four dropped out before Mohali, would probably bowl better than Plunkett because he can swing the ball more? 

The third Test in Mumbai could be a completely different ball-game. Pakistan have never produced a minefield for their spinners on any England tour there, but India have. 

A grossly under-prepared pitch was served up for England in Mumbai in 1981-82, and again for Australia on their last visit; so grossly under-prepared that the occasional left-arm spinner Michael Clarke took six wickets for nine runs. 

In such conditions it might be perverse to stick to four seamers and one spinner ? especially if Michael Vaughans right knee, after his operation in December, proves too unstable to allow him to bowl his off-breaks again. 

England would have to play a second spinner, and if you are certain to field two spinners in one match, the received wisdom in the sub-continent is that you have to have three in the party. When Shane Warne was injured before that Mumbai Test, Australia had only one other specialist spinner, and lost by 13 runs. 

Ashley Giles, going through rehabilitation after his right hip operation, is still Englands first-choice spinner by a street. If a reliable off-spinner is needed for Mumbai, the selectors do not have to look beyond Shaun Udal, if only because there are no reliable off-spinners beyond him. 

Alex Loudon, the third spinner in Pakistan, is reported to have made a good impression when he was seconded before the end of that tour to the spin academy in Mumbai.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 J amp;K may lose out due to terror 

 threat

 - AIFF looking at alternative venues 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Santosh Trophy

 New Delhi: Concerned over 

 the recent spate of terrorist activities in Jammu and Kashmir, 

 the All India Football Federation (AIFF) may be forced to 

 rethink before allowing the state to host the Santosh Trophy.

 According to sources, some of 

 the AIFF members have requested the federation to look into 

 the security aspects before giving the go-ahead to J amp;K 

 to host the prestigious national meet after a gap of 28 

 years.

 Srinagar hosted the Santosh Trophy 

 way back in 1978 when Bengal, led by Gautam Sarkar, defeated 

 Goa in the final by a solitary goal.

 Initially, there was no 

 problem in hosting the meet in J amp;K, said an AIFF 

 official. But the killing of a few tourists recently 

 by terrorists has forced us to rethink.

 The official said that though 

 the final decision is pending, the J amp;K Football Association 

 (JKFA) may be asked to submit a report in this regard. An 

 AIFF team may visit the state to assess the situation.

 What has upset the AIFF further 

 is that the JKFA has proposed that it wont stage all 

 the matches in Srinagar.

 The AIFF feels that such a step 

 could spell further trouble as there may not be enough security 

 arrangements for participating teams in distant districts.

 The AIFF is believed to be looking 

 for an alternative venue in the northern part of the country 

 and has received encouraging response from states such as 

 Haryana and Punjab. While Haryana has proposed Gurgaon as 

 a venue, Punjab, too, is keen on staging the tournament 

 after a gap of 30 years. 

 The AIFF originally planed to 

 host the Santosh Trophy in September, followed by the Federation 

 Cup.

 Now it could be the other way 

 round as Zee Television is reportedly keen on finishing 

 the Federation Cup before the Durga Puja. It has been learnt 

 that Calcutta could once again be the venue for the event.

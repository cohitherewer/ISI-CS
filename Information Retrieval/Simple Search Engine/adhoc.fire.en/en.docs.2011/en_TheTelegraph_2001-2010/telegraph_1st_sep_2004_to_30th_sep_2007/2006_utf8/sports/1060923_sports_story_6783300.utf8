Calcutta: The tennis gods sure love a spectacle. They are also sympathetic towards the Calcuttans, bloated silly after being continuously rain-soaked for three days and three nights. 

So they decided to pit two players both with the looks and fan following matched only by a movie star and coincidentally fighting their comeback battles, albeit on a different scale in a semi-final that promises to give Kabhi Alvida Na Kehna a run for its money. 

But both Martina Hingis and Sania Mirza had to play out of their skins at one stage to make this fairy tale possible. 

We all knew Aravane Rezai, the French girl of Iranian descent, possesses a killer backhand. Well, so it happened that on the day, the pin-up girl of Indian tennis arrived at the Netaji Indoor Stadium armed with a forehand deadlier than the AK-47 which Mikhail Kalashnikov invented. 

In the quarter finals of the WTA Sunfeast Open on Friday, both girls stood on either side of the net and opened fire. After a baseline bloodbath lasting one hour and 45 minutes, Sania outgunned Rezai 6-4, 7-5.

A little later, the Swiss Miss came along to keep her part of the bargain. But Tamarine Tanasugarn had other ideas. 

The veteran Thai, who started off the blocks like Carl Lewis, achieved two breaks and went 3-0 up in the first set. But she soon appeared out of breath only for Hingis to catch up and clinch the first set 7-5. In the second, Tanasugarn completely ran out of gas and Hingis, with masterly precision, wrapped it up 6-2 in 1 hour and 20 minutes. 

Sania later turned up with partner Liezel Huber to beat Casey Dellacqua and Sunitha Rao 6-1, 6-4 to reach the doubles semi-finals, where they would meet Angelique Widjaja and Hana Sromova. 

In the other semi-final, Olga Poutchkova of Russia will meet Iroda Tulyaganova. 

The unheralded qualifier from Uzbekistan, Tulyaganova, a former world No.16, saw off the challenge from Alla Kudryavtseva of Russia 4-6, 6-2, 6-2. Poutchkova earlier defeated Italian Alberta Brianti 7-5, 6-3. 

The earlier quarter finals, played simultaneously from 2 pm, served as starters for the main course. 

When the main course did start, before anyone had settled down on their seats, Sania hit three amazing backhands and broke Rezai. The world No. 66 responded by pouncing on the Indians second serve. A crunching backhand and she broke back 1-1. In the games that followed, both players hit the crap out of the ball, with Sania breaking Rezai in the third and the French getting it back on the eighth. 

In the decisive ninth game, at 30-30 with Rezai serving, Sania hit a brute of a service return to go up 30-40. Under pressure, the French double faulted. Game Sania. 

Having smelt blood, Sania upped her game a few notches and cruised to a set point. Nerves, possibly, because she needed two more. A feather touch from the baseline ensured the first set in 43 minutes. 

Everyone expected Rezai to come back hard, and that she did, going up 3-1 with a break in the second set. An impatient Sania tried too hard, but ended up making an unforced error to see Rezai hold serve and go up 4-1. 

Just when the thoughts of a three-setter seeped in, from the sixth game, Sanias first serves started falling in place. Before Rezai knew it, the Indian idol snatched three consecutive games with a break in the middle to draw level at 4-4. 

Rezai held one more game, and that too after much ado, staving off an aggressive Sania, now egged on by a crowd of around 4000 who turned up despite the rain. 

The Indian never looked back. Holding serve for 5-5, the world No. 70 had three break points in the 11th game and converted one for the decisive break. 6-5. 

She completed the formalities when a Rezai return fell wide. 

It will never be known what inspired Tanasugarn, but may be the thoughts of a partisan crowd fired her imagination enough to bend her back that extra little bit in the first set. 

From the ninth game of the first set though, she started falling behind in pace, if not in spirit. For the world No. 9, the battle was over when she overcame her initial rustiness. 

The regal gait, supreme balance, adroit placements all returned as the five-time Grand Slam champion held her serve in the 11th game and went ahead for the first time in the match. It was inevitable that Tanasugarn would fail to hold her serve. She obliged. 

The rest was a mere cakewalk. Breaking the Thai in the second and eighth games of the second set, Hingis shut out the match in style. Tanasugarn was reduced to standing with hand on her hips. 

Sania had met Hingis only once. That Dubai meeting in hardcourt saw the Swiss beat her 6-3, 7-5. Will Sania get her own back or would the former world No. 1 prevail? 

 Answers on Super Saturday.

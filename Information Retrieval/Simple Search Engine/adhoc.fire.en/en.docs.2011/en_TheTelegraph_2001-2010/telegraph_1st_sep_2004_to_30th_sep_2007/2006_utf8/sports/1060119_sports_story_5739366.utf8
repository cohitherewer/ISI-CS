 Gaddafi Test is for the dustbin 

 - People have to understand that wickets are prepared by curators, not players or coaches: Woolmer

Faisalabad: With the elements having ruled the Gaddafi during the just-ended first Test, Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer wants even memories of that match consigned to the dustbin. 

Forget positives for any team, cricket got a lot of negatives ... Its best to send that Test to the dustbin ... Once thats done, lets move on, Woolmer told The Telegraph, shortly after arriving here on Wednesday evening. 

He added: For a cricketer, theres no worse sight than waking up on a match day and finding dark clouds ... We saw that on so many days in Lahore ... Having said that, one cant get upset but look to the next Test (here, from Saturday) and the one after that (in Karachi) ... 

Woolmer agreed with the point made in these columns that the flat wicket shouldnt be treated as the No. 1 culprit. Indeed, youve got to look at the time lost ... Less than half the overs could be bowled ? all because of the weather. 

Reiterating that he never interfered with curators, Woolmer felt any team which consistently encouraged wickets to suit its attack would actually be cheating. As he put it: Where Im concerned, thats not cricket and is definitely against the spirit of the game ... Such teams have to be berated ... 

Woolmer also hit out at those who acted irresponsibly by blaming either the captain or the coach: People have to understand that wickets are prepared by curators, not players or coaches ... 

A day earlier, captain Inzamam-ul Haq had snapped he was the captain, not the (Gaddafi) groundsman. 

Disagreeing that the momentum had been seized by India, Woolmer pointed out: The next match will be a new one and the past is past ... Not only each series, but every face-off begins with a 50-50 chance ... In fact, each day starts with that equation ... This has been my philosophy and wont change. 

Asked whether he was fine-tuning plans to snare Virender Sehwag, Woolmer responded grinning: Yes, but Im not going share anything with the Media ... Youve got to wait ... The Team India vice-captain has already taken as many as 1,236 runs off Pakistan ? average of 112-plus ? in seven Tests.

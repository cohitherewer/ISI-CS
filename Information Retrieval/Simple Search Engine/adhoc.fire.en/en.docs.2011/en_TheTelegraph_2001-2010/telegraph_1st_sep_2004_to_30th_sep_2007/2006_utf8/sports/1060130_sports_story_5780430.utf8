 Atwal in tied eighth spot

 Atwal had 3 birdies and 2 bogeys 

San Diego: Arjun Atwal ran into problems with his putter but remained calm to come back with a one-under 71 in the third round at Torrey Pines and stay in sight of a top-10 finish at the Buick Invitational. 

At eight-under 209, he is only three shots off the lead and in tied eighth place with a good chance of having a go at the leaders. 

Atwal had three birdies on the fourth, 13th and 16th holes along with two bogeys. He was somewhat wayward off the tee, but managed to play his irons very well. But on the unpredictable greens, he took as many as 30 putts, compared to 25 and 28 on first two days. Atwal had the best putting statistics on US Tour in 2005. 

Tiger Woods, lying 22nd at the midway stage, forced his way into contention with a fiery five-under 67 on the tough south course and was just one off the lead, shared by Spaniard Sergio Garcia (68) and American Rod Pampling at 11-under 205. 

Ten players, including Atwal, were separated by three shots going into the final round. 

Daniel Chopra, who was tied with Atwal in fifth place overnight, had a bad day with a five-over 77 that saw him slide to tied 42nd. Garcia overcame a double bogey on the second hole, but recovered, thanks to his putter, for a 68, just what Pampling shot. 

 Randhawa pulls out 

There wont be any more adventure sports for Indias Jyoti Randhawa for a while, at least not in between tournaments, adds another report from Doha. The former Asian Tour No. 1was forced to retire from the final round of the Qatar Masters this morning after the pain from bruised ribs became unbearable. 

Randhawa fell off a four-wheel bike during a desert safari in Doha on Monday but gritted his teeth for three rounds before deciding to pull out. (AGENCIES)

 Badrinath 

Melbourne: India A survived a scare before pulling off a thrilling three-wicket victory over New Zealand A in a four-day match of the Top End Series in Darwin on Friday. 

Chasing 206 for victory on the fourth and final day, the Indians were reduced to a precarious 44 for four before S. Badrinath (70 ..) and Tejinder Pal Singh (46) put on a 94-run partnership for the fifth wicket to stem the rot. 

However, when Tejinder departed, India were still 31 runs in arrears. Rohit Sharma (22) and Piyush Chawla (26) then stood to the task at hand, steering the team to victory. 

New Zealand As Jeetan Patel picked up three wickets. 

 India A were off to a disastrous start, losing both the openers with just 20 runs on the board. 

 Cheteshwar Pujara was run out for two and Shikhar Dhawan was trapped leg before off Jeetan for 15. More shocks were in store for the Indians as Robin Uthappa (9) and skipper Parthiv Patel (8) were also back in the pavilion soon. 

Meanwhile in another match played in the day, Shane Watson made an unbeaten 63, following his first innings score of 161 not out, as Australia A drew their four-day match against Pakistan A. 

 Australia A declared its second innings at 165 for six, setting a winning target of 245 for Pakistan A. The tourists reached 145 for four from 30 overs before stumps were drawn half an hour early.

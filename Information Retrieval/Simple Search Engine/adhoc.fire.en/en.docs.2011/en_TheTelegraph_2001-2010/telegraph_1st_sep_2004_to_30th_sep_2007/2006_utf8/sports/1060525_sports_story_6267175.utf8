 United sack Rooney doctor

London: Manchester United club doctor Mike Stone, who was overseeing England striker Wayne Rooneys recovery from a broken foot, has been sacked by the Premier League club, British media reported on Wednesday. 

Stone, who had been with United for ten years, was put in charge of Rooneys rehabilitation after the forward broke the fourth metatarsal on his right foot on April 29 . 

Rooney, who spent his first few months at United in 2004 under the care of Stone following a metatarsal injury suffered at Euro 2004, will have a scan on his latest injury on Thursday. 

We can confirm that Mike Stone has left the club, a United spokesman was quoted as saying by a British newspaper. 

The paper added that the doctor wrote to his former colleagues saying: Im leaving with immediate effect, its been a pleasure working with you all. 

Another paper said responsibility for getting Rooney fit for the World Cup would now pass to Uniteds assistant doctor, Tony Gill. 

United manager Alex Ferguson and director Bobby Charlton have already warned that Rooney will not be allowed to play at the World Cup if he is not fully fit. 

The paper quoted a United spokesman as saying: There was a difference of opinion on a non-football and non-clinical issue, as a result of which Dr Stone felt it was in the best interests of himself and the club for him to leave. 

The paper said United had insisted that Stone had left the club because of a difference over a non-clinical issue and had nothing whatsoever to do with any medical treatment to any Manchester United player. (Reuters)

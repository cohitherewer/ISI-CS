 Langer hints at quitting after Ashes

Sydney: Australia opening batsman Justin Langer says he may consider retirement after the next Ashes series against England starting in November. 

Langer, 35, suffered concussion while playing in his 100th Test in South Africa last month after being struck on the head by the first ball he received from fast bowler Makhaya Ntini. 

I have always said that the day you decide to retire, do it, Langer told an Australian newspaper on Tuesday. 

Dont announce it ahead of time because it will just lead to huge distractions. 

The gritty left-hander said he wanted the chance to win back the Ashes following Australias 2-1 series defeat in England last year. 

The last Ashes series really hurt, he said. 

I would love to leave the game knowing that we have regained the Ashes and the next Ashes team would have it in their possession. 

Langer said he had considered quitting after returning from South Africa. 

When I first came back home I thought that it was possibly time to go, he said. But I know that now isnt the right time. 

 I cant say what the future holds beyond the Ashes. 

Langer said it was the amount of time international players spent away from home that would be the decisive factor in his decision. 

We are now compensated well and looked after well, but to be frank the hardest thing for me now is the time away from home and it has become excruciatingly hard, he said. 

Langer has scored over 7,000 Test runs at an average of 45.35 since making his debut in 1993. (Reuters)

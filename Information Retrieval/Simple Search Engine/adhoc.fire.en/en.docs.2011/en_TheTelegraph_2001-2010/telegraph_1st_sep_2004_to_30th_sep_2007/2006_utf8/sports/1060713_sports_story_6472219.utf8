 Suspension off Greece 

London: Fifa has lifted its suspension of the Greek football federation after their parliament approved an amendment to its legislation. 

Fifa imposed the ban because the original sports law gave the government too much say in running Greek football issues, notably the setting up of the new Super League and the election of federation officers. 

Earlier on Wednesday the federation said it had given its approval to a revised sports bill that was passed late on Tuesday night by the Greek government. (Reuters)

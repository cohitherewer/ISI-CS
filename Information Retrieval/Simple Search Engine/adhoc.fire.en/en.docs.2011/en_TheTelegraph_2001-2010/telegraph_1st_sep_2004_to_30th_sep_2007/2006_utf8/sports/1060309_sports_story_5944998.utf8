Bogra: Led by a resurgent Muttiah Muralidharan, Sri Lanka dismissed Bangladesh for 234 runs to take charge of the second Test on Wednesday, putting themselves in position to seal a 2-0 series victory after the first days play. 

Dismissed shortly after tea, the home side was buoyed by an 11-over burst before the close that reduced Sri Lanka to 25 for two at stumps, but the star of the day was undoubtedly Muralidharan. 

Playing his 101st Test match, the 33-year-old off spinner moved to within two wickets of becoming the second bowler after Australias Shane Warne to claim 600 Test wickets when he ripped through the Bangladesh innings with figures of five for 79. It was his 50th five-wicket haul. 

Captain Habibul Bashar top-scored for the hosts with 69, while Javed Omar (35) and Mohammad Rafique (32) were the only other batsmen to get decent starts in a match Bangladesh need to win to square the two-Test series. 

Resuming after the tea interval on 188 for six, Bangladesh lost their four remaining wickets for the addition of just 46 runs as pacer Dilhara Fernando got in on the act with his first two wickets of the innings. 

The other successful bowlers were Lasith Malinga, who finished with figures of two for 73, and Malinga Bandara (1/28).

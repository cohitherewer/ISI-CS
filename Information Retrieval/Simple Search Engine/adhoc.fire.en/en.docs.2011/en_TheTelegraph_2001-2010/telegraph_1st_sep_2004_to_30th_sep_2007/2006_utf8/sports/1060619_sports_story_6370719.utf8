 Togo not cannon fodder, says Koebi Kuhn 

 - Africans bank on coach Pfisters Swiss connections

Dortmund: Switzerland embody order, discipline and planning. Togo have come to symbolise turmoil. Yet, there are more similarities than one might expect between the two teams, which face each other in a crucial World Cup match in group G on Tuesday. 

The Africans, disrupted by the pay row among the squad which led to Otto Pfister quitting as coach before returning a few days later, turned a 1-0 lead over group G rivals South Korea into a 1-2 defeat in Frankfurt on Tuesday. 

On the same day, Switzerland ground out an uninspiring 0-0 draw with former world champions France, maintaining their image as a well-organised outfit but without winning too many new fans. 

The Swiss are hoping to create more chances than they did against the French. 

I think we will find more space to attack against Togo, said coach Koebi Kuhn. We always try to play attacking football but we know ourselves we are not goal machines. 

Our strikers (Alex Frei and Marco Streller) are coming back from a difficult time with injuries and I think the longer the tournament lasts, the better it will be for them. 

Kuhn says Togo will be no pushovers. 

Anyone who thinks Togo will be cannon fodder is completely wrong, he said. 

I see them as a strong team, who qualified for the World Cup in a strong group, with two very dangerous forwards in Emmanuel Adebayor and Mohamed Kader Coubadja. 

Togo coach Pfister is well versed on Swiss football. 

The 68-year-old German is married to a Swiss, lives in Switzerland and has been a player and a coach in that country. 

I know them inside out. If everyone is fit, it should be no surprise how they play, Pfister said. I now have to work out (the tactics) of how to beat them. For Togo, this is the last chance. 

Kuhn said Pfisters Swiss connections could assist the Togolese team but added that he had also done his own homework. 

Of course its no disadvantage he lives in Switzerland and follows Swiss football but its the players who have to go out and win the match, Kuhn said. 

I think we are also well enough informed about Togolese football. 

Kuhn is likely to stick with the same team he used against France, although he could bring in attacking midfielder Daniel Gygax at the expense of the more defence-minded Raphael Wicky. 

Pfister will be forced into changes at the back with captain Jean Paul Yaovi Abalo Dosseh suspended after his dismissal against Korea and fellow defender Ludovic Assemoassa out of the tournament after tearing knee ligaments in the same game. 

Arsenals Adebayor and Coubadja, the Guincamp striker who scored against South Korea, are a speedy and often unpredictable combination in attack. 

We are not here as tourists, said Kader, one of the Swiss leagues top goalscorers when he was at Genevas Servette from 2002-2005. It will be like a final for us, given that we lost the first match.

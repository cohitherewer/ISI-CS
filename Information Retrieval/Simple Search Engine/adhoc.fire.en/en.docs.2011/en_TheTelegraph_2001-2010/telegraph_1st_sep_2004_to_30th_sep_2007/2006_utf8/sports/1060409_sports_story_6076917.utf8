Mumbai: Indias leading doubles pair Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi made mincemeat of Jalil Khan and Asim Shafik for a straight-set victory, putting India 2-1 ahead in their Davis Cup Asia-Oceania Zone Group I play off tie against Pakistan here on Saturday. 

Captain Paes and Bhupathi carried too many guns for the inexperienced Pakistani pair and gave the rivals a sound thrashing, winning the second days doubles rubber 6-2, 6-3, 6-1 in an hour and 40 minutes. 

The Indian duo, winner of multiple Grand Slam titles, broke their rivals serve twice in the opening set, in the third and fifth games, to clinch it in 28 minutes. The home team pair were even more dominating in the next set, breaking the Pakistani duo thrice, in the first, seventh and ninth games, to grab the set in 33 minutes. 

Paes, brilliant with his net interceptions as is his wont, and Bhupathi ? with excellent returns of serve ? went into overdrive in the decider and took it with the help of two service breaks (fourth and sixth), again in 33 minutes. 

The teams, meeting in Cup play after a gap of 33 years, shared the opening days two singles rubbers. 

Rohan Bopanna lost to Pakistans Aisam-ul Qureshi and Prakash Amritraj overcame Aqeel Khan. 

The reverse singles will be played on Sunday. 

The Indian pair put tremendous pressure on the Pakistanis serve from the beginning and the weakling was Jalil. 

While Paes was at his best with his drive and punch-volleys at the net, Bhupathi complemented him very well and was especially good in his returns which had the Pakistanis scampering endlessly. 

The serves of both Khan and Shafik were returned with a measure of comfort by the Indians, while the former especially found it difficult to face the Indian duos deliveries even as his partner improved as the match progressed. 

The first break for the Indians came in Khans opening service game, set up by Paes with a screaming forehand cross-court winner that bisected the two rival players and Bhupathi followed suit with a well-measured backhand lob that was returned long by Khan. 

The Indians broke again in the very next game by attacking Shafiks serve to go up 4-1 and they closed out the set when the India skipper held serve. 

Paes and Bhupathi attacked their rivals with vigour from the beginning of the second set to earn a break in the very first game. 

After deuce was called thrice on Shafiks serve, the Pakistan player volleyed wide to provide India with a break-point that was converted by Bhupathis excellent return at the servers feet. 

The Indian pair simply toyed with their rivals in the last set. 

The first break of serve for the home team came in the fourth game when Khan double-faulted at 30-all. 

Paes took advantage of the break-point with a timely interception at the net with his forehand that put India 3-1 ahead. After Bhupathi held serve, the Indians broke Shafiks serve for a commanding 5-1 lead. 

Paes then saved a breakpoint with an ace before Bhupathi came up with drop-volley to complete the rout. (PTI)

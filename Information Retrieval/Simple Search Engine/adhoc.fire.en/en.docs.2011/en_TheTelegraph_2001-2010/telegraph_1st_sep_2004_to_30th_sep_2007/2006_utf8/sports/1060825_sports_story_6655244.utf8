 Double standards alive: Akram 

London: Former captain Wasim Akram has accused the non-Asian countries of adopting double standards in defining ball-tampering and said it was unfair to label Pakistan as cheats simply because they had mastered the art of reverse swing. 

When Pakistan make the old ball swing its called ball-tampering, but when everyone else does it, its called reverse swing, Akram said. 

Double standards are still alive and well in Test cricket. Where reverse swing is concerned, I dont believe we are cheats and the rest of the world is practising an art form, he was quoted as saying by a newspaper on Thursday. 

Akram, who took 916 wickets in Tests and one-day Internationals, said he could never dream of calling Andrew Flintoff a cheat in Englands Ashes win. 

Like many neutrals, I was pleased when England won the Ashes, a result achieved partly because Flintoff and Simon Jones enjoyed reverse swing, yet nobody asked how they did it. (PTI)

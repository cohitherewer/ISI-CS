The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Singh, Bath in limelight 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: The jockey-trainer combination of D. Singh and H. S. Bath missed out the chief-event the Roll N Twist Cup on Friday but the afternoon was otherwise ruled by them. They reeled off a quadruple of wins and three of their wards paid rich dividends at the totalisator.

 Starting off with the narrow victory of Queen Amedale, in the days opener, the combo appeared to be in a great hurry. Satluj and Vancouver scored in successive events for the duo. There was, however, a lull until the last race in which the stables hot-favourite, Tactical Advantage, completed their days tally.

 The main event was an easy pick for Pure Valour, a long-shot from trainer Daniel Davids yard who was ridden to victory almost from the start. Jockey Cp. Manasseh partnered the Conquering Hero son who paid Rs 211 on an investment of Rs 10 at the totalisator.

 Umpires leave Smith, Arthur fuming...

 - Power cut leads to 40-minute stoppage; India on backfoot again; Benson lands in ICU 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Durban: South African openers Graeme Smith and AB De Villiers beat the Indians to the field when play resumed after an unusual power cut-induced break. After seven minutes, the Indians beat them to the dressing room once the umpires decided that the light had become unsuitable! 

Captain Smith, in fact, was agitated as its generally held that the light is offered to batsmen. However, the slips cordon can also lose sight of the ball. As it turned out, even the umpires (Asad Rauf and South African Ian Howell, standing in for Mark Benson who is under observation in an ICU) had a problem. 

Day III of the second Castle Test couldnt have had a more bizarre end. Actually, througout, there were unusual occurrences. Benson, for example, went off owing to palpitations. That was pretty early. 

After tea, 40 minutes were lost because there was no back-up when a power cut hit many areas, including Kingsmead. Cricket South Africa must learn from this embarrassing episode. 

Having been under pressure for the second day in a row, the Indians didnt mind any hold-up. Theyre, after all, 1-0 up and its best to keep that intact instead of heading for Cape Town with a 1-1 scoreline. 

Ahead by 88 runs on the first innings, the South Africans will take to Day IV on 64 without loss. We achieved most of our targets... One was to take a 100-run lead and the other to end 200 in front... With all the interruptions, weve got to 152, remarked coach Mickey Arthur. 

If Smith was cheesed off on the field, Arthur was as agitated when he interacted with the Media. We wanted to push forward... It has been hugely frustrating... One ball change took 20 minutes (!)... Then, there were injuries... It was stop-start cricket and there should be strong control... 

Frankly, thats an indictment of the on-field umpires and the International Cricket Council may not react too kindly. 

Arthur added: The weather is a concern, but Im happy with the execution of our plans... Weve been clinical and professional... Five wickets in the first session really set it up for us... The first hour tomorrow is going to be very crucial... We want to push on and win this Test... The wicket has been fantastic... 

Assuming the South Africans continue to dominate, they will still be wary of what happened at the SCG last year. Being down in the series, wed been forced into a declaration and lost the Test... Were going to look for a positive result here, but I accept much work remains... he pointed out. 

Interacting briefly with The Telegraph, Arthur said: I know the boys have been upset, but it will soon be a thing of the past... They arent going to lose focus and will be fine in the evening... 

Earlier, Indias first innings ended 63 minutes after lunch with vice-captain V.V.S. Laxman unbeaten on exactly 50 (282 minutes, 156 balls, 3x4). If the Sourav Ganguly-Vikram Rajvir Singh and Laxman-Zaheer Khan partnerships played a big role at the Wanderers, the one between Laxman and gutsy Sreesanth took India past 200 on Thursday. 

They added 52 for the ninth wicket, with Sreesanth being the senior partner he contributed 28, which included five boundaries. The courage apart, he showed cricket sense in often playing with soft hands. 

Sreesanths effort put some of the specialists to shame. Sourav Ganguly, for one, fell to a smart short ball from Makhaya Ntini. Having picked it up late, it took the former captain time to realise hed fallen for a duck. 

Before him, it was Sachin Tendulkars turn to depart (for 63, his first Test fifty of the year), playing an uncharacteristic shot off Ntini. Till then, hed been in absolute control and couldve become Smiths biggest headache. 

Mahendra Singh Dhoni, of course, showed character after getting the benefit on an lbw appeal from Andre Nel but became the first of three taken by debutant Morne Morkel. 

Smith, surprisingly, showed little faith in the most experienced Shaun Pollock. But, then, he almost got what the team had been aiming for a lead of 100. Conditions were overcast right through and the South African quicks bent their backs. Its an approach which fetched nice dividends. 

Day III, by the way, again saw few overs being sent down no more than 58.4. 

 Footnote: Benson, who has been admitted to 

 St Augustines Hospital, is doing well 

 according to an informal medical bulletin released late 

 in the day. Replacement Howell, incidentally, had been on 

 duty during the controversial Port Elizabeth Test on the 

 2001-02 tour by Team India. His on-field colleague was Zimbabwes 

 Russell Tiffin.

 LEAD-UP TO THE CALL-OFF

 After tea, umpires Asad Rauf and 

 Ian Howell offer the light to Graeme Smith and AB De Villiers. 

 Thats before the power failure.

 Batsmen decide to carry 

 on.

 Power failure shuts down, among other things, four 

 of the five towers with floodlights.Batsmen then decide to go off. 

 After a 40-minute break, Test resumes, but the light 

 has deteriorated.

 Seven minutes later, umpires decide the light is 

 now unfit for play. Indians walk off after the umpires have 

 finished conferring; Smith is agitated.

 Howell explains (to the Media) even the umpires 

 had problems sighting the ball and that the (slips) fielders 

 could also have had a problem.

 South African coach Mickey Arthur says it was hugely 

 frustrating.

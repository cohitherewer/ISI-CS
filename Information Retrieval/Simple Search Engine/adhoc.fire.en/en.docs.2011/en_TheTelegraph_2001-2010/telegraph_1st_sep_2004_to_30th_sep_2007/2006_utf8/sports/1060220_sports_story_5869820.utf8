 Ranji winners to vie for Nissar Trophy

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Karachi: The Ranji Trophy champions will play the winners of the Qaid-e-Azam Trophy for the Mohammed Nissar Trophy from May 4 to 8 at Dharamshala. 

BCCI president Sharad Pawar said after a meeting with PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan on Sunday that this would be an annual fixture. Next year, Pakistan will play hosts. 

It was also decided that the India under-19 team would visit Pakistan in September. The two ODIs, slated for Abu Dhabi, will be held on April 18 and 19. 

Proceeds from the first match will go the October earthquake victims in both countries, while the total amount from the second game will be shared between the two boards.

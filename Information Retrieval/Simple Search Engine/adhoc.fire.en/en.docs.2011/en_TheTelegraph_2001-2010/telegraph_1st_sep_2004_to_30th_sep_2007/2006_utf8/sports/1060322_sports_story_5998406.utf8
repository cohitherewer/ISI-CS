 ECB keeps close watch 

 MIHIR BOSE

The England authorities at Lords are monitoring the security situation at Guwahati, the venue for Englands fifth one-day International against India, after a bomb blast in the city last Saturday resulted in death and several injuries. 

The England tour party is travelling in India with guards provided by Olive Security, and the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) have always maintained that security of the players is their first concern. 

Andrew Walpole, the tour press spokesman, said: Our security advice is we are aware of the bombing and we will continue to liaise with the British High Commission if necessary. 

North-east India has endured terrorist activity for many years, and the weekend blast was the latest attributed to the United Liberation Front of Asom. 

There is much enthusiasm for the England match in Guwahati, and it has already been the subject of a huge local problem. The match date, April 9, originally clashed with local elections. However, after protests, the Election Commission on Monday announced that the election would be moved to make sure that those who wanted to go to see the one-day International would not miss out. 

Terrorist bombs could have forced the cancellation of an Ashes Test last summer. 

The Daily Telegraph has been told that the Lords game last July was nearly called off after four unexploded devices were found in Londons transport system on the opening day of the match, following the explosions two weeks earlier.

 Anand in final

Leon (Spain): An off-colour Viswanathan Anand survived a scare as he scored a come-from-behind victory against Cuban Grandmaster Lazaro Bruzon and advanced to the finals of the 19th Magistral Ciudad de Leon Chess Tournament here. 

Anand came through some anxious moments on Friday before winning the blitz tie-break game, eighth of the match, for a 4.4-3.5 victory. 

In Sundays final, Anand will meet the winner of the match between world champion Veselin Topalov of Bulgaria and Francisco Vallejo Pons of Spain. 

It turned out to be a taxing outing for Anand against Lazaro in the clash of former junior world champions. 

Earlier in the Chess Olympiad too, these two had crossed swords and the result there was a stalemate that continued here for the first four rapid games. 

It was a surprising result as Anand is highly regarded as the best rapid chess player on the planet. The matches here are played with 20 minutes to each player with a 10-second increment after every move is played.

 Seeding does not count for much: Sania

Melbourne: Sania Mirza sought to play down her being seeded for the first time at a Grand Slam on Friday, saying it would only make her a target for rivals. 

The 19-year old, ranked 34 in the world, has been seeded 32nd in singles main draw of the Australian Open where she is set to take on a qualifier in the first round. 

Sania said seedings would not matter once the match began, just as she showed the tennis world with her meteoric rise last season. 

Yes, it is a great honour. But the seeding does not count for much once you are out there on court, the Hyderabadi said. 

And I know there will be a lot more players gunning for me, firing on all cylinders, now that I am seeded, said Sania, who reached the third round in Melbourne last season. 

Sanias first-round opponent will be decided on Saturday. The Indian said any qualifier would have the momentum going with her.

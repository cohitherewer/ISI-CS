Calcutta: Getting the coveted Grandmaster title has not made Neelotpal Das bumptious. He remains the soft-spoken, restrained, bashful youngster who very is reluctant to speak of his achievements. 

Not uncharacteristically, he slipped unnoticed into the city in the wee hours of Tuesday without informing anyone of his arrival plans. 

Later in the day, The Telegraph caught up with Indias latest GM at an internet cafe. Neelotpal, who turns 24 on Thursday, was busy following the final round of the National A Championship where fellow-GMs Surya Sekhar Ganguly and Sandipan Chanda were fighting to retain their places in the Indian Olympiad team. Surya won the title for the third consecutive time and Sandipan emerged runner-up, also for the third time on the trot. 

Asked how it felt becoming a GM, Neelotpal said: I dont think getting the GM title is a big deal. I believe it is essential to go on improving and I still have a long way to go. Of course, I have striven hard to get the title, having missed norms by a whisker in a number of tournaments. 

Though Neelotpal had got the IM title before Surya and Sandipan, the duo had beaten him to the big one. I never considered Surya and Sandipan as my competitors. I compete against myself, trying to erase my flaws and improve further. So there was no question of any disappointment, he said. 

 Neelotpals first major headlines was when he got the IM title in 1999 in Bangladesh where he scalped world title challenger Nigel Short. His fathers death in 2001, though, left him shattered. I went through a bad phase then. Then I joined ONGC and my life changed, said Neelotpal. 

Before getting the GM norm in San Sebastian, he had beaten GM Vadim Milov in Dos Hermanas against whom he had got a walkover in the first round of the 2004 world championship in Libya. It was very satisfying beating him as there was a feeling that I was lucky to get a walkover against him, he said. 

He idolises no one in particular. I try to follow all the top players and try to learn from them, but then I like Alekhines classical style and his feeling for the initiative. The way he despatched his opponents neatly is inspiring. Of the present day players, I like Ivanchuk, said Neelotpal. 

Did he meet Viswanathan Anand in Spain? Not this time. During my previous visit, Anand had invited me for lunch and I had a wonderful time. And what did they talk about, the Sicilian Najdorf? We talked about everything from Hindi cinema to football, but not chess. We still keep in touch through the Net, Neelotpal informed. 

Neelotpal will be playing rating tournaments in Mumbai and Goa, before going on a tour of Spain in July. 

On his next target, Neelotpal said: I take life as it comes and believe in climbing one step at a time. I want to improve my rating and then set new goals.

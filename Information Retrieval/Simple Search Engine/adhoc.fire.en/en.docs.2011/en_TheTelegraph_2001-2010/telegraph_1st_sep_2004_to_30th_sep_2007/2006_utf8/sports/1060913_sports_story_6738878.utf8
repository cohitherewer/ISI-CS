 Australia in semi-finals

Moenchengladbach: Olympic champions Australia became the first team to enter the semi-finals of the 11th FIH World Cup as they romped to a 7-1 win against traditional rivals New Zealand here on Tuesday. 

The result took Australias tally to nine points and will play Pakistan (five points) in their concluding league fixture on Wednesday. 

The Aussies are currently at the top of pool A ahead of Spain who have eight points with two matches to go while New Zealand completed their league engagements with seven. 

Australia put on an awesome exhibition of their firepower with Jamie Dwyer (2nd, 64th), Michael McCann (26th), Troy Elder (32nd), Matthew Naylor (48th), Travis Brooks (56th) and Luke Doerner (66th) doing the scoring. 

The only respite that New Zealand had was in the opening 20 minutes when the Aussies after scoring early, relaxed and the New Zealanders slotted in their only goal. Mitesh Patel picked a rebound off goalkeeper Stephen Mowlam who had blocked a Hayden Shaw penalty corner attempt in the 21st minute. 

Thereafter, the Aussies took command and ruthlessly cut open their opponents. It was as perfect a game that any team could play. (PTI)

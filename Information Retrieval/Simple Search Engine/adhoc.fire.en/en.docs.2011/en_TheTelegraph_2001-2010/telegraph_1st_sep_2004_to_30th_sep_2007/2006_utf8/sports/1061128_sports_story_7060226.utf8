 Brazilian dies of heart attack 

Rio de Janeiro: A professional soccer player died of a heart attack during a friendly game in Sao Paulo state, sporting media reported on Monday. 

Alex Sandro de Souza Pereira, 29, who played this year for Matonense of Sao Paulos fourth division, collapsed during a friendly between amateur teams on Sunday in the city of Avare, about 600kms west of Rio, the Estado de S. Paulo website reported. 

His teammates tried to revive him. Pereira was taken to a local hospital, where he died, the site said. 

In 2004, Sao Caetano defender Serginho collapsed and died on the field at Morumbi Stadium during a first-division game with Sao Paulo. A year earlier, defender Max of Botafogo dropped dead during a practice session. 

Heart problems also forced Goias striker Gabricio Carvalho to take a leave of absence for two years, but doctors say that with reconditioning he can return to activity next year.

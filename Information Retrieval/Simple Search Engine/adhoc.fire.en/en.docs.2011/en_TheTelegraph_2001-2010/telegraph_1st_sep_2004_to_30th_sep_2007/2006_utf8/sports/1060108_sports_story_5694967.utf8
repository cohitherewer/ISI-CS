The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 No partying, only namaaz for Shoaib

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Lahore: Shoaib Akhtar isnt just a changed bowler, he appears to be different off the field as well. Im not giving interviews... Im not partying either... Khali namaaz padta hoon, he told The Telegraph after a full-fledged workout at the Academy on Saturday. 

Chatting as he headed towards his silver Toyota Hilux Surf, Shoaib remarked: I did have a good comeback (against England), but the credit goes to Allah... Its Allah who helped me get those (17) wickets in the three Tests... 

Asked whether that performance had increased the expectations-driven pressure, Shoaib replied: Ab aap to interview karne lage... Well talk later... Abhi to series start hone ko hai... 

Perhaps, speaking less is the spearheads way of focussing.

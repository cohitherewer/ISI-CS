 My conscience clear: Materazzi

 Materazzi

Rome: Marco Materazzi, suspended for provoking Zinedine Zidanes head-butt in the World Cup final, has said in his first comments since Fifas ban that he is a little bitter but has a clear conscience. 

Italian media and football officials reacted to the two-match ban with indigation, saying that his punishment was almost on a par with that of Zidane, who was given a three-match ban though he has retired anyway. 

Materazzi, commenting for the first time since the verdict said in an Italian paper: Im a little bitter but I can hold my head up high. 

A lot of people have judged me. I have made errors in my life, but not always. I can look myself in the mirror and the important thing is to have a clear conscience. 

Italian sports minister Giovanna Melandri summed up the general feeling in the country by criticising Fridays decision, saying Fifa were showing a prejudiced attitude towards Italy. 

Materazzi will miss Italys Euro 2008 qualifying matches against Lithuania on September 2 and a match against France on September 6. 

Zidane was sent off, after provocation by Materazzi, near the end of extra-time in the World Cup final, which Italy eventually won on penalties, following a 1-1 draw in Berlin on July 9.

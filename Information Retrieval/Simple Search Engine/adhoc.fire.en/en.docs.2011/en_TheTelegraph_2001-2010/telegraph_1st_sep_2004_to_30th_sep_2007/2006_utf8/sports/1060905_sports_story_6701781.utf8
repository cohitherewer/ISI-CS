 FACTBOX 

 Won his first title as a wildcard 

 in Itaparica in 1987. A year later, he won six titles from 

 seven finals and reached both the French and US Open semi-finals. 

 In 1992, he won his first Grand Slam at Wimbledon, 

 defeating Goran Ivanisevic in five sets, and led the US 

 to the Davis Cup title. 

 Ranked world number one for the 

 first time in April 1995, the same year that he won a career-high 

 seven titles in a season, including first Australian Open 

 crown. 

 Took Olympic gold at the 1996 

 Atlanta Games. 

 Agassi ended 1999 as the world 

 No.1, winning the French and US Open Grand Slams after falling 

 at one stage to 141st. He also became the fifth man along 

 with Don Budge, Rod Laver, Fred Perry and Roy Emerson 

 to win all four Grand Slam titles. 

 In 2001, he married former womens 

 world No.1 Steffi Graf in October, days before the birth 

 of their son Jaden Gil. 

 Agassi became the first overseas 

 player to win four mens singles titles at the Australian 

 Open after defeating Schuettler in 2003. The same year, 

 he played his 1,000th professional match at the Stella Artois 

 Championships, while his daughter Jaz Elle was born in October. 

 Agassi announced in June 2006 

 that he would retire after the US Open. After pulling off 

 another miraculous victory in beating eighth seed Marcos 

 Baghdatis in five epic sets, Agassi finally said farewell 

 after losing in four sets to German Benjamin Becker in the 

 third round of the US Open.

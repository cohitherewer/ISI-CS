 Federer in quarters

Rome: Roger Federer cruised into the quarter finals of the Rome Masters on Thursday with a 6-1, 6-4 victory over Radek Stepanek. 

The world No. 1 was barely stretched as a succession of unforced errors by the 14th seed allowed him to zip through the first set in 22 minutes. Stepanek steadied himself in the second but never looked likely to make it a contest after he dropped serve in the third game. 

 Paes-Stepanek out 

Leander Paes and Czech partner Stepanek bowed out in the second round to American twins Bob and Mike Bryan. 

The top seeds beat the Indo-Czech pair 6-1, 7-5.

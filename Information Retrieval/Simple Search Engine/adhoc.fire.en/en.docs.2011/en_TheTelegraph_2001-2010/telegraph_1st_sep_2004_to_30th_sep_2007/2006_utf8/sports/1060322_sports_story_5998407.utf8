 James Kirtley cleared

London: Former England paceman James Kirtley has been cleared to resume bowling after a reassessment of his action, the England and Wales Cricket Board said on Tuesday. 

The Sussex player was banned from bowling in October after his action was reported by umpires in two county matches during the 2005 season. 

James has clearly worked hard and effectively during the winter with Mark Robinson, professional cricket manager at Sussex, to remodel his action, ECB umpires and match operations manager, Chris Kelly, said in a statement. 

When he was re-tested recently at Loughborough the level of elbow extension in James action had reduced considerably and ... the test results now fall within the prescribed tolerance levels.

 Amazing Agassi defies age and pain to outlast Baghdatis

 - Federer brushes aside Henman 

 - Hingis stunned by Razzano 

 Federer in New York on Friday 

New York: Andre Agassi, 36 years old and burdened by a bad back, extended his career for at least one more match by winning a thriller over eighth-seeded Marcos Baghdatis of Cyprus 6-4, 6-4, 3-6, 5-7, 7-5 at the US Open. 

Agassi, buoyed by a cortisone injection and the raucous, sell-out crowd, traded stinging strokes for nearly four hours as Thursday night became Friday. 

In the end it was the 21-year-old Baghdatis who broke down physically, his body contorted by cramps in both thighs during an eight-deuce, four-break-point game that Agassi eventually held to lead 5-4 in the fifth set. Later, Baghdatis used the chair umpires stand to stretch his aching legs. Agassi was still hustling to reach seemingly unreachable shots, responding with winners, and skipping out to the baseline to start games at his record 21st consecutive Open one for each year of Baghdatis life. 

In most cases, I prefer to live without the drama, Agassi kidded later. It just seems like its getting better and better. When it was over, they shook hands at the net, then embraced. And Agassi was quick to thank the 23,700 or so fans who enjoyed quite a ride at Flushing Meadows. Tonight has been another example of moments youre not guaranteed in life, Agassi said. 

Baghdatis reached across the net and tapped Agassi on the heart as they walked off to a roaring, standing ovation. 

Among women, eighth-seeded Martina Hingis fell to Frenchwoman Virginie Razzano. Hingis, the five-time Grand Slam champion back on tour after a three-year retirement, was upset 6-2, 6-4 by 112th-ranked Razzano. 

Hingis came into the day with a 44-14 mark this season, with none of the losses to anyone ranked lower than 23rd. Ten of her setbacks came against women whove won major championships. Maria Sharapova and former Open champions Lindsay Davenport, Belgiums Justine Henin-Hardenne and Svetlana Kuznetsova of Russia all breezed through. 

 Top-seeded Amelie Mauresmo of France and Serena Williams also advanced. Mauresmo beat Meghann Shaughnessy of the US 6-4, 6-3, while wild card Serena Williams got past No. 17 Daniela Hantuchova of Slovakia, 7-5, 6-3. Number three seed Sharapova swept past Emilie Loit of France 6-0, 6-1, while Davenport, the 10th seed, blew away Croatian Jelena Kostanic 6-0, 6-0. Number 6 Kuznetsova beat Lauren Albanese of the US 6-1, 6-1 and No. 2 Henin-Hardenne got the better of Vania King 6-1, 6-2. 

There werent many tough tests in the mens draw, although No. 27-seeded Gael Monfils lost to Wesley Moodie, and two-time French Open champion Rafael Nadal dropped a set before getting past Luis Horna (as reported in Fridays Late City edition). 

Baghdatis very first serve of the second-round encounter was a fault, eliciting hoots from the stands. Moments later, a fan in the upper deck yelled: Andre, this is your house! And its all of us against him! As if there were any doubt. Agassi is, after all, an American at the American Grand Slam, one of the most popular players in recent tennis history and everyone knows each match here could be his last as a pro. 

Against Baghdatis, Agassi missed consecutive backhands to get broken in the fifth sets opening game. Agassi wiped sweat from his brow, shook his head and trudged slowly toward the sideline. Was the end near? But with the lead and momentum finally on Baghdatis side, it was youngster who asked for a medical timeout so he could get his strained left thigh massaged. 

Twice defending champion Roger Federer served his way into the third round with a 6-3, 6-4, 7-5 victory over Tim Henman on Friday. Top-seeded Federer fired only six aces and had his serve broken once but proved to be in a different league to Henman. (Agencies)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Crucial to get Pietersen, Flintoff early

 - Dravid endorses Dhonis views on fan support 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Faridabad: Rahul Dravid on Thursday endorsed the views of Mahendra Singh Dhoni that Indian fans should support the team more during difficult times. 

At the same time, the Indian captain made it clear that he doesnt expect things to change in near future. 

Asked to react on Dhonis remarks that the wicketkeeper was disappointed with the way fans booed at some places, Dravid said: They are youngsters and must have really felt bad before saying it. 

In India, the nature of cricket fans is like that. They get excited when the team wins, and feel dejected after every loss. I tell the youngsters not to feel disappointed. But, then, we certainly need support when the team passes through difficult conditions. 

Dravid admitted that the batsmen did not do well in the last one-dayer at Kotla. 

But that happened only a couple of times in the last four or five months. There is no need to hit the panic button immediately. 

I think we got a bit carried away, thinking it was worth 280-300 in the last game. If we had set a target of 230-240, it would have been good. Of course we played well to defend 203. 

The Indian captain said he did not feel concerned about Indias below par showing in the first one-dayer. The word concern is a strong statement. I dont buy that. Yes, I know there are areas where we should improve. 

Dravid made it clear that his main ploy would be to see the backs of Pietersen and Flintoff as soon as possible, as the two have the ability to take the match away. 

Flintoff and Pietersen have the power and strength to bat the way they do. It will be important to get them early. 

They have not only dominated our attack, but they also can be devastating against any bowling on their day. 

We have to accept and respect that. We have to keep trying different things and find a way to check them. In one-day cricket, there will be times when you go around the park a little bit. 

On Sehwags form, Dravid said there was nothing to be really concerned about. 

We have full faith in openers. They are proven performers. We might do a few things differently during the course of the tournament, he said.

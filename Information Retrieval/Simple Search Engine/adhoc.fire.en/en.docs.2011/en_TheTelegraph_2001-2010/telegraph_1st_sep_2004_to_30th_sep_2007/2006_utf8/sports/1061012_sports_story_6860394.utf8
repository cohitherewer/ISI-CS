 PCB should cancel contracts of indisciplined players: Miandad

 Javed Miandad 

Karachi: Former captain and coach Javed Miandad wants Pakistan Cricket Board to cancel the central contracts of those players who have been guilty of indiscipline and fetched a bad name to the country. 

Referring to recent incidents like The Oval Test fiasco, Younis Khans flip-flop on captaincy and players complaints about their positions in batting order, Miandad said it was obvious the players did not deserve the central contracts. 

The central contracts appear to have no meaning for the players. In other countries such contracts bind a player to the discipline and Code of Conduct of the board concerned in return for a monthly salary besides match fees, he said Wednesday. 

The PCB has awarded contracts to around 20 players with those in the top grade getting a monthly salary of Rs 250,000. 

Now it transpires that Inzamam-ul Haq refused to listen to advice from our board officials to carry on play in The Oval Test. Then Younis Khan decides all of a sudden to relinquish the captaincy. These incidents show the discipline needs to be improved in the team, Miandad said. Nowhere else can players do such things and get away with it, he added. 

Zaheer Abbas, Pakistan team manager in England, confirmed that he himself, then PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan, and other board officials had tried to convince Inzamam to carry on the playing in The Oval Test but he refused to listen to them. 

Younis last week resigned from the captaincy for the Champions Trophy saying he did not want to be a dummy captain. He was reinstated two days later by the new PCB chairman Dr Nasim Ashraf. 

When such things happen in a cricket set-up the discipline is bound to suffer. The powers of players need to be curtailed. The board must give full authority to the manager to control things, Miandad said. 

The veteran of 122-Tests, who coached the national team on three occasions, also pointed out to allrounder Shahid Afridi telling reporters in Delhi that team management should inform him at least a day in advance which position they planned to play him at.

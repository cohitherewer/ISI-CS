 Tharangas century ensures 37-run win

Mohali: Upul Tharanga cracked a fluent century to find his way into the record books as Sri Lanka launched their ICC Champions Trophy campaign with a 37-run victory over Bangladesh in a qualifying match here on Saturday. 

The young Tharanga gave ample proof of his class with a 129-ball 105 to steer Sri Lanka to an imposing 302 for eight before the bowlers contained Bangladesh to 265 for nine in the floodlit game. 

The 21-year-old left hander, whose family home in Ambalagoda was washed away in the 2004 tsunami, not only notched up his fifth century but also created a commendable record by becoming the first batsman in ODI history to score five centuries in his first 30 appearances. 

Faced with an uphill task of scoring at over six runs per over, the Bangladeshi batsmen played some cheeky shots now and then but lacked the firepower. 

Saqibul Hasan (67 not out) hit his maiden unbeaten half century while Aftab Ahmed (33) and Farhad Reza (34) were the other notable contributors. All three batsmen unleashed some audacious strokes to provide the thrills in an otherwise boring run chase. 

Bangladesh at least proved that they could not be treated as complete pushovers as they hung on resolutely despite the run-rate climbing well beyond their reach. 

It was their highest total against Sri Lanka, eclipsing the previous best of 231 for nine in Chittagong on February 25 this year. 

The islanders could have mustered an even bigger total as Sanath Jayasuriya (31), captain Mahela Jayawardene (35), Kumar Sangakkara (22) and Maravan Atapattu (40) got the starts but could not capitalise on them. 

Put into bat, Sri Lankan openers Tharanga and Jayasuriya provided a decent start as they played the initial overs cautiously before launching a flurry of strokes. 

The opening pair put on 67 runs before Rasel provided the breakthrough by getting rid of the dangerous Jayasuriya for 31. 

The presence of captain Jayawardene in the middle saw a rapid acceleration in the scoring pace as the right-hander showed he was in fine nick. 

Jayawardene singled out paceman Farhad Reza for special treatment as he clobbered him for three fours and a huge six in one over to take the Lankan total beyond the 100-mark by the 17th over. 

Tharanga seemed to be in no discomfort at the other end and during the course of his controlled innings, as he completed 1000 ODI runs in his 30th match. 

It was the second fastest compilation of 1000 ODI runs by a Sri Lankan after Roy Dias, who achieved the feat in 27 matches. 

Kumar Sangakkara, who joined the action after his captains dismissal, also put on some quick runs with a 23-ball 22 but could not capitalise on the start. 

Former captain Maravan Atapattu, returning to international cricket after an injury lay-off, got into the groove straightaway and hit a quick-fire 42-ball 40.

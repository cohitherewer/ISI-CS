 Relaxed Jeev eyes treble

 - MASTERS OF ASIA 

 Jeev Milkha Singh 

Bangkok: Jeev Milkha Singh is not resting on his laurels. The Indian ace, who has won four titles this year, is ready for one more at the Volvo Masters of Asia starting Thursday at the Thai Country Club. 

Jeev, the hottest player in the world currently, tees off in search of a unique treble of Volvo victories and season-ending championships on three different world tours. 

He leads an elite field in the Asian Tours $650,000 season-finale at the spectacular Thai Country Club and will be shooting for a fifth title in what has been a magical season for the Indian ace. 

A relaxed Jeev said, My year has been great for India. At least when India lose (in cricket) they can say Jeev has made up for things. Cricket is religion in my country so golf making the front page with it is pretty big. 

After a seven-year title drought, the Indian lifted the Volvo China Open title in April and the triumph sparked a stunning run of form which included victories in the prestigious Volvo Masters in Spain, Golf Nippon Series Jt Cup, both season-ending events in Europe and Japan, as well as the Casio World Open in Japan. Jeevs brilliance has also brought golf to the front pages and displaced a lot of other sports. 

I have always enjoyed playing the tour championship here at Thai Country Club. The way the year has gone the Volvo tournaments have been very lucky for me and I am looking forward to this week. Volvo have done a great job in supporting golf worldwide. 

If Jeev wins the Volvo Masters of Asia, which is the tour championship of Asia, he will become the first play to win both tour championships in the same year. Also his feat of winning events on three international tours in the same year is unique

 Jones linked to fraud ring

Norfolk (Virginia): The US athletics star Marion Jones has been linked to a five million-dollar cheque-counterfeiting ring, having received a $25,000 cheque from a defendant, a Virginia-based newspaper reported. 

Citing court records, the newspaper reported that Jones, in the middle of a comeback following a disappointing Olympic-year flop in 2004, deposited the cheque into her bank account last year. 

While Jones has not been charged, other people, who received cheques from the account of the same Norfolk businessman, have been indicted and one of them pleaded guilty, the newspaper reported. 

Among 12 people indicted in the New York-based case were her former-boyfriend, disgraced former 100m world record-holder Tim Montgomery and her track coach, Steve Riddick.

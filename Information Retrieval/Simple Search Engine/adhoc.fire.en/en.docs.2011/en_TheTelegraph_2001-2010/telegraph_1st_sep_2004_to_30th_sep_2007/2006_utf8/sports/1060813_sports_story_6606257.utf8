Calcutta: A 22-member squad for the AFC Asian Cup qualifier against Saudi Arabia was announced by the team management after the days workout at the SAI on Saturday. 

Five footballers Jo Paul Ancheri, Syed Rahim Nabi, Tarif Ahmed, Abdul Bashir and Madhab Das were released from the 27-strong probables camp. We had to make a choice, but those who have been left out should not be disheartened as they may be called to the squad anytime after this match, manager Pradeep Chowdhury, who also happens to be a technical committee member of the All India Football Federation (AIFF), said. 

Among the 22 shortlisted, 20 players will be registered. We cannot register all the 22 as the rule is to have a squad of 20 ready before the match, Chowdhury said. 

Jo Paul Ancheri, who was the senior-most footballer among the probables, may again get a call once he attains full fitness. I can tell you clearly that he has no injury problem, but he needs to regain full fitness and he will again be a part of Bob Houghtons scheme of things after this match, an official revealed. 

The most surprising of the exclusions is Nabi, who had been considered as one of the best in the country by none other than Bhaichung Bhutia a few days back. 

The coach, perhaps, doesnt want to break the combination that played in Vancouver and so he (Nabi) has been left out. He will surely be a part of Houghtons long-term plan, another official said. 

Meanwhile, star striker Bhaichung Bhutia is tipped to don the skippers mantle. It has been learnt that Shanmugam Venkatesh has conveyed that he has no problems in playing under Bhaichungs leadership. 

The 22 selected players will take a day off on Sunday and watch Saudi Arabias World Cup encounter with Spain to get a hint of the strengths and weaknesses of the Saudis.

 India move up to fourth spot

 - One-day international Rankings 

 Dubai: Team India leapfrogged New Zealand into fourth place in the annual update of the International Cricket Council (ICC) ODI championship table. 

Rahul Dravids team, who have gained one place, now find themselves just two points behind third-placed Pakistan. New Zealand are a further two points behind. 

India moved up by virtue of strong performances over the past year, including series wins against Sri Lanka, Pakistan and England and a drawn series against South Africa. 

They, however, lost 1-4 to the West Indies in their recent tour of the Caribbean. 

 World champion Australias lead over second-placed South Africa has been cut to eight rating points. The gap was 13 points last year. 

The annual update, which includes results from matches played after August 1, 2003, is carried out to ensure the championship table continues to reflect recent form with older results being discarded. 

The Proteas improved rating is down to a turnaround in fortunes in the past 18 months. 

In January last year, they were languishing in seventh place, but have since enjoyed a strong run of form culminating in a 3-2 series win over Australia. 

The rankings of most of the other teams are largely unchanged by the update. 

Bangladeshs gradual improvement is reflected by their gaining eight rating points and they now trail Zimbabwe by only two. The south Asian team can overtake the African side during the upcoming five-match series starting July 29. 

TEAM STANDINGS 

1. Australia; 2. South Africa; 3. Pakistan; 4. India; 5. New Zealand; 6. Sri Lanka; 7. West Indies; 8. England; 9. Zimbabwe; 10. Bangladesh; 11. Kenya.

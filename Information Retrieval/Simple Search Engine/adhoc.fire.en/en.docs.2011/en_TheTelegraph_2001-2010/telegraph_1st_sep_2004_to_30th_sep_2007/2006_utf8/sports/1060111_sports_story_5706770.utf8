 A monks life for Srichaphan

Sydney: While most of the worlds top tennis players usually spend their off-season skiing in Europe or sunning themselves in Florida, Thailands Paradorn Srichaphan chose to become a monk. 

The devout Buddhist shaved his head, dressed in monks robes and rode an elephant through the streets during a week in the Thung Sethi Temple in Bangkok. 

He adopted the name Mahaviro, which means great and brave, was allowed two meals a day and spent most of his time meditating. 

It was a far cry from the life Asias top ranked male player is used to living. 

Paradorn is idolised in Thailand and is already wealthy but said the week in the modest surrounds of the temple meant more to him than anything else. 

It was a really calm, quiet week, he said after beating Radek Stepanek 6-3, 6-4 at the Sydney International on Tuesday. I left everything behind, walked into the temple and became a monk. I feel good that Ive done that. 

All Thai men are required to spend at least one week of their life as a monk but Paradorn said that was not the only reason he chose to do it. 

I was looking forward to it, its part of our culture, our religion, the 26-year-old said. 

You do it to respect your parents. All my brothers have done it. Its not that hard to do. Its just like youre doing something different from normal people, the way you talk, the way you act, the way you walk. You have to do everything calmly. 

Paradorns on-court behaviour has always been exemplary. There are no wild fist-pumps or foul language when his opponents make a mistake, just a polite bow at the end of each match, win or lose. 

But he said his week in the temple had made him an even calmer person, teaching him to control his emotions on the court.

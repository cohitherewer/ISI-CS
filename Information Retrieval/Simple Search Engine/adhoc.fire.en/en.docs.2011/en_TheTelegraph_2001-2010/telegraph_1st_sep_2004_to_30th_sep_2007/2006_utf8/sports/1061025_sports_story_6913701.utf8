Ahmedabad: The lingering doubts about Graeme Smiths leadership qualities were put to rest at the Motera on Tuesday as the South Africans were handed a lifeline in the Champions Trophy. Their 78-run victory has thrown group B open with all four teams tied on two points each. 

Though Sri Lanka finished their engagements, they still have a slim chance of advancing if Pakistan win all their matches. The rest will then have one win each, leaving the net run rate to decide the second semi-finalist. The Lankans net run-rate stands at a lowly 0.195. 

The South Africans truly looked to be the No. 2 side in the ODI rankings. They made up for their early batting blues with some exhilarating middle and lower-order resistance, inspired bowling and athletic fielding. Sri Lanka were done in by the Proteas aggression on the field. 

A little before the start Barry Richards rued the lack of a quality spinner in their ranks. Little did he realise then that the pace quartet would work up amazing pace and seam movement on this slowish wicket to make things look so easy in the end. 

The Lankans failed to take advantage of winning the toss and the excessive dew the South African bowlers had to confront. There batsmen were found wanting in application and determination. Sanath Jayasuriya, though, was unlucky to have been ruled leg before after the ball seemed to have pitched outside the leg-stump. 

Makhaya Ntini and Shaun Pollock showed the way with a disciplined line and the rest just carried on the good work. Some moments, though, will stand out Maravan Atapattu misjudging an incoming delivery from Andre Nel, Herschelle Gibbs acrobatic effort to dismiss Tillekeratne Dilshan and his another stop at gully that finally resulted in the well-set Mahela Jayawardenes run out. 

If the South Africans had bargained for a Muttiah Muralidharan offensive and were well prepared, Chaminda Vaas and Lasith Malinga had them by surprise at the outset. The early jitters left them clueless for a while until a middle-order damage-control act by Jacques Kallis and AB de Villiers put them on the road to recovery. 

It was only a late blitz from Pollock and Robin Peterson 32 runs coming off the last two overs that helped them set Lanka a 220-run target. The islanders were impressive with their positive attitude and intelligent field placements. 

It would be unwise to suggest that there was some demon on the wicket. The batsmen perished mainly because of poor shot selection. To put it very mildly, the South Africans hardly showed the zeal to survive. Even batsmen like De Villiers and Mark Boucher fell to rash strokes after having done all the good work. 

Malinga may have returned the most successful bowler (4/53), but it was Vaas who put the skids on the batsmen. The veteran may have lost some of his pace, but when it comes to discipline and attitude, he has always proved his mettle. His experience and big match temperament also showed on the occasion. 

Having dismissed Smith to a well laid out plan, Vaas forced Gibbs to steer to the wicketkeeper. This was the 13th occasion he had accounted for Gibbs in international cricket. The unbroken spell (10-3-16-2) will go down as one of Vaas best. 

As Kallis and De Villiers put on 80 runs for the fourth wicket, it seemed the crisis was over. But the Lankans came back strongly with great enthusiasm. The boundaries were hard to come by, and once the pressure started to tell on the batsmen, they committed hara-kiri. 

That the Proteas had worked on blunting Muralis guile was evident in the return of De Villiers replacing Andrew Hall. He had handled the off-spinner with aplomb during their recent tour to Sri Lanka and they wanted to make most of his experience. 

De Villiers (54 off 88 balls, 3x4) did not disappoint, using his feet to milk the spinners dry. Kallis was workmanlike, a spectacularly pulled six off Dilhara Fernando standing out. 

Had Peterson and Pollock not decided to spoil the Lankan party, the challenging total would never have been achieved. In hindsight, those runs may not have proved decisive, but it certainly gave the south Africans the confidence that showed in their display on the field.

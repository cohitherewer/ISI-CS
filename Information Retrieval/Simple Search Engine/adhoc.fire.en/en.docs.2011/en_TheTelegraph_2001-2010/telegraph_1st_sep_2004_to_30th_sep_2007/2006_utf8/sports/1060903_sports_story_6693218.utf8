New York: Twice defending champion Roger Federer and 2003 winner Justine Henin-Hardenne followed different paths to advance at the US Open on Friday before rain washed out the evening session at the seasons last Grand Slam. 

 Rain delayed the start of play on Saturday. Andre 

 Agassi will take centrestage seeking to postpone his retirement 

 one more time. The 36-year-old takes on German qualifier 

 Benjamin Becker in the third round. 

American Lindsay Davenports match against Slovenias Katarina Srebotnik, and fourth-seeded David Nalbandians game against unseeded 2000 Open winner Marat Safin were rained off. 

Top seed Federer was not at his best on a windy, chilly day at Flushing Meadow but still managed to ease past Briton Tim Henman 6-3, 6-4, 7-5 in a workmanlike second-round match. 

Henin-Hardenne, however, needed to recover from a disastrous first set to defeat Japanese 28th seed Ai Sugiyama 4-6, 6-1, 6-0 before moving on to the fourth round. 

Among Fridays winners were 2004 champion Svetlana Kuznetsova and runner-up that year Elena Dementieva, while on the mens side fifth seed James Blake, Nikolay Davydenko (7), Fernando Gonzalez (10), Tommy Haas (14) and Andy Murray (17) advanced. 

Top-seed Federer registered only six aces and never seemed to be firing on all cylinders but still proved to be in a different league than the 31-year-old Henman. 

I think the conditions were tough today, breezy, chilly, said Federer, who has yet to lose a set in his two matches. Henman was trying to kind of break the rhythm, as usual. 

So it makes it hard to really play well and get the good rhythm going. I think it could have been easier but I thought it was a solid match because I didnt give him any chances on my own service games and thats what I wanted to do from the start. 

Federer next meets 84th-ranked American Vince Spadea, who eliminated 29th seed Jonas Bjorkman of Sweden in straight sets. 

Blake posted his second successive straight-sets win at the Open, advancing past Russian Teimuraz Gabashvili 6-3, 6-4, 7-6. 

I was real proud of the way I served. That got me out of trouble, especially in this wind, said Blake,. The American also registered a striking homage to Andre Agassi, wearing a reproduction of a vintage hot-pink Agassi outfit circa 1990, and blowing kisses and bowing to the crowd in signature Agassi style at the end of his match. 

Henin-Hardenne committed an uncharacteristic 17 unforced errors in the first set and squandered a 4-1 lead as Sugiyama broke her serve three times. 

But the Belgian found her form in the final two sets to subdue the 31-year-old Japanese without much of a fight. 

Russian Kuznetsova rolled on to the fourth round with a 59-minute 6-3, 6-0 whipping of compatriot Anastassia Rodionova. 

Next up for the 21-year-old will be 19th seed Jelena Jankovic, who upset ninth seed Nicole Vaidisova 5-7, 6-3, 6-2. 

Dementieva advanced past fellow-Russian Vera Zvonareva 7-5, 6-3 to set up a meeting with unseeded Aravane Rezai of France, who ousted 20th-seeded Russian Maria Kirilenko 6-3, 6-1. 

Meanwhile, Leander Paes and his Australian partner Samantha Stosur were upset in the first-round of the mixed doubles event by the unseeded Belarussian duo of Max Mirnyi and Victoria Azarenka. Third seeded Paes and Stosur squandered a first set advantage to go down 6-3, 2-6, 5-10 to their unfancied rivals. 

Paes started off well to race away with the opening set but were caught napping by Mirnyi and Azarenka in the second. With the game stretching into the tie-breaker, Paes and Stosur made a valiant effort to stage a comeback but in vain. 

Paes had looked in much better touch in the doubles, where he is partnering Czech Martin Damm, carving out an easy 6-1, 6-2 first-round victory over Petr Pala and Robin Vik of the Czech Republic. 

 The other Indian veteran Mahesh Bhupathi has already 

 crashed out of both the mens doubles and mixed doubles 

 events. (Agencies)

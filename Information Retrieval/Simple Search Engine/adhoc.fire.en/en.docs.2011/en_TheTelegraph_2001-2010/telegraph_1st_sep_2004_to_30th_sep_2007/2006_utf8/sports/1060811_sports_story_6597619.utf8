 Chance to better our Lanka record: Dravid

 - TRI-SERIES 

 - WI Experience will come in handy, says Chappell 

 Rahul Dravid

Bangalore: Hours before embarking on a brief tour of Sri Lanka, Team India captain Rahul Dravid on Thursday sent out an ominous signal to his tri-series rivals, saying his young team was better prepared to reverse its dismal record in the Emerald Islands. 

Dravid said his teammates had worked hard on some of the problem areas, which should stand them in good stead for the series beginning on Monday. 

Its a great opportunity for us to go to a place where we have not done well. We have worked hard and we would like to get better there, he told a pre-departure press conference here. 

This is an important series as we will play against two good teams. Sri Lanka are playing well. They even play better at home. So we have to play well there, he added. 

Dravid did not disclose who will open the innings during the tournament, saying a lot of options are there before the team. 

A lot of players have opened earlier. Sachin (Tendulkar), (Mahendra Singh) Dhoni, Viru (Virender Sehwag) and myself have opened on different occasions. So it is not an issue who plays up. Rather it is important how we play. 

Dravid said during the skill-specific camp, they discussed how to make the best use of the middle overs while batting. We talked about batting in the middle overs on slow wickets, how to create best chance for scoring a lot of runs in that part of the match. 

Coach Greg Chappell, who was also present at the press conference, said the experience of playing on slow wickets in the West Indies would come handy during the tri-series. We played on some slow wickets in the West Indies. And in Sri Lanka the wickets would be similar. 

It is about putting pressure on the opponents and resisting pressure. Its about executing our plans well, he said. 

Chappell expressed hope that the innovative training the players were put through during the conditioning camp would benefit them in the long run. (PTI)

 Australia make semi-finals at Indias expense

Mohali: India suffered the ignominy of an early exit from the ICC Champions Trophy after a six-wicket thrashing at the hands of Australia who romped into the semi-finals without much fuss here on Sunday. 

The Indians managed to score 249 for eight on a good batting strip with Virender Sehwag (65) and Rahul Dravid (52) being the top scorers. But their bowling lacked the sting to stop the awesome Australians from cantering to a facile victory with 4.2 overs to spare in the floodlit contest. 

It was a painful knock-out punch for the home team who were expected to at least make it to the semi-finals since they were playing at home but the party will now carry on without the hosts. 

The world champions had the game in control right through with useful contributions coming from captain Ricky Ponting (58), Shane Watson (50) and Damien Martyn (73 not out) which helped the team to overhaul the target with more than four overs to spare. 

The victory ensured that Australia moved into the semi-finals as the champion team from group A and will now take on New Zealand in the first semi-final here on November 1. 

South Africa, who emerged as the champion team in group B, will clash with the West Indies in the second semi-final in Jaipur on November 2. 

The final is scheduled to be held in Mumbai on November 5. Paceman Sreesanth, coming into the team for an injured Ajit Agarkar, provided the breakthrough by scalping the rampaging Gilchrist with Suresh Raina bringing off a spectacular catch. 

Gilchrists knock of 23 came off just 24 balls and contained four boundaries. 

Watson, who was bothered by cramps, and captain Ricky Ponting kept the good work going as the pair put on 52 runs for the second wicket which took the Australian total beyond the 100 mark. 

Dinesh Mongia accounted for the dismissal of Watson with umpire Steve Bucknor ruling him leg before wicket much to the dismay of the batsman. 

Ponting, who had not scored too many runs in the two earlier league matches, made amends by scoring a half century before falling prey to Sreesanth with Sachin snapping up the catch at slips. 

But Ponting had by that time put the world champions on the road to victory along with Damien Martyn who produced some exhilarating strokes during his stay at the crease. 

Earlier, electing to bat, the Indian batsmen put up an improved performance to score 249 for eight but it was not sufficient in the end. 

Sehwag notched up his 24th ODI half century while Rahul Dravid (52) and Mohammed Kaif (30) were the other notable contributors for the home team on a track which appeared a little more conducive for strokeplay. 

Mahendra Singh Dhoni provided the sparks in the slog overs with a cameo 28 to leave the Australians an asking rate of five to win the floodlit contest. 

Glenn McGrath provided the breakthrough by claiming the prized scalp of Sachin (10) with a controlled outgoing delivery. The star batsman got a nick and Gilchrist latched on to a smart catch to complete his 400th one-day dismissal. 

After persisting with Irfan Pathan at the No. 3 slot for a number of matches, the Indian team management did not take any chance in this crucial game and sent in Dinesh Mongia in that position. 

The left handed Mongia, playing his first match in the high-profile tournament, made his intentions clear pulling McGrath to the fence to open his account in style.Captain Dravid, appearing in his 300th one-day International, immediately got into the act by hammering two boundaries off Lee who seemed to struggle for rhythm on a bouncy track. 

The home team suffered a big jolt in the 29th ver when Sehwags innings came to an end, trapped in front of the wicket with Johnson accounting for the important scalp.

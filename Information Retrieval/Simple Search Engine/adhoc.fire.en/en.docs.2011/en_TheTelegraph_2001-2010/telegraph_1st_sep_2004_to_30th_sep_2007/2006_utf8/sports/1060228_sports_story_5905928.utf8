The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Im my own man: Panesar

 - Spinner expects India-based kin to show up in Mohali 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Monty Panesar

Nagpur: The Luton-born Mudhsuden Monty Singh Panesar isnt expecting any of his India-based relatives to turn up for the first Test, beginning here on Wednesday, but definitely expects some to be present in Mohali ? venue of Test No. 2, from March 9. 

I have quite a few relatives in Ludhiana (from where parents Paramjit and Gursharan migrated) and I suppose theyre going to come to Mohali... That, at least, is my expectation, the slow left-arm bowler told The Telegraph. 

Interacting briefly at the team hotel, on Monday afternoon, Panesar said he didnt have a role model spinner: Basically, Im my own man... Havent idolised anybody... 

The first Sikh in line to play Test cricket for England, Panesar turns out for Northants, our own Bishan Singh Bedis old County. The 23-year-old can speak Punjabi fluently, but English is the language at home. 

Panesar has a younger brother (Isher) and sister (Charanjit).

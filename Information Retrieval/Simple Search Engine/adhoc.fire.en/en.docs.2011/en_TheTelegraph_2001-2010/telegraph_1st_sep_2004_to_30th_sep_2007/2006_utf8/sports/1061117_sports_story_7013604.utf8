 Aussies pick 5 pacers

Sydney: Australia have signalled their intention to fight fire with fire by picking five fast bowlers in a 13-man squad for next weeks first Ashes Test against England in Brisbane. 

The selectors kept faith in most of their ageing batsmen that lost the Ashes last year but beefed up their bowling stocks with the inclusion of Stuart Clark, Shaun Tait and the uncapped Mitchell Johnson, although only one of them is likely to play. 

Meanwhile, Cricket Australia (CA) announced on Thursday the appointment of Jamie Cox as replacement for Allan Border who resigned as one of the four selectors in the national selection panel. 

THE SQUAD 

Ricky Ponting (captain), Justin Langer, Matthew Hayden, Damien Martyn, Michael Hussey, Shane Watson, Adam Gilchrist, Brett Lee, Shane Warne, Stuart Clark, Glenn McGrath, Mitchell Johnson, Shaun Tait (one to be omitted).

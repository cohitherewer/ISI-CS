Bangalore: Third seed Mara Santangelo, sixth-seeded Jelena Kostanic of Croatia, unseeded American Vania King and Melinda Czink of Hungary advanced to the semi-finals of the WTA Bangalore Open here on Friday. 

The 24-year-old Kostanic was leading 4-2 in the first set when her opponent Maria Elena Camerin of Italy retired complaining of illness. 

Kostanic, who has been a runner-up at two WTA Tour events, most recently at Pattaya, will meet Czink, who defeated Alona Bondarenko of Ukraine 6-2, 6-7, 7-6. 

In another quarter final, King overpowered Frances Camille Pin, who beat Sania Mirza in the second round, 6-2, 7-6 (9-7). 

Italian Santangelo beat unseeded Yuliana Fedak of Ukraine 6-4, 6-3 to set up a date with King. 

At 17, King is the youngest player in the singles draw. 

King, ranked 140th in the world, said the second set against Pin was very tough. 

I decided to fight to the full extent and win the match, having come all the way to India and I succeeded, the baseliner, who prefers hardcourts, said.

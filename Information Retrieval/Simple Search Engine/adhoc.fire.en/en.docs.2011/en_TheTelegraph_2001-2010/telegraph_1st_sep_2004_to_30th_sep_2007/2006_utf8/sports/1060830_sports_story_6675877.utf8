 Beating Aussies will be morale-boosting

 - Everyone should be wary of injury now: Harbhajan

Jalandhar: Ace spinner Harbhajan Singh believes beating the mighty Australians in the forthcoming tri-series in Malaysia would give India the psychological advantage ahead of the Champions Trophy and the World Cup. 

 Harbhajan said the Indian team will have a fair idea about the game plan and the combination for next years World Cup by the end of the year. 

It will be a tough series as beating Australia is a Herculean task. And if we manage to win, it will definitely boost the teams morale for the coming World Cup, Harbhajan said on Tuesday. 

India clash with Australia and the West Indies in a limited overs series in Malaysia from September 12 to 24. 

Harbhajan said there would be no such thing as home advantage for India when they host the Champions Trophy in October-November. 

As far as the ODIs are concerned, it does not make much difference whether you play at home or away. As you can see, most of the times the scores are in excess of 250, Harbhajan said. 

He rued the no-show in Sri Lanka where South Africa pulled out of a tri-series and later Indias rescheduled series against the home team was washed out by rains. 

Harbhajan had a piece of advice for Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq who faces a ban of up to eight ODIs or four Tests following charges of ball tampering and bringing the game into disrepute in the fourth Test against England at The Oval. 

The 26-year-old spinner said Inzamam should focus on the game instead of worrying about the outcome of the hearing. 

At this particular time, the player should concentrate more on cricket than waiting for a decision by the ICC, he said. 

He said the Oval Test controversy had undermined the image of the gentlemans game. 

For cricket such controversies are always bad and undermine the image of the game in the world. It will be good for the game if the controversy is solved at the earliest, he said. 

Referring to the recent warning by coach Greg Chappell which said that non-performing players could be kept out from the World Cup team, Harbhajan said: Every player is always on notice as he knows that if he does not perform well, his chances of continuing in the team are bleak. 

He described the shoulder injury to senior spin partner Anil Kumble during his County stint for Surrey as unfortunate and wished the Karnataka bowler an early recovery. 

This is the time when everyone should be wary of injury, due to which they can miss the flight for the World Cup. Even a minor injury takes four or six months to recover, he added.

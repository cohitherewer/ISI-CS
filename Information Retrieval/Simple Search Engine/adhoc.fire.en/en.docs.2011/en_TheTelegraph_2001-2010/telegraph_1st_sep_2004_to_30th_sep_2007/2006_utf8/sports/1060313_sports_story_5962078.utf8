 Randhawa finishes tied 7th 

 - Singapore Golf Mamat lifts title 

Singapore: Jyoti Randhawa reserved his best for the last round and shot a four-under 68 on a day when scoring was not easy at the Singapore Masters at the Laguna National Golf and Country Club. 

He shot a bogey-free four-under 32 on the back nine and that saw him rocket to tied seventh, and register yet another top-10 finish on the European tour. 

Meanwhile, Mardan Mamat made history when he snatched the title by one stroke from Nick Dougherty after a heroic final-round performance on Sunday. Mamat became the first local player to win the co-sanctioned Singapore Masters in the six-year history and also the first Singaporean winner on the European tour. 

A final round of one-under-par 71 took Mamat to 12-under-par 276 for a wire-to-wire victory as he stood firm against the spirited challenges of Dougherty, Charlie Wi of Korea and Englands Ross Fisher. 

Gaurav Ghei (76) finished tied 47th, while Amandeep Johl (75) was tied 66th and Shiv Kapur (76) tied for 76th. 

Randhawas 68 was among the handful of scores in 60s and he rose from tied 22nd to seventh to tie with Andrew Butterfield. Randhawa had one each of birdie and bogey on front nine and then fired four birdies on the return journey to complete a fine day. (PTI)

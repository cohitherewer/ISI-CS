 Cronje inquest begins today

Durban: Investigation on allegations that the aircraft crash in 2002 in which former South African cricket captain Hansie Cronje died may not have been an accident, will be launched when the inquest into his death starts on Monday. 

The inquest will be heard by high court judge Siraj Desai and a senior assessor in Cape Town. 

The murder allegations are reported to have been made in the British media, because at the time of the crash, Cronje was about to disclose to the police in India full details of those involved in the match-fixing saga. 

But the office of Judge Desai has said that most of the evidence would be obtained from the report by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) investigation into the crash. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Day of RCTC goof-ups 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: RCTCs stewards goofed it up twice on an eventful Wednesday. In the third race, the Bookmakers Association Cup, they failed to be prompt in ordering an enquiry into the dangerous riding of jockey Mark Reuben who almost brought the entire field to the ground. Instead, stewards waited for objections to be raised by the biggest sufferer in the race, jockey N.Sequeira (Over The Rainbow) against the troubleshooter. Stewards got into act, albeit late ? by disqualifying the horse, Grand Ceremony, and slapping her jockey Reuben with a four-day suspension. 

 The stewards slipped yet again, in the concluding event, the Network Cup. In the race, they allowed a seasoned Hyderabad-based jockey, Rutherford Alford, to be substituted with an 3-1/2kg allowanced apprentice, Sreekant. The switch may have gone unnoticed but to their chagrin, Sreekant engineered a smart victory on Way To The Stars, over Regal Venture, a Daniel David-trainee. 

 Daniel cried foul, and raised an objection on the grounds of contravention of RCTCs Racing Rules. Rule 144 (a) reads ....Stewards at their discretion may order the declared rider to be substituted by another rider as in their absolute judgement is of near equal calibre... His objection was, however, overruled. 

 If Daniel acted within his right about the substitution, Stephens camp stressed that the apprentice was forced upon them by the RCTC while they desired the services of C.Alford. Alford was available but stewards felt that he was far too good a jockey for Rutherfords replacement.

 The afternoon was, otherwise, tailor-made for Daniel and his fellow schooler Javed Khan, who notched up a treble and a double apiece.

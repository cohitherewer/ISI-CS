 Deepan stuns Surya Sekhar

Hyderabad: International Master Deepan Chakravarthy scored a convincing victory over national champion and Grandmaster Surya Sekhar Ganguly to retain sole lead after the sixth round of ONGC Cup International Grandmasters chess tournament at the K.V.B.R. Indoor Stadium here on Wednesday. 

With his sixth victory on the trot, Deepan, former Asian junior champion, is now aiming for his second Grandmaster norm in the Rs 8.27 lakh-prize money tournament. 

The nearest challenger for the young Indian is GM Alexander Fominyh of Russia, who ended the dream run of Bengals Somak Palit in a professional display of positional chess. 

The Russian, with 5.5 points, was half a point adrift of Deepan. 

A pack of 11 players, including second seed GM Pavel Kostur of Kazakhstan, GM-elect G.B. Prakash, Reefat Bin Sattar of Bangladesh, GM-norm holder S. Kidambi and local stars M.R. Lalith Babu and K. Ramu are also in the reckoning for top honours, having five points each. 

Deepan treated a risky path in opening part of the game against Surya Sekhar, who played the black side of a Sicilian Kan variation. 

He knocked down one black pawn and transposed to a rook and pawns endgame to emerge victorious in 65 moves. 

Fominyh defeated Somak in a Catalan opening, where the former played white.

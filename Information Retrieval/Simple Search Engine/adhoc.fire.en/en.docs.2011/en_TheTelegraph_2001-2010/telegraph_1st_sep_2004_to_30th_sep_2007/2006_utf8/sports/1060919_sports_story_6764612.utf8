The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Thai veteran happy to pass a tough test

 A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The first-round face-off between Tamarine Tanasugarn and Kaia Kanepi was a match of epic proportions at the Sunfeast Open on Monday. It lasted all of three hours and two minutes. The result: 6-7 (10-12), 7-5, 6-0 in favour of Tanasugarn. 

A match of fluctuating fortunes. A test of nerves and patience, a hurdle that Tanasugarn managed to cross. 

Was it a great escape, Tanasugarn was asked at the press conference? Well it certainly was a tough test which I am happy to have passed, smiled the 29-year-old Thai. It could have gone either way. 

But she certainly was not at her best in the first set and the first half of the second. Tanasugarn holds her injury responsible for it, an injury to her feet and ankle that has bothered her for some time and from which she is trying to make a comeback. 

The Estonian was bothered by cramps in the third set. Did that make Tanasugarns work easier? She certainly didnt move so well in the third set, admits Tanasugarn. Maybe it did make my work a little easier. 

Its tennis, smiled a philosophical Kanepi after the loss. It was a tough match and it was just not my day. 

The cramps forced her to play short rallies in the third set, to avoid much movement. But even then she missed many. 

Five-four up in the second set, was she nervous? Well I wanted to win so badly that I guess I was a little nervous. Moreover, being the sixth seed, I guess there was this pressure to succeed as well she shrugs. 

To come back to Tanasugarn, players from Thailand, like Paradorn Srichaphan and herself were doing very well on the world stage not so long ago. Then what happened? Well, Paradorn is still No. 1 in Asia and I believe he will certainly be back in the top 10 before long. Its so hard to be up there all the time, says Tanasugarn. 

She also believes that Asian women like Sania Mirza, Angelique Widjaja and herself, as also the Chinese brigade, have the potential to make a mark on the world stage. 

And what are the targets she is setting for herself? Im taking it on a day-to-day basis and enjoying the game. 

But having been in the top 100 for close to nine years, she must be having a target in mind? Yes, concedes the Thai who is world No. 125 now. She does not wish to stretch herself too much but she would certainly like to be back in the top 100 by the end of the year.

 No Churchill-type speeches

Gelsenkirchen: Coach Sven-Goran Eriksson said on Friday he will not be making any Churchillian speeches, but is convinced England will lift their game in their World Cup quarter final with Portugal. 

Asked whether he would be more animated for a game which could lead to Englands first World Cup semi-final since 1990, Eriksson told a news conference: I will be as Ive always been. 

I will not read Winston Churchill tonight and try to be him, though I have read some of his memoirs, a long time ago.

 Tough task for Juventus: Deschamps

Rome: New Juventus coach Didier Deschamps has admitted that it was practically impossible for the Italian giants to regain their Serie A place at the first attempt following their match-fixing demotion. 

Juventus were relegated and docked 30 points from their total for next season as punishment for being caught up in the scandal which rocked the countrys national sport. 

Juventus were stripped of their last two league titles, while Fiorentina and Lazio were also demoted to Serie B for their part in the affair. 

It is difficult to get to the first division in just one year, said Deschamps who has taken over from Fabio Capello. 

With 30 points deducted, its practically impossible. 

Juventus new president Giovanni Cobolli Gilli promised fans that the clubs relegation will not necessarily lead to the departure of all the teams star names. 

I hope that some of our important players will stay, he said. 

Obviously lots of them will find it hard to stay with us in Serie B with 30 points deducted, but the clubs that are interested will have to pay full rate.

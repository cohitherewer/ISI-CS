The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Nicest compliment touches Yuvraj 

 - What Gower has said will serve as an inspiration 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Yuvraj 

 Calcutta: Yuvraj Singh 

 has been touched by former England captain David Gowers 

 compliment that, currently, hes batting better than 

 the legendary Brian Lara. 

 Thats the nicest (compliment) 

 Ive received? Im touched, the in-form 

 Yuvraj told The Telegraph from Guwahati 

 on Saturday evening. 

He added: Of course, its going to take me time to reach or come close to where Lara is, but what Gower has said will serve as an inspiration? 

Having himself been an exceptional left-hander, Gower praised Yuvraj in his latest column (published on Saturday) in the following manner: He has that high back lift which reminds me of Brian Lara and he is actually batting better than Lara at the moment. 

Yuvraj has been having a phenomenal 2005-06 and with five ODIs remaining before the season ends, has struck five hundreds, five fifties and three forties in 29 innings. 

He stayed unbeaten on seven occasions. 

Among other things, this fantastic run has made Yuvraj a strong contender for the International Cricket Councils ODI Player of the Year award. 

Last year, it went to Kevin Pietersen. In fact, hed bagged another award as well ? Emerging Player of the Year. 

The world bodys awards for 2005-06 are going to be presented either before/during the October-November Champions Trophy in India. Mumbai is the likely venue. 

 The awards got instituted in 2004.

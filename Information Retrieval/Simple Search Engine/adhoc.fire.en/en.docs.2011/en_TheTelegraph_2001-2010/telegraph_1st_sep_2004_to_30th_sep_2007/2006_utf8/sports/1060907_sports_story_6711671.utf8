 ICC tab on Inzy!

Karachi: The ICC is monitoring the statements and columns of Inzamam-ul Haq and has even obtained services of an Urdu language translator for the purpose. The ICC had issued a stern warning to Inzamam, the team management and the PCB on Monday, asking them to refrain from making inappropriate comments on incidents related to the controversial Oval Test. 

A source in the PCB said the ICC had been monitoring the columns of Inzamam in a Pakistan daily. 

Inzamam has now been told to be careful about what he writes in his column as it is available to the ICC. He has been advised to just stick to non-controversial cricket matters, the source said. (PTI)

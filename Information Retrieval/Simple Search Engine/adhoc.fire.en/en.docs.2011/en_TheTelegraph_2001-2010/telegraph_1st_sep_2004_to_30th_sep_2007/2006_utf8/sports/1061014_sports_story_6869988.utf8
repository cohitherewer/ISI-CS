 Crookes shocked by statement

Durban: Former South African cricketer Derek Crookes has expressed shock and astonishment that his name was mentioned by teammate Herschelle Gibbs as one of the three players involved in match-fixing during the countrys tour to India in 2000. 

Gibbs, who was questioned by Indian police on Thursday, accepted that he received offers to under-perform twice in ODIs in 1996 and 2000, named Crookes along with two other South African players as being part of the match-fixing conspiracy. 

I was shocked when I heard it especially as I was cleared by the King Commission of any involvement in match-fixing. I have never had anything to hide and gave evidence during the King Commissions hearings, Crookes was quoted as saying in a Johannesburg newspaper. 

I will be more than willing to make a statement, along with my legal team, to the Indian police, he said. He wont travel to India to give a statement and said the Indian police should come down to South Africa to question him.

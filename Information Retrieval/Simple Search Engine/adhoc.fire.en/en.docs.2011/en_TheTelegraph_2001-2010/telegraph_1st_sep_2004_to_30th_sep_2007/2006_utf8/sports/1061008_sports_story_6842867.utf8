Tokyo: World No.1 Roger Federer continued his excellent run on hard courts to beat Benjamin Becker of Germany on Friday for a place in the final at the Japan Open. 

The 25-year-old Swiss, who set an open era record of a 56-match hard court winning streak earlier this year, pulled off a service break once in each set to score a convincing 6-3, 6-4 victory in just one hour. 

Federer, who had a tough three-set match against local hope Takao Suzuki in the quarter finals Friday, got off to a flying start by converting the first chance to break in the second game. 

Becker got a break point at 30-40 in the fifth game by charging to the net and forcing Federer to misfire a backhand, but failed to capitalise. 

After breaking Becker in the third game of the second set, Federer went on to finish off the struggling German. 

Federer hit a total of nine aces against Beckers four. He improved his winning record on hard courts this season to 48-2. 

Federer has made 13 finals out of 14 tournaments this season, winning eight of them including victories at the Australian Open, Wimbledon and the US Open. 

Federer will meet Britains Tim Henman in Sundays final at Ariake Colosseum. Henman, who is chasing his first title this year, posted a 6-4, 7-6 (7-5) win over ninth-seeded Lee Hyung-taik of South Korea. 

Federer said he was looking forward to playing Henman. 

That will be fun, said Federer. Hes a good friend of mine. I think playing Henman will be a little bit more exciting for myself. 

In the womens singles semi-finals, Aiko Nakamura kept local hopes alive by beating Chan Yung-Jan of Taiwan 7-6 (7-3), 2-6, 6-4 to make her first career appearance in a final on the tour. (AFP)

 Raina, Sreesanth land contracts

New Delhi: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) handed over central contracts to Suresh Raina and Sreesanth on Thursday following impressive starts to their international careers. 

Raina and Sreesanth would be included in Grade C of the central contracts list and offered a retainership of Rs 20 lakh per annum, the BCCI said in a media release. 

The BCCI had offered central contracts to 15 players in December and announced that if a non-contracted player appeared in five Tests or 15 one-dayers, he would be absorbed into the lowest grade. 

Thus, the central contracts list now includes 17 players. 

The BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah said that the contracts for both Raina and Sreesanth would be as applicable as to the other members of the Indian squad, meaning it would be backdated and run through upto the end of 2006.

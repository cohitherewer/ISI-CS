Miami: World No.1 Roger Federer posted his third win of the season over Tommy Haas with a 6-1, 6-3 victory into the fourth round of the Miami Masters on Monday. 

The Swiss top seed unleashed his majestic game at the expense of the former world No.2, who also lost to Federer at Doha and the Australian Open. 

Federer, with childhood hero Boris Becker watching from the stands, needed just 68 minutes to book his place in the next round. 

Briton Tim Henman was stunned by unheralded German qualifier Simon Greul 0-6, 6-1, 7-5 while 2004 winner Andy Roddick, seeded fourth, defeated Spains Fernando Verdasco 6-3, 6-4. 

Playing in his first Masters Series tournament, the German baffled Henman as he levelled at a set apiece, then recovered from a break down in the third to complete the upset. 

Womens fourth seed Maria Sharapova survived a scare before she booked her place in the quarter finals. She needed five match points before overcoming fellow Russian Maria Kirilenko 3-6, 6-4, 6-1. 

Former Wimbledon champion Sharapova avenged her defeat by Kirilenko in Beijing last September despite producing 43 unforced errors. 

I was down a set but I tried to hang in, Sharapova said following the battle that lasted over two hours. 

Meanwhile, Indias Sania Mirza and Ana Ivanovic of Serbia and Montenegro have advanced to the doubles quarter finals with a facile second round victory. 

Sania and Ana defeated Kveta Peschke of the Czech Republic and Italys Francesca Schiavone 6-1, 6-3 on Monday.

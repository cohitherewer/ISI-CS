 Haunting Memories wins from start 

 HONKY DORY

 B. Prakash on haunting 

 Memories 

 Haunting Memories became the richest 

 filly of her age following an impressive start-to-finish 

 victory in the 1,400m Poonawalla Breeders Multi-Million 

 at the Mahalaxmi racecourse, Mumbai, on Sunday. Jockey B.Prakash 

 partnered the Placerville-Haunting Beauty daughter to a 

 two and half-a-length victory for the winners purse 

 of over Rs 41 lakh. S. Ganapathy-trained the winner.

 The city-challenger, Ardelis was no match for the winner. The Vijay Singh-trainee was up with the field till 300m from home but went backwards thereafter to finish last in a 10-horse field. The Razeen-Kolar Gold son, perhaps, failed to recover from the long and arduous journey which he was made to undertake a week before the big race.

 Ivan Lendls daughter prepares for golf test

Virginia Water (England): With Ryder Cup fever mounting among the men, the daughter of eight-time Grand Slam tennis champion Ivan Lendl is preparing for her own battle in the junior version of the biennial team event. 

Lendl seems pleased his 15-year-old daughter Isabelle, who is ranked fifth among US girls, has focused on golf rather than tennis. 

I stay away from the golf aspect as she has a coach who knows far more than me, said Lendl senior in a news release issued on the eve of Sundays Junior Ryder Cup opening ceremony in Newport, Wales. 

What I do help her with is the preparation. I teach her how to be mentally tough, how to eat properly and about the importance of concentration. 

Lendl senior, who was born in the former Czechoslovakia, is also a good golfer and plays on professional mini-tours in the US. 

There were no golf courses in Czechoslovakia when I was growing up so I was never around golf, although I wish I had been as you never have to quit, just look at Gary Player, he said. 

Dont get me wrong though, I was more than happy with how my career turned out. The two-day Junior Ryder Cup, which involves six boys and six girls in each team, at the Celtic Manor resort ends on Tuesday when the winners will receive the trophy from six-times major champion Nick Faldo.

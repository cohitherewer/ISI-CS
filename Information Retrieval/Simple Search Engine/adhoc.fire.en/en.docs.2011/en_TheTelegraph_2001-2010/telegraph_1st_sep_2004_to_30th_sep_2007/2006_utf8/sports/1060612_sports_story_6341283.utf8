 Schaefer may be Togo coach

Ravensburg: Winfried Schaefer, the experienced former Cameroon coach, is ready to take charge of the troubled Togo World Cup team after their trainer quit over a players pay dispute. 

Im just about to drive to (Togo team base) Wangen to meet management and players. We already talked last night. I will take the job if everything is in order, if they are disciplined, Schaefer said on the telephone on Sunday. 

It (the pay dispute) has to be settled. Thats a condition. 

On Saturday, assistant coach Kodjovi Mawuena found himself promoted to the top coaching job after Otto Pfister walked out, saying he could not do his job with a pay row between players and officials unresolved. (Reuters)

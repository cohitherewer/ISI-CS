 Ganapathy 

 wards hold advantage

 HONKY DORY

 Trainer 

 S. Ganapthys wards Ruben Star and Secret Memory 

 hold the key to the 2,000 Nanoli Stud Pune Derby, the star 

 attraction of the racing season and the main event in Sundays 

 race card. However, going by their recent form, the Placerville-Forest 

 Fantasy son, Ruben Star, appears to hold a slight edge over 

 his main rival and may strike in the hands of jockey B.Prakash.

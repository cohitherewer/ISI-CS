 Internacional stun Barcelona to title

 Club World Cup 

Yokohama: Substitute Adriano fired a dramatic 82nd-minute winner as Brazils Internacional stunned Barcelona 1-0 to win the Club World Cup on Sunday. 

European champions Barcelona had totally dominated in front of 67,000 in Yokohama until Adriano latched on to Iarleys clever ball to poke the ball past goalkeeper Victor Valdes. 

Deco forced a superb save from Inter goalkeeper Clemer moments later and Ronaldinho shaved the post with a free kick from 25m in the 85th minute as Barcelona tried to respond. 

Barcelona struggled to reproduce the same form that they showed in their 4-0 demolition of Mexicos America in the semi-finals. 

But Inter, who scraped past Egypts Al Ahli 2-1 in their semi-finals, rarely threatened and Adrianos breakaway winner was a bolt from the blue from the Libertadores Cup holders. 

Im over the moon, said Adriano. Its great to beat Barcelona. We were under a lot of pressure in the first half but we got better as the game went on. 

Ronaldinho squandered Barcelonas best chance of the first half, blasting into the side-netting after goalkeeper Clemer had spilled Decos long-range shot in the 19th minute. 

Substitute Xavi forced a sharp save from Clemer in the 74th minute after a clever flick from Deco but Barca failed to add the finishing touch to their slick build-up play. 

Deco was voted player of the tournament but it was scant consolation for a Barcelona side bidding to go one better than Johan Cruyffs stylish side of the early 1990s. 

Cruyffs Barcelona lost 1-2 to Sao Paulo in 1992 in the Club World Cups forerunner a one-off game between the European and South American champions. Inters victory made it two wins out of two for Brazilian teams in the revamped FIFA tournament involving the worlds six continental champions. 

Sao Paulo beat Liverpool 1-0 in last years final. 

Meanwhile in Brazil, after the final whistle, fans loudly cheered and chanted throughout the city to commemorate the Brazilian clubs first world title in its 97-year history. 

Supporters set off firecrackers and drivers honked horns after the match ended Sunday morning. Even sound trucks were used in the celebrations. 

Some fans woke up early to watch the match on a big-screen TV in a city park, while others chose to watch it near the teams Beira-Rio stadium. 

Internacional fans had an extra reason to celebrate because Ronaldinho used to play for fierce local rival Gremio, also based in Porto Alegre.

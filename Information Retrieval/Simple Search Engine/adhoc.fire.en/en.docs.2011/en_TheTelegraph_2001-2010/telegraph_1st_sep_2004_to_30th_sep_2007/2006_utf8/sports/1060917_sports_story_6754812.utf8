 Zlatan refusal

Stockholm: Striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic has refused to play for Sweden in the next two Euro 2008 qualifying ties after being sent home for staying out late before the previous match, the soccer association said on Friday. 

Ibrahimovic, who plays for Inter Milan, Nantes midfielder Christian Wilhelmsson and Aston Villa defender Olof Mellberg were sent packing by coach Lars Lagerback two days before a Sept. 6 Group F tie against Liechtenstein. 

Ibrahimovic will miss Swedens home tie against Spain on October 7 and the away game against Iceland four days later. Sweden beat Liechtenstein 3-1. (Reuters)

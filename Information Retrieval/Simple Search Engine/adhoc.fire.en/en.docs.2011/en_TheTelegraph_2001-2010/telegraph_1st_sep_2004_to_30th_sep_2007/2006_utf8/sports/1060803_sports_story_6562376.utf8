Washington: Five-times champion and sentimental favourite Andre Agassi lost in straight sets to Italian qualifier Andrea Stoppini in the Washington Classic second round on Tuesday. 

The 36-year-old, making his 17th and final appearance at the event, had no answer to Stoppinis strong serve and crisp groundstrokes, losing 6-4, 6-3 in 62 minutes. 

Indias Somdev Dev Varman lost to Argentinas Edgardo Massa 4-6, 0-6 in the first round on Tuesday. 

Stoppini, ranked 246th in the world, won his first career ATP match on Monday against Paul Goldstein before knocking out the fourth-seed. 

I was very frustrated, Agassi, who will retire after this years US Open, told reporters. I wanted it really bad to get out there and be comfortable and hit my shots. 

But I felt with every point the court got smaller and smaller. I had a harder time keeping the ball in the court. I never found my rhythm. 

In other matches, top-seeded James Blake survived a shaky middle set to defeat fellow American Kevin Kim 7-5, 3-6, 6-2. 

Sixth-seeded Sebastien Grosjean of France lost to South African Wesley Moodie 6-4, 3-6, 6-3, and Denmarks Kenneth Carlsen upset ninth seed Paradorn Srichaphan of Thailand 4-6, 7-6, 6-3. 

The 26-year-old Stoppini recorded the only service break of the first set in the 10th and final game when the error-prone American punched a backhand over the baseline. 

Stoppini, who had to win three matches just to qualify for the main draw, raced into a 3-0 lead in the second set, making Agassi smash his racket on the court in disgust. (Reuters)

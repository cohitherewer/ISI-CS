The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 I dont carry a hype... Im pretty clinical

 - A TELEGRAPH EXCLUSIVE 

 Anil Kumble says hes at his best when really intense 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Lahore: Sachin Tendulkar has completed 16 years at the highest level; Anil Kumble is on the verge of doing so. In fact, Indias most successful bowler (and only the second in history to take all ten wickets in a Test innings) is a mere 15 away from becoming the fifth entrant to the 500 club. Besides, he has 329 wickets in ODIs... Kumble, 35, spoke to The Telegraph in the lead-up to the latest Test series, which gets underway here on Friday. 

The following are excerpts 

Q Come April and youll complete 16 years of international cricket. How do you reflect on this journey? 

A It has been very satisfying... Of course, when I started off (in Sharjah), I didnt realise I would get this far... 

Is there a regret ? perhaps, that you werent picked for the 1991-92 tour of Australia? 

Its not a regret... Getting dropped or selected isnt in my hands, performing is. 

Conventional wisdom suggests spinners mature with age. How long did it take you? 

(Grins) Im still learning... On every tour, in every match... I continue to learn about myself, about the way I can bowl (better)... I continue to analyse my bowling... I needed about three years to find my feet and, in that period, there was a time when I wasnt in the team... Looking back, it probably was a blessing in disguise. 

What does it take to flourish, not just survive at the highest level? 

One needs to perform... One needs to be fit, to be positive and be analytical about ones game... Its also important to enjoy the cricket... Obviously, there are going to be ups and downs when the journey is so long. (After a pause) Besides being positive, I learn from both success and failure. 

As a turning point, would it be the first tour (1992-93) of South Africa, when you got recalled? 

Yes... If I hadnt got wickets there, I may not have been retained for the home series against Graham Goochs England... 

 Over the years, has your take on life changed following something you learnt out in the middle? 

The process of evolving doesnt stop... I try and learn from the people I interact with... Its difficult, though, to put a finger on one thing... I mean, even my first exposure to County cricket (1995, Northants) helped develop my personality... Helped me grow as a person. 

The early influences apart, has anybody made a huge impression in the past 16 years? 

Ive watched Shane Warne closely and tried to learn from him... I cant manage his level of skill, but Ive followed the way he preys on batsmen... Sets things up... Ive tried to learn from Steve Waugh, too... He had his share of critics, but continued to perform... He was amazing... Then, in our dressing room, Ive watched Sachin closely... The manner in which he continues to carry the burden of a billion is remarkable... I learn by watching and, so, its not necessary to actually sit down with somebody and have a conversation. 

Your intensity is exceptional... 

Im at my best when Im really intense... At the end of the day, one has to contribute and in a manner whereby everybody takes notice. (After a pause) When I made my debut, there were many who said I wouldnt last because I didnt spin the ball or... However, I remained positive and never thought I would fade away after a few matches. Failure is part and parcel of a sportsmans career and Ive never worried about it. 

Did you get upset when people accused you of not turning the ball enough? 

Some still say that... My determination has never been to prove a point, but to perform... Im happy if, at the end of the day, I return to my hotel room convinced that Ive given my best. 

Early on, there was talk that only designer pitches (at home) suited you... 

I dont think the pitches were any different in the Sixties and Seventies... So, why make an issue after I started playing? Why didnt people focus on the pitches before I made it to the Indian team? Not once have I ever asked anybody to provide a certain pitch and, never, have I said that the pitch provided wasnt the one I would have liked... Ive never, for instance, complained about flat pitches... Without my consent, people could have said things on my behalf. 

Youre on the threshold of a fantastic achievement... Are you very conscious about being close to 500 Test wickets? 

It will be a milestone to reach and, then, move forward... People do keep reminding me about it, but I dont have to get those 15 wickets in two or three or... Tests... Hopefully, Im going to get there sooner rather than later. 

Arent you under more pressure, though? 

Theres no extra pressure or burden. People forget that cricket is a team game... 

How do you handle pressure? 

Pressure cant be wished away... Its the external factors which add to what already exists... My way of not getting overwhelmed is by sticking to a routine ? whether Im playing for India or South Zone or Karnataka. 

Having the (right) shoulder operated upon, five years ago, turned out to be a good decision... 

(Grins again) But, then, I had run out of options... I couldnt have done anything else... Im thankful to everybody, particularly my wife (Chetana), who kept lifting my confidence during the many months I was off cricket... The rehab programme was excellent and enabled me to return stronger... Of course, I knew I had to fight back and prove that I was good enough for many more wickets. I did. 

Are you reconciled to not playing ODIs? 

I dont worry too much... Ive played international cricket for 16 years and want to enjoy the cricket that comes my way. But, yes, it was disappointing getting few opportunities in the 2003 World Cup... I could have made a bigger contribution, but played just three (of the 11) matches. 

Is it shattering to be in the 14/15, without making the 11? 

Waiting for opportunities is tough, but also a challenge. 

Despite being an outstanding achiever, you dont seem to have got the recognition you deserve. Do you agree? 

At times, Ive thought things could have been different... However, I dont carry a hype... Im pretty clinicial... Scientific in the way I get wickets... Im not a magician who weaves a web around batsmen... My manner, perhaps, doesnt appeal to many... One day, people will realise I must have been a decent bowler to get the wickets I have... Bottomline is that Ive had my share of success and, hopefully, thats going to continue. 

Sixteen years ago, you were a rookie. Today, only Sachin is senior... Whats the change in the dressing room? 

The present-day debutants are much more confident... I accept I didnt have the same confidence... At the same time, the current players have more opportunities and are exposed to better facilities. The paraphernalia adds value to the player... Also, given our success in recent years, newcomers know they have to deliver. 

Your one stand-out performance... 

Difficult to answer... Probably the way I bowled in the big back-to-back series in 2003-04 ? in Australia (24 wickets) and in Pakistan (15 wickets). 

How would you describe yourself? 

Competitive on the field, relaxed and casual off it... (Adds laughing) Im a typical South Indian Brahmin! 

Finally, John Wright felt you were good captaincy material and ought to have led in more than a single ODI... 

I do feel Ive got leadership qualities, but I dont decide on who captains... So, its not something that has bothered me.

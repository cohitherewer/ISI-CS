 Jaffer pins hopes on Kumble

St Johns: After leading Indias fightback in the first Test, opener Wasim Jaffer said the team would be looking for a lead of 300 runs to give ace spinner Anil Kumble a chance to bowl them to victory. 

Jaffers unbeaten 113 on the third day took India to an overall lead of 85 after having incurred a 130-run first innings deficit. Jaffer felt a target of 300 would be tough for the hosts, considering India had Kumble in their ranks. If we can get a lead of 300, it would be difficult for the West Indies since they would be facing up to Anil Kumble, he said. 

The wicket has become easy, but Kumble can still be a factor, the opener said. Amid the chaos which passed off as a press conference, Jaffer showed the same calm which he exhibited in the middle, squaring up to a volley of questions coming from all directions. 

I didnt practice as much as I normally do, but still am happy to have come good at a time when my team needed it, said Jaffer, who has come on the tour on the back of a shin-bone operation in his right leg. 

Jaffer said the fact that he had toured the West Indies before helped him although the bowling attack now wore a new look. Obviously the experience of previous tour counts, but the attack now is different from those times. 

Jaffer admitted that fast bowler Fidel Edwards hamstring strain had worked in Indias favour. (PTI)

 Maria, Serena in semis

Los Angeles: Resurgent Serena Williams overcame a strong challenge from fellow-American Meghann Shaughnessy to move into the Los Angeles Open semi-finals with a 6-7, 6-1, 6-4 win on Friday. 

Competing in only her third event of the year because of a knee injury, twice champion Williams set up the prospect of a mouth-watering showdown with top seed Maria Sharapova in Sundays final. 

Russian Sharapova, chasing her second consecutive WTA Tour title, overwhelmed compatriot Dinara Safina 6-2 6-4 in the days late match. 

Sharapova extended her winning streak to eight matches with an imperious display of searing groundstrokes and 28 winners. 

For the pair to meet in a dream tournament finale, however, Williams has to beat Serbian Jelena Jankovic and Sharapova must knock out fellow Russian Elena Dementieva in the last four. 

Sixteenth seed Jankovic upset 10th-seeded compatriot Ana Ivanovic 6-4, 7-6 in their quarter final and Dementieva, the third seed, recovered from a shaky first set to beat American wildcard Bethanie Mattek 4-6, 6-1, 6-1. 

Williams, who had to rally from a set down to beat Slovakias Daniela Hantuchova in the previous round, dominated her last two sets against Shaughnessy in sapping afternoon heat after losing the first 7-4 on a tie-break. 

Williams, whose world ranking has slipped to 110th after a truncated season, would get close to the top 50 with victory in Sundays final. 

I feel like Im climbing up. Its cool. I have new goals now. Im reaching for the top 50, she added with a laugh.

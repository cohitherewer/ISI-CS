The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Players given golf course for practice

 - Shillong camp in disarray

Faridabad: The All India Football Federation (AIFF) is all set to host the prestigious Asian Youth championships in Bangalore and Calcutta from October 29. While the conduct of the tournament is likely to be a success from the organisational point of view, there are enough indications that the same may not be said about the preparations of the host team. 

While the AIFF officials claim that the team is slowly reaching its peak for a place in the semi-finals, there are clear indications that everything is not right in the way the camp is being conducted at the moment in Shillong under Uzbek coach Islam Akhmedov. 

Akhmedov himself has dropped a bombshell on Thursday when he said that the campers have not even been provided with a proper ground for practice. The ground, he claimed, is actually a golf course and full of holes and the players run the risk of getting injured if they continue practising on it. 

The problems, however, do not end here. The selection process of the squad has also raised quite a few eyebrows especially about the way two Calcutta players have been given a raw deal. 

Both Snehasish Chakraborty of East Bengal and Lal Kamal Bhowmick of Mohun Bagan have been dumped as no good but their recent performances in crucial matches in Calcutta Football League proved that a second opinion was very much needed. 

The federation officials maintain that they have no role to play in selections as the coach has been given a free hand. Akhmedov has been handling the squad for the past one year. He knows the best about the selections, said an AIFF official who is looking after the preparations of the team. 

As far the ground condition is concerned, no one in the team management told us about it. 

The worst thing, however, is that some of the players of this squad are being allowed by the AIFF to skip the camp and play for their respective states in Santosh Trophy. 

While Vimal Pariyar played for Bengal, defender Aibor Khongjee turned out for Meghalaya in Gurgaon. 

The funniest part of the whole episode is that the Meghalaya Football Association secretary B. Diengdoh is himself the manager of the Indian youth squad and the camp is being held at Meghalaya state capital. Yet he defied the rules to take Khongjee out of the camp and play for Meghalaya.

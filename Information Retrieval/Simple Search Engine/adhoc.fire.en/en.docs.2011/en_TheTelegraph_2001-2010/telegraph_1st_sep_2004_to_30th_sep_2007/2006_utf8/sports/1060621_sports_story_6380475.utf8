 Bishop backs VRV

Basseterre: Former West Indies fast bowler Ian Bishop feels VRV Singh may have not been among the wickets in the first two Tests but India should persist with him. 

It would be a grave error if VRV is sacrificed after this series only because he hasnt picked up many wickets. He is a strong lad and has the potential to hurry the batsmen, Bishop said after spending time with the young Indian pacers at nets on Monday. 

Pathan is a swing bowler while VRV has shown good promise, he added. (PTI)

New Delhi: Narain Karthikeyan, currently engaged as the test driver for Williams, feels that the 2007 season could offer him yet another opportunity to turn around on the tracks of Formula One and emerge as the F-I driver for any team, if not for Williams. 

Certainly I would like to race again on Sundays, the Indian motor racing hero said in the capital on Thursday. At the moment I have been learning a lot as the second test driver for Williams. I have improved a lot and am hoping to get a seat next season. It could be for Williams or for someone else, he said. 

Karthikeyan, who was speaking during the launch of JK Tyres formation of a new consortium with Maruti, General Motors and Hyundai to promote motorsport in India, admitted that Williams have not been consistent this season. 

But then, they are a great team and are likely to bounce back. There are still five races to go and still a lot of excitement in on the cards, Karthikeyan said. 

The Coimbatore based race driver said he had been enjoying his role as a test driver. Am happy with my role as the second test driver. The boss, Sir Frank Williams has praised me always, Karthikeyan claimed. 

He said that in the next couple of months he would get a lot training opportunities. This year I had a lot of testing miles and I learned quite a few technical things. I want to see myself back on the track. Lets see what happens, Karthikeyan said. 

He however, was not ready to spell out whether he would emerge as the first test driver for Williams after their first driver Mark Webber has decided to race for Red Bull in 2007. 

At the moment, I cant say anything about that, he said. 

With Webber going, the present Williams first test driver Alexander Wurz is likely to take his place. So, Karthikeyan has naturally been tipped to take over Wurz job. 

I dont know who is taking whose place. I am excited that I have the opportunity and a job in hand. For the present, I want to do that job in the best possible manner.

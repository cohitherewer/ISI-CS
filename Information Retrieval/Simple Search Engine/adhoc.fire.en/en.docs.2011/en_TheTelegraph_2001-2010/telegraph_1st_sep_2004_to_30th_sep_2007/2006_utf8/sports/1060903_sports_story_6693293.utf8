 Randhawa is joint second

 Randhawa 

Johor Bahru (Malaysia): Jyoti Randhawa, without a title since his Volvo Masters win in December, moved within two shots of leader Anton Haig of South Africa in the inaugural $300,000 Pulai Springs Malaysian Masters here on Saturday. 

Randhawa, placed joint second, was powered by an eagle on the short par-5 fourth hole. The Indian, who was joint seventh, also had five birdies and one bogey in a solid round of six-under 66 which carried him to 16-under 200 and brought him close to Haig, who shot a three-under-par 69 for the third round lead. 

Haig, 24, has a three-day total of 18-under-par 198. 

Shiv Kapur fired his third straight 68 and at 12-under he was tied 11th with fellow-Indian Gaurav Ghei (67). Digvijay Singh (71) and Gurbaaz Mann (69) were tied 31st at nine-under, while S.S.P. Chowrasia (73) was tied 48th at five-under. 

The eagle was great. I used a driver and a lob wedge and holed it from 20 feet out and that got me going with a birdie in the next hole, said Randhawa, second on the all-time money list for Asian Tour. 

I am beginning to believe in what Im doing and as long as I stick to the game plan on the mental side, I am on the right track. 

Randhawa has been playing on the European Tour this season and has already secured his full card for 2007 in Europe. 

Randhawa shared the second spot with Thai Chapchai Nirat who carded a 70 and Chinese Taipei veteran Lin Chie-Hsiang (63). 

After leading the way since the opening day, Haig is determined to put his head down and strive for his maiden title on the Asian Tour. 

I played alright today but the putting was not in my favour. I made a few great up and downs which kept me in the lead, so I am quite happy, said Haig, who struck birdies on the first and third holes followed by two more birdies on the 12th and 14th holes before a dropped shot at the 15th hole. 

Its crunch time on Sunday and Ive just got to keep my cool and be patient and let the birdies come as I aim to play solid golf tomorrow, he said. 

Randhawa, a former Asia No. 1, dominated the front nine with a birdie on the second hole before firing an eagle at the par four 317 yards eighth hole and then had another birdie on the ninth hole. 

 He shot three more birdies against a lone bogey as he was two strokes behind the South African. 

Chapchai, with four birdies and two bogeys, heads into the final round determined to challenge the South African for the title. 

The top-five finishers will book their spot for the Barclays Singapore Open next week. The Malaysian Masters champion will qualify for the HSBC Champions tournament.

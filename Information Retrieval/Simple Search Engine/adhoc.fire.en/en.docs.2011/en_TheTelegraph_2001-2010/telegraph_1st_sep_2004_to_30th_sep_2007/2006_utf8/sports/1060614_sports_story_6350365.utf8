 - Match vs Togo

 - l Ahn Jung-hwan should have been in the starting XI

It was third time lucky for an Asian team in Germany, 

 but it wasnt the most convincing of wins for South 

 Korea. In fact, it was only after the Togolese lost a man 

 ? Abalo was sent off on his second booking ? in the 53rd 

 minute that the 2002 World Cup semi-finalists came into 

 their own. 

Down by a Mohamed Kader goal after half an hour, the Asian red devils struggled to get any rhythm against the robust African debutants. 

Their fluent game ? passing, combination play and shooting ? with which they won millions of hearts four years ago, was conspicuous by its absence.

Of course, Togos physical game didnt help the Korean cause. The man Togo relied on the most ? Arsenals talented medio Emmanuel Adebayor ? was off colour. So skill was at a premium in the Togolese show. They didnt show much footballing intelligence either, often inviting trouble by committing unnecessary fouls. 

Still, Togo managed to ward off Korea for the entire opening session which produced the most lacklustre soccer of the meet so far. Advocaats team couldnt create a single opening, neither did anyone attempt a meaningful shot at goal. 

What baffled me was the Dutch coachs decision not to start with Ahn Jung-hwan. 

Here is a striker who played a stellar role in Koreas dream run in 2002. Who will forget his header which knocked out Italy? He may have been sparingly used by Hiddink then, but now he is a matured and established goal-getter. 

Advocaat introduced him after the change of ends and Ahn showed why he should have been in the starting XI. His right-footer to the top corner of the second post was a classy effort. It turned out to be the winning strike. 

All three goals, in fact, were superbly executed and prevented the game from being dumped into the dustbin as a forgettable affair. 

The way Kader trapped the ball with his knee and coolly placed it past the Korean keeper was Togos best piece of football in the entire 90 minutes. 

Koreas equaliser, a curling Lee Chun-soo free-kick which made a mockery of the Togolese human wall, was a beauty as well. 

The good thing about Korea was that they learnt from the mistakes Iran and Japan made in the last couple of days. 

They didnt take victory for granted, even against a 10-man team, and played safe, sound football in the final 10 minutes or so to protect their 2-1 advantage. 

Progress to the knockout stage is, however, anything but assured, what with two tough matches coming up ? against France and Switzerland. 

Advocaat will have to pick the right men and inspire his wards, a la Hiddink, if Korea are to come close to matching their 2002 deeds. Im praying for an encore, but keeping my fingers crossed all the same.

 Haryana to host Santosh Trophy

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: After much dilly dallying, the Haryana Football Association (HFA) has finally been officially intimated on Friday for hosting the national football championship for the Santosh Trophy from September 14 at Gurgaon and Faridabad. 

Speaking to The Telegraph, HFA secretary Sunil Bhardwaj said: Today the All India Football Federation has issued us a letter in this regard. It is a great honour for the state and we hope to make it a great success in our first attempt. 

Asked with only 34 days to go, whether Haryana would be able to complete and provide the required infrastructure at both the venues, Bhardwaj said he was confident the infrastructure would be ready for the tournament. Our chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda and Power and PWD minister Venod Sharma are taking personal interest in making the Santosh Trophy here a success. The state government has promised to sanction Rs. 1.50 crore for installing the floodlights before the start of the final rounds. 

Interestingly, according to AIFF, the championship has been shifted to Haryana from Srinagar because of infrastructural problems and there was no mention about security concerns in Jammu and Kashmir. 

In a press release, AIFF said its president Priya Ranjan Das Munshi met Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Gulam Nabi Azad recently and discussed about the lack of infrastructure. Azad, the AIFF release added, has promised to look into it and has urged the federation to allot the next Santosh Trophy to Jammu and Kashmir.

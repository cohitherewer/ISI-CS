 Relief for Md. Sporting 

Mumbai: Luck finally seems to be favouring Mohammedan Sporting coach Subhas Bhowmick. Ahead of their final National Football League (NFL) engagement against Mohun Bagan on Tuesday, Bhowmicks beleaguered side got a major boost on Saturday when Salgaocar suffered a 0-1 defeat to Air India at the Cooperage. 

Paresh Shivalkar sent a pass across the width of the ground and sprinted into the penalty area to receive the return pass from Narendra Meetai before beating Salgaocar custodian Sangram Mukherjee with a first-timed shot in the 57th minute. 

The result means Salgaocar remained on 11 points from 15 matches and placed second from bottom in the league. They are in real danger of being forced to play in the second division next season. 

Mohammedan Sporting can now heave a sigh of relief sitting with 14 points from 15 matches. A draw would see Mohammedan Sporting stay in the premier tier of the tournament. (Agencies)

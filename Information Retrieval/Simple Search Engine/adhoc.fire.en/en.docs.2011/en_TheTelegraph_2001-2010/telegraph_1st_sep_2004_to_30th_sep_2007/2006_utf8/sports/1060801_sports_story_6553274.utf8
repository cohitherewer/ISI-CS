 Chisty was a treat to watch 

 STAR RACER

 wner MAM Ramaswamys riding brigade had to be content with a solitary win on July 14, the opening day of the season. However, things changed dramatically in the next meeting held on last Friday, thanks to Imran Chisty who took upon himself to make almost a clean sweep of the seven-event card. 

 Chisty won five races and each of his victories ? including the one in the afternoons feature event, the Mica Empress Cup, on the course-favourite, Senor Pele ? was a treat to watch.

 The 4-5 hot-favourite, an eight-year-old, was up against a determined challenge from Robin Corners five-year-old Supreme Power who led from the start but found the Senor Peles challenge too hot to counter in the last 50m of the race. 

 Chistys Regal Empress, in the Alcalde Cup, hardly attracted much support in the betting. The reason being the cruising nine-length victory of the H.S. Bath-trainee, on Day I of the season and punters refused to look beyond the filly. 

 However, Daniels stable had other ideas. It employed a simple strategy of sending the speedster Simply Sensational upfront to disturb the pace of the mare, and it worked. Karans Choice found the final furlong a bit tough after shrugging off the Sensationals challenge rounding the home turn. 

 Errol Bhungards trio of Arabie, Imperial Stride and Cheryl returned convincing winners of their respective events, and in the process completed Chistys big tally. Incidentally, Trainers Daniel and Errol Bhungard were the chief beneficiaries of Chistys efforts. 

 The jockey-trainer combo of Mark Reuben and Javed Khan stopped Chistys Juggernaut from the sixth race onwards. They cleaned off the remaining two races through Alarico and Dancing Vision. 

 Alarico proved a spoilsport for Chistys favourite, Tomahawk, in the Leonidas Handicap. Reuben had the horse settled behind a runaway Corvino and Tomahawk till the home turn and kicked away from the field. Lusitania was a good third in the race. 

 If the Steinbeck-As Ever son won with a degree of comfort, Dancing Visions late run to bury hopes of Corners Elusive Adventure, in the 1,100m Star Flame Handicap, was sensational. The Dancing Beggar-Vision Of Success filly is sure to improve after this win and strike again.

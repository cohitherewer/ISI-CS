 Portugal aiming to reach 66 standard

 - Just as 40 years ago, a Brazilian coach will try to steer the team through 

 Cristiano Ronaldo 

It is not difficult to distinguish similarities between the Portugal teams of 1966 and 2006. For a start, both sides are notable for their mixture of youth and experience, and also for the measured, tactical way in which they approach the game. Perhaps most striking of all, however, is that, just as in England 40 years ago, it will be a Brazilian coach who will be entrusted with steering Portugal through the invariably perilous waters of a Fifa World Cup. 

In the qualifying rounds for the 1966 World Cup and at the finals themselves, Portugal were managed by Otto Gloria, a Brazilian who, though born in Rio de Janeiro, had made his name, both as a coach and a player, in Portugal. It was there, certainly, that he gained a reputation as a master-tactician by winning five league championships and six Cups with Benfica, Belenenses and Sporting Lisbon. 

Gloria, who died in 1986 at the age of 69, just six years after leading Nigeria to glory at the CAF African Cup of Nations, was renowned for his hard-line approach. However, though this strict disciplinarian was often to be seen bawling at his team from the sidelines during training, he was also a connoisseur of attacking football and made a point of giving free rein to his forwards. It is important to point out, however, that while it was Gloria who coached that famous Portugal team of 1966, the starting XI were in fact selected by Manuel da Luz Afonso. 

Again, it is easy to draw comparisons between Gloria and Portugals current coach, Luiz Felipe Scolari. A rugged and demanding former defender and disciplinarian, Scolari ? determined and methodical in equal measure ? is, like his fellow countryman, a born winner. Some even half-joke that Felip? likes to create controversy simply because it gives him an opportunity to answer his critics. 

It was thus during his time as coach of Gremio, and in the face of fall-outs with the press and unrelenting criticism of his ugly, functional football, that he lifted the Copa Libertadores in 1995. Plenty more honours followed, and when his record was recognised by the call to take charge of Brazil, he showed no intentions of adopting a more conciliatory tone. 

Famously, he invoked the wrath of the Sele?? fans by not taking the hugely popular Romario to the finals of Korea-Japan 2002, only to be fully vindicated when, with his attacking trio of Ronaldo, Rivaldo and Ronaldinho in irresistible form, Brazil stormed to their fifth world title. Scolari has not been afraid to make bold decisions in Portugal either, notably when he called up the Brazilian-born midfielder Deco, whose inclusion in the Portuguese fold has proved to be a masterstroke. 

Furthermore, during the qualifying stages for the 1966 Fifa World Cup, Glorias team appeared as conservative as that of Scolari. Grouped with Turkey, Romania and Czechoslovakia, the Portuguese won their first four matches, practically ensuring qualification with games to spare. They were later to draw with Czechoslovakia and lose the final game against Romania, but still finished top of the group to secure their first appearance on the world stage. 

In qualifying for Germany 2006, Portugal also finished comfortably top of their group, even managing to remain unbeaten. The only blemish was a somewhat embarrassing 2-2 draw with lowly Liechtenstein, the principalitys first-ever point in a qualifier, although even Scolaris harshest critics were silenced four days later when Portugal inflicted Russias heaviest defeat since the dissolution of the former Soviet Union, hammering them 7-1. 

Without doubt, the star of the side that secured third place four decades ago was the legendary Benfica striker Eusebio. One of the games all-time greats, he was named player of the tournament in England after finishing as top scorer with nine goals from six games. 

This time around, Portugal are banking on potential match-winning wingers like Figo and Cristiano Ronaldo, coupled with the renowned goalscoring prowess of Paris Saint-Germain striker Pauleta. The link between Pauleta and Eusebio is that the forward from the Azores recently broke his famous predecessors international goalscoring record, an achievement which Eusebio himself took the time to congratulate him on, wishing him good luck for the finals in Germany. 

And the parallels between the two teams do not stop there, with the last likely to be of particular interest to the superstitious. Intrigued? Well, here it is. The only time Portugal made it past the first stage of the World Cup, it was after facing a former colony in the group stage, an event that will repeat itself this summer when they meet Angola. 

It should be acknowledged, however, that the colony defeated in 1966 was none other than Brazil, a considerably more imposing opponent given that the South Americans were going for their third successive world title and boasted such greats as Pele and Garrincha within their all-star ranks. 

History shows that Eusebio and Co recorded a historic victory over the world champions before falling at the semi-final stage to the tournaments eventual winners, England. This raises the question of how far the current team can go at Germany 2006 and, while not everyone agrees that Scolaris men can emulate the team of 66, many believe they can make a significant impact. 

In a recent interview, Figo said: As far as Im concerned, the only really successful outcome would be to win the tournament. We all have high hopes of winning, although it goes without saying that if we reach the last four, then it wont have been a bad tournament for us. 

Scolari has made it clear that even if Portugal were to repeat 1966 by falling at the semi-finals, it would be an achievement of which to be proud.

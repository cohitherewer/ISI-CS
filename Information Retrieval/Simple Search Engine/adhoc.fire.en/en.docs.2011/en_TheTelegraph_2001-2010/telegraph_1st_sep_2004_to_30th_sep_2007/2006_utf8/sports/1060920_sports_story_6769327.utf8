Kuala Lumpur: The countdown to arguably his three toughest days as coach begins Wednesday, but Greg Chappell showed remarkable spirit in the lead-up. 

To make Sundays final of the DLF Cup against the West Indies even if all three teams finish on nine points each, a possibility, Brian Laras men cant be stopped thanks to two wins in their first three matches Team India can actually do without points Wednesday (versus the West Indies), but will have to beat world champions Australia with a bonus one Friday. 

[Nowadays, the highest net run rate is no longer the No.1 criterion for determining the finalists when teams finish on equal points. In that eventuality, the ones with the most number of wins go through. The net run rate comes into play only if the deadlock cant be broken by other means teams with the most number of wins against each other and teams with the highest number of bonus points.] 

Leaving it till the last cant be anybodys preferred choice and, so, a more realistic target would be to beat both the West Indies and Australia. That, perhaps, is easier said than done. It may, of course, become a lot easier if Chappells positive outlook rubs off. 

We dont need the West Indies win over Australia last evening to motivate us... I believe weve got enough motivation of our own, Chappell told The Telegraph on Tuesday. Earlier, interacting with the Media, hed declared: Its a great opportunity for us... We could be in such stages later in the season as well... 

Chappell added: I realise a few players are not at their peak, but also realise all 11 wont be at the same time... Were trying to develop a versatile team, trying to get the best combination for the (2007) World Cup... Im not looking beyond the first match (Wednesday) as one can make mistakes by looking too far ahead. 

When someone pointed out that hed looked upset with Indias batting performance (35 for five) in the first match versus Australia, which got abandoned, Chappell quickly replied: My face may (always) look as if Im upset, but I wasnt so... I was disappointed because of the weather... Weve been facing it from Colombo... 

As for the West Indies, Chappell had this to say: The team has a lot of talent... Any team which has key players performing is bound to do well. Gone are the days of the West Indies have forgotten to win... Incidentally, the Indians have lost five on-the-trot since that comment after the first ODI in the West Indies, four months ago. 

Asked whether the Indians would prefer to set a target, Chappell responded with: Conventional wisdom suggests its better to bat first in a day-night match... Nothing, though, is cast in stone not even Irfan Pathan being sent at No.3. 

The match, by the way, is going to be played on the wicket where a ridge developed last week. Extensive repairs have been done, but its anybodys guess how the surface will behave. The same wicket hosted the first India-West Indies match, which the latter won on the Duckworth/Lewis Method. 

Whether the Indians bat first or end up chasing, an excellent start is essential. In fact, a top reason for the West Indies march to the final has been handsome contributions from the first four. 

The West Indies game plan, according to Dwayne Bravo (recovering from a left wrist injury), is to get Sachin Tendulkar early. The Indians, surely, have plans to quickly snare the explosive Chris Gayle. If he gets away to a flyer, then... 

Its not confirmed, but Rudra Pratap Singh could be dropped and Sreesanth given his first match of the tournament. As for the West Indies, theres talk that Runako Morton is going to make the XI. Lara wants Corey Collymore on the park, but the quicks recovery isnt complete. At least it wasnt till Tuesday evening.

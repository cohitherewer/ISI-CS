 Pawar gets Shukla elected 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Calcutta: The Sharad Pawar group made further inroads into Jagmohan Dalmiya territory East Zone when it got Rajeev Shukla elected as vice-president from the region. 

Shukla, a Rajya Sabha member, is thus back in the post hed held till the last AGM of the Board, when Dalmiya got him replaced by the trusted K.P. Kajaria. 

Dalmiya has been marginalised to such an extent that his nominee Tripuras Arindam Ganguly had to be content with being nominated at the intra-Zone meeting (which preceded Wednesdays AGM) only! 

Ganguly couldnt be propped up on the floor of the House and, so, he withdrew to avoid a contest, a source told The Telegraph from Mumbai. 

The ruling group had moved rather tactically and got one of the contenders, Assams Goutam Roy, to propose Shuklas name. 

Its odd that the UP boss is a vice-president from East, but Dalmiya himself set this precedent not too long ago. 

Incidentally, Rajasthan supremo Lalit Modi is the vice-president from North and not from Central.

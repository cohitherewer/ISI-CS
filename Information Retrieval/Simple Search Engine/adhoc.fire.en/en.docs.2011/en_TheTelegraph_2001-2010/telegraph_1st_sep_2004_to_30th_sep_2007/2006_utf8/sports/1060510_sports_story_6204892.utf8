 Calcutta: A pool of champions 

 from across the continent will vie for the top honour in 

 the inaugural Aamby Valley Asian Masters Golf Championship 

 in India that commences on Thursday. The winner of the four-day 

 meet will carry a purse of $ 400000 at the Aamby Valley 

 Golf Club near Mumbai.

 According to a press release, 

 Amandeep Johl, currently 17th in the Asian Tour Order of 

 Merit, will spearhead the Indian challenge along with Gaurav 

 Ghei, Harmeet Kahlon, Rahil Gangjee and talented youngster 

 like Ashok Kumar. 

 Playing in India is great 

 and with the home support and local cheers, it is definitely 

 an advantage playing on home soil, said Ghei, who 

 was tied fifth in the TCL Classic in China and also posted 

 a top-20 at the Maybank Malaysian Open.

 Leading the international challenge 

 is Terry Pilkadaris of Australia, a three-time Asian Tour 

 winner. Giving Pilkadaris a run for his money will be young 

 talent Chapchai Nirat, who on Sunday tied for fifth at the

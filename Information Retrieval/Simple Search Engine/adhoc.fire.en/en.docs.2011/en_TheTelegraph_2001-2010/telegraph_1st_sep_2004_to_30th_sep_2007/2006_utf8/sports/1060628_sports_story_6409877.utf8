 Germans adopt go for goal mantra

Augsburg: Many of the top teams at the World Cup have abandoned safety-first soccer and gone for goals, but none have done it with quite the style and flair of host nation Germany. 

German coach Juergen Klinsmann, who netted 47 goals in his international career, has transferred his talent for scoring into an attacking philosophy for his team. 

He has given free rein to twin strikers Lukas Podolski and Miroslav Klose to go for goals and they have rewarded his faith with seven of Germanys 10 goals so far. 

Klinsmanns belief in a 4-4-2 system based on fast, aggressive, attacking football and his courage in following the style of teams like European champions Barcelona is paying off. 

On Friday, Germany meet Argentina in a quarter final meeting to savour between the tournaments top-scoring sides. Goals look to be guaranteed. Argentina, like Germany, play with two central strikers in Hernan Crespo and Javier Saviola and they have also hit 10 in total. (Reuters)

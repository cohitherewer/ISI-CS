 Court rejects Dalmiya application

OUR LEGAL REPORTER

Calcutta: Chief judge of the city civil court P.K. Sarkar on Friday rejected the application moved by Jagmohan Dalmiya, seeking a court order on asking the BCCI to hand over the legible documents of the Pilcom account before the CAB president has to appear before the disciplinary committee. 

Dalmiyas counsel Gitanath Ganguli submitted: The 273 documents supplied to my client by the BCCI are illegible. He needs to be supplied with fresh documents before he can respond to the allegations. 

BCCI counsel S.K. Kapoor, in reply, said, the original copy of the vouchers are lying with Dalmiya. During his tenure he had supplied photocopies of the vouchers and held back the originals. 

Hearing both the sides, the court passed Fridays order.

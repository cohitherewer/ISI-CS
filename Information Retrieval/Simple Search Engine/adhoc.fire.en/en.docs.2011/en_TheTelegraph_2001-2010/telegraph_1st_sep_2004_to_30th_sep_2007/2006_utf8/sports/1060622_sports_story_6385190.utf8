 Team India face selection dilemma

Basseterre: Under fire for their skewed selection policy in the first two matches, India were grappling with their bowling combination as they seek to break the series deadlock and go 1-0 up in the third Test against the West Indies starting here on Thursday. 

Riled much by former cricketers back home for missing an extra bowler in the preceding two Tests, the Indian team management is choosing defiance over common sense ahead of the crucial encounter. 

Coach Greg Chappell began the tour as a promoter of five-bowler theory but by now is asserting that he wants to make sure his batsmen make big runs to pressurise the opposition, never mind if it is only four men manning the attack. 

Captain Rahul Dravid is singing the same tune and swearing by four bowlers who nearly did the job in the last game. He is taking a lot of heart from how Virender Sehwag bowled in the last Test in St Lucia. 

While Team India did everything but pull the noose in the first two games, they probably missed off-spinner Harbhajan Singh in the attack. Chris Gayle, Brian Lara and Shivnarine Chanderpaul are all left-handers and could have found Harbhajan a greater challenge than Sehwag, however promising he might have been in the first two Tests. 

The pitch, which sported some green tinge in the centre, would also be a factor in the decision over the team combination. 

ICCs pitch expert Andy Atkinson was specially flown in at the instance of home captain Lara, who wanted a seamer-friendly wicket to contain the in-form Indian batsmen. 

But Atkinson was convinced the track would have nothing for the bowlers except for a bit of bounce. 

The dilemma of Indian thinktank certainly has kept the likes of Yuvraj Singh and V.V.S. Laxman on the edge and they must await an official word which could either confirm their worst fears or bring them relief. 

The logic of playing only five specialist batsmen is difficult to gloss over especially since Wasim Jaffer, Sehwag, Dravid and Mohammed Kaif have all hit centuries in the present series. But India would be making a mistake by thinking that the likes of Gayle, Chanderpaul and Sarwan could fail one another time. 

Lara would be chastened by his recent experience with the selectors. He was saddled with the same set of bowlers even as he went public to ask for a fast bowler of his liking. 

He still is likely to favour Marlon Samuels ahead of opener Daren Ganga in the squad as the former is also a useful customer with his off-spinners. 

The weather isnt too promising, though the locals aver it is impossible to predict correct weather for the island. 

According to one observation, the first three days of the Test would see a lot of grey and black clouds but it actually wouldnt be so threatening. But there is a bigger threat of rain on the final two days. 

 More joins squad 

Chairman of selectors Kiran More has joined Team India in the West Indies on Tuesday, adding spice to the debate over four or five-bowler theory ahead of the Test. 

More replaced South Zone representative V.B. Chandrasekhar, who was with the team during the first two Tests. 

The trio of More, Dravid and Chappell will decide the XI.

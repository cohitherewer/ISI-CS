 Not biased: ICC

Kuala Lumpur: The ICC is offended by claims that it is biased against Asian countries, chief executive Malcolm Speed said on Saturday. Speed stressed instead that the Indian subcontinent is crickets unique selling point. 

The ICC is sometimes criticised, and we read this from time to time and we get very offended by it, that we are biased against Asia and somehow we are alleged to be racist, he said on Saturday. (Reuters)

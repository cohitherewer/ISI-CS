 Chetan, Sridhar up

 Singapore Open

 New Delhi: World No. 20 

 Chetan Anand and national champion Anup Sridhar survived 

 gruelling encounters before making it to the second round 

 of the mens singles in the $170,000 Singapore Open 

 Badminton Championships.

 According to information received 

 here, the Indians had a mixed day at office on the opening 

 day of the five-star event as P. Kashyap and J. B. S. Vidyadhar 

 also moved to the second round, but Arvind Bhat and Anand 

 Pawar tripped at the very first hurdle.

 Anand, seeded 13th, rallied after 

 being one game down against Sheng-Shium Liao of Chinese 

 Taipei to post a 23-25, 21-9, 21-13 win in 47 minutes. The 

 top-ranked Indian shuttler next meets Jean Micjel Lefort 

 of France in the second round of the 64-player draw. (PTI)

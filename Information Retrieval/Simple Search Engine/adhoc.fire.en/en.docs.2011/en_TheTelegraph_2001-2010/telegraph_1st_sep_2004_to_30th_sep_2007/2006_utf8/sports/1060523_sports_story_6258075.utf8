 New Delhi: Two 

 of the four foreign coaches to be interviewed on May 24 

 for the post of national football coach are likely to arrive 

 in the Capital on Tuesday morning under a veil of secrecy 

 as the All India Football Federation (AIFF) refused to identify 

 the duo. 

 While the AIFF general secretary, Alberto Colaco said 

 he would only reveal the names on Tuesday evening, sources 

 said that Englands Bob Houghton and Brian Kerr of 

 Ireland are the two who will be here to meet the federation 

 officials. While Kerr is a former manager of the Republic 

 of Ireland national team, Houghton was the manager of the 

 Chinese national team for four years between 1997 and 2000. 

The schedule of other two coaches ? Ian Porterfield and Clemance Westerhoff ? is still not known and one of them is yet to confirm his participation in the interview. 

Colaco, however, made it clear that the interview will be held for the post of chief coach and not the technical director. We wanted to combine both the posts, but Fifa wants it to be separated. The present process will be to select the chief coach. About appointing a technical director, we will take a decision later. 

Asked what procedure will be followed during the course of the interview, the AIFF secretary said the coaches will be asked to table their plans and programmes in front of the technical committee and other senior AIFF officials. It will not be a bad idea if they plan to make a presentation on their own on the subject, he said. 

While the AIFF president Priya Ranjan Das Munshi and Colaco will be there in the meeting, the entire technical committee has been asked to be present here on May 23 evening. However, two of the six-member committee ? Nagendran and Inder Singh ? may not remain present due to personal reasons. 

 Meanwhile, Colaco said that the ONGC Super Cup match 

 between National Football League champions Mahindra United 

 and East Bengal will be played in Mumbai on May 27. The 

 prize money entitled to both the teams will be distributed 

 on the same day.

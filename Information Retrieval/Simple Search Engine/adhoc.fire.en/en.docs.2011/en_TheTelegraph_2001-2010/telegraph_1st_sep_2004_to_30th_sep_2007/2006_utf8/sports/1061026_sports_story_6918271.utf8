 Dravid hopes top-order regains form 

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Ahmedabad: Rahul Dravid on Tuesday said that the team has worked hard on its batting and expected that the top-order would regain their scoring touch. 

Its really about your key players bouncing back at the right time, Dravid told a news conference on Wednesday. 

Weve been working on staying at the wicket, ensuring that we build partnerships. The tournament has not been very easy on batsmen. Seen from a different perspective, you realise that were not the only team that goes through ups and downs Its, in fact, the nature of the game. 

It was clear from Dravids words that they were taking the West Indies seriously. 

I saw a fair bit of the Australia-West Indies game and I think theyre bowling well... The Windies are going through a period where they seem to have found some of their key players in form. 

I think we were not very far from that. There are a couple of areas we can get better at. We can get back to that kind of consistency and performance we showed a little while back. Its just a question of a few more players getting back into the kind of groove they can. The pieces are falling into place, Team India captain pointed out. 

Dravid also informed that though Sachin Tendulkar has been bowling regularly at nets, there were no plans to rush him as a bowler in the match. 

Brian Lara was hoping his team continued with the winning habit. 

Our record against India has been impressive and we see it as a psychological advantage. The crowd will be supportive of India but it is these conditions that will show the real mettle of a team. The guys are fully aware of that. 

Lara hoped that beating India on Thursday would give his team an even bigger boost. If things go well in the World Cup we are going to meet India in a very crucial stage in the second round... The win here will augur well for the future, the Trinidadian said.

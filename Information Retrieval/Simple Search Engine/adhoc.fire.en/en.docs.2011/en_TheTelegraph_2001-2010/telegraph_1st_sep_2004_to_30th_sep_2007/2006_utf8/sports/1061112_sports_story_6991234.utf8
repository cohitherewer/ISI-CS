The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 A bit of pressure doesnt hurt anybody, says Dr Ashraf

 - I know Im in a high profile seat, but I want the powers and perks of the PCB chairman to be reduced 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Dr Ashraf at his first Media conference, after Younis agreed to lead in the Champions Trophy 

Widely regarded as being close to President Pervez Musharraf, Dr Nasim Ashraf got the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairmanship at a time of considerable turmoil, early last month. Yet, the 56-year-old nephrologist (who enjoys the rank of minister of state by virtue of heading a national commission), hasnt shied away from bold decisions. 

Dr Ashraf, who was in Mumbai with wife Aseela and youngest daughter Humaira for an International Cricket Council (ICC) meeting, spoke to The Telegraph there a few days ago. 

The following are excerpts from the 30-minute one-on-one (incidentally, one-time allrounder Dr Ashrafs first to any Indian publication): 

Q What was your reaction on being told you would take over from Shaharyar Khan? 

A I was in a hospital in Peshawar, where my father had been admitted, when the call came from Islamabad I felt honoured, but made the point I should have the time to continue with my main work being chairman of the National Commission for Human Development. Thats my passion. 

Did President Musharraf telephone in person? 

His chief of staff did, saying the President had decided I would head the PCB. 

Youd been a member of the ad hoc committee, so you arent exactly on unfamiliar territory 

Well, yes 

Your first action was to give the captaincy (for the Champions Trophy) back to Younis Khan. Was it easy taking such a big decision? 

(Smiles) I had to do it for the country Had to get the team united As the boys were about to leave for India, I rushed to Lahore and met Mohammed Yousuf before interacting with anybody else. 

What did Yousuf, captain for just a day, say? 

Yousuf was very gracious and declared that he played for the country and not for personal goals... He added he wouldnt have a problem playing under Younis and left the (captaincy) decision to me. I hugged him and said hed met my expectations. After that, I spoke to Younis. I didnt really have to convince him to take back the captaincy. 

A shade over a week later came the doping scandal featuring Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Asif. Were you tempted to withhold the damning reports? 

There are occasions in life when (hard) decisions have to be taken Only, they ought to be on merit The PCB had, on its own, sent the samples of 19 players for testing. So, wheres the question of even thinking about hushing it up? When I got the news, all I asked for is that the reports must be reconfirmed. I wanted the samples re-run Being a doctor and having dealt with lab tests, I wanted to be absolutely sure As the weekend came in between, the reconfirmation came on Monday (October 16) morning. The decision to suspend the duo and recall them was taken within half-an-hour I believe in playing straight Thats the best policy. (After a pause) Weve decided, by the way, to have more effective communication with the players on the issue of banned drugs. 

The Anti-Doping Commission acted fast in banning the spearheads and youve quickly appointed a tribunal to hear the appeals 

Procedures are being followed Justice (retd) Fakhruddin Ebrahim, a former Sindh governor with immense credibility, is on the panel. As is Haseeb Ahsan, former Test player, selection committee chairman and manager He has an independent mind and, more often than not, is critical of the PCB. The Commission, you may recall, included Intikhab Alam I dont need to elaborate on his stature. 

Right now, whats the PCBs stand? 

Both Shoaib and Asif are claiming to be innocent. They should prove that before the tribunal They cant say the PCB didnt give them the opportunity. 

Moving away from the doping scandal Havent you put Inzamam-ul Haq under pressure by saying that the captaincy will be reviewed after the West Indies series? 

A bit of pressure doesnt hurt anybody It had been decided during my predecessors tenure itself that Inzamam would be captain till the end of the year and there would be a review of form and fitness after that I havent stated anything new In fact, I personally told Inzamam that nobody was out to remove him, but the earlier arrangement would stand Whatever ones field of activity, performance (alone) counts... Of course, I accept Inzamams record as captain is pretty good. 

Youve started a dialogue with the England amp; Wales Cricket Board to sort out its compensation claim following the forfeiture of The Oval Test 

Yes, but I wouldnt like to go into specifics at this point in time. Suffice to say that the PCB doesnt owe anybody any money. Ive put it on record... I accept England is an aggrieved party, but even were an aggrieved party. We didnt want to forfeit that Test It wasnt our fault Chief Match Referee Ranjan Madugalles report to the ICC has categorically said that (umpire) Darrell Hair didnt take all the steps to ensure the game resumed and didnt make Pakistan understand that the Test would otherwise be forfeited. 

[Subsequently, there have been reports that the PCB has offered to play a one-dayer in England next summer.] 

Whats it like being in a seat which is arguably as hot as the captains? 

(Laughs) I know Im in a high profile seat, but I want the powers and perks of the PCB chairman to be reduced Ive already delegated responsibility to colleagues and I want corporate governance. Ive assigned a leading head-hunting firm to help get us the best possible chief executive. 

Its unusual for an office-holder to call for his perks and powers to be reduced 

But thats what I feel I dont want the PCB to be a one- man show. An institution must not be run that way. 

When is the PCB going to be governed by a constitution? 

The draft has been sent to the patron-in-chief (President Musharraf). Inputs have been taken from all stakeholders, including the Media I expect a response within a month. 

Youve played first-class cricket 

In 1969, I even played for the Pakistan colts Opener Graham Barlow was one of my victims (out first ball) when the England U-19 team came on tour That side, I remember, included Bob Willis. (After a pause) My maternal grand-father, Lala Karim Buksh (a contemporary of Lala Amarnath), introduced cricket in the North West Frontier Province and I actually grew up sitting on the laps of Test players. 

Finally, who has been your favourite? 

Sir Garfield Sobers As for leadership, Imran Khan was unbelievable.

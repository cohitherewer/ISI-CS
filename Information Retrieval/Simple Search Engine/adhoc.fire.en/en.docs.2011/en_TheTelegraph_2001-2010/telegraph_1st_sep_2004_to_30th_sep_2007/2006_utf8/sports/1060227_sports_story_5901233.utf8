London: Manchester United outplayed an overawed Wigan Athletic to win the English League Cup final 4-0 on Sunday, with England striker Wayne Rooney scoring twice. 

Man of the match Rooney scored after 33 and 61 minutes after hitting the bar with a header early in the first half. 

Louis Saha, with his sixth goal in the competition, and winger Cristiano Ronaldo also netted in a blistering six-minute spell in the second half which guaranteed United manager Alex Ferguson the 27th major honour of his career. 

United, whose only previous League Cup win came in 1992, dominated from start to finish and were never seriously troubled by Wigan, appearing in the first major final in the clubs history in their first season in the top flight. 

The win was the biggest in the final since it was switched from two legs in 1967 and guarantees second-placed United a place in next seasons Uefa Cup if they should finish outside the Champions League qualifying places in the Premier League. 

The Wigan players seemed to freeze on the biggest day in their clubs history under the closed roof at the Millennium Stadium. 

The match produced a familiar outcome for Wigan manager Paul Jewell ? he has now faced United four times as a manager, twice with Bradford City and twice with Wigan ? and lost 0-4 each time. 

However in the Premier League, Liverpool kept the pressure on Manchester United in the race for second place with a 1-0 Anfield win over Manchester City on Sunday. 

Liverpool moved alongside them on 54 points, albeit from a game more. Leaders Chelsea, who beat Portsmouth 2-0 on Saturday, are 15 points clear. 

Liverpool were on top for most of the game but the only goal came five minutes before halftime when England midfielder Steven Gerrard showed fine control in midfield before releasing Harry Kewell, the Australian sprinting away to fire past David James. 

Meanwhile in Madrid, late goals from Ronaldinho and Henrik Larsson gave Barcelona a hard-earned 2-0 win over Real Zaragoza on Saturday as they extended their lead to nine points in the Primera Liga. 

The Brazilian broke the deadlock in a delicately balanced contest when he converted a penalty after Zaragoza midfielder Albert Celades was sent off 10 minutes from time for stopping a goal-bound shot on the line with his hand. 

Swedish striker Larsson made sure of the victory two minutes later when he steered in from close range after a great cross by Samuel Eto. 

The Cameroon striker had tried to leave the pitch a few minutes earlier after being subjected to racial abuse from the home fans, but was persuaded to continue playing by his teammates and Barca coach Frank Rijkaard. 

Referee Victor Esquinas Torres stopped the game in the second half to ask for an announcement over the public address system to call a halt to the abuse and Eto tried to leave the pitch, appearing to say he had had enough of the insults. 

Earlier on Saturday, Atletico Madrid continued their impressive form under new coach Pepe Murcia when they stretched their winning run to six matches with the 5-0 demolition of Malaga. 

Atletico roared into a 2-0 lead inside 10 minutes thanks to a double from striker Fernando Torres, and Maxi Rodriguez added a third when he ghosted in at the far post just before the break. 

The fourth came via substitute Juan Valera scoring the goal of the night when he blasted a 25-metre drive into the top corner a minute after stepping on to the pitch midway through the second half. 

Malaga were reduced to 10 men when Portuguese midfielder Duda was red carded 12 minutes from time and Valera took advantage to head home a fifth goal in the final minute.

 - Womens World Boxing 

 Merykom will meet North Korean Jong 

New Delhi: MC Merykom battled off the affects of cold and cough on Tuesday to cross the first hurdle in her quest for a hattrick of titles in fourth World Womens Boxing Championships. While the Indians assured themselves eight medals by entering the semi-finals of as many weight categories on day four here on Tuesday. 

Merykom, the two-time champion from Manipur, crushed Sri Lankas Chandrika Guruge in the 46kg quarter final by referee stopped the contest (RSC-OS II) verdict in second round of the bout to advance to the semi-finals. 

Among other Indians, Chhotu Loura (48kg), Sarita Devi (52kg) and Negisatty Usha (57kg), Jenny RL (63kg), Lekha KC (75kg) and Renu (80kg) also moved into the last four stage while Kalpana Chowdhary made an exit in the 48kg division at the Talkatora Indoor Stadium. 

Aruna Mishra was the first Indian to book herself a semi-final berth on Monday. 

Merykom, although a shadow of herself, was good enough for her opponent whom she had thrashed also in the Asian championships quarter finals in Taiwan. 

The diminutive pugilist pounded combination of punches not leaving much room for Chandrika to score and was 13-3 ahead in the first round. Chandrika countered Merykom to score only one point against her six in the second round but the Indian had already outscored to be declared winner in the first bout of the day. 

I did not fight well today because I was not well. I have cold and cough and am suffering from a mild fever too. I could not take medicine also because of the dope test. 

In a rematch of last years final, Merykom will take on North Koreas Jong Ok, who defeated Gnevanova Svetlana of Russia 17-9 in another lightfly bout. (PTI)

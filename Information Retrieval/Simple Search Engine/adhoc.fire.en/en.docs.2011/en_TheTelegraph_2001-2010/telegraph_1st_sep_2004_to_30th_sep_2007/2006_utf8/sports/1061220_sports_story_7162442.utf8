 Dalmiya refuses to quit CAB presidency

 - I have been denied natural justice 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Former BCCI president Jagmohan Dalmiya on Tuesday said his expulsion from the Board was through an unfair trial and that he was denied natural justice. While making it clear that he has no intentions of resigning as CAB president, the former BCCI chief challenged the legality and validity of Rule 38 (V) of the constitution, claiming it was not registered under the Societies Registration Act. 

There is no question of my resigning from the post of CAB president at the moment. The 38 (V) amendment, as per which it is claimed that I cannot hold any post in any affiliate association, is an illegal and unregistered rule The Rule was amended in September 2000. As per the laws, any amendment to the Rules would have to be approved by the Registrar of Societies within six months. Till date, the Registrar has not approved the said rule. 

The BCCI secretary had written to the Registrar in February this year, but the Registrar has not accepted it Therefore legal opinion is that since the Rule is not there, why should it be applicable? Dalmiya told a press conference. 

He made it clear that the legal recourse was the only option left to him and that he was working out the details with his lawyers. 

Asked if the CAB and the NCC would write to the BCCI underlining that they still regarded him as their president, Dalmiya said: Lets see what happens. We will discuss it at our meetings. 

Dalmiya denied that he had refused to appear before the three-member disciplinary committee of the BCCI. Thats their understanding. And, understanding is a relative word. Only once they called me. But I wrote to them on October 25 saying its members were biased, and its term was also over as per rules, when the process of adjudication should have been completed in six months. 

I had also said the committee could not run parallel proceedings as criminal proceedings were initiated against me earlier this year on the same set of allegations, he said. 

On the voting at the SGM in Jaipur, Dalmiya said: Fairness demands that such issues be put through secret ballot, and unfortunately, it wasnt done. 

On allegations that he had misappropriated Pilcom funds during the 1996 World Cup, he said: Everyone is wondering what were the actual figures. It started off with Rs 21.74 lakh and went up to Rs 48 crore. As per the disciplinary committee, the total amount has come down to Rs 8.98 crore. Dalmiya also informed that the BCCIs auditors had never raised any objection to the transactions.

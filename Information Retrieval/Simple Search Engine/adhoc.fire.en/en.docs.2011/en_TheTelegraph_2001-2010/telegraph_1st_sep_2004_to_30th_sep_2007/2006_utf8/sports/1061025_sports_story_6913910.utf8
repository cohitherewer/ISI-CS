 Smith: There was some extra motivation

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Ahmedabad: Graeme Smith felt that there was some extra motivation going into Tuesdays clash against Pakistan and that helped the adrenaline to flow. 

There were some nasty things said about our players when we were in Sri Lanka last The guys were just pumped up and wanted to prove a point. I am happy we played good cricket, Smith said, referring to the Lankan media which had touted them as chickens after they called off the tour midway through the tri-series. 

Smith was happy that his plans clicked on Tuesday. Our gameplan was to knock off their top-order early and put the pressure on the middle-order. It paid off Because of the do-or-die situation there was also some extra motivation among the players to prove things. 

I thought it was a good wicket to chase 220 wasnt a good score. We had set the first 15 overs as our target to knock out the Lankans. Once that happened, we managed to keep the pressure on, Smith remarked. 

The South African captain said it was pre-decided to bowl Man-of-the-Match Shaun Pollock through his ten overs. We had decided to use him before the dew set in. Good that we managed to make more inroads during that period. 

The Mahela run out was crucial for usWe do need to get runs at the top of the order. The game against Pakistan on Friday is a massive one and we have keep the momentum going. 

Pollock, who finished with 10-2-21-2, said: Ntini and I did well We stuck to our task and complemented each other I thought the last few runs we managed helped us set a competitive score. We will take lot of confidence from this game going into Mohali. 

Mahela Jayawardene blamed their inept batting for the defeat. My run out was unfortunate. We lost wickets at regular intervals and never got the momentum needed. Our batsmen didnt take responsibilities. They definitely bowled and fielded well and kept the pressure going. 

 Kallis injury 

Jacques Kallis, who slipped and fell while taking a second run during his innings on Tuesday, has a sprain on his right ankle. He is expected to be fit for Fridays match.

 Randhawa, Kapur struggle

St Andrews: Shiv Kapur and Jyoti Randhawa continued to struggle in the Alfred Dunhill Links Golf Championship, finishing tied 118th and 156th respectively after Round II. 

They play a third one before the cut is applied, but things look tough for both of them. Kapur shot an even par 72 and Randhawa also shot a 72, but with his first round 77, he found himself further down the leaderboard. 

Among other Asians, Thailands Thongchai Jaidee was in joint 58th position after a 70, while Scott Strange of Australia scored a 70 in 129th place alongside compatriot Terry Pilkadaris who carded a 72. 

Bradley Dredge kept his lead following his course-record opening round at St Andrews with an impressive four under par 67 at Carnoustie to take a two-shot lead. 

The Welshman, who won the European Masters last month, braved the squalls which swept to lead South African Charl Schwartzel, whose 67 at St Andrews took him to ten under par, and Swede Johan Edfors, also on ten under after a 70 at the home of golf. 

Irelands Padraig Harrington, the 2002 champion, moved into a share of fourth place on nine under par after a three under 69 at St Andrews. 

World No.5 Vijai Singh is on the same mark following a 70, along with Englands Simon Dyson, whose 68 at Kingsbarns maintained his position among the leaders.

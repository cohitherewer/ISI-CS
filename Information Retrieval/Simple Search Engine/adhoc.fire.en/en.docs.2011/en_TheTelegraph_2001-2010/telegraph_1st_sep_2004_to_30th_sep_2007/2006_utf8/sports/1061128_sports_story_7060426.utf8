The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Still feel

 India are in deep trouble. They 

 did too many things wrong in Newlands: batting, bowling 

 or fielding.If an opposition cannot be put away from a position 

 in which India was in, then hopes recede faster than the 

 sum in your wallet in a club. This spells big time trouble.

 Sure, the lost chances in the 

 field will be mulled over for a while. There were as many 

 as three lives afforded to key South African batsmen Justin 

 Kemp included.

 This is not just your ability 

 with bat and ball failing you in testing conditions: it 

 is a major negation of even ordinary skills which most of 

 us cricketers possess at all times. 

 There are too many pieces on the 

 floor for India to pick up and rearrange in the thick of 

 battle. The wind is too strong and the foothold too skewed, 

 Im afraid.

 You can meet as many times as 

 you want in the hotel; have as many meetings as you can 

 possibly squeeze in; hold as many video analyses as you 

 humanly can; hold up coach or captain for your ills, but 

 the basic surge has got to come from the men in the squad. 

 It is they who form the muscles, 

 sinews and bones of a teams form. There simply are 

 too many failures for any single individual to be held responsible. 

 The buck stops with them.

 I have spoken to a few distinguished 

 old-timers of Indian cricket in recent days and most of 

 them are unanimous that there is not a good enough core 

 of talented cricketers in the land. They all speak of a 

 core group of 15-18 cricketers and then the list runs out. 

 It is thus a difficult choice for selectors: whether to 

 lay off those who are not measuring up and replace them 

 with some little known names.

 Wholesome replacements have never 

 been the answer. I know fans and media back home are unforgiving 

 and it is big-time trouble leading up to the World Cup, 

 but pulling these men out of the fray at this juncture is 

 not going to help.

 Every time I speak in support 

 of the visitors, the voice sounds shriller and lost in the 

 din of criticism but I still feel this Indian team can turn 

 things around. They can work on South African batting and 

 build on the advantage that they have over the top order.

 In both games, India have been 

 good with the new ball and have made early inroads. They 

 would like to believe that they have got the measure of 

 the home captain and a few other batters in the line-up.

 It is a good starting point, the 

 window of light, which should offer them energy and hope. 

 They must push on from this basic premise, gather forces 

 at this cape of reasonable stability. Otherwise, such defeats 

 would have a knock-on effect on Tests as well.

 They could also look to scratch 

 at the disquiet in the home camp over team selection prior 

 to the Newlands game and see if the hurt runs deeper than 

 a mere matter of Andre Nels exclusion. I am not sure 

 if it was annoyance before the game that cost Graeme Smith 

 his wicket, but he sure had smoke coming out of his ears.

 The home top order, Smith including, 

 was once again exposed and looked vulnerable. They sure 

 have work to do.

 The return of Anil Kumble to one-day 

 bowling crease was in line with expectations: he was miserly 

 and in complete control during his 10 overs. That he came 

 in at No. 11 and looked laboured in the outfield is a concern 

 that must take a backseat for now.

 India must look to maximise its 

 potential rather than look at the perfect picture. They 

 have to draw on every ounce of positive strength if they 

 are to be counted on this tour.

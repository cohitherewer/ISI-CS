 Atwal lies tied 82nd

Houston: A topsy-turvy round with four birdies, three bogeys and a double bogey highlighted Arjun Atwals continuing problems on the USPGA Tour, as his one-over 71 in the first round of the Valero Texas Open saw him lying tied 82nd. 

Faced with the danger of yet another missed cut, Atwal will need a solid second round to make the weekend. 

The Indian golfer started on the 10th and had a birdie on 11th, followed by two back-to-back bogeys on 12th and 13th. 

Germanys Alex Cejka and Briton Justin Rose shared the lead after shooting six-under-par 64 each. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Soma Biswas threatens to quit Bengal

 - Heptathlete slams state govt, local association 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Soma 

Doha: A day after winning the silver medal in heptathlon, Soma Biswas said that she will not hesitate to represent any other state in the national championships if she does not receive enough recognition in Bengal. 

The problem in Bengal is that neither the local association nor the state government has any laid down policy to reward its successful sportspersons, said the double Asian Games gold medallist. 

In other states, both the government and the association offer handsome awards for winning medals even at the national level. Here, all we get are receptions. That is not going to help us in future. 

Soma said she would not mind representing Assam in the National Games in Guwahati. If the offer is good, I am ready to go. As it is I am a railway employee. In inter-state meets, I can participate for any state. 

Soma, who is set to get married next April, said she would like to compete in the next Olympics. In an event like heptathlon, one can continue well after 30 years. I have already won two Asian Games. So, I can make an attempt in the Olympics, she said. 

Since Saturday night, Soma said, she has been flooded with phone calls from back home and from well wishers. All my fellow athletes had also come to congratulate me. My ticket for Calcutta is booked for the 16th, but I am trying to get one for an earlier date, said Soma.

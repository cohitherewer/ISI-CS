 Fresh flak for rule changes

London: Tyre supplier Michelin has voiced fresh criticism of rule changes on the eve of what will be the French companys farewell season in Formula One. 

Although the rules were changed in a bid to reduce costs, it is disappointing that a tyre manufacturer such as Michelin will have to carry 38 per cent more stock to Grands Prix this season than it did in 2005, the companys Formula One director Nick Shorrock said on Monday. (Reuters)

 Federer-Nadal final 

 - Nalbandian quits with abdominal strain 

Paris: Roger Federer overcame a dismal start on Friday to earn his first berth in a French Open final when David Nalbandian retired with an injury in the third set. 

Now all he has to do is beat Rafael Nadal. 

The top-ranked Federers 27 consecutive wins in Grand Slam matches, and defending champion Nadals record 59 wins in a row on clay. 

To play in our first Grand Slam final against each other, I think thats quite special, you know, No. 1 and No. 2 in the world, Federer said. 

 The last time Nos. 1 and 2 met for the mens title at Roland Garros was in 1984, when Ivan Lendl beat John McEnroe. 

 The marquee matchup briefly appeared in jeopardy. Down one set and 3-0 in the second, Federer rallied and led 3-6, 6-4, 5-2 when No. 3-seeded David Nalbandian retired with an injured abdominal muscle. 

Nadal advanced in more straightforward fashion against No. 4 Ivan Ljubicic but took two hours, 49 minutes to win 6-4, 6-2, 7-6 (9-7). 

 If Federer wins the championship, he would become only the third man to hold all four Grand Slam titles at the same time, joining Don Budge and Rod Laver. He would also become the sixth man to achieve a career Slam by winning all four majors. 

 But hes 1-5 against Nadal with four consecutive losses, including a defeat a year ago in the French Open semi-finals. Nadal is 13-0 at Roland Garros, and 23-0 this year on clay. 

Justine Henin-Hardenne will bid for her third Roland Garros title Saturday against Svetlana Kuznetsova, who will play in her first Grand Slam final since winning the 2004 US Open.

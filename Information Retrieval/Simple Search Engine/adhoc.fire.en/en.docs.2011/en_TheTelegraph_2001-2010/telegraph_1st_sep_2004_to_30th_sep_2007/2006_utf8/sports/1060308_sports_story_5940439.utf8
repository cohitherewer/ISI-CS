 Waqar reiterates long-term deal demand

Karachi: Former captain Waqar Younis has reiterated that he would take up the assignment of bowling coach only on a long-term basis, after media reports suggested he was likely to get the job ahead of Pakistans tour of Sri Lanka this month. 

I had a meeting with PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan on Tuesday in which I have informed him that I was more than interested to work as bowling coach. 

But at the same time I made it clear that I want the contract until next years World Cup, Younis, who had called for a long-term contract when talks of his being the bowling coach first surfaced in February last year, said. 

Earlier, a Pakistani daily reported that chairman Shaharyar Khan and director, cricket operations, Saleem Altaf, have reached a consensus on appointing former captain Zaheer Abbas as manager and Younis as the bowling coach for the Lanka tour. 

Waqar is demanding too much for a 12-month contract,a PCB insider said.

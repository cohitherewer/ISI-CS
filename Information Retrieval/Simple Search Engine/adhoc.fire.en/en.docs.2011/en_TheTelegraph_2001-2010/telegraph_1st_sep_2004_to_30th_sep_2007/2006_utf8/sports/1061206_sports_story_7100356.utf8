Udine: Italy forwards Vincenzo Iaquinta and David Di Michele were among 21 players identified by prosecutors for involvement in an illegal betting ring, media reports said on Tuesday.

Other players allegedly involved include goalkeeper Zeljko Kalac and midfielder Marek Jankulovski of AC Milan. 

Iaquinta and other players have denied any wrongdoing.

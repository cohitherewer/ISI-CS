The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Well play hard, says Harbhajan

 India in WI

 London: Off-spinner Harbhajan 

 Singh on Saturday expressed confidence that the Indian team 

 would continue their recent good form in the West Indies 

 and backed Rahul Dravids side to win a Test series 

 in the Caribbean for the first time since 1971.

 If we stick to our plans 

 and what weve been doing for the last 10 months or 

 so, we will do very well, Harbhajan told a radio channel.

 Its a big tour for 

 us, hopefully well play hard and positive cricket, 

 keep up the good work and win the series over there, 

 he said.

 Weve been building 

 a team for the World Cup and weve been playing some 

 good cricket, he added. Harbhajan hoped that Sachin 

 Tendulkar would soon make a return to the Indian team.

 Harbhajan believes that the five-match 

 one-day series, which will be played before the four Test 

 matches, could give him a chance to recover in time.

 We would love to have Sachin 

 back in the team as soon as we can. We know he can win matches 

 on his own.

 Greg calls for same intensity over five days 

 - Final Test 

Kingston: India coach Greg Chappell says India should be able to finish up in front for a historic series win in the Caribbean if the players can sustain the intensity on all the five days of the fourth and final Test beginning at the Sabina Park on Friday. 

We hope that we can keep playing some good cricket and if we keep doing that, then at some stage rather we might finish-up in front, but obviously as weve seen in the three Test matches so far, youve got to be able to play good cricket for five days and if we can do that well give ourselves a good chance, Chappell said. 

The Australian great said he had no complaints with the teams performance so far. 

Not at all, Ive been more than happy with their performances so far, we just havent been able to finish it off, he was quoted as saying in a Jamaican newspaper. 

Chappell said his side had a chance to take lead in the second Test but an inclement weather put paid on their chances. 

Probably the main reason for that was the loss of a day in the second Test, otherwise I think wed probably would have been in front of the series, but it wasnt to be and weve got to make sure we can play over the five days at Sabina Park, he added. 

West Indian captain Brian Lara has set his eyes on winning the final Test against India, saying the improved performance in the last match will give his team the confidence to topple their higher ranked opponents in the decider. 

I think its important that this match does not end in a draw as well, Lara said. 

To play four Test matches and end up with four drawn Test matches, it would be disappointing. So I would really like to see the skill levels of the players both in batting and bowling and hopefully well have a good Test match, he said on arrival at the Norman Manley International. 

India and West Indies have drawn the first three matches and will have it all to play for when the final match of their four-Test series begins at the Sabina Park. (Agencies)

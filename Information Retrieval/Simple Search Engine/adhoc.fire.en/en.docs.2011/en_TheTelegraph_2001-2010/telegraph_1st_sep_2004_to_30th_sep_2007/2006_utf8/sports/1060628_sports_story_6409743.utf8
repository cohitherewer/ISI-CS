 Ivanov: It was my toughest match

 Moscow: Russian referee Valentin Ivanov said 

 the stormy World Cup match between Portugal and The Netherlands 

 was the most difficult of his professional career.

 Ivanov has been under fire for his performance in 

 Sundays second-round clash, won 1-0 by Portugal, which 

 saw a World Cup record four red cards. 

Probably, from the point of view of rudeness, it was the worst match I ever had, the 45-year-old referee said on Tuesday. 

Both teams finished the bad-tempered encounter with nine men while eight others were cautioned. 

Ivanov was heavily criticised by players, coaches and even Fifa president Sepp Blatter. 

But Ivanov defended himself. Asked if he thought he had made any mistakes, he said: I dont know. I havent seen the video yet but I called the action as I saw it. 

Ivanov said he was taken by surprise by the rough tactics of Dutch players. You would expect some dirty tricks from the Portuguese. They are known for time-wasting or hitting from behind. But I was unpleasantly surprised by seeing such things from the Dutch. 

 Russian soccer chief Vitaly Mutko 

 said Blatters criticism of Ivanov was unfair. German 

 Football Association president Gerhard Mayer-Vorfelder said 

 the referee was just enforcing the rules.

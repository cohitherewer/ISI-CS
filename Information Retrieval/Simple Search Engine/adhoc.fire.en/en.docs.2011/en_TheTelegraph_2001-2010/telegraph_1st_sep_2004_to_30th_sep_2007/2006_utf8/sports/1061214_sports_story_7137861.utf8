 Woods voted Player of Year 

Ponte Vedra Beach (US): Tiger Woods was voted the 2006 USPGA Tour Player of the Year by his peers, Tour commissioner Tim Finchem announced here. 

Woods captured the honour for the eighth time on Tuesday in his famed career for a year that saw him raise his all-time major win total to 12 by capturing the British Open and PGA Championship. 

Tiger has shown a remarkable ability to raise his game to the highest level and then sustain that excellence, Finchem said. Winning the Jack Nicklaus Trophy for the eighth time in 10 years is testimony to his greatness. 

Moving ever nearer to Nicklaus record of 18 career major titles, Woods won eight events and led the USPGA Tour with $9.9 million in prize money. 

He also won the Byron Nelson Trophy for the low USPGA Tour scoring average at 68.11. 

Woods won two World Golf Championship events for the fifth times in his career and improved his career victory total to 54, fifth on the all-time win list.

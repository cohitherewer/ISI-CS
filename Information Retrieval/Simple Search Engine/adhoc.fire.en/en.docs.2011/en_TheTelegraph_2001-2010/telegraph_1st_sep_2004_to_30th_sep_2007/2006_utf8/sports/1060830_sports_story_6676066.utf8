 Mithalis unbeaten 51

London: Captain Mithali Raj scored a patient half-century to guard the Indian top-order against England bowlers on the first day of the womens second and final Test in Taunton on Tuesday. 

Electing to bat, Mithali made unbeaten 51 off 132 balls, aided by seven fours, to take her team to 133 for two in 64. 1 overs. Anjum Chopra was 37 not out at the other end. 

Earlier, Indian lost openers Karuna Jain and Sulakshana Naik in succession after they made 12 off 81 balls and a 76-ball 25 respectively on a seemingly difficult pitch.

 Japan coach criticises match venue

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Bangalore: The Karnataka State Football Association Stadium in Bangalore wears a dilapidated look despite a fine location and an impressive turf. But on Tuesday, it looked more like an international venue when the Japan football team came for their evening practice session. 

Japan skipped their allotted time at the match venue, Sree Kanteerava Stadium, and preferred to do it at the KSFA. 

Later, Japans Yugoslav coach Ivica Osim criticised the Kanteerava Stadium pitch and said India need to improve upon their facilities and infrastructure if they want to progress in the international arena. 

In stark contrast to India, the Japan Football Association has sent 16 support staff for 23 players. 

It includes two doctors, two physiotherapists and three athletics coaches. 

With two persons to look after and arrange their kits, the Japan team came to the KSFA Stadium with at least 50 print, TV and photo journalists from their country. A Japanese TV channel have come with their huge equipment to telecast the match live. 

One organising committee official said that the Japanese team, which arrived late on Sunday night, was more eager to inspect the practice facilities first than checking into their hotel. 

So serious is the federation in its approach that it has brought a printed schedule of Japans four-day stay in India. A copy was handed over to each journalist present on the first day. 

Osim, a huge name in Yugoslavia during his playing days, was first reluctant to talk to the media, but later appreciated Indias performance against Saudi Arabia. 

I have watched the video recording of Indias match against Saudi. 

They played much better than they did against us (last February in Yokohama) in our home match. The boys have definitely improved. 

Asked why he has left out the European players from the team, Osim said: Those players are well established. I know what they are capable of. We want to try the juniors as our goal is to prepare for the 2010 World Cup.

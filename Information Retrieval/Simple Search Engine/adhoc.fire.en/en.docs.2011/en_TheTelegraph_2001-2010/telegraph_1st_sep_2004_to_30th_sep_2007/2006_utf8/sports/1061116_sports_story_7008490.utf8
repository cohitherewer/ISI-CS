 Tiger keen to knock Federer off court

 - We just understand each other, says golfs No. 1

Miyazaki: Tiger Woods has revealed a secret desire to knock Roger Federer off court if he gets the chance to play his new friend at tennis. 

Golfs runaway No.1 and Federer, who dominates mens tennis, have become close friends since Woods watched the Swiss win the US Open title in September. 

Federer watched Woods play at last weeks Champions Tournament in Shanghai on Thursday before visiting the Americans rented house for dinner. 

However, Woods competitive streak surfaced on Wednesday when asked by Reuters if he would fancy playing Federer at tennis. 

Without a doubt, smiled Woods, who is in Japan for the defence of his Dunlop Phoenix title this week. I would love to have a hit with him and see if I can knock him off the court. 

Woods added: Roger came out and watched on Thursday, went back for a hit... and then came out with (girlfriend) Mirka to the house we were staying at for dinner that night. 

Woods has described Federer as someone who is able to relate to how it feels being labelled as arguably the best ever in their sport. 

We try and spend as much time as we can together if we are in the same city, Woods said. Our schedules were pretty busy (in Shanghai) but Thursday was free which was great so we were able to hang out and spend some time. 

Federer is currently in Shanghai for the season-ending Tennis Masters Cup. 

Weve hit it off, Woods added. After the US Open we have tried to talk as much as we possibly can. We just understand each other. 

Although both men are known the world over, Federers fame had clearly yet to reach the Japanese island resort of Miyazaki. 

After Woods had waxed lyrical about his new friend, his translator politely inquired: Roger who?

 Gamarra set to retire

Oberhaching: Its not the farewell from soccer that Carlos Gamarra dreamed of. The Paraguay captain is afraid he will be remembered as the player who frustrated his countrys World Cup expectations. 

Gamarra, 35, scored an own goal in Paraguays 1-0 debut loss to England. His team lost 1-0 to Sweden next, ensuring Paraguays first-round exit from the World Cup for the first time since 1958. 

 But El Colorado ? or The Red One, due to his hair colour ? says he feels at peace. 

The time has come to hang up my soccer shoes and I do it with the tranquillity of knowing that I always did my best when playing for Paraguay, Gamarra said on Saturday. (AP)

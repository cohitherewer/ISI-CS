Kingston: India failed to take advantage of the toss and crawled to 29 for two at lunch on the opening day of the fourth and final Test at Sabina Park here Friday. 

India lost openers Wasim Jaffer (1) and Virender Sehwag (0) within the first four overs as West Indies pacers revelled on a pitch which offered early moisture and bounce. 

At 12.15 am, India were 64 for four after 43 overs. VVS Laxman (18) and Yuvraj Singh (19) were dismissed after lunch. Rahul Dravid (19) and Mohammed Kaif (5) were at the crease. 

VVS laxman (14) and captain Rahul Dravid (13 ) didnt go by much in terms of scoring runs but they at least survived the session and could now hope for better conditions in the afternoon. 

Even this survival was much by way of luck as Laxman had two lucky reprieves in the session. 

Laxman edged the second delivery he faced from Pedro Collins but it just dropped short of Chris Gayle at first slip. 

The second chance was more definite as Brian Lara at second slip failed to grasp on to a straightforward catch in Corey Collymores first over. 

 Dravid hit the first four of the innings when he off-drove Dwayne Bravo for a four but by then the innings was in its 19th over. A couple of overs later Laxman too managed a boundary. 

The hot and humid day began disastrously for India as Sehwag flicked his second delivery from Collins straight into the hands of Ramnaresh Sarwan at forward short leg.

 India eye full points vs Hong Kong today 

 - Doha Asian games football opener

New Delhi: For a team which has lost six matches on the trot in the last 10 months, it is never easy to place themselves in a must-win position in the opening match of the next big tournament on an alien land. 

But on Wednesday, when India take on Hong Kong in the Group D match of the Asian Games football at the Al-Gharrafa Football Stadium in Doha, the only option they will be left with is to garner full points against the opponents who are clearly 31 places ahead in the world rankings. 

Clubbed in a group with Hong Kong, the Maldives and twice Asian Games champions Iran, India who have now been reduced to minnows of continental football can only hope to make the next round if they manage to get six points in the first two encounters. 

Beating Iran could be extremely difficult, admitted India coach Bob Houghton. After all, they have won the gold in the last two Asian Games and are looking for a hattrick. If we beat Hong and the Maldives, we have an outside chance of making the next round as one of the best two losers from six groups. 

But then, one is not very sure whether India would be able to achieve this target after losing six games at a stretch in the Asian Cup qualifiers. The Indian captain Bhaichung Bhutia said that the main aim would be not to concede any goal in the first half and look for a win in the second, but he himself was not sure how long his new-look defence will be able to hold on in the match. 

We have a relatively new side that couldnt practise together for long. Thats the problem. Otherwise the boys are confident to do a good job in the Asian games, said Bhutia, who is leading India for the second time in the Asian Games. 

Though both Surkumar Singh and NS Manju will be there to guide the back-four, Habibur Rahman and Debabrata Roy are relatively new entrants in the team. The four in the midfield should be Steven Dias, Gourmangi Singh, NP Pradeep and Syed Rahim Nabi though Houghton might push in Climax Lawrence in place of Gourmangi at the last moment. Manjit Singh is likely to pair Bhutia in the striking zone. 

India, who have practised in Dubai for 12 days and played two friendly matches before proceeding to Doha, are the lowest ranked team in the group. Iran are the best side with a Fifa ranking of 38, followed by Hong Kong (117), the Maldives (146) and India (148). The last time India played against Hong Kong was a friendly in March under Syed Nayeemuddin. It ended in a 2-2 draw.

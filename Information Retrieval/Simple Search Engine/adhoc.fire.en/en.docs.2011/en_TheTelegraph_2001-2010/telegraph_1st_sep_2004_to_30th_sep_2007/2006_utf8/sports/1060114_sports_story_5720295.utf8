The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Almost a year on, Haroon is cool

 - Ex-Pakistan manager eyes Academy opening 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Haroon Rashid 

Lahore: Shoaib Akhtar got recalled earlier this season but Haroon Rashid, who lost the Pakistan managers job largely owing to the speedsters nights out on the 2004-05 tour of Australia, is still exploring options almost a year after the sack. 

Of course, it didnt help that (on the same tour) there was even an allegation of rape ? wholly untrue, as it turned out ? against one of the allrounders. 

However, even if hes disappointed, Haroon isnt showing it. Apne mulk mein yeh sab hota rahta hai... Its part of the game, he told The Telegraph on Friday, Day I of the latest Indo-Pak series. 

Currently doing commentary, Haroon intends applying for a coachs job either at the National Cricket Academy here or one of the regional ones when the restructuring is complete. Things should soon be clear, he said. 

Incidentally, Haroon is also a former Pakistan coach and held that position when India won in thrilling manner to lift the Independence Cup in Dhaka, eight years ago.

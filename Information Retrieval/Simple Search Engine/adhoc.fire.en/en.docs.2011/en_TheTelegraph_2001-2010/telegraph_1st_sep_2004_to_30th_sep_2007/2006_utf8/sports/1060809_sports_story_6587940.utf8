The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Little headway in Pro League set-up

 - Colacos meeting with Goan clubs proves fruitless 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: AIFF general secretary Alberto Colacos meeting with top clubs in Calcutta regarding the launch of a professional league in 2007-08 had ended in controversy with the IFA secretary, Subrata Dutta getting manhandled allegedly by Mohammedan Sporting fans and officials. 

On Tuesday, his meeting with the officials of the Goan clubs with the same purpose didnt go any better. Colaco, who met officials of the Goan clubs in Panaji, could make little headway, according to Goa Football Association sources. Representatives of Dempo, Sporting Clube de Goa, Churchill Brothers, Salgaocar and Vasco were present to deliberate on regulations of the Professional League. 

GFA sources revealed the officials failed to look beyond their teams and were more busy speaking about themselves. The clubs missed the actual point, a GFA official said. Even Colaco was not too happy with the situation, and felt he should meet each club official separately on this issue. 

At the meeting, Colaco told club representatives that the Asian Football Confederation was keen on developing six National Football Leagues in Asia, including that of India. The AFC has sought help from the J-League which is the best in Asia. The Professional League has to be in place latest by next year, Colaco said at the meeting. 

On their part, Churchill Alemao (Churchill) and Peter Vaz (Sporting Clube de Goa) said the federation should help the clubs in roping in sponsors. 

Alemao also suggested that the number of foreign players in the NFL should be increased to five to improve the standard of the league. A few others present in the meeting also supported his demand. 

Colaco spelt out the regulations which must be compiled by clubs to make themselves eligible for participating in the Pro League next year. The guidelines set principles in areas of legal status, structure and administration, finance, access to facilities (playing and training), sporting development, identity and fan support. 

Colaco also said the clubs must guarantee financial resources that ensure they can meet their financial commitments for the duration of the season, with written evidence and guarantees supplied to the AIFF.

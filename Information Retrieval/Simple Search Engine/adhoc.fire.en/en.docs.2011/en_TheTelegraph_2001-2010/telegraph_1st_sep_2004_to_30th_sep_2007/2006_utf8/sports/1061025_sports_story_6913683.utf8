 Phar Lap was poisoned 

 Canberra: Australias greatest sporting mystery has been partly solved with scientists on Monday saying champion racehorse Phar Lap was poisoned before his US. race debut 74 years ago. Phar Lap won 37 starts over a four-year career including Australias best-known race, the Melbourne Cup, in 1932.

 But the champion chestnut galloper, known as Big Red by depression-era Australians, was found with blood pouring from his lungs in California on April 5, 1932, and died before a U.S. race in which he was tipped to beat all comers. Australian scientists using U.S. particle accelerator technology, said careful analysis of preserved hair samples had proved Phar Lap was given a lethal dose of arsenic around 35 hours before his death. 

 You will never get a 100 percent definite answer, he said.

 Quick Takes

 Vidmar loses battle to get fit

 Sydney: Experienced Australia 

 defender Tony Vidmar has lost his battle to get fit for 

 next months World Cup, Football Federation Australia 

 said on Tuesday. Vidmar, who plays for Dutch club NAC Breda, 

 suffered a rib injury last season and further tests revealed 

 an irregular heart beat.

 Its something that 

 has come as a real shock but due to the seriousness of the 

 situation I had no other choice in the interests of my own 

 health and the team but withdraw from being considered for 

 the World Cup squad, Vidmar said in an FFA statement.

 Of course I would love to 

 play in the World Cup, its been a dream of mine and 

 I have been in four campaigns but until I am fully aware 

 of my health situation I cant risk playing.

 Vidmar, 35, made his international 

 debut in 1991 and has played 75 times for his country. He 

 has also played for English Premier League side Middlesbrough 

 and spent five years with Scottish club Rangers. 

 Germans want a 'bit' of beer

 Berlin: Budweiser may be 

 the King of Beers in the US, but its often 

 laughed at in Germany, where it will be one of only two 

 beers available in football stadiums during the World Cup. 

 An official sponsor of the tournament, Budweiser originally 

 won the rights to a monopoly on beer sales at the World 

 Cup. But the decision outraged Germanys fiercely proud 

 beer drinkers, many of whom dislike the taste of weaker 

 US beers. 

 The St Louis-based firm noted 

 the furore and relented. It agreed to give 30 per cent of 

 beer sales rights to the family-run German brewery Bitburger 

 to sell its popular Bitburger Pils, better known as Bit.

 World's best 'English' stars

 London: More evidence that 

 the Premiership is home to the worlds best footballers, 

 some would say to the detriment of domestic talent, comes 

 courtesy a football magazine, which has named its top ten 

 World Cup stars. Half of them play in the Premiership, but 

 none of them is English. 

 The Ten for Germany 

 list includes Didier Drogba and Michael Essien, of Chelsea, 

 Harry Kewell, of Liverpool, Philippe Senderos, of Arsenal, 

 and Park Ji-sung, of Manchester United. It is headed by 

 Andriy Shevchenko, the Ukraine and AC Milan striker. 

 Japan lose to bulgaria

 Osaka: Bulgaria struck 

 in the opening and dying seconds to beat World Cup-bound 

 Japan 2-1 in a Kirin Cup friendly on Tuesday. Portsmouths 

 Svetoslav Todorov stunned Japan just 53 seconds into the 

 opening game of the three-team tournament, while Seiichiro 

 Maki equalised after 76 minutes to boost his claims for 

 a World Cup place after his third goal in eight games. Substitute 

 Hristo Yanev, however, snatched the winner for Bulgaria.

 New threat

 Berlin: The risk of hooliganism 

 is hanging over the World Cup with a new threat from eastern 

 European troublemakers heading the list of concerns. The 

 fact that the World Cup is returning to Europe after a turn 

 in Asia, the wide availability of cheap beer in Germany 

 and the countrys many shared borders make the tournament 

 potentially high-risk.

 This World Cup is a challenge 

 for the hooligans. The Germans will want to show what they 

 are capable of doing, the others will want to cut loose 

 in a foreign country, said Andreas Morbach, the deputy 

 head of the German polices central sport intelligence 

 unit (ZIS).

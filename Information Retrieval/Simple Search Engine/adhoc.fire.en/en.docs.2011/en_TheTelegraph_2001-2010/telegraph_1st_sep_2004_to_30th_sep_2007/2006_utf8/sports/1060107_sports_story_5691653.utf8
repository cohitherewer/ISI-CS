 Badani: Yardstick for selection not same for all

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: He was a Team India member during the tour of Pakistan two years ago. He also hoped to make it this time around as well on the back of his consistent performance in domestic cricket. 

But that didnt happen and Hemang Badani feels the yardstick for selection is not the same for all. 

You can see that one is given too many chances to regain form while the other is thrown out (of the team) after just a bad performance. Obviously, the yardstick for selection is not the same for all, Badani, who scored 57 and an unbeaten 157 in Tamil Nadus 222-run win over Bengal at the Eden, said on Friday. 

Badani scored eight not out in Karachi on March 13, 2004. India, led by Sourav Ganguly, won that match, which turned out to be the last one for the Tamil Nadu batsman. 

Did Sourav have a role behind his omission from the side? Badani replied in the negative. Sourav might have been the captain (at that time), but its the selectors decision, he said. 

Badani also said he wasnt out in the middle to wage a personal battle against Sourav at the Eden. I wanted to do my job, while Sourav was fighting for his own place, he said. 

Badani also said he was exploring the possibility of a County stint in the coming summer.

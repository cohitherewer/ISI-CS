The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Bhupathi too pulls out of Chennai meet

 - I had been practising too hard 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The 2007 Chennai Open wont feature either of the Indian tennis superstars. 

That Leander Paes would play in Doha, instead of Chennai, in the first week of the new season was reported in The Telegraph on Friday. Now, Mahesh Bhupathi has also pulled out, on doctors advice. 

The doubles ace developed tendinitis in his right wrist while practising in London. I had been practising very hard in fact I played too much tennis in the past few days, that caused the problem, said Bhupathi, who had skipped the 2006 Chennai Open, too, albeit for different reasons. 

Bhupathi, who was due to play the Chennai event with Swede Simon Aspelin, expects to kick off the year at the Sydney meet (with Frenchman Fabrice Santoro as his partner) beginning January 8. 

I should be fine by then I will leave for Australia on Thursday and do my rehab and training there, said Bhupathi, who will pair up with Czech Radek Stepanek from the Australian Open. 

This will be the first time that neither Paes nor Bhupathi will be playing the Chennai ATP event. The pair began its journey at this very place, winning the doubles crown for the first three years (1997-99).

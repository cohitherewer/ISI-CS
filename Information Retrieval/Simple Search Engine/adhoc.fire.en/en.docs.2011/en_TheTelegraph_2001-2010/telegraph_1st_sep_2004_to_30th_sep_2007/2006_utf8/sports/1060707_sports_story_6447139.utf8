The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Zidane... bold 

 and beautiful

God also gave Figo chances, but 

he failed to capitalise

 On Target 

 Shyam Thapa

 Eight 

 years ago, they were the hosts and their march to the final 

 was heavily accentuated by huge public expectation at home. 

 Eight days ago, they were written off into the depths of 

 despair. Still France stood up, made themselves count and 

 suddenly are just one step away from yet another World Cup 

 title. This is the stuff great sporting folklore are made 

 of.

 Wednesdays semi-final between 

 France and Portugal also had an underlying theme ? a battle 

 between two great footballers. Both teams tried their best 

 to help their respective captains take a last shot at the 

 ultimate glory. In the end, luck favoured the French and 

 Zinedine Zidane had the last laugh, while Luis Figo returned 

 disappointed, a match away from his dream final.

 True, the France-Portugal encounter 

 didnt reach the heights of the first semi-final between 

 Italy and Germany. The speed and free-flowing spirit, which 

 scorched the Dortmund pitch on Tuesday, was missing in the 

 second semi-final. But the match had its own sentiment and 

 bearing on the football lovers across the globe because 

 of Zidane and Figos presence.

 It was also a match between the 

 experienced and youth. I must say, tactically, France succeeded 

 in slowing down the game, frustrating the more adventurous 

 Figo amp; Co. and hoping Thierry Henry to make one of his 

 typical breakaway moves.

 The plot unfolded in accordance 

 to their plan when Henry earned the penalty in the 33rd 

 minute. It was a 50-50 decision and the referee could have 

 easily ignored the French strikers fall following 

 Ricardo Carvalhos challenge.

 It really amazes me how senior 

 and professional players like Henry are taking resort to 

 play-acting for earning free-kicks. His clever fall inside 

 the box must have duped the referee, but it is honesty and 

 not such gamesmanship that makes you a hero in public eyes.

 Its sad to see that when 

 his teammate Zidane is leading by example how football could 

 be beautiful through a clean, unadulterated display, Henry 

 consigned himself to influencing the referee through other 

 means. I have no way of describing Zidane. He just keeps 

 amazing us by dint of his inspirational leadership, surreal 

 vision and breathtaking elegance.

 Against the Portuguese, he was 

 heavily marked and so, we couldnt see much of his 

 artistry on the pitch. But the way he took the penalty epitomised 

 the bold and beautiful face of the resurgent French.

 God also gave Figo chances, but 

 he failed to capitalise on them. In the 78th minute, Barthez 

 failed to grasp a Cristiano Ronaldo free-kick and in the 

 follow-through, the Portugal captain came up with an atrocious 

 header from close which flew over the bar. He looked a bit 

 tense. Perhaps playing with an injury had its toll and therefore 

 wasnt quite effective with his delivery.

 But Ronaldo played his best game 

 on Wednesday night. He was booed by the crowd every time 

 he touched the ball, but his sprint down the flank was always 

 a danger to the French backline.

 Deco and Costinha also disappointed 

 me. Their suspension for the England match means they had 

 precious rest before the semi-final. Yet they failed to 

 deliver when they were required most and with their flop 

 show, Portugal were a shadow of their self. I still wonder 

 how Figo missed the target from such a close range. Perhaps 

 this is what we call champions luck.

 Surely, the win over Brazil has 

 given France the much-needed confidence and suddenly, all 

 the old horses like Zidane, Vieira, Makelele and Thuram 

 are looking young. And you never know if they are destined 

 to add another twist to the drama.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Opener ends in tame draw

Lahore: Wasim Jaffer followed up his first innings half century with another sparkling knock in the second essay to stake his claim for a Test slot as Indias three-day warm-up game against Pakistan A petered out to a tame draw here on Monday. 

Jaffer made 35 not out with six fours in 43 balls, while Gautam Gambhir was unbeaten on 28 off 38 balls with five fours as India ended their second innings with a total of 72 for no loss at the Bagh-E-Jinnah Ground. 

Mumbai batsman Jaffer played some scintillating cover drives and pull shots against pacer Umar Gul. 

Partner Gambhir, however, struggled at the other end. 

The Delhi left hander was dropped twice by Zulqarnain Haider before opening his account, and then played and missed quite a few times before settling down to play some fine drives off Mohammed Irshad. 

Pakistan A declared at 358 for nine, 56 runs behind Indias 414 for seven declared in the first innings. The home team put on 146 runs after starting the day at 212 for four. 

The first session produced 71 runs and the second 75. The unconquered batsmen at the time of declaration were Umar Gul and last man Rao Iftikhar Anjum. 

The highlight of the days play under misty and cold conditions was Faisal Iqbals 87 in 238 balls with 15 fours. 

He was caught at deep square leg, while pulling Ajit Agarkar to Harbhajan Singh. 

Wicketkeeper Haider had departed earlier in the pre-tea session, trapped leg before by Irfan Pathan who finished with three for 82. 

Agarkar and Rudra Pratap Singh got two wickets each, while Harbhajan claimed one. 

Rudra Pratap and Zaheer struck once each within the first half hour of play before Pakistan A recovered through their seventh wicket pair of Iqbal and Haider. (Agencies)

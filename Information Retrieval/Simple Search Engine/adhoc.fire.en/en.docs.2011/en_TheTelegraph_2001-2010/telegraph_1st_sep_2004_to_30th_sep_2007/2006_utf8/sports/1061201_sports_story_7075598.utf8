 Adults should handle any tension: Sunny 

 - Time will tell if Souravs selection was right: Bedi 

Johannesburg/New Delhi: Batting legend Sunil Gavaskar hopes that grown up people in the Indian dressing room would leave the tension between them behind and give their best once the Test matches against South Africa start. 

He was not willing to dwell on the bad blood that had existed between coach Greg Chappell and Sourav Ganguly, now back in the Test squad, but felt it should take a backseat and nations cricket should get the priority. 

They are grown up people and they should be able to handle any tension, as you term it, behind in the interest of the team, said Gavaskar who is in Johannesburg as a TV commentator. 

With the selection of Sourav, whispers have started whether the former India captain has good enough technique to do well against a home attack which would exploit the pace and bounce of the wickets. Whether somebody would do well or not would only amount to speculation at this stage, said Gavaskar. 

Meanwhile, another former India captain Bishan Singh Bedi said only time would tell whether the step to bring back Sourav was a correct one. 

Lets give them (the selectors) some time. They have made a decision. Ganguly has shown the courage to make a comeback. Only time will tell whether it was a right decision, Bedi told reporters on the sidelines of the memorial service in the honour of former Test cricketers Polly Umrigar and Hanumant Singh in New Delhi.

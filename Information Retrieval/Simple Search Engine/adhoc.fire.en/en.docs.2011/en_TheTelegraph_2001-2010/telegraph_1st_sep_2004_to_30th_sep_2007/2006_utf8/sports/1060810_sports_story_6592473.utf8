The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Sourav, Paul make probables list

 - CHAMPIONS TROPHY 

 - T.P. Singh, Rohit Sharma among new faces 

 Bangalore: Sourav Ganguly 

 was on the comeback trail on Wednesday after being selected 

 among 30 probables for the ICC Champions Trophy along with 

 other ODI discards Zaheer Khan, VVS Laxman and Anil Kumble.

 Ignored by the selectors since 

 the tour of Pakistan eight months ago, the former Indian 

 skipper was included despite poor form with the bat in the 

 County Championship.

 Railways allrounder Tejinder Pal 

 Singh and Mumbai batsman Rohit Sharma were among the new 

 faces on the list announced by BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah 

 after a 40-minute meeting of the selection committee.

 Young leg-spinner Piyush Chawla, 

 Tamil Nadu middle-order batsman S. Badrinath and Bengal 

 paceman Shib Shankar Paul were the other fringe players 

 who made the cut.

 Justifying Souravs inclusion, 

 chief selector Kiran More said he is top on the list 

 of grade A players. So when we select 30 probables, he definitely 

 walks in.

 Sourav, who first lost his captaincy 

 and then a place in the national squad following a bitter 

 spat with coach Greg Chappell last year, tried to force 

 his way back through the County route but ended up without 

 any significant scores under his belt during his five-week 

 stint with Northamptonshire.

 However, More said the selectors 

 had not gone by the County performances alone.

 We did not go by County 

 performance alone. Sourav is a good enough player. We wish 

 him all the best, said the former India wicketkeeper 

 who had famously announced earlier that there would be no 

 looking back on Sourav as far as the present selection 

 committee was concerned.

 More denied there was any external 

 pressure to pick Sourav in the preliminary squad. There 

 was no pressure from anyone, he stated. 

 Asked pointedly whether Sourav 

 would be included in the final 14, More said, it depends. 

 It applies not only to Sourav but to any other player. Performance 

 is the consideration. Whosoever performs will be considered.

 More also sought to justify the 

 decision to go in for 30 probables instead of the 22 or 

 25 as widely speculated.

 We have a situation where 

 we could have more options if we selected 30, which is the 

 limit given by the ICC.

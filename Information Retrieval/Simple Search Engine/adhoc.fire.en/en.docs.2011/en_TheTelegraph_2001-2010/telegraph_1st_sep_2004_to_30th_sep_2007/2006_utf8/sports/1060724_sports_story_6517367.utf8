 Now, a contracts row in NZ

Christchurch: After the West Indies, it is the turn of the NZC to deal with players stand-off over a contracts row, ahead of the Champions Trophy in October. 

NZC wants players to sign in advance participation contracts for ICC-governed events such as the World Cup and Champions Trophy but the players are unwilling because of their individual image and sponsorship rights, resulting in the delay in inking the new collective contract. 

The agreement, which was due to have been signed on June 1, is almost two months overdue, a newspaper reported Sunday. 

Meanwhile, the latest dispute between the West Indies Cricket Board and West Indies Players Association has drawn a strong reaction from Grenadas Prime Minister Keith Mitchell, who said common sense and not crises should prevail ahead of the World Cup.

 Jamaica clinch sprint medals 

 Melbourne: Englands best day at the Melbourne Commonwealth Games ended in tears when their relay jinx returned to deny gold for the 4x400 womens team. 

A controversial evening at the MCG also brought heartbreak for Australias 1500m gold medal hope Craig Mottram who tripped and fell during the race to scupper his chances. 

Englands women crossed the line first ahead of Australia but the host nation were promoted to the gold after Tamsyn Lewis lodged a protest against Natasha Danvers Smith for starting in her position at the second changeover. 

As far as Im concerned, England are the Commonwealth Games 4x400 champions. Thats it! fumed Danvers Smith. 

Australia equalled the record for the most medals won at a single Games with one day still remaining. They have 207 medals, including 79 golds. England are second with 32 golds ahead of Canada (22), India (21) and South Africa (12). 

Englands haul was boosted by a dominant performance in the boxing ring where they won gold in five of the 11 categories. 

World 100m record holder Asafa Powell collected his second gold medal as the Jamaicans cleaned up the sprint relays to go with their mens and womens 100, 200 and sprint hurdles golds. 

Jamaica are the first nation to win all the sprint medals at a major championships since a Carl Lewis-inspired US team at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics. 

Englands 4x400 relay disqualification compounded a miserable week at the MCG after their mens 4x100 relay team dropped the baton in their heat and were eliminated. 

It also enabled Australia to complete the 4x400m relay double when individual 400 champion John Steffensen led off. 

That was small consolation to Mottram, whose brother Neil won a basketball gold on Friday. He was inconsolable after the 1500 where he was favourite to win in his hometown. 

The 5,000 silver medallist was ideally placed in third position with 700m to go when Englands Nick McCormick clipped the heels of teammate Andrew Baddeley, who in turn fell forward and brought down Mottram. 

New Zealands Nick Willis avoided the commotion and ran a brilliant race to claim his countrys first 1,500m Commonwealth gold medal. 

The strength of English amateur boxing was evident as their young fighters equalled their countrys record haul of five Commonwealth Games golds at the Melbourne Exhibition Centre on Saturday. 

Flyweight Don Broadhurst and lightweight Frankie Gavin put in the standout performances as all but one of Englands finalists came away with a victory.

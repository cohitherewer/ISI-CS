 Santosh Trophy may shift to Haryana

 - Decision after talks with J amp;K chief minister

New Delhi: Under pressure from Bengal and Goa to shift the Santosh Trophy from Srinagar because of increasing terrorist activities in the valley, the All India Football Federation (AIFF), it seems, is desperately looking for a face saving solution before allotting the national championships to another state. 

According to AIFF sources, there is a strong possibility that the Santosh Trophy may now be shifted out of Jammu and Kashmir not because of security concerns but due to infrastructure problems. Since the Buxi Stadium in Srinagar is yet not equipped with all the facilities to host a national meet, the AIFF may take it as an excuse to change the venue, and most likely shift it to Haryana. 

Though the championship is round the corner in September, AIFF general secretary Alberto Colaco has been tight-lipped on the issue for the past couple of days. The executive committee has entrusted Mr (Priya Ranjan) Das Munshi to take a final decision on it. He would be talking to Jammu and Kashmir chief Minister Gulam Nabi Azad soon before deciding on it, Colaco said. 

While Colaco is not ready to say anything beyond this, it is quite clear that the demand of the two major soccer playing states, Bengal and Goa, has left the AIFF deeply embarrassed. It would be impossible for the federation to change the venue on the issue of security after the Jammu and Kashmir governments pledging full security to the tournament. 

Asked for his view on possible threat to the participants in the Santosh Trophy, Colaco said: My visit to Srinagar was to look after the organisational and infrastructural part. My report to the executive committee had nothing to do with security since I am not qualified to comment on it. It is for the state to look after. Even the Fifa guidelines say so. 

While Haryana still remain the frontrunners to bag the 61st national championships, time is running out fast for them, too. 

The Haryana Football Association secretary Sunil Bhardwaj said, They should officially tell us about it as soon as possible. The state government has promised us to allot Rs 1.50 crores, but will not release it until we can produce the letter from the federation. We also need time to install floodlights at the Gurgaon stadium.

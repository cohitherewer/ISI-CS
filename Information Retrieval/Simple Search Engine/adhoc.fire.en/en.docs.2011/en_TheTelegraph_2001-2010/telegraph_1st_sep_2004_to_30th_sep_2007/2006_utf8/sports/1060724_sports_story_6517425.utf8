 Sourav e-mail ill-timed: Kshiti Goswami

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Public works department minister Kshiti Goswami said on Sunday that former Team India captain Sourav Gangulys e-mail came at the wrong time. 

What Sourav has succeeded in doing, is fan the fire of an already tense atmosphere of CAB elections. His e-mail will serve no purpose in his being inducted into the national side. 

With this, he has rendered himself vulnerable to those who wish to exploit him for their own interests, said Goswami, who was chief guest at Sundays CAB annual awards function. 

The RSP leader felt the former Team India captain should have fired the e-mail earlier if he had a genuine grudge. 

Sourav should have fired the e-mail when the entire Bengal was up in arms for him being unjustly left out of the national side. Now that its election time, this e-mail will complicate matters. It wont help Sourav in any way, the PWD minister added. 

He said the CAB should remain free of all political interference. 

The CAB is an autonomous body and should be run the way it has been for years ? independently. 

The CAB has contributed immensely for development of the sport in Bengal, Goswami said, adding, those who are hatching a controversy against cricket in this state should be stopped in their tracks.

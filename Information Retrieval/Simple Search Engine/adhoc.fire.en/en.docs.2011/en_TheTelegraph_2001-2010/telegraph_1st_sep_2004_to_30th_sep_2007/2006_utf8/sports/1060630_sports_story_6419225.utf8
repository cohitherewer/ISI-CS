 Kapil blasts Chappell

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: Former skipper Kapil Dev on Thursday accused Team India coach Greg Chappell of not standing by Irfan Pathan at his hour of need. It was wrong on the part of Chappell to tell the media on the eve of the Test series (in West Indies) that Pathans confidence level was low, Kapil said. 

At least, I wouldnt have said anything like that. This was the time when Pathan needed support from the coach. Instead, the coach chose to run him down. 

Kapil said he was surprised by Pathans absence. I dont know what is the problem. Only a couple of months ago, Pathan was considered a good all-rounder. Now he is not even in the team. 

If a player underperforms, it is the duty of the team management to give him the necessary confidence so that he comes out of the bad phase. By dropping him, you only further reduce his level of confidence.

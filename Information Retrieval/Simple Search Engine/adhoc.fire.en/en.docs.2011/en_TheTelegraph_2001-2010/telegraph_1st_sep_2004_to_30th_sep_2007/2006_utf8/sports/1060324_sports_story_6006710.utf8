The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Asias fresh bid move almost fell through 

A STAFF REPORTER IN CALCUTTA AND PTI IN KARACHI 

The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) secretary Niranjan Shah said on Thursday that the move by the four Asian Test-playing nations to seek an extension for submitting the 2011 World Cup bid almost fell through, as it faced strong protests from some of the ICC executive board members. 

PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan also told a news conference in Karachi that the Asian countries were on the verge of being disqualified during the recent ICC executive board meeting held in Dubai. 

Its true that some countries were of the view that a fresh deadline should not be given to us for submitting the bid. But the ICC finally allowed us to make a new bid by April 21, Shah told The Telegraph. 

Describing it as ticklish situation, Khan said: Actually, our compliance book was not ready in which we had to identify certain issues, including logistical arrangements and offers. 

The Asian big four ? India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh ? missed the original February 20 deadline. Once they submit the new bid by April 21, it will subsequently be discussed at an ICC board meeting in Dubai nine days later. The PCB chief further revealed that the four nations had agreed upon the distribution of matches with the semi-finals and the final to be staged in accordance with the 1996 World Cup. This means that according to the proposal, India would host the inaugural ceremony as well as the two semi-finals while the final will be held in Pakistan and most likely in Lahore.

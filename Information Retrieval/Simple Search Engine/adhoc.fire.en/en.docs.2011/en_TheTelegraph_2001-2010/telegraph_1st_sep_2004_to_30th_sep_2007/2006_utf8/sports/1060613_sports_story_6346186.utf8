 Daei unlikely vs Portugal

Nuremberg: Ali Daei, Irans captain and top international scorer, is likely to miss the next World Cup match with Portugal because of a back injury. 

He suffered a hit in the back during yesterdays game and probably wont be fit to play, coach Branko Ivanko-vic said Monday. 

A 1-3 loss to Mexico on Sunday has deflated the teams spirits because the opening match in Group D was seen as crucial to Irans hopes of advancing into the knockout phase. 

On Monday, the players engaged in some light practice next to their hotel in Nuremberg before boarding a flight back to the teams base in Friedrichshafen. 

The loss of Daei, 37, is seen as another blow to Irans dwindling chances of making it to the second round. Daeis 145 caps and 109 goals make him the top international scorer in the history of the game. 

Team doctor Sasa Jankovic said Ali Karimi, Mehdi Mahdavikia and Vahid Hashemian will be ready for the Portugal match. (AP)

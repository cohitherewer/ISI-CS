 Sawant named manager for Test series

Mumbai: Mumbai Cricket Association vice-president Ravi Sawant has replaced D. Dongaonkar, secretary of the Indian Universities, as manager of Team India for the four-Test series in the West Indies, the BCCI announced on Monday. 

Ravi Sawant has replaced Dongaonkar as manager for the Test series as the latter has expressed his inability to go, said BCCI executive secretary in charge Prof. Ratnakar Shetty. 

Sawant will take over the mantle from Ranjib Biswal, who is currently managing the Indian squad in the ongoing one-day International series. 

The Test series commences on June 2.

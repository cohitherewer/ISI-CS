 Federer struggles, Sharapova survives

 - Swiss world No. 1 slams organisers 

Paris: World No. 1 Roger Federer criticised organisers of the French Open for making him play on the opening day in Paris, the first time a Grand Slam event has begun on a Sunday. 

The top seed, looking to win the French Open to complete a career Grand Slam, looked rusty as he stumbled past Diego Hartfield, an Argentine qualifier, 7-5, 7-6, 6-2 to reach Round II. 

Federer said he had asked not to schedule his game on the opening day but his requests were rejected by organisers who have extended the event to 15 days in order to increase its exposure, particularly on television. 

I requested not to play Sunday, so I wasnt happy to play today, Federer told reporters. 

I heard I was going to play on Sunday a couple weeks ago. I was never happy about that idea. I told everybody that I didnt want to play Sunday. 

Anyway, they decided to do it that way. Thats Grand Slam. They dont listen to us as much as the other tournaments, which is unfortunate sometimes. 

Federer, who was beaten by Rafael Nadal in the semi-finals at Roland Garros last year, was concerned that he could lose his rhythm before his second-round match on Wednesday. 

Hartfield, the world number 156, led 5-3 in the first set and pushed Federer hard in the second before the Swiss eased through the third. 

Seventh seed Tommy Robredo also criticised the Sunday start. 

If my match had been a five-set match in five hours, I would have had two days to rest, said the Spaniard, who beat Czech Tomas Zib 6-4, 6-2, 6-2. 

He will meet either Boris Pashanski or Ilia Bozoljac, both of Serbia and Montenegro, for a third round spot. 

Argentinas David Nalbandian swept into the second round with a 6-2, 7-6, 6-4 win over Switzerlands Stanislas Wawrinka. 

Fourth seed Maria Sharapova saved three match-points as she fought back from a 2-5 deficit in the final set to beat American Mashona Washington 6-2, 5-7, 7-5 late on Sunday. 

The former Wimbledon champion, playing her first match in almost two months after being sidelined with a foot injury, looked down and out in the decider but roared back to clinch a second-round clash with Czech Iveta Benesova. 

Russian 14th seed Dinara Safina beat compatriot Vera Zvonareva 6-3, 7-5 to enter the second round on Sunday. 

The 20-year-old Safina, the younger sister of former mens world number one Marat Safin, recovered from 4-2 down in the second set. 

World No. 1 Amelie Mauresmo reached the second round with a solid 6-4, 6-4 win over American Meghann Shaughnessy on Sunday.

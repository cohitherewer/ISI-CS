 Madrid: India went out 

 of semi-final reckoning after suffering their third loss 

 in four outings, a 2-3 loss to hosts Spain, in the womens 

 hockey World Cup here on Tuesday.

 The Asian champions conceded 10 

 penalty corners and failed to convert those that came their 

 way to go out of medal contention.

 Silvia Munoz (10th) drew first 

 blood while Pilar Sanchez (30th, 43rd) added a brace.

 For India, Suriner Kaur (17th) 

 and Saba Anjum (48th) reduced the margin.

 Spain strengthened their chance 

 of earning a semi-final berth, pushing their tally to nine 

 points in Pool A, topped by runner-up Holland.

 Holland thrashed China 6-1 to 

 lead the table with 12 points and assure their passage to 

 last-four.

 England were two points adrift 

 of Spain following their 1-0 upset of Germany.

 India have one point from their 

 draw against England on Sunday. (PTI)

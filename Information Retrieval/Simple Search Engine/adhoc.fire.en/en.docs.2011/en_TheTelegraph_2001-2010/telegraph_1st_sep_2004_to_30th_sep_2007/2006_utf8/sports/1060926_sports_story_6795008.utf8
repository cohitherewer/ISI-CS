 Moya: Ill try and convert the 500 wins into 600

OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Carlos Moya 

Mumbai: He turned 30 only last month. Even our doubles heroes Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi are older than him. Yet, some of the questions thrown at him during Monday afternoons interaction with the media made Carlos Moya him look a fossil on the Tour. 

To the Spaniards credit, he made no unforced errors in volleying back the winners. Every year its getting more and more difficult for me, but I still have the energy and power to fight them, said the Mallorca-born star now based in Geneva. 

His compatriot Rafael Nadal was unquestionably the leader of the young brigade, laying siege on Roger Federers throne, but Moya also mentioned some other names. 

The likes of (Novak) Djokovic and (Andy) Murray are also coming up strong and will soon be ready to take up the cause. 

An avid India lover, Moya had two nightmarish trips to Chennai before making the last three visits memorable. He won back-to-back titles, both at the expense of Paradorn Srichaphan, before losing the 2006 final to Ivan Ljubicic. 

Within a week of missing the Chennai hattrick by a whisker, Moya triumphed on the claycourts of Buenos Aires. That has been his lone triumph this year thus far, but it has ensured him at least one title during each of the last seven sea- sons. 

More recently, Moya touched another imposing landmark when he won his 500th career singles match. I am very proud of that achievement when I started off as a pro 11 years ago, I never imagined Id be able to win 500. I think this can be compared to a Grand Slam win. 

Moya even announced he would aim for 600 victories now. I want to play for a few more years, so Ill try and convert the 500 into 600. 

Expressing confidence in Nadals abilities and fitness, Moya said he didnt see the young Spaniard getting burnt out. In fact, the 1998 French Open champion predicted Nadal reaching the pinnacle of mens tennis if he can stay around for about two more years, because by that time Federer wont be as invincible as he is today. 

Moya, a big supporter of the Hawk-Eye system, didnt have any misgivings about coming to Mumbai despite the serial blasts here some months ago. 

I was in Chennai five days after the tsunami why should I fear security here? If the ATP feels its safe to play in a particular city, I think its the players duty to perform there. 

That was vintage Moya at his charming best. Illustrating why he is so popular in India.

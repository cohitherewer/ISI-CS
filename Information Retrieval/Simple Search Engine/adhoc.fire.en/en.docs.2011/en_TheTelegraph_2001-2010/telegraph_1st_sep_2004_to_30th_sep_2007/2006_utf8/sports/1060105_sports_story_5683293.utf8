 Dravid praise for Harbhajan 

New Delhi: Rahul Dravid has given thumbs-up to Harbhajan Singh, saying the off-spinner took pride in his bowling which made his job as captain easier. 

Harbhajan had come out against coach Greg Chappell and backed ex-skipper Sourav Ganguly when the two were involved in an ugly spat a few months back. 

Dravid said he had no problems with players who strived to achieve excellence on their own. 

One of the great things about Harbhajan is that he really cares about his bowling. He is a very, very proud cricketer. 

And it is not hard work with people like that, Dravid told a publication that is due to be released on Thursday. 

I have no problems working with people who want to be champions, as simple as that. I think he figured out for himself that he needed to focus a bit more on the game and not worry about anything else, get back to what he was doing when he was successful. 

It is credit to him, it is not about what I have told him. 

Dravid also said that Chappell did not have an overbearing influence on him and that the Indian team was very much run in his own way. 

I have not found him domineering at all. He has been more than willing to listen to my ideas and my thoughts and I get a very good say. 

At the end of the day, I think he believes that a captain must get what he wants. In fact, in a lot of ways we do a lot of things in my way.

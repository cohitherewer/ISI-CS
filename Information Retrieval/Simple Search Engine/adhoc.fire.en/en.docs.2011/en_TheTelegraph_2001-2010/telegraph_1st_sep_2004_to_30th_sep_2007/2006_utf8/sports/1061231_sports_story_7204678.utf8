 Bhaichung dedicates award to late coach

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: It couldnt have come any better for Bhaichung Bhutia as the Indian captain celebrated his maiden Federation Cup title by winning the Most Valuable Player award. 

An emotional Bhaichung later dedicated the honour to the late Manas Chakraborty, his first coach in Sikkims Tashi Namgyal Academy, under whom he had spent his formative years. 

This is a special moment for me since Ive been waiting for this for many years. I wouldve been happier if my first coach was there to witness it. But unfortunately he passed away a few days ago, the evergreen striker said on Saturday. 

Had there been a Man-of-the-Match award, who would have won it? Pat came Bhaichungs reply: The whole team. Its a victory for team spirit. 

Mohun Bagan captain Jose Ramirez Barreto also endorsed the view. 

The juniors gelled nicely with seniors like us and the spirit among us was so strong that we never lost hope in the tournament, the Brazilian said. 

Interim coach Robson, meanwhile, defended his strategy of fielding five forwards towards the end of the match. 

Some players were tired and asked to be taken out. Since we had little option, I had to field bring in those players, he maintained.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Netherlands hold Australia

 Champions Trophy

 Terrassa (Spain): The Netherlands 

 drew 1-1 with Australia in the Champions Trophy mens 

 hockey meet.

 Taeke Taekema scored once from 

 three penalty corner chances for The Netherlands and Australias 

 Troy Elder drove in a field goal set up by Robbie Hammond.

 Hosts Spain dominated the midfield 

 throughout their match after taking the lead with a 19th-minute 

 penalty corner conversion from Santiago Freixa.

 But an Argentine gamble on two 

 extra strikers in the final 10 minutes paid dividends with 

 Tomas Argento scoring 35 seconds before the hooter with 

 a back stick strike on a bouncing ball in the middle of 

 the circle to level at 1-1. (AFP)

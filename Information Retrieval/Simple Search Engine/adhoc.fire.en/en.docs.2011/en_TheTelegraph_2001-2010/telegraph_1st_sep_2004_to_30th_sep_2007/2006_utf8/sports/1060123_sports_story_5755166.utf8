 Sanath century in Lanka win

Melbourne: Sri Lanka produced a superb team effort in the field after recalled opener Sanath Jayasuriya had scored a century to beat Australia by 51 runs in their triangular one-day match in Sydney on Sunday. 

Jayasuriya notched his 19th one-day century in Sri Lankas 309 for seven. 

The Sri Lankan bowlers then put pressure on the Australians from the outset, reducing them to 41 for three before bowling them out for 258 on the final ball of their 50 overs. 

Super sub Malinga Bandara finished with four for 58, including grabbing two wickets in the final over. 

Only wicketkeeper Brad Haddin (41), Michael Clarke (67) and Andrew Symonds (31), who had combined for 73 runs in 10.1 overs to look like they may steal the game for the world champions, produced any real resistance. 

Clarke and Symonds initially played themselves in before they began to accelerate and put pressure on the Sri Lankan field with some aggressive running between the wickets. 

Symonds, however, was run out after a brilliant stop in the field by Tillakaratne Dilshan in the 36th over and Clarke fell five balls later when he holed out in the deep off Bandara to leave Australia 188 for seven.

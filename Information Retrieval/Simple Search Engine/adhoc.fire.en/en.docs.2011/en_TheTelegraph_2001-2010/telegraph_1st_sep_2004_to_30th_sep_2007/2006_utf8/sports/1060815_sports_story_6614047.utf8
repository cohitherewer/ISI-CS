 Asif, Rana fit to join squad

Karachi: Pakistan bowlers Mohammed Asif and Rana Naved-ul Hasan have been cleared to join the tour squad in England and could be considered for the final Test at the Oval starting on Thursday, chief selector Wasim Bari said on Monday. 

Bari said that both would leave for England on Monday after the team management agreed they should join the team. 

Asif had returned home before the first Test at Lords with an elbow injury while Rana Naved was ruled out with a groin problem. 

Asif, who has taken 25 wickets in five Tests, was initially scheduled to leave earlier for England but was held back after the team management said they did not require him for the Oval Test. 

But a board official said they had now had a change of mind. The absence of Asif, Naved and fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar was felt by Pakistan which lost the second and third Tests by big margins. 

Rana bowled eight overs on Sunday under the supervision of the doctors. They have cleared him now from his groin problem, Bari said. (Reuters)

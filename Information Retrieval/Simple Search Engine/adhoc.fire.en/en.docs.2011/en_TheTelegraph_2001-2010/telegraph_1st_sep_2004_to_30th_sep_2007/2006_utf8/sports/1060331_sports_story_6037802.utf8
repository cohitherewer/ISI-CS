The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 IN THE CITY

 The impasse over Mike Okoro did not get resolved on Thursday too. The East Bengal striker, who two days ago said he hoped to play for Mohun Bagan, skipped practice for the second day running. According to Dr Shanti Ranjan Dasgupta, who visited him, the Nigerian was suffering from a bout of viral fever.

 ?He has said if he?s fully fit, he will come for Friday?s morning practice,? said Dr Dasgupta.

 Fever is only part of the problem. The primary reason behind Okoro?s outburst against East Bengal is the fact that the club deducted 15 days? salary after he returned late from Poland in the midst of the ongoing NFL. He did not even accept this month?s cheque from the club.

 While the club expects him to apologise for the damaging statement he made the other day, Okoro wants the management to pay his salary for those 15 days. It remains to be seen which party blinks first.

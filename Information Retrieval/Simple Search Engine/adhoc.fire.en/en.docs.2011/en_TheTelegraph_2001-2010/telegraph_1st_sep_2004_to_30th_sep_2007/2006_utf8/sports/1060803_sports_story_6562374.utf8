 World mark by Hansen 

Los Angeles: American Brendan Hansen broke his own world record in the mens 100m breaststroke at the US Swimming Championships in Irvine, California, on Tuesday. 

Hansen, the Olympic silver medallist in Athens, touched in at 59.13 seconds to better the time of 59.30 he set at the 2004 US Olympic trials. 

With a near capacity crowd at the William Woollett Aquatics Center cheering him on, Hansen raced home almost a second clear of Olympic teammate Scott Usher, who clocked in at 1:01.11. 

I didnt think Id come to nationals and break the 100, Hansen said. I thought the 200 was more in sight. I just wanted the opportunity. 

Hansen also holds the world record in the 200m breaststroke. (Reuters)

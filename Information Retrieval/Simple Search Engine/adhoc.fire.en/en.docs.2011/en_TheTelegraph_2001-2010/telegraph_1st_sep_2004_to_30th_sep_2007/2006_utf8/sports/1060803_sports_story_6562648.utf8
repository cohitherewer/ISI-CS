The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Its a dream debut, says Alvito 

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: An elated Alvito DCunha described his debut as East Bengal captain as dream come true, following his teams 2-0 victory over George Telegraph on Wednesday. 

Prior to this match, I was never given a chance to lead any side in my career. So I felt honoured when I was named East Bengal captain. And what more can you expect from your first match as captain? My team won, I got the MoM award Its a dream come true, Alvito, who has been playing for East Bengal for the past four seasons, said after the match. 

We didnt play well in the first-half. So, after going to the dressing room during the break, I reminded the boys about Mohun Bagans loss to Port Trust. We came back motivated and put up a more spirited display and it paid off in the end, Alvito, who scored the teams first goal, remarked. 

East Bengals Brazilian coach Carlos Roberto Pereira da Silva was also happy with the result. We enjoyed ball possession more than the opponents. We rectified our mistakes in the second-half and played good football. But we still have problems in some key areas which need to be addressed. Hopefully, our performance will keep on improving, the 60-year-old said. 

We are a young, promising side. We need to improve more on our fitness level to survive the league on such ground conditions, he added. 

It was also a special occasion for Ashim Biswas. The striker came in as a second-half substitute and scored within three minutes of his arrival. Scoring in the very first match is something special. I really want to prove my ability in East Bengal, he said. 

In another CFL match, Chirag United Sports Club beat Eastern Railway 1-0 at the Vidyasagar Stadium in Barasat on Wednesday. Ashim Das struck the winner in the 30th minute of the match.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 highs amp; lows 

 India scraped through by five 

 wickets with a ball to spare in Thursdays first ODI 

 in Kingston. Following are the statistical highlights:

 This is the first time in their ODI history since 1974 

 that India have the same number of wins as losses. Their 

 tally now stands at ? 296 wins, 296 losses, 24 no-results 

 and 3 ties.

 Chris Gayles 123 was his 12th ODI hundred. Only 

 Brian Lara (19) and Desmond Haynes (17) have made more 

 centuries for Windies in ODIs.

 This was the fifth three-figure score for Gayle in 

 a losing cause. He equals the tally of such hundreds by 

 Zimbabwean Alistair Campbell, Englishman Marcus Trescothick 

 and South African Herschelle Gibbs. In ODIs, only Sachin 

 Tendulkar has more such losing 100s ? ten!

 Rahul Dravid (105), too, registered his 12th career 

 hundred. He had made a 92 in his previous innings against 

 Pakistan in Abu Dhabi a month ago on 19 April 2006. Incidentally, 

 his last hundred came 17 innings ago ? a 103 not out against 

 Sri Lanka in Ahmedabad on November 6, 2005. 

 Dravid, who scored his third ODI century against the 

 West Indies, equalled Mark Waugh and Jacques Kallis, and 

 is one behind the record tally of most hundreds (four) 

 against the West Indies held by Herschelle Gibbs. 

 Dravid became the first Indian batsman to score an 

 ODI century in the Caribbean. Sunil Gavaskars 90 

 at Berbice in 1983, was the previous highest.

 Dravids century was the only fifth by a captain 

 against the West Indies. Only Australian Allan Border 

 (127* in 1985), Englishman Mike Atherton (127 in 1995), 

 Pakistani Rameez Raja (104* in 1995) and South African 

 Graeme Smith (103 in 2005) have made hundreds as captain 

 against the Windies. For the record, the previous highest 

 by an Indian captain against the West Indies was 88 by 

 Dilip Vengsarkar at St Johns in 1989.

 Mohammad Kaifs unbeaten 66, was his first over-fifty 

 score in the last 14 innings since his unbeaten 93 against 

 New Zealand in Harare on September 6, 2005. During this 

 period he managed to aggregate just 151 runs at 13.73 

 per innings, with a highest score of 46.

 India have extended their successful run-chase record 

 to 17 matches. Since September 2, 2005 India have not 

 lost a single ODI match while batting second.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Nesta still doubtful 

Duisburg: Defender Alessandro Nesta is still recovering from a right thigh injury and remains in doubt for Italys World Cup semi-final match with Germany. 

Nesta will have a new round of medical exams on Sunday. Italy face the World Cup hosts on Tuesday in Dortmund. Nesta has missed Italys last two games, a second-round win over Australia and Fridays 3-0 win over Ukraine in the quarter finals. 

Inexperienced Andrea Barzagli replaced Nesta against Ukraine. Marco Materazzi returns from a one-game suspension and could step in against Germany, as he did in the game with Australia. (AP)

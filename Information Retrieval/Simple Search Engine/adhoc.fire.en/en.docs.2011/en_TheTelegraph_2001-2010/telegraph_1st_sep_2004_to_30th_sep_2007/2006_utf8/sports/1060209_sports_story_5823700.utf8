 India cruise into super league

 - Under-19 World Cup

 Prasad wants to create a winning habit 

Colombo: India cruised into the super league as they crushed Scotland by eight wickets with 31 overs in hand in the ICC U-19 World Cup on Wednesday. 

They bowled the associate side out for just 112 and knocked off the required runs in 19 overs. India will now face Sri Lanka on Friday to decide the group C topper. 

It was a real stroll for the pre-tournament favourites who beat Namibia by nine wickets in their opening match, but coach Venkatesh Prasad said his players are under no illusion about the task ahead of them. 

I never thought these two games would be so easy, but I had a chat with the team after the match and said we have to be realistic, he said. 

We have to know the next few matches will not be like that, we are aware of that and we have to make sure our approach is right. 

Prasad said there was still plenty of room for improvement despite their success against Scotland. 

We still need to work on the amount of extras we are conceding, he admitted. 

I think it was one of Scotlands top-scores (there were 18 extras with only two batsmen topping that mark) and although the bowlers may have got carried away, we have to address it. 

From now on, we have to be more consistent, more disciplined, more accurate and make the batsmen play. 

Although Indias victory confirmed both they and Sri Lanka have qualified ahead of the meeting between the two sides, Prasad said he and his players were still targeting victory in that show-down. 

It is crucial because we would like to top the group and so play the second side in group B (including Australia, South Africa and the West Indies), he said. 

And we would like to make winning a habit, he added. 

Faced with their modest victory target, India cruised home with Man-of-the-Match Cheteshwar Pujara scoring an unbeaten 47, while captain Ravikant Shukla made 45. 

Our batsmen have not had enough middle practice which is why we changed the order here, but they are confident, and I am happy with what is happening, said Prasad.

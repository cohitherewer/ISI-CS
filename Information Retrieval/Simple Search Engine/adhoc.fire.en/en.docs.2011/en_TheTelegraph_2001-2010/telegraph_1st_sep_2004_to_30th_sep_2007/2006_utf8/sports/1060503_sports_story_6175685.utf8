 McGrath will play: Hilditch

 - Champions Trophy 

Melbourne: Sidestepping suggestions that Glenn McGrath should be rested in the lead up to the Ashes, Australia have said the ace paceman was well on course to take part in the Champions Trophy in India. 

Australias national chairman of selectors Andrew Hilditch said the pigeon was shaping up to make his international comeback after opting out of the cricket tours of South Africa and Bangladesh. 

I have spoken to Glenn since I became chairman, everything is progressing really well from a personal and family point of view and that is the most important thing, Hilditch was quoted as saying in a British daily on Tueaday. 

When asked whether McGrath would play in the Champions Trophy, Hilditch said, he is certainly back in the gym. I dont think hes started bowling yet but I think he is gearing himself up to be ready for that. 

McGrath was retained in Australias 25-player contract list announced on Monday. 

Captain Ricky Ponting had indicated recently that McGrath should play in English County to prepare for the coming Ashes in November and give Champions Trophy a miss.

 Jeev moves up to tied 28th

Okayama (Japan): Jeev Milkha Singh carded a sedate one-under 71 and moved one place up to tied 28th with a total of three-under 213 at the KSB Munsingwear Open Golf tournament here. 

Jeev now has rounds of 71, 70 and 71 over three days and a good finish can help him come closer to top-10 finish. 

Starting on the first, Jeev birdied the fifth, but gave the shot back on the next when he missed the fairway and had to scramble back. 

Jeev, who has been battling slight fever, birdied the 12th but once again the advantage was given away with a bogey on the 16th. He took a birdie on the 18th for the third successive day to come under par. 

Kiyoshi Miyazoto, who was in the bunch for tied third, shot a five-under 67, and moved to sole lead at 13-under 203. 

Tajima, Mizoguchi and Nogami were tied for second at 10-under, while Toru Taniguchi (67), Mamo Osanai (71) and Hideto Tanihara (71) were tied for fifth. Overnight co-leader Shingo Katayama (73) slipped to eighth. 

After just three appearances on the Japan Tour this season, Jeev is lying 18th on the money list, with his last two finishes being in top-10. He was 10th at Crowns and tied fifth at Japan PGA Championships. (PTI)

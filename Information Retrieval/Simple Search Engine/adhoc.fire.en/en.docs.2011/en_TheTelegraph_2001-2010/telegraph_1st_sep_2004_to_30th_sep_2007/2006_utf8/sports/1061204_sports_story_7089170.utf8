 Barcelona held by Levante

Madrid: Barcelona were denied a morale-boosting win ahead of their Champions League decider against Werder Bremen next week when they were held to a 1-1 draw away to Levante in the Primera Liga on Saturday. 

Portuguese midfielder Deco put Barcelona ahead with a curling free-kick that went in off the post just before the break. Levante levelled through defender Alvaro 13 minutes from time. 

Barcelona, with 30 points, moved two points clear of second-placed Sevilla. Real Madrid are third with 26. 

Atletico Madrid climbed to fourth with 24 points thanks to Argentine goalkeeper Leo Franco who saved two second-half penalties away to Real Betis, to secure a 1-0 victory. 

Argentine winger Luciano Galletti scored the only goal in the first half in a result that piles the pressure on Betis coach Javier Irureta. 

Below them an injury-ravaged Valencia fell 0-2 away at promoted Recreativo Huleva, their third straight league defeat. Recreativo went sixth on 22 points, while Valencia remained eighth with 18. 

In Serie A action, Inter Milan reinforced their position on top of Serie A by cruising to a 2-0 home win over Siena on Saturday. 

Goals by Argentine internationals Nicolas Burdisso and Hernan Crespo gave the leaders 36 points from 14 matches. 

Second-placed AS Roma stayed four points behind after Francesco Totti scored two penalties in a 2-1 victory over Atalanta. 

Siena were outclassed by Inter at the San Siro. They fell behind in the 11th minute when Burdisso dashed into the box to head in a corner. Crespo wrapped up the win four minutes later. 

Roma had a tougher time overcoming Atalanta at the Olympic Stadium. In the 19th minute Cristiano Doni cut the ball across the area for Massimo Donati to angle a shot goal-wards. Roma keeper Doni blocked his shot but could not prevent Riccardo Zampagna firing in the rebound. 

Gradually Roma took control and in the 50th minute Simone Loria tripped Simone Perrotta before Totti fired home his first penalty. Totti made it 2-1 after being upended by Giulio Migliaccio 12 minutes later.

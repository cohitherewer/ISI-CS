QUICK TAKES

Podolski to sue national broadcaster

 Berlin: Germany striker Lukas Podolski will take legal action against 

national broadcaster ARD over a local radio show that makes fun of him in a spoof 

Lukas Diary. Podolski has told the channel that he will not 

give them any more interviews until the segment on a Cologne station is pulled 

out. The 21-year-old feels the show makes him out to be an idiot.

 I have a sense of humour but these jokes are below the belt, he 

said on Monday. Im entitled to seek justice. The German football 

association (DFB) has given full backing to Podolski. Comedy is all well 

and good but this is attacking his dignity, Stenger said. ARD will 

get no more interviews with Podolski until this is sorted out.

Ghana FA apologises

 Wuerzburg: The Ghanaian Football Association apologised on Monday after 

one of its players waved an Israeli flag to celebrate their 2-0 win over the Czech 

Republic. Team spokesman Randy Abbey said the Ghanaian FA was not trying to take 

sides in the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians. Defender John Paintsil 

is very popular in Israel where he plays for Hapoel Tel Aviv and had wanted to 

acknowledge the Israeli fans who had travelled to Germany to support him, Abbey 

said.

 He is obviously unaware of the implications. We apologise to anybody 

who was offended and we promise that it will never happen again. He did not act 

out of malice for the Arab people or in support of Israel. He was naive... we 

dont need to punish him.

Ghana declares holiday

 Wuerzburg: Ghana has declared a half-day public holiday for Thursdays 

match against the US. Confident players, however, are already eager to take on 

Brazil in the second round. Ive seen the US play. They play good football 

and they will be tough, Chelsea midfielder Michael Essien said. Were 

ready to play anyone. Were not afraid to meet the Brazilians ... But first 

we have to deal with the USA.

Police mix-up

 Munich: The tale of a bungling World Cup ticket thief who got his just 

desserts turned out on Monday to be an accidental invention of German police. 

Munich police had released a statement about the audacious thief who 

snatched a womans handbag, found the ticket inside and sat down to watch 

Brazil play Australia on Sunday only to find himself next to her husband, 

who alerted the police. 

 But a police spokesman later said the statement had mixed up two different 

cases one of which did involve a Brazilian woman having her handbag and 

ticket stolen and the encounter between thief and husband never took place.

Responsible fans

 Berlin: Street cleaners in Leipzig got a pleasant surprise on Monday 

morning when they discovered South Korean fans had done their work for them. After 

celebrating the teams 1-1 draw against France late on Sunday, the fans cleared 

plastic cups and waste paper into garbage bags before the cleaners arrived for 

work at 5 am. It was great. It made our work much easier, said Ute 

Brueckner, a spokeswoman for the city cleaning service.

Saudi surprise

 Hamburg: Delighted Saudi Arabian soccer officials have awarded each 

player 100,000 riyals ($26,670) after the teams 2-2 draw against Tunisia 

 a prize they had initially promised only for a victory. They are 

appreciative of the way the team played, said Saudi team spokesman Ibrahim 

Al Goba. Theyre very pleased.

Troops quiz Klinsmann

 Berlin: German soldiers stationed in Afghanistan got a chance to put 

questions to Juergen Klinsmann on Monday. The first 15 minutes of Klinsmanns 

news conference was taken over by the German troops via a TV link. We hope 

we can give you many more games in the tournament to enjoy, Klinsmann told 

the soldiers in Kabul.

One solider asked Klinsmann whether he would continue as coach after the World 

Cup. Thats a very direct question, Klinsmann replied. But 

it depends a lot on what happens over the next few weeks.

Heart-stopping

 Cologne: World Cup soccer causes joy and despair and even ends marriages, 

but now doctors are studying whether the thrill of it all can be literally heart 

stopping. Previous research during international soccer tournaments has found 

an increase in the general incidence of heart attacks, particularly during tense 

matches.

In the new Fifa-approved study, researchers will receive blood samples from heart 

attack victims all over Germany watching football at the time of the attack, allowing 

them to look for traces of stress hormones which can clot the blood. First results 

are due in October.

Parliament sessions cut

 Dhaka: The Speaker of the Bangladesh Parliament may cut sessions short 

so that soccer-crazy politicians can follow the World Cup on television. I 

shall consider (the proposal) so that members can watch the World Cup matches, 

acting speaker Akhtar Hamid Siddiki told the House while presiding over a session 

on Sunday night.

Row over passports

 Dublin: Fifa is about to drop its demand for Northern Ireland soccer 

players to have British passports, an issue that divides Catholics and Protestants 

in the province, Irish foreign minister Dermot Ahern said on Monday. Fifa provoked 

Catholic outrage throughout Ireland last month when it ordered the Irish Football 

Association, which runs soccer in Northern Ireland, to have all players on the 

provinces squad travel using British passports.

Van der Sar milestone

 Freiburg: When the starting whistle blows for Wednesdays Argentina 

versus The Netherlands, Edwin van der Sar will have reached a milestone, whatever 

the result. The 35-year-old goalkeeper will earn his 112th international appearance 

and match the mark of 1990s Dutch defender Frank de Boer. With The Netherlands 

already assured a second-round berth, Van der Sar is bound to break the mark next 

weekend, most likely against Portugal or Mexico.

Police under probe

 Berlin: Police said they are investigating whether five officers used 

excessive force on a man whom they allegedly hit and kicked at the World Cup fan 

centre. The officers hit the man in the face early Sunday and kicked him in the 

stomach before leaving him. The 21 year old was treated for stomach pain before 

being released from hospital. The force was extreme, which is why they are 

under investigation, police spokesman Michael Merkle said. The department 

is investigating whether the officers intended to cause the man bodily harm, Merkle 

said.

Dreadlocks to stay

 Rotenburg: Trinidad and Tobago defender Brent Sancho is keeping his 

long dreadlocked hair even if it may have contributed to his teams loss 

to England. TV replays showed that Peter Crouch pulled on Sanchos dreadlocks 

to get in position to head in the first goal in Englands 2-0 win last Thursday. 

The referee did not see the infraction and allowed the goal to stand.

 I think that is the first time that has happened in my career, 

Sancho said. Probably 90 per cent of the time that gets called.

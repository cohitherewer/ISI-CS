 Liverpool cruise 

London: Liverpool kept in touch with Manchester United in the battle for second spot after cruising to a 3-1 win at Newcastle United on Sunday. 

Well-taken goals from Peter Crouch and Steven Gerrard put Liverpool in control before Shola Ameobi gave Newcastle hope just before half-time. 

Nerwcastle defender Jean-Alain Boumsong was sent off six minutes after the break for bundling over Crouch as he bore down on goal, allowing French striker Djibril Cisse to make it 3-1 from the penalty spot. 

Rafa Benitezs side remains third with 61 points from 31 games. Manchester United, who have played two fewer games, are on 63, 12 behind leaders Chelsea. 

Liverpool, who made six changes to the side that thrashed Fulham 5-1 in midweek, were rewarded for their bright start at St James Park when England striker Crouch scored after 10 minutes. 

The lanky forward stole in between Peter Ramage and Boumsong to head home Dutch defender Jan Kromkamps cross, his seventh league goal of the season.

Lahore: It was to have been a Media session with Team India, at the Pearl Continental on Tuesday morning, but became a press conference! Those in the business know the difference is significant and, if sources got it right, the players (at least most of them) werent comfortable about doing one-on-ones with the Fourth Estate. 

Hopefully, there wont be uneasiness of any kind when Shoaib Akhtar marks his run-up. 

Actually, with Harbhajan Singh, Yuvraj Singh and Gautam Gambhir deciding to make an early morning trip to Guru Nanaks birthplace, Nankana Saheb, all 16 players werent even there... Incidentally, Yuvraj (who couldnt go over on the last tour, two years ago) told The Telegraph: As an experience, its going to remain with me forever... The visit was enriching... 

The following, meanwhile, are excerpts from what was said at the session: 

Greg Chappell: Were fortunate to have three good openers on the tour... Its better worrying about which one to leave out rather than which one to play... The series wont also be a contest between the coaches... We prepare the players and, once the match starts, they take over... I regard Bob Woolmer very highly. 

Rahul Dravid: We batted well on the last tour (2003-04) and big runs on the board helped put Pakistan under pressure... Weve again got to bat well and create opportunities to exploit.... Weve got to play good, hard and attractive cricket... We see ourselves as cricketers (only) and anything else out of the tour is a bonus... Is a spin-off... This Pakistan team has seen a bit more success, but even weve come here with good performances. 

Zaheer Khan: Having made a comeback is nice... It was disappointing to be at home and not be part of a winning team... 

Anil Kumble: Cold conditions arent ideal for spinners, but Im sure my experience (of 16 years) will help... Danish Kaneria is an attacking leggie and has improved... He has really done well in a short span of time. 

V.V.S.Laxman: Consistency is most important. 

Irfan Pathan: I learnt a lot when I got dropped during the last Indo-Pak series, at home early last year... 

Virender Sehwag: Im in good form, but I havent been getting big runs... Doing so is a challenge and thats motivating me. 

Sachin Tendulkar: Some of the excitement of a series against Pakistan does rub off on the players... For both teams, its all about being competitive... The key to doing well is sticking to the basics. Also, as the opposition can come back after one bad day, one has to be consistent over all five days... I havent thought much about Shoaib as I focus more on our team... The Pakistan attack, though, isnt dependent solely on him... In any case, one (good) ball takes the wicket... Yes, weve been playing each other more often in recent years, but when we werent, people would ask why not? Today, theyre asking why?... The Boards have to find a balance... Have I begun thinking about the Test in Karachi (debut-venue, November 1989)? No... Thats far away... Right now, Im thinking about the first Test (Lahore)... Of course, I hope the Karachi Test is memorable... Challenges are always going to be there, but if I continue the way Ive played, Ill do a reasonable job. I dont have personal targets...

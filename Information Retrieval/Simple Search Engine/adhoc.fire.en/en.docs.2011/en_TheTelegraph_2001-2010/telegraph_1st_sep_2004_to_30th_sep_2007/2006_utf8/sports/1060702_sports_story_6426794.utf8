The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 We will fear nobody now

 The team has exceeded expectations with every game

 Guest Column 

 Lothar Matthaeus

I am absolutely delighted for 

 Germany. Before this tournament everyone thought we would 

 struggle, that there was no chance of us getting this far.

 But with this defeat of the mighty 

 Argentina everything is possible: we are two games away 

 from winning the World Cup, and with just a little bit of 

 luck on our side we will do it. It is an incredible change.

 Before the World Cup started, 

 German football was not in a great way. Our clubs had not 

 been doing well in the Champions League and the national 

 team was getting bad results. This team has shown they are 

 strong, though, that they can come back from difficulties. 

 Now they are on the right path.

 Above all, Jurgen Klinsmann has 

 made this team psychologically tough. The players were ready 

 to give their best and they did it for 120 minutes, never 

 giving up and behaving like they had lost. To come back 

 from 1-0 down shows that they were physically and psychologically 

 well prepared - that they were ready to go the distance. 

 There was real belief in that 

 performance. This is a team that people had lost faith in, 

 but now they have proved people wrong. That makes you resilient. 

 They gave their absolute best, and you can see that team 

 spirit is just so strong.

 If you win on penalties after 

 120 minutes, you need a bit of luck, but it does help if 

 you are in good condition. The fitter you are, the better 

 you are able to concentrate after two hours of play. In 

 many ways this game reminded me of England against Germany 

 in Turin at the 1990 World Cup. I can promise you the players 

 will be exhausted, but delighted.

 For the sake of the country, it 

 was very important for this team to stay in the World Cup. 

 I think last night must have been one of the biggest parties 

 thrown in Germany. People are just crazy for this team, 

 because they have exceeded expectations with every game.

 Now we are down to four teams. 

 I think all four who will play in the semi-finals can win 

 this competition - there is no question about that.

 Yet Germany have shown they will 

 not be beaten without giving an enormous struggle. 

 They will not be afraid of anyone 

 now, because Argentina had played the best football in this 

 tournament up until this game. Michael Ballack and his team 

 will fear nobody.

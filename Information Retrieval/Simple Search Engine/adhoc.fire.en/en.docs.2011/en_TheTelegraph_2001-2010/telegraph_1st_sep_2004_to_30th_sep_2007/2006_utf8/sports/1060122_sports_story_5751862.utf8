Calcutta: It was a mixed day for the Indians at the ONGC-ITF Junior Tennis tournament at the Dakshin Kalikata Sansad complex on Saturday. 

Indias Tejesvi Rao lifted the boys crown, while Ksenia Palkina of Kyrghyzstan claimed the girls title. The boys doubles title went to the duo of Rupesh Roy and Sumit Prakash Gupta. 

It took only 66 minutes for Rao to thrash Ivan Anikanov of Ukraine in straight set, the scoreline being 6-3, 6-4 in the final. 

Rao collected 60 ITF points. Anikanov, who created a flutter on Friday by defeating local boy Rupesh ? who is also the top seed ? to make it to the final, failed to deliver the goods on the crunch day. 

Both players opted for percentage tennis initially, and the solitary break in the first set came in the sixth game when Rao broke Anikanov despite the Ukranian serving two aces down the line. 

In the eighth game, Anikanov, serving at 2-5, was 15-40 down, but Rao could not convert the advantage and Anikanov managed to hold serve. 

The 17-year-old Indian, serving for the set, made no mistake and pocketed the set in 32 minutes. Rao said that he wishes to compete in a Grand Slam. 

Anikanov, who had earlier finished runners-up in the Chandigarh and Delhi meets, was also unlucky for the third time in the summit clash, and had to be content with 45 points. 

In the girls singles, top seed Palkina took three minutes less than an hour to defeat unseeded Korean Jung-Yoon Shin 6-2, 6-1. 

Quite unexpectedly, the match turned out to be a one-sided affair with Ksenia breaking her rival in the third and seventh games of the first set, before repeating the damage in the first and fifth games of the second set to complete the cakewalk. 

Rupesh had to be content by winning the doubles title, partnering compatriot Sumit. They got the better of the Rao-Akshay Bajoria pair 6-1, 6-3 in a 53-minute affair.

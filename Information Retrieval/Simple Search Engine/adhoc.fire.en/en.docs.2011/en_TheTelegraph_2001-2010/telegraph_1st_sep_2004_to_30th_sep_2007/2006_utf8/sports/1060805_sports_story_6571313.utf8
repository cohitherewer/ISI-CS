 I always look for more money 

 - Sharapovas earnings cross Federer, Beckham 

 Sharapova 

San Diego: Maria Sharapova has never been afraid of speaking her mind and the Russian freely admits that a desire to build on a successful start to her career is fuelled by the prospect of an ever-expanding bank account. 

Its never enough. I always look for more, Sharapova said at the Acura Classic on Thursday. Bring on the money. 

According to a recent survey by a sports magazine, the 19-year-old world No. 4 is the worlds highest-paid female athlete, earning an estimated $25.4m a year. 

Sharapova is also ranked No. 4 on the magazines international top-20 list, behind Formula One driver Michael Schumacher, MotoGP rider Valentino Rossi and soccer star Ronaldinho. 

However, she has moved ahead of Real Madrids David Beckham, baseball player Ichiro Suzuki and Swiss tennis player Roger Federer, who earns an estimated $22.1 m a year. 

Sharapova, who has endorsements from a string of multinational companies, says she will always find time for another major contract. When I was working my way to the top of tennis, I didnt say I was No. 2, I said I wanted to be No.1, she said. Theres no limit to how much money you can make. 

Sharapova has a single Grand Slam title to her name but says she would happily trade all of her millions for another three Grand Slam titles, but not just because of the tennis glory. 

Of course, because another three Slam titles will bring a lot more than $25 million, she said. They would be worth even more [than $100 million]. 

Sharapova said she was proud to be on the list, but would rather be known for what it took to get her there. Its a cool fact, but I dont live my life by looking at these facts, how much (money) I have won, she said. What tennis has brought me has been incredible. God gave me a talent, but it was up to me to play my part in it. 

I dont believe in just god-given talent, you have to work for everything you earn and I think the combination has helped me. 

During her three-week layoff between Wimbledon and San Diego, Sharapova trained in Los Angeles and went to see US mens player Andy Roddick compete at the ATP tournament there. 

Sharapova would not deny a report in the US media that the pair were dating, but had no comment. I dont discuss my private life, she said. (Reuters)

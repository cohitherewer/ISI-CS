The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Solar Falcon has edge 

 STAR RACER

 Solar Falcon

 Calcutta: Solar Falcon 

 is expected to have the measure of Notable Guest, Elusive 

 Glow and Amber Glory, his potential rivals in the seven-horse 

 field vying for the 1,200m Surfside, the main attraction 

 in Wednesdays seven-event race card. 

 At level terms, Solar Falcon has tested his hooves against some of the best three-year-olds. Now with a light-impost of 50kg on his back, and Gajender Singh to steer the Warrshan-Flyaway Bride colt, the Daniel David-trainee appears to have a thick edge over the rest.

 Robin Corners Acrostic is the other one who is strongly fancied to lift the 1,200m Magyar Handicap for horses in Class III.

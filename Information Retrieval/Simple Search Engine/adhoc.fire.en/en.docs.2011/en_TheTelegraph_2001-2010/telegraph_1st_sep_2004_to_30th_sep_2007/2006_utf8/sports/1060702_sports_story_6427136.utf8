The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 The boys deserved better: Eriksson

Gelsenkirchen: England coach Sven-Goran Eriksson 

 said defeat to Portugal in a World Cup penalty shootout 

 on Saturday was unfair and a painful end to his stint in 

 the job. 

 I dont think we deserved to lose...We 

 lost on penalties and Im really sorry about it. The 

 boys deserved better today, he told reporters. 

They fought enormously when it was 10 against 11 but anyhow we lost, added Eriksson. 

England were reduced to 10 men in the 62nd minute when Wayne Rooney was sent off. 

We are out of the tournament and it hurts...its very painful, he added. We practise penalties so much so I dont know what you can do more about that, he added. 

England lost 3-1 on penalties to Portugal after a scoreless 120 minutes. 

Portugal coach Luiz Felipe Scolari has steered Portugal to the semi-finals after winning the World Cup with his native Brazil four years ago. 

Scolari paid tribute to the way England responded to the loss of Rooney. Congratulations to England, with 10 players they were incredible, it was an electrifying match, he said. 

We didnt take advantage because we shot too much from outside the penalty area. England closed the way to goal very well and it was like playing 11 against 11. 

Portugal goalkeeper Ricardo became the first man to save three penalties in a World Cup finals shootout and then said his team was super happy. 

This was a game to win, it reached penalties once again. Thank God I managed to save three. We are super happy, the keeper, who plays for Sporting, said on Saturday.

 Azhar, Prabhakar in Pakistan with 

PCB consent

Karachi: The Pakistan Senior Cricket Board (PSCB) gave a new twist to the Veteran Cup controversy, claiming it was the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) which allowed Mohammed Azharuddin and Manoj Prabhakar to play in Pakistan. 

The Pakistan High Commission granted visas to the entire Indian team, including Azharuddin and Prabhakar, to travel to Pakistan for the one-day matches on the advice of the PCB, PSCB president and chief executive Fawad Ijaz told a news conference. 

Azharuddin, a former Indian captain who played 99 Tests and 334 ODIs, is serving a life ban from playing Tests and first class cricket for his alleged involvement in match-fixing while Prabhakar was slapped with a five-year ban in 2000. 

When we applied for the no-objection certificate with the PCB, the names of the Indian team were clearly stated. The PCB issued us the no-objection certificate on the basis of which the Indians were issued visas in New Delhi, Ijaz said. 

Ijazs remark came in the wake of PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan disassociating his establishment from the Indian duos visit. 

Meanwhile, Azharuddin said he wanted to get his name cleared from match-fixing charges as he was fighting his case in the court. I have no hopes of playing for India. But I want to get my name cleared, he said. 

However, he said he could not be banned from all cricketing activities. I cannot play in BCCI or ICC- approved or sanctioned tournaments. Veterans cricket is a different body that is neither controlled nor governed by the BCCI or ICC, Azharuddin said. 

Azharuddin hit 82 and guided India to a three-wicket victory over Pakistan in the first one-dayer here on Sunday. 

 BRIEF SCORES 

Pakistan 253/6 in 39 ovs (Azam Khan 71, Aamer Sohail 64). India 256/7 in 39 ovs (Azharuddin 82, Amarjeet Singh 42; Ijaz Fakih 3/41, Zahoor Elahi 2/33). India won by 3 wkts.

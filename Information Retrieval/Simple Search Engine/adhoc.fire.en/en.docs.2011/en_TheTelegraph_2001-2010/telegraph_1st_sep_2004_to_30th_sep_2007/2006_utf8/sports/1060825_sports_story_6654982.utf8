 Saina Nehwal bows out

New Delhi: Saina Nehwal bowed out of the Korean Open Badminton Championship after a straight games defeat against Thailands Soratija Chansrisukot in the third round in Seoul on Thursday. 

Saina, who was the last Indian left in the draw, went down 21-10, 21-19 in 28 minutes. The teenager from Hyderabad had been in fine form in the tournament so far but failed to quell the challenge of Chansrisukot. 

Indias challenge at the six star event, thus, came to an end as other contenders, including national champion Anup Sridhar and India No. 2 Arvind Bhat, had lost in earlier rounds. (PTI)

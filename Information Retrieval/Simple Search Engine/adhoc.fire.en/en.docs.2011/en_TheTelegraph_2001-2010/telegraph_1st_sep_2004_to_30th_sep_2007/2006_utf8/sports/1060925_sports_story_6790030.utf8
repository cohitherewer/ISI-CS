Calcutta: The curtains came down on the second edition of the Sunfeast Open after a week of hectic activity. Activity which wasnt only about tennis. It was about competition and bonhomie, about excitement and laughter. And a lot of activities off-court as well. 

Heres a flashback of what happened over the past seven days: 

MONDAY 

On court highlights: Top seed Martina Hingis blew away Melinda Czink to smithereens, almost, as if to take revenge for Sania Mirza who had been knocked out by the Hungarian in the second round last year. Kaia Kanepi, the sixth seed, fell to Thai Tamarine Tanasugarn. Hingis quote, Mahesh is the best partner Ive ever had, captured Indian hearts. Not that there was any dearth of fans here anyway. 

Off court highlights: Sania Mirza visited St Thomas Girls School and the Heritage School, to laud them for participating in the Sunfeast Open Trophy design contest. She caused a stampede, thus laying to rest any doubts if at all there were any of her diminishing appeal. She looked a star, and answered questions with a wisdom belying her 19 years. 

Days best: Hingis beat Czink 6-1, 6-2. 

TUESDAY 

On court highlights: Sania cruised past qualifier Rushmi Chakravarthy in 51 minutes while three seeds No. 2 Karolina Sprem, No. 3 Yuliana Fedak and No. 8 Anastassia Rodionova made their exit. 

Off court highlights: Hingis, accompanied by Czink, Aravane Rezai, Tanasugarn, Sandy Gumulya and Liezel Huber, visited the Missionaries of Charity. Hingis donated $ 20,000. The presence of Sourav Ganguly, cheering Sania, was the icing on the cake. I told Sourav that the crowd will go berserk if they see him in the stands, said Sania. And did they! 

Days best: Sania bt Rushmi 6-0, 6-4. 

 WEDNESDAY 

On court highlights: The Swiss Miss easily manoeuvred her way into the quarter finals, while the Indian sensation advanced into doubles quarter finals with South African partner Liezel Huber. 

Off court highlights: It was an evening of fashion gala at the players hotel where ten of the participants including Czink, Galina Voskoboeva, Sunitha Rao sashayed the ramps, dressed in Kiran Uttam Ghosh autumn-winter line. 

Days best: Hingis beat Tzipora Obziler 6-2, 7-5. 

THURSDAY 

On court highlights: There were no surprises as Sania closed out Sandra Kloesel 7-5, 6-3 to reach the last-eight stage. 

Off court highlights: Hingis left the imprints of her hand at the Walk of Fame in the Millennium Park, thereby leaving a part of her here forever. 

Come afternoon and all the journalists at the Press Room were made MTV bakras. A man, claiming to be a journalist of a Gujarati daily, alleged ill-treatment by the organisers and demanded justice. As the mediamen rose in support, the joke was revealed and all had a big laugh. 

Days best: Iroda Tulyaganova beat Casey Dellacqua 6-3, 6-2. 

FRIDAY 

On court highlights: Tournament moving towards the climax with Sania outgunning Rezai 6-4, 7-5 and Hingis getting past Tanasugarn 7-5, 6-2 to set up the much-anticipated Super Saturday. Sania and Liezel also made it to the doubles semi-finals. 

Off court highlights: Journalists battled it out at the media quiz which saw as many as 30 entries! 

Days best: Sania beat Rezai 6-4, 7-5. 

SATURDAY 

On court highlights: The much-hyped semi-final turned out to be a bit of a disappointment, as the Indian idol was no match for the five-time Grand Slam winner. Sania and Liezel, of course, provided some consolation by advancing to the doubles final. 

Off court highlights: Once again, the Prince of Calcuttas presence in the stands, cheering to no avail. 

Days best: Hingis beat Sania 6-1, 6-0. 

 SUNDAY 

On court highlights: The Hingis-Olga Poutchkova final. The first set was over in 18 minutes before one had even settled down. In the second, Olga provided a bit of a fight but she was hardly a match for the world No. 9. Sania-Liezel duo also clinches the doubles crown. 

Off court highlights: Imprint of Sanias hands at the Walk of Fame. 

Days best: Hingis beat Poutchkova 6-0, 6-4.

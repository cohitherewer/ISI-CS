 Rooney may face more action

Berlin: England striker Wayne Rooney could face further punishment after a Fifa disciplinary committee investigates his red card in the World Cup quarter final loss to Portugal. 

Fifa communications director Markus Siegler on Sunday said the disciplinary committee was reviewing Rooneys ejection and also had widened its investigation into the fracas that followed Argentinas quarter final loss to Germany, opening a case against Argentine midfielder Maxi Rodriguez. 

All Germanys players had been cleared, he said, although the panel was considering a case against German and Argentine officials and already had started an investigation into Argentina defender Leandro Cufre. 

Siegler declined to say if the Rooney investigation related to him stamping on Ricardo Carvalhos groin in the 62nd minute of Saturdays quarter final or for shoving Portugal forward Cristiano Ronaldo soon after that. 

 Wayne Rooney got a direct 

 red card so he will automatically be suspended, Siegler 

 said. It will be a disciplinary case. If you ask why 

 he was sent off, I refer to law 12, article two, on violent 

 conduct to make that clear. (AP)

 Hilditch is new chairman 

Melbourne: Former Australian Test player Andrew Hilditch was named as the chairman of selectors by Cricket Australia (CA) on Friday. 

Hilditch, 49, who has been a selector for 10 years, replaced Trevor Hohns, who resigned on Tuesday to devote more time to his sports equipment company. Other members of CAs selection panel include former players David Boon and Merv Hughes. 

Hohns reign spanned one of the most successful periods in Australian cricketing history. He helped to pick the worlds top-ranked Test and one-day teams. 

Hilditch played 18 Tests and eight ODIs for Australia. A qualified solicitor, he made his Test debut against England on February 10, 1979, and his last outing was on November 8, 1985 against New Zealand. Both his Test centuries came in a space of three innings ?? against the West Indies and England in 1984-85. 

He scored 1,073 runs in 34 Test innings at an average of 31.55, with his highest score of 119. In ODIs, he scored 226 runs with a high score of 72 and an average of 28.25. 

Hilditch was part of a three-member referees commission, set up by the International Cricket Council (ICC) in 2002 following a dispute with the Indian board over penalties imposed on six Indian cricketers during an India-South Africa Test match. 

A CA spokesman said a new selector would eventually be named to replace Hilditch on the panel. (AFP)

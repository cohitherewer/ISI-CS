 Hope to leave SA unscathed: Buchanan

Johannesburg: Australian coach John Buchanan is confident his sides six-week South Africa tour will pass without any contentious issues both on or off the field. 

We will take every possible precaution against any disciplinary incidents but we hope to leave South Africa unscathed, Buchanan said at the team hotel in Johannesburg on Tuesday. 

Our recent record has been exemplary, with just the odd incident, and the management will reiterate the same approach, but we wont be doing anything more than normal. 

The tourists have encountered trouble with crowds in South Africa before and claims that several in the Proteas side were racially abused during the recently completed Australia tour have only added to the tension. 

Nasty things have been said ... I have lost respect for one or two of their players, South Africa wicketkeeper Mark Boucher was quoted as saying in a reputed cricket magazine this week. 

I hope our public give them a bit of stick, because weve taken a serious amount. In the past our crowds havent been too great with them, but trust me, were not going to sit back and say shame, poor things. 

Australian captain Ricky Ponting offered a different perspective. 

There is no dislike between the two teams and the cricket this (southern hemisphere) summer has been played in very good spirits and Im sure it will continue in that manner, he said 

Wicketkeeper and vice-captain Adam Gilchrist said his team were delighted to be in South Africa and were not expecting excessive abuse or provocation. (Reuters)

 Ganga keeps WI in hunt

 - Gul, Kaneria bag 3 wickets each

Karachi: West Indies opener Daren Ganga played a lone hand of 77 to keep his team alive in the third and final Test against Pakistan on Tuesday. 

Ganga steered the West Indies to 191 for six at close on day two with his defiant and unbeaten knock on a slow, low bouncing pitch on which Umer Gul and Danish Kaneria shared six wickets. 

Ganga, who has faced 214 balls and batted for 308 minutes, ensured his team were not rolled over by the home side, who were bowled out for 304 one hour into the morning session. 

After a solid 51-run opening stand between Ganga and Chris Gayle, who stroked his way to 40 from 54 balls, the West Indies were rocked by pacer Gul who took his three wickets in 10 balls. 

Ganga revived the visitors from a precarious 51 for three with a 63-run stand with Shivnarine Chanderpaul for the fourth wicket, the latter picking the gaps beautifully to score 36 from 49 balls with seven fours. 

Earlier, Corey Collymore finished with three for 57 as Pakistan lost their last three wickets for 47 runs, the last-wicket pair of Gul (26) and Kaneria (7) putting on 32 valuable runs. 

Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul-Haq, meanwhile, described the pitch as substandard. This is a very difficult wicket and it is going to get worse to bat on as the game progresses. (Reuters)

 Sourashish: Dismissing Sachin my best moment 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Getting the nod for the Challenger Trophy a few days ago was by far the best moment for Bengal off-spinner Sourashish Lahiri. But all that has now taken a backseat. 

If Lahiri is to be believed, getting Sachin Tendulkars wicket in the Challenger has surpassed his previous best feeling. Getting Sachins wicket is so far the most special moment of my life, Lahiri told The Telegraph on Wednesday. 

Lahiri played only one match for India Green. I didnt try too many things against the seasoned India Blue batsmen. In all, it was an amazing experience in Chennai, he said. 

Lahiri also seemed satisfied with his bowling. I may have gone for a few runs (68 in eight overs), but I am satisfied with the way things have gone, Lahiri added. 

The lanky offie now has been rewarded with another call-up --- for the Rest of India side. He is determined to make most of the opportunity.

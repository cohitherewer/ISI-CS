 SA rest Gibbs for last 2 Tests

Durban: Herschelle Gibbs has been dropped from the South African squad for the remaining two Tests against New Zealand, Cricket South Africa (CSA) said on Saturday. 

Opening batsman Gibbs, who has played 77 Tests, scored 364 runs at an average of 30.33 in 12 innings against Australia this season. 

Herschelle and I had a meeting on Friday and we agreed that a break and a fresh start next season will do him a world of good, a CSA release quoted selection convenor Haroon Lorgat as saying. 

Gibbs departure could see Hashim Amla return to the Test side after playing the last of his three Tests against England in Cape Town in January 2005. (Reuters)

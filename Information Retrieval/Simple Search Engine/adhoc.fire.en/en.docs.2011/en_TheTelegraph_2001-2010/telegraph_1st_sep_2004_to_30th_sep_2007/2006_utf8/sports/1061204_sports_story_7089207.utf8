 Bravo returns home 

Rawalpindi: The West Indies allrounder Dwayne Bravo has left the tour of Pakistan before the one-day series for personal reasons, the team management said on Sunday. 

Bravo sought and received the permission of the selectors to return home to be with persons close to him who are unwell, media manager Imran Khan told reporters. 

Bravos place in the five-match series has been taken by paceman Corey Collymore, who was drafted in from the Test side. 

Bravo travelled back to the Caribbean on Friday evening and will miss the entire five match series. We ask that Bravos privacy is respected at this time, the official added. 

The 23-year-old Bravo, who has played 56 one-dayers, did not have an outstanding Test series but managed to contribute with bat and ball. 

Experienced batsman Ramnaresh Sarwan will also miss the series after he fractured his right foot in the final Test on Friday.

 Aussies not getting carried away

Oehringen: One day after another compelling comeback at the World Cup, it was back to reality Friday for Australia. 

Having drawn 2-2 with Croatia to edge their opponent for a second-round berth, Australia face Italy next on Monday. 

Lets not get too carried away with ourselves. We know were going into this game as massive underdogs once again, defender Craig Moore said. 

But Australias top soccer official was more outspoken about the Socceroos chances. 

We dont want to get ahead of ourselves... but Italy, on form, are beatable, said John Neill, chief executive officer of Football Federation Australia. 

And then after that, who knows? Look, we have form. We havent had a bad game and I think we can play even better.

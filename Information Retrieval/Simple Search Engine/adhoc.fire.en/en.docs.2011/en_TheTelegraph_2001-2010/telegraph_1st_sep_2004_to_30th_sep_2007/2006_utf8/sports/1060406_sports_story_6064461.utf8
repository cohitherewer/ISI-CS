 Narang shoots into top spot

 - Would be happy if I stay in top 10 till Beijing Olympics

New Delhi: For Gagan Narang, Wednesday was a memorable day. Moments after he was felicitated by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh for his superb display at the Melbourne Commonwealth Games, came the official announcement of his elevation to the top spot in the ISSF rankings. 

Narang, who won four gold medals at Melbourne, shot up 18 places in the 10-m air rifle rankings thanks to his gold medal showing in the World Cup at China. He is the third Indian to have grabbed the top spot after Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore and Anjali Bhagwat, who too were once toppers in their respective events. 

The world ranking in shooting is more sensitive than the world ranking in other sports, because if you miss out even one competition, your ranking shoots down, said Narang on his latest achievement. 

I would be happy if I stay in the top 10 till my run up to the Beijing Olympics. 

Abhinav Bindra also jumped three places to climb up to the 15th spot after his ninth place finish at the World Cup in China, while Kuheli Ganguli jumped straight from zero to the 20th spot due to her eighth place finish in China. 

Meanwhile, Samresh Jung has called for liberal procedures for import of shooting sport equipment as it would help Indians to excel even further in the game on world stage. 

I would like the import policies for shooting equipment to be a bit more liberal so that we do not have to wait long for them, Jung said after meeting Manmohan at his residence along with fellow medal winners at Melbourne.

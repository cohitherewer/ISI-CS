Calcutta: The script, at the Salt Lake Stadium, was nothing different from that of the previous day. 

If it was local giants East Bengal the other day, on Friday it was the fate of Mohammedan Sporting another home team who was made to bite the dust with the same scoreline (0-1). However, unlike the previous day, when the boisterous crowd kept on jeering East Bengal, there was reprieve for Mohammedan Sporting with a sparse turn-out for the floodlit encounter. 

With the loss to a young Chinese club Shenzen FC in the Group B encounter, Mohammedan Sportings chances of staying alive in the 112th IFA Shield, now depend on the Shenzen-Mohun Bagan result. Mohammedan Sporting and Mohun Bagan played out a goalless draw in the opener. 

Having played a drab first-half, where the city club missed a few chances, Subhas Bhowmicks side got a rude awakening after the lemon break when Ma Xiao Lei did not falter to convert a Wu Lei header in the 63rd minute. Following his score, the 19-year-old, who was the most valuable player in an eight-nation under-17 tournament in Iran, did a Sourav Ganguly act, removing his jersey and flinging it in the air. 

The match, incidentally, was a reality check for the black-and-white brigade. Consider this: Experience-wise, Mohammedan Sporting were definitely ahead of their Chinese opponents, who were mostly in their teens or early-20s. Also, the home factor, which the city club failed to exploit. 

As the match progressed, their home advantage was quite evident, having adjusting themselves better to the bounce of the ground, as the Xiang Jun-led team struggled in the first-half. 

Chances did come in Mohammedans way in abundance. First, it was as early in the sixth minute when Harvinder Singh failed to capitalise on a fine Raman Vijayan pass. If that was not enough, two minutes later, an easy freekick went wayward, deflected off a Shenzen defender. The Harvinder-Raman duo again floundered one minute before the changeover when the latters header was off the target. 

Hanging on an even keel, Mohammedan Sporting again got a chance to open their account in the 56th minute. The culprit, this time, too was Harvinder who ballooned the ball up the goalpost, instead of finding the net. Five minutes later, Subhas Bhowmick brought him off the field, substituting with K. Kulothungan. 

But it did not help the cause. In fact, two minutes later, the Lei force barged into the Mohammedan Sporting territory to earn the Chinese outfit full points. The goal was enough to boost the confidence of the rusty-looking Shenzen team, who were a notch above their opponents in the second-half.

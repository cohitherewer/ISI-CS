Hanover: Two goals by centre-back Bartosz Bosacki gave Poland a 2-1 victory over Costa Rica in their final Group A game on Tuesday and sent a huge Polish support home with some consolation for an early World Cup exit. 

A Ronald Gomez free kick put Costa Rica in front against the run of play in the 24th minute before Bosacki got on the end of corners from Maciej Zurawski and Jacek Krzynowek either side of half time. 

They were Bosackis first goals in international football. 

Both teams head home after defeats by Ecuador and Germany in their first two games in the finals Group A. 

The Poles lacked the urgency that marked their brave performance against Germany last week and apart from some incisive runs by Ireneusz Jelen, they struggled to press the Costa Rican defence early on. 

All that changed after Gomez gave Costa Rica the lead with a free-kick from 20 metres out, drilled through a hole in Polands wall and between the legs of goalkeeper Artur Boruc. 

The Poles poured forward more aggressively and finally got their reward for six first half corners when Bosacki volleyed home off the bar in the 33rd minute. 

Bosacki grabbed his second with a powerful header from close range after climbing above Paulo Wanchope to connect with a corner in the 66th.

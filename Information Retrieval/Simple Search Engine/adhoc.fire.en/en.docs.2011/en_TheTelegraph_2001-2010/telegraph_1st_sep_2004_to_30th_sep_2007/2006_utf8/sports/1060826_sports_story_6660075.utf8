The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Match Referee should have played a bigger role

 - THE OVAL FIASCO 

 - Difficult to say whether I would have done an inzamam: Kapil

Calcutta: The dust hasnt settled on the Inzamam-ul Haq versus Darrell Hair row (it wont in the near future, too), but cricket must quickly learn from what happened at The Oval. 

Thats the belief of Kapil Dev, Asias first World Cup-winning captain and a truly talismanic allrounder. 

The lesson, actually, is simple: That no individual be it Hair or Inzamam can spoil the game The show has to go on and absolutely nobody is bigger than the sport, Kapil told The Telegraph. 

Speaking on Friday night, shortly after arriving in the city on a private visit, he added: Im disappointed that the Match Referee (Mike Procter) didnt play as big a role as he should have last Sunday 

He ought to have asserted his authority and advised the umpires hang on, lets check again before the bails got taken off for what became the last time in that Test His role also needs to be looked into. 

Kapil declined to comment on Hairs rather sensational e-mail to the International Cricket Council (ICC), made public while he was on way to Calcutta. 

I dont know enough about it, so its best not to react, he said. 

Asked if, in a similar situation, he would have done an Inzamam and not taken his team back immediately after that infamous tea break, Kapil smiled: Difficult to say Today, my thinking on a lot of issues is different from what it was when I was playing Perhaps, I would have 

Equally, perhaps, I would have announced lets make a token protest and, then, try and win the Test That, in my view, would have been the perfect statement to make It would have been telling 

Kapil felt that while Hairs decision-making had been good. he was prone to behaving like a policeman. 

You cant fault Hair with his decision-making He has been good, but an umpire must conduct the game well, too He has to create an environment where both teams are happy Hair never did that, preferring instead to act like a policeman 

Im sure a Dickie Bird or David Shepherd would have handled the situation very differently The players liked them and nobody would mind being gently ticked off, he pointed out. 

Kapil recalled having had a face-off of sorts with Hair during Indias 1999-2000 tour of Australia when he was the coach. 

I dont remember the match, but he warned Sourav (Ganguly) for running on to the wicket and did so in the manner of a teacher. I told him quite unambiguously that his job was to umpire and not teach! I had to make that point 

Asked whether he endorsed Pakistan coach Bob Woolmers call to abolish Law 42.3 (pertaining to changing the condition of the ball), Kapil replied: The views of one person dont count I mean, Abdul Qadir has suggested that chucking be legalised Thats his opinion, nothing more Frankly, by making such a call, Woolmer has implied that 

I think the ICC should do whats best for cricket Of course, there maybe a debate 

Smiling again, he added: Funnily, its only in the last decade-and-half that ball tampering has become such an issue Uske pehle koi baat hi nahin karta tha People started pointing fingers at Pakistan (in 1992) and, then, every team began perfecting the reverse swing 

The phenomenon has been well documented.

 Bob Woolmer laments ban 

Karachi: Coach Bob Woolmer has also lamented the lengthy bans on Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Asif and said the two bowlers should hire the services of world anti-doping agency experts to go through their appeals. 

I think the WADA description on the usage of nandrolone remains controversial as in some cases the players had to be acquitted despite the fact the quantity of the medicine in the sample was 24 mg/ml compared to 13.07 for Asif and 14.0 for Shoaib, Woolmer said. He also admitted the team would suffer from the verdict as both players were the spearheads of the team. 

But former Test bowler Jalaluddin appreciated the decision saying the players needed to behave more responsibly and an example had to be set for the future. World Cups will come and go but what is important is that we have a proper cricket system in place with the required discipline. 

Meanwhile, controversies and poor form could take its toll on the Pakistani players as several of them might find themselves out of the Test squad for the upcoming home series against the West Indies. (PTI)

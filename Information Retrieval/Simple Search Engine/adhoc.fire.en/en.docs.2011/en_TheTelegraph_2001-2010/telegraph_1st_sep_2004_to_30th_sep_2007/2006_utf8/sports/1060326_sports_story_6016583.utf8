The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 First-ever series sweep by Bangla 

Fatullah: Bangladesh opener Rajin Saleh scored an unbeaten century to lead his country to a 4-0 sweep of the one-day International series against Kenya on Saturday. 

Chasing a winning target of 233, the hosts eased to 237 for three in 41.3 overs with Salehs record 108 not out leading the way as skipper Habibul Bashar helped complete Bangladeshs first ever series sweep with an unbeaten 64. 

The pair put on an unbroken fourth-wicket partnership of 175 after the hosts had slumped to 62 for three, setting a new record for any partnership by Bangladesh in a one-dayer. 

Salehs total was also the highest score for any Bangladeshi batsman in a one-day International, improving on Mehrab Hossains 101 against Zimbabwe in Dhaka in 1998.

 Hockey greats lament lack of recognition

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: The Union government on Friday got flak over its attitude towards former hockey stalwarts. 

Some of the games greats of yesteryears said they were treated shabbily and their needs were not looked after. 

R.S. Bhola called upon the government to come forward and help the needy players, while Ashok Kumar said it was time to honour those who brought laurels to the country. 

They were speaking at a meeting organised to condole the death of former India captain and goalkeeper Shankar Laxman. 

Bhola pointed out that Laxman was lucky to receive an Arjuna and a Padmashri within a few years after retiring. While a former India cricketer got both the awards during the first year of his international career, none of the members of the gold-winning 1964 Olympic hockey team, barring Laxman, was given the awards. 

Ashok Kumar regretted that only Rs 25,000 was given to Laxman after he was diagnosed with having gangrene. 

We believe Laxman is the greatest Indian hockey player after my father (Dhyan Chand). A goalkeeper leading the national side was unthinkable those days. He was simply a spectacular custodian. Still, he did not receive proper recognition.

 Quick Takes

 Brazil will retain title, 

 says Michel Platini

 Berlin: Former French 

 captain Michel Platini, twice a World Cup semi-finalist, 

 has tipped defending champions Brazil to retain their title.

 For me there is one team 

 that can win the World Cup ? Brazil, he said. But 

 there are a lot of other teams that will be difficult to 

 beat ? Argentina, Germany, France, Mexico, England, The 

 Netherlands, Croatia, Spain and Italy, for example.

 Brazil have so many great 

 attacking players ? Ronaldinho, Adriano, Ronaldo and Kaka 

 and, in defence, they have strength too with people like 

 Cafu, Cicinho and Roberto Carlos.

 Platini said he was not familiar 

 enough with the African teams to know whether any of them 

 had a chance to make a breakthrough at the finals.

 Croatia in holiday mode

 Zagreb: Nearly a third 

 of Croatias workforce will go on vacation during the 

 World Cup to be able to watch their national team, local 

 media reported on Thursday. Some 500,000 of the Balkan nations 

 1.4 million workers had saved up their annual holidays for 

 the event, which kicks off on Friday. Since Croatians 

 traditionally use June to go on vacation... All companies 

 have already included that in their budget, so there will 

 be no losses, a trade union official said.

 Jumbo kick-off

 Chiang Mai: Eight elephants 

 in northern Thailand have kicked off their own World Cup, 

 painting their faces in team colours and staging their own 

 tournament with a jumbo-sized ball.

 Four teams with two elephants 

 each are representing Brazil, Germany, Italy and Spain at 

 the Mae Sa Elephant Camp outside the city of Chiang Mai. 

 The elephants can use either their front or rear feet to 

 kick the ball into a goal guarded by another elephant.

 We had elephant football 

 matches during the previous World Cup four years ago, and 

 we found tourists really like it, the camps 

 director said.

 Vietnam wager

 Hanoi: When the World Cup 

 kicks off in Germany next week, millions of Vietnamese will 

 combine two national passions ? football and betting. Bars 

 screening the matches, many of them after midnight, are 

 tripling their beer and food stocks, anticipating a sustained, 

 enthusiastic and noisy onslaught in one of the worlds 

 most football-crazed nations.

 But it is not just the legal economy 

 that hopes to make a killing from the global game. Vietnams 

 many illegal and wildly popular betting syndicates are also 

 hoping to multiply their profits.

 I enjoy football very much, 

 but watching a match without betting is so dull, said 

 Nguyen Hai Thang, 39, who says he spends about 600,000 dong 

 ($37) a day on gambling, nearly 20 times Vietnams 

 average daily wage.

 NRI effort

 London: A non-resident 

 Indian musician here has composed a Bollywood style Hindi 

 song to boost the morale of the England soccer team. Sunny 

 Kapoor, a radio presenter and programme controller, has 

 written the song ? Khelo Khelo Josh Me Khelo, Germany Se 

 World Cup Lelo ? in just a day to inspire David Beckhams 

 men to repeat Englands success of 1966.

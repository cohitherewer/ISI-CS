The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Dravids decision to open helped our cause

Even after defeating India, I have the highest respect for them as opponents. They played tough cricket and tried as hard as they could but the fact of the matter is that they could not handle the pressure as well as we did. However, I would certainly say here that Rahul Dravids decision to open the innings in the series did help our cause. Dravid is an excellent one-down batsman, probably the best in the world. But there is always a difference between an opener and a one-down batsman, even if the No. has to be at the crease on the second ball of the innings. 

The mindset and approach of an opener is very different from a No. 3 batsman. I can say this with conviction because I have batted in both positions, in one-dayers. 

Dravid managed to give his best in Lahore and Faisalabad probably because the conditions were easier. But when the conditions and match situation changed in Karachi, he struggled and, in both innings, became the first batsman to be dismissed. 

When a batsman of the calibre of Dravid becomes the first casualty, the opponents see a window of opportunity and if the opponents are as opportunistic as Pakistan, they would hardly provide India a comeback chance. 

It would not be an exaggeration if I say I am the most satisfied man on the planet right now. It is the dream of any Pakistan captain to win a series against India and doing it so convincingly makes me even more happy. 

I am particularly pleased with the improvement we have made since we lost to India at home in 2004. Then, we were an inexperienced team and captaincy was also new to me. But now, we are a more experienced side and know how to handle the pressure. 

To me, handling the pressure and performing in pressure situations has been the decisive factor in the series that was decided in Karachi after two high-scoring draws. 

In 2004, we were in a rebuilding phase after the disastrous 2003 World Cup campaign and the batsmen, in particular, did not know where they would bat or what was their role. For example, in the one-dayers, we were playing Shahid Afridi at the top of the order but didnt consider him for the Tests. But now, Shahid is an integral component of our side in both forms. He knows he has to bat in the middle, what is expected of him and how he can live up to those expectations. 

Moreover, even after playing on batsmen-friendly pitches in Lahore and Faisalabad, our batsmen were quick to adjust to the seamer-friendly wicket in Karachi. 

Cricket is all about learning fast, and we have proved to be better learners. We can no longer be branded a one-man team. We won the Bangalore Test without Shoaib Akhtar, Lahore Test (against England) without Younis Khan and this one in Karachi without me. Its all about self-belief and self-confidence, and at the moment we are rich in that. Of course, winning and that, too, against top teams has helped us a lot.

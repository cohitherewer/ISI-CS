 Pak pack punch after Pathan hattrick

Karachi: Kamran Akmal struck a century to lead a remarkable fightback following Irfan Pathans sensational hattrick as Pakistan made amends for their low first innings total by sending four top Indian batsmen back to leave the series-deciding Test evenly poised here on Sunday. 

In an opening day straight out of a Bollywood potboiler, the hosts were reduced to 39 for six before Akmal ? ably supported by Abdul Razzaq and Shoaib Akhtar ? salvaged the situation with 113 and steered his team to a respectable 245. 

Later in the day, the Indians were themselves in a spot of bother, struggling at 74 for four at stumps. The day witnessed the fall of 14 wickets on a grassy and seaming track at the National Stadium. Sourav Ganguly (9) and Yuvraj Singh (7) were at the crease after the visitors lost the wickets of captain Rahul Dravid (3), Virender Sehwag (5), V.V.S. Laxman (19) and Sachin Tendulkar (23) to surrender the advantage. 

The series-decider got off to a sensational start as Pathan (5/61) sent back Salman Butt, the in-form Younis Khan and Mohammed Yousuf in the fourth, fifth and sixth ball of his over to become only the second Indian to record a Test hattrick. The previous record was of Harbhajan Singhs against Australia in Calcutta in 2001. 

Captain Dravid opted to field after winning the toss and India tore open Pakistan top-order within the first 11 overs before wicketkeeper batsman Akmal and allrounder Razzaq rescued the team with a 115-run seventh-wicket stand. 

Pakistan, who suffered a major blow with the pull out of their unfit captain Inzamam-ul Haq in the morning, were punch-drunk at 0 for three and then 39 for six. 

But before close, the scale had tipped as India, who opened their innings with Dravid and Laxman, faced some torrid overs from Shoaib Akhtar in particular. Dravid and Sehwag were sent back with only 14 on board by the fifth over. (AGENCIES)

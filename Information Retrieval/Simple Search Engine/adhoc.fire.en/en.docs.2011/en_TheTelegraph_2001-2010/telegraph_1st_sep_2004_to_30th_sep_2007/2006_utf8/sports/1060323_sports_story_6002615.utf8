 India coach's job

 Hidalgo

 New Delhi: Legendary French 

 coach Michel Hidalgo and former national coach of Republic 

 of Ireland, Brian Kerr are among 30 foreign coaches who 

 have expressed their desire to coach the Indian team.

 According to an All India Football 

 Federation (AIFF) press release, which also announced the 

 removal of Syed Nayeemuddin officially, the federation has 

 received applications from coaches who have been involved 

 in coaching national teams or top level clubs in Europe, 

 South America and Africa.

 Stating that AIFF has decided 

 to release Nayeemuddin as their chief coach, general 

 secretary Alberto Colaco said: The AIFF has already 

 written to Fifa requesting them to recommend a new coach 

 for the Indian team.

 Hidalgos application for 

 the Indian job comes as a surprise. The73-year-old coach 

 rose to fame in 1984 when he coached Platini and company 

 to European Cup triumph.

 Other than Hidalgo and Kerr, other 

 prominent coaches to have applied in the last few days are 

 Jose Mario Oiguin (former Argentina World Cupper), Pedrag 

 Jurrig (Bosnia), Andre Gusset (Switzerland), Acacio Alfredo 

 Casimiro (Portugal), Peter Obermaier (Germany) and Jason 

 Withe (England).

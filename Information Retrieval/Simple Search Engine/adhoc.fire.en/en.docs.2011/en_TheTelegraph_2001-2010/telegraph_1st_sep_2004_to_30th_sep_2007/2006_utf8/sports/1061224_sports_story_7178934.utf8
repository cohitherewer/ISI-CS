 Munaf makes his mark 

 - Pacer almost certain to replace VRV in second Test 

 Munaf Patel took two for 25 

Durban: The Indian thinktank had a good look at Munaf Patel and was reasonably pleased with how the lanky medium-fast bowler performed in the two-day game against local KwaZulu-Natal Invitation XI here on Saturday. 

According to The Telegraphs sources, its almost certain (as of late Saturday) that Munaf Patel will replace Vikram Rajvir Singh in the second Test, Our Special Correspondent reports from Durban. 

Munaf bowled his eight overs for 25 runs and claimed two wickets as the local team ended the second and final day on 243 for eight. Indians had made 270 for six declared in their first innings. In fact, Munaf struck off his very first ball. 

Munaf, if he does not show any side-effects from Saturdays efforts, could have a reasonable chance of making it into the final XI for the second Test, starting on December 26. 

Among the rest of the bowlers, Harbhajan Singh used the conditions well to account for three batsmen for 26 runs while Sourav Ganguly too turned his arm over to claim two wickets. 

Among the others, Vikram Rajvir Singh managed a wicket but the biggest disappointment was Irfan Pathan, who was smashed for 74 runs from his 11 overs. 

For the hosts, Rivash Govind made 88 from 128 balls with six fours and a six. Morne van Vuuren made a quickfire 50 from 53 balls with four fours and three sixes. 

Meanwhile, chairman of selectors Dilip Vengsarkar kept his cards close to his chest as far as the possibility of Munaf and Gautam Gambhir, who made a fluent 79, making it to the Test team, is concerned. 

I cant comment on selection for the second Test now, but this is an important game and we will take note of performances in this (practice) match, Vengsarkar said. 

Importantly, it is a good game of cricket we havent played for eight days and the boys need to be in the match groove. I am very happy about this game, said Vengsarkar, who was instrumental in arranging the unscheduled game in the visitors itinerary for the tour. 

He, however, offered a word of defence for Wasim Jaffer, the Mumbai opener who has only 30 runs from eight innings on the tour so far and who most likely would make way for Gambhir. 

He has failed in one Test but we will have to sit and work it out, he added. 

The former India captain was also happy about what he saw of Munaf in this game. 

He bowled reasonably well; he didnt go all out and he will settle down. He seems to be getting fitter, it was a good opportunity for him and his name will be up for selection, Vengsarkar said. 

Vengsarkar, however, pointed out that the role of openers was absolutely the key to winning a Test. You need openers (to fire) to win a Test. You probably are looking to score 300 runs in the first innings and openers would be important (in that quest), he said.

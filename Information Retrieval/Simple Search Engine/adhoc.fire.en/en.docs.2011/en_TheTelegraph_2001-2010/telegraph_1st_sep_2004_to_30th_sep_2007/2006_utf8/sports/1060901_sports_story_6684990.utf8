The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Saturdays races cancelled 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: RCTC Stewards have cancelled Saturdays fixture owing to paucity of acceptors. The reason for this was learnt to be the reluctance of some big owners to race their wards during the weekends in view of no inter-venue hook-ups with major outstation centres. These owners get better odds on their horses there compared to what the RCTCs betting ring offers. But outstation turf clubs have their own weekend fixtures. They also find the Pune and Mysore inter-venue far more profitable.

 Meanwhile, Bangalore bookmakers are learnt to have lodged a protest with the BTC stewards last Wednesday about RCTCs style of racing. They expressed their unwillingness to continue with the inter-venue. However, bookies may have to bear with it till the end of the monsoon season.

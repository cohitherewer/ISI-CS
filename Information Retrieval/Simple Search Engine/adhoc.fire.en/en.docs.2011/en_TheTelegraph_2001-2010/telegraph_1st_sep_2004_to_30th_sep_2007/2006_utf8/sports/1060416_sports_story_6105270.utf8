 Secret life of German poster boy

 HANNAH CLEAVER in BERLIN

 Balak has refused to become the black 

 sheep of Bayern

His is the face of German football, captaining his national team in the World Cup they are hosting, and now he seems set to make the move from Bayern Munich to Chelsea. 

Everyone in Germany knows Michael Ballack ? he is a huge advertising star, heading campaigns for Sony PlayStation, McDonalds and Adidas, among others ? and is enormously popular, often happy to play for laughs at his own expense. 

And hes not even 30 yet, a prime candidate for over-exposure swiftly followed by burnout. But until now Ballack has managed to present a boy-next-door personality to the public while shielding his family and private life from scrutiny. 

This week he changed that, opening the doors a fraction into his personal life with his official biography, written by two German journalists from Stern magazine. They trace his humble beginnings in socialist East Germany, living in an eighth-floor flat in Karl Marx City, now called Chemnitz. 

He was the only child of two athletes: father Stephan, who had played third-division football, and mother Karin, who had been a talented swimmer. They gave him full support as he progressed through FC Karl Marx Stadt to Bayer Leverkusen to the national team and eventually, to Bayern Munich. 

Yet his family background music includes the refrain Its about enjoyment, not success, a motto of his mothers that seems to echo his attitude. 

His family life, with partner Simone and three sons, forms a solid nucleus for Ballack. The couple are rarely seen at social events and she has refused to become a footballers wife by courting the media. 

Ballack has also refused to be consumed by the enormous machine that is Bayern Munich, frustrating general manager Uli Hoeness by not confiding in him, while revealing that after the troubled 2003-4 season he felt like the black sheep. 

As soon as two games are lost its instantly a crisis. And if as a player you no longer deliver a performance you are dropped like a hot potato, he said. 

When Hoeness realised his error in failing to tie Ballack more firmly into the family, meaning their star player will command no transfer fee, he turned nasty, accusing Ballack of leaving just for the money... Ballack brushed it off, saying: I was a bit irritated by the statements. But I cannot influence that. I explained my reasons.

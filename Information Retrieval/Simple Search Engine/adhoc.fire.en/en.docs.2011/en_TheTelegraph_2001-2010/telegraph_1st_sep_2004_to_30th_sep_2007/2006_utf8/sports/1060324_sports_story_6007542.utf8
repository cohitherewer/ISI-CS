 Jamaicas golden sweep in sprints

Melbourne: Australias Jana Pittman, a self-confessed drama queen, stole the show at the Commonwealth Games on Thursday by winning the womens 400 metres hurdles. 

Jamaica completed a golden sweep of the sprints when Omar Brown and Sherone Simpson won their 200m finals while Canadian cross-country cyclist Marie-Helene Premont avoided a run-in with a kangaroo to win gold in the mountains. 

Australia won eight gold medals across five sports to raise their total to 63 at the end of the seventh day, still in sight of their record haul of 88. England won another two to lift their total to 24 and remain clear of India (19), Canada (16) and South Africa and Scotland (both 10) with three days to go. 

Pittman, a former world champion, sped around the Melbourne Cricket Ground track in 53.82 seconds, defending the title she won in Manchester four years ago and triggering thunderous applause from the 83,000 spectators. 

She did not win a medal at the Athens Olympics but still managed to play the starring role after injuring her knee 17 days before the Games then dashing to London for surgery just to make it to the starting blocks in the Greek capital. A back injury meant she missed the 2005 World Championships and she injured her hamstring in the lead-up to these Games. 

The 23-year-old, who is engaged to marry Englands 2002 Commonwealth Games 400m hurdles champion Chris Rawlinson, was also involved in a catfight with teammate Tamsyn Lewis. 

Reprimanded by team officials, Pittman announced she was considering leaving Australia. I know Im a very misunderstood person but I really thought that by doing this on the track I can turn it around, she said. 

A desperate last-stride lunge by Brown won the 200m final from Mauritian Stephan Buckland by the width of his vest. Both men were given a time of 20.47 seconds, but Brown was awarded the gold after officials studied the photo-finish. 

Simpson won the womens 200m by a clearer margin in a surprise win over Olympic champion and compatriot Veronica Campbell. 

Campbell appeared to be cruising home before Simpson ran her down over the final 40m to finish in 22.59, giving Jamaica victory in the mens and womens 100m and 200m events. 

Australia won the inaugural womens basketball gold in a 77-39 crushing of New Zealand while Chris Rae laid claim to being the strongest man at the Games when he lifted a combined total of 388 kilograms in the super-heavyweight division.

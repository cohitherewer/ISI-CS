Leeds: Mohammed Yousuf and Younis Khan hit unbeaten half-centuries to steady Pakistan after a shaky start in their reply to Englands first innings of 515 in the third Test at Headingley on Saturday. 

At close on second day, Pakistan was 202 for 2, with Yousuf undefeated on 91 and Khan on 64. Together, they put on a 166-run stand to help the visitors recover from 36 for 2. 

Englands total was reached with centuries from Ian Bell who hit his third consecutive Test hundred and Kevin Pietersen and a strong tail end. 

England had smashed 141 runs in the days first session after resuming on 347 for 6 as they sought to win their first home series against Pakistan in six attempts since 1982. They have a 1-0 lead in the four-Test series. 

Within ten balls and two runs, Pakistan lost openers Taufeeq Umer for seven and Salman Butt for 20. Pakistan were then lucky not to be three wickets down when Paul Collingwood dropped Yousuf at first slip on five, with Pakistan on 42. 

Yousuf and Khan took 42 runs off the first six overs after tea, before steadying their run-rate and their innings. The pair reached their 100 partnership in the 33rd over, taking Pakistan to 136 for 2, when Hoggard bowled a no ball to Yousuf. 

Shortly after, Yousuf reached his half century with a drive through cover off Hoggard. Khan reached his fifty four overs later with a quick single off Monty Panesar as Pakistan moved to 152 and England bowlers struggled to get much movement from the ball for the rest of the day. 

Umer, who was making his series debut, had been caught behind off Matthew Hoggard, with wicketkeeper Chris Read diving to his left to make the catch. A specialist wicketkeeper, Read was recalled to the England team for the first time in two years for this Test to replace the dropped Geraint Jones. 

Despite the low score, alongside Butts 19, their combined total of 34 was Pakistans best opening partnership so far this series. It was Pakistans third different starting combination in as many Tests because of injury. 

Butt was stumped by Pietersen after being left short by Khans decision to run. 

Earlier, Bell scored his fifth century in 17 Tests and his fourth against Pakistan. He was the first batsman to score three consecutive centuries for England in the same home series since Allan Lamb against West Indies in 1984. 

He started the day on 66 and was out for 119 after being bowled by Danish Kaneria. 

He had one early scare, diving back into the crease at the non-strikers end just in time after a straight drive from Pietersen was glanced on to the stumps by Guls fingertips. 

The rest of his morning, however, was exemplary, his best stroke an exquisite late cut to the boundary off the same bowler. 

Bell got to three figures by driving strike bowler Mohammed Sami through the on-side for the right-handers 11th boundary. 

England lost Pietersen, resuming his 104-run innings after retiring with cramp on Friday, when he was caught at long off by Shahid Nazir off Mohammad Sami for 135. 

Englands tail end resisted well. Steve Harmisons single off Kaneria brought up 500 runs, but two balls later, he was out for 36, caught by Sami. Harmison had hit consecutive sixes off Nazir and back-to-back fours off Kaneria shortly before lunch. 

Sajid Mahmood made 34 runs his best-ever Test score before falling to a yorker from Umar Gul, which earned him figures of five for 123. Panesar finished not out five.

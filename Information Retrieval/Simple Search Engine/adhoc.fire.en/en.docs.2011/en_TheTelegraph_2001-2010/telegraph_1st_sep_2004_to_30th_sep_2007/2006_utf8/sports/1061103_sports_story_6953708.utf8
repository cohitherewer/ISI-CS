 ICC hails PCB stand on doping 

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: The International Cricket Council (ICC) on Thursday lauded the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) for setting a fine precedent in handling the doping trial involving Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Asif. 

Describing the PCB drugs tribunals judgement as very professionally done and satisfactory, ICC president Percy Sonn said that the PCB move was in harmony with the games world governing bodys endeavour towards drug-testing sport. 

It is a tragedy that the careers of two cricketers have been tarnished in this way but, at the same time, the judgement emphasises that cricket has a zero tolerance of drug use, Sonn said in a statement. 

That is the idea behind the ICCs drug-testing regime at all our events since 2002 and our adoption of the World Anti-Doping Agency Code in July of this year, and that idea of zero tolerance has to be the major message from this whole affair. 

The PCB has done extremely well in handling this matter in such an efficient manner and its strong stand against doping is a fine precedent, Sonn pointed out. 

The PCB drugs tribunal on Wednesday banned Akhtar for two years and Asif for one after finding them guilty of doping offences. 

The duo, however, will have the right of appeal or review. 

Sonn also urged other ICC members to take a cue from the PCB and ensure that cricket becomes a drug-free sport. 

I would now urge all ICC Full Members not already engaged in their own testing regimes to adopt such a process as soon as possible so cricket can show just how committed it is to being known as a drug-free sport, he said in the statement.

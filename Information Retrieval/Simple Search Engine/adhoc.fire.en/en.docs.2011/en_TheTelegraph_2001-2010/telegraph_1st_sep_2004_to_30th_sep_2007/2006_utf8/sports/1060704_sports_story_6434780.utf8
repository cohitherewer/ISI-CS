 Dravid to lead World XI

London: Sachin Tendulkar has been added to a star-studded World XI, which will take on Pakistan in a charity Twenty20 match at The Oval on Monday next. 

Tendulkar will join his captain Rahul Dravid and Mahendra Singh Dhoni, fresh from Indias Test series victory in the West Indies, as well as some other superstars of world cricket such as Brian Lara and Muttiah Muralidharan. 

Incidentally, Dravid will lead the World XI side. 

Confirming Tendulkars availability for the match, Surrey chief Paul Sheldon said Tendulkars presence would go a long way in ensuring the day is a success. 

Id like to thank Sachin for his support in this event and previous charity matches held at the Brit Oval, he said. 

It is fantastic to have one of the worlds greatest batsmen on show. 

His presence, along with the other great players on display, will go a long way to ensuring that the day will be a huge success, Sheldon added. 

Meanwhile, Trinidadian Clifford Narinesingh, who earlier penned a book on Sunil Gavaskar, has now come up with his latest take on Sachin Tendulkar. 

The book The Presence of Tendulkar focuses on Sachins greatness as a player and his achievements.

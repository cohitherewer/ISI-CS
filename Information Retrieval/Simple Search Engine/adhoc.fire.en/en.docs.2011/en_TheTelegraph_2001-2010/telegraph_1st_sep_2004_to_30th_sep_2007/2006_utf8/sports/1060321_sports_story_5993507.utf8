The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Screen operator takes on 3rd-umpires role

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Mumbai: For a change, instead of 

 disciplining players, Match Referee Ranjan Madugalle disciplined 

 the hosts of the ongoing Test ? the Mumbai Cricket Association 

 (MCA). He intervened, on Monday, after a potentially very 

 damaging act by the operator of one of the two video screens 

 at the Wankhede.

 The operator ruled Mahendra Singh 

 Dhoni run out even before TV umpire K. Hariharan gave his 

 verdict! Thankfully, Hariharan made the same decision or, 

 as a well-placed source of The Telegraph put 

 it, there could have been chaos and worse. 

While the TV feed was stopped immediately (and wont be restored), Madugalle ticked off the MCA for violating all guidelines governing replays on video screens. For example, till the TV umpire has made up his mind, the replays have to be shown at normal speed. 

There was a violation, which didnt get noticed, on Sunday as well and the agency handling the screens apologised. Mondays incident, of course, was extraordinary. 

In fact, not clear about where the official lights were, Dhoni walked off on seeing the Out verdict on the video screen to the right of the pavilion. To say the least, Hariharan would have been in an awkward position had his decision been different. 

 Indeed, there could have been a riot had the operator 

 ruled Not Out with Hariharans verdict 

 being entirely different. The MCA, which is headed by Board 

 supremo Sharad Pawar, has plenty to learn.

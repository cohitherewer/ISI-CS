Multan: Pakistan, powered by half centuries from Imran Farhat, Younis Khan and Mohammed Yousuf, made the West Indies toil on Day I of the second Test on Sunday. 

Farhat (74), Younis (56) and Yousuf (56) took their team to a commanding 263 for four but the visitors fought back with two key wickets in the final session. 

Captain Inzamam-ul Haq was on 31 not out after Younis and Yousuf both fell to soft dismissals. 

Younis, who returned to form with his 16th half-century, was caught in gully by Runako Morton off Jerome Taylor and four overs before stumps Yousuf played a lazy shot to Brian Lara at short mid-on off Chris Gayle. 

Yousufs wicket was a big boost for the visitors, who lost the toss and struggled on a typical subcontinental pitch on which the batsmen could bat freely. 

The elegant right-hander had been in ominous form scoring his 26th half-century despite being dropped on 45 by Daren Ganga in the gully off Taylor who took two for 61. 

Yousuf, who has hit six Test hundreds this year, shared a third wicket stand of 87 with Younis, who faced 159 balls and hit six fours. 

They built on a solid foundation of 83 laid by openers, Farhat and Mohammed Hafeez (36). 

Farhat, who hit 10 spanking fours, was dropped on 22 in the leg trap by Dwayne Bravo off Gayle before he hit his ninth half-century. 

It was a nice pitch to bat on. But one is never comfortable against the new ball and once that period was over I enjoyed batting out there, Farhat said. 

It was disappointing to miss out on a hundred as it was a good opportunity. But I am trying to learn from my seniors how to build big innings. 

Taylor provided the breakthrough when he got Hafeez to nick behind and Farhat was caught by Lara at second slip off Bravo after lunch. 

Corey Collymore, despite being his teams best bowler, had a luckless day as he beat the bat regularly without finding the edge. He kept things tight with fine figures of 16-5-23-0. 

Skipper Lara said: The pitch again is made for batting though we bowled in the right areas. We had five chances and we took four of them. 

He added: When we get the opportunity to bat on it we will want to make full use of it as it is full of runs. There will be some deterioration of course, from bowlers footmarks. 

The West Indies decided to play without the experienced, though out-of-form Ramnaresh Sarwan. 

Lara said: For us it was just a matter of picking what we think was the best team and Sarwan still remains one of our main players and hes only missing five days of cricket. 

Meanwhile, Shivnarine Chanderpaul became the eighth West Indian to make a 100 test appearances.

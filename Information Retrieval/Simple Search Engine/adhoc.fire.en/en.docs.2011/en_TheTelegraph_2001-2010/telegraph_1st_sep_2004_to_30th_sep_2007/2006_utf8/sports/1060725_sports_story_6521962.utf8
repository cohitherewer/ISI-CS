 Sania-Marta loses in doubles final

 WTA Cincinnati Open

 Mason: Sania Mirzas 

 bid to grab second doubles title on WTA Tour this year was 

 thwarted by top seeds Maria Elena Camerin and Gisela Dulko 

 at the $175,000 Cincinnati Open.

 The Indian, partnering Marta Domachowska 

 of Poland, lost 4-6, 6-3, 2-6.

 The third-seeds came back from 

 behind to level scores 1-1 but ran out of steam in the decider 

 disappointing their fans. 

 Sania was making her fifth final 

 appearance on the WTA Tour career record.

 Russian Vera Zvonareva won the 

 singles title, beating Katarina Srebotnik of Slovenia 6-2,

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Sasthi joins practice

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: At a time when the IFA is planning to take up the issue of Santosh Trophy schedule with AIFF, which is threatening to ruin the ongoing CFL Premier Division, there is more drama around Bengals build-up to the tournament, to be held in Haryana. 

If East Bengals Sasthi Duley who had earlier cited his lack of interest in the tournament finally appeared for practice under Prasanta Banerjee on Sunday, Mohun Bagan have accused the state association of attempting coercive steps in roping in Ayan Chowdhury for the camp. 

Though the IFA has denied taking such step, Mohun Bagan secretary Anjan Mitra alleged that one of its key functionaries had called Ayan on Saturday night and threatened to take action if he failed to join the Bengal practice. 

Ayan is down with fever and hes not practising with Mohun Bagan squad also. How can an IFA official threaten a player like this? If it persists, we may take legal steps against that official, Mitra said on Sunday. Ayan couldnt be contacted for comment. 

India goalkeeper Sandip Nandy will join the camp on Monday. His presence may open up the race for captaincy as fellow-custodian Kalyan Chowbey and Sasthi are also in fray. Captaincy issue will be decided once the squad reaches Haryana.

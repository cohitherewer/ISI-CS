Bangkok: Jeev Milkha Singh rounded off one of the finest seasons for any international across the world with a tied sixth place in the season-ending Volvo Masters of Asia Golf Tournament which was won by Thailands Thongchai Jaidee. 

This was Jeevs 18th top-10 finish which included four wins on three different tours. Jeev carded an even par 72, his third such score in four rounds, for a total of six-under 282. 

Shiv Shankar Prasad Chowrasia and Jyoti Randhawa also scored 72 each and finished tied 10th and 15th, respectively. 

Defending champion Shiv Kapur (74) finished 36th while Amandeep Johl (76) was 42nd, Gaurav Ghei (76) 49th and Rahil Gangjee (84) tied 57th. 

Jaidee managed to keep himself afloat despite a mid-round lapse when he dropped three shots in two and came through the stern test in a manner that afforded him the luxury of another double bogey at the 18th to win his second Volvo Masters of Asia title in four years. 

Jaidee (72) totalled 11-under 287 after having been 14-under within the first holes of the final day at the magnificent Thai Country Club. 

The win also kept Jaidees amazing streak of having won at least once every year since 2000. 

In between his two wins, the first of which came in 2003, the two previous editions of the Volvo Masters of Asia have produced Indian winners in Randhawa in 2004 and Kapur in 2005. 

On a dramatic final day, first Thongchai seemed to run away with the tournament but then he himself opened a window for his rivals, before closing it shut again with a second wind and then had it wrapped up despite a double bogey on last hole.

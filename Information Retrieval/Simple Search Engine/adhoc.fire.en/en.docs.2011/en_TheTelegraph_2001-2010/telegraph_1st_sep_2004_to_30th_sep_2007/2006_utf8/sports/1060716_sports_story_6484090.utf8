 Germany, Italy may lose a GP each

 - Schumacher grabs pole

Magny Cours: Germany and Italy could each lose a GP next year, but Belgiums Spa is set to return, F1 supremo Bernie Ecclestone said on Saturday. 

Germany currently has races at the Nuerburgring and Hockenheim but Ecclestone said that it could be trimmed to just one round. Neither German circuit is making the money it used to and Hockenheim track operators said last December that they were considering holding races in alternate years. 

Italy hosts races at Monza and Imola. 

Meanwhile, seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher led a Ferrari sweep of the front row to claim pole position for Sundays French GP.

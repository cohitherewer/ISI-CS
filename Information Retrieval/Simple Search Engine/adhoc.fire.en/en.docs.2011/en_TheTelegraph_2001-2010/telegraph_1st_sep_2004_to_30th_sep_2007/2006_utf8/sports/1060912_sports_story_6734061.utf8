 Sharapova empire all set to prosper

New York: Maria Sharapovas US Open triumph has put her firmly on course to set new standards for women in sport and she says she is determined to cash in. 

Even before her straight-set defeat of Justine Henin-Hardenne in Saturdays final, the 19-year-old Russian diva was by a long way the biggest earner among female sportspersons. The marketing phenomenon earned in excess of $25 million last year, the bulk of it from worldwide endorsements with top-drawer companies. 

That leaves her fourth on the international (non-American) sports money list, behind Formula One driver Michael Schumacher, Italian MotoGP rider Valentino Rossi and Brazilian soccer star Ronaldinho. 

That is still a long way behind the $96.7 million hauled in by the biggest name in world sports, Tiger Woods, but it did move her ahead of Real Madrids David Beckham, Japanese baseball player Ichiro Suzuki and Swiss tennis ace Roger Federer, who earned an estimated $22.1 million dollars a year. Federer at 25 has won nine Grand Slam titles and Sharapova has just two. 

But her blonde, model-like looks and bubbling personality are a godsend for sponsors always on the lookout for someone who can connect with the general public worldwide and sell products. 

Sharapova raised a few eyebrows at a tournament in California in August when in reply to a question about her huge earnings she replied: Its never enough. I always look for more. Bring on the money. 

Asked to comment on that after her US Open triumph, which brought her an additonal $1.7 million, a miffed Sharapova initially replied: Im not going to get into that right now. 

But after a moments reflection, she decided that attack was the best form of defence saying: You cant buy a Grand Slam title, you know. You cant buy it!. 

There are people around the world that have billions of dollars, but no matter how much they want a US Open title, the only thing they can do is buy some good tennis rackets, get the best trainers out there and work their butt off!. 

This can beat any sort of money, any sort of paper. 

Sharapovas own winding road to world stardom is well documented. 

Plucked from her mothers bosom in Russia at the age of nine and transplanted with her father Yuri to a top tennis coaching academy in Florida, she lived, breathed and ate tennis from her earliest years. 

And with the best of her tennis years lying ahead of her, she says this is just the start of big things. 

Theres definitely nothing like winning your first major, she said of her breakthrough Wimbledon triumph in July 2004. 

But to win your second is also like the cherry on the cake. (AFP)

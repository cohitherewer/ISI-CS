 Must-win situation 

for Salgaocar 

Panaji: Salgaocar, who are in danger of being relegated, will go all out for a win against Dempo when the two teams lock horns on Sunday at the 10th National Football League at Nehru Stadium, Margao. 

Salgaocar strikers failure to score goals has put them in the danger of relegation, but their win against East Bengal in the last match raised their hopes of being able to avoid a low finish. 

A win on Sunday will put them on par with Mohammedan Sporting who are also fighting to avoid relegation. 

Salgaocar will be playing with the same squad that played last except defender Agnelo Colaco who got injured against East Bengal. 

On the other hand, Dempo who lost against Al Nasr of Oman in the AFC Cup match here, have not lost their spirit. 

On the contrary, they will go all out for a win as they are aiming to finish in the first four, are presently at fourth position with 20 points from 14 matches. (PTI)

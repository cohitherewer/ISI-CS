The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 We could have scored thrice, says PK

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Indias performance against the mighty Saudi Arabians drew a lot of praise from former footballers who were present at the Salt Lake Stadium on Wednesday. What impressed them most was the never-say-die attitude, which the Indian footballers displayed aplenty despite going down 0-3. However, they unanimously rued the missed chances as well. The following, in a nutshell, is what they said: 

 P.K. Banerjee: We could have scored thrice. India got a lot of chances but failed to convert them. Moreover, they conceded silly goals. The ground conditions were bad. 

Also, Bob Houghton couldnt judge Alvito properly. He should have been brought in earlier and used from the left side. Mahesh Gawli was missed. But its too early to judge Houghton. Among the Saudi Arabians, Tukar Redha stood out. Captain Sulimani Hussein was brilliant and created a lot of opportunities. 

 Prasanta Banerjee: The team showed a lot of aggression, which was previously lacking. They have thankfully left their defensive mentality and played with a positive approach even after conceding a goal as early as in the second minute. All credit for this goes to Houghton. 

Had India managed to convert the opportunities that came their way, the match could have taken a different turn. The passing and trapping were atrocious. If Alvito were brought in earlier, the left side would have been stronger. Al Kahtani Yasser played exceptionally well. 

 Surajit Sengupta: The ground conditions were pathetic. But India failed to take advantage of the slushy surface. The good part was that we didnt accept defeat before the final whistle. 

The defence was poor. Whenever Saudi Arabia attacked, the defence seemed to lose control. Manjit Singh was the only person who created chances. He didnt really miss opportunities. The Saudi Arabia goalkeeper played exceptionally well. Bhaichung was not his usual self. He was completely overpowered by Tukar Redha.

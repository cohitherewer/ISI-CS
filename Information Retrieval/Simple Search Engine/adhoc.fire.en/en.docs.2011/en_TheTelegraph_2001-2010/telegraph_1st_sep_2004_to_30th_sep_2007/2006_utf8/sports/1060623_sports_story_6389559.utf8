 Its now or never for France

Cologne: France must defeat Togo by at least two goals on Friday to make sure of avoiding another early exit from the World Cup. Whats more, talismanic midfielder Zinedine Zidane will not be there to help them. 

Zidane, who will retire following the finals, is suspended after picking up his second yellow card of the tournament during a 1-1 draw with South Korea, which may be his last match if the 1998 world champions fail to survive the group stage. 

If France, who have not won a World Cup match since lifting the trophy on home soil eight years ago, win in Cologne by just one goal, their fate would depend on the outcome of the other match in Group G between Switzerland and South Korea. 

France, whose goal against South Korea was their first on the World Cup stage since they stunned Brazil 3-0 in the 1998 final, are still hoping to reach the July 9 final in Berlin. 

Big teams such as Italy or Germany have had slow starts and great runs in the past, said striker Thierry Henry. We must believe in ourselves. 

On paper, France are strong enough to beat Togo comfortably but the African debutants, who cannot reach the knockout stage, are desperate to leave Germany on a high after a campaign marred by a pay dispute, coaching crisis and nearly a match boycott. 

It is always special when any African team plays France, said striker Mohamed Kader Coubadja. Motivation springs from that alone. 

France coach Raymond Domenech, who will be without not only Zidane but also defender Eric Abidal through suspension, is keeping his cards close to his chest regarding team selection but has no option other than to reshuffle his team. 

Domenech, whose own future would look very uncomfortable if France failed to qualify, is expected to opt for a 4-4-2 system with David Trezeguet or Louis Saha joining Henry in attack. 

Mikael Silvestre should come in for Abidal at left back while defender Lilian Thuram is poised to win his 117th cap, breaking the national record he shared with Marcel Desailly. 

Thuram is one of several players who won not only the 1998 World Cup but also the 2000 European Championships and are dreaming of a suitable farewell in their last major finals. 

They came to Germany looking for a burst of pride after Les Bleus left the 2002 World Cup without a win or a goal from the group stage having entered the tournament as champions. 

Their seasoned campaigners, including the great Zidane, could be back for a final encore if France live up to the occasion and recapture their winning ways against Togo. 

Otherwise they will be sent packing again and the curtain would fall on the finest generation to wear Frances colours.

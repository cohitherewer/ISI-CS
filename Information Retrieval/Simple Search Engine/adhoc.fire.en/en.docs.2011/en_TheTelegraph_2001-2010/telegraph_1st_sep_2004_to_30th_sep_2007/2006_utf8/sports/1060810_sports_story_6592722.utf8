The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 IN THE CITY

 Former India playmaker Prasanta Banerjee has been named the coach of Bengal in Santosh Trophy. His former teammate Tanumoy Bose will assist him as the goalkeeping coach.

 The IFA had earlier taken a strong stand against playing in the tournament when it was originally scheduled to take place in Jammu and Kashmir. But owing to militant attacks on tourists in Srinagar, AIFF decided to shift the venue with Haryana being the front-runner.

 The IFA also named coaches for various categories. While Kajal Chatterjee and Raghu Nandy will be in charge of the under-21 side, Debashish Mukherjee will be goalkeeping coach.

 OTHER OFFICIALS

 U-19 side Coach: Krishnendu Banerjee; Goalkeeping coach: Biswajit Das. U-16 side Coach: Sujit Chakraborty; Goalkeeping coach: Nasir Ahmed. U-13 side Coaches: Chinmoy Chatterjee amp; Prasanta Guha; Goalkeeping coach: Pratap Ghosh.

 The IFA on Wednesday began an inquiry into last weeks manhandling of secretary Subrata Dutta by Mohammedan Sporting supporters. IFA disciplinary committee analysed videos and newspaper clippings and decided to hear Duttas version of the incident on Thursday. 

 The committee is yet to decide whether Mohammedan Sporting coach Subhas Bhowmick and other club officials will be summoned for this purpose.

 But it is almost certain that IFA will mete out exemplary punishment to the offenders.

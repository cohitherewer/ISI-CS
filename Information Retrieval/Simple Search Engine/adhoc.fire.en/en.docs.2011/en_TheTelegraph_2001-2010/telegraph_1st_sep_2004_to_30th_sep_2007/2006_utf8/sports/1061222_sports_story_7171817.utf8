 Age no bar for Aperitivo 

 STAR RACER

 Aperitivos advancing age was hardly a factor in Saturdays Calcutta Gold Cup. The five-year-old reduced two younger horses to pulp and emphasised the fact that the 2002 crop is special. Aperitivo, a Vijay Singh-trainee, was set to concede all round weight, more importantly 6-1/2kg and 9kg to Rasalas and Ardelis, respectively.

 If Rasalas ruined his winning chances after taking a distance-long lead from the start, Ardelis performed no better after his eye-catching second in the previous weeks 2000 Guineas. His run went on to prove that horses normally dont show improvement within a week of their last run. Ardelis, also from Vijays stable, had run the Guineas after being out for nearly 10 months.

 It was Chistys day, otherwise. In the Avalanche Star Handicap, his favourite, Lasting Love, stumped Islams Legal Lady at the post in spite of the latter enjoying a three-length lead in the last 200m. Favourite Qba was, however, unlucky having dropped his bit soon after the start of the Pussy Galore Handicap. Chistys Indigo won the race, and comfortably, too. 

 Chisty lapped up the treble, in the Birthday Girl Handicap, when Tomahawk, despite shifting out, countered Zephyrs (Islam-up) challenge. Incidentally, stewards had slapped a three-month ban on jockey R.Yadav who had gone easy on Tomahawk in his previous outing.

 Seasons ninth title for Federer

 - Its very hard to keep winning, says No. 1

Tokyo: Reigning world No.1 Roger Federer showed Tim Henman no mercy on Sunday, taking apart the Britons serve-and-volley game to win the mens singles title at the Japan Open in straight sets. 

The 25-year-old Swiss top seed, playing his 13th final in 14 events this season, notched an easy 6-3, 6-3 victory over Henman, a surprise finalist making his first appearance in Tokyo in eight years. 

It was excellent, of course, Im really happy with this tournament. Its been a great season so far, Federer said. 

Ive had a great experience visiting Japan and the fans are really friendly to me, so this has been a great week for me. 

Henman was on the defensive from the start, saving two break points in the fourth game of the first set. But his serve betrayed him when he hit three double faults to lose the crucial sixth game, and eventually the set. 

The British veteran also had no luck converting break opportunities on Federers serve. 

Federer, who set an open era record with a 56-match hard court winning streak earlier this year, forced Henman to send a forehand shot sailing long to finish off the 67-minute match. 

I definitely got lucky against (Takao) Suzuki (in the quarter finals). It was a very close match and I could have lost it easily, but I came through and gained the opportunity to win the title, said Federer. 

Im a bit surprised, because I had a lot of jet lag, and to always keep winning, its a very hard thing to do. Im very tired now, mentally and physically. I really hope to come back next year and defend the title. Federer took a 7-6 lead in head-to-head match-ups with Henman, having won their last six encounters. 

It was Federers ninth title of the season, including Grand Slam victories at the Australian Open, Wimbledon and the US Open, and his 42nd overall. 

Federer failed to make the final only once this season, losing to rising British star Andy Murray at Cincinnati in August. 

But Murray failed to set up a re-match in Tokyo, losing to 2004 champion Jiri Novak of the Czech Republic in the second round. 

It was a disappointing feeling of deja vu for Henman, who lost to Federer 3-6, 3-6 in his last appearance in an ATP final, at Indian Wells in March 2004. 

The womens title in Tokyo went to top seed Marion Bartoli of France, who came from behind to beat local favourite Aiko Nakamura, 2-6, 6-2, 6-2. (AFP)

 Bengal concede lead, its advantage UP

 - RANJI FINAL 

 Kaif rides luck to 81 n.o.

 Kaif hit Sourashish for two sixes 

Lucknow: All attention on the fourth morning of the Ranji Trophy final at the K.D. Singh Babu Stadium here was on the home stretch of the intense battle for the first-innings lead. At the start of play on Wednesday, Bengal needed 39 runs to nose ahead while Uttar Pradesh sought two wickets. 

The issue didnt take long to be settled, with Bengal folding up for 373 to trail by 14 runs. 

In the second innings, skipper Mohammed Kaif (batting 81) rode his luck to guide UP to 183 for two. With just a day to go, UP are 197 runs ahead and unless they suffer a nightmarish collapse in the first session on the final day, the doors on a Bengal triumph look shut. 

Ranadeb Bose was the first man to go, caught-behind off pacer Shalabh Srivastava. Leg-spinner Piyush Chawla then ended the Bengal innings by dismissing top-scorer Laxmi Ratan Shukla (66). 

Shukla had himself to blame for the dismissal. Having hit a huge six off Chawla a little earlier, Shukla went for another big hit and top-edged a sweep. Substitute fielder Ali Hamid Zaidi ran from deep mid-wicket to square-leg and caught the ball with an amazing diving effort. 

His indiscretion cost Bengal the vital lead and also gave Chawla a five-wicket haul. The Sri Lanka-bound under-19 World Cupper Chawla finished with five for 83 and his contribution would stand out if UP do go on to win their maiden Ranji Trophy on Thursday. 

Boosted by the slender lead, UP began their second innings confidently. Makeshift opener Praveen Kumar made 15 before being caught by Arindam Das at first slip off Ranadeb. 

Bengal went on the attack but were again let down by sloppy catching. In the very next over after Praveens dismissal, Abhishek Jhunjhunwala dropped a simple Kaif offering at covers off Ranadeb. Kaif hadnt opened his account then. 

Kaif had another reprieve when skipper Deep Dasgupta missed an easy stumping chance off Shiv Sagar Singh. Kaif made capital of those let-offs to move to within 19 of a three-figure knock. 

Kaif put on 111 with opener Shivakant Shukla before being trapped leg-before by Shib Shankar Paul. Shukla made 56 with six fours and a six. Kaif hit off-spinner Sourashish Lahiri for two huge sixes. His unbeaten 81 has come off 214 balls with five fours.

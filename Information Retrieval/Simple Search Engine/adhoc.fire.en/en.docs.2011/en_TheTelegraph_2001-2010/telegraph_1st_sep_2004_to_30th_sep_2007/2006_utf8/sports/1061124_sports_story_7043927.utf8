The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 East Bengal hope for the best

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: There is a great demand for calculators in the East Bengal camp here at the moment. 

Facing almost certain elimination from the Durand Cup after the 0-4 defeat against JCT, East Bengal are now busy calculating how to revive the semi-finals hopes. With just one point from two matches, the Calcutta team now needs quite a few things to go in their favour to make the next stage. 

If JCT and Dempo (four points each) play a draw in the days first match on Friday, the East Bengal-Army XI tie thereafter will render meaningless. In case there is a result in the match, East Bengal have a chance to make it if they manage to beat the defending champions by a huge margin. 

In reality, things look quite impossible for East Bengal to achieve. While their manager has already booked the return tickets for Saturday, the coach Carlos Pereira is not ready to accept defeat. I am still hopeful to make a turnaround, he said. 

There could be several changes in the side. While Abhra Mondal, Chandan Das and Dipankar Roy might make the team, Brazilian Thiago and Japanese born Indian Arata Izumi have very little chance.

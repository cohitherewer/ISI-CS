Birmingham: Liam Plunkett returned his best Test figures on Thursday to help dismiss Sri Lanka for 141 on the opening day of the second Test against England at Edgbaston. 

Plunkett took three for 43 after Sri Lanka had won the toss and elected to bat. 

At close, England were 138 for three after off-spinner Muttiah Muralidharan took two late wickets. 

Sri Lanka, who fought back to draw the first Test at Lords after being asked to follow-on, would have been further humiliated had it not been for Chaminda Vaas (30 not out) and Lasith Malinga (26) who added 50 for the ninth wicket. 

Plunkett captured two wickets in his opening over to finish with three for 43 after Sri Lanka had won the toss and elected to bat. 

The tourists would have been further humiliated had it not been for Chaminda Vaas (30 not out) and Lasith Malinga (26) who added 50 for the ninth wicket. 

Plunkett snared three of the top four Sri Lanka batsmen to give England the upper hand for the second match in succession. 

After Matthew Hoggard had bowled Upul Tharanga for a duck, the 21-year-old Plunkett produced a double-wicket maiden with his first over. 

Michael Vandort (9) drove loosely at a wide and full delivery and was well caught by Paul Collingwood in the gully, justifying his reputation as Englands best fielder. 

Then Sri Lanka skipper Mahela Jayawardene edged his third delivery to wicketkeeper Geraint Jones and departed without scoring. 

After Jayawardenes 61 and 119 at Lords, it was a wicket met with understandable jubilation by the England players with Sri Lanka now 16 for three. 

Five overs later Hoggard claimed his second wicket when Thilan Samaraweera (3) deflected an outswinger to the reliable Collingwood at fourth slip. Sri Lanka were in deep trouble at 25 for four. 

Kumar Sangakkara became the penultimate wicket when he edged a Plunkett delivery angled across him to Jones. His hard-fought 25 runs had taken 87 minutes. 

Jones completed his third catch when allrounder Farveez Maharoof (5) edged Sajid Mahmood from the last ball before lunch.

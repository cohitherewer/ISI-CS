 Botham tried to coax me back: Warne

London: Former England captain Ian Botham had tried to talk Shane Warne out retirement so that he could be a part of the 2009 Ashes series to be played in England. 

Warne, who will quit international cricket after the final Test against England following Australias Ashes-regaining victory in Perth, on Friday said Botham told him that people would like to see him play again in 2009. 

A few people tried to talk me out of it. Ian Botham was one. He told me Im still on top of my game, that Im the greatest cricketer that ever lived and that people in England would love to see me play in the Ashes series in 2009, Warne wrote in his column in The Times. 

Warne said he would have definitely played in 2009 Ashes if Australia had lost the series again. 

Im happy. Its good to be leaving Australian cricket in such a healthy state... Had we not won the Ashes this time round, I can safely say I would not be retiring, he said. 

The 37-year-old spinner said Australian captain Ricky Ponting and former skipper Ian Chappell, however, respected his decision. 

Ricky Ponting, whom I told after wed won in Perth, was a bit shocked but said he respected my decision. I had actually had a chat with him about it before the Brisbane Test so he already had an inkling about my intentions. 

I also shared a beer with Ian Chappell, whose opinion I greatly respect. He said it was better to be asked why are you rather than why dont you, the spin wizard said.

 Quick Takes

 It will be Brazils Cup: Ronaldinho

 London: Ronaldinho, the 

 Barcelona midfield player, believes Brazil can live up to 

 their billing as World Cup favourites and defend the trophy 

 at this summers finals in Germany. The 26-year-old 

 was part of the Brazil team that lifted the trophy in 2002 

 and he predicts a sixth World Cup win for Brazil four years 

 on.

 I think that it will be 

 Brazils World Cup, Ronaldinho said in a television 

 interview. I dont think about standing out or 

 being more or less the best. I simply want to do my best 

 so that Brazil will be the world champions. The most 

 important thing is that Brazil reaches the final and wins.

 Aimar leaves hospital

 Madrid: Valencias 

 Argentina midfielder Pablo Aimar left hospital on Wednesday 

 after being treated for a form of viral meningitis.

 I am looking forward to 

 playing again as soon as possible and helping my team over 

 their remaining league matches, Aimar told the clubs 

 website.

 No date was given for the 26-year-olds 

 return to training. Aimar, a key figure in Argentine coach 

 Jose Pekermans World Cup plans, was admitted to hospital 

 a week ago complaining of fever and headaches. Doctors said 

 it was a benign form of meningitis that would not have any 

 permanent consequences.

 Brazil deal

 New York: Nike and Brazils 

 federation have reached an agreement to extend its 

 sponsorship contract until 2018. The federation will receive 

 $12 million a year and a $6 million bonus if Brazil wins 

 their sixth World Cup title.

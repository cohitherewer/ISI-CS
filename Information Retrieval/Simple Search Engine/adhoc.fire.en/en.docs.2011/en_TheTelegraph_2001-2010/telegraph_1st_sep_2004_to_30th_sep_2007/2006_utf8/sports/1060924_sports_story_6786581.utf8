 Atwal makes the cut

San Antonio: Arjun Atwal, fighting to save his PGA Tour card for next year, overcame a quadruple bogey disappointment and hung on over the last five holes to enter the weekend rounds of the Valero Texas Open. 

Atwal, who is lying 143rd in the money list and needs to get inside the top-125 with tournaments running out, shot an even par 70 to be one-over 141 for 36 holes and just managed to squeeze inside the cut line here. He is now lying tied 66th. 

Eric Axley (63) and D. A. Points (66) shared the lead at nine-under 131. Axley had a bogey-free 7-under 63. Paul Goydos (63) was third at eight-under 132. (PTI)

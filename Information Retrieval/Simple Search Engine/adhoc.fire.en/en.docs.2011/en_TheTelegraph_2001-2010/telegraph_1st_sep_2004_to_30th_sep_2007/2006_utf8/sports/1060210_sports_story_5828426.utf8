 Fresh lease of life for Fransa

New Delhi: The NFL disciplinary committee on Thursday referred the outcome of the Fransa-Air India match to its emergency committee and also gave the beleaguered Goan outfit another chance to present their case at the earliest. 

Both the decisions indicate that the All India Football Federation (AIFF) has softened its stand against Fransa after the club said on Wednesday that it would take part in the National League provided the match against Air India is rescheduled. 

For the sake of natural justice, the committee feels that the concerned players and officials be invited to appear before the disciplinary committee at the earliest, the panel, comprising S.R. Dev, chairman, S.A. Hamid and Capt. S.S. Virk said, while disposing off the matter regarding disciplinary action against the players and officials of the Goan club. 

Regarding Fransas protest regarding the controversial match against Mahindra United, the committee upheld the earlier decision, saying, the result stands as the protest is on a decision of the referee based on a point of fact. 

As of now, it appears to be AIFF president Priya Ranjan Das Munshis call to decide on Fransas fate as the emergency committee has already lobbed the ball in his court. 

But the drama is far from over as the disciplinary committee rejected the protest lodged by Mohammedan Sporting that Air India fielded an ineligible player, Binoy Kuruvilla, against them. A decision on this matter will have a direct bearing on Fransas fate. 

Binoy picked two yellow cards and should have served a one-match suspension. Air India, however, said he had served the suspension as his name was not included in the line-up for the match against Fransa on February 3. (PTI)

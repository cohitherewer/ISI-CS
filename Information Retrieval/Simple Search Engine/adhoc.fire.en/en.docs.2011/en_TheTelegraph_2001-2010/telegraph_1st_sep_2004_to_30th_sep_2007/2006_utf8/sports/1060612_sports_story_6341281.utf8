The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Its a massive result, says Dwight 

 Yorke

 THE TIMES, LONDON AMP; AGENCIES

 Tie vs Sweden

 Dortmund: Fortune-tellers 

 were out and about in Dortmund. A mock British newspaper 

 match report hung as an advert in the newsagents at 

 the station declared the score on June 20 to be England 

 1, Sweden 0. In one of the colossal stands here at Dortmunds 

 stadium, blondes walked the concourses with shirts proclaiming 

 Sweden 2 England 2 ? Agreed. 

 They might need to rethink the 

 score because a draw might not be enough now. T amp;T? More 

 like TNT threatening to explode Swedens chances of 

 making the second round.

 The fans slapped steel drums; 

 the players nerves were made of the same metal. True, 

 it was one of those days for Sweden ? one of those days 

 when all your best chances fall to Marcus Allback, the hapless 

 former Aston Villa striker.

 Still, it took outstanding goalkeeping 

 from Shaka Hislop and superb defending from Brent Sancho 

 (Gillingham) and Dennis Lawrence (Wrexham) to produce this 

 point in front of red-clad Soca Warriors supporters who 

 waved flags and cheered everything their team did, big or 

 small. 

 Dwight Yorke, a holding midfield 

 player these days ? to ease the pressure on his weary legs 

 and because of a fear that if he were up front, the other 

 players might not be good enough to get him the ball ? was 

 Man of the Match but this was a collective triumph. 

 Include the coach Leo Beenhakker 

 in that, because his bravery in playing two up front, switching 

 to 4-3-2 after Avery John was unluckily given a second yellow 

 card early in the second half, was a masterstroke. 

 Now, after plotting an impressive 

 goalless draw, the Dutchman is busy working on the tasks 

 ahead that could secure an unlikely place in the last 16. 

 Beenhakkers coaching credentials are impeccable having 

 taken Real Madrid to a hat-trick of Spanish League titles 

 in the 1980s. He also won two Dutch titles with Ajax Amsterdam 

 and led the Dutch national team in the 1990 World Cup. In 

 that tournament he was working with the likes of Ruud Gullit, 

 Marco van Basten and Frank Rijkaard.

 Sixteen years on the raw material 

 is very different but he has proved that quality coaching 

 can make a real difference by moulding Trinidad amp; Tobagos 

 disparate group into a team capable of holding their own 

 at the highest level.

 One of the things I always 

 do as well as studying the players, their qualities, and 

 their skills is to study a little bit the philosophy of 

 the coach and I have seen that they always play in the same 

 way, Beenhakker said. It is always the same 

 system so that way there were no surprises.

 Its brilliant, this 

 is what footballing dreams are all about, the 34-year-old 

 Dwight Yorke said. To come up against a mighty footballing 

 country of Swedens status with obviously a tiny country 

 like ours, its a massive result for us.

 Playing in a deeper midfield role 

 than he is accustomed to, Man-of-the-Match Yorke harassed 

 Swedens high-powered strikeforce of Henrik Larsson, 

 Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Freddie Ljungberg and never let them 

 settle.

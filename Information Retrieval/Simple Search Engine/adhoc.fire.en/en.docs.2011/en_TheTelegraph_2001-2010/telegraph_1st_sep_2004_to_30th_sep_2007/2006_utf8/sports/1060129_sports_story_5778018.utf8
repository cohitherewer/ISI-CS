 Aim at off-stump base for perfect yorker

 For a good length delivery, play defensively either off the front or backfoot 

 I am a righthanded batsman. I often get bowled or stumped while coming down the track to an off-spinner. Please help.

 (Koustubh Lal, 12, Calcutta-27)

 (Rabindra Rizal, 14, Siliguri; Yash Kariwal, 12, Calcutta-3)

 Nearly a month ago, I injured my finger trying to take a return catch. Although the injury wasnt serious, I have since developed a fear of stopping the ball on my follow through. How do I overcome this?

 I have the best team: Rajinder

 - Sandeeps defensive quality has improved, says national coach 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Ignace Tirkey wants to top group to avoid Australia 

New Delhi: On the eve of Commonwealth Games, national hockey coach Rajinder Singh has won a couple of major battles on and off the field. 

On the field, India did not lose a match in Pakistan under his coaching. Outside, he managed to keep Tamil Nadu forward Adam Sinclair out of the Commonwealth squad. Sinclair is believed to have the right connections in the Indian Hockey Federation (IHF). It nearly cost Rajinder his job. 

Its not that Rajinder is sitting pretty at the moment. He may still be shown the door if India fair poorly at Melbourne. Rajinder knows it, but is confident about making a podium finish in the Commonwealth Games. At the moment, I have the best available team in the last few months, he said after the last practice session in New Delhi on Saturday. On Sunday, the team is leaving for Australia. 

For the past few months, there were too many changes in the team. I couldnt get a stable squad. Now that we have done well during the Pakistan tour, boys have regained their confidence. 

This combination will hold us on good stead, the national coach felt. 

Incidentally, for the first time, both the mens and womens teams will be led by Adivasi players. While Ignace Tirkey comes from Sundergarh district in Orissa, womens captain Sumrai Tete is from Simdega in Jharkhand. 

Rajinder is also sure that drag flicker Sandeep Singh will come good at Melbourne. Previously, I didnt get much time to work with him. During this camp, his defensive quality has vastly improved. 

Nearly three years have passed since India won their last international gold in hockey. In 2003, India won the Asia Cup and the Afro Asian Games in Hyderabad. But skipper Ignace feels the jinx will be broken this time. We want to top the group, he said. 

That way, we will be able to avoid playing Australia, who are sure to top the other group. 

Pakistan, South Africa, Malaysia and Trinidad and Tobago are the other teams in Indias group. Teams in the other group are: Australia, New Zealand, Scotland, Canada and England. 

In the evening, Rajinder Singh came to the Shivaji Stadium to watch Deepak Thakur and Viren Rasquinha turning out for Indian Oil in the Maharaja Ranjit Singh hockey tournament semi-final. 

When asked, he said he has no qualms about players playing for their club teams a day before the national teams departure. 

It hardly matters. After all, the boys are getting a chance to play practice matches. I know there is a fear about injuries, but that can happen during the practice session also. So, why stop them from playing?

 Perfect script for Warne

 - Leggie bags 5/39 as England capitulate for 159 

Melbourne: Shane Warne captured five wickets to take his career total past 700 as Australia seized control of the fourth Ashes Test against England on Tuesday. 

Warne took five for 39 to complete his 37th five-wicket haul and become the first man to claim 700 Test victims as England collapsed to 159 all out on the first day at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. 

Australia, in reply, slumped to 48 for two at stumps, after England skipper Andrew Flintoff first dismissed Justin Langer for 27 then nightwatchman Brett Lee for a golden duck in successive deliveries. 

Flintoffs double strike provided the tourists with some hope of staging a fightback and salvaging a little pride from a series where they have been comprehensively outplayed, losing the first three Tests to surrender the Ashes they had won last year. 

Their batting had let them down in each of the three previous matches and once again failed them after they won the toss and elected to have first use of the pitch. 

England made a bright start and were cruising along at 101 for two after lunch when the wheels suddenly fell off and they collapsed, losing their last eight wickets for 58 runs.

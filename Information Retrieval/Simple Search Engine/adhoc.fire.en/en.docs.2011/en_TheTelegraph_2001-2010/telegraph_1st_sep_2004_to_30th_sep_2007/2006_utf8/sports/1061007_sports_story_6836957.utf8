 Bowl out to be adopted in case of tie in semis, final

Mumbai: Absence of bonus points, a win fetching two points as compared to four or five in a regular ODI series featuring more than two countries and a bowl out to determine the winners in case of a tie in the semi-finals or final are some of the novelties which would be seen during the Champions Trophy. 

In first-round matches, in the event of teams finishing on equal points, the order of finishing will be decided in the following order of priority: 

1. The team with the most number of wins in the first-round matches will be placed in the higher position. 

2. If there are teams with equal points and equal wins in the first-round matches, then in such case the team with the higher net run rate in the first-round matches will be placed in the higher position. 

3. If following the net run rate calculation above there are teams which are still equal, then the team with the higher number of wickets taken per balls bowled in the first-round matches in which results were achieved will be placed in the higher position. 

4. If still equal, the team which was the winner of the head-to-head match played between them will be placed in the higher position. 

5. If the deadlock continues, it will be broken by drawing lots. In the second round, in case of teams finishing on equal points, the semis finalists would be determined in the following order of priority: 

a. The team with the most number of wins in the second round matches will be placed in the higher position. 

b. If there are teams with equal points and equal wins in the second-round matches, then in such case the team with the higher net run rate in the second-round matches will be placed in the higher position. 

c. If following the net run rate calculation there are teams which are still equal, then the team with the higher number of wickets taken per balls bowled in the second round matches in which results were achieved will be placed in the higher position. 

 d. If still equal, the team which was the winner 

 of the head to head match played between them will be placed 

 in the higher position. 

 e. If the deadlock continues it would be broken 

 by drawing lots. However, if a semi-final or the final is 

 tied, the teams shall compete in a bowl out to determine 

 which team progresses to the final. 

In case of a no result, the team with the highest net run rate in the second-round matches would advance to the final. If still equal, the finalist shall be determined by draw of lots. 

In case of a no result in the final, the teams will be declared joint winners.

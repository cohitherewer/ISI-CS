The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Using the Sourav-card to stump Boycott? 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Geoffrey Boycott

Mumbai: Its rare for former England captain Geoffrey Boycott to be left speechless. History of sorts, though, was created at the Wankhede on Sunday evening. 

With the second day of the third and final Test also going beyond the scheduled close, Boycott was in a hurry to reach his hotel in time for a TV shoot. He obliged fans while a senior Mumbai Cricket Association official arranged a drop. 

Boycotts mood, however, changed when the vehicle arrived. Got to rush, got to rush, he told The Telegraph and declined more requests for autographs etc. As he was about to board, a youngster shouted: But, Geoffrey, Im a (Sourav) Ganguly fan... Your Prince of Calcutta fan... 

For just that one moment, Boycott stood still. Recovering, he shot back: So am I, but the TV show cant wait... The youngster, of course, has vowed to catch him over the next three days.

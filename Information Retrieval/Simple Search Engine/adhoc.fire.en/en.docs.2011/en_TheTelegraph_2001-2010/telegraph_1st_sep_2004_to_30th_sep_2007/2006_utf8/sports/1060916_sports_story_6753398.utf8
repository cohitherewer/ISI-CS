The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Sania loses out to Rezai

A STAFF REPORTER

 Hingis 

Calcutta: As was expected, former world No. 1 Martina Hingis has been accorded top billing in the $175,000 WTA Calcutta meet, to be held from Monday. 

In the seedings list released officially on Friday, the current world No. 9 will be followed by Karolina Sprem of Croatia (50) and Ukraines Yuliana Fedak (64). 

Local favourite Sania Mirza paid a heavy price for her string of ordinary performances this year, which saw her hurtle down to world No. 70. She didnt even get the fourth slot and had to settle for No. 5, losing out to Aravane Rezai. It means that Sania could come up against five-time Grand Slam champion Hingis as early as in the quarter finals. 

Rezai, a Frenchwoman of Iranian descent, reaped the benefits of her strong showing in the US Open where she reached the fourth round before going down to Russian Elena Dementieva. 

Kaia Kanepi of Estonia has been seeded sixth, followed by Nicole Pratt of Australia and Anastassia Rodionova of Russia. 

Meanwhile, the US-born Sunitha Rao has been awarded the third wild card for the Tier III tournament. 

The 21-year-old, a resident of Florida, was selected by the organisers on the basis of her written request to the All India Tennis Association that she be allowed to play for India in the Federation Cup. 

Based on her application to play for India, we have decided to give her the third wild card, a spokesperson for the organisers, Globosport, said on Friday. 

In the qualifying competition, to be held on Saturday-Sunday, Sanaa Bhambri will take on Brenda Schultz-McCarthy of The Netherlands and Ragini Vimal will face Sabine Lisicki of Germany in the opening matches. 

Altogether 10 Indians are among the list of 16.

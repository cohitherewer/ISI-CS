 Atwal slips to tied 52nd

Pebble Beach (California): Arjun Atwal carded a one-over 73 and slipped to tied 52nd, while Daniel Chopra recovered from a disappointing first round to bring in a fine five-under 67 in the second round of the Pebble Beach Pro-Am Golf Tournament here. 

Chopra closed the second round beautifully with two birdies on last two days in a card that had six birdies and just one bogey to jump up from overnight tied 82nd to tied 20th. 

Meanwhile, Mike Weir birdied the closing three holes at Poppy hills to finish with a five-under 67 on Friday and moved into the lead after two rounds. 

Weir finished his first nine holes in even par, but after the turn he moved briskly up the leaderboard as first-round leader Luke Donald wavered through his round at Pebble Beach. 

Weir hit nine of 13 fairways and made both of his sand save opportunities in the second round. 

Atwal playing on the Poppy Hills course was struggling with one birdie and four bogeys after 10 holes but he came back strongly. (PTI)

 Rooney kick-starts training

 Buhlertal: Striker Wayne Rooney gave Englands World Cup hopes a boost on Tuesday when he began a training session with the rest of the squad. 

Rooney, who broke his foot on April 29, took part in the first 20 minutes of the session at their training base near Baden Baden, to the delight of coach Sven-Goran Eriksson. 

The 20-year-old Manchester United forward then did a mixture of running, sprinting and ball work on his own with England fitness coach Ivan Carminati. Rooney will have a scan on his foot in Manchester on Wednesday. 

I think he looks very good, Eriksson told a news conference as his team prepares for Saturdays Group B opener against Paraguay. They also face Trinidad and Tobago and Sweden in the group. 

Eriksson, who has until 24 hours before that game to keep Rooney or replace him with standby Jermain Defoe, said he expected the scan result by Thursday morning at the latest. 

Its totally up to the surgeons, the specialists, the doctors and physios. I cant judge it, he said. But Ive always said I think he will be available, that he will take part in the World Cup. And I still believe it very, very strongly. 

Goalkeeper Paul Robinson was also buoyed by Rooneys presence, saying: He did the warm-up today ? hes been training with the physios for the last couple of days. Looking at him now, its looking positive. Its gives us a boost obviously. 

However, Gary Neville warned against taking club mate Rooney for granted, having had a similar metatarsal injury which ruled the defender out of the 2002 World Cup. 

I have an experience in 2002 while I was in Manchester recuperating from my broken foot ... I was jogging prior to my scan and went to see the specialist thinking I would be given the go ahead to start training and was told Id have to have an operation four days later. 

I hope that doesnt happen for Wayne ? everyone wants him to take part in the World Cup. 

The lads had a broken foot, just leave him be. Let him rehabilitate, hell be looked after by the right people. 

Left back Ashley Cole, nursing a hamstring problem that forced him off during the first half of Saturdays 6-0 friendly win over Jamaica, also worked separately from the squad. 

 Three players who missed Mondays session in 

 England did their first workout in Germany ? Neville, John 

 Terry and David Beckham ? though Beckham later sat out the 

 training match.

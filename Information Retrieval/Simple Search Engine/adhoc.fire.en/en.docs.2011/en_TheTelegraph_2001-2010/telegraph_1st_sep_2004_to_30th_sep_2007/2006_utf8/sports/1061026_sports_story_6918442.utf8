 Materazzi awaits Zizou handshake

Paris: Marco Materazzi is still awaiting a handshake from Zinedine Zidane. 

The Italy defender was head-butted in the chest by Zidane after insulting the France captains sister in the World Cup final on July 9 in Berlin. Zidane got red-carded and Italy went on to win the title in a penalty shootout. 

I have made my apologies. In return I have never received the offer of a handshake, Materazzi said in an interview on French radio on Wednesday. Lets not forget, Im the one who received the head-butt. 

Materazzi, who received a two-game ban for inciting Zidane, called himself a great guy, and said he has heard similar things about the Frenchman, who has since retired from soccer. (AP)

 Yemen rally to down India 

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: India failed to bag a single point in their AFC Asian Cup qualifying campaign, going down to Yemen 1-2 in their final Group A match on Wednesday. 

According to the AFC official website, Bob Houghtons side took the lead through NP Pradeep seven minutes after the break at the Ali Mohsen Stadium in Yemen. But their joy was short-lived when Nashwan Al Haggam helped Yemen equalise in the 60th minute. 

Al Nono then fired the 82nd-minute winner for the hosts.

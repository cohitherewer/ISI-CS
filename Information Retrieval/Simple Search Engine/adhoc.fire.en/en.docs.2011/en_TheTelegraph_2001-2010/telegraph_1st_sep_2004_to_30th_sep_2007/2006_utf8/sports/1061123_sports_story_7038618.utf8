 At 65, Puan eyes medal in Doha 

Singapore: He might be 65 but Alan Puan is going to the Asian Games as a competitor, and he is serious about winning a gold medal. 

The Singaporean grandfather is expected to be the oldest among the 12,000 or so athletes at the event which gets underway in Doha on December 1, but he is unfazed. 

It is my first Games, my biggest games, and it could also be my last, the billiards player told a newspaper. But I will continue to compete as long as I feel fit. Billiards is mainly about skill. Age and stamina are not so important. 

Ive never felt old at the table and Im game for a match with anyone, any age. 

His best bet for a medal will be in the doubles with 38-year-old partner Peter Gilchrist, the 1994 and 2001 world champion. He is still very fit, both mentally and physically and he puts in the same amount of training time as younger players, said Gilchrist. 

Puan has won nine national titles and has competed at the SEA Games, but never the Asian Games. 

The cue sports at the Asian Games get underway on December 4, with the billiards singles final on December 5 and the doubles final on December 6.

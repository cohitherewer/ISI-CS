The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Very keen, not tense

 - Srinath leaves for Sri Lanka today 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Calcutta: Having been coached by Ranjan Madugalle, Jawagal Srinath is set for his July 27 debut as Match Referee, in the first Test between Sri Lanka and South Africa, in Colombo. 

Appointed for the short (two-match) series last week, Srinath leaves for the Sri Lankan capital on Tuesday. 

The second Test, too, is going to be in Colombo. 

Its a new role, yes, but Im not tense in any way? If anything, Im very keen, he told The Telegraph (from Bangalore) on the eve of his departure. 

At 36, Srinath is the youngest of eight Match Referees, and the only Indian on the International Cricket Councils Elite Panel. 

Not that I wasnt aware of whats expected, but the job description was made absolutely clear when I worked with (Chief Match Referee) Ranjan in the lead-up to and during the recent England versus Pakistan Test at Lords. 

A Match Referee has a lot of responsibility and the role involves much bonding ? with the on-field umpires as also the third and fourth umpires? The officials, too, need to have team spirit, he pointed out, laughing. 

Asked whether hed learnt anything in particular, while being Madugalles shadow, Srinath replied: I cant recall anything specifically, but I was advised to keep an eye on things important? I observed Ranjan as closely as I could? The pre-match rituals, for one, have got to be followed religiously. 

Will he be emphasising the spirit-of-cricket bit during his pre-series meeting with captains Mahela Jayawardene and Ashwell Prince, on Wednesday? 

Thats not necessary? A lot of things are understood and dont really have to be highlighted? If theres a clarification on the laws, for example, then Ill get the umpires to make the position clear, Srinath said. 

Incidentally, Srinath has played against the Muttiah Muralidharans and Shaun Pollocks and, so, an evening out with one-time adversaries is on the cards. 

Srinath retired in late 2003, with 236 wickets in Tests and 315 in ODIs. 

Former captain and chief selector Gundappa Viswanath, by the way, was the last Indian on the Match Referees panel.

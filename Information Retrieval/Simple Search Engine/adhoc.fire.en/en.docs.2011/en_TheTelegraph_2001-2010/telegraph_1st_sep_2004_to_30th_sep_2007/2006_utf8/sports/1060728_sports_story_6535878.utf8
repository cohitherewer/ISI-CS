The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Pakistan debacle linked to wild beach party

 - Players were drained, tired and suffered from lack of focus, says report 

 Action during the Netherlands-Pakistan 

 Champions Trophy match which the latter lost 2-9

Karachi: Pakistans humiliating 2-9 defeat against The Netherlands in Champions Trophy hockey has evoked scathing criticism back home with one paper linking the thrashing to a wild beach party enjoyed by the indisciplined players on the eve of the match. 

Instead of resting in their team hotel and preparing for the match by focusing on the Dutch, senior Pakistan players spent the day swimming and enjoying on a Barcelona beach, a report in a popular daily said. 

As a result, the players were drained, tired and suffered from lack of focus, it said. 

Three-time Champions Trophy winners Pakistan conceded the first of the nine goals in the 38th second, before suffering their worst defeat in the tournaments history on Tuesday. 

The drubbing ended Pakistans hopes of reaching the final of the tournament and left them struggling to avoid relegation. 

The attitude of (goalkpeeper) Salman Akbar was embarrassing and unsporting when he threw his gloves in the wash basin and then kicked the door of the locker room after he was replaced after the first half (in which he conceded four goals), the newspaper commented. 

The (senior) players are a bunch of indisciplined characters who are totally out of chief coach Asif Bajwas control, it added. 

The teams thrashing by The Netherlands has given a new dimension to the goings-on in Pakistan hockey, passing through testing times after PHF president Tariq Kirmani revealed that secretary Musarratullah Khan had resigned. 

However, Khan has been asked to continue till a new secretary is appointed in September. 

Khan is accused of human trafficking on European tours besides manipulation to protect his position in the PHF as well as in international hockey federation (FIH). 

Insiders say senior players Sohail Abbas and Waseem Ahmed had fallen out with Khan in 2004 which eventually forced them to hang their boots only to wear them again earlier this year. 

 Federal sports minister Mian Shamim 

 Haider on Wednesday summoned ministry officials and Pakistan 

 sports board and instructed them to get a reply from PHF 

 on the debacle in Terrassa. (PTI)

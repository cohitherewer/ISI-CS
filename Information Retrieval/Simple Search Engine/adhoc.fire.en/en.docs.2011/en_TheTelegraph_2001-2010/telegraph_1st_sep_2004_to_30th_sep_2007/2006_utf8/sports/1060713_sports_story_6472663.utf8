 Northants in quarters

London: Sourav Gangulys modest run-a-ball 23 and Dinesh Mongias dismissal for duck could not hamper their chances as Northamptonshire and Leicestershire recorded huge wins against their respective opponents and entered the quarter finals of the Tewnty20 Cup on Tuesday. 

Sourav scored 23 as an opener for Northants who went on to beat Gloucestershire by a thumping eight-wicket margin (as reported in the Wednesdays Late City Edition). Mongias Leicestershire thrashed Durham by 79 runs. 

Northamptonshire chased thetarget of 155 in 17.4 overs after Gloucestershire, electing to bat, made 154 for seven. 

The other opener Robert White scored 62 while David Sales top-scored with unbeaten 68 after Sourav was stumped by Stephen Adshead off Martyn Ball delivery. The former Indian captain hit three fours. 

Mongia had a rather bad day as he was out on the very second ball he faced but Leicestershire went on to score 183 for seven with the help of reliable H. D. Ackerman (87) and Jeremy Snape (41) at Riverside. Durham were restricted to 104 for eight. 

Leicestershire will play Kent while Northamptonshire will face Nottinghamshire on July 24. Surrey vs Gloucestershire and Essex vs Yorkshire complete the remaining line-up.

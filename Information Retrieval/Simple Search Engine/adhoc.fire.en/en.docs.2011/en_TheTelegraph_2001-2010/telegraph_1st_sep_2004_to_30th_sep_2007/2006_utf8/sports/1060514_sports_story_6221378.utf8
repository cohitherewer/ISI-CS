 Lead-up fitness test

 Mumbai: Sachin Tendulkar 

 is to train and practice at Chennais MRF Academy next 

 week ahead of his fitness test on May 20, a top cricket 

 board source said on Saturday.

 Tendulkar is to train in 

 Chennai from May 15 to 20. They have good facilities at 

 the academy and his training would be overseen by the trainer 

 there, Ramji Srinivasan, the source said.

 Sachin is recovering from the 

 shoulder operation that he underwent in March-end and has 

 missed the first part of the West Indies tour featuring 

 five one-day Internationals starting May 18.

 The champion batsman is racing 

 against time to get fit before the selectors announce the 

 team for the four-Test series against the West Indies on 

 May 24 after the third ODI. The test series runs from June 

 2 to July 4.

 Meanwhile, the ace batsman had 

 another practice session, lasting around two and a half 

 hours, this morning at the Bandra-Kurala Complex ground 

 belonging to the Mumbai Cricket Association, sources said.

 Dhoni took it away from us: Inzamam 

 - India have the edge now 

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Lahore: Mahendra Singh Dhoni is taking President Gen. Pervez Musharrafs advice to heart. He told me not to cut my hair and I dont intend doing so, the wicketkeeper-batsman said on way to the team bus at the Gaddafi. 

Basking in the glory of his unbeaten 72 off 46 balls that brought India the five-wicket victory on Monday, Dhoni rated this knock better than his 148 at Visakhapatnam. Its hard to pick any innings as my best. The amount of pressure experienced here was not there in Visakhapatnam. That way this innings is better, but the unbeaten 43 in Pune against Sri Lanka will also rank alongside, he said. 

In international cricket, its all about confidence, Dhoni said. When I walked in, the target was quite achievable. I decided to play a few deliveries since the wicket was not conducive for strokeplay and then take it from there? Everything clicked and thats made the difference. 

Inzamam-ul Haq summed it up well. Before Dhoni came it to the crease the match was in our hands. He took it away from us? The way he batted was the turning point, the Pakistan captain said. 

Rahul Dravid also praised Dhoni. There was no special instruction for Dhoni. Hes been brilliant. For a man in his first year in international cricket, he can adapt to the situation very well. He has a good head in his shoulders. The maturity is showing. 

Sachin Tendulkar and Yuvraj Singhs efforts were also not undermined. 

Sachins assessment of the situation was brilliant. He realised a bit was happening in the wicket and the way he controlled the game was superb. He scored at a good rate in difficult conditions. A special innings. 

Yuve has shown maturity and realised he had to stay put till the end. 

This tour in some ways has taken Yuve to another level. All his knocks have come at critical stages on this tour. 

Inzamam conceded that India have the edge going into the fourth game. But this loss is not demoralising because we have been playing well? We didnt field well and that made the difference. Weve got to work on that aspect. We can make a comeback in the series. 

Agarkar injury 

Dravid informed that Ajit Agarkar, who was replaced by Zaheer Khan as super sub after bowling six overs, had suffered a sprain in the back. We didnt want to take any chances. 

He was feeling sore. He seems to be okay now? He will continue to get treatment and will be assessed. 

Meanwhile, Pakistan have recalled pacer Mohammed Sami for the rest of the ODI series.

 Despite win, India slip to No. 4

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Despite their first series win in the Caribbean in 35 years, Team India slipped down the rankings chart on Tuesday. According to an International Cricket Council (ICC) release, Rahul Dravids side lost two rating points apart from a place in the table and is currently in the fourth spot, below Pakistan. 

 The reason behind this is that, having started the 

 series as a higher ranked team, India were expected to win 

 by a larger margin. Team India captain Rahul Dravid remained 

 in second place in the LG-ICC Player Rankings for Test batsmen.

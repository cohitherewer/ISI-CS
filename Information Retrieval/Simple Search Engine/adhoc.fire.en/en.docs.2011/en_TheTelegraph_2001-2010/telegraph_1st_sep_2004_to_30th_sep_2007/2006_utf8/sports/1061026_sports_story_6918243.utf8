 Haroon: ICC should review 2.30 pm start

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Chandigarh: Despite the dew factor, the International Cricket Council (ICC) hasnt been able to advance the start of the Champions Trophy matches, because of broadcast commitments, but Haroon Rashid feels the world body should review its stand on the 2.30 pm start. 

A former Pakistan player, coach and manager, Haroon told The Telegraph I dont think TV ought to be dictating everything... The timings, if you may recall, were adjusted when India toured Pakistan this year... The same ought to be done in this tournament... 

In India as a commentator for a radio station back home, he added: The Champions Trophy is the biggest tournament after the World Cup and, so, the conditions must be such that everybody finds it exciting... Its a poor sight when bowlers and fielders struggle under the lights... Some of the wickets (at the CCI, in Mumbai) werent good either... 

The ICC got APSA-80, a chemical used in the farming industry, sprayed before Wednesdays Pakistan versus New Zealand match in Mohali, but the Black Caps still had a tough time in session No. 2. They won, but at one time, it did seem as if Pakistan would finish with full points. 

Last week, the CCI had seen special glue being applied to ensure the wicket stayed firm throughout.

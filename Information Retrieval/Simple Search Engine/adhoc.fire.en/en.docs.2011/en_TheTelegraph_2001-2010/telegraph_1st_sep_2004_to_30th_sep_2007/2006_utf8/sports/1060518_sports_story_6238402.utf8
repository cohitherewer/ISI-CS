 Simon knocks out Gaudio 

Hamburg: Former French Open champion and sixth seed Gaston Gaudio of Argentina lost in the second round of the Hamburg Masters on Wednesday, beaten 4-6, 6-3, 4-6 by unseeded Frenchman Gilles Simon. 

In windy and overcast conditions on the clay court at the Am Rothenbaum, No. 4 seed Nikolay Davydenko of Russia strolled into the third round, getting past Italys Andreas Seppi 6-1, 6-2 to set up a clash with Finlands Jarkko Nieminen. 

Ninth-seeded German Nicolas Kiefer disappointed the home crowd, losing 2-6, 2-6 to Max Mirnyi of Belarus. 

Gaudio, who won at the red courts of Roland Garros in 2004, reached the semi-finals at the Monte Carlo Masters last month before losing to eventual winner Rafael Nadal in three sets, but was knocked out in the first round of last weeks Rome event.

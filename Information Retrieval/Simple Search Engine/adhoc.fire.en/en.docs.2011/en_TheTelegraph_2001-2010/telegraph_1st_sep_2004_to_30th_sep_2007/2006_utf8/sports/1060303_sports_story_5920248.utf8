The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Nervousness was there and I had to calm myself: Jaffer 

 - I wasnt looking for boundaries, my priority was to remain there

 Nagpur: Having spent almost 

 four years in the wilderness ? and, it can get very lonely 

 there ? its not surprising that Wasim Jaffer felt 

 nervous on again taking guard in a Test, at 

 the VCA Stadium.

 The nervousness was there 

 and I had to calm myself... Returning after such a long 

 lay-off is tough on the mind... That I remained focused 

 helped achieve the first goal ? staying unbeaten at stumps 

 (on the second day of the first Test against England), 

 a pretty delighted Jaffer told The Telegraph. 

The 28-year-old Mumbaikar is on a chanceless 73 (201 minutes, 170 balls, 13x4), 13 short of his best ? 86, versus the West Indies in Antigua (2001-02). His last Test was at Trent Bridge on our 2002 tour of England. 

Jaffer saw Virender Sehwag depart early, but Rahul Dravids arrival lifted his confidence: Hes inspirational and, just by watching him, the batsman at the other end gains... Great players dont only contribute themselves, but help improve the game of others... 

It must have helped that he himself got off the mark with a four off Matthew Hoggard, in over No.1 itself... 

Its nice to quickly get off the zero... However, nothing is more important than staying at the wicket... I wasnt looking for boundaries, my priority was to remain there, Jaffer, who was initially clueless about debutant Mudhsuden Panesar, answered. 

Incidentally, with elder brother Naeem having come across, Jaffer isnt short on home support. 

So, what of the immediate future? Having done the hard work, I dont want to give it away tomorrow morning... The team comes first, but Ill be happy if I get my maiden hundred, he said. Having just played eight Tests in six years, getting there would be great. 

 As senior teammate V.V.S. Laxman put it, Jaffer deserves 

 all the success as he has been working very hard...

 China retain Thomas Cup 

Tokyo: World number one Lin Dan beat Peter Gade on Sunday to spearhead China to a 3-0 victory over Denmark and retain the Thomas Cup. 

It was Chinas second straight and sixth overall title, but for Denmark it was their eighth defeat from eight appearances in the final. 

Lin, seeking to avenge his loss in the China Masters, fired an array of smashes and attacks at the net to win 21-17, 21-19 and put China one up in the best-of-five rubber. (AFP)

 PCB request to BCCI, CA 

Karachi: The Pakistan cricket authorities have asked the Indian and Australian boards to sort out an overlapping in the Future Tours Programme (FTP). 

We are scheduled to tour India in November 2007 and the series goes into December. But according to the FTP, the start of Indias tour of Australia overlaps with our series, a Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) official said. He said Australia would have to readjust their itinerary slightly to get rid of the overlapping. 

He also confirmed that Pakistan would be demanding compensation from England and South Africa for playing less number of matches on their tour of Pakistan once the proposal for compensation is ratified by the ICC executive board. (PTI)

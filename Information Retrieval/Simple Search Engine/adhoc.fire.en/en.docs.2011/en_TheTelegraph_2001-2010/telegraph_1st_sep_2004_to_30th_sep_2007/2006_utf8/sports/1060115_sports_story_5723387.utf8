Lahore: Unleashing a merciless assault, four batsmen struck centuries as Pakistan buried a clueless India under a deluge of runs to put themselves in the drivers seat in the first Test on Saturday. 

Younis Khan (199), Mohammed Yousuf (173), Shahid Afridi (103) and Kamran Akmal (102 not out) made a mockery of the Indian bowling attack as they plundered runs at will before the hosts declared their first innings at a commanding 679 for seven declared, shortly before tea. 

While all the Pakistani batsmen scored at a brisk pace on a placid track at the Gaddafi Stadium, the flamboyant Afridi was particularly belligerent as he clobbered seven boundaries and as many sixes during his blistering 80-ball knock which completely pushed the visitors on the backfoot. 

Faced with a stiff target of 480 to avoid the ignominy of a follow-on, India made a steady start to the run chase, reaching 65 for no loss at close on an eventful second day. Captain Rahul Dravid, who opened the innings instead of Sourav Ganguly who was widely speculated to don the openers mantle, was batting on 22 while Virender Sehwag was on 36 when bad light stopped play with 19 overs remaining. 

It was yet another forgettable day for the visitors who were sent on a leather hunt for most of the day as the Pakistanis scored at an amazing 4.7 runs per over to completely dominate the proceedings. 

The day belonged to the hosts strong batting line-up and in particular Afridi who smashed the Indian attack to smithereens on the featherbed pitch to make 103 in 80 balls. 

The exciting allrounder, who clubbed off-spinner Harbahajan Singh for 27 runs in an over including four sixes, also put on 170 runs for the sixth wicket with wicketkeeper Akmal, who too batted in carefree style to remain unbeaten on 102, inclusive of 11 fours and two sixes in 81 balls. 

They were the third and fourth batsmen to get into triple figures in the Pakistan innings and followed the example set by the third wicket duo of Younis and Yousuf. The duo put on a mammoth partnership of 319 runs in 270 minutes and 392 balls to set up the platform for the Afridi-Kamal pyrotechnics after lunch. 

Pakistan, who resumed at the overnight 326 for two, declared their innings closed with 32 minutes left for tea as soon as Akmal completed his ton with a four. 

In reply, Sehwag was his confident self, driving and flicking with ease in his run-a-ball unbeaten knock that had 7 fours while Dravid struck three fours during his more sedate approach. 

Earlier, it was the Afridis fireworks that lit up the Gaddafi Stadium as he entertained a crowd of 7,000 with his batting pyrotechnics that sent the entire Indian team diving for cover. 

The dashing allrounder truly lived up to his reputation as a marauder of bowlers, unleashing audacious strokes, most of them on the on-side. 

Afridis big-hitting prowess during his 111-minute rampage left the Indian attack dead for ideas. His explosive sixth wicket stand with Akmal at just under two runs per minute in 129 balls left only one option for India in the match, a draw. 

 Akmals century off 81 balls was the fastest by a wicketkeeper. He overtook Australias Adam Gilchrist, who held the record so far with 84-ball hundreds on two occasions (against India in Mumbai on 2000-01 and versus Zimbabwe in Perth on 2003-04). 

The twin assault by the two Pakistanis helped them shoot up the already galloping run-rate to more than four an over. 

The final Pak total was the fourth plus 600 total against India and the second highest after 699 for 5 at Lahore in 1989-90 and 674 for 6 in 1984-85 at Faisalabad. Akmal was in a very aggressive mood against the lacklustre bowling but he was still overshadowed by Afridi who slammed his fourth hundred in Tests. 

Sixes rained on the Indians as Afridi took apart their bowling, especially Harbhajan Singh who was carted for four sixes off the first four balls of his 34th over in which he gave away 27 runs, all of them to Afridi. 

Kumble, who had claimed two wickets in eight balls to send back Yousuf and Inzamam-ul Haq, was also singled out for punishment by the sixth wicket Pak duo. 

Earlier, Younis had become the second Pakistan batsman to be dismissed for 199 against India. 

Constable hauled up 

A constable was taken off and departmental proceedings started against him for dereliction of duty at the team hotel. The constable was found missing from his designated place at Pearl Continental.

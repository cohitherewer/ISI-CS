The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 EB to open versus Md. Sp.

 - NATIONAL LEAGUE 

New Delhi: Dempo Sports Club will take on fellow statemate Sporting Clube de Goa, while Calcutta giants East Bengal square up against Maidan rivals Mohammedan Sporting in the opening matches of the 10th National Football League (NFL) that will kick off on Tuesday. 

A total of 10 teams would compete in the league, with the matches taking place in Calcutta, Goa, Ludhiana and Mumbai. 

The 10th edition of the NFL was previously scheduled to start on Saturday, but various logistical problems forced its commencement to be postponed. 

A total of 90 matches over a period of four months would be played to decide the national champion. At least 45 of them would be telecast live on Zee Sports, who have tied-up with the All India Football Federation (AIFF) for 10 years in a deal amounting to Rs 273 crore. 

The first phase of the NFL would continue till February 9, after which there would be a pause for the national training camp and Indias qualifying matches for the 2007 Asian Cup. The last phase starts on March 12, and will go on till May 14. 

The total prize money at stake is Rs 1.10 crore, out of which the champions take home Rs 40 lakh, while the runners-up get Rs 22 lakh. 

To ward against the possible non-availability of venues, the AIFF has nominated Delhi, Bangalore and Kozhikode as neutral venues. 

This decision assumes significance as Goa is to host an India-England one-day International on April 3, and the host association would need the Nehru Stadium in Fatorda to prepare it for the game. 

The Cooperage ground in Mumbai is in a pretty bad state, and the AIFF has had talks with the Cricket Club of India so that the first few home matches of Mahindra United and Air India can be hosted at the Brabourne Stadium, AIFF chief Priya Ranjan Das Munshi said. 

The turf at the Salt Lake Stadium in Calcutta has to be laid again, but Das Munshi said that would be done when most of the matches scheduled there have been completed. 

Otherwise we have possible alternatives in Barasat and Siliguri, he said. 

The problem was compounded as none of the stadia were owned by the AIFF, Das Munshi added. 

The schedule for the second phase would be finalised in the next 10 days, AIFF secretary Alberto Colaco said.

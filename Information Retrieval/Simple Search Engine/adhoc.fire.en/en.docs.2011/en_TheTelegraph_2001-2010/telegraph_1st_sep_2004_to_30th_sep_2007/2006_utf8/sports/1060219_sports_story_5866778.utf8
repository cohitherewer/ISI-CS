 AIFF move irks referees 

 - We are not setting a healthy precedent: Milan Datta 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

New Delhi: The decision of the disciplinary committee of the All India Football Federation (AIFF) to allow the Fransa Club goalkeeper, coach and the manager to go scot-free even after manhandling referee Bikramjit Purokayastha in an NFL match on January 30 last, has left the entire referees community an unhappy lot. While the vice chairman of the referees committee, Milan Datta has termed the decision as disappointing, quite a few top referees felt it would only lead to further lawlessness. 

Datta said he was quite disappointed to learn that the AIFF did not even impose a token sanction on Fransa footballers for creating a mayhem at Margao. It has been happening too regularly for the past couple of years. Referees like Balu, Saji Kurian or Bikramjit have been unofficially banned by the AIFF, but absolutely no action has been taken against the erring players. We are certainly not setting a healthy precedent. 

A top Indian referee said they have been made scapegoats by the AIFF to protect their own interest. After Juniors death, no one was pulled up except for Balu, who was one of Indias top referees. In the Santosh Trophy, Manipur players pushed around the referee. Same did the Fransa footballers in the Federation Cup. Was any of these footballers ever punished? The only person to be sidelined was Saji Kurian even though the match commissioners report went in his favour. 

Datta said he would not stop posting Bikramjit during the second phase of the NFL. The AIFF did not ban him officially. He was only sent back from Goa after the match. We consider him a good and upcoming young referee.

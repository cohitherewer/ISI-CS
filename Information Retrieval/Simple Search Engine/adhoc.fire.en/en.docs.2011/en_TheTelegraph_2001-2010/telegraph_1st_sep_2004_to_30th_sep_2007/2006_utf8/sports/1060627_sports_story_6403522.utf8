 Win will be perfect way to celebrate birthday: Raul

Hanover: Spain captain Raul Gonzalez hopes to celebrate his 29th birthday Tuesday by knocking France out of the World Cup and ending the career of former Real Madrid teammate Zinedine Zidane. 

Its the first time Ill be celebrating my birthday during a tournament because in the past we have usually been put out earlier than this on the 24th or 25th, said Raul. But tomorrow Ill be forgetting all the personal things and concentrating on the team and the game. The perfect way to celebrate will be with a win, he said on Monday. 

Raul warned that the French had yet to play their best in the tournament. 

In their earlier matches, they did not play at their highest level, but with the players they have, they can do a great mach at any moment, said Raul, who is Spains all-time top scorer with 44 goals. 

They have been world champions and European champions, and we have not done anything, Raul said. We want to be like them. I think the ambition and spirit that we have will be to our advantage. (Agencies)

 Nicky Boje to bring lawyer as well

 - CHAMPIONS TROPHY 

 Gibbs and Boje have said they will cooperate with the police 

Durban: South Africa batsman Herschelle Gibbs and bowler Nicky Boje have made themselves available for the Champions Trophy tournament in India starting next month. 

Since 2000, the pair have declined to tour India over fears they may be detained in connection with police investigations into matchfixing. 

Herschelle and Nicky have confirmed that they will go to India if selected, and that they will co-operate fully with any interviews which the Indian police may wish to hold with them, a Cricket South Africa (CSA) release quoted chief executive Gerald Majola as saying on Friday. 

CSA will now put forward their names to the selection panel and support them in need, which we hope will assist in the investigation, in order to minimise any disruption to the teams training and playing programme. Their lawyers will also be available to take appropriate steps to protect all of their rights. 

The statement said the players lawyers would accompany them to India. 

Six years ago, Gibbs was fined and suspended for six months after admitting he agreed to under-perform in a one-day International against India in exchange for money. 

The offer was relayed to him by then South African captain Hansie Cronje, who was subsequently banned from cricket for life. Bojes name was mentioned in taped telephone conversations between Cronje and figures in crickets gambling underworld, however, no further evidence has been found to implicate the spinner in the scandal. 

In an interview in a magazine, the 32-year-old Gibbs was quoted as saying the Indian police were being hard-a**** and had refused his offers to answer their questions on neutral ground. 

Gibbs backtracked from that position in the CSA statement. 

I recognise that the police have their processes to follow and I am sorry if it has appeared that I was critical of these, the statement quoted Gibbs as saying. 

Im now really looking forward to representing my country in India at the Champions Trophy.

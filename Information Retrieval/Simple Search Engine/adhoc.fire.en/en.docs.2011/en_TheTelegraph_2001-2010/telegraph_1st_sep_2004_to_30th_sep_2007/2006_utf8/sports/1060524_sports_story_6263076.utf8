Basseterre (St Kitts): Virender Sehwag returned among runs but India made a complete hash of a splendid start to finish at a disappointing 245 for nine in their 50 overs against the West Indies in the third one-dayer here on Tuesday. 

 After 11 overs, the West Indies were 36 for two. Chris 

 Gayle was batting on 16, accompanied by Ramnaresh Sarwan 

 on 4. Ajit Agarkar and Sreesanth took a wicket each. 

Rahul Dravids boys were coasting along merrily at 174 for two in the 29th over before three run-outs and a few careless shots pegged them back to a moderate total at the Warner Park. 

Sehwag cracked a brilliant 97 from 81 balls and put on 112 runs with Mohammed Kaif (61), before the wickets began to fall in a heap. 

The collapse saw India lose six wickets for only 30 runs in 11-odd overs and instead of looking at a figure of 300 and beyond, were gasping to make it to 250. 

India won the toss and chose to bat first on a wicket, which was expected to get slower as the day progressed. 

Captain Rahul Dravid left in the first over when he missed an on-drive against Ian Bradshaw and was ruled out leg before wicket. 

Bradshaw also picked up Indias second wicket when he clean bowled Suresh Raina, though the innings by then had acquired a momentum through Sehwag. 

The right hander reached his half-century off just 43 balls with seven fours and one six as he took a heavy toll of the West Indies opening bowlers. 

Even though India lost two early wickets, they had raced to 91 for two at the 15-over stage. 

Sehwag played a flowing innings with swashbuckling square cuts and soaring hits. Kaif was an able foil and the two put on a century stand for the third wicket. 

Sehwag made a dash towards his century as he lofted Dwayne Bravo out of the ground and then banged Chris Gayle over the long-off fence. 

He then swatted a four off bravo past the wicketkeeper, but was then ruled out leg before which hit his outstretched boot, way down the track but well in the line of stumps. 

Sehwag hit nine fours and three sixes. 

Still there was no sign of an imminent collapse as Kaif and new-man Mahendra Singh Dhoni went about collecting their singles without much ado. 

A couple of run-outs in quick succession however were to change the scenario completely. 

Dhoni (15) started the rot when he chose to go for a run off a misfield by bowler Gayle who recovered in time to throw down the non-strikers end. 

Kaif was cross with himself when he made the ground but his bat was up in the air when wicketkeeper Calrton Baugh Jr broke the stumps. 

Kaif made 61 from 83 balls with two fours. 

Irfan Pathan played too early at a Marlon Samuels off-break and spooned a return catch to the bowler while Ramesh Powar was horrified to see a Ramnaresh Sarwan leg-spin miss his sweep and roll down to his stumps off his pads. 

The third run-out of the innings was amateurish. 

Ajit Agarkar made a drive back to the non-strikers end and took off for a single even as the ball had deflected by only a couple of feet leaving no option to Venugopal Rao but to saunter down the track without any purpose. 

Yuvraj Singh was forced to sit out owing to a stiff back. Rao replaced him in the XI.

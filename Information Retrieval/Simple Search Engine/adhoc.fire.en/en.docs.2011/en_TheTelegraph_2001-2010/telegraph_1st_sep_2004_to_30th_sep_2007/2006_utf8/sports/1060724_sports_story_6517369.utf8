 Vaughan hopes to return before World Cup 

 Missing Ashes frustrating, says Vaughan 

London: Michael Vaughan has said he intends to return to cricket early next year and play a part in Englands World Cup campaign in the West Indies. 

Vaughan, Englands Ashes winning captain last year, has been ruled out of the return series in Australia starting in November after undergoing a fourth knee operation earlier this month. 

But the Yorkshire batsman is optimistic he can feature in one-day fixtures against Australia and New Zealand in January and February and so prove his fitness in time for the World Cup, which starts in March. 

Its going to be a long road but hopefully Ill be back playing cricket again in the early part of 2007, Vaughan told a news channel on Saturday. 

Its been a tough year, I thought Id got very close to being fit to play and it wasnt right so I had to have another operation. 

At least it looks like Im on the upward slide now and I can look forward to playing cricket again. 

Its going to be quite a hard rehab but Im looking forward to getting back in 2007. 

Its frustrating. Its not nice to miss any tournament but to miss the biggest one (the Ashes), with what happened last year, I would have loved to have gone down there to try to win them again. 

But thats not to be. I have to look forward and try to get fit for the early part of 2007, try to play a part in the one-day games and also the World Cup in March.

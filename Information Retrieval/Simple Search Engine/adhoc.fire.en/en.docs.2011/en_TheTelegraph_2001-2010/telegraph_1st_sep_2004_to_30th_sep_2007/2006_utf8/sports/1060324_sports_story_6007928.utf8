 Chelsea enter FA Cup semis 

 European Round-up

 London: Champions Chelsea, 

 looking for a Premier League and Cup double, reached the 

 semi-finals of the FA Cup on Wednesday with a bad-tempered 

 1-0 win over a depleted Newcastle United, who had Robbie 

 Elliott sent off.

 Chelsea, 12 points clear in the 

 league, needed only four minutes to find the target, Damien 

 Duffs corner from the left meeting John Terry low 

 in the area and the captain slotting the ball into the net 

 off the legs of a defender.

 Newcastle, looking for their first 

 silverware for more than 50 years and first win at Chelsea 

 for 20, frequently rattled Chelsea going forward in a physically 

 bruising encounter, although they struggled to create any 

 clear opportunities.

 Elliott was sent off in the 86th 

 minute for a second bookable offence.

 Defeat ended former England skipper 

 Alan Shearers hopes of winning a trophy with his beloved 

 Newcastle. The clubs record goalscorer will retire 

 at the end of the season.

 Meanwhile, Ronaldo ended his goalscoring 

 drought by grabbing a last-gasp equaliser to earn Real Madrid 

 a dramatic 1-1 draw at Real Zaragoza on Wednesday.

 Sania slips to No. 40

New Delhi: Sania Mirza had contrasting luck in the WTA Tour singles and doubles rankings released on Monday. 

According to information received here, the 19-year-old Indian slipped down two places to 40 in the singles but jumped two positions to 37 in the doubles. 

The slip in singles rankings comes despite a first round win at Istanbul where she also reached the doubles final with Australian Alicia Molik. 

The Hyderabadi girl, who returned to action after a three-week break last week, is set to play former champion Anatasia Myskina in the first round of the French Open now underway in Paris. 

Swiss Roger Federer and Frenchwoman Amelie Mauresmo continued to lead their respective rankings, with no changes in the top ten on either being recorded.

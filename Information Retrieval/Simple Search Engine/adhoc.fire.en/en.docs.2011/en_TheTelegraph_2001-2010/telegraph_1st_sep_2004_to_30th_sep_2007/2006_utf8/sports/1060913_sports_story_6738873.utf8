Bali: Indias Shikha Uberoi lost in the first round of the Bali International on Tuesday, going down 7-6, 1-6, 3-6 to Slovenias Andreja Klepac. 

The first big-name casualty of the meet was Daniela Hantuchova, the fifth-seed Slovakian going down 5-7, 2-6 to Hungarian left-hander Melinda Czink. 

Hantuchova held the upper hand in the early stages to build a 5-2 lead before squandering three set points on Czinks serve. 

The missed opportunities seemed to derail the Slovakian and she dropped her next two service games before Czink then held off a break point when leading 6-5 to serve out for the opening set. 

Three breaks of serve at the start of the second set left Czink leading 2-1 and a fine backhand drive gave her a further break for a decisive 5-2 lead. 

In another upset, Olga Poutchkova of Russia defeated Serbian fourth seed Ana Ivanovic 6-3, 4-6, 6-2. 

Third seed Lindsay Davenport of the US also moved into the second round with a 7-5, 6-1 triumph over Russian Galina Voskoboeva. 

Frances Marion Bartoli advanced, the sixth seed sweeping aside localk girl Ayu Fani Damayanti 6-1, 6-0, while ninth seed Aiko Nakamura of Japan beat Thailands Suchanan Viratprasert 7-6 (7-2), 6-4.

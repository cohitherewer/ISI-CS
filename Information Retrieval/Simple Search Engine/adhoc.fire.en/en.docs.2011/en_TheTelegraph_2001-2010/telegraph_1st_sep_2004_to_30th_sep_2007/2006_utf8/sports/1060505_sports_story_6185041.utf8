 Sreesanth: Aggression comes to me naturally

 Sreesanth

Bangalore: Aggression comes to him naturally, says Indias new pace find Sreesanth, grateful nevertheless for the high praise for his aggressive trait from Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq. 

Its something which I have been doing since my under-13 days. It is something that comes to me naturally. May be because I always used to play with the elder guys... May be that helped, the 24-year-old speedster said. 

His stupendous enthusiasm for the game comes through when he says: I dont mind which wicket you play ? wet, dry, slow or fast. I just want to play cricket. 

Inzamam had recently showered praise on the Kerala bowler, saying he had the aggression which was extremely essential for a fast bowler and that he was not afraid to look into the eyes of any batsman or pass a remark or two. 

The Pakistan skipper had also remarked that Sreesanth had the potential to become one of the most feared fast bowlers in the world. 

Too new to the international scene, Sreesanth does not appear to be bothered about the latest topic of discussion among the worlds cricketers ? the player burnout. 

I am a rhythmic bowler. I have just played seven months of international cricket. I play a lot of cricket. I just want to play, play and play. 

Asked to comment on Inzamams views on him, Sreesanth said: It gives me pleasure and more ideas to work on. Its a great encouragement as a fast bowler. Pakistani captain talking about me and (Suresh) Raina, it feels really good. 

Sreesanth says he is now focussed on improving his bowling, particularly the yorkers. 

I am really looking only at the next match. I am going to MRF Pace Foundation tomorrow. I just want to work on my fast bowling. I am basically working on my yorkers. I am also doing my strength work and lots of running. 

I just want to keep the basics right. I wont really try to do extra. But obviously, as a cricketer once you go into the field, that extra comes out naturally. I will always push myself as I have been doing.

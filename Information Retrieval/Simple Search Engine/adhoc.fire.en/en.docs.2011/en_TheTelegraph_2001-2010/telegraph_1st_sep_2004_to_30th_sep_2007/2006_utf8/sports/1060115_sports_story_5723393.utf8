Melbourne: Serena and Venus Williams assured potential opponents on Saturday they are fully fit for the Australian Open starting on Monday after an injury-plagued 2005. 

Although Serena won the Australian Open title and Venus triumphed at Wimbledon, neither has played much since the US Open. 

Serena, in particular, has been the subject of speculation about her fitness heading into her first round match on Monday. 

Ive had more time to prepare this year because I just took (time) off since October, she told reporters. Ive had more time to prepare mentally and much more physically. Honestly, Ive never read any comments about my fitness. I dont read the papers. 

Serena said it would be dangerous for her opponents to underestimate her fitness levels. 

It would be like, oh, shes not fit. Thats cool with me.Thats a great position to be in. 

Venus, who suffered a knee injury and illness last year, said she had now recovered and was 100 percent fit.

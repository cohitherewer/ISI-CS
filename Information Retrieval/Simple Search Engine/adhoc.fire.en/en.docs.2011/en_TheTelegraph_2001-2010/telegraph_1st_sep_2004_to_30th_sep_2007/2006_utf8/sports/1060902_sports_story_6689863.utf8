 Jeev tied 16th on rain-hit day

Tokyo: Jeev Milkha Singh braved rain and bad weather to turn in a card of one-over 72 and finish tied 16th at the end of second round of the 150-million Fujisankei Classic golf at the Fujizakura Country Club in Japan on Friday. 

Shingo Katayama was even par for 13 holes but his five-under 66 overnight ensured he had a one-stroke over Taichi Teshima who shot 67 on Friday. The clubhouse leader with two complete rounds was Yano Azuma, who had rounds of 70 and 69 and was three-under for 36 holes. 

Jeev had two birdies on seventh. (PTI)

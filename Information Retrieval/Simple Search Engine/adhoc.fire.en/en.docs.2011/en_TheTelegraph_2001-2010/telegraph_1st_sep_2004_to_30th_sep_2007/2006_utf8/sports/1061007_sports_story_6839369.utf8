 Younis mum on captaincy drama

Karachi: Pakistan batsman Younis Khan on Friday refused to spell out the reasons for his sensational rejection of captaincy just hours before the start of the Champions Trophy. 

Whatever the reasons are for leaving the captaincy I dont think this is the appropriate time to discuss it. When the time comes I will let it be known, he said. But the prolific run-getter asserted that his commitment to the team and new captain Mohammed Yousuf would be 200 per cent. 

In a strange twist of fate, the Mardan-born Pathan has also been offered the captaincy of English county side Yorkshire for next season. 

Younis said he had accepted it but the final contract was yet to be signed. 

It is a great honour to be the captain of Yorkshire where so many great players have played at Headingley. I know their conditions well, Younis added. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 ODIs vs India a continuation of World Cup preparations

 - Sourav is experienced, yes, but options have worked, says Bob Woolmer 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Peshawar: Greg Chappell isnt the only one who has his sights on the 2007 World Cup ? Bob Woolmer, too, is planning for crickets most high-profile competition. 

Our preparations started with the last home series, against England, and the one which begins here on Monday will be a continuation... For obvious reasons, its a big series, Woolmer told The Telegraph at the Pearl Continental on Saturday evening. 

The Pakistan coach added: In fact, I endorse what my captain (Inzamam-ul Haq) has said ? that this five-match series is going to help us get a 360-degree view of what we can and cannot do in ODIs... 

For the record, after the ODIs versus India, Pakistan have a string of commitments overseas ? Sri Lanka, England and the Champions Trophy in India ? before hosting a tri-series against the West Indies and Zimbabwe. Then, shortly before the (March-April) World Cup, Pakistan will be off to South Africa. 

Weve got a nice build-up and, hopefully, were going to be able to learn from every series/tournament... The period between now and the World Cup will be utilised for having systems and strategies in place, Woolmer declared. 

He continued: Also, we intend giving exposure to those players who arent that experienced... Thats central to our plans as everybody in the reckoning should be ready for the toughest challenges... The roles are going to be clearly defined, yet there will be room for flexibility. 

Looking ahead, Woolmer felt both India and Pakistan start with a fifty-fifty chance: It cant be any different as the best players are representing their country and, when the best battle, anything may happen... For me, each match is going to start fifty-fifty. 

However, he remarked that Indias recent 6-1 win over Sri Lanka (at home) was a dangerous sign and rated the visitors very highly. 

Asked to comment on Sourav Ganguly not being picked, Woolmer laughed: Thats a horrible question... I dont know what to say... Well, of late, the Indians have done well without him... Hes experienced, yes, but options have worked... 

 [As reported in these columns from Karachi, one gentlemans strong disapproval meant Sourav had to return home after the Tests instead of staying back as the 16th member.] 

Reflecting on the Test series, which Pakistan won 1-0 in stunning manner, Woolmer observed: The biggest positive is that the young players stood up to be counted ? the Kamran Akmals and Mohammed Asifs... Also, (Abdul) Razzaq performed with both bat and ball to silence critics... 

Nobodys place in the XI is guaranteed, but Razzaq made a very fine comeback... Today, it does appear weve got a wider pool of gifted players to choose from and somebody like Mohammed Sami now knows making a comeback wont be easy. 

Woolmer ended our one-on-one by saying one of his objectives ? inculcating a desire to win ? had been achieved. Yet, other goals remain.

 Ferdinand hits winner 

Manchester: Rio Ferdinand thumped home a header in the 90th minute to give Manchester United a 1-0 Premier League win over Liverpool on Sunday. 

The second and third-placed teams appeared to have cancelled each other out in a midfield-dominated clash high on effort but short of goal chances. 

United snatched the points when Ryan Giggs curled in a free-kick from the left and England centre back Ferdinand rose unchallenged to head past Pepe Reina. 

The win takes United to 48 points and closed the gap to leaders Chelsea to 14 points after the champions were held to a 1-1 home draw by Charlton Athletic earlier.

 Indians off to a flier

 Holland Chess

 Vlissingen (The Netherlands): 

 Grandmaster Dibyendu Barua, International Masters Saptarshi 

 Roy Chowdhury and Saptarshi Roy, and Roktim Bandyopadhyay 

 got off to a flying start in the Hogeschool Zeeland International 

 Chess Tournament here.

 Another Indian, Parimarjan Negi 

 started his campaign with easy victories in the first two 

 rounds of the. There were no major upsets recorded on the 

 opening day of the nine-round tournament and all the seeded 

 players sailed through over their lesser-known opponents.

 In the first round, Negi had an 

 easy outing against De Hert Oliver of The Netherlands in 

 a Noteboom Variation game where the Indian played with black 

 pieces.

 The huge difference in rating 

 of two players was pivotal in the outcome of the game as 

 Negi won in 31 moves.

 In the second round, Negi won 

 with white pieces against Geralt Serdijn.

 It was a similar story for the 

 other Indians in the fray in the first two rounds as all 

 the remaining three coasted home without much troubles in 

 the event being played in the Swiss format. (PTI)

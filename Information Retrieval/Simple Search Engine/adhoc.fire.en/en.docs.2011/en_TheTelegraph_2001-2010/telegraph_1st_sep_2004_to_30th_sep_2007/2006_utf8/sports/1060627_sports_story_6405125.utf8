 Nostradamus vote for Spain

Moscow: If Nostradamus has his way, Spain are all set to lift this edition of the World Cup. Spanish journalists have managed to find a prediction made by Nostradamus in 1555 about the outcome of the 2006 World Cup, a Russian magazine said in a report. 

The 16th century prophet wrote: The Spanish king and his army will cross over the Pyrenees at the end of the sixth month of the sixth year. The king will win the battle with Beelzebub on the fields of central Europe, and the army will return the Holy Grail to Spain. 

Interpreting the prediction, the journalists said, the Spanish king and his army stands for the Spanish team and their coach Luis Aragones. 

The fields of Central Europe stand are the stadiums in Germany and the Holy Grail is the World Cup, the report said. (PTI)

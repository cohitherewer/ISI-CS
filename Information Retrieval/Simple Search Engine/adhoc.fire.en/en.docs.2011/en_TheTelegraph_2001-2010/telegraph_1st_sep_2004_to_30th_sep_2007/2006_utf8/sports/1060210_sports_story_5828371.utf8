 Kapur tied 11th after Round I

Perth: Shiv Kapur eclipsed his more illustrious partners Fred Couples and Craig Parry with an impressive four-under-par 68 to be tied 11th in the star-studded Johnnie Walker Classic golf tournament here on Thursday. 

Kapur, last years Rookie of the Year, accumulated five birdies against a lone bogey at the Vines Resort and Country Club, three shots better than Couples, a former US Masters winner, and matching Parry, one of Australias greats. 

Indias other two challengers ? Gaurav Ghei (72) and Jeev Milkha Singh (78) ? were tied 67th and 148th in the field. 

Australias Adam Scott launched his title defence in imperious style, shooting a blistering eight-under-par 64 for the joint first round lead with Kevin Stadler of the US. 

Two three-putt pars on the par five 10th and 18th holes left a bitter taste in the mouth for the reigning Volvo Masters of Asia winner, but Kapur enjoyed his moment in the sun playing with two giants of the game. 

Its a shame to three-putt the last for par. Anytime you finish the round badly just leaves a bad taste, but Ill come out on Friday and go low again, said Kapur.

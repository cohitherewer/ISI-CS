The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Nobody has his place guaranteed

Stickwork

 The Premier Hockey League (PHL) 

 is fast emerging as the best thing to have happened in the 

 Indian perspective of the game. The second edition of the 

 meet has just concluded in Chandigarh, and what pleased 

 me most was the massive interest of the crowd in it. About 

 10-15 thousand spectators thronged the stadium in each game, 

 and the number swelled further in the three-match finals. 

 The PHL has become sort of a search 

 machine, an occasion where the entire talent pool of Indian 

 hockey is on display. Apart from the general lovers of the 

 game, the Indian Hockey Federation (IHF), as well as the 

 selectors can have a first-hand observation of what the 

 players are capable of and how the game is making headway 

 towards the future. It is not just a competition par se, 

 but a place which showcases a players talent and skills, 

 which puts a premium on his mental challenges and competitiveness, 

 which presents a case study of how we can move forward in 

 international arena. 

 No wonder, all this has been on 

 display in Chandigarh. As the players were evenly distributed, 

 finding the real winners was really tough. Hyderabad Sultans, 

 Sher-e-Jalandhar and the finalists ? Bangalore Lions and 

 Chandigarh Dynamos ? these four teams were marked out with 

 distinction. Any of them could have made it to the title-round. 

 Bangalore Lions eventually lifted the crown, defeating Chandigarh 

 Dynamos in the three-match series 2-1. 

 Following the PHL, a pool of 20 

 players was picked for the upcoming series against 

 Pakistan and Commonwealth Games. While 18 out of 20 will 

 go to Pakistan, 16 will go to the Commonwealth Games, to 

 be held in Melbourne next month. As these players will be 

 rotated in the two important engagements, the coach needs 

 to take advantage of the situation. 

 Incidentally, the senior pros 

 like Gagan Ajit Singh, Deepak Thakur, Viren Rasquinha and 

 Prabhjot Singh have been dropped. Of course, the door for 

 them has not been closed, but they have not improved on 

 their performance and been pushed by other challengers. 

 I must make it a point here that 

 nobody should feel that his place is guaranteed. Though 

 the goalkeeper Adrian DSouza has retained his berth 

 in the squad, the sooner he come up with a better show, 

 the better for him. 

 This is where competitions like 

 the PHL has its significance, because it has thrown quite 

 a few good players in the limelight. To me, goalkeeper Bharat 

 Chhetri has been the most outstanding player. Ignace Tirkey 

 has also looked in nice shape in midfield while Sandeep 

 Singh has quite improved his field play. Im happy 

 with the performances of Didar Singh, Sardara Singh, Tushar 

 Khandekar, Tejbir Singh and Arjun Halappa in the forward 

 line. Then, there is of course Hari Prasad, who scored twice 

 in the title-decider and was instrumental in Lions 

 march to the PHL crown. 

 Jugraj Singh, a penalty-corner 

 specialist and who had a near-fatal motor accident in 2003, 

 might not have made it to the Indian squad this time around, 

 but he played quite well in the tournament for the Chandigarh 

 outfit and showed the promise of coming back to the national 

 side at any time. 

 In the Commonwealth Games, India 

 seem to be in a easier group, which includes Pakistan, Malaysia, 

 South Africa and Trinidad and Tobago. The other group comprises 

 of Australia, New Zealand, England, Canada and Scotland. 

 India start their campaign against 

 Malaysia on March 17 and the next day face the rivals from 

 across the border. Keeping in mind the fact that Australia 

 will emerge as the best team from the other group, we should 

 try to top our pool and avoid clashing with the Champions 

 Trophy champions in the semi-finals. 

 This India-Pakistan series, thus, 

 is an ideal build-up for the Commonwealth Games. Pakistan 

 have already announced their squad, led by the temperamental 

 Mohammed Saqlain. That they have not included the likes 

 of Sohail Abbas and Mohammed Wasim means they are looking 

 forward with the younger lot. 

 Let me sign off this article with 

 something outside hockey and very significant in our overall 

 sporting context. For quite sometime, noises have been coming 

 from Pakistan about Sourav Ganguly and his non-inclusion 

 in the ODI squad. Its unfortunate, and I believe that 

 the Pakistan players have no business meddling in the Indian 

 affairs. Its nothing but adding tremendous pressure 

 on the player. 

 The former India cricketers are 

 making any brouhaha over why this player or that has not 

 found any place in the Pakistan squad. Captaincy is a separate 

 issue, but the point is Sourav doesnt need any help 

 from across the border to make a comeback. Let a few players 

 fail in the current team, and hell return resoundingly 

 to the side. You can be rest assured about it.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Stage set for Sanath return

Nottingham: Sanath Jayasuriya looks set to make his Test comeback against England at Trent Bridge on Friday just a month after retiring. 

Sri Lanka captain Mahela Jayawardene told reporters on the eve of the third and final Test that Jayasuriya had a very good chance of playing. 

Sri Lanka have axed batsman Thilan Samaraweera and fast bowler Nuwan Kulasekara from the side which lost by six wickets at Edgbaston. Fast bowler Nuwan Zoysa, as well as Jayasuriya, join a 12-man squad. 

England have retained the same 12 from the second Test, resisting the temptation to fast-track Michael Vaughan.

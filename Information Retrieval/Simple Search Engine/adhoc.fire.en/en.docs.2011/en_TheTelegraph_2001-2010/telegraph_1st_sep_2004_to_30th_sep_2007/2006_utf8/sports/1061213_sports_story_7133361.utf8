The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Foolproof security promised

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Cricket fans travelling to the Caribbean for World Cup 2007 can rest assured about their security as the host countries for the event have put unprecedented measures in place, according to information received here. 

Cricket World Cup is the worlds third largest sporting event and we are expecting thousands of people to Caribbean for it. We will ensure that people feel safe and as a result we will implement several security measures, said Mia Mottley, deputy Prime Minister of Barbados. 

Mottley, who is also chairperson of the Caribbean community sub-committee for CWC 2007 security, said the region was mindful of the global war on terror. 

In the Caribbean, we are not at risk for acts of terrorism. However, reality dictates we take every step to ensure we provide a secure environment, she said.

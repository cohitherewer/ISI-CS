Calcutta: A third national title has whetted Mouma Das appetite and the Madhyamgram girl has set her sights on a Commonwealth Games medal. 

 I am confident we will bag more than two medals at the Melbourne Games. I am sure about the doubles and the team event? Im also expecting good results in the individual events, Mouma told The Telegraph a few hours after returning triumphant from the Jaipur nationals. 

The three-week training in China earlier this month was a big step forward for the Indian paddlers, said Mouma. 

The stint in China taught us many things and helped us realise where exactly we stand vis-?-vis the world standard. Of course, it would have been better had it been a three-month affair instead of three weeks. 

Asked who was the inspiration behind her impressive win in the nationals, Mouma said it was her coach Jayanta Pushilal. The presence of my coach helped me win this much needed title, she added. 

This was one of my toughest national meets. Everyday I used to pray to god to give me some luck, said Mouma, who had lost four previous finals including last years to Poulami Ghatak. 

Interestingly, Mouma trounced Mantu Ghosh ? who has been named coach of the Commonwealth Games womens squad ? in the Jaipur final.

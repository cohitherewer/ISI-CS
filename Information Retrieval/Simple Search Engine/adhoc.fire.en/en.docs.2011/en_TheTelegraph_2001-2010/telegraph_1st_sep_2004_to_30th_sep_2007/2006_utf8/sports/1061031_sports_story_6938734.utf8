Miami: South Koreas K.J. Choi carded a solid four-under 67 to claim a comfortable four-shot win at the Chrysler Championship on Sunday, booking a spot in next weeks season-ending Tour championship. 

Chois fourth career win and second Chrysler title comes with a huge bonus, the $954,000 winners cheque propelling the 36-year-old into the PGA Tours top 30 money winners. 

The win also earned him an invitation to East Lake Golf Club in Atlanta next week and a chance at another big payday at the $6.5 million finale. 

Today is No. 4 victory in PGA Tour and I am very, very happy, Choi said, after posting a winning total of 13-under 271. 

Americans Brett Wetterich and Paul Goydos finished four shots back in a tie for second at nine-under 275 in the last full field event of the season. 

Wetterich fired a final round five-under 66 to solidify his place in the top 20 while Goydos returned a one-under 70 to move from 160 into the top 125, securing his playing privileges for next season. 

World No. 7 Ernie Els began the day one shot back of third round leader Choi chasing his first PGA Tour win in two years and clinging to the 30th place on the money list. 

While victory continued to elude the big South African, Els still had a smile on his face walking off the 18th green, his one-over 72 enough to earn him a share of sixth place at seven-under 277 and an place in the Tour Championship. 

You go through a process like this you appreciate getting to the Tour Championship, said Els. Normally you just walk in there but this time it was hard work. 

After the front nine I knew the tournament was over for me but I knew I still had to try and get a top five finish. 

Choi, the 2002 Chrysler winner by a seven strokes, got his day off to a dazzling start draining a 20-foot putt for an eagle at the par five first at the Palm Harbour Copperhead course. (Reuters)

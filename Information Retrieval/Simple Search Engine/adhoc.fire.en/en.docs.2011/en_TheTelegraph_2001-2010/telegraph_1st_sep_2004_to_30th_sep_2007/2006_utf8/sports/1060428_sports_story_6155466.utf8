New Delhi: The curtain for the ICC Champions Trophy in India was officially raised in the capital on Thursday with Ehsan Mani claiming that it would be an ideal platform for the 10 participating teams to gauge their strength before next years World Cup in the West Indies. 

As per the tournament schedule released on Thursday, India will open their campaign in group A against England in Jaipur on October 15. 

The hosts will then meet one of the qualifiers from the preliminary round in Ahmedabad on October 26 and Australia in Mohali on October 29. 

Though both Mani and Pawar said the matches have been spaced out in a manner which will help the teams play in a relaxed atmosphere, the venues raised quite a few eyebrows. 

While Mohali, CCI (Mumbai) and Ahmedabad will host five matches each in the October 7 to November 5 tournament, Jaipur ? not among the top international venues ? has got as many as six games. 

It was not known whether the Rajasthan Cricket Associations proximity to top bosses in the BCCI was the reason behind Jaipur getting half-a-dozen ties, but Pawar said facilities in all stadia will get a facelift prior to the tourn-ament. 

All the matches will be day-night affairs. We will instal floodlights at the CCI and Jaipur, informed Pa- war. 

Mani said that originally there were to be three venues. The BCCI asked for a fourth one the terms for which have been settled mutually. There are no more issues. 

The press conference had a smooth beginning but ended rather abruptly following a series of bouncers from the scribes. 

What transpired among the officials on the dais was not audible, but a polite thank you came sooner than expected. 

The six seeded teams are Australia, South Africa, India, Pakistan, New Zealand and England. Four teams ? holders West Indies. Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Zimbabwe ? will feature in the preliminary round, from which two will make the tournament proper. 

The eight teams in the meet proper have been divided into two groups, the top two qualifying for the semis on November 1 (Mohali) and 2 (Jaipur). The final comes off at the CCI on November 5.

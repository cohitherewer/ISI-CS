The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Zagreb: Former Wimbledon champion Goran Ivanisevic ended speculation on Monday that he might take over the captaincy of Croatia?s Davis Cup team.

 ?I?ve said it a hundred times and don?t know how many more times I have to repeat it. I will definitely not be the coach,? he told a news conference unveiling a new ATP tournament in Zagreb.

 Ivanisevic, 34, had been tipped to succeed coach Niki Pilic who guided Croatia to their first Davis Cup title in December.

 Pilic resigned this month, forcing number one player Ivan Ljubicic to become a playing captain in the first round tie against Austria in February.

 Melbourne: Australia?s two-time Grand Slam champion Pat Rafter believes it?s time to get involved in tennis again, but he has no intention of making a comeback to the men?s tour.

 Rafter, twice a US Open champion and a former world No. 1 was elected on Monday to the international tennis Hall of Fame, along with Argentina?s Gabriela Sabatini. 

 Rafter has captured 11 singles titles in his 12-year career with a 358-191 win-loss record.

 A degenerative shoulder injury caused by 12 years of constant serve-volleying forced rafter to quit the game at the age of 30 and he has been away from tennis since making the break in January 2003. But the popular rafter said he was prepared to return and help out coaching juniors, but knocked back any suggestion of a comeback to the mens world circuit.

 Madrid: Juan Carlos Valeron?s hopes of making Spain?s squad for this year?s World Cup were shattered on Sunday when the Deportivo Coruna midfielder tore the cruciate ligament in his left knee during a Primera Liga match.

 Deportivo said Valeron, who has been back to his best form in recent weeks, would be out of action for six to eight months. Valeron has won over 40 caps and played in the 2002 World Cup and Euro 2004.

 Paris: Real Madrid midfielder Zinedine Zidane denied that he will retire from soccer after this year?s World Cup.

 Spanish press reports said that the 33-year-old French international told Real Madrid president Florentino Perez that he planned to quit soccer after the World Cup finals, which starts from June 9.

 ?That?s not the case, but over here these type of little things are normal to fill the pages of newspapers,? Zidane said on Sunday. ?You shouldn?t attach too much importance to it. I let others talk and concentrate on what I have to do.?

 Eriksson set for ?3 m pay-off

Matt Dickinson

 Eriksson thinks his days as England coach are numbered 

Sven-Goran Eriksson is willing to go quietly after the World Cup finals but the Football Association will have to make it worth his while. The England head coach and his advisers will sit down with his employer in the next few weeks, but it could take at least ?3 m to persuade him to walk away from a contract that will still have two more years to run in July. 

Giving Eriksson a substantial pay-off will prove galling for those National Game members of the FA board who were bewildered by the extension of his contract until 2008 ? and for his more vocal critics in the media and in the stands ? but the Swede sees no reason why he should leave with nothing. 

He has come under fierce criticism in the wake of the ?fake sheikh? scandal, with David O?Leary and the League Managers Association (LMA) registering strong complaints on Tuesday, but, while Eriksson has accepted that his days in the England job are numbered, he is not about to sacrifice his payoff just because he has been tricked by an undercover reporter into making indiscreet remarks. 

It was the FA that gave him his lucrative new contract in a deal approved by existing board members including Geoff Thompson, the chairman, Dave Richards, the chairman of the FA Premier League, and David Dein, the vice-chairman of Arsenal. They approved the pay rise to almost ? 4.5m a year, but that deal could cost them a substantial sum. 

Eriksson?s advisers and Brian Barwick, the FA chief executive, are agreed that an exit strategy should be hammered out sooner rather than later, but there could be some fierce haggling. The FA would normally hope to mitigate against a big payoff by waiting to see if Eriksson walks straight into employment in August, but that will not be possible if a deal is to be struck before the World Cup. 

The Swede?s lawyers insist that he has not breached his contract, even though he told a reporter that he might be available for hire after the tournament. The discussion about the possibility of buying Aston Villa on Tuesday led O?Leary to express his anger. 

?It is not acceptable that the national coach speaks publicly about replacing another manager whilst he is in the post,? the Villa manager said.

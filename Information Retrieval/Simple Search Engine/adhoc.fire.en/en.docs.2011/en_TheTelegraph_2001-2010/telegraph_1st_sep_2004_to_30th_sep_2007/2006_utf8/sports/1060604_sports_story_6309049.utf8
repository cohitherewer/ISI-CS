 WADA rejects report clearing Armstrong

Montreal: The head of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) blasted a report clearing seven-time Tour de France champion Lance Armstrong of doping allegations as bordering on farcical on Friday. 

Chairman Dick Pound said in a statement that WADA was considering legal action after the investigation headed by lawyer Emile Vrijman and the Dutch law firm Scholten accused the agency of behaving in ways completely inconsistent with testing rules. 

The independent investigation exonerated Armstrong of doping during the 1999 Tour, which he won, and determined the testing procedures at the French national doping laboratory LNDD had been insufficient to label the Americans sample positive.

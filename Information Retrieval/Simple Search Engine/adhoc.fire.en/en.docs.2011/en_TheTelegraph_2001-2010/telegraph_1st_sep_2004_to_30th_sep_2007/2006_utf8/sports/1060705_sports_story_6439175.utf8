 QUICK TAKES

 We 

 were too tired during penalties: Crouch

 London: Englands 

 pathetic penalty shooting in the World Cup was due to the 

 players being exhausted with a man down after the 62nd minute 

 expulsion of Wayne Rooney, according to striker Peter Crouch. 

 The lanky striker said that at the end of 30 minutes of 

 extra-time under the hot, steamy conditions, the England 

 players were on their last legs. I honestly felt exhaustion 

 set in at the end against Portugal. Wed played quite 

 a lot of the game with 10 men and I think we took the penalties 

 in a tired way. Everyone worked so hard and I genuinely 

 feel everyone had given everything by the time we had to 

 take the spot-kicks. That definitely showed in the penalties 

 we had to take.

 Ronaldinho statue burnt down 

 Rio de Janeiro: Angry Brazilian fans burnt 

 down a 7m tall statue of world Player of the Year Ronaldinho 

 following the national teams quarter final exit. The 

 statue, made out of resin and iron, in the southern town 

 of Chapeco in Santa Catarina state, was burnt on Saturday 

 night, after the Selecaos 0-1 defeat to Les Bleus, 

 according to the local mayors spokesperson. All 

 thats left is a burnt out metal skeleton of a statue, 

 the source said. The monument, depicting Ronaldinho with 

 a ball, was inaugurated two years ago to celebrate the players 

 first world Player of the Year award in 2004.

 Parreira wont quit 

 Rio de Janeiro: Brazil returned home to little 

 fanfare with coach Carlos Alberto Parreira escaping via 

 a back door to avoid fans and the media. Only a few supporters 

 bothered to turn up to jeer the squad. Later, at a press 

 conference, Parreira said: No one here wanted to be 

 champion of the world more than me. On his future 

 as coach, Parreira said he would only discuss that after 

 talking with confederation president Ricardo Teixeira.

 Zicos new club 

 Istanbul: Fenerbahce has signed former Brazilian 

 international and ex-Japan coach Zico to replace German 

 coach Christoph Daum, the club said on Tuesday. Zico has 

 signed a two-year contract with the Istanbul-based team, 

 their website said.

 Card rule may change 

 Berlin: Players are likely to be suspended 

 from playing in future World Cup matches after receiving 

 three yellow cards in a round instead of two as is the custom 

 now, Fifa president Sepp Blatter said on Tuesday. In 

 a competition like the World Cup it should perhaps be three 

 yellow cards in the first round and three in the second. 

 This is a wise suggestion and we will take it up. 

 He said there would be no change to the current rules in 

 matches with two yellow cards still leading to a sending-off. 

 There is no intention to change that, he said. Blatter also 

 said that the decision to ban Torsten Frings against Italy 

 should have come sooner.

 Blatter raps 'actors' 

 Berlin: Fifa president Sepp Blatter criticised 

 the growing practice by players of feigning injury in an 

 attempt to pressurise their opponents into kicking the ball 

 into touch to stop a promising attack. Lying on the 

 ground and pretending to be injured is just abusing (the 

 convention) of stopping play for injury, said Blatter. 

 It is just cheating and we must look at this in the 

 future. I have seen it myself and I do not like it. The 

 fans dont like it, but what it does is: it makes the 

 team with the ball stop when perhaps there is nothing wrong.

 Apologises, too... 

 Berlin: Fifa president Sepp Blatter said on 

 Tuesday he regretted criticising Russian referee Valentin 

 Ivanov for his handling of the heated second-round match 

 between Portugal and The Netherlands. I would just 

 like to say that I regret what has happened, Blatter 

 said on Tuesday. I regret what I said about his actions 

 in the match between Portugal and the Netherlands.

 Scolari contract 

 Lisbon: The Portuguese football federation 

 is close to securing a new contract with coach Luiz Felipe 

 Scolari, who led the national team to the world cup semi-finals 

 for the first time in 40 years. I have spoken to Scolari, 

 we have talked, and at the right moment you will be informed, 

 Gilberto Madail, federation chief, said in Germany on Monday.

 Pizza tactics 

 Berlin: A German newspaper has come up with 

 a way to upset Italians regardless of how Tuesdays 

 World Cup semi-final between the two nations turns out. 

 The newspaper printed the telephone numbers of more than 

 40 pizza outlets from around Germany and suggested readers 

 call them just as the match in Dortmund kicks off. Heres 

 how well annoy the Italians ? order pizza at 9 pm, 

 declared the Berlin-based daily.

 Robbery in fan gear 

 Berlin: Berlin police offered a reward on 

 Monday for information on three pistol-wielding bandits, 

 who robbed a bank in the capitals Marienfeld suburb. 

 Two of the suspects disguised themselves with wigs and scarves 

 in Germanys black, red and yellow, while the third 

 wore a big floppy hat in the national colours, pictures 

 from surveillance cameras showed.

 Homeless World Cup 

 Melbourne: Australia will host the 2008 Homeless 

 World Cup, the annual street soccer tournament featuring 

 national teams of homeless people from around the globe. 

 The event is set for Melbourne in November 2008. The event, 

 whose goal is to help fight poverty, was previously held 

 in Austria (2003), Sweden (2004) and Scotland (2005). This 

 years tournament is set for Cape Town in September 

 2006.

 Thai drinking spree 

 Bangkok: The World Cup has generated too much boozing in Thailand and soccer fans should cut back, the Thai Prime Minister said. Thai people drink too much during the World Cup, Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra said on Tuesday. I would like to encourage them to reduce their drinking or quit the habit.

 Cant win a major every year: Maria

 Sharapova says she would love to win Wimbledon than be No.1 

Tokyo: A defiant Maria Sharapova denied on Tuesday that she had hit the wall after failing to reach the Australian Open final. 

The teenaged Russian said she needed more time to be a regular Grand Slam winner following a painful defeat by Belgiums Justine Henin-Hardenne in the Melbourne semi-finals last week. 

I dont think Ive hit a wall or anything, bristled Sharapova, who has failed to reach a Grand Slam final since winning Wimbledon as a 17-year-old in 2004. 

You expect me to win a Grand Slam every year now? I think you should give more time. 

Sharapova was quick to point out that she has reached the semi-finals in four of the last five Grand Slams and held the world No.1 ranking for seven weeks last year. 

At this point in my career Im more than happy to be in Grand Slam semi-finals, she said before this weeks Pan Pacific Open in Tokyo. 

Just because I won Wimbledon at 17 a lot of people expect you all of a sudden to win every single one. Thats not going to take one day or one week. 

I know that in a few years when I do improve little things in my game by one or two percent that I will get better. 

The Russian glamour girl, currently world No.4, said her priority this year was to win Wimbledon again, not regain the top ranking. 

I would love to win Wimbledon rather than (be No.1), she told reporters. But Im very happy to be consistently in the semi-finals of Grand Slams. 

Im not just overnight going to become an experienced player. I played some great tennis in Australia and Im looking forward to improving and getting further. 

Sharapova won last years Pan Pacific Open title and is scheduled to meet a rejuvenated Martina Hingis in the semi-finals in Tokyo. 

Hingis reached the quarter finals in Melbourne in her first major since retiring through injury in 2002. 

The 25-year-old Swiss won in Tokyo in 1997, 1999, 2000 and 2002.

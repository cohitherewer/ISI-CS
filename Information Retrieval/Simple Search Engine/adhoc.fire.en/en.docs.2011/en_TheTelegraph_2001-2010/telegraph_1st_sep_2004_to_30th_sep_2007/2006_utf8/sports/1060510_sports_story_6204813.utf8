The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 First day-night ODI in Caribbean today 

Castries (St Lucia): West Indies and Zimbabwe will play in the Caribbeans first day-night match when they meet in the fifth one-day International in Castries on Wednesday. 

The Beausejour Stadium was opened in 2002 and floodlights were installed before the A teams of West Indies and England played two matches in March. 

After wins in the first two matches in Antigua and another in Guyana, victory on Wednesday would give the West Indies an unassailable 4-0 series lead with two matches remaining. The third match was cancelled. 

The hosts have made one change to the squad that travelled to Guyana, replacing allrounder Dwayne Bravo with fast bowler Tino Best. 

West Indies 82-run victory in the fourth match on Sunday was set up by a total of 333 for six. 

I am happy, but I still think there are areas which we can work on, and I think the guys batted really well in this game, West Indies captain Brian Lara said. 

Its unfortunate that no one went on to score a hundred and this is something we will have to work on in the remaining matches. 

Zimbabwe captain Terry Duffin said his team, which replied with 251 for seven in Guyana, were improving. 

It was good to see the batting coming along and it was good to see that we can start making good scores, Duffin said. It was good the fought hard in the middle-order and helped us reach a respectable total. 

The last two matches will be played in Trinidad on Saturday and Sunday. (Reuters)

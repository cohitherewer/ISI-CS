 Mauresmo moves closer to maiden Open title

 - Davydenko shatters Murray dreams 

 Nikolay Davydenko in action against Andy Murray in New York on Tuesday 

New York: Top seed Amelie Mauresmo moved closer to her first US Open title by whipping error-prone Dinara Safina 6-2, 6-3 in the quarter finals on Wednesday. 

World No. 1 Mauresmo looked a little shaky on her serve in the opening set but settled down to win the match easily in 62 minutes. 

The Frenchwoman committed only 11 unforced errors to reach the semi-finals in New York for a second time. 

Though she broke Mauresmos serve twice in the opening set, 12th seeded Safina had 15 unforced errors and was broken four times. 

Mauresmo was on cruise control in the second set, firing 10 winners while never losing serve. 

An emotional Safina sprayed the ball and the Russians mishits were often followed by her whacking her racket on the court or shaking her head in disgust. 

Russias Nikolay Davydenko defeated rising British teen Andy Murray 6-1, 5-7, 6-3, 6-0 to advance to his third Grand Slam quarter finals this season. 

The fourth-round match was suspended the day before because rain began when No. 7-seeded Davydenko led two sets to one. When play resumed on a sunny Wednesday morning, Murray committed three double faults in the first game, and Davydenko finished off the match in 36 minutes. 

At 19, Murray enjoyed quite a season, beating Roddick at Wimbledon and last month ending Federers 55-match North American winning streak. 

But when play resumed on Wednesday, the No. 17-seeded Murray could not find his touch. 

Yesterday was a different match, Davydenko said. Today was completely different. 

Though he failed to produce his best against a rock-solid Davydenko, Murray said he was delighted to have reached the last 16 at a Grand Slam for the second time this season. 

(I am) absolutely not disappointed at all, Murray said. I had a great summer. I couldnt have asked for any more. My ranking is inside the top 20. Ive equalled my best result in a Grand Slam in my favourite tournament. 

A lot of the young players can play well for a few weeks and then theyll have a few bad weeks, but Ive kept it up. Since Wimbledon, Ive won at least three matches in every tournament, which is a really good record. 

Murray found Davydenko too good in all departments and said there was little he could have done to change things. 

I never played against someone whos played a set as well as that, he said. I didnt help myself by serving three doubles in the first game. (But) if someone plays like that, sometimes you just have to say, too good. 

The 19-year-old Scot said he was now looking forward to pushing his ranking even closer to the top 10. 

Im so excited now because I think my serve can get much better, my movement can get better, I can get fitter, I can improve my volleys, my slice. Mentally, I can get stronger, said Murray, who is being coached by Brad Gilbert. 

Probably after this tournament, Im going to be ranked 17 in the world. I dont have too many points to defend until Wimbledon next year. So Im going to go for it. 

Im not saying Im going to do it, but theres an outside chance of getting into (the season-ending Masters Cup in) Shanghai. Id love to play in that. 

The rain could end up turning this Open into a real test of endurance. Unlike at most tournaments, men play best-of-five-sets matches throughout Grand Slams, benefiting from the days of rest built into a two-week schedule. But bad weather has been steadily erasing those breaks. 

There have been six day or night sessions cancelled so far, the same number of washouts for the four previous US Opens combined.

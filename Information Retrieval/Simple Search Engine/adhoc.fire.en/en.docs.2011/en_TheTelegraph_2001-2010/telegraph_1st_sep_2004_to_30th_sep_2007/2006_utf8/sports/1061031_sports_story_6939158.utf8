 Vengsarkar makes his mark rightaway

 - Straight-talking selection committee chairman suggested that Jaffer be picked 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Dilip Vengsarkar 

New Delhi: While there can be a debate over who calls the shots in the Team India dressing room, there should be none over who is going to be the boss at selection committee meetings. 

Chairman Dilip Vengsarkar, of course. The former captain stamped his authority, Monday, at the first meeting (in Chandigarh) where his committee had to pick the national squad. 

According to The Telegraphs sources, its Vengsarkar who suggested to his colleagues (Venkatapathi Raju, Bhupinder Singh, Sanjay Jagdale and Ranjib Biswal) plus captain Rahul Dravid and coach Greg Chappell that they look at selecting Wasim Jaffer an acknowledged grafter for the five ODIs in South Africa. 

They went along after Vengsarkar explained why he wanted Jaffer: (a) solid technique; (b) the ability to play on the back foot; (c) ideal temperament to build an innings on wickets which will be very demanding. 

Its probably the boldest move by any selection committee in recent memory. After all, in over six years of international cricket, Jaffer hasnt played a single ODI. Gautam Gambhir lost out as he tends to be flashy and, more important, wouldnt have put vice-captain Virender Sehwag under pressure. 

With a strong-on-technique specialist opener in the squad, Sehwag has to tighten his own game. Jaffers selection, therefore, goes beyond merely filling in one of the berths. Hes definitely not the first choice opener, but wont be too far from Sehwags heels. 

The selectors, one learns, arent satisfied with Sehwags attitude. 

Despite initial reservations over rushing his comeback, the selectors recalled Anil Kumble. He hasnt played ODIs for well over a year, but Vengsarkar described him as an integral part of this team. Its no surprise that Ramesh Powar had to make way. 

Besides Pawar, Rudra Pratap Singh has been dropped. Rudra Pratap couldnt make the most of recent opportunities and his place has gone to Zaheer Khan, who was out of favour after the tour of Pakistan earlier this year. 

Its interesting that while the last committee, chaired by Kiran More, preferred Rudra Pratap to Sreesanth, the present one has shown faith in the latter. Sreesanth, who wasnt in the Champions Trophy 14, got a call-up after Ajit Agarkar fractured his left thumb last Thursday. 

Agarkars selection is provisional and he cant board the November 13 flight out of Mumbai unless he clears the November 10 fitness test. Thankfully, Agarkar has suffered a hairline fracture and, so, theres a chance he may be fit, informed Board secretary Niranjan Shah. 

If Agarkar isnt given the green signal, Vikram Rajvir Singh is going to be on that flight to Johannesburg. 

As Yuvraj Singh is out (he will be assessed afresh by Dr Anant Joshi in a fortnight), Dinesh Karthik has got a berth, as the second wicketkeeper. It wont surprise if he stays on for the three-Test series. 

Vengsarkar, by the way, was candid: Theres no exceptional talent around... There are players who perform at the first-class level, but theyre good at the level, not beyond... I didnt, for example, see anybody outstanding in the Challenger... 

Expect the chairman to keep talking straight. 

Footnote: The selectors, one learns, have asked Chappell to review the games played as part of the warm-up exercises. This is a fallout of Yuvrajs injury, while playing kho-kho. As a source put it: Let there be low-risk games... Why kho-kho on the eve of one of the most crucial matches? A review wont help Yuvraj, but...

Bangalore: S.Ganapathys Southern Empire looks a cinch in the Bangalore Juvenile Million, on Friday, the concluding day of the season.

 The Placerville-Stunning three-year-old gelding, who is yet to taste defeat, is one of the best horses of his age in the country. To be ridden by B.Prakash, Southern Empire will run at cramped odds.

Calcutta: With the fate of the one-day International series in Pakistan already decided, the focus on Sunday is as much on the final face-off in Karachi as it is on the U-19 World Cup final between the same contestants ? India and Pakistan ? in Colombo. 

Both India and Pakistan have stormed into the Super League final in scintillating fashion. India registered a big win against England where they skittled them out for just 59 after scoring 292 for four. Pakistan, on the other hand, crushed Australia by 163 runs. 

We are sort of eyeing a perfect finish to a quite a good show in the tournament, India coach Venkatesh Prasad told The Telegraph from Colombo on Saturday. 

We will go into the final with a positive frame of mind. The boys know this is a big occasion and they are gearing up for the challenge, he said, before taking his wards for an official dinner in Colombo. 

 Prasad, however, said he would decide on the final combination on Sunday morning. Its a day and night game. In both semi-finals, the teams batting first scored 250-plus. However, the toss is something which is not in our hands. But we are confident and are open to all sorts of ideas, he remarked. 

India openers Chesteswar Pujara and Gaurav Dhiman have been in outstanding form, having scored 349 and 222, respectively, so far in the tournament. 

Their show up the order hardly let the middle-order play any role. Prasad admitted, Its a challenge for the rest of the boys to rise to the occasion, if the openers fail in the final. 

Pakistan coach Mansoor Rana, on the other hand, believes the defeat to Bangladesh in the group stage played a key role in his sides transformation in the meet. 

May be that loss was a blessing in disguise, Rana said on the eve of the match. 

Pakistan are bidding to become the first side ever to win the under-19 World Cup twice in a row.

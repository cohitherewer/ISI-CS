 Kapil unsure of NCA role

New Delhi: The BCCIs claims of enhanced professionalism under the leadership of Sharad Pawar were exposed Thursday when Kapil Dev admitted he had no idea about his role as the new chairman of the National Cricket Academy. 

Kapil, who replaced Sunil Gavaskar at the recent AGM, said none of the BCCI officials had informed him of his responsibilities. 

I was told that I have been appointed NCA chairman, but I dont know what I am expected to do, the World Cup-winning captain said. 

The former allrounder said he was not fully aware of the NCAS duties. 

We will have to wait till the first meeting of the NCA members to decide what we will do, Kapil said. 

The NCA is responsible for grooming young talented cricketers with an aim to prepare them for the highest level of the game. 

Kapil, however, expressed happiness that he would get an opportunity to contribute to the game in his new capacity. It is good that I have been considered good enough to take this responsibility. 

I am a field man and not a commentator or writer like many other former players. I will try to do justice to my new role, he added. 

The other former players on the NCA board are Shivlal Yadav (director) and Lalchand Rajput (director-coaching).

 Inzy to be briefed on stance, exact words before hearing

 - THE OVAL FIASCO 

Karachi: Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq will be briefed by lawyers in London about the stance he has to adopt and the exact words to use at the two-day disciplinary hearing of the International Cricket Council on September 27 and 28. 

Inzamam along with local lawyer Mohammed Hussain has already reached London where he has been joined by Pakistan Cricket Board chief Shaharyar Khan and coach Bob Woolmer. 

All will have a meeting with the legal firm hired in London for this case. Inzamam, who faces the charges of violating the Code of Conduct, will be briefed on what to do at the hearing while Pakistans stance would also be finalised, a PCB official said. 

Inzamam has been charged for ball tampering and bringing the game into disrepute during the controversial fourth Test against England last month at The Oval. 

Another PCB source said Pakistan were confident the ball tampering charges would not hold at the hearing as the ICC did not have strong enough evidence to back up the allegations of its umpires. 

Our line of defence is going to be two-fold. We will be attacking the real reasons for Australian umpire Darrell Hair changing the ball and penalising the team five runs for alleged ball tampering. 

We will also highlight the fact that he failed to inform Inzamam at the time of changing the ball he was doing it on ball tampering charges. Thirdly, when he went to the Pakistan dressing room he again refused to say why he had changed the ball, the source said. 

The source said they had also prepared to counter the allegation of bringing the game into disrepute. 

The Pakistan team didnt return to the field after tea although the umpires Hair and Billy Doctrove went on the field. They returned after Hair visited the Pakistan dressing room and told them he would award the match to England if they did not resume play. 

The second time the umpires went on to the field with the England players and after waiting for a while took off the bails and awarded the game to the home side. 

However, another PCB source said the factors that could go against the Pakistan captain was that he was supposed to know all the rules and laws of the game and when the umpires changed the ball and penalised the team five runs. 

What goes against the Pakistan team is that the second time the umpires went out on the field with the England batsmen, everyone saw on television that wicketkeeper Kamran Akmal came out in the balcony and sat down reading a newspaper, the source said. 

Inzamam faces a maximum ban of eight one-day Internationals or four Tests if both the charges are upheld against him but a minimum ban could be for three to four games and a heavy fine. (PTI)

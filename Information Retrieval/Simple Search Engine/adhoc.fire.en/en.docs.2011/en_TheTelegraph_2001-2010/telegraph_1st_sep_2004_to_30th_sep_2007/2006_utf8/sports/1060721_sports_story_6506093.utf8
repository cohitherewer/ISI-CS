The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Nothing is more dear than cricket

 - Arjuna Ranatunga quits as Sri Lanka minister after campaign aimed at hurting his image 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Calcutta: Upset with a 

 campaign aimed at hurting his image, Sri Lankas solitary 

 World Cup-winning captain, Arjuna Ranatunga, has quit as 

 his countrys deputy minister for tourism. 

 I personally gave my resignation 

 to the President (Mahinda Rajapakse) last night? I dont 

 know whether it has been accepted, Ranatunga told 

 The Telegraph on Thursday evening. 

He confirmed having been at the receiving end of a campaign which more than suggested he wanted a slice of everything ? a seat in the government and Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC). 

I cant pinpoint who is behind it all, but Ive quit to silence those who feel I want a bit of everything? The President had suggested there could be a bit of an issue with my sitting at two places and, so, I put in my papers, Ranatunga said. 

He added: Nothing is more dear to me than cricket and, while I dont have the money to fight SLC elections, I do have the right to look forward to having a role in its running? Not just me, other ex-players as well. 

Ranatunga, it may be recalled, is one of the five nominated by former players to serve on the committee for administration, which was to have been constituted early this week. 

That the committee (with the ex-players on board) would run SLC was decided by President Rajapakse himself after he scrapped the elections scheduled for last Saturday. 

The committee is to be jointly chaired by sitting SLC president Jayanta Dharmadasa and Mohan de Silva, who was to challenge him. 

Should the committee be announced without Ranatunga, theres every chance that the other four former players (Sidath Wettimuny, Aravinda de Silva, Kapila Wijegunawardene and Pramodaya Wickramasinghe) could stay away. 

 Many, it seems, are intrigued at the role being played 

 by sports minister Jeevan Kumaranatunga.

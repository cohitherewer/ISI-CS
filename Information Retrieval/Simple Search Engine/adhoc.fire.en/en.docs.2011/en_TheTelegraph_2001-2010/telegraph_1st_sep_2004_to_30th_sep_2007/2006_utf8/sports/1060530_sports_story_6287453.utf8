 Chanderpaul in squad despite injury

 - FIRST TEST 

 - Sarwan, Colleymore make XIV 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Chanderpaul

Bridgetown: The West Indies selectors have named former captain Shivnarine Chanderpaul in the solid-looking XIV for the first Test, in Antigua from Friday, but he hasnt yet recovered from the hamstring injury sustained in the third ODI of the just-ended series, in St Kitts. 

Its still too early to say anything definitely? Chanderpaul continues to undergo treatment and we have time to make a call on his fitness, a West Indies Cricket Board spokesman told The Telegraph on Monday morning. 

The in-form Ramnaresh Sarwan and quick Corey Colleymore are also currently on the list of injured. Colleymore twisted his right ankle and couldnt bowl in the final ODI, on Sunday. As for Sarwan, he has a bruise on his right wrist, again sustained at the Queens Park Oval. 

Sarwan, though, is confident of a quick recovery. I should be fine soon, he remarked a short while after being adjudged the Man of the Series on Sunday. A speedy recovery is critical for the West Indies. 

 The squad includes Daren Ganga and keeper Denesh Ramdin, who was fielded in the final ODI despite not being in the original XIV for the two matches in Port-of-Spain. While some players reached Antigua on Monday itself, others (including Colleymore) have been given a day off and asked to report on Tuesday. 

 THE SQUAD 

Brian Lara (captain), Chris Gayle, Daren Ganga, Ramnaresh Sarwan, Shivnarine Chanderpaul, Marlon Samuels, Runako Morton, Dwayne Bravo, Denesh Ramdin, Ian Bradshaw, Jerome Taylor, Corey Colleymore, Fidel Edwards and Dave Mohammed.

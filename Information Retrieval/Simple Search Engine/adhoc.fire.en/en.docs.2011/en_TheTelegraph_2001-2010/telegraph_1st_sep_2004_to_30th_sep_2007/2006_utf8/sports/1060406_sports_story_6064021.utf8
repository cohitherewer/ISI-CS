London: AC Milan sneaked through to the Champions League semi-finals with two late strikes on Tuesday, but city rivals Inter were eliminated on the away goals rule. 

Six-time former European champions AC Milan were facing elimination before Filippo Inzaghi and Andriy Shevchenko netted in the last five minutes to give the Italians a dramatic 3-1 victory over Olympique Lyon following a goalless first leg in France. 

In Spain, Villarreal reached the last four in their debut season in Europes elite club competition when defender Rodolfo Arruabarrena headed the only goal in a 1-0 win over Inter, who had led 2-1 from the first leg of their quarter-final. 

Lyon were the better team for much of an eventful match at the San Siro but Milan took the lead against the run of play when Inzaghi headed in Clarence Seedorfs accurate cross after 25 minutes. 

Midfielder Mahamadou Diarra bravely headed Lyons equaliser six minutes later, the away goal putting them ahead in the tie. Lyon striker Fred also struck the post with a header before halftime with Milans defending uncharacteristically slack. 

The French league leaders, trying to reach the last four for the first time, were comfortable for most of the second half until Shevchenko rattled both posts with a low shot after 88 minutes and Inzaghi slammed in the rebound for his second of the game. 

Shevchenko then raced through to seal a flattering victory three minutes into stoppage time. The Ukraine strikers effort meant he overtook Real Madrids Raul as the competitions all-time leading scorer with 52 goals. 

We have the kind of quality in our attack that can pull something out for us even when things arent going so well, said a relieved Milan coach Carlo Ancelotti. 

Lyon manager Gerard Houllier said: It is extremely disappointing, we performed so well and were probably better than Milan. 

After a tight first half in Spain, Villarreal emerged the more threatening in the second half and after 58 minutes they scored the ties decisive goal. 

Outstanding Argentine playmaker Juan Riquelme curled in a free kick and compatriot Arruabarrena flicked it past Inter keeper Francesco Toldo. 

The game turned ugly soon after when another of Villarreals Argentines, Juan Pablo Sorin, was elbowed in the face by Inter defender Marco Materazzi off the ball.

 Hanumant still in ICU

Mumbai: Former Test cricketer Hanumant Singh, who was admitted to a hospital here on November 6, is still in the intensive care unit, hospital sources said Wednesday. 

Hes still in the ICU, but I cannot give any more details as the family members do not want it to be publicised, sources said. 

The 57-year-old Hanumant, who stormed the Test scene in the 1963-64 series against England with a century on debut in Delhi, is on ventilator support, according to another informed source. 

Hanumant played 14 Tests in an international career that ended before the turn of the 1970s and scored 686 runs. He, however, never scored a century after his 105 on debut.

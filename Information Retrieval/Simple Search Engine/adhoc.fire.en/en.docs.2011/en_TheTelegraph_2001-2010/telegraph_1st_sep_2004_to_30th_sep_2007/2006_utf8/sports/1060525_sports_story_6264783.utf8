 PCB unwilling to host series 

 ODIs vs Zimbabwe

 Karachi: Pakistan are having 

 reservations about hosting Zimbabwe for a one-day series 

 in September due a lack of financial incentive for the matches, 

 the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) said on Wednesday.

 I dont think that 

 is going to be possible as it is not feasible for us. We 

 are going to write to them to postpone their tour until 

 2008, PCB chairman Shaharyah Khan said.

 Khan added that after talks with 

 television rights holders and sponsors, the PCB felt it 

 would not be financially viable to host Zimbabwe for just 

 three one-day games this year.

 We are also due to host 

 West Indies after the Champions Trophy and the players want 

 a rest, Khan added.

 England toss away advantage

 - Irfan Pathan (3/52) inflicts late blows 

NILESH BHATTACHARYA

Nagpur: Elvis Presley tops the chart of Andrew Flintoffs musical preference. Years ago, the rock--roll legend wrote and sang: First time I dared to dream/My only dream came true/Must be beginners luck/To wish upon a star/That opened up my eyes/And there you are. 

So there he was ? Flintoff, as Englands 76th Test captain, accompanying Rahul Dravid in the middle and deciding to bat on winning the toss. 

The three-Test series for the TVS Cup began with Andrew Strauss and Alastair Cook out to put a brave face on the continuous saga of adversity hitting the camp. They were cautious and calculated to ensure that things didnt fall out of place on a dusty pitch at the VCA Stadium. 

If it was a whole new journey for Flintoff, the occasion became all the more poignant in that as many as three players ? Ian Blackwell, Madhusuden Monty Singh Panesar and Cook ? shared the English dressing room for the first time as members of playing XI in Tests. 

Strauss was the unflappable stoic and along with the good-looking Cook, put on 56 runs in the opening stand, forcing Dravid to seek Harbhajan Singhs help. 

Beginners luck? Flintoff must have thought so. But unfortunately it stayed with the new hot seat occupant for a brief moment and switched allegiance to another beginner ? Sreesanth. The Keralite quick, on Test debut, was undoubtedly the catalyst in changing the complexion of Day I. 

Through a blend of slower and fast in-deepers, he first negated Englands early initiatives and then started his teams journey to a position of strength in the first Test, further helped by Irfan Pathans late blows. 

At stumps on Day I, England were 246 for seven and Flintoff is now surely in a position to wish upon a star. 

It was exactly the place as well as even the end (Media Stand) from where Sreesanth set off on his international journey 126 days ago, in the first match of the six-ODI series against Sri Lanka. 

His nagging line must have disturbed Strauss concentration and he chased a wide delivery. V.V.S. Laxman at second slip rounded it off with a blinder. Fifty eight balls later, it was Dravids turn to do a Laxman, as Ian Bell could not read a straighter one from Harbhajan. 

Soon Sreesanth delivered another killer punch, making Kevin Pietersen pay for his mistake. He was not in a proper position to pull the bowler, yet he did, dragging the cherry on to his stumps. 

The dashing middle-order bat certainly didnt pay any heed to the danger that was Sreesanth. Laxman dropped him in the first ball of Sreesanths third spell. The very next nearly got him out, but Pietersen managed to get his bat in the way of a yorker. His flirting with danger was over in the penultimate ball of that eventful over. 

Cook, on the other hand, looked like the English answer to Sreesanths exuberance on proving a point on debut. 

Thrust straight into the frying pan from the A tour of the West Indies, the Essex opener looked composed. 

Never in a hurly-burly mood, Cook intended to score by the sweat of his brow. It was rather unfortunate that he had to go down to the best delivery of the day ? a typical reverse-swinging one from Pathan. 

Before that, his 60 (206 minutes, 160 balls, 4x7) never for a moment made England realise the absence of Marcus Trescothick. Flintoff came and set the stage ablaze in his own fashion. With Paul Collingwood, he produced Englands most prolific stand so far ? 67 runs. 

He was distinctly unlucky when the South African umpire Ian Howell nodded in agreement with Anil Kumbles leg-before appeal. The ball was 72-over-old and it was the time when Pathan in particular and Sreesanth in general, were making the cherry talk with a good mixture of reverse swing and slower ones. 

Dravidly rightly refrained from taking the new ball when it was due and Pathan prised open the England lower-order in quick succession. 

First to go was wicketkeeper Geraint Jones, trapped in front off Pathan. Blackwell disappointed, falling to a delivery which kept low and sneaked in through an under-edge cut. 

With England tail to be exposed from the first delivery of the second day, Collingwood (batting on 53) now stands like the only threat to Team Indias ambitions.

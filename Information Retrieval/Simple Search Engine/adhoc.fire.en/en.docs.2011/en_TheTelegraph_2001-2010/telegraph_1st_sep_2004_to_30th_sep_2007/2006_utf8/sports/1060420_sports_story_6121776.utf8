The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Change in plans after washout

 Fed Cup

 New Delhi: Ankita Bhambri 

 and Isha Lakhani will play the singles matches of the opening 

 tie against Philippines on Thursday after India decided 

 to preserve its top guns Sania Mirza and Shikha Uberoi in 

 the Fed Cup Asia-Oceania Zonal qualifiers in Seoul.

 Captain and coach Enrico Piperno 

 said he was forced to change the nominations since he wanted 

 Sania and Shikha to be at their best against the tougher 

 Chinese Taipei whom India take on later in the day.

 I did not want to risk my 

 best players. Sania is coming back from an injury and I 

 did not want to place too much load on her, Piperno 

 said on Wednesday.

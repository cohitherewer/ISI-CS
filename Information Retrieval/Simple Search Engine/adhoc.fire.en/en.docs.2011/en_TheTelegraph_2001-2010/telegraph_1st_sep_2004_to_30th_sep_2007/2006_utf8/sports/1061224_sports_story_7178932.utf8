 Flintoff to play despite injury

Sydney: England captain Andrew Flintoff will battle through painful ankle problems to play in the last two Ashes Tests. Flintoff did not bowl in the nets on Friday but said he was confident about the next match starting in Melbourne on Tuesday. 

The ankle feels good. Obviously, we netted on Friday and I didnt bowl, I will probably bowl Sunday, Flintoff said in Melbourne on Saturday. 

Theres no secret, Ive had some discomfort in it over the past week. Im not envisaging any long-term problems or worried about these next two Test matches. 

Flintoff said his team was very keen to put on a good performance in Melbourne after the disappointment of losing the first three Tests and the Ashes. 

Theres been a few things happening in the world of cricket over the past week, but it cant affect our preparations, he added, referring to Australians Shane Warne and Glenn McGrath announcing their retirements.

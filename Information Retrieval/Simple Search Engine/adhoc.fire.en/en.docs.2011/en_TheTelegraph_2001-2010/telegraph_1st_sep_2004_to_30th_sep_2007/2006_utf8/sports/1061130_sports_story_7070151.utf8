 Arjun Atwal to take part

 - PGA Tour Qualifier

La Quinta (US): Arjun Atwal will tee off at the PGA Tour qualifying tournament, attempting to get into the full Tour as he fights for one of the 30 full exemptions to the 2007 season. 

The Indian has been paired with Bubba Dickerson and John Riegger for the first round. This year, Atwal competed in 33 events, has just one top-10 and six top-25 finishes and made the cut only in 15 events to finish 140th in the money list. 

Atwal still has conditional status on the PGA Tour that guarantees approximately 15 starts in the new season, but he will be hoping to gain full exemption with a top finish in the final here. (PTI)

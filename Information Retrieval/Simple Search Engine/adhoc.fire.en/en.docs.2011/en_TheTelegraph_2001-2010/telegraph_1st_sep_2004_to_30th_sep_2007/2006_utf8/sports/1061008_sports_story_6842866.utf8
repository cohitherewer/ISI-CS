 Chowrasia, Maan way behind

Taipei: Gurbaaz Mann and S.S.P. Chowrasia, two Indians to make the cut at the $300,000 Taiwan Open on Friday, were lying low after the completion of the third round. 

Gurbaaz shot an even par 72 and was tied-44th while Chowrasia, still stung by last weeks disqualification, shot a 76 and was tied-61st at five-over for 54 holes. 

Home challenge Lin Wen-tang sensationally eagled his last hole to grab a two-shot lead after the third round. The in-form Lin holed a chip from off the green at the par five 18th to sign for a four-under-par 68 at Sunrise Golf and Country Club, putting himself in position to win his maiden Asian Tour title.

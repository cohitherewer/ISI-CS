 Kumble says Tests will be different

 - Seeking inspiration from 2003-04 Australia tour 

Johannesburg: The beleaguered Indian team was trying to draw inspiration from their Australian odyssey of 2003-04 before the daunting Test series against South Africa, leg-spinner Anil Kumble said Tuesday. 

We have the example of our tour to Australia where we won a Test and came close to doing it in the last Test, and one of the main reasons why we did it was because we put runs on the board, and that too quickly enough for bowlers to have enough time to get 20 wickets, said a characteristically composed Kumble. 

One of the reasons for Indias success in Australia was the opening stand where invariably the openers came good in direct contrast to whats been happening on this tour when the Virender Sehwag-Wasim Jaffer combination has been coming a cropper in every innings. 

It was one-day cricket (where we failed), but Test matches are going to be a completely different affair. We have an experienced set, remarked the Bangalore-based player. 

Kumble also compared the teams current situation to which it found itself in the Caribbean earlier this year when they bounced back from a one-day series loss to win the Test rubber. 

We did so in the West Indies where we lost the one-day series, but then came back to win the Test series. Similarly it was in Pakistan where we lost the first one-dayer, but then came back to win the series. And then, there was Australia, the 35-year old said. 

It is more or less the same set of players, so there is no reason why they cant come good. 

Kumble, who first made an impression in South Africa way back in 1991-92, has happy personal memories of the country though he is also aware that most of the teams who visit this place, but for Australia, dont go back as winners. 

Its because they use their conditions very well and bowlers are good at putting balls in the right areas, he said. 

Kumble, ever a positive man, hoped that his team would be able to write a new script in the Test series, starting here from Friday. It is the same as in Australia where teams find it difficult to win matches but we did well there so I am hopeful. At some point of time, you have to turn things around. 

Kumble had a nonchalant reaction when informed that South African batsmen want to take him, and Harbhajan Singh, on during the test series. If they are going to be aggressive, its good. Its a challenge but as a bowler you also have more opportunities, Kumble said.

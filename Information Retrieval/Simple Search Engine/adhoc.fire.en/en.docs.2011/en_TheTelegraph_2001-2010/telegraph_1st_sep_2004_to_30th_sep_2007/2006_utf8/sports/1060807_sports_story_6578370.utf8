 Team India reassemble

Bangalore: After a brush with commando-style fitness training, the Indian cricketers reassembled here on Sunday for a skills-specific camp to prepare for the tri-series in Sri Lanka beginning on August 14. 

The players, with the exception of Irfan Pathan, trickled in batches for the four-day camp starting on Monday at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium. 

Pathan, who had given himself two days of extra practice ahead of the first camp, arrived on Saturday and had a shy at skipper Rahul Dravid in the nets with bio-mechanist Ian Frazer and trainer Gregory Allan King keeping a close watch. 

Apart from the 15 Colombo-bound players, pacer Lakshmipathy Balaji and left-arm spinner Murali Kartik are also here to continue their rehabilitation following injuries. (PTI)

 I was forced to play in U-18 category: Harika

New Delhi: Newly crowned world girls under-18 champion Dronavalli Harika was perhaps destined to win the title as she overcame a organisational goof-up and faced quality competition on her way to glory. 

I was supposed to be the top-seed in the under-16 category but when I reached there I was forced to play in the under-18 division, Harika, who arrived here last night, said. 

It was an official error because they had interchanged my name with another girl Uttara who had applied for the U-18, she said on her triumph in Batumi, Georgia, last week. 

Harika got the better of Iranian girl Atousha Pourkashiyan with black pieces in a long battle of 65 moves in the final round to clinch the title. 

Harika, who lost the lead after the eighth round of the 11-round competition, said her game against Atousha went down to the wire. 

We were both in contention till the last move. I was really jumping over there after winning the title. It was quite tough for me to get there, the 15-year-old said. 

However, the Guntur girl, having represented the country in Olympiad, denied that she was anxious after being pushed to second spot with three rounds to spare. 

I was confident I will make up for the loss in the remaining rounds. 

The 45 Elo points she won would boost her efforts to bag the International Master title, for which she already has the required norms but is short of the necessary 2400 rating points. 

I have earned a few points of late and in January list I should be able to claim the (IM) title, said Harika, who has at present an Elo rating of 2353. 

Harika, who idolises Judit Polgar of Hungary, said with increase in competition, it was important for her to stay ahead of the rest of the pack. In fact, Harika preferred chess over academics and has to repeat her exams in standard 10th this year. (PTI)

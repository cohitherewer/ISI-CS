 Ballack transfer

London: Chelsea are set to complete the free transfer of Bayern Munich and Germany midfielder Michael Ballack this weekend and will hold a news conference with the player on Monday. 

The Premier League champions, however, gave no details of any contract. 

He was first linked with a move to Chelsea in February but denied British newspaper reports that he had signed a four-year deal with the club worth ?25 million ($43 million). 

Frustrated by jeering and whistling from Bayern fans, the 29-year-old said last Friday: 

I think my decision should be accepted and I shouldnt be kicked around any more about it. 

After another poor reception at the start of Saturdays 3-3 home draw with Borussia Dortmund, he said: The fans are sensitive to what is said. But I always tried hard to do my job and that should be honoured. 

I was not able to take a decision sooner and couldnt force a decision just because Bayern managers demanded one. There are a lot of others at Bayern who dont know whether they have a future here or not.

 NZ aim to turn heat on Pakistan

 - Adversity binds team together, says Woolmer 

 Mohali: Stephen Flemings record 194th limited-overs International as captain shapes as a must-win match for his New Zealand line-up against Pakistan. New Zealand go into the crucial Champions Trophy Group B contest at 1-1, aware that only a win will keep them in the race for semi-final qualification. 

Pakistan can afford a loss at 1-0, after upsetting Sri Lanka by four wickets the day after pace spearheads Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Asif were sent home for failing doping tests. 

Fleming said he would be focussing on Pakistans weaknesses on Wednesday. Weve always respected the natural ability of Pakistans cricketers, he said. But they tend to be a bit inconsistent depending on the pressure you put on them, and thats just what were hoping to do tomorrow. Theres a lot of pressure for tomorrows game, well have to bowl extremely well to their line-up, he said. 

 Pakistans victory over Sri Lanka underscored their ability to rise from adversity. A lot of teams in international sport thrive in adversity, it binds the team together, said Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer. We cant keep worrying about those players we dont have. We have to do with those in the team, he said. 

My focus will be to make sure there is no panic in my team, said Pakistan captain Younis Khan. We dont want to leave it to other teams (to help us qualify).

Paris: Sania Mirza got a tough draw on Thursday for the French Open starting at Roland Garros on Sunday. The Indian No. 1 will come up against 2004 champion and world No. 12 Anastasia Myskina in the first round of womens singles. 

Sania would have avoided a top player in the early rounds had she been in the worlds top-32. But she missed out on a seeding spot as she is No. 38. 

World No. 1 Amelie Mauresmo should not be bothered until the quarter finals when she faces a possible match-up against 11th seed Venus Williams. 

Mauresmo, who has been an under-achiever on home clay, will start off against American Meghann Shaughnessy. Belgian Justine Henin-Hardenne, the defending champion seeded fifth this year, will take on Estonian Maret Ani in the first round. 

Henin faces a likely fourth-round match against Myskina followed by a possible quarter-final against another Russian, third seed Nadia Petrova, who has won her last three claycourt tournaments. 

In the semis, she could play compatriot Kim Clijsters if the 2003 finalist survives a possible match-up against either Russian Elena Dementieva or Swiss Martina Hingis. 

Former world No. 1 Hingis has not played at Roland Garros since a 4-6, 3-6 defeat in the 2001 semi-final against Jennifer Capriati. She is seeded 12th this year and starts against American Lisa Raymond. 

Mary Pierce pulled out because she has not recovered from a foot injury. 

Mens defending champion Rafael Nadal was handed a relatively easy draw but world No. 1 Roger Federer faces a tough second week. 

Spains Nadal, seeded second, will face Swede Robin Soderling in the first round with a likely fourth-round clash against 14th seed Lleyton Hewitt, who is suffering from a foot injury. 

Federer will face a lucky loser after Frenchman Arnaud Clement pulled out on Friday because of a groin injury. 

 Rohan, Shikha fail 

Indians Rohan Bopanna and Shikha Uberoi failed to qualify for the main draw. Bopanna went down 4-6, 6-7 (0-7) to Michael Lammer in the first round of the qualifiers. Uberoi defeated Argentine Maria Jose Argeri 2-6, 6-2, 6-1 before going down 5-7, 2-6 to Galina Voskoboeva.

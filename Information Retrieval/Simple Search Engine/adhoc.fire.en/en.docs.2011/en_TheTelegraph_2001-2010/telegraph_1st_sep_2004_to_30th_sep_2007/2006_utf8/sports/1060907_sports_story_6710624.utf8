 Ramit into Round 3

 - NATIONAL SQUASH 

 Ramit Tandon nothed up two creditable wins 

New Delhi: Teenage sensation Ramit Tandon stormed into the third round of the National Squash Championships here on Wednesday. 

The 14-year-old Tandon, Indias No. 1 junior player, made light of the huge difference in age and physique to first knock-out local lad Prateek Chalia 9-3, 10-8, 9-2 and then overcome Harjinder Singh 9-6, 10-8, 9-2. 

 My idea was to keep them back and when the opportunity comes, to finish the stroke, said Tandon, who has five national titles in the under-11, under-13 and under-15 age categories. 

Tandon showed good court sense as he worked the angles perfectly to catch his opponents off guard repeatedly. Often, he erased deficits by winning five or more points at a stretch. 

This is only the second time he is playing in the senior nationals, and the first time he played three years ago, he went out in the first round.

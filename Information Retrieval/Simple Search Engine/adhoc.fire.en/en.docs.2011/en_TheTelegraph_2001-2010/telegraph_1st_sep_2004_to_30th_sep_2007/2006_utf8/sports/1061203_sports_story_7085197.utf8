 Unbeaten 142 by Ravneet

Resuming at 25 for no loss, the hosts had little problem in overhauling Gujarats total of 208 and were 321 for two in reply at close. 

Ricky was batting at 142, which came with 12 hits to the fence and one six along with Gaurav Gupta (32). The two have added 73 runs for the unbroken third wicket.

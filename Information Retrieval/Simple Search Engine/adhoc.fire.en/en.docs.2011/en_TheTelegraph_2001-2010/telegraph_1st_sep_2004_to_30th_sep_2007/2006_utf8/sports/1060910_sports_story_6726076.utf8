 Well work on batting combinations

 - Team cause more important than personal goals: Dravid 

 Rahul Dravid and Greg Chappell watch a practice match in Chennai on Saturday 

Chennai: India will utilise next weeks tri-series in Kuala Lumpur to work out various batting combinations depending on the wickets and conditions available for the matches, captain Rahul Dravid said Saturday. The idea is to work on our strategies and maximise the 50 overs, Dravid said prior to the teams departure for the Malaysian capital. 

It all depends on the conditions and situation. If the need arises, we will consider all options available to us. The important aspect is that we have to play well and are focussed on achieving it and then the results will take care of other things, he said. 

Dravid also said that conditions on the match day would determine the opening combination for the tri-series which also include world champions Australia and Champions Trophy winners West Indies. 

Dravid and Sachin Tendulkar had opened during the washed out tri-series in Sri Lanka last month and the captain said the pairing could continue in Malaysia. 

Asked whether Sachin would also be used as a bowler, Dravid said: He (Sachin) has bowled pretty well at the nets in Bangalore. We definitely want him to bowl in the near future. We will take it step by step and keep assessing. We do not want to rush, if he is not comfortable, Dravid said. 

However, coach Greg Chappell said he had no concerns about the master batsmans fitness. He said he was not overly concerned about Australia. I will focus on what we need to do and plan accordingly. I am only concerned about how we play and win, he added. 

Dravid said he set personal goals as a player, but was more concerned about the team cause. At this stage, the goal is to do well against the two teams that we take on in Malaysia, he said. 

Meanwhile, Sachin Tendulkars superb 83-ball century and Mahendra Singh Dhonis unbeaten 88 off 56 balls went in vain as India A suffered a three-wicket loss to India B in their second and last practice match on Saturday. (PTI)

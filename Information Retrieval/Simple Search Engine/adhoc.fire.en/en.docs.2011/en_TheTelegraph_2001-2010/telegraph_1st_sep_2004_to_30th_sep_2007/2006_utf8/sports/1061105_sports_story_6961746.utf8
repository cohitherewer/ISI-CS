Mumbai: After all the mud-slinging of recent weeks, it was time for gestures. 

First, International Cricket Council (ICC) president Percy Sonn declared that the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) was a loyal member of the world body. An hour or so after that, on Saturday evening, he held Sharad Pawars hand as he admired the swanky new HQ of the BCCI. 

The BCCI chief, of course, went out of his way to make Sonn comfortable. In fact, Pawar had spent a good 15 minutes waiting for the ICC president to turn up. Has he left the CCI or not? Is he caught in a traffic jam? he asked aides as a security personnel handed some tissue to wipe the sweat. 

Mumbais famed humidity, after all. 

While waiting for Sonn, Pawar briefly spoke to The Telegraph. Both the BCCI and the Mumbai Cricket Association have 20,000 square feet each... If needed, the BCCI can get 10,000 more... Its a big change from the 1,800 square feet it had at the Brabourne Stadium... This is a start... 

Housed within the Wankhede Stadium premises, the new HQ is in a handsome four-storey structure. 

The inauguration, which was attended among others by members of the ICCs Executive Board, was followed by the honouring of 15 Indian captains and the presentation of the C.K.Nayudu (lifetime achievement) Award to our legendary spin quartet. 

Mohammed Azharuddin, who is serving a life ban for match-fixing, was one of the captains honoured. It appeared he was very conscious that the ICC brass had, initially, made an issue of his being invited. 

Incidentally, three generations of Pataudis turned up: Mansur Ali Khan, son Saif and grandson Ibrahim.

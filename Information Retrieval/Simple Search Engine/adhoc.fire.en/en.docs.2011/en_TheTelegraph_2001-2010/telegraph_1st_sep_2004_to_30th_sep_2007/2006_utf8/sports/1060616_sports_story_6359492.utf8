 Bhat bows out after beating world No. 6

New Delhi: Arvind Bhats irresistible form eluded him against Roman Spitko of Germany as the Indian lost in straight games in a pre-quarter final tie to bow out of the four-star Malaysian Open Badminton tournament in Kuching on Thursday night. 

Bhat, who caused a major upset earlier on Thursday, toppling world No. 6 Kenneth Jonassen of Denmark, went down 14-21, 17-21 to the German, according to information received here. 

World No. 61 Bhat played a fiercely attacking game to account for Jonassen, thrashing the fifth seed 21-16, 23-21 to set up a clash with Spitko. 

Saina Nehwal was on way to an upset over world No. 7 Jie Yao of The Netherlands but lost the first-round duel 9-21, 21-19, 21-11. (PTI)

 Rougier dropped 

Port-of-Spain: Trinidad and Tobago coach Leo Beenhakker has unveiled his final squad of 23 for the World Cup, axing utility player Anthony Rougier from his preliminary line-up named last month. 

Rougier agonisingly missed out on being part of the Soca Warriors maiden World Cup campaign, despite impressing veteran coach Beenhakker since first being picked for the squad in January. 

The guy worked fantasically and he did everything he had to do to try and make it and in the end I had to make a decision, said Beenhakker, who coached The Netherlands at the 1990 World Cup. 

 Trinidad and Tobago open their campaign against Sweden 

 in Dortmund on June 10, before playing England and Paraguay 

 in their remaining group B fixtures. 

 The Squad

 Goalkeepers: Kelvn Jack, Shaka Hislop, Clayton Ince; 

 Defenders: Dennis Lawrence, Cyd Gray, Marvin Andrews, 

 Brent Sancho, Ian Cox, Atiba Charles, Avery John;

 Whitley, Anthony Wolfe, Densill Theobald, Carlos Edward, 

 Dwight Yorke, Russell Latapy;

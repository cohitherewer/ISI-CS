The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Paes unlucky 

 not to be on shortlist

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Most Valiable Sportsperson

 Doha: His off-court controversy 

 with Mahesh Bhupathi notwithstanding, Leander Paes on Wednesday 

 night emerged as Indias most successful sportsperson 

 vis--vis the Asian Games.

 So overwhelmed was the Games organising 

 committee by Paes deeds that they declared him as 

 the athlete of the day. Jaspal Rana is the only other Indian 

 to have earned this in Doha. 

 With seven medals under his belt, 

 including five golds (not four as was reported in Thursdays 

 edition). P.T. Usha, Jaspal Rana and Milkha Singh have four 

 Asian Games gold medals each in their kitty.

 Paes golden journey began 

 at the 1994 Hiroshima Games (mens doubles and team 

 event). Four years ago in Busan, Paes struck gold with Bhupathi. 

 And now two more to complete the tally.

 Paes was such a dominating performer 

 in Doha, one felt the organisers jumped the gun by declaring 

 the names of nominees for the Most Valuable Sportsperson 

 three days ago.

 The list of seven nominees consist 

 of four Chinese (swimmers Jiaying Pang, Yanwei Xu, artistic 

 gymnast Wei Yang and shooter Luan Tao), one South Korean 

 (swimmer Tae Hwan Park), one Japanese (swimmer Kosuke Kitajima) 

 and Indian shooter Jaspal Rana.

 All these seven athletes won three 

 or more gold medals in Doha. Though Paes managed two, those 

 came in a span of three hours on Wednesday. May be an exception 

 could have been made while finalising the nominees 

 list.

 Asked if he was tired, Paes laughed: 

 Tired? No man, for India I could have played five 

 more matches. Very few would have disbelieved him. 

 His commitment and patriotism is beyond doubt.

 Paes and Bhupathi came back from 

 the brink of defeat and saved seven match-points to snatch 

 the gold. Paes was gracious to admit that the Thailand duo 

 could have won the match.

 I must congratulate the 

 Thais. They threw everything at us, including the kitchen 

 sink. They were unlucky not to win in straight sets. But 

 once we won the second set, I knew we were going to take 

 gold, Paes said.

 After losing the womens 

 singles final, the 20-year-old Sania Mirza said she was 

 tired of playing continuous tennis in the Asian Games.

 A couple of hours later, her 33-year-old 

 captain said: I am just relieved. Its been a 

 really long week, and to come up with this win is just great. 

 I must say we have worked hard all week. We have done a 

 lot of practice and you can see that we have come up with 

 wins.

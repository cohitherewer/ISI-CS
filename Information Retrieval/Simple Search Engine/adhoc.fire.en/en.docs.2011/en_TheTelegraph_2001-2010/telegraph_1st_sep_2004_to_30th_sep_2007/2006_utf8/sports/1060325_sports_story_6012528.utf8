 Jepkosgei beats Mutola to gold

 Melbourne: Half the Sierra Leone team disappeared from the Commonwealth Games on Friday and two Indian weightlifters failed doping tests. 

Police said another four athletes from war-ravaged Sierra Leone had fled the Games village in suburban Melbourne, bringing the number of missing athletes from the African country to 11. 

Australian police began searching for missing athletes after the government issued a warning to competitors seeking asylum. 

Almost everything Australia touched turned to gold on the playing fields as the host nation extended their massive lead in the medal standings. 

England had a miserable day, failing to win a single gold after their crack sprint team messed up in the relay heats and their mens hockey team conceded a golden goal in extra time to lose a semi-final to Pakistan. 

This just isnt our championships, Im gutted, English sprinter Mark Lewis-Francis said. 

Australia won golds in athletics, diving, basketball and bowls to raise their total to 72 after nine of the 11 days of competition. 

England remained in second place on 24 with Canada joining India in third place on 20 followed by South Africa (11), Scotland (10), Jamaica (8) and Kenya (6). 

A Tanzanian boxer and a Bangladeshi runner were reported missing earlier in the week. 

Australia won the mens basketball final against New Zealand, a synchronised diving title and another bowls victory, but their greatest success was in track and field. 

Nathan Deakes started the gold rush when he lapped the entire field to win the 50km walk in the morning then Steve Hooker (pole vault), Stuart Rendell (hammer throw) and Bronwyn Thompson (long jump) joined in as the strains of Advance Australia Fair rang out over the Melbourne Cricket Ground. 

The graceful Kenyans won three golds on the track. 

Olympic champion Ezekiel Kemboi Yano led a sweep of the medals in the mens 3,000m steeplechase, Janeth Jepkosgei upset Mozambiques Maria Mutola to win the womens 800m and Isabella Ochichi survived a last-lap charge from Englands Jo Pavey to win the womens 5000m.

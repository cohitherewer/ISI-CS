 Indians up against it

Karachi: Pakistan batted themselves to an invincible position and left India with an uphill task of saving the series-deciding third Test here Tuesday. 

After two days of see-saw battle, the hosts relied on young Faisal Iqbals maiden Test ton and a solid display from other top-order batsmen to not only take the game away from India but open up a mammoth overall lead of 518 by close on the third day. 

Iqbal was unbeaten on 103 as Pakistan reached 511 for five at stumps on a day which saw runs coming more easily with the track at the National Stadium having eased out considerably. With two full days of play left, the Indians will have to bat out of their skins in the second innings to prevent the home team from clinching the three-match series 1-0. 

The pressure will be on the visitors as no team in the history of the game has ever successfully chased a target of over 425 runs so far. Indias most successful chase has been 403 against the West Indies in Port of Spain during the 1971 series when they replied with 406 for four. 

A lot will also depend on how the track behaves in the last two days as any wear and tear would again offer assistance to the bowlers. 

Resuming at the overnight total of 174 for two after taking a slender seven-run first innings lead, Pakistan quickly swung the game in their favour with notable contributions from Mohammed Yousuf (97), stand-in captain Younis Khan (77) and Shahid Afridi (60). Abdul Razzaq was also looking good for a big score, batting on 44 at close. 

In fact, all the top six batsmen crossed 50 in the Pakistan second innings, an indication to how easy the wicket played as well as how innocuous the Indian attack has been on this tour. Everything went Pakistans way right through barring a 40-minute period soon after lunch when Anil Kumble struck two important blows to deny centuries to Younis and Yousuf after the hosts began at their overnight 173 for two. 

Yousuf departed at 318, but the mountain of runs continued to pile up against the tourists. Iqbals knock of 103 came in 191 balls (252 minutes, 12 fours) while Afridis cameo 46-ball knock contained nine fours and a six. Razzaq too joined the run-feast, hitting two fours and an equal number of sixes in his 92-ball unbeaten knock. 

He also put on 109 runs for the unbroken sixth wicket with Iqbal who reached his first Test century with a pulled four in the last over of the day. 

History is firmly against India clinching their second successive Test series triumph on Pakistan soil as the highest-ever run-chase at this venue goes back to 1994 when Pakistan won by one wicket against australia after being asked to score 315.

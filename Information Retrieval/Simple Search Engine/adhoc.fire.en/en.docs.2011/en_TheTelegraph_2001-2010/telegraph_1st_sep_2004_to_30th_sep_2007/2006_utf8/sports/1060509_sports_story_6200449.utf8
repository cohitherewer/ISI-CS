 Jeev Milkha consolidates top position 

Kuala Lumpur: Jeev Milkha Singhs tied second finish in Korea has strengthened his position atop the Asian Order of Merit, raising his seasons tally to $ 442,526. 

The recently-crowned China Open champion is $ 112,768 ahead of second-placed Charlie Wi of Korea, who finished at tied 27th at the SK Telecom Open. 

The Asian Tour now heads to India for the first time this season for the inaugural $400,000 Amby Valley Asian Masters, starting near Mumbai on Thursday. 

Asia also rolled out the red carpet for Michelle Wie, but at the end of a magical week, a new star was born in the shape of Thai Prom Meesawat. 

The 21-year-old Prom realised his potential with a career breakthrough triumph on Sunday, winning the weather-shortened $ 600,000 SK Telecom Open in Korea with a winning score of 15-under-par 201. 

Prom picked up a cheque of $ 127,523, and jumped to sixth place on the Order of Merit with $ 206,192, surpassing his total earnings from two previous seasons. 

Jeev has been having a terrific run since the last few weeks as he ended a long title-drought to win the China Open last month and was tied second in Korea. 

 I am happy that I am playing well enough to 

 be in contention more often, Jeev had said after the 

 SK Telecom Open. Jeev now has four top-10 finishes in his 

 last five starts. He will return to the Japan Tour for the 

 Japan PGA Championships.

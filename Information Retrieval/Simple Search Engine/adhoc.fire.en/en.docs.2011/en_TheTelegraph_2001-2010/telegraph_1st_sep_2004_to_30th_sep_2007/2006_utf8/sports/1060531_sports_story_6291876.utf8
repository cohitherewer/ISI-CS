 Boje is innocent: Bacher

 Ali Bacher 

Mumbai: Dr Ali Bacher firmly believes that Nicky Boje, alleged to have been involved in the match-fixing scandal, is innocent. 

The former United Cricket Board of South Africa supremo also said the scandal that was the biggest crisis to have affected the game in its long history and was happy the game had come out of it. 

Bacher, who is in India as consultant for South Africa-based electronics display firm Stellavista, also came out in support of having a players representative in cricket administration. Asked specifically about Herschelle Gibbs, who served out a one-year ban for match-fixing related activities, and Boje, Bacher said the latter had no part in the scandal. 

Nicky Boje was innocent. I know that for a fact, said Bacher. 

There is still a question mark for the Champions Trophy in October-November. 

Bacher said he favoured a representative of the players on the cricket boards as it were the players who got the game going and not the administrators and their problems and concerns needed to be listed to with utmost respect.

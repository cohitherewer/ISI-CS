 BCCI invites Azhar, Dalmiya 

 - INAUGURATION OF HEADQUARTERS 

A STAFF REPORTER AND AGENCIES

 Dalmiya and Azharuddin 

Calcutta/Mumbai: Former president Jagmohan Dalmiya, who has been served a showcause notice for alleged misappropriation of the 1996 World Cup accounts, has been invited by the BCCI to attend a function to mark the inauguration of its new headquarters in Mumbai on November 4. 

The list of invitees also includes former captain Mohammed Azharuddin, who has been banned for life for his alleged role in the match-fixing scandal. 

Yes, invitations have been sent to all the past captains of India and the past BCCI presidents, including Azhar and Dalmiya, two days ago, secretary Niranjan Shah said. The decision to send the invitations were taken at the office bearers meeting of the BCCI. 

This honour will be for Azhars contribution to Indian cricket. The BCCI doesnt see anything wrong with it, Shah said. 

The BCCI has so far refused to allow Azhar a post-retirement pension that is paid to all former players. 

Dalmiya wasnt available for comment, but given his current relationship with the BCCI office-bearers, it will be surprising if he attends the function. 

The BCCIs headquarters, for long confined to a small and crowded place in the north stand of Cricket Club of Indias Brabourne Stadium, will now be shifted to the Mumbai Cricket Associations Wankhede Stadium. 

The new headquarters will be more modern and spacious and will also house a cricket museum. The BCCI has already formed a committee to look into it. The function will be held one day after the ICC awards ceremony and a day before the final of the ICC Champions Trophy.

 Bhupathi, Malisse falter at first hurdle

New York: Mahesh Bhupathi and Xavier Malisse of Belgium were ousted by Leos Friedly and Mikhail Youzhny in the opening round of the US Open doubles on Wednesday. 

Bhupathi and Malisse were tamed 4-6, 4-6 by the Czech-Russian duo in and hour and 37 minutes. 

Repeated faulty serves by the Indian and his Belgian partner gave an edge to their opponents. They managed to convert most of their break points but missed when it mattered most and eventually bowed out. 

Bhupathi will now launch his campaign in the mixed doubles with Paola Suarez of Argentina. The duo is pitted against Anastassia Rodionova of Russia and Kevin Ulyett of Zimbabwe. 

Sixth seeds Leander Paes and Martin Damm of Czech Republic will face Czech duo Petr Pala and Robin Vik in their doubles opener on Friday. In the mixed doubles, he is paired with Samantha Stosur and seeded third. 

 Sania Mirza and Liezel Huber of South Africa are seeded 

 11th and will take on American pair of Angela Haynes and 

 Neha Uberoi in the womens doubles first round. Sania 

 will team up with Pavel Vizner of Czech Republic in the 

 mixed doubles. (PTI)

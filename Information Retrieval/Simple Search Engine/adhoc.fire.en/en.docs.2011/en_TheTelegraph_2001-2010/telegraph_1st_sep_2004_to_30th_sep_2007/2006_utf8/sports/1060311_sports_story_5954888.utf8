 Sarwan, Bravo prop up WI

Auckland: The West Indies recovered from an early batting collapse to regain the initiative on the second day of the opening Test against New Zealand on Friday. 

The tourists were in all sorts of trouble when they slumped to 90 for five before lunch at Eden Park, still 185 runs behind New Zealands first-innings total of 275. 

But half-centuries from Ramnaresh Sarwan (62) and allrounder Dwayne Bravo (59) helped them reach 257 and finish just 18 runs in arrears. 

Captain Stephen Fleming was unbeaten on 19 and nightwatchman James Franklin was on three with New Zealand clinging to a 116-run lead with just six wickets in hand.

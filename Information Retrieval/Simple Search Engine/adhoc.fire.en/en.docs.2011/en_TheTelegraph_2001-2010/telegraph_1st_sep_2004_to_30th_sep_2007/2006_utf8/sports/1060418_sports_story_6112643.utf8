Abu Dhabi: Rahul Dravid Monday said taking on arch-rivals Pakistan in back-to-back matches at the fag end of a season would be a tough task, but a loss would not take away the sheen off what the Indians have achieved already this year. 

Two performances cannot take away anything, it is peoples perception. Our performance still stands even if we lose these two games, we have made good strides in this past season, Dravid said on the eve of the first one-dayer. 

India have not lost a one-day series involving two teams this season ? winning against Sri Lanka (6-1), Pakistan (4-1) and England (5-1), and drawing against South Africa (2-2) ? and have a 17-5 win-loss record going into the competition.The captain expected the matches, played to raise funds for last years Kashmir earthquake victims, to be as close as during Indias visit to Pakistan two months ago. 

It is a one-day competition at a new venue. We start afresh. The series that we won in Pakistan were all very close matches. We expect similarly close games here, he said. 

Dravid said the players have to keep in mind the larger picture of playing for charity to lift themselves up for the two matches on the trot. It is going to be a challenge, it is not going to be easy. We hope that the momentum that we have built will take care of these two matches as well. 

Dravid said it has been one of the toughest seasons of his career. 

Yes it has been probably the toughest? I have been playing since July, I also played the World Series when the rest of the team got some time to rest, he said. I have been playing for eight months. It has been one of the toughest seasons, but it has also been enjoyable. 

On Sourav, Dravid said: It is never the end of the road for anyone. I am not chairman of selectors, and for me to make any blanket statement would be wrong. 

The Indians went through a practice session here without Greg Chappell. The Team India coach skipped the training session owing to an upset stomach, it was learnt. 

Meanwhile, there was drama over Inzamam-ul Haq after his mysterious absence from the meeting with the Match Referee and the media conference. 

He remained untraceable thereafter, according to team sources. He has been unavoidably delayed, coach Bob Woolmer said after Inzamam failed to turn up in time for the mandatory pre-match captains press conference. 

Later, it was revealed that Inzamam had not attended theMatch Referees meeting as well. Manager Saleem Altaf along with coach Bob Woolmer attended the meeting.

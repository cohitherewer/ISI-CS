 Narain eyes big Williams role

 - I would like to take Alex Wurzs place 

New Delhi: Narain Karthikeyan says he is keen to make the most of the big shake-up in the offing in Formula One but would prefer a more prominent role with Williams the next season. 

Motorsports elite event is set for a reshuffle with Kimi Raikkonen set to take over from Michael Schumacher at Ferrari and defending champion Fernando Alonso in turn filling the Finns slot at McLaren in 2007. 

That would give enough scope for manoeuvring for other drivers, but the fastest Indian on wheels is content to aim at the official test drivers slot in the British team. 

That (racing) will be the ideal thing... But I would like to take Alex Wurzs place, the 29-year-old said over phone from Coimbatore. 

Austrian Wurz, Williams current test driver, will be promoted as one of the two race drivers following Mark Webbers decision to depart. 

Karthikeyans preference to stay with Williams is a sign of growing maturity. 

A test drivers role with a leading team will give him better opportunity to learn the nuances of driving an advanced car. 

More importantly, it will give him visibility on racing weekends which he doesnt get as the second test driver and thus more mileage for his sponsors. 

A final decision should be known sooner than later. 

I am in discussions. We will come to know about it in a few weeks time, Indias first F1 driver said. 

In the mean time, he will be busy with a four-day testing programme at Silverstone from September 19 to 22. 

The next round of testing will be in October end. 

And he plans to be in Chennai on September 24 to cheer his own team that will be racing in the second race of the inaugural Formula Rolon. 

His busy schedule means that the launch of his motorsport academy would be possible only at the start of the New Year.

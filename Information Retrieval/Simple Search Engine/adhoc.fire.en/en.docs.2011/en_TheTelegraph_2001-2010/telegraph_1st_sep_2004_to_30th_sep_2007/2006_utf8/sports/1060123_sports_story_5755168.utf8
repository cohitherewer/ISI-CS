 UP need 214 

Mumbai: Uttar Pradesh stormed their way back into the match, after former champions Mumbai squandered the initiative they held on Saturday, on a dramatic third day of their Ranji Trophy semi-final at the Wankhede Stadium here on Sunday. 

At close, Uttar Pradesh, chasing a victory target of 214, were 39 for one in their second innings, and needed 175 runs to win with nine wickets in hand. 

Mumbai, who were 21 for no loss overnight, wiped out the 51-run deficit to lead by 213 runs after being bowled out for 264 in their second innings, 11 overs before stumps, with a defiant Vinayak Samant remaining unbeaten on 64. 

Mumbais top order buckled under pressure imposed by Kaifs attacking field and brilliant bowling by medium pacer Ashish Winston Zaidi.It required the experienced Amol Muzumdar and Ramesh Powar to salvage the Mumbai innings with a 119-run partnership for the fifth wicket, as the former struck an impressive 86 that included 11 fours and Powar smashed 41 which included six boundaries.

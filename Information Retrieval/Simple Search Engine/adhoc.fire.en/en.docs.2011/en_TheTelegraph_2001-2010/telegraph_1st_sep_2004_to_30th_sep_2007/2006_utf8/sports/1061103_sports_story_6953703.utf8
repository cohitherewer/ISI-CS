 Vermeulen arrested

- Suspected Arson attack 

Harare: Controversial former Zimbabwe Test player Mark Vermeulen was questioned by the police on Thursday over a suspected arson attack on the National Cricket Training Academy in Harare. 

The pavilion and computer equipment as well as kit were destroyed by the blaze on Tuesday night at the training centre, a day after a suspicious fire at Zimbabwe Crickets (ZC) boardroom at the harare Sports Club which caused minor damage. 

Hes been detained since yesterday on charges of arson, Vermeulens father Roland said. We dont know at the moment where they are holding him ... But we are trying our best to get him out and sort matters while he is outside. 

Harare police spokesman Andrew Phiri confirmed Vermeulens arrest. He is a suspect in connection with the arson attack at the cricket academy, he said. 

The police have also seized a family car which Vermeulen is alleged to have driven to the academy, said his father. 

The 27-year-old Vermeulen, who played the last of his eight Tests in 2004, recently returned to Zimbabwe after a stint playing league cricket in England where he was slapped with a lengthy ban for throwing a ball at spectators. He was also sent home from the 2003 tour of England after a string of run-ins with the management, including a refusal to travel with the rest of the team after he was twice out for a duck in the same Test match. 

Vermeulen was badly injured on a tour of Australia two years ago when he was struck in the head from a ball and has since been reportedly diagonosed with a depressive illness.

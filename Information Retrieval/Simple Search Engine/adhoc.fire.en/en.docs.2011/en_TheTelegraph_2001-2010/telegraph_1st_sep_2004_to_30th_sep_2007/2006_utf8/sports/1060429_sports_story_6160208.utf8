 Aussies to send full-strength side

Melbourne: Australia promised to send a full-strength squad to the ICC Champions Trophy in India despite growing calls to rest their stars ahead of the Ashes. 

Cricket Australia chief James Sutherland sought to put the issue to rest by stating Australia would go all out for a maiden victory in the biennial one-day competition, to be held in October-November. 

I dont think its an issue, I dont think theres any question right now of players being rested for the Champions Trophy, Sutherland said in Brisbane on Friday. 

Former Test paceman Jeff Thomson also urged selectors to rest star trio of Gilchrist, Ricky Ponting and Brett Lee, as England were considering with Andrew Flintoff, owing to the gruelling schedule. 

Meanwhile, the ACA has also asked the board to give priority to this summers Ashes campaign over the Champions Trophy. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Pakistan board concerned, but?

Karachi: Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) director, board operations, was on Tuesday quoted by local media saying that Pakistan would voice concern over their players safety in India with the International Cricket Council (ICC). 

The safety of the players is the most important issue and we would take all possible steps to ensure their security, Altaf was quoted as saying in a Pakistani newspaper. 

The recent bombings in Mumbai is a cause for concern, but we are confident that the ICC would take care of the players safety issue, he added. 

However, the PCB said it was committed to take part in ICC Champions Trophy despite the July 11 bomb blasts in Mumbai. 

Pakistan and Indian cricket boards enjoy very cordial relations and we want to improve them. At this point of time, we are committed to play in the ICC Champions Trophy in India, PCB director Abbas Zaidi said in a carefully worded statement from Lahore. 

Zaidi added that if there was any security issue ahead of the October event, it would be decided by both the governments. I dont foresee any change in our plans to play in the Champions Trophy. We are fully committed to it, Zaidi said. 

However, if there will be any security issues, they would be addressed by the two governments. It has happened in the past also because security is something that comes directly under the government, and both the boards require government clearance before embarking on any tour, Zaidi said. 

PCB and the Board of Control for Cricket in India enjoy excellent relations, an example of which was seen last month when both, along with Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, combined to beat the strong Australia-New Zealand bid for the 2011 World Cup. (PTI)

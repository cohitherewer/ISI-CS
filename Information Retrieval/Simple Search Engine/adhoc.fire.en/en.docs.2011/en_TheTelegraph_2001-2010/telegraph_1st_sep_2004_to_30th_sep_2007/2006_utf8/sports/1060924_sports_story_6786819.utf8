 Europe go 10-6 ahead 

 - Ryder Cup 

 - Casey lands hole-in-one

Straffan: Inspired by an irrepressible Sergio Garcia and a hole-in-one from Paul Casey, Europe surged into a 10-6 lead over the US on Saturday and need only four points from Sundays singles to retain the Ryder Cup. 

Garcia made it four wins from four matches this week and a remarkable eight out of eight in his foursomes career when he and Luke Donald eased past Phil Mickelson and David Toms 2 amp; 1 at the K Club. 

Minutes later Casey used a four-iron to ace the 213-yard 14th and clinch a 5 amp; 4 win with David Howell over Stewart Cink and Zach Johnson. 

It was only the fifth hole-in-one in Ryder Cup history and the first since Englishman Howard Clark achieved the feat at Oak Hill in 1995. 

Thats unbelievable, thats my first hole-in-one in a professional tournament, Casey said. I hit a four-iron very, very hard and watching the replay it only just made it. 

Colin Montgomerie and Lee Westwood halved their match with Chad Campbell and debutant Vaughn Taylor while Padraig Harrington and Paul McGinley lost 3 amp; 2 to Tiger Woods and Jim Furyk. 

Europe, needing 14 points to retain the trophy, also won the earlier fourballs. Each of the four sessions this week have ended in a 2 1/2 - 1 1/2 triumph for the home side. 

We are getting closer to our mark but just have to get over that hurdle tomorrow, said captain Ian Woosnam. 

In 1999 Europe also led 10-6 going into the singles but lost and Woods said that the Brookline comeback would be their inspiration. 

Its imperative we get off to a quick start as we did in 1999, he said. 

We have to play well as a team, the Europeans are playing well as a team but we have to go out and beat them. (Reuters)

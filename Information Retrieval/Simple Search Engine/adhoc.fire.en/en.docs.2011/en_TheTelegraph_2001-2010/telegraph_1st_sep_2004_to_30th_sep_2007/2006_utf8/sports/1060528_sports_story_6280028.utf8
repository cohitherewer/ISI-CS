 I want to meet Brazil in final, says Messi

Rome: Celebrated forward Lionel Messi, who is recovering from a thigh muscle injury, does not expect to feature in Argentinas World Cup opener against Ivory Coast. 

Today, I dont think Ill be in the team, the gifted teenager said on Saturday. 

I havent played much, Ive been out of action for some time, Messi said. 

He has not played a competitive match since he was injured for Barcelona against Chelsea in March. I just played 15 minutes the other day, he added in reference to Argentinas farewell game in Buenos Aires in which coach Jose Pekermans team beat the national under-20s 4-0. 

Messi, an important part of Argentinas bid for a third World Cup victory in Germany, has been undergoing special treatment to speed his recovery. I know I still have some way to go...(but) Im relaxed, I know I have to keep working, he said. 

Im a bit short but I feel better each day. I think Ill get into rhythm in the time left (before the World Cup). 

I want to play the final and I hope we meet Brazil, added Messi, who inspired Argentina to their fifth World Youth Cup title in The Netherlands last year. 

Argentina, who meet Ivory Coast in their opening Group C match in Hamburg on June 10, are training in Rome. They arrived on Friday and will remain until their warm-up against fellow finalists Angola in Salerno in southern Italy on Tuesday.

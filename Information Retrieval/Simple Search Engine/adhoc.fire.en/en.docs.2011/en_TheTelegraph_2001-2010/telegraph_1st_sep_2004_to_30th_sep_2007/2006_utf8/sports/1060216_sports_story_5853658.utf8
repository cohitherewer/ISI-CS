 Imran Chisty strikes four 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Jockey Imran Chisty found the target on four occasions in Wednesdays seven-event card.

 It was the superior jockeyship of Chisty that helped him win on Notable Guest in the Advertising Cup, and on Tomahawk in the concluding event, for trainers Daniel David and Errol Bhungard, respectively. With Chisty helping their cause again, the two schoolers had a double apiece to their credit at the end of the day.

 The Stringfellows Cup was an easy pick for Javed Khans Kandinsky, the four-year-old, who notched his fourth win of the season. Apprentice Jugnu Gurang partnered the Tecorno-Amidst son.

 Making his presence felt with a moderate string, trainer Harvinder Singh Bath, too, chipped in a rich-double through less-fancied winners Going Starry and Malkin.

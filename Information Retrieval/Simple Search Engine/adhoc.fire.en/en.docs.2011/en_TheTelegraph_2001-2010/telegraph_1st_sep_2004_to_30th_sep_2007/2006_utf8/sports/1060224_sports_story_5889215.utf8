The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Malhotra: Souravs fate is quite clear

 - The way he batted in Karachi, I thought hes a certainty: Pranab 

OUR STAFF REPORTERS

Calcutta: Sourav Gangulys former Test mates Devang Gandhi and Deep Dasgupta refused to comment on his exclusion from the 15-member squad for the first Test against England. But other former cricketers were more forthcoming. While some such as Sambaran Banerjee felt it was a very unfortunate decision, others like Ashok Malhotra felt the writing is on the wall for Sourav. 

The following are excerpts: 

 SAMBARAN BANERJEE: It is a very unfortunate 

 decision. I couldnt understand the policy adopted 

 by the selection committee. They are maintaining double 

 standards towards Sourav Ganguly. I understand that they 

 are looking towards the World Cup. But then the team should 

 be a mix of experienced and junior players. If you can accommodate 

 players like VVS Laxman and Anil Kumble in the team, who 

 all I doubt would last till the World Cup, then why not 

 Sourav. 

Whether he should call it a day after this decision is up to him but I personally feel that he still has a lot of cricket left in him. But after Thursdays decision, I think the selectors have shut the doors on him. 

 BARUN BURMAN: Though the Indian squad is a 

 set one at the moment, Sourav should have been included. 

 Since Yuvraj is ruled out, Sourav should have made the final 

 XI too. I think he is a victim of dirty politics which will 

 affect Indian cricket in the long run. 

I also believe that Suresh Raina cannot be Souravs replacement. This is absurd. Greg Chappell, Kiran More and few other cricketers have formed a nexus to keep him out of the fray. 

Sourav should come out strongly against those who are tarnishing the image of the game and then quit on protest. 

 ASHOK MALHOTRA: 

 I think it was 

 coming and the decision has made it clear that the selectors 

 have already made their mind to keep Sourav out. If they 

 are talking about the future by infusing young blood, then 

 why single out only Sourav? Since Yuvraj was ruled out, 

 Sourav should have made the squad and I cannot blame the 

 selectors alone for the decision, I think its also 

 the managements move to shut the door on the former 

 skipper. It seems Souravs fate is quite clear. 

Bouncing back or quitting the game is solely up to him, but that the selectors have made their policy is crystal clear by now. 

 PARAS MHAMBREY: It was selectors decision 

 and I dont know what their policy is, I am not in 

 a position to comment anything on this. 

Regarding quitting cricket, he is the best judge and it is only Sourav who can take the decision at the right time. 

 SARADINDU MUKHERJEE: When I saw Yuvraj is not 

 playing, I thought he would be an automatic choice, but 

 it is very disappointing not to see him in the squad. I 

 saw both the innings he played in Pakistan against the likes 

 of Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Asif, and he looked good. 

 Though he got out in 30s, that cannot be termed as failures. 

 I definitely feel that the selectors will consider him later 

 in the series. 

Though quitting is a personal decision, I still believe he has some years of cricket left in him. He shouldnt say goodbye to the game, after such a decision. 

 PRANAB ROY: I was very surprised to see Souravs 

 name missing from the squad. I thought he was a certainty 

 after the way he batted in the Karachi Test. And with Yuvraj 

 not playing, Sourav should definitely have been there. 

The explanation given was that it was important to give youngsters a chance, but I feel a proper mix of youth and experience is also crucial. 

I dont think he should quit. Let him play a few more matches and show that hes still worthy of playing for the national team.

 Nadal, Justine crash out 

Miami: Spains Rafael Nadal and Justine Henin-Hardenne of Belgium were sent packing from the Nasdaq-100 Open on Friday. 

Carlos Moya won the battle of Mallorca, defeating world number two Nadal 2-6, 6-1, 6-1 in the second round of the mens event. 

In the womens competition, third seed Henin-Hardenne lost 5-7, 4-6 to American Meghann Shaughnessy. 

The 29-year-old Moya gave a masterful display against French Open champion Nadal, who was beaten by Roger Federer in last years Nasdaq final. Nadal saved two match points against his fellow Spaniard before losing his serve for the fifth time to send Moya through. 

The 19-year-old Nadal was playing in his fourth tournament since recovering from an ankle injury. 

Six-time champion Andre Agassi withdrew with a chronic back injury before his opening match against Belgiums Christophe Rochus. 

Its been the same story for a little while, the 35-year-old American told reporters. There are a couple of good days followed by a series of difficult ones. It has been frustrating and exhausting, this whole process of trying to push myself through just a few events this year.

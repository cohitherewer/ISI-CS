 Red to clash with Blue

 - Sourav does his cause no good with back-to-back failures at a time when central contracts are up for renewal

 India Red opener Robin Uthappa drives one en route to his 92 against India Green during their Challenger Trophy match in Chennai on Tuesday 

Chennai: Sourav Ganguly has failed to make use of the two opportunities that came his way during the Challenger Trophy. 

On Monday, he as an India green player, failed to capitalise on a good start, falling for 24, against Rahul Dravid-led India Blue. Against India Red, it was worse as he was bowled for three. There will be no more chance for Sourav in the tournament as India Blue will now meet India Red in the final on Wednesday. 

Sourav did his cause no good at a time when the central contracts will be up for renewal. 

The tournament was to be a big challenge for Sourav as he was picked in the weakest of the three teams. While he has come a cropper, youngsters like Gautam Gambhir have sent a timely reminder to the selection panel, headed by Dilip Vengsarkar. The Delhi opener, playing for India Red, hit 110 in the opener and followed it up with another 74 on Tuesday. 

It is also clear that the former Team India captain was not encouraged in the backdrop of comments by Board of Control for Cricket in India president Sharad Pawar. Even Sourav can make a comeback depending on his performance in the Challenger Trophy and at the domestic level, Pawar had said. 

On Monday, Sachin Tendulkar might have stolen the limelight with a masterly 139 for India Blue. When there was no realistic chance of Red achieving the target of 382, the attention mainly revolved around Sourav and how he would face up to the challenge of the Munaf Patels and the Ajit Agarkars. It was the moment all had been waiting for. 

He ducked smartly under an Agarkar bouncer that greeted him. A square drive off Munaf was followed by a vintage cover drive. 

The dismissal after 44 minutes, 30 balls and four boundaries was all too familiar. A slightly short and wayward delivery needed a better shot than the cut essayed. As he played well away from his body, Ravinder Jadeja held it well at point. 

The India Greens reply never looked assuring as they lost wickets at regular intervals to be finally bundled out for 115 in 26.4 overs. Harbhajan Singh did the star turn with a four-wicket haul. 

On Tuesday, the script didnt unfold in an unknown manner. There was nothing in Souravs brief stay at the wicket that suggested he was hungry for runs or that he had re-invented his touch. Rooted to the crease, he played on a Sreesanth delivery after making just three. 

The other aspiring youngsters didnt disappoint. Robin Uthappa showed how adept he is at building an innings with a superb 92, Dinesh Karthik, too, dazzled with an enterprising 85 as India Red notched up 317 for four in 50 overs. 

Uthappa and Gambhir paced their innings well. Gambhir was lucky early on as he was let off by wicketkeeper Parthiv Patel in the fourth over off Kumar with his score on one. 

In reply, the stars failed but Patel (69) and Piyush Chawla (55) made their presence felt for a brief while. In the end, India Green fell for 278 in 48.4 overs, Reds winning by 39 runs. 

 India Red were served well with both pace and spin 

 bowlers not having to exert much. Ramesh Powar scalped three, 

 including that of a well-settled Mohammed Kaif and Partiv. 

 Sreesanth provided the initial thrust by dismissing openers, 

 Wasim Jaffer and Sourav.

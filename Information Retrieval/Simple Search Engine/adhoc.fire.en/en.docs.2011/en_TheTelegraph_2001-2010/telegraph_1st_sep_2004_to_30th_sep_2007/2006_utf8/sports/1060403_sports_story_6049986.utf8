The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Sourav, Laxman should be included: 

 Vengsarkar 

 - Former Team India captain to feature in discussion 

 INDRANIL MAJUMDAR

 Vengsarkar

Margao: Former India captain Dilip Vengsarkar feels Sourav Ganguly and V.V.S. Laxman deserve a place in the current Indian one-day International squad. 

Seniors like Sourav and Laxman should be included. Its great that the juniors are performing well and winning matches for India... But it should be a blend of juniors and seniors that will take this side forward, Vengsarkar told The Telegraph here on Sunday. 

Vengsarkar, who is set to be in the International Cricket Council (ICC) Match Referees panel, praised the efforts of the juniors. Guys like Suresh Raina, Sreesanth and Rudra Pratap Singh have performed excellently. Theyre still young and possess immense potential. They need to be nurtured. Putting too much burden on their shoulders will not do them any good. It is here that the role of the seniors come into the forefront, he explained. 

Vengsarkar is not reading too much into the recent failures of Virender Sehwag. He is too good a player... You cant judge him by a few failures. You cant ignore him for his recent form. 

With the national selectors set to pick the squad for the remaining four ODIs of the current series as well as the two matches against Pakistan in Abu Dhabi on Monday, Vengsarkars comments assume much significance. Chairman Kiran More, V.B. Chandrasekhar and Bhupinder Singh are already in town, while Sanjay Jagdale and Ranjib Biswal are expected before the meeting. 

It is learnt that Souravs name will prominently feature in the discussions in the wake of the top and middle-orders failure. How can you continue to ignore him? If performance is the sole criterion, then what about the players who are consistently drawing a blank? The Sachin factor should also be taken into account, said a selector who refused to be identified. 

Gautam Gambhir and Yalaka Venugopal Rao, who has been unimpressive even at nets, will be under pressure to retain their places. Whether Greg Chappell and More will yield from their hard stance against Sourav is unknown, but the former Team India captain will be back in discussions.

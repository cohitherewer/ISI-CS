 Vaughan in fitness race

Vadodara: England captain Michael Vaughan said he would have to wait 48 hours to see if his injured knee has improved sufficiently for him to play in the first Test against India next week. 

Vaughan, who is sitting out Englands final three-day warm-up match against the Board Presidents XI, had light nets on Friday to test the troublesome injury. 

I had a light net session today to test out the knee, he said. It is still too early to say whether the injection has had an effect. 

Well just have to wait and see if it responds over the next 48 hours, he told reporters. 

He was later seen wearing an ice-pack and a team spokesman said Vaughans prospects for playing the first Test would be assessed after the three-day game ends on Saturday. 

Vaughans fitness will be crucial for England, who are chasing their first Test series victory in India for 21 years. The opening game of the three-Test series starts in Nagpur on Wednesday. 

The England captain also missed the first Test in Pakistan in November due to knee trouble and skipped the subsequent one-day series to undergo surgery.

 Faraz Zafar and N. Daniel sounded

 of the match at the Mohun Bagan ground. 

 The outstation teams are expected 

 to reach here by Tuesday for the quarter final matches.

 There were no doctors at the Mohun 

 Bagan ground on the opening day. We have an arrangement 

 with the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) and whenever 

 there is any need for medical attention, the players can 

 be taken to CAB, a Bengal Hockey Association official 

 said. 

 However, he also assured proper 

 medical arrangements during the latter part of the meet.

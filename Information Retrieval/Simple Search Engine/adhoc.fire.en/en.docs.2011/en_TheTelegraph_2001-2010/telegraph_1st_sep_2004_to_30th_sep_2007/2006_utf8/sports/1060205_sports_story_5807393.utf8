 Bagan to go all out vs Salgaocar

 Bagan coach Das is a worried man 

Panaji: Three-time champions Mohun Bagan, desperately looking to score their first win, will be going all out to collect full points against Salgaocar in the 10th ONGC National Football League (NFL) match on Sunday at the Nehru Stadium in Fatorda. 

Both the teams are on four points and are struggling to find form. But Bagan ? who have played one match more than Salgaocar ? are placed at ninth while Salgaocar are placed at sixth, after playing five matches. 

Salgaocar will be looking to find their rhythm in the match to unsettle the rival defence. 

The Salgaocar defence looked ordinary against Mahindra United in the absence of Robert Fernandes. Manitombi Singh and captain Remus Gomes will, however, provide strength to the team. 

With the return of medio Micky Fernandes, Salgaocar are in full strength. 

Salgaocar coach Savio Medeira said, We need to start well unlike our previous matches where we found ourselves at the receiving end in the first half. It is in the second half that our boys have fought well, but not before they conceded goals in the first half which saw us on the losing side. 

Now that our boys are committed to giving their best from the start, we are hoping for a win which will help us to go above JCT, stated Medeira. 

Bagan will be missing Subashis Roy Chowdhury as he is serving double booking. Bagan coach Jahar Das is desperately looking for a win and wants to collect full points which will satisfy the team before they leave for home to play their next match. 

With four points from six matches, Das main worry still remains scoring a goal. The only goal so far came via penaty kick, through captain Mehtab Hussain in the last match. 

Das intends to do a special week-long session with foreign duo ? Coffi Agbessi and Awudu Ibrahim ? who have failed to deliver any goods in the competition.

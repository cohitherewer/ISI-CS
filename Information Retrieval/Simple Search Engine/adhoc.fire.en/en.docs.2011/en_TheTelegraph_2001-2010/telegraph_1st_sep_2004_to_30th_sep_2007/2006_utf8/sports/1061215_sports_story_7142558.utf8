 Koneru Humpy after India won the team gold on Thursday

Doha: Indias gold haul in the Asian Games here started 10 days ago when Koneru Humpy struck it rich in the rapid chess event. 

On Thursday, Indias last gold in this edition of the Games also came in chess when the team comprising Krishnan Sasikiran, Pentalaya and Humpy emerged easy winners in the Swiss Classical event. In the last match of the day, India drew with Kazakhstan to top the table with 22.5 points. While China finished second with five points behind India, Iran, coached by Nigel Short, settled for bronze. 

So dominating were the Indians at the Al-Dana Indoor Hall that they ensured victory at least four days back when they defeated strong contenders China. 

Sasikiran, who failed to win in rapid chess, said that after the relatively moderate show in the Chess Olympiad in Turin, where India finished third, the win in the Asian Games has come as a great morale booster. 

We coordinated very well as a team. Had Vishy (Viswanathan Anand) been there, we would have emerged even stronger and would have won gold in the mens individual rapid chess as well, he said. 

Sasi said he would now prepare for the Aeroflot meet to be played in Moscow. 

Humpy said the team did very well despite the absence of Anand. We missed him, but then, playing at the Games had only a negligible effect on his ELO points. 

Humpy said she was very happy to clinch the gold and this has been the teams best performance ever. 

We never have been able to register so many resounding wins at a stretch. We played very well and luck also favoured us this time, she said.

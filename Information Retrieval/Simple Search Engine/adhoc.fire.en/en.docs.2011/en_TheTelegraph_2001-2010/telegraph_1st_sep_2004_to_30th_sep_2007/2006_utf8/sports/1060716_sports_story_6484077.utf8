Sylvis (Illinois): A steady two-under 69 moved overnight joint leader Daniel Chopra to tied second place at the halfway stage of the John Deere Classic Golf Tournament. 

Starting on the back nine, Chopra turned in two-under 34 after three birdies and a bogey on the par-five 17th. He then held his game together on the way home with two birdies and as many bogeys. 

After just 22 putts in the opening round, Chopra used five more on the second day which was still quite impressive. Arjun Atwal showed great determination when he fired in a 67 after an opening round of 71 to comfortably make it to the weekend round. 

The four-under card moved him from a tied 93rd place to tied 39th at four-under 138. The Indian star will now be looking for a good finish at the tournament as he needs to move up the rankings with the PGA Tour moving into the second half of the season. 

Atwal notched up half a dozen birdies as against just two bogeys in his impressive round. 

The story of the day, however, was Michelle Wies withdrawal from the tournament due to heat exhaustion on a hot, steamy afternoon. 

The teenager was halfway through her round when she decided that she could not carry on any further and was treated at a local hospital. 

She suffered a number of different symptoms, including stomach pains, nausea, dizziness and breathing problems which worsened as the round continued, Wies agent, Ross Berlin, said in a statement. 

She was treated at the emergency room of the Genesis Medical Centre. Michelle was diagnosed with heat exhaustion and is now resting and in very good spirits. 

American Joe Ogilvie was the second round leader at 10-under 132 after a four-under 67. Chopra (69), Kris Cox (68), John Senden (69) and John Huston (67) are one stroke back at nine-under. (PTI)

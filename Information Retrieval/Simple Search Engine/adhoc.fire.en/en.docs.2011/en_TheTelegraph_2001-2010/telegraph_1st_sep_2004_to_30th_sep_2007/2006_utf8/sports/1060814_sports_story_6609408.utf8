The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Full support to FPAI: Barreto 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Jose Ramirez Barreto was all praise for Bhaichung Bhutia and the Indian footballers at the formal launch of Football Players Association of India (FPAI) on Sunday. Barreto informed that he would soon become a member of the FPAI. 

It is a wonderful and very good initiative by the players. I will give my full support to the FPAI. This sort of an association was badly needed here, said the Brazilian stri- ker. 

The clubs can no longer take the players for granted. The FPAI will stand by the players and educate them, so that they dont tend to lose anything financially. It will put the players on a solid platform, he added.

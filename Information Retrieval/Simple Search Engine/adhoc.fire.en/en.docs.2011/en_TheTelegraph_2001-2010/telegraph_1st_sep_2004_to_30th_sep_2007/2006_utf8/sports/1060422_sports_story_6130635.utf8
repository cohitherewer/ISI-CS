 Seedorf, Makaay left out

Amsterdam: Netherlands coach Marco van Basten left out experienced duo Clarence Seedorf and Roy Makaay in a provisional 33-man World Cup squad named on Friday. 

Makaay, who has scored only six goals in 43 appearances for the Dutch side, lost his spot in the squad earlier this season and is no longer considered as back up to first-choice striker Ruud van Nistelrooy. 

Ajax Amsterdam striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar, the first divisions top scorer, gets a place for the first time. 

The 30-year-old Seedorf won the last of his 77 caps in Euro 2004 and has not been selected since Van Basten took charge after the finals. 

The Dutch squad gather on May 9 for a four-day training camp in Noordwijk.

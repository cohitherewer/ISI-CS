 Shoaib to visit Australia for troubled knees

 Shoaib wants to be fit for England tour 

Karachi: Pakistan fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar said on Thursday he will fly to Australia next week to see a specialist after being diagnosed with a degenerative disease in his left knee. 

But the 30-year-old said he hoped to regain fitness in time for Pakistans tour of England, despite also suffering problems with the other knee and his left ankle. 

I am going to Australia next week to get a specialists opinion on the two injured knees and if they advise an operation, I will have it done and hopefully get fit for the England tour, Shoaib said. 

I dont want to miss the England tour, and hope that I make it after healing the injuries, said Shoaib. 

Shoaib, who has taken 165 wickets in 42 Tests and 199 wickets in 129 ODIs, said he would consult Australian surgeon David Young next week. 

A PCB medical panel diagnosed the degenerative disease in his left knee but Shoaib said his right knee has also caused him trouble for a long time. 

Both my knees were causing problems but I played on despite these injuries, just for the sake of my team, said Shoaib, who took just four wickets in the 1-0 home Test series win against India earlier this month. 

Pakistan will tour England from mid-June to play four Tests and five ODIs, and Shoaib said he desperately wants to play. 

Captain Inzamam-ul Haq and coach Bob Woolmer ? who both criticised Shoaibs commitment in the past ? hailed his change in attitude in last years victorious home series against England, when he took 14 wickets. (AFP)

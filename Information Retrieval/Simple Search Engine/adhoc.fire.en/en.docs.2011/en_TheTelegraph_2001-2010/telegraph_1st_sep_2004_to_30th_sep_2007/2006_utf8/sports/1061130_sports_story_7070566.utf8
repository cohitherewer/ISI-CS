 Sourav steps 

 down, Deep to lead

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Ranji Trophy

 Calcutta: 

 Sourav Ganguly on Wednesday decided to relinquish the 

 Bengal captaincy citing personal reasons. Bengal take on 

 Mumbai in a Ranji Trophy Super League tie at the Eden from 

 Friday.

 Deep Dasgupta has been appointed 

 captain for the season. Kamal Hasan Mondal has been asked 

 to stand by, keeping in mind the possibility that Sourav 

 may be included in the Indian squad for the Test series 

 against South Africa. 

 The national selectors meet in 

 New Delhi on Thursday.

 The former Team India captain 

 had made it known to the CAB officials on Tuesday that he 

 wasnt interested in leading against Mumbai and wanted 

 to concentrate on his batting. An effort was made to dissuade 

 him, but Sourav stood firm.

 CAB joint secretary Saradindu 

 Pal said that Sourav decided to lead against Punjab at the 

 request of his teammates. Now that he has requested 

 us again that he be allowed to step down, we agreed, 

 he added.

 Meanwhile, selection committee 

 chairman Dilip Vengsarkar is likely to be present during 

 the match. He is expected to arrive on Friday.

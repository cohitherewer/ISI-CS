 Pakistan A brush aside Holland

Abu Dhabi: Bazid Khan hit a half century as Pakistan A sailed to a convincing 123-run win over The Netherlands in the BSNL Eurasia Cup at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium here on Tuesday. 

The middle order batsman slammed an unbeaten 77 off only 50 balls, studded with 11 boundaries, and guided Pakistan A to a mammoth 306 for four in the stipulated 50 overs. Later, they restricted The Netherlands to 183 for eight. 

After electing to bat, Pakistan had a steady start before losing opener Yasir Hameed for 25. Taufiq Umar (62) and Mohammed Hafeez (57) put up a 97-run stand for the second wicket to lay the foundation for a big total. However, the Dutch bowlers managed to dismiss three Pakistani batsmen within 40 runs and raked in the scoring rate for a while. 

But they failed to keep up the pressure as Bazid and Misbah-ul Haq (45 ..) built an unbeaten 121-run partnership for the fifth wicket. 

Later, Umar Gul and Yasir Arafat picked up early wickets denying the Europeans a good start. Thanks to a gritty knock by P Borren (45), The Netherlands managed to reach a respectable total after being reduced to 68 for four at one stage.

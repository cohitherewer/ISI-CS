 Randhawa makes cut

Gleneagles: It was a day of mixed fortunes for the Indians as Jyoti Randhawa moved into tied 22nd spot while Shiv Kapur failed to make the cut in the Johnie Walker Championship golf here on Friday. 

Randhawa carded a two-under 71 for an overall three-under 143 that put him seven shots behind leader Colin Montgomerie who returned a second successive 68. 

Kapur began strongly with three birdies on the front nine before a nightmarish back nine spoiled his day. (PTI)

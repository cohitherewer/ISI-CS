Leeds: Pakistans Mohammed Yousuf and Younis Khan shredded the record books with a 363-run stand in the third Test against England on Sunday before the home side staged a belated fightback. 

Yousuf fell just eight runs of completing the fifth double century of his Test career while Younis was run out for 173 as the touring side, replying to Englands first innings of 515, were dismissed for 538 just before the close of the third day. 

England, who lead the four-match series 1-0, ended the day 20 runs behind after surviving two overs to get to three without loss in their second innings. 

Yousuf, who made 223 against England in Lahore at the end of last year and 202 at Lords earlier in this series, made the most of Saturdays reprieve when he was dropped on five to serve up a scintillating display of strokeplay. 

In all, he scored 112 in boundaries 25 fours and two sixes before he was caught off the glove facing Steve Harmison to make it 399 for three. 

Younis, who batted for almost seven hours, was run out by a direct throw from Sajid Mahmood. He and Yousuf had come together on Saturday with the score on 36 for two. 

That sparked a collapse as three wickets fell for four runs in 10 balls just before tea. Inzamam-ul Haq was one of those wickets, making 26 before comically falling onto his own stumps while facing left-arm spinner Monty Panesar. 

Yousuf and Younis stand was a Pakistan record against England for any wicket. It was also the highest third-wicket stand against England by any team, overhauling the 338 compiled by Everton Weekes and Frank Worrell for the West Indies in Port of Spain in 1953-54. 

Panesar was Englands best bowler, taking three for 127. 

The home teams hopes of pressing for a series-clinching victory quickly evaporated in the morning session, though, as Pakistan added 129 runs without alarm. 

Yousuf and Younis deflated, demoralised and then totally dismantled the England attack, at the same time keeping alive the outside possibility of Pakistan amassing a sizeable first-innings lead and pressing for an unlikely victory. 

The main feature of the two right-handers play was some sublime straight driving, although that also underlined the flatness of the Headingley pitch. 

The bowlers, however, did not help themselves with a lifeless display. 

 Within the first hour Matthew Hoggard, failing to find any movement in the air or off the pitch, was bowling without any slips. Neither he nor Harmison or Mahmood seemed capable of mixing up their pace or surprising the batsmen with yorkers. 

Yousuf provided the first of many batting highlights, guiding a delivery from Harmison to the point boundary to get to 96 and then hooking him for six. It was his 18th Test century and his fifth against his favourite opponents. 

Younis took a little longer four and a quarter hours to match his teammate and record his 12th Test century. 

Soon the records began to tumble and such was the batsmens domination that there seemed a possibility of them threatening the 451 put on by Bill Ponsford and Don Bradman in 1938, the highest stand of all time recorded against England. 

Yousuf, however, suddenly seemed to get bored. Swatting at a Harmison lifter, he was caught behind down the leg side off the glove. He had faced 261 balls.

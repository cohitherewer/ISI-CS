 Double podium finishes for Chandhok

New Delhi: Karun Chandhok clinched two podium finishes to move to second position in the Asia Formula Renault V6 motorsports championship in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. 

The 22-year old, driving for E-Rain, finished second and third at the Sepang F1 circuit in rounds three and four to jump two places up from his previous position after the first two rounds, a press release said here on Sunday. 

Looking back at the weekend, Karun said: This was a hard weekend for us. We were unable to get the handling sorted either in the wet or the dry like we had in the first weekend. 

But at the end of the day, to go home with two podiums and second place in the championship is something that both the team and I can be happy with. 

Karun will race next in Indonesia on the July 23.

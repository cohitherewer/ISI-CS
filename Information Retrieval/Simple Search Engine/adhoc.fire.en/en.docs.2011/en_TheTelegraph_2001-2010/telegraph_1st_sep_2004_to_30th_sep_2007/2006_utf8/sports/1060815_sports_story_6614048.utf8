 Cronje died due to pilot error: Judge

Durban: Pilot error was responsible for the death of former South African captain Hansie Cronje in a plane crash in 2002, a judge ruled on Monday. 

Judge Siraj Desai, who delivered his verdict in the Cape high court in Cape Town on the cause of the plane crash in the mountains near the town of George, said there were other contributory factors too, but the tragedy could have been avoided had the pilots heeded warnings and followed the procedure. 

The pilots, Willem Meyer and Ian Noakes, were also killed in the crash on June 1, 2002. The deaths could be attributed to their negligence, Desai said, although rain, malfunctioning of the aircrafts equipment and the landing system at George airport also played their part. 

The judge ruled that the pilots did not climb to a higher altitude when they were instructed to do so. The complacency of the pilot in command was surprising and... The co-pilot failed under the circumstances to do what a reasonable pilot would have done, Desai said. (PTI)

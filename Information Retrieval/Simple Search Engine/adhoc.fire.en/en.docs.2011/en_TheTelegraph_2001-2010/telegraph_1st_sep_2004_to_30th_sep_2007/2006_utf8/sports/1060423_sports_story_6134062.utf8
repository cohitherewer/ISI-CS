Monte Carlo: World number 

 one Roger Federer crushed Fernando Gonzalez 6-2, 6-4 on 

 Saturday to set up a Monte Carlo Masters final against No. 

 2 Rafael Nadal.

 Top seed Federer, who had previously 

 never gone beyond the quarter finals in the tournament, 

 played close to perfection to move past Chilean baseliner 

 Gonzalez.

 Title-holder Nadal, the second 

 seed, stepped up a gear after losing a tight first set to 

 outpower Gaston Gaudio 5-7, 6-1, 6-1 in the other semi-final.

 The battle between the last two 

 winners of the French Open was close only for one set.

 Spains world number two 

 Nadal, who succeeded Argentine baseliner Gaudio as French 

 Open champion last year, fought back from a break down in 

 that first set.

 A combative Gaudio broke his opponent 

 again in the 11th game to serve for the set, which the Argentine 

 took after 78 minutes.

 Nadal broke Gaudio in the fourth 

 and again in the fifth game of the second set before wrapping 

 it up. 

 The muscular Spaniard stayed on 

 top in the decisive set courtesy of his trademark, aggressive 

 baseline play.

 It was my toughest match 

 this week, Nadal said, even though he never appeared 

 to be in trouble after the first set.

 He had beaten me three times 

 on clay before and I knew it would not be easy, added 

 the 19-year-old Spaniard.

 Nadal has won 41 consecutive matches 

 on clay, which puts him third on the all-time list, behind 

 Guillermo Vilas (53) and Bjorn Borg (46)

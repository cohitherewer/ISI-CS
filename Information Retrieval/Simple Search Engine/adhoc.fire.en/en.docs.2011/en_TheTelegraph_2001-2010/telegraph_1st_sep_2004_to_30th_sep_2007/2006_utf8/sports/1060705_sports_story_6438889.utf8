The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Greater value for innings overseas

 - Team India captain does'nt rate but... 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Calcutta: Team India captain 

 Rahul Dravid doesnt believe in ratings and numbers, 

 but he did list his most satisfying Test innings 

 in a chat with The Telegraph.

 Obviously, the exclusive list 

 included the epics at Sabina Park ? 81 and 68, innings which 

 earned both the MoS and the MoM awards not very many hours 

 ago.

 Dravid has just completed a decade 

 of Test cricket.

 Usually, the ones which 

 make a difference overseas give more satisfaction? But, 

 then, its not necessary theyve got to be hundreds, 

 he said, while talking from the Hilton in Kingston.

 Dravid didnt rank 

 the 81 and 68, which have been applauded by icons such as 

 Sunil Gavaskar and Brian Lara, but spoke of both in much 

 the same breath as five other stellar innings ? only one 

 being at home, at the Eden here.

 Incidentally, while Kapil Dev 

 has saluted Dravid as the greatest Indian batsman (a view 

 made public through these columns on Tuesday), coach Greg 

 Chappell praised his captain thus: History would show 

 that he is one of the best players for anyone, forget about 

 India?

 Nobody is going to disagree. 

 Footnote: Dravid, meanwhile, 

 is happy at being named the World XI captain for a charity 

 Twenty20 match against Pakistan, at The Oval in London, 

 next week. There was talk that I would be asked to 

 lead, but Im learning of the appointment from you? 

 Its nice, he remarked.

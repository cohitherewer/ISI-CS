The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Pak start love-one down, 

 says captain

 Davis cup Tie vs India

 Karachi: Pakistan Davis 

 Cup captain Rasheed Malik has said his team would start 

 love-one down against India who boast of a demolition 

 doubles team in Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi.

 Malik also said that although 

 Pakistan were aware of their unimpressive track record against 

 India in Davis Cup, his team would go all out for glory 

 in the Asia-Oceania Zone group I second round play-off tie 

 at Mumbais Brabourne Stadium from April 7 to 9.

 History is against us in 

 this historic tie, and frankly speaking we would be starting 

 love-one down because of the champion Indian pair of Leander 

 Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi. 

 But whenever and whichever 

 sport you play against India, the motivation and the zest 

 for glory is there. We will be travelling to India with 

 an aim to scale the mountain this time, Malik said.

 Pakistan team arrives in Mumbai 

 on Monday, four days before the match. The Indian team is 

 led by Paes, with Bhupathi, Prakash Amritraj and Rohan Bopanna 

 also in the ranks.

 Unlike cricket, the traditional 

 rivals have played just five times against each other, with 

 the last meeting being almost 33 years ago at Kuala Lumpur, 

 where India won 4-0.

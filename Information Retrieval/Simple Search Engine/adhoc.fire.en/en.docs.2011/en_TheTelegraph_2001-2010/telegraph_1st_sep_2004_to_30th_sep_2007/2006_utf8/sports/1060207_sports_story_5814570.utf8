 Atletico end Barcelona run

Madrid: Atletico Madrid lived up to their reputation as Barcelonas bogey team when they ended the Spanish champions 14-match winning run in the league with an emphatic 3-1 victory at the Nou Camp on Sunday. 

A classy double from Fernando Torres and another from Maxi Rodriguez allowed Atletico to complete the double over the Catalans this season. Barcelona still enjoy a nine-point lead over Valencia at the top of the table. 

Valencia extended their unbeaten league run to 11 matches after a 1-0 win at Deportivo Coruna on Saturday. Real Madrid are in third spot.

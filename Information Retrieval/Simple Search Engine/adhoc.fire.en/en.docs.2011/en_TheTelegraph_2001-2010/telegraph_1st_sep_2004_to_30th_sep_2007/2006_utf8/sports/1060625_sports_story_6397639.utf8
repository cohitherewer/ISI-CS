 Shootouts deal agony and ecstasy 

Hattingen: Since their introduction in 1982 penalty shootouts have caused some of the World Cups highest highs and lowest lows, making heroes of journeymen players while exposing the fallibility of superstars. 

Sixteen World Cup matches have been decided by the cruel but undeniably exciting tie-breaker, including three of the four quarter-finals in 1986, both semis four years later and the final in 1994. 

Kicks from the penalty mark is an innocuous phrase that for some teams is a virtual passport to the next round while for others it is enough to reduce them to gibbering wrecks. 

The concept was introduced in the long-defunct Watney Cup in England in 1970 and the capricious nature of the beast was immediately apparent as George Best became the first man to score and his Manchester United team mate Denis Law the first to miss. 

The shootout has never respected reputations and the seemingly simple post-match act of beating a goalkeeper from 12 yards has proved too much for such luminaries as Diego Maradona, Roberto Baggio, Michel Platini, Socrates and David Batty. 

On the other hand, the careers of goalkeepers such as Irelands Packie Bonner, Argentine stand-in Sergio Goycochea and Spains Iker Casillas have been made by their saves. 

Germany lost the first major international shootout to Czechoslovakia in the 1976 European Championship final but have been imperious since, winning three out of three in World Cups and also beating England in the Euro 96 semi-finals. 

Argentina also have few fears when 120 minutes are up as they are also three and in the World Cup while Brazil have won five and lost three of their eight shootouts in tournaments, including one win and one defeat in Copa America finals. 

Brazils most famous shootout success came in the 1994 World Cup final after 120 goalless, gruelling minutes against Italy. Such was the magnitude of the event that Italys craggy-faced hard-man defender Franco Baresi was left a blubbering wreck after missing his spot kick. 

Roberto Baggio, who had almost single-handedly hauled Italy to the final and acquired the nickname the divine ponytail, then made the last, agonising contribution. 

He skied the decisive spot kick and stood under the gaze of a billion eyes, utterly alone. 

For Italy it was one of a trio of shootout heartbreaks that began when they lost to Argentina in the 1990 semi-finals on home soil ? the South Americans having also beaten Yugoslavia in the quarter-finals the same way ? and continued when they went out to France in the 1998 quarters.

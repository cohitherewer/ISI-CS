 ICC: There was no pay-off discussion 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The ICC quickly reacted to Darrell Hairs statement claiming that he had been encouraged to make a written offer. 

In a press release, the ICC reconfirmed that Hair did discuss the future of his umpiring career with Doug Cowie before sending an e-mail to the umpires and referees manager on Tuesday, but at no stage was there any discussion of a pay-off, secrecy, deadlines, or misleading the public regarding reasons for retirement. 

There were many informal discussions between Mr Hair and Mr Cowie between the end of The Oval Test and Mr Hairs first e-mail on Tuesday, including a discussion on the potential impact on Mr Hairs umpiring career, an ICC spokesperson said. 

Mr Cowies role was to support and counsel Mr Hair, as his manager, at a difficult time and it is our understanding that at no stage during their conversations was there any discussion of a pay-off, secrecy, deadlines or misleading the public regarding reasons for retirement all of which were subsequently laid out in Mr Hairs e-mail. 

It was also confirmed that no other ICC staff member discussed any of the above-mentioned issues with Hair during this period. 

The spokesperson added: We have no desire to be in conflict with Mr Hair. He is one of the worlds best umpires and we have no doubt that he was under a great deal of stress when he sent the e-mails that he later revoked. 

There remain two simple cricket matters arising from The Oval Test to be resolved and we look forward to the effective resolution of these matters and the resumption of on-field action. 

Agencies add: With the Hair controversy raging, ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed said on a BBC programme he hoped Darrell Hair could continue umpiring but was not sure it would happen. 

Asked if Hair could retain his place on ICCs Elite Panel, Speed said he wanted the Aussie to continue umpiring at the top level. 

Hes very devoted and dedicated to umpiring, said Speed. There have been other issues in his career when people have said this is the end for Darrell Hair, he cant continue to umpire. 

Speed was uncertain, however, if Hair could ride out the storm. Im not sure that will happen, Speed said of Hairs continued presence on the Elite Panel. Because there is a lot of speculation from people like Nasser Hussain and others who believe Hair is finished, that he has compromised. 

ICC general manager Dave Richardson admitted that Hairs decision to seek money in return for quitting was a serious error, but added that the Australian was among the top three Test umpires. 

 Hes shown himself to be a very strong 

 man over his career. He came back from the Muralidharan 

 controversy a better umpire, so Im sure he will recover, 

 Richardson said.

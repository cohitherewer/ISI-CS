 El Tri look to rewrite history 

Along with the US, Mexico remain head and shoulders above the rest of the Concacaf nations. Testimony of this was the straightforward manner in which Ricardo Lavolpes side sealed their place in Germany. A surprising draw in Panama and the now customary reverse in the US were the only two blemishes for El Tricolor on their relentless march to Germany. 

Mexico got the final leg of their qualifying campaign off to a great start with a vital win over Costa Rica in San Jose on February 9, 2005. Two goals from midfielder Jaime Lozano inside the opening 15 minutes put them on the road to a 2-1 win. Three points became six two months later after Lavolpes charges got the better of the visiting USA side at the Azteca Stadium in another 2-1 victory. 

After defeating their two main rivals in their first couple of games, Mexico were in no mood to lose to the lesser lights. A 1-1 draw in Panama was followed by a comfortable 2-0 success in Guatemala, a sequence of results that gave them an outright lead in the six-team group. Subsequent victories over Trinidad and Tobago and Costa Rica (both 2-0) left Mexico just a point away from assuring their presence in Germany. 

The US then put the Aztec party on hold by handing them their first defeat of the qualifiers, 0-2 in Columbus, but El Tri made no mistake at the second time of asking with a resounding five-goal rout of Panama on home soil. Mexico then wound up their qualifying campaign with another display of attacking might, a 5-2 win over Guatemala, before going down 2-1 to Trinidad and Tobago with a much-changed side in their final game. 

 Lavolpe and his men now know that the chance to make 

 history beckons. If they can maintain the form they have 

 shown over the past few months and take their chances, El 

 Tri have every chance of making it to the quarter-finals 

 of the FIFA World Cup for the first time on foreign soil.

 High hopes for crowd-pleasing 

 Portugal 

If their performance in qualifying is anything to go by then Portugal must rank as credible contenders at the World Cup finals. Luiz Felipe Scolaris side won nine of their 12 matches, finishing seven points clear of their closest rivals Slovakia, and scoring more goals than any other team in Europe. 

If the statistic of 35 goals scored and just five conceded was impressive, then so too was the contribution of striker Pauleta whose eleven goals not only put him at the top of the continental scorers chart but also took him past the legendary Eusebios record of 41 for his country. 

Germany 2006 will be the fourth finals campaign and Portuguese fans are still waiting for their side to match the exploits of Eusebio and company on their debut appearance in 1966, where they reached the semi-finals in England. The emergence in the early 90s of a golden generation of players led by Luis Figo and Rui Costa raised hopes. 

The talismanic Figo is back in the squad, returning 12 months after withdrawing from international football in July 2004, but arguably a greater threat to opponents these days comes from the quick feet of another winger, Cristiano Ronaldo. Midfielder Deco is another player with plenty of tricks while in attack Pauletas record speaks for itself. Portugal also have quality in a defence led by the excellent Ricardo Carvalho.

 Iran bounce back in style 

 Iran will step back into the limelight at Germany 

 2006 having bounced back from the disappointment of failing 

 to qualify for the first Asian finals in 2002. They did 

 not have things all their own way in qualifying, however, 

 suffering a 0-1 home defeat by Jordan in June 2004 that 

 threatened their progress through the preliminary round. 

 However, Branko Ivankovics men found their form in 

 that summers AFC Asian Cup ? where they edged out 

 Korea Republic 4-3 in a memorable quarter final to reach 

 the last four ? and with confidence levels restored, they 

 dominated the return match with Jordan to earn a crucial 

 2-0 win. Although the veteran Ali Daei finished as the nine-goal 

 top scorer in Asian qualifying, Team Melli will travel to 

 Germany with a rejuvenated squad. The current team is widely 

 considered the best in Iranian football history with plenty 

 of young talent alongside the heavyweight trio of reigning 

 AFC Player of the Year Ali Karimi, midfield dynamo Mehdi 

 Mahdavika and Hashemian.

 World Cup debut 

 Football shows another side 

 of Angola 

At their sixth attempt, Angola have finally succeeded in qualifying for a World Cup finals. Having first lined up to compete for a place at footballs global gathering on a July night in 1984 ? in the preliminary competition for Mexico 86 ? the Angolan national teams longing has finally been satisfied after 21 years. 

Drawn in group IV of the African Zone, Angola narrowly succeeded in snatching the sole ticket from beneath the noses of the all-powerful Nigerians. What is more, the manner in which Professor Luis Oliveira Goncalves charges negotiated their path to Germany was marked by great team spirit and resilience. The Angolan campaign got off to an inauspicious start, to say the least. Forced to contest a preliminary match with minnows Chad, they suffered a shock 1-3 defeat in the first leg in November 2003, the aftermath of which saw their Brazilian coach Ismael Kurtz dismissed. 

In the return game, their captain Akwa led Angola to a 2-0 victory under the stewardship of new coach Goncalves, who had been drafted in to salvage their campaign. Courtesy of this win, Angola went through to the group stage, but the luck of the draw placed them in group IV alongside Nigeria ?favourites to qualify ? as well as Algeria, Gabon, Zimbabwe and Rwanda.

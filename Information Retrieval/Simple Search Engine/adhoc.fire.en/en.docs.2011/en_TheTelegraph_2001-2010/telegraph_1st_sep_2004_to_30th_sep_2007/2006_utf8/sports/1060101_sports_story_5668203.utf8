 Schumi confident of 2006 fightback

 Schumacher 

Paris: Deposed Formula One world champion Michael Schumacher believes Ferrari, helped by more technical changes, will return to action in 2006 with their confidence high. 

The seven-time champion, who was outclassed by Renaults Fernando Alonso and Kimi Raikkonen of McLaren last season, has been buoyed both by December testing in Jerez as well as engine regulation changes and new tyre rules for 2006. 

The best moments on a F1 track for me in a long time were the tests at Jerez just before Christmas ? at last I was able to feel content when I got out of the car afterwards, he said. During the past season, and especially the last few races, that wasnt the case, as everyone knows. Our taking third place in the drivers as well as the constructors championship was a miracle. 

Schumacher is not prepared to start making predictions, especially after he finished 71 points behind champion Alonso. 

Its not looking too bad, there are many things pointing in a good direction. I was quite satisfied during testing at Jerez, even though it is too soon to predict anything, because the configuration of the cars was not comparable, Schumacher told his website. 

But the two most important new rules for next season shouldnt put us at a disadvantage. The transition to the V8-engine seems to have worked well for us, the last tests were looking good.

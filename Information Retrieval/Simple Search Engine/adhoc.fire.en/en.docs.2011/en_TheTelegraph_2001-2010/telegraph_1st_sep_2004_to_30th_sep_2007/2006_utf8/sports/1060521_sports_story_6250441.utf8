 Owen: Pressure doesnt affect me

London: England will head for the World Cup knowing that supporting Michael Owen and striking at opponents from deep will be the key to success without Wayne Rooney. 

As coach Sven-Goran Eriksson sweats on next Thursdays scan on Rooneys broken foot, few expect the striker to recover in time for the group stages in Germany ? if he makes the finals at all. 

The 20-year-olds injury will clearly place an extra weight on Owens shoulders as England look to come through Group B games against Paraguay, Trinidad and Tobago and Sweden. 

Fortunately for Eriksson, Owens track record shows that pressure does not faze a 26-year-old who is now looking forward to his third World Cup. 

It doesnt really affect the way I play, Owen said. 

There are massive games every week let alone a Champions League final like Arsenal were playing in. Pressure comes with life. 

I never get so excited that I cant think and I never get too low. Im able to keep a middle ground on a lot of things. 

From breaking records as a schoolboy to rattling up 35 goals in 75 England games, the Newcastle United striker has no reason to doubt his ability despite a long-term injury. 

The first time I ever played in the World Cup I scored, the first time I played in a football match I scored, the first time I played for Liverpool I scored, Owen said. (REUTERS)

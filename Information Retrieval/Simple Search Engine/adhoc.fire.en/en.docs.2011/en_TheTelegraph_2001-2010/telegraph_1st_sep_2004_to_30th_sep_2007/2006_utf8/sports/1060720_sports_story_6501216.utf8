 Warning for ACA

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Guwahati: The Assam Cricket Association (ACA) disclosed on Wednesday that Guwahati has not been penalised for the crowd violence that rocked the April 9 India-England one-dayer at the Nehru Stadium here. However, they have received a warning. 

Disclosing that the International Cricket Council (ICC) and Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) were convinced with the reply furnished by the ACA, its secretary Bikash Baruah claimed that the threat of losing ODI status was no longer there and the ACA was expecting another one-dayer by the end of next year. 

Baruah, however, admitted that the ACA has been cautioned that no more leniency would be shown if there is a repeat. 

The BCCI, on behalf of the ICC, has also advised us on certain measures to be taken to avoid such incidents in the future. We are going to act upon them soon, the ACA Secretary added. 

The advice included improved security measures, widening of entrances to the galleries and improvement of the presidents box, pavilion and the media gallery. 

Since the Nehru Stadium here does not belong to us, we will have to move to Dispur for the improvements which we are going to do at the earliest so that we can host a match by the end of 2007 in compliance with all the instructions, Baruah added.

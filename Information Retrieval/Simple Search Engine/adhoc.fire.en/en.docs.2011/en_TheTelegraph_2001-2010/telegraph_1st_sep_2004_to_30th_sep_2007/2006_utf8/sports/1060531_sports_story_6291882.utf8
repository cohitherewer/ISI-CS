The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Play straight when facing incoming 

 deliveries

 - Attack a batsman to get him out 

 of his comfort zone

 Cricket Online

 Ravi Shastri

 I am a mediumpacer. How can 

 I get a batsman out when he is on the defensive? What line 

 should I bowl?

 Sayantan Adhikary, 

 Calcutta-74 

 The best way would be to attack 

 and make him get out of his comfort zone.

 I am an off-spinner. Whenever 

 I try to bowl a flighted delivery, it ends up being a full 

 toss. Please help. 

 Pranjol Dutta, 16,

 Assam

 Vary your flight or bowl from 

 one step back and see if it works.

 How can one concentrate better 

 when batting? 

 Shreyas Grover, 15,

 Calcutta-34

 Keep things simple and put in 

 a lot of time for preparation. Then you are thinking in 

 the right fashion.

 I am a top-order batsman. I 

 am often adjudged leg-before when playing across the line 

 to incoming deliveries. Why does this happen? 

 Md Badruz Zaman, 19,

 Guwahati-38

 Look to play straight and dont 

 fall over.

 I am a right-arm mediumpacer. 

 What are the essentials for the inswinger and outswinger?

 Ayan Mukherjee, 14,

 Calcutta-40

 Work with your coach on the right 

 grip. Also have a firm wrist at the time of delivery.

 I am a right-handed batsman 

 and take a leg stump guard. Is shuffling necessary to tackle 

 fast bowlers? 

 Shayan Das, 17,

 Guwahati

 It gives you extra time and also 

 helps get you in line.

 I am a right-handed batsman 

 with a high backlift which leads to problems in tackling 

 shortpitched deliveries. Please help.

 Tapanjyoti Rudra, 19,

 Calcutta

 Adjust your backlift so that you 

 have ample time to counter short deliveries.

 I am a right-handed batsman. 

 Is it wise to take guard outside the leg stump when facing 

 leg-spinners? 

 Arko Saha, 17,

 Calcutta-42

 I dont think so.

 I am a right-handed batsman. 

 I often get bowled or caught at backward short-leg when 

 trying to play a leg-spinner. Please help. 

 Roktim Datta, 16,

 Calcutta

 Play close to the body. Also dont 

 get too far across.

 My 13-year-old son has just 

 started playing. Should he start with a light or heavy bat? 

 Debashree Mahato, 41, 

 Bhubaneswar

 A light bat is definitely a better 

 option.

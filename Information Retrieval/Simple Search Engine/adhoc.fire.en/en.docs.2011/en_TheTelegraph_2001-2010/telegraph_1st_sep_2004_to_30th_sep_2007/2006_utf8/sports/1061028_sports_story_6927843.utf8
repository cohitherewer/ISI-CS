The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Watson feared 

 heart attack 

 sharp focus

 Calcutta: 

 Australian allrounder Shane Watson feared he had had a heart 

 attack when he was taken to the hospital with severe chest 

 pains in Chandigarh on Tuesday, says A Staff Reporter.

 According to an Australian newspaper, 

 scary thoughts about Watsons former Tasmania teammate 

 Scott Mason dying of a heart attack and his fathers 

 triple bypass surgery went through his mind when he was 

 being taken for treatment. Wed 

 had a team meeting and I went back to bed for an hour or 

 so before we were leaving to go to training. I just started 

 to get really bad pains in my chest and it gradually got 

 worse and worse, Watson was quoted as saying by the 

 newspaper.

 Pathan is no Kapil: Wadekar 

 Mumbai: The Indian team 

 managements continued insistence in promoting Irfan 

 Pathan to No. 3 spot in the batting order has drawn flak 

 from Ajit Wadekar. Its stupid to send Pathan 

 at No. 3. They think hes Kapil Dev, but hes 

 not even half as good .

 Buchanan: India look on 

 edge

 Chandigarh: Seeking to 

 gain psychological points ahead of the crucial tie against 

 India, Australia coach John Buchanan has said the home teams 

 show in the Champions Trophy lacked the usual spark they 

 are known for. I thought they were a team playing 

 on edge a bit.

 Croatia stay on course

Duesseldorf: Croatia stayed on course to reach the World Team Cup final despite Ivan Ljubicic slumping to a 2-6, 2-6 defeat by Spains David Ferrer on Wednesday. After struggling to beat American James Blake in his opening match of the round-robin competition, the world No. 4s fortunes did not improve against Ferrer. 

Croatia levelled the tie at 1-1 when Mario Ancic edged past Feliciano Lopez 7-5, 4-6, 6-4. Ljubicic made amends in the doubles when he and Ivo Karlovic Croatia defeated Lopez and Fernando Verdasco 6-3, 7-6 to win the tie 2-1. (Reuters)

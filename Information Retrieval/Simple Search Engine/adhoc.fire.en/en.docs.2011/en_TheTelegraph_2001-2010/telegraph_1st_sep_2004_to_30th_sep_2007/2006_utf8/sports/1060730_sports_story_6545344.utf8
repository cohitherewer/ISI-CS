The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Dravid all praise for new methods 

 Conditioning Camp

 Dravid in Bangalore 

 on Saturday 

 Bangalore: Defending their 

 unusual camp on the outskirts of Bangalore, a move which 

 drew flak from former captain Sunil Gavaskar, Team India 

 captain Rahul Dravid on Saturday said the novel training 

 methods may not fetch immediate dividends but would be beneficial 

 in the long run.

 Dravid said the camp, aimed at 

 increasing the bond between players, gave them some new 

 experiences to think about.

 Every camp has some short-term 

 goals. There are also a few long-term motives. This one 

 provided new experiences for people and tried to get something 

 out of their personalities, Dravid told reporters 

 on Saturday, a day after the teams return from the 

 Pegasus Centre of Excellence.

 The players underwent a rigorous 

 three-day training schedule at the institute, which specialises 

 in outward-bound learning techniques, aimed 

 at increasing the tolerance levels in a fun-filled environment.

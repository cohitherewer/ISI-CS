 Boot camp is garbage, says Neil Harvey

 Sydney: A pre-Ashes boot camp at which Australias top cricketers underwent commando training in a Queensland forest was absolute garbage, Test great Neil Harvey said on Friday. 

Can you imagine (Don) Bradman or (Keith) Miller, or (Ray) Lindwall, or any of those blokes going on one of those, Harvey said, referring to some of his more noteable former Australian teammates. Theyd just laugh in your face and say see you later. 

 I think its a lot 

 of absolute garbage. I suppose youve got to blame 

 the coach (John Buchanan) for that. Maybe thats all 

 he can do, I dont know. (AP)

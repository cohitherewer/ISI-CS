 Jubilant Sporting Union players after beating Kalighat at the Eden on Thursday 

Calcutta: An allround performance by captain Ajay Verma helped Sporting Union lift the A.N. Ghosh Trophy defeating Kalighat by 50 runs at the Eden on Thursday. 

This was Sportings second trophy this season, following their triumph in the CAB Senior Knockout meet. 

Sporting, following their six-run first innings lead, made 216 for eight in 40 overs in their second essay. In reply, Kalighat chasing 222, could only make 172 losing as many wickets in their full quota of overs. Manoj Tewari, after a brilliant 124 in the first innings, went on to make 84 in the second innings. This, however, couldnt save Kalighat. 

Sporting captain Verma led from front with a gutsy 46 and then picked up three wickets. He was well assisted by Alokendu Lahiri (39), Devang Gandhi (36) and Charanjit Singh who was unbeaten on 30. 

Kalighat kept on losing wickets at regular intervals and failed to put on a decent partnership. Beside Tewari, only Avik Chowdhury (16) and Anustup Majumdar (15) reached the double figure mark.

 Quick Takes

 Germany favourites, says Parreira

 Rio de Janeiro: Brazil 

 coach Carlos Alberto Parreira believes hosts Germany rather 

 than his own team are favourites to win the World Cup. I 

 think Germany and Italy are just as much favourites as we 

 are, he said in an interview with a Sao Paulo newspaper 

 on Thursday. In fact, I think Germany are bigger favourites. 

 Theyve played in seven finals, including three in 

 a row (1982, 1986 and 1990) and they have the fans on their 

 side.

 Parreira added his players had 

 to forget about their celebrity status and work hard if 

 they were to keep the trophy they won for a fifth time in 

 2002. Talent is not enough at a World Cup. We have 

 to have emotion, an amateur spirit, and play with our hearts.

 King refuses to give up

 London: England defender 

 Ledley King refuses to believe his World Cup dream is over 

 even though he will not play again this season for Tottenham. 

 The Spurs captain suffered a stress fracture to the fourth 

 metatarsal on his left foot in their 1-0 win over Everton 

 over the Easter weekend and is expected to be out of action 

 for a month. 

 He not given up on making the 

 England World Cup squad. I have been asked in the 

 past months about the World Cup and how devastating it would 

 be to get injured, but I wasnt thinking about anything 

 like that.

 England song hits airwaves

 London: Englands 

 official World Cup song, a laid-back, guitar-based anthem 

 with no guest vocals by any of the players, hit the airwaves 

 on Friday.

 World At Your Feet, by 

 Yorkshire-based indie band Embrace, was played on radio 

 stations for the first time. 

 Boost for Socceroos

 Sydney: Fox Sports has 

 agreed to an Aus $120 million deal to secure the rights 

 to broadcast soccer in Australia for the next seven years, 

 a Sydney paper reported on Friday. Football Federation Australia 

 is set to release details next week. The deal will be a 

 major boost for soccer in Australia just over a month before 

 the Socceroos make their first World Cup appearance in 32 

 years. 

 Xavi return

 Madrid: Barcelona and Spain 

 midfielder Xavi completed a full training session with the 

 squad on Friday, as he continued his return from a serious 

 knee injury. Xavi has been out of action for four months 

 and is battling to reach full fitness in time for the World 

 Cup finals in Germany, which begin in June.

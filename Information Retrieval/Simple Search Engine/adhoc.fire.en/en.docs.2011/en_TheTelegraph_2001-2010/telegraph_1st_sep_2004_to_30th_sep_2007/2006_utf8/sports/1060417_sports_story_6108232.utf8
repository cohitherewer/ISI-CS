 Dhoni No. 2 batsman, India up to third

Dubai: Indias 5-1 demolition of England has taken them to third place in the ICC one-day rankings while Mahendra Singh Dhonis excellent form propelled him to second spot among ODI batsmen. 

Indias stupendous run in the shorter version of the game, that has seen them win 17 of their last 22 matches, has resulted in their surpassing New Zealand and Pakistan on the charts. 

Rahul Dravids team is now just three points behind second-placed South Africa. Australia are leading with 13 points. 

This is Indias highest position since the rankings were launched in October 2002. 

Dhoni, who was fifth in the rankings before the England series, accumulated 177 runs at an average of 59 to gain three places on the charts and is now behind Australian captain Ricky Ponting. 

Yuvraj Singh (ninth), Dravid (11th) and Sachin Tendulkar (18th), who missed the series through injury, are the other Indians in the top 20. 

Irfan Pathan is fourth on the bowlers list behind Shaun Pollock, Glenn McGrath and Shane Bond. (PTI)

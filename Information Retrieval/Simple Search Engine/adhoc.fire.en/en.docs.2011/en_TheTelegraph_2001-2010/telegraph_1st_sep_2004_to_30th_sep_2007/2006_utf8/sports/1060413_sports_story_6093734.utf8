 Audition over, reviews due

 JERE LONGMAN

 Landon Donovan is among those who are assured of a place in the US squad 

Cary: In a soccer exhibition that served more as a final audition for the World Cup roster, the United States tied Jamaica 1-1 before8,093 at SAS Soccer Park on Tuesday night. The Americans struggled to finish scoring chances, but they also displayed the desperate energy that was to be expected of players on the roster bubble. 

Ben Olsen scored in the 25th minute and played solidly as a holding midfielder in a forceful attempt to try to wedge his way into a crowded American midfield. 

Chris Albright, recovered from a knee injury, purposefully joined the attack from his rotating spots at left and right back, defended skilfully and nearly scored twice off free kicks in his first appearance this year with the national team. 

Among those with spots already secure, the maturing captain and playmaker Landon Donovan displayed his speed, free-kick precision, feathery passing and wits. 

The brittle midfielder John Brien got 23 recuperative minutes of playing time as he tries to regain his form after a chronic string of hamstring and groin injuries. Arena called his performance encouraging. 

With the European-based Americans overseas with their clubs, Tuesdays American roster was composed of players based domestically in Major League Soccer. 

Even though the domestic players are not yet fully fit, their season only having begun, this was essentially the last chance to impress Arena, who said that, in his mind, two to five spots remain available for the final 23-man World Cup roster. 

Arena will name a preliminary pool of 35 players and choose his final roster on May 2. The United States open play in the World Cup against the Czech Republic on June 12.

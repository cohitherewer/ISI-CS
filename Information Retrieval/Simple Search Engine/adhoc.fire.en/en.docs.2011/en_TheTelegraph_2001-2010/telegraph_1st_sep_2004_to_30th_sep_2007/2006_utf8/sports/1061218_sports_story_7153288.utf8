The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Injury-hit Mahindra hope to take United SC in stride

 - FEDERATION CUP 

 Mohammedan Sporting face Vasco 

A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta: It will be a battle between the best and promising ones when defending champions Mahindra United take on city outfit Chirag United SC on the opening day of the 28th Peerless Federation Cup football tournament at the Salt lake Stadium on Monday. In another match on the opening day, Mohammedan Sporting will take on Vasco Sports Club, Goa. 

After winning the IFA Shield, beating Mohun Bagan 1-0 last Thursday, Mahindra United will no doubt be looking to bag full points against a side consisting of young and immature footballers who havent tasted much success till date. 

We have good quality players in the playing XI and on the bench as well, Mahindra coach Derrick Perreira boasted on Sunday. According to him, they have a few injury worries well. 

Mahesh Gawli, Shammugam Venkatesh, Sony Menezes, Appa Rao are all included in the list of injured. We will wait till the morning before taking a final decision, Perreira said. 

The Mahindra coach, however, had a thing or two to say about the scheduling of the matches. 

We didnt get enough time to regroup ourselves after having won the IFA Shield last week. But one thing that may perhaps excite him is the comeback of K. Ajayan, who missed the IFA Shield title clash on account of double booking. 

Chirag United coach Amal Dutta, as usual, blamed the organisers for bad scheduling. 

 If you see the fixtures of East Bengal and Mohun Bagan, you will understand how intentionally we have been pitted against one of the best teams in the country, Dutta said after the practice on Sunday. 

The veteran coach didnt seem very hopeful even about snatching a point against the IFA Shield champions. We will try our best and then see what happens tomorrow, was his reaction. 

If United SC want to make a mark, foreign recruit Francis will have to play a pivotal role on Monday. 

Perreira, on the other hand, wants to concentrate more on his sides strength rather than thinking of the opponents. 

We havent seen so much and so we will play to our strengths and try to start with a win, he said. 

Meanwhile, Goan outfit Vasco SC seem a unprepared lot under Shabbir Ali. 

Shabbir, who has just taken over, will have to look up to the senior pro Robert DSouza while Mohammedan Sporting are expected to put up their best to try and win the lung opener.

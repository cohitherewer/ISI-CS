 Korea look to bank on Togo woes

 - Player intervention brings back Pfister as coach 

Leverkusen: In 2002, Dutch coach Guus Hiddink steered unfashionable South Korea to the World Cup semi-finals. 

Four years on, compatriot Dick Advocaat will show in Koreas Group G opener against Togo in Frankfurt on Tuesday whether he is carving a similar work of art or a poor imitation. 

Emboldened by a passionate wave of home support, Korea became the first Asian side to reach the last four after eliminating soccer superpowers like Italy, Spain and Portugal. 

Only a highly organised and physically superior Germany side prevented them reaching the final. 

While there are doubts over their ability to achieve similar heroics on foreign shores, Korea say they will not be satisfied with anything less than a place in the second round. 

We are going to show that what we did four years ago was no fluke, said striker Seol Ki-hyeon. 

The pressure is more than it was four years ago. We hadnt won a single game in the World Cup before 2002 but then we reached the semi-finals. 

It wont be easy playing against Togo, Switzerland and France but we are ready to beat them. We are very confident. 

Togo have had more than their share of problems. 

They were woeful in the 2006 African Nations Cup and things deteriorated when the team arrived in Germany, coach Otto Pfister walking out because he felt a pay row among the squad meant he could not do his job properly. 

When I started to be manager of Togo, I was promised bonuses for the players would be cleared. That is still not the case so I decided to quit immediately, he said. 

However, after a surprise U-turn, on Monday Pfister agreed to return to take charge of the debutants for their first-ever World Cup match on Tuesday. 

The players intervened massively. I received a fax from the (Togolese Football Association) president and I will sit on the bench as coach of the team tomorrow, Pfister said by telephone. 

Pfister declined to comment whether he would coach the West African team during their other World Cup finals matches. 

Players have pressed their demands for 155,000 euros ($196,200) each to play in the World Cup plus 30,000 each per win and 15,000 per draw. 

Officials from a country with average per capita income well below $1,000 have said the demands are too high and negotiations are still underway. 

A source close to the teams sponsor Puma said Pfister was on a train to Frankfurt after players had convinced him to return. 

Assistant coach Kodjovi Mawuena had found himself quickly promoted to the top job on Saturday, a role that was not new to him, and talks to give German former Bundesliga coach Winfried Schaefer the job seemed to have stalled on Monday. 

Despite the upheaval in the Togo camp, the Koreans will have to stifle the attacking threat of Emmanuel Adebayor who was top scorer in African qualifying for the World Cup. 

We know he is their best player by far, said Koreas assistant coach Pim Verbeek, who was also Hiddinks right-hand man in 2002. 

But we have no plans to man-mark him. Thats not our style. 

Verbeek said the pay dispute could work in Togos favour, pushing the players to perform better. 

There are always two sides to this kind of story. On one hand you can say they are not training any more, they are not motivated, he said. 

On the other hand they may think they will try to show the whole world how good they are. 

Meanwhile in Lome, Togos media voiced shame over the teams demands for hefty bonus payments at the World Cup, with one newspaper branding the row a national disgrace. 

The Togolese have shown their defects to the whole world, a newspaper wrote, adding they were the only team to have marred the tournament with financial demands. 

Meanwhile in Berlin, Fifa confirmed that the roof will be closed at Frankfurts Waldstadion for Tuesdays group G match between South Korea and Togo. Despite temperatures well over 30 Celsius (90 Fahrenheit) across Germany, the roof will be shut to help eradicate distracting shadows from the roof which are spoiling television images for billions of viewers across the world. 

Fifas director of communications Markus Siegler confirmed at its regular briefing for journalists in Berlin that the Frankfurt stadium roof would be shut and that footballs governing body are also considering closing the roof of the Gelsenkirchen stadium.

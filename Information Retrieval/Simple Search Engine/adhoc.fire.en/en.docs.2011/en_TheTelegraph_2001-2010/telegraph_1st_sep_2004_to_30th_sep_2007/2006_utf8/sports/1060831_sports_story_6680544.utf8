The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Houghton likely to get Afonso as assistant 

 coach from today 

 - Indian Camp

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: Eight days after the national football camp began in Goa, chief coach Bob Houghton is likely to get a permanent assistant coach from Thursday as the Goa Football Association (GFA) is planning to release their under-21 team coach Maurice Afonso for national duty till September 7. 

Speaking to The Telegraph on Wednesday, GFA secretary Savio Messias said: We have received a letter from Afonsos employers Dempo, today, requesting us to release Afonso for the national team. We might release him on Thursday. 

The national team was without a permanent assistant coach since the camp began. Afonso, who was busy with the Goa under-21 team, was only working with the national team during his spare time as the AIFF did not make any effort in getting him released permanently. 

The problem of a physical trainer, however, is yet to be solved. 

Meanwhile, reacting to a report in these columns, AIFF general secretary Alberto Colaco has said that Houghton hasnt ever conveyed his unhappiness to him over the way the camp is being conducted. 

 The AIFF, Colaco said, is striving to give Mr Bob Houghton all the required support. However, the final choice of the support staff will depend on Mr Bob Houghton as they will be working directly under him.

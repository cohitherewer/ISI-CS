 Kapur third in Order of Merit

Kuala Lumpur: Shiv Kapur earned all round applause after a fine display to finish tied 12th at the star-studded Johnnie Walker Classic, which shot him to third place with a haul of $65,431 on the Asian Tour Order of Merit. 

His 12-under-par total earned him $35,336, which was a nice birthday gift after turning 24 on Sunday. Apart from a handy cheque his solid performance impressed the likes of Fred Couples and Robert Allenby. 

Two other Indians figuring in top-20 of the Order of Merit are Jeev Milkha Singh in ninth place with $41,601.91 and Amandeep Johl in 18th place with $19, 492.43. (PTI)

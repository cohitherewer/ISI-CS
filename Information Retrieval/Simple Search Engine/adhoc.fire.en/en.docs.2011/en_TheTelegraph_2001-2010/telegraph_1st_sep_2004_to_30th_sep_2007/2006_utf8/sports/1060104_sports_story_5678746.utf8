The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 We didnt have anything more to give each other, says Leander

 - Decision to split with Zimonjic was taken before we made Masters Cup final 

OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Leander Paes 

Chennai: On the face of it, Leander Paes decision to split with Nenad Zimonjic is baffling. 

After all, the Indo-Serbian partnership claimed two titles in 2005 and closed the year as the sixth best-pair on the ATP Doubles Race. Most importantly, they finished the season on a very strong note, making three finals in their last five events, including the Masters Cup in Shanghai. 

Not the most awesome record, but neither do those stats call for a drastic measure. Thats how you and me would look at things. Paes view is different, and, as he explained to The Telegraph, he had good reasons to dump Zimonjic and choose Martin Damm. 

Zimo and I had a very up-and-down year? we had some great weeks and many rubbish weeks. Of the 19 meets we played together, we did very well in five, decently in two Slams (French Open and Wimbledon quarter finals) but also had about a dozen first-round losses. Thats not the consistency I was hoping for. That told me it was time to move on, Paes explained. 

Paes and Zimonjic were a couple of points away from lifting the season-ending Masters Cup crown, which ultimately Frenchmen Fabice Santoro and Mikael Llodra on a third set tie-break. Would they have split even if they had managed to win the coveted title in Shanghai? 

The decision had been made much before the Masters Cup. See, I dont choose or discard a partner based on one match or one meet, I judge and assess him over a period of time? see if we are compatible, have each others trust and are comfortable travelling together for 25-30 weeks. I am a fairly good reader of human beings, said Paes, who has tried about a dozen partners since splitting with Mahesh Bhupathi. 

You learn from all your partners, you also pass on something to them. Zimo and I had our run, we didnt have anything more to give each other. He has got a very good partner in Santoro, they have a good chance of winning a couple of Slams. 

Point taken on the logic behind discarding Zimonjic. But whats the justification for joining forces with a 34-year-old, especially as Paes has always maintained that he would like to play with someone younger? 

At this stage, tennis for me is all about passion? I want to have different experiences before my times up. All these years, Ive worn the seniors hat. Now, Martin can play the elder brothers role, while I can be more creative. 

Hes a very solid player and a very good human being, Ive respected him a lot since our junior days. I do feel hes the right choice? Only time will tell whether Im right, said Paes. 

They have chalked out a schedule till end of March after which Paes and Damm will assess their partnership. Well know by then if we are good enough to continue for the rest of the year? if we arent, bad luck, we have to move go our different paths. 

Thats Leander Paes for you. Unambiguous in his thoughts and a ruthless pro.

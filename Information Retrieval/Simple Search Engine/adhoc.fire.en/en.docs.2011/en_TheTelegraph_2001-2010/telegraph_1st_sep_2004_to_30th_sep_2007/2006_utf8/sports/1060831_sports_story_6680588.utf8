Chennai: Discarded West Indian fast bowler Jermaine Lawson has predicted a Caribbean win in the upcoming tri-series, also involving India and Australia, in Malaysia. 

Lawson, here to work on his bowling action under former fast bowling great Dennis Lillee at the MRF pace academy, said the West Indian team was on the right path under Brian Lara. 

Under his captaincy, the team has been performing well and in fact, they will give a tough fight to both India and Australia, he told reporters after the days training. 

We are known to be competitive players and always giving hundred per cent to the teams cause. Our team has been on the high during the last two seasons. We should be winning the Cup in Kuala Lumpur, he maintained. 

About his training under Lillee, Lawson said: Dennis is the greatest bowler and teacher on fast bowling. I have learnt a lot from him on the first day today (Wednesday). I am happy about the facilities here. I like Chennai as this is the place I made my debut in October 2002. 

Lillee, on his part, said he did not find any problem with Lawsons action. Lillee said that Darrell Hair should get the backing of ICC as it is important for players to abide by the umpires decision. 

Lillee said: Hair should be backed by the authorities (ICC). This is all I have to say on the subject. 

Lawson said he was happy that young fast bowlers were performing well for India. (PTI)

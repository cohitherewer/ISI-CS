 Warne slams Waugh

London: Shane Warne has hit back at former captain Steve Waugh who claimed his team was too friendly with the English players during last years Ashes series. 

Warne said: It has not got anything to do with it. If we had batted a bit better then we would have done better. 

We have been pretty successful, apart from one series, and you can read too much into it. It is easy to sit back when you are not playing and say we should be doing this and should be doing that. There is no disgrace in getting beaten by a better side.

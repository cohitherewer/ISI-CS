Chittagong: Sri Lanka notched up a comfortable eight-wicket victory over Bangladesh on the fourth day of the first Test here on Friday. 

Sri Lanka, set a victory target of 163, notched up the remaining runs in the first session to take the lead in the two-match series. 

Overnight 25 without loss, Sri Lanka gained momentum with a 90-run stand between opener Michael Vandort (64 not out) and vice-captain Kumar Sangakkara (46) for the second wicket. 

The left-handed pair dominated the bowling during their 20-over association but it was skipper Mahela Jayawardenes brisk 25-ball knock of 26 that ensured that play did not go beyond lunch. 

Vandort and Jayawardene knocked up 51 runs off 8.1 overs in an unbroken third-wicket stand as Bangladesh captain Habibul Bashar made desperate bowling changes to try and curb the flow of runs. 

Vandort made up for his first-innings duck with a 105-ball innings during which he hit seven boundaries, while Jayawardene smashed five fours. Sangakkara, who had scored 69 in the first innings, struck five fours and one six before giving a return catch to left-arm spinner Enamul Haque. 

Sri Lanka were set a small target as Bangladesh capitulated in their second innings for just 181 on Thursday after conceding a first-innings lead of 19.

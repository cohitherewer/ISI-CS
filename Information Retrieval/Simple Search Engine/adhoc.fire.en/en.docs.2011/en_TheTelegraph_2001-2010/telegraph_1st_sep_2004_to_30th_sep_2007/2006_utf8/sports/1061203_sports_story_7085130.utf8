The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 My plans paid off, says Manoj Tewari 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Manoj Tewari believes playing according to a plan has paid dividends. The former India under-19 captain was unbeaten on 182 at close on Satur- day. 

It feels great, specially when it is on your home ground and with the seniors around. The plan was to bat through the day Its nice that Ive managed to do that. The others also chipped in with useful contributions. 

Having been promoted to No. 4 in the order meant a big challenge. I did my best and am happy that my efforts have been rewarded, he said. Manoj termed this as his best innings so far. I was never scared to play my shots That positive attitude also helped. 

He felt a healthy competition with Avishek Jhunjhunwala has always helped bring the best out of him. Avisheks success has always made me happy and vice versa, Manoj added. 

Avishek, too, was forthcoming on their success formula. 

 Weve played together since long and batting together always helps. I get along with him easily in the middle, and so, scoring becomes easier. We both are quick, and it helps in running between the wickets, he explained. 

Avishek, who scored 114, has come good after falling in the 30s and 40s in the last few matches. 

I knew my time would come. I waited for the opportunity and Im back among runs. There was no pressure I knew I had to stick around. 

Deep said it was a team decision to promote Manoj. 

Rohan had been padded for two sessions and wasnt feeling well. So we decided to send Manoj But this can always change depending on the situation. Manoj, though, has done a tremendous job. This is what team spirit is all about. 

On his slowing down on approaching his century, Avishek said: It wasnt about being cautious. It was just that they were bowling well today. I wasnt willing to take any chances.

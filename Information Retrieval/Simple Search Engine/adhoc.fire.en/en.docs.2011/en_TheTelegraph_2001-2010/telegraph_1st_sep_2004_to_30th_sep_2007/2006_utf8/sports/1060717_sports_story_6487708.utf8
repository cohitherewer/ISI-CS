 Germany pip China to title

Amstelveen: Fanny Rinne scored in the last minute as Germany beat China 3-2 in the final of the Champions Trophy hockey tournament on Sunday. 

Rinne also scored an earlier goal and had an assist. 

Rinnes last-minute drag-flick clipped the inside of the post, leaving China goalkeeper Pan Feng Zhen helpless. It was Germanys first title at the six-nation meet.

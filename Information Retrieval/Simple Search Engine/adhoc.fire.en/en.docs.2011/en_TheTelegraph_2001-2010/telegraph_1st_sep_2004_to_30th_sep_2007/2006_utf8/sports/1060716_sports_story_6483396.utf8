 None after Sania, says Bhupathi

 - It's a one woman show

New Delhi: Indian womens tennis is a one woman show and the country is far from producing another genuine world beater, says multiple Grand Slam champion Mahesh Bhupathi. 

To be honest, there is nobody else. The names we talk about, they dont have what it takes to reach that level, Bhupathi said. 

Bhupathi was here for the launch of Mahesh Bhupathi Tennis Academys (MBTAs) new centre in Gurgaon. 

Meanwhile, Sania Mirza will join four top 25 players and a host of other stars in the field for the Cincinnati Open beginning on Monday.

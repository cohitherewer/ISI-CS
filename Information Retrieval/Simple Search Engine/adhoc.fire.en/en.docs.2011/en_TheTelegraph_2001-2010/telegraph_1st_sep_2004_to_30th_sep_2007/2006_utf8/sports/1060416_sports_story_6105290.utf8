 Sreesanth, Uthappa ensure 5-1 scoreline

 Paul Collingwood in Indore on Saturday 

Indore: A sparkling 86 by debutant Robin Uthappa and a six-wicket haul by Man-of-the-Match Sreesanth guided India to a seven-wicket victory over England in the seventh and final ODI on Saturday. 

The final scoreline thus read 5-1 in favour of the hosts. The fifth match, in Guwahati, was abandoned without a ball being bowled. 

Having beaten Sri Lanka 6-1, split honours (2-2) with South Africa at home before routing Pakistan 4-1 in their den, the Indians have now won 17 of their last 22 ODIs. 

Uthappa, a 20-year-old opener, hit 12 boundaries and a six as India chased down a challenging target of 289. 

He shared a 166-run opening wicket stand with skipper Rahul Dravid, who made a controlled 69 for his 70th ODI fifty. 

England had posted 288 after a commanding 64 by Kevin Pietersen and supporting half-centuries by Paul Collingwood (64) and Geraint Jones (53) after the touring side was put into bat. Sreesanth took six for 55 ? the fourth-best ODI figures by an Indian. 

Once Uthappa and Dravid departed at the same score (166), Man-of-the-Series Yuvraj Singh (63 not out) and Suresh Raina (53) took charge to ensure that the solid foundation wasnt wasted. The two southpaws put on 115 for the third wicket before Raina left eight runs short of the target. 

Raina, who scored his third half-century, was bowled while giving the charge to Kabir Ali. 

Yuvraj, who recorded his 23rd fifty, clinched Indias victory with five balls to spare. He hit six fours and crossed the 4,000-run mark in ODIs. 

Uthappa began confidently and chose paceman James Anderson for special treatment, pulling him for six and hitting two fours in the same over. Dravid was content to play second fiddle, driving and cutting his way to nine boundaries. 

In the England innings, Sreesanth struck twice early before Pietersen, who hit 11 fours and a six in a fine display of power and timing, triggered a recovery. 

Sreesanth added the wickets of Jones, Blackwell (11), Liam Plunkett (6) and Sajid Mahmood (9) to those of captain Andrew Strauss (25) and Matthew Prior (2) for his maiden five-wicket haul. 

 Strauss theory 

Strauss blamed his batsmen for the 1-5 series loss and appreciated the efforts of the young seamers in testing conditions, picking James Anderson and Liam Plunkett for special praise. 

None of our batsmen could score a century (in the seven-match series) which is the main reason for our loss, Strauss said. 

We lost wickets at regular intervals and at crucial stages. We have learnt a lesson and we will try not to repeat our mistakes.

 I am a mediumpacer. I cannot 

 swing the ball at my normal pace. Why does this happen? 

 (Akhtar Hussain, 16, Jamshedpur) 

 Check your grip and wrist action 

 at time of delivery. Work with your coach on your action 

 as well at time of delivery.

 I am a mediumpacer. Please 

 suggest a diet that I can follow on the day of a match. 

 (Tapan Mukherjee, 19, Calcutta-42) 

 Eat well and healthy. Dont 

 stuff yourself too much or else you will feel lethargic.

 I am an allrounder. I have 

 been doing a lot of running and gym during the off season. 

 Is it okay? 

 (Rajeeb Dutta, 24, Calcutta-45) 

 Thats always good. It will 

 build your endurance and stamina and make you more determined 

 and focused.

 I often hit the ball into 

 the air when trying to drive overpitched deliveries. Please 

 help. 

 (Manish Dutta, 18, Guwahati) 

 Keep your head down when you make 

 contact and ensure that your foot is close to the pitch 

 of the ball.

 I am an allrounder. But 

 after every off-season, I struggle to get back to my rhythm. 

 Why does this happen? 

 (Arnab Bhattacharjee, 22, Calcutta) 

 It does take a while. Start your 

 preparation for the season a little earlier the next time 

 around.

 I am a left-handed batsman. 

 Often while offering a defensive shot to a left-arm spinner 

 I get caught at silly point. Why does this happen? 

 (Raktim Roy, 19) 

 Make sure your bat is in front 

 of the pad when you defend for starters. 

 I am a right-handed batsman. 

 I often lose my balance and am hit wicket when attempting 

 the hook. Please advise. 

 (Piyush Ganguly, 17, Calcutta) 

 Use the depth of the crease when 

 you go back and across. Also pick up the line and length 

 early so that you have enough time to play the shot.

 How does one improve slip 

 catching? Will only practice help? 

 (Ram Gupta, 18, Jamshedpur) 

 Thats the best way and also 

 work with your coach on the right technique which allows 

 you to receive the ball with soft hands and not grab at 

 it. 

 I am a wicketkeeper and 

 weak on the leg side. I always try and follow the ball coming 

 out of the bowlers hand but the collection problem 

 on the leg side persists. How can I improve? 

 (Suman Basu, Calcutta-16) 

 Work on your footwork when moving 

 sideways. That should help. 

 Is running and skipping 

 good enough to improve footwork? 

 (Rohan Roy, Calcutta) 

 Very good. I always skipped a 

 bit before I went out to bat. You can do it as well.

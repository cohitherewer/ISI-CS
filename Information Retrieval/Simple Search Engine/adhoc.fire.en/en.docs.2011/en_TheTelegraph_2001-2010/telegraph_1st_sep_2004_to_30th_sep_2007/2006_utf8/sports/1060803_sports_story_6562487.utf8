 Manavjit asks govt to take game to grassroots

 - Recent results say shooting is countrys No. 1 sport 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: Trap shooter Manavjit Singh on Wednesday called upon the government to help popularise the game in the country, especially now that the shooters were having so much success at the international level. 

Speaking to The Telegraph after his arrival from Zagreb where he bagged the World Championship gold, the Delhi based shooter echoed the sentiments of Abhinav Bindra, who, too, clinched a gold at the same meet. 

Yes, shooting has now become the number one sport in the country, the results in recent years speak for itself, Manavjit said. Now it is time for the government to understand the situation and take the game to the grassroot level. 

On his part, Manavjit said, he can only perform better and better to make the game more glamorous and acceptable among common people. 

Let me make one thing very clear. My job is not to try and make shooting more popular. It is the job of the government. Good performances could be the only additional inputs from me. 

The ace shooter, who has finally been rewarded with the top honours after 12 years of hard work, conceded that shooting is still an expensive sport in the country. In India, shooting equipment and ammunitions are very expensive since almost everything is imported. The government can help in building indigenous industry of shooting equipment. 

Manavjit said his only regret is that the game is too much Delhi-based. The facilities one receives here are not available anywhere else in India. Both the government and the national association should chalk out a programme to spread shooting at the district level also. 

After arriving at the wee hours on Wednesday, Manavjit had a hectic day. 

While his mobile phone rang almost continuously, he was busy giving interviews to television channels and mediapersons throughout the day. 

I am not tired, he said smiling. Its an honour for shooting and I knew it was bound to come. I can vouch on behalf of all my teammates that more and more medals will come in the next couple of years. 

Manavjit was confident that Indias quota place in the next Olympics will be more than what it was last time. 

In Athens, we had eight quota places. In Beijing, I am sure, at least a dozen places will come to India. In fact, it is a conservative estimate. I am expecting a few more than this. But before that, we should be able to bag a handful of medals in the Asian Games at Doha.

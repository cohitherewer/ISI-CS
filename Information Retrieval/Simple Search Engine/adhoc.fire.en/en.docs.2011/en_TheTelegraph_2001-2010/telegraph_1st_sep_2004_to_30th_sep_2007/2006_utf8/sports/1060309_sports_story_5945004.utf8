 Shiv to lead Indian challenge

Singapore: Shiv Kapur will be looking to improve on his recent fine finishes when he competes in the Singapore Masters Golf at the Laguna National Golf and Country Club from Thursday. 

Kapur tied for a career-best seventh last week at the Indonesia Open and also had two other top-20 finishes in the previous two starts, a tied 12th at Johnnie Walker Classic and tied 18th at Malaysian Open. 

Currently placed 45th in the European Order of Merit, Kapur would be assured of a card next season with a top-115 finish. 

That is one of my aims, though a win is also one of my goals for 2006, said Kapur, now ranked 135th in the world, a steady improvement from a ranking in the 300s late last year. 

Other Indians in the fray in Singapore are Jyoti Randhawa, Jeev Milkha Singh, Gaurav Ghei, Rahil Gangjee, Harmeet Kahlon and Amandeep Johl.

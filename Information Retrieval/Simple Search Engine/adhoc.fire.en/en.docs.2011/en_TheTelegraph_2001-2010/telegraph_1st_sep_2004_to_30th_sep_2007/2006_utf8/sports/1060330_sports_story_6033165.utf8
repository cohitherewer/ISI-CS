 Eunice Barber alleges police brutality

Paris: A lawyer for French athlete Eunice Barber demanded an inquiry on Wednesday after a TV station aired amateur video footage of what appeared to be police abuse following her arrest for a driving offence. 

Emmanuel Daoud, a lawyer for the Sierra Leone-born athlete, said he was shocked by the images, broadcast by a French TV channel on Tuesday. 

Barber, a French citizen, who took heptathlon gold in the 1999 World Championships, was arrested on March 18 while driving near the Stade de France sports stadium in Paris. 

Earlier this week, Daoud said Barber intended to sue several police officers for brutality after the incident and had lodged a complaint with the police internal affairs department. 

The images broadcast showed Barber being pinned to the bonnet of her car by four police officers before being twice forced to the ground. She was then put into a police van. 

Daoud said the footage should form part of an investigation into the officers behaviour. 

Earlier this week, Barber said: I took a left turn while the officer indicated for me to turn right. But I didnt understand what he was wanting from me. He then banged on my car. I scrolled down the window and he slapped my face. I got out of the car and more officers showed up. 

She said two officers had stepped on her hands and head, and made racist remarks. 

Police said Barber had started a brawl and it was alleged that she bit officers who had arrested her. 

Barber, 31, was silver medallist in Paris in 2003 and in Helsinki last year in the heptathlon. She also clinched the long jump world crown three years ago and the bronze medal in 2005.

 Baroda land in city 

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: A 14-member Baroda squad landed in the city on Tuesday, for the upcoming Ranji Trophy Elite Group semi-final against Bengal. 

Coached by Balwinder Singh Sandhu, the visitors have the likes of captain Jacob Martin, opener Connor Williams and Yusuf Pathan ? brother of Irfan Pathan, whose allround performance was the feature of Barodas win over Hyderabad. 

We know Bengal are a tough side? besides they are playing at home, Sandhu said on Tuesday. 

Asked whether Sourav Gangulys absence would benefit his team, Sandhu maintained that Had he been here, we would have certainly reworked our strategy. But we are not too worried about whos playing and whos not? 

Meanwhile, Bengal have retained the squad which won against Railways in the last match, with right-hand bat Kamal Hasan Mondal (who can be also used as a part-time spinner) being added there as the 15th member.

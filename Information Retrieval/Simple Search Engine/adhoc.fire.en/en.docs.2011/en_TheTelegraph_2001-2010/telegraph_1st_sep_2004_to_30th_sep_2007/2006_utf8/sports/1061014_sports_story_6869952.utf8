The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 No special security for Pakistan

 - We keep learning and improving: SP Bansal 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Jaipur: The Shiv Sena has been making the usual noises, but the local police hasnt received any threat specific to the Younis Khan-led Pakistan. 

There has been no information from any quarter to suggest theres more of a threat to Pakistan... Therefore, the security detail for them is the same as for the other countries whore here for the Champions Trophy, informed SP Vishal Bansal, who heads one of the three divisions in the Rajasthan capital. 

The city is currently hosting five teams: India, Pakistan, England, Bangladesh and Zimbabwe. 

Speaking to The Telegraph on Friday afternoon, Bansal added: Of course, we keep learning and improving... Which is why you may find some difference from the time Jaipur last hosted a one-dayer (India versus Sri Lanka, a year ago)... 

Bansal, incidentally, is an alumnus of IIT, Kharagpur. 

The Pakistanis, by the way, are as cool as the SP. Gloveman Kamran Akmal, for example, didnt think twice about stepping out of the team hotel for dinner. Theres no problem and nobody is worried, he remarked grinning. 

Akmal, who got married a few days before the teams departure for India, said his wife (Aaiza) wouldnt be joining him during the tournament. It wouldve been nice for her to be here, but its not possible... Theyd been engaged for well over a year.

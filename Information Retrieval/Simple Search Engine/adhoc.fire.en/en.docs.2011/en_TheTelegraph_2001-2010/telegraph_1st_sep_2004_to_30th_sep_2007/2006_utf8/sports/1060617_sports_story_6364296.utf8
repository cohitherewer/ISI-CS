The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Of joy, woe and the predictable 

 - Checklist / The first seven days

JAYDEEP BASU

 Tim Cahill 

Those who expected many heads to roll in the first week of the World Cup, and the underdogs to send quite a few aristocrats of world football packing home were in for a disappointment. Unlike Cameroon in 1990 or Senegal in 2002, no smaller nation have so far managed to surprise the traditionally stronger sides and all the favourites are now almost assured of sailing into the second round. 

The following is a checklist of the highs and lows during the opening week of the Cup: 

 Team of the week: Trinidad and Tobago 

 The smallest nation to play in Germany 2006, Trinidad and Tobago, are facing an early exit, but not before emerging as the fairytale story of the finals. Once touted as the team incapable of playing at the top, Leo Beenhakkers side pulled off the first shock, holding Sweden goalless. On Thursday, they left England clueless till the 86th minute before going down 0-2. 

 Player of the week: Tim Cahill (Australia) 

 Having come at a time when Australia were facing a deflating defeat against Japan in sapping heat, Everton midfielder Tim Cahill shaped a stunning come-from-behind victory for the Socceroos. A complete newcomer in the World Cup, Cahill acted like a veteran when he fired home off a goalmouth scramble in the 84th minute . Four minutes later he was on the spot again . 

 Youngest performer of the week: Arjen Robben 

 Unlike his other celebrated collegues, Arjen Robben is a relatively new face in The Netherlands team. But against Serbia and Montenegro, he emerged the matchs most outstanding player. The striker looked dangerous whenever he touched the ball. 

 Save of the week: Artur Boruc 

 Poland goalkeeper Artur Boruc must be the most disappointed man after finding his team out even before the end of the first round. Against Germany in the crucial encounter, Boruc was at his best, saving a series of shots from Michael Ballack, Miroslav Klose and Lucas Podolski. Borucs best save, however, was the one in the second half when he was able to palm away a free kick from Klose that looked like going in for sure. 

 Goal of the week: Kaka 

 Brazil may have disappointed as a team, but not Kaka. Against Croatia in the first match, Kaka was the pick of the famed attacking quartet. His goal in the 44th minute was a treat to watch. 

 Coach of the week: Guus Hiddink 

 Trailing by a goal against Japan till the 84th minute, Australian coach Guus Hiddink further enhanced his reputation as one of the greatest modern-day coaches with the substitutions which altered the course of the match and gave Australia genuine hopes of progressing to the last 16. 

 Match of the week: Argentina vs Ivory Coast 

 Argentina were able to get the better of Ivory Coast, but it was the most entertaining match in the first round till date. While Javier Saviola gave the rival defence a torrid time, Didiar Drogba of Ivory Coast was at his attacking best with clever movements and intelligent display upfront. 

 Quote of the week: Serbia and Montenegro coach 

 Ilija Petkovic 

 Our country has become like the Nokia cellphones, it gets smaller and smaller quite frequently. Now that we are here in the World Cup, Serbia and Montenegro are actually two separate countries. But our bags are not packed yet, as we plan to stay in the World Cup. 

 Miss of the week: Peter Crouch against Trinidad 

 and Tobago 

 It was a miss that even a striker from the third division league would score at least eight out of ten times. A swift break from the defence saw the ball transferred to David Beckham, who picked out an unmarked Crouch in acres of space in the middle of the area. The six-feet seven-inches tall striker was unable to provide the finish. 

 Worst refereeing decision of the week: Mark Shield 

 in Tunisia vs Saudi Arabia tie 

 Australian referee Mark Shield did not do any justice to his reputation as one of the best in business when he turned a blind eye to a foul committed on Tunisia striker Zied Jaziri. Jaziri went down the right inside the six-yard box off an unfair challenge by defender Tukar, but the referee waved his hands indicating to play on. 

 Worst behaved fans of the week: Poland vs Germany 

 After six days of peaceful proceedings in the World Cup, police had to finally get into the act in the Germany versus Poland match. The match was off peacefully, but the fans outside fought a pitched battle against each other. Alert securitymen arrested 429 people on charges of instigating violence and rioting. 

 Disappointment of the week: Ronaldo 

 The undisputed hero of the last World Cup, Ronaldos performance came as a shock to his fans. He had one shot, off target in the 56th minute versus Croatia. Otherwise, he looked very ordinary. 

 Surprise package of the week: Ecuador 

 No one expected Ecuador to do much in the finals, but they made the second round. Led by highly talented striker Delgado, Ecuadar have so far scored five goals without conceding any. 

 Most memorable moment: The little Ghana fan who 

 cried after losing to Italy 

 After Italy scored the second goal, the television cameras focused on a little boy in the stands. With tears rolling down his cheeks, it perhaps made the most emotional and memorable moment of the World Cup. 

 Most glamorous moment: Pele with super model Claudia 

 Schiffer. 

 The pair carried the World Cup trophy into the stadium and on to the stage during the opening ceremony that paraded more than 100 former winners. 

 Match with maximum turnout 

 Sweden vs Paraguay (72,000). 

 Most yellow cards in a match: 6 (Australia vs Japan). 

 Total yellow cards: 81 

 Total red cards: 3

 Edfors champion, Shiv joint 60th

Loch Lomond (Scotland): Swede Johan Edfors, fired up by a third-round horror show, launched a spectacular run of birdies to win the Scottish Open with a closing eight-under-par 63 on Sunday. 

Indias Shiv Kapur finished tied 60 with a closing one-over-par 72, taking his total to 285. The Indian was tied 62 nd after the end of third round. 

Edfors became the first triple winner in Europe this season after finishing with a 13-under total of 271. 

Sharing second place on 273 in the last event in Europe before Thursdays British Open at Hoylake were Briton Luke Donald (66), Argentinas Andres Romero (69) and South African Charl Schwartzel (67). 

Overnight leaders Darren Clarke and Thomas Bjorn finished joint fifth after both carded 72s along with Benn Barham (70) and last years winner Tim Clark (69). 

Edfors, who started the round six shots off the pace, reeled off six birdies in a sizzling outward half of 30. He maintained his charge with a birdie hattrick from the 12th before dropping his only shot of the day at the 17th. 

I was very upset with myself after yesterdays 74, he told reporters after picking up a cheque for 400,000 pounds ($736,500).I went out and played rubbish, horrible. (REUTERS)

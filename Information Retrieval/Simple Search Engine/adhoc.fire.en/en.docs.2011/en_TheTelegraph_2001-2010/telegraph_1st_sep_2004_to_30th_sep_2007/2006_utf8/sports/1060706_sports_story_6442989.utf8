 Elite four in semi-final showdown

 - Wimbledon

 - Clijsters, Henin-Hardenne in 20th career face-off 

 Justine Henin-Hardenne 

London: The Wimbledon seeding committee got this one just right. The top four seeded players advanced to the womens semi-finals at Wimbledon: No. 1 Amelie Mauresmo, No. 2 Kim Clijsters, No. 3 Justine Henin-Hardenne and No. 4 Maria Sharapova. 

Its only the fifth time in 25 years that the semi-finals have featured the elite four. 

On Thursday, 2004 champion Sharapova will play Mauresmo, and Clijsters will face Henin-Hardenne in the 20th career match between the Belgian rivals. It just shows how long our careers have been already and how consistent we both have been, Clijsters said. 

 Maria Sharapova

Clijsters leads Henin-Hardenne 10-9, not counting Henin-Hardennes two victories in lower-tier events in 1998 and 1999. Henin-Hardenne has won three of the last four, including at the French Open and Eastbourne grass-court tournament last month. 

This will be their first meeting at Wimbledon. Henin-Hardenne leads 4-2 at other Grand Slams. It will be the third time in a month, so I think that we know each other well enough, Henin-Hardenne said. But never here in Wimbledon. I dont know what to expect about that. Im just going to try to keep the same preparation. 

Neither player has lost a set in five matches at this tournament. 

Clijsters beat Chinas Li Na, 6-4, 7-5 in the quarter finals Tuesday, while Henin-Hardenne downed French qualifier Severine Bremond, 6-4, 6-4. 

Now I really dont care whos standing in front of me, Clijsters said. Doesnt matter if Im playing Venus (Williams) or Justine or Lindsay (Davenport). Of course I know how Justine plays, but shes a really good player. Its a challenge that I look forward to. 

The Belgians ? Henin-Hardenne from the French-speaking Walloon region, Clijsters from Dutch-speaking Flanders ? have had a sometimes icy relationship, but insist they get along. 

Theres a lot of respect between each other, Henin-Hardenne said. My feeling toward her has never changed, Clijsters said. It has always been the same. Ive always been nice to her. 

Henin-Hardenne reached her first Grand Slam final here in 2001,. She has won the French Open three times since, and the US Open and Australian Open once each. If she wins Wimbledon, shell complete a career Grand Slam. Only nine women have accomplished the feat, including Serena Williams, Steffi Graf, Chris Evert, Billie Jean King and Martina Navratilova. 

As a kid, I wasnt dreaming about Wimbledon, I was dreaming of the French Open, Henin-Hardenne said. Now things are probably different because its a great challenge for me, Wimbledon. 

Henin-Hardenne has lost only 21 games in five matches and looks comfortable on the grass, which is bouncing higher than ever and giving baseliners more time to set up their shots. 

You have to be patient, Clijsters said. But you cant just hit it back into the court because thats when (Henin-Hardenne) steps it up and she really tries to go for her shots as well. You have to play aggressive tennis, try to take your chances. Thats what you try to do against every player. But against Justine, you have to expect every ball to come back. 

 Sharapova is the only former womens 

 champion left after the exit of Venus Williams an d Martina 

 Hingis. Mauresmo, who turns 27 on Wednesday, lost in the 

 semi-finals at her three previous Wimbledons.

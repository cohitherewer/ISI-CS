 Negi outwits French GM

 Surya Sekhar drew with Ivanov 

Moscow: International Master Abhijeet Gupta crashed through the defence of Grandmaster Sarunas Sulskis of Lithuania to improve his GM norm prospects along with Parimarjan Negi, who also won in the fourth round of the A2 group of the International Open chess tournament here. 

Double GM norm holder Negi, who outwitted GM Arnaud Hauchard of France, and Gupta took their tally to a very respectable 2.5 points from four games. 

In the main A1 section, Grandmaster Krishnan Sasikiran was easily held to a draw by Alexei Fedorov of Belarus. GM Sandipan Chanda continued with his impressive form to force a draw against former Russian champion Sergei Volkov. 

National champion Surya Sekhar Ganguly, however, struggled for the fourth successive day in the event before signing peace with GM Alexander Ivanov of US. 

The battle at the top took a decisive turn as just three players emerged leaders with 3.5 points each. Notable among them is Vladimir Akopian of Armenia. Both Sasikiran and Chanda are on 2.5 points while Ganguly is just one point from his four games. In A2, International Master Neelotpal Das came back into the reckoning with a thumping victory over Sergei Yudin of Russia. 

Playing white against Sulskis, Gupta was in his element in a Queens Indian defense game. The tactical melee started in the middle game itself, when Gupta came up with a spectacular pawn sacrifice which was immediately followed by an exchange sacrifice. Sulskis decided against going for a passive position and instead went for a rook and two minor pieces endgame wherein Gupta tightened the noose. 

Negi also played a fine game to beat Hauchard. It was a Sicilian Nazdorf in which Negi went for a sharp variation and obtained a slight advantage in the middle game. 

Hauchard overreached his position in the ensuing endgame where he thought he retained some winning chances and missed Negis plan that ensured a smooth victory in the end. (PTI)

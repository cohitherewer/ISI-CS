Victoria (British Columbia): Michael Phelps set a world record for the first time since 2004, lowering his own mark in the 200m butterfly at the Pan Pacific Championships. 

It was the second world record of the night program on Thursday, following soon after Australias Jessica Schipper lowered the mark in the womens 200m butterfly. 

 Phelps came from behind on the final lap to win in 1:53.80 seconds. His old mark of 1:53.93 came at the 2003 World Championships in Barcelona, a prelude to the Athens Olympics, where he won eight medals, including six golds. 

Phelps was under world record pace by 0.16 seconds after the opening 50m, but he fell off it as Ryuichi Shibata of Japan overtook him and led the next two laps. 

 Known for his finishing strength, Phelps roared back in the closing strokes to win by 2.02 seconds. This is probably the happiest Ive been with my swimming since Athens, he said. It was a pretty special moment for me. 

Shibata was second in 1:55.82 and Takeshi Matsuda of Japan was third in 1:56.20. 

Phelps had deliberately skipped the 200m freestyle earlier on Thursday to conserve his energy for the fly. It paid off with his first world record since winning the 400m individual medley in Athens. 

About 10 minutes before Phelps dived in, Schipper won the womens 200m fly in 2:05.40. 

That bettered the world mark of 2:05.61 set by Otylia Jedrzejczak of Poland at last years World Championships in Montreal. 

Yuko Nakanishi of Japan was second in 2:06.52, and teammate Yurie Yano was third. 

The United States and Japan were tied atop the medal standings with eight each after one night of competition. 

But the Americans won a leading five golds, capped by Kate Zieglers victory in the 1,500m freestyle. Her time of 15:55.01 bettered the championship mark of 16:04.84 set by Hayley Lewis of Australia in 1992. 

Hayley Peirsol, younger sister of 100m backstroke winner Aaron Peirsol, was second. 

 Japan had one gold, three silver and four bronze medals. Australia earned a gold, silver and bronze. 

The evenings only upset came in the 100 backstroke, with Hanae Ito of Japan beating world record-holder Natalie Coughlin of the United States. 

 Coughlin, the only woman to go under 1-minute in the event, led after 50m. But Ito and teammate Reiko Nakamura were bearing down on her, and the three women were almost evenly matched approaching the wall. 

Ito barely outtouched Coughlin to win in 1:00.63. Coughlin was timed in 1:00.66 and Nakamura finished third in 1:00.86. (AP)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Warne blames it on cricket

London: Shane Warne, the eternal bad boy of cricket, has blamed the game for ruining his personal life. The highest wicket-taker in the world says cricket had been very, very good to him but he has had to make a lot of sacrifices along the way. 

Spending so much time away from home puts enormous pressure on any relationship and means I have not seen as much of my family as a father with a normal job, he has written in his autobiography My Illustrated Career, excerpts of which were published in a British daily. 

Warnes marriage with model Simone ended in divorce last year following a string of sexual escapades involving the blonde bowler. To succeed in the game these days takes a lot of dedication. At the end of the day, I think the game has cost me a hell of a lot in my personal life, along with some poor choices by yours truly, he writes. 

Yes, I have done a few stupid things along the way, on and off the field. There are some people who think I am a bit of an idiot and, at times, I would have to admit theyve been right. But whether they love me or hate me, they are still interested in me and when you cut through everything else I think that is because of the way I play the game. 

Warne says he would try to make up to his children by spending a lot of time with them once he hangs his boots. 

I am looking forward to spending a lot of quality time with my kids when I do retire they are the joys of my life and my inspiration. I love them so much and cant wait to spend all my time with them, and enjoying watching them grow up and turn into young adults, and just being there for them. 

The book is due to be released on September 14.

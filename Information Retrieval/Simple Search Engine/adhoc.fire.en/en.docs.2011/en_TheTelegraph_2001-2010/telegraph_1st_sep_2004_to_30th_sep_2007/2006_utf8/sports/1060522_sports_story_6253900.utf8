The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Every defeat hurts, says Yuvraj

 - I got deceived by (Dwayne) Bravos pace... He bowled a very well disguised slower one

 Kingston: On the morning 

 after, Yuvraj Singh still couldnt believe hed 

 tripped at the proverbial last hurdle. 

 Seems unbelievable that 

 I managed to bring the team to within two runs of winning 

 and, then, got out... Every defeat hurts and yesterdays 

 will, too... In fact, whether you lose by one run or one 

 hundred, the records show a defeat, Yuvraj told The 

 Telegraph. 

Speaking at the Hilton on Sunday, before leaving for St Kitts, he added: I got deceived by (Dwayne) Bravos pace... He bowled a very well disguised slower one and... Its not easy bowling such balls at that stage, but Bravo did it for the West Indies... 

Yuvraj got out for 93, but the innings is going to be remembered for the manner in which he dropped anchor and tried to nurse the batsmen who followed. Unlike in Lahore or Karachi earlier this year, when he had the middle-orders support to finish the matches, he was left with the tail at Sabina Park. 

Not only did the tail not wag, barring Ramesh Powar (to an extent), everybody appeared in a hurry to call it a day. 

Yes, I didnt have the established batsmen for long... But youve got to remember they cant get runs in every match... Im sure they tried their best, but it wasnt to be... The wicket had, obviously, slowed down and the spinners (Chris Gayle, Marlon Samuels) didnt give boundary-balls... Also, (Brian) Lara made smart changes, Yuvraj said. 

What were his thoughts when he faced what became the second ODIs last ball? 

I was looking to hit it straight... A two would have been great, but a single would have ensured at least a tie and, after that, I would have asked Munaf (Patel) to put bat to ball and run like never before... Bravo didnt allow that, Yuvraj, who was even consoled by the on-field umpires (Billy Doctrove, Asad Rauf), replied. 

Having had a phenomenal 2005-06 season (top-scorer in ODIs with 1,353 runs, including five hundreds), expectations have risen. Yuvraj, though, isnt allowing any talk of pressure to sit on his head. 

I know people are seeing me as a matchwinner, but I can just do my best... I cant feel satisfied with yesterdays innings, but at least I got 90-plus on a wicket which wasnt at all a featherbed... Id disciplined myself... Id decided not to take chances till the very end, he said. 

 It doesnt surprise that Yuvraj is seen as a 

 long distance ka ghoda.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Within me, I know I deserve a place in ODIs, says Matthew Hayden

 - Im at my best when under pressure... I get excited when theres something to achieve... 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Matthew Hayden 

Kuala Lumpur: With an average of 53-plus in Tests (26 hundreds) and over 40 in ODIs (five hundreds), Matthew Hayden is one of the giants of the present era. While the openers first appearance for Australia was in 1993, he really came into his own on the 2000-01 tour of India. Barring a hiccup of sorts in 2004-05, he hasnt looked back since, though he rarely makes the one-day squad nowadays. Hayden spoke to The Telegraph on Friday night, soon after the fantastic win over India. The interview couldnt be lengthy as he was called for a team meeting (at the Kinrara Oval itself). Incidentally, despite top-scoring for his team in the semi-final, the 34-year-old has been overlooked for Sundays face-off against the West Indies as he wont be travelling to India for the Champions Trophy... 

The following are excerpts 

You must be pretty pleased with your ODI comeback 

after more than a year without a game? 

Look, I want to play one-day cricket and I think Im 

good enough to be playing the ODIs regularly... Getting opportunities here has 

been nice and Ive been able to give the selectors what Id promised 

 runs... 

Has it been tough adjusting to the times when you 

havent got picked for one-day cricket? 

(Grins)Its hard because, within me, I know I 

deserve a place... When I got dropped last year, the first thing I said was that 

Im not finished with ODIs... Ive worked hard on fitness and stamina 

and... Im still young enough to play one-day cricket. (After a pause) 

As only five (Ashes) Tests have been slotted over the next 12 months, if Im 

not playing ODIs, then I wont be playing for Australia after January... 

After years of consistency, you had a blip in Tests 

not too long ago... 

I kept it simple... I realised teams werent 

attacking me, rather they were happy keeping me out of the game... That, obviously, 

had a strange rhythm and momentum and I hadnt reacted quickly enough... 

It was frustrating and I had to address the situation as I wasnt getting 

enough runs... Things got rectified in the lead-up to The Oval Test last year, 

when I got a hundred versus Essex... Of course, I got a hundred in the Test as 

well... I got back into business, began developing my innings over a period of 

time and the bottomline changed. 

What are your emotions as you reflect on your career? 

Im very proud of what Ive achieved personally 

and the team collectively... Ive been playing with a great bunch of blokes 

whore going to be legends... We never give up and the match against India 

is a good example... We believe in ourselves and, as important, believe in each 

other. 

It seems this self-belief comes more naturally 

to Australians... 

Probably comes from great mateship... We communicate 

with each other, were honest to ourselves and with each other... Then, we 

set very high standards for ourselves on and off the field... Little things 

like picking up the litter in the dressing room... The high standards have helped 

us become better cricketers and better human beings. 

How do you handle the dual pressure personal 

and whats associated with playing for the No. 1 team? 

Actually, Im at my best when under pressure... 

I get excited when theres something to achieve... Pressure helps elevate 

my mindset to a position where I need to be... 

What are your thoughts about the 380 versus Zimbabwe 

and the fact that Brian Lara quickly reclaimed his world record via an unbeaten 

400 (against Eng-land)? 

Brians remarkable and hed set his mind 

on getting the record back... He achieved it... Once youre close to that 

many runs, you can get as many as you want... Im not disappointed my record 

didnt survive more than six months or so... October 10, 2003, will still 

be a very special day in my life and in the history of Australian cricket. Test 

records arent forgotten and its pleasing that, years after Ive 

retired, people are going to remember my 380. 

Over the years, youve forged a great partnership 

with Justin Langer. Whats the secret? 

Our friendship... We understand each other perfectly 

and, in my book, Justin is the worlds best opener in Tests... His record 

proves that. 

As youve been called for a team meeting, 

the last one: Your thoughts on the final? 

(Laughs)Were red hot favourites, but still need 

to play well...

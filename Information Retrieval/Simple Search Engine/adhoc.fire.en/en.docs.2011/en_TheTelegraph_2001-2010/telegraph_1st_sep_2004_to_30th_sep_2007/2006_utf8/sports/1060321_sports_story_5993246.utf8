 FA to probe pitch invasion

London: A pitch invasion by mindless individuals after Fulhams 1-0 Premier League win over Chelsea on Sunday is to be investigated by the Football Association. 

Fights broke out as rival sets of fans swarmed on to the pitch at Craven Cottage after the final whistle of the London derby, prompting a strongly-worded response from the FA on Monday. 

The FA condemns the behaviour of the mindless individuals who invaded the pitch post-match at Craven Cottage on Sunday, FA chief executive Brian Barwick said. 

We will be launching an investigation with immediate effect. Once identified, the FA would expect the fans concerned to face police charges.

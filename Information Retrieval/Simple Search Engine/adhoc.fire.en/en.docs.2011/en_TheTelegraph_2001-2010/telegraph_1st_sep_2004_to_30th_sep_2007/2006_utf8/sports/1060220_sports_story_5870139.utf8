The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Greg praise for youngsters 

As the curtain finally dropped on the battle between India and Pakistan, with the visitors winning the final match and wrapping up the series 4-1 in their favour, it seemed their coaches had the same objective in mind while analysing the tour. Though they summed up the series in general, their sights were actually set on the 2007 World Cup. 

 GREG CHAPPELL: Our spirits were always good. 

 We were disappointed after the loss in the Test series, 

 but we bounced back and hung in there during difficult conditions. 

 We were disappointed after the loss in Peshawar. We knew 

 if we played a competitive game we would be able to turn 

 things around. Rahul has led from the front. The young boys 

 who joined us in the one-dayers have reinvigorated all of 

 us with their youthful enthusiasm. The characters of these 

 boys are very strong and that was why they were chosen. 

 They are the future of Indian cricket. They need time. 

Our ground fielding was good. Sreesanth bowled well, Powar came in with a good spell. The batting in the end by the two young guns sealed the affair for us. Winning is a very good thing to practise at the moment. We will practice winning. However, things could have been different had the toss been different. We have kept a watch on the stock that we have. 

With so much of cricket, if you dont have a platoon of cricketers, you are bound to fall into trouble. That is why we gave them opportunities. The under-19 programme has been good for India. It is a good breeding ground. All these youngsters have come up from there. But first class cricket is more important and we have to take a closer look at that. 

 BOB WOOLMER: Its 

 worrying. I suppose we could look at the reasons ? we might 

 have bowled and fielded well in other conditions. Our bowling 

 and fielding was awful. The guys had tried hard. In fact, 

 they were almost trying too hard. These things happen when 

 you are under pressure. India outplayed us in every aspect. 

 They regrouped very well after the Test series. Yuvraj is 

 a good player. We need people who give their spirit into 

 the game. We are pleased that it happened now and not before 

 the World Cup. We need to rethink our strategies and improve 

 the basics. Flexibility and adaptability are needed. We 

 are short on thinking, fitness and fielding.

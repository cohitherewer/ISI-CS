 Jahangir made to feel at home

 - Legend spends time with Team India 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Jahangir Khan 

Karachi: The legendary Jahangir Khan, winner of six world and ten British Open squash titles, spent around 30 minutes in the Team India dressing room on Wednesday evening. He was invited, among others, by coach Greg Chappell. 

I was honoured to share my experience with the Indian boys... I was made to feel at home and amazed that so many knew so much about me, Jahangir, president of the World Squash Federation, told The Telegraph. 

Speaking in his trophy-lined office at the old PIA Jahangir Khan Squash Centre, which is being done-over by him to include other facilities, he added: I didnt talk about the Test which India lost, but did say that the past must be treated as something thats over... 

Jahangir said he was particularly touched when captain Rahul Dravid and some of the others offered condolences on the recent demise of his father, Roshan, seen by many as an institution. 

The training for squash players is quite different, but the Indians still wanted to know how Jahangir, now 42, kept himself fit during the years he was champion. The mental toughness bit also came up. 

I wasnt there to lecture, but emphasised that a proper focus is absolutely necessary... If the training is sincere and the goal clear, then success becomes much easier... Of course, the hunger should be there as well, he remarked. 

In the current lot, Jahangir admires Sachin Tendulkar. In the late Seventies, he was a big fan of Sunil Gavaskar.

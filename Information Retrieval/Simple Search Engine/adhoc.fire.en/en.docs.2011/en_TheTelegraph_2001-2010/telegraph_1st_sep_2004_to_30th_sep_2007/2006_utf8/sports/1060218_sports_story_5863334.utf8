The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Ardelis set to bag Million 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: There is no looking beyond Ardelis in the 1,600m Calcutta Million, the richest race for juveniles in the RCTC racing calendar and the main attraction in Saturdays card. The Razeen-Kolar Gold colt has done nothing wrong so far and his scoresheet reads two thumping wins in as many career starts. C.Alford partners the Vijay Singh-trained three-year-old. The Governors Cup, the sporting event, may see an in-form Star Phoenix winning.

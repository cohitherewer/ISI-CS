London: The crucial two-day disciplinary hearing of Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq began here on Wednesday behind closed doors at The Oval, the very scene of high drama following the ball-tampering charge being laid against his side. 

A verdict will be out not before 24 hours of the hearing coming to an end and till then the fate of the Pakistan captain will continue to hang in balance. 

The hearing will see Inzamam defend himself against the two charges laid by umpires Darrell Hair and Billy Doctrove relating to ball tampering and bringing the game into disrepute during the fourth Test against England at The Oval last month. 

The Pakistani side is fielding three expert witnesses Geoffrey Boycott, Simon Hughes and John Hamshire, a former Test cricketer turned umpire. 

Quoting a dressing room source, it said Inzamam came off the field indignant and apparently still uncertain why the ball had been changed. 

The refusal to take the field may not have been his idea but that of Waqar Younis, the touring teams bowling coach or one of the other senior figures in or around the dressing room at the time, it said. 

Meanwhile, in Karachi, Wasim Akram believes Inzamam will be lucky to get off with just a one- or two-match ban. 

The situation is a difficult one for Pakistan. No doubt about that. The ICC will obviously support its umpires. Their (Pakistans) failure to complete the Test match against England at The Oval has gone against them. I think if Inzamam is banned for just one or two matches he will be lucky..., he said. 

Akram also said India had done the right thing in asking the ICC not to appoint Hair for the Champions Trophy. They have made a sensible point and the ICC must consider it but it is also a big moral victory for Pakistan which has already made it clear it does not want Hair appointed.

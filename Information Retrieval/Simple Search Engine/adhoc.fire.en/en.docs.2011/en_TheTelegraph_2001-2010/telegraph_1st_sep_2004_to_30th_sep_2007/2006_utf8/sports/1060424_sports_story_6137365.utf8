 Jeev, Shiv finish tied 26th

Shanghai: Jeev Milkha Singh and Shiv Kapur produced their best golf of the week to finish tied 26th in the $1.8 million BMW Asian Open at the Tomson Pudong Shanghai Golf Club here on Sunday. 

But the day belonged to Gonzalo Fernandez-Castano who won a dramatic play-off to take his second title and a cheque of $300,000 to make his fortnight in China worth half a million. 

The Spanish golfer, the European Rookie of the Year in 2005, was second behind Jeev last week in Volvo China Open where he took $200,000. Jeev and Kapur took $16,290 each this week. 

While Kapur had five birdies and just one bogey in his four-under 68, Jeev had no bogeys, but he did call a penalty on himself for touching the water on his backswing while hitting out of the hazard on the ninth. 

He took five strokes, but put down a seven including a two-shot penalty, but for which he would have been under par for the week and inside top-20. 

But thats not the way I would like, said Jeev, who last week won his first title after seven years at the Volvo China Open in Beijing. No one noticed, but I knew I had touched the water on my backswing and I cannot keep quiet about that, so I took a seven on that. 

While Jeev had his dramatic moments on Sunday morning, Fernandez-Castano produced some scintillating golf in the closing stages and then won a play-off ahead of Swede Henrik Stenson, who had led the field for more than three and a half days only to lose in the end. (PTI)

Mason (Ohio): Sania Mirza and her Polish partner Marta Domachowska moved into the semi-finals of the $175,000 WTA Cincinnati Open after defeating Uzbekistans Varavara Lepchenko and Men Yuan of China in three sets. 

The third seeded Indo-Polish duo prevailed 6-4, 5-7, 7-6 (7-3) in an encounter that lasted nearly three hours. 

Serena Williams, returning to the circuit after a long lay-off, was impressive as she disposed of fellow-American Bethanie Mattek 6-3, 6-1 to move into the quarter finals. 

The seven-time Grand Slam winner needed just 63 minutes to dispose of the 105th-ranked American. In the last eight, she will take on compatriot Amy Frazier. 

Both players I have played so far have been really competitive and really tough, Serena told reporters. I feel like Im moving faster but I can still get quicker. I feel fine, Ive been doing a lot of off court work. 

Serena, who has not seen action since the third round of the Australian Open, got the match off to a sluggish start when Mattek broke her to go up 2-1. But she immediately broke then simply overwhelmed Mattek, winning 11 of the next 13 games. 

In other second-round action, fifth seed Jelena Jankovic of Serbia eased past Italys Maria Elena Camerin 6-4, 6-4, while sixth seeded Frenchwoman Marion Bartoli battled to a 6-2, 2-6, 6-3 win over Russias Vasilisa Bardina. 

Russias Vera Zvonareva thrashed Uzbekistans Varvara Lepchenko 6-0, 6-2 to book her spot in the quarters. 

Serena, meanwhile, will probably play at the US Open courtesy a wild card invitation, according to reports coming out of New York. 

She won the tournament in 1999 and 2002, and has entered the 2006 championship. But the USTA said on Thursday that she had not received direct acceptance into the main draw based on her current world ranking of 139. 

If necessary, the USTA will issue a wild card to Serena, a USTA statement said.

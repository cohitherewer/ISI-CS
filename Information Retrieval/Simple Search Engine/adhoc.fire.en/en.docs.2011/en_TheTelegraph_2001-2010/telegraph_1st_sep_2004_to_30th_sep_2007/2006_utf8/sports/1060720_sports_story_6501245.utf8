The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Grand Ceremony was brilliant 

 STAR RACER

 Jango played a spoilt sport, last Friday, the day was otherwise ruled by favourites. The victory of five fancied runners in the six-event card was, nevertheless, considered to be a good omen by most punters on Day I of the season. Punters could not have asked for more. 

 Jangos victory, however, brought a note of contentment for his trainer, Shafiq Khan, who has come to the city for a short stint from Delhi, his headquarter.

 It was a runaway victory for the four-year-old, in the Fair Ray Handicap, despite shifting out alarmingly in the final straight. The handicapper, though is expected to slap a heavy penalty on this victory, yet he may not be able to stop the horse from winning again.

 Shafiqs Asmi, in the curtain raiser, the Woolver Valley Handicap, was not so lucky. The Bees Prospector-Spicy filly found a good one in Robin Corners ward, Body And Soul, a half-money favourite. The Diffident-College Princess filly allowed Lightning Flash to dictate terms till the top of the turn before shooting into the lead to present his trainer his first of the two wins on the day.

 Corners Grand Ceremony had to reserve all his brilliance till the final 100m of the Zipper Cup, the feature event. He swept past the front runners from the mid-division to take all by a surprise. 

 Harvinder Singh Baths Karans Choice victory, in the Cherry Handicap, was made easy by an leisurely galloping Tomahawk who not only lost some ground at the start, he also travelled five-deep all through the trip. 

 Javed Khans Helegonia, too, benefited by Arabies half-hearted performance.

Medinah: Swede Henrik Stenson, Briton Luke Donald, US Tour veterans Billy Andrade and Tim Herron shared the lead atop a congested leaderboard after a dark and gloomy second round of the PGA Championship on Friday. 

Overcast skies, humidity and intermittent rain added an extra burden to the pressures of a major championship with a host of contenders, including world No. 1 Tiger Woods and US Open champion Geoff Ogilvy, breathing down the leaders necks. 

Stenson (68), Donald (68), Andrade (69) and Herron (67) were knotted at eight-under-par 136, one stroke ahead of British Open champion Woods, US Open winner Ogilvy and former PGA title holder Davis Love III. 

Woods rolled in a 20-footer for birdie at the 18th to finish with a 68 for seven-under 137, tying playing partner Ogilvy (68) and Davis Love III (69). 

Phil Mickelson, who played with Woods and Ogilvy, also birdied the last after driving into the rough for a scrambling 71 and a 140 total. 

It was hot and humid and it got dark quickly in the last few holes, said Donald. It was tough to judge the distance and even to see if the fairway was clear ahead of us. 

Four players were bunched at six-under Americans Chris Riley, 2001 champion David Toms, Fred Funk and Billy Mayfair, who just two weeks ago had surgery for testicular cancer. 

Another six players were grouped one more shot back, including 2003 winner Shaun Micheel, Sergio Garcia, former Masters champion Mike Weir of Canada, Swedish alternate Daniel Chopra, South African Tim Clark and American Steve Stricker. 

Chopra, a golfer of Indian origin, fired a superb five-under 67 to shoot up to tied 12th place after an even par on the first day. 

The cut was set at even-par 144 a record low for the PGA, which on three occasions had set the championship cut at one over par. 

Among the casualties were twice PGA winner Vijai Singh of Fiji (145), eight-time European Order of Merit winner Colin Montgomerie of Britain (148) and Tom Lehman (148), the US Ryder Cup captain. 

Early starter Stenson, who began the day two strokes off the pace, stormed out to a three-stroke lead with five birdies over his first 13 holes to reach nine-under. The Swede slipped back with a bogey at the last and others came up to challenge. (Reuters)

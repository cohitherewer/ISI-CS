The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 If I keep scoring, who will have the guts to drop me?

 - A TELEGRAPH EXCLUSIVE 

 Egos have no place in dressing room: Younis Khan 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Lahore: Younis Khan, the Pakistan vice-captain, continues to feast on the Indian bowlers. After excellent performances in India, last year, he has begun the newest series with a 199. The 28-year-old (a Test centurion on debut, by the way) spoke to The Telegraph on Thursday, hours before the Gaddafi Test got underway. 

The following are excerpts: 

On his background 

Im from Mardan, which is a 40-minute drive from Peshawar... All four brothers elder to me played cricket and, so, taking to the sport came rather naturally... Everybody idolised Imran Khan, a fellow Pathan, and I did the same... My own cricket, though, took off when the family joined father (Mohammed Yusuf Khan) in Karachi, where hed got a job with the Pakistan Steel Mill. 

On settling down in Karachi 

It wasnt difficult and I studied till the second year in college (Islami Arts and Commerce).... It definitely helped that Karachi was a major centre for cricket... (Adds smiling) Actually, Id got a job as early as in class VIII, from the sports quota at the Mill... As an emerging cricketer, I got a tidy packet of Rs 1,300 per month... Accha pocket money tha... I was probably the most helpful boy in the locality and even bought vegetables for neighbours. 

On who had the biggest influence 

One of my brothers, Mohammed Sharif Khan, who passed away recently... He ran the Steel Town Gymkhana cricket team and was a big inspiration... I used to go along for his matches, carrying his kit bag and acting as the scorer... I did so largely to enjoy the excellent lunch (daal fry and anda ghotala) served to the players! My brother was a fine right-hander and a decent off-break bowler and his friends would constantly say there was something different in my chaal. 

On Imran 

As Ive said, being a fellow Pathan sort of drew me to him... I read his autobiography and biography... I cant be Imran Khan, but Ive tried to mould my personality in his manner... I dont need to say he was an outstanding leader. 

On Imran being a strong backer of his 

Im grateful... What else can I say? I met him the other day, at the Academy, and offered my salaam... Somehow, Ive never got down to talking cricket with him... 

On whether hed been tense on debut (versus Sri Lanka, 1999-00) 

You may get surprised, but I wasnt. In fact, main kabhi tense nahin rahta... I managed only 12 in the first innings, but was determined to make an impression in the second as I didnt want to let down the then Board chief, (Lt Gen.) Tauqir Zia, whod backed my selection... I got 107... I remember giving (Muttiah) Muralidharan the charge and being asked by Wasim Akram to remain thanda... 

On having been ignored during the Tests when India toured Pakistan in 2003-04 

One of my brothers (Saeed), in particular, wasnt disappointed as my being overlooked allowed him to get married! Hed been engaged for some time, but my being away on national duty kept delaying the marriage... My presence was essential as in times of rejoicing and sad occasions, the entire family has to be together. Its part of our culture... The marriage kept me involved and I didnt get despondent. Rather, I was confident of making a comeback. I did. 

On his approach 

Simple ? to keep performing. If I keep scoring, who will have the guts to drop me? 

On being elevated to the vice-captaincy before last years tour to India 

Came as a surprise... Indeed, I got to know about it many hours after the world when somebody from the Board telephoned me in Mardan, where Ive returned for the past few years. 

On his elevation having been welcomed by Imran, but criticised by others 

Well, yes, there were people who said my predecessor (Mohammed Yousuf) had been treated unfairly... That injustice had been done... I didnt understand the fuss as the vice-captain neither gets special perks na hi koi bonus diya jata hai... 

On the (2004-05) tour of India 

I didnt get runs in the first Test and, so, the critics went after me. However, I had self-belief and performed in the next two. That my double century in Bangalore helped Pakistan draw the series is going to remain special. 

On the captaincy experience (one Test and two ODIs) 

Dekhiye, a captain has to lead from the front and has to be trusted by his players... Basically, theyve got to be willing to do anything asked for by the captain... When opportunities have come, Ive tried to lead from the front and believe the players had complete faith in my judgement. (After a pause) Whoever the captain, he should give players a fair run and avoid the temptation to discard somebody after, say, just a couple of failures. 

On his role model captain 

Imran, cant be anybody else... 

On his row with Shahid Afridi (who plays under him for Habib Bank) during the Bridgetown Test, when he was captain 

It wasnt as big a controversy as was made out... The misunderstanding was over the batting order, which got sorted out... Kuch aisi baat nahin thi. Of course, every player must be a team man and egos have no place in the dressing room. The country and team are bigger than individuals. For example, it wont make any difference if Im not the vice-captain in the next series. 

On whether, with frequent Indo-Pak matches in the past two years, the pressure on the players has reduced 

Youre right... It has... To keep the charm intact, the Ashes arrangement could be followed. 

On having done duty behind the stumps, too, for Pakistan 

(Laughs) Woh ho gaya... I certainly dont see myself as a wicketkeeper. 

On his interests 

Im fond of fishing and follow soccer, a sport I myself played (as striker)... As a youngster, I admired (Diego) Maradona and, in recent times, its Ronaldinho... Ive also been a fan of Roberto Carlos... I kept track of squash when the peerless Khans ? Jahangir and Jansher ? dominated as only they could. 

Finally, his thoughts as he takes guard 

That God give strength to contribute to the teams cause. That 267 in Bangalore would have been meaningless if it hadnt helped us win that Test...

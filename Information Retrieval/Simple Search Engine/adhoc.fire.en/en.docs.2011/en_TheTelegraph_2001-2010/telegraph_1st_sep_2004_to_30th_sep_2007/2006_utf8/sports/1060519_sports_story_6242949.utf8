 Liverpools spirit was our inspiration: Eto

Paris: Samuel Eto says the example of Liverpools dramatic fightback victory in last years final inspired his side to come from a goal behind to beat Arsenal to win their second European Cup on Wednesday. 

After seeing Liverpool last year we knew that we couldnt drop our heads, the Barcelona striker told a news conference after his sides 2-1 victory at the Stade de France. 

At half-time we looked for the spirit that Liverpool showed last year and that helped us through in the end. 

Liverpool fought back from 0-3 down at halftime to beat AC Milan on penalties in Istanbul last May. 

Eto said he spoke to opposite number Thierry Henry after the match, consoling the Frenchman who has been widely tipped as a Barcelona recruit for next season. 

It was a real shame that someone had to lose, he said. They played really well, but thats the way it goes in football. Wednesdays victory over Arsenal in the 50th anniversary final meant that Frank Rijkaards men will now be worthy of the Dream Team II label. 

Thanks to this trophy, we will now go down in the history of the club, said Barcelona midfielder Deco, the only player in the squad to have won the Cup before as part of the Porto side who beat Monaco in 2004. 

Like Koeman before him, the defender Juliano Balletti, who had not scored since joining Barcelona from Villarreal two seasons ago, became the hero of the night. 

Id never dreamed of scoring a goal in the final of the Champions League, its incredible said Belletti, who struck the matchwinner. 

Cruyff paid tribute to the new Dream Team, but warned them that the biggest challenge was yet to come. 

Barcelona deserved to win this Champions League as theyve played well all season, said the Dutchman. A Barcelona victory was just a question of time.... But now comes the hard part and that is staying at the top. 

Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, however, blasted the refereeing and paid tribute to his men for a spirited performance after the final. 

Im really angry because that first Barcelona goal was clearly offside, Wenger told a news conference after the game at the Stade de France. 

My players were heroes tonight but they were not rewarded. Football can be so cruel. 

Playing with 10 against 11 was very difficult but that first Barcelona goal changed the match, Wenger said. This is our first defeat in Europe this season and it comes after conceding a goal that was not valid. Its very frustrating. 

Arsenal goalkeeper Jens Lehmann became the first player ever to be sent off in a European Cup final when he was dismissed in the 18th minute. 

Obviously, it was a bit tragic that I was out after 20 minutes, Lehmann told German television. I got there a tick too late. It wasnt good. 

But the team did an excellent job. With 10 men we had a chance. Unfortunately, their first goal was an offside goal. It was bitter for us, after fighting so hard. 

Rijkaard, on the other hand, heaped praise on losers Arsenal and was not surprised they were such a hard nut to crack. 

The fact that a player was sent off changed the game dramatically. It was a shame but we have to live with it and it was a pity for the fans, the Barcelona coach added. 

Rijkaard, a three-time European Cup winner as a defender with AC Milan and Ajax Amsterdam, became the fifth man to win the competition as player and coach. (Reuters)

 FIA launches probe

London: Next years Turkish Grand Prix could be in jeopardy after a political storm erupted over the prize-giving ceremony at Sundays race in Istanbul. 

The FIA has launched a full investigation into the podium presentation at the Turkish GP and is concerned that its political neutrality may have been compromised, said an FIA spokesman. 

While he did not spell out the consequences, the matter may potentially jeopardise the races place in the 2007 championship, despite being listed in a 17-race calendar published on Tuesday. 

Sundays presentation to Ferraris winner Felipe Massa was by Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat. He was introduced to millions of viewers around the world as the President of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus in a television caption.

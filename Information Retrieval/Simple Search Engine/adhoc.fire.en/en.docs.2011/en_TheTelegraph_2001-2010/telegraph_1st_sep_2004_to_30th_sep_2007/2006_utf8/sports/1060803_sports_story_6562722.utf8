The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Bookies threaten to quit 

 OUR TURF CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta: Dust has hardly settled 

 down at the RCTC after last months turmoil which led 

 to some resignations at the top. Now bookmakers are threatening 

 to pull down shutters from Friday.

 A two decade old Amusement Tax related dues amounting to more than Rs 8 crore has periodically been a worrying factor for the race club. The tax department has now split the dues between RCTC and the bookies prompting the latter to protest.

 Between the years 1986-90, a five per cent concession in betting tax on inter-venue, was wrongly analysed by the RCTC as a relief on the live racing as well.

 Bookies had initially decided to stay away from Wednesdays races, but resumed business after an assurance from the RCTC that their grievance would be looked into.

 Six of the 38 bookies are likely to get affected by the changed equation as the rest have been out of business for long.

 RCTC has asked us to wait for two more days. In the meanwhile, we are seeking legal opinion on the issue. We will take the final decision on Friday morning; said Dipten Bannerjee, secretary, Calcutta Bookmakers Association. 

 We have stated our grievance in a detailed letter addressed to the senior steward on Wednesday; he added.

 When asked to make comment on the issue, Boman Parakh, secretary, RCTC said: They (bookmakers) have met me. The matter is being attended to.

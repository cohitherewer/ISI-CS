 Zimbabwe could be back in six months

Harare: Zimbabwe could return to Test cricket in six months, International Cricket Council (ICC) chief executive Malcolm Speed said on Tuesday. 

Ultimately it will be a decision of the ICC board, but there will be an evaluation first, Speed told a media conference in Harare when he was asked when Zimbabwe might resume playing Test matches. 

Speed added that Zimbabwe could return in six, 12 or 18 months. The Zimbabwe government took control of cricket in January and one of the first decisions taken was to withdraw the national team from the Test arena. 

The chairman of Zimbabwe Cricket (ZC), Peter Chingoka, was non-committal on being asked when Zimbabwe might play their next Test. 

We are still aiming at next year. We dont have an exact date yet, Chingoka told the media conference. 

Zimbabwe have been forced to select an inexperienced team since April 2004, when most of their experienced players quit the game or opted to further their careers in other countries after a dispute with the board that followed Heath Streak being axed as captain. 

Zimbabwe have lost nine of their last 10 Tests, seven of them by an innings. 

They last won a ODI against a major cricketing nation when they beat the West Indies by 21runs in Harare in November 2003. (Reuters)

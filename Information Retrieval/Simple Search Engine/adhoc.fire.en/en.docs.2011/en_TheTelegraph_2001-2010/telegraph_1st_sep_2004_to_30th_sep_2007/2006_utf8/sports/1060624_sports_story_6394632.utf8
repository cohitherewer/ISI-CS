 4-match ban for De Rossi

Berlin: Italy midfielder Daniele de Rossi was suspended for four matches and US defender Pablo Mastroeni received a three-match ban after Fifas disciplinary committee reviewed their red cards at the World Cup. 

De Rossi elbowed Brian McBride in the face during the 1-1 draw at Kaiserslautern last Saturday, opening a wound under the US forwards left eye that required three stitches. 

Mastroeni was sent off at the end of the first half after a late tackle on Andrea Pirlo. 

De Rossi was also fined $8,000 while Mastroeni was fined 6,000, Fifa communications director Markus Siegler said Friday. 

De Rossi would be available to play in the World Cup final if Italy makes it that far. The US were eliminated in the first round. 

Fifa told us they gave him a four-match ban rather than a five-match ban because they appreciated the letter De Rossi wrote apologising for his actions, said the Italian Football Federations media spokesman Antonello Valentini. 

Italy said they would not appeal against the decision.

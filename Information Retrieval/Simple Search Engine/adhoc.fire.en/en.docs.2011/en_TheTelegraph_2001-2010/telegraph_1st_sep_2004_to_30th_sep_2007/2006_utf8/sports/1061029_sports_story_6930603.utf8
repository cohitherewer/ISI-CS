 Bob Woolmer summoned

 Karachi: Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer has been summoned by the PCB tribunal on Wednesday. With Pakistan making an early exit from the Champions Trophy, the three-man tribunal has taken the opportunity to take some more days and question the coach as well as the support staff. 

Statements by Woolmer and fellow-South Africans Darryn Lifsun (physiotherapist) and Murray Stevenson (trainer) will be recorded on the Shoaib Akhtar-Mohammed Asif doping scandal, which erupted on the eve of Pakistans Champions Trophy opener earlier this month. 

The tribunal plans to wrap up proceedings after Wednesdays hearing. We have questioned and heard both the bowlers in detail in the last 48 hours and given them ample opportunity to defend themselves, tribunal head Shahid Hamid said in Lahore. 

We also invited two specialist doctors Syed Abrar Raza and Javed Akram to get their expert views on this issue and the bowlers were allowed to cross-question them. 

Meanwhile, the PCB plans to submit a detailed chargesheet against Australian umpire Darrell Hair to the International Cricket Council (ICC) and initiate an inquiry into his controversial conduct during the forfeited Oval Test. 

We will make sure we submit a strong chargesheet against him with the ICC, a PCB official said on Saturday. 

The chargesheet, which will outline all the violations Hair has committed against the Code of Conduct for Umpires, is in the final stages and will be sent to the ICC within a week, he said. 

The chargesheet was being prepared after the ICC rejected an earlier request from the PCB to hold an inquiry into Hairs conduct. (Agencies)

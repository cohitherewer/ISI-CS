 Anand storms into joint lead

Monaco: Defending champion Viswanathan Anand showcased his technical prowess to outclass Grandmaster Boris Gelfand of Israel in a blindfold game to emerge joint leader after the fourth round of the Amber Blindfold and Rapid chess tournament here on Wednesday. 

Anand clinched the mini-match 1.5-0.5 and took his tally to five points to share the lead with Alexander Morozevich of Russia. Having lost the first round against Morozevich, this is a fine comeback by the Indian super GM even though last year he had seven victories on the trot to start with. 

With seven rounds still to go, it promises to be a close contest this year as a pack of three is stalking the two leaders. 

In the blindfold section, while Veselin Topalov and Morozevich have three points, Anand inched up to a 50 per cent score and is now joint third on two points. In the rapid section, Anand shares the lead along with his world championship second Peter Heine Nielsen of Denmark with both having three points from four games. 

Gelfand employed the Petroff Defence as black but could never really equalise, as Anand always appeared to have a tangible advantage. 

With some effective pawn moves on the king side, Anand exerted pressure and in trying to work out a counter play for himself, Gelfand erred and found himself defending a pawn-less queen and pawns endgame. It was here that Anand played in copy book fashion and won in 51 moves. 

The rapid game turned out to be a tame affair as Gelfand could not press for any real advantage despite playing with white pieces. 

Playing against the Queens Indian Defence by Anand, the Israeli tried only for a short while and signed peace in just 24 moves.

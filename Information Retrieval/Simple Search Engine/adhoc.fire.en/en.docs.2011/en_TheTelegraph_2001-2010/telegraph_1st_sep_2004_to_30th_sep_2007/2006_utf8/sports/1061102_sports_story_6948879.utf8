The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Dodgy Shoaib Akhtar gets 2 years

 - Lighter punishment for Village boy Mohammed Asif as he took nandrolone out of ignorance 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 BANNED 

Calcutta: Coach Bob Woolmer wasn rsquo;t in the best of moods after Pakistan got knocked out of the Champions Trophy last week

 That latest defeat (at the hands of South Africa) hadn rsquo;t even sunk in when he was asked whether the team was missing Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Asif, who rsquo;d been suspended and were at the centre of a nandrolone-specific doping scandal.

 ldquo;We rsquo;ve got to get used to life without them hellip; It rsquo;s as simple as that, rdquo; Woolmer responded, his tone betraying irritation.

 On Wednesday night it got confirmed (as of now) that the spearheads wouldn rsquo;t be available for what is an eternity in the life of a cricket team mdash; Shoaib for two years, Asif one.

 That followed the judgement of the three-member tribunal, constituted by the PCB, to probe the biggest drugs scandal to hit cricket.

 [Agencies have quoted an unnamed PCB official as saying Shoaib and Asif can appeal within seven days.] 

 While both are out of sport rsquo;s biggest tournament, the World Cup mdash; to be held in March-April 2007, there rsquo;s a huge question mark over Shoaib ever again playing. 

 Asif, though, is young (23) and should be able to pick up the pieces. 

 The tribunal (headed by legal eagle Shahid Hamid) reached its decision after many hours of deliberations in Lahore. The tainted duo got ample opportunity to defend themselves. 

 Hamid rsquo;s colleagues were former captain and coach Intikhab Alam and sports medicine expert Dr Waqar Ahmad.

 According to The Telegraph rsquo;s sources, the tribunal went soft on Asif (who made the point about having been brought up in a village) as he rsquo;d taken the banned nandrolone ldquo;out of ignorance. rdquo;

 One of the sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said: ldquo;Asif, who was recovering from an injury, took Promax-50 (a nutritional supplement) during the recent tour of England hellip; That contained nandrolone hellip;

 ldquo;He stopped taking it when the physio (Darryn Lifson) learnt about it hellip; By then, however, the damage had been done hellip; It rsquo;s a tragedy, but Asif took the substance without realising the consequences hellip; rdquo;

 Shoaib (described as ldquo;sexually active rdquo; in his written submission) has been nailed for being vague and trying to blame the team rsquo;s support staff for his plight.

 Among the quickest ever in the business, Shoaib informed the tribunal that he rsquo;d been taking a ldquo;high protein diet and protein supplements rdquo; since 1999. Also, that he rsquo;d been on ldquo;isotonic solutions and herbal medicines rdquo; since 2002.

 Significantly, Shoaib rsquo;s claim that the excessive nandrolone was produced 

endogenously rdquo; wasn rsquo;t upheld. Moreover, he couldn rsquo;t specify the vitamins he rsquo;d been consuming. Nor was he able to list the herbal medicines.

 Shoaib is understood to have contended that ldquo;friends rdquo; gave the latter. 

 Intriguingly, he claimed to have signed his last contract with the PCB (which included an anti-doping clause) without reading it!

 Obviously, Shoaib was being dodgy and the tribunal took him apart. Perhaps, it rsquo;s worth noting that he was the last to give his urine sample for testing, on October 2. 

 In its report, the tribunal stated: ldquo;Shoaib has been unable to establish that he did not know or suspect and could not reasonably have known or suspected that he had been using prohibited substances hellip; rdquo; 

 Shoaib, by the way, didn rsquo;t give the tribunal a single sample of any nutritional supplement for tests to determine ldquo;contamination. rdquo; His doctor, Nouman Niaz, had feared that possibility.

 The duo tested positive for nandrolone when the samples of 19 cricketers were sent to a World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada)-accredited lab in Malaysia rsquo;s Penang. 

 The tests were at the behest of the PCB, which has signed the Wada code.

 The results were communicated on October 15 and made public a day later. Both Shoaib and Asif were then in Jaipur for the Champions Trophy and were recalled on the first flight.

 Meanwhile, despite the stigma, Asif may not be dropped as a nominee for the International Cricket Council rsquo;s Emerging Player of the Year award. 

 Asif, though, will be sent a message that he won rsquo;t be welcome. The function is to be held in Mumbai on Friday.

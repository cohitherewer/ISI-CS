A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: This Sourav wasnt a famous name unlike namesake former India captain Sourav Ganguly. But this young prodigy shot into the limelight and became famous for his four wickets on debut on Monday. 

After proving his worth in the Under-22 camp helping his side win the C.K. Nayudu Trophy, Sourav made a perfect start Monday to his Ranji season. With four wickets for 38, the right-arm mediumpacer could not have asked for a better debut. Maharashtra ended Day I at 171 for 7. 

But with three still remaining, he eyes the magical five-wicket haul. Tomorrow Ill aim for a five-wicket haul a confident-looking Sourav said. 

The journey to earn Bengal cap took three years, after having represented India in the U-19 Asia Cup in Pakistan in 2003-04 alongside Irfan Pathan. 

Yes, there have been various ups and downsbut I just kept my focus straight, something which my dad tells me everytime, Sourav said, dedicating his debut performance to his father Subrata. Hes there behind me always whatever, Im now, its all because of my dad.

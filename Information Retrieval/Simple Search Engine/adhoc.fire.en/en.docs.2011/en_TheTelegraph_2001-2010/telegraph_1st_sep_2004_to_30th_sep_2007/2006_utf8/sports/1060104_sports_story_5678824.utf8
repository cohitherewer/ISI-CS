 A tough season ahead: Sania

Hong Kong: Indian tennis sensation Sania Mirza warned on Tuesday that she was expecting a tougher season ahead after her breakthrough 2005. 

Mirza, 19, said she would no longer be the surprise package after becoming the first Indian to win a WTA Tour event and soaring more than 100 rankings places to 34. 

In the second year the girls know your game ? youre no rookie any more, said Sania, ahead of the eight-player Champions Challenge Invitational. Everyones looking out for you so it gets tougher. 

Mirza will line up against four of the worlds top 10 here less than two weeks before the Australian Open, where she reached the third round as a wildcard entry last year. 

This year I would like to stay in the top 35 and hopefully keep my ranking there so I get seeded in the Grand Slams, and hopefully just survive there, she said. 

My eventual goal is to be in the top 10 and the top five but I have enough pressure from everyone else. So I just want to go out there, do my best and shut everyone out. 

World No. 1 Lindsay Davenport, second-ranked Kim Clijsters, defending champion Elena Dementieva and the Williams sisters are also appearing here, along with Czech star Nicole Vaidisova and Chinas Zheng Jie.

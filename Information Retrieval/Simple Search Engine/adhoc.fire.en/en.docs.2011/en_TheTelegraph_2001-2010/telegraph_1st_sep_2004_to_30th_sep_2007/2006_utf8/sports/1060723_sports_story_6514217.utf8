 How India missed a date with Brazil

 - AIFF forced to turn down offer of friendly in London

New Delhi: It may sound unreal, but Venkatesh amp; Co. have just missed a chance to rub shoulders with the likes of Ronaldo and Ronaldinho. 

According to a highly-placed source, a British agent ? planning some exhibition games for the Brazilian national team in England ? had forwarded an invitation to the AIFF asking whether India would be interested in playing one of those privately-organised friendlies on September 3 in London. 

For a country ranked No. 130 in the world, it was a Godsent opportunity, but the AIFF had to turn down the offer. We would have loved to play the match, but on September 6 we are scheduled to play Saudi Arabia in the Asian Cup qualifiers in Jeddah. Skipping that match would invite a heavy fine and ban from the Asian Football Confederation, said a senior AIFF official. 

Ironically, national coach Bob Houghton was reportedly not too keen on playing Brazil. The British coach has made it clear to the federation that he is not in favour of playing against teams which are much stronger than India. He has suggested to the AIFF that right now, India should only compete against teams which are slightly ahead of them. 

Houghton feels the main problem of the current Indian footballers is their lack of self-confidence when playing international matches, the AIFF official said. It would do them no good if they continue to play against much superior opponents and lose by big margins, Houghton has argued. 

The confidence-building process, Houghton has told the federation, would begin if India play against teams from Far East and Middle-East. Only after some months should India try facing the top-ranked teams. 

This is purely a Houghton formula, one which earned him a lot of success when he was the national coach of China, said the AIFF official. Since we have decided to give him a free hand, we have accepted his ideas. 

In November, AIFF planned to host an international tournament with some top teams around the world, but has shelved the idea as Houghton is not in favour of such a meet on the eve of the Asian Games.

Beijing: Jeev Milkha Singh ended his seven-year title drought with a magnificent win under trying conditions at the Volvo China Open golf championship here on Sunday. 

The 34-year-old Chandigarh golfer, who last won in 1999, held his nerve to finally claim his first European Tour title with a one-shot victory at the co-sanctioned meet. 

The son of famed Olympic athlete Milkha Singh, the flying Sikh, Singh shot a final round 70 to finish at 10 under par for the tournament as his main challengers fell by the wayside. 

It is Jeevs fifth win on Asian Tour and his purse of $300,000 takes him to the top of the Asian Tour Order of Merit. 

Among other Indians, Amandeep Johl (69) was 20th with two-under 286, Harmeet Kahlon (76) was 54th with six-over 294 and Rahil Gangjee (75) was 60th with seven-over 295. 

While the high winds that wreaked havoc on Saturdays third round at the Honghua Golf Club eased significantly for the final round, good scoring was still at a premium. 

Spains Gonzalo Fernandez-Castano dropped a shot at the 18th to fall to 70 for the day and finished second on nine under for the tournament. 

Briton David Lynn, the leader after the second and third rounds, finished a shot further back after a disappointing 73 with four bogeys and three birdies. 

Defending champion Paul Casey shot a 72 for a share of fourth place on seven under, along with fellow Briton Simon Wakefield and Australians Peter Fowler and Jarrod Lyle. 

Jeev started the day in a tie for second but dropped a shot at the opening hole, before hitting back with birdies at the third, fifth and seventh. 

At the 11th, his tee shot went into trees and a spectator picked up the ball and threw it away. The offender received a kick from another spectator but Jeev maintained his concentration and found a shot that enabled him to save par. 

My ball was down there and this guy was walking with my golf ball in his hand, said Jeev. 

There were so many people saying so many things to him and he got confused and scared and just let the ball go. 

In an ensuing melee, another man, upset at the huge breach of golf etiquette, launched a boot at the offenders backside. 

I just told him to relax and the rules official came and told the guy to tell me where the ball stopped. 

Jeev took a free drop and saved par. 

From then on the 34-year-old was rock steady, with Fernandez in the clubhouse two shots behind, and he was able to afford three putts on the final green to claim victory. 

Li Chao, the only one of 22 mainland Chinese in the draw to make the cut, shot a final round 78 to finish six-over for the tournament after carding par 72s for the first three rounds. (AGENCIES)

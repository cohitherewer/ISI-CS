Doha: The Indian golf team on Monday won its first Asian Games team medal since 1982 when they clinched the silver under gathering clouds at the Doha Golf Course. 

With rain threatening to disrupt the show, Gaganjit Bhullar, who needed at least a par in the final hole to ensure India the silver, played solidly, two-putting in the 581-yard, par-5 18th to finish the round with a one-over 73. 

With Bhullars 73 and Chiragh Kumar and Anirban Lahiri carding 72 apiece, India managed to edge out Chinese Taipei by a stroke for second place. Joseph Chakola, the fourth of the team, carded a 77. 

The last time India won the golf team medal was in New Delhi when Amit Luthra, Rajiv Mohta, Rishi Narain and Lakshman Singh had won the gold. Shiv Kapur won the individual title four years ago in Busan. 

The Indians had a four-day total of 849 and the Koreans ended at 836. 

Bhullar said that the team had been confident of winning the silver medal. We knew the Koreans were far ahead, but we had a chance for a silver at least, said Bhullar. Lahiri said that the team could have played much better. But then, others also played badly, he said. 

Among the Indians, Bhullar was the best finisher, ending in tied seventh spot with a 283. Chiragh finished tied 11th at 285 (3-under), Lahiri (286) tied 14th and Chakola (290), tied 18th. 

In archery, Dola Banerjee raised hopes of winning at least a bronze before losing to Ling Zhao of China in the medal match. I am not disappointed, said Dola later. 

The Chinese and Koreans are always better than us. They have a tradition in archery. Compared to them, we are still in the learning process, she said. 

Another Indian girl raised hopes of a gold medal, but Geethia Jakhar, who reached the final of the 63kg freestyle wrestling event lost to Japans four-time world and Olympic champion Kaori Icho. She later criticised the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI). 

We have come here only after 20 days of practice, she said. It was not enough. The factionalism in the federation has really ruined our chances. But I have lost to a world champion in the final. I have no regrets. 

Alka Tomar won the bronze in the freestyle 48kg category.

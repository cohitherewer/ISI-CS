The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 For pacers, India is the ultimate

 McGrath has reiterated his keenness to play the Champions Trophy 

Sydney: Glenn McGrath underwent a practice session, watched by coach John Buchanan on Wednesday, to step up his bid to be fit for the Ashes starting in November. 

McGrath, who has not represented his country since January after taking time off to help wife Jane in her battle against cancer, reiterated his wish to play the Champions Trophy in India in October. 

If I go on past experience, whenever weve played in India leading into a season, I have always come back to Australia and bowled really well straightaway, the 36-year-old said in Brisbane. 

For fast bowlers, India is still the ultimate. Its a great place to prepare, that would be my first choice. 

McGrath said he had no problem with the possibility of England allrounder Andrew Flintoff playing for New South Wales to help him recover from an ankle injury in time to play the Ashes series. 

 McGrath has not been impressed with Englands form since they beat Australia last year for the first time since 1987. Since the Ashes I have been disappointed with their form, he said.

Calcutta: Jagmohan Dalmiya on Friday moved the city civil court challenging the validity of the notice issued to him by the BCCI asking him to appear before its disciplinary committee in Chennai on August 15. 

P. K. Sarkar, judge-in-chief of the city civil court, admitted the petition and fixed the matter for hearing on August 10. 

Dalmiya had moved a similar petition before the same court on July 26 when the BCCI, through a notice, had directed him to appear before the disciplinary committee on July 27. The meeting was, however, postponed at the 11 th hour.

 - With better officiating we could have won, says coach Kaushik

Madrid: Indias hopes of making the semi-finals were dashed after they were held to a 1-1 draw by England in a pool A match that was marred by two controversially disallowed goals at the womens hockey World Cup here on Sunday. 

Schloe Rogers put England ahead in the 47th minute before Surinder Kaur equalised for India with her fourth goal of the tournament by converting a penalty stroke. 

In Sundays match, all the talks were about the goals that were not to be. Asunta Lakra seemed to have put India ahead with her powerful drive with seconds before the end of first period. 

But the Indians were stunned to discover when they returned to the park that the umpires had reversed their decision during the break. 

The tournament officials refused to accept Indias protest, saying the umpires decision could not be contested. We pleaded them to take into consideration the video evidence, but they would not listen, coach Maharaj Kaushik said. We played well. With a little bit of better officiating we could have won 2-0. The umpiring cost us. 

But Kaushiks hints of bias might be misplaced since England also had a goal disallowed, after it was referred to the television umpire. 

India successfully appealed against a deflection by Kerry Williams with two minutes to go for the buzzer. The two teams had featured in another controversy-marred match, the final of the Manchester Commonwealth Games in 2002. Then, the winner by Mamta Kharab about the time hooter sounded was disputed by the losing hosts. 

The draw gave the Indian eves their first point after three matches in the tournament, leaving them dependent on several ifs and buts to make it to the knock-out stage. Last editions runners-up Holland led the pool with nine points after a 2-0 win over Spain who were second in the table with six points. England were placed third with four points while Germany, with three points from two matches so far. 

India next take on Spain and China, who are at the bottom of the points tally, in back-to-back matches on Tuesday and Wednesday.

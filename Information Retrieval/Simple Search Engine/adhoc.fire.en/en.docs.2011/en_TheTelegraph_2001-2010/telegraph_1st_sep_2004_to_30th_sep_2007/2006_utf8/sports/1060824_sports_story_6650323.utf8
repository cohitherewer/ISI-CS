Calcutta: Mohun Bagan continued their sordid run in the Sahara Calcutta Football League with a 1-1 draw against Railway FC at the Barasat Stadium on Wednesday. This was their second draw in five matches. They have a sole victory to bank on apart from two losses. 

For the star-studded side, this performance will hardly enthuse their fans ahead of the derby clash against East Bengal on Saturday. 

The stars were, however, missing from the line-up as coach Biswajit Bhattacharjee decided to give them a break. But that wasnt reason enough for the players to dish out soccer as dull as ditch-water. 

There was clear lack of communication between the players. We need more practice. Some of the players are injured Some need rest to recover. Weve to concentrate hard on the next match There are ups and downs in life and Im ready to take it all in my stride, Biswajit explained later. 

A fifth-minute goal from Dipendu Biswas had raised visions of a resounding victory, but the glamour side failed to show the enthusiasm and enterprise in the remaining session. Railway FC, on the other hand, exhibited a compact midfield and defence, which the Bagan forwards found almost impossible to overcome. 

On the slushy turf, the Bagan players fitness was appalling and their inability to control the ball complicated matters further. Railway FC were desperate not to let in a second goal and the Bagan players found the going tough. 

The green and maroons clearly lacked a leader who could have rescued them from such a situation. As the inexperienced players groped in the dark, Dipendu tried his best upfront but lacked adequate support. He was also guilty of missing a couple of sitters. 

Ndem Guy Herve, in his debut for Bagan, never appeared in control of things. A yellow card booking was his most significant contribution. 

The Bagan defence seemed porous and tended to cave in at the slightest pressure. The railwaymen capitalised on one such defensive lapse as Man of the Match Suraj Mondal scored after finding himself in the clear following a pass from Bablu Banik. 

Bagan were denied a goal in the 35th minute when P.C. Lalawmpuias shot got stuck in the slush near the goalline before being cleared in time by one of the Railway FC defenders.

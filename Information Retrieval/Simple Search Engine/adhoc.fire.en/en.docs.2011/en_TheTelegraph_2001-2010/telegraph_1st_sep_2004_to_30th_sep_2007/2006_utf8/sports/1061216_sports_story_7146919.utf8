 No award, only third place for Jaspal Rana

 - NRAI miscommunication leads to confusion 

JAYDEEP BASU

Doha: In his first visit to Doha for the Asian Games, shooter Jaspal Rana struck down three gold medals. The second visit, however, brought disappointment. Widely tipped to win the Most Valuable Player Award in the Asian Games, Rana was on Friday pushed to the third spot. 

[On Tuesday, PTI had reported that Rana had won the award.] 

The confusion was apparently created by the National Rifle Association of India (NRAI), when they were informed by the Asian Games Organising Committee about Ranas nomination for the award. They, in turn, communicated to Rana that he had already won it. 

The Indian shooter looked frustrated but remained calm after the awards ceremony. He refused to blame anyone for the goof up and said it is part of life. It is good that I could make the list. 

South Korean swimmer Tae Hwan-park, who bagged three golds, one silver and three bronze medals here, clinched the issue with 231 votes in his favour, Rana got only 99. 

Ironically, Rana was the only one among the seven nominated present in the award giving ceremony. He was on his way to Dehradun from New Delhi when he was called back and was asked to proceed for Doha again by the NRAI. 

As one of the finalists, Rana was garlanded and awarded a trophy by the organising committee. It was handed over to him by Olympic Council of Asia secretary Randhir Singh.

 Teenager alleges assault 

Melbourne: Australian police are investigating allegations that a teenage worker at the Commonwealth Games Athletes Village was indecently assaulted by a member of one of the competing teams. 

Its against a 16-year-old, it allegedly happened at 10 am this morning (2300 GMT), a police spokesman said on Monday. 

Another police spokeswoman later said that a man was helping police with their inquiries and that the man was not an athlete. 

Hes definitely not an athlete. Hes connected with one of the teams but Im not sure in what capacity, she said. 

Neither police nor Games officials would say what team the man represented. 

This is subject to a police investigation so I cannot comment on that, Mike Hooper, the Games chief executive officer, said earlier by telephone. 

But I can confirm that there was a complaint made and the incident is being investigated by the police. 

The Village will be home for 4,500 athletes and 1,500 officials during the March 15-26 Games. Australia is staging one of its largest-ever security operations for the Games, with 13,000 police and 2,500 defence personnel and private security guards. (REUTERS)

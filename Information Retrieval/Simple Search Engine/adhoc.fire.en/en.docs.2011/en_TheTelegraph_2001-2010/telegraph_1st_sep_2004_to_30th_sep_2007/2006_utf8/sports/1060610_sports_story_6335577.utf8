 Quick Takes

 Greek fan arrested

 Frankfurt: Police arrested 

 a Greek national who pulled a knife on an England fan in 

 an isolated incident as thousands of soccer supporters flocked 

 to Frankfurt for Englands World Cup opener against 

 Paraguay.

 Frankfurt police chief Achim Thiel 

 told a press conference on Friday that the man had been 

 arrested on Thursday after a confrontation in a pub full 

 of England fans but that no one had been hurt.

 Some 30,000 England fans are expected 

 to descend on Germanys financial capital for the Group 

 B opening match on Saturday.

 Coachs own goal

 Gelsenkirchen: Ecuador 

 coach Luis Fernando Suarez had no qualms about imposing 

 a World Cup sex ban on his players. The only problem is 

 that it applies to him as well.

 Oh thats good, 

 said one female journalist, impressed by his solidarity. 

 No. No, it is not good, smirked Suarez, during 

 a news conference. It is not good at all.

 A World Cup to 

 ease depression

 Lima: Prisoners at one 

 of Latin Americas biggest jails kicked off their own 

 soccer World Cup on Thursday, an event officials hope will 

 ease the chronic depression common among inmates at the 

 overcrowded and violent penitentiary. Watched by 300 of 

 the best-behaved inmates at Limas tough Lurigancho 

 jail, convicted criminals ranging from car thieves to drug 

 dealers participated in the opening match in which Germany 

 defeated Costa Rica, 4-2, a preview of the first 

 game in the real event.

 Honest punter

 Berlin: An honest punter 

 turned in a plastic bag containing 800 World Cup tickets 

 which he found in a Frankfurt underground station on Thursday. 

 Despite soaring black market prices for tickets to the soccer 

 tournament, which begins on Friday, the man resisted temptation 

 and handed his find to the lost property office. The Frankfurt 

 public transport network said the tickets had been passed 

 on to the World Cup organising committee who were trying 

 to discover if they were genuine.

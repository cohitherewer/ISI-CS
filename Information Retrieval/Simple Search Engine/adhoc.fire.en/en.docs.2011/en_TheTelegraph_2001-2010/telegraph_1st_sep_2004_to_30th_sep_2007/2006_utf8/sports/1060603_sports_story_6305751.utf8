 Jacques Kallis elbowed out

Durban: South Africas allrounder Jacques Kallis was ruled out on Friday of the tour of Sri Lanka starting next month following a surgery to treat a tennis elbow injury. 

Kallis would not be available for the tour to Sri Lanka from July 19 to August 30 in view of the fact that it would take nearly three months for the surgery to heal, the South African Board said in a statement on Friday. 

Chairperson of Cricket South Africas medical committee, Shuaib Manjra said the full healing process would take about 10-12 weeks. 

The surgery confirmed the initial diagnosis. The degenerative tissue was debrided and the tendon sutured back onto the bone. Jacques ligament, which showed some degeneration, was also attended to. His left-arm will be immobile for three weeks,

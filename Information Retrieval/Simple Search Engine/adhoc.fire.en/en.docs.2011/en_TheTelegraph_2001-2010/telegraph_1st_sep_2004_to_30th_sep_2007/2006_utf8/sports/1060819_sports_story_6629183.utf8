Calcutta: East Bengal maintained a clean slate, but just about. A weak Vincent Pires header, 19 minutes into the second half, went through three pairs of legs on the Chirag United goalline to give the red-and-golds their third straight win in the CFL Premier Division. 

East Bengal medio Dipankar Roy pipped Chirag Uniteds speedy forward Ratan Das to the Man-of-the-Match award, but it was the referee who caught the attention the most almost always for the wrong reasons. 

Sunando Bose turned out to be one whistle-happy, card-loving referee. He booked as many as eight players, most of them for reason beyond comprehension. His worst piece of judgement was when he cautioned Chirag Uniteds Surajit Chakraborty for fouling Jayanta Sen, but let the latter go scot-free for a nasty retaliation. Both players deserved the same treatment and that would have meant marching orders for the East Bengal medio as he had already been booked a few minutes earlier. 

The referee was also guilty of killing the natural flow of the game, misjudging infringements and failing to apply the advantage rule. 

East Bengal, without looking too sharp, were very much in control of proceedings. Chirag Uniteds ultra-defensive tactics helped Dipankar and Chandan Das rule the midfield for the entire opening session and half of the second. 

A Fredy Mascarenhas shot, off a Dipankar cross, hit the sidepost. Ashim Biswas came within striking distance of scoring thrice heading wide the first time, failing to capitalise on a fumble from the shaky custodian and seeing a left-footer being palmed away by Santosh Goswami. 

With some good players at his disposal, one expected Philippe de Ridder to adopt a positive approach. Alas, the Belgian turned out to be a typically cautious coach wary of big names and their reputation. How quickly the former East Bengal coach has changed mindset! 

It was after Pires put East Bengal ahead that Chirag United came out of their defensive shell. And thanks to the energy, enterprise and speed of lone forward Ratan, De Ridders team shook the East Bengal defence three-four times in the final 20 minutes. 

The reliable Covan Lawrence struggled to check Ratan. In fact, Covan had to leave the field after injuring himself in trying to stop a Ratan run, giving M. Suresh his first spell this season after all the drama over his playing for Mohammedan Sporting. 

A breathtaking 40-yard solo run proved abortive as Ratans final touch, with just Suresh to beat, was a tad too fast. 

East Bengal would have let in the equaliser had Avishek Aich not fumbled when keeper Abhra Mondal made a mess of clearing a long Ashim back-pass.

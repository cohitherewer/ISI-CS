 Narrow escape for Toyota

Sao Paulo: Four Toyota team members escaped unhurt when gunmen ambushed their car after leaving the Brazilian Formula One Grand Prix circuit on Friday night, a spokeswoman said. 

Brazilian Fernanda de Mello Villas-Boas, who was in the vehicle, said shots were fired while one of a gang of youths tried to kick in the passenger window at a traffic lights about 3-km from the Interlagos track. 

I took the handbrake and told everyone not to react, she said. He had a gun at my head outside the window...I think what saved us was that there was a car behind. They fired a few shots at it, I told people just dont move, stay down.

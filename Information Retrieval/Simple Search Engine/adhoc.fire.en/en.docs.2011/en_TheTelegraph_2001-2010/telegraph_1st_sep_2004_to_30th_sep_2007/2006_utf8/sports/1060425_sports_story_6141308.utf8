 Get ready to have a ball 

The launch of the official ball of the 2006 World Cup final means it can now straightforwardly be said that this summers tournament in Germany has inspired more balls than any World Cup in history ? a truly unprecedented amount of balls. 

The latest commemorative, gold-panelled issue of the Adidas Teamgeist ball joins the already announced black- panelled version ? itself, you will remember, a breakthrough in ball technology whose revolutionary new propeller panel shape and patented thermal bonding technique have been mutually designed to minimise corners and create a more homogenous system in terms of performance and look while allowing for a cleaner kicking area. 

It only surprises me that nobody thought of it before, Franz Beckenbauer said, referring to the little flash of marketing brilliance that sees the final get its own limited-edition ball, marked with the date and kick-off time, to avoid unnecessary confusion. 

But, of course, marketing being marketing, it wont stop there. So, cut out our handy, at-a-glance Official Balls of the World Cup guide and sellotape it to the side of your television set for easy reference come June. 

m The Official Ball Of The 2006 World Cup Third-place Play-off : This specially commissioned, beige-trimmed edition of the Teamgeist ball boasts a uniquely developed vario-valve, for that slightly deflated look. In addition, the incorporation into the balls casing of a heat-sealed layer formed from recycled plimsolls ensures that it is likely to absorb water at more than ten times the Fifa-approved standard and, even dry, should provide no bounce whatsoever. Utterly lifeless, all in all, then. What better way to mark the traditional consolation occasion for teams who, if they were being honest, would rather have gone home after the semi-finals? 

m The Official Group Of Death Ball: Distinct from the Teamgeist in being made from vulcanised body parts and covered in hair and worms, the all-new Poltergeist is solely for use by teams in the group deemed by a handpicked committee of television pundits to be the most deathly (probably group C this time). The latest microchip technology enables the ball to be programmed to emit a variety of blood-curdling screams and groans, while the deployment of a thin paste of radioactive materials in the coating makes the resulting sphere liable to move a bit in the air and even more liable to burst into flames, laying waste to everything within a 20-yard radius. Limited domestic take-up is expected post-Germany, although Blackburn Rovers could possibly license it for use in the event that they make it into Europe next season. Note: Requires batteries and a concrete-lined carrier bag. 

m The Official Ball Of The Almost Certainly Meaningless Group H Match Between Saudi Arabia And Tunisia: Exactly like the ball used in all the other group H matches and yet that little bit more meaningless, thanks to its construction from a blend of surplus materials. Because of the balls unique deadweight structure, it can also double as an abdominal exerciser or be hollowed out and used in the garden as a flower planter. 

m The Official Light Training And Stretching-Only Ball: The result of a long and detailed period of consultation with the England medical staff, this lightweight, sponge-style ball has been developed for use in the run-up to the tournament by those who have played in excess of 85 club games in the previous ten months and either wouldnt care if they never saw a football again or have broken something, or both. Fabricated from 100 per cent Metatarsalite, the Recupoball comes with a special Ralgex-based coating and features an inlaid Nurofen dispenser. This invaluable remedial tool came with input at the R amp;D stage from Michael Owen. Tinkly bell and string optional. 

m The Official Ball Of The Opening Ceremony: Humungous tarpaulin sphere that automatically bursts open to disclose 1,400 schoolchildren in national dress and a selection of drama students on stilts. A significant technological advance on the legendary Guffball, used at the start of France 98, the 2006 model offers superior roll, courtesy of an all-new, butter-based waxing treatment for the surface, and features a patented venting system that ensures a continued supply of oxygen to the children in the event of any overrun in the scheduled show. Patently pointless and yet somehow essential. Warning: May also contain German light entertainers.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 No invitation for Wright

 - BCCI FUNCTION 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Wright 

Mumbai: Former Team India coach John Wright, who didnt mince words in describing the state of the Board of Control for Cricket in Indias (BCCIs) existing HQ, in one corner of the Brabourne Stadium, hasnt been invited for Saturdays inauguration of a new establishment at the Wankhede. 

I havent received an invitation... Not till now at least, Wright, who has been on Media duty throughout the Champions Trophy, told The Telegraph on Friday evening. 

Wright, it may be recalled, has written the following in his recently-released book, Indian Summers: Although the BCCI generates a major proportion of crickets total revenues, its office in Mumbai has concrete floors and a toilet that requires key access. I reckon those ramshackle surroundings are the greatest feat of camouflage since a wolf put on sheeps clothing. 

Given Wrights contribution to Indian cricket, it wouldve been nice had an invitation been extended. 

Meanwhile, of the 19 captains invited by the BCCI, 15 are expected to be present. While D.K.Gaekwad and Polly Umrigar are unwell, Kapil Dev is overseas and Sourav Ganguly has a Duleep Trophy match in Guwahati. 

Among past presidents and office-bearers, a notable absentee will be Jagmohan Dalmiya, who has been cornered by the Sharad Pawar regime.

A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta: At a time when the Jeev Milkha Singhs and Jyoti Randhawas are trying to carve a niche for Indian golf in the global game, Calcutta is moving with the times as well. 

The Tolly-ONGC Golf Centre has been set up at the Tollygunge Club to train golfers ranging from talented juniors and professionals to ladies, club members and corporates. 

The idea behind setting up this centre is to develop a golfer in totality by giving him all kinds of modern facilities at an affordable rate, Indrajit Bhalotia, an active golfer who has taken to coaching as well, said at a press conference on Friday afternoon. 

The driving range at Tollygunge Club has been upgraded. Among other services the Centre will provide are fitness for golf including yoga, lessons on psychology and nutrition which are so necessary for the development of a modern-day sportsperson.

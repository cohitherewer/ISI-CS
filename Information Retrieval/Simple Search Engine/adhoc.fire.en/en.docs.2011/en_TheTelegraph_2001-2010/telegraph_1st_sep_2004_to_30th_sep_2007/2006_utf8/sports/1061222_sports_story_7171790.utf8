 Jadeja: Sourav should replace Dravid as captain in World Cup

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: When in Rome talk Roman and when at the cricket academy where Sourav Ganguly is the director (known as Videocon School of Cricket), talk of Sourav (and Sourav) even if its a bit unrealistic and far-fetched. 

Rahul Dravid may have been chosen as the ICC Test Captain of the Year. But for former Indian cricketer Ajay Jadeja, its Sourav, who is the best Indian captain. Here in the city (with Robin Singh and Rajesh Chauhan) for a talent hunt, Jadeja batted for the former Indian skipper. 

Showering praises on Sourav following his great Indian comeback which saw India taste their first Test victory in South Africa, Jadeja said: With Sourav back in the side, there should not be any question on the captaincy. If India hope to win the World Cup, Sourav should be made the captain, as hes the best captain Ive ever seen. 

However, Jadeja appeared unaware of the fact that Dravid has already been named captain till the World Cup. 

So is Dravid a better captain than Sourav? Jadeja played diplomatic. Hes very young as a captainso it would be unfair to compare the two, Jadeja said. 

He further felt that Sourav should have been there in the one-day side too that toured South Africa. Its because of the way we lost (the one-dayers), the old hands were called in. 

Meanwhile, Robin too echoed the same. Claiming that therere very few one-day cricketers like Sourav, the former Indian allrounder said: Sourav is no lucky charm hes a fine one-day cricketer, and his place in the ODI squad is foremost.

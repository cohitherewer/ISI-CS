The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Giving my best to Bagan a challenge, says Bhutia 

A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta: His past associations with Mohun Bagan have been a story of injuries and struggle to rise to expectation. Come the next season, Bhaichung Bhutia is determined to make up for his erstwhile failures in green-and-maroon colour. 

There was absolutely no problem with East Bengal, but when Mohun Bagan offered me, I took it as a challenge? Im now hoping to give 110 per cent for them, Bhaichung said over phone from Guwahati on Monday. 

It is true that in the past, when I played for them, I couldnt give hundred per cent due to injuries. So this season, I am fully fit and want to give my best, the India captain added. 

Bhaichung, who has signed a one-year deal with Mohun Bagan, is also looking forward to resume his partnership with the Brazilian Jose Ramirez Barreto. They played together for Mohun Bagan in 2002-2003 season. 

It will be nice playing alongside him (Barreto) again, but I am excited about this Mohun Bagan side? Its a very balanced one, Bhaichung, who was adjudged the National Leagues best player, remarked.

 Hiddink to face charges of tax fraud

Amsterdam: Guus Hiddink, one of the worlds highest profile soccer coaches, will face charges of tax fraud. 

Valentine Hoen, a spokeswoman for the public prosecutors office, said on Wednesday that Hiddink would be prosecuted for tax fraud, but she did not release details about the exact nature of the charges he will face. 

She said the first hearing in the case was scheduled for September 15. 

Authorities raided the offices of Hiddinks accountant in Eindhoven last October as part of a wide probe, but Hiddink angrily denied any wrong-doing. 

Hoen said Hiddinks accountant, Simon van den Boomen who was briefly arrested at he time of the October raids, will also face charges. (AP)

 Roddick clinches first title of year

 - CINCINNATI MASTERS 

 - Paes-Damm bows out in semis 

 Andy Roddick after his win over Fernando Gonzalez in Mason on Saturday 

 Cincinnati: American Andy 

 Roddick overpowered Spaniard Juan Carlos Ferrero 6-3, 6-4 

 on Sunday to win his first title of the year at the Cincinnati 

 Masters.

 In a battle of two former world No. 1s, the ninth seed hammered 

 down 17 aces and dictated play from the start, clinching 

 his 21st career title in just 70 minutes.

 Im so happy I turned it round here in Cincinnati 

 this week, Roddick said.

 Roddick kissed the court, did a lap of the arena and exchanged 

 high fives with fans after wrapping up his fourth Masters 

 Series title.

 In a repeat of the 2003 US Open final, which Roddick won, 

 the American served superbly throughout and never allowed 

 Ferrero a chance to get a foothold in the match.

 Roddick broke serve in the second game but Ferrero, who 

 had beaten James Blake, Rafael Nadal and Tommy Robredo en 

 route to the final, hit back to break in the next game. 

 But Roddick broke again in the next game and held on to 

 take the set before storming to a 5-2 lead in the second.

 Roddick was broken when serving for the match at 5-2 but 

 he made no mistake second time round, hitting three aces 

 in succession to clinch a victory which will lift him back 

 into the top 10 of the world rankings.

 Despite the defeat, Ferrero, who has not won a title since 

 2003, will move back inside the worlds top 20. 

 In the semi-finals on Saturday, Ferrero eased past fellow 

 Spaniard Tommy Robredo 6-3, 6-4 and Roddick outgunned Chilean 

 13th seed Fernando Gonzalez 6-3, 6-3 .

 In doubles action, Leander Paes and Martin Damm of Czech 

 Republic were unable to stretch themselves against second 

 seeds Jonas Bjorkman of Sweden and Belarus Max Mirnyi 

 to bow out in the semi-final. The seventh seeded Indo-Czech 

 pair lost 6-7 (3-7) 2-6.

 After a hard-fought first set, which went into the tie-breaker, 

 Paes and Damm were not able to put up much resistance in 

 the second. The doubles final will be a showdown between 

 the top two pairs as Bjorkman and Mirnyi take on No. 1 seeds 

 Bryan brothers Bob and Mike.

 The Bryan brothers defeated sixth seeded Israeli combination 

 of Jonathan Erlich and Andy Ram 7-6 (7-4), 6-3 in the other 

 semi-final.

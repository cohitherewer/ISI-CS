 - Pak need something special in first clash with SA in Woolmer era

Chandigarh: The Pakistanis arent far from home, but its the South Africans who are getting that at-home feeling. Its a nice cushion in the lead-up to the Champions Trophys unofficial quarter final, Friday, in neighbouring Mohali. 

The at-home feeling, of course, has nothing to do with the ambience of this rapidly-changing city. Rather, the surface at the PCA Stadium is providing Graeme Smith and Co. all the comfort. The Makhaya Ntinis, clearly, must be itching to get on to the park. 

The practice wickets this (Thursday) morning were like home and not becoming gung-ho is going to be important... We cant get carried away... There was juice and carry and we expect to have the same tomorrow, a distinctly pleased Smith remarked. 

While he described Bob Woolmer (who coached South Africa from around the mid-Nineties till the 1999 World Cup) as being clever, Pakistans current coach will have to plot something out of the ordinary if his team is to progress. 

Incidentally, the Mohali face-off is going to be the first between the countries after Woolmer succeeded Javed Miandad in June 2004. Asked if there would be a conflict of emotions, he told The Telegraph: Inevitably, but Im beholden to my paymaster... Ive coached some of the South Africans, yes, but can only look forward to Pakistan making the semi-finals... 

Woolmer has worked with Shaun Pollock, Jacques Kallis, Mark Boucher, Herschelle Gibbs and Ntini. With Jonty Rhodes (the fielding coach) as well. Its to be seen, though, just how much of a factor will Woolmers past be. The stakes are high, he acknowledged. 

If form is a pointer, the South Africans defeated Sri Lanka (a massive boost, in Smiths words) in their last match, while Pakistan lost to New Zealand Wednesday night. That the surface is expected to be fast and bouncy is bound to add to Pakistans pressure. However, having already played in Mohali, they could on paper, at least prepare better. 

Not that the South Africans are taking them lightly. One never takes Pakistan for granted and our feet are on the ground (after the handsome win over Sri Lanka)... Were going to focus on our game plan and attack... Hopefully, well be able to implement that, Smith said. 

Aggression does come somewhat naturally to the South Africans. Smith explained: We play with passion and theres great hunger... Great fight for places, too... International cricket is all about pressure and, if you cant handle it, you shouldnt be there... 

Pakistans stand-in captain Younis Khan is looking to minimise mistakes. We made far too many against New Zealand and let go opportunities... he pointed out. It prompted Woolmer to quip: We would like to change things and put up a sign Normal service is to be resumed soon... Theres much to play for and handling pressure situations is going to be the key... 

Younis failed both versus Sri Lanka and New Zealand, but reasoned it may have had something to do with his concentration getting divided. Thats because of the captaincy and the crisis (doping scandal) he encountered only a few hours before the start of Pakistans campaign. 

Even Ricky Ponting didnt get many runs in the first two matches... Performing at the same (high) level is mushkil with so much cricket being played... But, then, each day is a new one and I wake up smiling... Irrespective of what has happened in the last outing, I remain positive... Thats my nature, Younis maintained. 

According to sources, the Pakistanis are contemplating two changes dropping Shahid Afridi and Rana Naved, and calling up (Javed Miandads nephew) Faisal Iqbal and allrounder Yasir Arafat. The South Africans, one learns, could drop left-arm spinner Robin Peterson and include allrounder Charl Langeveldt. The latter bowls medium-pace. 

Senior pro Kallis, who hurt his right ankle in the last match, is absolutely fit. 

The Pakistanis, meanwhile, are unhappy with the low floodlights at the PCA Stadium. Its a problem, is how Younis put it. The dew, though, has to be the much bigger worry. Its a factor, definitely... Whoever adapts better will win, Smith observed, adding he wouldnt mind losing the toss. 

Younis is probably harbouring the same wish. On Wednesday, he chose to field, but New Zealand didnt slip on the dew. Instead, they marched into the semi-finals.

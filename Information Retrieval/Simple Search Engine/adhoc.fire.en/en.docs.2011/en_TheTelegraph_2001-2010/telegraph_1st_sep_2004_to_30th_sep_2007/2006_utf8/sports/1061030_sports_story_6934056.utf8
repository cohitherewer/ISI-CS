The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Senior steward resigns 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: General (rtrd.) Shankar Roychowdhury, have opted to resign from the post of senior stewardship on Saturday, according to an RCTC notification. J.N.Sapru, another steward in the present five-member body, also put in his papers, paving way for the ex-Davis Cupper, Naresh Kumar, and S.S. Bala to fill in the two vacancies. The two new stewards were co-opted at a stewards meeting held on Sunday.

 The outgoing stewards were under immense pressure since July this year when The Telegraph exposed the financial irregularities in the renovation of the office building at the racecourse. The renovation of the building had cost RCTC about Rs 1.3 crore, an amount most of the club members felt was grossly exaggerated. The club members uproar on the issue had prompted one steward, Sujit Bhattacharyya, to resign from the body.

 Some members had long been demanding resignations of all stewards and asking for fresh elections. However, RCTC insiders revealed that the resignations of Gen. Roychowdhury and ex-ITC supremo were on personal grounds. General Roychowdhury is going to be out of the country till mid-February next year. This being RCTCs turn to host the Invitational races, he desired someone else to take over the responsibility; said an RCTC source.

 P.C. Lall may assume the seniors post; said Cyrus Madan, a steward. 

 However, sources close to Lall, are not quite hopeful about him taking such a huge responsibility on his shoulder owning to ill health.

 The new steward, Kumar (aged 78), is also learnt to be under pressure, to accept the seniors post. He, however, could not be contacted.

 Bala (77), now on a Punjab tour, sounded very excited when his reaction to the induction into the august body was sought. Its an honour. I hope to live up to my fellow stewards expectations; said Bala.

 Bala is, however, going to be back in the city in the third week of November.

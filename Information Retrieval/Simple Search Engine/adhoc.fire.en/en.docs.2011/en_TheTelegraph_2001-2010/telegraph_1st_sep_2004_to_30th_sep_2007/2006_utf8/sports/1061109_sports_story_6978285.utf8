Madrid: Maria Sharapova and Justine Henin-Hardenne, two players contesting the end-of-year No. 1 spot, notched up impressive wins in their first round-robin matches at the WTA Championship on Tuesday. 

US Open champion Sharapova, who came into Madrid on a three-tournament victorious streak, continued her irresistible form with an emphatic 6-1, 6-4 victory over fellow-Russian Elena Dementieva to extend her winning run to 17 matches. 

Defending champion and world No. 1 Amelie Mauresmo, however, lost 2-6, 2-6 to fifth-ranked Russian Nadia Petrova (as reported in Wednesdays Late City edition) in her opening match. 

Henin-Hardenne, back after a two-month layoff following a calf injury, had to dig deep to clinch a 6-2, 6-7, 6-1 win over Martina Hingis in the days most absorbing match. 

The Belgian, guaranteed to end the year as No. 1 if she reaches the final, raced through the first set against Hingis and appeared on course for a comfortable win at 5-2 up in the second. 

But Hingis mounted a furious rearguard action to take the next four games and force a tie-break which she won 7-5. 

Despite her lack of match practice, French Open champion Henin-Hardenne managed to find another gear in the deciding set to ensure a winning return to the court. 

Mauresmo, who had been out of action for 10 days with a shoulder problem, looked rusty against Petrova. 

Petrova, runner-up to Sharapova in Linz last month, quickly cranked up the pressure on Mauresmo and had few problems overcoming the Australian Open and Wimbledon champion. 

Although she leads the rankings, the only way Mauresmo can claim the year-end top spot is if she defends her title and her rivals slip up badly.

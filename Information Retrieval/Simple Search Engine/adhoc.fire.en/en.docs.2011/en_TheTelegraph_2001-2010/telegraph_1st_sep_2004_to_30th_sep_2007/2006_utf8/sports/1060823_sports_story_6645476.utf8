Calcutta: It all started with a dream, seed of which was sown some 34 years ago. Inspired by the epic world championship duel between Bobby Fischer and Boris Spasski in 1972, Ashok Koneru wanted to be a world champion himself. He became the Andhra Pradesh state champion, but was stopped well short of fulfilling his dream due to financial and infrastructural constraints at that time. 

Time has changed since and over three decades down the line, his daughter now the 19-year-old Koneru Humpy is well on course to fulfilling her fathers dream. 

Already the world junior champion, Humpy has her sights firmly fixed on the world title two years from now. This is one big dream Ive been cherishing. The meet will be held in 2008, so theres enough time for me to get prepared and go for the kill, she told The Telegraph on Tuesday. 

If this is her long-term goal, the immediate target is to increase the Elo rating from 2545 to 2600. I want to achieve that mark within 6-8 months, she said, oozing confidence. 

Im going to play a knock-out meet in Lausanne next month. Then Ill participate in the Commonwealth Games in November. See the real battle starts when you become a GM. The competition becomes tougher and gaining upon your Elo ratings becomes a stiff task, she pointed out. 

Incidentally, Judith Polgar whose record Humpy had surpassed in becoming the youngest-ever woman to become a mens GM is her role model. She was a world champion I want to touch that record, she said. 

If the Hungarian legend is her idol, our very own Viswanathan Anand is the 19-year-olds inspiration. He (Anand) is the king of rapid chess and his success in Mainz proved it again. Hes an inspiration to all of us, Humpy maintained. 

She rued that despite the current crop of chess players success in international levels, the game here is devoid of any corporate support. 

 The game needs sponsors immediately. Even a GM has to struggle to get any financial backing. This system should be changed, Humpy, who was employed with ONGC a month ago, signed off.

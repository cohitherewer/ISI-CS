 Kapil refuses to give Chappell credit

Varanasi: Former India captain Kapil Dev on Tuesday rated the Indian side as the best one-day team in the world but refused to give any credit to coach Greg Chappell for the teams success. 

The World Cup winning captain said that the performance of the youngsters was not due to the efforts of the coach alone and instead praised everyone who has been involved with the team for the past three years for transforming it into world beaters. 

If the coach should be credited with the performance of some new players and the team, then he should also be responsible for the current poor form of Virender Sehwag and Mohammed Kaif, said Kapil.

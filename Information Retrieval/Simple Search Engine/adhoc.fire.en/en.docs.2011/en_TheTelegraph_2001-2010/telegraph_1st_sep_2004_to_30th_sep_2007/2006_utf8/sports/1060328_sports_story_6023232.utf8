 Ames cruises to title

 - PLAYERS CHAMPIONSHIP 

 Stephen Ames with the trophy on Sunday 

Ponte Vedra Beach: Canadas Stephen Ames, ice-cool in difficult final-round conditions, cruised to his second PGA Tour title with a six-shot victory at the PGA Players Championship on Sunday. 

He posted a 14-under total of 274 to register a six-shot victory over South African Retief Goosen at the tournament dubbed the unofficial fifth major. 

Despite lightning-fast greens and thick rough at the Stadium Course, the 41-year-old born in Trinidad and Tobago held off some of the biggest names in golf with a five-under-par 67. 

Although Ames made a rare slip-up by double-bogeying the par-four 10th, he reeled off five birdies and an eagle-three at the 16th to finish on 14-under 274. 

After narrowly missing a 24-footer for birdie at the last, he tapped in for par and raised his arms in celebration as he secured the winners cheque for $1.44 million, the richest purse on the PGA Tour. 

This is big, a beaming Ames told reporters after earning a five-year Tour exemption. I beat the top players in the world this week. The fact that 48 of the top 50 players in the world were playing here, thats meaningful. 

I think I put myself in another gear that Ive probably felt a couple of times in my career, but not for four days like I did this week, added the Canadian, whose first Tour victory came at the 2004 Western Open. 

World No. 3 Goosen, four strokes behind overnight, finished second after sinking a 12-foot birdie putt on the final hole for a 69. 

Americans Jim Furyk (72) and Pat Perez (71), Swede Henrik Stenson (73) and PGA Tour rookie Camilo Villegas of Colombia (71) tied for third at five under. 

World No. 2 Vijai Singh and sixth-ranked Sergio Garcia had been tied for second place at the start of the day but the duo dropped back over the opening holes. Fijian Singh eventually signed for a 77 and a tie for eighth at three under. 

Spaniard Garcia, struggling with his putter, fared even worse, ballooning to a 78 to finish at two under. 

Ernie Els made the most significant early run with five birdies in the first 11 holes. However, the big South African then lost ground before carding a 71 to end level with Singh. 

Tiger Woods, never a factor at Sawgrass after considering pulling out because of his fathers failing health, returned a three-over-par 75 to finish at one-over 289. 

It was frustrating in the sense that I threw away so many shots around the greens this week, said the world No. 1. 

This weekend was probably one of my best driving performances all year but I hit my irons terrible and putted even worse.

 Sachin knock draws praise

Cambridge: Sachin Tendulkar has been tipped for a swift return to the top of world cricket after smashing his way to a century in his first match since undergoing shoulder surgery in March. 

Sachin displayed his full range of shots on his way to a knock of 155 from 119 balls for Lashings World XI in a match against Cambridge University on Wednesday. 

Former Pakistan captain Rashid Latif believes the 33-year-old Sachin could have several rich batting years ahead of him. Great batting talent never dies, he said. Steve Waugh played until 38 and Graham Gooch too played great cricket late in his career.

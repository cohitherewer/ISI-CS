The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 I showed maturity out there: Prakash

 - Being positive turned the tide around, says 22-year old 

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Chennai: For some years now, Prakash Amritraj had been trying very hard. Not only to make a mark on the big stage, more importantly to live up to the famous surname. 

And when he did notch up what many feel is a significant victory ? in the first round of the Chennai Open on a pleasant Monday ? Vijays son was remarkably cool at the post-match press conference. 

It was one of my better results considering the situation ? to be able to finish the match in the third set stronger than I was in the first, was very satisfying, especially as there had been question marks over my fitness, said the articulate 22-year-old. 

Also, its always difficult to play the best at a place where you desperately want to do well ? I think I showed signs of maturity out there today (Monday), was Prakashs self-assessment. 

Unlike many others, however, he doesnt think he has made that big breakthrough yet. Beating a guy close to the top-100 is definitely a good step forward, but if I can keep this level going, hopefully that break will come sometime this year, Prakash remarked. 

What was dads advice before he came on court? He said its easy to get caught up with whats happening all round you, a lot of familiar faces ? he just wanted me to stay focused and concentrate on the basics, Prakash revealed. 

And how did he turn it around after a pretty dismal first set? Yeah, it looked pretty bad for a while. I served flat, missed some shots. I realized I had to come up to the net more often. I did that by being a bit more positive and that seemed to work. 

Rohan Bopanna, the days other big winner, was delighted with his efforts. 

It obviously feels great to win three matches and qualify for the main draw, especially as this is the first time Ive done it, said the tall 25-year-old who looked normal in comparison to his six-foot-six opponent Rajeev Ram. 

 He has a big serve but I was able to read it. Also the fact that he is a baseliner helped me penetrate his defence, explained Bopanna, who takes on Cyril Saulnier on Tuesday.

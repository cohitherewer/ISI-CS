Madrid: Mahesh Bhupathi and his American partner James Blake made an early exit from the Madrid Masters after losing to the Israeli pair of Jonathan Erlich and Andy Ram 6-0, 6-3 in the first round. 

The Israelis wrapped up the first set in just 19 minutes. 

The Indo-American duo tried to get over the early setback and broke the Israelis in the third game to take a 2-1 lead. However, the Israeli pair broke back immediately before pocketing three of the next four games to romp home without any real challenge from their opponents. 

On Tuesday, world No. 1 Roger Federer made an authoritative start to his bid to win his 10th title of the year when he saw off the combative Chilean Nicolas Massu 6-3, 6-2. 

There was a narrow escape for fourth seed David Nalbandian who had to fight his way back from 5-2 down in the third set to beat off a determined challenge from French qualifier Julien Benneteau, winning through 6-7, 6-2, 7-5. 

The Argentine now faces an intriguing third-round clash against former British No. 1 Tim Henman who upset Spanish 14th seed David Ferrer 6-1, 4-6, 6-1. 

Former winner Marat Safin, who beat Nalbandian in the 2004 final, also had to overcome stiff resistance from Jose Acasuso before claiming a 7-6, 6-7, 6-3 win over the Argentine. The Russian will now play Marcos Baghdatis of Cyprus in the second round. 

Massu, who reached the Madrid final in 2003 but is unseeded this year, played some fine aggressive tennis in the opening set against Federer, but the top seed made so few errors that the Chilean struggled to find any chinks in his armour. 

Federer, playing in Madrid for the first time in three years, found his rhythm almost immediately on the rapid hard court surface and soon settled into playing his trademark compact tennis. 

The Swiss broke once in the first set and twice in the second to extend his winning streak to 15 matches. 

I think I played the big points better than he did which made it easier for me, said Federer. If I hadnt done that, it could have turned out much harder, but it was a perfect result. 

He will play the winner of the match between Spains former No. 1 Juan Carlos Ferrero and Robin Soderling of Sweden in the third round. 

Sixth seed Andy Roddick took full advantage of his powerful serve to see off ebastien Grosjean 6-4, 7-6.

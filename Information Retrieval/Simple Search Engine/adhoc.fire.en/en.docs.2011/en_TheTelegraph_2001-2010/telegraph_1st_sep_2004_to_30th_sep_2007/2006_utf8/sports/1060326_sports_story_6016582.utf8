 Jadeja on air from field

Jaipur: It may be unusual for a captain to share his views with the television audience when right in the middle of action on the cricket field but that is what exactly Ajay Jadeja did on Saturday. 

The RCA Presidents XI captain in the one-day practice match against England, was hooked up with the commentary panel even as he went about his duties ? making the bowling changes and fielding adjustments during the visitors run chase. 

A wired up Jadeja talked about introducing spinners with commentator Laxman Sivaramakrishnan during the first-class game. (PTI)

 Vijayan in deep waters

 Vijayan 

New Delhi: For someone who is aware of I.M. Vijayans popularity and influence in Kerala, it is simply difficult to believe that the former India skipper has gone underground in his hometown Thrissur for the past four days. 

But having got involved in an alleged case of assault and rioting, the black deer of Indian football is in deep waters. So much so, that Vijayan has yet not made a public appearance, preferring to remain in hiding even after he was granted an anticipatory bail by the district session court on Thursday. 

Throughout Friday, Vijayans cell phone remained switched off and even his close friends could not contact him. Jo Paul Ancheri, his long-time partner in the national team, said: I could talk to him for a couple of minutes day before yesterday on phone. Vijayan said he was in Chennai and busy in a film shooting. He promised me to call later, but never did so. 

Kerala Football Association sources said Vijayan is in Thrissur, but is scared of coming out in public. He is certainly going to be in trouble once he comes out. He and his friends assaulted some workers of a bar-cum-hotel. The owner of the hotel is a powerful man and is not going to leave it so easily. 

Sources said that on August 13, a nephew of Vijayan visited the Bini Hotel in Thrissur for dinner and had minor altercation with the hotel staff. On the same night at 3 am, Vijayan, packed with friends in two Quails cars, came to the hotel and demanded an explanation from the owner of the hotel, V.K. Asokan. It finally broke into a full-fledged fight between the two groups and Vijayans men allegedly beat up some of the hotel staff. 

The owner of the hotel, KFA sources said, is a follower of Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana Yogam, a powerful religious and social organization.

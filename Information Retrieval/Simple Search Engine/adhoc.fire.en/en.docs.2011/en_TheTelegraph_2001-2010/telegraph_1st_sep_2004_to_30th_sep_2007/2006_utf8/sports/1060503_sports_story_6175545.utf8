 No surprises in probables list

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Azlan Shah Hockey

New Delhi: After days of 

 dilly-dallying, the Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) finally 

 came out with the list of probables for the Azlan Shah hockey 

 tournament to be played in Kuala Lumpur from June 18 to 

 25. 

 While the fitness camp 

 (as described by the IHF) started in Bangalore on Tuesday 

 and players were told to report almost a week back, IHF 

 refused to release the names till Monday saying it has not 

 been decided yet. Going by the list, there are not many 

 surprises among the probables except the fact that Indian 

 Airlines midfielder Vinay VS has been brought back after 

 being dropped from the Commonwealth Games team. 

 Also to be re-called is another 

 Airlines midfielder Bimal Lakra. While questions can be 

 raised about the inclusion of Tamil Nadu forward Adam Sinclair 

 and Western Railways Shivendra Singh, IHF, it seems, 

 has made it a point to include almost everyone who has represented 

 the national team in the last one year.

 Four players ? Dilip Tirkey, Sandeep 

 Singh, Gagan Ajit Singh and NitinKumar ? are still busy 

 playing in the Dutch league and have not joined the camp, 

 which will be held till May 17. The camp then will be shifted 

 to Chennai.

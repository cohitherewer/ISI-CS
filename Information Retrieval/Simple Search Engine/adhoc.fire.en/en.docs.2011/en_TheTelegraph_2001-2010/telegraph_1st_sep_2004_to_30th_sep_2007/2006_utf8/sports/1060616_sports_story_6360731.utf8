 Day V highlights

 Lara and Dravid in Gros Islet after the 

 second Test ended in a draw on Wednesday

 It was the 34th instance 

 of rival captains scoring centuries in the same Test. Rahul 

 Dravid scored 146, while Brian Lara made 120. Only twice 

 before have both captains made hundreds in India-West Indies 

 Tests ? Sunil Gavaskar (205) amp; Alvin Kallicharran (187) 

 in Bombay, 1978-79; Dilip Vengsarkar (102) and Viv Richards 

 (109*) in Delhi, 1987-88 

 Laras 120 brought 

 him on par with Steve Waughs tally of 32 Test centuries. 

 Only Sachin Tendulkar (35) and Sunny Gavaskar (34) have 

 more three-figure knocks 

 It was Laras second 

 hundred against India in 15 Tests spanning over nine years. 

 He had made 103 in St Johns way back in April, 1997 

 The century by Lara was 

 his 12th as captain in 42 Tests. Only Allan Border, Steve 

 Waugh (15 each), Don Bradman, Clive Lloyd (14 each) and 

 Greg Chappell (13) have more three-figure scores as captain 

 The century was Laras 17th at home in 

 63 Tests, which equalled the tally of Matthew Hayden in 

 41 home matches. Only Don Bradman has made more home centuries 

 ? 18 in 33 Tests 

 Of the 25 times India have 

 enforced the follow-on in their Test history, they have 

 drawn 10 times. The West Indies, who were following on for 

 the 23rd time, have drawn six of those games

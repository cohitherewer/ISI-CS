 Hanif has surgery on both knees

Karachi: Former Pakistan captain Hanif Mohammed has undergone surgery on both knees after feeling paralysis in his lower body. The 71-year old was admitted to hospital earlier this week. I could not put any weight on my legs at all. I suffered acute pain in the knees and the lower body had stopped functioning, Hanif said on Friday from his hospital bed. 

Doctors carried out a surgery on both his knees to remove fluid and bone pieces that caused the problem. (REUTERS)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Of cold cuts and hot stuff...

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Chandigarh: The Punjab Cricket Association (PCA) has put the England teams security officer in his place. 

According to The Telegraphs sources, the gentleman instructed the hosts of the second Test to limit the dressing room waiters to two. The PCA did that, on Thursday, but made it clear that largely cold cuts would be served. 

However, the Andrew Flintoffs wanted hot stuff and, so, two more waiters were deployed (for heating etc.) on Friday. The PCA had its way and a senior official asked the security officer to not cross his area of expertise.

 Sir Bobby still playing the global game 

 - Decades on, he isnt weary of recalling the events of July 30, 1966 

 ROBERT PHILIP

Memorably described by Jimmy Hill as the most famous Englishman in the world, a 68-year-old son of a Northumberland coal miner is revered as a living god in countries where Prince Charles and Tony Blair are unheard of. 

On one occasion, when Sir Bobby Charlton flew to Beijing to accompany the Chinese under-18 squad on a tour of England, his arrival was watched by a TV audience of 300 million. Far more, an awe-struck government official recklessly revealed, than ever switched on for Chairman Maos meandering sermons. 

We have followed him from boyhood to knighthood: his return home from the Munich air disaster, the trademark tracer-bullet goals, blinking back the tears with him as he greeted Sir Alf and Sir Matt at their moments of glory. Geoff Hurst may have scored a hattrick against West Germany, but it was Bobby Charlton who touched the hearts of mankind. 

To tell him how special he is to us, however, is to reduce him to mumbling incoherence: Oh, I dont know... I appreciate the sentiment... I was lucky I was good at the game... yes, it is nice to be loved by perfect strangers... but its difficult, quite difficult. ...youve got to behave yourself all the time... funnily enough, Ive never considered myself solely English ? or British for that matter ? Im just a human being. Ive had unbelievable benefits because I get invited places most people can only dream about. 

For decades, Sir Bobby has been a global ambassador for the game that brought him tragedy and triumph. Some people use football for their own ends ? power, politics, whatever ? and some use it for financial reasons; but if its used in the right way, then football is a fantastic means of communication. 

Ive seen pitches in places where youd never think it was possible to play football. In Indonesia we came across a field ? with all the correct lines ? but with 20 palm trees scattered higgledy-piggledy about the pitch. The players had to dribble round them. Ever since, Ive been taking pictures of games played in unusual surroundings. 

In Senegal, on the spot where six million slaves were shipped, theres a shrine covered with messages from their American descendants. Its really very, very moving. And squeezed into the middle of all this is a crazily-shaped football pitch. The two sets of goalposts are out of alignment and one of the corner flags is on the other side of a stone wall. So when you take a corner, youve got to scale this bloomin great wall before you can rejoin the game. 

But let us return to Hampden Park, Glasgow, on April 19, 1958 when Sir Bobby won the first of his 106 caps. There were 134,000 there that day and I reckon 133,999 must have been Scots. To be honest, Id probably been picked to play for England too soon ? I was only 20 ? but I think, because of Munich, they felt sorry for me. Imagine me on the same team as Tom Finney? 

Id been a United reserve two months earlier. I was almost too embarrassed to go over and say thanks when Tom delivered the pass for my goal. There were no England fans, so all you could hear was the silence. I can still hear the sound of the leather ball lashing against the old net. As I was running back to the centre circle I felt something tugging at my shirt. I looked round and it was the Scottish goalkeeper, Tommy Younger. Good goal, son, he says, good goal. 

Forty summers on, does Sir Bobby ever weary of recalling the events of July 30, 1966, and Englands historic 4-2 victory in the greatest World Cup final of them all? Oh, no, not at all. As soon as the whistle went I said to my brother, You know, Jack, life for us will never be the same again. And I was right. From that moment since, theres never been a day when it hasnt been mentioned. Kids come up to me all over the world when Im coaching and ask [awed whisper], Did you play in the World Cup final? or Did you score a hat-trick? And Ive got to say, No, that was Geoff Hurst. 

You have to remember Sir Alf had made sure wed been cosseted well away from the public gaze, so wed no idea how the whole of England had become gripped with World Cup fever. It was only after we won, and were driving back from Wembley through Notting Hill on the open-topped bus, that it began to dawn on us what it meant to everyone. People were hanging out from every open window.

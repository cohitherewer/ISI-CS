 State boxing gets underway today

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: World womens boxing champion M.C. Mary Kom will be the first pugilist to fight in the international standard ring at the Body Guard Lines on Friday. The ring will be inaugurated by city police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee just before the 53rd State Boxing Championships get underway. 

Former Commonwealth gold medallist Mohammed Ali Qamar will participate in the state meet for Railways. 

Apart from Mary Kom, the 36-member Indian squad, currently honing their skills at the SAI Eastern Centre for an international meet to be held in Hungary later this month, will also demonstrate their skills. 

Computerised scoring will make its debut at the state meet on Friday.

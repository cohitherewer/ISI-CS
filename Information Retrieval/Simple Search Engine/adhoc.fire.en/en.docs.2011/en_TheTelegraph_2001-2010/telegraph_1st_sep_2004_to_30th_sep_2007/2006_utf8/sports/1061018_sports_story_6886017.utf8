 Shoaib was reluctant to give samples

Karachi: Shoaib Akhtar, who tested positive for a banned steroid Nandrolone, seemed reluctant to give his urine samples during the dope test conducted by the Pakistan Cricket Board in September, according to a well-placed source. 

When the tests were being carried out, Shoaib was the last player to give his urine samples rather reluctantly. His attitude even than had left the board officials surprised, the source said. 

Meanwhile, accusing the ICC of being lethargic in addressing doping concerns, the international players association (Fica) has said lack of education about its anti-doping policy could end up ruining many careers. 

Unfortunately, the games lethargy in addressing this matter may have contributed to two young men ruining their careers and reputations, Fica chief executive Tim May said. (Agencies)

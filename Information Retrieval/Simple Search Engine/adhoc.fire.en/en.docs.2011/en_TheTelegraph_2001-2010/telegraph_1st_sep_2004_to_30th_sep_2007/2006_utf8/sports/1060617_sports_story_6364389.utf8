 Sania loses in doubles too 

Birmingham: Sania Mirzas campaign at the $200,000 DFS Classic came to an end after she lost the first round of the doubles event here on Friday. 

The Indian, partnering Francesca Schiavone of Italy, lost to Elena Vesnina of Russia and Chinese Zi Yan 6-4, 2-6, 2-6 in one hour 44 minutes. 

The Indo-Italian pair, seed No. 3 wasted their first set lead and was completely off-colour in the subsequent sets, allowing Vesnina and Yan to stage a comeback by breaking their higher-rated opponents twice. 

Sanias campaign in the singles had ended with her third-round defeat to American qualifier Meilen Tu. 

Sania, who refused to speak to the press after her defeat, later said in a press release that cramps had contributed to her defeat. (PTI)

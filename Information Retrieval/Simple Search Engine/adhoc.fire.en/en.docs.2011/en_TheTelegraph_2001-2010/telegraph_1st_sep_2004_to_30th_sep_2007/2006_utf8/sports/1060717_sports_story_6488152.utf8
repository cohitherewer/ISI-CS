 Atapattu ruled out 

Colombo: Sri Lankan captain Maravan Atapattu has been ruled out of the upcoming Test series against South Africa as well as the tri-series involving India after he failed to recover form a back injury, chief selector Ashantha de Mel said on Sunday. 

Atapattu has not played since March because of an acute disc problem in his lower back but had hoped to return for the two Tests against South Africa and a one-day Tri-Series also involving India in August. 

The 35-year-old travelled to Australia in May for surgery on the career-threatening injury but the rehabilitation process has been slower than expected. 

Maravan needs time to rehabilitate and strengthen his back, De Mel said. 

He is very eager to get back on the field but we do not want to rush him back into the team until he is 100 percent fit, he added. 

We have had a chat together and have decided to target the ICC Champions Trophy in October.

 Weather may mar Pak pitch plan

Lahore: Wet and foggy weather may mar Pakistans plans of preparing hard pitches during this months home series against rivals India, Pakistans chief curator said on Tuesday. 

Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq had asked the authorities to prepare bouncy tracks during the January 5-February 19 series, to make use of Pakistans strong pace attack against a formidable Indian batting line-up. 

 We are trying our level best, but the foggy weather and wet conditions are not ideal for bouncy tracks, because a pitch takes time to dry, curator Agha Zahid said. 

Lahore and Faisalabad, where the first two Tests will be held, have been in the grip of extremely damp weather, but the meteorological department said conditions would improve later this week. 

 We need three days of sunshine to dry the pitch. It would be a problem in Lahore and Faisalabad, but the clear weather in Karachi will help us prepare a suitable pitch, Zahid said. (AFP)

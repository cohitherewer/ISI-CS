 Sarfraz: I can detect it from 1000 

 yards 

 Ball Tampering

 Sarfraz Nawaz 

 Islamabad: Former Pakistan 

 fast bowler Sarfraz Nawaz said on Tuesday he was able to 

 detect ball tampering from 1,000 yards (metres) away and 

 offered cricket chiefs his services to stop the practice.

 Nawaz, hailed as the pioneer of 

 reverse swinging the ball during his heyday in the early 

 1970s and 1980s, said tampering was out of control in the 

 modern game and called on world cricket chiefs to act.

 I can catch a player or 

 bowler tampering from 1,000 yards, said Nawaz, who 

 played 55 Tests and 45 one-dayers for Pakistan.

 It is rampant at the international 

 level and its the incompetence of the umpires who 

 cannot catch tampering. I offer my services to the International 

 Cricket Council (ICC) to stop this.

 Tampering returned to haunt cricket 

 during Augusts fourth Test at The Oval between Pakistan 

 and England, which snowballed to become one of the games 

 most bitter episodes.

 Nawaz said he did not believe 

 that Pakistan would have been foolish enough to tamper with 

 the ball. Despite possessing reverse swing talent 

 Pakistan have been accused of tampering (in the past), so 

 they would have been foolish to do so with so much witch-hunting 

 against them, Nawaz said.

 Humpy marches into Round II

Ekaterinburg (Russia): Grandmaster Koneru Humpy gave yet another fine display to beat Woman Grandmaster Tuduetso Sabure of Botswana 2-0 to march in to the second round of the World Womens Chess Championship here. 

International Master S. Vijayalakshmi was the other Indian to advance to the second round of the 64-players event being played on a knockout basis after she drew with Irina Berezina of Australia. 

Other Indian in the fray, S. Meenakshi bowed out of the event following her second successive loss against Russian talent Tatiana Kosintseva in the $450000 championship that carries the winners purse of $60000. 

Even as most of the fancied went through to the second round, Ukrainian sensation Kateryna Lahno suffered a shocking ouster in the first round itself as she lost the return game against Karen Zapata of Peru. 

Defending champion Antoaneta Stefanova was seen struggling for some time against lowest ranked Amina Mezioud of Algeria before finally settling for a draw to win the match by a 1.5-0.5 margin. 

Highest rated player in the event, Humpy won her second straight game to cruise to the second round. For the second day running, Sabure proved no match for the wily Indian girl and lost her way while trying to work through complexities of a Sicilian Paulsen. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Of Indian prayers and a miracle...

 - First ODI gets underway an hour behind schedule 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Kingston: The prayers of 

 dozens of Indians, settled in the US, must have played a 

 huge role in the one-day series actually getting underway 

 just an hour behind schedule. Even at breakfast, on Thursday, 

 it had seemed match No. 1 would be rained off. In 2002, 

 not a ball was bowled in the two ODIs scheduled at Sabina 

 Park. 

Miraculously, the downpour stopped and the Jamaican capital got its fiercest sunshine of the week. This dramatic change led to cheering at the Hilton, where most of the fans have put up for the two matches here. 

 The Indians have come from (among 

 other places) Atlanta, Connecticut and George Bushs 

 Texas. One group, in fact, is calling itself the Bharat 

 Barmy Army. Its a delight that the action has 

 begun... Imagine going back after watching only one ODI, 

 an Atlanta-based Gujarati told The Telegraph. 

Kingston does have Indians, but the full-throated support as the series began came from those settled in the US. 

Team India, meanwhile, is a lot more comfortable at the Hilton. Not that the service has improved, but the head chef (who joined a couple of days ago) is from Hyderabad. Thanks to Vijay Bhaskar, the Rahul Dravids even have the option of idlis for breakfast. 

Bhaskar has a special menu for the team, which is finalised after a chat with trainer Greg King. The head chef, though, is keeping a low profile as he cant oblige those whove come from the US. 

Team Indias presence here, by the way, has coincided with the National Council for Indian Culture in Jamaicas celebrations to commemorate 161 years of the Indians arrival in the country.

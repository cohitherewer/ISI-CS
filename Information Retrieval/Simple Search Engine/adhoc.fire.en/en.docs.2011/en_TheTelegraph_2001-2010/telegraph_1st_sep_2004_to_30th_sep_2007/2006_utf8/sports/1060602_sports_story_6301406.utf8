 Sehwag must plan his innings: Viv

 - Hope to see Sachin one last time in Caribbean during World Cup 

 India depend a lot on Sehwag, feels Viv 

St Johns: West Indian batting legend Vivian Richards wants Virender Sehwag to be more methodical in his batting and produce the goods for his team, which he thinks relies heavily on the opener. 

Sehwag must step up the plate and learn to plan his innings. He has beautiful eyes and in full flow is one of the most destructive batsman anywhere in the world. But India depend heavily on him and how he performs, said the iconic Richards. 

This Indian team has ability. Somebody like V.V.S. Laxman adds extra experience to the side which it probably missed in the one-day International series, he said in an interview. 

On Dravid, the former West Indies captain said, he is one of the best batsman in the game. But I would say Sehwag at the top of the order must produce results for it can make India go places. 

I am also impressed by Dhoni and I think he is an exciting talent. 

Richards conveyed his disappointment on not being able to witness Sachin Tendulkar in action in the forthcoming Test series. 

Its a great loss to people of this region. I personally am a great fan of Tendulkar. Its sad but I wish him speedy recovery. 

I hope the people of Caribbean would at least see him for one last time when the World Cup is staged here next year. 

The former West Indies captain has no doubt that Tendulkar still has some good years of cricket left in him. 

He still is a very good player. The last few years havent been good for him but I have little doubt that he would still make an impact for the Indian team. 

The team also needs him since there are a lot of young cricketers. 

Richards declined to compare himself with incumbent captain Brian Lara. 

Everyone is different and thats the beauty of the game. Lara is different from Viv and that perhaps gives the game its flavour. 

After the one-day games against India, it is beginning to look that we can have a very competitive side for the 2007 World Cup. 

In the Caribbean, cricket has to compete with a lot of other sports. But India came here as No.3 team in the world and we were No.8, but the West Indies were still able to accomplish the win, he said. 

Its the sort of confidence they need to move forward, Richards said. 

Richards said that life after retirement has been as hectic as it was when he was playing. 

I thought after retirement I would be able to put my feet up and relax. But things have only got busier and busier.

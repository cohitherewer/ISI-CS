 Brazil are feared: Zagallo

Sao Paulo: Brazils veteran technical director Mario Zagallo believes all the other World Cup teams fear facing the world champions. 

Everyone is afraid to play Brazil, thats the reality and Im sure of it, the 74-year-old said on Monday. 

I certainly wouldnt want to be on the other side, he said during an event in Sao Paulo. The ones who say that Brazil are favourites are fearful, theyre trying to shirk their responsibi-lities. 

Brazil have won the World Cup five times and Zagallo, who coached them to success in 1970 and was also at the helm in 1974 and 1998, said nobody wants them to win again in Germany. 

Of course, they dont want us to win. Were the only country who could become six-time champions and that would put a great distance between us and the rest. 

A win against Brazil is as good as winning the whole tournament, he added.

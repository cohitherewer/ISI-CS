 Ukraine cant be complacent 

 - Theres hope and thats important, says Tunisia coach Lemerre 

Berlin: Ukraine, who need to defeat Tunisia on Friday to be certain of reaching the last 16 of the World Cup, cannot afford any complacency against their Group H opponents. 

Tunisia gave group leaders Spain a fright in Stuttgart on Monday, taking an early lead before Luis Aragones side fought back to win 3-1. 

A draw is likely to be enough for Ukraine, barring a freak result between Spain and Saudi Arabia, but captain Andriy Shevchenko said his team would be going for victory. 

I dont think any player who goes on the pitch ever plays for a draw because he knows how that can end up, the 2004 European Footballer of the Year said. Weve got a very tough game ahead. 

A win for Ukraine would set up a second-round clash with France, South Korea or Switzerland. Tunisia, however, could also qualify for the last 16 with a victory. 

After an embarrassing 4-0 drubbing at the hands of Spain in the opening match, Ukraine bounced back with an identical scoreline against Saudi Arabia. 

Shevchenko, who recently returned after a month out with a knee injury, scored Ukraines third and set up the fourth for Man of the Match Maxim Kalinichenko. 

Chelseas new striker said Kalinichenko was an important player for his country. My game depends very much on him, Shevchenko said. 

He provided a superb pass for my goal and then I thanked him by setting one up for him. 

Tunisia coach Roger Lemerre was disappointed his players faded at the end of the game against Spain and in their 2-2 draw with Saudi Arabia. 

But he suggested he would not be making many changes to his line-up. Theres hope and thats important, Lemerre said. 

There is cause to be optimistic.

 Surya Sekhar in second spot

Visakhapatnam: International Master Deepan Chakravarthy maintained his slender half-point lead with a cautious draw against Grandmaster R. B. Ramesh in the 19th round of 43rd National A Chess Championship. 

On a day that had just one decisive game, GM Abhijit Kunte was the sole winner when he defeated Himanshu Sharma in a keenly-contested game. 

Chakravarthy took his tally to 13.5 points out of a possible 17 and remained a half point adrift of nearest rival defending champion Surya Shekhar Ganguly. Surya did not take any risk with GM Koneru Humpy and signed truce quite early in the game. Surya remained on the sole second spot on 13 points. 

The third place is jointly held by Humpy, GM Sandipan Chanda and Diwakar Prasad Singh who had a bye in this round. 

In the 32nd womens National A being held simultaneously, WGM Swati Ghate inched closer to the crown with an eventful draw with WGM D. Harika. While Ghate took her tally to 12.5 points in this section, Mary Ann Gomes (11.5) remained on the second spot when she too was held to a draw by Kiran Manisha Mohanty. The third place in this nail-biting event is jointly held by WGMs S. Meenakshi and Nisha Mohota who both have 11 points while a close fifth at this stage is D. Harika who is on 10.5 points. Abhijit Kunte was the sole winner in the main event.

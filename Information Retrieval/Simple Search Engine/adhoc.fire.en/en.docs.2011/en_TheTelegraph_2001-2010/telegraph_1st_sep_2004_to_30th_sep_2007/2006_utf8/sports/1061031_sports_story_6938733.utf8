The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Paris: World No. 1 Roger Federer has pulled out of the Paris Masters tournament which started on Monday, saying he was exhausted, organisers said. The top seed, who celebrated a first title in his home town in the Swiss Indoors tournament in Basel on Sunday, is expected to be back in action for the season-ending Masters Cup from November 12 to 19 in Shanghai.

 Federer, who has never won in the French capital and misses the event for the third year in a row, became the latest and most prominent casualty of a tournament now missing five of the worlds top six players. World No. 2 Rafael Nadal pulled out on Sunday with a stomach muscle injury, joining world No. 3 David Nalbandian, world No. 4 Ivan Ljubicic and world No. 6 Andy Roddick.

 Melbourne: Nikolay Davydenko became the fifth player to secure his place in the season-ending $3.7 million Masters Cup in Shanghai, the ATP said on Monday.

 The 25-year-old Russian, who reached the semis on his Masters Cup debut last season, joins Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, Ivan Ljubicic and Andy Roddick in the confirmed eight-player line-up for the November 12-19 season finale at the Qi Zhong Stadium.

 The US Open semi-finalist secured his place despite a second-round exit at his home tournament in St Petersburg last week with four players now unable to surpass his position at fifth in the ATP 2006 race standings.

 Sydney: Frenchman Sebastien Loeb clinched his third world rally championship on Sunday when Marcus Gronholm finished fifth behind Finnish compatriot Mikko Hirvonen in the Rally of Australia.

 Loeb was forced to skip the rally after breaking his arm in a cycling accident earlier this month but secured the title with two rounds to go when his last remaining rival bowed out of contention.

 To win the title is a very nice feeling, Loeb said in a telephone interview from his home. Luckily for me, I had a good number of points before I had my accident.

 Stellenbosch (South Africa): Joost Luiten had an eagle and four birdies on the final five holes to give The Netherlands the title with an improbable two-stroke victory over Canada on Sunday in the World Amateur Team Championship.

 The 20-year-old Luiten finished with a 5-under 67, and teammate Wil Besseling added a 70 to take individual honours at 13-under 275. With only the top two scores from the three-man team counting in the total, the Dutch finished at 22-under 544.

 Madrid: Real Madrid striker Antonio Cassano has been suspended from training after an incident following the Primera Liga match against Gimnastic in Tarragona on Saturday, the club said in a statement on Monday. 

 Real said Cassano, who spent the game on the bench, had shown a lack of respect for coach Fabio Capello after the game but gave no details of the incident.

 Detroit: Kenyas Josephat Ongeri won the Detroit Free Press/Flagstar Bank Marathon on Sunday, beating 2005 champion Andrei Gordeev of Belarus by four seconds. Ongeri finished in 2::18:22. 

 Elena Orlova, a 36-year-old Russian who lives near Washington DC, took the womens race for the second time in three years, finishing in 2::41:26.

 Chanda runs out of steam vs Gurevich

 - Saptarshi holds Swiss GM, Surya wins 

 Kunte defeated IM Gerard Welling 

Gibraltar: Grandmaster Sandipan Chanda went down to Turkish GM Mikhail Gurevich in the seventh round of the gibtele.com Masters Chess tournament here at the Caleta Hotel. 

Having done quite well in the tournament so far, Chanda fell prey to some magnificent endgame display by the experienced Gurevich who has recently qualified to the candidates stage of the next World Championship match tournament from World Chess Cup. 

Chanda thus remained on 4.5 points after seven games, while former world junior champion Kiril Georgiev of Bulgaria emerged as the sole leader with six points. Georgiev defeated Viktor Bologan of Moldova. 

A half point behind the leader is a group of five players including Gurevich, while former GM Abhijit Kunte is amongst the next group of 10 players who are all on five points. Kunte defeated International Master Gerard Welling of The Netherlands to add to his overnight score. 

Among other Indians in the fray, IM Saptarshi Roy Chowdhury held GM Yannick Pelletier of Switzerland. 

IM S. Kidambi, on the other hand, was forced to split points with Gary Quillon of England. Tejas Bakre also drew his game with Zahar Efimenko of Ukraine, albeit after a little drama over rules. Apart from Kunte, only Surya Sekhar Ganguly was able to register a victory amongst Indian men. The national champion defeated womens national champion Nisha Mohota. 

The Indian eves had a mixed day with Mohota, Kruttika Nadig, Mary Ann Gomes and Nimmy George tasting defeat, while the older lot of Bhgyashree Thipsay, Anupama Gokhale and Swati Ghate emerged victorious. 

Gurevich employed the English opening as white against Chanda who had a bishop and knight against Gurevichs double bishops that spat fire all over the board. 

 The game lasted 65 moves. 

Playing white against Efimenko, Tejas claimed a three fold repetition of position in an equal endgame where he had no chances. The arbiters had to intervene as the claim was wrong as per rules. Tejas, however, did not relent easily, claiming that it was a draw due to the position being a photographic repetition of position. 

Kunte played a fine attacking game to beat Welling. The Indian GM sacrificed a rook in the middle game to rip apart Dutchmans king side and it took him just 30 moves to register a smooth victory.

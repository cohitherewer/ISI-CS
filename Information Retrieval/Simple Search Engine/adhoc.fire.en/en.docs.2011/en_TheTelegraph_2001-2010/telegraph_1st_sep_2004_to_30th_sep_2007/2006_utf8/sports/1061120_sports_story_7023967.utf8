The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Hearing to resume today

Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board is peeved at the negative campaign being run to influence the working of the dope commission which is slated to hear the appeals of fast bowlers Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Asif in Lahore Monday. 

In the last two days, an aggressive campaign has been launched in some quarters, including the Pakistan Medical Association, against the doping ban on both bowlers. 

The board suspects that some of its own members, even those on the appeals tribunal, have leaked stories claiming that the PCB had violated anti-doping regulations of the World Anti-Doping Agency while conducting the tests before the Champions Trophy. 

One of the appeals tribunal member, former Test cricketer, Hasib Ahsan has also been quoted as saying that it was not mandatory for PCB to carry out such tests and that the PCB has also not fulfilled the WADA regulations. (PTI)

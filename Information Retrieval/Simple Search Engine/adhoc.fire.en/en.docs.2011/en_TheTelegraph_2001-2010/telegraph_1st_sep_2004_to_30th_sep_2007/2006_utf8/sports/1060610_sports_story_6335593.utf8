 Sehwag had apologised 

immediately

Gros Islet: A day after Virender Sehwag was fined for prematurely celebrating a dismissal, it has emerged that the Indian vice-captain had immediately apologised to the on-field umpire. 

Sehwag persisted a bit long in his appeal against Dwayne Bravo, ultimately upheld by umpire Asad Rauf, but he was quick to apologise to the umpire at the end of his over during the drawn first Test in Antigua. 

But it is learnt that the other on-field umpire Simon Taufel, standing at square leg, felt the apology was not enough and wanted to press the matter. 

The matter was pressed and Sehwag was fined 20 per cent of his match fee.

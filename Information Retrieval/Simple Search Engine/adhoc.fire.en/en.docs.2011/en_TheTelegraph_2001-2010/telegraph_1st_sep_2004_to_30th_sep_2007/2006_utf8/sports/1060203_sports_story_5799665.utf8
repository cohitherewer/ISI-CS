 Rossi can make it: Schumi

 Michael Schumacher 

London: Motorcycling world champion Valentino Rossi can make the leap to Formula One, according to Ferraris Michael Schumacher. 

Absolutely, its completely possible for him, the seven-time champion told a French newspaper on Thursday. 

He has enough talent to get there. I would even say that it is easier to go from bikes to cars than the other way round, added the German, who tested a Ducati MotoGP bike last year after Rossi had driven his Ferrari. 

And when, like him, you have this special feeling on two wheels, you can use it perfectly on four wheels. 

Rossi, 26, was in his third and final day of his most serious test yet with Ferrari on Thursday, taking to the track alongside other Formula One drivers at the Valencia circuit in eastern Spain. 

The Italian won rave reviews for his performance on Wednesday when he lapped little more than a second slower than Schumacher and faster than six other drivers after an embarrassing spin on Tuesday. Rossi astonishes, declared an Italy sports paper in a front page headline, with drivers applauding the MotoGP champion. 

Its nice that hes driving with us, said BMWs Canadian Jacques Villeneuve, the 1997 champion. Looking at how hes going, however, he should give up motorbikes and join us. Maybe I should move to bikes. 

I think its perfectly normal that he should be driving well, even if the last few tenths are always the hardest to gain. 

Formula One rookie Nico Rosberg, who makes his debut for the Williams team in Bahrain on March 12, said Rossi clearly had what it takes. 

He definitely has the talent for this sport but it remains to be seen how he gets on in a race, added the German. He has an advantage in that he is using a V10 but for a first day its not bad.

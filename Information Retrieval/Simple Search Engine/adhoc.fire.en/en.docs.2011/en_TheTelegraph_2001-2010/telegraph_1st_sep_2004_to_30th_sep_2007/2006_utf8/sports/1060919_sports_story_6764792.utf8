The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Mahesh best partner Ive ever had: Hingis

 - Sania is very talented, says Swiss 

A STAFF REPORTER

 Martina Hingis after her win on Monday 

Calcutta: Finally, the wait came to an end. The city got to see the former world No. 1, Martina Hingis, in action against Melinda Czink in the first round of the Sunfeast Open. And watched awe-struck as she steamrolled Czink 6-1, 6-2 in a mere 47 minutes. 

On court for a brief chat after the match, she laughed at the suggestion that she was in a hurry as she had an appointment to keep. And added that she hoped to have several such appointments all through the week. 

At a press meet soon after, Hingis spoke at length about her game and everything else. 

 Following are excerpts

 QSo, how did you feel about 

 the match today? 

 A I played really well. Melinda is a good 

 player. Moreover, she beat the crowd favourite Sania Mirza 

 here last year. I didnt want to disappoint the crowd 

 and I came out with my best. 

 Are you satisfied with your current form? 

 Well, Im certainly satisfied with it if it 

 is always like it was today. The last six-seven months on 

 the Tour have been generally quite satisfactory. Though, 

 of course, my performance at the Grand Slams havent 

 been too well. I have to bounce back. 

 How was the comeback after the three-year hiatus? 

 Everyone has been extremely welcoming, specially 

 in Australia. It is like being at home over there. 

 Would you like to make a comment on your namesake, 

 Martina Navratilova? 

 I dont think it is quite appropriate to talk 

 about her here. 

 Did you like playing on the surface here at the Indoor? 

 Firstly, I enjoy playing indoors. In Switzerland, 

 because of the snow, we are forced to play indoors for seven 

 months a year, sometimes even eight. I have, kind of, grown 

 up playing indoors. (Chuckles) And even here, dont 

 you think its a much smarter idea to play indoors, 

 than sweat it out in the heat outside? 

 What prompted you to come here? 

 Tennis gives me the opportunity to visit countries 

 places which I probably wouldnt otherwise travel 

 to. The chance to make a lot of friends, both on and off 

 the Tour. I am grateful for what tennis has given me 

 Are you still bothered by your ankle injuries? 

 The ankles are fine. But sometimes, when there 

 are too many tournaments one after the other, and I have 

 to follow a strict regimen, I need to balance my schedule 

 so as not to overdo it. 

 How did you motivate yourself to return to the Tour? 

 I missed it real bad when I wasnt playing 

 and I was never really away from it in that sense of the 

 term. I watched a lot of tennis, I commentated. I worked 

 hard for 5-6 weeks pre-season and thought I was ready to 

 play again. 

 Are you looking forward to playing against Sania? 

 It would definitely be great to play against Sania, 

 but we both have to first get there. 

 And what do you think about her game? 

 Sania is very talented. She has powerful groundstrokes. 

 Ive played just once against her in Dubai. If she 

 can put the right energy and technique together, she will 

 go a long way. But then, she has to keep improving to keep 

 abreast with the others. 

 Has the WTA circuit changed in your absence? 

 It certainly has. The girls now are more athletic. 

 The Williams sisters have brought perfect technique, greater 

 power and a lot of good sense to the game. 

 Which top players would you like to play against? 

 Id like to play against all the top 10 players 

 and beat them as well Mauresmo, Henin-Hardenne, Clijsters, 

 Sharapova and the other Russian girls. Thats what 

 you play for, dont you? 

 Your immediate target? 

 To qualify for the year-end Championships. 

 Finally, a word about Mahesh Bhupathi? 

 Hes the best partner Ive ever had and 

 Im proud of my first mixed doubles title. It is unfortunate 

 that we could do only one round at the French Open. I couldnt 

 carry on with both singles and the doubles because of the 

 rain and bad scheduling.

 Sultans down Dynamos 

Chandigarh: A brace by Didar Singh fashioned Hyderabad Sultans 2-0 victory over local favourites Chandigarh Dynamos in a Premier Hockey League tier I match on Friday. 

The home side had a setback in the 12th minute when they lost the services of Jugraj Singh, who was hit on the face during a penalty-corner defence. Sultans surprised the Dynamos with an early raid, and earned their first penalty corner in the third minute. 

Nitin made a good stop and gave it to Didar with Dilip Tirkey selling a perfect dummy. With the first runner dashing to Tirkey, Didar found enough space to send a powerful drag flick to beat goalkeeper Baljit Singh to take the lead. 

In the 12th minute, Sultans earned their second penalty corner and another drag flick by Didar hit Jugraj on the goalline with umpire Shakeel Qureshi awarding a penalty stroke. 

In a tier II match, Delhi Dazzlers beat Imphal Rangers 1-0.

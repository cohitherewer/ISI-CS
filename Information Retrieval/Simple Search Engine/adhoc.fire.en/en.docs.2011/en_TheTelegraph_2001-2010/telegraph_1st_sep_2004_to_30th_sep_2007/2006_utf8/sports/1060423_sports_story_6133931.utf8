 Football last bastion of tribalism

Berlin: Football is a bastion of chauvinism and primitive behaviour that has nothing to do with art, according to the Austrian given the job of organising the opening and closing ceremonies of the World Cup finals in Germany. 

Andre Heller, the artist chosen by Fifa to head the cultural and artistic programme of the meet, launched a scathing attack on the hand that feeds him in an interview on Friday. 

Football is the last bastion of tribalism where people can allow their chauvinism and primitive character to roam free, said Heller. I have the impression that the World Cup is essentially about victory for Germany, in Germany, in front of the German public and with German players. And that does not strike me as very nice. 

His comments contrast with the opinions of more respected members of the football community, such as Pele, who once described the sport as the beautiful game. Lovers of the more physical nature of the game, however, might empathise with his assessment of South American players, who he equated to ballerinas. 

Football slightly resembles dance, and some South Americans can be compared with ballerinas, said Heller. But it has nothing to do with art. 

Heller was smarting from Fifas decision to abandon the opening gala due to take place in Berlin two days before the opening. Fifa were worried the gala would endanger the playing surface. (AFP)

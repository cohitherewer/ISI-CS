 Picture gets clear 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: The Derby picture is almost clear as the acceptances for the mega-event are out. The declarations, of jockey and draw numbers, are hardly going to matter because the better ones are going to be ridden by good jockeys. A fleeting glance over the eight runners for the Sundays Calcutta Derby Stakes, sponsored by Eveready Industries, suggests, it would be a straight contest between the ever improving filly Supreme Princess and her powerfully build male counterpart, Aristotle. 

 Much was expected from the last winters all conquering filly Sanskara and a horse named Rasalas. But much has also happened between the two winters. Sanskara had turned highly stung while Rasalas has not been showing the kind of improvement that expected from the half-brother of Fiddle Faddle ? an out and out stayer.

 Also, those who thought that the RCTC Derby was an easy pie have failed on one count of the other. This has reference to Rising Force, who is yet to recover from the Pune Derby rout, and Arturo whos stamina to last the 2,400m Derby- trip was always a suspect.

 Supreme Princess has already passed the endurance-test with flying colours. Her Oaks victory was simply cruising, and the Daniel David-trainee is also on the up. Aristotle, the Vijay Singh-trained easy winner of the 2000 Guineas, on the other hand, is yet to show his mettle over the staying trip. However, he is being tutored by none other but Aperitivo, the last winters Derby winner. Their recent workouts over the long galloping course are very impressive. If the early pace in the Derby meet all the requirements, one may look forward to a good contest.

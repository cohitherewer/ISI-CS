The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 When Vengsarkar chose to bide his time

 - Former Captain Was Touched By Ghulam Ahmeds gesture, But Didnt take the easy comeback Route in 83 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Calcutta: There have been instances of middle-order batsmen offering to open when the middle got too crowded and opportunities diminished. 

A few, however, have declined to take that route for a come-back. 

Former India captain Dilip Vengsarkar, an outstanding batsman of his era (over 10,000 runs in Tests and ODIs) who is now chairman of the senior national selection committee, is one of them. 

Its another matter that his debut both in Tests and ODIs versus New Zealand, in early 1976 was as an opener despite being picked for the middle-order. 

That, of course, was driven by the teams requirements and Vengsarkar didnt have a choice. 

In 1983, though, it was up to him. 

Id got injured (hit on the jaw by Malcolm Marshall) in a World Cup group league match against the West Indies and couldnt make the XI thereafter Some months later, Ghulam Ahmed spoke to me and suggested that I open. 

He said something to the effect that a good batsman like me shouldnt be sitting out I was touched by his gesture, but replied that I wouldnt mind waiting That I would like to bat in the middle-order only, Vengsarkar told The Telegraph. 

Ahmed (who is no more) was then chairman of the senior national selection committee and if Vengsarkar is to be complimented for not wanting to compromise, he deserved kudos for opening a line of communication with somebody whod gone out of the XI. 

Their interaction took place during the Irani tie (Karnataka versus the Rest) in Rajkot. Till recently, the Irani engag-ement would launch the new season. 

Perhaps, Vengsarkar will himself follow (to the extent possible) what one of his predecessors did more than two decades ago. Incidentally, he has already had a word with offie Ramesh Powar after he got dropped for the ODIs in South Africa. 

Actually, as the next series (after the 1983 World Cup) was at home against Pakistan, opening wouldnt have been a problem I couldve succeeded, but my game was suited for the middle-order, Vengsarkar, in the city for the Duleep final, added. 

Led by Zaheer Abbas, that team had an ordinary opening attack Tahir Naqqash, Jalaluddin and Azeem Hafeez. Add flat wickets and 

Vengsarkar didnt get a look-in during the ODIs and the first two Tests. His comeback 21 and 40 was in the final Test of that utterly boring series, in Nagpur. 

He batted at No. 3.

 Anand opens with victory

Sofia: Viswanathan Anand cruised to victory over French GM Etienne Bacrot in the first round of the MTEL Masters International Chess tournament here. 

The event, which is being played under classical time control, witnessed Anand in top form as Bacrot was beaten in all departments of the game. 

Playing the Queens Indian Defence, Anand survived some scare in the middlegame before accomplishing his absolute authority over Bacrot. 

The middlegame was quite intense as Anand had some initial problems, but gave his best under difficult circumstances. The Indian ace took most of the opportunities offered by Bacrot after the latter made a positional error. 

Cashing in, Anand had his queen against two uninspiring white rooks of Bacrot with not many open files to operate on, and the former knocked down one queen side pawn to turn the tide decisively in his favour.

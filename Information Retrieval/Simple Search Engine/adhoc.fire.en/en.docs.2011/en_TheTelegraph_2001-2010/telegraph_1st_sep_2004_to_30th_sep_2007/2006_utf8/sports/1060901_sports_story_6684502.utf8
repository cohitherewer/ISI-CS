The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Md. Sporting make peace with IFA, withdraw 

 black badge protest

 - Committee may be set up to look into disputes

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi: Peace seems 

 to have returned to Calcutta football, though it could only 

 turn out to be temporary.

 After days of muscle-flexing in 

 their running battle with the IFA, Mohammedan Sporting seemed 

 to make a hasty retreat when the two parties met AIFF president 

 Priya Ranjan Das Munshi here on Thursday.

 Called by Das Munshi to discuss and find out an amicable 

 solution, the Mohammedan Sporting secretary Sultan Ahmed 

 not only agreed to drop their decision to wear black badges 

 during their CFL Premier Division matches, but also decided 

 to send a representative to Fridays league sub-committee 

 meeting at the IFA office.

 After hearing our cases, the AIFF president made a 

 suggestion to form a one-member committee to look into the 

 matter. We have agreed to accept the verdict of the committee, 

 IFA secretary Subrata Dutta told The Telegraph.

 Neither Dutta nor Ahmed, however, has any idea when the 

 committee will be set up by the federation.

 The IFA, on its part, has agreed to revoke the ban on Mohammedan 

 Sporting ground secretary Iqbal Ahmed. The official was 

 banned for three years for his role in the manhandling of 

 Dutta. 

 Das Munshi also suggested both parties to withdraw all legal 

 cases against each other and restrain themselves from talking 

 against each other in public. 

 Bagans allegation

 A Staff Reporter in Calcutta adds: Meanwhile, Mohun 

 Bagan secretary Anjan Mitra alleged that match-fixing is 

 rampant on the Maidan and that some elements within 

 the IFA are involved in it.

 Mitra said no Mohun Bagan official will attend Fridays 

 meeting. He added that the club wont release players 

 for the Bengal squad if the Santosh Trophy and the CFL go 

 on simultaneously.

 8-hour surgery on Rutherford 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: An eight-hour long surgery was performed on jockey Rutherford Alford at the Hospital for Sports Medicine and Trauma (HOSMAT), Bangalore, on Tuesday.

 Surgery was a success. We are thankful to God for answering our prayers, said jockeys mother, Geraldine, when contacted over her celphone. 

 Rutherfords parents had airdashed to Bangalore and have been camping by sons bedside since Sunday, the day the jockey suffered a spinal injury following his fall from ride Strong Rumours.

 Doctors are very happy with the surgery. They think, it was a good job done, added Geraldine.

 A team of six doctors, headed by Dr Thomas Chandy, conducted the surgery. Incidentally, Dr Chandys clientele includes the likes of Sachin Tendulkar.

 Rutherfords father, Richard, too, sounded relieved after the surgery. Twelve screws needed to be fixed to put together the badly-damaged spinal cord. Now a long wait begins for the wound to heal, said Richard who, on Wednesday, will be heading for Delhi, enroute to Agra, for personal reasons. Once the wound is healed, physiotherapy will follow to help Ruther walk, added Richard.

 Bangalore Turf Club (BTC) is, however, silent on the cause of Rutherfords fall in the race. A number of jockeys who watched the race live, opined that Imran Chisty (on Tough Love) was the main culprit. A total of three jockeys ? S. Babu and Vijay Kumar being the other ? were unseated from their rides. Their falls were, however, unavoidable as they were right behind when Rutherford came a cropper.

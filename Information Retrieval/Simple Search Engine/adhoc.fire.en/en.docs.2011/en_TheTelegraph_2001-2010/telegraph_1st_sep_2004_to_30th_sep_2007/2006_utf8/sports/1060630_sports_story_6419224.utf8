The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 BCCI withholds grants 3 days before CAB meet

 - Timing raises eyebrows 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The Cricket Association 

 of Bengal (CAB) will react only after receiving the missive 

 from the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) withholding 

 all subsidies and payments. 

Let the CAB first receive and go through the letter. Then it will react appropriately, president Jagmohan Dalmiya said on Thursday. 

While city police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee, who will contest the presidents post at the annual general meeting next month, said it reflected poorly on the state of affairs of the association, eyebrows have been raised in all quarters as to the timing of the BCCIs announcement. 

If the BCCI has indeed taken such a decision, then its rather unfortunate. It only shows where the CAB administration has come to, Mukherjee said. 

No one, however, can miss the fact that this comes only three days before the emergent meeting of CAB affiliates, called by Dalmiya, to ascertain what kind of support he can expect. 

Obviously, the move is meant to put more pressure on Dalmiya. 

In New Delhi, the BCCI said the move came in the light of allegations of misappropriation of funds by Dalmiya. 

The CAB had failed to furnish details of the amount transferred to its account from the Bhowanipur branch of the Indian Overseas Bank by Dalmiya from 1995 to 2006. 

The letter also said that the Board decided to debit Rs 40 crore to the CAB. Dalmiya failed to furnish details of the account No. 1223 with the Bhowanipur branch along with vouchers, bills, ledgers and audited balance-sheets despite a notice being served to him on April 15. 

 Board secretary Niranjan Shah stated that CAB representative 

 Chitrak Mitra, who was present at the working committee 

 meeting of the Board held in Mumbai on April 9, had assured 

 the house that all details of the amounts transferred to 

 CAB from Bhowanipur IOB account would be furnished within 

 seven days, but has not kept his word despite repeated notices.

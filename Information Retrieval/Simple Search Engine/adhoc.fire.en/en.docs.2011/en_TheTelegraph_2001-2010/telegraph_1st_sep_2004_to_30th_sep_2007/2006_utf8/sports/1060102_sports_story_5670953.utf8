Calcutta: The 15-member Tamil Nadu squad arrived in the city late on Sunday following a two-hour delayed flight from Chennai. Their sixth-round Ranji Trophy match against Bengal gets under way at the Eden on Tuesday. 

With five points in their kitty, Tamil Nadu ? captained by S. Badrinath ? are looking for an outright win in the match. 

 When asked whether Sourav Gangulys presence in the Bengal team would have any effect on the visitors, coach B. Arun said: It will be just another match for us where we would like to gain full points, irrespective of who is playing or not. We have come here to win and hopefully we would do it so. 

THE Squad: S. Badrinath (captain), Hemang Badani, Sridharan Sriram, Dinesh Karthick, Aashish Kapur, S. Sharath, S. Vidyut, C. Hemant Kumar, Yo Mahesh, N.K. Shivkumar, D. Kumaran, R. Ramkumar, Srikkanth Anirudh, R. Jesuraj, K. Vasudevan; Coach: B. Arun.

Durban: Ashwell Princes gritty unbeaten knock of 98 helped South Africa reach 257 for eight after the first day of the second Test against India on Tuesday. 

The disciplined Prince, who came to the crease after South Africa had been reduced to 28 for three, batted for four-and-a-half hours before play was halted for the day 17 overs early due to bad light. 

India squandered a chance to dismiss Prince for 41 when a delivery from mediumpacer Vikram Rajvir Singh was edged to first slip but Sachin Tendulkar spilled the chance. 

Tendulkar injured his hand in attempting to take the catch, and was taken to hospital for x-rays. He remained off the field for the rest of the day. 

Left-arm fast bowler Zaheer Khan struck in the third over of the match when Graeme Smith, who scored five, top edged a pull shot and fell to a well judged catch by Tendulkar running back from first slip. 

Hashim Amla became Zaheers next victim when he was trapped in front for one, and South Africa lost their third wicket when AB de Villiers edged a drive off fast bowler Sreesanth to Tendulkar at first slip to be dismissed for nine. 

Herschelle Gibbs and Prince consolidated in a partnership of 94 that lasted until an hour after lunch. 

Sreesanth ended the stand when an increasingly aggressive Gibbs, who hit 13 fours in his 63, slashed at a short delivery and was spectacularly caught behind by wicketkeeper Mahendra Dhoni, who dived full length to take the catch in front of first slip. 

Mark Boucher and Prince took South Africa to the 13th over after tea, when Sreesanth sent two of Bouchers stumps cartwheeling. 

Bouchers 53 was part of a fifth-wicket stand of 100 he shared with Prince in which the runs flowed faster than at any other stage of the days play. 

Shaun Pollock scored 11 before cutting hard at a delivery from Singh and being smartly caught by Virender Sehwag at point in the over before the enforced close. 

Five balls later a googly by Kumble dismissed Andrew Hall leg-before for a duck. Three balls after that, Kumble bowled Andre Nel with a top-spinner, also for nought. 

Debutant Morne Morkel, not out on 0, faced one ball before the players left the field. 

South Africa suffered a setback before the start when key allrounder Jacques Kallis was ruled out with a painful back. Kallis was replaced by allrounder Andrew Hall.

 Dravid: No pressure

Mumbai: India captain Rahul Dravid has brushed aside suggestions that Indian players would be weighed down by the pressures of performing in front of home crowd in the Champions Trophy, saying his team was looking forward to the ten-team event beginning on Saturday. 

The Indian team and the whole country is really excited about the ICC Champions Trophy and we cannot wait to get into the competition, to play and see the excitement of the crowds and the public, Dravid was quoted as saying by the ICCs Cricket Quarterly. 

Its exciting to be the home team in an event of this magnitude but we dont look on that as creating added pressure. All we are looking to do is play good one-day cricket and achieve the right results, the Bangalore batsman said. 

But the Indian captain is wary of putting the cart before the horse, by focusing on the end result before they start their campaign (in Jaipur against England on October 15), which he thinks might put unnecessary pressure. 

Lifting the ICC Champions Trophy on home soil would be exciting, but doing that is a lot of matches away. 

All the teams want to do exactly that and if we start thinking about the end result before we start, then that will just create unnecessary pressure. 

The passion and love for the game here is unmatched to anywhere else in the world and the fact that it is the first ICC event in India for 10 years means it is even more special, Dravid said. 

Indias form in the run-up to the tournament has been far from impressive in the limited-overs form of the game, following 1-4 series loss to the West Indies and the failure in the tri-nation event in Malaysia. 

One of Indias main rivals, Australia, have the wherewithal to lift the one major silverware missing from their cupboard, feels selection panel chief and former opener Andrew Hilditch. 

Australia have been successful in ODIs for a long time, but we havent won the Champions Trophy and weve picked a side that we believe is capable of winning it, Hilditch said. 

Glenn McGrath, Australias trump card, has said that his body felt as good as it ever had. 

The body is feeling as good as it ever has, with no aches, no niggles, no anything, the gangling seam-up expert has said.

 England square series

 - Batsmen let Pakistan down

London: England produced a Jekyll and Hyde performance before snatching a three-wicket victory in the fifth and final one-dayer against Pakistan in Edgbaston on Sunday to level the series 2-2. 

The hosts, helped by the best of the conditions and by winning their first toss of the series, produced a fine display in the field to restrict Pakistan to 154 for nine, then batted wildly and erratically before regaining their poise to win with 19 overs to spare. 

Only skipper Andrew Strauss, with a polished 35 off 41 balls, batted with any conviction in the top order during a dramatic run chase, while Ed Joyce, Kevin Pietersen and Chris Read all threw away their wickets. 

Pakistan, who collapsed from 43 without loss to 72 for five, had some excuse for their poor total, with Englands bowlers benefiting from some early swing and seam movement. 

The home side had fewer mitigating circumstances before Michael Yardy (12 batting) and Sajid Mahmood (22 batting) restored some sanity. 

Man-of-the-Match Mahmood, after earlier taking two for 24 off 10 overs, played some fine shots in his 25-ball knock, including three fours in a row to all but settle the game in the 30th over from Rana Naved-ul Hasan. 

We had a bit of a chance when their seventh wicket went down, the pressure was on England but Yardy and Mahmood played very well, Inzamam-ul Haq said during the presentations. The toss was very important. 

We made a bit of a mountain out of a molehill, rival captain Strauss said. But there is a lot of fight there and belief. 

Pakistan had managed only nine boundaries in their entire innings.

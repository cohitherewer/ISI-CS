 Nadal equals Vilas record 

Rome: Rafael Nadal equalled Guillermo Vilas record of 53 consecutive claycourt wins when he beat Roger Federer 6-7, 7-6, 6-4, 2-6, 7-6 in the final of the Rome Masters on Sunday. 

Nadals victory, his fourth in a row over Federer, made him the first player to win back-to-back titles in the Italian capital since Thomas Muster of Austria in 1995-96. 

World number two Nadal, who has now won his last nine tournaments on clay, will break Argentine Vilass record if he beats Tommy Haas of Germany in the first round of next weeks Hamburg Masters tournament. 

The momentum swung Nadals way in the fifth game of the third set when he whipped a backhand crosscourt winner past Federer to gain a decisive break before holding on to his serve to close out the set. (Reuters)

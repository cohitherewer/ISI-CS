 Jeev in third spot

Nagoya (Japan): Jeev Milkha Singh, coming off a great fortnight in China, carded a six-under 64 in the first round of the Crowns ?120 million tournament at the Nagoya Golf Clubs Wago course. 

The 34-year-old Jeev, who picked up his first victory in seven years at the Volvo China Open two weeks ago, was two shots behind leader Soushi Tajima, who returned a card of eight-under 62, and one behind Shingo Katayama (63). 

Jeev began the day with birdies on the first two holes, 4th and 9th to come through the opening nine in four-under. Two more birdies followed on 10th and 11th which got him to six-under after 11 holes. 

But the run was halted as he bogeyed the 12th. He got that shot back with a birdie on the 14th, and parred the rest for his 64. 

It was a perfect day for golf and it felt nice to open 2006 in Japan with such a start. I hope to build on this day, said Jeev. 

Jeev reached 83 per cent greens in regulation and needed only 27 putts with no three-putts. 

Tajima, 29, was in sensational form in his round of 62 with just 24 putts and no bogeys. He was six-under for the front nine and had two more on the back nine. (PTI)

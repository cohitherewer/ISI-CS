 Jeev crosses million-dollar hurdle

 Jeev Milkha singh

Shanghai: Jeev Milkha Singh, who picked up the biggest cheque of his career, a whopping $300,000 for winning the Volvo China Open on Sunday, also became the third Indian to cross the coveted million-dollar mark in career earnings on Asian Tour. 

The first two were Arjun Atwal and Jyoti Randhawa. Jeev now earned a career total of $1.06 million on Asian Tour and is the tenth player to join the million-dollar club. 

Jeev also moved onto the top of the UBS Asian Tour Order of Merit and is also 14th on the European Order of Merit. He also got two-year exemption on European Tour, following the win in the co-sanctioned event last weekend. 

Shiv Kapur on tenth, Gaurav Ghei on 17th and Amandeep Johl on 20th are the other Indians in top-20 of Asian Tour Order of Merit. 

 The tenacious Indian golfer that he is, Jeev fought tooth and nail to end a frustrating seven-year title drought which was blighted by injuries but he proved the old adage that hard work and perseverance do pay off handsomely. 

Jeev leapfrogged to the summit of the UBS Order of Merit with winnings of $373,101, over $86,000 ahead of second-placed Charlie Wi of Korea, who settled for tied 51st place in China.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Diligence report by weekend 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Most of RCTCs club members are hoping that the due diligence report comes out clean. If it does not, more resignations at the top will follow. Four of the five stewards, on some pretext or the other, have already tendered their resignations and, in the present forum, there are three who may also face the music for passing the year 2005-06 account while the study process has been on.

 The study is being prepared by independent external auditors, as was demanded by some prominent club members in the July 24 EGM. The report, which has already overshot its deadline by a fortnight, is expected to be out by the weekend. The Chennai-based auditing firm, S.N.S. Associates, is examining the case.

 The bane of all disputes has been the financial dealings pertaining to the renovation of an office building in the racecourse. It has cost the club a highly exaggerated expenditure of about Rs 1.3 crore, and thus the due diligence study. 

 Due diligence was ordered by them (stewards) on our insistence; said B.M.Varma, ex-senior steward, when contacted over the telephone. How can they (stewards) go about taking credit for it? he questioned. 

 Varma was also very concerned about talks related to the proposed outright sale of the Russell Street property. The property should not be sold whatever the circumstances. Let it be developed under a proper management. Its valued at over Rs 250 crore. Bigger the money, greater the financial irregularities. Havent we learnt a lesson yet? said Varma before signing off.

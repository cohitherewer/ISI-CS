 Anand falls at Kamsky hurdle

Sofia: Viswanathan Anand suffered a shock defeat at the hands of Russian-turned-American Gata Kamsky in the third round of the MTel Masters International chess tournament here. 

After a couple of wins with black in the first two rounds, the Indian super Grandmaster failed to use his first white in the event well enough and succumbed to his second defeat against Kamsky within six months. 

The other two games of the category-20 tournament ended in draws as Frenchman Etienne Bacrot opened account by holding Russian Peter Svidler, while World Champion Veselin Topalov of Bulgaria took his second draw in three days, signing peace with former World Champion Ruslan Ponomariov of Ukraine. 

With seven rounds still to go in the six-player double round robin tournament, Kamsky snatched the lead from Anand after another brilliant endgame effort and took his tally to 2.5 points out of a possible three. 

Anand slipped to joint second spot with Svidler on two, while Topalov and Ponomariov share the fourth position on one. Bacrot is still in the cellar on half a point. 

 Sasikiran draws 

Grandmaster Krishnan Sasikrian drew with Bosnian talent Borki Predojevic in the seventh round of the Bosnia International Grandmaster chess tournament here, adds another report from Sarajevo. 

European champion Liviu-Dieter Nisipeanu of Romania remained in sole lead on 4.5 points out of a possible seven after calling it truce against Norwegian boy wonder Magnus Carlsen. 

 Carlsen stayed in joint second 

 spot along with Predojivic and Russian Vladimir Malakhov. 

 Sasikiran is on the fifth spot on 2.5 points.

 Dhorasoo may sue club

Paris: French midfielder Vikash Dhorasoo plans to sue Paris Saint-Germain in a labour tribunal after being sacked by his club following a row with the manager. 

Dhorasoo was dismissed on Wednesday for alleged insubordination and disobedience after querying the tactics of coach Guy Lacombe and calling him a liar in an interview with a daily month. 

Dhorasoo is the first player made redundant by a French club since 1973. (Agencies)

 Colombo: India claimed 

 both volleyball golds at the 10th SAF Games here on Sunday.

 In the womens final, India 

 staved off a spirited Sri Lankan challenge to win 27-25, 

 25-20, 25-20 at the packed Sugathadasa Indoor Stadium.

 The two nations clashed again 

 sometime later in the mens title-clash, and it made 

 for another close contest. The hosts, cheered on by thousands, 

 lifted their game and pushed the Indians.

 India survived some tense moments 

 before winning 25-15, 21-25, 25-21, 25-19 in an hour and 

 a half. It was the induction of Sanjay Kumar in the third 

 set which made the difference for the Indians.

 In judo, India won all five gold 

 medals at stake. Laishram Bembem Devi won top honours in 

 womens 48 kg. Chana Navjot topped in mens 60 

 kg, while Parvinder Singh triumphed in the 66 kg category.

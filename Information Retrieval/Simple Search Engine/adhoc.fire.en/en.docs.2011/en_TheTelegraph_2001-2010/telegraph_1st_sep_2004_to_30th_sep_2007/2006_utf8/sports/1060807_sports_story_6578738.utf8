 BCCI open to idea

 - Overseas players in Ranji, Duleep

Ahmedabad: The BCCI is open to the idea of allowing overseas players to participate in domestic tournaments like the Ranji and Duleep Trophy, on the lines of the County championship. 

We want to bring in foreign players to play some Ranji Trophy matches, BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah said on Sunday. 

We want to generate interest among the masses about Ranji Trophy and Duleep Trophy. We would like more and more people to watch these matches. 

Shah also said there were plans to introduce coloured clothing and white Kookuburra balls in the Duleep Trophy. 

BCCI president Sharad Pawar had said that Ranji rules did not allow for the participation of overseas players but Shah clarified that provision to play foreign players already exist. 

Most of the associations have money and can afford to bring in players (from other countries), Shah said. We are open on this matter as it will generate interest. (PTI)

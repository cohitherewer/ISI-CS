 IAAF, Greek sprinters strike deal

Berlin: Greek sprinters Costas Kenteris and Katerina Thanou and the International Association of Athletics Federation (IAAF) have struck a surprise deal over the infamous doping case stemming from the 2004 Athens Olympics. 

A deal was made that puts an end to a complex case, their lawyer Gregory Ioannidis said on Monday. 

The terms of the agreement are satisfactory for both sides. The IAAF were very helpful towards the athletes and they will support their effort to return to competition. 

The IAAF on Monday withdrew an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) and said the athletes had accepted they violated anti-doping rules by missing three drugs tests prior to the 2004 Athens Olympics.

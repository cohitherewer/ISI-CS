 Sachin not 100 per cent fit: Chappell

Bangalore: Sachin Tendulkars role as a fielder would be restricted as he cannot do long distance throwing in the first few matches on his return to the Indian team from a shoulder operation, coach Greg Chappell said Friday. 

He is ready to play, but he is not absolutely 100 per cent fit. He cannot do long distance throwing, Chappell, who arrived here ahead of the Indians cricket-specific camp from Sunday, said. 

The former Australian captain said Tendulkar, who is back after a four-month gap following the operation in March, would field within the 30-yard circle in the first few matches. 

For everything else, he is looking pretty good. He made a few runs in England. We have to nurse him through the initial couple of matches. 

We have to give him the confidence as far as throwing is concerned, Chappell said. 

He, however, denied there were doubts over Tendulkar being fit for the 2007 World Cup in the West Indies. 

He has an important part to play. I expect him to be fit. But what happens in 10 months time from now, who knows? 

As a bowler, batsman and fielder, he has an important role to play. He is the senior member of the team. 

What we have to do is to pull all that experience in Sachins head and give it to others. 

Chappell said the players have to continue with their learning process. We have to continue to do what we are doing. We have made big strides in the last 12 months, we have to make many bigger strides in the next 10 months, he said, referring to the World Cup. 

We cannot relax. The players learnt that when they got beaten (in the one-dayers) in the West Indies.

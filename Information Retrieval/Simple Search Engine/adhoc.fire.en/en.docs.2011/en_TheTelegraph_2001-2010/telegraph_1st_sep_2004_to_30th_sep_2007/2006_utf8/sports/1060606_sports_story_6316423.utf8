Calcutta: After cricket and hockey, Sahara comes calling in Calcutta football. And the IFA-organised league will henceforth be known as the Sahara Calcutta Football League. 

Sahara India Pariwar on Monday announced a five-year deal with the IFA at a city hotel. Speaking on the occasion, the organisations corporate communications head Abhijit Sarkar promised that it would work to bring back the golden days of football in the state. 

We may field a team in the CFL in the next one or two years, Sarkar said. 

Sahara has entered a yearly contract of about Rs 75 lakh with the IFA. 

Today is a momentous day in the history of football in Bengal? Its a dream come true, a visibly elated IFA president Aditya Kashyap quipped. 

This is going to be the organisations first foray into the field of football. 

Former Team India captain Sourav Ganguly and former Olympian Chuni Goswami unveiled the new logo of the league. 

I hope Sahara would come forward to extend all co-operation to the IFA in developing the game here, Sourav said.

 Johl seeks inspiration from Jeev Milkha

Tokyo: Inspired by compatriot Jeev Milkha Singh, Indias Amandeep Johl has his sights set on continuing his season of renaissance when the UBS Japan Golf Tour Championship gets underway on Thursday near here. Johl, who is playing through an invitation from title-sponsor UBS, admits to being driven to greater glory by the stunning 2006 success of Jeev Milkha. 

Jeev is also contesting the Japan Golf Tour and arrived in Ibaraki on Tuesday. I am hoping to get in a practice round with Jeev on Wednesday. I have not had a chance to speak to him since his US Open appearance, as he was still in the US, Johl said. However, I am looking forward to learning some things from him and feeding off of the success he has enjoyed recently. 

 Jyoti fails 

Jyoti Randhawa, meanwhile, failed in his quest to come through for the British Open when he missed making the grade in the International Final Qualifying (IFQ) round.

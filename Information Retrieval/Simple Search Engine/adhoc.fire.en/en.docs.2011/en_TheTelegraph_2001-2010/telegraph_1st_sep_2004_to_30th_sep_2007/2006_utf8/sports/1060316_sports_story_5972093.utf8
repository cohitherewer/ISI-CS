 Anju slips to fifth position

New Delhi: Following her failure at World Indoor Athletics Championships, ace long jumper Anju Bobby George has slipped one spot to fifth place in the latest International Association of Athletics Federation (IAAF) rankings, according to information received here. 

Anju failed to make it to the finals at Moscow in controversial circumstances last week after a faulty instrument saw her score well below the qualifying mark. Anju would be spearheading the Indian athletics campaign at the Melbourne Commonwealth Games. 

American Tianna Madison, who won gold at the World Championships in Helsinki last year, has jumped three places to No. 2, behind Russian Tatyana Kotova, who emerged champion on home ground in Moscow. (PTI)

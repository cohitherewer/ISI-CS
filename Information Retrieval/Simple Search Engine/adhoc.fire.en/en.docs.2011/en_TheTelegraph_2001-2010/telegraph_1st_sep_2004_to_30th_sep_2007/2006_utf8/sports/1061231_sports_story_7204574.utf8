The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 SA will be confused about type of wickets to prepare: Akram

 - Former Pakistan captains endorse squad 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 WASIM AKRAM

Durban: Two former captains, Wasim Akram and Aamer Sohail, have endorsed the Pakistan squad picked for the three-Test series in South Africa. In a chat with The Telegraph, both accepted the official position that the mercurial Shoaib Akhtar needs more domestic appearances to get match fit. 

Sohail, however, felt opener Taufeeq Umar shouldve been in the 17-man squad. Incidentally, hes the first Asian captain to have won a Test in South Africa at Kingsmead, in 1997-98. 

The following are excerpts from what Akram and Sohail said on Saturday morning: 

AKRAM: Its a good bunch... I think theyve chosen the best available... I really dont have a problem with any selection and am happy that Asim Kamal has been recalled... In fact, I cant understand why hed been dropped... Asim is a solid batsman, ideally suited for Test cricket... Weve got a good attack and the South Africans are going to be confused about the type of wickets to prepare... Pace and bounce, after all, will help the Mohammed Asifs... Except for Rana (Naved-ul Hasan), our attack is pretty young and thats a plus... I suppose the batsmen are going to take some time to settle down, but Im not worried... The Indians dented the South Africans confidence at the Wanderers and that will help us... 

 AAMER SOHAIL 

SOHAIL: The selectors have done a good job, except that Umar ought to have been in the squad... Theyve picked only two specialist openers (Imran Farhat and Mohammed Hafeez) and thats not enough... If theyre looking at Shoaib Malik as the third, then theyve got it wrong as opening in South Africa is very different from opening in the subcontinent... The squad, though, is packed with middle-order batsmen... Thanks to Sreesanth, the South Africans wont be clear about what wickets to prepare... Lively ones are going to help our quicks and, if the wickets are flat, then our batsmen will have a good run... I think we have a nice chance, not least because the South African batsmen are struggling... 

Pakistans tour starts with a three-day match in Kimberley, from January 6. The Tests are in Centurion (from January 11), Port Elizabeth (from January 19) and Cape Town (from January 26). The five ODIs are later.

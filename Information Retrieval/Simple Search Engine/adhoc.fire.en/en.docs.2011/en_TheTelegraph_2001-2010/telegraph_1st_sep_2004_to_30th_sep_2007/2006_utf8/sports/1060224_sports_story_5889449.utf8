 SA, Aussies to play sans super sub

Johannesburg: South Africa and Australia are set to put an early end to the controversial super sub rule ahead of its official scrapping next month. 

South Africa captain Graeme Smith and Australian counterpart Ricky Ponting said on Thursday that they favoured going back to 11-a-side cricket for the 20-over game, which kicks off Australias tour at the Wanderers Stadium on Friday. 

The sooner we can get back to playing the cricket were used to and the cricket well be playing going forward, the better, said Ponting. I think an agreement will be struck. 

Smith said: Were going to the World Cup in 2007 and if these rules are not going to be part of the Cup why should we be playing them? 

The captains cited the example of New Zealand and the West Indies, who agreed to play without substitutes during their current series. (AFP)

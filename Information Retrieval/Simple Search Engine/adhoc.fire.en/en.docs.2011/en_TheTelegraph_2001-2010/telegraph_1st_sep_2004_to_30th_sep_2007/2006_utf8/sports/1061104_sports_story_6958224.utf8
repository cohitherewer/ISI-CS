 Perfection wins on day of upsets 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Barring the piping hot-favourite, Star Perfection who won the Hilliard Cup with a degree of comfort, less fancied horses ruled the day on Friday. Imran Chisty partnered the Daniel David-ward to victory but the jockey went on to give a poor ride to another of the stables hot-favourite, Imperial Stride, in the Robin Hood Cup. 

 The stable also suffered when jockey R.Yadav was slapped a four-day ban for going easy on Tomahawk in the Sunray Handicap won by Gypsy King.

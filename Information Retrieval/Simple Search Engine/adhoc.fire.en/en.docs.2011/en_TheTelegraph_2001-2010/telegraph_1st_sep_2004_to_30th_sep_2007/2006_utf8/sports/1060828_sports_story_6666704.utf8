 Chelsea beat Blackburn 

London: Two-time defending champions Chelsea beat Blackburn 2-0 on Sunday in the English Premier League, winning on Frank Lampards 50th-minute penalty and a late goal from substitute Didier Drogba. 

Unlike the Blues of the last two seasons, Chelsea looked unconvincing particularly in the first half. The victory came just days after a 2-3 loss to Middlesbrough. 

Lampard had a miserable World Cup for England, missing a penalty kick in a shoot-out loss to Portugal in the quarter finals. 

He was nearly foiled on Sunday, too, as Blackburn goalkeeper Brad Friedel got his hand on the penalty kick but failed to stop it. 

Drogba sealed the victory in the 81st, beating defender Andre Ooijer and lifting a 10 metre shot over Friedel. 

The victory gave Chelsea six points from three games, three behind league-leading Manchester United. Blackburn has only one point. 

Chelsea started both of their summer signings midfielder Michael Ballack and striker Andriy Shevchenko. It was Ballacks debut in a regular-season game after moving from Bayern Munich. 

Lampard was given the penalty after referee Mark Clattenburg called Ooijer for pulling down John Terry in the area. 

A few minutes later, Chelsea defender Ricardo Carvalho got away with a similar move. 

Earlier, Luke Moore and Juan Pablo Angel scored first-half goals to lead Aston Villa to a 2-0 win over Newcastle and into second place. 

On Saturday, Luis Figo curled in a free kick four minutes into extra-time to complete Inter Milans rally from a three-goal deficit for a 4-3 victory over AS Roma and give them the Italian Supercup title. 

In Madrid, goals by Fernando Morientes and Raul Albiol gave Valencia a 2-1 win over Real Betis on Saturday in the opening match of the Spanish league season. 

Valencia, the 2002 and 2004 champion and a favourite of many for the title this season, earned their first three points with a forceful display at their Mestalla Stadium.

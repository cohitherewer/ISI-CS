The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Sourav unlikely 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 P. Sen Trophy

 Calcutta: Former Team India 

 captain Sourav Ganguly is unlikely to turn out for CAB Presidents 

 XI in the P. Sen Trophy. 

 The dates havent been 

 finalised, but instead of third week, it will now start 

 in the last week, CAB joint secretary Saradindu Pal 

 said. 

 The CAB, however, has announced 

 the 17-member squad which will be led by wicketkeeper-batsman 

 Subhajit Paul. 

 It is learnt that Sourav has already 

 been requested to lead the CAB XI, but the former captain 

 has sought a few days to decide. He is in talks with Northamptonshire 

 for a County stint.

 Meanwhile, Sourav met CMC commissioner 

 Alapan Bandopadhyay on Saturday in connection with the gym 

 he wants to construct in Behala. He has already been granted 

 land and has been asked to present the building plan.

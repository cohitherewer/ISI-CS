 India thrash Belgium 7-1

Cologne: Shrugging off an indifferent form, India posted a 7-1 victory over Belgium in their second practice game here in the run up to the hockey World Cup. 

Skipper Dilip Tirkey converted a penalty corner in each half while Ignace Tirkey, Shivendra Singh, Tushar Khandekar, Gagan Ajit Singh and Hari Prasad sounded the board once each to earn the morale boosting win for India. 

At half-time, the scoreline was 2-1 in Indias favour, with goals from Dilip and Ignace. 

India, who had lost their first practice match to Belgium 1-3 on Monday, are slated to play another practice game, against Japan, in Monchengladbach on Saturday before vying for honours in the showpiece quadrennial event. 

The victory notwithstanding, the Indians seemed to be missing their drag-flick expert Sandeep Singh who was injured in an accidental firing last week. 

Assistant coach Harendra Singh said the team was likely to pick a substitute for Sandeep by Friday. 

We are looking forward to do well in the match against Japan. Also, we are likely to pick Sandeeps replacement by Friday, he said.

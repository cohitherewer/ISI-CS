 Pak rotation policy to stop burnout

Karachi: Pakistan are introducing a player rotation policy to prevent burnout before next years World Cup in the West Indies. 

We have 75 playing days before the World Cup and the danger of losing some of our players to fatigue and fitness problems is real, Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq said on Tuesday. 

Which is why we have decided to adopt a rotation policy for the Tests and one-day Internationals to preserve our players for the big tournament. 

Pakistan are in England from June to play four Tests and five one-dayers before taking part in the Champions Trophy in India. 

They also play three Tests and three one-dayers against the West Indies at home in November-December, and then fly out to South Africa for a full tour before the World Cup. 

Players facing burnout and fatigue due to the gruelling international calendar is a real issue and we have to take steps to keep our best players available for the World Cup.

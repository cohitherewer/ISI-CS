 Federer cruises

Tokyo: World No.1 Roger Federer ended Wesley Moodies reign as Japan Open champion with a crushing 6-2, 6-1 win to reach the quarter finals on Thursday. 

Razor-sharp from the opening point, the Swiss top seed needed just 52 minutes to blow away the South African behind a blaze of winners in Tokyo, improving his win-loss record this year to 74-5. 

I played great and came up with an incredible match, Federer told reporters. 

I hit a few really great shots but to win so convincingly was quite surprising. 

Federer won seven straight games from 3-2 in the first set with an awesome display of stroke-making that left Moodie shaking his head in disbelief. 

One angled backhand return from Federer that drifted away from Moodie and onto the line to give him a break for 2-0 in the second set even brought a wry smile to Federers face. (REUTERS)

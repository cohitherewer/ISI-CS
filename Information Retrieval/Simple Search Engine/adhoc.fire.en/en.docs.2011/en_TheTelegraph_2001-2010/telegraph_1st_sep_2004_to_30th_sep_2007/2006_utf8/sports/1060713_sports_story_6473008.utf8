 FACT-BOX

Italys World Cup-winning coach Marcello Lippi resigned on Wednesday, three days after leading the Azzurri to a penalty shootout win over France in the final in Berlin. Following are the highlights of his career: 

 After a modest playing career with Savona, Sampdoria and 

 Pistoiese, Lippi began coaching in 1982 with Sampdorias 

 youth team. He worked his way through the lower divisions 

 before arriving in Serie A in 1989 at the helm of Cesena.

 Spells with Lucchese and Atalanta followed before his breakthrough 

 in the 1993-94 season, when he led a Napoli side still smarting 

 from the departure of Diego Maradona to a Uefa Cup place. 

 The following season he was snapped up by Juventus, the 

 start of a five-year reign during which he won three Serie 

 A titles and the 1996 Champions League.

 In 1999 Lippi moved on to Inter Milan. The club had not 

 won the Serie A title since 1989 and his season there was 

 the only failure on his CV. After watching Inter lose to 

 Reggina in the first game of the 2000-01 season, a furious 

 Lippi said his players needed a kick up the a***. 

 He resigned days later.

 A year out of work ended in July 2001 when he was recalled 

 to Juventus. His second stint in Turin was almost as successful 

 as his first ? the club won two Serie A titles and finished 

 runner-up to AC Milan after a penalty shoot-out in the 2003 

 Champions League final.

 Italys group stage exit in Euro 2004 opened the way 

 for Lippi to take over from Giovanni Trapattoni as coach 

 of the Azzurri. His appointment was not universally popular 

 with fans, many of whom associated him with Juventus. A 

 0-2 defeat to Iceland on his debut was hardly the ideal 

 start but Italy qualified for the World Cup with a game 

 to spare, the first time they had done so since qualifying 

 for the 1982 tournament.

 After Italys pre-World Cup wins over the Netherlands 

 and Germany, Lippi was hailed as a tactical genius. Shortly 

 before the start of the World Cup his son, Davide, was questioned 

 by magistrates in Rome investigating sports agency GEA World. 

 Briefly, it seemed Lippi might be forced to step down in 

 the cull of leading officials touched by a match-fixing 

 scandal. After receiving a vote of confidence from Italian 

 Football Federation commissioner Guido Rossi, Lippi kept 

 his job, leading Italy through a shaky start to victory 

 in Berlin.

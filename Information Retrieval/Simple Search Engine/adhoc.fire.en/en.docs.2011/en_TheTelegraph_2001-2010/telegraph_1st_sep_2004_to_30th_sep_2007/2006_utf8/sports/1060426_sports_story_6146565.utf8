 Club cricketer scores 42 in an over

London: An unknown club cricketer surpassed cricketing legend Sir Gary Sobers feat of scoring the highest number of runs in an over on Tuesday. 

Jonathan Hughes, a Yorkshire club cricketer scored 42, hitting six sixes, a four and a two off medium-pacer Craig Hobson while playing for North Leeds against Hall Park in a Cup match.The feat was possible because Hobson sent down two no balls in the over, an English television channel report said, adding Hughes went on to make 126 not out. 

Former West Indies captain Sobers, universally acclaimed as the greatest all-round cricketer the game has ever seen, scored 36 off an over for Nottinghamshire against Glamorgan in 1968. 

His record was later equalled by Ravi Shastri, who struck six sixes while batting for Mumbai 21 years ago. 

Hughes record, however, would not find its way to the record books as there are no official records for club cricket.

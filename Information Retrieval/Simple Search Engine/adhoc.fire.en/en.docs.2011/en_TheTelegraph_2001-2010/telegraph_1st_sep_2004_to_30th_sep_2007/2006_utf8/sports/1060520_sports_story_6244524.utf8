 Dravid, Dhoni for charity tie

London: Indian skipper Rahul Dravid will lead an international side against Pakistan in a Twenty20 match to raise money for a quake relief fund. 

Indias dashing wicketkeeper-batsman Mahendra Singh Dhoni will also feature in the match, to be organised by the Surrey CCC at The Oval on July 10, besides the likes of Brian Lara and Muttiah Muralidharan. England allrounder Andrew Flintoff will make a non-playing appearance during the match. 

Donations, along with profits from the match, will be passed on to the Pakistan Presidents Earthquake Relief Fund. (PTI)

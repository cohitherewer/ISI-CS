 Mahindra pull up Indian thinktank

 - Some were forced to play with injuries: Menezes 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 The likes of Gawli shouldnt have been fielded vs Japan 

New Delhi: A day after the humiliating loss to Yemen in the Asian Cup qualifiers, former India goalkeeper and Mahindra United manager Henry Menezes levelled serious allegations against the national team management. 

Speaking to The Telegraph from Mumbai on Thursday, Menezes said that some players were forced to play with injuries against Japan. Most of the players who picked up injuries during their stint with the national team, are from Mahindra United. 

Midfielder S. Venkatesh was sent back two days after the camp started. He was followed by Abhishek Yadav (broken arm), K. Ajayan, Mahesh Gawli (both knee injury) and N.S. Manju (hepatitis). 

Our management is very upset, Menezes said. Of the 10 footballers we sent to the camp, half have returned with injuries on the eve of our Asia Club Cup tie in Lebanon. We have reasons to believe that the Indian team management could have avoided fielding Ajayan, Mahesh Gawli and Manju against Japan in Yokohama. 

According to Menezes, the injured footballers have told club officials that too much of physical training and wrong training methods could be the main reasons behind injuries. The players felt they were made to play with injuries. 

Dr Chandran, who was with the Indian team during the matches against Japan and Yemen, agreed that some players were not fully fit on the eve of the Japan tie. It was common knowledge in the team, he said. 

Asked why these players were still fielded, Dr Chandran said his job was to report to the team management about fitness of the players. A doctor is never part of the selection committee. 

Dr Chandran said he would submit a detailed report to the AIFF only if he was asked to. I cant jump the gun. 

It is no secret that manager P.K. Banerjee and coach Syed Nayeemuddin were not happy with the way some of the players declared themselves unfit and quit the scene. The duo even criticised the players openly a day before the Yemen match.

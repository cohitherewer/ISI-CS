 Work extremely hard on you fitness. 

 A smooth run-up and rhythmic action will help a great deal.

 I am a mediumpacer. What 

 are the essentials for bowling the inswinger and outswinger? 

 (Sourav Chandra, 14, Calcutta-26) 

 A correct grip and a good wrist 

 action is extremely important.

 I am a righthanded batsman. 

 Whenever the ball stays a bit low, I get bowled or am adjudged 

 leg before. Why does this happen? 

 (Rajshekhar Rajkhowla, 16, 

 Dibrugarh) 

 Dont get up early. Keep 

 your head down at all times.

 I am a middleorder batsman. 

 I am not too comfortable against pacers. Should I practice 

 on concrete wickets to improve my abilities? 

 (Sushanta Topedar, 19, Calcutta) 

 That will help as will playing 

 with a wet tennis ball. Work with your coach on your footwork.

 I am an off-spinner. I face 

 difficulties in turning the ball on pitches that are not 

 very helpful. Please advise.

 You are not the only one who struggles. 

 On such pitches concentrate on control and bowling a good 

 line.

 and university teams in the past. Now I only play office 

 cricket. The problem is my body weight has increased over 

 the years and thats affecting my footwork. Please 

 help.

 No short cuts my friend. Train 

 hard and get lighter. Thats the only way your feet 

 will move better. 

 I am lefthanded batsman 

 and face problems against off-spinners. I often get caught 

 in the close-in cordon. Why does this happen? 

 (Ramesh Desai, 18, Calcutta) 

 Get close to the pitch of the 

 ball while defending. Get the bat in front of the pad.

 I am a medium pacer. Is 

 it necessary to come close to the stumps when bowling an 

 outswinger? 

 (Ronet Basu, 18, Calcutta-21) 

 That will help. A nice side-on 

 action will also help.

 How does one prepare mentally 

 before going out to bat? 

 (R. Shesahdri, 24, Guwahati) 

 Study the opposition and the conditions. 

 Dont think too much. And take one ball at a time. 

 I am a spinner. How does 

 one keep his cool when the batsman is on a marauding mood?

 Stick to the basics. Bowl a good 

 line and set a good field accordingly. Also keep varying 

 your pace.

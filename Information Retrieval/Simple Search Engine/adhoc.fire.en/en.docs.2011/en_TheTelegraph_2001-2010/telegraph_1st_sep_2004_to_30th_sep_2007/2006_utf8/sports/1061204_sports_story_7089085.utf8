Doha: For the large number of Indians present here, all roads led to Lusail shooting complex on Sunday. With Manavjit Singh being the joint overnight leader with Naser Meqlad of Kuwait in the individual front, the trap shooter was expected to clinch Indias first gold medal of the 15th Asian Games. 

In the end, it was a bit of heartbreak as the Indians could not keep up with the class and pace of their Kuwait rivals and surrendered the gold in both the team and individual events. While in the team event, India (322) lost to Kuwait (327) by five points, Manavjit initially put up a fantastic show in the individuals before getting outclassed by Meqlad in the later stages. 

The third silver medal of the day also came in shooting when the womens 10-m air pistol team (1142 points) comprising Harven S Rao, Sonia Rai and Shweta Chaudhary finished second behind their Chinese rivals, who got 1161 points. 

Manavjit, who finished with 130 points against Meqlads 133, did try to put up a brave front by saying that he was not disappointed with the result. Compared to what we did in the last Asian Games, four medals in two days are certainly a good result. Of course, I would have been happy to win the gold, but thats part of the game. 

Manavjit, who recently struck the gold in the World Championship to clinch the top spot in the world rankings, could not, however, hide his frustrations. The range, he complained, had to do something with the result. Its not exactly a level playing field. The wind is too much. Its difficult to do your best here. 

Manavjit, of course, was right to some extent. No doubt, the heavy wind that has been blowing since the start of the competition on Saturday, added to Indias problems. Last September, an invitation tournament was held at this range and India, too, were invited to take part. The National Rifle Association of India (NRAI) officials did not respond to the invitation. Kuwait did participate and that experience made all the difference on Sunday. 

Manavjit, however, will find it difficult to answer for his rather low performance during the closing stages of the competition. The Delhi-based shooter suddenly turned erratic and missed at least three shots to give his Kuwait rival a definite edge. Finally, Meqlad clinched the gold medal with three shots to spare. 

While the members of the trap team brought two silver medals for the Indians, the pistol shooters fared so poorly that it even prompted the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) secretary general Randhir Singh to express surprise. I thought they would finish little better, was the caustic remark from the former Asian Games gold medallist. 

In the team event, the pistol team, comprising Samresh Jung, Deepak Sharma and Ronak Pandit, ended seventh. In the individual, Samresh, who was adjudged the best athlete of the Commonwealth Games early this year, ended a shocking 11th with just 576 points.

 Quick Takes

 Grass not greener on other side

 Amsterdam: Harvesting 

 of the turf for seven of Germanys 12 World Cup stadiums 

 begins next week at a closely-guarded farm in the Netherlands. 

 News that their arch soccer rivals 

 would provide the grass for the tournament starting on June 

 9 stoked fury in the German media and prompted turf manufacturer 

 Hendriks Graszoden to keep the location of the grass a secret 

 in case of sabotage.

 It was a big shock in Germany, 

 with German papers saying weve lost already 

 if we have to play on Dutch grass, said John 

 Hendriks, one of four brothers managing the business in 

 the east of the country. Turf for the other five stadiums 

 will be sourced in Germany.

 Ashley boost

 London: Ashley Cole received 

 a World Cup boost as Arsenal closed in on fourth spot. The 

 25-year-old left-back played a full match in the 3-1 defeat 

 of Manchester City after recovering from a broken foot.

 The positives are hes 

 not injured and Ashley got better and better during the 

 game, said Gunners boss Arsene Wenger. We are 

 at the beginning of May and the competition (World Cup) 

 begins on June 10th. In five weeks you should see a perfect 

 Ashley Cole.

 Klinsmann 'calls up' 9

 Frankfurt: Germany coach 

 Juergen Klinsmann has called up nine World Cup candidates 

 for fitness tests next week after they all missed out on 

 checks last month.

 Schalke 04s Fabian Ernst, 

 Gerald Asamoah and Kevin Kuranyi, Bastian Schweinsteiger 

 and Philipp Lahm of Bayern Munich, Miroslav Klose and Torsten 

 Frings of Werder Bremen, Hanover 96 defender Per Mertesacker 

 and Wolfsburg striker Mike Hanke were the nine called up, 

 the German association said on Friday. 

 The nine missed the April checks 

 because of club commitments or injury.

 Dutch plan orange parties

 Berlin: Dutch soccer authorities 

 are preparing an ambitious schedule of parties in German 

 cities on the assumption they will go all the way to the 

 final. 

 Gijs de Jong, safety and security 

 co-ordinator with the Dutch soccer association, told a German 

 police conference on Thursday that thousands of Dutch fans 

 would stage pre-match Orange Parties in each 

 venue where the team plays.

 Portugal bonus

 Lisbon: The Portuguese 

 football federation is offering national team players their 

 biggest-ever bonus if they win the 2006 World Cup, the president 

 of the federation has said.

 Giberto Madail would not specify 

 the exact amount each player would take home, telling a 

 daily that, All I can tell you is that it will be 

 enough to buy a good car.

 Everything has been defined. 

 Now all that is left is for the team to play, he added.

 National League

 Margao: Reigning champions 

 Dempo Sports Club continued their impressive run of form 

 when they scored a convincing 3-1 win over Mohammedan Sporting 

 to move to the fourth spot in the 10th ONGC National Football 

 League here on Wednesday.

 Dempo, who led 1-0 at half-time, 

 scored through Samir Naik (6th), Isfaq Ahmed (54th) and 

 Roberto Silva (64th). Mohammedan Sporting reduced the margin 

 through an own goal by Dempos D. Ravanan (48th).

 Isfaq was declared Man-of-the-Match. 

 It was Dempos third successive victory and took their 

 tally to 19 points from 12 matches.

 In contrast, it was the fourth 

 straight loss for Mohammedan Sporting, who remained on 14 

 points from 13 games. 

 Dempo, who had beaten black-and-whites 

 in the away leg too, took an early lead when Samir Naik 

 took advantage of a faulty back pass by defender David Mkandwire 

 to chip the ball over the advancing keeper Gopal Das 

 in the sixth minute. (PTI)

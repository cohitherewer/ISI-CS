 Di Stefano stable

Madrid: Real Madrids honorary president and record goal-scorer Alfredo Di Stefano is making good progress following quadruple heart bypass surgery. 

The patient continues to be clinically stable and there is a clear improvement in the functioning of his kidneys, a statement from La Fe hospital in Valencia said on Monday. 

If this situation continues it is expected that he will be transferred to the ward in the next few days. 

The 79-year-old former player underwent the surgery last week after suffering a heart attack. 

Widely regarded as one of the greatest players in the history of the game, Di Stefano led Real Madrid to five consecutive European Cup triumphs between 1956 and 1960 and was named European Footballer of the Year award in 1957 and 1959. 

As well as his European triumphs with Real, Di Stefano also won eight Spanish league titles, the World Club Cup and the Kings Cup before joining Barcelona-based Espanyol after falling out with president Santiago Bernabeu in 1964. 

Born of Italian parents in Buenos Aires, Di Stefano played for Argentina and Spain during his 22-year career and retired at the age of 40 in 1967.

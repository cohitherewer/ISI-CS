 A special win 

 dedicated to Rhea, Aiyana

 'N' CHARGE - Leander Peas

 Leander Peas and Martin 

 Damm with US Open men's doubles Trophy

The 

 US Open doubles win is a testimony of the faith that millions 

 of fans in India have in me. Whilst I won the US Open junior 

 singles in 1991, this was one trophy that was missing from 

 the cabinet. I came very close to it in the past in the 

 2001 mixed doubles with Lisa Raymond but never experienced 

 the real thing. So this was special and precious more 

 so because I had my family with me.

 The communication between Marty 

 (Martin Damm) and I is the key to the success of this partnership. 

 The collective experience that we have have is invaluable. 

 We learn from each other and that helps the partnership 

 grow seamlessly. Theres been many a time when I got 

 hot-headed on losing a point and Martins cool temperament 

 is just what you need to calm things down.

 The reason I believe Martin and 

 I have done so well is because our partnership has gained 

 the trust that big tournaments like the US Open require. 

 Yes, its a new partnership not even a year old. 

 But the glue between us is very strong. His mental toughness 

 and strong belief that he can be a Grand Slam winner has 

 been the clincher.

 At the Australian Open, it was 

 our lack of belief that did us in. There is no denying that 

 the partnership was still very young at the time. Playing 

 in a Grand Slam is always a high motivation factor. Any 

 athlete can only peak four-five times in a year. The trick 

 here is to peak at the right time which allows you to be 

 in the zone. This win is a culmination of all of the above.

 Also, what is most important is 

 that we really enjoy traveling with each other. Theres 

 a lot of fun, games, laughter, jokes that we share, we both 

 love Japanese food, love going to the movies, enjoy the 

 same kind of music, we are fond of fast cars, read similar 

 kind of books. It would be fair to say that off the court 

 we are just the same, but on it, we are the exact opposite 

 of each other.

 I have a natural leadership instinct, 

 and Marty likes to be led. A lot of my partners have been 

 from Czech Republic, including the biggest of them all, 

 Martina Navratilova (who later became an American). Czech 

 athletes are extremely humble, solid, dedicated and perseverant 

 with no frills attached.

 Martin is also a very strong family 

 man. He has two kids and there is constant banter between 

 us on the joys and support system that a family provides. 

 This win is incomplete without a dedication to the two special 

 women in my life, Rhea and my baby girl, Aiyana. They are 

 the positive energy and strength that drives me to raise 

 the bar each time. They have been with me right through 

 the grasscourt season in Europe and then here in the US, 

 and it was an absolute delight to have them with me at this 

 special moment. This win is dedicated to them!

 Very often I am asked the question 

 what ails Indian tennis? I really dont 

 think anything ails tennis in India. Whilst I agree that 

 we need better systems and more professional training facilities 

 for our youth, I am of the strong belief that tennis, and 

 sport in general in India, is better off today than when 

 I was a junior.

 Look around you there are more 

 sporting events happening today for men and women, more 

 gymnasiums, more sponsors coming forward, more prize money 

 at stake for younger players, et al.

 But yes, in a country starved 

 of true champions, we sometimes build them up too fast and 

 too soon. In such a scenario, where adulation is given very 

 easy, to put young talent up on a pedestal after maybe just 

 one achievement can cloud the many other hurdles they need 

 to cross to become real champions.

 We need to give kudos where they 

 are due, but we must also keep motivating them to achieve 

 more goals, to put their heads down and continue with hard 

 work to aim higher. I truly believe that the responsibility 

 lies as much with us, as with the young sportspersons out 

 there on the field. (PTI)

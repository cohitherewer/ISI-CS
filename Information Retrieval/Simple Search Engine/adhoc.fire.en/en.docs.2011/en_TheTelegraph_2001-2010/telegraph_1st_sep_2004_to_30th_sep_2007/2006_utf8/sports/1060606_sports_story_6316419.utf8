 Surgery on Ruther today 

 SRIMAX

 Bangalore: Jockey Rutherford Alford, who was badly injured after a fall at the Bangalore races on Sunday, is still in ICU at the city clinic ? Hospital for Sports Medicine and Trauma (HOSMAT). His spinal cord has been damaged and his lower limbs are virtually paralysed.

 He has been given strong doses of steroid, said Dr. Shashidhar of the Bangalore Turf Club. He would be operated upon on Tuesday morning for stabilising the vertebra, added the doctor. 

 When asked about the gravity of injury and the recovery time, the doctor said: Once the surgery is over, the attending doctors in the HOSMAT will assess the exact position.

 Our Calcutta Turf Correspondent adds: Rutherfords mother, Geraldine, when contacted over her celphone in Bangalore, said: Ruther is in a very critical state. Tuesdays surgery may decide his future. But I will not allow him to return to the saddle once he is on his feet.

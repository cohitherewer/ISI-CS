 Brazilian help for Indian football

Brasilia: Indian footballers and coaches will get support from five-time world champions Brazil under an agreement reached here on Tuesday. 

This was decided at a meeting between Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Brazilian President Lula da Silva. 

Earlier, Singh had told journalists accompanying him on the tour that parliamentary affairs minister Priya Ranjan Das Munsi, who is also the president of All India Football Federation, had asked him to raise the matter with the Brazilian government, even though the subject was not on the agenda to be discussed by the two governments. 

The Prime Minister said increased interaction with other countries in the field of sports was the need of the hour. (PTI)

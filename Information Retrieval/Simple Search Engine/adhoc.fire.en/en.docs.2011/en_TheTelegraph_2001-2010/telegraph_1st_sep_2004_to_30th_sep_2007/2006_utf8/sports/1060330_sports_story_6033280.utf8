 Vieri, Vicente doubtful

 Vieri injured his left knee 

Milan: Italian international striker Christian Vieris participation in the World Cup this summer has been thrown into doubt as the veteran was ruled out of action for up to a month after injuring his left knee in weekend French league action. 

The injury comes just six weeks before Italy coach Marcello Lippi is due to name his official line-up for the World Cup, which kicks off on June 9 in Germany. 

Lippi on Tuesday said that he was waiting for their national team doctor to speak to specialists who carried out the scan on the 32-year-old. 

I spoke to Vieri and Im optimistic because I have to be, said Lippi. 

Similarly, Valencia winger Vicente is pessimistic about his chances of recovering from injury in time to make the Spain squad. 

As things stand it is obvious that I wont be going to Germany. It is going to be very difficult, Vicente told a television channel. 

All Im worried about at the moment is getting back to full fitness to be able to help my team finish in the top four.

 Fake journalist interrogated

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Chandigarh: The police on Monday interrogated the 21-year-old British national of Indian origin who was thrown out of the press box for allegedly placing bets on an online portal during the fourth day of the second Test between India and England in neighbouring Mohali. He was later booked under various sections of the Indian Penal code. 

He has been charged with indulging in forgery and fraudulent practises. Since he is a foreigner, the police were awaiting necessary permission to arrest him. 

Punjab Cricket Association president Inderjit Singh Bindra admitted on Monday that there has been a slip-up on the associations part in awarding him a valid accreditation. He said an internal inquiry, headed by one of the vice-presidents of the association, who is also a senior civil servant, has been ordered. 

I admit there has been a slip up? We have reported the incident to the police and have asked them to take necessary action. I was away in New Delhi for an International Cricket Council (ICC) meeting and came to know about it only on return this morning. 

The PCA will look into any lapses on its part, fix responsibility and take corrective measures. The police action should have been taken yesterday itself, but since I was away and inaccessible, no one managed to talk to me.

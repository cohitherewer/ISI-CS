Calcutta: Its been a dream come true for Deep Dasgupta. Having led Bengal to the Ranji Trophy final after 12 years, the captain turned philosophic on Tuesday. 

We Bengalis by nature are emotional. Theres very little to be proud of except for Sourav Ganguly and a few other things? Im happy that this achievement will bring happiness to so many people. A little while ago, an unknown congratulated and wished me. Nothing can match this feeling, Deep told The Telegraph, almost an hour after the semi-final against Baroda ended in a draw. 

The Bengal captain wasnt willing to compare this to any other career highlight, but said it would rank at the very top along with his Test debut and century. 

The icing on the cake will obviously be winning the championship to emulate another wicketkeeper-captain Sambaran Banerjee in 1989-90. 

The final will be in Lucknow from Sunday. This was finalised after Uttar Pradesh wanted to prepone the match by a day to enable their one-day hopefuls to participate ahead of the Pakistan series. On the other hand, the match had to be shifted from Kanpur because of organisational problems. 

With Bengals fate already decided at the end of the third day, there was very little interest left. It remained to be seen if the hosts could force an innings victory. It would have been a psychological boost ahead of the key clash. 

Bengal, enjoying a 378-run cushion, very nearly achieved their goal after having reduced Baroda to 278 for eight. But Connor Williams with an unbeaten 135 (363 balls, 505 minutes, 14x4) and Shekhar Joshi put paid to their hopes. The ninth-wicket pair left Bengal frustrated in the end. 

Joshi remained unbeaten on a duck after having faced 100 deliveries and spent 120 minutes at the crease. The Williams-Joshi partnership put on 47 runs before bad light stopped play, four overs in arrears. 

It was important to win outright? a positive vibe for the final. We tried our best but things didnt work out, coach Paras Mhambrey said. 

The hallmark of Williams innings was his patience and dour approach. Even the regular fall of wickets at the other end could not disturb his concentration. 

There were very little positives for Bengal from the final days action except for Shiv Sagar Singh being back among wickets. The left-arm spinner was given a long spell and he did not disappoint. 

Varying his flight and maintaining a probing line, Shiv Sagar constantly teased the batsman. There was also some turn for him. The four for 66 was his best figures this season in five matches. 

Subhamoy Das and Shiv Sagars return to form was good news for Bengal and should put them in good stead in the final. The batsmen are among runs, the Ranadeb Bose-Shib Shankar Paul combine is giving Bengal the breakthroughs? It all seems so bright for Bengal. 

Moreover, the positive attitude is a big plus which Mhambrey has managed to imbibe in the players. A now or never approach could bring in the results that Deep and Co. so eagerly await.

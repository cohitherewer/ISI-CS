 Boston: Terrence Trammell captured two spots on the US team at next month?s World Indoor Championships in Moscow with a win in the 60m hurdles and a second in the 60m sprint at the US Indoor Championships.

 Trammell, who won silver in the 110m hurdles in the 2000 and 2004 Olympic Games, ran the fastest time in the world this year to take the 60m hurdles, with Dominique Arnold finishing second and joining him on the US team in Moscow from March 10-12.

 Trammell then finished second to Leonard Scott (6.52 to 6.53 seconds) to nail down his second spot in Moscow, coming close to becoming the first man ever to win both 60m events at the U.S. Indoors.

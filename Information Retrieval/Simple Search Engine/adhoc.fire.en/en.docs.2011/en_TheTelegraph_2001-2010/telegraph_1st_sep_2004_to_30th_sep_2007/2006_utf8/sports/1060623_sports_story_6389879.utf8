 Van Basten: Ruud hasnt done much 

Frankfurt: Dutch coach Marco van Basten on Thursday criticised the World Cup performance of star forward Ruud van Nistelrooy and cast doubt whether he would start in the second round against Portugal. 

We have to conclude that what he has produced has not been all that much, Van Basten said after replacing the forward after only 55 minutes in Wednesdays 0-0 draw against Argentina. 

 Van Basten had been a staunch defender of the striker upto Thursday, and had even assured Van Nistelrooy this spring that he could count on a place in the Dutch team after he fell out with Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson, who had benched him. 

Van Nistelrooy had a bad opening game against Serbia-Montenegro, followed it up by scoring the winner against Ivory Coast, and had another lacklustre day on Wednesday. 

It is not unreasonable that we expect something more from him, said Van Basten, a coach who usually takes care to protect his players from media criticism. We are hoping for more. 

 Instead of Van Nistelrooy, Van Basten could opt for Feyenoords Dirk Kuyt, still very much unproven at the highest level. Asked whether the chances for Kuyt had improved, Van Basten said: The chance is there. It has increased. 

He dismissed the argument that Van Nistelrooy was guarded by two great Argentine defenders. The marking of (Roberto) Ayala and (Gabriel) Milito was hard, Van Basten said. But he faces people like that in the Premier League too. 

Suddenly, the issue overshadowed what should have been an relaxed day-after training session. 

The game against Argentina proved that the Dutch defence, even with an experimental and young line-up, is staunch enough to withstand some of the best teams in the world. (AP)

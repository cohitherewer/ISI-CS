Potchefstroom: Sourav Ganguly proved the selectors right by shouldering the teams responsibility with a fighting 83 while Irfan Pathan struck an unbeaten century to dig India out of another batting crisis and help post 316 for seven against Rest of South Africa here Thursday. 

Pathan slammed 111, but it was Sourav who started the rescue operation with a classy innings after India were floundering at 69 for five at lunch on Day I of the four-day match. The pair added 139 runs for the sixth wicket. 

The day clearly belonged to the illustrious for India captain who overcame the adverse situation bravely after yet another top-order failure against the pace attack had left India tottering at the brink. 

Sourav batted for over four hours for his 141-ball knock, which included 13 fours, to bring the team out of a deep hole. 

Later Pathan took a heavy toll of a tiring attack and reached his century with a massive six off part-timer JP Duminy. His bold innings came off 176 balls and he hit 15 fours during his 372-minute stay. 

Sourav, recalled to the squad after a gap of nine months, stepped out in the middle in the 11th over when Sachin Tendulkar (10) departed and India, at 37 for 3, were staring at an all too familiar collapse. 

Openers Wasim Jaffer (0) and Virender Sehwag (0) had not bothered the scorers and VVS Laxman (23) and Mahendra Singh Dhoni (6) were the other batsmen guilty of indiscretion and expansive flashes outside the off-stump. 

The visitors had their top-order wrenched out by the lively young seamer Mornie Morkel (four for 74) whose four scalps hit them in the guts. Nantie Hayward started the rot by having Jaffer leg before and then was Morkel got into the act at the other end. 

Sourav, who was batting resolutely at the other end, needed somebody to steady the situation with him and the young Pathan fitted the bill well. The two hours of the middle session was a period of consolidation with 125 runs accruing and no wickets being lost. 

It was a stretch where the seasoned Sourav exhibited his resolve and showed fine technique, playing mostly in the V and resisting the dollies pitched on his off-stump.

 Wright bats for Sourav

 John Wright 

New Delhi: Indias former coach John Wright has backed Sourav Ganguly, rubbishing most of the criticism heaped on the deposed skipper including those attributed to him by Raj Singh Dungarpur. 

Wright said it was not fair to suggest Sourav feigned injuries or that he was a lazy fielder. He also gave due credit to the Bengal cricketer for leading India to the maximum number of Test wins. 

The former New Zealand captain, whose stint as India coach ended last year, also praised Sourav for fighting very hard for some of the youngsters in the selection meetings. 

Asked to comment on the controversial remarks he reportedly made to Dungarpur, currently the team manager, Wright said the former BCCI chief was prone to making colourful statements. 

He is a colourful man and is sometimes prone to making colourful statements. I saw the news briefly on the Internet. I looked at it and said goodness gracious what is happening? because in India cricket almost follows you, in fact it haunts you, he told a news channel. 

Asked if he thought Sourav was a lazy fielder, he said: That is Rajs opinion.There were times when I could single out Sourav and there were times when the same could have been said of Srinath and Kumble. 

Crediting Sourav with backing youngsters, he said, I think he wanted to leave behind a legacy where there was no difference between the senior and junior players. (PTI)

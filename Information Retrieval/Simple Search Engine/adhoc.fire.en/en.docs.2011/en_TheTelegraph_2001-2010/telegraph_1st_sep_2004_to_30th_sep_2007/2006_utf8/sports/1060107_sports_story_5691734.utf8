The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Dont tamper with rules, market game better: Paes

 - Filing lawsuits to protest against ATP is silly 

OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Leander Paes 

Chennai: The first week of the new season is not yet over and the ATP is already under fire vis-?-vis the new rules being tried out in doubles. 

Leander Paes was one unhappy man at 1 in the morning, half an hour after after he and Martin Damm, the top seeds, lost the Chennai Open quarter final to Petr Pala and Michal Mertinak. 

On Monday we were rusty in our first match and had no business winning (against Ashley Fisher and Justin Gimelstob). Today (Thursday), we were in control and should have won. I am not a great fan of these new rules, Paes fumed. To put things in perspective, both matches in question were decided by the 10-point super tie-break which is now applied if scores are level at one set all. 

But dont the super tie-break, as well as the no-ad (game ends on the point after deuce) rules make the matches shorter and more exciting for the fans? If that is the case, why were there just 150 people present to see our match tonight? Ive never played in Chennai in front of so few people, retorted Paes. 

There could be some people who like these rules but I know there are many who dont approve. In San Jose last year, the crowd booed when the super tie-break was announced by the chair umpire at one set all, Paes argued. 

Damm had aired similar sentiments the other day, so did most of the other players here. And, as Mahesh Bhupathi informed The Telegraph from Mumbai, the reaction was equally hostile in Doha where he played earlier this week. 

Not one player likes these rules, Bhupathi said, adding that the lawsuit he and some of the top players had filed against the ATP in an American court hasnt been withdrawn. There is no plan to drop the lawsuit as of now, well fight it out. 

His one-time partner Paes disagrees with the manner of protesting against the ATP. They have been messing with the rules for two years, but taking the ATP to court is not the solution. Lawsuits are silly. The ATP, after all, is a body by and for the players. If you disagree with the boards decision, you have to try and persuade them to revert to the old system, said Indias Davis Cup captain. 

There have been some talks? they have said theyll re-evaluate the rules after three months. Well, I have full faith in the people who are presently handling it. Im sure theyll take the correct decision when they review he system, said Paes, choosing his words carefully. 

What, then, is the way out for the ATP which wants to make doubles more attractive so that many more people come and watch the matches? Tampering with the rules is not the way, it has to be done by marketing the game better. There is plenty of scope to do that. 

As a parting shot, Paes played the golf-tennis comparison card. Golf was not a bigger sport than tennis even in the 80s. But now, the No. 100 golfer on the PGA Tour possibly earns more than the world No. 10 in tennis. The secret behind the transformation of golf is simple: they marketed their sport superbly.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 New rules here to stay

Tokyo: Badminton will have a new set of scoring rules intended to shorten matches and broaden its appeal, the games governing body announced on Saturday. 

The Congress of the International Badminton Federation (IBF) voted unanimously at its annual meeting in Tokyo to adopt the new format, which will come into effect permanently at the next tournament. 

Under the new system, points will be scored by the winner of every rally, not just by a player who wins a point while serving as is the case under the current rules. There will also be no second service in doubles. 

 IBF agreed that matches would remain best-of-three for both men and women but would now be the first to 21 points for everyone. (AFP)

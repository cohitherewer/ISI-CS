Tokyo: World No. 1 Zhang Ning spearheaded Chinas 3-0 victory over The Netherlands which gave her nation its fifth straight and 10th overall Uber Cup title on Saturday. 

Zhang repeated her excellent performance from the Athens Olympics gold medal showdown against Mia Audina Tjiptawan by beating her 21-18, 19-21, 21-18 in the opening match of the best-of-five rubber. 

It was sweet revenge for her loss 12 years ago to Audina, who clinched the final match to secure the 1994 Uber Cup for her native homeland Indonesia. 

I lost to Audina in the Uber Cup when we played for the first time. Since then, we played each other so many times in the world. Shes still a very good player, said the 31-year-old Zhang. 

Audina, the Atlanta Olympic silver-medallist, was philosophical about her loss. Thats why Im still playing, she said. Today, it was a question of who has the best day, and she had the best day. 

World champion Xhie Xingfang gave China a 2-0 lead with a 21-17, 21-18 victory over world No. 39 Judith Meulendijks. 

I was a little bit tired in the second game, said Xie, who came back from 7-13 down in the second. 

Jiang Yanjiao, ranked 14th in the world, sealed Chinas defence of the Cup, beating Rachel van Cutsen 21-9, 21-7. (AFP)

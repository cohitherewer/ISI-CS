Melbourne: Top seed Roger Federer survived another tough day before booking his place in the Australian Open semi-finals on Wednesday as Swiss compatriot Martina Hingis fairytale run ground to a halt. 

Federer was below his brilliant best for the second match in a row but his sublime skills and unrivalled ability to raise his game when it matters enabled him to see off Russian fifth seed Nikolay Davydenko 6-4, 3-6, 7-6, 7-6. 

But there was no such luck for Martina Hingis, the former three-time Australian Open winner making her return to Grand Slam tennis at Melbourne Park. 

Hingis defied extravagant odds just to reach the quarter finals but the bubble finally burst when she lost 3-6, 6-2, 4-6 to second seed Kim Clijsters. 

The Belgians victory elevated her back to world No. 1 after she was plagued by injuries in 2005. 

She will play third seed Amelie Mauresmo in Thursdays semi-finals after the muscular Frenchwoman thrashed Swiss seventh seed Patty Schnyder 6-3, 6-0 earlier in the day. 

Federer faces 21st seed Nicolas Kiefer on Friday after the German beat Frenchman Sebastien Grosjean 6-3, 0-6, 6-4, 6-7, 8-6 in an ill-tempered match lasting nearly five hours. 

Federer had been taken to five sets in his fourth-round clash with Tommy Haas and had to work just as hard against Davydenko, saving six set-points to win the third set in a tie-break than having to win another tie-break to seal victory. 

US Open champion Clijsters started strongly against Hingis, winning the first set in little over half an hour, before the former world No. 1 began her comeback. 

Hingis won the second set and went stroke for stroke with Clijsters in the third before her lack of match play at the highest level following her return to the circuit earlier this month finally caught up with her. 

Mauresmo needed just 52 minutes to beat Schnyder and said she fancied her chances of winning her first Grand Slam. The 26-year-old was runner-up to Hingis at Melbourne Park in 1999 but said she was a much better player now. 

Thursdays other womens semi-final will see Russian fourth seed Maria Sharapova against Belgian Justine Henin-Hardenne, the 2004 Australian Open champion who beat top seed Lindsay Davenport on Tuesday to allow Clijsters to regain the No. 1 ranking. 

Argentine fourth seed David Nalbandian plays unseeded Cypriot Marcos Baghdatis in the first mens semi-final on Thursday with Federer and Kiefer to follow the next day. 

Kiefer made the last four of a Grand Slam for the first time in 35 attempts after a match lasting four hours and 48 minutes, the longest at this years tournament and one of the longest in the championships history. 

But the marathon quarter final was marred by an angry exchange in the final set. 

Kiefer had already been handed a code violation for swearing in the fourth set but tensions threatened to boil over when he threw his racket as Grosjean was attempting an easy volley in the 12th game of the last set. 

The Frenchman missed the shot and the point was awarded to Kiefer. Grosjean protested but the point stood and although the Frenchman won the game, he dropped serve shortly after to lose the match. 

Kiefer said Grosjean should have been given the point but defended his actions. Of course, its not nice but what can I do? Im a person with so much tension also inside.

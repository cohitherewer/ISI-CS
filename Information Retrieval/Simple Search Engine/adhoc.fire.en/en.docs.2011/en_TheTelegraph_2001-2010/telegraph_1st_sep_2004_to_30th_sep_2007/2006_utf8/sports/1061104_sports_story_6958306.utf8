 I will prove my innocence: Asif

 - Cant live with the thought I wont be playing World Cup 

 Asif 

Karachi/New Delhi: Pakistan pace bowler Mohammed Asif is to appeal against the one-year ban handed out by the PCB. 

Asif and Shoaib Akhtar tested positive for the banned steroid nandrolone in out-of-competition tests. Akhtar received a two-year ban and his personal doctor has indicated he too planned to appeal. 

Asif told a news agency and a TV channel the whole episode had left him shattered and that he was hoping to prove his innocence. 

I was the first player to give the tests. I had no idea my trainer knew that what I was taking was illegal. Those things might have been contaminated. I had stopped the vitamin supplement as soon as the team doctor told me to. 

I will contest the ban and in a day or two, God willing, I will prove my innocence, Asif said. 

Asif, who has played just six Tests, and Shoaib would both miss next years World Cup in the West Indies if their appeals are unsuccessful. 

I cant live with the thought I wont be playing in the World Cup. I am bowling at my best and am upset this thing has happened at this stage of my career, Asif said. 

It is the most difficult time of my career. But I am innocent. I never took any drug to enhance my performance, he insisted. 

He did, however, express regret that the image of Pakistan cricket had suffered following a series of controversies. 

I feel bad that I have let my country down. I wont do it again, he said. 

Asif also spoke about the trauma he had undergone since the positive dope tests were revealed. 

It was a shock. Its like the hero had turned into a zero. I am very disappointed that I am missing the biggest tournaments, he added.

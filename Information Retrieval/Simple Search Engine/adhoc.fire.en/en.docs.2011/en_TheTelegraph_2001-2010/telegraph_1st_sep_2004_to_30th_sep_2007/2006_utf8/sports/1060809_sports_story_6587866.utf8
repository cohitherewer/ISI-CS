 Sandipan held by Joydeep

 Fide-Rating Meet

Panaji: Calcutta-based Grandmaster and top seed Sandipan Chanda (Elo 2543) was held by his statemate Joydeep Dutta (Elo 2149) in the third round of the Hirabai Salgaocar Fide-rating tournament held at Miramar, Goa on Tuesday. 

Chanda employed the Nimzo Indian Defence and Joydeep went for a very safe Qc2 line. After 59 moves, Chanda signed peace when he realised that his winning chances have evaporated. 

Another stunning upset occurred when youngster Aditya Udeshi (Elo 2105) beat International Master Himanshu Sharma (Elo 2386). 

Fancied Somak Palit (Elo 2336) of Bengal was crushed by Swapnil Dhopade (Elo 2071) of Maharashtra. 

Celianne Carvalho is all set to become the first Goan Woman Grandmaster after she improved her rating dramatically, beating Vasant Naik (Elo 2022). 

Goas Pranav Zantye continued his fine showing by holding fancied Shankar Majumdar (Elo 2016) to a draw.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 The Dravid statement

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Islamabad: In a bid to settle the controversy arising out of Inzamam-ul Haqs obstructing the field dismissal in Peshawar, Team India captain read out a statement at a media conference at the Rawalpindi Cricket Ground on Thursday. The following is the full text: 

In my opinion and the opinion of the umpires and Match Referee, both of whom I have spoken to, the Indian team did not act in any manner that was unsportsmanlike or against the spirit of the game. If that had been the case, the umpires and Match Referee would have taken action. 

We have the option of taking up the issue with the relevant authorities, but keeping in mind the relevance, the importance and the context of the series, we have decided to let the issue pass and set it to rest.

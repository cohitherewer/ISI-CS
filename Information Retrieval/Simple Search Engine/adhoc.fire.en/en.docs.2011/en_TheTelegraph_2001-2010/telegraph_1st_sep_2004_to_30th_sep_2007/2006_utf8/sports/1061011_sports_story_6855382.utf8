 Sania out in Round I 

Bangkok: Sania Mirzas error-strewn serves resulted in her ouster at the first hurdle in the WTA Bangkok Open on Tuesday. 

The Indian lost 4-6, 4-6 against sixth seeded Meghann Shaughnessy of America in an hour and 21 minutes in the rain-interrupted first round of the $200,000 tournament. 

Sania, who slipped to 61st in the latest WTA rankings, double-faulted seven times and committed repeated unforced errors on her backhand. 

Shaughnessy, now ranked 43rd, has secured two WTA titles this year. Her career best was in 2001 when she rose to 11th in the rankings. 

I still believe I can get back to that level. I believe I have the ability, she said. 

In other first-round matches, Germanys Julia Schruff beat Emma Laine of Finland 6-4, 7-6 (7-5) and Sybille Bammer of Austria defeated Australias Nicole Pratt 6-1, 6-3. 

Resuming their match after the rain, Thailands Tamarine Tanasugarn beat Catalina Castano of Colombia 6-0, 7-6 (7-5). 

Main draw matches were rained out on Monday, with several first-round matches carried over to Tuesday.

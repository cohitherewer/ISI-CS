Doha: It was a day of disasters at the Asian Games. Tragedy struck early in the day at the Doha Racing and Equestrian Club when South Korean rider Kim Hyung-Chil died after falling from the horse. Thereafter, torrential rain sent the days schedule haywire. 

Almost all outdoor competitions were cancelled and rescheduled, including the much-awaited womens tennis final between India and Chinese Taipei. The Indian rowers, however, ended their campaign on a high winning two silver medals at the West Bay Lagoon. 

This was by far Indias best showing in Asian Games rowing, as they finished with two silver and one bronze medals. On Thursday, Bajranglal Takhar in the mens single sculls struck a silver while Dharmesh Sangwan, Jenil Krishnan, Sukhjeet Singh and Satish Joshi added another silver from the mens coxless four. 

Chief coach Ismail Baig said that the results could have been far better. We are happy, but we were expecting gold from the coxless four team. The current proved to be our undoing. It hurts because we had beaten Japan in the semi-final, he added. 

The Indian foursome, in lane two, faced difficulties in negotiating the strong current, in contrast to the Japanese, who were better placed in lane four. 

Meanwhile, confusion reigned after chief athletics coach Bahadur Singh said that tainted discus thrower Seema Antil will participate at the Games. She is coming to Doha and will participate for sure, he said. When asked when she will reach Doha, Bahadur said he has no information yet. 

While Chef-de-Mission Ram Lal Thakur was not available for comment, IOA secretary Randhir Singh said Antil can only come if she was cleared of the dope charges. Otherwise she should not come here, Randhir said. 

The Union Ministry of Sports has already said that the thrower cannot be part of the contingent as she has returned positive. The AFI, however, wants her to compete in Doha.

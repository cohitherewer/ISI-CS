The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Imran: Sobers was head and shoulders above everybody 

 - A TELEGRAPH EXCLUSIVE - Pakistans only World Cup-winning captain on his 

top allrounders 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Imran Khan 

Faisalabad: Imran Khan wasnt just an inspirational leader, but a hugely successful allrounder (362 wickets and 3,807 runs in Tests; 182 wickets and 3,709 runs in ODIs). He could walk into any team as a bowler and, towards the end of his career, often played more as a batsman. The other day, Pakistans only World Cup-winning captain (now a Member of the National Assembly) spoke to The Telegraph, from Islamabad, exclusively on allrounders. Incidentally, he had kind words for Ian Botham, despite having been involved in a court case with him (and Allan Lamb). 

The following are excerpts:

On allrounders

Strictly speaking, an allrounder is one who can either 

make the XI as a batsman or even as a bowler... To my mind, currently, the one 

genuine allrounder is Andrew Flintoff. He has it in him to make the England line-up 

either as a batsman or a frontline bowler... Im not counting Jacques Kallis 

as, today, he cant make the South African side as a frontline bowler. 

On whether wicketkeepers should also be categorised 

as allrounders

Definitely somebody like Adam Gilchrist... But, otherwise, 

Ill prefer sticking to the conventional definition... (After a pause) 

Kamran Akmal is, of course, shaping up very well and while I havent watched 

much of (Mahendra Singh) Dhoni, he seems to be taking the right steps... I may 

have something more to say once this tour ends. 

On his top three allrounders (in order of selection)

Gary Sobers: He was head and shoulders above everybody... 

I played against him once, in probably his last County match, and was thrilled 

to bowl him out... He was an incredible batsman and, in his prime, bowled quick... 

He could perform the spinners role, too... Any captain would love to have 

him. 

Ian Botham: Could play classy innings and also cause 

havoc in just one spell... Had the ability to make a huge impact in either role.

Kapil Dev: Quite like Botham... A big performer both 

with ball and bat... A very fine fielder as well... 

On whether he had difficulty in leaving out 

somebody

Richard Hadlee... Never an outstanding batsman, but 

was a devastating bowler in certain conditions... He wasnt like Dennis Lillee, 

though, who could bowl on any wicket.

On Wasim Akram

The greatest left-arm quick... I wouldnt label 

him as an allrounder.

On Andrew Flintoff

Had a superb 2005, but whether hes a great or 

not is only going to be known over a period of time. I have high regard, but wont 

place him alongside the Bothams... He hasnt played enough... He hasnt 

been a consistently big performer either. 

On Irfan Pathan

Has the potential to be an allrounder, but must work 

twice as hard... Remember, an allrounder has to perform two roles and, so, has 

to work on two areas... Pathan, however, shouldnt neglect his bowling while 

improving as a batsman... For his career, that can be fatal... Often, my own batting 

suffered when my workload as a bowler became heavy... When that happened, I had 

to work that much harder (on batting).

Finally, on whether the experimental rule allowing 

super-subs in ODIs will actually encourage allrounders

(Passionately) It must be scrapped... Cricket 

is an 11-a-side game and thats where captaincy comes into play.... A captain 

has to get his combination right, not try to rectify things by calling on the 

super-sub... Thats the challenge... I dont understand why the ICC 

went for such an experiment... In principle, though, I dont have a problem 

with the (experimental) power plays...

 Sania to take on Azarenka

Melbourne: Sania Mirza is set to play junior world champion Victoria Azarenka of Belarus in the womens singles first round at the Australian Open starting on Monday. 

Sixteen-year old Azarenka, world ranked 156, also won the girls singles and doubles titles at the Australian Open last year. 

Sania, seeded 32nd, is in the bottom half of the draw and could run into French third seed Amelie Mauresmo in the third round. 

Seeding doesnt count for much once you are out there on court..., Sania said of her first round match. (PTI)

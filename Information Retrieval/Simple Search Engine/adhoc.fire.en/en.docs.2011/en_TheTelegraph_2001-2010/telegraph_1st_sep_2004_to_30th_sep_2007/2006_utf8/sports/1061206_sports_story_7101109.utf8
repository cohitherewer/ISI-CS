 Experiments a hindrance to progress

- Sourav's ouster started The Indian slide 

 Mastermind 

 Ajit Wadekar 

The downslide of the Indian team started with the unsavoury manner in which Sourav Ganguly was ousted. Excessive experimentation with our batting and inability of our players to come to grips with the contracts system have further contributed to our dismal performance. 

Still, there are no excuses for our poor display in South Africa. The Indian team should have prepared itself better, knowing fully what to expect there. 

The groundwork was not done. The team should have either gone to South Africa much earlier than they did, or at least put the gap between the matches during the ICC Champions Trophy to better use. 

Nowadays information is available at the click of a mouse even if it is not forthcoming from the South African board. 

To put the entire performance in perspective, it should be said that our strength is batting and we have undermined it by the excess amount of experimentation that has been carried out. 

A player like Rahul Dravid can cope with the constant change in his batting order but not someone like Virender Sehwag who struggles when he is sent in the middle order. 

And pray what are we doing by sending Irfan Pathan in at No. 3 when even a great allrounder like Kapil Dev has not batted at this position! 

These experiments have become too much of a hindrance to the teams progress. You need to be mentally strong to play at this level and these constant changes have made players unsure about their roles in the team. 

There are so many players padded up, its a joke! No one knows who will go where! They look more like a team of schoolboys rather than the India team. 

It is time to identify 14 or 16 players for the World Cup. By now the players must know their jobs, whether they are openers, middle-order batsmen or what. 

Our other traditional strength is spin bowling and we have not used it fully to our advantage. We have Anil Kumble back which is a good sign. Though Harbhajan Singh has not been in form, I think he will get his act together soon. 

The same team was doing very well earlier but the downslide, I feel, started with the manner in which Sourav was ousted. 

Coach Greg Chappell had no business to send that e-mail to the board criticising Sourav, resulting in the spat being made public. What happens in the dressing room should remain within its four walls. 

I also feel that the poor performance of the Indian team in South Africa and in recent times in one-day Internationals show that the players are yet to come to grips with the contracts system which is new to our cricket. 

It seems the Indian players are yet to understand the implications of the system. They are happy to sit out when injured as they are assured of a fixed sum. I would advocate going back to the old system where players are only paid match fees and allowances. 

As for Sachin Tendulkar, I think he will bounce back. He is still getting back into the groove after injury lay-offs. But Im sure he will get stronger. (PTI)

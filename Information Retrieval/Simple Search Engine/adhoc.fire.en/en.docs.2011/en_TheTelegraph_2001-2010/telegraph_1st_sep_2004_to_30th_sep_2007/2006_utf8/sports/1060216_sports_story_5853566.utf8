 Super sub rule to be scrapped

Dubai: The ICC chief executives meeting has agreed with the ICC managements recommendation that the super sub trial should be discontinued. 

This recommendation will now go to the ICC executive Board for ratification at a meeting in Dubai next month. 

The ICC also announced plans on Wednesday to stage a Twenty20 World Championship in September 2007. 

There has been an explosion of interest in professional Twenty20 cricket since it was launched in England in 2003. 

We have already received bids from six to seven countries who are willing to play host to the (Twenty20) event, ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed told reporters after a meeting of chief executives in Dubai.

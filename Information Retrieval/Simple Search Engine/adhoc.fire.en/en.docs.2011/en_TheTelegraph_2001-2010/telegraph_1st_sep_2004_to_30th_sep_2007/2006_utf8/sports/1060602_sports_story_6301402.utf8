The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 EB goalies turn to hog limelight

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: With the transfer window just hours away from opening, the stand-off between East Bengal and some players over their eligibility to switch allegiance intensified on Thursday. 

In the latest twist to the drama, it was Naseem Akhtar who hogged the limelight. 

The East Bengal goalkeeper went to the IFA office on Thursday afternoon, apparently seeking information about transfer to Western India Football Association. Naseem hadnt made too much headway when East Bengal officials reached the spot and took him to the club tent. 

Naseems explanation was that he had got a job with Western Railway and needed to shift base to Mumbai. He was reminded that his contract was till the end of next season. 

Naseem couldnt be contacted later, but a club official insisted he wouldnt be released. 

In another development, Chandan Das ? who Mohammedan Sporting had earlier claimed they had acquired ? decided to stay back with East Bengal. I was asked to join Mohammedan Sporting by (coach) Subhas Bhowmick. But now I want to continue with East Bengal, said Chandan, showing off his token. 

The IFA expressed serious concern over potential problems that may arise once the transfers get underway on Friday. A large police force will thus be deployed in and around the IFA office.

 Now or never for Federer

Paris: After two weeks slugging it out on the punishing clay at Roland Garros, world No.1 Roger Federer faces the biggest challenge of his career on Sunday. 

If the 24-year-old Swiss can overcome defending champion Rafael Nadal in the French Open final, he will have gone a long way to justifying the assertion of many that he is the best tennis player ever. 

Federer will join Australian Rod Laver and American Don Budge as the only men to win four consecutive grand slams. It has only been achieved once in the professional era ?? Lavers second Grand Slam of 1969. 

It would be something quite incredible, said Federer. For the first time since 1984 the top two seeds have made it through to the mens final at Roland Garros. 

On that occasion second seed Ivan Lendl recovered from two sets down to beat number one John McEnroe. Prepare for something even better on Sunday.

London: Steve Harmison took two late wickets to leave Pakistan trailing England by 462 runs with seven wickets left at stumps on Friday, Day II of the first Test at Lords. 

 Put into bat after England declared at 528 for nine, Pakistan had 20 overs left in the day. In the 10th, Harmison enticed Salman Butt on 10 to chase a wide delivery and edge to stand-in captain Andrew Strauss at second slip. 

 Two balls later, Faisal Iqbal cut a ball from Harmison and Paul Collingwood took a superb, one-handed diving catch at third slip to leave Pakistan at 28 for two. 

With 13 balls remaining and Pakistan on 65 for two, opener Imran Farhat left a seaming delivery from third-change Liam Plunkett and was bowled for 33. 

 Pakistan finished on 66 for three with Mohammed Yousuf on 20 and night-watchman Mohammed Sami yet to score. 

Harmison, having missed Englands last four Tests with shin splints, took two for 15 from eight overs. Plunkett finished with one for 14 off two overs. 

 Collingwood had earlier hit a Test-best 186 as one of three centurions for England, who havent beaten Pakistan in a series at home since 1982. Ian Bells 100 not out and Alastair Cooks 105 helped the hosts pass 500 for the eighth time against Pakistan. 

The 21-year-old Cook hit 10 fours in 279 balls for his second century from just six Tests since debuting with 104 not out at Nagpur in March. 

Resuming on 309 for three, England scored 70 runs in the days opening hour and 58 from the new balls first 10 overs. 

But in the days fifth over, and only 13 deliveries after taking the new ball, Sami got an inswinger to knock Cooks off stump out of the ground with England having added just eight runs. 

In the second session, legspinner Danish Kaneria took three for ? Collingwood, Geraint Jones for 18, and Plunkett for 0 ? as England added just 69 runs before lunch. 

Collingwood was finally dismissed after 445 minutes of batting, stumped by wicketkeeper Kamran Akmal off Kaneria after his backfoot slid out of the crease. 

He totalled 23 fours in his 327-ball innings. He also added a stand of 120 with Bell to a 233-run partnership with Cook that broke a 44-year-old England fourth-wicket record against Pakistan. 

 Ted Dexter and Peter Parfitt had compiled 188 in Karachi in 1962. 

 Collingwood surpassed the highest score by an Englishman against Pakistan at Lords, beating Tom Graveneys 153 in 1962. He also beat his previous Test best of 134 not out, set in March at Nagpur. 

 Twenty-eight runs after Collingwoods dismissal, Jones failed to pick Kanerias googly while sweeping and was out lbw to leave England at 469 for five. 

Six balls from Kaneria later and Plunkett was caught by Farhat at slip. Farhat, who dropped three catches on Thursday, smiled and looked upward with open arms after taking the catch. 

 Batting at the No. 6 position which Andrew Flintoff is expected to reclaim for the second Test starting July 27, Bell at one stage looked as if he was going to run out of partners. 

 Matthew Hoggard padded up to legspinner 

 Shahid Afridi and was out leg-before for eight. Ten runs 

 later, Harmison (2) was run out by Mohammed Yousuf at deep 

 midwicket with England at 525 for nine.

 Most Test innings without a 

 duck

 Geraint Jones, playing in his 45th innings (and 30th Test) 

 at Lords has set a new record by not registering a 

 single duck in his entire career so far. He went past the 

 previous record held by former Australian opener Late Jim 

 Burke, who in 44 Test innings never made a duck. The overall 

 record, however, belonged to Sri Lankan Aravinda de Silva, 

 who made his first duck in 1994-95, ten years after his 

 debut in 1984. During this period De Silva made 2779 runs 

 in 44 Tests and 75 innings, before being dismissed for no 

 score.

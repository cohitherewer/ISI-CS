 Batting lower down will help Sehwag, feels Dravid 

 - Well have a happy problem when Sachin returns 

 Rahul Dravid in Abu Dhabi on Wednesday 

Abu Dhabi: Having proven himself as an opener, India captain Rahul Dravid said the team now has various opening options and could even think of sending Virender Sehwag down the order. 

Now I know this is something I can do. We can use the option of me opening whenever needed. We can also push Sehwag down the order, said Dravid, who slammed 92 in Indias series-equalling 51-run win against Pakistan on Wednesday night (as reported in Thursdays Late City edition). 

About the team combination on Sachin Tendulkars return, the captain said: We will have a happy problem. He (Sachin) will take up the opening slot but we have the option of me opening the innings as well. 

Dravid said Sehwag could learn things like tackling different situations while batting down the order, which would make him an accomplished player. It will make him a complete player when he bats down the order. He will learn how to rotate the strike better by playing in different situations. But it is an option we may or may not use, he said. 

The skipper praised the swashbuckling Delhi batsman for his impressive 73 after struggling in the ODIs versus England and insisted he was an important member in the teams scheme of things. 

He is a quality player. I have always said that he is very important in our scheme of things. I enjoy batting with Sehwag. We just kept telling each other to keep going, he said. 

Asked if it was unfair to leave out Indore hero Robin Uthappa after he had failed in the previous match, Dravid said the Karnataka opener still needed to develop some skills. 

Robin is young, it is a learning experience for him. He needs to develop some of the skills. You dont get to be in the Indian dressing room at 20, you just learn to be with the squad. 

Dravid admitted the team was under pressure after being 0-1 down but gave credit to the boys for rising to the occasion in all three departments of the game. 

Yes, we were under pressure, but credit to the boys for the way they responded. 

We played well, the wicket was slightly low. It was not easy to bat but we learnt our lessons from the last game. We learnt that if we could have a good start on a wicket like this, it would put the opposition under pressure. 

 The key to winning was the 

 good opening partnership. It was not easy to bowl with the 

 wet ball but we bowled and fielded well. (PTI)

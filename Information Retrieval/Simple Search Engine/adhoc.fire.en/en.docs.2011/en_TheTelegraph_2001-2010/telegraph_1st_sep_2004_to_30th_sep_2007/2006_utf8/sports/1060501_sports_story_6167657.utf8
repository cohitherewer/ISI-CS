 Honour for Asia, says Pawar

 - We promise 2011 will be as big as a soccer World Cup: Bindra 

 Inderjit Singh Bindra

Dubai: India and three other Asian countries Sunday won the bid to host the 2011 World Cup after defeating a joint proposal by Australia and New Zealand at the ICCs Executive Board meeting here. 

The easy victory for the four Asian Test playing countries ? India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh ? put an end to weeks of suspense on who would host the high-profile event. 

In the end, everybody supported the Asian bid. We have also decided that every third World Cup would be held in Asia, ICC president Ehsan Mani told a press conference after the meeting. 

Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Shaharyar Khan said it was a great challenge for the Asian countries to host the mega event. 

Although we started preparing for it late, we managed to pull it off. It is a great day for the Asian countries, he said. 

Former Board president Inderjit Singh Bindra thanked the other Asian members for their support. 

Without the support of all the members eventually, we could not have achieved what we did today, it is a landmark win, he said. 

We can promise that the 2011 World Cup will be as big as the football World Cup. 

In Asia you will see traffic stop, and massive television audiences and crowds for all the matches played. 

I was fortunate enough to be associated with Asias previous successful bids for the 1987 and 1996 tournaments. 

Both of those were great successes and we hope 2011 will represent a new landmark as a cricketing and sporting milestone, Bindra said. 

BCCI president Sharad Pawar said the successful bid for 2011 World Cup was an honour for Asia and reflected the cricketing worlds trust in the organising capabilities of the four Test playing nations. 

It is an honour for Asia and the four countries who jointly bid for the Cup, Pawar said. The ICC has cast a great responsibility on us, the BCCI chief said. 

Pawar said it would be golden opportunity for the cricket loving population in the four countries to savour the mega event. 

The BCCI president also said that he had been asked to take up the role of chairman of the organising committee. 

India will also host the 2013 Womens World Cup.

 BSF beat Salgaocar in marathon shootout

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: For 90 minutes, they couldnt score even once. But when it came to tie-breaker, both Border Security Force (BSF) and Salgaocar footballers looked the sharpest shooters in the game. 

In what was perhaps the longest shoot-out in the recent history of Durand Cup, BSF finally emerged winners over their Goan rivals with a 13-12 verdict in the sudden death. After a goalless regulation period, the tie-breaker also failed to break the deadlock as both team remained levelled on 5-5. 

In the sudden death, BSF won 8-7 when Salgaocars young midfielder Francis Fernandes shot straight to the crosspiece and BSFs Samrat Chowdhury slotted home a powerful grounder past makeshift keeper Micky Fernandes. 

It was a spectacular show of penalty conversion on Wednesday. In the 1994 Federation Cup semi-final at Goa, Salgaocar defeated Dempo 12-11. 

In the tie-breaker, Salgaocar used three goalkeepers, but it didnt help.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 India erred in taking WI lightly

 - Anil Kumble can still play a vital role in ODIs

Line of Fire

Michael Holding

Fans back home would sense that Indians have been a bit lacklustre in the past week. The issue of too much cricket would be raised once again. After all, Indians have played Pakistan in Pakistan, hosted England and been to Abu Dhabi ? purely for commercial reasons I must add ? and are now in alien conditions of the Caribbean. It could tire any bunch. 

The Indians have been trying to create a bigger squad to cushion the blow but now that they are trailing, it would be interesting to see if a few fresh faces are seen in the middle. The atmosphere in Brian Laras territory in Trinidad in the last two games could test the best. 

One cant help but feel that perhaps, just perhaps, this Indian team has made the mistake of treating this West Indian team lightly. 

They might have been mistaken in believing that they just needed to turn up at the ground to roll the West Indies over. It hasnt happened and there is little likelihood of it happening in the last two games. 

Everyone acknowledges one-day cricket to be a young mans game but its important to get your mix right. 

India have done away with Anil Kumble in the ODIs, but he can still be vital to Indias plans, especially on wickets in the Caribbean where the pitches these days tend to hold and grip the ball. Kumble has experience, is economical and never stops posing difficult questions to the batsmen. 

How critical were spinners to the West Indies was again underlined by the success of Chris Gayle and Marlon Samuels. The key for Gayle is his ability to change pace without any apparent giveaway to the batsmen. It helps him pin down the batsmen. 

Fans in India would remember Samuels for the exhilarating innings he played in an ODI four years ago when he took Jawagal Srinath to the cleaners. 

Samuels is now showing another facet of his cricket though I do believe he is still some way from doing justice to his enormous talent. 

When these spinners operated from two ends, India needed experience to counter them. 

The run-outs were foolhardy and inexcusable, especially from somebody with the experience of Mohammed Kaif. He messed up the basic of grounding the bat and it hurt his team badly. 

Countless fans of Mahendra Singh Dhoni would be despondent that he still hasnt fired in the Caribbean. 

However, I still feel this Indian team has men who put their hands up when somebody in terrific form hasnt come to the party. 

As Rahul Dravid failed in St Kitts, it was Virender Sehwag who came good. In Sabina Park on Saturday, it was Yuvraj who stepped in for Dravid. Dhonis failure in the third game wasnt because a bowler was able to get the better of him. In a way I guess that makes his dismissal worse! 

The West Indies suddenly are picking up the threads and Ramnaresh Sarwan has begun to show the consistency which fans in the Caribbean have always hoped from him. 

He is one of the soundest technician in the game today but it is not reflected in his figures. With two straight unbeaten innings of 98 and 115, one hopes he has turned the corner. Its about time he did it.

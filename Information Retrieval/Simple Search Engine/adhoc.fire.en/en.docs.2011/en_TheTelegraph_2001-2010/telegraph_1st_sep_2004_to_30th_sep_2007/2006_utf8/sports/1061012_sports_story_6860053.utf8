 Osim impressed by Manjit, Bhaichung

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Bob Houghton 

Bangalore: Twice the floodlights dimmed partially during the match. Once the proceedings had to be stopped after a stray dog invaded the pitch. Yet, the Japan coach, Ivica Osim, had no complaint. 

But his eyes simply flared up when he was asked in the post-match press conference about Japans poor passing in the second half. 

The condition of the pitch was pathetic. One should not expect better passing from my boys. Perhaps, we should have played more long balls than the short passes we started. There could have been fewer mispasses then, he said. 

Osim, however, was full of praise for the two Indian forwards Bhaichung Bhutia and Manjit Singh. 

Your captain and No.9 are good players. They kept our defenders busy, he said. But your other players are not of that level, so the two forwards could not receive enough support from their teammates. I really dont know why India preferred to play long ball tactics. 

While Osim, a former Yugoslav player, said that he was dissatisfied with the performance of his team, especially in the second half, his counterpart, Bob Houghton felt Indian showing was better in the last 45 minutes. 

You should keep in mind that Japan are a top team and are physically a very strong unit. Yet, my boys did a fine job in the second half. The defence did slip a few times in the first but they were more organised in the second. It helped the midfield and the forwards to play their game. 

Houghton was full of praise for goalkeeper Sandip Nandy and hinted that the Mahindra United custodian is almost a certainty for the Asian Games. 

I have shortlisted four above-23 players for the Asian Games. They are Sandeep, Deepak Mondal, Mahesh Gawli and Bhaichung. Today Deepak has got injured, but I am sure he will recover soon, the British coach said. In Asian Games, three over-23 players are allowed into the squad.

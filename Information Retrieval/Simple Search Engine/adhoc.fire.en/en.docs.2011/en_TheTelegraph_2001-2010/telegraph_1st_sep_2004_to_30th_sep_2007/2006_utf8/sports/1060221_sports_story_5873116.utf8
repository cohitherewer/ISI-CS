 Ronaldo hints at leaving Real

Madrid: Brazil striker Ronaldo hinted on Monday he would leave Real Madrid at the end of the season because of a lack of support from fans at the Bernabeu. 

Ive never felt at home at the Bernabeu, the fans have never treated me with affection, the three time World Player of the Year told a news conference on Monday. The fans have never accepted me. 

The reaction of the fans is something to take into account when thinking about my future. Ive always said that I dont want to be where Im not loved. 

I will make a decision at the end of the season. After all the effort I made to come to this club I dont understand why Im treated like this. I will decide after the World Cup. 

Ronaldo joined Real for 35 million euros ($41.79 million) from Inter Milan after the 2002 World Cup and is under contract until 2008. 

He was whistled at by a section of Real supporters after he failed to score during a 3-0 win over Alaves at the weekend. Ronaldos admission was a bombshell on the eve of his sides Champions League knockout tie against Arsenal. 

He has been Reals leading scorer in every season since joining the club. 

Ive thought about it and spoken with thousands of people and I have never understood why the fans have so little patience with me. As soon as I make an error people jeer me. 

I still havent thought about leaving Real Madrid yet. At the end of the season I will make a decision.

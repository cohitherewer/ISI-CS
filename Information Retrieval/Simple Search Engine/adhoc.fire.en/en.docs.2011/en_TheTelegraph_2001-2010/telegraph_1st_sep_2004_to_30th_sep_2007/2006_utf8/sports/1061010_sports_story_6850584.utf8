London: Chairman of selectors David Graveney hinted on Monday that England were discussing the possibility of captain Andrew Flintoff or Kevin Pietersen opening the batting at the Champions Trophy. 

Attacking the first 10 overs of the power play is going to be a critical part of the game and who is going to do that job is what were looking at, Graveney told reporters at Lords. 

Asked about media reports that Flintoff may be in line to open, Graveney replied: It is not necessarily about Freddie personally, it is about how we are going to attack the power play. 

People outside the team have talked about KP (Pietersen) moving up the order. Theres no doubt Sri Lanka attack those first 15, 20 overs and Im sure it is an area we need to look at. 

Graveney said another reason the England camp were looking at a re-jig of their one-day international batting order was the absence in India of Marcus Trescothick and Michael Vaughan. 

Without Tres and Vaughny, were obviously minus two people who would be leading candidates to go in at the beginning of the order, said the chairman of selectors.

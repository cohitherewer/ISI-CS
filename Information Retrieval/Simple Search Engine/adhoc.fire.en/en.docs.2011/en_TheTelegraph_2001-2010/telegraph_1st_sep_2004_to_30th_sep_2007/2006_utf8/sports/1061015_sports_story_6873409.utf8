 Arjun suffers setback

Sanya (China): Arjun Singh suffered a setback with two bogeys in his last three holes and dropped to tied 19th after an even par third round of 72 at the Volkswagen Masters-China. 

Arjun, who was six-under and at tied eighth place last night, is now six-under and will need a good under par round for a top-10 finish. 

Gurbaaz Mann turned in one-under 71 and was tied 21st at five-under as he had four birdies and three bogeys in his round. 

Digvijay Singh with a hattrick of birdies from 12th to 14th came in with a two-under 70 and moved to tied 21st to join Gurbaaz. Amandeep Johl shot a third straight even par round of 72 and was tied 56th at even par for three days. 

Defending champion Retief Goosen tightened his grip on the title after a five-under-par 67 which gave him a five-shot lead going into Sundays final round. (PTI)

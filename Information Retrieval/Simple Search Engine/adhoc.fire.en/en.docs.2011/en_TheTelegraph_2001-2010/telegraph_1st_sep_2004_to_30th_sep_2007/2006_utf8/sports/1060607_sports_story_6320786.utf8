 Randhawa, Jeev qualify 

 US Open

 Jyoti Randhawa 

 London: Jeev Milkha Singh 

 and Jyoti Randhawa played games of their lives to qualify 

 for the prestigious US Open golf tournament, which starts 

 on June 15. 

 Randhawa and Jeev authored a red-letter 

 day for the Indian golf by carding six and five-under on 

 the last nine to finish inside top eight at the US Open 

 sectional qualifier at Walton Heath booking their places 

 for the years second Major, the US Open to be played 

 at Mamaroneck, New York.

 It is the first time that two 

 Indians have come through qualifiers for the same Major. 

 In the past, Arjun Atwal and Randhawa played at the 2004 

 British Open, but Atwal came through as an automatic berth 

 for having topped the Asian Tour in 2003.

 Randhawa had six birdies on his 

 back nine after seeming to have blown away his chances on 

 the front nine.

 After a first round one-under 

 71, he was one-over for front nine and then played six-under 

 for backstretch to book his ticket. He finished his second 

 round in 67 for a total of 138 to be tied second, eight 

 shots behind the run away leader and topper marten Lafeber, 

 whose 64 and 66 saw him finish at eight-under 130.

 Jeev, who is having a great run 

 this year, including winning the Volvo China Open and leading 

 the Asian Tour Order Of Merit, continued his love affair 

 with New York. 

 Four years ago, Jeev qualified 

 and played all four rounds at the Bethpage US Open.

 This is Jeevs second US 

 Open, while Randhawa, who has played the British Open three 

 times, will be playing his first US Open. The two players 

 are also trying to earn a berth for the British Open with 

 their performances in next few weeks. 

 Arjun Atwal and Daniel Chopra 

 are playing in the US Open qualifier at Columbus, Ohio at 

 the Brookside Golf and Country Club. The Columbus qualifier 

 offered 21 players among who was 52-year-old Jay Haas, who 

 won the Senior PGA Championship two weeks ago. He first 

 played in the 1974 US Open as an amateur and returned for 

 the 84 US Open and the 97 US PGA Championship.

 Meanwhile, Michelle Wie came close 

 but stumbled late and failed in her bid to qualify as the 

 first woman for the US Open Mens Major.

 After starting her day with a 

 two-under-par 68 and remaining in contention entering her 

 final nine, she was ultimately doomed by poor putting. 

 Three consecutive bogeys on her 

 last nine resulted in a one-over 143 finish in the 36-hole 

 sectional qualifier at Canoe Brook Country Club. Wie carded 

 a two-under-par 68 on the south course in her first 18 of 

 the day. She signed for a three-over 75 on the north course.

 India keen to turn it around at Wanderers

 - Souravs comeback Test from today; No place for Pathan in XI

Johannesburg: Youre now entering (provincial outfit Highveld) Lions territory is a signage which cant be missed as visiting teams enter their dressing room at the regal Wanderers. It may just inspire the Indians who, thus far, have been anything but lions on what has become a disastrous tour. 

Captain Rahul Dravid didnt talk about it in the lead-up to the first Castle Test, which begins on Friday, but did say that the past can actually give a fillip. That we havent won a Test in South Africa is a motivator... 

Its to be seen what inspires/motivates, but the ask couldnt have been more clearly defined. Having shown no character in the ODIs (South Africa won 4-0), the Indians have the chance to make amends. 

As Dravid put it, cricket is an emotional sport back in India. We have the tools and, now, its a question of implementing plans... Ive been asking the boys to be positive, to draw inspiration from the good performances in the last four-five years... Were very keen, he pointed out. 

The captain, of course, believes the lack of expectations (given Indias performance in the ODIs) isnt such a bad thing. Its nice to go into a series with not many giving us a chance... In other words, the pressure is much less. 

If its comforting, the Indians have drawn the earlier Tests here in 1992-93 and in 1996-97. With some luck, they could even have won the last time. 

Incidentally, while Dravid is fit to bat, he wont be able to field in slips. Not in the first Test, at least. The (right middle) finger is fine, but I cant stand close-in... He suffered a fracture in the Cape Town ODI. 

He added: I wouldve liked to have more hits leading into the Test, but... Im at my best when Im in the right frame of mind... Im getting there and have the experience of conditions in South Africa. 

In particular, Dravid has fond memories of the Wanderers. This is where I got my first Test hundred (148, in early 1997)... I wont forget it and the memories are as if I got it yesterday... This is one of my favourite grounds... 

Its a favourite ground of the South African quicks, too. And, there will be five on view over the next few days. The Indians know Shaun Pollock and Makhaya Ntini; Jacques Kallis and Andre Nel well, but arent very familiar with the truly fast and furious Dale Steyn. 

They got the opportunity in the tour-opener (versus South Africa A) in Benoni, almost a month ago, but Steyn didnt allow a look-in. Indeed, he took five for 22 and his victims included Dravid, Sachin Tendulkar and Wasim Jaffer. 

The Indians are hoping they could bounce back, try and catch us off guard... But our guys have a lot of hunger and our attack has been hitting the straps at nets... Steyn did very well in Benoni and I expect to use him in short bursts... Hes consistently bowling around 150 km, remarked South African captain Graeme Smith. 

Smith, who had mild food poisoning the other day has recovered, but advised those going to Cape Town to stay away from the fish. 

That apart, he vowed that the South Africans would be positive. Our mindset is to be more attacking... Expectations are always there... Its about the demands you place on yourself... It will be fantastic if we achieve the level we had in the one-dayers... Were a highly motivated team... 

Asked how much of a difference Sourav Ganguly (who is hours away from playing his first Test in ten months) could make, Smith replied: Souravs record speaks for itself... After all that had happened, the big question was how he would fit into the team... He adds experience and could add a bit of hardness to the middle-order... 

For his part, Sourav simply commented: Ive been feeling good... I hope the team and I do well in the Tests... 

It rained for a while late on Thursday afternoon, but has otherwise been unusually hot in these parts and, so, the wicket here has attracted more attention than it normally would. Somewhat out of tradition, there are cracks, but Dravid chose not to read much into that. 

Smith maintained that the Wanderers always had pace, bounce and carry. 

As had been indicated by The Telegraph, Irfan Pathan wont have a role in the first Test. Harbhajan Singh is in the XII, but is certain to sit out as the thinktank isnt seriously considering playing both specialist spinners. 

The South Africans are expected to omit Andrew Hall.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Players will be picked on merit only: Vengsarkar

 - New selection committee chairman and Raju share their thoughts with The 

 Telegraph 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Calcutta: Its rare for the Board to name a former captain as the senior national selection committee chairman, but the Sharad Pawar group did that in Mumbai on Wednesday. Indeed, Dilip Balwant Vengsarkars appointment has raised the credibility level of the committee to heights not seen in recent years. One of the finest batsmen of his generation, Vengsarkar played 116 Tests (6,868 runs) and 129 ODIs (3,508 runs). 

Gujarat did make a noise about getting its nominee (Mukund Parmar and not Dhiraj Parsana) on the committee, during the intra-Zone meeting which preceded the AGM, but Mumbais proposal carried the day. Pawar, who also heads the Mumbai Cricket Association, personally argued for Vengsarkar. He received much support from Cricket Club of India boss Raj Singh Dungarpur. 

The 50-year-old Vengsarkar, who has been a Mumbai selector, spoke to The Telegraph soon after being informed about what is big news for Indian cricket. 

The following are excerpts from the telephonic interview: 

On being appointed chairman of the senior national selection committee 

Its a nice feeling... Dont know how else to react... In one capacity or the other, Ive been involved with Indian cricket for three decades and that relationship will continue. 

On the past few days when there had been speculation about his succeeding Kiran More 

(Laughs) I was normal. 

On priorities as chairman 

I wouldnt like to say anything much till Ive sat down with my colleagues and watched the Challenger in Chennai. 

On Indias performance in the tri-series in Kuala Lumpur 

We didnt do well, but Im the type to look ahead... Im going to focus on getting better, not spend my time looking back. 

On whether somebody like Sourav Ganguly (his roommate for a short while on the 1991-92 tour of Australia) can expect a fair deal 

I wouldnt like to talk of individuals, but players will be picked on merit. For me, form and fitness alone are going to matter. Anybody who is playing domestic cricket and meets the requirements Ive listed will be eligible for selec-tion. 

On whether selectors should be on the payroll of the Board 

Look, Ive just been appointed... 

On whether hes comfortable with the zonal system 

No... Im opposed to a zonal bias and strongly feel selectors must have an all-India outlook. Only the best should be picked, irrespective of the zone. After all, we have the responsibility to select the national team. 

On whether there ought to be better communication between the selectors and the players 

In principle, thats not a problem... However, you cant expect me to keep explaining to all the players why theyve been dropped. Ive got to be selective, but I wont be insens- itive. 

On whether he knows captain Rahul Dravid well enough 

Frankly, no... Opportunities to know each other better are definitely going to arise. Dravid, I think, made his India debut a good four years after Id finished my career. 

On the previous committee having named Dravid captain till the end of the 2007 World Cup 

Thats fine with me. 

On coach Greg Chappell 

I do know him... I played against him in the early Eighties... 

On the general belief that his appointment will lend much greater credibility to the selection committees decisions 

Youre indirectly asking me to comment on the previous chairman... Id rather not react. 

On whether hes going to be under pressure as hes starting off in a World Cup season 

(Laughs again) Even as a player, handling pressure wasnt difficult. Why must it be different in this role? 

Finally, his message to players 

If youre looking to make a comeback or eager for a break, then perform big and stay fit... Ive already told you what will drive selections... Im clear about merit.

Madrid: Real Madrid restored some measure of pride after a midweek Cup mauling at the hands of Real Zaragoza as they chalked up their fifth league victory in a row with a 2-0 win at Athletic Bilbao on Saturday. 

An early Robinho goal and an injury-time strike from substitute Raul Bravo earned Real a win over the struggling Basque side that lifted them to second, seven points behind Barcelona. Defeat for Bilbao left them a point off the bottom. 

Earlier on Saturday, fourth-placed Osasuna had to settle for a 1-1 draw at home to Real Zaragoza despite dominating their in-form opponents for most of the match. 

The Navarrans got off to a flying start with a third minute goal when Zaragoza old boy Savo Milosevic headed in after midfielder Ludovic Deporte ballooned a cross into the area. 

Zaragoza were a mere shadow of the side who demolished Real Madrid 6-1 in their Kings Cup semi-final, first leg on Wednesday and rarely threatened the Osasuna goal. 

But they still managed to snatch an equaliser against the run of play just before halftime when Argentine midfielder Leonardo Ponzio netted with a curling free kick. 

Sevilla moved up to fifth place, five points behind Osasuna, thanks to a 4-0 victory at fellow Andalucians Cadiz. 

Argentine Javier Saviola opened the scoring in the sixth minute and fellow forwards Kepa and Frederic Kanoute grabbed late goals to complete an emphatic win for Juande Ramos side. 

Real Madrid, looking to bounce back after their humiliation in the Cup, made a promising start at San Mames when Robinho gave them a fifth-minute lead. 

The Brazilian outpaced the Bilbao defence to latch on to a superb first time through pass from Zinedine Zidane and slotted a low shot underneath keeper Inaki Lafuente to score his fourth goal against the Basques in the league and Cup this season. 

Bilbao responded well after the setback and laid siege to Reals area but they were kept at bay by some assured defending from Jonathan Woodgate and several sharp saves by Iker Casillas. 

Real always looked dangerous on the break, however, and had three good chances to extend their lead before halftime. 

Robinho sliced a shot over the bar after being put clear and was denied as Lafuente got a foot to a powerful half-volley. The Bilbao keeper then produced a fine block to stop a Ronaldo drive soon after. 

Bilbao enjoyed the lions share of possession in the second half but although the home side put together some promising attacks they nearly always broke down on the edge of the area. 

Real made sure of the points when fullback Bravo side-footed into an empty net after Robinho had slid the ball behind the Bilbao defence in added time. 

Meanwhile, Chievo Verona kept up their bid for European football next season after Simone Tiribocchis double gave them a 2-1 win at Treviso in Serie A on Saturday, adds a report from Rome. 

The victory helped Chievo consolidate seventh place with 38 points from 25 matches, 25 points behind leaders Juventus. 

More importantly for Chievo, it leaves them just a point behind Livorno who occupy the last Uefa Cup qualifying place. 

The scoreline did not accurately reflect Chievos dominance over relegation-threatened Treviso. A goal in each half by Tiribocchi put Chievo in control before Marco Boriello pulled one back for the home side. 

Brazilian striker Amauri could have scored a third goal for the visitors with a late penalty but his kick was saved by keeper Matteo Sereni. 

Lazio preserved their unbeaten home league record this season with a 1-1 draw against Udinese, moving the Rome-based side up a place to eighth on 35 points. 

Udinese climbed one place to 11th on 27 points. 

Most of the attention was focused on how Udineses new coach Loris Dominissini would cope after taking over from Serse Cosmi, who was sacked in midweek. 

Instead, it was Lazios Tommaso Rocchi who stole the show, heading them in front in the 20th minute and then fouling Jose Vidigal in the area to allow Vincenzo Iaquinta to equalise from the penalty spot six minutes later. 

In the second half Lazio went closest to grabbing all three points when Ousmane Dabos free kick was tipped over by Morgan De Sanctis. 

Meanwhile in Premier League action, Tottenham Hotspurs European ambitions suffered a setback on Sunday when a late goal from substitute Daryl Murphy earned bottom side Sunderland a 1-1 draw. 

Fourth-placed Spurs led through Robbie Keanes goal seven minutes before halftime, the Ireland striker converting Jermain Defoes cross from close range. 

Egypt striker Mido, who watched his country win the African Nations Cup on Friday from the stands after being banned for six months for throwing a tantrum in the semi-final, came off the bench but Spurs failed to build on their lead.

 Takahashi best, Jeev ninth

Tokyo: Despite missing not less than a dozen putts in his final round, Jeev Milkha Singh managed a one-over 71 to notch his eighth top-10 placing this year at the $1.3 million UBS Japan Golf Tour Championship near here on Sunday. 

Overnight leader Tatsuhiko Takahashi claimed his second victory with the win at the Japan golf tours flagship tournament, posting a final round of 68. He finished with a 72-hole aggregate of seven-under 273 to pocket $260,000. Tetsuji Hiratsuka was three shots further back in second, with Sk Ho and Tommy Nakajima another stroke adrift in third. 

Jeev, the current leader of the Asian Tours UBS Order of Merit, finished tied ninth at even-par 280 at the Shishido Hills Country Club. 

I played really solid today, although my putting was not up to the mark and I left about 12 putts short of the hole. I think I hit the ball the best I have this year actually, but just did not convert anything.

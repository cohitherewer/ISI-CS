 Sachin: We will return triumphant from SA

Mumbai: Sachin Tendulkar on Monday said that the Indian team, knocked out of the Champions Trophy before the semi-final stage, would return triumphant from the upcoming tour of South Africa. 

We are disappointed at not doing well in the Champions Trophy, but we will return triumphant from South Africa. As a team we have to look at the positives. Dwelling on the Champions Trophy (debacle) will not do us good, he said here. 

 Sachin reminded the public about the teams run-in to the 2003 World Cup when they did not do well in New Zealand in late 2002, started badly in the warm-up phase , but eventually finished runners-up to Australia. 

 I keep reminding people 

 of what happened in 2003. We did not do well in New Zealand. 

 We also lost to Natal B team in the World Cup warm-up phase 

 and then went on to make the final. We beat everyone except 

 Australia, he said. (PTI)

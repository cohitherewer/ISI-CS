 Windies board in debt, CEO resigns 

 Bridgetown: West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) 

 chief executive Roger Brathwaite resigned after the organisation 

 racked up debt of $25 million.

 Brathwaite said that he would step down on April 28 

 after three years in charge. The board had intended to discuss 

 his future the same day. 

The past four years have been quite challenging, and now I leave, having done the best I could within the organisations framework, he said in a statement from his Antigua office on Saturday. 

Brathwaite joined WICB in May 2002 as chief marketing executive and then served as acting chief executive for six months before taking up the job permanently. 

The board is in debt because of problems attracting sponsors and a match schedule that hampered earnings. However, Brathwaite said WICB had stemmed losses during his tenure and generated a $1.3 million profit in 2003 and $3.6 million in 2004. 

 The recent securing of a 

 multimillion dollar loan facility for the board to assist 

 with its cash-flow crisis will allow it to operate the day-to-day 

 business until March 2007, he said.

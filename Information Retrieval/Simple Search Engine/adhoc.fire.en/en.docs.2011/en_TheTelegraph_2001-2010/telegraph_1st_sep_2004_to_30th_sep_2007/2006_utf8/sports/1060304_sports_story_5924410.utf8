 Bjorn Borg to auction Big W trophies

 - Swedish great wants financial security 

Stockholm: Swedish tennis great Bjorn Borg will auction his five Wimbledon trophies and two of his rackets to achieve financial security, an auction house said on Friday. 

Borg, the only player to win five consecutive Wimbledon titles, will put his trophies on the block at the Bonhams Auction House in London on June 21. 

The trophies, which will be sold together, are expected to fetch between ?200,000 and ?300,000, Bonhams said. 

Borg, who was voted Swedens greatest athlete of the 20th century, said he is selling the memorabilia to improve his personal economy. 

Obviously it is not easy to part with the trophies that symbolise all the tremendous effort, both physically and emotionally, that it took to win Wimbledon on five occasions, he said in a statement. 

However, I do need to have some long-term financial security for those close to me. 

Borg won his five titles between 1976 and 1980, including a gruelling five-set victory over John McEnroe in his last final. 

The racket he used in that game, and the racket used to win his first title in 1976, will also be sold at the auction. 

Borg also won six French Open titles before retiring at the age of 26. 

Even though the symbols of my victories are being sold, what I will always retain is the knowledge that for such a long period I was the supreme world tennis champion, Borg said.

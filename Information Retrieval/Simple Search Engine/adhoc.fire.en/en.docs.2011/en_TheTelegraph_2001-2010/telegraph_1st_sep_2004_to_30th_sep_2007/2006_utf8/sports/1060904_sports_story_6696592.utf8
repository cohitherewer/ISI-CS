 Strauss hails Pak pacers

 - Darren Gough ruled out of ODIs vs Pakistan

London: England captain Andrew Strauss said losing the toss and a clinical display of fast bowling by Pakistan led to his teams one-day defeat on Saturday. 

In a match played in overcast conditions and reduced to 40 overs-a-side because of rain, Pakistan exploited their strengths to win by seven wickets. 

It probably wasnt the best of tosses to lose, Strauss said. But all credit to their opening bowlers as they took advantage of the conditions magnificently. 

England have now failed to win any of their last eight limited-over matches, discounting the win against non-Test team Ireland. 

Man-of-the-Match Shoaib Akhtar impressed with four for 28 in only his third . 

The ever-improving seamer Mohammed Asif supported him well with two for 10 from his eight overs as England were bowled out for 166. Pakistan won with 20 balls left. 

Strauss has struggled against Shoaib previously.Hes bowled exceptionally well and hes bowled pretty much how we expected him to bowl, Strauss said. 

You dont expect any favours from him. We expect him to bowl like that time and time again. 

Despite his impressive performance, Shoaib said he felt only 80 per cent fit. 

Im just trying to bowl in the right areas, he said. 

Im still bowling at 90 miles-per-hour which is good enough for me 

Meanwhile, Darren Gough was ruled out on Sunday of the remainder of Englands one-day series against Pakistan with a left shin injury, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) announced. 

He is also unlikely to play any part in the remainder of the current English season with his County, Essex, after being advised to rest from bowling for six weeks a move which could scupper his hopes of appearing in Octobers ICC Champions Trophy one-day tournament in India. 

Goughs will be replaced by Durham opening bowler Graham Onions.

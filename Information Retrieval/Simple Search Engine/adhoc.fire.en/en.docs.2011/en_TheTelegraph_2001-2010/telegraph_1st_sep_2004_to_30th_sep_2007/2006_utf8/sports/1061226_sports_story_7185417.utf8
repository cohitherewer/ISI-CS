 - National A chess 

Ahmedabad: Seventeen-year-old G.N. Gopal of Kerala is on the way to become the next International Master (IM) of India as he completed his third and final IM norm, in the Round Nine of the 44th National A chess championship Sunday. 

Gopal, who has 5.5 points, gained his first IM norm in the World Junior 2005 at Istanbul and second at Spain in July this year. 

Another 17-year-old G, Rohit (Andhra Pradesh) earned his first IM norm, while 25-year-old K. Ratnakaran of Southern Railways completed second IM norm. 

Top-seeded GM Surya Sekhar Ganguly took the sole lead in the event by taking full advantage of a mistake committed by GM Dibyendu Barua in the French defence game to score a full point in just 31 moves. With this win, Ganguly leads the pack with a score of 6.5. 

GM Abhijit Kunte climbed back into the second spot with a win over IM M.R. Venkatesh to join Deepan Chakravarthy and IM S. Arun Prasad. All the three have six points each while eight players are on the third spot with a score of 5.5.

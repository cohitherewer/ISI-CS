 Tough Round I for Indians

Manila: Indian golfers had a tough time in difficult conditions at the Wack Wack Golf and Country Club, with none of the 10 in fray coming under par on the opening day of the Philippine Open on Thursday. 

The best Indian was Gurbaaz Mann, who ended with one-over 73, looking fine through 13 at three-under before hitting a bad patch, dropping three shots in the last two holes. 

Australian Scott Strange fired a four-under-par 68 for the first round lead. 

Gurbaaz Mann (73), S.S.P. Chowrasia (74) and Arjun Singh (79) seemed to be going fine before courting disaster. 

Mann was three-under at one stage before he struck a bogey on 14th and then a double on the notorious 17th and another bogey on 18th to end at 73 in tied 25th. 

Chowrasia (74) was two-under after 15 and then ended with a bogey-double bogey-bogey finish to go from two-under to two-over. Arjun was one-over for the front nine with just one bogey and no birdies and then slotted two birdies on 11th and 12th to go one-under.

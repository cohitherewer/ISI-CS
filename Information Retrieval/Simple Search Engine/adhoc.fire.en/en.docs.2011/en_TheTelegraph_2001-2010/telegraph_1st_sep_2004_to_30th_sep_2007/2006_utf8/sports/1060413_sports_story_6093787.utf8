The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Paes comeback was the stuff legends are made of

On a hot, steamy, tension-packed weekend in Mumbai, India just managed to edge out Pakistan in the Davis Cup Asia/Oceania Group I tie by three matches to two. 

We held our breath as the bitterly contested tie tilted to and fro. On one side lay the humiliating possibility of demotion to Group II of the zone coupled with a loss against our lowly-rated neighbours Pakistan, and on the other side, survival with pride and international prestige intact. 

At 33 years of age, exhausted and riddled with cramps, Paes comeback was the stuff legends are made of. 

 Heaven knows where Paes found the final 

 burst of energy

Heaven knows where Paes found the burst of energy to win the deciding set of the tie. His brave decision to play the final match was like putting his head on the block. 

The fallout of a loss would have hurt him badly and destroyed his pride. 

Aisam Qureshi of Pakistan was the Man of the Match. He is tall, strong, athletic and played well under pressure. With perseverance and a top-level coach, his talent could easily take him to the top-100. Pakistans No. 2 player, Aqeel Khan, though ranked 1416, proved to be a very tough nut. 

Lightly built, he produced a consistent all court game featuring a fierce double handed forehand and a reliable sliced backhand ideal for grass courts. In spite of a double service break in the first set and an early break in the second set, Aqeel could not put Prakash Amritraj away. 

Perhaps it was inexperience or just tension. 

Aqeels unforced errors at crucial stages practically gifted the match to Prakash. 

A 2-0 lead for Pakistan after the first days play would have been fatal for India. We were all critical of Prakashs performance but on hindsight, his victory against Aqeel on the first day won the tie for India. 

Prakash was very tense and developed cramps in his right hand and legs in later stages of the first set. The Indian corner kept Prakash going with frantic massage during the injury breaks and strategically-timed toilet breaks. 

But what we all lost sight of was how, in spite of cramps, Prakash doggedly kept fighting and never gave up. 

If Prakash can get rid of the tension and play loose and free like his illustrious father Vijay, he can certainly move up a few rungs in the ladder. 

Bopanna, with his big serve, failed to live up to potential. Firing 17 aces in the match, he served a weak-kneed double fault when it mattered most ? leading 4-2 in tie-breaker in the first set. 

If Bopanna had won the first set, the match could well have swung his way. What was most frustrating was how he tried to return Qureshis deep and powerful service. 

Standing on the baseline, he swung at the service with an action like swatting a fly and sprayed his returns all over the court and at times in the bottom of the net. 

Even Federer stands a few feet behind the baseline to receive serve. Your position to receive a serve has to be worked out with the speed, depth and angle of your opponents delivery. 

If Bopanna had accepted Paes suggestion to move two-three steps back, he would have gained a vital split second or more to return. More service returns, specially keeping them low, instead of trying to blast winners would have paid rich dividends. 

One hopes that Bopanna will learn from experience and work on his service returns. If he can consistently return serve, he could reap the benefit of his opponents errors and climb higher in the rankings. 

What can one say about the doubles. 

Can you imagine making your Davis Cup debut in a foreign country against a team, which between them has won 16 Grand Slam doubles and mixed doubles titles. 

Jalil Khan and Asim Shafik, poor fellows, were thrown in at the deep end with two hungry Great Whites looking for food. 

They thrashed around for a bit but were gobbled up in no time. Hopefully for another 3-4 years Paes and Bhupathi will continue to play Davis Cup doubles for India. 

This will give India one sure victory in future Davis Cup ties and we will have to win only two of the four singles. 

With standards in Chinese Taipei, Korea, Thailand and Japan improving rapidly victory in the Asia-Oceania Zone, Group I will be a very difficult job, specially in away matches. 

In fact India will be under great pressure to retain a spot in Asia/Oceania Zone Group I in future. 

A most heartening aspect of the tie was the superb organisation and the comfortable and colourfully decorated venue. 

The officials did not strut about with giant rosettes pinned on their chests, but worked with clockwork precision quietly in the background. 

The presence of His Excellency the Governor Shri S.M. Krishna, Mr Yashwant Sinha, cabinet minister Mr Manishankar Aiyer and chief minister Mr Vilas Rao Deshmukh, with other dignitaries gave the event much stature and triggered a promise of a Rs 150 crore tennis stadium for Mumbai from Vilas Rao Deshmukh. 

The Maharashtra State Tennis Association needs to be applauded for its enthusiasm and enterprise in accepting the challenge of holding a Davis Cup tie at such short notice. 

With the help of the hardworking Sona Chatterjee, Hon. Secy of the Bengal Tennis Association and Papu Ghosh, and the commandeered Kartick Mali of the Calcutta South Club, they produced a good grass court in about 4-5 weeks! 

Kartick, who was felicitated on court with a purse of Rs 11,000 between matches on the third day, could well be called the Man of the Tie!

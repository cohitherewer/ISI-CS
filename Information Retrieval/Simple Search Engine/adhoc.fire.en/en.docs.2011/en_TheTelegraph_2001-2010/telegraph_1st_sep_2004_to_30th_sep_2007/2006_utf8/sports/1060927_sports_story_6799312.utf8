 Leipus: Surgery, rehab... I expect it to handle all that

 - Plans for Indias first hi-tech sports medicine institute on track 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Leipus 

Mumbai: Former Team India physio Andrew Leipus ambitious plans for the countrys first hi-tech institute for sports medicine are on track. 

Im talking to potential investors and the response, touch wood, has been good... I intend having it in Mumbai, because Im familiar with the city and have good friends there... Thats where Ive based myself for some time now, he told The Telegraph on board a Malaysian Airlines Kuala Lumpur-Mumbai flight on Monday night. 

Leipus made a short trip to the Malaysian capital (instead of going back to Adelaide) in order to get a fresh visa for India. He didnt get the time to meet all the Indian players, but did catch up with a few before they returned home after a poor tri-series. 

Im a consultant to the Board of Control for Cricket in India and have people flying in (to Mumbai) for guidance... Im not without work, but my dream is to have that sports institute... Indias sportsmen and sportswomen need it... Surgery, rehab... I expect the institute to handle all that, Leipus pointed out. 

Leipus, who was with Team India from October 1999 to December 2004, deciding against pursuing a career in Adelaide he completed his masters, though as there were more opportunities and bigger challenges in India. 

The biggest problem is the lack of awareness (in India)... Also, those who can afford, keep heading to the West for surgery... And, when they return, theres the worry whether the rehab is actually on the course laid out... Believe me, lots needs to be done in sports medicine, Leipus said. 

Incidentally, his marriage with Sue is over. Its sad, but the years I spent with the Indian team just finished it... She was, initially, in Johannesburg and then in London... Being a career woman, she couldnt travel with me... Such a long-distance relationship didnt work out... Today, shes doing very well in Brisbane... 

Grinning, Leipus added: The Team India assignment is for a single man, yeah... 

Asked if he would consider again working with the Rahul Dravids, at some point, Leipus replied: Well, I do miss the job... Thats the truth... However, when Im looking at newer challenges, then why take a backward step? 

The likes of Ashish Nehra, by the way, keep consulting Leipus. If it wasnt for him, the quick wouldnt have played the crucial (2003) World Cup match versus England in Durban. If somebody needs a reminder, Nehra took six for 23 and put Team India on the road to the final. 

Ashish has recovered from injuries... Match practice is what he requires now, Leipus informed. 

Footnote: There are whispers that Leipus successor, John Gloster, is dating a commercial pilot... Theyre serious about each other, is how a source put it.

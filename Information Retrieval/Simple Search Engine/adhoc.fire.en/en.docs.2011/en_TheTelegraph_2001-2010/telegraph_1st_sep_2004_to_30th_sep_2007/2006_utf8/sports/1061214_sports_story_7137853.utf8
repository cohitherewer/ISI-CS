 Lara reiterates decision to quit ODIs

Multan: West Indies captain Brian Lara said on Wednesday that he was unlikely to play one-day cricket again after next years World Cup in the Caribbean. 

Lara, 37, told reporters after the West Indies defeated hosts Pakistan by seven wickets in the fourth one-day International that it was important for him to get runs in the World Cup. 

As it is I dont think I will be playing ODIs after the tournament, he said. 

Lara said West Indies victory, which cut Pakistans lead in the five-match series to 2-1 after the first match was abandoned, had been exceptional. 

The boys showed a lot of character. They bowled well, he said. We just need to go in with a positive frame of mind for the last game in Karachi.

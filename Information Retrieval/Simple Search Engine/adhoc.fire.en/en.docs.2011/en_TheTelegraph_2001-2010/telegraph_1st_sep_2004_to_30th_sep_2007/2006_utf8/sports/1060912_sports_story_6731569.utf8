Madrid: New entrant Ruud van Nistelrooy scored a hattrick as Real Madrid on Sunday sealed their first league victory of the season with a 4-1 thrashing of Levante, as reported briefly in Mondays Late City edition. 

The Dutch sniper got off the mark with a well-judged shot on the turn in the 17th minute and scored another early in the second half after a neat headed assist from his former Manchester United colleague David Beckham. 

He looked to have missed his chance of a hattrick when he fluffed a penalty after he had been brought down in the area in the 85th minute, but made up for the error with a classy finish in stoppage time. 

Levante, managed by former Real Madrid coach Juan Ramon Lopez Caro, ended with nine men after French defender Frederic Dehu was sent off before the half-hour and midfielder Diego Camacho followed him five minutes from time. 

In-form Sevilla, who crushed Levante 4-0 in their opening match, made it two wins out of two with a 3-1 victory at Real Sociedad, Mali striker Frederic Kanoute getting on the scoresheet again with his sides second. 

Bernd Schusters Getafe also maintained their 100 per cent record with a 1-0 win at home to Racing Santander, a well-taken winner coming from Daniel Guiza on the hour. 

Spanish and European champions Barcelona brushed aside Osasuna 3-0 at the Nou Camp, while Valencia edged a 1-0 victory at Atletico Madrid. 

In London, Argentine Carlos Tevez made his eagerly awaited debut for West Ham United when he came on as a 61st minute substitute in a 1-1 draw against Aston Villa in the Premier League on Sunday. 

Tevez, 22, who signed for West Ham along with compatriot Javier Mascherano just before the close of the transfer window on August 31, did not have a huge impact on the match which both sides came close to winning. 

Tevez was upstaged on the day by another debutant Aston Villas Bulgarian defender Stilian Petrov who almost won the match for Villa in the second half with a lobbed shot that was cleared off the line. 

He was named Man of the Match and earned the praise of Villa manager Martin Neill. 

In Serie A, AC Milan made a winning start to their campaign as Filippo Inzaghi and new signing Ricardo Oliveira gave them a 2-1 victory over Lazio on Sunday. 

The result left Milan, who started on minus eight points for their involvement in a match-fixing scandal, on minus five, eight points behind city rivals Inter Milan and AS Roma. 

Lazio, who started on minus 11 points, began brightly, using the pace of strikers Tommaso Rocchi and Goran Pandev to stretch the home sides ageing defence led by 38-year-old Paolo Maldini. 

Milan keeper Dida made a couple of acrobatic saves early on, but the teams nerves were settled in the 27th minute when playmaker Kaka picked out Inzaghi on the edge of the area. 

The 33-year-old forward, who struck three times in the Champions League qualifiers against Red Star Belgrade last month, showed that his scoring instincts remained as sharp as ever by angling the ball past Lazio keeper Angelo Peruzzi. 

Midfielder Andrea Pirlo had the chance to extend Milans lead shortly after the interval when he went through alone on goal, but his hesitant shot was easily saved by Peruzzi. 

Brazilian striker Oliveira, signed from Real Betis in the close season to replace the departed Andriy Shevchenko, made his mark by scoring with a header from a corner in the 70th minute just 10 minutes after coming on for Alberto Gilardino. 

Lazio pulled one back almost immediately through striker Stephen Makinwa, but the hosts were spending longer and longer periods camped in their half and only Peruzzi stopped Oliveira scoring again at the end of a dizzying run through the defence. 

In Ligue 1, Franck Ribery produced an outstanding performance as Olympique Marseille claimed back the top spot in the Ligue 1 with a 3-1 victory at arch-rivals Paris St Germain on Sunday. 

The French international, who looks set to take over from Zinedine Zidane in the playmakers role with Les Bleus, set up a goal in a flawless display by the visitors. 

We are very happy, especially for the fans because there is such a rivalry between them and the Parisians, said Ribery. 

We scored three goals in Paris, we have shown we could do something interesting this season, he added. 

Zidane, who was watching in the stands, told French channel Canal Plus he was impressed with Ribery. 

Franck made the difference tonight thanks to his acceleration qualities.

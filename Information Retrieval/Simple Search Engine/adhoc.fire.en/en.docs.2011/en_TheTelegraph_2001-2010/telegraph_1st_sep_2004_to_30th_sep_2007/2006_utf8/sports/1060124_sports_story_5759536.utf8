 No stopping Barcelona

Madrid: Barcelona stretched their lead at the top of the Primera Liga to 10 points with a 2-0 victory over basement side Alaves at the Nou Camp on Sunday. 

Sweden striker Henrik Larsson broke the stubborn Alaves resistance when he poked in from close range two minutes after the break and Argentine teenager Lionel Messi made it 2-0 with a follow-up strike late in the game. 

Barcelona have now won their last 18 matches in all competitions. 

Valencia moved into second place behind the Catalans after a 2-0 win at struggling Real Betis, striker David Villa taking his total for the season to 13 with a classy double. 

Osasuna slipped to third after their 1-2 defeat at Villarreal, Juan Roman Riquelme scoring the home sides goals with two controversial penalties. 

Champions Barcelona lead the standings on 49 points from 20 games, 10 ahead of Valencia and Osasuna. 

Real Madrid are three points further back with 36 after claiming their second league win in a row with a 3-1 comeback victory over Cadiz at the Bernabeu on Saturday. 

Missing leading striker Samuel Eto, who is on African Nations Cup duty with Cameroon, and suspended midfielder Deco, Barcelona were slow to find rhythm against their lowly opponents. 

Alaves, who have only won three matches all season, chased hard in midfield and strikers John Aloisi and Rodolfo Bodipo created early problems for Barcelonas back four. 

Larsson eventually broke the deadlock two minutes into the second half when he bundled in from close range after a low pass slipped through keeper Franco Costanzos grasp into his path. 

They were given a chance to extend their lead 20 minutes later when Alaves defender Josu Sarriegi felled midfielder Andres Iniesta as he raced into the area but World Player of the Year Ronaldinho sent his spot kick wide. 

French midfielder Ludovic Giuly hit the woodwork twice in the second half before substitute Messi made sure of a 13th consecutive league win when he netted from three metres after Costanzo stopped a Ronaldinho shot with his foot. 

In the game of the night, Real Sociedad and Athletic Bilbao fought out a 3-3 draw.

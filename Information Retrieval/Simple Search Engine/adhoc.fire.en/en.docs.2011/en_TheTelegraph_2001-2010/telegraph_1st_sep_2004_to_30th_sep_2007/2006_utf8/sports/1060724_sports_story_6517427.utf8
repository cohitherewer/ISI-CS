 Sania storms into doubles final 

 - Serenas comeback ended by Zvonareva; 

 - Schnyder upset 

 Sania Mirza and partner Marta Domashowska will take on top seeds Elena Camerin and Gisela Dulko in the title-round 

Mason (Ohio): Sania Mirza and Marta Domashowska of Poland stormed into the doubles final setting up a title-clash against top seeds Maria Elena Camerin and Gisela Dulko at the $175,000 Cincinnati Open here. 

The third seeded Indo-Polish pair thrashed Chan Chin-Wei of Taiwan and Tetiana Luzhanska of Ukraine 6-0, 6-1 in the semi-finals of the Tier III WTA event on Saturday. 

Their finals opponents Camerin of Italy and Dulko of Argentine tamed fifth seeds Emma Laine of Finland and Hana Sromova of Czech Republic 6-2, 6-2 in another semi-final on the hard surface. 

The Indian, whose singles challenge ended after going down to defending champion and top seed Patty Schnyder of Switzerland in her first quarter final of the season, will stake claim on her second doubles title this year and third overall. 

She last won the doubles title along side Lizel Huber of South Africa as second seeds at the Bangalore Open in February. 

Sania, who is at her career best 33rd rank in the doubles, will be making fifth final appearance with 2-2 win/loss WTA Tour career record. 

Meanwhile, Serena Williamss impressive return from injury ended when she lost 2-6, 3-6 to Russian Vera Zvonareva in the semi-finals on Saturday. 

Former world number one Williams, playing her first tournament in six months due to a chronic knee injury, ran out of steam against the unseeded Zvonareva, ranked 50th in the world. 

In Saturdays other semi-final, fourth-seeded Katarina Srebotnik of Slovenia upset defending champion Patty Schnyder of Switzerland 4-6, 6-3, 7-6. 

Zvonareva won the first five games of the match and broke Williams early in the second set to take complete control. The players traded break points twice during the rest of the set but the Russian finished off the match in the ninth game. 

It will be the second final appearance in three years at this event for Zvonareva, who lost in 2004 to Lindsay Davenport. Schnyder, the top seed, double-faulted twice during the tie-breaker, including on match point. 

Tie-breakers are like roulette, Srebotnik told reporters. You take your chances and hope youre lucky enough to win them.

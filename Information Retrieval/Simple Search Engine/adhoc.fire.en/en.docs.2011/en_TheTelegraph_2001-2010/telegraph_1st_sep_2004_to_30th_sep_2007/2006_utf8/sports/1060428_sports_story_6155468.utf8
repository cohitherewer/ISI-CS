 Afridi changes mind on Tests

 Shaharyar convinced Afridi 

Karachi: Shahid Afridi withdrew his decision of temporary retirement from Tests, the PCB said on Thursday. I talked to Shahid Afridi last evening and convinced him that he was a useful cricketer in both forms of the game and Pakistan needed him, PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan said from Lahore. 

I have not guaranteed him anything but have only made him understand his usefulness in Test and one-day cricket. I have to say here that Shahid did not argue and made himself available in national interest. 

Afridi had shocked the world two weeks ago by announcing his retirement from the longer version of the game to concentrate on the World Cup. 

Inzamam-ul Haq welcomed Afridis decision. I always thought that it was an emotional decision. He is a good cricketer in both forms of the game. (PTI)

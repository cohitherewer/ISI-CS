 A dream without end for Baghdatis

Melbourne: For all those in Cyprus or Melbourne or elsewhere who might be interested in congratulating Marcos Baghdatis on his surprise run to the Australian Open final, it would be best to keep the following in mind. Im still not answering the phone, Baghdatis said shortly after 1 am on Friday. 

Baghdatis, as is often the case, was grinning as he spoke, but his message was clear. A bearded, amiable Cypriot, he has come too far too fast to want to break free of the delightful bubble in which he finds himself in Australia. 

Less than six months ago, he was full of doubt and angst as he struggled to win a match on tour, but now, at age 20, he has played well enough in Melbourne to upset three players ranked in the top eight, including Andy Roddick. Now he is just one victory away from accepting one of tennis most important trophies from the hands of Australias all-time-great, Rod Laver. 

Though he is thousands of miles from his childhood home, Limassol, Cyprus, and from his adopted home at Mouratoglou Tennis Academy near Paris, Baghdatis has had an undeniable homecourt advantage in Australia. 

His father, Christos, is a Lebanese who immigrated to Cyprus, where he met Baghdatis mother, Andrianni, a Greek Cypriot. Baghdatis has dozens of relatives from both sides of the family living in Melbourne, and they have come in increasing numbers to his matches draped in Greek or Cypriot flags. Each time, they have ended up dancing and singing on the esplanade that surrounds Rod Laver Arena. 

The latest party broke out in the early hours of Friday morning when the unseeded Baghdatis overcame a two-set deficit and an untimely rain shower against fourth-seeded David Nalbandian to win, 3-6, 5-7, 6-3, 6-4, 6-4, in the semifinals. 

Its been the ride of his life, said his uncle Sam Baghdatis, who was wearing a homemade T-shirt with a picture of his nephew when he was 10 and the inscription, Champion Then. Champion Now. 

This picture was taken when he won the Cyprus under 12 title in 1996, Sam Baghdatis said. When I saw him play that match, I said to him, Ill see you on the big screen one day. You could see he had the fire in his belly, even then. 

Baghdatis is no Grand Slam champion yet. He still has to get past the top-seeded Roger Federer, who has beaten Baghdatis in their three previous matches. But Baghdatis, who arrived here ranked 54th, is closer to one of the games great prizes than any objective tennis aficionado could have predicted when this tournament began. Its just life, he said. 

Everything comes along and comes how its meant to come, he said. You cannot push things. It just comes. Ive been very lucky these two weeks, but Im not ready for it to stop. 

He was not an unknown quantity, particularly not in Melbourne, where he won the junior title in 2003 and then reached the fourth round in the main tournament last year, with his uncles, aunts and cousins cheering him on and representatives of Melbournes large Greek community joining in. 

Im going to stay in my tournament, he said. Im not going to start thinking about my great run here until its over. 

Hes already won Cypriot of the year, and its only January, Sam Baghdatis said.

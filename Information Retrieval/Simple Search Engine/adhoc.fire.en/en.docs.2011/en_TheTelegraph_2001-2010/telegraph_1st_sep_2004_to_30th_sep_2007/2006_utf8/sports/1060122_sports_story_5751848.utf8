The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 EB have multiple injury problems; Bagan tense

 - National League A testing time for coaches De Ridder, Das

 East Bengal coach Phillipe De Ridder checks out Bhaichung Bhutias condition during practice on Saturday. The star striker is nursing a thigh strain 

Calcutta: Its time for the arch-rivals to lock horns yet again, this time in the 10th National Football League (NFL) for the ONGC Cup at the Salt Lake Stadium on Sunday. 

Its also testing times for the two coaches, Phillipe De Ridder and Jahar Das. Both will be experiencing their first NFL derby and it will the first real test in their struggle for survival. 

The Mohun Bagan coach is fully aware of the importance of Sundays game. 

The result will decide whether I am fit to be a coach at this level. An East Bengal versus Mohun Bagan match is always different? the expectations are very high and you have to come out with flying colours, said Das after supervising his teams practice on Saturday. 

De Ridder, still very new to the Indian set-up, had a slightly different take. Every match is a derby for him, not just a duel with Mohun Bagan. 

The Belgian has not seen enough of this historic rivalry to feel the pressure. If his thought process gets transferred to his wards, it could be a boon for the red-and gold camp. 

East Bengals performance will show whether De Ridder has settled down and adapted to alien conditions. Just as success will help him earn fans respect, a flop-show on Sunday will surely teach him some harsh Maidan lessons. 

De Ridder has a lot to worry about. There are multiple injury problems in his team with Mike Okoro, Alvito DCunha, K. Kulothungan and R.C. Prakash all doubtful starters. 

There is also a question mark over Bhaichung Bhutia, who has a strain in his left thigh. The chances of his taking the field are 50-50, and a decision on his being in the starting XI will be taken just two hours before the match. 

It would be risky to play in this condition, said Bhaichung. But since it is a Mohun Bagan match, I would like to play. 

The star striker felt it was too early in the NFL to play a team like Mohun Bagan who have settled down. 

De Ridder, however, is not too worried over the injury problems. Like a professional, he has chalked out an alternative plan if the likes of Bhaichung, Okoro and Alvito fail to take the field. 

Whatever be the resources at his disposal, the Belgian coach is likely to adopt an attacking strategy. He has Cameroonians Guy Ndem and Marshall to pick from, with the former looking to be his first choice. 

There was a hint of nervousness in the Mohun Bagan camp on the eve of D-Day. It will be a war of tactics. We have different strategies for different situations, hopefully it will work out, said Das. 

The 3-5-2 system, Das felt, would be effective both in attack and defence. 

The coach also hoped that his new foreigner duo Coffi Agbessi and Awudu Ibrahim would play key roles on Sunday. We are going to use Agbessi in a different way and Ibrahim will be a changed player, said Das. 

Our defence is not that organised but we have taken lessons from the last matches and hopefully wont repeat mistakes, remarked Das. 

Theres no doubt that both Das and De Ridder will keep fingers crossed till the final whistle is blown on Sunday evening. 

After all, success or failure is not in their hands. Its the players who will make or break them.

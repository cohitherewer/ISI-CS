 Agarkar aims to start afresh

Colombo: Ajit Agarkar feels that notwithstanding his impressive show on the tour of the West Indies, he has to start all over again in the Unitech Cup tri-series. 

You take confidence from a good series but confidence alone doesnt help. At the end of the day you need to perform well on the given day, the Team India mediumpacer said after a practice session here on Sunday. You need to go and bowl the ball on the right spot. 

Agarkar was Indias best seamer with nine wickets from five matches in the one-dayers in the Caribbean, but was dropped from the subsequent Test squad. 

On whether he found starting afresh for each series difficult to handle, more so after a gap, Agarkar said, Not really. I am not worried about the past. I stay focused on the present. I dont think about which form of the game I am playing anymore. 

The Mumbai seamer said he was enjoying the responsibility of leading Indias pace attack in the one-day team. 

Yes, any player would want to have responsibility. I enjoy it, not only the responsibility but also the pressure that comes with it, he said.

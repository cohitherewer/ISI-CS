 Injured Sania may pull out of Qatar meet

Dubai: An elbow injury may force Indias Sania Mirza, who lost to Martina Hingis in the first round of the Dubai Open on Tuesday, to pull out of the Qatar Open which begins in Doha from February 27. 

The Indian tennis ace played with a strapped right elbow as she went down to the five-time Grand Slam champion Hingis 3-6, 5-7. 

I got my elbow injured while playing in the singles during the Bangalore Open. I have been carrying a few injuries over the past few weeks and that may lead me to pull out of the Doha meet, Sania said. 

Sania, currently ranked at No. 36 in the world, applauded the crowd for the support she got from them. 

It is unfortunate that I had to run into Martina Hingis in the first round, said Sania, the doubles winner at the Bangalore Open last week. 

 Hingis, however, seemed a bit uncomfortable and surprised with the way the crowd cheered for the Indian teenager. 

It wasnt the greatest match Ive played, but Im through, Hingis said. It felt like a soccer game out there but it didnt really bother me. Maybe in the past I would get annoyed by the crowd but today I just tried to go through it. 

But I just couldnt find my rhythm, coming from playing indoors. I came here on Friday, but it always takes you a couple of matches.

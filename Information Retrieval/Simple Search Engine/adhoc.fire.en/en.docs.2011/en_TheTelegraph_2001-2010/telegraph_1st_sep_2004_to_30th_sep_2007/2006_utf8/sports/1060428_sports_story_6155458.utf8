 PCB wants Majid to replace Sunny

 Majid Khan 

Islamabad: The PCB has suggested to the ICC that Majid Khan would be an ideal candidate to replace ex-India captain Sunil Gavaskar as head of the Cricket Committee. 

Majid, a former Pakistan skipper, has also been chief executive of the PCB as well as manager of the national team. 

Accusing Gavaskar of influencing ICC decisions, the PCB has demanded a change of guard in the Cricket Committee. 

It is no secret that Pakistan are not very satisfied with the functioning of the former Indian captain as head of the committee and they feel the time has come for a change, a PCB source was quoted as saying in a newspaper here on Thursday. 

 The PCB is miffed at the rejection of all its four candidates for Match Referee by the Cricket Committee, which added former Indian fast bowler Jawagal Srinath to the Elite Panel earlier this week. 

The PCB also implied biased behaviour as it pointed out that Srinath was on the bowling action review group which heard the appeal of pacer Shabbir Ahmed against the 12-month ban imposed on him for an illegal action. (Agencies)

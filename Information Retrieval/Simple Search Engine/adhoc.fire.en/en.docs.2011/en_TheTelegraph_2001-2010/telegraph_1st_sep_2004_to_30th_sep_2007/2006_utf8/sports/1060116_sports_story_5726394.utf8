Calcutta: East Bengal rode a brilliant Bhaichung Bhutia strike to scrape past Mohammedan Sporting in the National Football League opener a few days ago. In the next match, the India captain was at it again, against Salgaocar at the Salt Lake Stadium on Sunday, but his teammates failed to protect it as the Goan outfit held the three-time champions 1-1 under lights. 

Bhaichung put East Bengal ahead in the 33rd minute. Then 15 minutes into the second half, Brazilian Favio Dos Passos levelled the scoreline. It remained so till the end, but in the process was told the tale of the home teams inability get inspired by the ace striker. 

His upfront partner R. C. Prakash needed some mention in this connection. It was surprising to see him being there on the field for 78 minutes. He did nothing except squandering some positive moves initiated by his teammates. 

The red-and-golds effected one change in the starting line-up from their last match, with Rajat Ghosh Dastidar replacing Naseem Akhtar. It was again Anupam Sarkar and Covan Lawrence, who saved the team from blushes on several occasions. 

With Salgaocar midfielders having much of the ball possession, East Bengal were not allowed to play their normal game. But Bhaichungs goal had all the elements which people come to see the game for, not only here, but all over the globe. 

Having received a pass from Jayanta Sen, it was a solo effort from nearly 45 yards. Bhaichung, with his excellent turn, got past one defender and deceived another as he opened some free space in front of him. Then was unleashed a firm 25-yarder and Salgaocar keeper Sangram Mukherjee was totally caught unawares. 

Just a minute from the breather, both K. Kulothungan and Ashim Biswas were booked by referee Dipak Kumar Dey of Assam for getting engaged in a brawl. More set of rough plays ensued, as the referee struggled to tackle the situation. 

East Bengals party was spoiled when the second-half substitute Samson Singhs cross from the right was headed home by Fabio.

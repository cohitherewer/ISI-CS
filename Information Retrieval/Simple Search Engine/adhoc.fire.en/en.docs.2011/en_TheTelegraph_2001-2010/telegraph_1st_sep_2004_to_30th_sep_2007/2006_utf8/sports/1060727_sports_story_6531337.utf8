 Captaincy doesnt make me different

 - Underdog tag suits us: Prince

Colombo: Ashwell Prince leads South Africa as their first coloured captain in the Test series against Sri Lanka here from Thursday knowing he may have inspired a new generation of players back home. 

For someone who dared not dream of playing international cricket as a youngster, its a big honour, Prince said in an interview ahead of the first Test at the Sinhalese Sports Club. 

Prince, 29, was appointed skipper for the two-Test series after regular captain Graeme Smith twisted an ankle prior to the tour and vice-captain Jacques Kallis was ruled out with a tennis elbow injury. 

Prince was included in South Africas team for a Test match against Australia in Johannesburg in February 2002 on the back of the governments controversial quota system that made it compulsory to draft black players. In the beginning, you never knew whether you were there in the side because of the quota system or you were really good enough to play, said Prince, who has now played 21 Tests. 

But when I grew older and became mature, I realised I did not have to prove anything to anyone. Guys like (Makhaya) Ntini, Herschelle (Gibbs), me and many others have laid the foundation for the next generation of black players. They wont have to go through what we went through. 

The dramatic changes in South Africa have lessened the pressure on Prince being the countrys first black captain. 

I know I am part of history but frankly that makes no difference to me, he said. It does not make me a different person. I still have to go out there and bat and field well. The only changes are the toss, making bowling changes and things like that. 

With Smith and Kallis out and veteran allrounder Shaun Pollock missing the first Test following the birth of his second child, the South Africans face an uphill task in the upcoming series. 

Prince, however, said the tag of underdogs suited his team fine. We know we are without three of our best players but we have to get on with the game, he said.

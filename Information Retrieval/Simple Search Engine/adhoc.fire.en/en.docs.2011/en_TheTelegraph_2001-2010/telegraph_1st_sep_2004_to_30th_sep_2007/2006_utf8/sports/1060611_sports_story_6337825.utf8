 Fifa to review goal

Berlin: The first own goal of the World Cup, scored by Paraguay captain Carlos Gamarra, could be credited to England skipper David Beckham after a video review, Fifa said on Saturday. 

A Fifa spokesman said the only goal of the Group B match between England and Paraguay would be studied at a routine meeting of Fifas Technical Study Group (TSG). 

The TSG decides who should be credited with so-called dubious goals, and said before the tournament they were keen to limit own goals to a minimum. 

Fifa also officially corrected the time of the goal from the fourth to the third minute after a timing review.

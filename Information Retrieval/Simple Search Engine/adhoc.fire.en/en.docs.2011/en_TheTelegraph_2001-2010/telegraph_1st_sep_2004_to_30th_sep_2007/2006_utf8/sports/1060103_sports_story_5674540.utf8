 Murray raring to go after a demanding pre-season

 - I share the same never-say-die attitude with Hewitt 

Mark Hodgkinson

With Andy Murray about to open his first full season on the main tour, he is now able to contemplate the genuine possibility of trading forehands with more of his boyhood idols. 

Should the Scottish teenager reach the quarter finals at his first event of the year in Adelaide this week, there is every chance that he will meet Australian Lleyton Hewitt, a player he has always followed and admired. 

Murray said on Sunday that he and Hewitt, an Adelaide local famed for his combative and ultra-competitive tennis, share the same never-say-die attitude. The 18-year-old disclosed that he has regularly learned from watching Hewitt, a former world No 1 and last years runner-up at the Australian Open, during his televised matches. 

Murray has been paired in the opening round with a qualifier, with the match to be played on Tuesday, and if he wins that his likely second-round opponent is Czech Tomas Berdych, an exceptionally talented ball-striker and another young player starting to make an impression on the tour. 

Hewitt, the only top-10 player at Adelaides Memorial Drive, would probably then await in the quarter finals. A match between those two would certainly not be meek and self-effacing tennis, as both thrive on competition. 

I liked Hewitt a lot when I was growing up, Murray said. He was one of the main guys I watched closely when I was younger. Im quite different to Hewitt in the way we play, but I think we have much the same attitude in all our matches, a never-say-die attitude. We both never give up. It would be great to play Hewitt in the quarter finals. I have a lot of respect for the way he plays ?? he fights every match and has won grand slams. 

Murray said that he felt primed for the first match back after his demanding pre-season preparation programme in South Africa. I worked very hard in South Africa and for three weeks before that, and now I feel that when I walk on court I will know that I really couldnt have done much more to prepare. 

It has been great, as it has been the first time that I have had the chance to have a solid training block like that. But I know that people will probably still question my fitness, Murray said. 

Interestingly, Murray spent a significant chunk of his court time in South Africa working on his volleys. But I didnt work on coming into the net more. I just worked on my volleys a lot and making them a lot more solid so that when I do come in Im not panicking when I get there. I feel that my game is quite rounded now. I feel that Im a little more than just being a base-liner, he said. 

Reaching the top 20 by the close of the season should be an achievable ambition. I dont have any ranking points to defend for the first few weeks of the year so if I do well then I think that I can do it. 

This year the goal is to win the big matches because if Im going to get into the top 20 then I have to do well at the grand slams and the Masters Series tournaments. I feel good and if I play as consistently as I did at the end of last year then Ive got a good chance, Murray said. 

Tim Henman has a difficult draw in Doha with an opening-round match against French teenager Richard Gasquet, the third seed. The British No 1, who has dropped outside the worlds top 30, has made a full recovery from the rib injury, which he sustained at the end of last season. The Doha field is headed by Roger Federer, the world No 1.

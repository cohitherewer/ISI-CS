New Delhi: Team India wicketkeeper Mahendra Singh Dhoni on Sunday said burnout of players could be countered with an effective rotation policy, which would also help in prolonging the careers of many a cricketer. 

His teammate Harbhajan Singh, however, bowled a wrong-un, saying players who are worried about being consumed by too much cricket could opt for rest. 

I dont mind playing as much cricket as possible because I love the game. In fact, I dont think there is too much cricket in BCCIs schedule in the current season. If any player feels it, he can always request the Board to give him rest, the off-spinner said. 

Harbhajan, back in form after an indifferent tour of Pakistan, also pooh-poohed the much-talked about rotation of players. 

Instead of adopting a compulsory rotation policy, players should voluntarily ask for rest if they want so. 

Dhoni, on the other hand, believes that rotation gives each player a chance to excel. 

When a rotation policy is there, there is no issue of burnout. We get enough rest in between (matches) to recharge our batteries, Dhoni told reporters on Sunday. 

It (rotation) also gives every player a chance to excel. If the same XI are playing continuously, the players will get burned out? Rotation, thus, allows other guys in the 14-15 member squad a chance to gain experience so that when the right time comes he can also excel. 

It gives much needed rest as well, particularly to fast bowlers who really need a break given the workload on them. 

Dhoni did not think that rotation might lead to insecurity among players about their places in the side.

There should not be any insecurity. It (rotation) is for their own good, for a long career you need to preserve yourself. 

Harbhajan, who has taken 227 wickets from 55 Tests, felt India could do with a bowling coach in the build up to the World Cup. 

I dont mind (a bowling coach). If we get one, it will certainly be helpful for the team. But it is up to the team management to decide whether a bowling coach is required or not. 

The first Indian to take a Test hattrick, Harbhajan was upbeat about the upcoming tour of the West Indies where India are scheduled to play five one-dayers and four Tests. 

The series is very significant, especially in the light of the fact that West Indies would be hosting the World Cup next year. The tour would enable us to understand the wicket as well as the climatic conditions there in advance. 

Dhoni, however, agreed with Harbhajan in this regard. 

It would be an exciting tour. We will learn about the pitches, weather conditions and other things. The tour will be a learning lab for us and very crucial.

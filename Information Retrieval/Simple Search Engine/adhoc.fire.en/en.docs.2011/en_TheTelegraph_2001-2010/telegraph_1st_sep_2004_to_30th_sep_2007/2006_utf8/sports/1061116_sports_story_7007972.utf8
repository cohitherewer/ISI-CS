 Sourav to lead after six years

 - Bengals Ranji campaign 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Sourav Ganguly will lead the 14-member Bengal squad against Punjab in the Ranji Trophy Elite Group match in Mohali beginning November 23. Sourav has decided to take up the captaincy after six long years, having last led against Orissa at the Eden in December 2000. 

Incidentally, he became the Team India captain in November 2000 while his first appearance as Bengal captain was in 1993-94 against Tripura. 

Sourav, who had stepped down from the Bengal captaincy last year paving the way for Deep Dasgupta to lead the side, would remain in the saddle as long as hes available for Bengal team this season, according to CAB joint secretary Saradindu Pal. 

If Sourav is there, we have to offer him the captaincy first, Pal remarked. 

Pal scotched rumours that there was any resentment in the team following CABs decision to reappoint Sourav as captain. Sourav took a days time to decide on it. 

Mediumpacer Shib Shankar Paul, however, has been ruled out after a fitness test by Andrew Leipus at the Eden on Wednesday morning. 

Previously, it was decided that Paul will accompany the squad to Mohali, but on Souravs suggestion he will be heading to Mumbai to undergo rehab under Leipus for at least 10 days. 

The Squad 

Sourav Ganguly (captain), Deep Dasgupta (vice-captain), Arindam Das, Rohan Gavaskar, Subhamoy Das, Avishek Jhunjhunwala, Laxmi Ratan Shukla, Manoj Tiwari, Sourashish Lahiri, Shiv Sagar Singh, Ranadeb Bose, Ashok Dinda, Eklakh Ahmed, Amitava Chakraborty. Coach: Paras Mhambrey. Manager: Samir Dasgupta.

 Zidane an extra motivation for France

Hamelin: The last time France played Spain competitively, the great Zinedine Zidane was at the peak of his powers. 

It was a very good match, maybe the best Ive ever played for France, Zidane had said after a 2-1 quarter final win over Spain at Euro 2000. 

Six years on, Zidane is reaching the end of his glittering career but France still need some inspiration from him when they play Spain in the second round of the World Cup on Tuesday in Hanover. 

The ageing midfield playmaker, who will retire after the finals, knows every match now could be his last. 

We want to go a long way for the team but also for him because we know its his last major competition, midfielder Alou Diarra told reporters on Sunday. Thats an extra motivation for us. 

He was so frustrated not to play that match (versus France), Abidal said on Sunday. Hes such a competitor. He always wants to win, even when its just training. He makes it look easy sometimes but I can tell you he works extremely hard. 

France, relying on several players past their prime, have looked sluggish so far and the absence of Zidane against Togo did not stop them from winning their first World Cup match since they stunned Brazil 3-0 in the 1998 final. 

The gifted son of Algerian immigrants is such a talisman, however, that France coach Raymond Domenech has no option other than to include his captain in the starting line-up on Tuesday. 

Having such a player in your team is always an advantage, Domenech said. 

Abidal went further, saying the balding number 10 with the magic touch could again be the match winner against Spain. Spain have excellent players but they dont have Zidane, he said. 

France, automatic favourites against anyone not so long ago, feel they will be the underdogs when they face Spain and like it that way. 

Maybe its a good thing that Spain believe theyre the favourites, France midfielder Vikash Dhorasoo told reporters on Sunday. 

The two neighbours have never met on the World Cup stage and Spain will be chasing their first victory over the French in the finals of a major tournament.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Atwal lying at 101

Connecticut: Arjun Atwals wretched run continued with a two-over 72 on the first day of the Buick Championship on the PGA Tour. 

Atwal, who has missed more cuts than he has made this year, is lying at 101st and would need a good second round to make the cut. 

Meanwhile, four players were sharing the lead after Thursdays first round. The four include Australian Peter Lonard, Heath Slocum, Harrison Frazar and Scott Verplank who all shot five-under-par 65. 

 Atwal started on the first and parred the front nine with nine straight pars. Then came his first bogey on the 10th, followed by another on the 13th and there were no birdies throughout the day. He ended at two-over. 

 Slocum, who missed the cut in three of his last five events, made five birdies in a bogey-free round at the 6820-yard TPC River Highlands Course. 

 Frazar made a bogey on the 15 and six birdies in his first Tour start since withdrawing after the first round of the St Jude Classic last month. He has made just one cut in his last six tournaments. 

 Half a dozen players were one shot off the pace, including 1995 US Open champion Corey Pavin. (PTI)

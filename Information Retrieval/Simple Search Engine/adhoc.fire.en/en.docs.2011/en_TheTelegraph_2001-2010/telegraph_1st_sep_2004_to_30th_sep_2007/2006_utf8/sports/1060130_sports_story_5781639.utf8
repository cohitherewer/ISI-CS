 Bagan, Dempo in 1-1 deadlock

Margao: Keeper Abhijit Mondals splendid saves in the second half saved Dempo the blushes as they held Mohun Bagan to a one all draw in the 10th ONGC National Football League at the Nehru Stadium here on Sunday. 

Man of the Match Bolaji Mejeck gave Dempo the lead in the 61st minute which was cancelled by Mehtab Hussain through a penalty in the 64th. 

The two teams now have three points from five matches. Dempo are yet to win a match. 

Bolaji, drafted in the midfield in place of Nacemento Silveira, gave good support to Roberto Mendes Silva. 

Dempo made their intention clear from the start. They came close to scoring on few occasions but lacked the direction. 

Isfaq Ahmed, who partnered Ranty Martins up-front, was the more enterprising of the two. He had a couple of scoring chances but failed to direct his shots on target.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 BCCI refusal may put 2011 Cup in jeopardy 

 - Monday deadline to notify ICC of any problems with MPA 

A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta: International Cricket Council (ICC) president Percy Sonn on Wednesday warned that the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI)s refusal to sign the Members Participation Agreement (MPA) could put the 2011 World Cup in jeopardy. 

If the BCCI fails to agree to the terms of the MPA, it will of course mean that they could not continue as one of the joint hosts of the 2011 World Cup, thus putting the entire tournament in jeopardy, Sonn said in a statement. 

Sonn also set the BCCI a Monday deadline to notify the ICC of any difficulties with the MPA, which lays down guidelines and restrictions including those that deal with ambush marketing that the players must follow during all ICC events in 2007-2015. 

We hope agreement can be reached and that common sense will prevail, Sonn said. 

After the BCCIs annual general meeting last month, treasurer N. Srinivasan said: We have rejected the MPA in its present form and have formed a committee to go into it and suggest which are the minimum parameters we can agree upon. All our members felt that there were several clauses about which we have reservations. 

Till late on Wednesday evening, efforts to contact BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah proved futile. 

Sonn said that the new MPA addresses Indias concerns and that he was disappointed that the BCCI had raised its objections so late in the day. 

Six months ago we circulated the MPA for our events from 2007-2015 to our members for comment and over the subsequent months, we have had extensive and fruitful negotiations with many of our members that have helped us develop the contents of the agreement to suit our mutual needs. It is, thus, very disappointing that the BCCI has only recently been able to review the agreement and raise its concerns, said Sonn. 

Our other members have indicated that they are in a position to sign the MPA and the process is moving forward rapidly. This means that, unlike the other members concerns which were given due consideration over several months, the BCCI will only have a limited opportunity for its concerns to be presented and considered. 

The new MPA is significantly more flexible than the agreements that regulate participation in ICC events through to 2007. In particular, the MPA addresses all areas of concern raised by Indian players ahead of previous ICC events and provides more scope for players and boards to maintain their own interests. 

Meanwhile, the ICC welcomed BCCIs interest to host the Twenty20 World Cup in 2013.

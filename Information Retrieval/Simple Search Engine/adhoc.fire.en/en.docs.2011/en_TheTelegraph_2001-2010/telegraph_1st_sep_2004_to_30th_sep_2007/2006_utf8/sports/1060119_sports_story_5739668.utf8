The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Dravid gesture appreciated

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Faisalabad: Team India captain Rahul Dravids remark that I would like to believe the groundsman and his staff tried their best (at the Gaddafi) and Im not going to criticise anybody has been appreciated by Pakistan Cricket Board chief curator Agha Zahid and veteran groundsman Mohammed Bashir. 

At a time when so many (including Inzamam-ul Haq) have been criticising us, Dravid made a nice gesture ... Im thankful, Zahid told The Telegraph. He added: Unfortunately, most are ignorant about wickets, while some may say something to settle some score or the other ... Its unfortunate ... 

Bashir said much the same thing.

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: Overnight rain played spoilsport in the U-22 C.K. Nayudu Trophy final between Bengal and UP in Chandigarh on Tuesday. According to information received here, only 15 overs were possible on Day I. 

Play could not get underway in the first two sessions due to wet outfield. Put into bat, UP finished the day at 60 for two. 

According to a CAB official, play was held up when it was found out that water had sipped into the pitch through the cover.

 Inzy captaincy to be reviewed after WI series

Karachi: Inzamam-ul Haqs tenure as captain will come up for review after the home series against the West Indies, Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Dr Nasim Ashraf said on Saturday. Former PCB chief Shaharyar Khan, with whom Inzamam shared a special relationship, had earlier said that his tenure was till the World Cup. 

Ashraf, who took over from Shaharyar just before the Champions Trophy, said a decision on who would captain the team for the tour of South Africa and the World Cup would be taken after consulting the selectors and taking into account form and fitness of the player. 

We have named Inzamam as captain for the West Indies series according to an old agreement but after that series the captaincy would be reviewed, he said in a television interview. 

While it is good to have stability in the team and captaincy but there has to be a balance between stability and reliance, he said. 

Inzamam is serving a four-ODI ban for bringing the game into disrepute by causing first-ever forfeiture in the 129-year Test history at The Oval. 

The PCB has blamed Inzamam conduct during The Oval Test for the forfeiture and squarely blamed him for a compensation claim of 80,000 being slapped on the PCB by its England counterpart. 

On his decision to convince Younis Khan to take back the captaincy for the Champions Trophy just a day after he had relinquished it, Ashraf said he kept the teams interests in mind. 

Younis is a gifted leader and he can lift the team on the field. We were already missing Inzamam, who is a pillar of strength in our batting and I didnt want the team in disarray in the tournament. I consider Inzamam as a batsman in the same class or perhaps better than Sachin Tendulkar and Brian Lara but he has not got the same attention in the media as them, Ashraf said. 

Ashraf announced the board would submit its new constitution by November 1 to President Pervez Musharraf.

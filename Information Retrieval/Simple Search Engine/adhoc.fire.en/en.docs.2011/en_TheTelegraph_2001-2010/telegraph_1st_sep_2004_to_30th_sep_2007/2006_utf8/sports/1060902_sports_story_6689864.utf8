 Randhawa moves up to joint 7th

Johor Bahru (Malaysia): Two eagles, one each on the front and back nine, helped Jyoti Randhawa soar to tied seventh place at the $300,000 Pulai Spring Malaysian Masters golf tournament. 

Five Indians made the cut with Shiv Kapur and Digvijay Singh adding a second straight 68 each, and at eight-under, they were tied 17th. 

Gaurav Ghei brought in a six-under 66 and at seven-under was tied 27th. S. S. P. Chowrasia and Gurbaaz Mann, who had five-under 67 each on first day, added a one under 71 each and at six-under were tied 35th. 

A bogey on the closing hole proved too costly for Amandeep Johl as he missed the cut narrowly despite totalling four-under for 36 holes. He earlier had back-to-back birdies on 10th and 11th followed by back-to-back bogeys on 12th and 13th holes. 

South African Anton Haig took the lead after the second round as he fired a six-under-par 66. The 20-year-old leader, with a two-day total of 15-under-par 129, was one ahead of Thai young gun Chapchai Nirat who shot his second consecutive 65 as he trailed by a stroke. (PTI)

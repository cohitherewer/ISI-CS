The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Second crown for Russia

 - DAVIS CUP FINAL 

 Moscow: Russia won their second Davis Cup title Sunday, with Marat Safin beating Jose Acasuso of Argentina 6-3, 3-6, 6-3, 7-6 (7-5) in the fifth and deciding match. 

The Russians beat Argentina 3-2 in the best-of-five series. 

David Nalbandian had evened the score at 2-2 earlier in the day by beating Nikolay Davydenko 6-2, 6-2, 4-6, 6-4 in the first reverse singles match at the Olympic Stadium. 

Safin easily won the first set, breaking Acasuso in the second game before coasting on serve. In the second set, Acasuso saved two break points in the fifth game and then broke Safin in the next to go up 4-2 before holding to even the match. 

The Argentine saved two break points in his first service game of the third set, but Safin beat him with a forehand passing shot after the fifth deuce and took a 3-0 lead. 

After returning to the court with his right foot taped up following a time out, Acasuso broke Safin with a sharp backhand to close the gap to 4-3. Back on serve, the Argentine netted three forehands to lose the following game at love, and Safin held on to take the set. 

Both played defensively in the fourth set and traded service wins to force a tie-breaker. Trailing 4-6, Acasuso saved one match point on Safins serve, but then netted a forehand from the baseline after a short rally. 

There were some very difficult moments today. It was tough to control the match, Safin said. Everything worked out, thank God. 

Safin, a two-time Grand Slam champion, had been drawn to play Juan Ignacio Chela in the final match, but Argentina captain Alberto Mancini replaced him with Acasuso, who had not yet played in the final but was unbeaten in his four previous Davis Cup matches this year.

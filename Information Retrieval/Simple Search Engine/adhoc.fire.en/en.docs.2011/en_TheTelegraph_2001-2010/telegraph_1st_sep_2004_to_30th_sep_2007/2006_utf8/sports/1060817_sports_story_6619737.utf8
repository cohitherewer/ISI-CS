The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Sourav sought 

 an apology 

 AUGUST 15 DIGEST 

 New 

 Delhi: A sobbing Virender Sehwag, an incensed Indian 

 team and an angry captain Sourav Ganguly demanding an apology 

 from coach John Wright. This was the tension-filled scene 

 in the Indian dressing room at The Oval in 2002 after Wright 

 had held Sehwag by the collar and barked at 

 him for throwing away his wicket in a NatWest Trophy match 

 against Sri Lanka in England.

 Asked about Wrights revelation, 

 the team manager on the tour, Rajeev Shukla, said that he 

 had kept the incident under wraps all these years because 

 what happens inside dressing rooms was not supposed to be 

 divulged. However, it is Wright who spilled the beans, he 

 said. Shukla said he had told Wright that he should not 

 have treated sehwag in this manner and that the opening 

 batsman was justifiably upset.

 Cronje family satisfied 

 Durban: The family of 

 the late Hansie Cronje has expressed satisfaction over the 

 inquest hearing that blamed human error for the plane crash 

 which killed the former South African captain four years 

 ago. We believe that the crash was an accident and 

 there was no need for the inquiry. (However), as a family 

 we dont have any gripes and we are not going to take 

 anyone to court or anything like that, said Franz 

 Cronje, elder brother of the controversial cricketer.

 However, Franz said the family 

 was cut up about being dragged into court cases.

 Kanmadikar dies 

 Indore: Former secretary 

 of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) Anant 

 Wagesh Kanmadikar passed away on Tuesday following a massive 

 heart attack. He was 80 and is survived by wife, two sons 

 and a daughter. 

 Pak to pursue umpiring 

 issue

 Karachi: Pakistan have 

 said it would take up the issue of controversial umpiring 

 decisions in the series against England with the International 

 Cricket Council in its next meeting in Mumbai in September. 

 We will take up umpiring 

 issues in the next ICC meeting. We have done that in the 

 past and we would do it again, Pakistan Cricket Board 

 chairman Shaharyar Khan said from London.

 However, Shaharyar said their 

 complaints would not be directed against any particular 

 umpire because that would be a breach of the ICC Code of 

 Conduct.

 Gillespies problems 

 Melbourne: Call it a problem 

 of plenty ace pacer Jason Gillespie believes he has no 

 chance of making it to the Australian squad for the 

 first Ashes Test despite his double-century and rich wicket 

 haul against Bangladesh, the teams last international 

 assignment.

 Gillespie said he had not 

 been getting a great vibe and ranked himself down 

 in the bowlers queue at the seventh place. 

 I know my one-day career 

 is over, Gillespie said. I still feel as if 

 my Test career has something to offer but I am down in the 

 queue. Stuart Clark, Glenn McGrath and Brett Lee are ahead 

 of me.

 Manavjit Singh Sandhus gold medal finish at the recent

 the help of French film director Fred Poulet. And new France

 Sydney: Australian opening batsman Justin Langer took on world flyweight champion Vic Darchinyan in a promotional bout here on Monday and according to the boxer, made a good fist of it.

 Langer, 35, holds a black belt in the martial art Zen Du Kai and uses boxing as part of his regular fitness work in Perth. ?Inside the boxing ring it?s the same as when you?re playing Test cricket ? nowhere to hide. You?ve got to face a lot of your own fears,? Langer said. If you punch someone properly it?s like hitting the ball in the middle of the bat ? it?s a really nice feeling,? Langer said.

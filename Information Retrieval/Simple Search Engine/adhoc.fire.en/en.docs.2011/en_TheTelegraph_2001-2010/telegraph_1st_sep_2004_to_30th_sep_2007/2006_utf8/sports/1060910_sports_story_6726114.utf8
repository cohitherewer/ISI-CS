 - Tie vs Mohammedan Sproting

Calcutta: If Mike Okoro had asserted his dress rehearsal for Thursdays big match by scoring the winner against Railway FC three days ago, East Bengal coach has his answer in the new Brazilian striker Marcio Fernandes Thomas. 

According to Carlos Roberto Pereira da Silva, the 26-year-old who practised for the first time on Saturday with the team since his arrival here could be his trump card in winning the CFL Premier Division title. 

Marcio went through the motions during the afternoon practice session for about half-an-hour before being asked to rest. Im quite happy with his fitness, but hes having some problem with the weather conditions here Its quite normal, Pereira reasoned for his short training session. 

However, the Brazilian coach admitted that the striker is going to be the crucial part of his strategy, not only against Mohammedan Sporting, but during the season ahead. A glimpse of this was visible on Saturday when too many crosses from the flanks were aimed at him in the attacking third during Pereiras situation play, pitting four defenders against four attackers. 

Lack of finishing has been a problem for us. Weve Ashim (Biswas), Gouranga (Dutta) and Freddy (Mascarenhas) but they are short-statured. With the tall Marcio around, hopefully, we can overcome this problem. He could be my trump card against Mohammedan Sporting, Pereira pointed out, further adding that the striker may start later in the match. 

Meanwhile, the club officials are hoping that Marcios ITC from Brazil will land on Monday. 

I have spoken to one of my acquaintance in Rio de Janeiro in early morning today regarding Marcios ITC. With Friday being a national holiday in Brazil and over 600 players seeking international transfers, the process is taking a little longer. Hopefully, we will receive his ITC within Tuesday, Pereira said. 

According to the IFA rule, a foreigner has to register himself at least a day before playing his first match.

 Chappell defends axing Harbhajan, Pathan

 - You cant fix old heads on young shoulders... It comes from experience 

 Virender Sehwag, who took two wickets, in action on the second day of the first Test in St Johns on Saturday 

St Johns: Under-fire coach Greg Chappell has defended going into the first Test against the West Indies with a largely inexperienced bowling attack, saying the youngsters had to be given a chance at some point of time or the other to find out how they responded to challenges. 

Chappell admitted that his bowlers had failed to bowl well consistently but pleaded for some leeway, given their inexperience. 

We didnt bowl consistently well today. But one guy was playing his first game and couple of others were playing early. You cant fix old heads on young shoulders. It comes from experience. Thats the only way to find out and we learnt a few things today, Chappell said after the second days play. 

I cant think of many bowlers who I have played with or against or have seen come to Tests as finished articles. It takes a little bit of time, he said. 

On the exclusion of Harbhajan Singh and Irfan Pathan from the playing eleven, he said, we couldnt afford to play Harbhajan. We thought we needed three pace bowlers. There wasnt space for the second spinner and we thought Sehwag could do the job if required. He indeed bowled well. 

As for Pathan, he understands why he is not playing. Probably the break would do him good. It wouldnt have been good for him to come out and bowl badly. It would have been a dent to his confidence. 

Its important he regroups and comes back and I am sure he would. I am confident that he would play in the series at some stage or the other but we thought the other options were the better ones, the coach explained. 

As for the batsmen, Chappell said the conditions were tough for batting first on a bowler-friendly wicket. 

In hindsight, that might not have been the ideal thing to do (to win the toss and bat first). Conditions were not easy for batting. 

I dont think too many our batsmen threw their wickets away. Under the circumstances, our guys didnt bat badly. But may be 300 should have been a more likely score. 

Chappell felt that the wicket would still be a difficult one to bat against the new ball. 

With the new ball, its going to be awkward. If you get the ball in right areas it would still do a bit and thus the new ball is important. 

 But West Indian opener Chris Gayle 

 expected the wicket to ease out as the game progressed.

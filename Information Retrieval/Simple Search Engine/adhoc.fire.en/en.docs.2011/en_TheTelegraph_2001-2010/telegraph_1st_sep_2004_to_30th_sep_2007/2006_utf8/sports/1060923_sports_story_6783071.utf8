 Kartik shines with bat; Sussex top

 County championship

 London: Indian left-arm 

 spinner Murali Kartik shone with the bat for Lancashire 

 as his timely knock of 40 helped his side to a big first 

 innings total against Hampshire in the English County Championship 

 Division I tie.

 Kartik, who came in at No. 10 

 at The Rose Bowl in Southampton, faced 55 balls and hit 

 five boundaries. He was involved in a 88-run stand for the 

 ninth wicket with Tom Smith (49) and was the last man to 

 be dismissed.

 The Indian spinner was less successful 

 while bowling as he had only one wicket to show for his 

 efforts after conceding 73 runs in 23.3 overs. 

 Meanwhile, in Nottingham, Mushtaq 

 Ahmed took nine wickets and Sussex beat Nottinghamshire 

 by an innings and 245 runs on Friday to win the County Championship 

 for the second time in four years.

 The Pakistani leg-spinner had 

 a career-best nine for 48 to claim 13 wickets for the match 

 and reach 100 dismissals for the season. Nottinghamshire 

 were bowled out for 165 and 150 after Sussex declared at 

 560 for five.

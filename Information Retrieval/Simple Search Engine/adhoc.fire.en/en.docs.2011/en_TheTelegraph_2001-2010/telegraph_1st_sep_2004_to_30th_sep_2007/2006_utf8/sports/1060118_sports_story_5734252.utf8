Melbourne: Martina Hingis marked her return to Grand Slam action with a thumping victory and Swiss compatriot Roger Federer was almost as impressive at the Australian Open on Tuesday. 

Indias Sania Mirza cruised into the second round with a comfortable victory over Victoria Azarenka of Belarus. 

Seeded 32, Sania overcame initial hiccups to register a 7-6 (8-6), 6-2 win over the 16-year-old qualifier. She needed 81 minutes to brush off the world junior champions challenge. 

The 19-year-old Indian will now take on unseeded world No. 43 Michaella Krajicek of the Netherlands. Michaella beat Puerto Ricos Kristina Brandi 6-4, 7-6 (7-1) in another first round match. 

Hingis beat Russias 30th seed Vera Zvonareva 6-1, 6-2 in the first round. The former world No. 1 showed no sign of nerves in her first Grand Slam match since 2002, wrapping up a one-sided victory that left her opponent in tears. 

It was beautiful to walk in there. There were so many memories coming back. This stadium has been so great to me, the 25-year-old Hingis said. She won the Australian Open in 1997, 1998 and 1999. 

This was the best match Ive played since I came back. I wouldnt say that it was easy, I just played really well. 

Federer, a strong favourite for the mens title, also made the perfect start to his campaign when he won in brilliant fashion and his main rivals all struggled. 

The world No.1 hardly broke sweat as he brushed aside little-known Denis Istomin of Uzbekistan 6-2, 6-3, 6-2 while Australian Lleyton Hewitt, Argentine Guillermo Coria and Russian Nikolay Davydenko were all pushed to five sets. 

Last years losing finalist Hewitt needed all his fighting spirit to scrape past Czech Robin Vik 6-4, 2-6, 5-7, 7-6, 6-3 while sixth seed Coria overcame the distraction of a leg injury to wear down Romanian Victor Hanescu 6-4, 1-6, 4-6, 6-2, 6-1. 

Fifth seed Davydenko also needed the maximum number of sets to blunt the massive serve of Croat Ivo Karlovic, eventually grinding out a 7-5, 4-6, 3-6, 7-5, 6-3 victory. 

The leading women had few problems following Venus Williams shock defeat on the Monday, although third seed Amelie Mauresmo had to come from a set down to beat Chinas Sun Tiantian 4-6, 6-2, 6-2. 

 Fifth seed Mary Pierce brushed past Australian Nicole Pratt 6-1, 6-1 and Belgian Kim Clijsters crushed Koreas Cho Yoon-Jeong 6-3, 6-0 despite needing painkillers just to get on court after injuring her hip in Sydney last week. 

It got worse towards the end but I got through, so thats the most important thing, second seed Clijsters said. 

Six seeds lost on Tuesday, taking the total of first round casualties to 14. Three of the seeds were French: Richard Gasquet, Gael Monfils and Nathalie Dechy. 

Chilean ninth seed Fernando Gonzalez lost in five sets while Italian Filippo Volandri retired after losing the first two sets against Nathan Healey, prompting the Australian wildcard to cheekily question his commitment. 

Hewitts win sets up an intriguing encounter with the equally feisty Juan Ignacio Chela, one of the strong Argentine mens contingent. 

Chela, who cruised to a straight sets win over Briton Andy Murray, was fined after spitting in Hewitts direction during a fiery third round match in Melbourne last year and there are no signs the pair are ready to kiss and make up.

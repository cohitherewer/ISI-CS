The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Rai struggles off the track

 - Race for Asian Games berth 

A STAFF REPORTER

 Sanjay Rai 

Calcutta: This is a story of what could have been. 

Sanjay Rai of Bengal, Sydney Olympian, Asian Championship (Jakarta) silver-medallist and the only man in the history of Indian athletics to clear a distance of eight metres in long jump not less than four times, is now struggling to find a place in the Doha Asian Games squad. 

Leave alone the Jamshedpur Open qualification meet in October, Sanjays chances of participating in the Inter-state meet from November 12 in Chennai is in doubt since he is suffering from the recurrence of an old spinal chord injury. 

The story could have been different, however, if one of the most talented athletes in Bengal have had the chance of going abroad for a thorough treatment. 

Much as we want our athletes to perform and bring medals from international forums, when they are injured, no one really bothers about them, lamented coach Kuntal Roy, who has been training Sanjay since 1995. 

Roy, who is also the coach of celebrated athletes Soma Biswas and Sushmita Singha Roy, believes Sanjay has the ability to clear 8.4metres, which can fetch him an Olympic medal. But the athlete, who was first hurt in a meet in Patiala in 2000 and never recovered fully after that, suffered a recurrence of that injury during last years Federation Cup in Delhi. He still finished second, though. 

Though lacking in fitness, Sanjay is not lacking in spirit. 

The doctor has told me that with proper exercises I can expect to be fit by next month, so fingers crossed, should be able to take part in the Chennai meet. I am still gunning for a place in the Asian Games squad, he said on Wednesday during a training session under the watchful eyes of Roy at the SAI, Eastern Centre, in Calcutta. 

With his physique and talent, Sanjay could easily have been the next big thing in Bengal. But ill fortune and lack of a financier to sponsor his medical expenses has meant that the 27-year-old is fast becoming a has been. It is unfortunate, Roy said.

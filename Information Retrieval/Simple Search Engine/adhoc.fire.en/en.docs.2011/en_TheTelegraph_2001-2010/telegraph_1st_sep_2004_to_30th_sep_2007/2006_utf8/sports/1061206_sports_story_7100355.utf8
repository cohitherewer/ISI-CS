The 11-round Swiss tournament will conclude on December 12. 

Bengal has a total contingent of 16 players 11 boys and five girls. Of the Bengal players, last years Asian under-8 bronze medallist Sayantan Das is directly seeded and is one of the strong contenders for the top spot. 

Other Bengal players in the fray are Diptayan Ghosh, Arpan Das, Sayan Majumder, Aditya Chakraborty, Shreyas Sen Sharma, Debarshi Pal, Sumit Kumar Ankit Basakand Anusil Das. 

In the girls section, Soumi Mukherjee, who finished 8th in the world under-8 meet in Georgia in October is one of the favourites to win the title. 

Others Bengal girls in the fray are Ritika Neogi, Bidita Shenoy, Tamishra Das and Nishi Aiyer. 

To nip any cases of over-aged players cropping up in the bud, the present AICF has decided to have medical tests for all players against whom complaints have been lodged. 

Abhijit Kunte, who played simultaneous chess against 30 players on Tuesday, welcomed the move. With the number of such cases rising, the AICF should go for random tests to get rid of the problem.

 Saina Nehwal at career-best 41

New Delhi: Saina Nehwal achieved her career-best ranking of 41 following her commendable show in the Korea Open and Hong Kong Open. 

The 15-year-old from Hyderabad climbed 10 places in the latest International Badminton Federation rankings. 

Saina reached the pre-quarter finals of the Korea Open where she lost to Soratja Chansrisukot of Thailand, but avenged her defeat in the first round of Hong Kong Open. 

Saina dished out a gritty performance before losing to world No.1 Zhang Ning of China in the next round. Ning holds the No.1 spot followed by Xu Huwaein of Germany. 

After her Philippines Open triumph, Saina climbed a staggering 34 places to be placed at 55, before she attained her previous best ranking of 42 on June 22. Trupti Murgunde is the next Indian at 80. 

Among men, Chetan Anands unimpressive show at the Hong Kong Open saw him drop five spots to 27. (PTI)

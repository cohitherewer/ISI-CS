 is a matter of grave concern

 The twirling swizzle stick of reality is depleting the champagne bubbles of Sanias summer of 2005. Her meteoric rise in the world rankings inebriated the whole nation. Now, in the deep waters of the top 30 in the world, Sania is struggling to keep afloat. 

The exacting demands of sky-high fitness levels and intensive competitive play have taken a heavy toll. It is now a catch 22 position for Sania. 

She needs to get physically stronger but is unable to train hard owing to injuries. She needs to play more matches, but cannot do so because of injuries. Her recent loss in the third round of the DFS Classic at Birmingham to a qualifier from the US is symptomatic of not enough match play. 

She was leading by a set and three games to one and then 5-3 in the final set but failed to close out the match. With the withdrawal of Huntuchova (seeded No.3) in her half of the draw, Sania could well have reached the finals. 

According to reports, Sania was very upset and refused to talk to the press. One can understand her reluctance, but what is of serious concern is the inevitable drop in her confidence, specially against lower-ranked opponents. 

With Wimbledon hardly a week away, one really wonders what she can do. As I wrote earlier there is something special about Sania. Maybe she can dig deep and come up with a spectacular victory against one of the top notchers, who knows. 

I visited Wimbledon last Monday and met the chairman of the All England Club, Tim Phillips. 

Tall, distinguished and charming, Phillips has a rare elegance. He is of an almost extinct species: an allround sportsman/gentleman with a triple blue in tennis, squash and hockey from Oxford. 

The grounds were a beehive of activity as the huge underground storehouses were being stocked for the fortnight of the Championships. 

Close to half a million spectators will consume nearly 30 tons of strawberries, wash it down with 150,000 glasses of Pimms, 17,000 bottles of champagne and 100,000 pints of beer. 

Smoked and poached salmon 12,000 kilos, 150,000 bath buns, scones, pastries and 700 litres of cream are some of the other items consumed during the fortnight. More than 560 million homes will watch 620 competitors from 65 countries. 1,250 dozen yellow balls will be used for 700 matches! 

This is the anatomy of the Championships. 

Constantly blending tradition with innovation there are improvements and additions every year. 

Now the Centre Court, described by the Wimbledon authorities as one of the worlds most evocative sporting arenas, is to be transformed. 

By year 2009 the Centre Court will have a translucent retractable roof with an increased capacity (15,000), wider and more comfortable seats and lifts. 

The ivy covered Centre Court and the rich emerald green grass courts, adorned by Petunias, Hydrangeas and a dazzling blaze of white roses are stunning. 

The idea is to create an atmosphere of tennis in an English garden said Tim Phillips. 

Then there is the wonderful new Museum. A time machine, which transports you gently back into the earliest years through odd shaped wooden rackets and flamboyant striped blazers. 

Videos at the press of a button take you back in time as the legendary greats spring to life and relive some of their great moments. After nearly six decades of close association as a player, broadcaster and reporter, I was overcome with emotion. 

I have seen the magic of the atmosphere of tennis in an English garden work. It overawed and transformed some of the brash, irreverent aggressive swearing American greats and moulded them into being better human beings. 

Wimbledon has discreetly tucked the garish commercial assault of the multinationals, underground and tenaciously hung on to the traditional values and saved the soul of tennis.

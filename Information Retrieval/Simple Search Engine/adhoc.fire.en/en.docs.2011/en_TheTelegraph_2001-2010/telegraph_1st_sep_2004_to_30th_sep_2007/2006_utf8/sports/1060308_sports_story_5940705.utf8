The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Real stars at war, says Spanish media 

 Rumours are rife that Ronaldo was involved 

Barcelona: Real Madrid?s stars are at ?war? with each other as they head for a third straight season without a trophy, with Brazilian forward Ronaldo and Spanish midfielder Guti having come to blows, Barcelona-based sports media reported on Tuesday. 

 ?Civil war in Madrid,? said a daily in a frontpage headline, adding that the reason Guti pulled out of last week?s friendly international with Ivory Coast with a leg injury was down to Ronaldo having kicked out at him following the 1-0 Champions League home leg loss to Arsenal two weeks ago. 

The daily quoted a radio journalist as saying the pair, usually close friends, had had an angry exchange which turned into fisticuffs following the Arsenal match which left the club on the brink of elimination ahead of Wednesday?s return at Highbury. 

Meanwhile, Real Madrid?s new president Fernando Martin says the future of Brazil striker Ronaldo at the club is of minor importance compared to Wednesday?s Champions League clash against Arsenal. 

?I?m not bothered whether or not Ronaldo plays, all I want to do is to win,? Martin said on Tuesday. 

?You have to give people your confidence and understanding, but when they don?t do what they are supposed to then you have to leave them out. If you don?t solve problems then things turn rotten.? 

Ronaldo was recalled to the squad for the Arsenal game after being dropped for last weekend?s league match against city rivals Atletico Madrid. 

The 29-year-old has been in disappointing form for Real this season and hinted that he may leave at the end of the present campaign because he is unhappy with the criticism he has received from the club?s fans. 

Martin, who took charge at Real after the shock resignation of Florentino Perez last week, said he was convinced the team could turn the tables on Arsenal after a 1-0 defeat in the first leg at the Bernabeu. 

?The team are going to go all out against Arsenal. The fans should have no doubt that we will do everything that is humanly possible to win. And if we do win we will turn the whole season round.? 

The 58-year-old businessman has distanced himself from Perez?s policy of giving priority to the club?s economic interests and said that the nine-times European champions needed to concentrate on achieving success on the pitch. 

?We have to reflect deeply on the state of the club,? he said. ?We have to balance a lot of interests, but sporting matters need to take precedence over its finances. 

He took a thinly veiled swipe at his predecessor?s policy of signing high-profile ?Galacticos? who were recruited as much for their marketing value as for their sporting prowess. 

?No player should be guaranteed a place in the team. Players won?t be coming to this club to retire in the future.? (Agencies)

 Trescothick to miss out

 - Champions Trophy

 - Styris doubtful 

London: Marcus Trescothick, considered Englands top one-day batsman, will miss next months ICC Champions Trophy because of illness. 

Englands selectors said on Wednesday the Somerset left-hander will not be included in the 14-man squad for the tournament in India. 

Trescothick will remain in England for treatment of a stress-related illness but should be fit to play in the Ashes series against Australia starting in November, the England and Wales Cricket Board said. 

Trescothick left the tour to India in March due to what was described as a virus. 

Performance Healthcare, the specialists treating Trescothick, said he was suffering from a gastrointestinal infection as well as underlying stress-related illness. 

He has been receiving specialist treatment, which has allowed him to resume his position in the England team, Performance Healthcare said in a statement. However, we believe that it would be premature for him to tour India in October. 

I was keen to take part in the Champions Trophy, but I do appreciate that my specialists advice is that I must first continue the treatment devised for me, Trescothick said. Having come to terms with the full extent of my illness last winter, I recognise that I am now well on course to make a full recovery and I am determined to play a full part in the Ashes tour. 

England coach Duncan Fletcher warned his players against picking and choosing their tours after Trescothicks withdrawal. 

Fletcher said: Ive said all along weve just got to come up with a method of making sure players dont pick (and chose) these tours. I would want my players available for all tours that are played. 

Fletcher told reporters that England were a good one-day side when at full strength. When we had our full side, close to our Test side, we got to the Champions Trophy final (against the West Indies at The Oval in 2004) and we competed very well with Australia. Since then we havent had that side. Continuity is important but you cant have continuity if people keep coming in the side because of injuries. 

Meanwhile, New Zealand allrounder Scott Styris is doubtful for the Champions Trophy after injuring his back while playing for Middlesex. New Zealand Crickets general manager Lindsay Crocker said selectors were not sure about the seriousness of the injury which was suffered when Styris took the field against Yorkshire. We dont quite know how bad it is but we should do by Thursday, Crocker said. 

Its a back problem. Something is playing up which hes not happy about, which is unfortunate, Crocker was quoted as saying in a newspaper.

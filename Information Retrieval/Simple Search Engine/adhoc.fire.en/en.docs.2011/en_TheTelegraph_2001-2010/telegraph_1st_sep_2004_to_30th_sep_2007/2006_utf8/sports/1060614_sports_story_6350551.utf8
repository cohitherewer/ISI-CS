 Tiff wont affect tie vs Ivory Coast

 - Important for us to stay together: Van Basten 

 Freiburg: Netherlands coach Marco van Basten took pains on Tuesday to play down a dispute between two of his key players and insisted Arjen Robben and Robin van Persie would be a dangerous duo in the next game against Ivory Coast. 

After Sundays 1-0 win over Serbia-Montenegro, in-form Van Persie was miffed about seeing little of the ball and complained all action was targeted at match-winner Robben, with too little coming back from the Chelsea winger, who earned the Man-of-the-Match award. Arjen Robben was right and Robin Van Persie was right. But what is important is that we stay together and work together and get better, Van Basten said Tuesday. 

Blessed with the ability to play an attractive style of soccer, the Dutch are also burdened with a knack of fighting among themselves at major tournaments and Van Basten sought to contain the issue. 

The Netherlands three strikers, Robben, Van Persie of Arsenal and Ruud van Nistelrooy of Manchester United all play for English Premier League sides that are frequently at each others throats in English domestic games. 

We discussed a little bit with the two players and also we said something about a situation like that in general to the whole team, Van Basten said. He said the imbalance in feeding to the wings on Sunday was just coincidence. 

Arjen did very good work with the ball and maybe the players felt that during the game. And the players gave him more and Arjen was also feeling free and wanted the ball. It is just the case. The next game it is going to be the case for Van Persie, he said. 

Van Persie won his spot on the starting line-up during an inspirational preparation campaign and was subdued on Sunday, although it was his inch-perfect pass that split the Serbian defence for Robben to score. 

Van Nistelrooy had an off-day and was replaced early. He knows it can happen and it was just coincidence he was not that dangerous, said Van Basten. He added light injuries to goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar and midfielder Mark van Bommel were progressing well and predicted a similar line-up for the game against Ivory Coast. 

If you are not forced to change, then there are no reasons to change, Van Basten said. Victory over Ivory Coast could already see the Netherlands through into the second round. 

Ever since the 1970s, the Dutch have been burdened with scandal, including the 1990 and 1994 World Cup campaigns and 1996 and 2004 European Championships, which were hurt by infighting. 

Dutch media quoted Van Persie as saying: Hopefully we still have to play six games here. (Robben) cannot do it on his own. 

Former Dutch hero Johan Cruyff, no stranger to controversies, didnt mind the fuss. A bit of criticism toward Robben doesnt keep me awake at night. Honestly, I dont see it as criticism. It is more of a remark of someone seeking to get the maximum out of something, Cruyff wrote on his Web site. And Van Persie is right. Even though Robben played great, he should have given some more attention to his fellow players. 

Van Basten said he refused to impose some sort of gag order. They can do and say whatever they like. Just, I hope, they will be wise in saying things. They are big enough and experienced enough. (AP)

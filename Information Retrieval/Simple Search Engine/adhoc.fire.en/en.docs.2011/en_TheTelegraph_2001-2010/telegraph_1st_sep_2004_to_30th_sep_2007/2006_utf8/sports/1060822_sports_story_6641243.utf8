The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Captain charged on two counts

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq was on Monday slapped with dual charges of changing the condition of the ball and bringing the game into disrepute by the International Cricket Council (ICC) after his team forfeited the fourth Test against England at The Oval. 

According to a release, both charges will be considered during a hearing to be conducted by ICC Chief Match Referee Ranjan Madugalle on Friday. 

There are two charges brought forward by the umpires, one for changing the condition of the ball and the other for bringing the game into disrepute, ICC spokesman Jon Long said. 

Inzamam has been charged, as captain, with a breach of Level 2.10 of the ICC Code which relates to changing the condition of the ball in breach of Law 42.3 of the Laws of Cricket. 

He was accused of breaching Level 2.10 by on-field umpires Billy Doctrove and Darrell Hair on Sunday. If found guilty, Inzamam will face a fine of between 50 and 100 per cent of his match fee and/or a one Test or two ODI ban. 

Moreover, Inzamam has been charged, as captain, with a breach of C2 at Level 3 of the Code which relates to conduct that brings the player or the game of cricket into disrepute. 

On-field umpires Doctrove and Hair combined with the third and fourth umpires Peter Hartley and Trevor Jesty to press this charge following a meeting on Monday morning. 

If Inzamam is found guilty of breaching this provision he faces a ban of between two and four Test matches or four to eight ODI matches. 

The ICC has provisionally appointed Madugalle to conduct the hearing. Match Referee Mike Procter is likely to be asked to present evidence to the hearing.

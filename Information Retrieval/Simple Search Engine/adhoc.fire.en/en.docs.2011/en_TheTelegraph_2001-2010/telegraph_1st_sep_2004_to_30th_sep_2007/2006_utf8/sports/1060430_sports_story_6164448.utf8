The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 West Indies vote, it seems, will clinch it for Asia

 - 2011 World Cup 

 - Australia-NZ cant get the support of 7 full members 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Calcutta: With South Africa 

 and Zimbabwe indicating hundred per cent support 

 for Asia, the West Indies stand will determine whether 

 the 2011 World Cup is going to be held in a region which 

 has already hosted crickets biggest event twice. 

That, indeed, was the equation late on Saturday ? some hours before the International Cricket Council (ICC) Executive Boards meeting in Dubai. 

If the agenda is adhered to, Sunday is also when the 2015 host will be identified. 

 The West Indies Cricket 

 Board (WICB) is being strongly wooed by Asia and, I reckon, 

 by Australia-New Zealand as well? It has emerged a key player, 

 a well-placed source told The Telegraph. 

Apparently, Asia has promised that the biggest crowd-pullers (India and Pakistan) are going to help generate revenue for the cash-strapped WICB, which is hosting the 2007 edition. 

That, one learns, could be through fund-raising ODIs in the USA and Canada. 

Speaking from Dubai, the source added: There was a time, not too long ago, when Asia couldnt have taken South Africa and Zimbabwes backing for granted. That, however, has changed? 

Confirmation came from former Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) president Inderjit Singh Bindra, who is spearheading Asias effort: We do have the support of six Full Members? Its a question of getting the seventh? 

He continued: Realistically, weve got a good chance? But, then, nothing is done till it actually is? Im missing Jaggu (Jagmohan Dalmiya)? Both of us, after all, had worked together to get the 1996 World Cup to Asia? 

Bindra and Dalmiya drifted apart a year later and many believe the former has been playing the biggest behind-the-scenes role in turning the heat on Dalmiya in recent months. 

Yet, as Bindra (who will again represent the BCCI) put it, there are occasions when one gets sentimental... Today is one such. 

Constitutionally, for either Asia or Australia-New Zealand to be successful, the backing of seven Full (Test-playing) Members is mandatory. That ensures a majority in the 13-member Executive Board, too. 

By rotation, the Associate and Affiliate Members have three nominees. 

With Asias Big Four ? India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh ? pitching jointly, three more votes are going to be enough. 

Its confirmed (to the extent possible) that South Africa and Zimbabwe will extend support and, so, the only floating vote is the West Indies. 

England, as of now, are committed to backing Australia-New Zealand, the hosts in 1992. 

Clearly, in a straightforward numbers game (of Full Members), Australia-New Zealand cant make it. The arithmetic is simple. 

While the three Associates ? Israel, Malaysia, United Arab Emirates ? may not count for too much in normal circumstances, theyre going to be important if theres a constitutional stalemate. 

According to another well-placed source, ICC president Ehsan Mani can then suggest that the Executive Board respect the sentiments reflected by the overall votes ? including the three Associates. 

Theres talk that the numbers factor could see Australia-New Zealand withdraw on condition that the 2015 World Cup is theirs. 

Thats to be seen. 

Moreover, England will then have to back out from 2015 and, surely, the England amp; Wales Cricket Board wont do so unless the 2019 edition is given to them in black-and-white. 

 A move is underway.

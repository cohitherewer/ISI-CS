 ICC meeting now in Karachi

Mumbai: The International Cricket Council (ICC) meeting scheduled for Dubai on Wednesday has been switched to Karachi on the following day, BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah said on Friday. 

Shah said the meeting had been rescheduled because some delegates were having difficulty obtaining visas following the death of Dubai ruler Sheikh Maktoum Al Maktoum. 

Meanwhile, representatives of the BCCI will meet their England counterparts in London on Monday to finalise the itinerary, secretary Niranjan Shah said on Friday. 

Shah said India would be represented by former Board president I.S. Bindra and vice-president Lalit Modi, both of whom are members of the Boards marketing committee.

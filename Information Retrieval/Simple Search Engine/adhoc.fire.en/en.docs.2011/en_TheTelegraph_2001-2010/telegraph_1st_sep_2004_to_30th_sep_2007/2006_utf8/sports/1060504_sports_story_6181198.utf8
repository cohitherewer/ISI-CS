 Tiger Woods father no more

Los Angeles: Earl Woods, who guided his son Tiger towards golf dominance at a young age and mentored him through his early career, passed away at the age of 74, Tiger said on Wednesday on his website. 

Im very saddened to share the news of my fathers passing away at home early this morning. My dad was my best friend and greatest role model, and I will miss him deeply, Tiger wrote.

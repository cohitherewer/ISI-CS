The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 United lose 1-3 to City

London: Arsenal thrashed Middlesbrough 7-0 to gain ground in the race for Champions League places on Saturday while fourth-placed Tottenham Hotspur were beaten 0-1 at Liverpool and Manchester United lost 1-3 at Manchester City. 

At Highbury, Thierry Henry scored a hattrick and there were also goals for Philippe Senderos, Robert Pires, Gilberto Silva and Alexander Hleb while Liverpools victory came courtesy of Harry Kewells first goal for more than a year. 

Arsenal remain fifth, on 37 points from 21 games. Spurs are fourth on 40 from 22, Liverpool have 44 from 20 with United on 45 from 22. 

Chelsea, 13 points clear at the top on 58, visit bottom club Sunderland on Sunday. 

Elsewhere on Saturday, Everton won 1-0 at Portsmouth, West Ham United triumphed 2-1 at Aston Villa, Charlton Athletic beat Birmingham City 2-0 and Fulham defeated Newcastle United 1-0. 

The day began with an upset in the 145th Manchester derby as United completed a painful week. 

Goals by Trevor Sinclair and Darius Vassell in an eight-minute spell late in the first half put City in control. 

United briefly made it 2-1 with a 76th-minute Ruud van Nistelrooy goal but, down to 10 men after a 66th-minute red card for Cristiano Ronaldo, they were generally toothless in attack. 

City ended the day in style with a sweet strike by substitute Robbie Fowler. 

Uniteds third league defeat of the season followed their goalless FA Cup draw with minor league Burton Albion last Sunday and a 1-1 draw at Blackburn Rovers in the first leg of their League Cup semi-final in midweek.

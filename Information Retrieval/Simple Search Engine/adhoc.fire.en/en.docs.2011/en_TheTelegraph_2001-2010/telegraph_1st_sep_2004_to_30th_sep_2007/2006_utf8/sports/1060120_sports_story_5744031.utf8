 Mumbai to bank on Powar

Mumbai: Former champions Mumbai are all geared up to take on formidable Uttar Pradesh when the two teams clash in the Ranji Trophy semi-finals at the Wankhede Stadium here on Friday. 

Mumbai, who enjoyed a six-match winning streak until their 65-run loss to arch-rivals Maharashtra at the same venue in the concluding Elite Division group A league tie, will also be hoping to put behind that setback. 

The hosts, of course, would be missing Wasim Jaffer, away to Pakistan on national duty. But they have a nice blend of experience and youth. 

There will be huge expectations from allrounder Ramesh Powar following a rewarding season that has effectively made him a key man in the squad. 

Forced to drop opener Sushant Marathe and middle-order batsman Abhijit Shetye, 36-time champions Mumbai would be relying on Amol Muzumdar, Vinit Indulkar and Nishit Shetty to come up with significant innings, while they turn to captain Nilesh Kulkarni, Avishkar Salvi and Powar to impress with the ball.

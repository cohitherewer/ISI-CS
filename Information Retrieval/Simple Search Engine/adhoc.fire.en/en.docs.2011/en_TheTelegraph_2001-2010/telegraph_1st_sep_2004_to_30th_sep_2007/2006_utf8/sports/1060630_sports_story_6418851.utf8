 Zidane misses training

Hamelin: France captain and playmaker Zinedine Zidane missed training on Thursday but should be fit to play Brazil in their World Cup quarter final on Saturday, a team spokesman said. 

The 34-year-old Zidane took a knock in Tuesdays 3-1 second round win over Spain and stayed at the teams hotel to receive treatment on a minor injury. 

Its a precautionary measure, the spokesman said of Zidanes absence. 

France have one more training session planned on Friday in Hanover before facing Brazil in Frankfurt, a rematch of the 1998 final won 3-0 by the French and featuring two Zidane goals. 

Right back Willy Sagnol, who complained about a sore groin after the Spain match, attended the session but only jogged around the pitch. The spokesman said he should be fit to play Brazil. 

Meanwhile Switzerland and Arsenal centre back Philippe Senderos said on Thursday he had undergone surgery on an injured shoulder. The operation went well, he said, adding he was unsure how long he would be out of action.

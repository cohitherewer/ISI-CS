 Solanki, Kabir Ali to play for Rajasthan

Mumbai: Englands Vikram Solanki and Kabir Ali will turn out for Rajasthan in Indian domestic competitions this season. 

Vikram is Udaipur-born, so it was only natural that we invited him to play for us, Rajasthan Cricket Association (RCA) secretary Subhash Joshi said. 

Rajasthan will be competing in the Elite group of the Ranji Trophy which begins on Thursday. Batsman Solanki, who plays for Worcestershire in the English County championship, has represented England in 51 one-day Internationals but is yet to make his Test debut. 

Medium pacer Kabir, who is Solankis County teammate, has played one Test and 14 ODIs. 

 This wont be the first time that foreign players will play for Indian states. The BCCI had invited West Indian fast bowlers Roy Gilchrist, Chester Watson, Charlie Stayers and Lester King to play in the 1960s to help Indian batsmen adapt to pace. 

On the coaching front, Australian Darren Holder is in charge of the Maharashtra team, while former Pakistan captain Intikhab Alam has guided Punjab. 

Solanki, however, clarified he is not keen on donning India colours and wants to make a comeback to the English side. Having been left out of the Ashes tour party, Solanki decided to come to India and play for the Ajay Jadeja-led Rajasthan. 

Playing for Rajasthan does not mean I would try to play for India. Though I was born in Udaipur, I learnt my cricket in England. I consider England as my cricketing home and would play for them whenever I am needed, Solanki said. 

Kabir also said he was hoping for an England comeback. I feel our performance here will certainly matter. The England selectors will probably keep an eye on our performance. (Reuters)

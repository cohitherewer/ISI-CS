 Coach Michel resigns

Munich: Henri Michel is going out a winner ? even if Ivory Coast failed to qualify for the second round. Michel quit as coach on Wednesday, announcing his decision following the Elephants 3-2 victory over Serbia-Montenegro. 

I had a goal, which I reached: qualification for this World Cup and the last African Nations Cup, Michel said. 

Ivory Coast fought back from two goals down to beat Serbia and Montenegro to secure their first World Cup win on Wednesday (as reported in Thursdays CM edition). 

Serbia took the lead in the 10th minute when striker Nikola Zigic slotted home. In the 19th minute when Sasa Ilic pounced on a fumbled clearance by Ivory Coast stand-in captain Cyrille Domoraud from a Predag Djordjevic cross. 

However, their pressure eventually paid off when Dindane tucked away a twice-taken penalty in the 36th minute following a handball by Dudic. Ivory Coast dominated the second half. Blaise Kouassi struck the bar, Dindane came close with a header and finally headed in a Kader Keita cross in the 67th minute. 

When Dudic again handled in the area, Kalou stepped up to score and seal a historic win for Ivory Coast.

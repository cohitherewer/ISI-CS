 Sania shouldnt stop dreaming

 - She has to be more patient, says Brett

New Delhi: International tennis guru Bob Brett, who once moulded the careers of Boris Becker, Goran Ivanisevic, Mario Ancic and Nicolas Kiefer, feels patience is the key word for survival in the ruthless world of professional tennis. And the one Indian sportsperson who needs it most at this juncture is Sania Mirza. 

The legendary Australian coach, who is in the capital in connection with a three-day workshop being organised by Head and Delux Sports International, described Sania as a technically improved player, but added she should have more patience while going for winners. 

Brett helped Sania make the crucial jump from a promising junior to a performing pro. Brett, currently the Japan Davis Cup coach, still advises Sania from time to time. 

Asked to assess Sanias recent performances, Brett said: At the moment, I find her technically a much better player. She has the ability to match higher-ranked players on the circuit. But she should be more patient. She should go for winners only after weighing the pros and cons. 

Unlike others, Brett is not much bothered about Sanias recent dip in form. She should not stop dreaming, thats my advice to her, the celebrated coach said. She must remember improvement is a never-ending process. 

In her first year, Brett said Sania was like a child in a toy shop. Everything was new and fun. Its an experience. The second year on the circuit is historically the most difficult for any player. This is the time when the opponent starts identifying ones weakness. 

The Australian is confident that the Hyderabad girl would climb in the rankings next year. Her backhand and service has improved. But its her forehand that is still weak. She was perhaps preoccupied with her other weaknesses. 

Without naming Sania, Brett said one should not change coaches too frequently.

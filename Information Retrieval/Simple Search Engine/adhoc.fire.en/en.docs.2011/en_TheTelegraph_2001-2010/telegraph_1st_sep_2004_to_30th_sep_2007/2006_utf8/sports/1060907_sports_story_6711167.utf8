 Report says Schumi is quitting

 Frankfurt: Seven-time Formula One champion Michael 

 Schumacher will announce his retirement Sunday at the Italian 

 Grand Prix in Monza, a German newspaper reported on Wednesday. 

We cant comment on everything. As we said, there will be more on Sunday, Schumachers spokeswoman Sabine Kehm said. The mass-circulation paper gave no source for its report. 

Schumachers manager, Willi Weber, was quoted as telling the paper, We wont have anything to say before Sunday. 

The German driver, who holds every major record in Formula One racing, has said before that he would announce a decision on his future at the Monza race. 

Speculation has been growing in the German media in recent weeks that Schumacher would retire when his contract with Ferrari expires at the end of the season, which still has four Grands Prix, including the Italian race. 

Schumacher trails defending Formula One champion Fernando Alonso by 12 points. 

Even if he wins at Monza and slashes Alonsos lead to single figures, all could be overshadowed by what happens afterwards. 

If Schumacher does announce his retirement, Monza will be his European farewell to the Ferrari faithful at the temple of Italian motor racing. 

Ferrari, who are expected to sign Kimi Raikkonen from McLaren, have promised an announcement after the race. Until then, they and the German are keeping the secret to themselves. 

Of course I know that Ferraris announcement is being eagerly awaited, said Schumacher on his website. 

We announced last week that it will be made on Sunday following the race because we want to do our best in focusing on the race, and of course Im sticking to this agreement. So all I can do is ask everyone to understand that I dont want to touch on that subject until next Sunday. 

It was at the Milanese circuit, with Benetton in 1991, that the German scored his first points in only his second Grand Prix. 

 The first time I raced, I never had any idea 

 that I would make it so far, he said in a 2003 biography. 

 That was in Monza in 1991 when I drove further than 

 500 metres for the first time (in a Grand Prix). 

 It was at Monza, in 2000, that he cried openly after 

 equalling the late Sennas 41 wins in a race that also 

 saw a marshal fatally injured.

 Ill make many eat their words, says Ronaldo

 - Pele, Platini under attack 

Rio de Janeiro: Troubled Brazil forward Ronaldo launched an astonishing attack on two of footballs legends, Pele and Michel Platini, in a Brazilian newspaper. 

The overweight and under-fire Real Madrid galactico branded Pele, commonly regarded as the greatest player ever, as a two-bob opportunist and hit out at European legend Platini as jealous in Sundays edition of the newspaper. 

Ronaldos outburst comes after his latest failing on the football field. He started Saturdays vital league match at Valencia on the bench but came on in the second half only to have a penalty saved. 

The striker has already spent much of the season under fire from Reals expectant fans and Madrids demanding media. 

At the World Cup, I will make a lot of people eat their words, declared a defiant Ronaldo, showing more fight than he has been accused of displaying in the white shirt of his club. 

I was disappointed with Pele, hes a two-bob opportunist, added Ronaldo, who proceeded to allude that the great goalscorer would be better off looking after his family amid allegations his son is involved in a drug trafficking scandal. 

I care nothing for Platini. I have a French teammate friend (Zidane) who has surpassed everything he ever did and he has always told me that Platini is jealous. 

After denigrating two of the worlds greats, Ronaldo then somewhat ironically, added, All I want is for people to treat me with respect and that is not what is happening.

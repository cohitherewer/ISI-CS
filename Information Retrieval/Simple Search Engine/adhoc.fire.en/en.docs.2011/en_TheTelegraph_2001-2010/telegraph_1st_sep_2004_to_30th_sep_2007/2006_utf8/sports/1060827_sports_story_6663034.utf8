 Further delay in Inzamam hearing

 - THE OVAL FIASCO 

 Inzamam

London: Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haqs hearing on charges of ball-tampering and bringing cricket into disrepute must wait until the end of next month. 

International Cricket Council (ICC) chief executive Malcolm Speed said on Saturday that earlier reports had falsely suggested a hearing was set for September 15. 

Inzamams case was initially to be heard Friday. 

But after consultation with the legal team assembled by Pakistan for the inquiry into Inzamams behaviour in the abandoned fourth Test at The Oval last weekend, both parties have agreed to a further delay. 

It was put back when it transpired Chief Referee Ranjan Madugalle was unavailable to chair the hearing because of a family problem, and Speed explained why Inzamam must now wait even longer than had been anticipated. 

When we met with the lawyers of the PCB yesterday which was a very amicable meeting we suggested that the hearing happen on the 14th and 15th, bearing in mind that the one-day series finishes the previous Sunday, Speed said. 

That date did not suit them for one reason or another and they asked for it to be put back. We are looking now for a date that suits the key participants so at this stage we are looking at the last week of September. 

Meanwhile, Pakistans players have been told to forget the ball-tampering row look to winning the Twenty20 match and one-day series against England, team manager Zaheer Abbas said on Saturday. 

They have been advised that the PCB and ICC will sort out the ball-tampering row and to just concentrate on doing well in the one-day series, Zaheer said. 

Let me make it clear the Pakistan team had decided early Friday morning they would play the series much before the ICC made its announcement about Hair, Zaheer said. 

A new twist was added to the controversy after Speed told a news conference on Friday that Hair had asked for $500,000 to quit. 

What can I say but if you go through the correspondence between Hair and the ICC and then his retraction it shows his confused state of mind. I have no doubt we will benefit from these developments, Zaheer added.

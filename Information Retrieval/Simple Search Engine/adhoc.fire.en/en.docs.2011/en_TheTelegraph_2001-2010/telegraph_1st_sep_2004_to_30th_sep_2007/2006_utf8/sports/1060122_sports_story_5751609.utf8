 Atwal stays in hunt

Palm Desert (California): Arjun Atwal turned in a two-under 70 to stay in the hunt for a top-10 finish in his first appearance on the 2006 US PGA Tour. 

The Indian ace, playing on the classic course on the third day, had four birdies and one bogey on the back stretch after starting out on the tenth. 

He turned in three-under and looked set to enter the top-10 but two bogeys on front nine of the course on first and seventh and just one birdie on eighth, meant he finished at 70 and was in tied 28th place. 

However, the Indian was still very much within reach of a good finish as he was just three shots behind the group tied seventh. 

 Meanwhile, former Asian No. 1 Jyoti Randhawa made significant inroads and moved within striking distance of a top-10 finish, as a three-under 69 helped him get to six-under 210 for three days at the end of 54 holes in the $2 million Abu Dhabi Open. 

He was in a crowded tie for 13th place, with a dozen others, adds another report from Abu Dhabi. 

Meanwhile in Karachi, Indians continued to figure prominently on the leaderboard as the trio, Amandeep Johl, Jeev Milkha Singh and Ashok Kumar were lying fourth with a three-day total of eight-under 208 in the $200,000 Pakistan Open at the Karachi Golf Club on Saturday. 

The Indians were seven off the lead as Q-school winner, Chris Rodgers shrugged aside a double bogey to card a 68 and total 15-under 201 for 54 holes. India had four in top-10 and Pakistan, too, had a good representation with three. (AGENCIES)

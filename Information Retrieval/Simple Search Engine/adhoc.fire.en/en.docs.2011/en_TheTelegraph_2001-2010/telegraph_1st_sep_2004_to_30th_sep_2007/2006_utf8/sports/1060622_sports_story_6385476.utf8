 Souravs tidy spell on Day I

London: Sourav Ganguly had a quiet first day for Northamptonshire on Wednesday, having to be contented with a nine-over spell only. 

Hosts Worcestershire, opting for first strike at New Road in the four-day Division II County Championship game, ran riot with Phil Jaques leading the way. 

The Aussie opener smashed 202 as Worcestershire closed Day I on 394 for four in 102 overs. Former England batsman Graeme Hick was unbeaten on 93 at stumps. 

Sourav bowled a tidy spell of nine overs of which three were maidens. He conceded just 23 runs without taking a wicket. 

England left-arm spinner Monty Panesar and M. Nicholson took a wicket apiece. 

Sourav will face Zaheer Khan when Northants get out to bat. The left-arm seamer, who also played for India, is in fine form for Worcester and took nine wickets in an innings the other day.

 Shabbir back at rehabilitation camp 

Islamabad: Banned pacer Shabbir Ahmed returned on Friday to a rehabilitation camp as Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) is keen on getting his action cleared from the ICC ahead of the England tour following doubts over the fitness of speedster Shoaib Akhtar, Umar Gul and Rana Naved-ul Hasan. 

Shabbir, who was banned for 12 months last December, and ICC Bowling Action Review Group (BRG) also rejected his appeal last month, joined the camp in Lahore under the supervision of former Test pacer Sarfraz Nawaz. 

Obviously, with Akhtars situation not clear and with doubts over the fitness of Umar Gul (back problem) and that of Rana Naved-ul Hasan (shoulder injury), we are looking at the possibility of having Shabbir available for the England tour. If the ICC clears his action he could be a very important bowler in the English conditions, a PCB official said on Friday.

 Northants lose, Sourav gets duck

London: Sourav Gangulys disappointing season debut was complete after he was out for a duck in the second innings and Northamptonshire crashed to an innings and 222-run defeat against Worcestershire in a County championship Division II match at New Road on Friday. 

Souravs failure came on a day when BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah said that the Indian may be considered for India selection if he does well in the County circuit. Sourav, who was castled by compatriot Zaheer Khan for two in the first innings, managed to stay at the crease for nine minutes and faced seven balls before being caught by Australian Phil Jaques off Matt Mason. 

Northants, following on after being bundled out for 67 in reply to Worcestershires first-innings total of 543 for 9 declared, were all out for 254. Zaheer, who returned the first-innings figures of 5 for 27, took one for 59. Meanwhile, Dinesh Mongias 62 could not save Leicestershire from a seven-wicket defeat against Gloucestershire. Riding on an unbeaten 115 by Alex Gidman, Gloucestershire had no problem in overhauling the target of 323 runs set by Leicester.

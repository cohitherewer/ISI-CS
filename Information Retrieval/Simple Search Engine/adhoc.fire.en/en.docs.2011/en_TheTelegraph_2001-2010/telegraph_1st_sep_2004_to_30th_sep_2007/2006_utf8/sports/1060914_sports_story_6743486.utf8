 Opening problem Paks bane: Imran

Karachi: Pakistan great Imran Khan has blamed captain Inzamam-ul Haq and coach Bob Woolmer for the teams inability to find a reliable pair of openers, which he felt was to be blamed for its disastrous showing in the Test series against England. 

Before Pakistan reached England they had a problem with the opening pair that had been troubling them for last few years. Now Pakistan leave England having the same problem and still as confused about how to solve it, he said in his column in a Pakistan daily. 

The opening problem consistently let Pakistan down throughout the Test and one-day series and this was the fault of the two responsible people, the captain and the coach, he added. 

Pakistan lost the four-Test series 3-0 while in the one-dayers they allowed England to draw 2-2 after winning the first two matches. 

Imran said by now Inzamam and Woolmer would have realised that chopping and changing the openers with such frequency does not serve any purpose. 

Imran said since the 70s Pakistan had not been able to produce an opener equipped to play Test cricket. 

The only option available to Pakistan was to back two young opening batsmen who had the talent as well as the courage needed to face the new ball.

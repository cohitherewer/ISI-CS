 Atwal slips 

Milwaukee: Arjun Atwal slipped up on the third day of the US Bank Championship with a three-over 73 that saw him slide to tied 48th place after 54 holes in a rain-hit tournament. 

The Indian was placed second after first round and tied for 13th at the half-way stage. 

Corey Pavin, who seemed to be running away with the tournament, slowed down in the third round. He birdied five holes, but also made his first three bogeys of the tournament, to card a two-under 68 for an aggregate of 17-under 193. 

Pavin is two ahead of Jerry Kelly (64) and three ahead of Frank Lickliter (64) and D. J. Trahan (65). 

Atwal was three-under after 11 holes, when play was suspended on the second day. Resuming on Saturday, he hit a bad patch with three bogeys in four holes between fifth and eighth. He finished with one-under for the second round. 

Later on Saturday, the Indian again ran into trouble on the last four holes of the front stretch. He began with a birdie on the fourth, but followed it with a bogey on the next. Then three straight bogeys from seventh to ninth spelt disaster for him. (PTI)

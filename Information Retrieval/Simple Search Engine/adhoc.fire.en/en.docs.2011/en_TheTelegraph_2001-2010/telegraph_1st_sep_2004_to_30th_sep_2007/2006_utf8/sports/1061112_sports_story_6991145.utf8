 Pak want more matches

Karachi: Pakistan have decided to press for the right to host more matches of the 2011 World Cup which it will jointly host with India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. 

The International Cricket Council (ICC) awarded the hosting rights of the World Cup to the four south Asian countries this year in April and under an initial agreement Pakistan is to host 16 games, including one semi-final. 

India would be hosting 22 matches and the final, Sri Lanka nine and a semi-final and Bangladesh six games including the opening ceremony. But sources said Pakistan is now having second thoughts about the number of matches they have got after India insisted on hosting the final. (Agencies)

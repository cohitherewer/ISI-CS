 Mahindra hold Salgaocar

Mumbai: Mahindra United staged a late recovery to salvage a 2-2 draw against a determined Salgaocar, Goa in an evenly contested 10th ONGC National Football League match on Monday. 

Mahindra struck in the seventh minute when Yusif Yakubu headed home a cross from right winger Steven Dias. 

But Salgaocar ignored the early pressure and equalised in the 18th minute through striker Samson Singh. 

The Goan side returned after the half-time to dominate the early part of the second half and were rewarded in the 53rd when Man of the Match Jyothi Kumar put them ahead. 

Desperate to prevent a loss, Mahindra pressed hard for the equaliser and were finally rewarded for their effort five minutes later when defender Mahesh Gawli rushed into the box to unleash a smart header off a Dias cross that stunned the Salgaocar defence. 

Mahindra remain in second spot with 20 points from nine matches, while Salgaocar have eight points from 11 matches. The next match at the Cooperage will be between Mahindra United and Air India on Thursday. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Beighton from March 28 

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: The 111th edition of Beighton Cup will have a strong field with Indian Airlines making a comeback after a couple of years. 

The countrys oldest hockey tournament, scheduled to begin here on March 28, will also see defending champions BSF Jalandhar, runners-up Army XI and Indian Oil among others vying for top honours. 

Indian Oil will remain the title sponsors. 

Meanwhile, the BHA is still not sure whether a Pakistan outfit from Multan would be able to participate. 

Were going to send necessary papers to New Delhi tomorrow and if their visa problems get sorted out quickly, we can hope for their participation, BHA secretary Gurbux Singh said on Friday.

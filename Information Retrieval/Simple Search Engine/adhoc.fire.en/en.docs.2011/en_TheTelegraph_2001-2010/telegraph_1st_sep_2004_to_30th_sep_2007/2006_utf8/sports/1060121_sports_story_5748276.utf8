The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Passion key to Aussie dominance

Stickwork

 Bharat Chhetri rsquo;s performance was one of the few positives for India

Last months Champions Trophy revealed the existing difference between our hockey and their hockey. The tournament ? which, I think, is tougher than even the World Cup and the Olympics ? not only reflected Australias dominance, but more importantly, also highlighted how passionate they are about the game. 

There were three teams which looked like winning the title ? Australia, Holland and Spain. Going into the Chennai meet, Spain were the team to watch out. They had done really well in 2005, winning the European Championship. 

Eventually, Spain finished third in the Champions Trophy, but they showed a lot of promise which suggested they would be a potent force in the upcoming events. 

Holland decided to continue with the tried and tested bunch who did their best. The Dutch were definitely the No. 2 team of the tournament. 

That brings us to the Aussies, who were undoubtedly the domineering force and the most outstanding team of the championship. A few years ago, Australia built a new team which has now developed into a mature unit. The way they performed in Chennai speaks volumes of the players passion about hockey. Having captured the Olympic gold, they are on top of the hockey world right now. 

Frankly speaking, I expected Germany ? who have already qualified for the World Cup ? to bring up the rear, but unfortunately, India finished last. The hype over beating Pakistan in the league stage vanished in no time as the hosts disappointed all and sundry. Strictly going by the way they performed, Pakistan and India deserved the last two spots (fifth and sixth). 

For the Indian team, it was once again the story of performing well in patches and disappointments aplenty. That has been the case over the past few years ? a brilliant win followed by a shocking surrender. In the end, what hurt me most is the fact that we failed to qualify for the next World Cup. It was really disappointing that we as the hosts had to finish last. 

There were some positives, like Bharat Chhetris performance. Adrian DSouza, our No. 1 goalkeeper, played badly in the first two matches and thereafter, it was Chhetri all the way. 

Sandeep Singh was quite good in converting penalty corners, but his overall performance was not up to expectations. As I had feared, Dilip Tirkeys absence was a huge blow to the team. 

 One of the brightest faces of the Champions Trophy was A. Lambard, the Aussie goalkeeper who was confidence personified. Then there was Tabau and Juan Paul Amat. 

We saw big coaches in operation in Chennai ? Barry Dancer of Australia, Roelant Oltmans of Holland, Bernhard Peters of Germany, Maurits Hendricks of Spain. They brought in new techniques and tactics, and applied them successfully in the tournament. Such techniques were new to Pakistanis and Indians. Its high time we thought of these things and picked them up from the foreign coaches. 

Lets move over to the Premier Hockey League (PHL). The second edition of the PHL, now underway in Chandigarh, seems to be getting popular by the day with the crowds coming in large numbers. 

Like in the inaugural meet, a clutch of foreigners are taking part in Chandigarh as well. We have Rehan Butt, Mohammed Saqlain, Imran Warsi, Adnan Zakir and Shaquil Abbasi from Pakistan, Boeman from Holland, Lombi from Argentina and Quemada of Spain. 

As was seen in the Hyderabad meet, the Europeans find it difficult to adjust to Indian and Pakistani styles. This is probably because of the fact that the subcontinent teams still play the old style of hockey, based on individual brilliance. This looks entertaining at times, but is not enough to win a match.

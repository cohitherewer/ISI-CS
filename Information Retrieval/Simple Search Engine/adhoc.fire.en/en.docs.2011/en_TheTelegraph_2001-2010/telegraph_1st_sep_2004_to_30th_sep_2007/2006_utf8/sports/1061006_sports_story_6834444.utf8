 Vaughan hopes to play last 2 Ashes Tests

St Andrews: Michael Vaughan hopes to play in the final two Ashes Tests as his rehabilitation from a knee injury continues, he said on Thursday. 

The 31-year-old, who has not played for England since the second Test against Pakistan in Lahore in December, had been cautious about the improvement in his knee after surgery but shrugged off previous reports that his career may be over. 

At one stage it looked as though it would be the World Cup for the comeback but now I am so ahead of schedule there is a possibility that I may be back in time for the last two Tests (of the Ashes), he said. 

I am hoping to go down to Australia and play in a few matches of club cricket and then well take it from there, added Vaughan, who was speaking at the Dunhill Links Championship in Scotland. 

The first Ashes Test begins in Brisbane on November 23 with the fourth in Melbourne from December 26) and the fifth and final Test in Sydney from January 2. 

However, chairman of selectors David Graveney was more circumspect when asked about an earlier-than-expected comeback for the Yorkshire player. 

We know his rehab is going well and thats great news but there is a lot of water to go under the bridge, he told the BBC. He still hasnt had a bat. He is running but he hasnt twisted or turned on the knee. 

Hes going to go as and when he is ready to play. Plans are in place they are not for public consumption and they will be activated when he is passed fit.

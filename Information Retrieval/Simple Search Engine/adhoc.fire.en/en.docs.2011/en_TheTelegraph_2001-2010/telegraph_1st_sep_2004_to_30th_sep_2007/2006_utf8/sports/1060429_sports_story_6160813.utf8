The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Hosts may not be identified tomorrow

 A STAFF REPORTER

 2011 World Cup

 Calcutta: A decision as 

 to who would host the 2011 World Cup might not be possible 

 on Sunday, when the ICC Executive Board meets in Dubai to 

 pick the hosts for 2011 as well as the 2015 meets.

 An ICC release quotes chief executive 

 Malcolm Speed as saying that the strong bids submitted by 

 the two parties (Asias Big Four and Australia-New 

 Zealand) for the 2011 event may result in neither of them 

 receiving a majority on Sunday.

 Both have government support 

 and have indicated their ability to comply with strict ICC 

 criteria regarding the number of venues, quality of facilities 

 and exemption from tax. This leaves us in a very positive 

 position where we have two strong options and there will 

 doubtless be extensive discussion as to which submission 

 will be successful.

 It may be that neither submission 

 has sufficient support at the end of the meeting in which 

 case the Board will have to reconvene at a later date. This 

 has happened in the past, most notably during discussions 

 regarding the hosting of the 1996 World Cup, and is something 

 we will deal with if required, said Speed.

 That situation might lead to a 

 decision on the 2015 edition hosts being put on hold, too.

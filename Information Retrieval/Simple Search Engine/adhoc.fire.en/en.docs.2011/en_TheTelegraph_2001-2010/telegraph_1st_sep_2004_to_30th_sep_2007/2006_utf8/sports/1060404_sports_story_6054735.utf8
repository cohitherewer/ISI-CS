OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: Faced with the problems of availability of grounds in Calcutta, both East Bengal and Mohun Bagan may be forced to play their NFL home matches against Dempo in Mumbai. 

The AIFF, which handed over the provisional draw for the remainder of the NFL to all the clubs for their suggestions, has fixed the East Bengal versus Dempo match in Mumbai on April 16. On April 21, Mohun Bagan are suppose to play Dempo at the same venue. 

The final draw, however, will only be released on Tuesday after the clubs submit their suggestions. The AIFF, however, are not holding any match on neutral venues like Delhi, Kozhikode or Bangalore.

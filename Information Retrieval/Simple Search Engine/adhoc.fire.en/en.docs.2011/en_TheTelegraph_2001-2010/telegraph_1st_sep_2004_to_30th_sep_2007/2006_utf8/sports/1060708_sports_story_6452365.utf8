London: Its Roger Federer versus Rafael Nadal in another Grand Slam final. 

Federer, hitting breathtaking winners from all parts of the court, overwhelmed Swedens Jonas Bjorkman 6-2, 6-0, 6-2 in 77 minutes on Saturday to close in on his fourth consecutive Wimbledon title. 

With the loss of only four games by Federer, it was the most one-sided mens semi-final at Wimbledon since the tournament adopted its current format in 1922. 

Nadal, the two-time French Open champion, continued his stunning run on grass by beating Marcos Baghdatis, 6-1, 7-5, 6-3 to reach his first Wimbledon championship. 

Nadal has beaten Federer in four finals this year, including at the French Open last month, and has a 6-1 career edge. Federer is 54-0 against all other players this year. 

The 20-year-old Nadal is bidding to become the first Spaniard to win the title here since Manolo Santana in 1966, and the first player to win the French and Wimbledon in the same year since Bjorn Borg in 1980. 

Its the first time since 1952 that the same players have reached back-to-back finals at the French Open and Wimbledon. 

In the first semi-final, the Swiss destroyed his 34-year-old unseeded opponent in a display of brutal brilliance before a beguiled Centre Court crowd. 

Federer won 11 games in a row at one stage of the mismatch with an array of winners from all parts of the court and completed his most comprehensive win of the tournament in only 77 minutes. 

Federer has now won 47 matches in a row on grass and has yet to drop a set in this years tournament. The only other man to win Wimbledon without dropping a set since tennis turned professional in 1968 was Swedens Bjorn Borg 30 years ago. 

I played a secure game plan in the beginning and then I really got on a roll and I played excellent tennis, said Federer. I got into every one of his service games and I think that was difficult for him. 

Doubles specialist Bjorkman was playing in only the second Grand Slam singles semi-final of his career and his first at Wimbledon. 

Holding serve in the first game of the match was good as it got for the Swede, however. 

Federer mesmerised him and the crowd after that and his ripped, dipping top-spun forehand was the Swiss preferred shot of the day. 

Leander Paes hopes of making the doubles final ended when he lost to former partner Nenad Zimonjic. Paes and Martin Damm, the seventh seeds, were no match for No. 6 seeds Zimonjic and Fabrice Santoro and could put up some fight only in the third set. 

The Serbian-French pair overcame the Indo-Czech team 6-2, 6-1, 7-5. Paes had won the 1999 Wimbledon title with fellow-Indian Mahesh Bhupathi. 

Meanwhile, Chinese fourth seeds Zi Yan and Jie Zheng entered the womens doubles final knocking out No. 2 seeds Cara Black and Rennae Stubbs 6-2, 7-6 (7-3).

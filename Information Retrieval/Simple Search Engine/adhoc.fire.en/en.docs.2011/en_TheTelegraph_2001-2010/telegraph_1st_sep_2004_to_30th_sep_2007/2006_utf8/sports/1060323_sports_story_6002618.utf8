 Women's World chess

 Ekaterinburg: Twice World 

 Cup winner Xu Yuhua of China and Alisa Galliamova of Russia 

 will vie for title in the final of the womens World

 a deadlock, Svetlana Matveeva of Russia was the first to 

 run out of steam against Xu and lost a keenly-contested 

 tie.

 of Lithuania surrendered against Galliamova.

 Target was improbable: Dravid

 - Sehwags presence made me cautious: Lara 

Basseterre: Team India captain Rahul Dravid defended his teams decision to down the shutters in the final session of the third Test rather than go for a rare overseas victory, saying the task at hand was improbable. 

History shows that over 4.5 runs per over on the final day has never been done. We had a good start and we looked like having a whiff in the afternoon. But the ball was old and a bit soft and after Dhoni got out, we played for a draw, Dravid said after India briefly toyed and then abandoned the dramatic bid. 

It wasnt the kind of wicket where you could go and smash every ball. I dont think smashing every ball would have been prudent as well, he added. 

India had promoted wicketkeeper Mahendra Singh Dhoni in order to push on with the scoring. The whiff was real as the equation was 149 runs from 25 overs with seven wickets in hand. But Dhoni, after starting with a six, then appeared to play conservatively. 

It was a kind of wicket where there were certain shots you couldnt play. The West Indian captain realised it quickly and instructed his bowlers to bowl wide off the off-stump. 

When you pitched short, it was keeping low. If the ball was short, you didnt get much pace off the square cut. Once the ball comes on to the bat, you can use the angle, use pace and get runs square off the wicket, Dravid said. 

The Indian captain did not agree with his West Indian counterpart Brian Laras assertion that the home side held the psychological advantage. I am not sure if that is true. Going into tea, it was our team which was sniffing a victory, Dravid said. 

He admitted that his side was on the backfoot after early wickets on the fourth morning but claimed there was still a quiet sense of confidence among the players. 

Dravid defended the selection of Sreesanth ahead of VRV Singh and also stood by Yuvraj Singh who is having a lean series so far. 

 Lara said he had no regrets about not enforcing the follow-on. 

Ive not regretted the decision, if it was a 300-run lead I would have batted again, if it happens in Jamaica (where the fourth Test starts on Friday) I will bat again, Lara said. 

My team depends on fast bowlers, they run from 25 yards and they need that sort of rest if they have to work really hard in the first innings. 

Its a choice you have to make and Im quite happy putting myself back into bat in this match and setting a total just beyond them. 

With the likes of Virender Sehwag in their ranks, you always want to be cautious. Indians must be given credit for sniffing a win towards the end.

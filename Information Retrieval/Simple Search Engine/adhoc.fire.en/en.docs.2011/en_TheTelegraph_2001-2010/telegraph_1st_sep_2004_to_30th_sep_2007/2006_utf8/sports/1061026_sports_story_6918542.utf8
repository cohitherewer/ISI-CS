The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Sainiks arrested

 SHARP SINGLES

 Mohali: 

 Shiv Sena leader Jai Bhagwan Goyal was among 138 Sainiks 

 arrested by the police for allegedly trying to march to 

 the PCA Stadium here where the Pakistan-New Zealand match 

 was in progress with an aim to disrupt the proceedings.

 We have arrested 138 Shiv 

 Sainiks for breaching the peace and threatening to disrupt 

 the Champions Trophy match. They will be produced before 

 the sub divisional magistrate tomorrow, Mohali Phase 

 VIII station house officer Inspector Satnam Singh said.

 Shiv Sena had earlier threatened 

 not to allow the match to take place saying they would not 

 allow the team of the country which was allegedly perpetrating 

 terror in India to play here.

 Caught off guard 

 Ahmedabad: A private security 

 guard at the Motera sustained a minor injury when he was 

 hit by a ball coming from Sachin Tendulkars bat during 

 a practice match.

 Tendulkar hit a lofted shot and 

 the ball went outside the ground hitting the guard on his 

 hand on Tuesday, Gujarat Cricket Association president Narhari 

 Amin said.

 The ball did hit the guard 

 on the arm and there was a swelling, Amin said, adding 

 that Tendulkar later apologised to the guard and paid him 

 money for his medical treatment.

 Sajids priorities 

 Ahmedabad: For England 

 paceman Sajid Mahmood, religion is important to him but 

 he doesnt allow it to interfere in his cricketing 

 sche- dule.

 How one should display his 

 personal religion is an individual preference. I personally 

 do not do that (on the cricket field), Sajid said.

 Sajid, who was replying to a query 

 related to Pakistan teams overt display of religion, 

 also said he found it difficult to observe namaz five times 

 a day regularly.

 I pray as much as I can. 

 But I do not tend to break practices and go off the field 

 specially to pray, he said.

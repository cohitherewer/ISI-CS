 PCB under fire from Senate

Islamabad: Pakistan Senates standing committee has asked the PCB to explain its decision to hand over the marketing rights of two ODIs against India later this month to the BCCI, reports said on Tuesday. 

The PCB has been summoned to appear before the Senates standing committee on sports and culture on April 10 and furnish details of the two one-dayers in Abu Dhabi on April 18 and 19, it was reported. 

The PCB has promised its players an appearance fee of Rs 15 lakh for the two games and has proposed to pay Abu Dhabi Cricket Council a million dollar. 

The BCCI has sold the in-stadia rights for the two matches to Percept DMark and was to make a decision on other rights shortly. 

The two boards have agreed to donate the profits from the first match to victims of the earthquake in Kashmir last year. 

In a bid to avoid controversy, PCB has prepared also legal documents to formally exclude the two ODIs from the five-year agreement on playing offshore games against India. 

Meanwhile, the two matches will be sponsored by DLF.

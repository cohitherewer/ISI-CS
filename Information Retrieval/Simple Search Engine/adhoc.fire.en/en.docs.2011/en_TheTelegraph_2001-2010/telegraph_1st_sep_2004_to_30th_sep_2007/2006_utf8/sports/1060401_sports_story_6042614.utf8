 Tendulkar now No. 17

 - icc test rankings 

Dubai: The recent poor form of top Indian batsmen was reflected in the latest ICC Test rankings with only two of its players featuring among the top-10 and Sachin Tendulkar was pushed down to 17th spot. 

Sachin, who had a string of low scores before suffering a shoulder injury, was on 16 th spot while a severely out-of-form Virender Sehwag barely managed to hang on to his 10th spot. 

Skipper Rahul Dravid was the highest placed and only other Indian batsman in the top-10, maintaining his fifth position. 

V.V.S. Laxman was a distant 26th which means there are only three Indian batsmen in the top 25. 

Among the bowlers, Anil Kumble was at the 11th position while Irfan Pathan was following him at 13th. Off-spinner Harbhajan Singh is 20th.

 Technical committee endorses decision on Nayeem ouster

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: Speculations over Syed Nayeemuddin continuing as the national coach was put to rest by the technical committee of the All India Football Federation (AIFF) here on Monday when they endorsed the decision of the executive committee to reorganise the technical team in charge of the national team. 

The members, however, expressed their disappointment over the way the coach and the players criticised each other after the disastrous campaign in the Asian Cup qualifiers and requested the federation to put an end to it. Indian skipper Bhaichung Bhutia criticising the coach did not send the right message, a member said. 

The technical committee, mainly consist of former top footballers like Inder Singh, Mohammed Habib, Pradeep Chowdhury and AD Nagendran, which met under the chairmanship of CR Vishwanathan, felt there was no reason to continue with Nayeemuddin. 

We advised the AIFF to bring a good foreign coach as soon as possible, said a member after the meeting. Continuing with Nayeemuddin, the committee thought would be like taking a step backward. We felt a couple of good Indian coaches should be attached with the foreign coach as understudy. We also requested the AIFF to keep the technical committee posted over the developments all the time. The target should not be winning the SAFF championship. Effort should be made to come within 10 Asian teams. 

One of the members pointed out that Nayeemuddin has got his quota of chances, but couldnt produce the desired results. He has coached the national team several times since 1986 including four Nehru Cups, two Asian Cups and one Asian Games. It is time to look for some else to do the job. The coach should be young and in the know of modern things. 

The technical committee also advised the AIFF to build a large pool of talented players, who could replace injured or out of form footballers. 

A member later said that the federation has been receiving quite a few applications from foreign coaches regularly. Some of them are quite good like the ones from former national team coaches of Ireland and France.

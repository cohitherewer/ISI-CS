The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 BCCI, WICB set July 20 deadline for Canadians

 - Three ODIs between India, WI

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Calcutta:The Board of Control 

 for Cricket in India (BCCI) and the West Indies Cricket 

 Board (WICB) have set a July 20 deadline for the Canadians 

 to indicate whether a new venue in pretty Toronto will be 

 ready to host three ODIs in September. 

The well-known Toronto Cricket, Skating amp; Curling Club ground isnt available, or else the off-shore matches between India and the West Indies would have been held there. 

The Club, it may be recalled, staged the Sahara Cup ODIs featuring India and Pakistan from 1996-98. 

Then, in 1999 ? when, post-Kargil, New Delhi banned bilateral Indo-Pak matches in neutral venues ? it hosted a short series between India and the West Indies. 

[Led by Sourav Ganguly, India had won 2-1.] 

As time is short, weve asked the Canadian Cricket Association (CCA) to give us the update by July 20? If the new venue cant be ready, then the ODIs are going to be played next June, informed former BCCI president Inderjit Singh Bindra. 

The matches will bolster the finances of both Boards, particularly the WICB, which isnt exactly in a healthy state. 

Speaking to The Telegraph from London, Bindra (who has been handling the negotiations) added: If the ODIs are deferred till next year, then the US and Canada are going to be the staging countries? 

The United States of America Cricket Association, incidentally, was represented at a stock-taking meeting in London, a few days ago, where International Cricket Council (ICC) chief executive Malcolm Speed was present. 

Even if the CCA gets back positively, the new venue has to be approved by an ICC inspection team. 

Besides facilities for the players, the ICC will look at things like security? Theres a protocol in place and an exception cannot be made, Bindra pointed out. 

The WICB, by the way, has said no to playing either in Europe or South East Asia (Singapore/Kuala Lumpur) ? alternatives suggested by the BCCI, prior to the meeting in London. 

Obviously, it wants to cater to the very significant number of West Indians whove settled across North America.

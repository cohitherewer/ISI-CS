Nottingham: Captain Andrew Flintoff produced a brutal display of bowling to give England the upper hand after the opening day of the third and final Test against Sri Lanka on Friday. 

The giant allrounder, bowling just back of a length and hitting speeds of more than 91mph, took the big wickets of Kumar Sangakkara (36), Mahela Jayawardene (0) and Sanath Jayasuriya (4) as Sri Lanka were dismissed for 231. 

England, 1-0 up in the series, then lost both openers cheaply to close on 53 for two. 

Flintoffs muscular intervention sparked a top-order batting collapse just before lunch, three wickets falling for two runs in three overs. From 84 for one, Sri Lanka slumped to 139 for eight. 

Sri Lankans had the consolation of watching their last three batsmen slog 92 runs, underlining how badly things had gone before. 

Having failed to reach 200 in their first innings at Lords and 150 at Edgbaston, the touring side were looking for a big statement after winning the toss. 

Instead, their openers were parted cheaply yet again, Michael Vandort playing on with two on the board. 

That gave lively medium pacer Jon Lewis a wicket with the fourth ball of his debut. Lewis finished with three for 68, compared to Flintoffs three for 52. 

The key to the day was the fall of Sangakkara after an 82-run stand for the second wicket with Upul Tharanga (34). 

By then Flintoff was working up a real sweat as he thundered in from the Pavilion End.

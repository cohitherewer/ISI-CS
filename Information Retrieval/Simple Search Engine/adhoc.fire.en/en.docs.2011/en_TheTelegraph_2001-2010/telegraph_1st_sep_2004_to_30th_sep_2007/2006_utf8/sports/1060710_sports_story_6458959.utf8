 Harmison in squad for 1st Test vs Pak

London: England have named Matthew Hoggard in a 13-man squad for the first Test against Pakistan starting at Lords on Thursday despite a freak accident that required six stitches in his bowling hand. 

Hoggard was playing rugby in the warm-up before the third day of England As match against Pakistan on Saturday when Yorkshire teammate Tim Bresnan stood on his hand. 

Steve Harmison has been recalled after missing the drawn series against Sri Lanka with a shin injury. 

 THE SQUAD 

Andrew Strauss (captain), Marcus Trescothick, Alastair Cook, Kevin Pietersen, Ian Bell, Paul Collingwood, Geraint Jones, Matthew Hoggard, Liam Plunkett, Steve Harmison, Sajid Mahmood, Jon Lewis, Monty Panesar. 

 Sami injured 

Meanwhile, there was a fresh cause for concern in the Pakistani camp when Mohammed Sami sustained a knee injury in the tie against England A in Canterbury on Sunday. Sami was hit on the right knee while at mid-wicket.

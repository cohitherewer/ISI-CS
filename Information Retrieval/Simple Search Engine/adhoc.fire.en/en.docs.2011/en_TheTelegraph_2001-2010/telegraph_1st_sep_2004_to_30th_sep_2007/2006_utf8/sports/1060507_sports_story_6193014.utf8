 Paraguay sight on last-8 berth 

Ascunsion: Having qualified for the last 16 at the 2002 and 1998 tournaments, Paraguay are hoping to venture into unknown territory by reaching the quarter finals for the first time in Germany. 

The South Americans enjoyed a strong start to their 2006 qualifying campaign and led the standings after four rounds. 

They were unable to sustain their form however, with just one win in their next seven matches, but stopped the rot just in time after the introduction of some fresh blood into coach Anibal Ruizs ageing team. 

Eventually, the Paraguayans wrapped up the fourth qualifying spot with one match to spare, and will arrive in Germany with a squad boasting several emerging talents. 

Although their star player, Bayern Munich striker Roque Santa Cruz, is struggling to be fit, the Paraguayans have unearthed a clutch of exciting young players who are poised to make an impact. 

Werder Bremen forward Nelson Valdez has impressed in his outings for the national team so far, while another Bundesliga-based player, Julio dos Santos, has made great strides in midfield. Dos Santos will have the experienced Carlos Paredes alongside him. 

At the back, Paraguays defence will be marshalled by Carlos Gamarra, a veteran of more than 100 internationals who played in both the 1998 and 2002 tournaments. 

Gamarra is in no doubt that Paraguays 2006 vintage is more potent than previous years. There are huge differences, he said. In 1998, we were not at our best and ended up getting left behind. We marked a lot and barely played because we lacked a creative striker. Were a totally different team now. 

Its a fresh team. Our aim is to get past the last 16, something we havent achieved in two World Cups. Paraguay could do it this time because were better, he said.

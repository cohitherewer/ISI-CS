 Footballers wounded in mortar attack

Baghdad: Four footballers with one of the star teams in Iraqs top league were wounded on Sunday in a mortar attack while training in a Baghdad stadium, their manager said. 

Members of the Al-Zawra squad were out in force at the Al-Shashiga Stadium in the downtown Haifa district of Baghdad, enjoying the early afternoon winter sun, when a mortar round exploded on the pitch, Abdul Rashid said. 

Three players were seriously wounded and a fourth was more lightly hurt by flying shrapnel, Rashid said. 

Lying on the western bank of the Tigris, the largely Sunni neighbourhood of Haifa is a frequent battleground in the citys growing sectarian war, as well as a flashpoint for clashes between insurgents and US forces. (AFP)

 Strong start by Atwal

Las Vegas: Arjun Atwal made another determined and strong start at the frys.com Open as he continued his campaign to secure his card before running out of events on the US PGA Tour. 

Atwal, lying 138th on the money list and needing to squeeze into top-125, started with a fine five-under 67 on TPC Summerlin which was full of birdies. He was lying tied 15th, and three shots adrift of co-leaders, Bob Tway and Steve Flesch, who posted rounds of eight-under par. 

Daniel Chopra opened with two-under 69 on TPC canyons. 

Atwal opened on the first and had birdies on alternate holes starting from the third to the 13th. He added his sixth birdie on the 14th, but failed to get any more after that. His only dropped shot on front nine was the sixth and then came a late bogey on 17th. 

Chopra, already sure of his card for 2007, was tied 67th after first round in which he had six birdies, two bogeys and one double bogey on the third.

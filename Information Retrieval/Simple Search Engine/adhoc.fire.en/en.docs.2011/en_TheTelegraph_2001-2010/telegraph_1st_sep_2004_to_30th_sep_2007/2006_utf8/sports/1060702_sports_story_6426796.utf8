 Schumachers mind on a different track

Indianapolis: Michael Schumacher admitted that Michael Ballack and the rest of the German football team were to blame for his off during the opening practice session for the United States Grand Prix. 

The seven-time world champion German, 37, buried his car in the gravel during the opening practice session, during which he set the fastest time of the day by a race driver. 

And he later admitted that the crash was probably caused by him thinking about Germanys triumphant World Cup quarter final match against Argentina ? which was happening while practice was in progress. 

Schumacher said: Lets say I had more problems trying to watch the quarter finals on TV than I did in the cockpit of my Ferrari. 

When I went off the track this morning, maybe I was thinking too much about the grass on the football pitch, but Im very happy Germany won. 

Schumacher is desperate to win the US race for a record fifth time as he attempts to close the 25-point gap with Spaniard Fernando Alonso in the World Drivers Championship. 

And, after beating the Renault driver by a tenth of a second in the more meaningful afternoon session, he was in a buoyant mood.

 London: Team India thrashed 

 England 5-1 in the recent one-day series, but that didnt 

 stop Captain Nick Eades from wishing Rahul Dravid and the 

 rest the very best in the West Indies. 

The British Airways commander conveyed that shortly before the packed 747 service on the Mumbai-London sector touched down at Heathrow early on Friday, some 30 minutes ahead of schedule. Thanks, of course, to a mighty tail-wind. 

Eades wont be at the helm of the 777 flight from Gatwick to Kingston, our arrival point in the Caribbean, but his gesture was much appreciated by the Indians. It put them in an even better frame of mind before another long-haul journey. 

Incidentally, Dravid and vice-captain Virender Sehwag are the only ones travelling with the family. Ajit Agarkars may join if hes retained for the four-Test series as well. That squad will be chosen after the five-match series third ODI. 

Meanwhile, Indian crickets hottest star (in Sachin Tendulkars absence, that is), Mahendra Singh Dhoni, has clarified that hometown Ranchis administration announced his participation in an education-related project late last month without seeking his availability. 

 Interacting briefly on the 747, 

 somewhere over Dutch air space, Dhoni told The Telegraph: 

 Because of commitments to sponsors, I was never going 

 to be in Ranchi before May 5? As it turned out, I reached 

 two days after that? So, how could anybody publicise that 

 I would be there in end-April? 

Hes upset that some twisted facts to give the impression that commercial shoots in Mumbai mattered more than lending his name to a necessity for todays youth ? education. In any case, those commitments were being honoured at the end of a very demanding season. 

 Dhoni indicated he could, at some point, get involved 

 in that project if he was properly briefed and his consent 

 taken. Hes aware that the younger generation, not 

 just in Ranchi and Jharkhand, sees him as an icon.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Countdown over, real action begins now

 - Arclights zero in on Hingis, Sania 

MADHUMITA GANGULY

 Martina Hingis 

Calcutta: The heat is reaching fever pitch as the second edition of the Sunfeast Open gets off on Monday. The field boasts of five players in the top 100. But it goes without saying that the twin focus of attention is former world No. 1 Martina Hingis, and the darling of the Indian masses, Sania Mirza. 

Yes, Sania, despite being seeded only fifth. Despite there being three more seeds Karolina Sprem, Yuliana Fedak and Aravane Rezai between her and Hingis. Sania, by virtue of having put Indian womens tennis on the world map, continues to rule the roost. 

But first Martina. Current world No. 9, former world No. 1 and named after the legendary Martina Navratilova, Hingis has been the cynosure right from the moment she landed at the Dum Dum airport early on Friday and flashed that disarming smile. From that very moment, the Calcuttans collective expectations were on an upward graph. And why-ever not? 

Hingis, however, went about her business serious as ever carrying out her exercise regimen, practising at the Netaji Indoor Stadium under water-tight security. Unperturbed by the excitement she was generating all around her. 

Will speak to you tomorrow, she smiles at mediapersons when confronted at the hotel. 

Martina captured the worlds imagination when, in January 1997, she became the youngest Grand Slam singles winner in the 20th century by winning the Australian Open at the age of 16 years and three months. In March, she became the youngest-ever player to attain the world No. 1 ranking and in July the youngest singles champion at Wimbledon since 1887. 

The Swiss Miss, whose hobbies include skiing, swimming and horse riding (not to speak of shopping and musicals) is no stranger to controversy either, which perhaps adds to her enigmatic persona. And thus her apparently racial comments against the Williams sisters had kicked up quite a storm (Being black only helps them) as did her remark on Amelie Mauresmo (Shes here with her girlfriend. Shes half a man already.). 

All this before her ankle problems forced her out of the game. This was in 2003 when she was all of 22. By then, of course, she had five Grand Slam titles under her belt. 

Hingis returned to the Tour in 2006 January and, within eight months, was back in the top 10. No mean achievement this. 

Little wonder then that the crowd wishes to settle for nothing less than a Martina-Sania confrontation. Which, going by the draw should not happen before the semi-finals. 

Sania, too, has several firsts to her credit. The first India woman to reach the fourth round of a Grand Slam tournament at the 2005 US Open, the first Indian woman to win a WTA singles tournament in the 2005 Hyderabad Open, the first Indian sportswoman to feature on the cover of Time magazine and the first Indian who managed to deflect the cricket-obsessed countrys attention to another sport! No small achievement, any of these. 

Not surprising, then, that her presence in any Indian city drives people into a tizzy and the matter has to be dealt with an iron hand by the authorities. No wonder that she had to quietly sneak into her hotel through the back gate on Saturday night, to escape the mob (and media). 

By 7 am on Sunday, Sania was at the Netaji Indoor Stadium, all fresh and full of energy, in a bright yellow T-shirt, black shorts and a navy blue headband. She was back again in the evening, olive green T-shirt replacing the yellow, for a workout with doubles partner Liezel Huber. 

The fact that her ranking has fallen from an all-time high of 31 to a current No. 70 is no deterrent to her fans. And neither to her. For a regular on the Tour, these ups and downs are quite common, she said in a recent interview. 

She is optimistic. An optimism aided further by the comments of tennis guru Bob Brett: She should not stop dreaming she must remember improvement is a never-ending process 

Tennis connoisseurs are also waiting to see Nicole Pratt in action. The feisty one-time world No. 35, has been Australias leading female player over the majority of the last four years. 

Pratts a great fan of Michael Jordan: I think Michael Jordan is a legend! Individually, he took his sport to a whole new level. 

She aspires to become a better athlete, to leave no stone unturned. 

As the countdown begins, Calcuttans are tightening their seat belts for an engrossing week ahead.

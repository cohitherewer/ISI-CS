 Fifa confirms own goal 

Berlin: Englands goal in their 1-0 win over Paraguay on Saturday was confirmed by Fifa on Sunday as an own goal by Paraguays captain Carlos Gamarra. 

Fifas Technical Study Group reviewed the goal, scored when Beckhams flighted free-kick went into the Paraguayan net off the head of Gamarra. Gamarra said later his touch was minimal and he did not think it changed the direction of the ball. 

Fifa had said it would review all so-called dubious goals with the aim of awarding them to an attacking player where possible, rather than as own goals. 

But the Technical Study Group decided the own goal would stand, Fifa said at a news conference. (Reuters)

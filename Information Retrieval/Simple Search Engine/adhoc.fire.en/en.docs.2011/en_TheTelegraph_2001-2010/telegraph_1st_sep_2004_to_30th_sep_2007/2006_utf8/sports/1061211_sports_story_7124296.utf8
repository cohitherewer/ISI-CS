Doha: Indian hockey hit yet another low at the Al Rayyan Sports Complex on Sunday when they failed to reach the semi-finals for the first time in Asian Games history. 

Going into the match in a must-win situation against defending champions South Korea, the Indians played some good hockey in the second half, but were forced to share points after a 1-1 result. Korea and China made the last four from group B, with India being pushed to third place. 

This will be the first time that the Indian hockey team will return without a medal from the Games, but for coach Vasudevan Baskaran thats not a significant statistic. 

Even Pakistan failed to win a medal in the last Asian Games. Why make a big issue out of it? It happens sometimes, he shot back when asked on his teams dubious distinction. 

The Indian coach, whose future as national coach looks bleak, claimed that his boys dished out good hockey and he was proud of it. We played well. The match against China was the turning point. Otherwise, the boys did well. 

The Koreans took the lead through prolific goalgetter J. H. Jang, who took his tally to 13 goals in the tournament. 

India pressed hard in the last 15 minutes and got some reward when V. Raghunath struck with the third penalty corner. His straight and powerful hit left the Korean defence stranded. 

Only on Saturday, Indian captain Dilip Tirkey said that the team had practised indirect penalty corners for the entire training session. The trick was used in the two other penalty corners, but made no impact on the Korean defence. 

Tirkey looked devastated after the match. While some of the players and assistant coach Harendra Singh were seen cracking jokes with friends, Tirkey was visibly sad to be part of this black day. 

Yes, Im certainly aware that under my captaincy the team hasnt made the semis of the Asian Games for the first time We tried our best, but couldnt break the Korean defence, rued the skipper. 

India had chances to pip Korea to the post. Rajpal Singh missed a sitter minutes before the final hooter. Standing unmarked, he just had to deflect the ball into the goal, but reacted late.

Bangalore: Seeking to dispel the notion that he was a reckless shotmaker, Mahendra Singh Dhoni has said his immediate target is to maintain his current batting average of 52 and ensure he does not fritter away a good start. 

Believe me, one cannot get a century every time you walk in at No. 7. It is really difficult. My initial aim is to stay at the wicket to score 30 runs from 25 balls and then go for the bowlers, Dhoni said here. 

I have played international matches for over 18 months. I always like to give him hundred per cent to the teams cause. My immediate target is to maintain my current average, he said on Saturday on the sidelines of a visit to a showroom of a shoe company of which is a brand ambassador. 

The Jharkhand player admitted that he needed to work more on his wicketkeeping. 

I have to work hard in that area. It is all about reading the bowling arm of Anil (Kumble) and Harbhajan Singh as also the pace bowlers. Keeping wickets for spinners is a tough task as you have to read their pace and bounce, he said. 

Dhonis senior mates ? Yuvraj Singh and Harbhajan Singh, who were also present on the occasion ? said they were confident of putting up a good show in the upcoming tri-series in Sri Lanka. 

If we play to our potential, we can win the tournament. Sri Lanka have been in good nick and performing well and South Africa, though slightly depleted, is a strong team. It will be a challenging series, Yuvraj said. 

Yuvraj said he wanted to set the record straight this time in Sri Lanka as India had lost their previous two tournaments there. 

I have been among runs in Sri Lanka but my performance did not help the teams cause as we lost two series there, the left-handed batsman said. 

Harbhajan had a word of praise for Englands Monty Panesar. 

Monty has been rocking. I want him to rock more and more and keep the Khalsa flag flying high in world cricket. 

Meanwhile, after experimenting with unique training methods for three days, Team India players were back to the grind of a regular conditioning camp at the National Cricket Academy on Sunday. 

The players did some physical exercises in the morning session before undergoing fitness tests. 

In the afternoon, they practised with golf balls, hitting those hard with the stumps. Later, they also played a game of baseball. 

In the evening, the team had an indoor training session where they batted to improve their skills in defence. 

The Indian team had undergone training at the Pegasus Institute of Excellence on the outskirts of the city under Ian Frazer over three days. 

Harbhajan, Dhoni and Yuvraj said they liked the novel camp. It was a good experience and we learnt many things on getting mentally tougher. It was challenging and demanding on us. 

Coach Greg Chappell, currently on a vacation to the USA, will join the Indian squad on Friday.

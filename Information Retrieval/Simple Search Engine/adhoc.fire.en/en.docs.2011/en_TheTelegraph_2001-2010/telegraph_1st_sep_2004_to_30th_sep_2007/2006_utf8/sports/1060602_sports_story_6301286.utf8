The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Indian men held; eves rout Mongolia 

 Chess Olympiad

 Turin: World No. 2 Viswanathan 

 Anand settled for a draw for the sixth consecutive time 

 as Indian men were held 2-2 by Cuba in the 10th round of 

 the 37th Chess Olympiad here.

 Anand did not get any chances 

 against Bruzon Lazaro of Cuba and ended on equal footing 

 in the keenly-contested game.

 The Indian eves scored a 3-0 win 

 against Mongolia in the 10th round. GM Koneru Humpy had 

 the toughest challenge and she did not disappoint on the 

 top board. WGMs D. Harika and Swati Ghate also came up with 

 inspired performances on the remaining two boards to keep 

 alive Indias medal hopes. The win helped the women 

 surge to joint fifth spot. (PTI)

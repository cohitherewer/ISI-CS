Sydney: Australian pace bowler Stuart Clark will miss the ICC Champions Trophy in India after suffering a thigh injury playing club cricket last weekend. 

The 31-year-old underwent an MRI scan which showed a tear in the quadriceps of his left leg, meaning the New South Wales player could take no part in the one-day international tournament, Cricket Australia said in a statement on Wednesday. 

Australian team physiotherapist Alex Kountouris reviewed the scan and decided it was better for the bowler to miss the month-long India event, qualifiers of which start on Saturday. 

The decision was made for him to stay in Australia and undergo treatment to maximise his chances of a full recovery before the Ashes series, Kountouris told reporters, adding the injury was expected to take up to six weeks to heal. 

Australia host England in the first Ashes Test in Brisbane on November 23. 

Clark has played four Tests and 18 one-day Internationals for Australia. He was called up to replace Glenn McGrath in the March Test series against South Africa, taking 20 wickets at an average of 15.75. 

His place in the 14-man squad is likely to be taken by either Michael Kasprowicz, Shaun Tait or Jason Gillespie, with the announcement expected on Thursday morning.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Imtiaz Ahmed stumped by Fleming feat

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Chandigarh: At 78, former Pakistan 

 captain (and wicketkeeper) Imtiaz Ahmed is happy leading 

 a retired life in Lahore. Of course, he remains in touch 

 with the game hes a member of the Pakistan Cricket 

 Boards ad hoc committee but isnt exactly strong 

 on statistics. 

 What? (Stephen) Fleming 

 is going to create a world record? Captain in as many as 

 194 ODIs... Its difficult believing that, Ahmed 

 told The Telegraph over breakfast, Wednesday, 

 at the Mountview Hotel. 

Laughing, he added: Its also difficult believing he has been the captain for almost a decade... Thats simply not possible in these parts... In fact, most of the time, captains (in the region) are worried about keeping the job for the next series... New Zealand mein hi das saal koi kaptan rah sakta hai... 

Ahmed, who will be here for a few days more, felt Fleming must be really special. He said: I havent followed his career with any particular interest, but he does come through as being somebody in command. I should add that I like the way he bats... 

 Later in the day, Fleming wouldnt have disappointed 

 him in neighbouring Mohali.

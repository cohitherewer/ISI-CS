The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Ajit Agarkar plans a stint in England

 - Allrounder to explore possibilities of playing for a County or in one of the leagues 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

London: Had the national selectors been fair and not whimsical, Ajit Agarkar would have been in Antigua and not here, on Tuesday morning, waiting for wife Fatima and infant son Raj to arrive from Mumbai. 

Overlooked for the Test series in the West Indies, Agarkar (as also other ODI specialists ? Yalaka Venugopal Rao, Rudra Pratap Singh and Robin Uthappa) landed at Gatwick in the early hours. Ranjib Biswal, too, came on the same British Airways flight from Bridgetown. 

Team India got a 1-4 licking, but Agarkar stood out with his consistency: Two for 38, two for 25, two for 32, one for 24 and two for 44. Except in the fourth, he was given his quota in every match. 

Speaking on board the Boeing 777 service from the Barbados capital, Agarkar told The Telegraph that while he was disappointed, he never quite lost sleep over matters he couldnt control. 

The past eight years have seen me in and out a number of times? Im disappointed, but my selection or otherwise rests with others, the 28-year-old said, adding he would definitely play in England for the next couple of months. 

I will take a complete break for about a week and, then, explore possibilities of either playing for a County or in one of the leagues? Obviously, Ive got to establish contact with an agent? Im definitely going to play some form of cricket. 

The Team India allrounder, it may be recalled, had a short innings with Middlesex in the summer of 2004. He wont be required for national duty till the August-September tri-series in Sri Lanka. 

Looking back on the just-ended engagements in the West Indies, Agarkar remarked: That I got into rhythm straightaway made a big difference. My confidence, perhaps, would have been dented had I gone for runs in the first ODI (Kingston)? 

But why did the others struggle? 

Because they couldnt hit the right length? On slow wickets, the length is most important? Of course, experience does count? As Ive been saying, experience is the best teacher, he replied. 

Whichever the squad, Agarkar remains the only new-ball bowler to have toured the West Indies previously ? in 2002, under Sourav Ganguly. Incidentally, during the series which ended on Sunday, he became the seventh allrounder to score at least 1,000 runs and take 250 wickets. 

Thats cause for celebration. 

Rao, Rudra Pratap and Uthappa left for Mumbai by an afternoon flight. Biswal (a senior national selector), who was the manager in the first leg, was to leave by a later service after meeting his Manchester-based in-laws.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 5-wkt win for SA

Bloemfontein: A fourth-wicket stand of 121 between Boeta Dippenaar and J.P. Duminy helped South Africa overcome an early scare and eased them to a five-wicket victory over Zimbabwe in the first of three one-day Internationals on Friday (as reported in Saturdays Late City edition). 

The hosts, chasing a modest target of 202 for victory, crashed to 33 for three before experienced opener Dippenaar, in his 100th match, and left-hander Duminy, in just his sixth, repaired the damage in untroubled style. 

Duminy was stumped for 60 from just 70 balls with 48 runs still required for victory. 

Earlier, a determined half-century by opener Vusi Sibanda anchored a pedestrian Zimbabwean total of 201 for seven after captain Prosper Utseya had won the toss and chose to bat.

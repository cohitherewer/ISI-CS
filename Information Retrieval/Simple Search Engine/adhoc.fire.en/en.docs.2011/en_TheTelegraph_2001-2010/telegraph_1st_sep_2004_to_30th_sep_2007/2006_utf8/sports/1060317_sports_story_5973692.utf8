London: Middlesbrough withstood a pulsating fightback from AS Roma to reach the Uefa Cup quarter finals for the first time on Wednesday. 

Boro, 1-0 up from the first leg, doubled their advantage through Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink at the Olympic Stadium before two goals from Brazilian Mancini set up a thrilling finale. 

Roma, who had Philippe Mexes sent off in stoppage time, threw everything at the English side in the final 25 minutes but Boro held on to go through on away goals after a 1-2 defeat. 

It has to be the greatest night in the clubs history, Boro defender Gareth Southgate told Channel Five TV. Guts got us through. We knew they were a good side and they showed it. We knew we would have to score and we did. 

In another upset Romanias Rapid Bucharest also went through on away goals at the expense of former European champions Hamburg SV, despite a 1-3 defeat in Germany, while Sevilla put out Lille 2-1 on aggregate after a 2-0 home win. 

Since breaking the Serie A record for successive league wins last month Roma have faltered and the capital side appeared up against it when Dutch striker Hasselbaink headed Boro ahead on 32 minutes. 

Hasselbaink beat French defender Mexes to Stewart Downings left-wing cross and headed powerfully past Gianluca Curci into the far corner. 

The goal left Roma, who hit the bar early on through Cesare Bovo, needing three goals to turn around the tie and Mancini rifled in three minutes before half-time to give the hosts hope. 

Boro were indebted to Mark Schwarzer after the break, the keeper making superb stops to deny Mancini and Daniele De Rossi but he was beaten again on 65 minutes. 

Ray Parlour was penalised for impeding fellow substitute Stefano Okaka and Mancini sent Schwarzer the wrong way from the penalty spot. 

The match passed off without major incident following disturbances between rival fans the previous evening. At least three Middlesbrough supporters were stabbed during clashes late on Tuesday in central Rome. 

Striker Mugurel Bugas ninth goal in the Uefa Cup this season proved decisive for Rapid Bucharest who last progressed to this stage of a European competition in 1973. 

With the tie against Hamburg all-square, after well taken first-half goals from Benjamin Lauth and Bosnian international Sergei Barbarez had cancelled out Rapids 2-0 first-leg win, Buga struck six minutes after the break with a header. 

His goal left Hamburg needing two more to qualify for the quarter finals. Dutch international Rafael van der Vaart got one back just past the hour from Barbarezs pass but the Romanian side clung on despite sustained pressure. 

Victory eased the financial blow on Rapid who earlier on Thursday were told to pay $400,000 in taxes after failing to register $1.65 million worth of striker Florin Bratus move to Galatasaray in the clubs accounts. 

Goals from Frederic Kanoute and Luis Fabiano put Sevilla into the last eight in Europe for the first time. 

Lille, 1-0 up from the first leg, were dealt a huge blow when midfielder Mathieu Bodmer was sent off for elbowing on 26 minutes.

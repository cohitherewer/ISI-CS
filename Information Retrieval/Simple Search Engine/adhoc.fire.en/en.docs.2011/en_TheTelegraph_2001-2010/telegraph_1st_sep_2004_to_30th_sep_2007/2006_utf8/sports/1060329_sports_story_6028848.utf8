 - An opportunity wasted: Flintoff

New Delhi: For Team India captain Rahul Dravid, it was one of those off days for his batsmen. While he was ready to admit his team didnt play well, he also pointed out firmly that such things do not happen regularly with the Indians. 

To be honest, we did not play well and should get better, he said. At the same time, one should also realise that this has happened only for the second time in the last 16 matches. We did not have a good day in the middle, but two in 16 matches I believe is a good average, said the Team India captain. 

 We need to keep patience. We are a young side trying to find our feet. Some of our guys are inexperienced, we need to give them time. 

The Indian captain was also candid enough to admit that 203 was a small score to defend. We needed another 50 runs, he said. Even this 200 wouldnt have come, had not the lower order contributed. We definitely need to look into it. 

Dravid refused to take credit for the bowling changes he brought about to plot Englands fall. I just told them to keep the ball in line with the stumps. They bowled really well. Harbhajan was brilliant. In fact everyone contributed to the win ?? Gambhir took three catches, Kaif was superb, Yuvraj bowled well. I always say it is not just one player or one thing but a combination of factors. 

The timing of the power plays was one decision that Dravid said was difficult to take. When players like Pietersen and Flintoff are batting, it is very difficult to take such a decision. We only thought of delaying it a bit, but also knew we would have to take it anyway. 

Meanwhile, England captain Flintoff was upset that his plan did not click even after winning the toss. Our bowlers did a great job, but batsmen failed to keep up the momentum. There was nothing wrong with the technique we adopted to counter the Indian spinners. 

Different batsmen have different strengths. In one-day cricket, hitting through the line of the ball is not that risky if it is managed well, he said. It was an opportunity wasted. We will have to regroup. The one thing about this series is that there are six matches to go. 

We have to look at the areas where we have to improve and come back strongly. Probably we did not do well as we expected to. The bowlers bowled well, as they have done throughout. 

The England captain felt there was nothing much in the wicket. Of course, the new ball was harder to play, but that doesnt mean one cannot chase 204. We had a poor start. Otherwise we could have chased even 240-odd.

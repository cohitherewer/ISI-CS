 Time for Spain to make a mark

Essen: For a man about to play his 99th international and who is already the all-time leading scorer for his country and in the Champions League, there should be no need to question the pedigree of Spain captain Raul. 

Yet going into the World Cup second round clash with France on Tuesday, his 29th birthday, there remains the nagging feeling that the prolific striker still has something to prove after never quite delivering for Spain when it really matters. 

A match against France is the ideal opportunity for him to make an impact and help erase memories of their last competitive meeting in the Euro 2000 quarter final when Raul missed a last-minute penalty in a 1-2 defeat. 

He has scored 44 goals in 98 internationals and won the Champions League three times with Real Madrid but his tournament disappointments mirror his countrys. Both invariably look impressive in qualifying, rack up goals in friendlies and set off with high hopes every second summer. 

Yet Spain have failed to get past the quarter-finals in their last nine World Cups and though the Spanish have had a little more success in the European Championship they have earned a reputation as Europes great under-achievers. 

I obviously hope that it will be Zidanes last game. Hes a great player and has played his last game for his club and I hope that, for the good of Spain, tomorrow will be his last one for France, Raul said. 

Tuesdays game comes 22 years to the day since they lost the Euro 84 final to France. 

Raul and Cesc Fabregas will play Tuesday, coach Luis Aragones said. A coach has to look at small details that decide games and I want to make sure we control the game, Fabregas said. 

France steadily improved through the group phase and showed some incisive attacking, let down by wayward finishing, in the 2-0 win over Togo that secured second place behind Switzerland. 

Playmaker Zidane missed that match through suspension but should return to a five-man midfield behind sole striker Thierry Henry as they look to extend a five-match unbeaten run in competitive games against their neighbours. 

Were improving and I believe well continue to do so, said France coach Raymond Domenech. Its not now that we want to play the perfect match. Its in the final on July 9. 

The tie will be a test for Frances back four, facing a challenge from the likes of David Villa, Fernanod Torres and Raul.

 Indian women finish ninth

 WORLD CUP ATHLETICS

 Athens: Indian women, representing 

 Asia in the 4x400 metre relay event, settled for a wooden 

 spoon by finishing ninth in the 10th World Cup Athletics 

 here.

 The Asian team, which comprised 

 Indias Chitra Soman, Satti Geetha and Manjeet Kaur 

 and Japanese runner Asami Tanno clocked 3:38.85s and finished 

 last.

 The team could have bettered their 

 position by at least one place after Tanno began the race 

 and handed the baton to Chitra who passed it on to Geetha 

 at the eighth place. But Geetha failed to maintain the position 

 and even Manjeet could not make up for the loss in lane 

 three.

 Americas won the relay with a 

 timing of 3:19.84 sec.

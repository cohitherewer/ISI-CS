 Srinath named Match Referee 

 - Sri Lanka-South Africa tests

 Jawagal Srinath 

Dubai: Former India mediumpacer Jawagal Srinath will start his innings as ICC Match Referee in the two-match Test series between Sri Lanka and South Africa beginning later this month. 

[That Srinath would make his debut in the series was reported by The Telegraph on July 7.] 

The former-cricketer will officiate in the Test at the Sinhalese Sports Club starting on July 27 and then at the P. Saravanamuttu Stadium where the match begins on August 4. 

In preparation for his first assignment, Srinath spent the past week at Lords, venue of the first England-Pakistan Test, alongside ICC Chief Match Referee Ranjan Madugalle, watching how the former Sri Lanka captain did the job, an ICC release said Monday. 

Jawagal is the third new Match Referee Ive worked with after Chris Broad and Roshan Mahanama and what we are trying to do in each case is provide the new official with a proper induction into the role, as you would in any organisation, Madugalle said. 

The idea is that when he undertakes his first assignment he has an understanding of whats required. 

Srinath shadowed Madugalle through pre-series meetings with the England and Wales Cricket Board ? a ground inspection and meetings with the umpires, captains and officials of both teams. 

On match days, Srinath observed Madugalle as he ran through the daily routines, working with the umpires to ensure the Test match progressed smoothly. 

Talking about his new responsibility, Srinath said: I have had to learn pretty fast but Ranjan has been very helpful, going into detail about all the processes I have to be aware of, and this week has been a very good preparation for me. 

We have gone into the micro-details of the game, right from the pre-series rituals and meetings through to the actual conduct of the game, the forms that need to be filled in, the monitoring of umpires and players ? it all requires constant vigilance. 

 It was natural that, up until now, I had a players perspective but this past week has seen my approach shift and now my views are more rounded and neutral, as they should be in this role, he added. 

As India will be one of the teams participating in the tri-series that follows the Tests, Srinath will be replaced by Chris Broad, who will be in charge for the seven matches taking place between August 14 and 29. 

Indias K. Hariharan will stand in the three ODIs between Kenya and Bangladesh, now scheduled to take place on August 12, 13 and 15. Roshan Mahanama will be the Match Referee. (PTI)

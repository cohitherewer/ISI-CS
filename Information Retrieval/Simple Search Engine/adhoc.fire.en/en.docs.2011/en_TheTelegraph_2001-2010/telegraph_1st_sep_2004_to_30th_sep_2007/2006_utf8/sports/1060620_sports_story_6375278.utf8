Dortmund: Switzerland overcame a stiff challenge from World Cup debutants Togo on Monday before ending the African sides hopes with a battling 2-0 win. 

After suffering in ferociously hot conditions during their opening 0-0 draw with France, the Swiss still had to work hard with Alex Freis strike in the 16th minute and Tranquillo Barnettas 88th minute drive finally dividing the teams. 

The second goal means Switzerland only have to draw their final Group G clash with South Korea in Hanover on Friday to be sure of going through. 

Frei was not alone in breathing a large sigh of relief. Of course that was important, Frei told German TV. Our coach told us at halftime that we had to score a second and we did. The 2-0 victory is ideal. There are no easy teams. Togo were strong opponents, they have good players. 

Togo coach Otto Pfister said the superior Swiss finishing had made the difference. The Swiss didnt have a lot of chances. They just used their opportunities better than us. 

We cant be happy but the team is here to learn and I think they put on a good show. 

Togo, whose players had threatened on Sunday to boycott the match over a long-running internal pay dispute, seemed unhampered by the unorthodox build-up as the game finally got underway. 

Aside from Freis goal, there was little to distinguish the two teams during the first half with Switzerland enjoying plenty of possession but Togo looking the more dangerous on the break. 

Just as Switzerland were starting to look shaky, top scorer Frei came to his sides rescue once again, finishing off a well-worked move to claim his 26th international goal. Right back Ludovic Magnin pressed forward before crossing the ball to Barnetta who deftly flicked a first touch pass across the goalmouth for Frei to turn in. 

In the 35th minute, the Arsenal striker Emmanuel Adebayor was involved in the halfs most controversial moment when he attempted to swerve around Patrick Mueller in the penalty area before seeming to be caught by the Swiss defenders flailing leg. To Togos disgust, the referee ignored their penalty appeals. 

It was only when the second half got underway that Switzerland finally started to look worth their lead, with Barnetta, Frei and half-time substitute Hakan Yakin all going close shortly after the re-start. 

In the 64th minute Yakin again had an opportunity to double Switzerlands lead but his sizzling shot was well saved by Togo keeper Kossi Agassa. 

Barnetta finally made sure of Switzerlands win with two minutes left, latching on to a ball on the right of the Togo box and lashing in a low, accurate drive into the far corner.

 Pak have it easy

Colombo: Defending champions Pakistan began their U-19 World Cup campaign with an eight-wicket demolition of Uganda here on Monday. 

Pakistan, who won the trophy in Bangladesh in 2004, skittled out the lightweights for 74 before knocking off the runs in 12.2 overs. 

A workout like that could be seen as counter-productive in one sense because Pakistan barely had to break sweat, but coach Mansoor Rana said it was not a concern for the team. We have already prepared for the tournament when we played the West Indies in Pakistan, he said. 

We have chalked out the way we want to play already and we watched Bangladesh play New Zealand on Sunday, so we are ready for the challenge, he added. (AGENCIES)

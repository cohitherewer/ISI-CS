 Hansen sinks own world record

 Swimming

 Los Angeles: American Brendan 

 Hansen broke his own world record in the mens 200m 

 breaststroke at the US championships in Irvine on Saturday.

 It was the second world record 

 in four days for Hansen, who shattered his own mark in the 

 100m breaststroke on Tuesday.

 Hansen, a silver and bronze-medallist 

 at the Athens Olympics, easily won the US title in the 200, 

 storming home in two minutes, 8.74 seconds to smash his 

 old record of 2:09.04.

 Eric Shanteau was a distant second 

 in 2:11.38, followed by Olympian Scott Usher.

 The 200 is my baby, 

 said Hansen. Its been my event ever since I 

 was a little kid. I knew if I was really fast in the 100 

 that coming out here in the 200 I was going to be pretty 

 quick.

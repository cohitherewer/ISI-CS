 Kapur ready to lock horns with the best

 - PERTH GOLF 

 Shiv Kapur 

Perth: Globe-trotting Shiv Kapur is all geared up for the Johnnie Walker Classic at the Vines Resort and Country Club here as he gets ready to tee off for the fifth week in a row. Other Indians in this star-studded field include Jeev Milkha Singh and Gaurav Ghei. 

Jyoti Randhawa, tied second in the 2004 edition of this tournament, has decided to take a week off to prepare for Malaysian Open next week. This will also give him time to recover fully from the rib injury sustained in a bike accident in Qatar. 

Kapur, who missed the cut in Dubai last week, started off the New Year in the US where he took part in the Sony Open. He then spent three weeks in West Asia and now hes off to the other end of the globe, Australia. Kapur will next travel to Malaysia and South East for another week of action. 

Kapur, last years Asian Tour Rookie of the Year, is relishing his opening round where he will play alongside former US Masters winner Fred Couples and Australian Craig Parry. 

The winner of last Decembers season-ending Volvo Masters of Asia must however overcome a tendency of poor first rounds as his last three tournaments have seen him shooting two 75s and one 77. 

Ive had a bit of forced rest and Im feeling refreshed. The game feels good and I like the golf course which kinds of sets up my game, Kapur said. 

Im not going to think of past rounds. Just go out and try to play. Ive got a nice little pairing (with Couples and Parry) and well see how it goes. Its great. These are the guys that you watch on TV and grew up idolising them. Now you have a chance to play with them and learn and see how they manage their stuff as they are the top players in the world. 

This is still a learning experience for me, and Im getting into the bigger events and hope to compete in them, and hopefully win. 

Kapur is currently ninth on the Asian Tour Order of Merit. Home favourite Adam Scott will be on a dual mission when he starts the defence of the title. 

Scott, ranked 10th in the world, hopes to shoot his way into the history books by becoming the first player to successfully defend his title at the $2.3 million event and if he succeeds, it will also mean his first professional title on home soil. (PTI)

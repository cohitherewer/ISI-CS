The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Greg Chappell in demand in the US

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Kingston: Among the many Indian fans who are here for the first two ODIs is the Atlanta-based Nandu Vaid, who worked with Greg Chappell and Ian Frazer in 2004. 

Chappell and Frazer, the Team India coach and biomechanist (effectively assistant coach), respectively, had spent six weeks in the US two years ago and Atlanta was one port of call. 

It was a private (commercial) visit and Chappells presence did wonders, Vaid told The Telegraph on Saturday morning. Frazer returned a year later, but Chappell couldnt as hed got the India job. 

Vaid added: Our set-up is very keen to have Chappell back, even if its for a day, but that doesnt seem possible as long as hes the India coach... Lets see, something may emerge once his contract with the BCCI ends. 

Incidentally, a power struggle between the Indians (plus Pakistanis and Bangladeshis) and the West Indians is on to control cricket in the US. The West Indians dominate in New York, Los Angeles and Miami. The Asians call the shots just about everywhere else. 

The Asians are bound to get stronger once India and Pakistan begin playing in the US. Thats very much on the cards.

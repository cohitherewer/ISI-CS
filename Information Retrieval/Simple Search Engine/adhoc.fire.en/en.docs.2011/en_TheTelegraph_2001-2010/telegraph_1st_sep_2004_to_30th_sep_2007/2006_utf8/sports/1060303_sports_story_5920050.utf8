 Record submissions: ICC

Dubai: The International Cricket Council (ICC) on Thursday announced that it has received a record number of submissions from 15 member boards, including India, for its package of events from 2007 to 2015. 

India have also bid for hosting a womens World Cup, it said in a statement. 

The submissions, which had to be received by February 28, include five members seeking to host the ICC Champions Trophies and seven members targeting a potential Twenty20 event. 

ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed said this was an unprecedented response from the cricket world. 

This is the first time that we have run such a comprehensive submissions process and we have been delighted by the positive response from so many of our members, said Speed. 

We have been impressed by the quality of many of the bids and they will present the ICC board with a good range of options when it meets to review the scheduling and hosting of these events in March, Speed said.

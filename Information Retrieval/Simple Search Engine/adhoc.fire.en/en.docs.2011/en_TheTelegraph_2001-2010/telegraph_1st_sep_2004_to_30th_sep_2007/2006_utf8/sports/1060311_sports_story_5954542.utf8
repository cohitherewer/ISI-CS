 5 Indians make cut

Singapore: Jyoti Randhawa made a move upwards on the second day of the Singapore Masters golf tournament, as five of the seven Indians made the cut in the event. 

Randhawa shot a four-under 68 that took his total to two-under 142 for two days, good enough for tied 23rd after being 92nd after the first round. 

Shiv Kapur, after a fine three-under 33 for the front nine, faltered badly with a four-over 40 on the return to finish with 73 and was even for two days and tied for 48th while Gaurav Ghei (72), with one-over for two days, was tied 59th. 

Rahil Gangjee (68) with three birdies on the last three holes squeezed into the weekend as did Amandeep Johl (73) at one-over for 36 holes. 

Jeev Milkha Singh (77) shot a disastrous 10 at the par-5 second hole and put himself out of the meet. Also missing the cut was Harmeet Kahlon (73) at seven-over for two rounds. (Pti)

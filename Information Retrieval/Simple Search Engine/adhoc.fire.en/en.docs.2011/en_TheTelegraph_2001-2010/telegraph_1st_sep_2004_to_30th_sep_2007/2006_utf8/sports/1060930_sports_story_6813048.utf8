 Inzamam gesture enraged Hair, says report 

London: Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq had made a gesture to upset umpire Darrell Hair which resulted in his walking out of a meeting to explore ways to rescue the fourth Test against England on the fourth day at The Oval. 

The meeting had been convened by the Match Referee, Mike Procter, to rescue the match and reduce the damaging impact of one of the biggest controversies in the history of Test cricket. 

Hair was incensed by a gesture made towards him by the Pakistan captain, Inzamam-ul Haq. It is believed that attempts were made to persuade Hair to stay, but he departed with the words: I am leaving and he knows why, indicating Inzamam, according to a report in an English daily. 

The meeting took place despite the fact that the umpires had awarded the match to England after Pakistan had failed to meet their deadline to return to the field, protesting against charges of ball tampering for which Hair and Doctrove deducted five penalty runs from their score. 

But play could have been resumed the following day if a solution was found acceptable to both sides. 

The report said that when various possible solutions were explored, Inzamam said he had not been given a chance to speak to the umpires and Hair had labelled his side as cheats. 

Inzamam then made a waving gesture to which Hair took great exception and walked out. One explanation is that the Australian umpire felt the gesture was insulting to anyone who knew anything about Pakistan culture. (PTI)

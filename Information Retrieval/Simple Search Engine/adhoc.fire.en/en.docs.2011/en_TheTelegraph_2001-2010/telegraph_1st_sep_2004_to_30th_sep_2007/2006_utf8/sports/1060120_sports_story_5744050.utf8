 Chelsea proving money is not everything

 - Walcott latest to snub riches on offer at Stamford Bridge 

Matt Hughes

 Abramovich has failed to deliver a genuine icon 

When Roman Abramovich bought Chelsea in July 2003, David Dein, the Arsenal vice-chairman, remarked that the Russians tanks were parked outside Highbury, firing ?50 notes at them, yet Abramovichs soldiers of fortune have frequently failed to find target. No wonder Red Army was disbanded. 

Theo Walcott is the latest in a long line of players to have snubbed the riches on offer at Stamford Bridge, with Arsene Wenger set to reap the rewards of his telescopic eye for talent. This is further proof that Chelsea do not get everything their way. Abramovichs wealth enables him to secure most things he desires, from oil and gas, aeroplanes to the governorship of Chukotka, but footballers are harder to pin down. 

In the heady aftermath of the Russian revolution, Chelsea spent a breathtaking ? 101m on ten players in the space of six weeks without landing the men they most desired. Arsenal rejected a ? 50m bid for Thierry Henry, Christian Vieri priced himself out of a move from Inter Milan with his outrageous wage demands, while Samuel Eto opted to stay in Spain, moving to Barcelona in 2004. 

For all his spectacular outlay, Abramovich failed to deliver a genuine icon, a signature signing to rival Henry at Arsenal or David Beckham, who in the same summer swapped Manchester for Madrid. The most high-profile arrival was Juan Sebastian Veron, also booted out of Old Trafford, and everyone knows what happened to him. 

Over the past three years, the speed of spending has slowed, as first Peter Kenyon and then Jose Mourinho have wrestled control of transfer policy from under the influence of Pini Zahavi, the agent, but the setbacks have kept coming. Steven Gerrard has twice said yes, only to balk at the last minute, while Andriy Shevchenko and Adriano have thwarted Chelseas attempts to sign a genuinely world-class striker in each of the past two summers. 

When the champions are rejected by a 16-year-old school-leaver on ? 100-a-week, though, it is time to examine the root of the problem. 

Mourinho was widely mocked last summer for suggesting that he had the hardest job in the Barclays Premiership, but buying players for Chelsea is fraught with unique difficulties. As a result of the strength of their squad, the champions are inevitably drawn to top players from rival clubs who are unwilling even to enter a discussion, leading to the debacle that was the Ashley Cole tapping-up affair and repeated attempts to sign Shevchenko. 

The clubs board has discussed making a renewed bid for Henry this summer but held back, reasoning that Arsenal would never sanction his move across London. 

As Mourinho put it: Because of Chelseas squad level we want big players from good teams and they dont want to sell. They make it difficult, they ask for sometimes crazy prices, so its very difficult. 

Chelseas financial strength can be a weakness, with players and clubs holding them to ransom. Vieri pushed his luck too far by demanding ?120,000 a week, but others have proved more successful, with Marseilles receiving ?24 m for Didier Drogba and Lyons ?400,000 more than that for Michael Essien. 

The size of Chelseas squad also dissuades some players from signing and is the main reason why Walcott has chosen to continue his footballing education at Arsenal. 

Given the experiences of Scott Parker, who moved to Newcastle United to play regularly, and Glen Johnson and Shaun Wright-Phillips, who have gone stale through lack of matches in West London, it should come as no surprise that many ambitious youngsters are seeing the benefit of more immediate opportunities elsewhere. 

Not all players are daft enough to put the opportunity to make money ahead of their long-term career development.

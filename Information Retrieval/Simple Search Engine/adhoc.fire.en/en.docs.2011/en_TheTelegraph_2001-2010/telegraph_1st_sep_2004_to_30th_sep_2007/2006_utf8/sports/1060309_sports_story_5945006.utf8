 City court stays BCCI showcause on Dalmiya

OUR LEGAL REPORTER

Calcutta: The sixth judge of City Civil Court on Wednesday passed an interim order restraining the BCCI from giving effect to its showcause notice issued on February 27 against former president, Jagmohan Dalmiya. 

The judge, Prabir Kumar Sarkar, passed this order on a petition moved by Dalmiya challenging the validity of the showcause notice. The BCCI will not give effect to the said notification till the disposal of the case, the judge in his order said. 

Appearing for Dalmiya, Siddhartha Shankar Ray, Usha Nath Banerjee and Arindam Banerjee argued that the showcause notice issued by BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah was not sustainable as it was bad in law. 

The BCCI on February 21, asked Dalmiya to explain why he issued cheques for Rs 39.41 lakh when the balance in Pilcom (Pakistan-India-Lanka Committee) account was only Rs 17.67 lakh. The BCCI granted Dalmiya seven days for giving his explanation. Even though he gave his explanation on time, the BCCI on February 27 issued the showcause notice, the lawyer claimed. 

The lawyers argued that the BCCIs allegation against their client was malafide. The notice was issued only to malign him publicly, they claimed. The BCCI secretary said the matter rests with the court. 

Once I get the order, Ill refer it to our legal committee, said Shah.

 GFA formula to save Fransa juniors 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: The All India Football Federation (AIFF) may be struggling to rehabilitate the footballers of the disbanded Fransa club midway through the season, but the Goa Football Association (GFA) has already found a way to save the clubs junior players. 

Speaking to The Telegraph, GFA secretary Savio Messias said he would allow the Fransa under-18 footballers to play under a different club name in the second phase of the Goa junior league beginning next month. 

We dont want the players to suffer. Hence we thought it would be the best arrangement, he said. 

According to Messias, the coach of the Fransa junior team, Eban Mesquida has told the GFA that he and his wards are eager to continue in the league despite Fransa chairman Micky Pachecos decision to disband the side. 

In the first phase, the boys played with Fransa and finished sixth among eight teams, Messias said. 

In the second phase we may allow the team to play as Ex-Fransa Club or GFA XI. The association will take care of all expenses. Our primary aim is to help the footballers, he added. 

The GFA secretary said he would talk and pursue all other teams in the league to accept the arrangements. There could be some technical problems, but we hope to solve it. 

Asked why the GFA was not advising the AIFF to toe the similar line, Messias pointed out that the parent body, I am sure, would do what they feel best for the game. We are in no position to advise them.

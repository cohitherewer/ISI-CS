Indian Wells: World No. 1 Roger Federer demolished American James Blake 7-5, 6-3, 6-0 to win his third consecutive Pacific Life Open title on Sunday. 

The Swiss withstood a fast start from an inspired Blake in the first set, coming back from two breaks down to take charge. After breaking to lead 5-3 in the second set, Federer reeled off the next seven games as Blakes resistance crumbled. 

The 24-year-old Federer extended his 2006 record to 22-1, his sole loss coming against Spains Rafael Nadal in the Dubai final earlier this month. 

The Swiss is the first man to win the Indian Wells Masters Series tournament three consecutive years. 

Its special, Federer said. Obviously I like records once in a while. Im happy Ive made one here. He really got the better of me in the beginning, so I had to react and not panic. I did a good job there.

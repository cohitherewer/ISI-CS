 Draw takes Sasikiran to joint 3rd spot

Moscow: Grandmaster Krishnan Sasikiran managed a draw with former Russian champion Alexander Motylev to be joint third after the eighth and penultimate round of the Aeroflot International Open chess tournament here. 

Sasikiran gathered 5.5 points to be counted among the toppers in one of the strongest open events around. 

GM Kiril Georgiev of Bulgaria joined overnight leader Pavel Eljanov of Ukraine on top of the table with six points after scoring a thumping victory over Vladimir Akopian of Armenia. 

IM Prathamesh Mokal split point with Pogos Nakhapetiane of Russia to finish ninth after the final round in group B. 

IM Dinesh Kumar Sharma won his final round game but finished 36th after the tie-break was resolved. 

Young guns Parimarjan Negi and Abhijeet Gupta were quite impressive in the penultimate round of the A2 section. While Negi defeated GM Ara Minasian of Armenia, Abhijeet Gupta defeated GM Sergei Zagrebelny of Uzbekistan. 

Double GM norm aspirant Neelotpal Das suffered a setback, going down to David Arutinian of Armenia. 

The loss proved quite costly for Neelotpal as his final GM norm prospects suffered a decisive setback. In fact a draw would have kept him in contention for the final norm as he needed just two more draws to achieve the feat. 

Later in the day, Neelotpal said: I was not sure whether with a draw I will get a GM in the next round so I went all out. The funny thing is that I had a clear better position and I messed it up. (PTI)

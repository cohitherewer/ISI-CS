 Ronaldinho branded most valuable

Berlin: Brazil and Barcelona forward Ronaldinho is the most commercially valuable soccer player in the world, followed by England internationals David Beckham and Wayne Rooney, a study of brand value said on Thursday. Consultancy BBDO Germany estimated Ronaldinhos brand was worth 47 million euros ($56.4 million) followed by Beckhams at 44.9 million euros and Rooneys at 43.7 million euros. 

Two other Barcelona players, Cameroon striker Samuel Eto and Argentinas young forward Lionel Messi, completed the top five, both brands being worth just over 30 million euros. While Real Madrid midfielder Beckham still had the best-known face in soccer, Ronaldinhos comparative youth and recent achievements with Barcelona made him a more attractive marketing prospect, the consultancy said. 

Having just turned 26, the Brazilian is nearly five years younger than Beckham.

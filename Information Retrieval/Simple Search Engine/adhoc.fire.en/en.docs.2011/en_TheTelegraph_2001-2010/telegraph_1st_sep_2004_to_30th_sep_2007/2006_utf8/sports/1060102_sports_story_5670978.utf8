 The new year appears ripe with promise

 Last year rsquo;s Chelsea-Barcelona match at 

 Stamford Bridge was mouth watering

The Christmas programme produced a veritable feast of football and the new year promises more, which is good news after the sterile tactics which gripped many games earlier in the season. Anyone who watched Fulham against Aston Villa or Birmingham against Manchester United last Wednesday could not have helped but be entertained. Here is my pick of this years fixtures. 

Jan. 3: Arsenal vs United 

A game which not so long ago might have decided who won the league, now may not even decide who finishes runners-up. Yet it is still a huge game in terms of Champions League qualification and after their truncated European season, United dont need to be told that. It is just a shame that Chelseas emergence has coincided with both teams decline. Yes, Chelsea are an incredibly strong, resilient and consistent side but what a title race it would have been had United and Arsenal been at their best. 

Essentially, it is in midfield where both teams are not the force they once were. Only Ryan Giggs and Paul Scholes of Uniteds original Fab Four remain and both players are nearer the end of their careers than the start. As for Arsenal, it will take them a while to replace Patrick Vieira ? if indeed they ever can. Both clubs need to free themselves of their financial constraints as soon as possible if they are to catch up Chelsea and doing so this season is out of the question. 

Feb. 4: Chelsea vs Liverpool 

If anyone has managed to live with the all-conquering Chelsea side, its Liverpool, which is a testimony to the tactical nous of their Spanish manager Rafael Benitez. Whether the European champions are playing as well in a month as they are now is another matter. But for the time being, Steven Gerrard is flying, the team are defending superbly and theyre scoring more goals. 

A Liverpool win, I fancy, would have a negligible effect on the outcome of the Premiership, but might have significance if the clubs meet again in the Champions League. 

But Chelsea will want to win this one more than any other in their domestic programme. As for who is the more valuable player, Gerrard or Frank Lampard, I would opt narrowly for the Liverpudlian because of the greater range to his game. Sven-Goran Eriksson, the England coach, is fortunate to have both. Its how he deploys them which is the tricky bit. They cant both bomb on which is, of course, their strength. Gerrard is such a versatile player that should Eriksson choose another player for the holding role, he will always find a place somewhere in the team. He could even play on the right if David Beckham were not fit or below par as he has been in the last two major championships. 

Feb. 21: Chelsea vs Barcelona; Real vs Arsenal 

Talk about box-office matches. The Chelsea-Barcelona tie is particularly mouth-watering. I was lucky enough to attend this tie home and away last season and Im sure this one will match up to that. Barcelona are definitely the best footballing side in Europe, but defensively suspect, especially the goalkeeper, Victor Valdes. The machine-like Chelsea could grind them down again but they will have to take a lead to the Nou Camp, where they were outplayed last year, for the return leg. By the same token, Madrid will need to be ahead after the first leg to hold out against Arsenal at Highbury. The need for Arsenal to find some away form will never have been so great. 

Feb. 26: Carling Cup final 

The odds are on a repeat of last years FA Cup final and Manchester United would dearly love to avenge that one which they probably should never have lost. Its all of three years since they last won any silverware. But if the neutrals have their way, it will be Wigan they face in the final, not Arsenal. What a triumph it would be if Paul Jewells side, coming on top of his teams success so far in the Premiership, if they won the League Cup. And they havent done it by roughing sides up, even if Jason Roberts was fortunate not to be sent off against West Ham the other day. Theyve done it by playing attacking football and with bags of pace. 

May 7: Last day of the Premiership season 

Its difficult to say at this juncture which Premiership side is a Houdini in the making. One senses, though, that there might be something riding on Evertons final match of the season at home to West Bromwich Albion and Birminghams away to Bolton. Sunderland, away to Aston Villa, may well have already gone under by then. It will also be Arsenals last match at Highbury when the visitors will be their Carling Cup semi-final opponents Wigan. 

It should be quite an occasion. I always loved playing at Highbury, the pitch was always perfect. I always thought of the stadium as a precious antique. It will be sadly missed, but I can tell Gunners fans from personal experience at Leicester that, once you get to the new stadium, you soon realise it was a wise move. 

May 13: FA Cup final 

It would be nice to think it would be at the new Wembley, but its not imperative: the Millenium Stadium is a very fine substitute. I suppose it will be embarrassing if its not finished in time, but who knows, the England team might get the opportunity to christen it instead after winning the World Cup! I have great memories of the old stadium, it was particularly kind to me, and Im pleased the new stadium is at Wembley; the name is synonymous with English football. 

June 10: England vs Paraguay (World Cup) 

This is what the season for most fans has all been geared to. Never before has an England team gone into a major competition with so much expectation ? and that includes 1966. How can any Englishman not get excited about it? I just hope Michael Owen makes a quick recovery from his metatarsal injury because the rest of Svens first XI ? bar Ashley Cole ? are fit and flying at the moment. 

Whatever anyone may think of Erikssons ability as an international manager, they have to applaud him for insisting upon an early end to the domestic season so that the England players can prepare properly for what will almost certainly be the most important championship of their lives. Hitherto weve always shot ourselves in the foot and gone into tournaments with exhausted players. 

Hopefully, this time the world will learn what its like to face an England team playing the only way it knows ? with passion and pace.

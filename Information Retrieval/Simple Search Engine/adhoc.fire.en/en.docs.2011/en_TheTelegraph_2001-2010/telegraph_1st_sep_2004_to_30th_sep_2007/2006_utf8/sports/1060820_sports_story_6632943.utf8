 Hingis cruises past Kuznetsova

Montreal: Former world No. 1 Martina Hingis advanced to the semi-finals of the $1.34 million Rogers Cup on Friday, cruising past fourth-seeded Russian Svetlana Kuznetsova 7-6, 6-3 in their quarter final match. 

Hingis, the champion in 1999 and 2000, thrilled a capacity crowd at Uniprix Stadium by wearing down her younger opponent in the second set after recording a key break in the 12th game of the first set to get to a tie-breaker. 

The seventh-seeded Hingis then won the first set tie-breaker 7-4 and never looked back to earn a date in the semi-finals Saturday against Russian Anna Chakvetadze. 

I definitely played one of my best matches so far this season, Hingis said. 

Against Svetlana you have to or shell kill you. I knew I had to step it up from the last two nights of play and I felt a lot looser, nothing really to lose now, Hingis added. 

I dont want to blame anybody and make excuses that I lost because of the lights, but you could see how many balls I missed just because I couldnt see them, said Kuznetsova, the 2004 US Open champ. It was so frustrating. 

Its completely different at night. She played all her matches at night so I think it was a huge advantage to her. 

Chakvetadze moved into the semis earlier with a 7-6, 7-5 victory over Shahar Peer. 

Earlier on Friday, Dinara Safina shrugged off worrying news of a car crash involving her brother Marat Safin to rout Australian Nicole Pratt 6-1, 6-0. 

The Russian took only 48 minutes to win her match after discovering Safin had sustained minor injuries in an accident in Cincinnati. 

Its family, Safina said. If it was someone else, maybe you would not care so much and you just forget about it but its my brother. I was happy with how I played. 

Ninth seed Safina secured a meeting with Ana Ivanovic of Serbia amp; Montenegro, who put out Slovenian Katarina Srebotnik 6-4, 6-4. (Reuters)

 Windsor for Stakes 

 OUR TURF CORRESPONDENT

 Bangalore: Star of Windsor may be hard to beat in the 2,400m Stayers Trial Stakes, a terms race here on Saturday. The S. Ganapathy-trained horse, who showed his staying prowess when he decimated the opposition a fortnight ago over a similar trip in Mumbai, is maintaining his winning form. B. Prakash, who partners the five-year-old, may face some challenge from Perfect Mover.

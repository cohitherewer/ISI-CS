The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Sachin is still the best: Majid Khan

 - People who have nothing else to do after quitting, hang around? 

INDRANIL MAJUMDAR

Islamabad: He doesnt want to look back and reminisce. Cricket, to him, is a thing of the past. His priorities in life have changed, but Majid Mr Majestic Khan still evokes the same charisma that was his forte during those playing days. 

I dont remember the last match I saw? I dont even feel like switching on the television. I keep myself updated by reading newspapers, he told The Telegraph during a chat on Friday in his chamber at the Pakistan TV headquarters, where he is director (sports). 

I took up this office in 1983, the year I quit cricket. I dont look back, never turn nostalgic? My motto in life is to look forward. Theres no use thinking about the past. There is no point talking to me? Concentrate on the new generation and their brand of cricket, Majid, a strong disciplinarian and a fitness fanatic even at the age of 61, remarked. 

I am in a different profession to which I have to devote much of my time. Its only the people who have nothing to do after quitting who hang around? They still want to stay in the thick of things and enjoy the limelight. 

Son Bazid has already played Tests for Pakistan. Doesnt he advice him on his career? Only if he wants, retorted the veteran of 63 Tests, who has 3931 runs with eight centuries at an average of 38.92. 

The media shy former Pakistan captain, best known for his grace and fluency as opener, has also been chief executive of the Pakistan Cricket Board between 1996 and 1999. More recently, he was on the Asia XI selection panel for the Afro-Asia Cup. Can he do justice to such assignments after not watching matches? 

I dont think selection of such teams is ever a problem, he says. You simply have to refer to the statistics? Anyone can do it. Choosing the Asia XI or World XI is no big deal. Who do you think is the best wicketkeeper in the world? Adam Gilchrist? And the best fast bowler? Glenn McGrath. You dont have to dwell much, he explains. 

The tough job is selecting the national team. After picking the players from the circuit, you have to look up to the players at the first class level?The ones who can make it big, say in the next ten years? Those who have the temperament to survive the rigours of international cricket. 

This is where the Australian selectors have been most successful. They know when to replace an old player with a new one? That is why they are the best, he said. 

Majid ? born in Ludhiana, son of Jahangir Khan who played four Tests for India between 1932 and 1936 and cousin of Imran ? doesnt want to compare cricketers of different generations. You cant compare players of different eras because conditions change, format and playing style change. It is injustice to players and teams. 

He has his own formula for evaluating a player. 

A player should be judged great by his contemporary when he is at the peak of his career. Unfortunately, that is never done. Its only when a player is down the hill that one realises his greatness? That is not proper evaluation. 

How does he rate Sachin Tendulkar on current form? Sachin is still the best?If he doesnt get runs on a few occasions what is the problem? He has been performing for so many years, he can afford to not score sometimes, said Majid. 

While commenting that Shoaib Akhtar has an awkward action, he doesnt want to credit Bob Woolmer for making Pakistan into a formidable unit. The players deserve it all. 

Majid remains forthright in his views and ideas.

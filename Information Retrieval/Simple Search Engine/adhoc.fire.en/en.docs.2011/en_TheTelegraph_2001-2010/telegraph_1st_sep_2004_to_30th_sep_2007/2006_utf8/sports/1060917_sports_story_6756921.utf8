The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 No plans to fight Pawar: Amin

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Kuala Lumpur: Sharad Pawar appears set to be at the helm of the Board of Control for Cricket in India for a further two years. The opposition, headed by Jagmohan Dalmiya, still hasnt made any move to muster support ahead of the September 27-28 AGM at the CCI in Mumbai. 

Moreover, Gujarat Cricket Association president Narhari Amin, a senior Congressman and former deputy chief minister, has denied hes going to oppose Pawar. I dont know why this talk has begun... I dont have plans to fight Mr Pawar, he told The Telegraph on Saturday. 

Amin, whose name has been doing the rounds as a possible challenger (has to be somebody from the West itself), is here to watch the tri-series. 

After the constitutional amendments, if Pawar gets re-elected this year seems a certainty right now he will remain in power till September 2008.

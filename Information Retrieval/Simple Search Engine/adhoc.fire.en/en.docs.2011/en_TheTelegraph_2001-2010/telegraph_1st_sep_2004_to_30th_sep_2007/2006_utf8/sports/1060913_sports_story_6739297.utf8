The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 MATCH HIGHLIGHTS

 The Kinrara Academy Oval at Puchong in Kuala Lumpur became 

 the 161st venue to host an ODI match, while Malaysia became 

 the 19th country to host an ODI. 

 The 137-run stand between Chris Gayle and S. Chanderpaul 

 was the first 100-plus stand conceded by Australia since 

 the 101 put on between English openers Marcus Trescothick 

 and Andy Strauss at Leeds on July 7, 2005. 

 The last time the West Indian openers managed to 

 put on a 100-plus stand against a good opposition was when 

 the same pair put on 193 against South Africa in Johanneburg, 

 on Feb. 4, 2004. 

 The partnership was also the only second 100-plus stand 

 by the Caribbean openers against the Aussies after the 116 

 run stand between Gayle and Wavell Hinds at St Georges 

 on June 1, 2003. 

 This was Chanderpauls highest score against the Aussies, 

 bettering the 80 he made in 127 balls in Mohali during the 

 1996 World Cup on March 14, 1996. 

 This was Australias fourth ODI win in a row 

 and their 12th in the last 16 matches since January 26, 

 2006. 

 This was the West Indies second loss in the last 

 13 matches since March 4, 2006. During this period the team 

 has won 10 and one match was a no-result.

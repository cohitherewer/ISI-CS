The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Power may come good on last day 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Pure Valour and Supreme Power may fight out the issue in the 1,200m Madras Race Club Cup, the main event on Thursday, the concluding meeting of the winter season.

 However, their recent clash, in the Metropolitan, points to the winning chances of Supreme Power, a Robin Corner trained horse who will be ridden by C.Alford.

 The Tug Of War Cup, a Class II event, may see Ciraja coming good. The seven-year-old had a troubled passage in his last outing, and he still finished a bottled-up third behind Way To The Stars.

 Ganga Bose, Satluj and Aiischa are the frontrunners for the 1,200m So Amazing Cup.Read as: Sl. nos, last 4 runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:

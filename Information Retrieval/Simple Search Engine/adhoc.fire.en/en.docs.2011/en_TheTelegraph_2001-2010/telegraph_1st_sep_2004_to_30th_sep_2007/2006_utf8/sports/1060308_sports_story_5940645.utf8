London: Manchester United fought back to beat an unfortunate Wigan Athletic 2-1 thanks to a stoppage time own goal by Pascal Chimbonda in the Premier League on Monday. 

The win took United back above Liverpool into second place with 57 points from 27 games although they trail leaders Chelsea by 15 points, albeit with a game in hand. Wigan stay 10th. 

Last months League Cup finalists were meeting for the third time this season but Wigan gave a far better performance than they had in a heavy defeat at the Millennium Stadium last month. 

Sprightly Wigan had taken the lead through Paul Scharner after a goalmouth scramble just before the hour but United levelled 14 minutes later through Cristiano Ronaldo. 

Wigan were desperately unlucky not to take something from the game as Chimbonda turned the ball into his own net after Louis Sahas shot came back off the bar and hit the full back. 

I dont think we have had a harder game away from home this season, United manager Alex Ferguson said. They (Wigan) were brilliant. Weve had a bit of luck. 

Dejected Wigan manager Paul Jewell added: We have pushed Man United ? second in the league ? right to the end but the best teams always get the luckiest. 

Wigan had been outplayed in their first major final when United destroyed them 0-4 to lift the League Cup. They also lost 0-4 in the league at Old Trafford. 

It was a different story at the JJB Stadium, though, as they dominated possession from the start. 

Gary Teale, Jason Roberts and Graham Kavanagh all came close with long-range efforts in the first half but Henri Camara was nearest 10 minutes before the break when his left foot snap shot flew just wide. 

United looked more dangerous after the break and England forward Wayne Rooney missed a glorious chance when he headed over the bar from a Gary Neville cross. 

Wigan took the lead when Scharner fired home from close range after Ryan Giggs had twice blocked the ball on the line from Arjen De Zeeuws header and a Roberts shot. 

United introduced substitute Ruud van Nistelrooy for Park Ji-Sung and the Dutchman almost immediately changed the game as his miscued shot fell into the path of Ronaldo. (REUTERS)

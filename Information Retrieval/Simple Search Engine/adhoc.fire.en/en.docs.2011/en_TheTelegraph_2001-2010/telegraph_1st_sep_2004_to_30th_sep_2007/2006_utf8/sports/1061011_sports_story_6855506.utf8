 We havent forgiven Hair: Shaharyar

Karachi: Former Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Shaharyar Khan on Tuesday said that Australian umpire Darrell Hair has still not been forgiven for his role in the infamous Oval Test. 

Shaharyar, who resigned last week, said his replacement Dr Nasim Ashraf would continue to press the ICC to launch an inquiry into Hairs role in the debacle. 

Its a wrong impression that we have forgiven Hair. Instead, our lawyer has prepared a paper and the new chairman has also vowed to further the case, Shaharyar said. 

Shaharyar said Pakistan have a strong case in calling for an inquiry into Hairs behaviour. 

After Pakistan agreed to take the field, Hairs conduct was unbecoming of an international official and we have quoted all rules and regulations in our demand for an inquiry against Hair, he said. 

Hair was further embarrassed by a leaked e-mail to an ICC official in which he offered to resign in exchange for a $500,000 pay-off. (AFP)

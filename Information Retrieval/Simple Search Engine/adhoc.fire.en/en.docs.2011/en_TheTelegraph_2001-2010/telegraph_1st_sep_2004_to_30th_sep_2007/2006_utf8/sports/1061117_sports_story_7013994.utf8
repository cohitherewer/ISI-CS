 Coach pleads not guilty

San Francisco: Trevor Graham, the track coach who sparked the BALCO doping scandal, pleaded not guilty on Thursday to lying about his role in and his knowledge of steroid distribution. 

Graham, who was making his first appearance in a federal court since his indictment this month, was freed on a $25,000 bond. 

The Jamaican-born coach started the investigation into the BALCO laboratory in California when he sent anonymously a syrine of the previously unknown steroid THG (tetrahydrogestrinone) to the US Anti-Doping Agency. 

As a result of a subsequent federal investigation several leading athletes, including former world 100 metres record holder Tim Montgomery, have been banned for doping.

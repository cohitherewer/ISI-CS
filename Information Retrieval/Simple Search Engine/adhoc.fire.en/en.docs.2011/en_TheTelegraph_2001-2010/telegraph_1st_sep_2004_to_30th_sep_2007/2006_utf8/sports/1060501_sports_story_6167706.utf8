 What A Babe wins title for Rajendra 

 HONKY DORY

 Rajendra

 Imtiaz Sait-trained heavily fancied ward, Oh What A Babe, not only delivered the goods but the filly also helped jockey C.Rajendra win the title from Mallesh Narredu at the Mumbai races on Sunday. The two jockeys were tied at the score of 37 points after the penultimate race in the eight-event card.

 The title contest between the two had turned equally exciting last winter when Rajendra claimed the title by a similar margin.

 Trainers championship was no contest for Sait who won 32 races while his nearest rival, Pesi Shroff, ended the season with an impressive tally of 24 winners. Shroff had taken up training last winter soon after hanging up his riding boots.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Dutt not to contest against Mukherjee

 - A setback for Dalmiya as known backer vouches support for police commissioner 

A STAFF REPORTER

 MUKHERJEE

Calcutta: In a surprising turn of events, Biswanath Dutt on Friday decided not to contest for the post of CAB president. The reason: he does not want to be pitted against someone as respected as city police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee. 

On hearing that a known Jagmohan Dalmiya backer switched camps by openly saying that he would support Mukherjee for the top post, a disgusted Dutt told The Telegraph: My answer will be no, if somebody respected like police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee fights for the CAB presidents post. I am not contesting any election against him as he is a perfect gentleman. 

Dutt also added that anyone can say anything, but he does not want to be a part of the mud-slinging game and will step aside in case he has to fight an election with Mukherjee. He is not any Tom, Dick and Harry, but city police chief, I have full respect for him. 

I agreed to become CAB president after Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee and former state chief minister Siddhartha Shankar Ray requested me, but I had three pre-conditions, which I dont want to divulge, Dutt said. According to Dutt, he was requested by Ray to step into the breach created by Dalmiyas resignation till the scheduled annual general meeting in July. 

 DUTT

Two days after Dalmiyas resignation, the sudden U-turn of a strong Dalmiya backer has brought in a new twist to the tale. 

The association is above any individual and to save the CAB, we have decided to support Mr Mukherjee, said the Dalmiya backer, claiming that there were others who are with him. 

We want to fight neither the state government nor the BCCI... And so, in the best interest of the game and the CAB, we have decided this, said the gentleman, refusing to name those who are with him. 

The man in the line of fire Dalmiya remained at ease even after hearing about the U-turn by one of his loyalists. 

Believe me I am not aware of it. And even if I knew it, I wouldnt have made any comment on the issue, Dalmiya said.

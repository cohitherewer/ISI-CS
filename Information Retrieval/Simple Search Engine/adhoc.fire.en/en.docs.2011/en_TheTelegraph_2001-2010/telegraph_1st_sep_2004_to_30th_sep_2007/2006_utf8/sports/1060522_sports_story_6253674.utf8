Madrid: Barcelona striker Samuel Eto gave the credit to his teammates after he finished the Primera Liga season as top scorer with 26 goals. 

The Cameroon international scored the opener in his sides 1-3 away defeat against Athletic Bilbao on Saturday, in their delayed final game, to finish one ahead of Valencias David Villa. 

It has been a team effort although only one person gets the award. We have worked hard all season and have got our just rewards, Eto told reporters after the game. 

It was a weakened side that ran out in San Mames with international players called up for the World Cup barred from playing by Fifa. Ronaldinho, Deco, Carles Puyol and Rafael Marquez were all missing. 

The game was of little consequence for either side with Barca already crowned league champions and Bilbao safe from relegation. 

Also, the match came three days after Barca had beaten Arsenal 2-1 in the Champions League final in Paris to earn their second European Cup. 

The European and Spanish champions finished their league campaign on 82 points, 12 clear of second-placed Real Madrid. 

After a season spent fighting against relegation Bilbao climbed to 12th.

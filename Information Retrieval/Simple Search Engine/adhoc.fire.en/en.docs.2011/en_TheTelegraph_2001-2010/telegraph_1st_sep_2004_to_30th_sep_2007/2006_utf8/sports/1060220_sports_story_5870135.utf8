 Yuvraj: Dhoni should have got MoM, MoS awards 

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Karachi: Yuvraj Singh, still limping with a bandaged thigh because of the hamstring strain, did not wait for the team bus and left earlier for the hotel. His sixth hundred remained the talking point at the National Stadium. 

The Man of the Match and Man of the Series awards were well deserved. He was also the MoS against South Africa. His batting has come a long way, taken a whole new plane. He is always been a special talent. Last few months he has taken himself to a new level, Rahul Dravid heaped praise on Yuvraj. 

The hamstring injury is a bit of worry ahead of the home series versus England, but the Indian captain was hopeful. 

He is receiving treatment. May be we will know in the next 48 hours about his condition, he informed. 

Its difficult to pinpoint any one particular incident for the turnaround in Yuvrajs batting. He has become a regular in the Test squad now. That has been a factor. He also sees himself as a senior member of the side and that has given him new responsibility. A better belonging and added responsibility has given him a new lease of life, Dravid reasoned. 

Yuvraj felt Mahendra Singh Dhonis presence at the other end helped him. 

With Dhoni around, I didnt panic. I concentrated on rotating the strike as I knew Dhoni would go for the big ones. Its satisfying that I have been able to carry on the good work from the Test series. 

In Yuvrajs opinion, Dhoni is the Man of the Match and Series. Yuvraj felt his mental strength has made the difference. I am mentally much stronger now. I have been around for five years. The more you play, the better you get. 

Dravid also praised Mahendra Singh Dhonis knock. 

It was exceptional. His strike rate is amazing. He has added zing to the side. Hes able to bat with authority at any position. He along with Irfan Pathan gives us more options. 

Dravid was happy with teammates attitude. 

The professionalism boys showed today was great. They never relaxed. The effort put in was great. To restrict Pakistan to 286 on this sort of a batting wicket was superb. I was always confident the batting would click. Sreesanth also bowled exceptionally. 

Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq was absent during the post-match press conference. However, later at the team hotel, he said: I dont want to offer any excuses? We simply lost it. We failed in all departments of the game.

Ahmedabad: South African legend Barry Richards feels that the controversial quota system shouldnt come in the way while selecting the best for the country. 

I cant really comment on whether the quota system should stay or be done away with since I am not aware of what is happening But what I firmly believe is that, whatever the circumstances, the best should play. Players should be chosen only on merit, Richards told The Telegraph on Tuesday. 

The quota system have been a matter of much debate, specially since the appointment of Ashwell Prince as South Africas first coloured captain in Sri Lanka after regular captain Graeme Smith and vice-captain Jacques Kallis pulled out because of injuries. 

The move even prompted Dr Ali Bacher to say that the time had come to do away with the quota system. Princes appointment indicates we are approaching the end of a period where there was affirmative action and quotas, which was necessary, Dr Bacher had said. 

According to the government regulations, a minimum of four coloured players should be included in any provincial or national side. However, for compelling reasons like injuries, the number might be reduced to three. 

The Champions Trophy squad includes five such players Herschelle Gibbs, Makhaya Ntini, Robin Peterson, Charl Langeveldt and Loots Bosman. 

Has the policy hampered the progress of the team? If you look at the statistics, you will see that no one has got any undue advantage because of it. Rather, guys like Ntini, Gibbs and Prince have laid the foundation for the next generation of black players, said a senior member of the touring party. 

There are extraordinary opportunities available for black sportsmen and women. They know that if they have the focus and potential, they can make it to the top, he added. 

Not many will also agree that this has and will drive promising young white players out of the country. Youve got to see the bonding that has been generated. Princes elevation shows that only the best will survive and the country will benefit. 

One thing is, however, clear. The quota system is here to stay and will not be removed in a hurry.

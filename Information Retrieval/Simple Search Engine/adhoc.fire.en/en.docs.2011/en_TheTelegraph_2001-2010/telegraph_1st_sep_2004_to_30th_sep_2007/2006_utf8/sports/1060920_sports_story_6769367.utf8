Calcutta: It was quite clear from East Bengals display that they didnt want any slump in the midway. And that showed in the scoreline reading 1-0 in East Bengals favour in their match against Railway FC in the Sahara CFL Premier Division in their own backyard on Tuesday. Ashim Biswas struck the winner in the 57th minute. 

East Bengals game plan was to play on the ground and not try anything aerial. But sometimes you have go out of your way to snatch victory, and East Bengal did exactly that as the all-important goal came via a Biswas header. 

In the 57th minute, Saumik Deys corner was deflected off a defender to find him again. Deys centre was headed home by Biswas. I had told the boys to try and keep the ball on the ground and they followed my strategy, coach Carlos Roberto Pereira da Silva said . 

Syed Rahim Nabi, operating from the right, had a good day in office as most of the chances were created from the right and made the opposition defenders task harder. Biswas, playing alongside Freddy Mascarenhas, also did pretty well up front. The Nabi-Biswas combination could have enhanced the margin in the 63rd minute, but Nabis shot could only found the horizontal. 

However, the 1-0 scoreline doesnt tell the full story. East Bengal, playing without their Brazilian striker Marcio Fernandes Thomas, kept piling pressure on the Railwaymen, but had to wait till the 57th minute to assure three points. By virtue of this win, leaders East Bengal stay on top with 19 points from 8 matches. 

A one-minute silence was observed before the match for Sudip Chatterjee, who passed away on Monday.

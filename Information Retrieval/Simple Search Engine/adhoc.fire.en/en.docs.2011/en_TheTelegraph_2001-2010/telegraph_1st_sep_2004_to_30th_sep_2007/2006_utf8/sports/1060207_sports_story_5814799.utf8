 Dravid defends his bowlers

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Peshawar: Rahul Dravid was banking on the positives while admitting that this was not a nice way to lose the opening one-dayer of the five-match series. 

Anything could have happened. It was a good, exciting match? Some things are always out of your control, the Indian captain said. 

There were a few positives in the match like the way we batted. But we should have done a little better. We didnt get as many runs as we would have liked. We should have got a few more runs in death overs. A couple of good catches led to our dismissals towards the end. 

But these sort of things happen. These are lessons we can learn, he explained. 

Dravid did not wish to blame his bowlers for the defeat. 

Its very hard to be critical of the bowlers. The conditions were pretty tough for them. The boundary ropes were small. There was lot of gap between the ropes and the billboards. 

He also defended his ploy of using Irfan Pathans full quota of overs at the start. We have other guys who can bowl in the death. Pathan really bowled well at the start. 

Sachin Tendulkar century seems to have come as a big relief for the team. It was a good innings. If he bats 100/120 balls, he is always likely to get a hundred. It was great to see him back in form. 

Bob Woolmer too felt at one stage that Pakistan would end up chasing 380. That said, we fielded and bowled beautifully in the last ten overs. We took a couple of wonderful catches and bowled extremely tight. In the end, we did very well to bowl India out before the 50 overs. 

Woolmer added that although his side had become adept at big chases, he would be happier if they werent in that position. 

If we have to chase big totals, we must learn how to chase. We have done pretty well in the last two years, but the problem is that we are conceding too many runs, and that is something we will have to look at.

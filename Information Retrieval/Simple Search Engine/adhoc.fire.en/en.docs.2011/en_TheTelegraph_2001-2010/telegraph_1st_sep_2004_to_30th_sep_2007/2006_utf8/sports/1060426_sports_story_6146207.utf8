 Ashraful axed

 Ashraful axed

 Fatullah: Bangladesh have 

 axed middle-order batsman Mohammad Ashraful from the squad 

 for the second one-day International against Australia on 

 Wednesday.

 Alok Kapali will replace Ashraful, 

 who scored five from 23 balls in the first ODI, for the 

 contest in Fatullah.

 He (Ashraful) is a little 

 bit out of form at the moment and his confidence is also 

 down, so we feel he should have a break, Bangladesh 

 coach Dav Whatmore said.

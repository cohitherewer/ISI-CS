 Alvito doesnt want to waste his last chance 

New Delhi: Alvito DCunha wants to ply his trade abroad after the National Football League (NFL) gets over. The East Bengal medio, who once turned down an offer from South Africas Manning Rangers Club, could soon be donning the colours of a Malaysian or a Thai club. 

Speaking to The Telegraph from Mumbai, DCunha said his agent has been negotiating with Malaysias Penang FC and ASEAN Cup finalists BEC Tero Sasana of Thailand. 

Once the NFL is over, I am likely to appear for trials in early June. My chances of playing for either of the two clubs are quite bright, he said. I have always wanted to play abroad. I am playing my best football at the moment? This is my last chance to fulfil my dream. 

The 27-year-old from Goa said he wanted to take the South African offer last time, but it did not materialise dud to various reasons. I did not get the release order from the club. This time I hope to get it from East Bengal. 

DCunha said he was open to the idea of spending the entire season outside the country. Nothings been finalised, but like Bhaichung (Bhutia), I may even sign a contract for a few months before returning to play club football in India. 

DCunha felt all top Indian footballers should try their luck abroad. Our footballers, I believe, have the requisite skill and technique to play in competitive leagues abroad. 

Asked why he particularly chose Malaysia and Thailand, the East Bengal star said: Malaysia and Thailand have a good football structure. The league is highly competitive and there are some good players. I think I have a lot to learn from these leagues.

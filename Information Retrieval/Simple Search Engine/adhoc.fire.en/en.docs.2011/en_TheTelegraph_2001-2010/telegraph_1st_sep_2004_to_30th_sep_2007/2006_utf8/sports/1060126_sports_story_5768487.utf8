The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Flashing Star has best credentials 

 OUR TURF CORRESPONDENT

 Bangalore: The Poonawalla Bangalore Derby on Thursday has a very open look and the field appears to be a minefield. The Derby is contested by horses who have either lost form or who havent done anything significant to back their claim. The only horse who has proved to be on the upgrade is Faraz Arshad-trained Refreshing. The daughter of Be Fresh has progressed from being a modest performer in handicap races to being a classic performer. Her victory in the Oaks, over a mile and half trip, was smashing. She may go to the start as a favourite to win the coveted trophy. 

 Flashing Star has been a consistent performer without translating the hope and hype into winning performance in the coveted events. The S.Ganapathy-ward won the Grade 2 Breeders Produce Stakes at Mumbai last year in February, but the son of Razeen has belied the expectations by finishing second best on most occasions. Most professionals, however, feel that Flashing Star deserves one final chance. 

 Jockey Prakash, too, is optimistic that the turn has come for Flashing Star.

 S. Padmanabhan trained Powerthrust ran third in the Kingfisher Derby but since then has been plagued with one problem or the other. He ran third over a mile and quarter trip and though there are not many takers for him, the trainer is quite optimistic that his ward would prove everyone wrong. The horse may be peaking at the right time and I am quite happy with his condition, said the trainer.

 Arturo finished close to Aristotle in the Calcutta Derby, but he has not done well here. Still, he deserves respect on his Calcutta performance. All said and done, Flashing Star and Refreshing may decided the outcome of the Derby but the former seems to have a thick edge.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Festival of racing from today 

 PRAVESH GUPTA

 Mumbai: The two-day festival of racing begins at the Mahalaxmi racecourse on Saturday. It is going to be pure entertainment like dance, music food and sport. said Vivek Jain, chairman, RWITC. If seasoned racegoers are going to remain tuned to the 17 events during the weekend, casual visitors may eye a host of prizes, including two special ones ? a Chevrolet Optra 1.6 LS car and an Opel Corsa 1.66 special edition which could be won through investment in jackpot pools. Saturdays card is lengthier than Sundays but the weekend is all about Derby which is sure to draw 20,000-odd visitors.

 All 17 events on the cards have managed to attract sponsors and their record contribution, in excess of Rs 75 lakh, means sponsorship has not dried up in this sport. The UB Group alone will be contributing Rs 45 lakh towards the Derby pool which promises a whopping winners prize of about Rs 84 lakh.

 There are 11 runners in the Derby field and the likes of Mysticals, Holding Courts, Romantic Liaisons and Aristotles are flexing their muscles. 

 However, in the past, Indian Derby has demolished many a reputed name. Its going to be a real test of speed and stamina on Sunday.

 Saturdays card, on the other hand, has its own charm and there will be tough competition in the 1,400m Breeders Produce Stakes which offers a total stake of about Rs 21 lakh, including the winners share of nearly Rs 13 lakh. 

 But trainer S. Ganapathy seems to have a vice-like grip over the prized event with two of his most forward youngsters ? Flaming Glory and Diabolical ? having already done enough to start as favourites. But the slated trip may favour the Glory, a Placerville-Stately Home filly who will be partnered by the stable jockey B. Prakash.

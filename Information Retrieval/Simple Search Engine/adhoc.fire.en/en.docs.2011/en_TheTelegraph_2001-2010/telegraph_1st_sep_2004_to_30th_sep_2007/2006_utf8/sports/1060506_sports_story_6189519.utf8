 Mahindra thrash Md. Sp. 5-0 

Margao: Even the appointment of a new coach failed to bring any change in fortune for Mohammedan Sporting as they were thrashed 0-5 by current leaders Mahindra United in the National Football League for ONGC Cup at the Fatodara on Friday. 

Subhas Bhowmick thus suffered three defeats in a row since he took over the beleaguered club with Mohammed Habib relinquishing the post due to health reasons. 

With the win, Mahindra moved closer to the maiden title having bagged 32 points after their Round XIV match. Mohammedan Sporting, on the other hand, stare at relegation with 14 points from 15 matches. Bhowmicks side are just three points ahead of bottom-placed Salgaocar, who have played two games less than Mohammedan Sportings. East Bengal are placed second with 28 points off 15 outings. 

Former India captain S. Venkatesh opened the floodgates in the first-half injury time. Then, after the breather, there was simply no stopping Mahindra who routed the opponents through goals from Yusif Yakubu (53), Venkatesh (67), Rouf Khan (74) and K. Anees (84). (Agencies)

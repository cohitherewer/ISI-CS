The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Mukherjee agrees to be on CAB panel

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: City police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee has formally accepted the invitation from CAB president Jagmohan Dalmiya to head the cricket infrastructure development committee of the association, after a meeting on Saturday. I had few queries regarding the post which were clarified and I accepted the proposal today. It will be quite an interesting job, Mukherjee said. 

Mukherjees meeting with Dalmiya, the former BCCI president, at Eden Gardens was for more than two hours. Basically we discussed about the development of the game and how it should be done, he said. 

It was also been learnt that Dalmiya will be the ex-officio member of the committee while two former CAB secretaries Chitrak Mitra and Prasanta Gayen will be the two members of the committee.

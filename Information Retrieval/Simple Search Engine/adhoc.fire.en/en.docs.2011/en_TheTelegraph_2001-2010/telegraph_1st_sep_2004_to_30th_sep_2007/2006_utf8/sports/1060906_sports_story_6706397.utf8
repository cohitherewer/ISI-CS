 Dalmiya moves high court

OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

Calcutta: Former BCCI president Jagmohan Dalmiya on Tuesday filed an appeal before the Calcutta high court challenging an order by the city civil court chief judge, P. K. Sarkar, who had dismissed a plea last week. 

In his plea, Dalmiya had sought an order from the city civil court judge directing the BCCI to furnish legible documents so that he could reply to the showcause notice served on him. 

The BCCI had alleged financial irregularities against Dalmiya during his tenure as president and directed him to appear before the disciplinary committee in Chennai. In his appeal, Dalmiya had stated that the documents provided by the BCCI were illegible, thus denying him the opportunity to reply to the showcause. 

The appeal is likely to be heard by the Calcutta High Court on Wednesday.

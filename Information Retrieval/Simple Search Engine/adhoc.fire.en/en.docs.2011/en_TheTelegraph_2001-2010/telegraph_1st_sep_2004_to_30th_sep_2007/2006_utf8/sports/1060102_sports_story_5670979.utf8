 Curse of broken metatarsal

 - 4 years ago we fretted over Beckham? Now its Owen

 Owens injury may be fatal to England 

Until a few years ago, metatarsal was a word known only to those in the medical profession, but now it has become all too prominent in the lexicons of England football fans. 

A couple of months before the 2002 World Cup, David Beckham broke a metatarsal bone in his foot when playing for Manchester United against Deportivo La Coru?a. 

Beckham has always been a trend-setter and suddenly everybody was doing it. A fortnight later, Gary Neville also broke a metatarsal and missed the World Cup. Beckham recovered, but later admitted that he may have rushed himself back too soon, and awareness of the injury could have been a factor when he pulled out of a challenge in Englands quarter final match against Brazil in Shizuoka. 

Brazil equalised through Rivaldo from the ensuing counter-attack and went on to the win the game. 

In Euro 2004, another metatarsal injury changed Englands fortunes. 

They were leading Portugal 1-0 in the quarter final in Lisbon when, 24 minutes into the game, Wayne Rooney challenged for a ball and pulled up, having broken his fifth metatarsal. 

Englands performance dipped and Portugal came back to win on penalties after a 2-2 draw. Arsenal defender Ashley Cole is sidelined with the same injury and now Owen has broken the same bone as Rooney did. 

Coach Sven-G?ran Eriksson will be hoping the curse of the metatarsal will not ruin another tournament for England, this summers World Cup. 

The normal rehabilitation for a metatarsal injury is eight-12 weeks. Should this be the case with Owen, he would only miss one England match, a friendly on March 1, and be back to full fitness by the time the tournament starts in June. 

But Rooney took 14 weeks between his injury and playing his next game and the nightmare scenario for England would be if Owen suffered complications. This is what happened to Neville in 2002. He injured his foot on April 24 and did not return until September 21, an absence of five months. 

Fans will need little reminding how injuries have often cursed England in big tournaments. 

Steven Gerrard missed the 2002 tournament with a groin injury. At the World Cup in 1990, Bryan Robson injured his Achilles in a group match against Holland and, four years earlier, injured his shoulder in a group game. 

He played in Englands second match wearing a protective harness but was replaced early. In the 1982 World Cup, Kevin Keegan and Trevor Brooking missed the first-round group stage.

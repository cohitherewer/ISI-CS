 Lees turn to complain of too much cricket

 - I will play the Champions Trophy only if I am fit enough at that time 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: Australian speedster Brett Lee believes that too much of cricket in the last few months has left him without any energy and it can be a serious hindrance towards his participation in the Champions Trophy in India in October. 

Lee, who was in the capital on a promotional campaign, felt the time has come to balance the hectic schedule and give a serious thought to the whole process. 

Of late, we are playing a lot of cricket. We have to be careful about it. I would like to compare my body to a petrol tank, Lee said. 

Its been on fumes in the last few months. We have been really playing too much of cricket these days. I am really looking forward to go back home now. 

In fact, the Aussie fast bowler was not sure if he would be available for the Champions Trophy in October. I would love to play it because thats the only trophy we havent won. But, then, I will play if I am fit enough to play at that time. Frankly, I love coming to the sub-continent. 

Lee said he was aware of the fact that Australian campaign in the Champions Trophy might end less than a week before the start of the Ashes series. To us, Ashes is more important than anything else. We had the hold over it for 18 long years. We are very keen to win it back, he said. 

Lee, however, denied that the Aussies were taking the Champions Trophy lightly and might be without their top players. We are equally serious about the tournament in India. We always want to look at the next game on hand. For us, the Champions Trophy is the next event. Hopefully we can win it. 

Lee said he would be getting married to girlfriend Elizabeth Kemp on June 3 and was looking forward to a nearly five-month break from the game. Its time to switch off from all cricket. I am on a holiday here and want to enjoy the next five months. 

Lee, who wore a sherwani for a while during the press conference, said he was not averse to being clad in Indian attire for his marriage. 

Lee holds his former skipper Steve Waugh in high esteem, but did not agree with his suggestion that Australians were soft towards England players in the Ashes and that cost the series. 

I know a plenty of quotes are being floating around. But thats not true. I dont think all these things made any difference. I played my cricket with controlled aggression and in the right spirit. 

Lee sounded disappointed that Australia and New Zealand missed out on the 2011 World Cup, but said he might realise the dream of playing the World Cup at home in 2015. Age cannot be a factor, he said. Why do you rule out players like Tendulkar, Warne or McGrath because of age. Their strength has not reduced one bit. All they need is to be fully fit. 

 Asked his opinion on Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Lee said 

 : He must be a unique batsman. I hear a lot of sixes 

 are being hit around when he is there in the middle.

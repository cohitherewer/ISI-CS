 DSA elections going the CAB way

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: After CAB, it is now turn of the Delhi Soccer Association (DSA) elections to become totally politicalised. And the man pulling strings from behind is no other than the AIFF president Priya Ranjan Das Munshi himself. 

Only a few days ago, Das Munshi was on record saying he was against government interference into sporting bodies. On Thursday, in an apparent bid to save his own group of people in the DSA from losing, Das Munshi asked former Delhi Pradesh Congress president Subhas Chopra to contest the DSA elections, scheduled on August 20. 

Chopra has never been into Delhi football in the last 20 years, but this time has signed the required papers to attend the elections AGM on behalf on Shakti Club, an insignificant lower division side in the local league. 

While Chopra, a high profile local politician, said he was yet to make up his mind whether to contest for the post of president, DSA secretary N. K. Bhatia said: Yes, Subhasji will attend the meeting as the Shakti Club representative. The AIFF president has asked him to do so. We need the support of the politicians to improve the game in the capital. 

Chopra, according to DSA sources, has been hand-picked by Das Munshi in an attempt to stop former DSA president Umesh Sood, a known Das Munshi-baiter and a likely candidate for the top post again, from winning. 

A DSA member complained that the government institutions, which are members of the DSA, are already being pressurised to tow the government line. 

Das Munshi was unavailable for comment.

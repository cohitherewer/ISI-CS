The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 - Duleep tie vs Central 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: East Zone are likely to go in with three mediumpacers in their Duleep Trophy opener against Central Zone that begins in Gwalior on Thursday. The greenish look of the wicket has prompted captain Sourav Ganguly and coach Paras Mhambrey to take the decision. 

The pitch looks green and hard, and so we plan to keep Ranadeb (Bose), (Asok) Dinda and (Debashish) Mohanty in the XI. If needed, Sourav, too, can take the responsibility of the fourth seamer, Mhambrey told The Telegraph over phone on Wednesday. 

Mhambrey was not taking their opponents, comprising Jai Prakash Yadav and Murali Kartik among others, lightly. 

They have a good side, but we are confident of a good start to the season, he said. 

According to Mhambrey, Sourashish Lahiri is expected to be the only spinner in the team. 

Arindam Das is likely to be left out. Subhamoy Das may open the innings with Shiv Sundar Das. 

Likely XI: Shiv Sundar Das, Subhamoy Das, Avishek Jhunjhunwala, Rohan Gavaskar, Sourav Ganguly, Deep Dasgupta, Laxmi Ratan Shukla, Sourashish Lahiri, Asok Dinda, Ranadeb Bose, Debashish Mohanty.

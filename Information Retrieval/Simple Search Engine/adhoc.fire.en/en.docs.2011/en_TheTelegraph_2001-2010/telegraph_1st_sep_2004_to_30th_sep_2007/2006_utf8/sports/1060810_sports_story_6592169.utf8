Gothenburg: World and Olympic champion Yelena Isinbayeva successfully began her quest for the only major title she is missing by qualifying for the pole vault final at the European Championships on Wednesday. 

Isinbayeva, who suffered a rare defeat in the run up to the championships when she lost to Polands Monika Pyrek in Stockholm last month, cleared the qualifying height of 4.40 metres in her second attempt. 

I had a soft pole on my first try, the Russian said. On the second I changed and it was okay. Otherwise all is okay. The key thing is just to keep my shape. 

Pyrek and defending champion Svetlana Feofanova both went over 4.40 at the first time of asking and could give the world record holder a run for her money in Saturdays final. 

Portugals newly-crowned 100 metres champion Francis Obikwelu made it through to the second round of the 200 as he attempts to become the first man to complete a European sprint double since 1978. 

Obikwelu, who won Tuesdays 100m final in a championship record of 9.99 seconds, barely broke sweat as he eased to victory in his heat in 20.78. 

Medal rival Ronald Pognon of France pulled out of the event with a thigh injury. 

European record holder Simon Vroemen won a slow heat of the 3,000m steeplechase in 8:29.62 to go through to Fridays final. 

Defending champion Antonio David Jimenez of Spain led home the other heat in 8:24.12. 

A Spanish medal sweep could be on the cards with bronze medallist from 2002 behind Jimenez and Vroemen, Jose Luis Blanco, and Cesar Perez also qualifying. 

Two-time hammer world champion Ivan Tikhon of Belarus qualified for Fridays final with a best throw of 77.21m. 

Finlands Olli-Pekka Karjalainen was best in qualifying with 79.00. Karsten Kobs of Germany was the only other man over the automatic qualifying distance on 77.50, which the 1999 world champion beat by two centimetres. 

Meanwhile on Tuesday, Francis Obikwelu retained his European 100m title on Tuesday with victory in 9.99 seconds. 

The Portuguese Olympic silver medallist recovered from the slowest start in the field to set the fastest time in Europe this year. Russian Andrey Yepishin was second in 10.10 with Slovenian Matic Osovnikar third in 10.14. 

Now I have my own 100m European gold medal, said Obikwelu, who was awarded the 2002 title after Briton Dwain Chambers was stripped of the gold after admitting to doping in that year. 

Chambers, who lost his title after admitting to having taken the designer steroid THG (tetrahyrogestrinone) in 2002, had a disappointing run and finished seventh in 10.24. 

Heptathlon queen Carolina Kluft might have preferred a different script but still thrilled her fans by retaining her title. The Swedes victory in the combined event was made easier by the withdrawal of her greatest rival Eunice Barber after two of the seven disciplines on Monday. Kluft, who loves a challenge, said she was sad after the Frenchwoman pulled out while in the lead because of a sore groin. 

Kluft sealed victory with a total of 6.740 points. Standing next to her on the podium were Dutchwoman Karin Ruckstuhl, who settled for silver, a huge 317 points back on 6.423 points, and German Lili Schwarzkopf, who finished a further three points adrift to win the bronze.

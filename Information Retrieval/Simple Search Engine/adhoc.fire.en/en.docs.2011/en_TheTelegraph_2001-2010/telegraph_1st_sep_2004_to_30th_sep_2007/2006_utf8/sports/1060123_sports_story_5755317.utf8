The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 No flaw in Singh, says Holding 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Faisalabad: Rudra Pratap Singh just fell one wicket short of five on Test debut, against Pakistan, but is bound to feel better once he knows Michael Holdings opinion of him. 

For, speaking to The Telegraph, the legendary West Indian said: I didnt detect any flaw in Singh... Hes young, hes ambitious and only needs to gain experience... I wouldnt ask him to change anything... Hes comfortable with his action and follow-through... Let him be the way he is... 

Despite being the pick of the five bowlers on Saturday, Singh was introduced rather late on Day-II. Quite sensibly, he declined to comment when somebody sought his reaction to Rahul Dravids intriguing move. 

Singh finished with four for 89 and insisted he concentrated on his own bowling rather than worrying about the reputation of the Inzamam-ul Haqs. He wasnt aware that the Iqbal Stadium is where Kapil Dev also played his first Test. 

The iconic Kapil, though, must have made a note of Singhs debut.

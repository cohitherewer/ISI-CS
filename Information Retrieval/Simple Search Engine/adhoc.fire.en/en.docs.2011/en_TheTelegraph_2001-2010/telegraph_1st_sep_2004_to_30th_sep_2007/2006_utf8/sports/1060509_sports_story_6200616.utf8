 Windies take 3-0 lead

Georgetown: Impressive bowling from Fidel Edwards, as well as a dominant batting performance, paved the way for West Indies to complete an 82-run win in the fourth one-day International against Zimbabwe at the Bourda Oval. 

Edwards snared three wickets for 42 runs as Zimbabwe, chasing 334 for victory, were restricted to 251 for seven to hand West Indies a 3-0 lead. 

Zimbabwe never had a chance once Edwards removed opening batsmen Piet Rinke and Terrence Duffin for ducks in the space of four balls in the first over. 

Elton Chigumbura and Vusimuzi Sibanda took the opportunity to score half-centuries that were the backbone of the visitors innings before Edwards and Tino Best, respectively, removed them. 

Chigumbra hit four fours and three sixes for his 60.

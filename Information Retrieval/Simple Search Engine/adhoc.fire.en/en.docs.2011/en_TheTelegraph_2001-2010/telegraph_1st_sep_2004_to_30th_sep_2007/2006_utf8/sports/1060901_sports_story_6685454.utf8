Bangalore: Indias preparations for next years World Cup have already begun and every aspect of the game is being discussed in detail, vice-captain Virender Sehwag said here on Thursday. 

We are discussing planning, how to play in different match situations, when we should take risk and when we should not take risk and also the role of each player, Sehwag said. 

The Delhi batsman also said the team had been training keeping in mind the World Cup in March-April next year and not just the tournaments on hand. 

We are not just preparing for the tri-series (in Malaysia next month also involving Australia and the West Indies). We are preparing for the next eight months. We are training and practising keeping in mind the World Cup, said Sehwag, here for Team Indias unique rolling camp. 

On the ongoing camp, Sehwag said captain Rahul Dravid and coach Greg Chappell had discussions with each of the players himself, Ajit Agarkar, Irfan Pathan, Mohammed Kaif and Yuvraj, and asked them about their goals, what they thought about the team and how the overall performance could be improved in both versions of the game. 

Its important to take ideas from everybody If everybody is involved, it helps, the vice-captain said. 

Many a time, only the captain, vice-captain and the coach hold discussions. Other players also have good ideas. When ideas come out, it helps the team. 

According to Sehwag, while the previous camps focused on conditioning and mental toughness, the current one is a camp for ideas, which would be put together and tried out at two practice matches slated in Chennai on September 8 and 9 prior to the squad leaves for Malaysia. 

We will see the results in the practice games. I am sure it will be helpful, he felt. 

On the use of perched-up bowling machines at the camp here, Sehwag indicated it was aimed at facing the likes of Glenn McGrath and Steve Harmison better. 

Meanwhile, former Team India physio Andrew Leipus on Thursday dismissed any doubts over Sachin Tendulkars fitness, saying the batsman makes himself available for selection only when he is completely sure of his fitness, adds a report from Jaipur. 

 quot;Tendulkar has shown that he can recover from injuries and those who doubt his fitness even now must realise that he plays only when he is 100 per cent fit. Tendulkar has amazing power of recovering, quot; said Leipus, who is here to give his inputs on fitness infrastructure for the under-construction cricket academy. (PTI)

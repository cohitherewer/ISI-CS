 United reject Reals Nistelrooy bid

Manchester: Manchester United has rejected a bid from Spains Real Madrid to sign striker Ruud van Nistelrooy, the English club said on Wednesday. 

We have received a bid for Ruud van Nistelrooy from Real Madrid, which we have refused, Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson told the clubs website. As it stands, Ruud van Nistelrooy remains a Manchester United player. 

Ferguson said last week that the Dutch international had asked to leave United and that there was interest from Real Madrid and Bayern Munich. 

Intense rumours out of Spain on Tuesday night suggested Van Nistelrooy was due in the capital for a medical on Wednesday before completing a big-money move to the Bernabeu. The Primera Liga side blamed the gaffe to a computer error.

 Shot couldve easily gone into stands: Maxi

 - Pekerman promises improved performance against Germany 

Leipzig: An Argentina midfielder who at the start of the tournament said he did not see himself as a goalscorer struck a fabulous winner against Mexico to send his team into the World Cup quarter-finals on Saturday. 

Maxi Rodriguez blasted a looping left-footed volley from outside the box eight minutes into extra time to give Argentina a 2-1 victory and take his tally to three goals in four matches at these finals and becoming his countrys top scorer. 

It could have gone into the stands just as easily as it went into the net, Rodriguez said. 

But it went into the goal and thats the way those kind of goals happen, the 25-year-old told a news conference after being presented with the Man-of-the-Match award. 

We tried getting to goal in whatever way possible, trying to play with the ball on the ground was getting complicated, with centres too, and then we got the goal from outside the box, Rodriguez said. 

Rodriguez, who plays for Atletico Madrid, said at the start of the World Cup: I see myself as a right-sided midfielder who gets up into the box, not a goalscorer as they sometimes call me in Spain. 

On Saturday he added: Its not my thing. That we have to leave to Hernan (Crespo), Javi (Javier Saviola), I think they are the real goalscorers. 

But it was Rodriguezs strike, which could be a candidate for goal of the tournament, that gave Argentina the edge in the scoreline to avoid being taken to penalties by Mexico. 

Rodriguez scored twice when Argentina demolished Serbia amp; Montenegro 6-0 in their second group game eight days ago which secured their place in the second round. 

Meanwhile, coach Jose Pekerman promised an improved team when they play Germany in the World Cup quarter-finals in Berlin on Friday. 

 When you progress you meet complicated rivals. Were going to get stronger because we achieved what we wanted, Pekerman said after Argentinas 2-1 win after extra time over Mexico in the second round on Saturday night. 

We will be able to improve as in another match one starts from zero and we believe we have the means to do so, Pekerman told the post-match news conference. 

The physical response was very good and the team gained strength from the (attacking) options. With Argentina the possibility of scoring is always latent, added Pekerman whose team had only three days rest after their last group game, a 0-0 draw with Netherlands on Wednesday. 

Pekerman pointed to the need for Argentina to improve their game control, having been overrun at times in midfield and cut off from their attack by a Mexico side that improved markedly after a disappointing group stage. 

 When we were at our best we werent able to score, with the substitutions we scored but then we didnt manage to control the ball. Thats something we must improve on. We should have settled the match more clearly, Pekerman said. 

Pekerman replied to criticism of Argentinas lack of control by pointing to Mexicos fine performance in an evenly balanced match by saying: A World Cup is not a bed of roses, all kinds of things happen. 

Mexican coach Ricardo La Volpe and his players said they had really felt this World Cup finals was their best opportunity yet for glory at the highest level but their chance had been scuppered by a moment of inspiration. 

This team wanted to go further and we had what it takes to do that, said Mexico goalkeeper Oswaldo Sanchez. The game was always going to be decided by a mistake or a wonder goal, and thats what happened. 

La Volpe, who is from Argentina but ended his playing days as a goalkeeper in Mexico, said his side had had a chance to make history in Germany. 

Once again, though, we did not achieve what we came to do, which was to reach the quarter-finals at least, he told reporters. 

I am very proud, however, of the way we played and the group that we have created, he added.We will continue our work Im sure and many of the players will still be around for the finals in 2010.

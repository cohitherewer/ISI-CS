 Italian GP was rigged, says Alonso

Monza: Defending world champion Fernando Alonso has said he is confident that the honesty of his Renault team would pay off in the end in what he alleged is a rigged title battle against Ferrari and Michael Schumacher. 

And not only me, said Alonso when asked by Spanish TV if he felt the FIA was helping the seven-time champion. 

Everybody here thinks the same, and the only thing that encourages me is the support I am getting from everybody. I feel shame. Im embarrassed by this sport. This is probably the most embarrassing moment in modern sporting history. 

Renaults official statement after the race quoted Alonso as saying: We have three rounds to go and we will get stronger and stronger with new developments for the car, the tyres and the engine. 

But the verdict this weekend is simple. The race was decided off the track. 

He told Italian TV: I think we are strong and we are the favourites. Were still ahead by two points. Lets not forget it. There are many people who want to decide the outcome of the championship differently, but in the end honest people will win. 

Its not just an unlucky race. It was a bit rigged from the start with an incredible decision and then the engine went: these things happen. 

 These decisions will not determine the championship, 

 Alonso said. I think we will be superior in the final 

 three races of the season. I think the tile will be ours, 

 but the shame will still be there. (PTI)

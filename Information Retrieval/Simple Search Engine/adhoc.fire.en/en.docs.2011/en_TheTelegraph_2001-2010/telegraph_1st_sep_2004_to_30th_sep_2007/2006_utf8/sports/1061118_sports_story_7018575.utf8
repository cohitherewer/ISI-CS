New Delhi: Mohammedan Sporting kept their hopes alive in the Durand Cup when they defeated Assam Rifles 2-0 in the Group A pre-quarter final match at the Ambedkar Stadium here on Friday. 

It was a fluent and convincing victory, but in the end might prove to be futile one as Air India are placed better in the three-team group to make the quarter finals. 

While Mohammedan Sporting have ended with three points, Air India, who also have three points, are yet to play Assam Rifles. All the Mumbai side need now is a draw to qualify from this group. 

Against Air India, defensive lapses let down Mohammedan. On Friday, the Calcutta side looked a more organized lot. Veteran Debjit Ghosh was drafted back in the team, which did a world of good to the defence. It not only withstood the pressure, but also kept their speedy rivals on check. 

Mohammedan Sportings best time came in the first 25 minutes of the match when they picked up both the goals. Midfielder Surojit Roy, who did a fine job against Air India, was once again the pick of the lot with some intelligent wing play. 

Apart from his eye-catching skills, he looked totally dedicated to the cause with his hard work. No wonder, he had a hand behind both the goals. 

The first goal came in the 10th minute when Roy picked up a cross from the left to give it a try at the goal. The shot missed the target by a whisker as it hit the crosspiece to drop into the box. Raman Vijayan slammed in the rebound. 

Roy again played a major role in Harvinder Singh scoring the second goal. He ran down the flank to send in a cross and the former Punjab striker was very much in place to make full use of it. 

In the other match of the day, Border Security Force (BSF) edged Tata Football Academy (TFA) 1-0. Sarabjit Singh scored the goal.

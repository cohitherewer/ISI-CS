Stuttgart: Oliver Kahn never got the World Cup winners medal he desired. 

The talismanic German goalie announced his retirement from international soccer after Germanys 3-1 win over Portugal in the third-place play-off on Saturday, ending one chapter of a stellar career in which he won just about everything else. 

I always said I absolutely wanted to be the world champion. Unfortunately, I only made it to runner-up four years ago, Kahn said. 

The 37-year-old said it would be utopian to think he could fill the gap in his career record in the 2010 edition. 

Im still young but no longer the youngest, he said, dismissing his chances of emulating Italys Dino Zoff, who won the trophy at 40. 

Times have changed. You need to be realistic and find a sensible moment to stop. 

Kahn, now only backup in Germanys goal, got within two minutes of keeping a final clean sheet against Portugal. 

After 15 minutes, he did well to stop a close-range effort by Pauleta and, in the second half, diverted a long-range drive by Deco. 

He also twice thwarted Cristiano Ronaldo before he was beaten in the 88th by Nuno Gomes diving header. 

After the final whistle, Kahn went to the stands and threw his gloves into the crowd, then led a slow procession around the stadium to greet the ecstatic fans. 

It was one of the most emotional, if not the most emotional moment that I can remember. You can hardly wish for a more beautiful final game, Kahn said. 

Coach Juergen Klinsmann decided to play Kahn against Portugal after consulting his No.1 Jens Lehmann. 

Kahn, playing his 86th cap, was also leading the side again because Michael Ballack missed the game with a knee injury.

 President says sorry to Ronaldo

Konigstein: Brazil president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has apologised to striker Ronaldo for asking whether the player was fat during a video-conference with the national team on Thursday. 

Ronaldos website said he had received a letter from the President stating that he did not intend any offence with the comment and he continued to be a fan of the player. 

The 2002 World Cups leading scorer, who said on Friday that Lula had been badly influenced by the media, added that he wanted an end to the controversy. 

All Brazilians need to be together to support our team, he said in a statement. The letter from the President was very good and showed that he understood what I wanted to say. Not everything you hear about us is true, he added. As far as Im concerned, this episode is finished. 

Ronaldo added that he had recovered from the sinus problem which caused him to miss training on Thursday. 

During Thursdays video conference with the team from Brasilia, Lula touched on a sore point when he asked if Ronaldo was fat or not.

Istanbul: Felipe Massa of Ferrari won the Turkish Grand Prix Sunday from pole position, his first Formula One victory in his 67th race. 

Its like a dream come true, he said, openly choking back tears after an emotional victory. Its just amazing, just looking back at everything I did in my life to get here, said the 25-year-old. Im here. Its a fantastic day for me. 

While the young Brazilian raced to the chequered flag from pole position, Renaults world champion Alonso and Schumacher were locked in a thrilling no-holds-barred battle for second place. 

The title contenders were nose to tail over the closing laps, with seven-time champion Schumacher doing his best to force a way past and the 25-year-old Spaniard repelling every effort. 

Alonso finished just inches ahead of Schumacher, and 5.5 seconds behind Massa. 

 Second place stretched Alonsos 

 overall lead to 12 points with four races remaining. 

However Ferrari slashed Renaults lead in the constructors championship to a mere two points. Renault now have 160 and Ferrari 158. 

Thank you boys, thank you, shouted Massa, punching the air in delight at a result that he could barely have expected when he and undisputed team No. 1 Schumacher had lined up together on the front row. 

Alonso was happy with second, but unhappy about not winning. 

Im very happy in a way, but not too happy because we were not able to win, he said. Felipe was impossible to catch. Well just need to do something for the next race. 

 Schumacher, meanwhile, paid tribute to his young teammate. Congratulations to Felipe who did a superb job. There was quite a gap and he was consistent and drove superbly. Thats what is good about our team someone might not have had a good weekend and the other one makes up for it. It was a nice fight towards the end. 

Briton Jenson Button, a first-time winner like Massa at the previous race in Hungary, finished fourth for Honda with McLarens Pedro de la Rosa fifth. 

Italian Giancarlo Fisichella was sixth for Renault with Toyotas Ralf Schumacher, Michaels younger brother, seventh and Brazilian Rubens Barrichello eighth for Honda. 

Schumachers hopes of a 90th career win were effectively scuppered by the intervention of the safety car on lap 14 with Massa leading and the German in second place and Alonso further back in third. 

A first-lap collision put paid to the hopes of McLarens Kimi Raikkonen, winner from pole position of last years inaugural race at the Istanbul Park circuit.

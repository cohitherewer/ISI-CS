The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Bad day for India

Bremen: Indian men failed to recreate their Melbourne magic against Singapore as they lost 2-3 in their third match of the first division league match at the World Table Tennis Championships here on Wednesday. 

It was a disappointing day for the womens team also as they lost their fourth successive match of the championship division, going down 0-3 to Belarus on Wednesday night. 

Achantha Sharath Kamal launched Indias campaign in style with a 4-11, 13-11, 15-13, 11-9, win over Li Cai Xiao. 

An in-form Yang Zi snatched back the advantage from India as he thrashed Soumyadeep Roy 11-9, 11-8, 11-2 and levelled the score. 

National champion Subhajit Saha gave a superb show of his skills, beating Tien Hoe Clarence 11-2, 11-7, 11-4. 

The tie moved to the decider but Soumyadeep could offer only a feeble resistance before suffering his second loss of the day against Cai. Soumyadeep lost 5-11, 14-12, 7-11, 8-11. 

The mens team will play Finland, while the women will take on champions China.

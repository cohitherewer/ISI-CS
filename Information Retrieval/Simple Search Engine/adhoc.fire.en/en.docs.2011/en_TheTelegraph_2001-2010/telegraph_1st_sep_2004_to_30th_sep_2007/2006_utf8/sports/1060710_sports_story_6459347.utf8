The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Quick Takes

 This was coaches World Cup: 

 Platini

 Berlin: Coaches and tactics 

 dominated this edition rather than the players themselves, 

 according to French legend Michel Platini. Its 

 the coaches World Cup, and I could also have called 

 it the World Cup of tactics, Platini said. Things 

 have changed, because 20 years ago it was the players 

 Cup. There was more freedom then, whereas now everything 

 is dominated by tactics. And in this tournament, the formations 

 have been rather defensive. In terms of the football on 

 offer, I dont think Germany 2006 will go down in the 

 annals, said Platini, who led France to the European 

 Championship honours in 1984.

 Blair thanks Germany

 Berlin: British Prime Minister 

 Tony Blair on Sunday said Germany has changed its image 

 abroad for the better thanks to the spectacularly successful 

 World Cup. The old clich?s have been replaced by a new, 

 positive and more fair image of Germany, he wrote 

 in a German newspaper column. He acknowledged the Germans 

 were disappointed they had to settle for third place. But 

 you can console yourselves and be proud that the German 

 team is among the biggest winners of the tournament and 

 that it deserves it.

 Fans pay tribute

 Berlin: Hundreds of thousands 

 of Germans waving flags of black, red and gold gathered 

 at Berlins Brandenburg Gate on Sunday to pay tribute 

 to their World Cup team, who clinched third place with victory 

 over Portugal. Fans held placards saying You are the 

 world champions of our hearts and Were 

 proud of you as the players waved to the crowd. The 

 German players sported T-shirts with the slogan Danke 

 Deutschland in the national colours of black, red 

 and gold and the words Team Spirit printed on 

 the back along with the number82 million ? the 

 population of Germany. Organisers said that at least 500,000 

 people had turned out.

 Welcome home

 Lisbon: The Portugal squad 

 returned home on Sunday to loud cheers from thousands of 

 fans at Lisbon airport. Portugal finished fourth after losing 

 1-3 to Germany on Saturday. The fans, wearing national colours, 

 waved flags and scarves while chanting and shouting. The 

 team should be congratulated and cheered, one of them 

 told a Portuguese TV station. Players gathered on the pitch 

 with coach Luiz Felipe Scolari, sang the national anthem 

 and then danced to popular Portuguese tunes. Figo thanked 

 the Portuguese fans for their support. Thank you for 

 backing us all the way. We wanted to bring you the Cup but 

 we couldnt. Thank you and long live Portugal, 

 he said.

 Proof of faking injuries

 Berlin: Now theres 

 proof that players are regularly faking injuries at the 

 World Cup. One of the biggest criticisms of the tournament 

 has been players diving, pretending to be fouled and acting 

 injured to draw cautions for rival players. In more than 

 half the cases when a player received treatment on the field, 

 there was no injury reported by medical staff. Dr Jiri Dvorak, 

 head of Fifas medical committee, said of the 156 on-pitch 

 treatments in the first 62 matches, 88 were not noted in 

 post-match reports. We have too much of this, 

 Dvorak said. Its something we need to look into. 

 Fifa, EU ink deal

 Berlin: Fifa, world soccers 

 governing body, and the European Union signed a joint agreement 

 on Sunday to use football in the fight against poverty in 

 the worlds poorest countries. The agreement, known 

 as the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), aims to promote 

 development in parts of Africa, the Caribbean and Pacific. 

 The EU and Fifa will invest 25 billion euros ($31.93 billion) 

 into the so-called ACP countries over the next 

 four years ahead of the 2010 World Cup finals in South Africa. 

 The agreement was signed by Louis Michel, the Commission 

 for Development and Humanitarian Aid and Sepp Blatter, Fifa 

 president.

 Old guard

 Berlin: Alan Cairncross, 

 a former guard of Rudolf Hess at Spandau prison, now makes 

 a living watching the grass grow at Berlins Olympic 

 Stadium. At least, helping the grass grow. The 49-year-old 

 Cairncross was one of the British soldiers assigned to guard 

 Hitlers deputy at the prison several kilometers west 

 of the Olympic stadium. After quitting the army, he worked 

 as a gardener before joining the staff at the Olympic stadium, 

 which was refurbished in 2004 and is home to Hertha Berlin 

 in the German league.

 Italian dies in mishap

 Rome: A 77-year-old Italian 

 pensioner fell off a ladder and died as he tried to attach 

 Italys flag to a pole ahead of the final. The man, 

 Rodolfo Profili, was raising the flag on a patch of land 

 he owned near the central Italian city of Viterbo when he 

 apparently lost his balance and fell eight metres into a 

 precipice, and was killed instantly, Italian news agency 

 ANSA reported. 

 Vote for soccer

 Washington: Latinos tuning 

 in to the final on Spanish language US stations may take 

 note of a new political recruiting tool ? TV and radio ads 

 targeting the soccer-loving voters. Democrats have launched 

 an aggressive $2 million advertising campaign during international 

 footballs quadrennial extravaganza give to woo Latinos, 

 whose votes and party affiliation are seen as being up for 

 grabs. Party officials are banking that the popularity of 

 the worlds most beloved sport ? especially in this 

 championship year ? can be used to enhance the Democrats 

 appeal, ahead of Novembers mid-term elections.

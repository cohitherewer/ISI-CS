 Ranatunga fears losing Moody 

 - Australia coach 

 Ranatunga 

Melbourne: Former Sri Lankan captain Arjuna Ranatunga fears coach Tom Moody will be poached by Australia after the World Cup next year as he had shown great diplomacy in dealing with a complex cricket board. 

Moody, a former Australian allrounder, is being billed as one of the two favourites to replace Australian coach John Buchanan, who will step down after the World Cup. 

With all the controversial things happening in Sri Lanka, its very, very important that you deal with all this (properly) as all these things can affect the team, Ranatunga said. 

I thought he has handled everything very well. He has done a good job so far, he was quoted as saying by a newspaper on Friday. 

Ranatunga expected Cricket Australia to pursue Moody with vigour. 

Normally after the World Cup there are a few changes. I am sure he will get an offer from Australia, he said. 

Thats normal procedure we train people, we get people in, then some other country will take them, Ranatunga remarked.

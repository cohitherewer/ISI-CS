 Sreesanth shouldnt lose heart: Kapil

New Delhi: Fast bowling great Kapil Dev on Monday had some words of encouragement for Sreesanth, the Kerala mediumpacer who was ignored for the ICC Champions Trophy. 

The World Cup-winning captain reminded Sreesanth that he was still very young and not being part of the squad for one or two tournaments should not worry him much. 

He (Sreesanth) is a young bowler. He should not lose heart and work hard to win back his place, Kapil said on the sidelines of a function here on Monday. 

The selectors must have had the right reasons to drop him. If players like (Anil) Kumble and V.V.S. (Laxman) can be dropped, then anybody can be dropped, Kapil said. 

On Sourav Gangulys exclusion, the former Indian captain said he should have retired a year ago. 

In my opinion, he should have called it a day a year ago. But if he has enough strength left to stage a comeback, its good. He should stay positive, he said. 

Kapil also said the current bunch of players were immensely talented and is capable of winning the World Cup. 

Sometimes I feel ashamed when I see people like Dhoni why I could not play the way they do it now. There is no dearth of talent. Only, sometimes it appears as if they fall short of commitment.

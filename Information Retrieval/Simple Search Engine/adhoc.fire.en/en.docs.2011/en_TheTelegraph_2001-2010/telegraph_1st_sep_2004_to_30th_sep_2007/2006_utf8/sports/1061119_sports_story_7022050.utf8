 Pace-spin dilemma for Rahul Dravid

Johannesburg: Rahul Dravid admitted he has choices to make while choosing between pacers and spinners for the first ODI. 

The Indian captain is aware that he has to also reassess his own role in the batting line-up. 

Harbhajan Singh has been the best bowler for us in the last year and half, probably the best in the world. We need Anil Kumble as well looking at the next World Cup. But Anil probably can ease himself into this series, he said. 

The other issue of choosing the right bowlers for the death overs, a bane for India, was no less nagging one. Ajit Agarkar is fully fit and Zaheer Khan is an experienced bowler in death overs, so obviously we have a choice in this area, he said. 

Dravid finally looked at his own position within the team and how best he could bring it to use. Obviously there is an option of me coming up the order though we also would have to see if it does not make us top-heavy. (Agencies)

 Ronaldinho isnt a robot: Rijkaard

Madrid: Barcelona coach Frank Rijkaard has defended playmaker Ronaldinho from criticism that he is not reproducing the kind of form that earned him the World Player of the Year title. 

It is okay to criticise the team because they have shown they can do better but it is too much to only talk about Ronaldinho, Rijkaard said. He is a fundamental player for us, but he isnt a robot. Sometimes we forget he is human. 

The Brazilian international failed to live up to expectations at the World Cup in Germany and has struggled to inspire the European and Spanish champions in their relatively sluggish start to the season. 

Barcelona are top of the Primera Liga but some laboured performances have raised questions about the form of the team and Ronaldinho in particular. 

What happened in the World Cup hasnt affected him. He had the right attitude but his teammates just didnt connect with him, Rijkaard said. But it is another thing to talk about the pre-season. Because of contractual obligations he had to play every game and this catches up with you in the end. 

We have seen a drop in his performances but we arent worried. We are managing it and he is doing what he can for the team which is the most important thing. 

Both Rijkaard and defender Rafael Marquez have pinpointed the clubs two-week promotional tour of Mexico and the US as a major disruption to Barcelona preparations for the season. 

In a separate newspaper interview Ronaldinho, who has a history of slow starts, backed Rijkaards assessment of his state of form. 

I start every season the same and the team have started similarly. I am getting into it with the team and we are developing together, Ronaldinho said on Thursday. 

I am not a machine. My only objective is to help the team and when they need me I will be there. 

Barcelona face a tough October with high-profile clashes against Uefa Cup holders Sevilla, Real Madrid and two games against Chelsea in the Champions League. 

Ronaldinho, the FIFA world player of the last two years, has scored twice in his opening six league and Champions League games, although this is not his worst start with Barcelona. 

In each of his first two seasons since he arrived from Paris Saint-Germain in 2003, he had only managed a single goal at the same stage. 

Despite Ronaldinhos difficulties, Barcelona head the Spanish league with 13 points from five games its best position at this stage of the season since Rijkaard took charge in 2003. (Agencies)

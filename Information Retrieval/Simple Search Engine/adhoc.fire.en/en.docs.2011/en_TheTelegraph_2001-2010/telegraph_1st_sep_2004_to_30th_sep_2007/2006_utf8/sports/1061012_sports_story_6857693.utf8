 Shabbir rehab 

Karachi: Pakistani paceman Shabbir Ahmed, the first cricketer to be banned under the ICCs new laws governing bowlers with suspect actions, will undergo corrective measures in Australia next month. 

PCB official Saleem Altaf said Shabbir suspended for 12-months in December last year will work under bio-mechanic specialists Daryl Foster and professor Bruce Elliot in Western Australia. 

Shabbir will be sent for three days and then the specialists will send their report to the ICC, which will review his action when the ban ends on December 18, Altaf said.

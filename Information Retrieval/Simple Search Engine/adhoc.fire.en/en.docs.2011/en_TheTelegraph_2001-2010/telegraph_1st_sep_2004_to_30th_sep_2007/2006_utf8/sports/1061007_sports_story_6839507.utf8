The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Schumacher is very focused, very calm

 - JAPANESE GP

 - I don't see him being irrational: Ferrari technical 

 director 

 Michael Schumacher in Suzuka on Friday 

Suzuka: Formula One fans could be in store for some classic Michael Schumacher performances as the Ferrari great closes out his career in search of an unprecedented eighth title. 

Ferrari technical director Ross Brawn said on Friday that he believed the 37-year-old German would show more of the brilliance that clinched a memorable win in China last weekend in the final two races of the season. 

There was a period I believe when Michael was wrestling with his (retirement) decision, but I think you saw his performance in China was classic Michael, Brawn said at the Japanese Grand Prix. 

If he can perform like that in the last two races it would be fantastic and I think he will. 

His heads clear now, he knows what hes doing and he is very focused on this championship. 

Last month, Schumacher announced at Ferraris home Italian GP that this season would be his last. He leads Renaults Fernando Alonso 7-6 on race wins in a knife-edge championship with both drivers level on points. 

He won in China after Alonso, who had led to the first pitstop, struggled with tyre problems on a drying track after a wet start. 

The German scythed past the Spaniards teammate Giancarlo Fisichella, fresh out of a pitstop on cold tyres, with two wheels on the grass to take the lead. 

Schumacher has won and lost championships that have gone down to the wire before now and Brawn said the most successful driver in Formula One history appeared to be taking everything in his stride. 

For me, hes very focused and very calm and thats a good sign, the Briton said. 

I dont see him being irrational and I dont see any signs of stress. 

I can only judge Michaels condition (rather than Alonsos) and hes very focused, very positive and very calm. 

So I think hes going to do a superb job, and itll be down to circumstance the tyres, reliability and things like that, Brawn added. 

Ferrari have won six of the last seven races while Alonsos last victory was in Canada in June. The Spaniard has retired twice in the last four races, in Hungary due to a mechanical failure and in Italy with a blown engine. 

Any mistake at this stage is going to be very expensive, warned Brawn. But we are pleased with the cars performance, pleased with the teams performance. 

We said (before China) that it was a three race championship. Well, its a two race championship now. So neither team can afford to make an error, it could be very costly. Its getting tight now. 

Ferrari have also called for fair play to ensure that the title showdown is not tarnished by underhand tactics. I think what we mustnt have is, lets say, the No.2 drivers blocking or intentionally slowing one of the championship contenders, Brawn said. I think that would be a bit unfortunate and unacceptable, the Briton added. 

Its something which we know that we were involved in a few years ago, and it was considered normal practice then. Its been deemed to be unacceptable now so we understand that. (REUTERS)

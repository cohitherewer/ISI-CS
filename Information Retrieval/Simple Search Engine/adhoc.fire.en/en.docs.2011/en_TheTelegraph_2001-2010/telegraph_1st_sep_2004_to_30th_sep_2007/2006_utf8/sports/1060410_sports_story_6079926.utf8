Guwahati: The Assam Cricket Association (ACA) has decided to refund the spectators who had paid to watch the abandoned India versus England one-dayer at the Nehru Stadium on Sunday. 

The ACA expects to recover the losses, they might suffer, from the National Insurance Company (NIC). 

ACAs treasurer Ghanashyam Baruah told The Telegraph this evening that they will finalise the modalities of the refund with UCO Bank, who had sold the tickets. 

We had insured the match with NIC for Rs 60 lakh against any kind of untoward incident. Fans need not worry about their money. Our secretary has already made an announcement to this effect. Necessary details will be worked out as soon as the office opens tomorrow, a hard-pressed Baruah said. 

In all 17,850 tickets were put on sale through the bank. The security clearance was for 21,000. We are yet to get the numbers of tickets sold, he added. 

Sources, however, say that fans will have to wait for at least a week to get their money back.

 Canas ban reduced

Bern: A two-year doping ban on Argentinas Guillermo Canas has been cut to 15 months on Tuesday following an appeal. He was banned by the ATPs anti-doping tribunal in August 2005. 

CAS ruled that Canas ban should be reduced to 15 months after hearing how the player had been given the substance in error by staff at a tournament in Acapulco. (Reuters)

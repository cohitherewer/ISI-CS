The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Mohammedan Sporting aim for winning start

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: Mohammedan Sportings day of reckoning has arrived. Come Tuesday, the rejuvenated side will start their campaign against Railway FC in the CFL Premier Division. 

Three points without flamboyance are what coach Subhas Bhowmick is looking for ahead of his teams season-opener. 

This is typical of a person who has tasted both eye-catching successes and devastating failures. So, this approach to the game bordering on the cautious and sometimes the ugly is actually a part of the strategy to survive a marathon league. 

Winning is important, but I dont believe in anything flamboyant in achieving it. On paper, we are a good side but I wont mind getting three points even in an ugly way, Bhowmick said on Monday. 

He knows his side ? strengthened on the basis of a host of former East Bengal and Mohun Bagan regulars ? starts favourites but with the vast knowledge of plying his trade in the Maidan, Bhowmick is taking nothing for granted. 

Im yet to get a look at full strength of the side. Okoro is not here. Players like Mama (Shylo Malsawmtluanga) and M. Suresh are also not available. But Ive delivered with a young, promising side, he said. 

However, Douglas da Silva ? who helped East Bengal win back-to-back NFL titles before leaving for Brazil with injury ? may start the match. 

 Ive seen Railway FC play in Kalyani (against Eastern Railway). They are a very strong team, the coach warned.

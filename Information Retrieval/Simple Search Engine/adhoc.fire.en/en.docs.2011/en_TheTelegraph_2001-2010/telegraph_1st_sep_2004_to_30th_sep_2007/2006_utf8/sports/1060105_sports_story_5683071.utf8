 Move to abolish Champions Trophy

Mumbai: India will call for the abolition of the Champions Trophy at an International Cricket Council (ICC) meeting in Dubai next week, a leading Indian cricket board official said on Wednesday. 

We could have Australia for a bilateral at that time, which could make a lot of money, say $50-60 million, the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said on Wednesday. 

Therefore, why have the Champions Trophy? 

The Champions Trophy is the brainchild of former ICC and Indian board chief Jagmohan Dalmiya, who is credited with turning the cash-strapped ICC into one of the worlds richest sporting bodies.I think other countries may have a similar thinking. This will find a sympathetic ear, the official said on phone from New Delhi after attending a meeting of the Asian Cricket Council. (REUTERS)

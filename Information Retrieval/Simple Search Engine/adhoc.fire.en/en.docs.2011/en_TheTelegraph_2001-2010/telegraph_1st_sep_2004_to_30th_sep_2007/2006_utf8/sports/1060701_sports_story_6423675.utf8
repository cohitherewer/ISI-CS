The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 A throwback to the 1998 final

 - Ronaldinho not preoccupied with goal drought 

 Barthez 

Frankfurt: Memories of Zinedine Zidanes finest hour and Ronaldos worst will be evoked when France play Brazil in Saturdays quarter final between the last two world champions. 

 Brazil coach Carlos Alberto Parreira said he did not regard Saturdays game as a chance of avenging 1998. 

Theres no atmosphere of revenge, were not thinking about that here, Parreira said. 

Parreira added: Ronaldo and Zidane are the two monsters in the world of football. 

After bringing in some fresh faces for the final group game against Japan, Parreira reverted to his original line-up against Ghana in the last 16 and saw his team pull off a flattering 3-0 win. 

His France counterpart Raymond Domenech also appears to have found the right formula, the 3-1 second round win over Spain reminiscent of previous vintage. 

Meanwhile, the Brazilian Football Confederation said midfielders Emerson and Kaka, who have been treated for pain in their right knees, were ready to take part in Fridays practice at the Waldstadion. 

Zidane was back in training on Friday, which suggested he should start Saturdays match. Zidane, who will end his glittering career after the finals, knows every match now could be his last. 

We will have to play even better to stand a chance but I believe we can because the team can adapt to the opposition and raise the level of their game, said Domenech. 

All 23 members of the France squad trained on the Frankfurt pitch , including defender Willy Sagnol. 

Like Zidane, Ronaldo, now the most prolific scorer in World Cup history with 15 goals, started with below-par performances before scoring in successive games against Japan and Ghana. 

Now the two meet again in what could be a classic encounter. 

When youre a football player, your first dream is to play in the World Cup and the next one is to meet Brazil there, said France midfielder Patrick Vieira. 

Meanwhile, Ronaldinho has finally admitted that he wouldnt mind scoring at least once for Brazil during this World Cup. Only last week the midfielder said he was not preoccupied with his goal drought. 

But , Ronaldinho seems to be warming to the idea of scoring. He maintains that his main priority is to help my teammates score goals.

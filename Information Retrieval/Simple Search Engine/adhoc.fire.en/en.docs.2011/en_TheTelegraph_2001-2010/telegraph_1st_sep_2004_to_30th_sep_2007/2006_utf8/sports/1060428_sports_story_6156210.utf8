The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 A ready reckoner for women

Berlin: German women, baffled by soccers offside rule or unable to fathom why grown men cry like babies when their teams lose a big match, are turning to new books and crash courses to get ready for the World Cup. 

An entertaining new book, Raus aus der Abseitsfalle (Beat the offside trap) and special adult education courses are targetting women who admit that they are yet to grasp the intricacies of the worlds most popular game. 

According to the joint women authors of the book, Offside is often discussed, but seldom understood. Its a problem involving space and women are said to have their difficulties with space. 

Their advice is to imagine your living room as a pitch. 

Your husband sitting there on the couch is a defender and the television hes watching is the goal, they write. You come into the room and move between him and the television, now youre offside. But its only passive offside. 

Then your son (teammate) enters and tosses a bag of chips (the ball) to you. Youre now offside. Your husband screams as you have taken an unfair advantage because you could in theory slam the bag of chips into the TV with no defender to stop you. 

The two women authors, who have long worked on television sports broadcasts, offer scores of handy and humorous tips for both genders: 

 Dont interrupt men just before kick-off with comments such as Dinner is ready or Did you walk the dog yet? because they are too pumped up with adrenalin or too nervous about the 90 minutes awaiting them to do or think about anything else. 

 Dont ask questions such as: Which team is ours? For those who cannot figure out which side is Germany, its better just to keep your mouth shut and wait for clues from the TV announcer. 

 Dont ever say: Its just a game. Because: This isnt just about life or death for men ? its more than that. And even if David Beckham may be the best-looking player under the sun, he is still from England. They are our arch-enemies! 

The authors said they wrote their book to help women move beyond their designated roles at match time. 

Women either dont take part at all or sit in silence. Women are only tolerated if they worship the male expert next to them, or if theyre good-looking, or if they fetch the beer. 

In Nuremberg, an adult education centre recently offered a hugely popular course for women called Understanding Soccer ? Women Want to Know Now!

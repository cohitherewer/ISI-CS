 Colombo: Cheteshwar Pujara slammed 

 a brilliant century as India put up an awesome performance 

 to wallop England by 234 runs and storm into the final of 

 the ICC Under-19 World Cup on Wednesday.

 Pujaras strokeful unbeaten 

 century helped India pile up 292 for four before seamers 

 Abu Nachim Ahmed and Yo Mahesh skittled out the English 

 colts for a mere 58 in 20.1 overs. Ahmed claimed four for 

 14, while Mahesh took two for 14.

 That only Graeme White got a two-digit 

 score (17) reflects the state of their batting. India will 

 face the winners of Fridays clash between Pakistan 

 and Australia on Sunday. 

 After the Indians opted for first 

 strike, opener Pujara unleashed a barrage of strokes to 

 record his teams first century of this competition.

 Pujara batted through the innings 

 and finished unbeaten on 129 off 146 balls to set the stage 

 for the bowlers. It was a case of second time lucky for 

 Pujara, who had made 97 against the West Indies in Saturdays 

 quarter final. The elegant right-hander struck ten fours 

 and a six, making the most of an early let-off. 

 He was on one when he edged Huw 

 Waters low to the left of slip fielder Varun Chopra, who 

 grassed the ball.

 Pujara and Gaurav Dhiman (48 off 

 44 balls) once again got India off to a flying start. They 

 put on 72 inside 14 overs before Dhiman miscued Graeme White 

 to be caught by the diving Rory Hamilton Brown.

 Rohit Sharma (59) joined Pujara 

 in a punishing stand of 112 in 23 overs which gave India 

 the perfect platform for a late assault. Sharma hit four 

 fours and a six in 72 deliveries before Mayank Tehlan hit 

 26 off 28 balls in the last few overs. (PTI)

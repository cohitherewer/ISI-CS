 New Delhi: Super heavyweight pugilist V. Johnson outslugged Syrian Olympic bronze medallist Ahmed Wattar on his way to win a silver medal in the International Senior Men?s Boxing Memorial Tournament in Debrecen, Hungary.

 India also secured two more bronze medals through 69kg welterweight Olympian Vijender and debutant Paramjeet Singh in the 48kg light fly division. 

 Nicosia (Cyprus): Marcos Baghdatis was granted a temporary exemption from military service with the Cypriot army, allowing him to concentrate on his career.

 President Tassos Papadopoulos, who received Baghdatis at his home on Sunday, granted the exemption. 

 Baghdatis, who became the first Cypriot to play in a Grand Slam final at last week?s Australian Open, said it didn?t mean he was refusing to serve.

 ?I believe I should do the army and serve my country,? Baghdatis said.

 ?I just need some peace of mind for a few years until my career is finished.?

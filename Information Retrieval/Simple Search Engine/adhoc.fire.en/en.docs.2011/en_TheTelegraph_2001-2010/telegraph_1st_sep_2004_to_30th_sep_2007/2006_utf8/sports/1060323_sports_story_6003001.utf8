The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Mother of all surrenders

 - Hosts slump from 75 for three to 100 all out 

 - Flintoff Man of the Match and Series 

 Englands Shaun Udal, who picked up four wickets, in Mumbai on Wednesday 

Mumbai: India crashed to their seventh lowest total to allow a depleted but spirited England win the third and final Test and square the TVS Cup 1-1. 

A total of 100 runs is all that some of the worlds best batsmen made among themselves in an embarrassing day for Indian cricket to leave England winners by a huge 212 runs on the final day of the Test at the Wankhede. 

Beaten comprehensively in Mohali a week ago, the visitors showed great spirit in notching up this win. 

Ironically the Indian batsmen, regarded as the best players of spin in the world, allowed 37-year-old England off-spinner Shaun Udal to make a mockery of that reputation after Man of the Series Andrew Flintoff had made early inroads in the batting line-up. 

Indias last seven wickets fell for 25 runs as Udal took 4 for 14 on a fifth day wicket that held no terrors. Flintoff grabbed 3 for 14 as India collapsed for 100 in 48.2 overs. 

Sachin Tendulkar, booed when he fell cheaply in the first innings, briefly raised hopes of answering his critics and visions of a shock Indian turnaround before lunch, but once he fell for 34, his highest in the series, it was a virtual procession of Indian batsmen. 

England now go into the seven-match one-day series beginning in Delhi on March 28 high on morale. Indians will have to do much better to tame the visitors. 

Chasing 313 for an unlikely win, India lost nightwatchman Anil Kumble and opener Wasim Jaffer early after resuming the day at 18 for one. 

With their backs to the wall, the hosts required an inspired performance from their batsmen but what the stars churned out betrayed a lack of self-belief and application. 

India lost wickets in a heap in the dramatic post-lunch session to suffer their seventh lowest score ever at home and their lowest at this ground. India had been shot out for 104 by Australia last season before going on to win that match at this venue, their previous lowest score here. 

The victory was also Englands first on Indian soil since David Gowers 2-1 series triumph in 1984-85 against Sunil Gavaskars team. 

The sensational collapse saw the home team, who made 279 in their first innings to trail England by 121 runs, being bundled out 74 minutes into the post-lunch session with Udal coming up with a fantastic spell of 7.2-3-8-4. 

Flintoff, also named Man of the Match, made no mistakes in the field this morning, making the right bowling changes with himself unleashing an aggressive but controlled spell. 

The tight bowling meant only opener Jaffer (10), Tendulkar and Yuvraj Singh (12) could reach double figures. 

The dismissals of Dravid (9) and Tendulkar within the space of seven balls started Indias irreversible slide. 

Dravid pushed at a ball from Flintoff that did not move away as much as he expected and edged behind while Tendulkar, who hit five fours, was caught bat-pad at short leg off Udal as he stretched forward in defence. (Agencies)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Md. Sporting challenge ends

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: Mohammedan Sportings challenge in the Durand Cup ended here on Saturday when Air India beat Assam Rifles 5-2 to clinch the top spot from the group A pre-quarter final league at the Ambedkar Stadium. 

A win for the Assam side by not more than three goals would have taken the Calcutta outfit to the last eight stage. But that was not to be as Air India took a firm grip over the proceedings in the second half. 

Assam Rifles took the lead twice only to surrender it on both occasions. Mohammedan Sporting coach Subhas Bhowmick walked off the ground with his assistant Jagadish Ghosh after Air India scored their third goal. 

While M. Kamai and Buke Jigdong scored two spectacular goals for Assam Rifles, Vijith Shetty (2), Benoy Kuruvilla, Bashiri Abbas and Paresh Shivalkar scored for Air India. 

In group B, JCT routed Border Security Force (BSF) 3-0 to make the last eight. Adebayo Tokunbo, Shivraj Singh and Rennedy Singh scored.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Belgian still in picture

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: East Bengal are having a rethink on Phillipe de Ridder and may fall back on the Belgian for another season. 

We never said that we will not continue with De Ridder. We had earlier decided to have a discussion on the coachs issue after the Super Cup, a club source said. 

De Ridder, who left the country straightaway after East Bengals Super Cup win in Mumbai on Saturday, may be called back again. Our contract with De Ridder runs till May 31 and we will take decision within that period, the source pointed out. 

Meanwhile, despite reports of Bhaichung Bhutia having struck a deal with Mohun Bagan, East Bengal are not losing hope. We will sit with Bhaichung. He was our captain last season and will try to keep him this season also, he said.

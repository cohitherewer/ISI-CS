 Milan open up 7-point lead

Rome: Inter Milan beat Empoli 3-0 on Sunday to notch up a record-equalling eighth league win in a row and open a seven-point lead in Serie A. 

Second-half goals from Hernan Crespo, Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Walter Samuel helped Inter equal a club record winning run dating back to the 1939-40 season. 

Inter have 39 points from 15 matches, seven points more than second-placed AS Roma, whose title bid suffered a setback when they lost 0-3 to city rivals Lazio at the Olympic Stadium in Rome. (Reuters)

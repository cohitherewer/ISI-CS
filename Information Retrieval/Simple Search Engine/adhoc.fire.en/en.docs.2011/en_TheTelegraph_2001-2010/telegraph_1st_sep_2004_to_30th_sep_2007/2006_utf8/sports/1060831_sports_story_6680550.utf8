 Clockwork triumphs 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Trainer Vijay Singh kept 

 his promise, winning three events on Wednesday. His tally 

 included the main event, the 1,800m Mandolin Cup which his 

 filly Clockwork won despite her expanding odds from evens 

 to 4-1. It was a start-to-finish victory for the Steinbeck-Alarming 

 daughter who, however, faced an unexpected challenge from 

 Adderly while the favourite, Wizard Of Oz, ran a poor race. 

 Vijays other winners, Andrology and Asterisk, however, 

 won their respective events with total authority.

 Apprentice jockey Amandeep Singh was the only other professional who did well in the seven-event card. He notched up a popular double.

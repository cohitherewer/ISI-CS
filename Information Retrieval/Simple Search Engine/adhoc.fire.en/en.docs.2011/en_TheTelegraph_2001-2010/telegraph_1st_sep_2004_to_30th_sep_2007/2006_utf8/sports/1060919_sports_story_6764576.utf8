 Prasanta not happy with teams show

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Faridabad: Bengal coach Prasanta Banerjee, it seems, has set to exacting a standard. Soon after Bengal defeated Madhya Pradesh 5-0, Banerjee made it clear that he was not too happy with the performance of his team. 

We won and qualified all right, but I am not happy with the way the boys played today, he said. We committed mistakes in the defence, the midfield organisation was not up to the mark and the strikers held the ball too long. 

One could understand Banerjees problems. He has already been thinking about the possible encounter against Services and knows that these mistakes could be fatal in the crucial match. 

We should have scored more goals, Banerjee felt. We went up 4-0 in the first half and could score only one in the second. I thought the boys turned too casual at one point of time. Otherwise, how can you justify missing two penalty kicks? Thats unpardonable, said an irritated Banerjee. 

He was, however, happy that Avinash Thapa played well. I knew he would be an asset against Madhya Pradesh. Another good thing is that Vimal Pariyar once again scored three goals. Seven goals in two matches will surely boost his confidence when we play the knock-out match three days later.

 Marseille, Roma get a jolt

London: Status and reputation counted for nothing when Zenit St Petersburg and Middlesbrough dented the Uefa Cup hopes of Olympique Marseille and tournament favourites AS Roma on Thursday. 

Zenit will take a 1-0 lead back to Russia for the second leg of their last-16 tie after Andrei Arshavins second-half goal sank 2004 runners-up Marseille. Nigerian Aiyegbeni Yakubus first-half penalty gave Middlesbrough a single-goal advantage over injury-hit Roma. 

Marseille had France under-21 midfielder Franck Ribery sent off at the Stade Velodrome as Zenit stunned the former European champions. Russia midfielder Arshavin scored with a fine curling shot on 51 minutes. 

Ribery was dismissed 20 minutes from time for a second yellow card and Zenit almost grabbed a second when substitute Oleg Trifonovs shot crashed against the crossbar. 

Roma, Europes in-form team after setting a Serie A record of 11 successive league wins but hit by injuries to strikers Francesco Totti and Vincenzo Montella, offered little attacking threat to Middlesbrough. Yakubu netted the only goal early on after Italy under-21 keeper Gianluca Curci, standing in for injured Brazilian Doni, had brought down striker Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink. 

Rapid Bucharest, who started in the first qualifying round in mid-July, have a good chance of reaching the last eight after goals from Daniel Nicolae and Mugurel Buga earned a 2-0 win over Hamburg SV. 

The prolific front-pair have hit eight goals apiece in this seasons competition.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Exciting finishes on last day 

 STAR RACER

 Daniel leading in 

 Pure Valour (Chisty up), the winner of the Madras Race 

 Club Cup at the RCTC on Thursday

 Calcutta: The curtains 

 came down on the 29-day winter season on Thursday with the 

 two major trophy events in the card ? the Madras Race Club 

 Cup and the Tug Of War Cup ? producing a rip-roaring finish. 

 Incidentally, both events were bagged by public fancies 

 ? Pure Valour and Ciraja, respectively.

 If Daniel Davids Pure Valour secured the verdict from the stablemate, Simply Sensational, virtually at the post, the winning-post came to the rescue of the Javed Khan-trained Craja, who inside the last furlong, had established a length lead over a strongly fancied Tomahawk and a fast-finishing El Cid. It was El Cid, who came with an electrifying run but lost by a neck.

 Trainer H.S.Baths Satluj claimed the third trophy on offer, the So Amazing Cup, which he won easily from the start.

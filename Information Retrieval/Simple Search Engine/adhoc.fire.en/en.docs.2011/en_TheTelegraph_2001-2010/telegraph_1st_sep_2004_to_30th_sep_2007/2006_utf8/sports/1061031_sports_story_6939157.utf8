The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 A difficult period, says Yuvraj

 - Surgery will be necessary if healing is not quick 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: Its a difficult period... But, then, I couldve been injured while fielding, was Yuvraj Singhs first comment when The Telegraph contacted him (on his cellphone) after his knee injury had been assessed by Dr Anant Joshi in Mumbai, Monday morning. 

Yuvraj, it may be recalled, twisted his left knee at a warm-up session (on the eve of the Champions Trophy face-off against Australia) in Mohali. Initially, a tear was suspected, but its much worse the ligament has broken, he informed. 

At this stage, its not clear whether surgery will be required... Dr Joshi has decided to wait for a fortnight before examining the knee one more time... If the healing isnt satisfactory, then surgery is going to be needed, Yuvraj added. 

Yuvraj intends remaining in Mumbai for a few days and will be monitored there by Team India physio John Gloster. Im going to be back in Chandigarh after a few days and, then, take it from there... If surgery is necessary, then Ill stay in Mumbai for the rehab, he said. 

For now, Yuvraj is only out of the ODIs in South Africa, but his fingers are crossed. A million other fingers, too.

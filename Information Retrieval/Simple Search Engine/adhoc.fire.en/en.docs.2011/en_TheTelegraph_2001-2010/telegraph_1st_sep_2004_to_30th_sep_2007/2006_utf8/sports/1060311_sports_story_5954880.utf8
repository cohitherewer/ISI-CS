 Muralidharan cracks 600 

 - 2nd Test vs Bangla 

Bogra: Muttiah Muralidharan became only the second bowler to take 600 Test wickets as Sri Lanka closed in on a win in the second and final Test against Bangladesh on Friday. 

Sri Lanka, looking to wrap up the series 2-0 after winning the first Test in Chittagong by eight wickets, were 77 without loss on Day III, after being set a 120-run target. 

Left-handers Upul Tharanga (48) and Michael Vandort (22) were unbeaten after Sri Lanka, who gained an 82-run first innings lead, dismissed Bangladesh for 201 in their second innings. 

Muralidharan took a wicket each in the first two sessions to get to the milestone in his 101st Test. 

The 33-year-old off-spinner became the only bowler besides Aussie leg-spinner Shane Warne (659) to get to the mark. 

Muralidharans first victim was left-hander Shahriar Nafees (6). He got to the milestone when former captain Khaled Mashud (12) holed out to Lasith Malinga at deep square-leg and the Sri Lankan players mobbed him in congratulations.

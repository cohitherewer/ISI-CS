The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Day I highlights

 The last time India made such a poor start in a Test (they 

 were three for two on Friday) was against New Zealand in 

 Mohali on October 10, 1999. They were then dismissed for 

 83, but went on to draw the match by making 505/3 declared 

 in the second innings

 The last time India were dismissed on the first day of a 

 Test was against Pakistan in Lahore on April 5, 2004. India, 

 bowled out for 287, lost by nine wickets on Day IV

 Rahul Dravids 81 was his seventh 50-plus score in 

 his last seven Tests, the previous six being ? 71 vs England 

 in Nagpur, 95 vs England in Mohali, 52 vs England in Mumbai, 

 62 vs the West Indies in Antigua, 146 vs the West Indies 

 in Gros Islet and 68 not out in Basseterre. This is an Indian 

 record. Five others ? Vijay Hazare, Chandu Borde, Sunil 

 Gavaskar, Dilip Vengsarkar (twice) and Sadagopan Ramesh 

 ? made six 50-plus scores in six straight Tests

 The catch of Mohammed Kaif was the 157th of Brian Laras 

 career, putting him in joint-second position among fielders 

 with Mark Taylor. Only Mark Waugh (181) has more catches 

 in Test history

 Anil Kumble reached the 5000-run mark in first-class cricket 

 during his knock of 45. He now has 5021 runs in 213 first-class 

 matches. Kumble also completed 2000 Test runs (when on 30) 

 on Friday

 Kumble became only the second cricketer in Test history 

 (after Aussie Shane Warne) to do the 500-wicket, 2000-run 

 double. Kumble, till the end of Fridays play, has 

 2015 runs, 526 wickets and 50 catches in 110 Tests. Warnes 

 tally reads: 2958 runs, 685 wickets and 120 catches in 140 

 Tests

 Kumble became only the fourth man to aggregate over 2000 

 Test runs without scoring a single century. The others are 

 Shane Warne (2958), Chaminda Vaas (2435) and Chetan Chauhan 

 (2084)

 The 93-run partnership between Dravid and Kumble was Indias 

 best for the seventh wicket at Sabina Park, obliterating 

 the 83 between Polly Umrigar and Russi Surti in 1961-62

 Jerome Taylor claimed his maiden five-wicket haul in his 

 seventh Test. His previous best of 3/118 came in the third 

 Test of the ongoing series in Basseterre

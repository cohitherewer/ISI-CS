 For the book

 Barry Bonds smacked his 716th career homer as the San Francisco Giants crushed the Florida Marlins 14-2 on Monday. Bonds eighth home run of the season, a two-run shot in a six-run, fifth-inning burst, left the slugger just 39 runs shy of tying Hank Aaron. It was his first homer since passing Babe Ruth for second place on the all-time list on May 28.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Madrid: Valencia were fined 6,000 euros ($7,192) after a linesman was cut on the head by an object thrown from the crowd during their recent King?s Cup tie against Deportivo Coruna. The Spanish football federation classed the incident, which led to the referee abandoning the game, as ?serious?, and issued the maximum fine permitted for an offence in that category.

 The linesman was hit by a coin thrown from the crowd at the Mestalla shortly after Valencia scored in the second leg of their Cup tie against the Galicians on Jan. 25. The referee stopped the game and the remaining 46 minutes were played behind closed doors at the Mestalla a week later. Deportivo won the tie 2-1 on aggregate and now face Espanyol in the semi-finals. ?We are satisfied with the decision,? Valencia vice-president Enrique Lucas was quoted as saying by a sports daily on Wednesday.

 Rome: Livorno have appointed Carlo Mazzone as their new coach to replace Roberto Donadoni, the Serie A side said on its website on Tuesday. Donadoni quit earlier in the day after Livorno?s president, Aldo Spinelli, criticised his tactics on an Italian television show. Mazzone, 68, is Italy?s most experienced coach. He began his career in 1968 at then third division side Ascoli and has previous top-flight experience at 10 different clubs, including Fiorentina, AS Roma and Napoli.

 Brussels: A number of Belgian clubs risk expulsion from the professional game after the country?s soccer association announced on Tuesday an investigation into allegations of match-fixing. The move follows a TV programme aired by national broadcaster VRT on Sunday that alleged match-fixing in seven first division matches this season. ?Any club found guilty will be thrown out,? Jean-Marie Philips, chairman of the Belgian professional league, said. ?We intend to use the ultimate sanctions necessary.?

 Uefa, European football?s governing body, said it would uphold any ban handed down by the Belgian football association. Sunday?s programme alleged 14 players and coaches from several teams were linked to a Shanghai-based gambling ring. All the clubs named deny any wrongdoing.

 San Francisco: US track star Marion Jones has settled a defamation lawsuit she brought against a self-taught nutritionist at the centre of the Balco sports doping scandal, a local newspaper said on Tuesday.

She denied the charge and has never failed a doping test.

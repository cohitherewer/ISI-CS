 Lanka take slender lead

Nottingham: Muttiah Muralidharan won his personal battle with Kevin Pietersen at Trent Bridge on Saturday to inspire a spirited Sri Lanka fightback on the second day of the third and final Test. 

The visitors had looked in serious trouble after being dismissed for 231 on Day I. 

But by the close of play on Saturday they had turned the game on its head, skittling their hosts for 229 in their first innings and then taking their overall lead to 47 . 

Kumar Sangakkara was batting on 22 with Upul Tharanga on 17 and both batted with confidence.

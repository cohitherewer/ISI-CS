 Domenech: Goal is to be in final 

Hamelin: Frances World Cup squad must ignore the wave of euphoria sweeping the country after they reached the semi-finals of the World Cup, coach Raymond Domenech said on Sunday. 

Its madness in France but our feet must stay firmly on the ground, Domenech said. Our goal is to be in the final and we are not there yet. 

Domenech also said players should be sin-binned after being booked. I think it would be better if players booked were immediately suspended temporarily instead of carrying their yellow card into the next match and facing the risk of being suspended, he added.

 London: Steve McClaren 

 will be the next England manager, the Football Association 

 said on Thursday. He will take over when Sven-Goran Eriksson 

 steps down after the World Cup finals in Germany.

 McClarens appointment comes 

 six days after Luiz Felipe Scolari, the FAs first 

 choice, pulled out of the running because of media intrusion. 

 McClaren is currently Erikssons assistant.

 McClaren has signed a four-year 

 contract which starts on August 1, after the World Cup finals. 

 Ive had many great moments in football in my 

 career but that has to be the greatest ? Im very, 

 very proud, he said at a press conference.

 Ive got the experience, 

 Ive got the knowledge, I like a challenge and this 

 is one of the biggest challenges in my career

 I have always said hes 

 an extremely good coach and he has always done an extremely 

 good job for us, Eriksson said.

 After an undistinguished playing 

 career as a midfielder, McClaren began coaching in the early 

 1990s at Oxford United.

 He moved on to Derby County where 

 he worked under experienced manager Jim Smith and helped 

 the club win promotion to the Premier League in 1996.

 McClaren, his reputation growing 

 fast, was then lured to Manchester United as Alex Fergusons 

 deputy and helped the club win the treble of European Cup, 

 Premier League and FA Cup in 1999.

 While at United, following Kevin 

 Keegans resignation as England manager in 2000, McClaren 

 joined forces with Peter Taylor in temporary charge of the 

 national team.

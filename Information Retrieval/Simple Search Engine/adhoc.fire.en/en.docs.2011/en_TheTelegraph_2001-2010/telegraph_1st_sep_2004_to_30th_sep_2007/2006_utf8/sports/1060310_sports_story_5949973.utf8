The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Let them answer my queries first 

DALMIYAA STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Former BCCI president Jagmohan Dalmiya on Thursday brushed aside fresh charges brought against him by BCCI vice-president Lalit Modi and Inderjit Singh Bindra, a former president and a key member of the present regime. 

They are raising hell over Rs 26 lakh. But earlier I have raised questions on $18 million. I think it is a huge amount! First they should answer all my queries. I will also answer them but at the right time, Dalmiya said at the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB). 

Earlier in Mohali, both Bindra and Modi brought new charges against Dalmiya, a day after a City Civil Court passed an interim order restraining the BCCI from giving effect to its showcause notice issued to Dalmiya on February 27.

 Lord Byrons reign comes to an end

 - A golfer and a gentleman passes away 

 Byron Nelson 

Los Angeles: Golfing great Byron Nelson, who won an unprecedented 11 successive PGA Tour events during 1945, died on Tuesday at the age of 94. 

The Tarrant County Medical Examiners Office said he had died of natural causes at his ranch in Roanoke, Texas. Besides his wife Peggy, Nelson is survived by his brother Charles Nelson and sister Ellen Scherman. 

A five-time major winner who is widely considered the straightest hitter of the ball in history, American Nelson was also known for his elegant swing and chivalrous attitude, earning him the nickname Lord Byron. 

Although he never won the British Open, he claimed the Masters in 1937 and 1942, the PGA Championship in 1940 and 1945 and captured his one US Open crown in Philadelphia in 1939. 

Nelson had the greatest year in the history of professional golf when he won 18 tournaments in 1945. Between March 11 and August 4, the Texan won 11 consecutive tournaments to set a PGA Tour record which has never been beaten. 

Nelsons unerring accuracy will never be forgotten and inspired the United States Golf Association to name its repetitive ball-testing machine Iron Byron. 

In 1946 at the age of 34, he decided to quit the game and buy a ranch just north of Fort Worth, despite having enjoyed three golden years in a row. 

Nelsons 52 US PGA Tour victories a milestone surpassed by Tiger Woods this year was sixth on the career list behind Sam Snead, Jack Nicklaus, Hogan, Arnold Palmer and Woods. 

He lived a long and rich life, and I think it is safe to say that for all that the game of golf did for Byron Nelson, he gave back to the game 10-fold, said Nicklaus on his official website. I think the only thing that rivals Byrons greatness on a golf course is the manner in which he conducted his life as a gentleman, a role model and an ambassador. 

Arnold Palmer called Nelson one of the greatest players who ever lived. I dont think that anyone will ever exceed the things that Byron did by winning 11 tournaments in a row in one year. 

The closest any player has come to Nelsons streak is six, first by Ben Hogan in 1948. Then Woods reached that number in 1999-2000. 

He retired early, Woods said early on Wednesday from the American Express Championship outside London. All he wanted to do was make enough money to buy his ranch. If he had kept playing like guys do now, more than likely he would have won more tournaments than anyone. (Agencies)

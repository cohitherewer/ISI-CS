 Punters tips

 Sharp Singles 

 Chandigarh: Australian skipper Ricky Ponting gave batting tips to children and played cricket with them here on Thursday. 

Ponting interacted with 60 children who had won a contest organised by ING Vysya Bank and bagged a chance to meet and play cricket with him. 

Ponting reached the banks branch after his gruelling net session at the sector 16 cricket stadiums and gave valuable tips about batting to the budding cricketers. 

He also hit sixes and fours sending the tennis ball, with which they were playing, flying in all directions. These kids are the stars of tomorrow and I am happy to see their love for cricket, he said.

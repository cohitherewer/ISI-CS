 Conditions may dampen state bodies interest 

 - FIFA GOAL PROJECT II 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: The much-publicised Fifa Goal Project II, which makes the All India Football Federation (AIFF) eligible to get a grant of $400,000 from the world body and use it to build up four regional centres across the country, may not find too many takers among the state associations. 

According to top officials of some of the state associations, who do not wish to be identified before the project is tabled for discussion in the federation meeting in the third week of May, the AIFF proposal has too many conditions attached to it. 

While the money is too little, the responsibilities are too many, said the secretary of a state association. It may be better to take up an independent project than to be associated with the Goal Project, he added. 

Under the Fifa project, AIFF receives $400,000 for building up four regional centres, one in each zone. The state associations, which wish to be associated with the project, will not only have to provide land for the Project (the land should be enough to build at least two football grounds and a building which will be used as a hostel or an office), but will also have to raise matching contribution to realise the project. 

We understand that each of the four state associations will receive $100,000, which is around Rs. 45 lakhs, said a state football administrator. It means we too have to raise Rs. 45 lakhs and a piece of land. If we can manage so much, then why should we opt for Goal Project and not try to build our own infrastructure? 

The AIFF letter to state associations also says that the state association or local government will have to enter into a Memorandum of Understanding with Fifa and AIFF allowing for the lease of the property for at least 25 years as well as right to utilise the facilities for at least 200 days per year. 

It clearly means the infrastructure will actually remain in national bodys possession for more than half the time in a year. The IFA secretary, Subrata Dutta, who is also the vice-president of the AIFF, said he would not comment before it is being discussed in the federation meeting, but conceded quite a few clauses attached to the project could be reviewed. But, then, any money to improve upon the prevailing infrastructure is always welcome, he maintained. 

Savio Messias, Duttas counterpart in Goa Football Association, said he personally did not find the offer too exciting, but would discuss about it with his committee with an open mind. I only wonder why the proposal makes it mandatory for the state associations to amend their constitution and bring it in line with the Fifa and AIFF constitution. 

The AIFF secretary, Alberto Colaco said the change of constitution was proposed as per the directives of Fifa and AFC. It is being done so that the project does not face any legal problems at the end.

 BCCI permission not sought 

 - Black arm-band issue

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Indore: The two Karnataka players in the India 

 squad, captain Rahul Dravid and debutant opener Robin Uthappa, 

 wore a black arm-band (during Saturdays ODI here) 

 to mourn the passing away of the iconic Rajkumar. 

 Convention, of course, is that the entire team mourns. 

 That, too, after the Board of Control for Cricket in India 

 (BCCI) has given its consent. In this case, permission wasnt 

 even sought for those black arm-bands. 

 The BCCI wasnt contacted 

 and, so, theres no question of having given consent, 

 secretary Niranjan Shah told The Telegraph. He added: 

 Apparently, after what happened in Bangalore, there 

 must have been some pressure... However, Ive conveyed 

 what needed to be. 

 Even umpire A.V. Jayaprakash, who is from Karnataka, 

 did a Dravid and Uthappa.

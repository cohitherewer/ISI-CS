The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Shots which caught the eye the most

 Berlin: Teamgeist ? the official ball of the World Cup ? has been held responsible for it, but fans have come to love it as it has resulted in some breathtaking goals, especially from long distances. Heres a peek into the best six goals in the lead-up to Sundays final: 

 Maxi Rodriguez

Maxi Rodriguez (Arg) vs Mexico 

 Suddenly the Argentinians looked beatable as Mexico led and were then pegged back at 1-1 in their second round clash. The match looked like it was heading for penalties and it needed something special to break the deadlock. Rodriguez came up with it in breathtaking style. 

Taking down Juan Pablo Sorins pass, the Atletico Madrid midfielder looked up and volleyed it from well outside the area from the right, past a stunned Oswaldo Sanchez to secure a 2-1 victory. His World Cup was to end in shame, picking up a two match ban for hitting a German player after the penalties loss to the hosts. 

 Esteban Cambiasso (Arg) vs Serbia and Montenegro 

 While Rodriguezs goal was a superb individual effort, this was probably the team goal of the tournament. It involved 24 passes and was breathtaking in its intricacy and execution. Cambiasso wouldnt have been the punters choice to be at the end of it, having been a rare goalscorer for the team in over 20 appearances. He was to fall to earth later in the finals as he had his penalty saved in the shootout by Jens Lehmann which handed the hosts victory. 

 Fabio Grosso (Ita) vs Germany 

 The Palermo defender had already been pivotal in Italys win over Australia, falling over a prostrate Lucas Neills leg to win a debatable injury-time penalty. However, his contribution a minute from the end of extra-time in the semi-final was divine. Andrea Pirlos slide rule pass into the box found him, and he curled a left-footer past Lehmann ? not bad for only his second ever goal for the Azzurri. His celebration was as impressive, holding his hand to his ear and evoking memories of Marco Tardelli in the 1982 final ? also a win over Germany. 

 Bakary Kone (Ivory Coast) vs The Netherlands 

 Sepp Blatter was moved to say that Ivory Coast played the best football among the African countries even if they went out in the first phase. But for woeful finishing, they might have progressed. However, Kone was an exception, with his brilliant effort against the Dutch. Seizing on the ball outside the area, the striker was allowed to run across the face of the edge of the penalty box before drilling an excellent shot high beyond Dutch goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar. 

 Joe Cole (Eng) vs Sweden 

 There werent too many high points to Englands campaign, with their much-vaunted attacking midfielders being especially disappointing. However, unlike his Chelsea teammate Frank Lampard, 25-year-old Cole did score, and a special effort at that in the first round match. A headed clearance fell to him outside the area, Cole chested to control and then uncorked a looping right foot volley that flew into the top corner although Andreas Isaksson got a hand to it. 

 Ronaldo (Bra) vs Ghana 

 Probably not the greatest of his career, but worthy of mention simply because the much criticised Brazilian strikers goal took him past Gerd Mullers World Cup finals record of 14. The 29-year-old latched onto Kakas defence-splitting pass in the fifth minute of the second round clash which left him one on one with Ghana keeper Richard Kingson, who he rounded easily and slid the ball into the net. I want more and more and more! beamed Ronaldo, for once not talking about food but goals.

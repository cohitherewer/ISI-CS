Madrid: A dramatic late equaliser from Julio Baptista moved Real Madrid up to second place in the Primera Liga on Sunday after they came from behind to draw 3-3 with Villarreal in the Bernabeu. 

Two goals from Baptista either side of a header from Zinedine Zidane on his last home appearance in a Real shirt secured a point after Diego Forlan had threatened to upstage the Frenchman with two goals to put Villarreal in front. 

Real have 70 points with one game left to play, 12 short of champions Barcelona, who beat city rivals Espanyol 2-0 in the Nou Camp on Saturday. 

Valencia are third with 69 after being held to a 1-1 draw at home by Atletico Madrid. 

Fourth-placed Osasuna failed to make sure of playing in the Champions League for the first time next season when they let slip a one-goal lead to lose 2-1 at Racing Santander. 

At the other end of the table Cadiz were relegated back to the second division after only one season in the Primera Liga when they fell 3-1 away to Getafe. 

Real took the lead after 23 minutes when Raul headed Robinhos cross into the path of Baptista who let fly with a scorching volley. 

The visitors were soon back in contention when Juan Roman Riquelms corner was nudged into his own goal by Real defender Alvaro Mejia in the 31st minute. 

Forlan burst down the right eight minutes later and fired across Iker Casillas into the far corner to put the visitors in front. 

Zidane equalised in the 67th minute, pulling wide at the far post to meet David Beckhams cross with a looping header back across the goal. 

With five minutes left Villarreal broke and Javi Ventas goal-bound shot was blocked by Sergio Ramos using his hands. The Real defender was sent off and Forlan made no mistake from the penalty spot. 

But they only held the lead for two minutes before Baptista rose to head home Beckhams free kick. 

Meanwhile, Klaas-Jan Huntelaar scored two goals to help Ajax win the Dutch Cup with a 2-1 victory over PSV Eindhoven, adds a report from Rotterdam. 

The win boosted Danny Blinds chances of keeping his job as Ajax coach. On Friday, a club spokesman said that Blinds position would be reviewed after Sundays match. 

Blind led Ajax to a fourth-place finish in the Dutch league, and local media has repeatedly speculated that he is to be replaced by FC Barcelona assistant coach Henk Ten Cate. 

Ajax has won the Dutch Cup a record 16 times, while PSV has won the trophy eight times. 

Ajax took the lead when Huntelaar headed in Wesley Sneijders corner in the 46th minute. Four minutes later, right back Michael Lamey equalised for PSV with a long-range effort. 

Both teams were down to 10 men in the second half after Lamey and Tomas Galasek were dismissed for getting two yellow cards. 

Ajax was stronger in the second half with substitute Ryan Babels darting runs down the left flank proving a handful for the PSV defence. 

Huntelaar dispossessed Andre Ooijer in the 89th minute to drill home from close range. 

Sundays match was Guus Hiddinks last as PSV coach. Hiddink, who also coaches Australia, signed a two-year contract with Russias national team in April. (Agencies)

 Greg Chappell defends players

Benoni: Team India coach Greg Chappell has sought to deflect criticism of the teams disastrous show in the South Africa tour-opener, saying the players had been pitted against quality opposition without adequate time to adjust to the new conditions. 

It can happen, stepping out of airplane and playing in two days time against genuine quality bowling. But thats the only way you are going to learn, Chappell said in a stout defence of his players after the 37-run loss to South Africa A in the one-day warm-up here on Thursday. 

Chasing a target of 256, the Indians were blown away by the express speed of Dale Steyn, who finished with five for 22 from 10 overs. The Indians arrived in South Africa on Tuesday and play their first of five one-day Internationals in Johannesburg on Sunday. 

I dont know too many players who are well equipped to handle real fast bowling when they first walk on to international stage. Most of them have to get used to it by experience, the 58-year old former Australian captain said. 

Not only the batsmen found the going tough, even the bowling came apart at the seams in the final overs, none more than Munaf Patel and Sreesanth who went for over 60 runs each. We gave a couple of guys an opportunity of bowling in the death overs which they havent done before. If you want to get better you have got to have those opportunities, Chappell said. 

Sometimes it is a painful initiation you have to go through. But then you learn the lesson, Chappell said. 

The coach felt that wicketkeeper-batsman Mahendra Singh Dhoni has now been part of international cricket long enough to take on more responsibility. 

He is going to get better if he takes risk and bears responsibility. I think MS is ready for that role. He has played a reasonable amount of international cricket now.

 Gloucester 154/7 vs Northants

 Sourav Ganguly 

London: Mark Hardinges hit an unbeaten 94 as Gloucestershire made 154 for seven in a Twenty20 match against Northamptonshire in Bristol on Tuesday. 

Gloucestershire suffered early blows as both the openers Ian Harvey (5) and Craig Spearman (3) were back in the pavilion with eight runs on the board. 

Hardinges then led the fight back with his solid 94, which came in just 64 balls and included nine fours and four sixes. 

Matthew Nicholson picked up three for 22. Sourav Ganguly went wicketless in his four overs. 

On Monday, Souravs stroke-filled 29 was not good enough as Northamptonshire went down to Warwickshire by 20 runs in a Twenty-20 match at Edgbaston (as reported in Tuesdays Late City edition). Leading his sides chase of a target of 188, the former Indian captain struck five fours in his 23-ball knock that broke a sequence of low scores. 

But the Northants failed to build on the good start given by Sourav and Usman Afzaal (21) and were restricted to 167 for nine. 

 Tell-all book 

Meanwhile, Sourav is planning to write a tell-all book on his controversy-ridden career. He revealed this in a chat with a British television channel. 

Talking about the controversy surrounding his sacking as captain and removal from the team, Sourav said:Im too lazy to write a 600-page book, maybe when I finish or at some stage when I feel its the right time I will clear it up. It (the book) will be all about cricket, on the field and some things off the field. 

When asked if it will include a chapter on Greg Chappell, he replied tongue in cheek, well, when you read the book youll find out. (PTI)

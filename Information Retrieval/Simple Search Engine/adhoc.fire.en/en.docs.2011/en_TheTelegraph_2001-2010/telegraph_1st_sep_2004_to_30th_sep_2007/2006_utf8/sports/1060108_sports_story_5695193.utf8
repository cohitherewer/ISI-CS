 Chelsea survive a scare

London: Premier League leaders Chelsea survived a late scare to beat Huddersfield 2-1, while Middlesbrough were taken to a replay by Nuneaton Borough after a late penalty earned the minor league club a 1-1 draw in the third round of the FA Cup on Saturday. 

Two Robert Pires goals in the opening 18 minutes gave holders Arsenal a 2-1 win against Cardiff City and league. 

Nuneatons Gez Murphy sent Middlesbrough goalkeeper Bradley Jones the wrong way with 90 minutes on the clock, equalising Gaizka Mendietas 15th minute free kick and securing a January 17 replay at the Riverside stadium. 

Tamworth, the other minor league club in action, also forced a replay after a 0-0 draw at second division Stoke City while former England captain Alan Shearer equalled Jackie Milburns club scoring record with his 200th goal for Newcastle United in a 1-0 defeat of Mansfield. 

Everton had a 79th minute Leon Osman strike to thank for saving their blushes at second divison Millwall. Birmingham were held 0-0 by fourth division Torquay.

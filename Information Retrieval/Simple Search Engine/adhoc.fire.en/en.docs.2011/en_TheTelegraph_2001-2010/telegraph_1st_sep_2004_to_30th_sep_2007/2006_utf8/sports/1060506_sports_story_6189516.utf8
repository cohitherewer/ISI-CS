London: Two goals from Jose Antonio Reyes gave Arsenal a 3-1 win at Manchester City on Thursday and closed the gap on Tottenham Hotspur to a point in the battle for the final Champions League qualifying spot. 

Substitute Reyes slotted home from Emmanuel Eboues cross in the 78th minute and six minutes later, bent the ball left-footed around City goalkeeper David James into the top corner. 

Fifth-placed Arsenal have 64 points with one game to play. They host Wigan on Sunday in the final match at their Highbury ground, while north London rivals Tottenham travel to FA Cup finalists West Ham. 

Even if they finish in fifth spot, Arsene Wengers team could still make the Champions League next season if they beat Barcelona in the final of the competition on May 17. 

Arsenals cause, as well as Englands World Cup hopes, were given a boost with left-back Ashley Cole making his first start since last October. 

The defender, who has suffered foot, thigh and ankle injuries, played the full 90 minutes, watched by England manager Sven-Goran Eriksson. 

The good news is that it was 90 minutes at high pace and he came through well, Wenger said. He finished very tired he said, but its good news. 

Wenger played down the importance of having already qualified for next seasons Champions League ahead of this months final saying he was not sure it would ease the pressure on his players. 

When you go into a Champions League final you want to win the game and thats all. You do not think about the rest, you just want to win the game on the day and thats what we want to do, he said. 

In Spain, Real Madrid climbed above Valencia into second place in the Primera Liga with a 3-2 away win over relegation-threatened Racing Santander on Thursday. 

Roberto Carlos scored from the penalty spot after 33 minutes and Roberto Soldado and Robinho extended the lead after the break. 

But Racing staged a stirring comeback with Sergio Matabuena scoring twice in the last 14 minutes as the visitors wobbled. 

Real have 69 points with two games to play, one ahead of third-placed Valencia, who lost 1-2 away to Real Mallorca on Wednesday.

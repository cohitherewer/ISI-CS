Mumbai: The champions across the spectrum of all sports have a perfect sense of time and space to rise to the occasion. They come to realise the essence of the need with adequate response to a greater challenge. Muttiah Muralidharan has come across this situation for the umpteenth time in his illustrious career. When the team needed him, Sri Lankas Man Friday delivered again and helped them snatch a convincing seven-wicket victory. 

Sri Lankas defeat to Pakistan in the opening match meant they went into Fridays clash against New Zealand in virtually what their captain Mahela Jayawardene had described as first of the two semi-finals, to stay in the title-race. This is the occasion on which the Muralidharans love to thrive on. On a day which marked the release of Shah Rukh Khans latest blockbuster Don, Murali earned that sobriquet in every sense of the term at the Brabourne Stadium and ensured his team left the venue alive and kicking. 

He (four for 23) came to the scene exactly midway of the innings when New Zealand were struggling at 82 for four. However, there was always hope for a recovery as it has become a trend in case of other teams in the competition. The importance of the Sri Lankans success lies in the fact that all escape routes for the New Zealanders were blocked in his web of spin. 

Set against the target of 166, Sri Lanka began their chase on a positive note. Sanath Jayasuriya (20) and Upul Tharanga (56), having survived the initial stings of Shane Bond and Kyle Mills, made the contest look one-sided in one time. Jayawardene also chipped in with a valuable 48. 

The verdict, in a way, is a justification of the fact that how swiftly the games focus can change from the scandalous to the sparkling! Following the doping disgrace in the Pakistan camp to a barrage of criticism over the Brabourne strips, the ongoing Champions Trophy perhaps needed a balance, a sort of purgation so that the game could move forward towards a sane and sensible direction. How better can it be than a process of turning the tournament wide open midway! 

If Pakistan and the West Indies victories over Sri Lanka and Australia were surprises required by the game to get a semblance of respectability in the face of some image-shattering incidents, the Muralidharan-inspired show against the odds was a step towards that route in the right earnest. 

Nothing seemed to be going in favour of Fleming who started the day equalling Arjuna Ranatungas record of leading in the most number of ODIs since the New Zealand captain elected to bat. A number of eyes was fixed gauging what was in offer after the early-morning spraying of the unique Poly Vinyl Acetate (PVA) glue on the track under the supervision of ICC grounds committee consultant Andy Atkinson. It soon revealed a whole new scenario with no signs of low bounce and instead, balls flying over the stumps in regularity and batsmen struggling to cope with the pace. 

Fleming (0) perished to one such delivery from Chaminda Vaas, which cut in sharply and stuck on his pads. New batsman Nathan Astle survived another close leg-before appeal from the same bowler as New Zealand were forced to shrink themselves into a defensive mould. The opening 10 overs yielded only 30 runs, an indication that the batsmen were under a test of exasperating patience here. 

However, New Zealand lost their other opener Lou Vincent when he tried to defy the situation and got flummoxed by a Fervez Mahroof slower. Muralidharan then took the centrestage, struck in his very first over, tearing Jacob Orams ambition to pieces through a doosra. There was still hope for New Zealand as long as Nathan Astle was there, but once he fell prey to the champion off-spinner, the Black Caps hopes turned to despair.

 King-sized decision for Sven as foot curse returns

 Matt Dickinson

 Martin Jol claimed on Monday that Ledley King still had a good chance of going to the World Cup finals despite the stress fracture in his foot, but Sven-G?ran Eriksson would be advised to consider the alternatives. 

The England head coach will name his squad for Germany on May 8 ? he must submit it to Fifa by May 15 ? and King will have to be a quick healer to have fully recovered by then. 

It could leave Eriksson with a difficult decision and, while King has become a valued member of the squad, he is not in the same category as Ashley Cole or Michael Owen, two senior players recovering from injury. 

King, 25, who came off near the end of Tottenham Hotspurs 1-0 victory away to Everton on Saturday, has suffered a stress fracture in the fourth metatarsal of his left foot. The England camp must feel cursed by an injury that has afflicted Wayne Rooney, Gary Neville, David Beckham and Owen. 

The lesser nature of Kings injury gives him a chance of being named in the 23-man party, although he is unlikely to play for his club again this season. Hes got a good chance for the World Cup, but we will have to check him every week, Jol, the Tottenham head coach, said. 

As well as providing cover at centre half, King has secured a place in the squad as a holding player although, after a difficult match in midfield against Argentina in November, Michael Carrick has probably usurped him in that position. 

Kings absence could help to secure a place on the plane for Sol Campbell, provided that he can prove his fitness. Rio Ferdinand, John Terry and Jamie Carragher are already sure to travel as centre backs. 

Campbell suffered a broken nose on his return for Arsenal last week after injury. Eriksson has assured him that he will be included if fit and, while Sir Alex Ferguson has been pressing the claims of Wes Brown, the Manchester United defender has not been regularly involved under Eriksson. 

While Eriksson crosses his fingers and hopes for no further injuries before the World Cup finals, Alan Curbishley, the Charlton Athletic manager, is due for a second interview this week for the position of Englands head coach. No decision is expected before next week at the earliest.

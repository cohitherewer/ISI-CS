 Zaheer wants to play for Mumbai

Vadodara: Indian Test discard Zaheer Khan took the first step towards making a comeback to the national squad by deciding to play for Mumbai. 

The left-arm Baroda seamer expressed his desire to play for Mumbai and sought a no objection certificate from the Baroda Cricket Association after Dilip Vengsarkar, who on Wednesday took over from Kiran More as chief selector, asked Zaheer to play for Mumbai at the domestic level. 

BCA secretary Rakesh Parikh said they had received a letter in which the left-arm seamer requested an NOC for his transfer. 

Zaheer was quick to submit his application as the Mumbai Cricket Associations managing committee is scheduled to meet on Friday to discuss the players for upcoming season. (PTI)

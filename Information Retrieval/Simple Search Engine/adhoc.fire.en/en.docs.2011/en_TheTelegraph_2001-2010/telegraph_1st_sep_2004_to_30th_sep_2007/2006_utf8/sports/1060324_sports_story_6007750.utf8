 Lifters bring more shame to India

Melbourne: Doping scandals returned to haunt India with two of their weightlifters testing positive for banned substances at the Commonwealth Games on Thursday. 

The two lifters ? Edwin Raju (56kg) and Tejinder Singh (85kg) ? were caught using performance-enhancing drugs, leaving the Indian camp in a now-familiar doping mess. 

A third lifter, Shailaja Pujari, had dropped out of the Melbourne-bound squad after testing positive. Shailaja is already serving a provisional ban from the International Weightlifting Federation (IWF) after she was caught doping in an out-of-competition testing by World Anti Doping Agency (WADA) officials at NIS, Patiala, last month. 

The two lifters have been verbally told that they have been caught for drug abuse. They have already left the Games village, a source in the Indian contingent said on Thursday. 

However, the Indian contingent has not received any official communication in this regard, the source said. 

Commonwealth Games federation chief executive Mike Hooper said that no details would be officially released on any tests until the B samples had been analysed and cases confirmed. 

When contacted, sources in the Indian Olympic Association said they were puzzled and perplexed. 

We are puzzled and perplexed. Only after WADA and SAI had tested the lifters on March 1, were they cleared to travel on March 8. We are puzzled as to what happened in the meanwhile, the sources said. 

The lifters reached here on March 10 and their samples were collected the next day. They were informed about the results of the tests Wednesday morning, they said. 

Rumours of a drug scandal were rife after Tejinder pulled out of mens 85kg class competition at the last minute on Monday citing illness. 

Raju had finished fourth in mens 56kg division competition last week, in which compatriot Vicky Batta won the silver. 

The organising committee had collected their samples and sent them to Sydney for tests. 

John Harnden, chief executive officer for the Games, had earlier said that samples of all medal winners and some other participants had been taken and sent to Sydney for tests. 

It is a long-drawn process adhered to under the rules of WADA and we do not disclose either the positive or negative result of the tests to anyone other than the athlete concerned, Harnden said. 

The tests are being done at the Australian Sports Drug Test laboratory in Sydney and they will inform the Games Medical Commission, which in turn deal with the athletes concerned, Harnden said. 

 The scandal broke despite the 

 Indian Weightlifting Federation taking stringent measures 

 to prevent any such incidents by subjecting its lifters 

 to a series of dope checks in which top medal prospects 

 like Shailaja (75kg) and B. Prameelavalli (63kg) were filtered 

 out.

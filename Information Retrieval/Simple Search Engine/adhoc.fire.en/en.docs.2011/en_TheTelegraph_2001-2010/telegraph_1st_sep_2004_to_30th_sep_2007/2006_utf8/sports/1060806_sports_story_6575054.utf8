Los Angeles: The man who is arguably the worlds best soccer player may be the only person on the planet who hasnt seen the most famous moment of last months World Cup. 

Brazil playmaker Ronaldinho has said that he has yet to watch the video of France midfielder Zinedine Zidane head-butting Italy defender Marco Materazzi in the final though hes heard about it from everyone he knows. 

To tell you the truth, I havent seen anything, Ronaldinho said, ahead of tomorrows friendly between FC Barcelona and Mexicos Chivas of Guadalajara. 

Zidane was ejected for the head-butt in the World Cups final in an image broadcast worldwide. Italy went on to win 5-3 on penalties. 

It was Zidane who played an instrumental role in knocking Brazil out in the quarters. 

When we were eliminated from the World Cup, I went home and disconnected from the world. I didnt watch TV or read the newspapers, said Ronaldinho. But wasnt he curious to see it? Everybody told me about it, but I preferred to stay away from (everything related to) the World Cup, Ronaldinho said. (AP)

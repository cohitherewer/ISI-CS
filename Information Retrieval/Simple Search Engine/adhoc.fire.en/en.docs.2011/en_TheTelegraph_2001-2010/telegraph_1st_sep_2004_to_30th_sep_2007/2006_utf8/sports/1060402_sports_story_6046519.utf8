Calcutta: Mohammedan Sporting are riding high on confidence after their 1-0 win over Air India in their last National Football League match. 

This air of self-assurance found expression in Mohammed Habibs words on Saturday, the eve of their Round X match against East Bengal at the Salt Lake Stadium. 

We are now confident that we can give other clubs a good run for their money. The team was low on confidence as we lost three matches in a row, but after the win against Air India, we are pretty confident to turn the tide in our favour, Habib said after the teams practice. 

Mohammedan Sporting now have 14 points from 10 match while East Bengal have 18 from nine outings. 

In the midst of all this, Sundays match between the city rivals will be a test of their defence. The red-and-gold brigade might have scored nine goals in their last two matches but conceded as good as six. 

For Mohammedan Sporting, they have to look out for the East Bengal captain Bhaichung Bhutia, who is in sublime form. Although Habib said that were not thinking about any particular individual...there will be no special marking for Bhaichung, Madhab Das, Madhusudan Majumdar and David may share the responsibility of watchingthe player. 

East Bengal, however, will miss some of the key players. Mike Okoro, Alvito DCunha, Covan Lawrence and Ngassa Martial all are going to miss the tie. 

Alvito has left for Goa since his mother is ill, Covan is suffering from a leg injury and Martial is out with double booking. Sasthi Duley is also nursing an ankle problem but it is still not clear whether he will make it to the XI. 

Like the previous match, the Belgian coach Philippe de Ridder gave his wards leave on the match-eve. 

Meanwhile, Habib will miss out the services of Bijen Singh and Gley Yao Rodrigue. Bijen is down with fever and Rodrigue is out with double booking.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Barreto to play for Bagan

 - I will be signing for them in next fortnight, says Brazilian

 Barreto 

New Delhi: Brazilian striker Jose Ramirez Barreto on Monday put all speculations to rest when he confirmed that he would be joining Mohun Bagan in the next few days. 

Speaking to the media on the sidelines of a soccer show organised by the ESPN, the ace goal-getter said he has made up his mind to quit Mahindra United and join back the green and maroon brigade. I will be signing for Mohun Bagan in the next fortnight. But, then, it is going to be a one-year contract. I want to play there for one year first and then decide on my next course of action, Barreto said. 

Asked what made him switch to Mohun Bagan once again after having so much problems with the Calcutta outfit three seasons ago, Barreto, who has reportedly been offered a whopping amount of Rs. 65 lakhs for the season, said: I am a helpful person. Believe me, I love to help others. For the past five years Mahindra were building good teams, but could not win too many major titles. This season it was a highly satisfactory experience to help them win both the Federation Cup and the National League. 

Barreto said he was pained with the fact that Mohun Bagan could not get much success in the past three seasons. Now that their management has changed, it will be good experience to work with a professional set of officials. 

Replying to a specific question, Barreto said he might continue to play for another four to five years. I have already turned 30. I have gained in experience, but will not have the required body strength to continue beyond five years. I have achieved a lot of things in life. I am proud of what I have done so far. But, somewhere I will have to stop. 

The Brazilian said he was not sure about his future. I havent given a serious thought to it yet. But no doubt, I need money now, he confessed. 

His life, Barreto felt, took a new turn in 1999. That was the time when I turned a Protestant. It completely changed my lifestyle. I stopped drinking and shed off all other bad habits. It gave me so much peace in life.

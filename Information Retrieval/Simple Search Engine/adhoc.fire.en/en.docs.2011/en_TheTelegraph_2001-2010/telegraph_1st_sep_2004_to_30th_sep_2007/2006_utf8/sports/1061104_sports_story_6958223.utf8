 BTC faces big crisis 

 SRIMAX

Chisty on Star Perfection

 Bangalore: Bangalore Turf Club (BTC) stewards have cancelled the opening weeks campaign. It is because the trainers are protesting against the new licensing procedure that makes them responsible for all obligations arising out of the employment of syces, including the payment of their provident fund. Trainers are opposed to such a condition, therefore no entries. Trainers say, BTC has gone back on its promise made at the start of the summer season. The issue is unlikely to be settled in a hurry and the seasons start may be further delayed.

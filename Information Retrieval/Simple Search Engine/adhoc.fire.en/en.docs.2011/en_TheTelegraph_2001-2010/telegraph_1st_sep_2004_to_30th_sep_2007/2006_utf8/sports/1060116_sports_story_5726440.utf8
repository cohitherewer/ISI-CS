Brisbane: Boeta Dippenaar and Mark Boucher both scored half-centuries to lead South Africa to a five-wicket win over hosts Australia in a roller-coaster one-day International at the Gabba on Sunday. 

Dippenaar made a patient 74 off 115 balls, while Boucher blazed an unbeaten 63 off 62 deliveries to steer the Proteas to victory with seven balls to spare. 

The South Africans looked to be in trouble when they slumped to 162 for five in the 41st over, chasing 229 to win. 

But Boucher, who struck six fours and six, and Justin Kemp (29 not out) steadied the ship with an unbroken stand of 71 to seal victory. 

The Proteas had seemed on course for an easier victory when they reduced Australia to 61 for seven in the 18th over, with Man of the Match Shaun Pollock capturing three wickets, including Adam Gilchrist from the first ball of the match. 

But Mike Hussey and Brett Lee rescued the innings with a 123-run partnership, setting a record for the highest seventh wicket stand in a ODI by Australia. 

Australia looked to be in with a chance of winning when they removed Graeme Smith (12), Jacques Kallis (0), Herschelle Gibbs (16) and Ashwell Prince (19) before Dippenaar and Boucher swung the match back in South Africas favour.

 Take Hair off panel: Ranatunga

A new twist was added to the ongoing Darrell Hair controversy after International Cricket Council chief executive Malcolm Speed told a news conference on Friday that the Australian umpire had asked for $500,000 to quit. The following are some of the reactions (in alphabetical order) to Hairs action : 

 Arjuna Ranatunga: The International Cricket Council 

 (ICC) should take a very firm action. Hair has had enough 

 problems in the past. The ICC had taken off Hair from their 

 panel earlier, they should do that again. Keep him out for 

 some time and rehabilitate him before bringing him back 

 again. 

With issues like these, relations between two countries suffer the most. (Because of Hairs decision to call Murali) the Australian fans jeered our team when we toured Down Under last. 

People get angry with countries because of the conduct of some of the officials. The Aussie might come out with a book in three months, it will sell very good. 

 S. Venkatraghavan: Umpiring is a tough job, decisions 

 are to be made in a split second and you have to go by what 

 youve seen with naked eyes. 

Hair does not seek controversy purposely, but yes, his decisions are controversial sometimes as he gives an impression that he is arrogant on the field. 

What happened on the field that day was that Pakistan refused to play and the umpires had no other way to go about... (But) it is difficult to comprehend and the episode is difficult to forget.

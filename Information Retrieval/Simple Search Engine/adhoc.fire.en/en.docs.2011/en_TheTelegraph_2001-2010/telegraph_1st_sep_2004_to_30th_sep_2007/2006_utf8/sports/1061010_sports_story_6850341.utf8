 Fleming fears Sachin, Dravid

 - Bond, Vettori will be our best bets 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: Like all other captains, Stephen Fleming believes that his team has every chance to win the Champions Trophy. But the stumbling block to his ambitions, according to him, will not be Australia, but Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid. 

The duo, Fleming admitted, has the ability to give India the Champions Trophy. Sachin is a tremendous batsman and has come back to form. Dravid has become a matured captain. Both, I think, will play crucial roles for India in this tournament. 

Fleming made it clear that his team would be dependent on Shane Bond and Daniel Vettori in the Champions Trophy. 

Shane is our best bowler. He is back to full fitness and that is a big plus for us. He has to be taken good care of because of the huge workload his role demands of him. 

In this tournament, Vettori will also be required to perform at his best as pitches might favour him. 

New Zealand won the inaugural Champions Trophy in Nairobi, but since hasnt done too well in the tournament. Fleming is aware of this and says this time the team has to be careful. I am sure the boys are going to deliver this time. 

Fleming said the teams USP is that it has a quite few players, who can both bowl and bat well. I dont think we are a glamorous side, but we are certainly a good one, he felt.

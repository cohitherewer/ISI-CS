 Pressure wont ever go away, says Kaif

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

Kingston: Mohammed Kaif is happy that he got an unbeaten 66 in his comeback ODI, on Thursday, but feels the pressure is going to stay. 

Pressure har match mein rehta hai... Pressure wont ever go away... More than the runs, Im happy I batted for 91 balls... I needed to spend time at the wicket and was able to do so, he told The Telegraph on Friday morning. 

Kaif, of course, acknowledged the support from captain Rahul Dravid and coach Greg Chappell. Theyve been of big help in the tough times... Chappell, in fact, confirmed that Kaif would have a role in Team Indias 2007 World Cup campaign. 

Till the Sabina Park outing, the UP captains scores in ODIs this year had been: 8, 5 not out, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 5 and 15. He was dropped for the last three matches ? in Indore and twice in Abu Dhabi. 

Kaif, however, scored 49 in Tuesdays tour-opener (versus the JCA XI in Montego Bay) and accepted that the innings lifted his confidence.

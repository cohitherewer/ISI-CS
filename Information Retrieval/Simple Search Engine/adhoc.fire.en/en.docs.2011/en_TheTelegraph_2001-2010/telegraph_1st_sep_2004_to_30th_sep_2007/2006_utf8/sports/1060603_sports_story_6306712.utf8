 Parreira praise for Zico leadership

 Weggis: Brazil coach Carlos 

 Alberto Parreira has praised countryman Zico for his work 

 in leading the Japanese national team.

 Japan has gained a new dimension 

 with Zico in command, Parreira said. It has 

 a personality now.

 Brazil and Japan meet on June 

 22 in Dortmund in their last group-stage match. Parreira 

 says he expects a tough match. Japan has lost the 

 fear of playing other teams, Parreira said on Thursday. 

 Maybe thats Zicos greatest achievement

 World Cup opener against Paraguay on June 10. Jamie Carragher 

 or Owen Hargreaves will play in Neville right-back 

 position against Jamaica.

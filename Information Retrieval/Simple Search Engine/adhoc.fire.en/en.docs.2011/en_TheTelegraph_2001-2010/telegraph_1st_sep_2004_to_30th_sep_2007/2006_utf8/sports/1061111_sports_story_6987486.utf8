 Odafa Churchills new trump card

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: At a time when Mohun Bagan are getting ready to launch their campaign under a match-fit Jose Ramirez Barreto, Churchill Brothers seem to have finally got a player to realize their unfulfilled dream in the national circuit. 

Nigerian striker Odafa Onyeka Okolie has taken the Goan football by storm by scoring 14 goals in 12 matches in the Goa Professional League so far. On Friday, the sparse crowd at the Ambedkar Stadium here were witness to his scoring prowess when he struck twice in Churchills 4-0 win over MEG, Bangalore in the Durand qualifiers. 

While Drupesh Desai and Joseph Martins Louis scored the other two goals, Odafa, as he is popularly known, banged the net with spectacular angular shots. He could have scored a few more, but missed some easy opportunities. 

While people in Goan football believe that Odafa could be the states answer to Barreto in the next national league, the tall Nigerian laughs off any such suggestion. I have seen Barreto playing. Mike Okoro is a friend of mine. I dont like any comparison, but I am ready for the National League. 

Odafas only problem is that he keeps the ball for a longer period and tries to dribble too many. On Friday, it cost Churchill dearly in front of the goal at least twice. But then, his first goal of the day came after dribbling past three defenders followed by an accurate shot. 

Yes, I love to dribble, said the former Muktijoddha striker. Its not that I am selfish. But thats the way I like to play, he said. 

Churchills Moroccan coach Karim Bencherifa agreed that a prolific goalgetter like Odafa could be Churchills trump card in the NFL, but he was not ready to commit on his teams prospects. 

I havent seen teams like Mohun Bagan, East Bengal or Mahindra. I can only comment after watching them in the Durand, he said.

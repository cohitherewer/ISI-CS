 Beijing: College students will provide back-up to the police forces to ensure fool-proof security for the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games.

 About 400 students, including 88 girls, who will graduate from Beijing-based universities this summer participated in a sports test held by the Beijing special police corps.

 ?Those who pass the physical test are eligible for further psychological and cultural examinations and the competent students will be recruited into the city?s armed police forces,? said Wang Zhaoguang, an officer with the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau said.

 The recruitment campaign is set to finish in early July, and the selected graduates will undergo professional training. It is the first time that university students have been enlisted in the police forces in Beijing. Beijing also plans to add 2,000 police officers to meet security requirements for the event.

 Paris: Australian Open champion Amelie Mauresmo will lead France in their Fed Cup first round tie against Italy later this month, the French tennis federation announced on Tuesday. The world No. 1 has been selected by captain Georges Goven to play alongside Nathalie Dechy, Emilie Loit and Virginie Razzano, while Mary Pierce and Tatiana Golovin miss the tie through injury.

 ?Mary Pierce has been suffering from an inflamed foot since the start of the season,? Goven said.

 Golovin, meanwhile, picked up an ankle injury during her Nasdaq-100 Open semi-final against Russias Maria Sharapova last month.

 The tie will be played on April 22-23 in Nancy, eastern France. France have won the women?s team event twice, but were beaten by Russia in the last two finals. 

 Rio de Janeiro: Former Brazil coach Tele Santana, who has been in serious condition with a intestinal infection since March 25, suffered a further deterioration on Monday, a hospital statement said.

 The Felicio Rocho hospital in Belo Horitzonte said Santana, who also suffered a lung infection last week before showing a slight improvement at the weekend, again had a high temperature. ?The condition was relatively stable until this morning... when he developed a significant fever, probably as a result of a new lung infection,? the hospital said.

 UP thrash Sialkot, lift crown

 - R.P. Singh (4/26) bundles out visitors for 112 

Dharamshala: Fast bowler Rudra Pratap Singh underlined his potential with a four-wicket haul as Ranji Trophy champions Uttar Pradesh lifted the inaugural Mohammed Nissar Trophy with a huge 316-run win over Pakistans national cricket champions Sialkot here on Saturday. 

After setting a mammoth target of 429, Uttar Pradesh dismissed the visitors for 112 in 35.5 overs to wrap up an early win at the HPCA Stadium. 

The result seemed to be a foregone conclusion as the injury-battered Sialkot team was without two of its main batsmen captain Imran Nazir and wicketkeeper Khalid Hafeez and speedster Mohammed Asif who left for Pakistan due to fitness worries. 

After declaring their second innings at 373 for seven in the morning, it was only a matter of time for the home bowlers to pack off the demoralised visiting side. 

Sialkot captain Nazir said the unavailability of some key players cost them the match. 

Rudra Pratap was the star of the show on Saturday, sending back Mansoor Amjad, Abdur Rehman, Shoaib Malik and Sarfaraz Ahmed while giving away only 26 runs in the 9.5 overs. 

The biggest stand for Sialkot came from the combine of Shehzad Malik (31 not out) and Tahir Mughal (24). They added 45 runs for the fifth wicket before left-arm seamer Salabh Srivasatva broke the partnership just after the lunch by scalping Mughal. 

Shehzad and Shoaib Malik then added 23 runs for the sixth wicket and tried to put up a semblance of fight.

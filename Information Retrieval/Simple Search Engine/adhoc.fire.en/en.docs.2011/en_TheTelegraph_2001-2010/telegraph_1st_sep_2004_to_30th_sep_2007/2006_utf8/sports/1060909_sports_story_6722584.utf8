Singapore: Shiv Kapur underlined his growing maturity with a fighting two-under 69 that put him in tied sixth in the Barclays Singapore Open at the Serapong Golf Club on Friday. 

Kapur finds himself at the same score as defending champion and world No. 6 Adam Scott, just three behind joint-leaders Ernie Els (65) and Scott Strange (69) at the midway stage of the event. 

Keep it in the middle of the fairway. You have got to be very patient and take your medicine. If you hit it in the rough take your medicine and take a wedge, hack out and do not try and be too fancy, the Indian said on his approach on the tough course. 

Three indians positioned themselves in the top-10 and a total of six made the cut at the event with $ 3 m at stake. 

Jyoti Randhawa (73) and Arjun Singh (67) were tied 10th at one-under 141 and S.S.P. Chowrasia shot an even par 71 to be one-over 143 and tied 27th. 

Gaurav Ghei (71) was tied 41st and Jeev Milkha Singh, leader on the Asian Tour Order of Merit, survived a disastrous round of 76 with four bogeys in last five holes and at five-over, endured an agonising wait before finding out that he still had work over the weekend. 

In the morning, top draw Els displayed some superb golf, including an amazing chip-in from ankle deep rough on the par-5 fifth hole. 

In the afternoon, Aussie Strange, battled his way through a severe backache to take a share of the lead. He shot seven birdies and five bogeys but walked gingerly and was careful not to strain his back while picking the ball out of the cup. 

Els had five birdies, an eagle and his only blemish was a bogey on third. 

 Missing the cut were Rahil Gangjee 

 (77-74), Digvijay Singh (77-74), Uttam Singh Mundy (77-74), 

 Harmeet Kahlon (73-79) and Gurbaaz Mann (73-88). Amandeep 

 Johl withdrew in the morning with a severe backache.

 Miandad tears into Hair

Islamabad: Pakistans former Test cricketers were shocked after Malcolm Speed revealed that umpire Darrell Hair had offered to resign if the International Cricket Council (ICC) paid the Australian umpire $500,000. 

Its shocking news to me, when I saw the press conference of Speed live on television, said Intikhab Alam. I am simply in shock. 

Former fast bowler Sarfraz Nawaz raised doubts as to whether Hair had evidence against Inzamam-ul Haq. 

Hair must have thought that if he failed to provide an evidence against Inzamam, he could be barred for life from officiating in international matches, Sarfraz said. 

He felt it would be better for Hair to come out in public and apologise.Javed Miandad, who captained and coached the national team, was surprised that ICC made Hairs letter public and termed the Australian umpires demand as worst thing to happen in umpiring history. 

It was supposed to be a confidential letter that Hair wrote to the ICC. I simply fail to understand why Speed made it public, Miandad said. 

Former Pakistan Cricket Board chief executive Arif Abbasi told a private television channel that Hairs demand of money clearly showed that he had no motive of conducting the match fairly. 

It makes no sense. On one hand he is saying that Pakistan players were guilty of ball tampering, and now he is saying that he is resigning if he is paid, Abbasi said. I think his objective was to just make money and nothing else. (AP)

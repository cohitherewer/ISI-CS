Moenchengladbach: India conceded a last minute goal to launch their World Cup hockey campaign with a heartbreaking 2-3 defeat against defending champions Germany here on Wednesday. 

The spirited Indians were level 2-2 till the dying minutes of the opening pool B match before Christopher Zellers brilliant deflection just at the stroke of the hooter sealed their fate at the Warsteiner Hockey Park. 

Shivendra Singh (55th and 65th minutes) brought India back into the match after the Germans took lead twice through goals by Zeller (26th) and Oliver Hentschel (58th). 

The Indians did well to shed their defensive garb of the first-half to knock in two goals through Shivendra, but the past revisited them when they conceded a late goal that cost them three points. 

In the last quarter of the first-half, the Germans enjoyed more ball possession and applied sustained pressure that fetched them their only penalty corner of the session. Zeller was on mark with a powerful flick to the right of goalkeeper Adrian DSouza. 

Two minutes to the break, India had their best chance when an Arjun Halappa attempt came off goalkeeper Christian Bubloz and Hari Prasad failed to get to the ball. 

Almost immediately, the Indians were reduced to 10 men when defender Kanwalpreet Singh was sent off on yellow card suspension. 

India began the second-half on a strong note, attacking at every opportunity. In fact, for the first time in the match, they held the upper hand to force Germany on the defensive. 

The Indian forwards wove some pretty moves on the wings, but could not succeed until the 54th minute when they forced first of two penalty corners in succession. 

A fast left-wing attack saw Shivendra inside the circle but was obstructed by goalkeeper Bubloz leading to a penalty corner. Kanwalpreets direct hit came off the goalkeeper and into a defender for another penalty corner. 

This time, it was almost a repeat, with Kanwalpreet and then Halappa with the rebound failing to score. The ball rolled to Shivendra who made no mistake for the equaliser. 

Under pressure, the Germans looked vulnerable, but on a counter-attack, forced their second penalty corner that Hentschel converted to put the hosts 2-1 up. 

The Indians kept their composure and continued to attack. A brilliant move involving Tushar Khandkar and Shivendra in the 65th minute saw the latter finding the boards with the goalkeeper beaten by the one-touch passing bout. 

However, the Germans delivered the killer blow in the last minute when Zeller dived headlong to deflect Matthias Witthaus reverse hit for the match-winner.

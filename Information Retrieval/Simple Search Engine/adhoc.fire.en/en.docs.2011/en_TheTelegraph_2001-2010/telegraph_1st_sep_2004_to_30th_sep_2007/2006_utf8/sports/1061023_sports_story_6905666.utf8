 Sharapova crowned champion

Zurich: US Open champion Maria Sharapova claimed her fourth title of the year on Sunday by beating unseeded Slovak Daniela Hantuchova 6-1, 4-6, 6-3 in the final of the Zurich Open. 

It was Sharapovas first title in Zurich, after she finished as runner-up to Alicia Molik in 2004. 

The victory, achieved with the loss of just one set all week, added to the Indian Wells, San Diego and US titles she earned earlier this year. 

Although the second-seeded Russian will remain at No. 3 in the rankings next week behind Amelie Mauresmo and Justine Henin-Hardenne, the win boosted her chances of ending the season as world No. 1. 

Sharapova was far more aggressive than Hantuchova in the opening set, especially with her returns, and she pressured the Slovak from the start. Hantuchova had to hold off three break points in the first game and then dropped her serve to love, hitting consecutive double-faults, to fall behind 2-1. 

After calling her mother to court as her coach, allowed under rules being tried out in Zurich, Hantuchova was far more positive in the second set, breaking Sharapova for 1-0. 

Hantuchova fought off five break points at 5-4 to take the match to a deciding set.

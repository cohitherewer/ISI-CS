 India's tour of South Africa 

 Makhaya Ntini

Bangalore/Durban: Rahul Dravid on Friday said Team India are looking forward to play good cricket on their upcoming tour of South Africa. 

Its going to be important series for us... Its going to be good, tough cricket. As a team, we are looking forward to it, Dravid said. 

India will play five ODIs and three Tests. The first ODI match is to be played in Johannesburg on November 19. 

South Africas fast bowling spearhead Makhaya Ntini has targeted the series against India for redemption following their failure to reach the Champions Trophy final. 

He said he did not believe the team had choked against the West Indies in the semi-finals. Its just one of the days when the match didnt go our way, he said in Durban. I want to concentrate my efforts for the forthcoming tours against India and Pakistan. 

The entire team is determined that we will not allow the disappointment of Champions Trophy to interfere with our plans to prepare for the matches against India and Pakistan and finally for the World Cup next year. 

We have a very good side and are capable of toppling any side in the world. We have the team to bring back the World Cup (PTI)

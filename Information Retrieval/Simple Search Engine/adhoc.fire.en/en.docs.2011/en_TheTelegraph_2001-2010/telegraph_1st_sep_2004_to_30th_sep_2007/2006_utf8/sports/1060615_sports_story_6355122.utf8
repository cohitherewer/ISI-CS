 Roberts flays Collins selection

Gros Islet: Former West Indies fast bowler Andy Roberts feels India are no better than Brian Laras side when it comes to the quality of their bowling attack. 

 India are struggling bowling wise. All West Indies need to do is to bat properly, because India do not have a good bowling attack, just like ours, remarked Roberts. 

 Roberts also felt that picking Pedro Collins for the second cricket Test was a mistake. 

 I find it strange that people coming back from a year off, being injured, and with only one first-class game, youre brought back to play a five-day Test match. That should not happen, he was quoted as saying by local media. 

 Roberts said being a fast bowler, Collins should have been tested before being included in the squad. Especially if the player is a fast bowler. You need to be able to play a couple games so we can see how much you recover after one game. 

Im not saying who should be included. I just know that it is unfortunate that we choose a player who has been off the international scene for a year, because of injury, and he comes straight back into the team, Roberts concluded. (PTI)

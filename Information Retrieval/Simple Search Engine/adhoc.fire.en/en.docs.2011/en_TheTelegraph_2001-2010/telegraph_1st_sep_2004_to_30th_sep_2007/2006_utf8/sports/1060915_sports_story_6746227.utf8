 PCB move

Karachi: Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) could have a new paid selection committee in place by early next month after the proposal was approved at a recent meeting of the Boards ad-hoc committee. 

The Board has had a system of appointing honorary selectors but the committee felt strongly that time had come to have full-time paid selectors.

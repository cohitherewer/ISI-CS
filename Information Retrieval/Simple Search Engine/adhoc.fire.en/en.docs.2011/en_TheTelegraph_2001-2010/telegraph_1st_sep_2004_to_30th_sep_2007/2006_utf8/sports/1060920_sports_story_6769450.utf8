The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Bhowmick wary of Bhutia

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: For Subhas Bhowmick, the 2-4 loss to East Bengal was an accident and its time to take one final shot at the Premier Division title. 

I always believe in two words success and failure in my dictionary. For me, the league is not finished, Bhowmick said on Tuesday, the eve of Mohammedan Sportings match against Mohun Bagan. However, he once again flayed the IFA for unscientific scheduling of matches for his team. 

Okoro skipped the practice, but he would play. Its also likely that Douglas da Silva would be given his choice of playing in midfield, instead of a defender. 

According to Bhwomick, Bhaichung Bhutia would be a factor. We should be worried about any team which have players like Bhaichung, he said. 

Mohun Bagan coach Biswajit Bhattacharya, on the other hand, felt that his side was improving day by day.

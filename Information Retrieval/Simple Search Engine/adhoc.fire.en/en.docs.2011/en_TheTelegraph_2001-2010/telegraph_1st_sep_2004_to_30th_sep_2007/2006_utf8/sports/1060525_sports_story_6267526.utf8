 Inzy wants practice ties for Shoaib

Islamabad: Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq has suggested a few practice matches during the ongoing training camp to help Shoaib Akhtar prove his fitness for his comeback for the England tour. 

Inzamam believes Shoaib is just 70-80 per cent fit and the practice games could prove beneficial for the pacer whom he rates as Pakistans trump card against England. 

Shoaib has been out of the team for some time and is now trying to regain full fitness. But such things take some time and a lot of effort, Inzamam was quoted by a Pakistani daily on Wednesday. 

Shoaib is currently working on regaining match fitness after recovering from a knee injury. (PTI)

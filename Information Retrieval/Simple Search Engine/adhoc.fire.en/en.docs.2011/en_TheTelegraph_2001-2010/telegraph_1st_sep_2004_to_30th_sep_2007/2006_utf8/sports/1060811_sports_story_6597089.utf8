The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 India to analyse Saudi-Tunisia match 

 Asian Cup Qualifier

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta: The India campers 

 had their first light day in the build-up to Wednesdays 

 AFC Asian Cup qualifier against Saudi Arabia at Salt Lake 

 Stadium. There was no workout at the ground, all activity 

 was indoors.

 The players had their gym session 

 in the morning. In the afternoon, there was a team meeting 

 where coach Bob Houghton said what needs to be done against 

 the formidable opponents and what he expected from the players.

 It was a short and sweet 

 session lasting about 25-30 minutes during which the coach 

 explained the method we should follow against Saudi Arabia, 

 said a satisfied Bhaichung Bhutia.

 Most players appreciated Houghtons 

 short, businesslike team meeting, unlike the ones conducted 

 by his predecessors which often turned out to be long-drawn, 

 boring affairs.

 On Friday, the players will be 

 shown Saudi Arabias match versus Tunisia. Highlights 

 of that World Cup first round game have been made available 

 to the team management.

 The match between Saudi Arabia 

 and Tunisia was ended in a 2-2 draw. 

 The coach has already watched 

 the cassette with his support staff, tomorrow hell 

 sit with the players to analyse the Saudi Arabia team, 

 manager Pradeep Chowdhury said, adding that eight or nine 

 players of the World Cup squad are coming to Calcutta.

 The coach will have the 

 Saudi Arabia list when he views the cassette with his players 

 tomorrow that will help identify and analyse the opponents.

 Saudi Arabia will land in the 

 city on Sunday a day before India are expected to announce 

 their final squad.

 However, it will be interesting 

 to note who will lead the side. In absence of Bhaichung, 

 the honour went to S. Venkatesh. But with Bhaichung back, 

 putting to rest speculation over his retirement plans, the 

 team management may hand over the captains armband 

 again to him. 

 Its not an issue at 

 all, Venkatesh maintained.

 The Pawar theory

New Delhi: BCCI president Sharad Pawar on Friday reminded fans, angered by the Durban humiliation, that this was the same team which had done so well just a few months ago. 

Pawar admitted there was a lot of scope for improvement, but said lack of enough warm-up matches may have had a bearing on the result. 

Its true that their performance was not up to the mark... But one should not forget that it is the same team, same captain and same coach who had produced extremely good results in Pakistan and the West Indies. (PTI)

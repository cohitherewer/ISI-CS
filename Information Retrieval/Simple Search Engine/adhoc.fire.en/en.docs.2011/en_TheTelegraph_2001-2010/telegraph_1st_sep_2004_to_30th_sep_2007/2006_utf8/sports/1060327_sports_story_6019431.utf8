 Australia surge unabated on final day

Melbourne: The Australian gold medal surge continued unabated in the final day of the Commonwealth Games on Sunday as they threatened the all-time record. 

Natalie Bates broke clear to win the womens cycling road race and Natalie Grinham and Joseph Kneipp won the squash mixed doubles title, defeating Englands Vicky Botwright and James Willstrop 6-9, 9-6, 9-5, 9-6 in the final. 

The womens doubles squash gold won next up by the Grinham sisters, Natalie and Rachael, was the 82nd for the Australians, matching the number they won at Manchester four years ago, but still five short of the 87-strong haul in Victoria in 1994. 

The Grinhams hit back from a one set deficit to defeat New Zealanders Shelley Kitchen and Tamsyn Leevey 1-9, 9-4, 9-3, 9-3. 

Australias hockey team outplayed Pakistan 3-0 in a bruising, ill-tempered mens final on Sunday to claim their third successive gold medal and a double Commonwealth Games success for the hosts. 

Penalty corner goals in each half by Liam De Young and Luke Doerner gave Australia a 2-0 lead before captain Jamie Dwyer put the match beyond doubt for the Olympic champions when he pirouetted past two defenders to score. Pakistans Tariq Aziz was sent off in the second half after raising his stick in an off-play incident which flattened Australian midfielder Rob Hammond. 

Australia dominated on the playing field, winning 84 gold medals, while England finished second with 36 golds ahead of Canada (26), India (22), South Africa (12) and Scotland (11). 

Malaysia made it three out of five badminton titles, with wins in the mens singles and womens doubles, while there were more success for the Malaysians in the mens field hockey bronze when their side defeated England 2-0. 

In the womens road race a brilliant tactical display by Bates, who broke for home with just over two of the nine laps to go, brought her glory in the lush settings of Melbournes Royal Botanical Gardens. 

Her compatriot, the world No.1, Oenone Wood, outlasted a gallant Nicole Cooke of Wales in a sprint for the finish line to claim silver and bronze, respectively ? 3min 05sec behind the winner.

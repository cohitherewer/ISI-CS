 UP break 72-yr-old jinx

 - RANJI FINAL Kaif (109) shuts door on Bengal 

A CORRESPONDENT

Lucknow: Uttar Pradesh kept their date with destiny on Thursday by clinching the Ranji Trophy for the first time in their 72-year association with the tournament. 

The five-day final with Bengal ended in a draw at the K.D. Singh Babu Stadium here, but the 14-run first-innings lead enabled Mohammed Kaif and his boys to lay their hands on the coveted trophy. UP had been in the final thrice before, losing their last two title-round clashes to Karnataka. 

Champions UP received Rs 7 lakh, while Bengal earned Rs 3 lakh. 

The UP skipper led from the front, scoring 92 and 109 to frustrate the Bengal attack. Kaif and Suresh Raina (52) warmed up nicely for the ODI series in Pakistan, putting on 95 for the third wicket as UP stretched their second innings to 342. Set 357 for an outright win with very little time left, Bengal went through the motions to reach 109 for five before play was called off at the end of the fifth mandatory over in the final hour. 

Kaif, after hitting nine boundaries and two huge sixes, gifted his wicket to substitute Ranadeb Bose. Raina hit half-dozen fours before being stumped by Deep Dasgupta. Amir Khan (28 off 96 balls) and the experienced Rizwan Shamshad (33 off 73 balls) then held fort in a patient partnership. After their departure, the UP innings folded quickly. 

Part-time opener Sourashish Lahiri departed to the first ball of the second over, edging Praveen Kumar to the keeper. 

Avishek Jhunjhunwala (0), Rohan Gavaskar (5) and Manoj Tewari (1) made a beeline for the dressing room as Kumar completed a five-wicket haul. At 54 for five, it looked like UP were in a with a chance to notch up an outright victory. It was left to captain Deep to drop anchor and help his team salvage some pride. 

Deep fined 

There was bad news for Deep after the match too, as he was fined 100 per cent of his match fee for saying that a few umpiring decisions had cost Bengal in the first innings. 

If he (Deep) repeats this offence during the next 12 months, he will be liable for a five-match suspension, said Match Referee Manu Nayyar. 

Nayyar also issued warning to Bengal off-spinner Saurashish Lahiri and UP batsman Shamshad Rizwan for showing dissent after getting out.

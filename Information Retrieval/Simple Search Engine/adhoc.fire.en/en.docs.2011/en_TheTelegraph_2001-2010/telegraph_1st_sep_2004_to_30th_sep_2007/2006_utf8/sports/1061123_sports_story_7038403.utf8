 Second goal killed all plans: Carlos

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: Carlos Pereira is down but definitely not out. The four-goal blitz by JCT against his team has erased the usual smile on his face, but the Brazilian coach was not ready to accept that faulty team selection was one of the reasons behind defeat. 

It was one of those bad days, he said after the match. The second goal killed all my plans. There was no chance for recovery after that. 

Pereira refused to accept that Bibiano Fernandes and Freddy Mascarenhas were total flops. I still consider them as good players. So I persisted with them. Alvito (DCunha) of course was not fully fit to play for 90 minutes. But I had no other option. 

As a handful of East Bengal supporters from the upper tires of the stadium heaped abuses on the players and the team management for their choice of foreigners, Carlos defended the two Brazilians saying both of them are not as bad as they are made into. 

Daniel is a good player, so is Thiago. They need time to adjust with the team and the conditions. But then, as I said before, we are not yet fully prepared. We need to train more to attain our best.

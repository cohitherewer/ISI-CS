The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Stage set for Sundays Derby 

 SRIMAX

 Prakash

 Mysore: Punters here have witnessed a complete dominance of the gold-and-brown-belt col-ours during the entire season, and Sundays Classic, the Poonawalla Mysore Derby, may not be an exception.

 The blue riband event of the regular season does not, therefore, evince much interest among racegoers as there is nothing to look forward to beyond Real Excellence, a Robert Foley-trainee. The three-year-old filly, by Steinbeck out of Allaire, has not done anything wrong in her last four starts, and is expected to continue with her winning streak. More importantly, she taking on a mediocre set of rivals and B. Prakash is going to have an easy ride.

 Real Excellence has had a lung-opener in the 1000 Guineas which she won the way she liked.

 She is also the highest-rated runner in the field of eight and her Derby preparations indicate that she is bestowed with power to stay the trip easily. Her morning workouts also confirm that she is in pink of condition. The-refore, she is expected to romp home without much difficulty to add her owner, MAM Rama-swamys, already overflowing kitty of Classic wins.

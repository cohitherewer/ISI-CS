The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Ricky Ponting calls to apologise 

 - Matter is closed as far as BCCI is concerned, says president Sharad Pawar 

 Sharad Pawar with the Australians at the Champions Trophy presentation ceremony 

 Melbourne/New Delhi: 

 Bowing to the wave of criticism following their behaviour 

 after winning the Champions Trophy, Australia captain Ricky 

 Ponting and Cricket Australia (CA) on Thursday apologised 

 for incident in which BCCI president Sharad Pawar was nudged 

 off the Champions Trophy presentation dais.

 On a day Australian press carried 

 stinging comments by Pawar that the behaviour of Ponting 

 and his men was totally uncivilised, the Aussie 

 captain rang up Pawar and expressed his regrets.

 Ponting told Pawar that there has been no intention to disrespect 

 anyone as all the Australian players respected him. Since 

 the matter was reported in the Australian press too, he 

 thought it fit to speak to him personally and explain his 

 position.

 BCCI sources said Pawar told 

 Ponting that he had not made an issue of it and that the 

 BCCI had not lodged any official protest with Cricket Australia. 

 The matter is closed as far as the BCCI is concerned, Pawar 

 said.

 [When The Telegraph contacted 

 Pawar on his cellphone for more details of the conversation, 

 he said he was in the middle of a function 

 and that vice-president Rajeev Shukla would do the needful. 

 Till late at night, though, his cell was off. Ponting, one 

 understands, called between 5 and 6 pm.] 

 Cricket Australia, it may be noted, 

 had sent a letter to Pawar tendering an apology for the 

 entire episode and also wanted to know when it would be 

 convenient for Ponting could call him. 

 According to an Australian newspaper, 

 Ponting tried to contact Pawar at least a dozen of times 

 on Thursday morning, but all his efforts went in vain. 

 Earlier, another Australian newspaper 

 quoted Pawar as saying on Thursday that I will not 

 react to this other than to say it was totally uncivilised. 

 This is not good at all 

 but I have decided to play it down because we have an extremely 

 good relationship with the Australian board and we would 

 like to keep that going.

 Pawar, also the Union agriculture 

 minister, objected to the players rushing onto the dais 

 at the awards function and sought an apology from the Australian 

 players, the paper reported.

 Those players were not 

 allowed to come onto the dais. It was only supposed to be 

 the captain. Certainly, I would accept an apology because 

 then we could close this chapter. The Australian board is 

 headed by a respected and civilised man (James Sutherland) 

 and our relationship is extremely good. If they apologise, 

 it would be a good signal to the people of this country, 

 Pawar said.

 TV footage showed Ponting gesturing 

 at Pawar asking him to hand over the trophy quickly and 

 Damien Martyn then pushing him away.

 The incident enraged former and 

 present Indian cricketers, including Sunil Gavaskar and 

 Sachin Tendulkar. Besides, the NCP, the political party 

 headed by Pawar, also launched a protest against Ponting 

 amp; Co.

 Meanwhile, Ponting said at the 

 launch of his book Captains Diary on Thursday morning 

 that I think the public have probably had an opportunity 

 today to have a look at the incident (on television).

 I hadnt seen it 

 until this morning myself. It doesnt look great on 

 television, but I think the more times you look at it, you 

 probably realise that theres no intent to offend 

 anybody, he said, adding we all probably got 

 a little bit caught up in the excitement of the moment.

 Martyn also tendered an apology 

 to Pawar for his behaviour. I did not mean to offend 

 him and I apologise if I did so, he told a Sydney-based 

 newspaper.

 There was nothing in it 

 other than my trying to help him out as there was a crush 

 of people, he said.

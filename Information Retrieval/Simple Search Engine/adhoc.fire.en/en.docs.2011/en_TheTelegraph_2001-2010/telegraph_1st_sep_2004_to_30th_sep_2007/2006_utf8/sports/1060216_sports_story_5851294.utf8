London: An 87th-minute strike by substitute Luis Garcia earned Liverpool a 1-0 victory over Arsenal in the Premier League on Tuesday, bringing them to within three points of second-placed Manchester United. 

Arsenal keeper Jens Lehmann was named Man of the Match after keeping Liverpool at bay for most of the game and even saving a 32nd-minute penalty from Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard. 

His heroics came to nothing, however, when Dietmar Hamann thundered in a shot from outside the area and the German goalkeeper could only tip it at the feet of Garcia who knocked it home. 

Arsenal looked out of sorts and out of form and their defeat dropped them 10 points behind Liverpool, who have not finished above the north London side in ten years. 

With 26 games now played by all the leading sides, Chelsea head the table on 66 points, with Manchester United second on 54, Liverpool on 51 and Tottenham Hotspur on 45, four clear of Arsenal. 

Real Madrid, meanwhile, were unable to complete an epic comeback victory over Real Zaragoza despite a storming 4-0 win at the Bernabeu in the return leg of their Kings Cup semi-final on Tuesday. 

Real, who were crushed 1-6 in last weeks first leg, gave Zaragoza an almighty scare as they raced into a 3-0 lead in the first 10 minutes with goals from Brazilian trio Cicinho, Robinho and Ronaldo. 

Yet another Brazilian, Roberto Carlos, made it 4-0 just after the hour with a trademark rocket shot to set up a grandstand finish and Zaragoza looked as though they were about to fold as they struggled to stem the tide of Real attacks. 

But despite a nerve-riddled performance in the final half hour the visitors managed to hang on to their narrow lead and claim a 6-5 aggregate victory that earned them a place in their third Cup final in six seasons. (AGENCIES)

Mamaroneck: The curse of the Winged Foot finally caught up with Jeev Milkha Singh who returned a seven-over 77 and slipped to tied 59th spot after the third round of the US Open Golf Championship here on Saturday. 

Jeevs third round was punctuated with too many dropped shots and too few pars as he struggled on a difficult course that saw world No. 1 Tiger Woods miss the cut on Friday and seemed to get harder and harder with each passing day. 

The Indian, however, was not the only one who found it tough to come to terms with the 7,264-yard, par-70 layout. 

Sharing the 59th position with him were Ben Curtis of the US and Canadas Stephen Gangluff with an overall 16-over 226. 

Three-time Major winner Phil Mickelson and Englands Kenneth Ferrie lead the field with two-over 212. 

Only Mickelson and Japans Ryuji Imada, both coming in with 69s, were able to shoot under par. Australias Geoff Ogilvy was in sole third spot, at three-over 213, while Englishman Ian Poulter, Fijis Vijai Singh, Scotlands Colin Montgomerie and Steve Stricker of the US were in tied fourth place with five-over 215. 

Jeev just could not find the fairway, and failed to reach the greens consistently in regulation. His putting, for once, failed to come to his rescue, though he still held the best average (1.52) over the three rounds. 

Today I did not hit the fairways and that was the reason for my high score. The rough was brutal too, said the Chandigarh pro, playing in his second US Open. (PTI)

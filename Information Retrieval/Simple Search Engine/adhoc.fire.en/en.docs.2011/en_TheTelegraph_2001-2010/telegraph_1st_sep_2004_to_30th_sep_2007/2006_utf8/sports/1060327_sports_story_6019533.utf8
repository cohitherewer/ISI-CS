 Special commitees vision is grand

New Delhi: Besides suggesting changes in the composition of the selection panel, the BCCI special committee for optimum utilisation of resources has made other recommendations as well. 

The committee suggested means to improve the cricketing infrastructure and bring it on a par with worlds best. 

Some of these suggestions can be simply approved by the working committee while some other may need constitutional amendments, I. S. Bindra, chairman of the special committee, said. 

The discussions were fruitful, focussed and meaningful. The players gave various suggestions on how to improve the game, he added. 

The meeting was attended by Kapil Dev, K. Srikkanth, S. Venkatraghavan, M. A. K. Pataudi, apart from Sourav Ganguly and Rahul Dravid. 

Regarding improvement in infrastructure, the players suggested that international standard facilities should be provided from primary school level. 

It should be ensured that right from the grassroot level to primary school, neighbourhood and international level, world class infrastructure should be provided in terms of facilities, he said. There should be academies in each of the five zones providing coaching facilities, it was felt. 

To improve the condition of grounds and pitches, the committee was of the view that the board should tie-up with the Agriculture University for providing courses to curator and ground staff. 

All affiliated units would be given a time frame to develop the infrastructure and subsidy will be given depending upon the facilities that they put up. If the facilities are found to be sub-standard, then they could be penalised also, Bindra said. 

The committee also said strict measures should be taken to improve the standard of umpiring in first class level and sub-standard umpires should be done away with. 

There should be a competent panel of Match Referees and former players and all matches should be recorded. Sub-standard umpires should be weeded out. 

When asked to comment on what Sourav suggested in the meeting, Bindra said, Sourav mainly gave his thoughts on how to improve first class cricket, based on his recent experiences of playing in first class cricket. (Pti)

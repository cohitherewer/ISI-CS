The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Harbhajan better than me: Panesar

London: England spin star Monty Panesar is not going over the moon by his coach Duncan Fletchers flattering remark that he is the best finger spinner in the world, but feels that Daniel Vettori and Harbhajan Singh are better spinners than him. 

Panesar believes it is too early for him to be rated as the best. I think there are other better finger spinners like Vettori and Harbhajan, who have taken more than 200 Test wickets each, he said. 

Its flattering though, because I value his comments, Panesar said. (PTI)

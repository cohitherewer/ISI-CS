Benoni: Comeback men Anil Kumble and Zaheer Khan made a strong statement but India let South Africa A off the hook in the tour opening one-dayer here on Thursday. 

India were 77 for three after 20 overs with Rahul Dravid on 17 and Mahendra Singh Dhoni on 4. Openers Sachin Tendulkar and Wasim Jaffer fell for 5 each, both to Dale Steyn, as India slumped to 12 for two. Mohammed Kaif made 30. 

The Indians failed to deliver the killer punch as South Africa A recovered from a toporder collapse to post a challenging 255 for eight in the day-night clash at the Willowmoore Park Stadium. 

Zaheer (three for 43) and Kumble (two for 31) triggered a middleorder collapse to reduce the hosts to 116 for six but half-centuries from Jacques Rudolph and Albie Morkel got the South Africans out of the hole. 

Rudolph hammered a thunderous 72 not out that came from 53 balls and contained seven fours and two sixes. 

The left-hander added 96 runs for the crucial seventh wicket with Morkel who made an equally pugnacious 57 with five fours and three sixes. 

Thanks to the duos brilliant counter-attack, South Africa A rebounded from losing three wickets in the space of six balls after being placed at 114 for three at one stage. 

Irfan Pathan and Munaf Patel picked one each. 

Kumble took his two wickets off successive balls from the quota of 10 overs bowled in one spell while Zaheer struck when the hosts were just threatening to lay a strong base. 

The form of these two returning seniors eased the creases on the foreheads of Indians who were rattled by a strong base the fourth wicket pair of Neil McKenzie (47) and Ashwell Prince (31) were building for their team. 

Prince, a regular in South Africas Test eleven, lofted one in the covers in order to prop up the falling run-rate and then Kumble snared two off successive deliveries. 

It briefly allowed the visitors a hold on the proceedings before Rudolph and Morkel put them to sword. 

The two paced themselves brilliantly before exploding in the final stretch, Morkel in particular, who smashed 19 runs in Patels eighth over, the 46th of the innings. 

Morkel finally left at 212 in the 47th over, hoiking one in the air from zaheer khan to long on. 

Rudolph, if anything, was more impressive in cracking 72 from 53 balls with seven fours and two sixes. 

India began with Pathan and Patel in their attack, the latter making an early impression with the scalp of Morne van Wyk (7), the top-scorer in one-day competition of South Africa with 588 runs from 11 innings. 

But the pacer from Ikhar was virtually taken to cleaners in the final overs. No different was the fate of Sreesanth who was caned for 62 from his 10 overs, the final one of the innings costing 21 runs.

 Baptista sees a future in England 

Madrid: Arsenals Brazilian attacking midfielder Julio Baptista can see a future for himself in the Premier League, if he is given the chance to adapt to the English game. 

The 25-year-old international moved to London at the end of August in a one-year loan deal from Real Madrid, with Spain forward Jose Antonio Reyes going in the opposite direction. 

However, with both clubs having options to buy the respective players at the end of the season, Baptista has had few chances to prove his worth, making only two league starts so far. 

Arsene Wenger tells me he will wait until I get used to this league, but until I play regularly I wont achieve that, Baptista told a Spanish sports daily on Tuesday. 

The idea is to participate as much as possible and at the end of the year evaluate everything and decide if the positives outweigh the negatives. 

I dont want to be just one more player. I want to help the team. But I can imagine myself being here for a few seasons. 

Considered surplus to requirements at Real in August, Baptista is unsure how he would fit in if he returned to the Bernabeu.

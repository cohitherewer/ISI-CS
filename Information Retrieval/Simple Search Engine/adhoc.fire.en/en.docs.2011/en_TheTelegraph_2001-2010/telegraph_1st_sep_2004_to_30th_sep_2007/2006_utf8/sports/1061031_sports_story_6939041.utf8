 ICC plans global academy 

- Dubai project to begin opetations in 2008 

Chandigarh: Imagine Australia preparing for a future Ashes Series in Dubai or Pakistan holding a training camp ahead of a high-voltage tour in the desert country. 

Such a scenario could become a distinct possibility in a few years time when the International Cricket Councils (ICCs) ambitious project the Global Cricket Academy begins its operations in early 2008. 

The academy, part of the Dubai Sports City Development (DSCD), will cater to every cricketing need and will specialise in not only training the cricketers but umpires, curators and administrators as well. 

Giving details of the project at a press conference on Monday, ICC Chief Executive Officer Malcolm Speed said the facilities will include two international standard grounds, 48 outdoor net pitches, six indoor pitches and state-of-the-art video analyses and medical facilities. 

Speed said the academy would import soil from England, Asia and Australia as part of its mission to offer attendees the chance to experience as wide a range of conditions as possible. 

Former Australian wicketkeeper Rodney Marsh, who is the director of coaching at the academy, said the idea was to make the academy an ideal location for top teams as they prepare for tours. In our days there were no coaches. Cricket is a simple game and you have to do the basics correctly. One has to be careful, there is always the danger of players being over-coached.

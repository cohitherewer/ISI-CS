 Fransa chief keeps players stranded

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: The All India Football Federation (AIFF) may have allowed players of the disbanded Fransa club to switch to other clubs, but it is proving to be of little help to the footballers of the Goan outfit. While at least 10 players are being vigorously pursued by clubs like Salgaocar, Dempo, Churchill, Mahindra and Vasco, the non-cooperative attitude of Fransa chairman Micky Pacheco has left the footballers stranded. 

The AIFF, meanwhile, has extended the Thursday deadline by three days for the players to procure their release, but even that may turn out to be inadequate. 

According to Fransa sources, Pacheco is giving the players a slip every time they are trying to meet him to get the release. On Wednesday morning, the players went to the Fransa House but could not meet Pacheco who was said to be busy with prior commitments. 

The Goa Football Association secretary, Savio Messias said he was aware of the situation, but is helpless. 

Alex Ambrose, who was eager to join Vasco, said: I cannot sit at home for the next two months. We are suffering for no fault of ours. 

Roque Barretto was set to join Mahindra, but was unable to secure a release from the contract which is legally valid till April 30.

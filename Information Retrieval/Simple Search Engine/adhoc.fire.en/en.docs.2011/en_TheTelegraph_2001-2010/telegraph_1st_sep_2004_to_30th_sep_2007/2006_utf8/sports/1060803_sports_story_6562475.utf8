The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Hundreds just around the corner 

 - Im doing all that Im supposed to do: Pietersen 

Leeds: Kevin Pietersen feels a hundred is just around the corner as he bids to join Englands list of century-makers in the ongoing Test series against Pakistan. 

So far, the South Africa-born batsman has had a mediocre time out in the middle, failing to score even a 50 in the three innings that he has played. 

In the drawn series opener at Lords, Paul Collingwood, Andrew Strauss, Alastair Cook and Ian Bell all reached three figures, with Cook and Bell both repeating the feat in Englands innings and 120-run victory in the second Test at Old Trafford. 

The Manchester match, which England won inside three days, also saw fast bowler Stephen Harmison twice take five wickets in an innings, with emerging left-arm spinner Monty Panesar dismissing five of Pakistans top six on the final day. 

Pietersen, in the run-up to the second Test, urged the lesser-known names in the side to compensate for the loss of injured Ashes-winning captain Michael Vaughan and star allrounder Andrew Flintoff. 

Im not really there to shoulder the responsibility of the whole England team, the Hampshire swashbuckler explained. 

And while the likes of England young guns Cook, Bell and Panesar all responded to Pietersens words at Old Trafford, the man himself now wants to make a major contribution in the third Test, which starts at Leeds Headingley ground on Friday. 

Ive missed out in two Test matches now, Pietersen admitted. It would be nice to get a hundred and I know Im training and doing all Im supposed to do to prepare as best I can. 

If it happens it happens, but if it doesnt Im sure its around the corner somewhere, the 26-year-old added. 

Despite his relative lack of success against Pakistan this series, Pietersens overall Test figures remain impressive. 

In 16 matches he has scored 1,350 runs at an average of more than 46 with four hundreds. Nevertheless, six innings have passed since he got to fifty. 

But the previous time Pietersen endured such a run, he ended it in style with a Test-best 158 against Australia at The Oval, that helped England secure the draw it needed to take the Ashes series 2-1. 

The current English Test season saw Pietersen off to a blistering start with back-to-back hundreds against Sri Lanka at Lords and Edgbaston. 

I did get consecutive hundreds a couple of months ago so Im not going to put loads of pressure on myself saying I have to get this or that, he explained. 

Ive been speaking to (Yorkshire bowler) Matthew Hoggard about Headingley and he says it has been a very good wicket all season. 

Hopefully its a good batting track, but with some bounce in it as well like Old Trafford.

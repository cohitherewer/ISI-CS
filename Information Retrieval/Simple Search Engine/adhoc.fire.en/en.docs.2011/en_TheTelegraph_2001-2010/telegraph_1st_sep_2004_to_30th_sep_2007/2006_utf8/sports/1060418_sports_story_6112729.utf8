 Sania drops to 40th spot

New Delhi: Sania Mirzas ranking fell three places to 40th in the WTA tour list released on Monday. 

The 19-year-old, who pulled out of a tour event last week to treat injuries to her wrist, elbow and lower back, has aggregated 516.75 ranking points to remain the highest-ranked Indian on the WTA circuit. 

Despite the spate of injuries, Sania will spearhead Indias campaign in the Fed Cup Asia-Oceania zonal qualifying tie in Seoul from Wednesday. But her ranking could fall further as she is scheduled to take a three-four weeks break after the Fed Cup. 

Sania, however, saw her doubles ranking move another place up to be 39th in world rankings. 

Shikha Uberoi is the next Indian in the singles, ranked 183rd, a loss of three slots. She has gained two spots in the doubles chart to be No. 162. 

Frenchwoman Amelie Mauresmo continues to be world No.1 followed by Belgian Kim Clijsters. Maria Sharapova of Russia climbed a place to third spot at the expense of Justine Henin-Hardenne of Belgium. 

Martina Hingis, making a comeback to the circuit, held on to the 25th spot. 

Among men, Roger Federer continues to occupy the top spot, followed by Rafael Nadal and David Nalbandian.

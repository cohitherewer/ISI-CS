 Chowrasia 

tied 13th

Samui (Thailand): Lu Wen-Teh was on course to retain his Bangkok Airways Open title after taking a three-shot lead while S.S.P. Chowrasia was the best placed among the Indians at tied 13th after the third round at the Santiburi Samui Country Golf Club here on Saturday. 

High winds made negotiating a tough course an even more difficult proposition, with only seven players making par or better at the par-71 layout. 

Digvijay Singh and Amandeep Johl shot respectable 72s, the former lying in tied 20th position and the latter in tied 31st. 

Amritinder Singhs 74 left him with a share of 37th position, along with Gaurav Ghei (78) and Uttam Singh Mundy (76). Jaiveer Virk had a day he would rather forget, his 84 leaving him just one off bottom place. 

Chowrasias round had more bogeys than birdies. He began with a bogey on the opening hole, and followed it up with two more, on the third and sixth, before making the turn with consecutive birdies. 

Chowrasia was even more inconsistent on the back nine. A birdie on the 12th came on the back of two more bogeys, while a dropped shot on the 14th was followed by a birdie, and another dropped shot. (PTI)

 Shiv in tied 35th spot

Kuala Lumpur: Shiv Kapur bounced back in the $1.25 million Maybank Malaysian Open on Friday by shooting four-under 68 and was tied 35th. 

Kapur made up for his first round of par 72, that included a quadruple bogey on Thursday, and was at four under for 36 holes. Also in the same bunch with him was Amandeep Johl, who followed his first round 71 with a 69. 

Jyoti Randhawa was the best Indian at five-under, but he had played only five holes on the second day, before play was stopped due to rain and thunderstorm which played spoilsport for the second day in a row. Play was halted early with 84 players yet to complete their second round. 

Gaurav Ghei (68 in the first round) and Jeev Milkha Singh (72) was yet to start their second round. Harmeet Kahlon (73) also could not start his second round. Rahil Gangjee (73 and 73) shot himself out of the final two rounds and is likely to miss the cut, which could come at two-under or one-under. 

Meanwhile before the storms ended Day II prematurely, two-time defending champion Thongchai Jaidee of Thailand moved into the contention and trailed David Park by one stroke after the Welshman shot a fine 64 for the clubhouse lead on 13-under-par 131. 

Thongchai is bidding to become the first player on the Asian Tour to win three successive titles. 

On the first day Kapur lost a ball after the storm on hole 12. The spotters could not find it five yards short of the green. 

With course very wet, Kapur went back to hit his shot again, after taking a penalty. This time he hit into a green side bunker and got a plugged lie. He ended with an eight on the par-4 hole, but salvaged the day to come back with a 72.

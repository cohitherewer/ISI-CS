 Usha pulls off a surprise

New Delhi: Home favourite Negisetty Usha pulled off a surprise by out-punching world bronze-medallist and Pan-American champion Sandra Bizier in their first round bout of 57 kg class at the World Womens Boxing Championships here on Sunday. 

Kalpana Chowdhry, the world bronze-medallist in 50 kg, gave the home team its first taste of success in the championships by winning her 48kg bout earlier in the day at the Talkatora Indoor Stadium. 

However, disappointment was in store in 60 kg for the hosts as Ibomcha Devi lost to Lucie Bertaud of France 13-23. 

Usha was in attacking mood from the word go, countering every punch of her Canadian opponent to end the first round at 5-5. 

The Kerala pugilist, making her maiden appearance in the world meet, mostly scored with straight punches to lead 12-8 after Round 2 and carried on with the consistent show to romp home 20-14. (PTI)

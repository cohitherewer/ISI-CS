 Randhawa misses cut

Malmo: Three bogeys in four holes on the second nine resulted in Jyoti Randhawa missing the cut at the Entercard Scandinavian Masters. 

With rounds of 75 and 73, Randhawa ended at four-over and in tied 116th place. At one stage, the Indian seemed close to making the cut when he made the turn at two-under after starting from the 10th tee. 

But Randhawa bogeyed the first, third and fourth and even the birdie on fifth did not help as he finished the second round in one-over 73 for a four-over total of 148. He missed the cut by two shots. 

Mark Roe shared the lead with Nicolas Colsaerts. (PTI)

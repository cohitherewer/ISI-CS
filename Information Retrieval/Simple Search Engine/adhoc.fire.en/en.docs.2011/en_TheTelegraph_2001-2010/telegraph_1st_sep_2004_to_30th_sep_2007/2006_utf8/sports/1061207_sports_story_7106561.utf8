 Anju best hope for gold 

 - Under-par Indians take the field today 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Pinki Pramanik is expected to bag a medal in the 400m 

Doha: With a cloud of doping charges hovering over Indian athletics after the controversy surrounding discus thrower Seema Antil, the squad, it seems, lacks both confidence and depth on the eve of the Asian Games athletics events that start here on Thursday. 

In the last Asian Games in Busan, India were one of the leading lights on the athletics tracks as they won seven gold medals. But going by current performances, a repeat show at the gigantic Khalifa Stadium is highly unlikely. While from Thursday the stadium will surely become the domain of the Chinese men and women, India would find it hard to live up to their past glory. 

Once again Indias best hope for a gold medal would be seasoned long jumper Anju Bobby George, though there is every possibility of the defending champion being pipped at the post by her Japanese or Chinese rivals. 

Anju, a bronze medallist at the world championships and considered an icon of Indian athletics since then, had a rather mediocre season this years by her own standards. Her best came during the Commonwealth Games in Melbourne, where she jumped 6.54 metres. Anju is currently ranked fifth in Asia. 

The problem with the current lot of Indian athletes is that none of them tops the charts in Asia at the moment, barring the 4x400 metre womens relay team, which is almost sure to fetch gold. It timed 3:38.01 in the Commonwealth Games, but that was nine months ago. Since then, runners like Satti Geetha or Manjit Kaur are not in the best of form, yet they are highly favoured to hit gold along with Pinki Pramanik and Chitra Soman. 

Unlike the last time, there is no event where India can be called overwhelming favourites. Bengal girl Pinki had been doing exceptionally well throughout the season and won a series of titles at the Asian Grand Prix in Bangkok, Bangalore and Pune. 

The Athletics Federation of India (AFI) has decided not to field Pinki in the 800 metre and instead enter her for the 400. While some saw it as yet another attempt to deny the Bengal girl her rightful place, the AFI it was trying to help Pinki save energy for the 400 where she is expected to bring medal.

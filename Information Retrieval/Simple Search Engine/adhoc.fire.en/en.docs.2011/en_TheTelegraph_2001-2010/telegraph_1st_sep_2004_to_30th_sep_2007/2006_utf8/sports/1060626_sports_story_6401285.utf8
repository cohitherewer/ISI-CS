The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 German system could suit us: Scaloni

 Herzogenaurach: Germany 

 will be hard to beat as World Cup hosts, but their more 

 direct style may play into Argentinas hands when they 

 meet in the quarter final in Berlin on Friday, Argentine 

 players said.

 Germany have a system that they are faithful to until 

 the death and that could suit us well, defender Lionel 

 Scaloni said on Sunday.

 Scaloni, who replaced the injured Nicolas Burdisso when 

 Argentina beat Mexico 2-1 after extra time in the second 

 round on Saturday, compared Germanys style with the 

 Mexicans.

 Few teams have as many tactical options (as Mexico), 

 he said of Argentinas difficulties in overcoming their 

 Latin American rivals in Leipzig.

 Captain Juan Pablo Sorin believes Juergen Klinsmanns 

 team doesnt fit the typical German stereotype.

 Theyre quite an attacking side for Germany, 

 coming round the outside with two fast wings, central defenders 

 who come through the middle and the best left back of the 

 tournament, who is (Philipp) Lahm, said Sorin, a left 

 back himself.

 Scaloni added: They have (Michael) Ballack in the 

 middle, but coming through like a media punta 

 (attacking midfielder in the hole behind the strikers).

 They are the home side and have the responsibility 

 of showing their people that they can win the Cup, 

 he said.

 Sorin added, however, that there was no point in comparing 

 the two German vintages or Argentinas present team 

 with the 2002 side that made a shock first-round exit in 

 Asia.

 Sorin also said he did not believe Germany would have any 

 home advantage as far as the refereeing was concerned.

 Sincerely, we have full trust in the refereeing and 

 in Fifa, and dont believe there will be anything strange.

 Sorin said Argentinas 3-2 victory over West Germany 

 in the 1986 final in Mexico, when he was eight years old, 

 was a match that marked our lives as fans and now 

 as players in the national team.

 Whatever the Argentines may think of the German side, most 

 of the world is seeing this encounter as a mini final. 

 The biggest game of this thrilling championship has come 

 11 days too soon. Sorry, Brazil, Italy, England et al. But 

 right now, this should be the final.

 The fact the final is in Berlin is another motivational 

 goal for the Germans, who have never played a championship 

 game in their capital.

 Germany have won three world and three European titles in 

 big cities all around Europe. When the events were held 

 on home soil, however, the finals had to be in Munich because 

 Berlin was a divided city before unification in 1991.

 Whoever wins in Berlin on Friday should also make it to 

 the other final.

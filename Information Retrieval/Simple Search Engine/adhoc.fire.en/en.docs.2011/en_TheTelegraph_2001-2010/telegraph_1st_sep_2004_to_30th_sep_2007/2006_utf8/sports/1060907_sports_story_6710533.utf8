 Anju out of top-10

New Delhi: Anju Bobby Georges less than impressive form this season has pushed her outside the top ten in world womens long jump rankings as the latest charts see her fall six places to No. 14. 

The lanky Keralite, who won gold at the recent SAF Games in Colombo, has failed to shine at the elite level and will not feature at the world athletics finals in Stuttgart, and the athletics World Cup in Athens this month. 

Anju won the silver at the world finals in Monaco last year. Injury and poor form has dogged her this year and she will have to get her act together quickly if she hopes to defend the Asian Games gold medal in Doha in December. 

Spains Concepcion Montaner (ninth), American Tianna Madison (10th), Ukraines Viktoriya Rybalko (12th), Britains Kelly Sotherton and US Rose Richmond (14th) gained one spot each at Anjus expense. The top of the rankings remains dominated by Russians with Tatyana Kotova, Tatyana Lebedeva and Oksana Udmurtova occupying the first three spots.

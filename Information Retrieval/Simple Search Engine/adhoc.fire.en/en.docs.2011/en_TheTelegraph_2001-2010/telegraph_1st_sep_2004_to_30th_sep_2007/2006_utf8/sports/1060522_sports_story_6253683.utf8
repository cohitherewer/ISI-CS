The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Salgaocars exit may hit NFL hard 

JAYDEEP BASU 

 Savio Medeira 

New Delhi: For Goan football, Saturday proved to be a black day when its most glamorous and popular outfit, Salgaocar Sports Club were relegated from the National Football League (NFL). The pitch at the Nehru Stadium in Margao had been witness to many an ups and downs, but none perhaps was as disastrous as the one on Saturday evening when Mohammedan Sporting handed out a humiliating defeat to Goas most respected and traditional powerhouse. 

But those who are in the know of things are shocked, but not surprised. The Goa football Association (GFA) secretary, Savio Messias felt he was simply expecting it. I personally consider it as a huge loss for Goan football, but the way things were moving, the relegation was very much in line, he told The Telegraph. 

While Messias said Salgaocars ouster can very much hamper the gate sales of the NFL in his state next season, another club official said Salgaocar took things too lightly and failed to read the writing on the wall. 

The club officials were perhaps not serious and thought their huge support base in Goa will carry them through, said the official, who did not wish to be named. 

They talked about the Golden Jubilee celebrations of the club, but never cared to build up a competitive side. Instead their officials fought among themselves, depended on some mediocre foreign players recruited at the last moment on hearsay and attempted to stay afloat in a casual manner, he added. 

Curiously, Salgaocar coach Savio Medeira is considered one of Indias most talented and upcoming trainers and received offers from two top Calcutta clubs. But when it came to saving his own team from the relegation, he failed miserably. 

Medeira, however, can always claim that he was not given the desired side. Probably, he is not far from the truth. Salgacoar certainly lacked quality foreign players and had an almost non-existent strike force, which produced only seven goals in 17 NFL matches. 

Barring Brazilian midfielder Fabio Passos, whosoever the Goan club pinned hopes on let them down badly. If their two Calcutta recruits, goalkeeper Sangram Mukherjee and striker Asim Biswas, had a highly forgettable season, so were Brazilian striker Bruno Oliveira, Nigerian striker H. Emmanuel, Samson Singh or K. Anees. 

Victory and defeat are part of the game, but there is an allround fear that Salgaocars exit can hit the NFL really hard. 

Salgaocar and Vasco are two of Goas biggest crowd pulling teams. No doubt they enjoy huge support among the soccer fans in Goa, said Alberto Colaco, who ran the Goa Football Association for close to 20 years.

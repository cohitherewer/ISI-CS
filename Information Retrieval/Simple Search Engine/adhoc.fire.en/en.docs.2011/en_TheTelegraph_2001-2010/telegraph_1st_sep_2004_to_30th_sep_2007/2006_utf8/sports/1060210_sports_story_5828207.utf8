 Dravid couldve withdrawn appeal: Asif

Rawalpindi: Pakistans former Test captains were unanimous in declaring Rahul Dravids appeal against Inzamam-ul Haq for obstructing the field as against the spirit of the game but insisted that the Indian skipper was within the laws of the game. 

Indian fielders appealed because the decision could have changed the match as India were losing after being beaten in the Karachi Test. Under different circumstances, India might not have appealed, former captain Hanif Mohammad said. 

Spirit of the game is followed in normal course of the match. But in Peshawar, India took advantage of the situation, Hanif said. 

Asif Iqbal dismissed Rahul Dravids contention that if his actions were against sportsmanship, the match officials would have taken action against him. 

The bottomline is that the fielders appealed and the umpires, in accordance with the law, had to give Inzamam out. 

Dravid, being the captain, had more responsibility on his shoulders and a good gesture would have been if he had withdrawn the appeal and let the umpires to decide if they allow Inzamam to continue, Iqbal said. 

What would have happened if an Indian captain had been declared out obstructing the field in a similar situation by a Pakistani fielder, Iqbal said. 

Rashid Latif said Dravids action reflected that he was a captain under pressure. 

No doubt Inzamam was out but Dravid should not have appealed and if he had appealed in the heat of the moment, he should have withdrawn it. Rahul seems to be under tremendous pressure and tension. 

Dravid has not exposed himself as a sensible captain. I remember Javed Miandad ran out Rodney Hogg in Australia but Mushtaq Mohammed, who was the captain, withdrew the appeal and called back Hogg. 

A sensible captain always steps-in to defuse the crisis, thats his job and thats what he is expected to do, Latif stressed.

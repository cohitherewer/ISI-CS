 Sehwag, Harbhajan to return

OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Virender Sehwag 

 Lahore: Virender Sehwag will miss the last two one-day Internationals of the Pakistan series. The Indian vice-captain will return home along with Harbhajan Singh for rest and recovery. 

 Sehwag missed Mondays match 

 at the Gaddafi after injuring his shoulder during the second 

 game in Rawalpindi. He has a left posterior shoulder 

 muscle injury?The injury requires two weeks time (to heal), 

 chief selector Kiran More announced. 

He also informed that no replacement will be sought since only two matches remain.

 Harbhajan had injured his right index finger while fielding as a substitute in the third Test in Karachi. There has been fluid/swelling around the joint. An orthopaedic has advised natural healing by restraining from bowling till the pain subsides. He is not ready to bowl yet, and will require another 7-10 days rest, More said. 

The off-spinner will want to forget this tour as soon as possible. After going wicketless in the first two Tests, he was dropped for the third. He wasnt considered for any of the one-dayers because of the injury. 

More was confident that both Sehwag and Harbhajan would be fit in time for the opening Test against England next month.

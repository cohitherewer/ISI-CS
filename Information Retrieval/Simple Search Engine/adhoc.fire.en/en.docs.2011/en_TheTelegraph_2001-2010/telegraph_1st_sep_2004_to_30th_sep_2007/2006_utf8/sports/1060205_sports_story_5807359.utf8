 Hundreds greet Baghdatis back home 

Larnaca (Cyprus): Marcos Baghdatis was greeted by hundreds of cheering fans at Larnaca airport when he returned home to Cyprus following his heroics at the Australian Open. 

The 20-year-old fought back tears as he was reunited with his family for the first time since his defeat by world No. 1 Roger Federer in the Australian Open final on January 29. 

Its very emotional to be back, Baghdatis told the crowd. 

Im a little overwhelmed, and Im not sure what to say. Id like to thank all who came and everyone who followed my matches. It was a great experience for me and for our country. 

Baghdatis mother Andri was hospitalised during the final and had a gall stone operation a day later, but she was well enough to greet her son, accompanied by her Lebanese husband Christos. 

Mother and son hugged and kissed. Baghdatis eight-year-old sister carried a bouquet she said was for his girlfriend. 

Baghdatis is a rare success story for a divided island dominated by partisan politics where sport is synonymous with football. 

Baghdatis is now ranked 27th in the world, up from 54th before the Melbourne final, and is hailed at home as the greatest sportsman Cyprus has produced.

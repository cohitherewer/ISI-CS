The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Seven-wicket loss for India A

 Top End Series

 Melbourne: A fine hundred 

 by Jesse Ryder and an impressive five-wicket haul by seamer 

 Mark Gillespie propelled New Zealand A to a convincing seven-wicket 

 win over India A in the Top-End Series in Cairns on Monday.

 After restricting India A to a 

 modest 216 all out in 50 overs, New Zealand A raced to the 

 target in 34.1 overs.

 The vulnerability of India A batsmen 

 to pace was exposed as New Zealand new ball bowlers earned 

 breakthroughs for their team at regular intervals.

 Opener Gautam Gambhir (64) and 

 middle-order batsman S. Badrinath (63) showed some resistance 

 to take India A to a respectable total of 216 all out off 

 50 overs.

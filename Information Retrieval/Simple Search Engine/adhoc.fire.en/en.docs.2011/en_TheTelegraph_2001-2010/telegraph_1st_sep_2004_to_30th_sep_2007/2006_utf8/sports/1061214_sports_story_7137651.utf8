Doha: The bronze medal that India won at the Lusail Archery Ranges on Wednesday surprised many, but not Jayanta Talukdar, the star performer of the team. To him, it was an expected result and with little more effort, it could have been better. 

Pitted against Chinese Taipei in the semi-finals, the Indian trio of Talukdar, Mangal Singh Champia and Tarundeep Rai lost narrowly (210-220), but then won a cliff-hanger against Malaysia 211-207 to clinch the bronze medal. This was India s first medal in archery in the Asian Games. 

It was in the fourth series when we ensured the victory, said Talukdar later. We hit 9, 9, and 10 that baffled our opposition. They could hit only 9, 9, and 4. 

In the morning, India defeated Japan 219-206 in the quarter-finals. With little more effort, we could have been the world beaters, said Talukdar, who hails from Assam. 

Having won a medal in the Asian Games, the trio felt that now the sport would get more attention. Talukdar, however, quipped that he was yet to receive any congratulatory message from anyone back in India. 

Actually, all of us have left behind our mobile phones back in the athletics village as we are not supposed to carry it here. Maybe when we go back, there will be a lot of missed calls, he said. 

Talukdar felt that the institutions, the archers are employed with, are the chief architects of the success. I work for the Tatas, Tarundeep and Vishwas work for the Army and Mangal is with the Mittal Trust. All of these institutions have given their full backing to us. We also sincerely thank our two coaches Dharmender Tiwari and Moon Wong. 

India won another bronze medal in womens hockey with a 1-0 victory over South Korea. Only two days back, Korea got the better of India 3-2 to deny India a place in the final. 

The all-important goal for India was scored by Mamta Kharb in the 16 th minute off a penalty corner. In the mens hockey on Thursday, India will take on Malaysia for a fifth place match. 

Post-match, the Indian womens team captain had a point to make. The mens team has not done well. So we have the right to get the bronze medal for the sake of Indian hockey. In future, if we dont commit the same mistake, we are bound to win the gold. 

Tuesday, in fact, proved to be a fruitful day for India as they won a total of nine medals with some of them coming in less popular events. While the focus remained on Sania Mirza and Leander Paes, medals came in sailing, wrestling and wushu. 

The silver in sailing came in beneteau 7.5 Open represented by Sanjeev Chauhan, Mahesh Ramachandran, Girdhari Yadav and Mongia Nitin. In mens freestyle wrestling, Yogeshwar Dutt won the bronze in 60kg event and Manipurs Bimoljit Singh bagged the wushu bronze in the same category. 

In squash, Saurav Ghosal lost in the semi-finals, but earned a bronze medal as there was no third place play-off in this event. 

In boxing, India collected bronze in the superheavy +91kg category via Johnson Varghese.

 Mysore races 

 SRIMAX

 Mysore: The truncated Mysore season is all set to start from Thursday. The Karnataka Trainers Association and the syces union are to sign an agreement on Wednesday. Syces have agreed to work for eight hours a day. They have also agreed to work on more than one horse and will be paid Rs 40 extra per day for the same. 

 Syces withdrew their agitation after some owners took the initiative taking law into their hands. They, along with hundreds of racegoers, entered the racecourse and threatened the syces with dire consequences if they did not resume their duties. This had a good effect on syces and they agreed to restart the work.

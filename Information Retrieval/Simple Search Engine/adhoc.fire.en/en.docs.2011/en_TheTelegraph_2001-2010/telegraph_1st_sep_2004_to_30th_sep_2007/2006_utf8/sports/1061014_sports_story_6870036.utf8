 McEnroe starts with victory

Stockholm: Twenty-two years after he launched one of the biggest outbursts of his stormy career, John McEnroe made a triumphant return to the Stockholm Open. 

The 47-year-old American teamed up with home favourite Jonas Bjorkman in front of a sellout crowd to beat Andreas Vinciguerra and Johan Landsberg 6-3, 6-2 in a first-round doubles match on Thursday. 

It brings back nice memories, said McEnroe who was watched by Bjorn Borg, his great rival of the 1970s and 1980s. 

Its going to get harder but its nice to get a chance again to play with Jonas. Bjorn was there and so was Stefan (Edberg) and some of the other players came in which added to the excitement, he told reporters. 

Bjorkman and McEnroe, who won the San Jose doubles title in February, outclassed their opponents with classic serve and volley tactics. 

Vinciguerra and Landsberg were called in as replacements for fellow Swedes Joachim Johansson and Thomas Johansson. 

Thomas Johansson, the 2002 Australian Open winner, pulled out because his wife was expecting a baby. 

They were afraid of us, I know them. Thats the way I put it, joked McEnroe. They were running scared. 

The match took place in the Royal Tennis Hall, the same arena where McEnroe won four singles titles. 

The rivalry with 50-year-old Borg, which peaked in two Wimbledon finals in 1980 and 1981, began at the Stockholm Open. 

On the way to his first win here in 1978, McEnroe beat the Swede in the semis. Playing Bjorn here, it was the first time I played him, said the American. Hes the greatest rival I ever had. To be able to spend some time with him again, the noise the people made with their feet...its nice for me to play here. 

McEnroe also won one doubles trophy here but is best remembered in the tournament for his semi-final win over Swede Anders Jarryd in 1984. 

The American famously lost his temper when he was down a set and a break against Jarryd. McEnroe questioned a call by the umpire and also smashed the water jugs by his seat with his racket. He went on to win that match and the tournament, a feat he repeated the following year. 

Bjorkman and McEnroe will meet third seeds Simon Aspelin and Toddy Perry in the second round. 

Meanwhile, American James Blake breezed into the quarter finals on Thursday but Czech third seed Tomas Berdych was made to fight all the way against Swedish wildcard Andreas Vinciguerra. 

Blake, the second seed, scored a convincing 6-3, 6-2 win over German Simon Greul. Rising Czech Berdych, the world number 12, came back from breaks twice in the second set to beat Vinciguerra 4-6, 7-5, 7-5. (Reuters)

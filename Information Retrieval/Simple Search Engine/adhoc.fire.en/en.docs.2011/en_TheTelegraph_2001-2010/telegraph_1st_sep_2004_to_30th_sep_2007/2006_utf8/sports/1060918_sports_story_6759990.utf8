 Prasanta confident of beating MP

 - Santosh Trophy 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Faridabad: Bengal coach Prasanta Banerjee is aware that he doesnt have the best team at his disposal. Yet, it really hurts him to give a thought to the fact that Madhya Pradesh might hold the 29-time champions to a draw to earn a ticket to the next round in the Santosh Trophy here on Monday. 

At the moment, Bengal are precariously placed in the three-team Cluster III despite scoring a thumping 8-1 win over Rajasthan in the first match. With Madhya Pradesh beating Rajasthan 8-0, Bengal have been pushed to a must-win position or face an early exit from the tournament. 

Banerjee knows the situation is tricky, but is in no mood to discuss it. I simply dont believe that MP can hold Bengal, he said forcefully. I am not undermining my opponents, but I have a bunch of youngsters who are capable of taking the team far ahead in the tournament. 

On Sunday, Bengal had a light practice session before they watched the Assam-Chandigarh match for sometime at the Sector-12 Stadium. We have not discussed the goal difference factor, said Banerjee. This topic was never raised. I dont want my young wards to come under pressure. 

Madhya Pradesh have a reasonably good midfield and have created most of their attacks through the right. Banerjee wants this to be blunted and is planning to field Avinash Thapa on the left to counter the attacks. Gauranga Dutta is having a slight calf muscle injury on his right leg. I will not risk him playing on Monday. Avinash has an impressive left-foot. I am sure he will click. 

After two days of activities at the makeshift venue Nahar Singh Stadium sports complex the tournament has returned to the Sector-12 Stadium, which had remained waterlogged for the first couple of days.

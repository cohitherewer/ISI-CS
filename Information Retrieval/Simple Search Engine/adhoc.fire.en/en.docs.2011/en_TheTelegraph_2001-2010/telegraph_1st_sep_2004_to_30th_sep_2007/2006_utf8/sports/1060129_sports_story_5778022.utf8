 Daring Don has it easy 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Daring Don, a nine-year-old from trainer Dipak Karkis yard, gave 3-1/2 kg and also handed a convincing beating to his much younger rival, Serrafina, in the 1,200m Calcutta Champions Sprint Trophy on Saturday. Visiting jockey Harish partnered the winner.

 The Republic Cup and the Police Commissioners Cup, however, witnessed less faincied runners Ardella and Simply Sensational winning the respective events for trainers Javed Khan and Daniel David.

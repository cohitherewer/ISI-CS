 Jeev at tied third position

 Jeev Milkha Singh

Seoul: Jeev Milkha Singh continued his great run with a brilliant 66 that helped him finish the second day just one off the lead at the midway stage of the $600,000 SK Telecom Open at Sky 72 Golf Course here. 

Jeev, winner of the Volvo China Open last month, took his total to 10-under 134 to be tied third with Lee Seung Ho of Korea, one behind joint-leaders, Thai Prom Meesawat (64) and Malaysian Iain Steel (66). 

But the spotlight on the day was held by teenage Michelle Wie, who became the first woman to make the cut in a mens Asian Tour event. Se-Ri Pak made a cut in mens event on Korean Tour in 2003 and finished tied 10th. 

Another Indian Harmeet Kahlon dropped a bogey on last hole and finished with a 69 that took his total to five-under 139 and tied 17th place. 

Jeev, who has struck good form of late, opened with a birdie on first and had a total of seven birdies and just one bogey on 11th. 

His other birdies on front nine came on sixth and ninth to be three-under. On the back stretch, he started with a birdie on 10th, but dropped one on 11th and then picked birdies on 14th and 15th. In between he missed a couple of other birdies. 

Jeev said: I am feeling pretty good and confident now. I am going to play each round as it comes. Im not going to go out there and push myself. Im going to play it shot by shot. I hit a few balls in the morning in peace and did not have to hurry today as I knew what I was doing. 

He admitted that the win in China Open did make a difference. It re-inforces ones belief and I always felt I could win. It was just that I was not putting it all together. Now the feel is also back, added Jeev. 

The conditions this morning was very calm compared to Thursday. Yesterday it was quite windy in the afternoon. 

Jeevs fine round gave him the clubhouse lead, but he was later overtaken by the talented young Thai, Meesawat, who shot a 64. 

Kahlon said: I am playing well and I putted fairly good today. I made one or two good putts and hit the ball close. I was in a good frame of mind and played four to five holes well. 

He started at the 10th tee, bogeyed the 15th, birdied 17th, bogeyed 18th. On his second nine, he birdied second, third, fourth and fifth in succession. 

Amandeep Johl shot a two-under 70 for a two-day total of par 144 and was at tied 64th place, which saw him make the cut on the line. It was the second time in three weeks he was doing that. Earlier in Beijing, he rose from the cut line to 20th in China Open.

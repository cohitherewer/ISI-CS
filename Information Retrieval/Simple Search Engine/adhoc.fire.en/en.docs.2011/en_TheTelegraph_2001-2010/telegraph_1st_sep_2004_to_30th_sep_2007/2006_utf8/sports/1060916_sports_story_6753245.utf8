Calcutta: Martina Hingis touched down in the city at 6.45 am on Friday (her flight was an hour late) and notwithstanding the long journey from Switzerland via Muscat and Dubai, turned up at the Netaji Indoor Stadium six and a half hours later for a practice session. 

Did anyone mention jetlag? 

The former world No. 1, on her maiden visit to India to participate in the $175,000 WTA Sunfeast Open had a smile on her lips even as the media went in a tizzy, clearly overwhelmed by the presence of a real megastar. 

Hingis entourage includes mother-cum-coach Melanie Molitor and friend Mario Widmer. The five-time Grand Slam champion, who suffered a shock second-round defeat at the hands of Virginie Razzano at this years US Open, looked fit, hungry and eager while practising on the freshly-painted Greenset courts. 

With omnipresent mother Melanie keeping a strict eye on proceedings, the Swiss Miss went through the full routine with Saurav Panja, who had the honour of being her hitting partner. The baseline rallies, volleys and smashes apart, the current world No. 9 also found time to share a joke or two with Panja, whose biggest achievement was making the doubles final (with Prahlad Srinath) at the Chennai ATP meet six years ago. 

Panja appeared awe-struck. 

She is a very, very friendly person, with absolutely no airs about her, said Panja. Hingis seemed utterly at ease with her game, occasionally asking me to switch to forehands, or backhands and the like 

Apart from Hingis, Yuliana Fedak of Ukraine, Anastassia Rodionova of Russia, Britains Anne Keothavong, Abigail Spears of US arrived on Friday.

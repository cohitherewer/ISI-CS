 Title for Holmes

Scottsdale: Daniel Chopra fired a two-under 69 to finish tied 27th even as rookie J. B. Holmes walked away with the FBR Open title in only his fourth appearance on the PGA Tour. 

Chopra was helped to an under-par round with a fine finish in which he got an eagle on the 15th and then birdies on 17th and 18th. 

Chopra had two contrasting patches in his round. Between the fourth and seventh, he dropped four shots, including two bogeys on fourth and seventh and a double bogey on sixth. In all, Chopra had five birdies and an eagle but also three bogeys and a double bogey. 

Holmes made it a no-contest as he gained five shots on a single hole, the 15th, where his nearest competitor Ryan Palmer triple-bogeyed by hitting the water twice and Holmes eagled it.

 Lara retained captain

Port of Spain: Brian Lara was retained as captain after the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) bowed down to his threat that he would quit if changes were not made in the selection panel. 

Former West Indies opening batsman Gordon Greenidge was appointed as the new convenor of West Indies selectors following a meeting by the WICB directors in Barbados. 

Greenidge will be joined by Andy Roberts and Clyde Butts in the new selection panel, according to local media reports on Saturday. 

Roberts is the new face in the current panel, following Joey Carews resignation a few days back. 

While retaining Lara as captain, the board confirmed that he was a part of the selection panel along with coach Bennett King. (PTI)

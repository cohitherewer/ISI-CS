 We are not among favourites: Torres

Kamen: Two impressive wins and a huge goal difference have made underachieving Spain a realistic contender for the World Cup. Yet star striker Fernando Torres refuses to count his team among the top candidates. 

I dont think we are favourites, the Atletico Madrid forward said on Wednesday. The favourites are the ones who have won World Cups and have more experience than we do. 

We dont have the pressure of being favourites because Spain has never won the World Cup and has never been in a final in all these years. Argentina, Germany, those are the favourites. We take it step by step and people are going to talk about us, but favourites? No. 

 Spain have already advanced to the second round by crushing Ukraine 4-0 in their group H opener and coming back from a goal down to beat Tunisia 3-1. 

Coach Luis Aragones has said he will rest his top players in the final group match on Friday against Saudi Arabia, giving the substitutes a chance to shine. 

Its always a special feeling to make a debut, said FC Barcelonas Andres Iniesta, who is likely to play in Spains three-man midfield. All of us are eager to do well and for Spain to go far in the tournament, thats the most important thing. (AP)

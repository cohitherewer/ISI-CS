The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Steves plans not put on hold

 - Gavaskar, too, sends a reality show proposal to BCCI 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Steve Waugh

Calcutta: Lynette Waughs steady recovery after brain surgery at the Prince of Wales Hospital in Sydney strongly suggests that talismanic husband Steves India-centric reality show on TV (a talent hunt, really) wont be put on hold. 

As shes doing fine, we dont expect the surgery to come in the way of what is being finalised, somebody closely associated with the project told The Telegraph on Saturday. 

Its not confirmed, but the show a build-up for the 2007 World Cup is likely to be called Sport*Star Cricket, which is a registered brand of the Singapore-headquartered Imagine OmniMedia Pte Ltd. 

Steves inspiration, it seems, has been the Rock*Star show. 

Planning obviously is at an advanced stage and, till Lynettes illness, Steve was giving personal attention to the content particularly the skills that ought to be tested. 

Buddy and one-time teammate Gavin Robertson is also on board. 

Steve has even approached three-four former India players, whore comfortable with the medium, to join his show which may be aired from November. 

A formal announcement is expected once the broadcaster is decided upon. The centres (possibly five) for the talent hunt, too. 

Negotiations with potential broadcasters are at a sensitive stage. 

Again, its not official, but prizes could include training at academies in Australia and the UK, besides the opportunity to play grade cricket Down Under. 

Steve has, of course, approached the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) for its endorsement. The proposal put forward, though, isnt detailed enough. 

Mr Waugh has been asked to submit a full-fledged one Once received, Ill place it before my committee Im just a vetting board, informed vice-president and marketing committee chairman Lalit Modi. 

Speaking from Mumbai, he added that the BCCIs stamp of approval wasnt necessary. It would, however, be needed if Steve wants to use the infrastructure anywhere. 

Were ready to help anybody who wishes to promote and showcase cricket at the grassroots It has to be serious stuff Modi pointed out. 

He revealed that the peerless Sunil Gavaskar had already submitted a detailed proposal for another reality show. 

Its going to be placed before the marketing committee which meets in Chennai early next week. 

Steve is ahead of Gavaskar in the Test run-getters list (10,927 vis--vis 10,122), but Little Master No.1 has made a headstart on a different pitch. 

Footnote: Steve, one learns, had to charter a flight from Melbourne when Lynette got hospitalised for immediate surgery. While shes much better, barring the immediate family, visitors are still not allowed.

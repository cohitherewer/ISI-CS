 AIFF volte-face on Climax 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: The AIFF on Sunday did a volte-face when they allowed Climax Lawrence to play for Dempo against East Bengal in the Durand Cup. 

The AIFF, a few days ago, wrote to Durand Cup organisers saying that Lawrence has been barred from playing for Dempo in the meet as he was supposed to join the national team. On Sunday, the AIFF sent another fax stating that the medio has been cleared to play for Dempo in the first match. 

I might play the first match and then leave for Dubai, said Lawrence. I will do things as per the clubs direction. I am not yet sure when I am leaving for Dubai. 

While Dempo officials argued it was not mandatory for a club to release a player for friendlies, Sukhwinder Singh felt it could set a bad precedent. Next time, some other club might also create problem in releasing their footballers for friendly matches.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Bengal must be cautious 

 FREE-KICK 

 P. K. Banerjee

 Bengal are alive and kicking in the national championship and its a nice departure from the air of disillusionment weve come to get used to in the past few years. Wednesdays Santosh Trophy final against Punjab, therefore, throws up a very good opportunity for a bunch of youngsters, who are standing at the crossroad of fame and despondency. 

 Its not like that Bengal have bulldozed every opponent on their way to the final. Truth to tell, they have got the rub of the green, which is necessary to stay in the hunt the semi-final win over Kerala on shootout was a case in point and with it, they have managed to mask the inconsistency in performance. 

 But its final and Im sure that Prasanta Banerjees boys will be determined to lift the crown, which has been missing on Bengals cupboard for quite some time. 

 Punjab players boast of having sound physique and being good runners. Plus, they are going to enjoy the home support. Bengal, thus, should take a cautious approach. They must not get carried away by emotion or harbour any ambition to go on the offensive right from the beginning. Besides the proverbial luck factor, two essential ingredients are required to win a battle from a realistic perspective: your ability to attack with speed and with surprise. In both ways, the chinks of the enemys armoury get exposed something Bengal must try to cash in on against Punjab. In a nutshell, Dipendu Biswas amp; Co.s success on Wednesday lies in playing with composure, keeping their cool and, most importantly, a reliance on counter-attacks. 

 Dipendu is close to his form now. Nabis utility both as a striking force and attacking midfielder provides variety to the teams composition. However, Sanjeev Maria will be the man to watch out for. The Mohun Bagan player has been the rock of Bengals backline in the tournament. 

 He will go into the final with an extra dose of motivation, knowing that he has been ignored by his native team Punjab. Bengal, in the past, had defensive pivots like Arun Ghosh, Manoranjan Bhattacharya and Subrata Bhattacharya. If Maria lives up to his reputation and inspires his teammates to withstand the expected initial flurry of attacks, Bengal will sure have the last laugh. 

 Santosh Trophy used to be a happy hunting ground for us in the past. I also played for both Railways and Bengal. A significant part of those successes owed to the fact that all leading players were playing in Calcutta at that time. I usually represented Railways, but I was also given chance to play for Bengal from 1955 to 1959, in which we emerged champions thrice. 

 However, with the introduction of rule that the states can pick their sons of the soil, plying their trade elsewhere, that halo of Bengal dominance has taken a backseat. 

 Besides, the arrival of National Football League in the national football scenario has dwarfed all other blue-riband tournaments like the Durand and Rovers Cup and, this is why, the clubs are now reluctant to release players for these meets. 

 No coach is, therefore, given enough resources to work on when it comes to the tournament like Santosh Trophy. Full credit to Prasanta that despite the handicaps, he has taken the team to the title-round.

 A win in the final will just be the perfect icing on the cake.

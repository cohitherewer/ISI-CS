 CAB moves court

Chennai: A petition seeking a direction to restrain the BCCI from convening any special general meeting has been filed by the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) in the Madras High Court. 

Justice R. Sudhakar ordered notice to the BCCI and the Registrar of Societies Thursday when the civil suit of CAB, represented by its joint secretary Saradindu Pal, came up for hearing. 

The BCCI has convened a special general meeting on December 16 in Jaipur to discuss its disciplinary committee report on former president Jagmohan Dalmiya and the course of action to be taken against him. (PTI)

 Beckham denies Rooney-Owen rift

 SID LOWE in MADRID

 Reports suggested that a rift had developed between Rooney and Michael Owen after Rooney allegedly gambled away ?700,000 , using a business associate of Owens. But Beckham hit out at the targeting of Rooney and insists that the striker will not be affected by allegations aimed his way. 

Wayne does not have a (gambling) problem, he has just been highlighted because of who he is and what a great player he is ? thats the only reason, Beckham said. 

You can get people criticising him for one thing but you also have to look at the other things he does: Wayne also does a lot of work for charity and everyone knows that. You saw that when the story came out about Wayne, he was man-of-the-match (in the very next game he played), 

so that shows that he is not going to be affected by it. 

And while Beckham admitted that he does not form part of the card schools within the camp, he insists that they will not damage Englands chances at this summers World Cup in Germany. 

Personally I like going to the Grand National or horse racing sometimes just for a day out to have a bit of a fun with the lads or with my wife, but I have never been a card man in my life, Beckham said. 

A smile then crept across his face as he joked: The only thing Ive played is snap and thats it. Its not that Im not any good at cards, (its) because Im good at snap. 

Ive never been into playing cards but there have always been card schools in every team Ive played in and every team I have known, he added. 

 Theres always been that in football ? there have always been cards schools and there has always been betting going on. 

People were saying there was an issue between Michael and Wayne. Its probably just because they are the two main centre-forwards that people want to say that, but there is no problem and there never has been. I have never seen it affect any of the players or the way theyve played. 

Its not just Wayne, there are lots of other players (who gamble on card games). But it doesnt affect our players. In our England squad, its impossible for the players to fall out over something like that: the banter and the togetherness of the team is too strong to be affected by card schools. There are no fall outs and there is no problem at all.

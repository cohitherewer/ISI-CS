New Delhi: Indias rising stock in golf became evident with four players of the country figuring in the top-200 of the latest official world rankings. 

Jyoti Randhawa, Arjun Atwal, Shiv Kapur and Jeev Milkha Singh find themselves among 11 Asian Tour members who feature in the elite list. 

Randhawa, who played all four rounds at the British Masters last week, is 122nd in the world while Atwal is 143 and Shiv Kapur 149th. Jeev, the current leader in the UBS Order of Merit, is ranked 161st. 

Australian Andrew Buckle is the highest ranked Asian Tour member at No. 83, followed by two-time Asian No. 1 Thongchai Jaidee who is 94th. 

Meanwhile, Jeev will hope to continue his great run of form as he tees up for the KSB Munsingwear Open in Okayama, a tournament he came close to winning two years ago on the Japan Tour. 

The 34-year-old, who won the Volvo China Open last month, is also placed 18th on the Japan Tour and 26th on the European Tour. Its been a good run and I feel I am in contention more often now, said Jeev, who finished fifth last week in the Japan PGA Championship, one of the majors on the Japan Tour. 

Randhawa, on the other hand, will tee up at the star-studded Nissan Irish Open this week alongside some of the biggest names in European golf. 

Elsewhere, Kapur and Ashok Kumar, lead a strong Indian challenge at the $300,000 Macau Open. 

Ashok Kumar, who finished fifth after leading the field till the 65th hole at the Aamby Valley Asian Masters last week, was given a special entry by Asian Tour and the golfer is now planning to a play a few more Asian Tour events later this season. 

Arjun Singh, Digvijay Singh, Uttam Singh Mundy, Jaiveer Virk, Gurbaaz Mann, SSP Chowrasia and Harinder Gupta are other Indians in the fray. (PTI)

 Win puts Surya back in title race

 - National A Chess

 - Sandipan beats Arghyadip 

 Surya scored a thumping win over B.S. Shivanandan 

Visakhapatnam: Top seed Grandmaster Surya Sekhar Ganguly scored a thumping victory over B.S. Shivanandan in the 18th round to come back into reckoning for top honours at the 43rd National A Chess Championship here. 

With just three rounds remaining in the premier event, Surya moved to 12.5 points from his 17 games so far within striking distance of overnight leader International Master Deepan Chakravarthy (13) who had a bye in the 18th round. 

Diwakar Prasad Singh remained on course for his maiden selection in the national team with a fine attacking victory over International Master S. Kidambi. The Jharkhand player is now on sole third spot on 12 points. 

The fourth spot is jointly held by Grandmaster Koneru Humpy and last years runners-up Sandipan Chanda who have an identical score of 11.5 points while M.R. Venkatesh, who suffered a shock defeat at the hands of tailender IM Lanka Ravi, is now sixth in the standings having 11 points. 

Even though he is clear third now, the thing going against Singh is the fact that he has just two games remaining while all the other contenders have another game in hand. This is because of the odd number of participants left in the fray after GM Tejas Bakre withdrew after playing his first round. 

Whoever had to face Bakre, thus, got a bye and Singh is the only one remaining among the contenders for a place in the team, who has not got a bye yet. 

Surya was pleasantly surprised to see Shivanandan going for the petroff, which has not exactly been his opening in the past as black pieces. The defending champion was a picture of confidence and launched a direct attack against Shivanandan who found the going tough. 

Lanka Ravi had something to cherish when he beat Venkatesh who has been running for a place in the top three here. 

The oldest participant here, Ravi has had a forgettable event here and in one of the earlier rounds was even contemplating withdrawal from the championship. However, against Venkatesh it was a different story as he played a solid game to get the better of a player who had earlier made a GM norm in the championship. 

Humpy had little trouble in beating first timer Himanshu Sharma who was not in control of the situation despite playing white. Humpy got her pieces rolling in the middle game and the end for Sharma came sooner than expected. 

Sandipan Chanda was also written off but his third victory in the last four games brought him back to a position of strength and now the regular Indian team member can train his sights on a berth in the Olympiad. The 18th round victory against his citymate Arghyadip Das came easy.

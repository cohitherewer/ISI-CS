 Strauss: Were focused on ODIs

London: England skipper Andrew Strauss has said his players have put the ball-tampering row behind them and are keen to focus on the one-day series against Pakistan for whom they have mutual respect. 

Strauss said there were no issues at all with their Pakistani counterparts following the sensational developments at The Oval and the series has been played in a good spirit. 

Having played against Pakistan last winter, there is a bit of mutual respect between the teams and there are no issues between the players at all, he said. 

The 29-year-old Strauss, however, said the hosts were surprised by the developments involving Australian umpire Darrell Hair, who charged Pakistan of ball tampering which led to Pakistan forfeiting the fourth and final Test.

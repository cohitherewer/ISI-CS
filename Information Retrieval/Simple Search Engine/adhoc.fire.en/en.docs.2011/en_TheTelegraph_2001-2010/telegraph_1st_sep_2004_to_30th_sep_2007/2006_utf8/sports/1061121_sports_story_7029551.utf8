 J.J. Sobha lone participant

 - Soma, Sushmita stay away from trials 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: Andhra Pradeshs J.J. Sobha, the lone participant in the heptathlon trials for the Asian Games after Soma Biswas and Sushmita Singha Roy decided to stay away, seems to be sailing smoothly for a place in the athletics squad. 

Sobha has already logged in 3287 points on the first day and with the way things are going at the Nehru Stadium, she has every chance to end up with 5800-plus points. In the last inter-state meet in Chennai, Sobha finished third with 5734 points behind Soma (5799) and Sushmita (5761). 

The Athletics Federation of India (AFI), which seems to be keen to include Sobha in the Asian Games-bound team, called for fresh trials after Sobha had fallen behind both Soma and Sushmita in all the three major tournaments of the season Federation Cup, National Open and the inter-state meet. 

In an apparent protest, both Soma and Sushmita informed the federation that they would not be participating in the trials. Their coach Kuntal Roy also requested the federation to consider their performances in the domestic meets so far for selection. It was, however, turned down by the AFI. 

AFI secretary Lalit Bhanot said he was not forcing anyone to attend the trials. But in case anyone does better in the trials, he or she would make the Asian Games, he said. Strangely, the Bengal association did not react to AFIs plan to hold fresh trials to select the heptathlon team, which has two Indian entries for Doha. 

Sobha is a national record holder, whose best performance (6172 points) came in the Athens Olympics two years ago. Sushmita bettered the third place mark of the last Asian Games (5870) by getting 5872 points in the Federation Cup in March. Somas best this year is 5857 points.

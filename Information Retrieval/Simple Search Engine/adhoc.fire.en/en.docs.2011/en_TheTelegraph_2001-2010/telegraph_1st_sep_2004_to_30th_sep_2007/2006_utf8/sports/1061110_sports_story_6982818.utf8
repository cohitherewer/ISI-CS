 Pressure mounts on stewards 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Three of the four racecourse trade unions, recognised by the RCTC, are strongly opposed to the sale of the 11, Russell Street property. The poster campaign at the racecourse on Wednesday gave ample hint that unions were up in arms.

 We have our differences but we are united on the issue that the proposed sale needs to be stalled, whatever the views of the pro-sale lobby, said a union functionary.

 Stand members, too, are lending their voice of dissent on the issue. In a letter to the stewards on Thursday they have lodged their protest, besides a veiled threat of consequences that may follow in the event of stewards going ahead with the sale.

 Most of the present stewards, too, are against the sale but for a different reason. They viewed that there were legal problems, and in the best interests of the club they were against the sale. Stewards were, however, seriously considering developing the property, though they were not clear about the venture after the City Club project has been virtually abandoned.

 The sale of another property, at D.L.Khan Road, has already been negotiated last month for Rs 12.25 crore. Full payment from the buyer was promised by the stewards at the October 7 EGM. 

 The proceeds from the sale would have eased the club from the financial constraints and the hosting of the Invitation Cup in March would also have been easy. But no progress has been made in the past one month despite talks of a part-payment from the buyer. Some members are, however, against such mode of payment. Th-ey say the second instalment never follows. This issue may again put the Invitation Cup in jeopardy.

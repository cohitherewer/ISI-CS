 Jeev set to miss cut, Atwal recovers 

 Arjun Atwal

Castle Rock (US): Daniel Chopra and Arjun Atwal made excellent recoveries on the second day at The International at the Castle Pines Golf Club, as play was stopped early due to darkness with many players yet to finish their second round. 

However, Asian Tour Order of Merit leader Jeev Milkha Singh had a rough day and is sure to miss the cut after seven bogeys against just two birdies. 

Chopra had five birdies and one bogey in an excellent round which fetched him nine points and brought his total to eight after minus one on the first day. 

The Swede was solid in finding the greens and needed 28 putts for the round. He is tied 38th while Atwal is tied 70th and on the cut line. 

After a shaky start, Atwal bounced back-firing five birdies against four bogeys and snatched six valuable points to be placed 70th. However, Jeev crumbled in the second round when he carded two birdies against seven bogeys. (PTI)

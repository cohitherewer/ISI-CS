New Delhi: Leander Paes and Martin Damm sneaked through to the semi-finals after scoring a hard-fought victory in the last group match over Jonathan Erlich and Andy Ram of Israel at the ATP Masters Cup in Shanghai on Thursday. 

Paes and Damm clinched the Red Group tie 6-4, 7-6 (8-6) but still had to thank Australian Paul Hanley and Kevin Ullyett of Zimbabwe for their last-four berth. 

Hanley and Ullyett defeated the top-seeded Bryan brothers, Bob and Mike of the US 3-6, 7-6 (7-4), 6-4 in the other group match to maintain an all-win record. 

That left the three teams of Paes-Damm, Bob-Mike and Elrich-Ram with one win from three matches each. The Indo-Czech pair, this years US Open champions, advanced to the knock-out stage by virtue of a better set percentage. 

The pairings will be decided after the Blue Group matches are completed on Friday. 

Weve won three in a row, so were on top of the world, Ullyett said after upsetting the Bryan brothers. I think this is out of respect to the Bryans, to have them out of the tournament, its actually good for everyone. Theyre hard to beat. 

Im sure the other guys are quite happy about that because theyre the best team in the world, you know. So to not have to play them again is actually quite nice. So were really trying to knock them out of the tournament, yeah. 

Meanwhile in singles action, Roger Federer reached the semi-finals without hitting a ball, then beat Ivan Ljubicic 7-6, 6-4 to bring defending champion David Nalbandian through with him. 

Argentine Nalbandian improved to 1-2 for the round robin stage by downing Andy Roddick 6-2, 7-6 (7-4) earlier in the day, sending Swiss Federer through and ending his American opponents interest in the tournament. 

Nalbandian was left needing world No. 1 Federer to beat Ljubicic in the second match of the evening to stay in the championship and despite being broken in his first service game, Federer duly delivered. 

Federer crushed the Croatian to become the first player to win 90 matches in a season since Ivan Lendl won 106 in 1982, extended his winning streak to 27 matches and ensured he will remain unbeaten in Masters Cup round robin for at least another year. 

Champion in 2003 and 2004 and beaten finalist last year, Federer qualified for the semi-finals for the fifth year in a row after winning all three of his Red Group matches. 

American James Blake qualified for the last four on Wednesday, while world No. 2 and 3, Rafael Nadal of Spain and Russian Nikolay Davydenko, face off for the final slot in on Friday.

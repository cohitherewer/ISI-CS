 Sonn had to make a few noises: Majola

Durban: Cricket South Africa CEO Gerald Majola finds it difficult to understand why International Cricket Council (ICC) president Percy Sonn was late in expressing his disappointment over the South African teams pulling out of the tri-series in Colombo. 

If he is so disappointed, he should speak to his own consultants because they are the ones who found that the situation was unsafe, Majola was quoted as saying by a website on Tuesday. 

Majola also said Sonns behaviour might be because of his new position as the big boss of world cricket and he probably had to make a few noises. (PTI)

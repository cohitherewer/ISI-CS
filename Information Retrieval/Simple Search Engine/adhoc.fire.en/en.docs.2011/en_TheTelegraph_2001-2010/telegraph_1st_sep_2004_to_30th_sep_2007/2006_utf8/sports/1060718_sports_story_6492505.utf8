 Independent observer sought for CAB polls

A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta: The opposition moved court on Monday seeking the appointment of an independent observer to conduct the CAB elections on July 30. City police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee is challenging Jagmohan Dalmiya for the presidents post. 

The chief judge of city civil court, P. K. Sarkar, on Monday admitted a petition moved by Samar Pal, assistant secretary of Aryan Club, demanding appointment of an observer to conduct the CAB elections. 

According to the petitioner, the presence of a court-appointed observer was necessary to conduct free and fair polls. The petitioner also demanded a probe into the CAB accounts. 

Admitting the petition, the chief judge asked Pal to serve notices on Dalmiya and other executive committee members of the CAB. The court fixed the matter for hearing on Friday. 

Dalmiya had no comment to offer since he had not received any papers till late on Monday. 

Significantly, at the emergent meeting of CAB affiliates on July 2, former Union minister Ajit Panjas call for a returning officer at the AGM was shot down. The emergent meeting was also attended by Mukherjee and he, too, had expressed satisfaction with the proceedings.

6 Indians make cut, Johl in 5th spot 

CHINA OPEN

Sanya: Amandeep Johl fired three birdies in 

his last nine holes to return a card of three-under 69 that saw him lead a group 

of six Indians into the weekend rounds of the Crowne Plaza Open at Yalong Bay 

Golf Club here.

Johl is now eight-under for 36 holes and lies in fifth 

place. The leader is Chinese Taipeis Lin Wen-Tang, who fired a hole-in-one 

on the par-3 fifth hole during a round of eight-under 64 that carried him to 13-under, 

two shots clear of overnight leader Chinarat Phadsungil (68).

Lin Wen-tang was two-under for his first nine holes, 

but he blazed home in six-under 30 on the front nine, including four birdies and 

an ace.

The Indians put up a fine display as six of the nine 

made the cut and three, including Johl, were in the top-10.

Gaurav Ghei and Harmeet Kahlon were tied ninth with 

eight others. Ghei, 32nd overnight, was flawless in his first 16 holes of the 

day and his round included a stretch of five birdies from 11th to 15th, before 

a bogey on 17th blotted his card.

Rahil Gangjee had five birdies and three bogeys and 

shot a 70 to be tied 23rd, while SSP Chowrasia (72) is now at two-under and in 

tied 34th place with Digvijay Singh (74) who slid down following a double on 14th 

and a bogey on the next.

Amrtinder Singh (71) bogeyed the eighth, his second 

last hole, and missed the cut by one. Uttam Singh Mundy (70) had to pay for his 

first round 76 and missed the cut by two. Gurbaaz Mann (76) missed the cut, which 

came at even par, by three.

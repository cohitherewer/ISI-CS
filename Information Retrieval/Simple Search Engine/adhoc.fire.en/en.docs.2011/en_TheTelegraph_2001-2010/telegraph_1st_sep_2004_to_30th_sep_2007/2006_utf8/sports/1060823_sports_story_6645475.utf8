 Bengal in easy cluster

 - SANTOSH TROPHY 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: All India Football Federation (AIFF) stuck to their decision of stretching the Santosh Trophy for the national football championship to nearly 42 days when it released the draw on Tuesday. 

The preliminary tournament, consisting of 28 teams in eight clusters, will be played in Gurgaon and Faridabad in Haryana from September 14 to 29. The rest of the tournament from the quarter final rounds will be played from October 14 to 25. Last years semi-finalists Goa, Punjab, Maharashtra and Kerala will play straight from the quarter finals. 

Twenty-nine-time champions Bengal, however, have been given a rather easy group in the preliminaries. Placed in Cluster III, Bengal have Rajasthan (September 14) and Madhya Pradesh (September 18) as their opponents in Faridabad. To make the quarter final league, Bengal will have to top their cluster and beat the winners of Cluster IV.

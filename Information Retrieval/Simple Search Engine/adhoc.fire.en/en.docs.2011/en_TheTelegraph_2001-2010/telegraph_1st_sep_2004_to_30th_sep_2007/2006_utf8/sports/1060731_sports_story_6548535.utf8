 Former selectors tear into Wright

 - He kept Laxman out of 2003 World Cup, not us: Sekar 

New Delhi: Former Team India coach John Wrights remarks on team selection came under severe criticism on Sunday from former selectors who had worked with him, with one of them even blaming the New Zealander for keeping V.V.S. Laxman out of the 2003 World Cup squad. 

The selectors, with the exception of Ajit Wadekar, were quick to dismiss Wrights allegations as totally untrue and termed it as a ploy to sell his book. 

Wright has exposed himself by levelling totally untrue allegations like these after five years. After having earned thousands of dollars, it is obvious that he wants to make some more money by writing such things so that his book sells well, T.A. Sekar of Tamil Nadu, who was a selector during Wrights tenure, said. 

The former New Zealand captain, in his book titled Indian Summers released in New Zealand earlier this week, has written that the Indian team selection was highly affected by the zonal quota system. 

Wright wrote that Laxman and Mohammed Kaif bore the brunt of regional bias and were always one or two failures away from their place being questioned. 

Sekar denied Wrights claims, saying it was the coach who insisted on including Dinesh Mongia in place of Laxman in the World Cup squad three years ago. 

He never owned up or took any blame during his tenure as coach. Why has he not explained his acts of dumping players to please someone, asked Sekar. 

Laxman was in great form in 2003 but Wright got his way, insisting on the selection of Mongia instead. If the selection process was regionalised, how did the team perform so well in 2003 World Cup, Sekar said. 

Former East zone selector Ashok Malhotra said Wright appeared despe- rate to sell his book. 

I think he is trying to sell his book by conjuring up all this? These mercenaries come to India, stay here for four-five years, they know nothing about our cricket or our system. During their tenure they agree with everyone, but once they go back after raking in the moolah, they come out with such allegations. 

Malhotra said Wright survived for five years only because he had the backing of Sourav Ganguly. 

I accompanied the team to Bangladesh (in 2004). During team meetings, I never saw Wright utter a word on strategy. It was Sou- rav who did all the talking. 

He is now criticising Sourav for bringing in (Sunil) Gavaskar (as batting consultant in the series against Australia). If he had a problem, why didnt he resign then and there? 

Former selection committee chairman Chandu Borde said Wrights comments were in bad taste. 

After all, he was present in all our meetings as a coach and never expressed such things in the meetings.

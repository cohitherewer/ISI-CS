 Zaheer bags 2 for Worcestershire

London: India discard Zaheer Khan produced yet another incisive spell of fast bowling to provide Worcestershire with a terrific start against Somerset in a County Championship Division II match at Worcester County Ground on Wednesday. 

Left-arm seamer Zaheer dismissed England vice-captain Marcus Trescothick for a 15-ball duck as Worcestershire made early inroads into Somerset who were struggling at 237 for six at tea on Day I. 

Zaheer, who starred with three for 26 in Worcestershires C amp;G Trophy victory over Nottinghamshire two days ago, then returned to give the second breakthrough by accounting for 24-year old wicketkeeper-batsman Carl Gazzard (22). 

Gazzard had added 67 runs for the sixth wicket with Wesley Durston (50 ..) to lift Somerset from 168 for five before Zaheer had the right-handed batsman leg-before wicket for figures of 16-7-41-2. 

England international Kabir Ali (1/65), Western Australian paceman Matt Mason (1/41) and 22-year old quick Nadeem Malik (2/58) shared the rest of the spoils. (PTI)

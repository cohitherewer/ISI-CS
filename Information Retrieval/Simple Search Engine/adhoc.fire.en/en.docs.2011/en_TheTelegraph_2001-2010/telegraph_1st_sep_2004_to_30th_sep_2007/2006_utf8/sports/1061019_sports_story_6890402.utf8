 Poor education to blame: Shaharyar 

Karachi: Former PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan has blamed poor education among players for Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Asif failing drugs tests. 

We had been warning our players to be careful even while taking medicines and strictly follow the regime of our doctors, Shaharyar said on Wednesday. 

We even provided a list of all medicines to the players that contained banned substances. I have no doubt they consumed nandrolone but I dont think they did it intentionally, he said. 

Shaharyar said Pakistan players had low levels of education and did not understand rules and regulations and how to fulfil contractual obligations. (Reuters)

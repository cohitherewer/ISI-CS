 Watson gets more time 

Sydney: Shane Watson will be given more time to prove his fitness to play in the first Test against England starting in Brisbane on Thursday. 

Watson ran laps for around 45 minutes and bowled in the nets before undergoing further scans on Monday. The 25-year-olds injury is not as serious as first thought and will train again on Tuesday before a decision is taken. (Reuters)

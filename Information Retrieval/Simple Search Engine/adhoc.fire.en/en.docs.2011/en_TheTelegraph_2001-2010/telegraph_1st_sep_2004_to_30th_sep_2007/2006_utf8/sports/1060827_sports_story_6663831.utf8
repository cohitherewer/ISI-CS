 Gangjee still in title hunt 

 Brunei Golf

 Rahil Gangjee 

 Bandar Seri Begawan: Rahil 

 Gangjee staged a late fightback to keep himself in the frame 

 for top honour at the $300,000 Brunei Open golf tournament 

 with two birdies in the last three holes.

 Gangjee shot a two-under 69 and 

 is now nine-under 204 for 54 holes after three rounds.

 He is four shots behind the leader 

 and defending champion Terry Pilkadaris (64) and his Australian 

 mate David Gleeson (65), who are both at 13-under for three 

 rounds.

 Young Filipino Juvic Pangusan 

 (67) is third at 12-under, while seasoned Wang Ter Chang 

 (64) of Chinese Taipei and Jason Knutzon (66) of United 

 States were tied for fourth at 11-under.

 Four players were tied at 10-under, 

 and then another three, including Gangjee, were sharing 

 the tenth spot at nine-under to set up a needle final round.

 Among other Indians, Jyoti Randhawa 

 (68) and Arjun Singh (69) were at five-under 208 and tied 

 25th, while Harmeet Kahlon (70) was four-under 209 and 35th 

 and SSP Chowrasia (72) slipped to 61st at even par 213 for 

 three rounds.

 Gangjee opened with a birdie but 

 then dropped back-to-back bogeys. The Calcuttan quickly 

 recovered with successive birdies on fifth and sixth and 

 turned in one-under and that improved to two-under with 

 a birdie on 11th. 

 Gangjee striding confidently looked 

 set for a good back nine when he dropped a double bogey 

 at 13th with a wayward approach shot and a miss on the green. 

 Birdies on the 15th and 17th saved the day and kept him 

 in hunt.

 Randhawa, playing in Asia after 

 a long gap, had two birdies on front nine and two more on 

 the back stretch but he also dropped a shot on 11th and 

 finished the day three-under 68 and moved from 43rd to tied 

 25th.

 Arjun Singh, hoping for a few 

 good finishes to help him secure a card for next year, was 

 flying fine with three birdies before dropping a last hole 

 bogey on 18th for his 69.

 Kahlon, trying to play himself 

 back into form had a flawless and bogey-free round, but 

 with his birdies putt not falling, he managed just one birdie 

 and a card of one-under 70. Chowrasia had three birdies 

 and four bogeys in his 72.

 Defending champion Pilkadaris 

 and Gleeson of Australia charged up the leaderboard in the 

 third round.

 Pilkadaris, who is currently ranked 

 14th on the Asian Tours Order of Merit, fired a superb 

 seven-under-par 64 while Gleeson, looking for his second 

 Asian Tour title, shot a 65. Pilkadaris fired an eagle at 

 the par five 15th hole. Earlier he had birdies on the first, 

 third, fourth and fifth holes.

 He bogeyed the eighth and ninth 

 holes, but birdied the 10th, 12th and 13th holes before 

 his eagle for 64.

So lets run through the situation one last time, just to make sure we have all the facts right before the opener against Paraguay in Frankfurt on Saturday. Englands best striker isnt match-fit and no one knows when he will be; the sides other main forward has completed 90 minutes once in this calendar year; a 17-year-old rookie stands by to answer his countrys call while Sven-Goran Eriksson waves goodbye to a proven Premiership goalscorer. 

Sounds great on paper, doesnt it? Who would bet on a team in that kind of position? Plenty, apparently. England still go into this World Cup as one of the favourites. Somehow, thats probably right as well. 

Not that Eriksson helped much with his risky decision at the outset to pick only four strikers, including young Theo Walcott. Michael Owens tardy return to full fitness only complicated matters, while the developments involving Wayne Rooney have turned into a scary situation. 

What happens, for instance, if Owen or Peter Crouch, or even both, are injured on Saturday? Where would that leave a coach who is putting so much store in Rooneys successful return? The Swede would have to change his system to prevent Walcott from starting against Trinidad and Tobago. 

[For the time being, England are placing their faith on the two-metre tall dancing robot called Crouch. It was he who headed in Englands winner in the 3-2 triumph over Argentina in a friendly last November. Crouchs Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard believes Paraguay will be the next South American side to struggle to deal with his lanky teammate. 

Were hoping theyve never played against a Peter-type of player before, Gerrard said on Thursday. I see him day in day out in training and in games so I know what a talent he is. If he plays to his ability, he can cause Paraguays defence a lot of problems.] 

But back to the main point: getting Rooney back up to speed over the next fortnight so that he can play some meaningful part in this tournament. Injury free he may be, but the physical effects of five weeks on the sidelines, unable to play matches or even join in normal training, cant be dismissed with a casual shrug. 

It is going to take an awful lot of hard work, a lot of pounding alone under the close supervision of Ivan Carminarti, Englands Italian fitness coach, if Rooney is to get anywhere near the fitness level required. 

Fortunately, in trying to achieve that, methods have greatly improved over the past few years. No longer are recovering players asked to embark on drawn-out runs that do nothing to replicate their work in a match. These days, the good fitness coaches devise specific schedules tailored to individual needs, concentrating on the runs a player makes during a match. As a result, the programmes for a full-back, a central midfielder and a striker would all vary in character. 

Even then nothing can prepare you for the initial shock, for those first 10 minutes or so of frenetic match action when the lungs feel on fire, when you are desperately trying to find your second wind. As you suck in great gulps of air, the game passes by in a blur. Everyone around seems so much fitter. 

No one is immune to that feeling, not even Rooney, especially when he is fighting against the clock to play some kind of a part. 

A 20-minute stint as a substitute is the most sensible way forward when Rooney is eventually let loose on this World Cup. You cant expect him to start. It would be asking too much.

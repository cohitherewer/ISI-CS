Lahore: Younis Khan slammed a sparkling unbeaten 147 as Pakistan gained control of the first Test against India on Day I of the three-match series at the Gaddafi Stadium here. 

The reliable Younis Khan produced a fine exhibition of strokeplay to notch up his tenth Test century while Mohammed Yousuf was unbeaten on 95 as the hosts rode a solid batting display to close the day on a commanding 326 for two. 

Younis first teamed up with opener Shoaib Malik (59) to put on 124 for the second wicket and then consolidated the home teams position with an unfinished 190-run stand with Yousuf on a placid track. 

Bad light forced play to be called off with five overs still remaining to be bowled on a highly forgettable day for the visitors who sprang a surprise by including both Sourav Ganguly and Yuvraj Singh in the XI, sacrificing a regular opener instead. 

Nothing seemed to go right for the Indians on Friday as they not only lost the toss but also failed to check the run flow with the Pakistan batsmen maintaining a brisk rate right through the day. 

The hosts, seeking to make amends for the series loss against the Indians in 2004, lost opener Salman Butt (6) early but swung the momentum in their favour with an aggressive batting approach which took India by surprise. 

None of the Indian bowlers could make much of an impact as both Younis and Yousuf unleashed a barrage of strokes on both sides of the wicket to steer Pakistan past the 300-mark. 

It was Younis third century against the tourists and that, too, in successive Tests spread over two series. He had notched up 147 in the second Test last year and 267 in the final match to help Pakistan square the series 1-1. 

Younis has faced 243 balls and hit 19 fours so far, while Yousuf has struck ten fours and a six in his 124-ball knock. 

To make matters worse for the visitors, Yousuf was dropped on 90 just before draw of stumps by Virender Sehwag at gully off Ajit Agarkar as he fiercely cut the ball. 

Neither the new ball bowlers, including Sourav who was also given six overs, nor spinners Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singh could test the Pakistan batsmen after India got an early breakthrough. 

Opener Butt was run out by a direct throw from Yuvraj Singh who hit bulls eye at the non-strikers end from short mid-wicket in the third over of the day as the batsman was sent back from mid pitch by Malik.

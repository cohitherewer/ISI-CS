The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Cup of youthful promise

Paris: Theo Walcott might have been dismayed by the mixture of scorn and shock that greeted his elevation to Englands World Cup squad but he should not be too concerned. 

Whether its a teenage Pele dazzling in 1958 or a fresh-faced Michael Owen searing through Argentinas defence 40 years later, World Cup history has proved that the kids are usually alright. And that bodes well for a crop of talented tyros who will be amongst the 736 players heading to a World Cup that is positively over-flowing with youthful promise. 

Leading the charge will be Argentinas prodigious young star Lionel Messi, the Barcelona star who was in scintillating form before an injury ruled him out of the final months of the season. 

Messi, who will turn 19 during the finals, is a veteran of Argentinas victorious Youth World Cup win in 2005 and has already earned favourable comparisons to his idol Diego Maradona. Even Maradona himself has waxed lyrical about Messis talent. 

What most surprises me about him is that he hasnt got control problems, Maradona said. The ball remains on the upper part of his foot, like it is glued to it. He feels the ball, and that makes him different to the rest. Hes also got another gear, a sixth speed. And the best part of all is that he hasnt reached his peak. 

As Argentina look to Messi to light up their challenge, Spain could well call upon another talented teenager, Cesc Fabregas, to provide their midfield with a good attack. 

The 19-year-old was one of the stars of Arsenals run to the final of the Champions League, and is being tipped to shine in the World Cup by former Highbury idol Paul Merson. 

If he can get in the Spain team he could be the main player in the World Cup, said Merson. Hes that good. He can maybe take Spain a little bit further than where theyve been before. 

Fabregas is joined in the Spanish ranks by another young starlet, Real Madrid defender Sergio Ramos, who became his countrys youngest player in 63 years when he appeared in a friendly against China last year aged 18. 

Ramos, who has only just turned 20, is the second most expensive teenager after beging signed from Sevilla for ?19 million. Until now, the most expensive teenager had been Englands Wayne Rooney, a snip at ?27 million when Manchester United bought him from Everton in 2004. (AFP)

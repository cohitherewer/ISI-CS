 Sania must be more consistent: Amritraj

 Sania Mirza

New Delhi: Sania Mirza on Tuesday got a pat on the back from former tennis ace Vijay Amritraj, who said there was nothing missing from the teenagers game and her progress should not be judged on a weekly basis. I see nothing wrong with Sanias game. She had done remarkably well over the last two-three years, the former Davis Cup captain said here. 

However, Amritraj said that the Hyderabadi needed to improve her consistency at the highest level of the game. 

Sania has had some good results in the last few weeks, but her wins over higher-ranked opponents, notably former world No.1 Martina Hingis in Korea, have been usually followed by reversals against players ranked below her. 

Everyone strives to be consistent but very few manage that, Amritraj, who reached a career-high ranking of 13, said. One should judge her over a whole season. As a rule, if she has five or six good weeks in a season, she can maintain her ranking. 

But he pointed out that it was more important to do well in bigger events such as the Grand Slams, Masters Series and Tier I events, as they carried more ranking points. He mentioned that world No.1 Roger Federer was an exception. Federer is on a different planet because he never lets his physical capabilities drop. 

No one questions other players like Rafael Nadal or Andy Roddick if their performances fluctuate. But Federer is head and shoulders above everyone else, Amritraj said. 

Coming back to Sania, he said that one should not compare her to other international players in her age group. Indians physically mature later than other players. We should provide Sania the encouragement to be the best she can be. Whether that happens at 19 or 26, we should not be bothered, he said. 

He said that Sania had already played a great role as a torch-bearer for Indian tennis. She has encouraged a lot of young girls to take up tennis. Now there is a larger pool of talent to choose from, Amritaj said. 

He, however, expressed concern that not many players of international class were coming up in the country. 

Indian players are not improving at the same rate as their western counterparts, he noted.Tennis nowadays is basically a singles game. One cannot stay on the circuit solely as a doubles player, Amritraj said. 

About his son Prakash, Amritraj said his progress has been slowed down by injuries. 

In work ethic and passion, Prakash is second to none. He has a strong commitment to the game, Amritraj added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 ICC to study two reports

 - Violence in Guwahati

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Calcutta: The International Cricket Council (ICC), one understands, will be studying two reports ?? not just Match Referee Roshan Mahanamas ?? on Sundays violence in Guwahati. 

According to The Telegraphs sources, its also going to be guided by regional security boss Niranjan Singh Virks communication on what happened both before and after the ODI got abandoned, without a ball being bowled. 

Inclement weather forced the abandonment. 

For the ICC, the Match Referee remains the most important person on-the-spot, but Virks report will carry weight as well? His brief isnt only to be on the lookout for any attempt at match-fixing, a source pointed out. 

While Mahanama is a former Sri Lankan one-day captain, Virk had the rank of Additional SP when he took premature retirement from the Central Bureau of Investigation. 

Neither could be reached for a comment (in Jamshedpur), but one learns their communication has already been e-mailed to Dubai, where the ICC is now headquartered. 

Sources indicated Mahanama and Virk must largely have reported facts without actually undertaking a post-mortem. 

Given the extensive coverage by the Media, they didnt have to go into details of missiles being hurled and fires being lit, another source explained. 

Trouble started even before Rudi Koertzen and A.V. Jayapra- kash ruled no play was possible. Things got worse when that announcement was made. 

The Assam Cricket Association and the local administration cut a sorry figure: Perhaps, nothing more could have been done to get the ODI started, but the non-cricket bandobast was found wanting. 

Till late on Tuesday, it wasnt clear how the ICC would react. Safety is a priority for the world body.

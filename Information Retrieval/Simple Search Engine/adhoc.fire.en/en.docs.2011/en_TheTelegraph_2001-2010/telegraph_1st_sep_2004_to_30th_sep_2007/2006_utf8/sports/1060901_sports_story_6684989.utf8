The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Second goal was special: Dipendu

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Expectedly, reporters made a beeline for the hattrick man. A tired but satisfied Dipendu played down his achievement. 

We just wanted to win, thats all, was all he would say. Pressed, the veteran striker said, We still have a long, long way to go But scoring a hattrick feels nice. The pitch also was in good condition, which went in our favour. 

Later, when the euphoria had died down, Dipendu rated the teams and his second goal as the best. That was a special one, he said, adding, the last one was tougher though. 

On certain days you become lucky. We had been playing well, but fortune was not favouring us. Today, all my hits found the net. Thats the difference, I guess, the reserved Dipendu said. 

With six goals already, the Bagan sniper can do no wrong, it seems. 

Coach Biswajit Bhattacharya said Dipendu had always been special. He is a great player. There never was any question over his fitness. I had always maintained that if my key players play well, we would sail through. That is not to say that we have reached our best. But we are getting there. 

Trouble is, we are not getting time and players to experiment with the formations, Biswajit said. 

Gautam, the young talent, is slowly coming to terms with the crowd, the atmosphere. Lalawmpuia needs more time. But we are improving, thats the most encouraging sign, he added.

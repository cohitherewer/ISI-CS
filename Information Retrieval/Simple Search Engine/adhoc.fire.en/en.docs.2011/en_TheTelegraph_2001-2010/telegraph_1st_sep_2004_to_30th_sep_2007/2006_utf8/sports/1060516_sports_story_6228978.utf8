 WI complete 5-0 rout over Zimbabwe

Port-of-Spain: The West Indies completed a 5-0 series win over Zimbabwe when they clinched the seventh and final ODI by 104 runs. 

Dwayne Smith snared four wickets for 29 runs as Zimbabwe, chasing 267, were dismissed for 162 in 49 overs. 

The Caribbeans, who would face a much stiffer examination against India, also completed back-to-back victories by five wickets and 98 runs in the first two matches at St Johns, an 82-run win last Sunday at Georgetown, and a 10-wicket triumph last Wednesday at Gros Islet. 

The third ODI at Georgetown was abandoned without a ball being bowled owing to rain, and the rain-affected sixth match here on Saturday was also abandoned with no result. 

Brendon Taylor struck five fours on Sunday to top score for Zimbabwe with 43 from 82 balls and Vusi Sibanda gave him support with 42 off 82 balls that contained two boundaries.

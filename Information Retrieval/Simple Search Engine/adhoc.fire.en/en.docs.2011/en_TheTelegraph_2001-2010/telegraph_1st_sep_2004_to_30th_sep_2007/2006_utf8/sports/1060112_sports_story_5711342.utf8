London: A debut goal from Austrian defender Paul Scharner gave Wigan Athletic a 1-0 victory over twice former winners Arsenal in a League Cup semi-final first leg interrupted by a power failure on Tuesday. 

Scharner, who came on as a 33rd-minute substitute for the injured Lee McCulloch, rose at the far post to powerfully head in a deep cross from Gary Teale with 12 minutes remaining. 

I was really disappointed with our first-half performance but we responded in the second half and all credit to the players, Wigan manager Paul Jewell told Sky Sports. 

They gave it everything they had and deserved to win. In the second half we were so much better and I was pleased we showed what we are all about. 

Promoted Wigan, riding high in sixth place in their first season in the Premier League, made seven changes for their maiden appearance in the semi-finals of a major cup competition. Arsenal, who rested captain Thierry Henry, also made four alterations to the team which beat Cardiff City 2-1 in the FA Cup third round on Saturday. 

Both sides seemed affected by the wholesale changes with only one shot on target in the opening period. 

Teales low free kick forced a diving side from visiting goalkeeper Manuel Almunia while Freddie Ljungberg missed a good chance at the other end, spooning a 12-metre shot over the crossbar. 

A floodlight failure plunged the stadium into darkness and interrupted the match for 15 minutes early in the second half. 

Its a new one for me. I was as surprised as anyone when the lights went out but you have to be guided by the experts, said referee Howard Webb. Goalmouth incidents were few and far between when the players returned to the field. 

Former Arsenal fan Scharner then struck the only goal to help Wigan take a narrow lead into the second leg at Highbury on January 24. 

Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger said: The most disappointing thing was that we didnt score and didnt create a lot of chances. In the second half it became more difficult to play and when it became more physical they got on top of us. 

Alessandro Del Piero hit a hattrick to become Juventuss all-time top scorer as the Turin side crushed Fiorentina 4-1 (6-3 on aggregate) to ease into the Italian Cup quarter finals on Tuesday. 

The 31-year-old striker took his tally to 185 in all competitions, surpassing the previous record of 182 he held jointly with Giampiero Boniperti, whose tally came between 1947 and 1961. 

It was Boniperti, then president of the club, who brought Del Piero to Juventus from Serie B side Padova in 1993. 

Del Piero has struck 127 times in the Italian championship with the rest of his goals coming in domestic and international cup competitions. 

Juventus stamped their authority on the tie with three goals in the opening 21 minutes. 

Del Piero swept home a low cross from close range and grabbed his second with a curling free kick. He also played a part in Juventuss third, firing Pavel Nedveds cross at keeper Sebastian Frey, whose block dropped kindly into the path of Adrian Mutu to score.

 Why am I not in reckoning, asks Sharma

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Guwahati: Having opened up the game for his team with a swashbuckling century at the Nehru Stadium here on Sunday, North Zone allrounder Joginder Sharma opened up a bit after the days play. 

Ive been doing quite well in the domestic circuit but dont know why I am not in the national reckoning, said the 24-year-old who played in three ODIs against Bangladesh in 2004. 

I had got 56 wickets in Ranji Trophy last season and scored 350-odd runs. With back-to-back century in Duleep Trophy, this season has also started on the right note for me. 

I just want to do well in the next match, if we reach the final, and Ranji season and force myself back in reckoning. My job is just to perform and will do just that. 

On Sundays knock, surely to be remembered by the East bowlers for the contempt with which he treated them, the Rohtak-born Sharma said, I am satisfied... it came on a track which is taking turn. 

North captain Mithun Manhas said they were looking at a target of 550. But now we are looking forward to dismissing them as early as possible, he said.

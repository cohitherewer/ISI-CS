 Dempo thrash JCT 3-0

 National League

 Panaji: After several inconsistent 

 performances in the recent past, defending champions Dempo 

 Sports Club started their campaign in the second leg of 

 the 10th National Football League for the ONGC Cup in style 

 with a resounding 3-0 win over JCT Mills, Phagwara, at the 

 Duler Ground on Friday.

 All the goals came in the first 

 half, with Nacemento Silveira putting Dempo ahead in the 

 21st minute from a rebound after an Edwardo Silva free-kick 

 hit the post.

 Nigerian Ranty Martins doubled 

 the lead in the 25th minute off a pass by Clifford Miranda.

 Isfaq Ahmed put the match beyond 

 the reach of the Millmen when he scored after a solo run 

 to take Dempos tally to 13 points from 10 matches.

 JCT, who are known for their steady 

 approach, failed to impress, although they tried to score 

 on a few occasions in the second half. They remain on 10 

 points from as many matches.

 Dempo coach Armando Colaco was 

 happy with the win. (PTI)

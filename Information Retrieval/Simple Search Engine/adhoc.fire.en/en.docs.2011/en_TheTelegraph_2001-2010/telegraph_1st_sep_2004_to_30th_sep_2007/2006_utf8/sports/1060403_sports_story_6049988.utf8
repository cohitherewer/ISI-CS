 Dont compare Raina to Sachin yet, says Dravid

Margao: Rahul Dravid feels that keeping Rudra Pratap Singh out of the playing XI was a tough decision to take. The seamer has been relegated to the benches for no fault of his. 

Its been hard on RP. He is part of a select group of players we have been working on. He is a good prospect and is part of our scheme of things. We are trying to find the right combination and he has unfortunately missed out. 

The others have been performing well. He is, though, gaining rich experience and learning a lot by being with the team. He has a long career ahead and lot of cricket left. Theres no need to panic for him, the Team India captain said. 

Dravid took the opportunity to heap praise again on Faridabad hero Suresh Raina, but felt the British media should have shown more restraint when comparing him with Sachin Tendulkar. 

He is an exciting talent. These are early days for him. Some people tend to draw comparisons very quickly. 

Allow him to keep his foot firmly on ground. I know he is aware of his responsibilities. It was just a glimpse of what he can do. He is sure to go through ups and downs in his career and counter different challenges. How he handles all that will prove to be crucial. 

Dravid was all smiles when at the media conference someone wanted to know if he put his right foot first on the crease while taking guard out. 

I never knew that... I thought I put my left foot first. Maybe I will be a bit more aware on Monday and try to find whether I was right or wrong, he quipped. 

Meanwhile, the TV crew had problems placing their cameras at one end of the ground after the sight screen was raised following a request from the Indians.

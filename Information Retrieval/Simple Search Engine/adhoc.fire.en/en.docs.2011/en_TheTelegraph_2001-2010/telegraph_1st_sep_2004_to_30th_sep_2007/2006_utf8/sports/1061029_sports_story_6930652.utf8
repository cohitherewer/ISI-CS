 Dalmiya raises objections 

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: Former BCCI president Jagmohan Dalmiya has raised questions over the neutrality of the disciplinary committee, which has summoned him to appear on Sunday. He has also claimed that the adjudication process against him stands invalid. 

In a 12-page letter to BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah, Dalmiya pointed out that since the criminal complaint against him over alleged funds misappropriation was filed by BCCI president Sharad Pawar (through Shah), and he himself has been a party to the decision making process, neutrality of the committee is not unquestionable. The disciplinary committee is chaired by Pawar. 

Dalmiya also claimed that as per the BCCI rules and regulations, a disciplinary committee on any issue should resolve a dispute within six months. 

Because the process against him had started on February 27 this year, it was no longer valid and as a result, there could not be any adjudication pending against him. 

However, sources close to Dalmiya said that that he has no objection to appear before a high court-appointed committee.

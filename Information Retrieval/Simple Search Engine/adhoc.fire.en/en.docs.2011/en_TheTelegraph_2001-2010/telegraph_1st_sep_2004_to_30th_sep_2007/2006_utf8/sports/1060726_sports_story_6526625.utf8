Los Angeles: Defending champion Andre Agassi launched his final hard court campaign with a determined 7-6, 6-0 win over Belgiums Xavier Malisse to reach the second round of the Los Angeles Open on Monday. 

Agassi, who has said he will retire after the US Open, entered the home stretch of his career in impressive fashion falling behind 1-3 before rallying to take the opening set in a tie-break 12-10 after saving three set points. 

The eight-time Grand Slam winner then showed his class and fitness in the second set conceding just three points on his serve as he raced past the wilting Belgian in the searing 110 degree Fahrenheit heat. 

Agassi, who has not seen action since a third-round loss to Rafael Nadal at Wimbledon, is seeking a fifth title in Los Angeles. 

It will be the final title defence of the fifth-seeded Americans glittering career having claimed his 60th title at the event last year. 

Im still out there with a competitive spirit, Agassi said. 

Im looking forward to this summer and in some regards Im in denial about it being my last summer out here. 

Im aware of how lifes going to change and Im out there wanting it to last as long and as good as possible, he said. 

Agassi, the No. 5 seed, is the defending champion of this $500,000 event and has won it four times. 

In other first-round action, third seed Fernando Gonzalez of Chile battled past last years losing finalist Gilles Muller of Luxembourg 7-6 (7-5), 7-6 (7-5) while eighth seeded Russian Dmitry Tursunov also needed a pair of tie-breaks to tame Thailands Danai Udomchoke 7-6 (7-5), 7-6 (7-4).

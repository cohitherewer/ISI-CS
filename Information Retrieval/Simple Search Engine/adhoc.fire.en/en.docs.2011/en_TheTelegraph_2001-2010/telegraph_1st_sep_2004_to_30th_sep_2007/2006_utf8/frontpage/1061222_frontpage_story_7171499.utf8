 1999 will 

 Yash Birla accepted as

 an executor of MP Birla rsquo;s 1982 will

 Lodha has filed for probate of the 1999 will, while the Birla family is trying to get the court to accept the mutual, but separate, wills of MP and Priyamvada Birla of 1982 

Calcutta, Dec. 21: Basant Kumar Birla cannot contest Rajendra Singh Lodhas claim to the estate of M.P. Birla for some time.

 A division bench of Calcutta High Court, comprising Justice Pinaki Chandra Ghose and Justice Tapan Kumar Dutta, dismissed his appeal to challenge M.P. Birlas widow Priyamvadas will, executed in 1999, when it comes up for probate, or legal authentication. 

 Two other Birlas Krishna Kant and Yashovardhan will also have to sit out the legal battle for the time being. The court held that only G.P. Birla, an executor of the will Priyamvada drew up in 1982, had the right to contest Lodhas claim to the estate, valued in excess of Rs 2,500 crore. 

 The Birlas will go in appeal to the Supreme Court.

 In 2005, Justice Kalyan Jyoti Sengupta held that these three members of the Birla family have no interest in connection with Priyamvadas 1999 will. The appeal court affirmed that view, which is also the contention of my client, said a spokesperson for Fox amp; Mondal, Lodhas solicitors.

 The Lodha camp, however, did not challenge the interest caveatable interest in legal parlance of M.P. Birlas two sisters, Radha Devi and Laxmi Devi. A will can be probated only after the court decides who has a legally valid interest in the case. 

 Todays verdict means the Birla trio has lost their case of caveatable interest to Lodha. 

 Lodha, once a close confidant of the Birlas, has been fighting a fierce legal battle with the Birla family over the assets of the M.P. Birla group since July 2004, after Priyamvadas death. Lodha says Priyamvada made him the sole successor to her estate through the 1999 will. 

 In August 2004, the Birla family had produced two mutual wills executed by M.P. Birla and his wife in 1982 contesting the veracity of the 1999 will. 

 Today, the high courts division bench accepted that Lodha, an executor of Priyamvadas 1999 will, had an interest in M.P. Birlas will of 1982. 

 A spokesperson for Khaitan amp; Co, solicitors for the Birlas, said: We think the three members of the Birla family have an interest in the case and so we have decided to appeal to the Supreme Court. 

 The Birlas said the verdict had maintained status quo. They found two reasons to be happy: G.P. Birlas right to contest the 1999 will and Yashovardhans acceptance as an executor of M.P. Birlas 1982 will.

 CPM vandals arrested

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Runu Sinha 

 Calcutta, May 3: In a rare display of brisk action against activists of the ruling CPM, police have arrested six people for an attack on a family in Dum Dum.

 Among the arrested is Swapan Saha, the powerful CPM councillor of ward 14 in the Left-controlled Dum Dum municipality.

 As reported in The Telegraph over the past three days, the councillor and his associates had unleashed terror on Saraswati Sinha and her family because they had refused to part with a portion of their premises for a club.

 The gang vandalised her house and assaulted her daughter Runu and son Somnath on Friday.

 Praveen Kumar, the superintendent of police, North 24-Parganas, confirmed the arrest of the six CPM men.

 Saraswati, who hasnt yet returned to her house, said: We are happy the culprits have been brought to book.

 The quick police action comes 

 in the backdrop of the ongoing Assembly elections, a time 

 when the CPM would not want to risk negative publicity.

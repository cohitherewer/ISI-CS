 Infosys sees Indian renaissance from city

 OUR BUREAU

 Bangalore, April 14: Infosys today paid Calcutta a compliment that not even the most outrageous optimist about the city ? and that includes the chief minister ? would have imagined possible.

 Indian renaissance in the 21st century is going to come from Calcutta, like it did in the 19th century, Infosys chief financial officer T.V. Mohandas Pai said.

 Pai has been negotiating with the government for some months about setting up operations in Calcutta.

 Were really glad and excited, IT minister Manabendra Mukherjee said.

 With only three days to go before the first phase of Assembly elections, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee could not have asked for a more glowing certificate and this time the Election Commission might not find anything objectionable. 

 Pai, who stepped down from his position today but will continue as a director of Infosys, visited the city in March to scout for locations.

 He told The Telegraph: We have had a good dialogue with the chief minister and were extremely impressed by his attitude and actions. We are quite hopeful that something positive will work out in the very near future.

 Pai said he would return to Calcutta 

 once the polls get over to resume the dialogue. On 

 our last visit we had seen a number of locations and have 

 liked the Rajarhat/New Town area. We hope to talk specifics 

 the next time we come down.

 Axe on green board boss

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Ranchi, Nov. 4: The state government sacked the chairman of Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board (JSPCB) Tileshwar Sahu today apparently in its first move to annul the political appointments made by the previous NDA government. 

 Development commissioner A.K. Chug has been given the additional charge of the board chief, sources said. The JSPCB office today received a letter, dated November 3, 2006, in this regard from the deputy secretary of environment and forests department, Subhash Chandra Sinha. 

 JSPCB sources said the stipulated tenure of a pollution board head is three years and Sahu could move appropriate court against the government order. However, taking into count the present political equations, it is unlikely that Sahu would move the court to get a stay on the governments order.

 Sahu could not be contacted for his comments but deputy chief minister Sudhir Mahto, who also holds the forests and environment portfolio, said the process for removal of Sahu was on for quite some time and the action was taken at the appropriate moment.

 Sahu was appointed the JSPCB chief last year by the then Arjun Munda government through a notification issued on May 11, 2005. 

 Significantly, the JSPCB chief was in jail for 32 days in connection with a murder case under Kamdara police station in Gumla district. He was released from a Gumla jail yesterday after Jharkhand High Court granted him bail.

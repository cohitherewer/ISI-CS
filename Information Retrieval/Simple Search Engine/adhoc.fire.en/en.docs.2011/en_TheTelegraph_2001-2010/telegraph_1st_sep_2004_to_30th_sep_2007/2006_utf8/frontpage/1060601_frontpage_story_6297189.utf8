 US plans missile gift to Pak

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Washington, May 31: The Bush administration plans to significantly bolster Pakistans defences by giving permission to Islamabad to dip into US missile manufacturing capacity.

 Barring objections from the US Congress, the administrations effort will give Pakistan 130 new Block II Harpoon missiles. 

 Thirty of the missiles will be for launch from aircraft. Of the remainder, 50 each will be capable of being launched from submarines and from naval ships.

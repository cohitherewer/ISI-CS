 Kalam to open global Infocom

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Kalam

Calcutta, Dec. 5: Five years ago, a small step was taken to promote Bengal as an investment destination for IT and IT enabled services companies.

 In its fifth edition, Infocom 2006 the biggest information, communication and technology (ICT) exposition organised by Nasscom and Businessworld, an ABP Group publication, has stepped out of the regional fold with an aim to throw open the global business corridor to Indias knowledge-driven companies. 

 Despite the potential, our IT industry remains under-penetrated in the world market. The objective is to provide the right platform, said Kiran Karnik, president, Nasscom, rolling out the agenda for the meet from December 6 to 10.

 President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam will flag off the conference-cum-exhibition. Bengal IT minister Debesh Das will be present at the inaugural ceremony.

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee will interact with delegates on Day Two.

 From tying up with CeBIT, the worlds biggest ICT fair, to roping in the Malaysian government and signing up with tech majors as sponsors to inviting delegates from China, Taiwan and Germany the global objective touches every aspect of Infocom 2006.

 Over 1,500 delegates will participate in brainstorming sessions. The speakers include Stephen Felice of Dell, John Landau of VSNL International, Jignesh Shah of MCX, T. Srinivasan of Mercury India, Ramamurthy Sivakumar of Intel Technology India and Niru Mehta of Avaya GlobalConnect.

 As the theme of Infocom 2006 is Innovate to Differentiate, one of the thrust areas will be promoting innova- tion. At the 100,000 sq ft exhibition venue with 500- plus stalls the National Council of Science Museums will set up a pavilion to showcase 30 innovative ideas of the young.

 A knowledge work- shop will be organised to expose students of vernacular- medium schools to the world of IT.

 The other attractions for GenX will be The Telegraph Job Mart and the Careergraph Edu Fair.

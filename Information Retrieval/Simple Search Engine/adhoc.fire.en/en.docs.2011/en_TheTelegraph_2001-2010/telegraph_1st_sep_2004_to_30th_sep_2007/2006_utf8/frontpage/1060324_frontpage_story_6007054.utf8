 Mumbai, March 23: An FIR filed at a Mumbai police station will force Indian crickets former boss, Jagmohan Dalmiya, to face police grilling on seven days for alleged embezzlement of World Cup 1996 funds.

 Bombay High Court today asked the former Board of Control for Cricket in India president and three former board officials ? S.K. Nair, Kishore Rungta and Jyoti Bajpai ? to attend an inquiry by Mumbai polices economic offences wing in Mumbai and Calcutta.

 The four accused must report at the wings Unit 3 office at Crawford Market police headquarters on March 27, 28, 29 and 31. The investigators will later travel to Calcutta to question them on April 3, 4 and 5. The grilling will last from 11 am to 5 pm on all seven days.

 The police are probing the charge in the FIR, filed by board secretary Niranjan Shah on March 16, that the four officials had misappropriated board funds, falsified accounts and committed cheating, forgery, criminal breach of trust and criminal conspiracy.

 The high court deferred to April 10 the hearing of the anticipatory bail plea of the accused and extended the interim protection against their possible arrest till then. The judge also barred them from travelling abroad without the courts permission.

 The board has accused Dalmiya of misappropriating about Rs 20 crore relating to the 1996 World Cup. The defence argued that Dalmiya was being victimised by the current board. 

 Sources close to Dalmiya said he would leave for Mumbai on March 27.

 Dalmiya today sent his reply to the boards show-cause notice in keeping with a Calcutta High Court directive. Its a 16-page reply with seven pages of supporting documents.

 Mine explodes on Naga militant

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Kohima, June 20: An activist of the NSCN (Isak-Muivah) was today killed in a landmine explosion near Athibung, in Peren district of Nagaland.

 The NSCN (I-M) member, identified as Diamond Tangkhul, was a corporal of the outfit. Sources in the NSCN (I-M) claimed the explosion occurred when the activist approached the gate to a camp of the India Reserve Battalion near Athibung town. 

 Athibung has been the flashpoint of clashes between the NSCN (I-M) and its main rival, the S.S Khaplang faction. Several members of both groups have been killed in these periodic battles. 

 We dont know whether the landmine was planted by the India Reserve Battalion or men of the Khaplang group, said Kraibo Chawang, the outfits deputy kilonser (minister) for information and publicity. 

 The police could not be contacted owing to poor telecommunication links with the area. 

 Chawang accused the rival faction of allegedly planting landmines in connivance with the United National Liberation Front in Tamenglong district of Manipur, too. Several people and cattle have been killed in landmine explosions, he claimed. 

 Asked why the two NSCN factions could not reconcile with each other, as they recently did in Zunheboto town following pressure from residents, Chawang said the Khaplang group was hand-in-glove with the Assam Rifles and other security agencies. 

 Maoist attack

 Naxalites killed two tribal CPM leaders who refused to quit the party in a West Bengal village early this morning, reports our correspondent from Asannagar in Nadia district. 

 What has rung alarm bells is that Maoist guerrillas have struck outside their bastion for the first time, gunning down the two CPM leaders in a village in Nadia district.

 Clad in black combat outfits and brandishing muskets, the gang of 20 swooped on Chandpur, about 120 km from Calcutta, and pumped bullets into Swapan Sardar and his neighbour Uttam Sardar.

 Nadia police superintendent R. Rajshekharan said the duo had been killed because they flouted the Maoist diktat to quit the CPM.

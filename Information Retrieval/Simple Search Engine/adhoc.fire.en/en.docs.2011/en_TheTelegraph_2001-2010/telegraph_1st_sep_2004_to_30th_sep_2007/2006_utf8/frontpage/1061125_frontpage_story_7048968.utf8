 Pawar-hitting after debacle

 Nov. 24: The 

 Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) president, 

 Sharad Pawar, has overruled an informal administrative 

 decision on not sending any selector to South Africa.

 A Union minister, Pawar went into overdrive this morning after MPs across party lines reacted strongly to Indias huge 157-run defeat in the Durban ODI on Wednesday.

 [I want the selection committee chairman (Dilip Vengsarkar) to communicate the feelings of the countrymen, Pawar told a news channel.]

 The president has the powers to change anything We wanted all the (senior) selectors to focus exclusively on domestic cricket, but its different now, BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah informed The Telegraph.

 Earlier this year, the Pawar regime started the practice of one selector being present (by rotation) at every Test and ODI on major tours, but there had been much dilly-dallying over South Africa.

 The selectors, it may be recalled, were there throughout in Pakistan (January-February) and the West Indies (May-July).

 Pawar wanted Vengsarkar to leave immediately, but was told that wouldnt be possible owing to the Test squads selection on November 30.

 The head-for-South Africa ball began rolling after Pawar spoke to Vengsarkar before setting out for Parliament.

 Id called Mr Pawar yesterday, to enquire about his health, but couldnt speak to him in person. Today, he returned my call, Vengsarkar said. 

 Later, Pawar spoke to chief administrative officer Ratnakar Shetty, who will coordinate the travel. 

 Its not confirmed, but Im likely to go for just the first two Tests Right now, I dont know about the third and final one, Vengsarkar added.

 While the five-match ODI series ends on December 3, the Tests are between December 15 and January 6. In between the ODIs is a Twenty20 International, too.

 Vengsarkar, obviously, is going to have a significant say in the composition of the XI. As the possibility of a difference in opinion between him and the Big Two Rahul Dravid and Greg Chappell cant be ruled out, his presence can actually add to the pressure on the captain and coach.

 But, then, the feeling in many quarters is that Dravid and Chappell (not necessarily in that order) have often been whimsical in recent months.

 For the record, Vengsarkar only said: Weve got to be patient The itinerary should have been different, allowing at least three warm-up matches Adjusting to conditions in South Africa and Australia takes time. 

 Look at England, they arrived in Australia at least a fortnight before the first Test and played three warm-up matches Its another story that theyve still begun badly Those things happen I have faith in Dravid and Chappell I have faith in the boys as well.

 Pawar, by the way, has accepted 

 there ought to have been three-four warm-up matches. 

 Well, then, why did the BCCI approve such a poor itinerary?

 Uranium delivery 

 GAUTAM DATT

 New 

 Delhi, March 17: The first consignment of nuclear 

 fuel from Russia for the Tarapur atomic power plant is arriving 

 by this weekend, as had been reported in The Telegraph earlier.

 The low-enriched uranium fuel will be flown directly to Mumbai, sources said, as Prime Minister Manmohan Singh reinforces Indias civilian nuclear relations with Russia even as he opens similar possibilities with the US. 

 Singh, who had talks for two hours with his Russian counterpart Mikhail Fradkov, thanked Moscow for the decision, hoping for expansion of cooperation in civilian nuclear energy. 

 Delhi had asked for 60 tonnes of uranium, which the Russians have agreed to provide. India is also believed to have requested Russia to hasten supply of material and equipment for the Kudankulam nuclear project.

 The two sides signed several agreements 

 today.

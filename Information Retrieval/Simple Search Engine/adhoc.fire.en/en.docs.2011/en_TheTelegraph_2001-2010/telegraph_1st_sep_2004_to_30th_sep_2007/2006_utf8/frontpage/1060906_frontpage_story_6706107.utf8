 Warning about terror attacks

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 5: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said today that there were intelligence warnings about a possible escalation in terrorist activities.

 His statement was accompanied by a call to police forces to return to basics by making the beat constable a key part of the counter-terrorism strategy.

 Singh told a conference of chief ministers that intelligence agencies had warned of a further intensification of violent activities by externally inspired and directed terrorist outfits in the country.

 Reports also suggest that terrorist modules and sleeper cells exist in some of our urban areas, all of which highlight the seriousness of the threat.

 As he asked states and local intelligence to be alert to this threat, Singh told the chief ministers that unless the beat constable is brought into the vortex of our counter-terrorist strategy, our capacity to pre-empt future attacks would be severely limited.

 The intelligence agencies have spoken about the possibility of more suicide attacks, picking economic and religious targets and vital installations.

 In the backdrop of the controversy over the crackdown in Mumbai after the blasts, Singh warned of the adverse consequences of the prevailing insecurity among the minorities, which could be extremely deleterious for our polity.

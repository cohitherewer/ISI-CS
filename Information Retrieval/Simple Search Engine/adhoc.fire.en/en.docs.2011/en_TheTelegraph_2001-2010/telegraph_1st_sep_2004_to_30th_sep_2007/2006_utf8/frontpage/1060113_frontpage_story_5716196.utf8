 Sourav looks at opening test

 - As manager, Raj Singh speaks up for former skipper

Lahore, Jan. 12: Given 

 the overnight drama, anything is possible. However, as of 

 late this evening, Sourav Ganguly was hours away from opening 

 for the first time in a decade of Test cricket.

 According to The Telegraphs sources in the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), manager Raj Singh Dungarpur was assigned to convince captain Rahul Dravid and, more important, coach Greg Chappell about the need to include Sourav in the series-launching Test at the Gaddafi from tomorrow.

 Till the other day, Raj Singh had been tearing into the former captain. But, then, thats past.

 For now, at least.

 Apparently, the captain and coachs initial (and consistent) stand was that the in-form Yuvraj Singh wouldnt be sacrificed and Sourav could only make it as vice-captain Virender Sehwags partner. Its not confirmed, but Dravid may himself have informed his predecessor about the new role.

 While interacting with the Media, though, Dravid declined to declare even the Team India XII. Sourav, too, didnt reveal anything.

 Contacted at the Pearl Continental, he said: I have no comment.? Its for the captain and coach to decide where I fit in.? Obviously, whatever the requirement, Im going to give my best shot.

 When up against Shoaib Akhtar, it can hardly be otherwise.

 Going by the sequence of events this morning, Dravid probably briefed Sourav before nets, at the Gaddafi. 

 And, to start with, the former captain and Sehwag had the first hit. Then, Sourav went over to the adjacent Academy for at least 20 minutes at the bowling machine.

 For the first time since arriving six days ago, Sourav had a spring in his step. That the Test wicket is sans grass and the chill has lessened should make him more comfortable. If a reminder is needed, Sourav was selected as a specialist middle-order batsman, an improvement on the all-rounder status bestowed before the recent Tests versus Sri Lanka.

 The move for Souravs comeback --- he didnt play the last Test, in Motera --- was initiated late last evening after a very senior BCCI official telephoned Raj Singh, asking him to place a suggestion before Dravid and Chappell.

 Basically, that it would be sensible to utilise the former captains experience (86 Tests) in a tough series. What, perhaps, wasnt conveyed is that relegating Sourav to the reserves would start another controversy. If he didnt have a place in the XI, what was the point of bringing him to Pakistan?

 Its another matter that Kiran More and Co. will now struggle to explain why they chose three openers (Sehwag, Gautam Gambhir and Wasim Jaffer) if somebody who has just done the job in ODIs had to partner the vice-captain.

 In fact, its also a big climbdown for Chappell who, at the pre-departure Media conference in New Delhi, had highlighted the presence of specialist openers.

 If what youre saying is correct, then its not a bad deal... Sourav has faced the new ball in over 200 (209, to be precise) ODIs and must make the most of this opportunity... Its a challenge, but thats the test, remarked former India opener Arun Lal, who has known Sourav from close.

 Whatever the conditions and the experience of opening in ODIs, its much more than a challenge. At 33, it couldnt have got any tougher for Sourav. His fingers need to remain crossed, albeit for a different reason.

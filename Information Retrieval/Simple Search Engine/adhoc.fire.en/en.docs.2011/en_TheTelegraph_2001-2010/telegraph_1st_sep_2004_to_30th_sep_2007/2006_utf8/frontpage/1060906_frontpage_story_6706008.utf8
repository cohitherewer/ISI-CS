 Ranchi, Sept. 5: A bitter Arjun Munda today vowed to fight back and promised a response that will send opponents running for cover. 

 A tired and grim-looking Munda was addressing party workers at the BJP office soon after flying back from New Delhi this evening.

 When I was attending a meeting at the Prime Ministers residence on internal security and threats posed by extremists seeking to destabilise the nation, some extremists were hatching a conspiracy in a five star hotel in Delhi to destabilise my government, he declared. 

 Moved at seeing a large number of party workers at the airport to receive him, Munda apparently took an impromptu decision to address them.

 Ranchi has become a battlefield; some elements have thrown a challenge at us and we accept it, he said before calling upon party workers to prepare for a long-drawn battle ahead.

 Earlier, in New Delhi Munda continued to claim that there was no threat to his government. Even after receiving reports that four ministers were about to resign and reduce his government to a minority, Munda put up a brave face and said he was ready to face the trial of strength in the House.

 Reconciled to losing power, however, the NDA has apparently started preparing for a debate on a confidence motion in the Assembly. They would take the opportunity to expose the rebels and make them accountable for a possible dissolution of the House in the near future.

 Earlier, angry and unruly BJP workers organised a hostile reception for the rebels at the Birsa Munda Airport. 

 Armed with sticks, they raised slogans against Madhu Koda and Anosh Ekka, jostled with security personnel and rebel supporters, and rained blows on the vehicles, damaging windscreens.

 They were particularly severe on the private vehicle in which Madhu Koda and Kamlesh Singh were being driven to Raj Bhavan.

 New Delhi, Sept. 24: The Indian driver of a woman employee of the Belgian embassy here killed her by repeatedly knifing her apparently after a quarrel.

 Isabelle Dissoy, 45, was stabbed 22 times by Vijay Pal Chaudhary and was announced dead on arrival at Safdarjung Hospital around 10 pm yesterday.

 Dissoy, secretary to the Belgian ambassador, was found dead in the kitchen of her rented ground-floor apartment in the upmarket south Delhi locality of Vasant Vihar.

 Chaudhary, who, the police say, had fled in Dissoys embassy car after committing the murder, surrendered this evening at the Ramakrishna Puram police station, where a case of murder has been registered.

 Four other suspects, including the landlord of the apartment, have been detained for questioning.

 According to the police, Dissoy and Chaudhary had an argument on Saturday afternoon, when the driver had gone to pick her up after swimming at a nearby sports club.

 They again had an argument in the evening, when the woman was supposed to go to a dinner appointment, said the deputy commissioner of police (southwest), Ravindra Yadav.

 At the time of the argument around 8.30 pm, Dissoys 14-year-old son, who studies at the French School here, had gone to the market, apparently with some friends. Her husband is in Belgium.

 Chaudhary attacked Dissoy in her kitchen repeatedly with a knife the police say he picked up there.

 This is the second time in recent years that an embassy employee has been attacked in the capital. In 2003, a Swiss diplomat was kidnapped and repeatedly raped after she came out of a south Delhi auditorium.

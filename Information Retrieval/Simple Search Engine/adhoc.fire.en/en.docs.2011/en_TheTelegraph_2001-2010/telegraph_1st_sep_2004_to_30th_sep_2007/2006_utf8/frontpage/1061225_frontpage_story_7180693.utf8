 Soren back to old guard

 SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA

 Ranchi, Dec. 24: Confused, Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) chief Shibu Soren has pitched for his old lawyers Varun Sinha and Sanjiv Kumar to appeal against his conviction in Delhi High Court.

 Both the lawyers, hailing from Jharkhand, conducted the cases involving Soren and had left in the middle of the trial period in the Shashinath Jha murder case. They had apparently developed differences with Guruji (as Soren is known in political circles) over personal issues.

 Soren was said to be confused over selection of a lawyer in view of the demand from a some to get a Rajya Sabha berth from Jharkhand as their court fee.

 Confirming his engagement in the case, Sinha, who practises in Supreme Court and Delhi High Court, said he was studying the judgment and would file the appeal soon.

 We are yet to decide on a senior counsel to conduct the case in the high court, he told The Telegraph.

 The Tees Hazari court had delivered the judgment on November 28 this year. JMM sources, however, said Sorens sons have also consulted R.K. Anand and a lawyer from south India.

 The appeal could be filed within 90 days of the lower courts verdict.

 Meanwhile, the JMM has decided to use the incarceration of Soren in Tihar jail to cash in on the sentiments of people and strengthen the party organisation in Jharkhand, besides Bihar, Orissa and Bengal.

 Beginning tomorrow, the JMM will hold the nyay aam sabha (public meeting for justice) in various districts till February 2. The programme would be followed by a jail bharo abhiyan.

 Besides, the party would organise a nyay satyagraha at the district headquarters. The objective is to expose the misdeeds of the CBI in implicating Soren without any valid reasons.

 JMM parliamentarian Hemlal Murmu said the party has arranged several programmes against the CBI, and these events will give momentum to our agitation to convince the people about the CBIs evil designs.

 Significantly, we have received good response in the rural hinterland but not in the urban areas, said a JMM leader who has participated in the programmes.

 JMM youth wing president Binod Pandey said as those staying in places like rural Garhwa and Palamau were not aware of the cases against Soren, it was a good opportunity to expand their base with the help of the programmes.

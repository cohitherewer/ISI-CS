 Quota steps into lobbying phase

 - Legislation sent to panel with power to suggest amendments, Delhi medicos suspend agitation

 New Delhi, Aug. 25: In 

 a decision that pleases all, the Centre today introduced 

 the quota bill in Parliament and sent it to a standing committee, 

 buying time for everyone concerned while keeping the legislation 

 on course.

 An immediate fallout was the suspension 

 of protests which have seen medicos clashing with police 

 on the capitals streets against the decision to 

 reserve 27 per cent seats in higher education for other 

 backward classes.

 We have decided to suspend 

 our agitation, said Vinod Patro of the AIIMS Resident 

 Doctors Association. Students continued their protests 

 elsewhere, but it was only in Delhi that these had been 

 a serious headache for the government.

 The stage is now set for hectic 

 lobbying over three months as the standing committee hears 

 all the parties from students to politicians that want 

 a say. It is empowered to recommend changes to the bill, 

 which it will place in Parliament in the winter session.

 This leaves the door ajar for 

 amendments like exclusion of the creamy layer from quotas, 

 which the Left has been pushing for. We will try to 

 get the creamy layer excluded, CPM politburo member 

 Sitaram Yechury said.

 The government, particularly the 

 health ministry that was grappling with hospital strikes, 

 can breathe easy as confrontation gives way to another spell 

 of negotiations. And the anti-quota students are happy to 

 have more time to fight. We will now try to organise 

 ourselves in a better way, mobilise public opinion in our 

 favour and explore legal options, Patro said.

 The bill itself is not under threat 

 as it has the support of all political parties, none of 

 whom would dare scupper a legislation that impacts the large 

 OBC population 52 per cent of the total population. As 

 today was the last day of the session, it would in any case 

 be passed only in the winter session.

 It is now the norm to refer bills, 

 except the most inconsequential, to a standing committee, 

 which holds time-bound hearings for experts and all the 

 parties concerned and submits recommendations.

 Yechury said: OBCs count 

 for 52 per cent of the population; 27 per cent will get 

 reservation. This means one out of every two OBC students 

 will get the benefit of a seat. We want the economically 

 weaker students to get the benefit. 

 Basudev Acharia, the CPM leader 

 in the Lok Sabha, echoed him: We will put pressure 

 on the government to exclude the creamy layer. 

 The creamy layer unlike the 

 job quota, the proposed education quota does not exclude 

 the well-off is likely to be the most contested issue. 

 The UPAs southern parties 

 the DMK and the PMK do not want the creamy layer excluded. 

 But Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, law minister H.L. Bhardwaj 

 and science minister Kapil Sibal do.

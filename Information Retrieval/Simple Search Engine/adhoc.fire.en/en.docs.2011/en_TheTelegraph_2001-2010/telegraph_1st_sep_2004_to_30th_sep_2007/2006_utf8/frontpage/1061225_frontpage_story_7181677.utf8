 Hunt for Adhip car

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Bangalore, Dec. 24: Police teams have fanned out across neighbouring states to hunt for the silver-coloured Matiz containing all the clues to Calcuttan Adhip Lahiris murder.

 Adhip, a Salt Lake techie working in Bangalore for the past two years, was found dead on the roadside hours after he had driven out of office on Thursday night, killed apparently when he resisted robbers. The police say the killers had an eight-hour lead on them.

 We have sent teams to Hosur and Tirupati and alerted all the southern states to look for a silver-coloured Matiz, an officer said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Frontpage

Double delight in winning start

Keir Radnedge

Party time twice over in the so-called English Garden 

in Munich. This is like Kew Gardens transplanted from south-west London but without 

the horticultural science. Visitors enjoy the tranquillity of strolling in pleasant 

parkland with a beer garden at its centre beneath the shadow of a mock Chinese 

pagoda.

Happiness reigned beneath the pagoda on both Friday 

morning and Saturday morning. The festive freedom which always accompanies the 

eve of a World Cup was echoed in the delight and relief that the German hosts 

had kicked off their great sporting event with a victory.

Not a simple victory. Not a victory free of care, 

for all the clarity of the 4-2 final scoreline against lively but lightweight 

Costa Rica. The central Americans delightful playmaker Walter Centeno revealed, 

with his probing passes, the frightening depth of the chasm at the heart of the 

German defence.

Per Mertesacker and Christoph Metzelder may stand 

physically tall but, in footballing terms at this level, they are minnows, and 

better teams than Costa Rica should rip their defence into fragments.

Fortunately for the sake of German pride and the momentum 

of these finals, such a fate will not befall Jurgen Klinsmanns team until 

the knockout stages on the road to Berlin and July 9.

Berlins status as tournament terminus underlines 

the geographical imbalance of this World Cup. The reunification-revived capital 

hosts Fifas offices and is home, like Munich, to a major World Cup broadcasting 

hub. But Berlin is away to the east of Germany and owes its primacy ? both for 

the nation and its football ? not at all to geography but rather to the vagaries 

of history.

Instead, as the opening match proved, Munich is the 

effective capital of German football just as Manchester has been the football 

capital of England for a decade and the Milan-Turin axis runs the Italian game 

rather than Rome.

Munich hosted the finals of the 1974 World Cup and 

the 1988 European Championship as well as, most recently, the climax of the Champions 

League in 1997. But that was in the old Olympic stadium with its iconic glass 

and steel cobweb of a roof. 

Football has moved on since then to the balloon-like 

Arena built by Bayern and neighbours 1860 Munich in little more than a year; the 

Olympic stadium, with the uselessly gentle rake in its seating, its lack of cover 

and its vast athletics track is now football history.

Similarly, history is the place to which most of (West) 

Germanys winning players from 1954 and 1974 have been relegated. But relegated 

with honour. The social significance of the shock 1954 victory over Ferenc Puskass 

supposedly unbeatable superstars of Hungary is still being picked over in film 

and philosophical debate. Twenty years later, West Germany won as underdogs again, 

this time against Johan Cruyffs Holland. Another 16 years and the hat-trick 

was secured in Italy.

A surviving selection of the players strolled out 

for a parade of champions in Fridays opening ceremony, some more recognisable 

after the passing of the years than others. Paul Breitner, the 1970s Maoist, now 

wears a smart slate-grey suit, sports a matching greying beard and hosts a football 

discussion forum for fans in a local department store.

How times have changed.

Franz Beckenbauer goes on, of course, the most successful 

chameleon ? first player and captain, then subsequently coach of club and country, 

club president, federation vice-president and host-winning director of the DFB. 

He shared the opening podium with Fifa president Sepp Blatter and state president 

Horst Kohler. For reasons of diplomacy and protocol, neither Blatter nor Beckenbauer 

spoke. But that was accidentally appropriate; for the next four weeks it is the 

footballers and their football which will do the talking.

Not only the football and footballers of Germany but 

those of England, France, Argentina, Italy, and Brazil and whoever will spring 

the surprises on which the games legend depends.

If that means more statements such as the sensational 

goals of Philipp Lahm and Torsten Frings, then bring it on.

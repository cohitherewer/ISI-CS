 Last Hurrah

 The finalists are minimalists, so 

 pray for goals. Keir Radnedge reports from

 GAULS 

 VS...

 The sky had indeed looked like falling on their head, 

 till the French transformed themselves from a gang of 

 Geriatrix to an army of Asterix. Can captain Zizou wrest 

 the ultimate laurel wreath in this month named after 

 Julius Caesar? 

 VITALSTATISTIX

 For 62 years between 1920 and 1982, the French 

 never beat the Italians. Since then, it has been vice 

 versa. In World Cup games, they are split 2-2. In Euro 

 2000, the French scalped the Italians 

 ...ROMANS

 They will appropriately be led by a centurion. Fabio 

 Cannavaro picks up his 100th cap on Sunday. With three 

 defenders nominated for Best Player (Zambrotta, Buffon 

 and Cannavaro), the Italian rear looks like the fabled 

 Roman phalanx 

 JUSTFORKIX

 Watch Latina songstress Shakira and 400 performers 

 liven up pre-match festivities with a love parade. 

 No Cacofonix to gag and tie up after the match, though

 France 

 and Italy are form finalists. Scan the last four weeks of 

 the 2006 World Cup finals and seek out the finest players 

 and an all-star team would probably include a majority from 

 the two nations who duel in Berlins Olympiastadion.

 But, like the historic old venue 

 itself, something about this final sits awry.

 In the stadiums case we 

 are talking aesthetics. The grand old lines which have stood 

 the test of 80 years amid a variety of political and military 

 assaults look ill at ease beneath the steel and plastic 

 canopy which passes for the essential roof. (Also, the stadium 

 is elliptical in design, which is an insult to distantly 

 seated fans who thought they were paying significant sums 

 to be close to the action).

 Similarly, Les Bleus and the Azzurri 

 are not quite those whom we expected to find as the last 

 men standing.

 France, champions in 1998 and 

 fading in 2002, were fortunate to survive qualifying and 

 started down the group trail like a bunch of strangers all 

 in search of the fastest route home. Italy, neighbours in 

 both geography and in rickety procession to Berlin, have 

 put in only one real performance, against hosts 

 Germany in the semi-finals. These are, then, minimalists 

 ? finalists who have put a necessary economy of effort and 

 whose status as finalists is defined through an ability 

 to seize the opportunities which came their way.

 Italy benefited from a comparatively 

 easy group and the fact that Argentina, whom they feared, 

 were knocked out by Germany, whom they did not. France played 

 a fine final half hour against Spain in the second round, 

 then benefited from positive thinking and a misfiring Brazil 

 in the quarters.

 Pele, who continues to be an enthusiastic 

 spectator at the World Cup despite Brazils demise, 

 has a fascinating take on these finals. He sees them as 

 the first finals that have not been dominated by one major 

 goal-scorer and says he has been more impressed by defenders 

 and midfielders than strikers.

 That, frankly, is not good news 

 for the game in general or this concluding game in particular. 

 Fans want to see goals and, for all the spectacular nature 

 of some of the early strikes ? Rosicky, Frings, Lahm, Gerrard, 

 etc ? they have been disappointed.

 For the majority here that has 

 not mattered significantly because the German hosts progressed 

 to the semi-finals and that kept the home audience happy. 

 But if France and Italy are typical of what these finals 

 have offered, then we might ? at the extreme ? be in for 

 a repeat of 1994 when a goalless draw between Brazil and 

 Italy was decided by a penalty shootout.

 That was for the only time? so 

 far.

 Creative players will not be lacking 

 in Berlin. It has been a privilege to see Zinedine Zidane 

 enjoying a second footballing youth as he stands on the 

 brink of retirement. This final will be his last game and 

 the romantics will want a French victory so that the great 

 Zizou can go out gloriously in Roy of the Rovers style.

 Across midfield will be Italys 

 Andrea Pirlo, a superbly balanced footballer who thinks 

 the game as diligently as he works it. Pirlo possesses Zidanes 

 gift of being able to move one way ? and take a defence 

 with him ? while sending the ball in the opposite direction. 

 Italys defence being pretty rock solid, Pirlo needs 

 do that only once and the game will be over.

 France has a problem. To shore 

 up midfield the French use Arsenals Thierry Henry 

 as a lone striker and this is not his ideal working style. 

 Henry needs a support worker to help create space into which 

 he can inject his killing pace. Thus, in their six games 

 thus far, the French have scored a measly eight goals, even 

 fewer than Italys 11.

 Of course, the final could be 

 a rip-roaring game with a stream of goals at both ends. 

 Imagine Henry, Zidane, Florent Malouda and Franck Ribery 

 testing the acrobatically magnificent Gianluigi Buffon at 

 one end while Luca Toni, Pirlo and Francesco Totti bombard 

 a frighteningly unpredictable Fabien Barthez at the other.

 Do not, however, imagine it will 

 turn out like that. Respect is an overworked 

 word these days. In tune with the linguistic times, there 

 may be more respect at play in the World Cup final than 

 we need on footballs grandest occasion.

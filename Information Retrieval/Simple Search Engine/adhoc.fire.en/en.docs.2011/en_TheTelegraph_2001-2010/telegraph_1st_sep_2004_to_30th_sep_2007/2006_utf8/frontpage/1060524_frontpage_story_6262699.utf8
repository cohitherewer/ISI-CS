House and job for land

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta, May 23: Faced with an immediate 

requirement of 31,750 acres for industry over the next six months, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees 

government today announced a rehabilitation package for those who will be evicted 

in the process of land acquisition.

Commerce and industries minister Nirupam Sen and land 

and land reforms minister Abdur Rezzak Molla finalised the package and discussed 

faster acquisition of land with the district magistrates of North and South 24-Parganas, 

Hooghly, Howrah and the two Midnapores.

In neighbouring states like Orissa and Jharkhand, 

discontent among people displaced by industrial projects has caused protests and 

even violence in some cases. The success or failure of the Bhattacharjee governments 

investment drive will depend to a great extent on how it tackles the transition 

of a largely rural society to industrial communities. 

Under the package, displaced people figuring on the 

below-poverty-line list will be given housing, besides compensation. In 

rural areas, it will be on the model of Indira Awas Yojna, while in urban areas, 

cluster housing will be prepared along the lines of Valmiki Awas Yojna for those 

below the poverty line, Molla said.

The investor will be asked to offer jobs to marginal 

farmers who make their livelihood from agriculture. DMs have been asked 

to prepare a list of such farmers. We will ask industry to provide employment 

to one member from each such family according to their qualification either in 

the industry coming up or in related services, Molla said.

Land owners will be given compensation equivalent 

to 100 per cent of the value of their land plus 30 per cent, and 10 per cent of 

the land value if the evicted person undertakes not to go to court. The government 

will pay a 12 per cent interest for delayed payment of the land price.

Encroachers who have no claim on the land will be 

paid between Rs 1,000 and 10,000. 

The package, to be valid for all land acquisitions 

that take place from now on, will be ratified by the cabinet on May 31.

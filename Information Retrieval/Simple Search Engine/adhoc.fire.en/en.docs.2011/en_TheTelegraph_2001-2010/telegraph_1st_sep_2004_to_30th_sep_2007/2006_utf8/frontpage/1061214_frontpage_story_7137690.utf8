 Brick tragedy in click capital

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 A part of the building near which the scaffolding collapsed

 Bangalore, Dec. 13: A brick-and-mortar tragedy unfolded inside the glass-and-chrome empire of Infosys today, killing five labourers building a pyramid-shaped edifice for the company that literally changed the faade of corporate India. 

 The building was being constructed on Infosyss showpiece campus, Electronics City, on the outskirts of Bangalore.

 The accident occurred around 10.15 am after the workers had finished fixing huge panes for the five-storeyed glass structure shaped as a pyramid.

 The labourers were removing the scaffolding supporting the structure when it gave way. Some of the workers were standing at a height of 60 feet when the scaffolding came crashing down, crushing others standing below. Among the 13 injured, one suffered spinal injuries. 

 The dead and the injured are from Raichur, an arid district in north Karnataka and a source of migrant labour. The dead have been identified as Nagaraj, Tirupathi, Nagappa, Ramesh and Vijaykumar.

 Most of the 10,000 techies at workstations elsewhere on the campus were unaware of the accident till friends and relatives heard about it and called them on the phone. Around lunchtime, some of our colleagues told us that construction workers were crushed, an employee said.

 But some employees said they a heard a loud thump and muffled cries and saw ambulances arriving, followed by a police van.

 A case of negligence has been registered against the contractor. The building is being built by Sobha Developers, which expressed concern and said we have always ensured standard security and safety measures are followed.

 Shaped like crystal balls and pyramids, Infosys offices stress on aesthetics and are a challenge to build.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Frontpage

 CM works on Mission Smart

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, 

 April 22: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has established 

 himself as a leader working to revive industry in Bengal. 

 Under him the states image, too, is on the mend. If 

 the Left Front gets another term in office, he plans to 

 pick a cabinet that is equipped to carry the effort forward.

 Bhattacharjees next cabinet is expected to be youthful, aggressive and tuned to modern trends so that when opportunities arise, it is able to spot and exploit them.

 Those of you who have read into the list of our candidates will be able to perceive a statement of our intent, the chief minister told The Telegraph in an interview.

 Whether Bhattacharjee says it in so many words or not, in the outgoing ministry there are less than a handful of people with the skills to promote Bengal nationally ? not to speak of globally ? against aggressive competitors from some of the other states which have been doing this far longer.

 Its a problem that has emerged in a survey of Bengal industry done by the Indian Chamber of Commerce where businessmen have expressed unhappiness with the promotional effort. They have also said that one Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee is not enough to bring about change.

 In his Jadavpur constituency, the Congress and Mamata Banerjees Trinamul have begun to attack the chief minister, describing him as swapner pheriwala (dream merchant).

 If returned to power for another five years, and I think we will come back with a comfortable margin, we will have ministers who are young, capable of conjuring up a picture of a forward-looking Bengal and engaging the attention of the country, Bhattacharjee has said.

 This should mean ministers who can communicate with ease in English and Hindi, understand the working of market forces and, above all, be informed and sharp enough to identify and tap national and international forums where Bengal can be promoted.

 Earlier there were instances where we could not showcase Bengal before discriminating national and international audiences because of the inability of the ministers concerned to respond to opportunities, Bhattacharjee said.

 He mentioned the events that other states used to successfully promote themselves but Bengal could not because the ministers were not up to it. 

 We dont want a repeat of such failures. I would like to address this problem, inherent in some of our ministers. We are short on communication and presentation skills.

 The new ministers will have to be agile, responsive and business-savvy. 

 Bhattacharjees planned Mission Smart is the natural corollary to Mission Green the CPM and its allies launched to infuse fresh blood into the organisation. The Left Front has dropped over 70 sitting legislators, including senior ministers, and fielded new faces, many of whom are professionals ? engineers, teachers and IT experts.

 Education is one area where a 

 new team will take charge since all five members of the 

 outgoing ministry have been denied nomination. There are 

 no obvious indications like this for other ministries but 

 the intention is on record.

 wanted, an education minister

 Since education has been one of 

 his main problem areas, the search for his new higher education 

 minister could be both a challenge and an opportunity for 

 the chief minister. He would like to have someone who is 

 familiar with the real issues of higher education and has 

 the right credentials and administrative abilities. 

 Among his current colleagues, 

 none perhaps fits the bill better than Asim Dasgupta, the 

 Left Front governments one and only finance minister 

 for nearly two decades. Not that the chief minister would 

 commit himself either way at this stage.

 Shifting Dasgupta to education 

 could also mean a new beginning for finance. 

 Asked whether the blame for the states messy finances 

 lies primarily with the minister, the chief minister smiled 

 but avoided a straight answer. Wait and see what 

 happens was all he would say at this stage.

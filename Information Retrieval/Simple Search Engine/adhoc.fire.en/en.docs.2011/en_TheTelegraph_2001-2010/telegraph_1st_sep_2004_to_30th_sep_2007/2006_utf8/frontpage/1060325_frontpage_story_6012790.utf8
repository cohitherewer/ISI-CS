 Rail robbers kill boy

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta, March 24: A 12-year-old schoolboy returning home in a local train today died after a bullet fired by a gang of runaway robbers got him in the temple.

 Somnath Majumdar, a Class VI student, was going home with his mother on the Diamond Harbour-Sealdah local after an exam when the freak bullet hit him. He died on the way to hospital.

 The incident happened this afternoon as the packed train was rolling into Kalyanpur station in South 24-Parganas, about 25 km from here.

 As the train slowed down, the robbers who had snatched a bag of money from a businessman at gunpoint jumped off. The passengers raised a ruckus, egging on a mob to give them chase. The robbers then wildly pumped bullets, one of which hit Somnath who was in the train.

 Somnath was a student of Ramakrishna Mission School at Sarisha. He stayed with his parents in the Subhasgram area of Sonarpur, on the citys southern fringes.

 Another passenger, Haran Mondal of Mograhat, was hit in the shoulder, police said.

 Preliminary investigations suggested the robbers had boarded the train from Uttar Radhanagar station, before Kalyanpur. At 3.05 pm, in between the two stations, they took out guns and snatched the businessmans bag.

 The businessman raised an alarm and as the train was rolling into Kalyanpur, the criminals jumped off the compartment on to the platform.

 A mob gave hot chase and, in a bid to scare them away, the criminals fired. A bullet hit the boy in the right temple, Nabarun Bhattacharya, superintendent of railway police, Sealdah, said.

 Eastern Railway officials said the train guard had heard the gunshots and sent a wireless message to Baruipur station, where the train reached three minutes later.

 Somnath was rushed to Baruipur rural hospital. But he died on the way, a hospital official said.

 Somnaths father Sanjay Majumdar works for a private firm. Mother Snigdha is a housewife. They used to live in Beadon Street and moved to Subhasgram a few years ago.

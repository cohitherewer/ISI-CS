 Survey of bypass buildings

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, May 23: Abdur Rezzak Molla, the land and land reforms minister, will launch a full-fledged offensive on unauthorised projects on the bypass.

 I have asked for a survey of the area on both sides of the EM Bypass between Science City and Garia. We want to determine how much the character of land has changed from what was listed in our records. I will get a report in three months, he said. 

 If we find a building where the land records show the existence of a waterbody, well find out if permission for changing the character of land was sought. If it wasnt, well initiate action. This could range from giving post facto approval to even demolition. 

 Under law, conversion of land without the district collectors authorisation is a non-bailable offence punishable with up to three years imprisonment or a fine of Rs 50,000.

 Molla has turned the scanner on an area that has seen rapid urbanisation over the past five years. As he himself said: This is prime land now ? prices around Ruby Hospital are Rs 8 lakh per cottah.

 Much of the 16 mouzas under the scanner belong to the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority, fisheries or the refugee rehabilitation department. 

 Molla has called a meeting tomorrow to finalise the modalities of the survey.

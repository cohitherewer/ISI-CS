 Six-month market low

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, June 13: Global markets, sliding in fear of high interest rates in the US, and the absence of buying support combined today to drive the sensex to its lowest close in six months. 

 The benchmark BSE index ended with a loss of 414 points at 9062.65 after plunging below the psychological level of 9000 to 8993.58 for the first time since December 9, 2005. 

 Brokers said selling by mutual funds and high net-worth individuals, coupled with the negative sentiment arising from weak global cues, has been pulling the market down.

 Dhoom 2 message: be cool, stay alive

 Bipashas message to Dhoom: 2 viewers

 Mumbai, Dec. 11: Action flick Dhoom: 2 may be peppered with motorbike stunts, but from this week it will be flashing a warning in theatres across the country: ride and drive safely.

 It all began with Mumbai polices brainwave to use the film to check the epidemic of rash driving and hit-and-runs. Producer Yash Chopra immediately agreed, the police said.

 The message will be aired by the films stars, Abhishek Bachchan and Bipasha Basu, in slides to be shown twice at every screening during the interval and at the end.

 Abhishek will say: Youre not cool if you are riding at 120 kmph. Youre just dead. Be cool. Stay Alive.

 Bipasha will tell female audiences: If your boyfriends bike is going at 100 kmph, hes taking you for a ride. Be cool. Stay Alive.

 We had requested Yash Chopra to show (such) slides at a few Mumbai cinemas but he said, Why not the whole country? deputy commissioner (traffic) Arun Baijal said.

 Chopra could not be contacted for comment.

 Mumbai has seen at least four hit-and-runs in the past month, with a drunken 21-year-old, Alistair Pereira, making headlines by crushing to death seven labourers sleeping on a Bandra pavement.

 Instances of youngsters imitating Dhoom: 2 stunts, too, have been reported. Two Class XII students died in a motorbike crash on the Worli sea face last night, with initial reports saying they had been trying a Dhoom: 2 stunt. The police clarified they were just speeding and lost control.

 The films warning comes just in time. New Years Eve invariably witnesses a spurt in drunk driving and accidents.

 The slides have been designed by Pradeep Yeragi and Anupama Kulkarni of Everest Communications.

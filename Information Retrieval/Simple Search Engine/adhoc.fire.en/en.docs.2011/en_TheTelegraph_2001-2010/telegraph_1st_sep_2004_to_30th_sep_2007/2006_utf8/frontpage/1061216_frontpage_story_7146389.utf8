 Rebels claim minister link

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Imphal, Dec. 15: Manipur rural development minister Md Allauddin has been linked to a militant outfit by some of its members who were arrested yesterday. The minister has refuted the charges. 

 Police yesterday seized a vehicle in which six activists of the Peoples United Liberation Front (PULF), one of the several militant groups in Manipur, were travelling. 

 The six rebels were arrested. The rebels were carrying 20 woollen blankets and some other items. The goods were being transported to one of the camps of the outfit in Ch-andel district, the police said. 

 One of the six PULF activists who were arrested by the police from Waithou in the district alleged that the blankets were sourced from the private residence of the minister, located at Kiyamgei in Keirao Assembly constituency of Imphal East district. 

 One of the arrested militants, Habibur Rahman, told the police that the blankets were lifted from the ministers private residence at 7.30 am yesterday. He also told interrogators that the materials were being taken to a house at Sora in Chandel district where a PULF leader was taking shelter. 

 Thoubal superintendent of police S. Ibocha Singh said they had received information that a Tata vehicle was ferrying materials for militants from Imphal to Thoubal along the Imphal-Moreh road. A police team deployed at Waithou seized the vehicle, he said. 

 Allauddin, who is also the minister for science and technology, strongly denied the allegations, saying the charges were politically motivated and baseless. 

 As all my three sons are studying outside and the other family members are staying with me in Imphal, no one is living at the house. So there is no way that the seized materials could have originated from my house, the minister said. 

 Quoting witnesses, Allauddin said some activists of the PULF brought the blankets in a rickshaw near the gate of his private residence yesterday. He said the blankets and other materials were taken away in a Tata vehicle. All this happened outside the premises of my house, he said.

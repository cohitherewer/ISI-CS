 Singh battles rollback blaze 

PM rules out shift, party still hopeful 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 7: The 

 Prime Minister is believed to have made it clear there would 

 be no rollback of the prices of petrol and diesel, but the 

 Congress is nursing hopes of a review sometime later.

 There will be no rollback; we will have to face it, Manmohan Singh is learnt to have told petroleum minister Murli Deora when they met this afternoon.

 After such an unequivocal assertion attributed to the Prime Minister began doing the rounds, the Congress found it difficult to raise the pitch in public, though the party stood by the demand for a partial rollback.

 But the political damage inflicted by the controversy for the first time, the party leadership and the government appeared to be working at cross-purposes in public left most Congress leaders flummoxed.

 Sources claimed that Deora, after a meeting with Sonia Gandhi yesterday, had told a senior functionary that the price of petrol would be brought down but it may take time.

 They wondered if the minister had jumped the gun when he gave the assurance, and if he had said it seriously or just to please Sonia.

 Deoras statements he had suggested that the high commands wishes were final gave the impression that Prime Minister is not being allowed the elbow-room to enforce a decision taken by the cabinet.

 Sources close to the Prime Minister confirmed his opposition to a rollback and underscored three points.

 One, the decision was taken after months of discussions at all levels, including some with Sonia and her political aides. Two, the hike was based on sound economics. Three, if the Prime Minister was forced to retreat so soon, it will undermine his authority.

 The party also realised that a perception was growing that under the division of labour between Manmohan and Sonia, unpopular decisions were being attributed to the Prime Minister and the credit for any reconsideration is being given to the party leadership.

 Sources said that at the Prime Ministers recent meetings with Sonia, she was told the price hikes were overdue and that the government had made a major concession to the aam-aadmi by sparing kerosene and cooking gas. Apparently, Sonia did not make an intervention.

 The best scenario for the Congress 

 will be a marginal rollback after a decent interval 

 to avoid letting it appear as though the Prime Minister 

 was caving in to pressure from the party and 

 the Left.

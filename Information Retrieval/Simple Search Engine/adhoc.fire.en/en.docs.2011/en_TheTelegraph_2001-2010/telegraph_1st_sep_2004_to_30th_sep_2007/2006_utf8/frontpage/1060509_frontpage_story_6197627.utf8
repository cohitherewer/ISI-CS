 A piece of 

 paradise for beat amp; bite

 Tongue Twister 

 Sands, Sega dancers, mixed music sounds and exotic food... 

 Musician and foodie NONDON BAGCHI relives 

 his recent trip to Mauritius

 In 1998, if I remember correctly, 

 The Atrium Cafe at The Park hosted a Mauritian food festival. 

 Food and music and dance, really, because along with the 

 chefs came a troupe of Sega dancers and their accompanying 

 musicians ? colourful, vibrant, exuding a sense of fun and 

 abandon and celebrating life. 

 The food had a distinct character 

 to it. Salads rich with tropical fruits, seafood preparations 

 with a Mediterranean approach and meat and vegetable curries 

 with an Indian touch.

 It was the first time I had Smoked 

 Marlin (a kind of sword fish). Thin slices of pink flesh, 

 just like ham slices to look at, and even to taste, though 

 more subtle and very succulent. The festival gave us a glimpse 

 of a rich and varied culture and somewhere a mental note 

 was made that this must be a happening destination.

 Eight years later and one-and-a-half 

 levels below, guests of the hotel from a large corporate 

 company visit Someplace Else, hear the music of Hip Pocket, 

 and like it enough to invite the band to play at their annual 

 conference in Mauritius.

 The flight lands at 11.30 am local 

 time, this small jewel in the Indian Ocean ringed by white 

 sands and surrounded by turquoise-blue seas, the island 

 itself covered by the lush green colours of the tropics 

 interspersed by jagged ridges of ancient volcanic rock.

 We board a bus to get to the hotel; 

 soon there is a brief halt, our guide announces that three 

 beautiful young ladies are going to welcome all of us (conference 

 delegates and band) to Mauritius.

 ?Just a welcome, okay?? he jokes, 

 as three lissome lasses board the bus with garlands, laughter 

 bubbling through their welcome, confident and comfortable 

 with their beauty, unselfconscious, and just as quickly 

 disappear into their car with ?Bye!? and ?Enjoy your stay?. 

 Our guide tells us that Mauritius 

 was colonised first by the Dutch, then the French and then 

 the British. Seventy per cent of the population is of Indian 

 origin (this emigration happened during British rule), the 

 other main ethnic groups being African and European.

 The official language is English, 

 though most people speak French, or rather Creole, the local 

 adaptation. Creole is also a term used to identify the ethnic 

 group whose roots belong in Africa.

 Bhojpuri, Urdu and Hindi are also 

 spoken and there is a small group of Chinese islanders as 

 well. 

 There are Hindus, Muslims, Roman 

 Catholics and other Christians; the cuisine is a reflection 

 of this amazing melting point, out of which will come biryanis 

 and curries, Peking duck and sweet and sour pork, bacon 

 and eggs, French dishes including venison and wild boar, 

 Creole ragouilles and exotic tropical fruits. We are beginning 

 to get the picture? 

 At the hotel we are welcomed by 

 Sega dancers, going for it oblivious of their five-star 

 surroundings. A simple, hypnotic, rhythm sustained by two 

 Ravanes (large, thin drums with goatskin heads, but now 

 replaced by synthetic skins) held vertically and played 

 like tamburines, one Maravine (a pebble-filled box which 

 makes a rattling sound when shaken) and a triangle. Lusty 

 singing, celebration time. 

 Lunch is a huge buffet. I try 

 to identify things Mauritian (Creole, or local adaptations 

 of French cuisine) and try first salads involving avocados, 

 and another with pineapples, papaya and grapes with hunks 

 of bread and garlic butter.

 There is some Grilled Red Tuna 

 Steak. At first glance they could be chicken or turkey laid 

 out over the charcoals, but they are delicious tuna fish 

 steaks, charred in places to give it that right barbecued 

 feel. A choice of many accompaniments, be they sauces or 

 greens.

 ?Any Marlin?? I ask the chef. 

 ?No,? he says, ?but I promise you some at dinner.? True 

 to his word, at dinner on the silver sands under the bejewelled 

 skies, there is Smoked Marlin, after eight long years? There 

 is a Couscous, a North African cereal, Stir Fried Beef, 

 Lebanese Kebab and much more. Plenty of Indian and tandoori 

 as well, but that can wait till we are back home. 

 Next day I ask the guest relations 

 lady to recommend a good restaurant for Creole food. She 

 says, ?Le Capitaine, at Grand Bay?. This is a small town 

 at the edge of a bay, pretty boats anchored in calm waters, 

 Le Capitaine looking out over them. 

 I order Octopus Salad. The octopus 

 is cooked in salt water and allowed to cool after being 

 drained. It is then cut into bite-sized pieces. A dressing 

 with lemon juice, olive oil, salt and pepper is made and 

 the octopus, chopped chillies, onions and bell peppers are 

 added. The salad is served with Crushed Chillies (a fiery 

 sauce made with their local, pale green chillies about twice 

 the size of jalapeno) and bread with garlic butter. Octopus 

 is not as rubbery as squid and to my mind has more character 

 in its taste.

 Next up is Beef with Creole Sauce. 

 The meat is marinated with salt and pepper and kept aside. 

 In a wok, crushed garlic, chopped ginger and onions are 

 sauteed in oil and then a generous amount of tomatoes and 

 red chillies are added. The dish is covered while the contents 

 simmer. Then the meat is added, with hot water and the dish 

 cooks till the meat is tender. 

 Accompaniments were a dry shrimp 

 preparation like a Balichow, a salad with juliennes of cabbage 

 and palm heart and a pulao with raisins and peanuts. This 

 hit the spot. 

 No time for dessert. I was getting 

 late for sound check. (almost forgot why I was in Mauritius!). 

 Performance and party in the evening and out next day at 

 the crack of dawn. Back home many hours later, I find Le 

 Capitaine Restaurant on the net and recipes of the food 

 I ate. 

 For a foodie and musician, Mauritius 

 is paradise. In every corner and outlet of the hotel there 

 was live music and you could hear anything from local sounds 

 to Charlie Parker to Sade to Stevie Wonder. If I have sounded 

 like a tourist brochure, at least I am in good company, 

 for after a sojourn in Mauritius, Mark Twain is supposed 

 to have said, ?God made Mauritius first, and then the heavens?.

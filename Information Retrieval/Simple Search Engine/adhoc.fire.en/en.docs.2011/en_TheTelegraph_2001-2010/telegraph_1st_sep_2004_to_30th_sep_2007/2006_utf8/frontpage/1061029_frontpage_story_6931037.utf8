 Hobbled, Yuvi told to hotfoot it to Mumbai

 - Felled by kho-kho, batsman to miss crucial match against Australia today

 Chandigarh, Oct. 28: 

 The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is so obsessed 

 with making millions that it has turned pretty insensitive 

 towards the ones responsible for filling its coffers the 

 players, big and small. 

 In what must rank as a poor administrative decision, it has asked key middle-order batsman Yuvraj Singh, who twisted his left knee during this mornings warm-up session (actually, in a game of kho-kho in neighbouring Mohali), to head to Mumbai and seek orthopaedic Dr Anant Joshis opinion.

 The BCCI should have arranged to rush Dr Joshi here instead of asking a hobbling Yuvraj to undertake whats bound to be a painful journey. Apparently, the experts commitments are heavy, but he ought to have been persuaded. Or, an option explored. 

 Chandigarh da puttar Yuvraj, of course, declined to comment on being made to travel with a knee brace. 

 He leaves tomorrow afternoon. 

 However, talking about the injury and the possibility of being out of action for four-six weeks, he told The Telegraph: Its just bad luck.... What else can I say? I dont even know whether surgery will be required.... Thats going to be clear after Dr Joshi has seen the knee.... Abhi kya pata....

 A nominee for the International Cricket Councils ODI Player of the Year award, Yuvraj isnt only out of the Champions Trophy, but is expected to miss the five-match ODI series in South Africa, beginning November 19. 

 Its to be seen whether he will be fit for the three Tests. 

 The squad for the ODIs is to be picked here on Monday. 

 Ajit Agarkar, who fractured his left thumb in Motera Thursday, is also expected to be out of the ODIs in South Africa. While he has been replaced in the Champions Trophy 14 by Sreesanth, a decision on Yuvraj is going to be taken after tomorrows virtual quarter final against world champions Australia.

 If the Indians lose, a replacement wont be necessary. I cant say anything now, remarked a somewhat hassled chief selector, Dilip Vengsarkar. 

 According to media manager Rajan Nair, the MRI done immediately after Yuvrajs injury suggests a tear of the cruciate ligament and some bony bruises. This freak happening couldnt have come at a worse time.

 Old D loves New D 

 - Bachchan rewinds after seeing remake

 PRATIM D. GUPTA

 Bachchan, Shah Rukh

 Calcutta, Oct. 18: What 

 happens when yesterdays Don sees todays Don 

 in action? He goes into flashback mode to a time when he 

 was all of 32 and fighting through his flops.

 Before the official release of 

 the much-awaited Farhan Akhtar film on Friday, Amitabh Bachchan 

 was treated to a special screening of the remake starring 

 Shah Rukh Khan. He loved the new film and he loved 

 the way it has been made, Farhan told The Telegraph 

 over phone from Mumbai.

 But unlike others present at the screening reportedly held at the Yash Raj Studios in Andheri last evening Bachchan went on a nostalgic trip as he watched the new images roll. 

 Of all the people who will ever watch the movie, he will probably have the most different experience watching the film, said Farhan. Because the original film is him. It is a role that has been made legendary by him. He was extremely nostalgic after he saw the film.

 During the interval, Bachchan described to Farhan the first day of the shooting in July 1974 at Mehboob Studios. He was suddenly reminded of the Yeh mera dil song that he shot with Helenji.

 Chandra Barot, director of the 1978 Don, said: We started shooting for the film with that song.

 I remember Salim-Javed seeing the rushes of the song and calling me to compliment me on the international look of the film. Everything Bachchan was wearing for that song was bought from London where we had all gone before the first schedule of the film. It was considered high fashion at that time. And Helen was 40. But the way she danced.

 At 26, Kareena attempts a peppier version of the Kalyanji Anandji song in the new Don, freshly set to tune by Shankar Ehsaan Loy. The actress, who also got to see the Diwali release early, cant stop talking about the film. 

 I knew I can never dance 

 like Helenji, she said, but I did it in my way 

 and the new Yeh mera dil has turned out to be my 

 own little tribute to her. 

 Not just Bachchan, whoever has seen the special previews is going gaga over the remake. 

 Javed Akhtar, who is the only common link between the two Dons, having written the script for the first and the lyrics for the second, loved the fresh take, too. He might have a biased view as my father but he was very excited about the twists and turns that have been put in the plot, Farhan said.

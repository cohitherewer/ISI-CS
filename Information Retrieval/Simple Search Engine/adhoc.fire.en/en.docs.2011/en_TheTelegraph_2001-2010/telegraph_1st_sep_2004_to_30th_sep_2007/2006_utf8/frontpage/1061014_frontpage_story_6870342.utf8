 Barak downs Kalams missile

 - Trishul dumped after 22 years and $70m in cost

 New Delhi, Oct. 13: Israels Barak also bites. It has shot down President A.P.J. Abdul Kalams pet missile: his Trishul programme will be scrapped in December.

 After dropping the Trishul programme, the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) has been asked to get more active in the co-development of the Barak NG (next generation or Barak II) project that was signed this January. The DRDO has been roped in as a joint venture partner in the project. The development would focus mostly on extending the range of the Barak to 60 km.

 The navy has virtually told the government that the Trishul can be junked after 22 years, nearly 50 trials and an estimated $70-million expenditure. And that it is happy with the Barak, happy enough to place more orders. As far as the navy is concerned, this should put the lid on any controversy over the Baraks quality.

 The Barak (lightning in Hebrew) and the Trishul (trident in Sanskrit) are missiles of the same category, designed for a ships self-defence.

 Our experience with the Barak missile has been good. We are happy with it, the chief of naval staff, Admiral Arun Prakash, said here today.

 Doubts about the Baraks capabilities were voiced after the CBI this week alleged that George Fernandes, Jaya Jaitly, R.K. Jain and Admiral (retired) Sushil Kumar were recipients of kickbacks through middleman Suresh Nanda who brokered the October 2000 deal to buy seven Barak systems.

 The shooting down of the Trishul by the Barak is a blow to the DRDO. 

 The CBIs case has rested on Kalams objection in 1999 to the induction of the Barak because the Trishul was said to be on course.

 For the armed forces, the experience with the Trishul programme goes much beyond the debate over the Baraks capabilities. Even within the defence establishment the DRDO is being called upon to justify its long-gestation projects. 

 The Indian Air Force, for example, would not have to budget some $10 billion to buy 126 multi-role combat aircraft if the DRDOs light combat aircraft (LCA) project were on schedule.

 Like the Barak, the Trishul is the naval version of a surface-to-air missile (SAM) project (the land and air variants are the Akash and the Nag) that was begun in 1984. The Trishul project was begun on the insistence of the Navy. Its urgency came out of Pakistans acquisition of Exocet and Harpoon missiles.

 Two years before that, in 1982, the Argentines had fired an Exocet missile that gored into the control room of the British Royal Navys HMS Sheffield in the Falklands war killing an unspecified number of the frigates 268-member crew.

 Like the Barak, the Trishul is also designed for ship protection and it should have been able to shoot down an enemy missile up to a range of 9 km. The Navy has never been satisfied with the Trishuls guidance and propulsion systems.

 Two years ago, the DRDO was asked to move the Trishul from the list of active programmes for the user the Navy to a category for academic exercises. It was designated a technology demonstrator. The Navy does not want the demonstrations any longer.

 The Trishul programme was launched in 1984 as part of Kalams integrated guided missile development programme.

 Drive against another bomb

 - Raids spread disquiet, clerics call for calm 

 SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI AND ANANYA SENGUPTA

 Mumbai, July 15: Muslim 

 clerics in Mumbai are trying hard to ensure the investigation 

 does not do what the blasts could not: create a communal 

 divide.

 As police hunt for Students 

 Islamic Movement of India (Simi) contacts and round up hundreds, 

 nearly all from the minority community, it is a tough challenge 

 they face.

 Why do we have to suffer 

 each time things like this happen? asked Sabina, a 

 resident of Nayanagar slum in Mahim, after a police swoop. 

 The raid began at 6.30 am and 

 ended at 10.30 am, with over 300 people detained, of whom 

 all but seven were let off. Even those seven were held for 

 past offences.

 The rest have been let off 

 but not without generating a feeling of harassment and humiliation 

 which innocents go through on being rounded up by police, 

 said Suraiyya Khatun, a social activist.

 On Tuesday, after the blast at 

 Mahim station, residents had rushed to help the injured 

 and the stranded. 

 Today, Nayanagar residents said 

 the policemen barged into homes and dragged out the men 

 and they believe the reason is that most of them are Muslims. 

 Why Nayanagar and not the other shanties? asked 

 Kalu, a Bengali-speaking labourer.

 But clerics said this was a pill 

 that had to be swallowed to get to the militants.

 We know most of the combing 

 operations are being carried out in Jogeshwari, Malvani, 

 Padga, Cheetah Camp in the suburbs and Mahim, Bhendi Bazar 

 in town, where many Muslims live. But we are asking our 

 brothers not to get provoked. The police have a job to do. 

 We hope they too will be a little restrained, said 

 Maulana Abdul Jabbar Azmi of a mosque in Byculla. 

 Retired IPS officer Y.P. Singh 

 said police are sometimes high-handed during searches.

 Senior inspector Joe Gaekwad insisted 

 they have been careful. There are Hindus and Christians 

 along with Muslims among the detained.

 At a meeting of 150 city mosques, 

 the All India Ulema Council, led by Maulana Athar Ali, directed 

 clerics not to issue sermons that could incite people. The 

 need of the hour is peace and brotherhood. Quran says killing 

 an innocent is akin to the massacre of humanity. Imams can 

 play a big role in spreading this message? through daily 

 prayers. 

 Yesterday, a special Friday prayer 

 was organised in 150 mosques for the blast injured.

 But the Samajwadi Partys 

 Abu Azmi fanned the anger: Muslims are made to feel 

 as if all of them are terrorists. I would like to tell the 

 government if 20 lakh Muslims pour onto the streets, it 

 will be very difficult to control the situation.

 His was a lone voice.

 Popular Urdu writer Salam Razzak 

 said: Mumbai has seen enough riots. It does no one 

 any good. There is a general feeling tensions should not 

 be made to rise at any cost.

 But as 600 policemen rounded up 

 1,000 people in the state and then let many off, there was 

 no denying the unease in the community at being put under 

 the scanner, again. 

 CUSHIONS

 Police veterans suggest the 

 following measures to make combing operations less offensive: 

 Checking should be random. Dont limit it to particular 

 groups or communities

 Raid homes only if you have specific information

 Sensitise people to the indispensability of raids after 

 blasts

 Make people aware of the difference between detention 

 and formal arrest

 Inform relatives how they can get the whereabouts of 

 the detained suspects

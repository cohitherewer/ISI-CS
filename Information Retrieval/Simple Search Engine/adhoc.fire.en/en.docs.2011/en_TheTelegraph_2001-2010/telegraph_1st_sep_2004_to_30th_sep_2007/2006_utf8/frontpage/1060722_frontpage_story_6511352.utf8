 Sourav dumps Dalmiya in battle

 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Calcutta, July 21: For 

 one known to speak straight, in the dressing room and outside, 

 Sourav Ganguly chose to rip apart one-time mentor Jagmohan 

 Dalmiya in an oblique manner.

 That, too, via an email nine days before the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) elections, where Dalmiya is up against police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee.

 Mukherjee has been hand-picked by chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, whose dislike for Dalmiya isnt a state secret.

 In fact, Bhattacharjee publicly declared he didnt want Dalmiyas innings at the Dr B.C. Roy Club House, where the CAB is headquartered, to continue.

 With issues not getting resolved, as Dalmiya put it, he filed his nomination this afternoon. Exactly 33 days after the I-want-Dalmiya-out call.

 That the former International Cricket Council, Asian Cricket Council and Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) president would fight was reported by The Telegraph on July 2. 

 While Souravs email has indirectly endorsed Mukherjees candidature, many also see it as a move to appease BCCI president Sharad Pawar, whose regime has been gunning for Dalmiya. 

 One argument is that pleasing Pawar may facilitate Souravs comeback. However, that can only be on the strength of solid performances ? excellent example being Dinesh Mongia, who has just made a return after 15 months.

 Sourav, who hasnt played for India after the Karachi Test in February, is struggling even in England where hes turning out for Northamptonshire.

 So, its debatable whether the email helps. Yet, theres little doubt many will now see Sourav as being ungrateful.

 Among other instances, its not entirely unknown that Dalmiya (being the BCCI secretary) played a role in Souravs recall No. 1 ? after over four years ? for the 1996 tour of England.

 V.V.S. Laxman lost out.

 Today, Dalmiya merely said: Im no longer in power in the BCCI?. Since I have nothing to give, I no longer expect loyalty.

 The email, of course, came more than a month after the Dalmiya-baiters promised Sourav would soon give his views. Mukherjee himself made it public. 

 The email wasnt anywhere as lengthy as coach Greg Chappells Sourav-damning communication to the BCCI brass, leaked last September, but didnt lack explosiveness.

 Hinting at Dalmiya, most influential till eight-nine months ago, Sourav clobbered him for playing with his career. 

 While Mukherjee said the email had been sent to elder brother Snehashish, it is addressed to a business associate. Unless the elder Ganguly has an ID which doesnt bear his name. 

 Eyebrows have been raised at the language (heavy punished and left scot free), for Sourav is very pucca with his English, but Mukherjee wouldnt have done the honours if it hadnt come from Northampton.

 Sourav, who received stitches after being hit in the Northants vs Pakistan match, couldnt be reached for a comment till late tonight.

 With both candidates having filed nominations and their respective panels as good as finalised (one Nemai Charan Dutta figuring in both), the focus is on votes.

 Former BCCI and CAB president B.N. Dutt has emerged a key player. 

 Dalmiya, it appears, is strong on numbers in the 121-member electorate. Not that Mukherjee isnt working overtime ? in Lalbazar and beyond.

 Jailed son of cop vanishes on parole

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, Dec. 18: The son of a senior IPS officer of Orissa, now serving a seven-year sentence in an Alwar jail for raping a German tourist earlier this year, has reportedly jumped parole by two weeks.

 On November 20, MBA student Bitihotra Mohanti was allowed to go on parole after his IPS father Bidya Bhushan Mohanti deposited a surety of Rs 50,000. He was allowed to go but told to report at a police station in Jaipur every alternate day. However, Bitihotra has failed to turn up for the last two weeks.

 On April 12 this year, Bitihotra was sentenced to seven years rigorous imprisonment less than a month after he raped a German tourist. The student was found guilty of raping the 26-year-old woman at a hotel in Alwar (Rajasthan), some 200 km from New Delhi, after dinner on March 20.

 Foxed by the youths disappearance, the Rajasthan prison authorities have requested the Orissa police to trace Bitihotra.

 Orissa director-general of police Amarananda Pattanayak told reporters that the Jaipur jail superintendent has requested the police chief of Cuttack the hometown of Bitihotra to find out the whereabouts of the young man. 

 The youth was released on parole on November 20 and he was supposed to report back on December 4. But he has not turned up yet, Pattanayak said.

 But the DGP said the Orissa police have no information about the youth. 

 Besides, we cant act without any court order as he is a convict, he said.

 The missing youths father, who is the director-general of the state home guards, also said he had no idea where his son was. 

 The information which I got through one of his friends, who has also come out on parole, is that he is in a deep state of mental shock as he had spent eight months in prison with hardened criminals. 

 He was subjected to inhuman and cruel treatment and even forced to take drugs against his will, the senior Mohanti claimed after meeting home secretary T.K. Mishra today.

 Mohanti said he is getting worried about his sons life as he has had no contact with him since he was released on parole. 

 I dont know if he is alive or hes dead. I am told he has gone insane and he is capable of doing anything. He has no control over himself, the senior officer said.

 Gurgaon, Dec. 13: When the country would have wanted him to flay the Pollocks and Ntinis, Yuvraj Singh today made headlines by allegedly beating up a namesake and fellow cricketer in a drunken brawl at his birthday party.

 The widely telecast controversy, which sucked in the Team India stars actress friend Kim Sharma and featured a mystery foreign woman, was later settled amicably in the office of the Gurgaon deputy police chief.

 Yuvraj, out of the South Africa tour thanks to a knee injury, was accused of attacking 21-year-old Yuvraj Siddharth Mahajan, who plays Ranji Trophy for Haryana and had turned up at last nights party invited by a common friend.

 Siddharths mother Neelam said she received an SOS from her son over the mobile in the small hours today and drove from Delhi to the Gurgaon house, belonging to Yuvrajs mother Shabnam Singh.

 She told the police and media that Yuvraj grabbed her hand, and Shabnam and Kim abused her in filthy language, while all three beat up Siddharth with another three or four persons.

 Versions of the fight differ but all mention Siddharths lady companion, believed to be a foreigner, as the trigger.

 Siddharth told officers the girl had complained of sexual harassment by another guest, whom he identified only as Sodhi.

 My car wouldnt start, so I asked Sodhi to take her home. But she refused to accompany him. Sodhi became enraged when I told him she wouldnt go with him, he said.

 As they quarrelled, Yuvraj allegedly butted in and attacked Siddharth.

 But sources close to Yuvrajs family said Siddharth brought along by Sukhvinder Singh, an Indian Airlines cricketer had got drunk in no time. His lady companion got irritated and asked Yuvrajs friends if they could help her get home. They called a taxi for her.

 When Siddharth learnt his girl had been sent home, he flew into a rage, abusing people and throwing punches, a source said.

 Part of the fracas was recorded in a cellphone that Shabnam was able to produce. A voice, purportedly Neelams, can be heard yelling and threatening people. Other voices, apparently of Yuvrajs friends and family, appear placatory.

 Shabnam told reporters the matter had been settled but Neelam said she might yet complain against Yuvraj to the Indian cricket board.

 Three months before the World Cup, where Yuvraj is expected to be a key player, the board mightnt be too interested. It would be happy to learn that both players, taken to hospital by the police for a check-up, have suffered only minor bruises.

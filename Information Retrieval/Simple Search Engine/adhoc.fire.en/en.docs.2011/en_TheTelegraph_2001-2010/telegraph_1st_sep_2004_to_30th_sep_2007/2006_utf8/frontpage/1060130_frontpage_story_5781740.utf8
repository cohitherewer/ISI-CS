 Question for Left

 After raising a storm in Delhi and Washington by linking the fate of the Indo-US nuclear deal to Indias vote in the Iran crisis, American ambassador David C. Mulford (in picture) has stepped on Left toes.

 Parts of the interview he gave to PTI last week, virtually issuing an ultimatum to India to vote against Iran and refer it to the UN Security Council, released on Sunday quote him as asking the Left why it opposes foreign investment in retail.

Why does Left oppose it? Are they opposed to 

farmers and business guys and others getting credit developing their livelihoods 

and their businesses? I dont understand what their opposition is about because 

the beneficiaries are the regular working people of India.

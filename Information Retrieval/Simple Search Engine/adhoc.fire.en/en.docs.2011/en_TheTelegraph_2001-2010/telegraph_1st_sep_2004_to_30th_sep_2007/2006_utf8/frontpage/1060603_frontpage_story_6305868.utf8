 Result reverse

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, June 2: For the first time in over a decade, the pass percentage in the Madhyamik examination fell more than 5.5 per cent from the previous years level.

 Last year, it was 70.51 per cent compared to this years 64.95 per cent. 

 We will soon convene a meeting with our board officials to look into the reasons behind the sharp fall in this years success rate, said Ujjwal Basu, president of the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education.

 Several factors are responsible for the higher number of failures. We have to identify them soon so that the results are better next time.

 A record number of over 7.5 lakh students had appeared for the examination this year, up by 1.4 lakh. 

 On the brighter side, more students secured first and second division marks than last year. While city students managed to secure only three positions in the top 10, overall they did better than their counterparts from the districts. 

 Bankura Zilla School was clearly the star, bagging the first three slots.

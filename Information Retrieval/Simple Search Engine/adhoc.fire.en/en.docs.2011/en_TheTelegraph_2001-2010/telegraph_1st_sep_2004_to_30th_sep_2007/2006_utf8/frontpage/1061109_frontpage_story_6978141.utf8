 New Delhi, Nov. 8: Delhi today sanctioned additional paramilitary forces for operations against Ulfa and, at the same time, agreed to hold talks with mediators Mamoni Raisom Goswami and Rebati Phukan next week.

 Sources said national security adviser M.K. Narayanan granted an appointment to Phukan and Goswami on November 13, indicating that the government hasnt shut the door on peace talks.

 Phukan will set the agenda for the talks with the Centre after deliberations with the Ulfa-nominated Peoples Consultative Group in Guwahati. The facilitators have in their earlier parleys pressed for the release of the five jailed Ulfa leaders as a condition for direct talks with the Centre. The demand for the release may now be presented in the form of a request. While the process of negotiations looks set to resume, the twin blasts in Guwahati on Sunday have prompted Delhi to send 10 battalions of the BSF and nine companies of CRPF to the state.

 The forces will be deployed by the state government in accordance with its requirements, sources said.

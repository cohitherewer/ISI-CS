 Celebs harm, Chanel helps

 Malini Ramani: Frequent visitor

 New Delhi, Sept. 11: Bina Ramani will remain cooped up in the eight-by-ten foot police lock-up for two more days, scent of Chanel in the air.

 A district court today extended till Wednesday the police remand of the socialite, charged with forging ownership and liquor licences for her south Delhi restobar Tamarind Court where model Jessica Lal was murdered.

 An exasperated police team questioning Bina had sought more time on the ground that their sessions were disrupted once too often by frequent visits from her friends and family.

 The interrogation has faced several disruptions because of the frequent visits by her friends and family. The police would be questioning her and some family member would come and want to talk to her, said M.K. Sharma, the investigating officer.

 Officers at Hauz Khas police station said the most persistent visitor over the past four days had been her fashion designer daughter, Malini. Next was social activist-cum-actress Nafisa Ali.

 Malini has been a caring daughter, bringing her changes of clothes and her toiletry, a police officer said.

 Knowing her mother wasnt used to the smell of a police lock-up, Malini had very thoughtfully brought her mothers favourite perfume over, he said.

 She is also believed to have enquired about Binas health over and over again and requested the police to keep a lookout for whether she faints. Bina had fainted in court last Thursday.

 Although the police maintained her arrest had nothing to do with the Jessica case, the FIR begins by listing the events of the murder.

 Nafisa said the special investigating team probing the Jessica case was behaving inexplicably. On Saturday, it had seized documents from Binas home. The team should be trying to gather evidence against Manu Sharma (main accused in Jessicas murder) rather than arresting a key witness, she said.

 The team also wants to take Bina to Goa, where it believes some crucial documents could be hidden.

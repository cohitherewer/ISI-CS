 Bradman 999 in high HS success

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, June 5: The Higher Secondary results announced today set two records, one allowing the government to breathe easier after the Madhyamik shock and the other enough to take anyones breath away.

 Subhankar Roy Chowdhury, a student of Nripendranarayan Memorial High School in Toofanganj, should be the toast of Cooch Behar after totting up a Bradman-like 99.9 per cent ? 999 out of 1,000 ? beating the earlier record by a clear 2 per cent.

 The school education department would be happier with the overall success rate of 71.82 per cent ? higher than last years by 4.26 per cent ? after Fridays Madhyamik results had shown an embarrassing fall of 5.5 per cent.

 The pass percentage in Higher Secondary examinations had never touched 70 before.

 We feel proud to announce this years results. This is an extraordinary achievement for all of us, Higher Secondary council president Gopa Dutta said. We are especially grateful to our teachers and students.

 One reason for the high success rate could be the new system of evaluation the council had adopted this year, officials suggested. About 24,550 more students have passed compared with last year.

 Calcutta schools again outshone the rest in overall performance, but the districts continued their domination of the top-ten list.

 The success percentage in Calcutta was 81.18, the highest in the 19 districts, followed by Darjeeling at 78.47 per cent. But the metropolis managed only two spots among the toppers. Aghnibha Dutta of Hindu School and Abhisek Chakrabarti of Narendrapur Ramakrishna Mission shared the eighth spot, having scored 977.

 As with the Madhyamik results on Friday, the announcement of todays results was preceded by confusion. Some TV channels jumped the gun and began airing the names of the toppers before the council had officially declared the results at 10 am. The council president said she would probe the media leak.

 Caste divide in AIIMS

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 12: Caste divisions cast a shadow over the All India Institute of Medical Sciences again with reserved category students pulling out of todays resident doctors association polls, alleging discrimination.

 The Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe students, whom the election would have pitted against the anti-quota lobby, have alleged a rise in acts of abuse by general category students.

 Last night, the SC/ST candidates had met AIIMS director P. Venugopal to seek a postponement of the polls. He was handed letters from victimised students that named their alleged tormentors.

 The institute spokesperson confirmed the complaints had been received, but said there wasnt sufficient ground to put off the polls. The anti-quota group won amid 70 per cent polling, with Kumar Harsh elected president.

 Gogoi meets Singh 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 16: Assam chief minister Tarun Gogoi made a courtesy call on Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in the capital today. 

 Gogoi is scheduled to meet AICC president Sonia Gandhi tomorrow. He has already held three rounds of talks on the formation of the new Assam cabinet with the AICC general secretary in charge of Assam, Digvijay Singh and AICC leader Chandan Bagchi.

 Sources said PCC president Bhubaneswar Kalita is also in New Delhi. 

 Gogoi has drawn up certain criteria for the induction of MLAs in the state cabinet. No first-time MLA will be inducted. Only those who have won the publics mandate consistently (without losing even once) will be considered. Gogoi will also seek to bolster his clean image by excluding persons with dubious record from his cabinet.

 As a payback to the Bodoland Peoples Progressive Front for its support in the Assembly elections, three cabinet berths will be offered to the Congress Bodo allies, but not the deputy chief ministers post.

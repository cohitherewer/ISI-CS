 Ire at India

 India quickly put its stamp of approval on the offer by King Gyanendra (picture above), inviting censure from political parties who are unhappy with the monarchs proposals.

 New Delhi said the kings action should now pave the way for the restoration of political stability. 

 An activist associated with the Nepali Congress said: The people will not like this as India will be seen as not sharing their aspirations.

 It is sad that the largest democracy in the world has raised its voice to save the monarchy, said a dejected bureaucrat.

 Many in the Nepalese capital believe India will end up looking very foolish if the seven-party alliance for democracy alliance rejects the kings offer, a likely possibility.

 - Ex-skipper to take control of restaurant

 Sourav: Appetite for business

 Calcutta, May 18: Sourav Ganguly is ready to play skipper again. Only this time, hell be leading Team Souravs.

 Eighteen months after Souravs: The Food Pavilion opened at 20G Park Street,the former Team India captain has decided to take full control of his signature address.

 The restaurant-cum-lounge bar to which Sourav lends his name ? against a monthly royalty ? is owned by Abhishek Entertainment and Foods Private Limited.

 That is set to change, with Sourav taking over the ownership and management mantle.

 Dada (Sourav) is ready to take over. He has been conducting marathon meetings for the past few days. All the documentation has been done and only a few legal formalities remain, said a source at Souravs.

 With this, Sourav Ganguly is padding up for life after cricket that promises to be a fusion of food and fitness.

 Late on Wednesday, Sourav had told The Telegraph about his immediate plans during a relaxed dinner with family and friends at a new restaurant off Sakher Bazaar, hardly a 3-minute drive in his Scorpio from home.

 The first thing on his mind, of course, was cricket. Yes, theres going to be lots of cricket this summer? I am off on June 15 to play for Northamptonshire for two months, he smiled.

 Then theres the gymnasium for which the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government has gifted him land at Behala. It is going to be an elaborate gymnasium all right but its really too early to talk about it, said Sourav, lounging in an orange kurta.

 And in between there is the serious business of backing Brazil at the World Cup. Thats how it has always been, smiled the football fanatic. 

 I also like Argentina and England. As far as players are concerned, all eyes will be on Ronaldhino but I am sure there will be a lot of others to watch out for. Since I will be in England during the Cup, I will try and catch a couple of matches in Germany.

 There was no time for fun and games on Thursday, though. After sitting through the swearing-in ceremony at Raj Bhavan with wife Dona, Sourav headed for his Park Street restaurant.

 A working lunch of soup and noodles in the office of Souravs punctuated a marathon business meeting to iron out the details of the deal.

 Till now, Sourav Gangulys role was that of a mascot who would lend memorabilia, credibility and star appeal to Souravs. And on special days he would drop in and meet some diners. But soon, he will be running the show as the skipper, explained the source.

 And on a pitch that reads: One Day (first floor), Over Boundary (second floor); Maharaj (third floor) and Prince of Cal (top floor).

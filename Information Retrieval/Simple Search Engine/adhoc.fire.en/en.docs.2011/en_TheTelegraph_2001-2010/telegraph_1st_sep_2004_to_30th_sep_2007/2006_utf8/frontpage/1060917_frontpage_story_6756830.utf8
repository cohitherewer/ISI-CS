 Panic in RIMS after threat

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Imphal, Sept. 16: Tension is simmering at the Regional Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS) here after two militant outfits allegedly directed the hospital administration to close down the institute. They even threatened to place two senior officials under house arrest for not complying with their orders. 

 The threat came in the form of a letter from the combined force of the Kuki National Army (KNA) and the Kuki National Front (Military Council) this morning. 

 The letter, delivered simultaneously to the offices of medical superintendent Y. Mohen and deputy director E. Devendra, asked the administration of the leading medical institute of the Northeast to shut it down with immediate effect. 

 The letter also threatened to place the two officials under house arrest for failing to fulfil the demands of the outfits. The demands include reservation of a post of laboratory assistant, two posts of staff nurses and the post of a lower division clerk. 

 The first demand letter came a couple of months ago. You have not responded to our letter till now. In view of this, stringent action (closure of the hospital and house arrest) will now be taken up against you and your authority, said the letter, signed by a functionary of the combined force of the KNA and the KNF (MC). 

 The threat came on the eve of interviews for recruitment to 14 different posts. The interviews are scheduled from Monday to Friday. 

 The letter also said the interviews should be postponed till negotiations are held with the combined force. RIMS director L. Fimate told mediapersons that if the militant groups carried out their threat, then the administration had no option other than to shut down the hospital. 

 Worried over the development, the institutes administration reported the matter to the police. Security measures at the institute were beefed up from today. 

 The director, however, said the interviews would be held as per schedule and recruitment carried out only on the basis of merit. We appeal to all militant groups to keep away from RIMS, he added.

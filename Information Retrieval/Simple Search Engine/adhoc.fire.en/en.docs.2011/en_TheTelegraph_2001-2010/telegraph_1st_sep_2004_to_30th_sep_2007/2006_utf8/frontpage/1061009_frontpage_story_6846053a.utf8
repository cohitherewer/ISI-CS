 Kanshi Ram

 New Delhi, Oct. 9 (PTI) 

 : The founder of the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), 

 Kanshi Ram, died here early today following a heart attack. 

 Ram, 74, died at 12.30 am at his official residence, party 

 sources said. He had been suffering from multiple ailments 

 like diabetes and hypertension and had been under medical 

 observation.

 Born on March 15, 1934, Ram, a politician of Dalit Sikh 

 background, founded the BSP in 1984. Along with Mayawati, 

 he brought the party to power in Uttar Pradesh in 1995. 

 Mayawati became the state's chief minister.

 Ram was also a member of the 11th Lok Sabha (1996-'97). 

 At a political rally in December 2001 in Lucknow, Ram declared 

 Mayawati as his quot;political heir quot; and she took 

 over as president of the BSP.

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh condoled the death of Kanshi 

 Ram saying he was an important voice of the Dalits. Union 

 ministers Lalu Prasad Yadav, Sharad Pawar and Ram Vilas 

 Paswan, Opposition leader L K Advani and BJP leaders Arun 

 Jaitely and Kalraj Mishra were among the first to reach 

 the 11, Humayun Road residence of the BSP chief Mayawati 

 to pay their respects. Railway minister Lalu Prasad Yadav 

 said the country has lost a quot;great leader quot; who 

 inspired Dalits to lead a respectful life.

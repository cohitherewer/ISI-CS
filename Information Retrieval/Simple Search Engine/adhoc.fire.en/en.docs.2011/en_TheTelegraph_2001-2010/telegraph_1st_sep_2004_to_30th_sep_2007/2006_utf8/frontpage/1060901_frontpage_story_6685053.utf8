 OUR BUREAU

 Guwahati, Aug. 31: Assam Governor Lt Gen. (retd.) Ajai Singh today tom-tommed the Northeasts USP in its huge number of well-educated, English-speaking youth and hoped that NICT 2006 the regions biggest information and communications exposition will provide them the leverage to rise and shine on the global scene. 

 Nowhere in the entire country will you find such a large number of well-educated, English-speaking youths than in the Northeast. The only thing lacking for them to showcase their talent was an opening. I hope this event will provide them the opportunity, Singh said after inaugurating the second edition of the Northeast Information Communication and Technology (NICT 2006) exposition at Hotel Landmark here this afternoon. 

 Organised by The Telegraph and Nasscom the apex chamber of commerce for the software and services industry in India the three-day event is aimed at providing the Indian infotech industry an opportunity to network with policymakers, financial institutions, industry and IT enthusiasts of the Northeast. 

 Singh also urged the youth to grab the opportunity being provided by the forum. 

 As Nasscom president Kiran Karnik listened attentively, the governor also made a case for institutionalising IT in the Northeast and expressed his hope that the organisation would take the lead in this direction through NICT. 

 The world is today on the threshold of an IT revolution and it is wonderful that India is one of the leaders in this sector. But what is most encouraging is that Nasscom is offering its services to the Northeast. It is perhaps one of the best gestures towards the region I have seen, Singh added in a passionate speech. 

 Speaking about the states commitment to taking the benefits of IT to the people, the governor revealed that he had himself gone to Bangalore to invite two players to the state, Infosys chief mentor N.R. Narayana Murthy and Wipro chairman Azim Premji. In fact, Murthy visited the state recently. 

 Addressing the packed gathering a little earlier, Nasscom president Kiran Karnik pointed out that the region was endowed with an excellent human resource base. However, we now have to think of how to develop this resource so that employers come here in search of talent. 

 Karnik urged the state governments of the region to create enabling conditions by building infrastructure and developing human resources. 

 In a message wishing NICT 2006 all success which was read out by organising secretary D.D. Purkayastha Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said apart from better integrating the northeastern states with each other and with the rest of the country, IT could also help the cause of the regions development. 

 Speaking during the inaugural function, managing director and CEO of ABP Pvt Ltd, Pramath Raj Sinha, reiterated the media groups commitment towards catalysing the regions economic development.

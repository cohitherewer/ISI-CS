 Trehans turn at health hub

 Calcutta, July 22: A Rs 940-crore healthcare hub with super-speciality units and a stem cell research centre may in three years rid Calcuttans of the need to travel outside for treatment.

 Plans are being finalised for the project, which will offer total organ transplant and reconstruction surgery apart from a range of specialised treatment, said the man behind the $200-million plan, Naresh Trehan.

 It will have similar facilities like MediCity (coming up in Gurgaons National Capital Region), including 19 super-speciality units, a medical school and research units, the executive director of Escorts Heart Institute and Research Centre announced today.

 Trehan, who is also chairman of the Confederation of Indian Industrys national committee on healthcare, wants 50 acres for the hub that will have a 1,000-bed hospital.

 The land issue will be finalised in a couple of months time. I am holding talks with a corporate group for the land, Trehan said without elaborating. He added that construction was likely to start in six months and would be completed in another two years.

 Confirming the project, Bengal health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra said: Trehan has told me he would approach us for land and we will definitely provide him the land.

 The super-speciality units will include those for total organ transplant, cardiology and cardiac surgery, urology, nephrology, neurology, oncology and reconstruction surgery. Apart from the medical school, the hub will have training institutes for nurses and paramedics.

 Trehan, who has a 51 per cent stake in the $250 million (about Rs 1,170 crore) MediCity project, said research units would be set up, including those for stem cell studies. We will conduct research on combining ayurvedic and homoeopathic drugs with allopathic medicines to make it affordable for the common people.

 Trehans is the latest in a string of private sector plans in healthcare for Bengal. Anil Ambani has proposed a Dhirubhai Ambani Health City on 60 acres in Kalyani, near the plot in Haringhata where his infotech institute, a deemed university, is coming up.

 The Association of Hospitals of Eastern India plans a Rs 20,000-crore health city along the proposed Eastern Expressway, with over 100 hospitals offering about 50,000 beds. The Salim Group will develop the infrastructure and take care of maintenance.

 The Tatas are setting up a Rs 92-crore cancer facility on 10 acres in New Town, Rajarhat. The 150-bed super-speciality hospital is the first such Tata project outside Mumbai, where the group has set up the Tata Memorial Cancer Research Institute.

 Hyderabad-based Global Hospitals, which specialises in organ transplants, is discussing a Rs 60-crore unit in Rajarhat.

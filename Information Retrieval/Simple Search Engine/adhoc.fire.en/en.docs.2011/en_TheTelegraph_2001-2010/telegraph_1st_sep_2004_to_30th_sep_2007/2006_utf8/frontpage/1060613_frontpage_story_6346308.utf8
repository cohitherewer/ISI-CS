Dope watchdog gets the Fifa boot

- Football shows way to other sports by undermining anti-drug agency 

KEIR RADNEDGE

 Diego Maradona suffered from drug problems 

at the end of his career 

As the World Cup gathers pace, unfashionable issues 

such as governance, structure, commercialisation and doping drop off the top of 

the agenda.

Here and now is about Germanys porous defence, 

Englands heatstroke, Trinidads energy, Hollands potential. Yet, 

behind the scenes, battle lines are being drawn for one of the most significant 

conflicts in world sport.

Provocation was delivered in front of delegates and 

officials from 199 football associations plus a smattering of journalists.

Footballs governing body, Fifa, has just become 

the envy of the rest of world sport ? not for the billions it generates through 

the World Cup, not the length and breadth of its worldwide reach, but for undermining 

the authority of the World Anti Doping Authority (Wada).

There is nothing, it appears, which the king of sports 

and its leader, Sepp Blatter, cannot achieve.

This has been a bad month for Wada and its Canadian 

leader, Dick Pound, who uses the anti-doping authority as a power base after being 

beaten by Jacques Rogge last election time for leadership of the International 

Olympic Committee (IOC).

First, Wada was roundly attacked for misusing its 

power in the French-inspired pursuit of seven-time Tour de France winner Lance 

Armstrong. That took a chip out of Wada and Pounds credibility and authority. 

But even worse for Wada were the revelations of how it has been nailed to the 

floor by world football.

Almost unnoticed football has driven a coach and horses 

through the penal element of the anti-drugs code. The entire credibility of many 

Olympic sports may be at stake in the not-too-distant future. Perhaps not before 

the Games go to Beijing in two years time but very possible before the party 

rolls on to London in 2012.

The story is easily told.

Governments of most of the worlds major nations 

signed up to Wada and its insistence that doping has no place in sport. So did 

most major sports.

All accepted the principle of a minimum two-year ban 

for any athlete who tested positive to the presence in his or her body of an illegal, 

performance-enhancing substance.

Two years in all circumstances, no matter how that 

substance may have found its way into the athletes system: whether directly 

deliberately or on a doctors innocently-mistaken prescription.

That may sound tough but it was meant to be tough: 

to enforce clean sport through fear of the consequences of dope-taking, 

if nothing else.

So far, so good.

The one sport which delayed signing up to Wada was 

football, represented by Fifa. World football, arrogant perhaps, would not countenance 

any other authority dictating events in its own back yard. 

Without signing up to Wada, football could not continue 

to participate in the Olympic Games since the IOC has long been a signatory to 

the code.

Blatter, however, insisted that a two-year initial 

suspension was too much in a sport whose players enjoy only a comparatively short 

career. Thus, for the past two years, Fifa and Wada have danced warily around 

each other.

But the closer the sport moved towards Beijing, the 

pressure for settlement grew. Fifa and Wada even took the issue to the Court of 

Arbitration for Sport in Lausanne and both claimed to have been vindicated by 

a split-way verdict.

Fifa sat back on its hill overlooking Zurich in a 

position of ever-increasing strength. Wada needed football on board for the sake 

of its own credibility; the IOC needed football, with its significant crowd-pulling 

capacity, in Beijing. Blatter knew he could afford to play a waiting game.

Eventually, in secret, the heads of the legal departments 

of Fifa and Wada came together. The outcome has been almost total capitulation 

by Wada because it has had to concede to football the right of individual 

case management.

This means that football, unlike other sports, has 

been granted the licence to judge each case on its subjectively assessed circumstances.

Punishments for misuse of a social drug 

start with a mere caution while Fifa has also won the right to halve the prescribed 

punishments if a player can prove no significant fault or negligence.

That means a two-year ban could be cut to one year 

for a first offender. Wadas ultimate sanction of a life ban could be cut 

to eight years.

The conundrum is this: doping is not as dangerous 

an issue in football as in other sporting disciplines. No drug has been concocted 

which can make a World Cup superstar pass the ball more accurately, tackle more 

effectively, read the game more intelligently, save a shot more athletically.

By contrast, drugs do make a difference to boxers, 

weightlifters, cyclists, oarsmen and sprinters: remember Ben Johnson, to name 

but one in a litany of gold-medal cheats?

Presumably, other sports will now clamour for identical 

relaxations of the Wada code as have been granted to football. How can Wada resist? 

And then, what will be the point of Wada?

A victory for football and the World Cup may come 

at a terrible cost to the credibility of other sports and the Olympic Games.

 Infocom to return with new look and feel 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Dec. 9: The curtains came down on Infocom 2006 today with the promise of a bigger edition next November. 

 At the closing ceremony of the countrys biggest information, communication and technology (ICT) exposition, the organisers also unveiled a new logo for Infocom 2007. 

 In five years, Infocom has evolved into a flagship IT event of the country, providing a much-needed platform between global companies and the Indian ICT industry. Now the idea is to make it bigger and better and foster the spirit of change and innovation, said a spokesperson, announcing the dates between November 28 and December 2 for the next meet. 

 The new logo for Infocom 2007 has been designed to convey a vibrant look and feel. A riot of colours has been added to reflect the young spirit while the closely set letters signify inter-dependence. 

 The conference has come to a close after the IT ministers roundtable, but the exhibition on the Helipad grounds in Salt Lake Stadium will continue till tomor- row, where the main attraction will be The Telegraph Jobs Mart that saw 50 people bagging offers on Day One. 

 The response to Infocom 2006 has been phenomenal and the participants have expressed the desire to join us next year, an organiser said. 

 From instituting the Infocom Future Leadership Award to including the healthcare sector and encouraging innovations to providing a true international platform Infocom 2006 expanded the scope and size of the exposition. We have selected 100 students, after knowledge workshops across seven districts of Bengal, to expose them to computer training, the organiser said.

 Delhi sets up date with NDFB

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Kokrajhar, May 23: The militant National Democratic Front of Boroland (NDFB) will hold its first round of talks with Delhi on Saturday, four days before the current period of ceasefire lapses.

 The NDFB had become increasingly restive in the weeks leading to the declaration of election results, accusing Delhi of deliberately delaying talks and Dispur of unnecessarily targeting its members. 

 NDFB secretary general Govinda Basumatary confirmed over the phone that a five-member delegation would leave for New Delhi on Friday to begin the dialogue. He said the first round of talks would focus on extension of the ceasefire for a specific period.

 The secessionist outfit had said recently that extension of the ceasefire would depend on Delhi providing information about activists who went missing during the military offensive by Bhutan.

 Basumatary tried to downplay the start of the talks, apparently wary of fuelling expectations. It will not be formal peace talks. We have also conveyed whatever needs to be conveyed to the home ministry on the issue (of missing cadre), the rebel leader said.

 State home commissioner Rajib Bora said Dispur would send a representative to the talks.

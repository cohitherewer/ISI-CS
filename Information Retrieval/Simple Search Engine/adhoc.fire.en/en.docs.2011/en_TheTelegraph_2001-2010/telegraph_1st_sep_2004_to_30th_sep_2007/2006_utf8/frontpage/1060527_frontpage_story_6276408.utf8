 Calcutta, May 26: Need

 number of your nearest theatre is not at hand? All you need 

 to do is log on to The Telegraphs wapsite from 

 your mobile phone.

 Simply type in www.telegraphindia.com/wap 

 on your phone browser to connect to the mobile version of 

 the paper. 

 At the City Cinema section, one can choose according to language or theatres to see whats playing where, said a spokesperson for the Internet division of ABP Ltd, which developed the service.

 Click on English, Hindi or Bengali to see whats filling the screens or surf through the play list of the theatres for show timings of the movies. Ticket booking numbers are provided as links. Click on them to connect and make your bookings, added the spokesperson.

 The Telegraphs newspaper-on-the-mobile service is over two years old and can be accessed from any GPRS-enabled phone. The general packet radio service, or GPRS, allows mobile users to access Internet on their handsets.

 The Telegraph was the first newspaper in the country to make the paper available on the mobile, in August 2004, explained the spokesperson. You can use the service from anywhere in the world and dont even need access to a PC.

 The sections appear as they do in the newspaper, arranged according to Front Page, Nation, Calcutta, Bengal, Sports, Weather and more. Click on a section to read the news items in a reader-friendly format devised specially to fit the mobile screen.

 The lack of speedy surfing is 

 a big complaint from GPRS users in the city. But even on 

 a slow connection or network congestion, navigation will 

 be a breeze on this site, said ABPs Internet division.

 So if youve missed the morning 

 paper and have some time to spare on your way to office 

 or want to make friends in college read a news item you 

 liked, all you need to do is head to The Telegraph 

 wapsite on your mobile phone.

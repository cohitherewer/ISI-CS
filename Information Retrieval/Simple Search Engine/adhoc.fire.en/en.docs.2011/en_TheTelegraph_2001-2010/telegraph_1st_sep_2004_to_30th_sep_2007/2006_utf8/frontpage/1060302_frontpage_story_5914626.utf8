 Sushmitas car seized

 Sen: Star stalled

 Mumbai, March 1 (Agencies): Sanjay, Suniel, Saif and now, Sushmita.

 Sushmita Sens Land Cruiser was today seized by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) on charges of evading customs duty, adding another name to the list of Bollywood actors in a spot for the offence.

 Sanjay Dutts Porsche and Suniel Shettys Hummer were seized late last October. Saif Ali Khan appeared before the customs department early this January to answer duty evasion charges on his Toyota Lexus.

 Sushmita has been asked to cough up Rs 20 lakh in customs duty for the luxury vehicle priced at Rs 56 lakh in the market. She bought it from dealer Haren Choksi last May.

 DRI sources said the amount of duty payable on the Land Cruiser ? imported last March ? was fudged by mentioning December 1998 as its manufacture date in its papers, though the actual date was 2003.

 Therefore, the value of the vehicle was declared very less with a customs duty of Rs 9 lakh being paid on the vehicle, a source said. The importer and the broker miscleared the chassis number of the vehicle that has a market value of Rs 56 lakh.

 The actual duty payable on the Land Cruiser was Rs 20 lakh, he added. 

 Toyota confirmed that it was manufactured in 2003, the source said.

 Sushmita was not available for comment.

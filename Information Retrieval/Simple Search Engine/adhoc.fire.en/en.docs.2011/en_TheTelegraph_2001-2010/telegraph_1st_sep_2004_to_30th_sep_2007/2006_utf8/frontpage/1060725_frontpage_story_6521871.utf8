 Jaswant to lift veil on mole 

 - Name to be revealed to PM alone

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 24: Jaswant 

 Singh today accepted the Prime Ministers challenge, 

 announcing that he would reveal the name of the mole 

 in P.V. Narasimha Raos office to the Prime Minister 

 tomorrow.

 Yesterday, the Prime Minister 

 had dared the former foreign minister to substantiate the 

 claim he has made in his book, A Call To Honour: In Service 

 of Emergent India, that there was a mole in Raos 

 PMO. 

 If he has the courage and 

 the decency, why does he not name the mole? Manmohan 

 had said. Jaswant took exception to the language but said 

 he would tell the Prime Minister who the American 

 mole was.

 In the book, Jaswant writes that 

 he has a letter which proves that a key official in Raos 

 office was leaking Indias nuclear secrets to the US. 

 Jaswant has been critical of the 

 Indo-US nuclear deal of late. His book implies that he has 

 proof of the Congress allowing the Americans to influence 

 Indias strategic interests.

 If you read the full text 

 of the letter, you will find echoes of the continuation 

 of the US policy in the July 18 Indo-US agreement (on nuclear 

 cooperation) and what the US expects of India, he 

 said. 

 Jaswant alleged that the honour 

 of the PMO was at stake. We were snooped and are still 

 being snooped. The BJP leader did not name the mole 

 in the book.

 His party, the BJP, is clearly 

 embarrassed by the revelations. Senior leaders said references 

 to the mole would only hurt the BJP. 

 Even if we knew about the 

 mole, the question to be asked is: what were we doing about 

 it for six years that we were in power, said one. 

 The party has reportedly asked Jaswant to clear misunderstandings 

 caused by the book.

 Besides meeting the Prime Minister 

 to reveal the identity of the mole, Jaswant is expected 

 to clear the air on a number of revelations about the Kandahar 

 hijack, Pokhran blasts and the Gujarat riots tomorrow. 

 Following suggestions from the 

 party in a meeting last night, Jaswant would meet the media 

 and respond to queries about the book.

 His references to Kandahar have 

 reportedly upset several leaders, including Atal Bihari 

 Vajpayee on whom lay the ultimate responsibility for the 

 decision to trade terrorists for the passengers of the hijacked 

 Indian Airlines plane. 

 Party leaders are also upset over 

 Jaswant making public the demand for $200 million made by 

 the terrorists for the release of the hostages.

 Others are angry that the book 

 has diverted attention from the Mumbai bomb blasts. The 

 focus is back on Kandahar, an embarrassing subject for the 

 BJP.

 The party was taking an 

 aggressive stand on internal security, particularly in the 

 aftermath of the Mumbai blasts. The government was on the 

 back foot. But his book has put us on the defensive, 

 said a leader.

 The view is echoed by the RSS 

 mouthpiece, Organiser, in its latest issue.

 However unnecessary, even damaging, 

 the controversy might be for the BJP, the more the book 

 is talked about the better the sales.

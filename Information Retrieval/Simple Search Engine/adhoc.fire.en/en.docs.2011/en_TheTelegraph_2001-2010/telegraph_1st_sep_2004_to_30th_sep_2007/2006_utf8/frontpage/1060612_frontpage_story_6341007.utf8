 CPM tie-up 

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Hyderabad, June 11: The CPM today tied up with the Telugu Desam for the June 28 state panchayat polls over Congress protests, sending its central ally a stern signal amid the fuel price standoff.

 The alliance in 12 of the states 23 districts ends the Marxists eight-year separation from N. Chandrababu Naidu, during which the former Andhra CEO was reviled for his World Bank-dictated economic policies and his partnership with the communal BJP.

 It also represents a snub from the CPM to the Congress whose government at the Centre it has propped up for two years despite serious differences over economic and foreign policies.

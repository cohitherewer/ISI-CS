 Cricket clash moves to police station 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, March 16: The war between the current and previous bosses of the cricket board reached the police station today with a first information report being filed against former president Jagmohan Dalmiya, alleging financial wrongdoing.

 Niranjan Shah, secretary in the Board of Control for Cricket in India, walked into the Marine Drive police station in south Mumbai this evening to lodge the FIR against Dalmiya and four others.

 Shah confirmed having taken the step but declined to provide details.

 Dalmiya said in a statement: Although there is no truth in their allegations, it seems that the present BCCI management has a single-point agenda to malign me.

 Another battlefront opened in a Calcutta court with former BCCI legal counsel Ushanath Banerjee seeking Rs 1.5 crore in defamation damages from board vice-president Lalit Modi for allegedly saying he had received more money under Dalmiya than even Rahul Dravid.

 In a third development on the day, Calcutta High Court held a hearing of the BCCI appeal against a stay granted on the showcause notice the board had served on Dalmiya.

 Last month, accusing him of misappropriating funds worth Rs 20 crore related to the 1996 World Cup, the board had asked Dalmiya for an explanation within 15 days as to why action should not be taken against him. Dalmiya later obtained a stay on the notice.

 In todays FIR, nine sections 

 of the Indian Penal Code were mentioned, police sources 

 said. The charges range from misappropriation of property 

 to criminal conspiracy. 

 Other than Dalmiya, those named are former board secretary S.K. Nair, former treasurers Kishore Rungta and Jyoti Bajpai, and Dalmiyas office staffer Kishen Chowdhary, who had allegedly been authorised to carry out certain transactions.

 In his statement, Dalmiya raised the obvious question why the BCCI had filed the FIR even when the matter is sub judice. 

 Their pre-determined malicious intent is very clear. First, they asked me to hand over the papers, which I did. Thereafter, they raised certain queries, which were required to be answered by me within seven days. Even before the deadline, they issued a showcause notice. Despite that, I have answered all the queries and yet, now these false criminal charges.

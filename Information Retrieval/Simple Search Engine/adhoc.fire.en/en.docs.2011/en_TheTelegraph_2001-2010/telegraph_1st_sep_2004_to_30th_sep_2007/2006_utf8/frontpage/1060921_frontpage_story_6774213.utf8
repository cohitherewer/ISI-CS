 Capital of chaos at mob mercy 

 OUR BUREAU

New Delhi, Sept. 20: Indias 

 capital today came face to face with the urban Frankenstein 

 its political class has sired.

 West Asia-style street skirmishes broke out in several stretches of Delhi against a drive to weed out commercial establishments from residential neighbourhoods, spilling blood on a blueprint to make the capital a world-class city and challenging the invincibility of the legal process.

 Faced with hordes of shopkeepers railing against a persistent effort by the Supreme Court to uphold a master plan meant to transform the city by 2021, police opened fire.

 At least two boys and a man died, though officials refused to confirm the casualties.

 But hospital authorities confirmed to The Telegraph that bullet wounds were responsible for the deaths of two boys one 7, the other 14 and another person.

 Nearly a hundred civilians and around 20 policemen were injured in the protests, centred on the north-east Seelampur area.

 The Delhi civic bodys sealing drive has been going on for several months, but the most violent clash between traders and the administration came on a day shop owners had called a bandh.

 We have all joined this strike because we see this (drive) to be unfair, said Neeraj Sharma, a manager of a garment shop in Connaught Place.

 The Supreme Court had last year ordered the sealing of all commercial establishments in residential areas. 

 The court order had set rolling not only a demolition drive, which targeted shops of commoners as well as celebrities, but also a game of political expediency.

 If the ruling Congress balked 

 at the backlash and the certain loss of the trader vote 

 bank, the listless BJP saw in it an opportunity to revive 

 its fortunes. Soon, most parties got together and pushed 

 through Parliament concessions for the traders. 

 A response in a similar vein was 

 in evidence today, too, with the urban development minister 

 suggesting that even a special session of Parliament can 

 be called to get around the court order. However, how feasible 

 this plan is remains to be seen.

 The explosion of violence today was symptomatic of a cancerous disease that has afflicted Indias boomtowns.

 Endemic corruption blessed by politicians and lax law-enforcement ensured by officials have led to construction chaos in Delhi, as in other cities across the country. Hundreds of thousands of buildings have sprung up illegally across the capital, often built with little regard for safety, aesthetics or zoning laws.

 By moving against the illegal shops, the Supreme Court was making a beginning a drive that had turned itself into a test case with implications for the rest of the country.

 But the sealing effort almost came to a standstill today with the corporation acting against only 24 of the thousands of illegal establishments.

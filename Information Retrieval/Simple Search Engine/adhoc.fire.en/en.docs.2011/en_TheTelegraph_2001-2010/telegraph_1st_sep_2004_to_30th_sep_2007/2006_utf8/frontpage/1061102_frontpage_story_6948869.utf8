 Sahi yields, goes to jail 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Ranchi, Nov. 1: Realising his chances of becoming a minister were dim, Forward Bloc legislator Bhanu Pratap Sahi today surrendered before a court in Garhwa which sent him to judicial remand for 14 days. 

 Sahi, the Bhavnathpur MLA whose ministerial ambitions have been dashed by pending arrest warrants and a governor unwilling to relent, went over to the court of the Garhwa chief judicial magistrate and gave himself up. 

 The warrant issued by the Garhwa court pertained to a complaint filed last year by one Kedarnath Tiwary, a panchayat sevak, accusing the MLA of thrashing him and obstructing him in carrying out official work. At least two other warrants are pending against Sahi where charges have been pressed under the Scheduled Caste Prevention of Atrocities Act. 

 Sahis surrender comes two days before Jharkhand High Court decides the course of action against police inspector-general D.K. Pandey for illegally staying action in cases in which the MLA was facing warrants of arrest. 

 Sahi is expected to file his bail petition tomorrow, but said chief minister Madhu Koda was free to fill up the vacant cabinet slot with anyone he chooses to. Governor Syed Sibtey Razi had earlier prevented Sahi from taking oath as minister on the ground that he was facing non-bailable arrest warrants. 

 Before going to jail, Sahi slammed the erstwhile NDA regime for slapping false cases against him in a bid to get his support. The MLA claimed he had even been offered Rs 5 crore and a swanky car to join the NDA cabinet. I rejected it as I could not have bartered the support of my 10-lakh electorate, he said. 

 The controversial MLA tried to present himself as a martyr, saying it was his third visit to jail. I am ready to undertake such jail trips 300 times if they are in public interest, he said.

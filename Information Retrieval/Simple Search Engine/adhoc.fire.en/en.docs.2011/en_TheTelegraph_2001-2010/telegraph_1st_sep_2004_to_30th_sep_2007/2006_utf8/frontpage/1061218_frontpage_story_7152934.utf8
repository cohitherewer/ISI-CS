 Kohima pastor held for raping daughter

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Kohima, Dec. 17: Police today arrested a pastor on charges of sexually abusing his daughter for the past 10 years.

 Lhouveituo alias Do- Mierio was arrested from Seithekiema Basa village, around 60 km from the state capital, on the basis of a complaint filed by the victim on Saturday.

 Even as the police refused to disclose the identity of the victim, sources said she was a student of a college in Dimapur. 

 The girls friends, whom she narrated the physical and mental trauma that she was suffering for a decade, urged her to seek police help, they said. 

 The girl said she had been forced to undergo as many as five abortions in a private clinic at Dimapur.

 A pastor of local Christian revival church and a father of six children, Lhouveituo was active in religious activities in the area till his daughter revealed her fathers satanic deeds, a police official said.

 The police said during interrogation the priest admitted to committing the crime. The police are also questioning the pastors two other daughters on suspicion that they, too, could have been sexually abused. 

 They have been sent for medical examination.

 Considering her (the victims) age and the number of abortions she had undergone so far, it is evident that she was very young when her father started sexually abusing her, the police official said.

 The girl told the police that her father threatened her and her mother of dire consequences, even to kill them unless they kept their mouths shut. 

 The police have also taken the girls mother into custody for interrogation. She is likely to get equal punishment as her husband for her failure to report the crime to the authorities even after 10 years, the official said. 

 It is the duty of a mother to report the torture of her daughter by any man, including the father, to the authorities, as a minor girl would not only be unaware of the abuse, but also helpless. The woman cannot escape responsibility for her husbands deeds on their daughter(s) simply by citing fear of social stigma. She is equally responsible, the official said.

 The police have also summoned the owner of the clinic for questioning. The official said the latter would also face punishment. 

 The church is likely to expel the priest.

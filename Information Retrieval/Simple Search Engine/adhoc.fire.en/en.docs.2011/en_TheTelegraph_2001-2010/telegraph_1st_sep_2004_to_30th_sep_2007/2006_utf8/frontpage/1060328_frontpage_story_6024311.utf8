 Shahi Imam props up Assam front

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Guwahati, March 27: In a development that can change the contour of minority politics in the country, the Shahi Imam of Delhis Jama Masjid, Maulana Syed Ahmed Bukhari, today called for a political force for Muslims and other weaker sections of society.

 Bukhari, who is here to campaign for the nascent Assam United Democratic Front (AUDF), said the Muslims in the country were looking at the party because the future political course of the community would depend on its success.

 Since Independence, the Muslim community in the country has depended on so-called secular parties as a crutch which had exploited us, but now we have overcome our weakness. The AUDF has shown us that we can also stand on our feet, the Shahi Imam said, hoping for a similar front at the national level.

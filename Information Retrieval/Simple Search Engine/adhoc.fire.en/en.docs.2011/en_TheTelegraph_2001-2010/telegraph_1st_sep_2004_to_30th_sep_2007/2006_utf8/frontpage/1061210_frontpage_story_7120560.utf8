 Koda claims dodge facts

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Ranchi, Dec. 9: Chief minister Madhu Koda portrayed himself as the messiah of downtrodden at the Inter-state Council meeting today but his claims in Delhi and reality in the state appeared to be as different as chalk and cheese.

 Addressing the meeting, Koda said implementation of the schemes under the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act was satisfactory. He had, however, detected during the recent review meetings in the state capital that the utilisation of funds for the schemes was below 20 per cent in several districts. 

 Claiming that the Prevention of Atrocities against Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Act, 1979, has been playing a crucial role in administering justice to Dalits and tribals, the chief minister said his government was committed to ensure its smooth execution. 

 The UPA government led by Koda was, however, in the eye of the storm some time ago for trying to shield Forward Bloc legislator Bhanu Pratap Sahi, booked under the same act. 

 Koda also advocated a central helpline in every state capital to safeguard the cause of the labourers from Jharkhand working in other states. He also stressed that placement agencies hiring labourers should get themselves registered with the block office from where they were hiring labourers.

 The chief minister said a large number of Dalits and tribals from Jharkhand migrate in search of bread and butter, but they are exploited there. Women labourers were the worst victims, he said. 

 Urging all states to make concerted efforts to foil the nefarious designs of brokers, he demanded strict execution of Inter-state Migrant Workers Act, 1979.

 Koda announced that his government was mulling an advisory committee for the scheduled castes. The state government has also decided to form primitive tribes development authority, he said. 

 Koda also demanded a new law for the speedy disposal of cases related to violation of forest laws.

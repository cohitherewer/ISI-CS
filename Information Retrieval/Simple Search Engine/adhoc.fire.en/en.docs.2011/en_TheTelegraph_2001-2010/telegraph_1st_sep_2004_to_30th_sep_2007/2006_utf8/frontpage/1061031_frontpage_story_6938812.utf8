 Train scare

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Hyderabad, Oct. 30: Passengers on a superfast express from Howrah today endured a 3-km horror run after two wheels fell off a coach but the train raced on at 100 km an hour.

 When the driver, sensing something amiss, finally brought the Secunderabad-bound Falaknuma Express to a halt, the affected coach was yards from a bridge that some of the front compartments had already crossed.

 S-11 was lurching dangerously and had it hit the railings at that speed, there might have been a disaster, officials said. We were screaming. Most of us rushed into the adjacent compartments, said Niraj Roy.

 Cassius: stalker 

 who never smiled 

 - Author fondly remembers handsome guy with lean and 

 hungry look 

 My Childhood 

 Mamoni Raisom Goswami

 Recalling 

 how her teenage years were infested with a variety of admirers, 

 the writer winds up the third instalment of stories about 

 her lovers.

 The mighty Brahmaputra flowed 

 close to our house. In fact, the city of Guwahati is situated 

 on the banks of the river. On all sides, except one, the 

 city is surrounded by a chain of hills. It is flanked by 

 the Brahmaputra on the last side. 

 The view from any of the hilltops 

 is spectacular. In those days, much of the city was covered 

 by dense vegetation. It used to look spellbinding. The special 

 tropical beauty of the city enchanted people. Often I used 

 to stroll on the bank of the river along with my sister, 

 and there were admirers even on the bank of the river! 

 The old river dock under the Ahoms 

 had become a beautiful lake over the years. It is known 

 as Dighalipukhuri (the long lake). It is a beautiful place 

 for people to come out in the evenings and enjoy a walk. 

 My sister and I used to frequent this place as well. 

 One evening, we found that a tall, 

 handsome man was following us. The streetlights were already 

 on and in the grim glow of the neon lamps, I saw his face. 

 It felt as if he did not know how to smile. He was unaware 

 of that art. His face appeared to me like that of the Shakespearean 

 character Cassius (in Julius Caesar). The line attributed 

 to him in the play, that lean and hungry look, 

 also flashed in my mind. 

 Over the days, it became a regular 

 practice for the man to follow both of us. One day, he came 

 to me and, to my shock, handed me a copy of a Bengali book, 

 Lekhakder Prem. I still have the book with me. What I remember 

 vividly was his one line to me: You dont know 

 how to die, but make other people die. Ever since 

 the day the line was uttered, I stopped visiting the lake 

 altogether. 

 I remember another guy who came 

 to teach me music and tried to find his way into my heart. 

 He, too, finally left, driven away by one of my braver cousins. 

 Even in Cotton College, I had 

 a few admirers. One of them, Debkumar Saikia, is still a 

 good friend of mine. He is famous in the world of theatre 

 in Assam today. 

 Our class used to face the Panbazar 

 crossroads. It was an old room in an old building. There 

 were desks and benches and they, too, were very old, the 

 wood looking polished with over half a century of human 

 touch. 

 I had taken honours in Assamese 

 literature and took a subsidiary paper in Bengali. Ours 

 was a small batch and in that small batch, we were the only 

 two girls that year with that subject. Nirmali and I used 

 to sit at the two corners of the same bench. Since it was 

 a small class, we were introduced to each other in the presence 

 of our teachers. 

 Of the teachers, I particularly 

 remember the late Vinay Chowdhury and the late Hemanta Sarma. 

 Both took special care of the students. In those days, teachers 

 considered it a personal responsibility to ensure that their 

 students become better people in the world. 

 My teachers knew that my father 

 was the former principal of Cotton College. Therefore, for 

 even the minutest mistake that I would make, they would 

 make a reference to my father and say that I am not supposed 

 to make such small mistakes! But there was only love and 

 affection in their whole reference to my father. 

 About a week or so had passed 

 since our classes began. One day, I saw a poem written on 

 one side of the bench, the side on which I always sat. Nothing 

 was written on the side where Nirmali sat. The poem was 

 romantic and written for me, in my praise. I took out my 

 handkerchief and rubbed it off. The next morning another 

 poem on the bench greeted me when I took my seat. And once 

 again, I took out my handkerchief and rubbed it off. 

 I felt too embarrassed to complain 

 about it to my teachers and felt equally embarrassed to 

 tell my friends about it. The whole thing went on for many 

 days, and every day I would return home with a handkerchief 

 stained with ink. The maid who washed our clothes finally 

 told me to use a pen that didnt leak!

 After many days, I mustered the 

 courage to tell one of my friends about the entire thing. 

 He took it upon himself to find out those responsible for 

 this activity. And to my surprise, a few days later, the 

 result was there to be seen. Whoever was writing the poems 

 stopped doing it! I asked my friend about the person(s) 

 responsible, but he didnt mention any names. 

 Time went by, and many decades 

 later, I went to Cotton College in 2001 as a guest for its 

 centenary celebrations. I also wrote several articles on 

 my college experiences in the different publications that 

 came out as part of its centenary programmes. In it, I mentioned 

 about the episodes when someone wrote beautiful 

 poems on my bench but whose identity had remained a secret. 

 Then, some days later, Debkumar 

 Saikia wrote to me saying he still has some of the poems 

 that he wrote on the bench decades ago for me! I was surprised. 

 In fact, he sent me copies of some of them that were still 

 with him. One of them was: 

 I aint dead, my Beatrice!

 Still, I walk through the storm 

 My heart emboldened

 By the lanes around Cotton College, 

 along the bank of Dighalipukhuri

 Dressed in my blue robe, I pace 

 up and down 

 In the companyof the night

 Murthys 0004 era comes to an end

 ANIL BUDUR LULLA

 Bangalore, Aug. 19: From Monday, the card of Employee Number 0004 will no longer be swiped for attendance at Infosys.

 The cardholder, also known as N.R. Narayana Murthy, will step down as executive chairman on Sunday, when he turns 60.

 Although Murthy will have considerable say in Infosys even after Sunday, a few things will change among them the card-swiping ritual he did not miss for the last 25 years whenever he was in Bangalore.

 In his new position as non-executive chairman and chief mentor, Murthy will not have to come to office, will not draw a monthly salary and his name will be deleted from the Infosys employees roster. 

 I would lose all of that, Murthy told PTI today. I have enjoyed doing what I did in creating this company.... Nurturing it so far. 

 Although he had announced his retirement some time ago, the Infosys board said last month that Murthy would continue as non-executive chairman and remain chief mentor from August 21. 

 Murthys role as non-executive chairman is primarily to preside over the board to make sure that the succession planning of the CEO is well-handled. 

 The non-executive chairman is also expected to ensure that the board discharges its responsibility in making sure there is a good strategy with the company, that strategy is well executed and the finest principles of corporate governance are followed, Murthy said.

 Nandan Nilekani, who was handed the reins by Murthy in 2002, will stay as chief executive officer and managing director.

 Murthy, who had earlier ruled out a political career for himself, is now expected to focus on his commitments with universities abroad. So, I will be as busy as I am today, perhaps busier, he said.

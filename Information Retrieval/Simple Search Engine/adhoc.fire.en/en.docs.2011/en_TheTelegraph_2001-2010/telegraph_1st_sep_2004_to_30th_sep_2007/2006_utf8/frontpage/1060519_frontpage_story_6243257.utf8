Thursday thud

OUR BUREAU 

May 18: If Mondays Mayhem was bad, Terror 

Thursday was a massacre: the sensex plunged by 826 points ? its worst one-day 

fall in history ? as stocks sank in a swelling tide of fear over the governments 

plan to slap harsher taxes on a growing tribe of carpetbaggers who aim to skim 

profits off a surging market. 

At the end of a torrid day of trading, the 30-share 

index stood at 11391 points ? a fall of 826 points, or 6.76 per cent. The previous 

biggest one-day fall was 570.42 points on April 28, 1992. All the 30 shares that 

make up the index slumped with ACC, Hindalco and Tata Steel getting battered the 

most and ceding over 10 per cent each. 

India also caught the chill from the weakness in other 

parts of Asia, which wilted in the face of a rising prospect that interest rates 

in the US would go up farther, making emerging markets less attractive for foreign 

investors. 

The tax departments circular on the differential 

treatment for the traders and investors and no specific clarification as to the 

status of foreign institutional investors (FIIs) spooked the market. It was felt 

that the FIIs would also be categorised as traders and they would have to pay 

taxes at much higher rates, which will definitely see big foreign money going 

out of the country, said an analyst. 

The finance ministry scrambled to allay fears that 

its new tax assessment criteria for a new litmus test to distinguish between investment 

and trading incomes would not hurt FIIs, but the damage was already done. 

Traders have to pay a 41 per cent tax on the profits 

they make from short-term investments on the bourses. Profits from investments 

are treated as capital gains and taxed at a lower rate, 10 per cent. 

The market crash today signalled a two-year denouement 

for the Congress after its shock Lok Sabha election victory. Two years ago ? on 

May 17, 2004 ? the market had tumbled 565 points, which had been the biggest fall 

in recent memory. 

But the government chose not to react to the precipitous 

fall in the sensex. Everyday movement in the stock markets does not require 

a comment, finance minister P. Chidambaram said.

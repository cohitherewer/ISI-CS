Calcutta/Dankuni, Oct. 3: Five members of a family and the driver were killed on the night of Dussehra when their Honda City rammed into a trailer on Durgapur Expressway near the Dankuni toll plaza, 20 km from here. 

 Anish Parekh, 40, and his wife Roshni, 35, were returning with their children Kunal, 8, and Kinjal, 12 and Anishs niece Ishita, 10, from Petarwar, near Bokaro, after attending the birthday celebrations of their guru. Rajesh Shukla, 30, was at the wheel.

 The new car hit a trailer parked by the side of the road and skidded around 11.45 pm. 

 Anishs mother Sarala, 70, who had travelled to Bokaro by train with relatives, returned this morning to the fifth-floor flat on 43 Southern Avenue where the family had moved six years ago from B.B. Ganguly Street. She collapsed when she found them dead.

 While four died on the spot, Roshni and Kinjal were taken to the nearby Uttarpara General Hospital where Kinjal died. Roshni was rushed to SSKM hospital but died on the way, an officer of Dankuni police station said. 

 Anish, who ran the familys chemicals business and had survived lung cancer, was the youngest of three siblings. Both his sisters Rajashri and Kalpana are married.

 Kunal studied in Calcutta Boys School and Kinjal was a student of Our Lady Queen of the Mission School. 

 The six had left around 4 am yesterday and reached Bokaro by afternoon, where Sarala and others were waiting. After offering prayers at the Jain temple and celebrating their gurus birthday, Anish decided to return saying he had to go to work today. 

 His mother has fainted thrice. She is asking just one question for whom will she live now? Navin, 60, Anishs uncle, sobbed.

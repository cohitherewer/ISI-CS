 No shoulder to lean on

Sachin out for 8 weeks

Mumbai, March 21: The weight of expectations 

has taken its toll.

 After carrying the hopes of a billion and more for 16 years, Sachin Tendulkars shoulder has given way. Hes to undergo surgery for the second time inside 10 months ? only, on the right shoulder and not the left elbow. 

 This, too, will be performed in London by Dr Andrew Wallace.

 The announcement by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), late this evening, relegated to the background the potentially thrilling finish to the India versus England Test series. Had Team India been listed on the bourses, the stock would have crashed.

 Its possible chairman Kiran More was taken into confidence, but the other four selectors were stunned when joint-secretary Mohinder Pandove began reading physio John Glosters injury report during the meeting to name 15 for the first three ODIs against England.

 Sachin needs surgery for a posterior labrum tear of the right shoulder with an associated para-labral cyst and is going to be out for approximately eight weeks. 

 Besides missing all seven ODIs versus England and the two matches against Pakistan in Abu Dhabi, next month, he wont play the five ODIs in the West Indies (May 18-28).

 Given that Sachins recovery is usually slow and he isnt getting any younger (he turns 33 in just over a month), its open to speculation whether he will even be fit for the four Tests in the West Indies, immediately after the ODIs.

 Incidentally, surgery has become necessary owing to the cysts close proximity to a major nerve. 

 The problem cropped up during Sachins comeback (after the elbow surgery) series last October, versus Sri Lanka, and the conservative treatment didnt work.

 The date for surgery hasnt been fixed, but its going to be at the earliest. The president (Sharad Pawar) and secretary (Niranjan Shah) will be back from Dubai tomorrow and the needful should be done straightaway, Pandove told The Telegraph. Even he had no idea about the injury till he began reading Glosters report.

 Owing to pain (not that it stopped him from brilliantly running out Owais Shah this afternoon), Sachins throwing has been hampered. Even his batting must have been getting affected, though Gloster feels otherwise. For the record, Sachins last 50-plus score in Tests was 11 innings ago.

 Its bad enough being conscious about the left elbow; worse when youve got to worry about the right shoulder, too.

 Unless a miracle occurs and Sachin isnt required to bat on the concluding day of the three-Test series, the morrow is going to be his last appearance for some time. Those who booed him the other day are bound to give a standing ovation.

Needing 313 to win 2-0, India were 18 for one at stumps. 

History and the numbers dont favour, but absolutely anything is possible. 

Indeed, those with a weak heart ought to stay away from the Wankhede.

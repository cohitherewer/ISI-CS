 Celeb security

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Aug. 11: Mumbai police are making arrangements to step up security for celebrities like Amitabh Bachchan, Shah Rukh Khan, Sachin Tendulkar and Mukesh Ambani.

 We have received some intelligence inputs following which we have increased their security, but we keep doing this from time to time. I would not call it unusual. The timing is such that it generates public interest. Sachin is in Bangalore and we are in touch with the local police there, said joint commissioner of police (protection) Surendra Kumar.

 Maharashtras anti-terrorist squad, however, said it was not taking any special steps other than routine security before Independence Day.

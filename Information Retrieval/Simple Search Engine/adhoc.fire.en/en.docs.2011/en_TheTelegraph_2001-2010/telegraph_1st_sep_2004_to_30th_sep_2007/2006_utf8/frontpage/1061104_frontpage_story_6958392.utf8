 Falling Hair

 OUR BUREAU

 Mumbai, Nov. 3: Unconfirmed reports tonight suggested that the International Cricket Council (ICC) would remove the controversial Darrell Hair from its elite panel of umpires.

 An ICC spokesman would only confirm 

 that the Oval Test, from which Inzamam-ul Haq-led Pakistan 

 walked out after being accused by Hair (in picture) of ball-tampering, 

 and issues related to it were discussed at the executive 

 board meeting of the council today.

 Sources said Pakistan cricket board chief Nasim Ashraf had sought a probe into Hairs conduct. ICCs Asian members wanted the Australian umpire not to be given any more matches. Put to vote, seven members were against Hair and three Australia, England and New Zealand in his favour.

 After the ICCs two-day meet that ends tomorrow, its bosses will hold a news conference and if a decision is made on Hair, it will become known then.

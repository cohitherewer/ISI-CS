 Debojit debut sizzles

 - AASU crowns singer unity ambassador

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Guwahati, April 22: As far as a debut goes, this was a dream start ? and a rollicking one at that...

 Singing sensation Debojit Sahas maiden public show in Assam, after he was crowned Voice of India, was nothing short of phenomenal.

 He floored the capital city in two hours of unadulterated entertainment at Judges Field, and in the process further cemented the bond between the Brahmaputra and Barak Valleys. His fans turned up in large numbers, both inside and outside the venue, where the organisers of the show ? the All Assam Students Union ? anointed him the ambassador of a united Northeast.

 Led by the AASU, which had pulled out all stops to put up a very successful and smooth programme, all the students unions of the Northeast ? including the North East Students Organisation ? felicitated Saha. 

 Debojit is not only the pride of Assam, he is also the ambassador of the Northeasts unity. He has shown that there exists an India beyond Calcutta, AASU adviser Samujjal Bhattacharyya observed, to thunderous applause. 

 In fact, Debojit sang a song specially composed by the AASU, that hinted at the oppression of the Northeast by Delhi. 

 Among those who took the stage were Governor Lt Gen. (retd) Ajai Singh, who congratulated Debojit on behalf of Assam. 

 He was in his elements today, singing to a thunderous ovation. Starting off with an old classic from cultural icon Bishnu Prasad Rabhas Para Janamar Subha Laganat, he belted out hit after hit ? in Hindi, Assamese and Bengali. 

 The audience went into raptures, forcing the organisers to plead with spectators from time to time to remain calm and savour the moment they had been waiting for all this while. The crowd egged him on, shouting Yalgar ho from time to time.

 Besides Debojit, singer Pulak Banerjee and wife Bandana, too, took the stage. She sang a Bengali song, promising to sing an Assamese song the next time she performs here. The memorable evening ended with the Woh lamhe lamhe number. 

 To ensure that nobody missed out on the historic occasion, entry to the venue was free. Fans started arriving at the ground from 2.30 pm. The city virtually came to a standstill with traffic snarls.

 I owe my success to the people of Assam as well as those of the Northeast. I cannot repay the debt but will continue to warm your hearts with my songs, the new music icon said, ending his show with the words Joi Aai Asom (Long Live Assam).

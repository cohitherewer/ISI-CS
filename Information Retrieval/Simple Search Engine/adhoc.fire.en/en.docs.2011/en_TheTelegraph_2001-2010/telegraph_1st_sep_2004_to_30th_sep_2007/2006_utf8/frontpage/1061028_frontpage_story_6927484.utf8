 Mohali, Oct. 27: Fast bowler Makhaya Ntini ripped through Pakistan batting today to return figures of 5 for 21 as South Africa won by 124 runs to book a place in the Champions Trophy semi-finals. 

 Pakistan folded up for 89 in 25 overs after restricting South Africa to 213 for 8 on a pitch with bounce and movement.

 Skipper Graeme Smith later said he was surprised by the wicket as even pitches prepared back home were not so lively. 

 We had to work hard to get things right and bowl in the right areas, he said. Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer described his teams batting as the worst he had seen in his two-year tenure. It was abject and disappointing.

 The batsmen were playing away from their body too much.

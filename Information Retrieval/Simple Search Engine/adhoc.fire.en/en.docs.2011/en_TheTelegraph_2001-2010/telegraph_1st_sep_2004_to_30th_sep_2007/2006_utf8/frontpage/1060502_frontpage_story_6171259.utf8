 Ulfa salvo at AGP leaders

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Guwahati, May 1: The banned Ulfa today named a crop of AGP leaders as abettors of the secret killings when the AGP was in power. The prime offender in the outfits eyes is, of course, former chief minister P.K. Mahanta.

 The latest edition of the Ulfa mouthpiece, Freedom, indicts Chandra Mohan Patowary, Pradip Hazarika, Padma Hazarika, Hitendra Nath Goswami, Phani Bhusan Choudhury and Dilip Saikia Sonowal. It claims that Ulfa leader Sashadhar Choudhurys brother would not have been killed without a signal from Patowary. It also accuses Pradip Hazarika of creating a special force to target Ulfa.

 The group said Mahantas statement before the K.N. Saikia probe panel on April 26 ? he denied knowledge of any secret killing when he was the chief minister ? as false and a feeble attempt to protect himself.

 The AGP has been trying to lay the blame for the secret killings at Mahantas door to protect its leaders who were his erstwhile ministerial colleagues.

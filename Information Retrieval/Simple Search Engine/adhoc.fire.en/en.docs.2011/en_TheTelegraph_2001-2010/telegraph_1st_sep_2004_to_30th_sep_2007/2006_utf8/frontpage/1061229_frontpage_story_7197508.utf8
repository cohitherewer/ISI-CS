 Singur, Dec. 28: A farmer in Singur, one of the first to hand over land for the Tata project, was found murdered in mysterious circumstances along with his wife in their home this morning.

 A single wire had been wound around the necks of both husband and wife, in their 50s, and the loose end stuffed into a socket on the electric switchboard. They were found lying in a room on the ground floor of their two-storeyed house at Gopalnagar (east).

 The deaths come on the heels of the murder of Tapasi Malik, who was strangled and burnt to death in an open field near her home at Bajemalia, on land acquired for the Tata Motors project. Her murder remains unsolved. 

 After a day-long probe headed by Arun Gupta, inspector-general, western range, police could not ascertain the reason behind the twin murders either. 

 The two, identified as Tinkari Dey and his wife Maya, were apparently strangled to death. Besides, we found a wound on the back of Deys head and strangulation marks on his wifes neck, Gupta said.

 It does not seem that the killings were for (monetary) gain because nothing was missing from the room. There must be some other reason.

 A few months ago, Dey had handed over his 0.33-acre plot, where they used to live six years ago, to the government in the first phase of land acquisition and collected a cheque of Rs 4.22 lakh. 

 Dey had put the money in a fixed deposit account in a local cooperative bank. Their home is about a km from the Tata project land.

 The police said the murders were detected around 11 am when labourers working in a nearby field knocked on the iron gate of the boundary wall of Deys house for drinking water. 

 The couple used to live alone as their three sons work as goldsmiths in Delhi. Even after knocking repeatedly, there was no response. They then informed us, said an officer.

 The police said the killings were deliberate and the assassins spent enough time in the house.

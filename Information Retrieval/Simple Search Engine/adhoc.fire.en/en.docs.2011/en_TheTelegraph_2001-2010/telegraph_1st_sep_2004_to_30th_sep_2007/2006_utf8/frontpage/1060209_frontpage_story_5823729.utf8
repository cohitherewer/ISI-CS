 Tapping guidelines

 New Delhi, Feb. 8: The Centre today issued a set of guidelines to all telecommunications service licensees to curb unauthorised tapping.

 Service providers must make arrangements to account for all intimations sent by security and law enforcement agencies. They also need to issue acknowledgement letters for each intimation within two hours to the agency concerned in a sealed cover.

 The guidelines, which come in the wake of the Amar Singh phone tapping case, call for appointment of nodal officers by law enforcement and security agencies and service providers.

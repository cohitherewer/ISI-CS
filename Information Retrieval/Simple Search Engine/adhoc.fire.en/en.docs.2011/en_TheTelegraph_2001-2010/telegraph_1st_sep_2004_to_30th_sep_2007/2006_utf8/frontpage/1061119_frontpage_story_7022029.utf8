 Happy ending but holes too many

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 18: Holes have appeared in the original police version of Anant Guptas return in an autorickshaw, with officers today admitting it was the kidnappers who had sent the three-year-old home.

 Yesterday, the police had claimed they themselves had put Adobe India CEO Naresh Guptas son in the three-wheeler and followed it to his home, without explaining how they had found the child.

 Today, S.N. Bhagat of Uttar Pradesh polices special task force admitted grudgingly: Yes, the kidnappers put the boy in the autorickshaw.

 The senior superintendent, however, insisted that the police had tailed the autorickshaw till it reached the Gupta home in Noida around 12.15 am on Friday.

 The admission came after the autorickshaw 

 driver told reporters in Delhi that the man who asked him 

 to drive Anant home was not from the police.

 He was a young man. He gave me Rs 50, Bhupinder Singh said after being released from detention by the police.

 He said he had been approached near a market in Sarita Vihar, south Delhi, and asked to drop Anant at the address given on his school badge. 

 The Gupta family paid him Rs 1,000.

 Naresh said the police at least the STF knew that ransom had been paid. A sum of Rs 50 lakh was seized from a house in Kakod near Bulandshahr in a raid after Anant had returned home. Officers and Naresh now claim the money was paid as insurance to the gang whom the police were sure of nabbing.

 The police had to backtrack also on the number of arrests. Yesterday, they had said two men, Chatrapal and Pawan, had been arrested and a hunt was on for Jeetendra and Chauhan. Today, only one man was produced in court and his name was given as Jeetendra. He has been sent to 14 days police custody.

 The police have found the kidnappers motorbike DL 4S AY 9267 from Pawans home at Ashok Vihar.

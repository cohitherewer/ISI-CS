 Malaria death cloud

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bokaro, Oct. 18: The mosquito sting threat has apparently overshadowed the fear of Naxalites in Nawadih block.

 Malaria scare has intensified in the block with the death of six persons, including three women and a child, within 10 days. At least 12 others are suspected to be suffering from malaria in the area. 

 A team of doctors has been rushed to the area to assess the situation and collect blood samples from the ailing persons admitted to health centres. The deputy commissioner has instructed Nawadih block development officer Moti George Lakra to rush to the villages and take necessary action.

 The team of doctors was pressed into service after the residents of Banchi village wrote to deputy commissioner Amrendra Pratap Singh and Bokaro civil surgeon P.N. Pandey about the death of six persons.

 Even as the villagers are certain that the six died of malaria, the district administration is still in a dilemma if malaria had spread wings in the area. 

 The residents of the Naxalite-affected block blamed the officials. According to the villagers, who wrote to the deputy commissioner, the health department officials stayed away from the area fearing Naxalite attacks. Thus, bleaching powder or DDT was not sprayed in wells, ponds, rivulets and other stagnant water bodies. This dereliction of duty, alleged the villagers, caused malaria.

 Pandey told The Telegraph that he was not certain if malaria had spread in the area and the six persons had succumbed to the disease. The health department has sprung into action and is taking necessary steps to ensure that the disease does not spread, he said. 

 It is yet to be confirmed if malaria was the cause of the deaths. But the health department is taking no chances and has sent hundreds of medicated mosquito nets and medicines to the area for distribution among the villagers. Besides, DDT or bleaching power is being sprinkled in stagnant waters bodies to prevent the spread of the disease, said the civil surgeon.

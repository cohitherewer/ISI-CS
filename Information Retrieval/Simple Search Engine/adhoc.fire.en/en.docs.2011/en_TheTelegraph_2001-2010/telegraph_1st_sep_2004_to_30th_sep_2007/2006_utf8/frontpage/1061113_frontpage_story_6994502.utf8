 Mumbai, Nov. 12: A group of allegedly drunk youths in a Toyota Corolla ran over and killed two children and five others sleeping on the side of a road early this morning.

 The dead belonged to a group of 16 people, all sleeping together, who had come from a southern state to work here as daily wage labourers.

 Alistair Pareira, 21, was behind the wheel of the car, returning apparently from a party in a five-star hotel. Five others were with him in the car. All, except one whos a teenager, are in their twenties.

 All the passengers in the car were completely drunk. According to the information we have, they were returning from a five-star hotel in the area. We also found a bottle of liquor in the car, said V.K. Chaubey, deputy commissioner of police, Zone 9, Bandra.

 Pareira in police custody

 The police arrested engineering student Alistair, who was driving his fathers car, and two others at the spot while the other three, including a girl, Ronalda Gilbert (20), fled and were picked up later. 

 Pareira was booked under Section 304 of the IPC for culpable homicide not amounting to murder. The others were charged under the Bombay Prohibition Act as all of them were drunk, the police said.

 The incident, between 3.30 and 3.45 am, took place in the posh suburb of Bandra less than 500 metres from the place where actor Salman Khan had driven his Landcruiser over people sleeping on the pavement outside a bakery four years ago.

 Those killed today were part of the group of labourers working for a contractor repairing the road that leads to the homes of Rajesh Khanna and John Abraham as well as a property Abhishek Bachchan has newly acquired.

 Six died on the spot, two of them children Savita Timanna, 5, and Devu Basappa, 8. One died on the way to hospital. Nine more are in hospital, four with serious injuries.

 The incident is the latest in a series of accidents where affluent, inebriated drivers have mauled people sleeping on Mumbais pavements.

 In August 2005, Manish Khatau, the scion of a business house, ran over a policeman on duty. A top official of Standard Chartered Bank, Neel Chatterjee, hit a pavement dweller while returning from a party early this year.

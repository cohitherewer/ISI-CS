 Rahul short remand

 MANAN KUMAR

 New Delhi, June 6: Delhi police were handed custody of Rahul Mahajan for only two days after they failed to specify in court the quantity and nature of drugs he had consumed or distributed.

 The son of the late BJP leader, Pramod Mahajan, was arrested last evening under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act under which it is possible to secure month-long custody.

 Delhi police stand on a weak wicket because despite being asked repeatedly by the judge, they failed to utter anything about the quantity and the nature of the drug, defence counsel Sunil Mittal said, confident he would get bail for Rahul on Thursday.

The quantity is important because it could make the 

difference between being let off with a fine and being sent to jail for years. 

 The police, who had sought a five-day remand, told metropolitan magistrate A.K. Chaturvedi that Rahul had admitted to having consumed drugs and giving it to others, which amounts to distribution.

 It is possible that the state of Rahuls health prompted the judge to limit the custody to two days. Discharged this afternoon from Apollo Hospital ? where he was rushed in an unconscious state early on Friday morning along with his fathers secretary Bibek Moitra ? Rahul will face interrogation till the judge decides on Thursday whether to extend the police remand. 

 Police sources said they had established through the interrogation of Sahil Zaroo, who was present at Thursday nights party at Rahuls house and is said to have bought the drugs, his three acquaintances who were also present, drug peddler Abdullah and Mahajans servants that Rahul possessed and consumed drugs and that Bibek died of drug overdose on his premises. 

 We have established that all three (Rahul, Bibek and Sahil) had consumed drugs, said Manish Agarwal, the additional deputy commissioner of police handling the case. 

 A government lab report has established that the white powder tested was heroin. Heroin was found in Rahuls blood and Sahils vomit, PTI said.

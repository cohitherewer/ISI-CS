 Rang De goes to Oscars

 Mumbai, Sept. 25: A film on college graduates turning rebels has edged out a superhero and a reformed gangster to earn a ticket to the Oscars.

 Rang De Basanti (poster

 blockbuster starring Aamir Khan, will be Indias entry 

 in the Best Foreign Film category.

 Film Federation of India member Suparn Sen, who announced the choice, said seven other films, including Lage Raho Munnabhai, Krrish and Omkara, were in the race.

 It was a tough call. Rang De Basanti stood out for its cinematic quality, its script. Now let us see what they (Oscar judges) think, said the chairman of the jury and film-maker, Basu Chatterjee.

 Rang De grossed Rs 6.25 crore from the US, UK, Australia and the Gulf in its opening weekend.

 Many have been asking why Indian film-makers, despite serial disappointments on awards night, should crave the Oscars instead of taking their box-office success overseas as the most significant stamp on their films quality.

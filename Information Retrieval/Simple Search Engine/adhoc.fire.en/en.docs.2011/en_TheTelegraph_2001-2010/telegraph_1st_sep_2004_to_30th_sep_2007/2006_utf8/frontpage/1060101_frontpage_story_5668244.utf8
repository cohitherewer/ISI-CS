 Purulia Maoist carnage

 OUR BUREAU

 Purulia/Calcutta, Dec. 31: A group of about 50 Maoists burnt alive a CPM district secretariat member and his wife today in Purulias Bandwan after caging up 30 policemen inside their camp 2 km away by planting three landmines in front of it.

 Rabindranath Kar, 62, and Anandamoyee died screaming for help inside their home at Bhomragarh village, 360 km from Calcutta, as the guerrillas, who included at least one woman, set fire to the house and stood guard outside.

 The rebels left behind posters saying this was revenge for the Chhoto Angaria massacre in West Midnapores Garbeta, in which 11 persons were allegedly killed by CPM cadres in January 2001.

 The Naxalites had reached the village around 2.30 am, an hour after corralling off the police, who fired a few shots but didnt step out of the camp for fear of the mines. The villagers were woken up by a shouted warning: nobody should step out of home.

 The raiders then went in search of Kars two security guards, who spent the night in a club away from the man they were to protect, and overpowered them. Kar was known to be on the Naxalite hit list.

 They hustled Kars 82-year-old mother, daughter and granddaughter out, siphoned off petrol from Kars motorcycle and got some kerosene from a nearby dealers shop. In minutes, the house was on fire.

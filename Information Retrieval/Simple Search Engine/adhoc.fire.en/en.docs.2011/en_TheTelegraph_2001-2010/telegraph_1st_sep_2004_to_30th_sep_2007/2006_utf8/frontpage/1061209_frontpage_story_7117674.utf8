 New Delhi, Dec. 8: India today welcomed the US legislation but said some of its provisions were extraneous and prescriptive. 

 India, however, is prepared to overlook these clauses, saying legislation enacted in a foreign country cannot take away its sovereign right to conduct foreign policy. 

 The reference is to provisions like getting India to declare when it will stop production of fissile material, or the US President requiring to report on the quantum of uranium mined by India.

 India said it would only respect the commitments it will make in the bilateral (123) agreement with the US.

 Jain holy place hit by blast

 SHAHNAWAZ AKHTAR

 Madhuban (Giridih), Oct. 31: A bomb blast by the suspected CPI(Maoist) here on Monday night damaged a building, adjacent to which BSF jawans were lodged. 

 Two 20-kg bombs, planted in the building housing the paramilitary personnel, were found and defused. 

 The explosives were planted in the buildings of Kalyan Niketan, a place of religious importance for the Digambar sect of the Jains. The holy place is located just outside Madhuban village. 

 The rebels apparently were not targeting Kalyan Niketan but were aiming to hit the paramilitary forces, CRPF and BSF jawans. 

 The Maoists wanted to blow up the building in which the BSF jawans are lodged, said a source at the Pirtand police station. But after the blast, the jawans came out and noticed a wire going to the building housing the BSF personnel. They immediately cut the wire.

 The blast was strong enough, though no human casualties were reported. Some villagers of Harladih, two km from the site of the blast, reported hearing the explosion.

 Kalyan Niketan, spread over 50 acres, was a camp for the paramilitary forces until October 10. But in view of the Koderma byelection, two companies of paramilitary forces have been staying here since October 26.

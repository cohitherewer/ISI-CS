 MPs daughter in suicide bid

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta, Oct. 18: Congress MP Adhir Chowdhurys daughter Shreyashi attempted suicide by jumping off the roof of a six-storeyed apartment house at Gol Park in south Calcutta this afternoon. 

 The 18-year-old (in picture), the only child of Adhir and Arpita, suffered severe injuries and multiple fractures and is on ventilator at a private hospital. Her condition was said to be critical.

 Around 4 pm, she jumped from the roof of the apartment where she lived with two domestic helps, said Sukumar Chakraborty, the officer-in-charge of Lake police station. 

 She has been staying on the top floor for the past one year and her parents visit her frequently, said a police official. 

 Adhir, who rushed to the city from Behrampore about 200 km from Calcutta with his wife, took ill on reaching the hospital and was admitted with breathing problems.

 A police official said he had learnt that Shreyashi, a Class XII student who had recently started taking modelling lessons, had a heated argument on the phone with a family member last night. 

 Witnesses said Shreyashi fell on the bonnet of a car, parked in front of 28A Gariahat Road. She was taken to the hospital by the security personnel of the jewellery shop on the ground floor of the building in the car on which she fell, Chakraborty said. 

 There are several fractures in her face, including the jaws and orbital bone (the bone supporting the eyeball). Her two upper arms and left foot have been fractured, said an official of AMRI, where she is admitted. 

 Although there was no cerebral haemorrhage, CT Scan and X-ray revealed collection of fluid under the bone covering the skull. There is also fluid in the chest and external injuries have been found on the spine, the official said.

 Police officials said Shreyashi had enrolled in a leading grooming school for a six-month course on acting, modelling and dance. 

 A school official described her as a bright student.... She is a fun-loving girl and very popular.

 Chakraborty called the MP to convey the tragic news. We are not sure why she did it, an officer said.

 Apparently, her parents were not happy with her taking up the modelling course. She told her friends that her parents were putting pressure on her, said the police, who were speaking to some of her friends.

 Adhir has had an eventful career, 

 having spent time in jail last November on a murder charge. 

 Arpita was also wanted in the murders of a father-son duo.

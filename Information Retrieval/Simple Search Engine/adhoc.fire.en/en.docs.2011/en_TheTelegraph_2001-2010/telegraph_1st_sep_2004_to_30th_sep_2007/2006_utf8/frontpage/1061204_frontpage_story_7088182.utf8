 Patna college teacher killed

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, Dec. 3: A senior teacher of Patna Womens College and her domestic help were found murdered in the Patliputra Colony locality of the Bihar capital today.

 Papiya Ghosh, who was a professor in the colleges postgraduate history department, and her help Malti Devi were found lying in a pool of blood when another maid, who used to work in a neighbouring house, came to Ghoshs residence for chores.

 Senior superintendent of police Kundan Krishnan told The Telegraph that no signs of forced entry were found at the spot and somebody known to the unmarried professor seemed to be part of the group that entered the house late last night.

 Robbery appears to be the motive because electronic gadgets like a television, computer, music system and jewellery are missing. The intruders drove away in a Maruti Alto that was parked at the house, Krishnan said.

 The wounds the two women bore on their bodies suggested that they were stabbed to death. 

 The second maid used to come to the professors house every morning to clean utensils. When she rang the bell today, no one responded. She then informed the neighbours, who found the two women lying in a pool of blood, the police official said.

 Ghosh was in her early 50s and a known figure in academic circles. Her maid Malti Devi was an elderly woman.

 Krishnan, who is supervising the investigation, said the intruders made use of the night cover and relative isolation of the house.

 Ghosh was the daughter of U.K. Ghosh, a former home secretary of Bihar. Her sister Tuktuk Ghosh is a Bengal cadre IAS officer. Her body was cremated after post-mortem. 

 Patna University teachers will proceed on a mass casual leave tomorrow and observe a silent protest against the murder. They have sought an appointment with the governor and demanded a CBI probe into the murder. Leader of Opposition Rabri Devi, while demanding a CBI probe, said women were no longer safe in Bihar.

 Meanwhile, police today found the charred bodies of an elderly couple from their house in Sasaram, the headquarters of Rohtas district.

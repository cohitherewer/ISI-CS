 Town that courts celebs

 - From Ravi to Rai, Indores petition brigade spares none 

 RASHEED KIDWAI 

 Shastri, Aishwarya, 

 Husain, Kulkarni: Court connection 

 Indore, Dec. 28: If you are a celebrity, chances are you will meet your day of judgment in Indore.

 Madhya Pradeshs commercial capital is fast earning a reputation of being the nations conscience-keeper. Ask Ravi Shastri, Aishwarya Rai, Dharmendra, M.F. Husain and Mamta Kulkarni, and theyll tell you why. All of them have cases pending against them in one, or more, of the towns musty courts.

 Last week, Shastri literally got a taste of the town. Why? Because Manoj Malpani heard him confess on TV that he relishes biltong, a dish made from dried beef. 

 In no time, Malpanis lawyer, Rajendra Sharma, was before judicial magistrate R.K. Batham, seeking action under Sections 295A and 298A of the IPC against the cricketer-turned-TV commentator incidentally, also a Brahmin for hurting religious sentiments. The court will hear the case again on January 5. 

 Early this month, Shailendra Dwivedi, an Indore lawyer, moved a public interest litigation against Aishwarya and Hrithik Roshan for locking lips in Dhoom-2. This case was also filed in Bathams court under Sections 292 (vulgarity) and 509 (derogatory to women) of the IPC. 

 Ash and Hrithik are portraying 

 vulgarity in our culture. I went to see the film with my 

 child and it was quite embarrassing. The least they could 

 have done was certify this as an adult film. This is not 

 right according to our culture.

 An unfazed Hrithik asserts theres nothing wrong. Asked about Dwivedi, he said in an interview: Hes a lawyer sitting in his office and enjoying every bit of the limelight. I believe hes excited about a TV camera in his office. Its like a burst of glory in his life.. 

 Some in Indore also consider Dwivedi a publicity monger. Ram Naresh Aggarwal, a trader at Sarafa Bazaar, recalls that the lawyer had filed a case against director J.P. Dutta after the Tricolour was shown wrongly draped on the coffins of soldiers in LoC Kargil. Dwivedi is also among the petitioners who sued M.F. Husain for drawing Hindu goddesses in the nude.

 In 2004, Dharmendra had a brush with Indores itch for a courtroom bout as a BJP candidate in the Lok Sabha elections from Bikaner. Indores legal eagles clawed him with allegations that hed concealed information about a change of name and religion in his marriage to Hema Malini. The case, filed by local Congress leaders, was dismissed, but not before it had given the actor sleepless nights.

 Another Congress leader, Akhtar Baig, had allegedly offered lakhs to anyone who could chop off Husains hands. Baig was also instrumental in getting an arrest warrant against him for allegedly painting a nude Bharat Mata. Husain went to school in Indore. 

 Actress Mamta Kulkarni also grabbed the attention and long-drawn cases lavished by Indores lawyers for exposing too much skin on the cover of a film magazine.

 So, whats the secret behind Indores love affair with courts? Virendra Pal Singh, a psychiatrist with a local hospital, says beyond the temptation to derive personal mileage, one must look at Indores profile. The city is in a transitory phase, from a traditional to a metropolitan culture. Some enlightened citizens cant stomach cultural changes taking place in films and sports.

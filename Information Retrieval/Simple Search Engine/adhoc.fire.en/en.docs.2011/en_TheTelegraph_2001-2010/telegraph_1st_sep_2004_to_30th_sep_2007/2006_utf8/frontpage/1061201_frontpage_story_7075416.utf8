 Aye to painless Muslim pills 

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 New Delhi, Nov. 30: The Indian Muslim feels insecure, discriminated against and deprived, a panel set up by the Prime Minister has concluded.

 The Justice Rajinder Sachar committee report, tabled today in Parliament, paints a dismal picture of the community on almost every facet of life, ranging from education, jobs politics and choice of residence. 

 The committee has come up with a slew of recommendations for inclusive development and mainstreaming the community, but has steered clear of sensitive issues such as religious reservation.

 The 404-page report does have one recommendation that could fuel controversy de-reserving scheduled caste parliamentary and Assembly constituencies with a high Muslim population.

 The committee has suggested that students with certificates/degrees from madarsas should be eligible to compete in joint entrance exams for professional courses and public service examinations. But the panel has added that the current framework of these exams possibly a reference to quotas should not be disturbed.

 Government sources said several recommendations of the committee could be implemented but not all.

 The actionable suggestions mostly non-controversial picked by the sources follow: 

 A national data bank for 

 socio-religious groups to assess whether welfare programmes 

 are working

 A legal mechanism to look 

 into complaints of bias

 An equal opportunity commission 

 with statutory powers

 Higher UGC aid to institutions 

 to promote diversity

 Use urban renewal funds 

 for public spaces for Muslim children

 School texts to reflect 

 diversity and promote tolerance

 Good government schools 

 in Muslim-majority areas and exclusive schools for girls

 Reorient skill development 

 initiatives in ITIs

 Ensure affordable hostels

 Financial support to initiatives 

 built around occupations practised by Muslims

 The unrealisable 

 proposals are:

 Nomination procedure to increase Muslim participation at the grassroots, ensure minority representation in local bodies and not reserve constituencies with a high Muslim concentration for the scheduled castes.

 Interventions to support 

 Urdu

 Mainstreaming 

 madarsa education 

 A social security system 

 for self-employed Muslims

 A more transparent recruitment 

 system in the public and private sectors

 Increase the share of 

 Muslims in areas that require public interaction, such as 

 health workers, bank employees and teachers 

 Post one inspector/sub-inspector 

 in Muslim majority areas.

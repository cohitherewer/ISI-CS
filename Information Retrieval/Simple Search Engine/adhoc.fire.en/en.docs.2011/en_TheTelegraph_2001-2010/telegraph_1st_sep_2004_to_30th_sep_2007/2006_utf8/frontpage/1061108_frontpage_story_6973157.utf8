 N-E fest in Durban

 Durban, Nov. 7 (PTI): The South African capital is gearing up for a fortnightlong Indian experience with a distinct northeastern flavour. Beginning Thursday, the fest will showcase the diverse cultural heritage, cuisine, fashion and films of the region.

 Dancers, artisans, fashion designers and chefs from Assam and Manipur will take part in the festival that will be launched by a film festival.

 The objective of this exercise is to showcase, among other things, the best of this unique region, while at the same time broadening the understanding of India in South Africa, Indian consul general Harsh Shringla said at a press conference here.

 Shringla said the event was being organised with support from the Indian government. Some organisations in the two countries had also extended co-operation, he said.

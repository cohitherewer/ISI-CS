 Maoist raid near border 

 Kathmandu, March 6: Hundreds of Maoist rebels raided Ilam, a town near the Indian border in north Bengal, bombing government buildings and freeing prisoners from a local jail, officials said today.

 At least eight people ? three Maoists, two civilians, two policemen and a soldier ?were killed in the overnight attack in Ilam, about 600 km east of Kathmandu, they said.

 The guerrillas drove into Ilam in buses and trucks, attacking government buildings and shooting at security posts, residents said. 

 In Bengal, about 48 hours after 

 two CPM members were killed in Bankura and West Midnapore, 

 the party has advised its leaders not to campaign in Maoist 

 territory after sundown.

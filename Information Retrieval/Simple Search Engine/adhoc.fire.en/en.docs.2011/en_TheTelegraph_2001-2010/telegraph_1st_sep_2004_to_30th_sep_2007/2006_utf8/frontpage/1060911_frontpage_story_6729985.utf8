The Telegraph - Calcutta : Frontpage

 First the sound, 

 then strange odour

 - It must be a truck hitting a container in Manhattan. It 

 wasnt. It was a plane 

 Anthony Joseph Pallivathuckal was 

 born in Kerala. He worked as an insurance regulator for the 

 New York state government at the time of the tragedy.

 The strike 

 Five years ago on this day 

 the world saw the biggest terrorist attack of all on New 

 Yorks World Trade Center. Lubica Hauswaldova recalls 

 the story of an Indian American survivor

 The day started like any other: 

 Anthony Joseph Pallivathuckal got off at 8.30 at the Bowling 

 Green station near the New York Stock Exchange. 

 His office was on Beaver Street, 

 one block from the exchange and almost in the shadow of 

 the World Trade Center. Reaching his office as was his wont 

 by 8.45, he did the routine things: switched on the computer, 

 went to the washroom.

 Suddenly he heard the sound of 

 a collision. Something like a very powerful thaaak. 

 He calmed down and dismissed it as one of the many dumpster 

 trucks hitting one of those big containers along the streets 

 of Manhattan. That happens.

 Then Anthony noticed something 

 unusual: only about 1 in 10 of his colleagues had come in. 

 Usually about 75 per cent of them were in by that time. 

 Where are they all? he asked himself. At the 

 same time he smelt a strange odour... 

 Somebody shouted that an airplane 

 had hit the World Trade Center. Everyone in Anthonys 

 office rushed downstairs. They saw the unbelievable: the 

 top of the northern tower was in flames. What a horrible 

 accident! Police cars were rushing up and down, urging office 

 workers to return to their buildings and not hinder relief 

 operations. 

 Anthonys phone started ringing. 

 A desperate friend whose wife worked in the Twin Towers 

 was calling: Please, can you find out whether Razia 

 Kutty is all right? I cant reach her.

 Achamma, Anthonys wife, 

 called with the same plea: Go and find her. 

 He had hardly put down the phone when he heard another hit. 

 All his colleagues stiffened and he could read in their 

 terrified faces: The first plane was no accident! 

 This is something much worse.

 Suddenly, policemen swarmed into 

 Anthonys office. They instructed everyone to leave 

 the building immediately. Anthony grabbed his briefcase 

 and emergency medicines. The lifts did not work. A stream 

 of men and women was rolling down the stairs.

 Thirty floors. He ran with his 

 friend Alex, also an Indian American, and another co-worker. 

 Crowds carried them to a subway train station but Anthony 

 resisted. 

 He was caught up in the 1993 terrorist 

 bombing of the World Trade Center, too. Then they had to 

 remain underground for long hours. Therefore, he insisted 

 on taking the ferry to Staten Island across the bay. As 

 far away as possible!

 The look of the skyscrapers in 

 flames was urging them on. But by the time they reached 

 the ferry, it had stopped sailing. In the shadows of the 

 burning Twin Towers, they tried to return to the subway. 

 Policemen and firefighters rushed into the buildings.

 There was already so much smoke 

 underground that people started to suffocate. In panic they 

 rushed to exits, helter-skelter, terrorised by the unknown. 

 Anthony lost one of his colleagues and stayed just with 

 Alex. And then they saw it: the whole south tower began 

 collapsing. 

 It stood firm for just 44 minutes 

 since it was hit. Anthony was watching as the building slowly 

 crumbled, debris flying around

 like bizarre fireworks. There 

 was a lot of smoke, dust and sticky microscopic droplets 

 in the air. Some people were crying, others were running 

 up and down. The dust was everywhere. It transformed their 

 faces into grotesque theatre masks. Their clothes had taken 

 on a greyish hue. 

 Anthony could barely breathe. 

 He was glad to have a big Indian handkerchief people in 

 the US mostly use paper tissues which he tied around his 

 mouth and nose. 

 After a while they saw a bus on 

 the street. They ran into it in search of some protection 

 against the enveloping smoke and dust. The driver was weeping. 

 He tried to move the vehicle but the street was full of 

 running people. Some women in the back of the vehicle were 

 weeping. Suddenly everybody looked up: at 10.28 the northern 

 tower too started collapsing.

 It had been bright and sunny but 

 the dust created a dense, dark and sticky fog. Anthony realised 

 the all-enveloping matter was a mixture of buildings, airplanes, 

 jet fuel and human flesh. 

 The bus started to move slowly 

 along crowded streets. Anthony tried to call his wife and 

 children. But mobile connections did not work.

 The bus stopped on 14th street 

 and would go no further. Anthony and Alex waded through 

 dark smoke. Approaching East River, they entered a cafe 

 to wash their faces. Its Chinese owner started to scream 

 hysterically to prevent them from entering the place. She 

 didnt want such dirty guests.

 In contrast, at a shoe shop, the 

 shopkeeper was handing out sneakers and comfortable sport 

 shoes to women stumbling in high heels and men in elegant 

 dress shoes. Free! 

 Somewhere there Anthony found 

 a phone booth. Finally he could call Achamma to tell her 

 he was alive. She was in her office watching the whole horror 

 on TV with fellow workers and shivering in fear.

 On 43rd Street next to the UN 

 building a person in the crowd with a radio started crying 

 that some airplanes were nearing New York to attack the 

 UN headquarters. The crowd started a mad run again towards 

 the Queensboro Bridge. It was between 1 and 2 pm, completely 

 dark and nobody knew for sure what was happening.

 Low-flying airplanes hove into 

 view over the river. People on the bridge were falling down 

 in terror, lying flat on their stomachs, covering their 

 heads with their arms. 

 Only then somebody recognised 

 the planes and shouted: Those are ours! Those are 

 F16s!

 It took several hours to cross 

 the river and Queens. Some buses and trains were working. 

 Anthony and Alex somehow reached Alexs home. The children 

 started crying, seeing them. 

 Anthony Joseph lived the tragedy 

 many more days through the pain of others. Razia, whom he 

 was to look for that morning, had not reached the Twin Towers. 

 When she exited the subway, she saw a horrifying scene: 

 Some of those who could not get out of the buildings that 

 were an inferno jumped in desperation from the windows of 

 the skyscrapers. Some bodies fell near her. She could not 

 speak for several days.

 Even the church was a scene of 

 tragedy. Every day brought funerals of some of the firefighters 

 fallen in the Twin Towers. Many of them were Irish and members 

 of the same Catholic church like the Pallivathuckal family. 

 For some two weeks he could not read the papers or watch 

 TV. He stopped working at the Manhattan office. Whenever 

 he went there he felt unwell and his breathing problems 

 grew worse. Some colleagues fell sick, too. Even today he 

 avoids going to the place where the World Trade Center once 

 stood.

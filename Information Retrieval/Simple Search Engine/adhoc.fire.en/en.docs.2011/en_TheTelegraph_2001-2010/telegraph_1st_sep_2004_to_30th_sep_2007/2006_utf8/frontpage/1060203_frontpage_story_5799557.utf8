 Buddha drops business names

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Feb. 2: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today reeled off project after project before a business gathering at a Ficci meeting, telling it that the ABC ? rather, the AMRS ? of Indian industry had decided to invest in Bengal. 

 Anil is coming on the 15th to sign an MoU. Mukesh is looking for 20,000 acres of land. Ratan Tata and Hindujas will set up their automotive plants, he said.

 A for Anil, M for Mukesh, R for Ratan ? the chief minister was dropping first names ? and S for Sanjiv. Goenka, that is. He is setting up a business school. The Hindujas are NRIs and cant count among the AMRS of Indian industry.

 After checking with government officials, it came to light, however, that Anil Ambanis appointment had been fixed for February 10, and not 15. 

 If Mukesh Ambani has sought 20,000 acres ? four times the area being given to the Indonesian Salim group ? bureaucrats were not aware of it.

 Speaking about land sizes starting with a 2, they said Anils Dhirubhai Ambani Institute for Information and Communications Technology was expected to come up on 200 acres at Haringhata in Nadia.

 Talks have been held with Mukesh on a biotech park, but that is all that the babus know. The chief minister would be knowing better.

 But even he clarified later that Tata Motors would decide by the end of the month and the Hinduja proposal was almost final.

 In any case, a chief minister cant be expected to remember all minor details. Or, in his eagerness to show results, Bhattacharjee may have spoken too fast. Mamata Banerjee would, of course, say he is making tall claims before polls.

 He also spoke of a shopping mall exclusively for foreign goods off the Bypass by an Indonesian company. Official sources said an Indonesian retail chain called Mitra Adi Parkasa had made a proposal for a retail facility.

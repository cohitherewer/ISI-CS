The Telegraph - Calcutta : Frontpage

 P-list Sourav down, with fever

 - Ex-captain silent on selection among 30 probables

 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Sourav: No comments

Calcutta, Aug.10: Back in the reckoning after 

six months, potentially a career-ending break for somebody in his 35th year, one 

expected Sourav Ganguly to be buoyant.

 Yet, the morning after, the former Team India captains tone was anything but upbeat.

 Ive been having fever from yesterday, Sourav explained, when The Telegraph got through to one of his cellphones around lunch.

 He didnt take calls last evening and both phones had been off throughout this morning. 

 Surely, though, having made the Champions Trophy probables list must be making him feel better?

 I dont have a comment, was Souravs response. He quickly (and somewhat more firmly) added: In fact, I dont wish to say anything on featuring in the 30

 (Predictably, captain Rahul Dravid and coach Greg Chappell also declined to comment in Bangalore, before departing for the August 14-29 tri-series in Sri Lanka.)

 Any particular reason why?

 No, I just dont want to react, Sourav said, indicating he would prefer to speak about other things. 

 He did, briefly.

 Had circumstances been different, Sourav would probably have talked at some length about the latest Himesh Reshammiya chartbuster or Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna promising to be the centurys biggest grosser. 

 Cricket apart, Hindi films and songs are a passion with Sourav. But, then, he wasnt well today.

 According to somebody close to the 10,000-plus ODI runs club member, being a probable cannot be reason enough to rejoice.

 More important is what lies ahead. 

 Apparently, Sourav doesnt see the day-old developments as actually giving him a toe-hold on the Team India bus. 

 Moreover, he has been bracketed with rookies Tejinder Pal Singh, Rohit Sharma and Subramaniam Badrinath.

 Then, if the confidant hasnt got it mixed up, Sourav is very bitter that he got pilloried for an email which tore into Jagmohan Dalmiya a fortnight ago, but nobody showed the same zeal in probing how Chappells email (which painted him in awful colours) was leaked 11 months ago.

 That communication had been sent to the Board of Control for Cricket in India brass.

 Another reason for Sourav not being buoyant could be the realisation that his image has taken a beating after getting involved in the highly politicised Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) elections.

 For somebody used to God-like treatment, it may take some time to adjust to the (for now, at least) changed ground realities. 

 Footnote: Sourav hasnt spoken about the CAB since returning from Northampton almost a week ago. He has reasons, but a one-on-one with Dalmiya cant be ruled out in the near future. The invitation, however, will have to come from the one-time mentor.

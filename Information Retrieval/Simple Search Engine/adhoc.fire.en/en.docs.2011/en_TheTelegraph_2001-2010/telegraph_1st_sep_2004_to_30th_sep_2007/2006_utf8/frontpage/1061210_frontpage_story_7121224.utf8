Calcutta, Dec. 9: Mamata Banerjee, who has turned down the chief ministers request to call off her indefinite fast, urged the people to join a mass hunger strike tomorrow and a dharna on Monday.

 I appeal to all to take part in tomorrows mass hunger strike. We welcome all as the programme is being organised to lodge a symbolic protest against the governments move to evict farmers and hand over land to the Tatas, Mamata said.

 The mass hunger strike will be held from 10 am to 8 pm. 

 On Monday, she has invited people from all walks of life to assemble at her Esplanade dharna manch at 1 pm to express solidarity with the Trinamul Congress.

 Monday is also when CPM state secretary Biman Bose and party politburo member Sitaram Yechury are scheduled to address a gathering of the SFI at Rani Rashmoni Road at 1.30 pm. The rallies are likely to paralyse city traffic.

 Esplanade will turn into a sea of humanity after 11 am on Monday. The government will be responsible if there is any untoward incident, said Trinamul MP Mukul Roy. 

 Mamata, whose fast entered the sixth day, complained that Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee was yet to reply to her letter.

 Asked about the Singur land acquisition, Bhattacharjee, who was in Delhi, said: Let them (the Opposition) protest, we will go ahead.

 Social activist Medha Patkar, who was stopped near the American Center when she was marching with other protesters, met Mamata and said she was leaving for Delhi. She has promised to return, saying Singur is part of Action 2007, her agenda for next year.

 Textile scion charged with rape

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, March 12: A 26-year-old youth from a textile business family has been charged with raping a 52-year-old woman.

 Abhishek Kasliwal was arrested after the woman filed a complaint at Worli police station, alleging repeated rape on Saturday morning.

 According to the complaint, the woman was waiting at the Prince of Wales Museum at Colaba in south Mumbai when a dark green Mercedes, which Abhishek was driving, drew up before her, the officer in charge at Worli police station said.

 In the complaint, the woman has alleged that Abhishek asked her where she wanted to go and offered to give her a lift. 

 She told him that she wanted to be dropped at Mumbai Central station, but Abhishek drove the car into the compound of Shriram Mills, which the Kasliwal family owns, in Worli.

 There he raped her more than once in his car, the complaint said. The incident occurred sometime after 2.30 am.

 After allegedly raping her, Abhishek dropped her back in the Colaba area from where he had picked her up.

 Medical tests done on the woman proved sexual assault. The police took Abhishek for medical examination this evening. The result will be known tomorrow.

 Mumbai police commissioner Anami Roy said: We have done medical examination and a formal report is awaited. The arrest was made after evidence indicating sexual assault.

 Abhisheks father, Ambuj Kasliwal, said in a statement: My son is innocent. We will cooperate fully with the police.

 The police said Abhishek was alone in the car (MH01 R604), which they have seized. They said Abhishek and the woman did not know each other from before. 

 A PTI report said quoting sources that when the accused was arrested he gave his name as Vicky Malhotra, which turned out to be false.

 Sources close to the family said Abhishek was driving along Colaba when the woman appeared in front of the car. The Mercedes hit her but it was nothing serious.

 She allegedly demanded Rs 20,000 and Abhishek took her into the car thinking he would settle the matter. When he realised he was not carrying that kind of money, he dropped her back at Colaba. 

 Abhishek will be produced in court tomorrow.

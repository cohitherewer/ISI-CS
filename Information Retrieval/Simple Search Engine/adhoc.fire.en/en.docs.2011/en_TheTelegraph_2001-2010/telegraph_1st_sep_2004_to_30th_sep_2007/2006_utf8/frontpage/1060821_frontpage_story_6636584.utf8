 Vaccine for children without trials

 G.S. MUDUR

 New Delhi, Aug. 20: The 

 health ministry breached standard procedures and immunised 

 nearly nine million children in four states with a Chinese-made 

 vaccine against Japanese encephalitis (JE) without human 

 safety studies of the vaccine in India.

 Contrary to claims by health officials 

 that a consensus had emerged to immunise children with the 

 vaccine before the monsoon, top medical scientists had questioned 

 the wisdom of rushing into mass immunisation without local 

 safety and efficacy studies.

 As the immunisation campaign progressed 

 from May through July this year across 11 districts of Uttar 

 Pradesh, Assam, Bengal and Karnataka, officials recorded 

 504 adverse reactions and 22 deaths among the immunised 

 children.

 Health officials have described 

 the deaths as coincidental events that had nothing 

 to do with the vaccine. They said local safety studies were 

 not necessary because there was abundant data on the vaccines 

 safety from China where it has been used for 18 years on 

 more than 200 million children. South Korea and Nepal have 

 also used the vaccine, and a scientific advisory body to 

 the World Health Organisation had last year described the 

 vaccine as showing excellent safety and efficacy.

 The decision to use the Chinese 

 vaccine followed an outbreak of JE in eastern Uttar Pradesh 

 last year that had killed more than 1,800 children. We 

 exercised diligence and took into account the experience 

 of other countries, Prasanna Hota, health secretary, 

 told The Telegraph. 

 He said the campaign was an emergency 

 measure for districts vulnerable to JE, a viral infection 

 that is spread by mosquito bites and can cause life-threatening 

 encephalitis and brain damage.

 India has been importing JE vaccines 

 because indigenous production of an alternative vaccine 

 cannot meet its demand. The Chinese vaccine contains a live, 

 weakened JE virus that cannot cause disease but protects 

 people from the wild virus.

 But the deaths and adverse reactions 

 such as convulsions, seizures and respiratory distress in 

 just a tiny fraction of the vaccinated children have rekindled 

 a debate in medical circles over the vaccines use 

 without local studies.

 Scientists say they are baffled 

 at how the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) endorsed 

 the vaccine without insisting on local safety and efficacy 

 studies.

 We should have proved safety 

 for ourselves, said Thekakara Jacob John, a senior 

 virologist, formerly with the Christian Medical College 

 in Vellore. Diligent science demanded that immunisation 

 was preceded by a safety and efficacy study in India.

 Two years ago, when a company 

 had applied to market an injectible polio vaccine in India, 

 the ICMR had insisted on local studies and waived them only 

 after the company produced data from 13 studies completed 

 in India. Safety studies are standard practice, said a top 

 scientist who requested anonymity.

 Health officials said studies 

 to evaluate the safety of the Chinese vaccine are now under 

 way in 1,440 children in Burdwan (Bengal) and Bellary (Karnataka).

 Its strange nine 

 million children immunised and now theyre evaluating 

 safety, said a senior medical researcher. At 

 best, these findings would be of academic interest. Why 

 this eyewash?

 Health officials also point out 

 that on the ICMRs suggestions, the vaccine was injected 

 into brains of mice to test its toxicity before its use 

 on children. But animal studies cannot replace human 

 safety studies, said Pradeep Seth, former head of 

 microbiology at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences.

 The animal toxicity study appears 

 to have been designed to show youre doing something, 

 when youre not doing the right thing, said Jacob 

 John. However, health officials say speed has probably prevented 

 fresh outbreaks this year. 

 What Happened?

 Chinese-made JE vaccine administered to nine million 

 children

 No safety studies conducted

 22 deaths, 504 adverse events reported. Health officials 

 deny link to vaccine

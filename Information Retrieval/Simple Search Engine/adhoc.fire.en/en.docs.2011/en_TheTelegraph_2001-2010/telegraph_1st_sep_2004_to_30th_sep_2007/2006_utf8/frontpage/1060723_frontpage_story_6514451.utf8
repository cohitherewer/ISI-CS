The Telegraph - Calcutta : Frontpage

 My target leaked Greg mail: Sourav

 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Sourav Ganguly

 Calcutta, July 22: Its 

 ironical that a short-pitched delivery landed Sourav Ganguly 

 in hospital (for stitches), some hours after hed himself 

 unleashed a bouncer at the heart of Jagmohan Dalmiyas 

 re-election campaign.

 That was last evening.

 On the morning after, the former India captain had pain in the jaw and was preparing for another trip to hospital (a change in dressing is needed) when The Telegraph called at his Northants-provided apartment in Northampton. 

 I was trying to pull Pakistans (Shahid) Nazir when I got hit? Im on medication, but its hurting, he said, adding that he be given a couple of hours before anything was asked.

 Sourav, however, almost went mum on the second call: Theres nothing to say?

 Asked whether, at least, he had a comment on obliquely tearing into one-time mentor Dalmiya, Sourav replied: Im not going to talk about individuals?. My email is directed at whoever leaked (Greg) Chappells one last year?

 Souravs email, addressed to relative Sanjoy Chatterjee ? not business associate Sanjoy Das as assumed, nor elder brother Snehashish, as claimed ? called for punishing those in the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) who were playing with careers.

 The email, which also lauded chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees initiative in addressing issues, was formally released by police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee, who is challenging Dalmiya for the top post. 

 Mukherjee is the chief ministers candidate.

 Chappells email, to the board last September, had savaged Sourav and landed him in the unfortunate state hes in.

 While Sourav didnt elaborate, confidants have been insisting he isnt holding Dalmiya responsible for the Chappell-leak.

 Whatever the timing and interpretation of his email, Souravs target is somebody very close to Dalmiya in the CAB?. That he stays protected is what continues to irk him, is how one put it.

 Perhaps, but nobody will buy that as the heat (in the lead-up to the July 30 elections) is exclusively on Dalmiya. 

 According to another confidant, Sourav was under pressure from June 19, when Bhattacharjee declared he wanted Dalmiya out and that Sourav had been asked to take responsibility.

 The Dalmiya camp, though, dismissed it with contempt: Isnt the pressure so much more on Dalmiya, who runs a business in Bengal?

 The souring of relations began last October when Sourav was hurt that Dalmiya didnt use his influence to defer the captains appointment and the selection of the squad for the first couple of ODIs, against Sri Lanka, by four-five days.

 Coming just weeks after the flare-up with Chappell, that was a crucial stage in his career. 

 Owing to tennis elbow symptoms, Sourav wasnt available for selection on the day (October 13) the selectors met in Mohali. 

 The rest is history.

 Dalmiyas view couldnt be ascertained, but his control within the board had begun to diminish and it didnt help that Sourav wasnt prepared to risk aggravating his injury in the Challenger which coincided with that selection meeting.

 Still, one learns Sourav hasnt exactly forgotten the occasions when Dalmiya got him the best deal. Equally, hes convinced he proved himself a worthy horse.

 That he gave Dalmiya and India over 15,000 runs in Tests and ODIs.

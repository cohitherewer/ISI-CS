 Industry share in land rehab

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Ranchi, Sept. 11: The governments rehabilitation policy would be so attractive, chief minister Arjun Munda had claimed, that land owners would willingly give up their agricultural land for industry. 

 His truncated cabinet today finally approved the policy and hurriedly unveiled it, in a bid to score brownie points ahead of the trust vote.

 Amounts of compensation, for both land and dwelling units, have been raised substantially and the policy scores a first in the country by providing for the displaced to be allotted preferential shares in the industry that comes up on their land. Up to 50 per cent of the total compensation can now be given by way of shares, the policy says. Husband and wife would be joint shareholders, though the wife will be the first share-holder.

 There is also provision for land-for-land and each displaced family will be paid a sum of Rs 1.5 lakh to build houses on alternative plots.

 The policy thoughtfully provides for temporary dwelling units and a monthly allowance to the displaced, pending rehabilitation. While staying in temporary dwelling units, families will be paid a monthly allowance of Rs 2,000 and an annual conveyance allowance of Rs 5,000 as well.

 Industries will also provide compensatory jobs, vocational training for self-employment or one-time cash-payment in lieu of jobs.

 While the policy will be applicable, in the first instance, to non-coal-bearing areas, it scores another first by providing for compensation to even those people who might have illegally encroached upon the land acquired for industries.

 Details of the policy were not circulated to the media and the briefing left several details uncovered. It was said, for example, that families giving up all their agricultural land would be entitled to a compensation of Rs 5 lakh, those giving up two-thirds of their land Rs 3 lakh and so on. It was not, however, clear whether this amount will be over and above the compensation package or if it will be offered for every acre of land.

 Ganguly back 

 in team, VVS Laxman vice-captain

 Sourav Ganguly, VVS Laxman

 New Delhi, Nov 30 

 (PTI): After nearly a year, Sourav Ganguly 

 today made a dramatic comeback to the Indian test team in 

 the wake of the side's disastrous performance in South Africa 

 and calls for bringing back experienced players.

 The selectors also dropped Mohammad Kaif and Suresh Raina 

 from the squad and removed out of form Virender Sehwag from 

 vice-captaincy, which now goes to VVS Laxman.

 The decision to recall Ganguly was taken by the national 

 selectors, who, significantly, met BCCI President Sharad 

 Pawar at his residence here before their meeting to select 

 the 16-member squad for the three-Test series against South 

 Africa beginning on December 15.

 The Bengal left-hander, who has had reasonable success 

 in domestic matches, was widely speculated to make it to 

 the team after the relatively inexperienced Indian side 

 struggled on fast-paced South African tracks to suffer one 

 humiliating defeat after another.

 Ganguly comes in the place of an injured Yuvraj Singh in 

 the middle order while Zaheer Khan was rewarded for his 

 show in the One-Dayers with a Test berth. Delhi opener Gautam 

 Gambhir was also finally rewarded for his consistency in 

 domestic circuit with a place in the 16, announced by BCCI 

 secretary and selection committee convenor Niranjan Shah 

 at a press conference here.

 Asked about the inclusion of Ganguly, chairman of selection 

 committee Dilip Vengsarkar said it was felt that there was 

 a need to have experienced players in the squad.

 If you look at the performances in South Africa, 

 our batting has failed. We need experienced players like 

 Laxman and Ganguly, the former Indian captain said.

 Vengsarkar said the selectors wanted to send the message 

 that nobody could take their place in the team for granted 

 through their decision to strip Sehwag of vice-captaincy.

 Team: Rahul Dravid (capt), Wasim Jaffer, 

 Gautam Gambhir, Virender Sehwag, Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav 

 Ganguly, Mahendra Singh Dhoni (wk), VVS Laxman (vice-capt), 

 Dinesh Kaarthick, Harbhajan Singh, Anil Kumble, Munaf Patel, 

 Irfan Pathan, VRV Singh, Zaheer Khan and S Sreesanth.

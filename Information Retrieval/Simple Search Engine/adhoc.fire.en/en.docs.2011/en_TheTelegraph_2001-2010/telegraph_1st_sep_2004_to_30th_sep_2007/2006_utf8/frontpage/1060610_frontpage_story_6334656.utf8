 Srinagar, June 9: A Delhi police team arrived here today with Sahil Zaroo to search places he had identified during interrogation.

 Sahil Zaroo was brought to Srinagar today by a team of Delhi police officials to follow the leads given by him, a senior officer of Jammu and Kashmir police said.

 He added that the state police would assist the Delhi team.

 Accused of procuring drugs for Rahul Mahajans late night party in Delhi that sent the late Pramod Mahajans son to hospital and left his secretary Bibek Moitra dead, Sahil was arrested by the local police from a television channels studio last week.

 Immediately after he was flown to Srinagar, Sahil was taken to his home in Nigeen on the outskirts of the city where local police officials were waiting.

 According to sources, Sahil also led the police team to the Shalimar residence of his maternal uncle, Mohammad Yusuf Kawoosa, where he had stayed for two days before being taken into custody.

 Sahil recovered the clothes (a shirt and trousers) he wore on the day he attended Rahul Mahajans party from his Nigeen residence and his maternal uncles residence, said a police officer.

 However, the police could not find his mobile phone. 

 Delhi police have registered a case against Rahul and Sahil under the Prevention of Narcotics and Psychotropic Drugs Act. Along with the two, the police have also arrested a Nigerian citizen who is believed to have supplied the drugs to Sahil on the day of the party.

 Pak denies visa on arrival

 Islamabad, Sept. 28 (Reuters): Pakistan will not issue visas on arrival to Indians, contrary to a report the official Associated Press of Pakistan had put out yesterday quoting the tourism minister.

 According to that report, Nilofar Bakhtiar, the minister, had said at Wagah that visitors from 23 countries and India would be given visas on arrival.

 Tourism ministry officials said today the relaxation would apply to the other countries but not to Pakistans neighbour.

 A ministry statement said she was misquoted and the only concession to Indian tourists and pilgrims would be an increase in the duration of their visas.

 Bakhtiar had said visas would now be issued for a month instead of 15 days.

 India has already notified a visa-on-arrival scheme at Wagah for Pakistanis below 12 and above 65 years. It has also proposed relaxing the rules.

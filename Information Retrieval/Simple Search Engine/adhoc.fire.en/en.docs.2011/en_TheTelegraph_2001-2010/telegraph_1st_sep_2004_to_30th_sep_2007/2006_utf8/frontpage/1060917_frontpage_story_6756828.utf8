 Ulfa wants level field for parleys

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Guwahati, Sept. 16: The banned Ulfa today asked Delhi to create a level playing field for direct talks. 

 Ulfa, in its mouthpiece Freedom, reiterated its demand that Delhi should create a level playing field and a proper atmosphere for talks by releasing jailed members of the outfits central committee. It also demanded that the Centre provide exact information about activists who went missing during the Indo-Bhutan military operations. 

 They (the government of India) must desist from spreading rumours against Ulfa. Only then would a level playing field be created, the outfit claimed. Ulfa said during the third round of talks between the Peoples Consultative Group and the Centre on June 22, a joint memorandum was published with the consent of both parties. 

 The main principle of the memorandum stipulated that both India and Ulfa would try to create a congenial atmosphere for talks and India would release the five jailed central committee members of Ulfa. As such, everyone awaited the release of the members. But on August 13, 2006, the government announced a ceasefire without honouring the commitment of releasing the jailed members, Ulfa said. 

 Ulfa claimed that it could produce facts about Indias conspiracy and evidence of the governments superficial cordiality for the sake of talks. But in the greater interest of a solution, we are restraining ourselves, the outfit claimed.

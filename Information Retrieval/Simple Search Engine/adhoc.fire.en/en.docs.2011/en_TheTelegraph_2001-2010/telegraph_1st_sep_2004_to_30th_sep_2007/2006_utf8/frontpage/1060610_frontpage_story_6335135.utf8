 Buddha on back foot

 June 9: The CPM and its Left allies find themselves on the back foot by the Congress-inspired move of the Maharashtra government not to levy sales tax on the increased prices of petrol and diesel.

 After the development, it will be difficult to make the common people understand that we are trying to build a campaign on an issue far bigger than a mere Re 1 or Rs 2 reduction in prices, said a CPM politburo member. 

 For the CPM in Bengal and Kerala, the situation is extremely embarrassing. Kerala, under Congress rule before the CPM won the last polls, has already done in the past what Maharashtra is doing now.

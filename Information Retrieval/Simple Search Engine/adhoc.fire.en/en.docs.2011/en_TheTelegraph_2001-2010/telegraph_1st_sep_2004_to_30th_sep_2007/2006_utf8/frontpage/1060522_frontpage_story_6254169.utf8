 PM talks tour on track

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 21: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh will go ahead with a scheduled visit to Srinagar on Wednesday for a round-table conference, the Centre announced a few hours after todays attack.

 The venue of the conference ? a hotel ? is just 3 km from the stadium that was targeted. A security team left for Srinagar this evening.

 The round-table ? originally set for a day ? has been extended to another day to accommodate the Hurriyat Conference, the moderate faction of which had said it cannot be part of a crowd.

 The moderates will take a decision on the talks tomorrow, while the hardline group had turned its back on the conference. The Hurriyat leadership has been specifically warned by militants to stay away from the meeting.

 The first round-table in Delhi had been boycotted by separatist groups but, this time, the government was hoping that some leaders might attend following reports that Pakistan has given the green signal. 

 Todays attack ? seen as a clear signal that the militants do not share Pakistans reported position ? has made the governments task more difficult. The government is still trying through back channels to turn the moderates around.

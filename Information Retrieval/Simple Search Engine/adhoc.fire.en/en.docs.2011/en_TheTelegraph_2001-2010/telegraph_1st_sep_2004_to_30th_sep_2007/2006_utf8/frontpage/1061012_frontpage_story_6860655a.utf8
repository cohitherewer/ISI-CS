 New Delhi, Oct.11 (PTI): Delhi police today said that South African cricketer Herschelle Gibbs admitted to have received offer of money twice for under-performing in a match. He was part of the 2000 match-fixing conspiracy.

 Gibbs named Nicky Boje, Pieter Strydon and former South African cricketer Derek Crookes as involved in the scandal. He did not name any Indian player.

 Six years after the scam broke out, Gibbs appeared for the first time before a team of crime branch officials in India accompanied by his lawyer Peter Whelan.

 Joint Commissioner of Police, Ranjit Narayan told a press conference that Gibbs confessed to have received the offer twice from late South African captain Hansie Cronje and was part of the conspiracy. Explaining the nature of the offer, Narayan said Gibbs was asked to ldquo;under-perform in return of certain amount of money rdquo;. He also said Gibbs may be required for questioning again and his lawyer had agreed to it.

 The Delhi police had arrested three persons -- South Delhi-based businessman Rajesh Kalra, late music baron Gulshan Kumar's son Kishan Kumar and Sunil Dhara -- in the case but they were all released on bail later. Police are yet to arrest Sanjeev Chawla, the key accused and believed to be in England.

 Gibbs, who had skipped tours of India in the past fearing arrest by the Delhi police, agreed to appear for interrogation this time before joining his team for the Champions trophy in Mumbai.

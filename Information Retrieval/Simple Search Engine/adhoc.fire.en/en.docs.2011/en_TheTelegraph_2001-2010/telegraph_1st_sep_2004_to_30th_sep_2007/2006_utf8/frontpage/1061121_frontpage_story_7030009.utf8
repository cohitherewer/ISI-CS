 Delhi greets Hu with fair play

New Delhi, Nov. 20: As Chinese President Hu Jintao arrived today to talk business, Delhi stressed that its security worries about foreign direct investment (FDI) in sensitive sectors are not China-specific.

 There is no discrimination against Chinese companies, an official said.

 Although India-China business ties have grown fast, Beijing has often objected to investment curbs in key sectors. Its ambassador recently complained about this, adding that Chinese companies faced visa problems, too.

 A recent National Security Council report, too, speaks of regulating FDI in sensitive sectors like telecom and aviation, but officials denied that China was being singled out. 

 Delhi is eager to clear the air as the focus of Hus three-day visit will be on business and a comprehensive economic arrangement. 

 Hu and his wife Liu Yongging were received at the airport by foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee and minister-in-waiting Kapil Sibal.

 The two sides will sign 10 agreements tomorrow, in fields ranging from protection of bilateral investment to education and health. On the talks table will be a proposal on civil nuclear energy cooperation.

 But the recent territorial controversy over Arunachal Pradesh will not weigh too much, officials said. The issue will be taken up by special representatives, Indias national security adviser M.K. Narayanan and Chinese vice-foreign minister Dai Binguou, who are working out dates.

 Amid fears about China diverting the Brahmaputras waters, Delhi will seek to enhance the exchange of hydrological data on the northeastern river and Sutlej.

 The Indo-US nuclear deal will be discussed but officials said it is too early to seek support from China in its capacity as a Nuclear Suppliers Group member. We have not reached that stage.

 Stirrings of land war across the country 

 - Delhi weighs Bengal model for SEZs 

 OUR BUREAU

 In Bengal, Mamata Banerjee 

 is on hunger strike against land acquisition for a Tata 

 car factory

 Tribals in Orissa announce effigy-burning on Dussehra to 

 protest the Vedanta alumina project

 Also in Orissa, a mass hunger strike is on in Bhubaneswar 

 against Poscos steel plant

 On Sunday in Punjab, farmers blocked rail tracks to protest 

 land acquisition

 Sept. 25: Sometime ago, 

 Manmohan Singh described the Naxalite threat as the biggest 

 security challenge facing the country. 

 Seeing the way bonfires of protest 

 are being lit across the country against land acquisition 

 for industry, it seems he is facing an economic challenge 

 the like of which probably comes once in a hundred years 

 or more.

 At the centre of it lies the governments 

 special economic zones (SEZ) policy, but in Bengal and Orissa 

 and elsewhere, it is being shown that the problem is far 

 bigger: acquiring land for any industry at all.

 Bengal has the strictest land-use 

 norms for SEZs in the country. After the Nainital conference 

 of Congress chief ministers, where Sonia Gandhi herself 

 voiced concern about SEZs, there is a move now at the Centre 

 to consider adopting the Bengal model.

 The key part in the Bengal land-use 

 pattern is the fact that 50 per cent of an SEZ has to be 

 used for manufacturing activity whereas the Union commerce 

 ministrys model puts it at 35 per cent, that too after 

 revising it recently from 25 per cent after fears that these 

 zones had essentially become real estate developments.

 If the Centre were to follow the 

 Bengal model, this would have to be increased to 50 per 

 cent. The ministry is also considering limiting the land 

 used for housing.

 The central leadership of the 

 CPM, which rules in Bengal, will ask the Manmohan Singh 

 government to adopt the state model nationally. We 

 had opposed the (SEZ) act when it was passed by the Centre. 

 We want the Centre to accept the Bengal SEZ model, 

 said politburo member Sitaram Yechury.

 The partys central committee, 

 now in session in Delhi, is expected to discuss the SEZ 

 issue. The party is preparing a note outlining the amendments 

 it wants in the act.

 But just as there are contrasting 

 opinions in the Congress on SEZs and on the larger issue 

 of acquiring farmland for industry the CPM, too, is riven 

 by differences.

 M.K. Pandhe, Citu leader and politburo 

 member, demurred. We do not know if the Bengal model 

 which, too, has flaws is the answer, he said.

 The answer is not clear to anyone 

 yet as a radical economic change gets under way in rural 

 India from agriculture to industry.

 Bengals stated policy is 

 not to acquire multi-crop land but, as the experience in 

 Singur where the Tata small-car factory will come up has 

 shown, it is hard to persuade farmers to part with land.

 In keeping with the concerns expressed 

 at the Congress conclave in Nainital, the UPA government 

 is likely to decide against allowing prime farmland to be 

 turned into industrial enclaves. 

 Fallow land will be preferred. 

 Otherwise, land that is not very fertile may be taken over 

 for SEZs. 

 The board of approval for 

 SEZs has made it mandatory that no proposal for setting 

 up SEZs on prime agricultural land be cleared, commerce 

 minister Kamal Nath said.

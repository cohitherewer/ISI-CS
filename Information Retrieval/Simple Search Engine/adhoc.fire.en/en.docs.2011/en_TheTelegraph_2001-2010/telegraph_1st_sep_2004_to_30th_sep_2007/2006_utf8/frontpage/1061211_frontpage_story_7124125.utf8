 Mamata shuts all doors out of fast

 OUR BUREAU 

 Calcutta, Dec. 10: Mamata Banerjee appears to have shut all doors out of the makeshift home of her fast, declining offers of talks from chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee as well as the Tatas.

 The question of talks with anybody on Singur does not arise until the state government stops land acquisition, she said when Tata Motors head Ravi Kants statement about feelers sent to her was brought to her notice.

 Kant told PTI: We have sent feelers to her three-four times in the past three months. But we have not had any positive response.

 He said Tata Motors was still willing to talk to her.

 On the seventh day of her fast, Mamata denied having received any feelers from Tata Motors. Nobody has written to me so far seeking my view on the Singur project.

 Feelers are usually not despatched in writing.

 Mamata has rejected several requests from the chief minister to call off her fast amid escalating concern in the government and the CPM over her health.

 A team of four doctors from SSKM Hospital reached the fast site to examine Mamata but Trinamul supporters turned them back.

 She warned the government it would have to face the consequences if she was forcibly removed from the fast venue on health grounds.

 She accused a central minister from Bengal of conspiring with Bhattacharjee to break my fast with police help.

 In Delhi, the Congress, which had distanced itself from Mamata on Singur, came alive today through a central minister from Bengal, Priya Ranjan Das Munshi.

 There is a lack of transparency in providing the compensation package to farmers. The chief minister should call a meeting of all political parties and explain the exact status, he said.

 Mamata, who addressed people gathered at the venue, will hold a huge rally at Esplanade at 1 pm tomorrow.

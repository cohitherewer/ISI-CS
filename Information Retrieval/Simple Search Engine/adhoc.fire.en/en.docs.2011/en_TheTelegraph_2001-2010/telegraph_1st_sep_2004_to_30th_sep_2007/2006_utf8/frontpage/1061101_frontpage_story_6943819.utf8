 Jawan kills colonel

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Srinagar, Oct. 31: A jawan gunned down a lieutenant colonel today, making him the senior-most army officer to have been killed by a junior this year.

 Lt Colonel Saket Saxena was inside his camp at Harwan, near Srinagar, when his junior from 28 Rashtriya Rifles opened fire at him. This is the fourth incident of fragging killing or attempting to kill a senior officer in US military parlance in the Valley in the last 11 days.

 Shower clouds festive fervour

 OUR BUREAU

 Ranchi/Jamshedpur, Sept. 30: A week after several parts of the state were flooded due to heavy showers following a depression, another has cast a shadow on the festivities. 

 Officials at the Patna Met office said a low pressure belt was hovering over south Chhattisgarh and its adjoining areas and it might cause rainfall in various parts of Jharkhand in the next 24 hours. 

 The low pressure belt originated from the Bay of Bengal. After crossing the Orissa coast it has become stagnant over south Chhattisgarh, said T.N. Jha, the director of Patna Met office. 

 Jha said several places in Jharkhand and Bihar experienced moderate rainfall in the last 24 hours owing to the low pressure. The detailed analysis of the weather chart (at 4 pm) indicated that the low pressure belt was gradually moving towards Madhya Pradesh. In its 24-hour forecast, the Met office predicted rains and thundershowers at various places in Jharkhand, especially in the hilly and plateau regions. 

 The chairman of the agricultural physics and meteorology department of Birsa Agriculture University, A. Wadood, urged the Puja enthusiasts not to panic, as there wont be heavy rains. 

 If it rains heavily, it will be due to the local weather conditions, he said.

 Predicting a sunny Dussehra, Wadood said: The low pressure belt will gradually move towards the west and weaken by October 2.

 Despite the inclement weather, the Puja enthusiasts of the state capital are all set to beat the rains. 

 Rains wont be able to stop us from pandal-hopping. We had planned to visit different pandals on Ashtami and Navami. We will stick to our plan even if it rains, said Amrita Kumari, a Class VIII student of Vivekananda Vidya Mandir.

 Cut to Jamshedpur, where sky was overcast in the morning. Sporadic rainfall spoilt the festive fervour of some of the Puja revellers. 

 The local Met office based at the Sonari airport recorded a rainfall of about 7 mm in the last 24 hours. The rains also had an impact on the last-minute puja shopping.

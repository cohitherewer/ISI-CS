 Tata land drive rolls

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, June 28: At a gathering tomorrow at Singur, where the Tata Motors plant will come up, some farmers will volunteer to sell their land to the government.

 After a reassurance from industries minister Nirupam Sen today, CPM leaders from the area said they were convinced about the governments intention to not acquire multi-crop and homestead land. 

 We will see to it that multi-crop land is spared as much as possible. The process (of acquisition) will begin within a few days, Sen said.

 The West Bengal Industrial Development 

 Corporation, the official requirer of the land, 

 which means the land will be vested in it for handover to 

 the Tatas, will apply in a week to the district administration 

 seeking acquisition, industry secretary Sabyasachi Sen said.

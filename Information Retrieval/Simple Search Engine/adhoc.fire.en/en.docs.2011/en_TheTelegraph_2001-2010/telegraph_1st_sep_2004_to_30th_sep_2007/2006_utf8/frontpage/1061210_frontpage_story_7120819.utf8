 DHD guns for security

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Silchar, Dec. 9: Pro-talks Dimasa militant group Dima Halam Daogah today offered to provide security cover to personnel engaged in the conversion of the 2,010-km metre gauge track running through the Barail range in North Cachar Hills.

 The gauge conversion work came to a standstill after an attack by a DHD splinter group in October left 11 Government Railway Police personnel dead. The area is since being patrolled by police, security forces and the army.

 DHD chief Dilip Nunisa today said his armed cadre could patrol the rail track as well as the workers camps to ensure that the work was completed smoothly. 

 An attack by the same splinter group on Thursday also affected work on the East-West Corridor project in the NC Hills.

 Speaking to The Telegraph over phone from Haflong, Nunisa said he had not received a response to the offer from either New Delhi or Dispur yet. 

 He, however, said both the Centre and the state government should give the permission in writing to the outfit to deploy pro-peace cadre on security duty in the area.

 Nunisa held the breakaway faction of his group, known as Black Widow and led by Jewel Gorlosa, responsible for the attacks along the rail route. This is the only rail link connecting south Assam and adjoining Tripura and Mizoram to the rest of the country.

 Nunisa alleged that the Jewel Gorlosa group was secretly in league with the National Socialist Council of Nagalim (Isak-Muivah). The Naga group, he said, had agreed to supply arms against cash to the Gorlosa group and provide training to its rebels at the NSCN (I-M)s Hebron camp near Dimapur.

 Nunisa also alleged that the rival faction was backed by the Centre as part of its attempt to keep the Dimasa insurgency movement divided. 

 Nunisa stressed that his group did not wish to thwart development work aimed at economic prosperity of the Dimasa tribe. 

 This, he said, was the reason behind the offer.

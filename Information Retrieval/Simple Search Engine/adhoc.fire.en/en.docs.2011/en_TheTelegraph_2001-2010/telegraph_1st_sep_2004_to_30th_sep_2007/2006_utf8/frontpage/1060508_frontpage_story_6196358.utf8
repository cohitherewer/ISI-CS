 Panel suggests Budhia go-slow

 PRABUDDHA S. JAGADEB

 Bhubaneswar, May 7: The panel of doctors examining Budhia Singh is believed to have suggested that the child should not be allowed to run, at least for now.

 Even as coach Biranchi Das started packing his bags for London, to make the Guinness World Records bid next week, the panel headed by the chief medical officer of Capital Hospital, Sugat Kar, is said to have noted that the boys serum urea, potassium and ALKP (alkaline phosphatase) levels were on the higher side. 

 Signs of under-nourishment, vitamin deficiency and pallor have been noted. The boy should not run, as reflected by the abnormal parameters of health, said a doctor, who did not wish to be named. 

 The interim report ? it is inconclusive in the absence of MRI and karyotyping (genetic) tests ? found that the boys kidneys were functioning normally. 

 Runners are expected to have high haemoglobin level. Budhias levels are lower, said the doctor. 

 The MRI and karyotyping tests will be done in Cuttack tomorrow as Bhubaneswar does not have the facilities.

 On Friday, doctors had noted that the boy, whose age has been put at four and a half, had high blood pressure (135/85) and pulse rate (98/68).

 R.S.N. Murthy, cardiologist at the Capital Hospital and part of the doctors panel, confirmed that the blood pressure and blood urea level of the child was found to be high, which could eventually affect the kidneys. 

 The panel submitted its report to the chairman of the Khurda district welfare committee Rabi Shankar Mishra. Following a warrant-cum-authorisation letter from the committee, police on Wednesday had taken the boy to hospital.

 Diagnosing Budhias collapse during Tuesdays 65-km run as hypoglycemia, where blood sugar level falls, a doctor feared the boy could suffer serious injuries by the time he reaches 15 if there is periosteal tear on the bones. 

 But Budhias coach Das rubbished the findings of the medical panel. I have no reason to believe the tests are accurate. The doctors have been appointed by the government to give a dubious report. I will get Budhia tested at any hospital outside the state if necessary, said Das, who is planning to fly to London on May 15 for a marathon.

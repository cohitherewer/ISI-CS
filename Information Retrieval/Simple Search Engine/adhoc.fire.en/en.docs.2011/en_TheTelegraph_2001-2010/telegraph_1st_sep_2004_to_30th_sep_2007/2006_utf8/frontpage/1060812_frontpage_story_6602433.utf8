 Dispur for reforms in medical entrance

 - One-man panel set up to streamline process

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Guwahati, Aug. 11: Proxy examinees and interviewees, hazy rules on permanent residence proof and a number of other anomalies detected in the MBBS examination system have forced Dispur to embark on a major reform programme to streamline the process.

 A one-man commission comprising Dr Dhrubajyoti Bora has been constituted by the government to prepare a blueprint for a model rule for Assam. 

 Health and family welfare minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said Bora, who will prepare the blueprint after studying the rules followed by other states, has been asked to submit the report within a month.

 Bora will study the nativity and permanent residence clause set down by other states and suggest a suitable clause for Assam.

 It has been observed that taking advantage of the prevailing norm on the Permanent Resident Certificate (PRC) the certificate is necessary for anyone who wishes to take the medical entrance examination even non-residents are obtaining seats in the medical colleges of the state.

 Anyone who has been residing in Assam for two to three years gets a PRC and sits for the medical entrance examination, while in states like Kerala and Karnataka, one has to pass the higher secondary examination from that state to qualify for the medical entrance examination, Sarma said. 

 After Bora submits his report, it will be released for a public debate before being adopted as a rule. 

 The new set of rules, the government hopes, will also arrest the rising trend of proxy examination.

 A number of proxy candidates were noticed during the last MBBS entrance examination held on May 14. 

 The papers were then sent for handwriting examination to the forensic department. We have received the report from the forensic laboratory and will soon make the finding public, Sarma said.

 The government has also decided to include a forensic expert on the interview board of the medical entrance examination to prevent proxy candidates from appearing for interviews. 

 It has also been noticed that many deserving candidates, with brilliant academic records in the HSLC and at the higher secondary level are not being able to crack the medical examination while students with mediocre records are securing some of the top positions. 

 The one-man commission will be followed by the constitution of a three-member committee to suggest the overall reform of the examination system, said Sarma. 

 Chief minister Tarun Gogoi has been taking personal initiative in the reform process, the minister added.

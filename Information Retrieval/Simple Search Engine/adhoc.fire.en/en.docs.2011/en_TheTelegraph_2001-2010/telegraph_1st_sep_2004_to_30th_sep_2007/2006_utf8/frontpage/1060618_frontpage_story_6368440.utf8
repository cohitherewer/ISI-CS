Sorcery to conspiracy

- All tricks at full play, but Brazil unfazed 

KEIR RADNEDGE

Is Ronaldo pregnant? demanded a headline in one of 

the German newspapers tossed on to thousands of doorsteps.

The question might have been raised for a string of 

reasons: maybe because he had been to hospital for tests for dizziness; maybe 

because he looks so tubby out there on the pitch; maybe because he was so lethargic 

against Croatia; maybe, indeed, because Brazil has achieved so many footballing 

miracles that nothing on this earth may be beyond them.

The truth is, of course, somewhat more prosaic. 

For all the fun, festivities and goals at this World 

Cup, no one can yet see beyond Brazil as favourites to win on July 9 back in Berlin.

Not even hosts Germany, despite the momentum of its 

two, second-round qualifying victories; not even Argentina, despite the brilliance 

of its humiliation of a rank bad Serbia; certainly not England or Holland or Italy 

or fast-fading France. 

Maybe the Czechs as outsiders but, with Jan Koller 

and Milan Baros injured, who will score their goals? Besides, look how they fared 

against Ghana.

No, the only hope left for anyone who desperately 

desires a non-predictable conclusion in three weeks time is to hope for 

some desperately unscheduled accident to befall soccers samba superstars.

Perhaps superstition might play a part, as it does 

in every match back in Brazil. Such as fielding a black goalkeeper.

This is not racism: this is fatalism. 

Brazil fielded a black goalkeeper, Barbosa, in its 

shock defeat by Uruguay in front of 200,000 of their own fans in Rios Maracana 

stadium in the 1950 World Cup final. 

Not until years later did Brazil bring a black goalkeeper 

? Manga ? to a World Cup... and then it crashed out in the first group round in 

England in 1966. 

Now it falls to Dida of Milan to prove that superstition 

is hot air. Even so, the macumba (a Brazilian cult or ritual) priestesses may 

be extra busy back home in the favelas (poor areas in or near a city) over the 

next few weeks.

Then there is the conspiracy theory: that European 

governments, politicians and lawyers have ganged up to bring the full weight of 

law to bear against Brazils genius.

That is why, so claim some Rio newspapers, long-serving 

captain Cafu has had to confront the fearsome prospect of a spell in an Italian 

jail for his involvement ? innocent, he has always insisted ? in a forged passport 

scandal. Cafu, his agent, his wife and various local government officials had 

been accused of creating false documents proving he had qualified for an Italian 

? and hence a European Union ? passport.

Last week, on the eve of Brazils opening game 

against the Croats, Cafu learned that the charges had been thrown out by an Italian 

court of appeal. Good news but too late for the issue not to have affected his 

mood and focus during Brazils preparation for the German adventure.

Next came the row over Ronaldos weight, his 

war of words with Brazils President Luis Inacio Lula da Silva, his substitution 

against Croatia and then all manner of insulting headlines and pictures in the 

German media with Ronaldos paunch pictured from a full 360 degrees at all 

the most unflattering angles.

People will stop at nothing to try to unsettle 

us, says Mario Zagallo, Brazils former champion as player and manager 

and now the national teams coaching supervisor. But they will not 

achieve anything because We Are Brazil!

Yes, maybe now we have it. Hope at last. Doesnt 

pride always go before a fall?

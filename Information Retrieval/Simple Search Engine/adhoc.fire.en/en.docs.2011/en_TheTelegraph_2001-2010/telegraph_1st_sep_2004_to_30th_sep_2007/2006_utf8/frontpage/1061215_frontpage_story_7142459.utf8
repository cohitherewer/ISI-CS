 Report of Dawood heart attack

 SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI

 Mumbai, Dec. 14: Intelligence sources are claiming that they have information fugitive gangster Dawood Ibrahim has suffered a heart attack and is admitted in a Pakistan hospital.

 We have definite information that Dawood Ibrahim suffered a massive cardiac arrest on Tuesday and is currently lodged in the intensive care unit of a well-known Islamabad hospital, said a top official in the Central Bureau of Investigation.

 After his daughters much- publicised marriage to former Pakistan cricketer Javed Miandads son, the gangster, who was a Karachi resident, according to Indian claims, had moved to Islamabad, the sources said.

 On Tuesday, 51-year-old Dawood (in picture) was admitted to a heart hospital after the attack while on his way out of Islamabad. 

 He has been admitted under a false name. Intelligence agencies are trying to find out the name under which he has been admitted, said the CBI official.

 There are two civilian hospitals in Islamabad the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS) and Shifa International both of which denied admitting Dawood, adds our correspondent in Islamabad.

 This information is totally baseless, fabricated and misleading, said Dr Fazal-e-Hadi, the executive director of PIMS.

 Pakistan has always denied the presence of Dawood on its soil.

 Mumbai police sources confirmed the news of Dawoods ill health, but said he had also suffered a mild attack about a fortnight ago.

 Indian investigators have not been able to bring Dawood to justice for 13 years, but now claim to have knowledge of the state of his heart.

 An official of the anti-terrorist squad of Maharashtra police said: He is said to be under pressure from Pakistani authorities to leave the country. His men in the UAE are falling into the police net like ninepins.

 Ten of Dawoods men were deported from Dubai to India in November. A dozen more, two of them accused in the Bombay blasts, are expected shortly.

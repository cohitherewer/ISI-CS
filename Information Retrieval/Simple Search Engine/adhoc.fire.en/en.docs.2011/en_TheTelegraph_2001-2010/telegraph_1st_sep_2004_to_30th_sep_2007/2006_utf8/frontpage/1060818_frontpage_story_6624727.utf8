 Seniority edge for Benoy

 INDRANIL GHOSH

 Calcutta, Aug. 17: Benoy Konar, the veteran peasant leader, appears to be under consideration for induction into the CPM politburo, the partys highest policy-making body.

 If seniority a factor that is playing heavily on the leaderships mind proves the clincher, Konar has the edge over industry minister Nirupam Sen, considered a strong contender for the slot left vacant by Anil Biswass untimely death.

 Konar, in his seventies, is now a member of the CPMs central committee.

 The politburo is expected to announce the new nominee after a session slated for September 12 and 13 in Calcutta

 We are meeting in Calcutta this time primarily for Jyoti Basu who had not been able to attend the past few meetings because of health concerns, a senior leader said. A decision may have to be taken at next months meeting on the vacancy from Bengal. Konars name is under consideration, lets see how things work out. 

 Basu and a section of the leadership have suggested that Konars seniority in the organisation, his contribution to the CPM and his grasp of party affairs should be recognised.

 Another factor weighing in Konars favour is his acknowledgement of the need for industrialisation. The peasant leader now advocates the use of farmland, if unavoidable, for setting up industry a priority for the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government.

 In a way, the ongoing exercise represents a poetic twist of history. In 1996, Konar and several others had participated in an organisational vote to torpedo a momentous proposal that had brought the CPM tantalisingly close to heading Indias first communist-led government.

 The naysayers also robbed Basu of a chance to become the first communist Prime Minister. Ten years down the line, Basu is trying to ensure that Konar makes it to the politburo.

 Konar was not initially keen on taking on the bigger responsibility but is learnt to have been persuaded to drop his objection.

 Industry minister Sen, the No. 2 in the Bhattacharjee cabinet, too, has the stature, experience and the backing from the leadership to make it to the politburo. Like Konar, Sen also hails from Burdwan an agrarian bastion of the CPM and is a central committee member. 

 If Sen misses out this time, another chance could be thrown up by an event no one in the CPM wants to discuss in public: the formal retirement of Basu. 

 Basu, the emeritus figure in the politburo, has been pressing the leadership to relieve him, but each time the party has dissuaded him. If Basu puts his foot down, the partys options will be limited, though leaders like state secretary Biman Bose would like him to continue to maintain the power balance.

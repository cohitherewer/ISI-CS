 More cops for Bodo districts

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Guwahati, Dec. 4: Dispur has decided to enhance the strength of the police force in the Bodoland Territorial Council-administered districts to 2,000 personnel and increase the number of police stations.

 This was decided at a review of ongoing development schemes in the BTC belt. The meeting was convened by the chief ministers office this evening. 

 BTC chief Hagrama Mohilary did not attend the meeting, which lasted over two hours, but the heads of all key departments and several ministers were present. 

 The BTC was represented by deputy chairman Kampha Borgoyari.

 Sources in the chief ministers office said the deployment of additional police personnel would take place in due course and the number of police stations would be worked out soon. 

 The BTCs jurisdiction spans four districts Kokrajhar, Udalguri, Chirang and Baksa.

 Sources also said the long-awaited withdrawal of cases pending against former members of the disbanded Bodo Liberation Tigers (BLT) one of the key points in the 2003 tripartite memorandum of settlement involving the outfit, Dispur and Delhi did not come up for discussion. 

 Mohilary was then the BLT chief, while Chandan Brahma was the second-in-command of the outfit. The tripartite accord led to formation of the BTC. 

 While the issue of withdrawing pending police cases was skirted by Dispur, it did assure representatives of the BTC of efforts to expedite the process of creating infrastructure and set up treasury offices. 

 The previous review meeting of the BTC-administered districts was held three months ago.

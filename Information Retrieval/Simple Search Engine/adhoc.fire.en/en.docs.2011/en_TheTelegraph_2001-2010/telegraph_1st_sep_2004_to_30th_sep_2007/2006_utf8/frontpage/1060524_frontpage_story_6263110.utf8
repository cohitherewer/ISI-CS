 Protesters express outrage

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi, May 23: First reactions to the governments quota announcement from protesting doctors and medical students ranged from outrageous to were not surprised.

 The decision is outrageous and audacious, Shashmit Sarangi, a representative of Youth for Equality, spearheading the agitation, told PTI.

 Ankur, a member of the legal committee of the organisation who did not give a second name, said: Were not surprised. We expected this to happen.

 A more structured response came from Subrata Mandal, a senior resident doctor at the All-India Institute of Medical Sciences. He said: The Prime Minister should explain why the government cannot or does not want to set up an independent commission to examine the impact of reservation in all these years. Were ready to understand the reasons, Mandal said.

 Constituting an independent commission has been the demand of the protesters, but the announcement tonight by the government only spoke of an oversight committee. It did say though that institution heads will be involved in the process.

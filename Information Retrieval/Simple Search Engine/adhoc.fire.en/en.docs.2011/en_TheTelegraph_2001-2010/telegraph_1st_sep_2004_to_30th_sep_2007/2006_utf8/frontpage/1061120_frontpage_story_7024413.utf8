 Security bar on Naveen neighbour

 SUBRAT DAS

 Bhubaneswar, Nov. 19: Security concerns for chief minister Naveen Patnaik have prevented a man from entering a plot he owns.

 Laxmidhar Mohanty (65), who retired from the office of the State Drugs Controller as driver, has paid a heavy price for choosing a property next to Naveen Niwas near the citys Biju Patnaik Airport.

 In 2000 the year Patnaik became chief minister and started residing permanently in Bhubaneswar Mohanty purchased a land (plot no 1212/ 2350, Bhimpur mouza) just behind Naveen Niwas. 

 Mohantys troubles began in 2004 when the Bhubaneswar Development Authority (BDA) barred him from building a house on the land citing technical reasons. 

 Cut to November 2006 and construction of a brick-walled sentry room in front of the entrance to Mohantys plot has all but dashed his hopes of having a house of his own.

 Its strange and unfortunate that I have been denied access to my own house site. I have been living in a city slum for the past six years with my family members, he said.

 After buying the land, Mohanty submitted a construction plan to the BDA, which approved the same on May 17, 2001. Since then it has been a roller-coaster ride for the former government driver. 

 If the authorities do not refrain from such illegal activities, I will sit on a dharna and fast unto death in front of the Assembly from tomorrow, Mohanty said.

 Khurda police superintendent Amitabh Thakur said sentry rooms were being built as part of the measures adopted to boost security in and around Naveen Niwas. 

 Khurda collector Narayan Jena said he had asked the subcollector and local tehsildar to look into the matter. The chief minister could not be contacted for comment.

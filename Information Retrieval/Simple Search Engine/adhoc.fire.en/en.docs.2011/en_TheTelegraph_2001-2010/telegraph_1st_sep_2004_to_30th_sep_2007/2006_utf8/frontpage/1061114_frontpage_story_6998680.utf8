 Anant (top), Naresh Gupta

 New Delhi, Nov. 13: Three-year-old Anant, son of a top official of a software company, was waiting with the maid for his school bus in front of his home when two men on a motorcycle stopped and whisked him away.

 Till the time of going to press, there was no news of Anant, whose father Naresh Gupta, the CEO of Adobe India, is out of the country.

 The family Anants mother and grandfather are here hadnt received a ransom note yet.

 Witnesses told police they saw two men both wearing helmets with darkened visors pick the pre-nursery student forcibly around 8.45 am in a posh locality of Noida. 

 The Gupta residence in Sector 15A has two full-time security guards who were at the gate when the incident occurred, the police said. 

 Each block in the sector also has additional security guards at the gates. The police are not ruling out involvement of the guards from a private security firm.

 Anants sister, Ankita, studies in the same school in Class III, but she had already left as her classes start at 8. 

 Seema, the maid who was with Anant, has been detained.

 She (the maid) says she was unable to stop the kidnappers, but we are questioning her. We cannot yet confirm any role she might have had to play in the kidnapping, N.B. Singh, inspector-general, Meerut range, said.

 Singh said the police had put up barricades on all routes out of Noida within an hour of receiving information of the kidnapping.

 We believe the kidnappers have not been able to take the boy out of Noida yet, he said.

 The police said the kidnappers had covered the bikes number plate, making identification slightly harder.

 Assistance from the special task force of Uttar Pradesh and Delhi police is being sought, Singh said.

 Anants father was in the US, but is on his way home. He should be back tomorrow morning, Kanchan Das, an Adobe spokesperson, said.

 The kidnapping is the latest in a spate of crimes on Delhis outskirts. A gang of taxi drivers is alleged to have killed 28 passengers travelling between Gurgaon and Delhi over the past three months.

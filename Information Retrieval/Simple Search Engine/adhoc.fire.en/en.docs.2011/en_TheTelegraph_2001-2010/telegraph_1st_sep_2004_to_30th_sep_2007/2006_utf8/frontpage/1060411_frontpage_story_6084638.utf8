 Subhas invites red card from EC

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta, April 10: On a football field Subhas Chakraborty would have invited a red card, but its not yet clear what the Election Commission will make of his second outburst.

 Action, if any, will be decided after the commission receives the report it has commissioned from the district magistrate of North 24-Parganas on the transport ministers comments at a public meeting at Dum Dum last night.

 Remember, the elections will soon be over. You have been appointed by the state government. Dont you have a responsibility towards that government? he had said, his comment addressed to a section of the police force which he accused of working in connivance with the commission.

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee was present at the meeting.

 Chakraborty is already on a yellow card for his first offence when he called state government officials drafted in for poll duty stooges of the commission. They (the election officials) are acting as the ECs stooges despite being on the state governments payroll.

 After an enquiry and a notice to the CPM, for which the party tendered an apology, the commission filed an FIR against Chakraborty.

 Neither the action ? nor the public disapproval from the chief minister ? has had a sobering impact on the CPM leader. Bhattacharjee had said after the first incident that Chakraborty had realised that he had made a mistake.

 Obviously not. This time, even Jyoti Basu, by whom Chakraborty swears, told The Telegraph his remarks were uncalled for. He has made a mistake. Weve already apologised to the EC for his earlier remarks. There was no need for him to make such comments. Were confident of winning this election ? peoples support is with us, Basu said.

 If lucky, Chakraborty will escape with a reprimand. If not, he could face forfeiture of his candidature.

 Bhattacharjee refused comment on last nights remarks. But at a meeting of the Left Front at the CPM state headquarters, he asked leaders not to provoke the commission.

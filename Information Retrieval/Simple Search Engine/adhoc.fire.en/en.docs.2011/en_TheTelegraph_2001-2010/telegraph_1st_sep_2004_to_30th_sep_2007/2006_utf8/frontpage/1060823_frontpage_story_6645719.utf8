 Wanted, cream to cure tension

 RABI BANERJEE

 Kalyani, Aug. 22: Now it can be told with authority that Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee does not need beauty cream.

 But what the chief minister needs badly is something the rest of modern-day world has found elusive.

 Please give me something that will ease my tension, Bhattacharjee told a meeting where he was offered a beauty cream to sample. I suffer from severe tension.

 The chief ministers fervent plea was addressed to a group of ayurveds and experts on medicinal plants who had gathered for the inauguration of an ayurveda college.

 The dam burst when the former vice-chancellor of Jadavpur University, Ashok Nath Basu, handed him a container of the beauty cream, made by researchers of the varsity. I dont know whether our chief minister uses beauty cream. But if he does, I am sure he will love it. It will make him look much more attractive, Basu said.

 But Bhattacharjee shook his head. Oh, what are you giving me! I dont need any beauty cream but please give me something which can ease my tension. I suffer terribly because of my tension. Please do something which will be really helpful to me, he said. 

 Bhattacharjee said he had discussed the problem with health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra, who is an allopath. Our health minister has advised me to remain close to greenery and rely more on ayurvedic medicine. I am trying to follow his advice as much as possible. 

 Palm Avenue, where the chief minister resides, has some tree-lined stretches. Nandan, once a favourite haunt of the playwright-cum-politician, has greenery. But ever since he became chief minister, Bhattacharjees evening visits there have become less frequent.

 Bhattacharjee did not specify the cause of his tension, though he has been nursing some headaches like land acquisition and cricket elections.

 But then, imagine the plight of a certain Manmohan Singh, who has to deal with Bhattacharjees comrade Prakash Karat, Natwar Singh and now Telengana spearhead K. Chandrashekhar Rao!

 Govt fights price rise

 OUR BUREAU 

 New Delhi, June 22: The government has banned export of pulses and allowed import of wheat, pulses and sugar by private traders to control prices.

 The decisions, taken despite divisions within the cabinet, were prompted by a suspicion in the Congress that agriculture minister Sharad Pawar is dragging his feet on reining in prices.

 Pulses export has been suspended till Diwali. 

 Wheat import will be allowed till the next rabi season and sugar till September when the new sugar crop is expected.

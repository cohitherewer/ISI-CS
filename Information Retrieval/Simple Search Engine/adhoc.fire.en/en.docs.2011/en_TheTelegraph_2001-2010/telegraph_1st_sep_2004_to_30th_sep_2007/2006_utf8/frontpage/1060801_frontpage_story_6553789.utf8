The Telegraph - Calcutta : Frontpage

 Silent winner mulls options

 - After and before victory, behind-the-scenes drama

 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Dalmiya: Wait amp; watch

 Calcutta, July 31: Unable to cope with numerous requests for interviews, Jagmohan Dalmiyas aides were planning a media conference around 6.30 this evening.

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees attack, though, scuppered that. Facing questions on whats good and whats evil would have been uncomfortable, to say the least.

 According to The Telegraphs sources, Dalmiya is unlikely to make any comment till at least Friday, when the CPM has its weekly state secretariat meeting.

 If the party endorses what Bhattacharjee said this afternoon, Dalmiya may consider announcing this will be his last year as Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) president.

 He has been in the chair from 1992-93 and more than proved a point by defeating Bhattacharjees candidate, city police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee, in yesterdays elections. 

 Dalmiya need not strive for more.

 If the CAB cookie does crumble that way, Dalmiya could move to heading the Board of Trustees, which is currently chaired by Chandi Ganguly, Snehashish and Souravs father.

 Dalmiya has to wait and watch? The post-AGM drama hasnt ended? However, running the CAB is going to be difficult if the states most powerful entity (Bhattacharjee) takes such a hostile stand, a well-placed source said.

 Bhattacharjee has exploded, but Mukherjee had been a sporting loser: last night, he accepted having been defeated in a free and fair poll.

 Its to be seen, incidentally, whether Dalmiyas victory reduces the pressure hes under within the Board of Control for Cricket in India. 

 For now, hes awaiting legal opinion on the fresh summons from its disciplinary committee. The rescheduled hearing is in Chennai on August 15. 

 Sourav, meanwhile, didnt react to the Dalmiya panels sweep.

 In the lead-up to the elections, Sourav had sent an email which obliquely crucified Dalmiya. Its another matter that it didnt help the challenger in any manner. 

 I dont have a comment on anything?. Neither on what John Wright has written in his book (Indian Summers) nor on the CAB elections, Sourav insisted when contacted in Northampton.

 Sourav wasnt aware of Bhattacharjees latest attack on Dalmiya, but became curious about what had been said. He preferred not to react, though, even after the gist was conveyed.

 Im not saying anything, except that Ill be back home on August 7, Sourav, whose stint with Northants has ended, signed off.

 Footnote: Late last night, Dalmiya took a dig at his one-time prot?g?, albeit obliquely: If anybody thinks emails can influence elections, then hes a baccha?.

 Kodas New Year resolution out

 SUDHIR KUMAR MISHRA 

 Koda

 Ranchi, Dec. 25: It was sort of a New Year resolution, in which strict implementation of the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA) is his primary challenge.

 Admitting that the execution of the NREGA has been dismal, chief minister Madhu Koda today virtually unveiled before The Telegraph his calendar of activities.

 To start with, to ensure thorough implementation of the NREGA, Koda has decided to complete appointment of two programme officers in every block and the rojgar sevaks in every panchayat, next month. A fresh survey of BPL families will be carried out and the government will provide BPL red cards to all.

 For smooth governance and to pave the way for new industries, a common minimum programme and the new rehabilitation policy, respectively, too, will be finalised in January. In February, he intends to fill all vacant posts of Grade III amp; IV employees. He claims the states staff selection commission will be constituted next month, and clarified that the domicile policy will not be a hurdle in the way of smooth appointment of employees though a pioneer of pro-domicile policy protests is now a powerful minister in his government. He hinted at revising the rules to a certain extent, in accordance with the countrys Constitution, to ensure maximum employment to local people. 

 In March-April, he is eyeing the appointment of 10,000 primary school teachers and in April-May, 2,000 police constables. He said he has already ordered payment of wages to minority teachers with immediate effect and revised dearness allowances to madarsa teachers. The teachers will start getting paid from January.

 Denying that Bandhu Tirkey was instigating people not to give their land to industrialists, Koda said: Mittal or anyone like him is free to sign MoUs with any government, but this does not mean my government is not willing to help them. Tirkey only demanded that every tribal be compensated adequately in lieu of their land. And he is very much involved in the finalisation of the rehabilitation policy.

 Koda was, however, categorical in saying that he never promised the road construction department to Anosh Ekka and energy to Stephen Marandi. Ministers should concentrate on the work already being given to them, instead of eyeing key departments, he added.

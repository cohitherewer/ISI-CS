 Off the blocks, with 83

 Dec. 7: Before setting out for South Africa as a Test specialist, Sourav Ganguly had acknowledged he was about to start his career all over again. That the past, even the 15,000-plus runs in ODIs and Tests, wouldnt mean too much when he took guard on wickets which wouldnt be batsman-friendly.

 Today, the former captain made a headline-grabbing beginning: an excellent 83 against Rest of South Africa in Potchefstroom. As important, the runs came when the team was in tatters 37 for three. 

 Im happy with this innings, but the real test begins after this match. Whats important is the Test series. Im more confident, though, Sourav told The Telegraph.

 Thanks to his partnership with Irfan Pathan, who struck the first century on tour, India finished the opening day on 316 for seven.

 Not that a berth for the first Test (Johannesburg, from December 15) was really in doubt, but Sourav needed a handsome start to remind the world particularly captain Rahul Dravid and coach Greg Chappell that he deserved to be in South Africa. 

 Also, that he had it in him to anchor instead of sliding with the rest.

 Unlike the last comeback (January-February tour of Pakistan), this one was without any message to the selectors from the boards brass. Still, it had to begin with a knock to minimise the pressures associated with a return to big-time cricket.

 Souravs innings has brought joy to well-wishers, including selection committee chairman Dilip Vengsarkar. Talking exclusively, the one-time captain said: Im very, very happy... Sourav, however, must continue with this form in the three-Test series.

 Vengsarkar, it may be recalled, more than just supported Sourav during last Thursdays selection meeting. Hes reaching South Africa on Monday morning.

 While Sourav and Pathan have provided cheer, the thinktank has to sweat over the opening combination. 

 Virender Sehwag, who flopped in the ODIs, failed again. Then, Wasim Jaffer (a duck in the first ODI) couldnt open his account at Sedgars Park either.

 The vice-captaincy has been taken away from Sehwag, but successor V.V.S. Laxman hasnt been doing anything. He didnt get off the mark in the final ODI and managed 23 today.

 Batting, which was Team Indias USP in the Sourav-John Wright era, is now the No. 1 worry. Its a strange game.

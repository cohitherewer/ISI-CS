 Bodo youth lynched

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Kokrajhar, April 15: Post-poll violence continued to rock the Bodo heartland of Assam with a youth being lynched in Kalaigaon Assembly constituency of Udalguri district last night.

 Police sources said the youth, Upen Boro, owed allegiance to the Hagrama Mohilary faction of the Bodoland Peoples Progressive Front and had gone with six other party workers to attack Bainari village under Kairabari police station. 

 Bainari happens to be the native village of Naturam Boro, a candidate of the rival Rabiram Narzary faction of the BPPF.

 The villagers of Bainari put up a strong fight and not only foiled the attack, but also chased the attackers. While the others managed to escape, Boro was caught and beaten to death. 

 Sources in the Mohilary camp alleged that Boro was brutally killed by Narzarys supporters. 

 Boros body was taken to Mangoldoi civil hospital for post-mortem. No one has been arrested so far. 

 Police sources said the two rival factions of the BPPF have been engaged in violent clashes since the polls. They have been attacking villages, torching houses and indulging in vandalism. 

 On April 12, four houses were set ablaze in Chetnaguri and Hasraobari and over a dozen houses vandalised at Elengmari, Sursakhata, Bwigribari and Nwinaguri in Kokrajhar district the next day. 

 On April 9, Lwithwma Borgoyari, a schoolteacher who was adviser to the Simbargaon unit of the All Bodo Students Union and a life member of the Bodo Sahitya Sabha, was brutally hacked to death. 

 Rajya Sabha member U.G. Brahma criticised the administration for the frenzy. The post-poll clashes between the two groups are continuing due to negligence on the part of the administration. We have made repeated requests for a solution and increased security. But the role of the administration has not been satisfactory. 

 Brahma said the deputy commissioner had also been requested to organise a flag march by security forces in the sensitive areas, but this had not been heeded to either.

 District administration officials, however, said the police had been put on high alert and the situation was under control.

 Kampa Borgoyary, spokesperson for the Mohilary faction, appealed to the people to foil all attempts to derail peace and harmony. It is the duty and responsibility of all parties and organisations to build a peaceful atmosphere by burying the hatchet in the greater interest of peace, unity and integrity, he said.

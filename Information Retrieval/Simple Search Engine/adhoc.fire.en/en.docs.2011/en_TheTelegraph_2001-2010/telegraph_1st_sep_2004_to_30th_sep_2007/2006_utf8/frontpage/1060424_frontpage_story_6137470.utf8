 Mumbai, April 23: After a flicker of eyes and some movement of the fingers when son Rahul visited him, Pramod Mahajan was wheeled into the operation theatre as doctors noticed instability in vital parameters.

 According to a doctor attending on him, there was fluid build-up in the liver that was struck by a bullet fired by brother Praveen yesterday.

 During the operation, the pressure packs on the liver were removed. There was no active bleeding from the liver. After the operation, there was improvement in his vital parameters. Mahajan is stable, but in a critical condition, said Hinduja hospital spokesman Anupam Verma. 

 Earlier, his son Rahul had said after a visit: I told him Papa, you are going to recover from this. The glint in papas eyes and slight movement of fingers kindled our hopes. 

 The Mahajan family has flown down to Mumbai the UK-based specialist, Dr Mohammed Rela, a veteran of some 800 liver transplants to supervise his treatment. Dr Rela figures in the Guinness Book of World Records for performing a liver transplant on a five-day-old infant.

 The body language of some of the BJP leaders, who kept up a steady stream to the hospital, appeared to share the optimism expressed by the doctors. The hospital bulletin issued at 11 am said there was gradual recovery overnight in Mahajans condition. 

 In the 5 pm update, Verma said: Oozing of blood had reduced significantly, but his condition continues to be critical. We have decided to perform an operation to remove the packs put on to stop the bleeding.

 At the time, the surgery was to be conducted tomorrow. Barely an hour and a half later, the doctors noticed changes in Mahajans condition. 

 Verma said: It was decided to operate after his vital parameters were seen to be unstable. The instability was caused by the increase in the abdominal pressure, leading to pressure on the ventilator.

 Arjun twist

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh says one thing, HRD minister Arjun Singh says another.

 In Srinagar, Manmohan said: The government will find a viable and credible way to protect the interest of all sections of society.

 This seems to suggest an increase in the number of seats along with introduction of the quota.

 Arjun doesnt think so. He said in a TV interview: There is no relation between reservation and increasing number of seats.

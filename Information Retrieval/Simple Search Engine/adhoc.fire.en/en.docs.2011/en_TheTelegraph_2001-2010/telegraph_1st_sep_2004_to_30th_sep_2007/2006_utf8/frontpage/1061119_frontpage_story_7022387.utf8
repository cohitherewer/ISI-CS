 2 students dead in Assam firing 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Morigaon, Nov. 18: Three persons, including two school students, were killed and 17 others seriously injured after police fired on a mob which torched the local police station at Moirabari, 30 km from Morigaon town, late this afternoon. 

 The Morigaon unit of the All Assam Students Union (AASU) has called a 12-hour bandh on Monday in protest against todays incident. Morigaon deputy commissioner Sabbir Hussain said departmental proceedings have been initiated against officer in charge of Moirabari police station S. Medhi. It will be decided tomorrow whether he will be suspended or not, he added.

 Residents of Moirabari, along with students of local educational institutions, attacked the police station to rescue a couple of students from police custody. 

 The two higher secondary students had allegedly knocked down an old man riding a cycle. 

 Sources in Moirabari police said the crowd pelted stones at the police station for half-an-hour and tried to set the main office ablaze. 

 This compelled the police to fire at the crowd to control the situation. The firing was followed by a stampede. The drama unfolded between 1 pm and 2.30 pm, sources added. 

 Morigaon deputy superintendent of police S.N. Patawari said the casualties could rise as some villagers, including a few employees of the police station, are still untraced. 

 A fire-tender was damaged and firemen assaulted. Curfew was imposed this evening after Section 144 failed to improve the situation. 

 Those killed in the incident include Hipjur Rahman, a 13-year-old student of Moirabari High Madrasa, Rekibul Islam, a Class II student of Moirabari Markaj Academy and Amirul Hoque, a 30-year-old barber. Eight persons, mostly local students, sustained bullet injuries. 

 Additional deputy commissioner P.B. Nath will probe the fracas. The report will be submitted within 48 hours, Hussain said. 

 Following chief minister Tarun Gogois orders, food and civil supplies minister Nazrul Islam and forest minister Rockybul Hussain have rushed to the spot.

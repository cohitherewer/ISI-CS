 Patients fine

 SATISH NANDGAONKAR

 Navapur, Feb. 22: The Maharashtra government said this evening that all the nine patients in Navapur were perfectly healthy as of now.

 We are yet to receive the reports from the NIV (National Institute of Virology) lab in Pune. As far as symptoms of bird flu go, it is not necessary that all bird flu human infections result in mortality. All the nine patients at Navapur hospital are perfectly healthy as of now, Dr Pramod Doke, the director of state health services, told The Telegraph.

 The Navapur administration has decided to restrict movement of people. The borders will be monitored to control as much human traffic as possible. Vehicles will be allowed to pass through Navapur but passengers would not be allowed to alight without precautions.

 An order has also been issued to quarantine an area up to three km from the last infected poultry farm.

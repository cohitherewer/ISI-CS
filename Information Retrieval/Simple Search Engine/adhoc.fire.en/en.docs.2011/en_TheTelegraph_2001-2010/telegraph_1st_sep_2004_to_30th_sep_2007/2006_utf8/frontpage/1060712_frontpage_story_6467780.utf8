 Tourism terror revisits Bengal 

 OUR BUREAU

 Srinagar/ Calcutta, July 11: Kamala Bhattacharya lost her daughter as a bomb exploded in a bus carrying pilgrims from Bengal, killing six of them, at Dal Gate in Srinagar.

 The explosion, which was a repeat of the two blasts of May 31 that killed a Calcuttan ? even the site was the same ? was one of five that rocked the Kashmir capital today and left eight dead.

 At the site of the fifth blast ? the tourist reception centre taxi stand ? in which 15 were injured, cab drivers caught a man they claimed had thrown the grenade, Mohammad Afzal Rather, and handed him to police.

 My daughter and son-in-law died in front of my eyes. We were talking to each other and seconds after that I saw them lying still in pools of blood, Kamala said on phone from SMHS Hospital, where the injured are admitted.

 Her daughter Chhaya, 42, son-in-law Sandip Bhattacharya, 45, and his mother Pratima, 65, had come to Calcutta a few days ago from Hyderabad where they lived. Sandip worked for the railways.

 I was sitting on a single seat on the right side and three of them were on the left side. Soon after we started, I heard a deafening sound and then saw them lying on the seats, the resident of Gorachand Road, Park Circus, said.

 Sandips sister Kaberi Ghosh Roy, 48, of Dum Dum Park, was also killed. 

 The family, including Kaberis husband Ashis, had travelled as part of the group that reached Srinagar yesterday and had planned to visit Amarnath and Vaishno Devi.

 A bomb was lobbed into the mini-bus that was taking them to Chandanwari, from where they were to walk to Amarnath tomorrow, just after it started at 11 am.

 Purabi Das Majumdar, 47, of Dum Dum Park, and her husbands sister Bandana Haldar, 67, of Baguiati, were the two other pilgrims killed.

 Twelve others, including seven tourists, were injured, S.M. Sahai, inspector-general of police, Kashmir zone, said.

 A family from Haryana on way to Amarnath had a close shave when a grenade exploded under their car at Regal Chowk on Residency Road. 

 Two blasts occurred in quick succession at the city centre Lal Chowk and in nearby Abi Guzar. Two persons, including a labourer from Bihar, died and 17 were wounded.

 Security cloak in place

 OUR BUREAU

 Guwahati/Jorhat, Dec. 30: Dispur has brought the entire state under comprehensive security cover to thwart Ulfas plans to carry out attacks on New Years eve. 

 The outfits aim is to spark panic in the run-up to Republic Day and the National Games. 

 Security has been beefed up following sensational revelations by some arrested Ulfa top guns about the decision of the outfits leadership to go in for a massive show of stre-ngth over the next few days. 

 In Guwahati, every person entering the city is being frisked and every vehicle scanned for explosives and arms. We have put our security forces on maximum alert to thwart Ulfa attacks, particularly in crowded places and at other vital installations which militants tend to target in the run-up to Republic Day, a senior police official disclosed. 

 Our intensified vigil yielded results, when an Ulfa hitman, identified as Gokul Nath, was apprehended from Bamunimaidam in Chandmari police station area last night, the officer said. Nath was involved in some recent explosions in the city. 

 Police sources said a court today remanded Nath in police custody for six days. The 22-year-old rebel hails from Paneri in Udalguri district. 

 Police are keeping a close watch on the Guwahati-Shillong Road as it is suspected that Ulfa militants from Upper Assam could sneak into the city through this route instead of National Highway 37 with the aim of hoodwinking the security forces. 

 We are keeping an eye on the Guwahati-Shillong Road and are also in touch with our Meghalaya counterparts. We have information that some hardcore cadre of Ulfas 28th battalion might sneak in from Meghalaya, the officer said. 

 It has also come to light that after carrying out strikes in the city, they escape to Bangladesh or Karbi Anglong through Shillong, he added. 

 The army has also started area domination exercises in districts adjoining the city.

 Road mishaps: Kalu Sheikh, 45, was killed while two others were injured today when a vehicle knocked them down on National Highway 31 at Sonakuli in Golokganj, reports our Dhubri correspondent. 

 Tilak Bora, 50, died after being run over by a truck at Bebejia today, reports our Nagaon correspondent.

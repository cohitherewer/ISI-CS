 Subhas whiff of deal with Dalmiya

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, June 22: If Jagmohan Dalmiya agrees not to contest the Cricket Association of Bengal presidents post, he might win the Bengal governments support in his fight against the Board of Control for Cricket in India.

 Sports minister Subhas Chakraborty said he would ask the chief minister to intervene if it was found the BCCI was doing injustice to Dalmiya.

 Dalmiya has given me a set of papers on court cases. But I have not gone through them yet. Though the state government will not be a party to a case, the chief minister will see if there is anything he can do, Chakraborty said.

 Dalmiya is worried about the fate of these cases if he is out of CAB, he added.

 Dalmiya today called a meeting of CAB members on July 2 to ascertain their opinion on his contesting or otherwise. He will know then what kind of support he can expect if he decides to contest.

 Chakraborty said: The chief minister asked me to persuade Dalmiya to stay away and I have done my duty. I will not say whether it is right or wrong, whether Dalmiya is good or bad, I have done what the chief minister asked me to do. I acted as his loyal soldier.

 Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee refused to comment on the Dalmiya issue. I dont want to drag it on, he said.

 Asked why Bhattacharjee wanted Dalmiya out, Chakraborty replied: The chief minister is the head of the state?. He works with a broad perspective and has to serve the interests of the people of the entire state. If he feels it necessary to make a change in CAB, he definitely has a valid reason.

 I may personally like Dalmiya but when the chief minister does not want Dalmiya, I must echo his sentiments. I am a soldier working under his command.

 Not every member of the Left Front thinks so. RSP leader and PWD minister Kshiti Goswami said: CAB is an autonomous body which can decide who should or should not contest its election. How can the government have an opinion on this?

 Subhas (Chakraborty) has only done his duty by passing on the chief ministers message to Dalmiya, Goswami said, adding he wasnt siding with Dalmiya.

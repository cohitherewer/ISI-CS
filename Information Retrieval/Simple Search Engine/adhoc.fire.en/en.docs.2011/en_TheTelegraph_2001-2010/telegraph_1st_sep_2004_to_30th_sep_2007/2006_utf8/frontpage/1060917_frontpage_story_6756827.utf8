 Myanmar to share intelligence

 MANAN KUMAR

 New Delhi, Sept. 16: India and Myanmar today agreed to share real time intelligence on issues related to security, drug trafficking, arms smuggling and militant activities during talks at the Union home secretary level. This was the 12th round of parleys.

 As a result of sharing real time intelligence, the army, police and intelligence agencies of both countries will now convey information to their counterparts whenever they come to know about any movement related to drug traffickers, arms smugglers or insurgents. A mechanism for sharing such information will now be devised. 

 After signing the joint statement with his counterpart, Brig. Gen. Phone Swe, Union home secretary V.K. Duggal described the talks as very successful. He added that both sides have agreed to pursue security and other related issues in a time-bound manner and have agreed to tighten security at the border to curb the menace arising out of drug trafficking and arms smuggling. 

 The two sides have also agreed to conduct joint interrogation of people lodged in jails of the two countries to help the innocent get justice and prosecute those who are indulging in illegal activities, such as drug trafficking and arms smuggling. 

 Official sources said Delhi also provided a list of 15 camps belonging to Indian militant outfits, along with proof, to the Myanmarese delegation. India claimed that camps belonging to outfits such as Ulfa, the Peoples Liberation Army (PLA), the United National Liberation Front (UNLF) and the Khaplang and Isak-Muivah factions of the National Socialist council of Nagaland have bases in Myanmar and are carrying out activities inimical to Indias interests from there. 

 The joint press communiqu said the deliberations have further deepened the understanding between the two countries, particularly on issues relating to security, drug trafficking and effective border management.

 Sources said both sides have also agreed to carry out a joint survey to demarcate the disputed area on the international border in Chandel district of Manipur. The joint survey on the 28-km stretch is slated to begin next month by the departments of the surveyors-general of both the countries.

 In a related development, Mizoram chief minister Zoramthanga also met the Union home secretary while the talks between the two countries were going on. Zoramthanga demanded immediate fencing of the 510-km-long border with Myanmar. 

 Zoramthanga claimed that fencing on the boundary with Bangladesh should be prioritised if the Centre wanted to stop drug trafficking and arms smuggling, which are continuing unabated in the districts of Mizoram bordering Myanmar.

 Promising action, the home ministry has asked the chief minister to submit a detailed proposal in this regard, said a senior ministry official. 

 The Indian team also gave a proposal to the Myanmarese delegation to open eight more border outposts on the international border in Mizoram, Nagaland and Manipur apart from the existing ones at Moreh in Manipur and Zowkhatar in Mizoram. 

 But Myanmars delegation agreed to open only one more border outpost at Pangsau in Arunachal Pradesh, though it agreed to look into the proposal regarding other outposts.

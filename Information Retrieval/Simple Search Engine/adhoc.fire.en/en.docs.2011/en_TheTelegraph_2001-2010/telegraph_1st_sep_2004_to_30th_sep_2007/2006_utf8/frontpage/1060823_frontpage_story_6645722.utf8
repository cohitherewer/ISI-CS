 Delhi breather for colas 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 22: Health minister Anbumani Ramadoss today said the Centre for Science and Environments report on pesticides in colas was inconclusive and two Indian laboratories disagreed with the NGOs findings. 

 Ramadosss statement assumes significance as several states, including Bengal, had said the Centre should take the final decision to ban Coca-Cola and Pepsi.

 The ministers remarks in the Lok Sabha drew a sharp response from CSE director Sunita Narain, who charged him with colluding with the cola companies.

 In the House, while replying to a question, Ramadoss had termed Narain a good friend and thanked the CSE for its efforts. We are not contradicting the report, he said, but added: The report is inconclusive.

 Ramadoss said his ministry had asked for more information from the CSE, which, he felt, was likely to be made available in a matter of days.

 He said that after the CSE report was made public, states were asked to test samples of colas. So far, 14 states had lifted 200 samples. The samples sent to labs in Gujarat and Mysore had shown no pesticide residues above the permissible level.

 There are no official permissible levels now as the draft norms are yet to be notified. The minister said comprehensive standards on pesticides in colas would be in place by early 2007.

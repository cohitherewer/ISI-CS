 Tata rival

 OUR BUREAU

 Nov. 17: Ratan Tata was today thrown a challenge to his bid to take over Corus when Brazils CSN made a counter-offer.

 CSN valued Corus at $8.5 billion as opposed to the Tatas $8.1 billion. It offered to pay 475 pence per ordinary Corus share in cash, compared with the Tata price of 455 pence.

 The move comes 17 days before Corus shareholders vote on the Tata offer.

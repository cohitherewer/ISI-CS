 Port of Spain, May 27: Iconic sports psychologist Dr Rudi Webster has a job on his hands: he has to ensure the Indians shoulders dont droop in the manner they did last evening when the West Indies (a team he was once closely associated with) won the fourth ODI and the series with lots ? six wickets and as many overs ? to spare. 

 While the Indians presented a lousy picture, West Indies captain Brian Lara was in high spirits at the Queens Park Oval. So much so he took questions from the media (including The Telegraph) for well over 20 minutes. 

 Lara was as classy as hed been on the field while getting his first 50 of the series. 

 The following are excerpts:

 On the series victory

 Nobody gave us a chance before the series, but we played very good cricket... In fact, weve beaten India in the mental game, too... If we leave out a few regulars and still beat India on Sunday, that will show our World Cup preparations are on track...

 On plans to celebrate

 Its on hold till Sunday.

 On tomorrows match

 Its not without meaning and not without importance. 

 On the second series win in a row (first being versus Zimbabwe) under his captaincy

 I would have been happier had the West Indies won under some other captain... That would have been ideal... Its nice, but my feet are on the ground.

 On leadership within the team

 For a team to grow, the players have to be leaders... Its important to have the ingredients of leadership and Ive been doing my bit to develop leaders... 

 On Indias performance

 They arrived as the No.3 team and we respect them... The absence of Sachin Tendulkar probably made a difference, but then thats one player were talking about... Despite this result, the Indians are going to start favourites in the Test series as well... Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singh bowling together... 

 On Greg Chappells comment that the West Indies have forgotten to win after the first ODI

 The boys took note of it... It was a very sly remark... He might be right, but hasnt been over the past week... I accept we havent always capitalised on chances, though.

 On whether Dwayne Bravos wicket-taking slower one to Yuvraj Singh, in the second ODI, will be remembered as the series defining moment

 Well, I hadnt been happy with the previous two balls in that last over! For me, the defining moment has been (Ramnaresh) Sarwans unbeaten 98 in that very match... 

 On the West Indies preparations for the series

 We worked a lot... Worked in the classroom and had a plan for every Indian... We executed very well in the last three matches... 

 On the 90-minute team meeting on the eve of the fourth ODI

 (Laughs) We dont always time meetings... I told the boys that the Indians have their backs to the wall and are going to rely on key players to pull them through... I asked each one to contribute, so that a team effort would nullify (any individual brilliance from India)... Everybody responded, even Corey Colleymore who played for the first time in the series, and we were very professional.

 On what he keeps telling players

 That opportunities have to be grasped... That if you see a Sir Gary Sobers or a Clive Lloyd, talk cricket with them... One must keep learning... When a (Shivnarine) Chanderpaul speaks at team meetings, the youngsters have an opportunity to take lessons from his experience.

 On the fantastic support from fans across the Caribbean

 Even when we lost the opening ODI (on the penultimate ball), people still wished us luck... They kept faith... They could see wed fought, that wed thrown our body behind the ball... We havent let them down. 

 On rotating players

 It keeps everybody involved and on their toes. I think its better to work from a pool of, say, 20 players not just 11-12. 

 On whether he was overcome with emotion on taking the field 

 It will be so on Sunday... Its going to be special... It will be momentous as I wont again play a one-dayer on a ground where Im familiar with every blade of grass...

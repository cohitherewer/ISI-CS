 Tinsukia planter killed by Ulfa

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Dibrugarh, Sept. 23: Ulfa militants tonight shot dead a tea garden manager in Tinsukia district, a day after killing a policeman in adjacent Dibrugarh.

 Tinsukia police said manager Haren Das of Hoolonghabi tea estate, located under Digboi police station, was shot dead from close range after he was called out of his official residence by a group of rebels.

 Ulfa had demanded Rs 12 lakh from the garden authorities and the killing appeared to be the result of the gardens refusal to accede to the demand, a police official said. Dibrugarh-based businessman Rajiv Baruah owns the tea garden. 

 An army source said Ulfa has also slapped a Rs 1-crore demand on a multi-national company, which owns several gardens in Dibrugarh. However, police denied having any information of this. A tea industry source said unless the garden authorities file an FIR, police will not be able to give an official confirmation. 

 There were also reports of abduction of two tea garden executives from Dibrugarh district earlier in the day, but police refused to confirm this. Todays incident and the killing of the policeman have given a new twist to the sputtering peace process between the outfit and the Centre, facilitated by Mamoni Raisom Goswami .

 Doctors debunk suicide theory 

 ARUN KUMAR THAKUR

 Ranchi, 

 Oct. 10: Doctors and medical students at RIMS demanded 

 a CBI inquiry into the death of Dr Chanchal Kumar Nandi 

 at a condolence meeting here today.

 Nandi (27), described as a bright, young doctor, allegedly committed suicide along with his mother and elder brother at Uttarpara near Calcutta on Dussehra. Their bodies were discovered three days later. The police found a suicide note, which stated that nobody should be blamed for their death, though no motive was mentioned.

 Chanchal was preparing to join Christian Medical College, Vellore, for an MD, said his teachers at RIMS today. He belonged to a financially well-off family. He had his own laptop and digital camera and had saved as much as Rs 8 lakh, said some of his friends.

 Referring to a doctor at Uttarpara quoted in news reports as saying that Chanchal had visited him to discuss about an unmentionable disease, the deceaseds friends expressed their shock. Chanchal, they claimed, was a regular donor of blood and they were not aware of any such disease. They would like the police to match the handwriting on the suicide note with Chanchals and scrutinise the mobile phones of the brothers.

 A brilliant student and apparently popular among faculty and students, he had turned down job offers from Leprosy Mission of India as well as from the Bhilai Steel Plant of SAIL. He was not keen on private practice and wanted to get an MD, said his peers and juniors alike.

 Dr A.K. Singh, head of the department of skin and venereal diseases, recalled that Chanchal had called on him on September 5. He had secured 75 per cent marks and a distinction in his PG diploma in VD and dermatology. The day he appeared for his viva voce, Nandi was apparently talked about on the RIMS campus as all the three external examiners wanted to confer a degree, rather than a diploma, on him.

 A lively person, a good orator with interests in theatre and full of life, is how batchmate Pradeep remembered him. He had also won several gold medals. Why would he end his life?

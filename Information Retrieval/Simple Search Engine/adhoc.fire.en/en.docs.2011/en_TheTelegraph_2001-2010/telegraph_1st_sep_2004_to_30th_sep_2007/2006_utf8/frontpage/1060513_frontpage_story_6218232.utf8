 MP jailed for rape

 Calcutta/Purulia, May 12: Forward Bloc MP Bir Singh Mahata was jailed for 10 years today for a rape committed 24 years ago.

 With three associates, Mahata, then a secretariat member of the partys Purulia unit, gangraped a housewife in November 1982.

 He was chargesheeted the following year, but the case remained buried for over two decades until a fast-track court dug it up last September. 

The Purulia district court today also sent Mahatas 

three associates to jail for 10 years and fined them Rs 5,000 each.

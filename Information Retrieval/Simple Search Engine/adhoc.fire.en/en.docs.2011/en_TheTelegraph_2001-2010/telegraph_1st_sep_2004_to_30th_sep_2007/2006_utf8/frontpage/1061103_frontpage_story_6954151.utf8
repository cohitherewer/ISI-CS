 Fair or foul? Buddha junks Maidan promises for book business show

 A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta, Nov. 2: After promising in 2003 to move all exhibitions out of the Maidan to a new complex and extracting a permission from the court to hold the Book Fair there for one last time in the winter of 2006, the chief minister today staged a somersault.

 Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said his government wanted the Maidan to be the permanent venue for hosting the book fair, though Calcutta High Court had allowed it to be held for the last time on the green patch known as the citys lungs on the governments specific assurance that it would be moved in 2007.

 Although The Telegraph had reported earlier that the government had decided to again seek the courts permission to hold the book fair on the Maidan, today the chief minister publicly expressed that intention. He said the fair was an important cultural event and an internationally recognised one, adding that the government would petition the court.

 Would this be the last time such a request would be made? No. He wanted the fair for ever on the Maidan. For the sake of the city, hopefully the court will agree.

 There are some, including high court judges, not to speak of environmentalists, who feel that for the sake of the city all fairs should be moved away to save the Maidan.

 Yesterday, the army, the custodian of the grounds, declined permission to hold the fair, prompting the government to approach the court. Bhattacharjee has also started pulling political strings in Delhi to get the armys No turned into a Yes.

 I just spoke to Pranabbabu (former defence minister and now foreign minister). In the past also Ive sought his cooperation for the fair. We had wanted to move a petition before the high court jointly with the army. It would have worked if all parties had cooperated and moved a joint petition, Bhattacharjee said.

 He requested Mukherjee to plead the fairs case with new defence minister A.K. Antony.

 Last evening, Deepak Raj, the GOC Bengal, had walked out of a meeting with the government at Writers Buildings, saying that the army would not allow the fair. 

 The high court has said there should be no fairs on the Maidan. Our stand remains the same. We wont issue a no-objection certificate, Raj had said.

 In the past, however, the army has been forced to back off under political pressure. 

 Environment activist Subhas Dutta, who had filed a number of PILs over the Maidans abuse, said he would submit a petition opposing the governments move.

 Bhattacharjee sought to appease the green lobby. He said: We will tell the court that the fair will not disturb the ecology.

 There was no mention of the promise to build a permanent complex to host all fairs. Thats how fairs are held in other cities.

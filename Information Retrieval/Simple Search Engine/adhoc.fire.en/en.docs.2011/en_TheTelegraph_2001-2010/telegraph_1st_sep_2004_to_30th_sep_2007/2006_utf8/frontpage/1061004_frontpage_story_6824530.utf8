 Afzal plea

 New Delhi, Oct. 3: The family of Mohammad Afzal, on death row in the Parliament attack case, has filed a mercy petition with the President.

 The home ministry will scrutinise the petition, which raises the possibility of the hanging originally scheduled for October 20 being postponed till a decision is taken. The ministrys recommendation will be taken up by the cabinet before being forwarded to the President.

 Afzals family, led by his 36-year-old wife Tabasum, is hopeful his sentence may be commuted to life imprisonment.

 We do not want the mercy plea to be made a political issue. The case was made political by all and I am on the verge of losing my husband, she said.

 Slack Nagaland irks SC

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 11: The Supreme Court today expressed disappointment over Nagaland not showing interest in ending its lingering boundary disputes with Assam and Arunachal Pradesh.

 Chief Justice Y.K. Sabharwal observed that Nagaland had not responded to its September 2004 order, directing the three states to pledge in writing that it would co-operate with the boundary commission it intended to constitute to end the triangular boundary disputes. 

 A long time has passed since the order was given and Nagaland has yet to file any response, the court said. 

 The Chief Justice said the Nagaland government should have filed an affidavit explaining its difficulties, if any. He pointed out that Assam and Arunachal Pradesh had already filed their affidavits. 

 The bench directed the Neiphiu Rio government to file an affidavit within two weeks. Senior counsel K.K. Venugopal, representing Assam, accused Nagaland of removing boundary posts.

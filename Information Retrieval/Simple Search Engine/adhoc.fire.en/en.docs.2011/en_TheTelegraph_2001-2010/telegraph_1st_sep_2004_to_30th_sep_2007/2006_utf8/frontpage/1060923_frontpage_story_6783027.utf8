 Wet month

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta, Sept. 22: If April is the cruellest month, September is the time of depressions.

 Over the past three decades, September rains in Calcutta have led to a deluge on at least two earlier occasions in 1978 and 1999. And now.

 The record is held by 1978 when Calcutta was flooded following nearly 380 mm of rain on September 27 in 24 hours. The second highest September rainfall recorded was Fridays 211.6 mm. 

 The third highest was in 1999 when it rained 192.4 mm on September 24. All three in the last 10 days of September.

 Whenever it rains excessively in September, there is waterlogging. There is a reason, said G.C. Debnath, of the Alipore Met office.

 After the monsoon starts in June, it rains for three months. The soil is saturated with water. All the natural reservoirs are full. That is why the roads are flooded quickly, he added.

 What about depressions? It is just coincidental that some depressions have formed in end-September, said an official.

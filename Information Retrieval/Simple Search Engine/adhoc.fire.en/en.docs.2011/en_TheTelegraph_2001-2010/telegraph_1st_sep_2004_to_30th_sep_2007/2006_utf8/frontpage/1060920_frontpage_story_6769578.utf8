 Pervez sees Kashmir solution

 K.P. NAYAR

 Washington, Sept. 19: Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf told the UN General Assembly on its opening day today that a solution to the Kashmir dispute was within reach as the result of his meeting with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in Havana this week.

 He did not spell out any details of the solution that was within reach, but described Jammu and Kashmir as the source of tension between India and Pakistan.

 In a 15-minute speech that was once again devoid of any attacks on India, Musharraf, however, implicitly came out against the Indo-US nuclear deal. 

 Pakistan cannot accept any discrimination in the nuclear field, he said, adding that his country would pursue its quest for nuclear technology for power generation, which the Americans are obviously denying him. He said Pakistans demand for nuclear power was legitimate.

 Musharraf told the General Assembly that Pakistan wanted a strategic restraint regime in South Asia, which envisaged a minimum nuclear deterrent and a balance of conventional forces in the region.

 On the defensive against charges 

 that Pakistan was hunting the terrorists and running with 

 them at the same time, he spoke at length about his governments 

 anti-terrorist measures.

 Mumbai, Jan. 25: Suspended encounter specialist Daya Nayak and wife Komal made a surprise appearance today at the Mumbai sessions court which gave the couple interim anticipatory bail till January 27. 

 Nayak, wanted in a disproportionate assets case, had gone underground after raids last week. 

 His mentor-turned-rival Pradeep Sharma, another fallen police hero, was granted interim anticipatory bail by another judge in connection with the custody death of a Ghatkopar blast accused in 2003. 

 Nayak and Sharma, working as a team with the crime branch special squad, had gunned down at least 80 gangsters in encounters.

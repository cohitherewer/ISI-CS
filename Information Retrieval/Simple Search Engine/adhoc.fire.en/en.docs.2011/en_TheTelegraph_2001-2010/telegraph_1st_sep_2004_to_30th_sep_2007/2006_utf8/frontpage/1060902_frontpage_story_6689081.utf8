 JSCA slaps contempt on board 

 CHANDRAJIT MUKHERJEE

 Ranchi, Sept. 1: The row over the affiliation of Jharkhand State Cricket Association (JSCA) deepened today with the state body filing a contempt petition against the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) for allegedly violating orders of the high court.

 The association moved the petition in Jharkhand High Court, claiming that BCCI had taken a decision on affiliation of the JSCA contrary to the orders of the court, which had asked the board to maintain status quo.

 The case was taken up by the division bench of Acting Chief Justice M.Y. Eqbal and Justice Permod Kohli in a courtroom filled with advocates and sportspersons, including former Indian cricketer Kirti Azad. 

 BCCI advocate Ravi Shankar Prasad, a BJP Rajya Sabha member, refuted the JSCAs allegations that it had flouted orders of the high court.

 Prasad said the order had been wrongly interpreted and twisted by the Jharkhand association to frame the board in a false case. 

 The court, he argued, while hearing the writ filed by JSCA had merely observed that the board could take any decision regarding affiliation of the Jharkhand association, pending a final order.

 The JSCA is cut up with the board for accepting the recommendations of the Arun Jaitley Committee, which proposed that cricket in Bihar and Jharkhand should be governed by the panel that was in charge prior to bifurcation in 2000. 

 Prasad today said the board had merely voiced its decision, and not implemented it, because the matter was sub judice. BCCI, he said, in fact wants to seek permission of the high court to implement the decision.

 JSCA counsel Jitender Singh contended that the BCCI, having taken its decision to de-recognise the state cricket body, had forbidden the association from participating in board meetings. 

 The board has not allowed JSCA officials to attend its meetings, which, according to Singh, goes to show that the board has already implemented its decision in violation of the orders of the court.

 The JSCA has also moved an amendment petition to direct the BCCI to allow officials entry to meetings.

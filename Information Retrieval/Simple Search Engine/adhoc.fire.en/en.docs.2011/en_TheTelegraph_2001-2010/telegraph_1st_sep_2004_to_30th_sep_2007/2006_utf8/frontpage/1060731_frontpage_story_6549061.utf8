The Telegraph - Calcutta : Frontpage

 Ive been fair: Wright

 - Ex-coach keeps lid on some views on Sourav

 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 John Wright

 Calcutta, July 30: Years 

 ago, a leading publication wrote that John Geoffrey Wright, 

 now 52, had the most beautiful manners of his generation. 

 Essentially, that he was a pucca gentleman.

 The former New Zealand captain, perhaps, became even more of a gentleman during his four-and-a-half years as Team India coach.

 Wright rarely gave one-on-ones to the media and, even when he did, made sure no feathers got ruffled.

 Clearly, everything about him was understated. 

 Off-the-record, however, Wright did open up quite a bit. One such instance being when he spoke to The Telegraph (in Delhi) on his penultimate day as coach ? April 16, 2005.

 Much of that centred on three seniors and leadership.

 Extracts from his book, Indian Summers, have created a storm. His quotes that evening, though, were more explosive. 

 I sought Wrights permission to use the off-the-record bits, particularly as hed already raised the leadership issue in his book, but he declined. 

 Wright, however, did speak for around 20 minutes when contacted in Christchurch this afternoon.

 The following are excerpts:

 The Telegraph: Congratulations, 

 youre now an author, too?

 John Wright: (Laughs) Dont 

 know whether becoming one is such a good thing!

 TT: When did you decide 

 to write Indian Summers?

 JW: One of the publishers 

 (in New Zealand) approached me eight-nine months ago? Thats 

 when it all started. 

 TT:You were maintaining 

 a diary during your years with Team India?

 JW: Off and on, not every 

 day? Id also been storing a few things in my laptop? 

 Id done the same during my years as Kents coach.

 TT:A news agency 

 reported Sourav Ganguly-specific extracts from your book 

 yesterday and that has made headlines. Your reaction?

 JW: I wasnt aware? 

 Look, people should read the entire book before concluding 

 anything? Just going by bits and pieces wont be fair 

 either to me or to the person Ive written about? (After 

 a pause) I believe Ive been fair and, overall, its 

 a book which shows Indian cricket in a positive light. Its 

 constructive and I havent set out to lose the many 

 friends I made during my years in India. 

 TT:Now that youve 

 written about Sourav and the captaincy, can I go public 

 with your private views on leadership? 

 JW: No? Please let that 

 remain between friends? (Again, after a pause) Sourav and 

 I had some great times, but there also were moments of disappointment? 

 Towards the end of our partnership, the results had dried 

 up and it was a time for change? I was, in any case, leaving?

 TT: Is it possible 

 for Sourav to make a comeback?

 JW: For his sake, I hope 

 he does? The only way for anybody to strengthen his case 

 is to get runs? Sourav may not have got big runs for Northants, 

 but the good thing is that he hasnt spent the summer 

 at home. 

 TT: How often did 

 Sourav seek your help to rectify shortcomings as a batsman?

 JW: Sourav has been a great 

 player? His record (over 15,000 runs in Tests and ODIs) 

 is testimony to that? Yet, all batsmen have strengths and 

 weaknesses? Sourav was concerned about his batting, but 

 a coach cant go beyond trying to iron out deficiencies. 

 TT: Are you aware 

 that Sourav obliquely attacked Jagmohan Dalmiya in an e-mail 

 a shade over a week ago?

 JW: I saw that on the net, 

 yes? During the time that I was in India, Mr Dalmiya came 

 across as a strong ally of Sourav?

 TT: Your thoughts 

 on the first nine months of the Rahul Dravid era?

 JW: Rahuls been doing 

 a very fine job? His batting hasnt suffered and the 

 two innings (81 and 68) he played in the last Test against 

 the West Indies, four weeks ago, were out of this world? 

 One would go miles to watch them. 

 TT: What 

 about your successor, Greg Chappell?

 JW: The team is making 

 progress? If I can add, its in good hands.

 TT: Are you peeved 

 that some still keep suggesting you were soft?

 JW: I wasnt, but 

 you must ask the boys that? Of course, its a fact 

 that I never aired my views in public? The label doesnt 

 worry me, though. 

 TT: The extract 

 contained a reference to the selectors?

 JW: (Interrupting) Theyve 

 got a tough job and it doesnt help that they get voted 

 out during the Boards AGM? The selectors should get 

 appointed on professional terms and their tenure not linked 

 to what happens in the AGM. Last year itself, Id told 

 you that the zonal system must be done away with. 

 TT: Well, 

 the book is out of the way. What now?

 JW: (Laughs again) Im 

 looking for a job and looking for something to keep myself 

 warm! It has been a bitterly cold winter in New Zealand.

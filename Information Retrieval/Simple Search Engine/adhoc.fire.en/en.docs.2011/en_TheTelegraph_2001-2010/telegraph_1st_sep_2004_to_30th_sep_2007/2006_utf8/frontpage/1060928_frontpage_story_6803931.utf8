 Sulfa not to aid army offensive 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Dibrugarh, Sept. 27: As security forces gear up for a heightened offensive against Ulfa, surrendered members of the outfit have voiced their reluctance to aid the army in counter-insurgency operations.

 The Sivasagar district coordination committee of former Ulfa members, in a statement today, urged the government to ensure that they are not forced into participating in operations.The committee threatened to launch an agitation if its members were compelled to accompany the forces during operations.

 Rajkumar Duarah, president of the committee, and general secretary Kailashjit Dutta said many had suffered for co-operating in counter-insurgency operations. 

 Several Sulfa (surrendered Ulfa) members had been killed, many injured and several of us are now under the threat of being eliminated if we go for operations against the Ulfa. 

 The police, however, have denied that they force Sulfa members to accompany them during operations. Suspected Ulfa rebels lobbed a grenade at a camp of the 11 Sikh Light Infantry at Kundil, in Tinsukia district, today. The grenade missed its target and exploded in an open space. Nobody was injured.

 Sourav returns to outstanding team

 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Sourav: In fashion, like Levis?

 Johannesburg, Dec. 17: If we dont win tomorrow, we shouldnt come back to the dressing room is what Sourav Ganguly had to say, rather passionately, at stumps on Day III of the opening Test.

 Finally permitted by the team management to interact with the media (including The Telegraph), the former captain played an innings as memorable as his unbeaten 51 the other day. For the record, requiring 402, the South Africans were gasping at 163 for five. 

 Sourav stayed humble, didnt duck questions, praised successor Rahul Dravid and hoped fans across India would support those who get dropped in the same emotional manner they backed him in the past 10 months.

 The following are excerpts: 

 On his comeback: I havent done anything different. I worked on my fitness and played domestic cricket when I wasnt with the team. Life has come a full circle.

 On teammates: They were outstanding when I was captain, they were outstanding when I wasnt in the team and theyve been outstanding now.

 On the reception from coach Greg Chappell: Everyone has been outstanding.

 On whether the period after the Karachi Test was tough: It wasnt I realised cricket wasnt everything. I played for Bengal and enjoyed being in the dressing room with some very talented players. I didnt know I would be picked, so its not that I was preparing for (conditions in) South Africa.

 On staying mentally tough: After playing for so many years, one has to be tough. 

 On whether this comeback was his biggest challenge: No. The time I was out, my mindset was if it happens, then it happens. Of course, I never stopped believing I was good enough. I believed that instead of thinking about giving it up I still want to play both forms. 

 On his game plan at the Wanderers: My experience helped. This is my fourth trip to South Africa and Ive also been to Australia a few times. Having played earlier, one can visualise grounds... visualise conditions.

 On whether his performance here will facilitate a comeback in the ODIs as well: I know Im good enough. Its (the next set of ODIs) still some way off. Performance counts everywhere.

 Ive batted well. Today, the challenge for me is to be consistent in the next two Tests. Im going to judge myself at the end of the tour.

 On India being in such a strong position: The bowlers have kept a fantastic length and Rahul has set outstanding fields. Im around if advice is needed, but one doesnt have to complicate things. Rahul has his way of thinking. Our performance in Tests overseas has been on the up from 2001 and beating South Africa in South Africa has to be great.

 On his arrival as a Test specialist changing Indias fortunes: (Laughs) Hope it remains that way. People have been making too much of somebody being dropped and too much of somebody being recalled. Emotions dont matter.

 On shouts of Come on Dada at the Wanderers: Has become a fashion, like Levis jeans!

 Finally, his message for fans: Its good to have such support, but I would like them to support everybody. In the past, Rahul has been dropped (from ODIs), Anil Kumble. Sachin (Tendulkar) is the only one who hasnt been dropped. (Adds laughing) But Sachin will never be!

 Mumbai, April 25: Her eldest son is seesawing between life and after. The youngest is facing life behind bars. Yet, Prabhavati Venkatesh Mahajan is a picture of courage, waiting patiently for what destiny has in store.

 Since Saturday, the Mahajan matriarch has been camping, along with the rest of the family, at P.D. Hinduja Hospital where Pramod lies in critical condition after Praveen pumped three bullets into his abdomen.

 For Prabhavatitai, it was a huge shock. But she understands that you have to face what destiny has in store for you, state BJP chief Nitin Gadkari told The Telegraph from the hospital.

 Although she has been through tough times since her husbands death in 1971, the past 72 hours would have been the toughest ever. But as if by habit, Prabhavati has been trying to keep the family together.

 Soon after the shooting on Saturday, she is believed to have called up Praveens wife Sarangi in Thane and tried to calm her down. Neither Sarangi nor her children had any clue that Praveen had more than a morning walk in mind.

 Prabhavati ? she generally stays with Pramod but was not in when the shooting happened ? is also believed to have stopped Sarangi from coming to the hospital till things had quietened down a bit.

 Praveens family has been under immense pressure and has been praying continuously for Pramodjis recovery. Sarangi wanted to go to the hospital but, under the circumstances, she decided to wait and pray, Praveens friend and lawyer Nandkumar Rajurkar said.

 Pramodjis family has been through the worst for the first two days. But since yesterday, there has been a slight improvement in his condition and they have comparatively recovered from the initial shock, Gadkari said.

 According to the medical bulletins issued by the hospital today, the BJP leader continues to be critical. Overnight there has been no improvement, Anupam Verma, director, administration, said.

 He continues to be maintained on high levels of ventilatory and ionotropic support. He continues to undergo continuous renal replacement therapy for poor kidney function.

 As doctors continued their fight, Pramods family and well-wishers held prayers and performed pujas. At the BJP headquarters in Delhi, over 300 maulanas gathered to read all 30 chapters of the Quran.

 Yesterday, Gadkari and Shiv Sena leader Manohar Joshi had performed a puja at Siddhivinayak Temple. Today, Pramods children Rahul and Poonam offered prayers there.

 TV serial

 New Delhi, March 10: Anjali Gupta, the first woman from the armed forces to be court martialled, is negotiating with television producers to serialise her story. 

 Flying Officer Anjali Gupta was given marching orders from the Indian Air Force in February.

 Anjali had alleged that she was victimised because she was a whistleblower on corrupt deals and that she was harassed by three superiors.

 I am preparing to file a petition to the Government of India through the ministry of defence. Depending on how the response to that petition is, I will go to court (against the order). 

 I am also talking to some producers who have offered to serialise on television my story or adapt it to film. I have put off taking up a job in the private sector till April, Anjali said.

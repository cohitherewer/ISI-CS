 Dravid out, VVS in

 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Laxman, Ganguly

Nov. 27: Wasim Jaffers selection in the ODI squad last month suggested that Dilip Vengsarkar would call the shots as chairman of the senior selection committee.

 That got reinforced this evening when he took the initiative to send V.V.S. Laxman to South Africa as a reinforcement once it was confirmed captain Rahul Dravid would miss the last two ODIs and Team Indias first Twenty20 International.

 No request came from the team management The selectors, however, felt a specialist batsman needed to go, explained Board of Control for Cricket in India secretary Niranjan Shah, an hour after announcing there would be no addition. 

 Contacted by The Telegraph, Vengsarkar said: I had a discussion with my colleagues Laxman, in any case, was a certainty for the Test series By going early, he will get time to acclimatise, too.

 Four weeks ago, though, hed maintained the Hyderabad stalwarts fitness wasnt up to ODI standards. But then, much has happened since.

 Were trailing 0-2, the batsmen have floundered and, yesterday, No. 2 wicketkeeper Dinesh Karthik played as a specialist batsman!

 Laxman, who wont reach in time for the next match (on Wednesday), has been off ODIs for 15 months. 

 Its intriguing why the team management didnt ask for somebody. The Greg Chappells, clearly, shouldve been most concerned. 

 Injured attempting a catch at Newlands, Dravid (who batted with pain-killers) has been diagnosed with an avulsion fracture on the right middle finger.

 The official statement, courtesy media manager Rajan Nair, reads: Rahul Dravid injured the middle finger of his right hand while attempting a catch. X-rays and consultations with a hand specialist this morning have confirmed an avulsion fracture. The injury does not require surgery and will be treated conservatively and monitored constantly.

 At this stage, hes going to miss the remaining ODIs. It is anticipated that he will be fit for the first Test (from December 15).

 As the medical facilities in Cape Town are excellent, Dravid and physio John Gloster didnt leave for Port Elizabeth with the rest this morning.

 They were expected there later in the day.

 Dravids injury means that the out-of-form and under-pressure Virender Sehwag is going to be stand-in captain. Its unclear who will be his deputy. 

 With Laxman getting a call-up, Sourav Gangulys fingers are going to be kept crossed. He has been out for nine months, but hasnt given up hope.

 Indications are that Sourav actually has a 50-50 chance for the Test squad, to be chosen on Thursday.

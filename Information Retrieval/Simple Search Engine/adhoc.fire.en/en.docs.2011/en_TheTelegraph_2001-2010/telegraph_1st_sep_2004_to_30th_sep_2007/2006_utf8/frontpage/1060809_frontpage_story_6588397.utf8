 Molest charge in private hospital

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Aug. 8: A schoolgirl was allegedly molested last evening as she was being wheeled to her cabin after ankle surgery by a male attendant who thought she was still unconscious from general anaesthesia.

 Munna Guchhait was carting the 15-year-old student of a city school to her sixth-floor room in Belle Vue Clinic around 7.30 pm when he decided to have a go at her. The girl, just out of the OT, was too dazed to protest.

 But she broke into tears the minute her parents walked into her room a while later. She said the attendant had been under the impression that she was unconscious and had molested her while she lay on the gurney.

 Munna was arrested on a complaint filed by the girls father at Shakespeare Sarani police station. The nursing home authorities called the cops after he intimated them.

 On the basis of a complaint lodged by the girls father, we have initiated a case of molestation against the youth. It appears the accused felt the patient was still under the effect of anaesthesia and tried to cash in on her unconscious state, Ajoy Kumar, deputy commissioner of police (south), said.

 The 23-year-old attendant, a resident of Tiljala on the eastern fringes of the city, had started work at the nursing home only two and a half months ago. His father, too, used to work there.

 Munna, who had tried to flee after being caught out, was produced in a city court today. Later, he was released on bail.

 Belle Vue authorities have expressed regret over the incident. They said they had sacked Munna with immediate effect.

 It is an extremely unfortunate incident and we have removed him with immediate effect. We dont tolerate anything that will tarnish the reputation of our institution, Pradip Tandon, spokesman of the clinic, said.

 We wanted to be very firm while coming clean on this incident and so informed the police. 

 The Class VIII students travails began on July 25 when she fell off a tram in Park Street, somewhere in the Beniapukur police station area, and hurt her ankle.

 She was first taken to Calcutta 

 National Medical College, from where she was shifted to 

 a nursing home in Alipore. On July 28, she was shifted to 

 Belle Vue and advised to undergo ankle surgery.

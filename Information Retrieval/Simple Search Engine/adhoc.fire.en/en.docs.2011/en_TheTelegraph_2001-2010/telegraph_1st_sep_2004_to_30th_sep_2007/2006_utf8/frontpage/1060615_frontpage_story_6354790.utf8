 India fields Tharoor for UN top job

 K.P. NAYAR

 Tharoor: Creating history?

New York, June 14: India is to field its candidate 

for the job of secretary-general of the UN. The choice has fallen on Shashi Tharoor, 

an alumnus of Calcuttas St. Xaviers School. 

 A UN civil servant for 28 years, Tharoor is currently under-secretary-general for communications and public information at the world bodys headquarters here. 

 Barring any last-minute hitch, a formal announcement will be made in New Delhi in a few days. 

 If the Indian campaign on behalf of Tharoor is successful, it will be the first time in the 61-year history of the UN that the worlds most high-profile job has gone to an Indian. Tharoors candidature has been on the cards since last November.

 But it gathered momentum in New Delhi after the UN Security Council decided a fortnight ago to bring out its first list of candidates to succeed Kofi Annan by July 15.

 The council also decided that only candidates officially nominated by member governments would figure on the list.

 Previously, anyone could nominate a candidate.

 The sudden change forced India to take a quick decision. It was feared in New Delhi that unless an Indian nominee was on the first list, any international campaign for winning the job would lose momentum.

 Annans second five-year term in office ends on December 31. His successor, who will be picked by the council around October, will take office on January 1, 2007.

 The choice of a successor will have to be acceptable to all the five permanent members of the council.

 By convention, this is Asias turn to have a secretary-general. The last Asian to hold the job was Myanmars U. Thant who had two five-year terms from 1961. But there is no agreement within Asia on a common candidate.

 The Asian frontrunner so far has been Sri Lankan diplomat Jayantha Dhanapala, a former UN under-secretary-general for disarmament. India strongly opposes his candidature because he was instrumental in the 1990s in securing an extension of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) in perpetuity. India has repeatedly spurned the treaty.

 At last years South Asian summit in Dhaka, India blocked Saarc from endorsing Dhanapala as a joint candidate. Thailands deputy Prime Minister, Surakiart Sathirathai, and South Koreas foreign minister, Ban Ki Moon, are the other Asian candidates for now.

 Indias decision to nominate Tharoor has been prompted partly by the realisation that their campaigns have failed to take off.

 Exploiting the lack of unanimity in Asia, several East European leaders have put forward their names. But Russia and China have threatened to veto any East European candidate.

 Tharoors campaign is expected to be built around his oft-quoted statement that the UN needs reform not because it has failed, but because it has accomplished enough over the years to be worth investing in.

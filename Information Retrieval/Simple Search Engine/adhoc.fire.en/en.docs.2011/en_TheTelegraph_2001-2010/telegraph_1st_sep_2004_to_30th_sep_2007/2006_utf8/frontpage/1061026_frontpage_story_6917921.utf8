 - Asam Sahitya Sabha suspends top official for graft 

 Jorhat, 

 Oct. 25: Loath to endanger a reputation built over 

 89 years, Assams apex literary organisation today 

 took the unprecedented decision of suspending its general 

 secretary Jagadish Patgiri after detecting some irregularities 

 in financial transactions. 

 Pratap Chandra Baruah, assistant 

 general secretary of the Jorhat unit of the Asam Sahitya 

 Sabha, was appointed as the acting general secretary of 

 the central committee.

 Patgiri is the first senior office-bearer 

 of the sabha to be sidelined for financial irregularities 

 and indiscipline. The organisation was formed in Sivasagar 

 in 1917 with the aim of enriching the Assamese literature 

 and culture.

 The decision to suspend Patgiri 

 was taken during an executive committee meeting at the headquarters 

 of the organisation.

 Sabha president Kanaksen Deka 

 told the media later that irregularities had been detected 

 in the financial trust that was formed at the Diphu session 

 of the literary organisation. The trust was supposed to 

 accumulate a Rs 1-crore corpus to strengthen the organisation.

 Patgiri allegedly announced that 

 the trust had achieved its target before Rs 1 crore could 

 be collected. He also stands accused of withdrawing money 

 from the trust without the executive committees permission. 

 Deka said a two-member inquiry committee, headed by vice-president 

 Pachugopal Chakraborty, would probe the irregularities. 

 The committee will submit its report within two months.

 Apart from suspending Patgiri, 

 the sabha issued a showcause notice to chief accountant 

 Sarbananda Talukdar. 

 Another senior office-bearer, 

 trust convenor Jayanta Baruah, offered to resign on moral 

 grounds but it was not accepted.

 On the allegations of indiscipline 

 against Patgiri, the sabha president said the former general 

 secretary superseded him and the executive committee in 

 issuing lifetime membership certificates to certain people. 

 Another allegation against Patgiri 

 is that he sold copies of seven books published by the sabha 

 to the state government without the executive committees 

 sanction. The government purchased the books for distribution 

 among libraries across the state. One of the books is Patgiris 

 autobiography.

 Insiders said Patgiri also had 

 had a misunderstanding with other executive committee members 

 over the selection of the next president of the literary 

 organisation.

 Not invited to todays meeting, 

 Patgiri reached the venue, Chandra Kanta Bhawan, before 

 the discussion began but was requested to exit the conference 

 hall.

 Pushkar tourist cries rape

 OUR BUREAU AND AGENCIES

 April 19: A Japanese tourist has accused a Pushkar hotel owners son of raping and then robbing her after making her unconscious with lassi laced with bhang.

 Police in the Rajasthan pilgrim town said the woman faxed her complaint to special superintendent Ganga Srinivas Rao yesterday from an Agra public call booth, saying 22-year-old Babloo raped her on April 2. 

 The hotel has been identified as Hotel Quiet Palace.

 The alleged violation comes less than a month after a top Orissa police officers son raped a German tourist in Alwar, also in Rajasthan. 

 However, justice came fast as a court last week sentenced B.H. Mohanti, an MBA student, to seven years in prison for the assault.

S.S. Rathore, the station house officer in Pushkar 

who is probing the Japanese tourists allegation, said the woman also alleged 

in her fax that the accused robbed her of Rs 54,000.

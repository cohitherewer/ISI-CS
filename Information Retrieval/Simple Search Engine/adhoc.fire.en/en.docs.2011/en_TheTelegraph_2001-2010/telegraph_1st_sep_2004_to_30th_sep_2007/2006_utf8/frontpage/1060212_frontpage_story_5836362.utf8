 In the forbidden zone, face to face 

 with an almost-forgotten goddess 

 DATELINE HINGLAJ

 Despatch from one of the most inaccessible pilgrimage points

 AVEEK SARKAR

 The entrance to 

 the Hinglaj cave where the goddess resides: There is 

 no imposing architecture or riveting sculpture... but 

 there is great theatre 

 Hinglaj (Baluchistan): Her 

 face may not have launched a thousand ships but it nearly 

 ended Creation. The beauty may have been compelling but 

 it did not lead to any seizure of the realm.

 Yet for over a thousand years, 

 the legend of Sati has held sway. 

 It still does. Even in Talibanised 

 Pakistan. I accompanied the 86 pilgrims and BJP leader Jaswant 

 Singh to find out what it means to be an almost-forgotten 

 Hindu god in a forgotten part of the world.

 This is how it all began. Sati, 

 Shivas consort, ended her life by jumping into a pool 

 of fire to protest against the humiliation of her husband 

 by her own father.

 Heaven hath no fury like a god 

 bereaved. So Shiva responded by going into the dance of 

 destruction. But the guiles of Vishnu saved the day. The 

 remains of Sati were cut in 51 pieces and scattered across 

 India. The 51 places where the remains fell are known as 

 pitha and constitute the Grand Slam of Indian pilgrimage.

 As many as 49 of the 51 pithas 

 are within India. A few lie outside its current geographical 

 boundary. One of them, Hinglaj, is in Baluchistan. 

 The scalp of Sati, replete with 

 vermilion, the mark of the married woman, fell in Hinglaj.

 On this corporeal relic grew a 

 place of worship ?somewhat in the fashion of Buddhist stupas. 

 Thus bloomed the Hindu flower in the barren wilderness of 

 Baluchistan.

 In truth, the goddess at Hinglaj 

 began her reign much earlier but as an unknown regional 

 satrap. Once assumed in the 51-strong National Democratic 

 Alliance of Sati, her munificence stood vastly enlarged. 

 Hinglaj, born non-Aryan, became part of the Shakti diaspora. 

 Her humble origins were soon forgotten.

 Despite the lineage, Hinglaj never 

 quite received the attention it deserved.

 The journey was arduous and long. 

 The 250-km trudge across an unfriendly desert was an ultimate 

 test of faith. (Every pilgrim, says Jaswant, deserved a 

 Victoria Cross). The entire route was and remains infested 

 with dacoits. The visitors, mainly local Hindus from Sindh, 

 were routinely robbed.

 The only other pilgrims the goddess 

 attracted were the steady trickle of Rajputs ? kings and 

 kin ? from Rajasthan and neighbouring Gujarat. Even that 

 ebbed with Partition. Outside of Rajasthan, only Bengal 

 had a certain familiarity with Hinglaj. This was due to 

 a Bengali tantrik who visited the shrine before Partition 

 and wrote a harrowing account.

 His best-selling journal is the 

 only modern chronicle of the pilgrimage. It later spawned 

 a hugely successful Bengali film with Uttam Kumar as the 

 pilgrim. Despite a fascination for Aryanised native gods, 

 few Bengalis were willing to hazard a perilous journey.

 Hinglaj for them was a romantic 

 interlude. But as a token Bengali among the yatris, I was 

 recognised as the representative of the states undying 

 Shakti cult.

 It would be quite wrong to blame 

 the declining interest only on bigotry. The fact is, getting 

 into Pakistan is complicated enough unless one is a cricketer. 

 Even for those granted a visa, 

 Baluchistan falls in the forbidden zone.

 In the best of times, Baluchistan 

 is an Allah-forsaken country. With 43 per cent of Pakistans 

 land and only 5 per cent of its population, it defines nowhereness. 

 Hinglaj, where the goddess resides, is 110 km from the nearest 

 police station. The village panchayat in Hinglaj rules over 

 an area that is 160 km in length.

 There is no electricity or telephone 

 or post office. Not even a chai shop. The only local 

 population appears to be Russell vipers and Ibex goats.

 And it is hardly the best of times. 

 Baluchistan is divided into tribes. Their current preoccupation 

 is fighting among themselves, which, to be fair, is what 

 they have always done. They are also fighting with Islamabad 

 which appears to be a contemporary undertaking.

 Pakistan is convinced that India 

 is behind these troubles, as much as India believes Pakistan 

 is behind every act of arson on its soil. Baluchistan houses 

 the countrys missile-testing zone, making the region 

 security-sensitive. The long and largely unguarded coastline 

 is a standing temptation for the drug traffic. The trades 

 current capo, Pappu Arshad, runs his fief from the region 

 with, it is said, the administration turning a blind eye.

 Enter Jaswant Singh. The man from 

 Jaisalmer pestered the Pakistan government into allowing 

 him to lead a group of Indian pilgrims by road from India 

 to Baluchistan. Even for Singh, whose persuasive skills 

 have put him in the race for the UN secretary generalship, 

 it was not easy. But Singh was not one to give up easily. 

 He met the Indian Prime Minister who agreed to speak to 

 Pervez Musharraf and only then did Islamabad relent.

 Singhs trip marked the informal 

 opening of the Rajasthan gateway to Pakistan. And Singh 

 did it with great style. Some 86 pilgrims, mostly Marwari 

 Rajputs from the Jaisalmer region, crossed the Munaba 

 border on foot and then boarded four-wheelers to cross 

 the Thar on an ancient pilgrim track in disuse for years. 

 Two of them were Rajasthan-registered vehicles fitted for 

 the occasion with special sand tyres. 

 Once in a while even a pilgrim 

 needs to make his point.

 Opinion remains divided as to 

 why Singh undertook this trip. Pakistan believes that for 

 the BJP leader, it is a positioning game. The parivar factotums 

 in the Hinglaj entourage saw no reason why opening up a 

 Rajasthan corridor to Pakistan will impact national politics.

 But they readily concede that 

 Singh will be seen as being occupied with larger issues 

 at a time when the next generation in the party are busy 

 sniping at each other. Singhs detractors in the party 

 point to the fact that the gateway to Pakistan falls conveniently 

 in his son Manavendras Lok Sabha constituency. 

 While the younger Singh has done 

 well by his electorate, the significant Muslim population 

 could become hazardous to his political health. The opening 

 of the borders ? the railways will begin their service later 

 this month ? will prove a boon to the many Muslim (and some 

 Hindu) families divided by Partition, thereby earning the 

 Singh khandaan political brownie points.

 Judging by the initial reaction, 

 Singh may be heading for a home run. All across the route, 

 Pakistanis lined up to welcome the Indian guests. In Umraokot, 

 where Emperor Akbar was born, flower petals were thrown 

 on the Indian cars. This was a spontaneous act of goodwill, 

 given the fact that the parivar is unlikely to have engineered 

 support in Pakistan and the ISI would hardly be that ingenious.

 If politics is what brought Singh 

 to Hinglaj, it was politics that gave Hinglaj its eminence.

 Hinglaj was one of the many small-time 

 local gods that existed all over India. They were pre-Aryan 

 and had little or nothing to do with Hinduism as we know 

 and practise it. Very cleverly, the early Aryans imbibed 

 them in their midst, thus giving birth to the politics of 

 coalition.

 In contrast, the latter invaders 

 ? Islam and Christianity ? sought to expand through conversion. 

 Hostile takeovers, as L.N. Mittal is learning to his chagrin, 

 leave residual bitterness. Babri being just one consequence.

 The first versions of Satis 

 tale were far less dramatic. The Mahabharata and the philosophical 

 canons known collectively as The Brahmanas recount 

 Satis discomfiture and eventual suicide but make no 

 mention of Shivas anger. Vishnus delightful 

 antic, almost Bollywood in character, of slicing the body 

 in many pieces was introduced many centuries later.

 But this simple extension, innocuous 

 on the surface, had much larger implications. It provided 

 the intellectual argument and a simple but clever way for 

 the Aryans to reach out and absorb gods and ideas native 

 to India. Existing places of worship were identified and 

 declared Hindu pithas. Native gods were not left 

 in the lurch but admitted to the pantheon.

 In the spirit of a common minimum 

 programme, the idols or the objects of worship were left 

 untouched while non-Aryan rituals, such as tantra, 

 were allowed into the fold. Even the idea of corporeal relic, 

 the leading Indian scholar on the subject, D.C. Sarkar, 

 has argued, was merely an early attempt to regain lost territory 

 from the Buddhists. Subsequently, Buddha was declared a 

 full avatar of Vishnu.

 The adaptation of Hinglaj in the 

 Hindu family was thus good politics. In the absence of local 

 history, it is difficult to say when all this happened. 

 But a distinguished scholar, David Gordon White, professor 

 at the University of California, Santa Barbara, in his book 

 on Siddha tradition claims that a fourth century Greek geographer, 

 called Ctesias, has referred to Hinglaj in his work. 

 Little has changed in the intervening 

 years. The early travellers used camels as means of travel. 

 Today they use four-wheelers. But the Baluchi desert remains 

 as ever, mildly vegetated and as uninviting. Just like Rajasthan, 

 said Hukum Singh, the Jaswant family driver, who steered 

 the Mahindra Scorpio all the way from Jaisalmer.

 And just like Baluchistan, deserts 

 in Rajasthan can sometimes be unfriendly. Either side of 

 the fence, the camel drivers can be enterprising: visitors 

 to the Jaisalmer dunes, for example, often find their burden 

 lightened if they are not too careful.

 The great desert bonhomie is, 

 thus, one of lifes enduring fictions. Those who live 

 with natures hostility learn how to avail of lifes 

 opportunity. No one would know this better than the chief 

 minister of the state, Mohammad Yousaf Aliani.

 In yesteryears, he was the Jam, 

 i.e. nawab, of the region. Today he is the elected 

 chief minister. While his son, a Pramod Mahajan-like figure 

 who sports a rather visible Giorgio Armani shirt under the 

 Baluch tunic, is the district Nazim or head of the zilla 

 parishad. Hinglaj is part of his charge.

 The father-and-son team rule Quetta 

 with an iron hand. Together with the federal government 

 in Islamabad, they have assembled a 40-strong convoy to 

 take the yatris to the shrine. The convoy included federal 

 troops, provincial police and elite anti-terrorist commandos 

 equipped to the teeth with German machine guns and American 

 rocket-launchers.

 The surrounding hills were sanitised 

 with soldiers taking charge. The entire 250-km route from 

 Karachi was manned by the men in black.

 Even the Indian high commission 

 was impressed. They are not leaving things to chance, said 

 an accompanying member of the Indian mission. 

 Why? I asked.

 They do not wish any untoward 

 event to take place.

 A signboard points 

 to Nani Mandar, as the shrine is known in Pakistan

 It was not only the show of strength 

 which impressed the Indians. The Baluchistan government 

 sent its ministers along with a Lexus 4x4 sports utility 

 vehicle ? the sort Amar Singh uses ? at the Sindh-Baluchistan 

 border to receive the Indians. The chief minister himself 

 drove a few hundred kilometres from his capital just to 

 host a lunch at Hinglaj and even left his son, the Nazim, 

 to spend the night with the yatris. They have spent 

 crores, said a member of the Indian mission, to 

 make you feel at home. The unused bottles of the branded 

 water are enough to fill a swimming pool. 

 Such expression of goodwill did 

 not hinder the little one-day internationals the two foreign 

 ministries play. Indian diplomats are rarely allowed a peep 

 into this side of the world. The Jaswant Singh trip was, 

 in a sense, a godsend.

 There was no harm in pushing our 

 luck, reasoned the Indians and requested a recce 

 trip. No deal, said Islamabad. Can we at least send an officer 

 a day in advance to Hinglaj so that he can go through the 

 arrangement and is in situ to welcome the Indian leader 

 of the Opposition? the official tried again. 

 Shoaib Akhtar did not blink.

 There is more than one reason 

 why Pakistan is reticent about allowing Indians in Baluchistan 

 and one good reason why it is being plain silly. There is 

 strife and allegations of an Indian involvement and there 

 is the missile-testing zone. But the Chinese have built 

 them a spanking new port on the Arabian Sea with, it is 

 said, tacit approval from the Americans. The Persian Gulf 

 is a potential tinder-box and should the occasion demand 

 it, Washington would have one more springboard for an operation. 

 But such arguments are silly because 

 satellites have made nonsense of yesterdays idea of 

 security. 

 What is food for the mullah, though, 

 is food for the kafir. A spanking new port requires a spanking 

 new road. So the Chinese have built one to facilitate traffic 

 between Karachi and the new port at Gwadar.

 The road cutting through the spectacular 

 Makran Coast Range passes through a village called Aghore 

 which is merely 20-odd km from the shrine. (Aghore is the 

 place through which Alexanders army returned after 

 the battle with Porus). The once inaccessible goddess has 

 thus been brought to the doorsteps, ending over 1,500 years 

 of travellers nightmare. So the pilgrim progresses. 

 But the goddess? 

 At first sight, the She could 

 disappoint. There is no imposing architecture or riveting 

 sculpture. Hinglaj is not 10 Janpath but a minor coalition 

 partner. It is tribal paganism Aryanised only at the fringe. 

 But there is great theatre. The goddess resides in a cave 

 sculpted by nature with wind and water in a narrow canyon.

 The opening of the cave would 

 be about 30 feet in height and around 60 to 70 feet in breadth. 

 A river ambles its way in the bottom of the gorge. Its placid 

 existence ? and in patches non-existence ? is misleading. 

 With the right rain, its passion could be aroused and then 

 it cuts completely the access to the goddess. 

 Inside the cave, there is no idol 

 to speak of, though there is an object of worship. Part 

 of the rock is dressed in a sari and painted with vermilion, 

 invoking awe and creating an atmosphere of reverence. Here 

 the offerings are made. There is a U-shaped tunnel just 

 underneath the deity.

 The ritual act of pradakhsheen 

 (going round a place of worship) is done crawling in the 

 labyrinth. The majesty of Hinglaj lies not in its details. 

 One looks not at the snapshot of a planet but at the portrait 

 of the Milky Way itself.

 The 20-km ride from the highway 

 prepares one for the spectacle. A lazy dirt track moving 

 in and out of the embrace of the mountain, crawling across 

 the river bed? the side of the mountains almost sculpted 

 by wind from the sea? this is nature unspoilt to perfection.

 Civilisation has spared Hinglaj. 

 Barely 20,000 visit the shrine in a year and that too in 

 the few comfortable months of the year. Then nature takes 

 over. The angry sun of the desert and the sudden flashes 

 of flood in the rain ensure the deity her seclusion.

 All that may change with progress. 

 The new coastal highway cutting down travelling time to 

 a mere three hours and an improved India-Pakistan relationship 

 could cost even the Mother of the Universe her privacy. 

 The gods, like men, can survive 

 apathy. Can they, unlike men, survive the adulation?

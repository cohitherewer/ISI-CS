 College poll reform

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 10: The J.M. Lyngdoh committee, set up to reform students union elections, has ruled out barring political parties from taking part in campus elections. 

 But the panel has called for a freeze campaign period during which outsiders would not be allowed to enter a college campus to catch votes for their parties.

 It also says there can be no uniform or model method of conducting elections and systems have to be tailored to the demands of specific universities.

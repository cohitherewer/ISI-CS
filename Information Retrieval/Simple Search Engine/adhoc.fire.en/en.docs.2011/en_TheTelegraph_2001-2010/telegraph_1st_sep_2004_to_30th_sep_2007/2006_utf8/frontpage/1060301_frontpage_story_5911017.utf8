 Maoists kill 28

 Raipur, Feb. 28: Maoists killed at least 28 villagers and abducted about 120 in Chhattisgarh this morning, reports our correspondent.

 Unofficial reports said over 50 people were killed. 

 Over 200 villagers were returning from a meeting against Maoists in two trucks and a bus when the rebels detonated a landmine, blowing up one of the vehicles near Konta, around 500 km south of Raipur. They took control of the other two vehicles.

 Police said the victims were mostly tribals belonging to a government-backed anti-Maoist group.

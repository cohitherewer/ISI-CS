 Court raps Dispur on jobs, again

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Guwahati, Nov. 24: The Gauhati High Court today struck down appointments in the Assam co-operation department, terming them illegal, embarrassing the Tarun Gogoi government no end for the second time in recent months. 

 The court had earlier terminated the appointments of police constables after finding procedural anomalies. 

 The court of Justice B.K. Sharma, in its ruling, today termed the appointments of 74 junior inspectors and auditors of co-operative societies as illegal. 

 It pointed out that all norms, including those related to reservations, were flouted in the recruitment process and the appointing authorities even bypassed court orders and violated Dispurs cabinet decisions. 

 The court sought an investigation by an independent agency and departmental proceedings against the errant officials.

 Howard hug

 Canberra, July 28 (AP): 

 Australian Prime Minister John Howard said today that people 

 are welcome to hug him and dismissed reports that there 

 was a breach of security when a teen clutching a screwdriver 

 embraced him. 

 In TV images picked up by newspapers today, 16-year-old student Steve Battaglia was shown giving Howard a hug on his 67th birthday on Wednesday. Howard was taking his daily morning walk along a river in Melbourne. 

 Battaglia later said he had been adjusting his rowboat rudder and forgot to drop the screwdriver.

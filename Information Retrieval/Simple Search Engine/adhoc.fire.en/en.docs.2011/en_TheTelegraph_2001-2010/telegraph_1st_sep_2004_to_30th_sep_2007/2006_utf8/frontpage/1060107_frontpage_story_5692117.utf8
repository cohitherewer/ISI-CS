 Chappell bats out Ganguly googlies

 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Lahore, Jan. 6: Sourav Ganguly was hundreds of miles away when Team India captain Rahul Dravid and coach Greg Chappell had their first media conference in Pakistan, this morning, but his shadow formed the backdrop at the Pearl Continentals opulent Crystal Hall.

 Pakistani journalists lobbed a series of Sourav-specific questions and one even pointedly asked Chappell whether he had a problem with the former captain.

 I dont have differences with Sourav. He knows whats expected of him and my own commitment to excellence remains, Chappell replied.

 Dravid said: Sourav has played a lot of cricket. Over 15 years of first-class and all players have ups and downs. At times, you get dropped when you dont perform and get recalled when you do.

 Asked whether Souravs presence would affect the dressing room, Dravid first took a dig at the media, saying at times, everything thats written isnt the true picture.

 He added: I dont expect the selection (of the XI) to be an issue. Ive been very happy with the spirit in the dressing room over the past couple of months and I expect it to remain that way.

 Neither indicated whether Sourav would be out at the Gaddafi in exactly a week, when the three-Test series gets under way.

 The best XI will play, declared the captain, while the coach didnt go beyond: He (Sourav) is part of the squad. Only time is to tell whether (hes going to be in the XI). I want to get the most efficient performance out of the group.

 Sourav arrives tomorrow with fifties in each innings of the Ranji match against Tamil Nadu. 

 Besides Sourav, the questions mostly revolved around the frequency of Indo-Pak engagements, home team captain Inzamam-ul Haqs labelling of India as favourites and whether the Indians were preparing to exclusively neutralise Shoaib Akhtar.

 Dravid rightly felt the boards needed to work out an Ashes-like arrangement whereby the face-offs werent annual. 

 The buzz of the 2003-04 tour is absent, but Dravid made the point that the players perspective hadnt changed and external issues dont really come into the picture. The process of winning hearts, though, is to continue.

 Acknowledging Dravids role, Chappell highlighted he continues to learn very quickly and his USP as captain is that he hasnt tried to be anything more than being himself. 

 Perhaps, nothing is more important than respect in the dressing room. Dravid doesnt have to worry.

 Younis refuses to be dummy

 - Yousuf to lead Pakistan after Inzy replacement walks out

 Oct. 5: Darrell Hair must be having a quiet chuckle. The ball-tampering allegation against Inzamam-ul Haq didnt stick, but set in motion events leading to the biggest controversy within Pakistan cricket since the match-fixing scandal claimed the Salim Maliks.

 Whats surprising, of course, is that the otherwise thanda Pathan, Younis Khan, has triggered the latest two days before the Pakistan squads arrival in India for the Champions Trophy. He refused to lead in the tournament, saying he didnt want to be a dummy captain.

 According to agency reports, the 28-year-old Younis stunned the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) by walking out of a media conference in Lahore, announcing: I dont want to be a dummy captain... I will explain the reasons for my decision later.

 Among those left bewildered was coach Bob Woolmer, who was actually by his side.

 Younis, who has been the No. 2 from February 2005, was named stand-in captain for the Champions Trophy following the four-match ban on Inzamam, a punishment for forfeiting The Oval Test in August. The PCB brass tried to reason with Younis, but he didnt relent.

 Mohammed Yousuf (formerly Yousuf Youhana), the man Younis replaced as vice-captain 20 months ago, is now going to lead in the tournament which is second only to the World Cup in star-billing. Its to be seen whether the PCB disciplines Younis, who has consistently been backed by the talismanic Imran Khan.

 Late in the evening, the PCB issued a statement claiming Younis had expressed regrets for his behaviour in a one-on-one with chairman Shaharyar Khan. It added that while the breach of discipline would be dealt with in accordance with the rules and regulations, Younis wouldnt be dropped.

 President Pervez Musharraf, incidentally, is the PCBs chief patron and is unlikely to be amused by the developments in the nerve-centre of Pakistans cricket. 

 Well-placed sources of The Telegraph have listed three reasons for the stand-in captains unusual behaviour. 

 First, Youniss unhappiness at the prospect of Inzamam joining the squad during the later stages of the Champions Trophy. This possibility was made public by manager-designate Talat Ali. Younis, its learnt, felt he wouldnt be able to lead his way if Inzamam was there albeit, in an unofficial capacity.

 Second, dismay over the selectors decision to replace Inzamam with Javed Miandads nephew, Faisal Iqbal, without seeking his opinion. Iqbal is seen as more of a Test player. In any case, Younis believes a captain should have a say in the composition of the squad. An Imran trait that. 

 Third, the PCBs reluctance to question Inzamam over the whimsical manner in which he keeps changing the batting order in ODIs. Younis has suffered the most and those close to him have, for many months, been insisting that Inzamam has developed a complex.

 Apparently, in recent times, Younis has been getting isolated in the Pakistan dressing room for distancing himself from maulvis. Be it Inzamam or Shahid Afridi or even Yousuf (who converted last year), all have come to be greatly influenced by preachers... Often, they themselves preach... Younis is different and, it seems, thats one reason why hes seen by some as the odd man out, is how a source put it.

 Younis and (fellow-Pathan) Afridi, it may be recalled, had a much-publicised scrap in the West Indies last year. Speaking about that incident, some months later, Younis had said: Every player must be a team man and egos have no place in the dressing room. The country and team are bigger than individuals.

 Somehow, Younis one of the tallest batsmen of his era forgot that today.

 Fresh shot at Siachen agreement

 SUJAN DUTTA

 New Delhi, Oct. 8: India is considering making a fresh offer to Pakistan and will push for a disengagement of the armies at Siachen.

 This offer could be made as early as this week even as the Prime Minister visits London and Helsinki.

 The offer will go beyond the conventional stalemate on the authentication of troop positions on the Saltoro Heights but will necessitate that also, a highly-placed source said.

 The contours of the offer will be evident by the time the foreign secretaries of the two countries revive talks.

 The ceasefire between the Indian and Pakistan armies in Siachen (and also along the Line of Control) has held for nearly three years now.

 The Siachen issue is the most solvable (of all outstanding issues with Pakistan), the source said. We are looking at it seriously. But, of course, there has to be an ack- nowledgement of troop positions.

 In Indias view, the authentication specifically, the marking on a map of where the armies are currently positioned is a beginning and not an end.

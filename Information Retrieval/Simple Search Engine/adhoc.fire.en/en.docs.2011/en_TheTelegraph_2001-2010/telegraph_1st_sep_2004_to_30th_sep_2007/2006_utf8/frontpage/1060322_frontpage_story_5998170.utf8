 Rape slur on MBA student 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, March 21: A cross-continent SMS has led police to a rape case in which a German tourist has accused a top police officers son, who is also an MBA student, of assaulting her in Rajasthan.

 The 26-year-old German woman was brought to Alwar in eastern Rajasthan from Delhi last night by B.H. Mohanti, the son of Orissas additional director-general of police B.B. Mohanti, officials said.

 The 22-year-old Mohanti, a final year student of the Indian Institute of Labour Management in Delhi, had befriended the woman during a visit to the German embassy. The woman is a research scholar.

 Alwar additional superintendent of police Ramdeo Singh said Mohanti and the tourist had checked into a hotel yesterday. Mohanti has been accused of raping the woman after they had dinner.

 The woman then SMSed her friend in Berlin. She in turn reported the matter to the German embassy in Delhi, Singh told The Telegraph over phone. The embassy informed Alwar police.

 The police intercepted a New Delhi-bound train from Jaipur at Khairtal station and arrested Mohanti, an engineering graduate, while he was returning with the victim this morning, Singh said.

 The subsequent medical test confirmed sexual assault, the police said. Mohanti has been remanded in judicial custody for 15 days.

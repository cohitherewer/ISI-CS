 Care for fair, 

 not library

 - Great culture in Maidan show as rich repository 

 crumbles 

 RESHMI SENGUPTA 

 BOOKS UNFAIR

 Calcutta, Nov. 

 9: The book fair is a great cultural event 

 according to the chief minister that must be held on 

 the Maidan, come hell or high court. But one of Bengals 

 great libraries doesnt qualify for such special care.

 Rare books with broken spines, 

 crumbling reprints of 19th century periodicals cobwebbed, 

 coated in dust and scattered carelessly in the labyrinth 

 of racks at Bangiya Sahitya Parishad. Thats the ground-floor 

 library.

 The second-floor museum boasts 

 statues dumped in a corner, Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyays 

 quaint wooden chair in the company of two red plastic chairs 

 meant for daily use, Iswar Chandra Vidyasagars huge 

 oval-shaped dining table leaning against the wall amidst 

 a pile of clutter. 

 One dare not probe further.

 Armed with a paltry annual grant 

 from the government, the 112-year-old state-aided library 

 is struggling to preserve its staggering collection of 3.5 

 lakh books and journals, 3,000-plus manuscripts, paintings, 

 coins and sculptures. A bulk of the journals, periodicals 

 and books are rare, dating back to the first publications.

 The state pays the salaries of 

 five Parishad employees and provides an annual grant. Last 

 year, the amount was Rs 10 lakh, up from Rs 9 lakh the year 

 before, officials said.

 The funds crunch is hitting 

 us hard. A large share of the government money is spent 

 on paying the remaining 16 employees... We dont have 

 the kind of money that is needed for preservation of the 

 rare collection. This requires not a single paisa less than 

 Rs 25 lakh a year, says Parishad assistant secretary 

 Aloke Das.

 Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee could 

 ask the organisers of the book fair a commercial venture 

 to help meet some of the gap by simply paying for the 

 Maidan space they use for free every year.

 The deficit is reflected in the 

 virtual absence of modern technology, with not even a computer 

 in sight. The best the Parishad can do to slow down decay 

 today is a painstaking process of manually wrapping the 

 fragile scrolls in cloth and spraying them with insecticide 

 from time to time. A bunch of Tibetan scrolls has been stacked 

 up, almost touching the high ceiling and bathed in dust.

 Without basic tech tools, most 

 of the tomes and scrolls will perish.

 The collection at Bangiya 

 Sahitya Parishad is exceptional but the condition of books 

 and other artefacts is poor. These need to be preserved 

 properly and its very important that it be done immediately 

 with the help modern technology, said Mallika Sengupta, 

 who used to be a regular at the north Calcutta library set 

 up in 1894, with a current floating readership of around 

 1,200.

 The Parishad runs up huge establishment 

 costs. The two second-floor rooms full of century-old fragile 

 scrolls (punthi) have been air-conditioned to control the 

 moisture content, but the system is switched off after working 

 hours, apparently for fear of short circuit and burgeoning 

 electricity bills.

 A natural threat to the prized 

 possessions is rainwater. The terrace has developed 

 cracks and the roof leaks. This can damage the artefacts 

 on the third floor, warns Das.

 Last, there is the security aspect, 

 with the cover too thin for comfort. There are so 

 many artefacts like coins and statues packed into trunks. 

 But now we are planning to put some on display, for which 

 we are trying to rope in the Indian Museum A grant is on 

 its way from the central government which might make a little 

 difference, adds Das.

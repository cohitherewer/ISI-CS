 Calcutta, Aug. 4: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has made an ambassador for Bengal out of Richard A. Boucher. 

 The chief ministers dislike of the Indo-US strategic partnership his opposition to the nuclear deal is no secret did not come in the way of the Bhattacharjee-Boucher bonhomie. 

 Im very glad to be in Bengal, where the chief minister is doing so much. Heres someone in the system whos trying so hard to improve the situation. The meeting was a chance to look at the progress being made here, the US assistant secretary of state said after his hour-long meeting with Bhattacharjee. 

 On a one-day visit, Boucher formally opened the office of the US Commercial Service a wing of the US department of commerce to facilitate trade. He met representatives of the Indian Chamber of Commerce besides slipping into St Xaviers College for a session with the students. 

 Although Boucher discussed a range of contentious issues the nuclear deal, Israels attack on Lebanon, Pakistans alleged role in militancy and the mole row his focus was on business. 

 I have no problems working with the chief minister He is interested in opening opportunities for his people and so are we. We think we can play a role here, said Boucher, who talked about Deng Xiaoping, probably aware of Bhattacharjees admiration for the Chinese leader. 

 He invited the chief minister to visit the US to woo investors. A lot of preparation is required before I go there. When I am sufficiently prepared, I shall go, Bhattacharjee is said to have responded. 

 He rolled out his wish list more educational exchange and collaboration in manufacturing and small and medium enterprises. 

 Boucher promised to send a large business delegation later this year. Im talking to US companies about the scenario in Bengal, he said, reportedly suggesting an increase in investment in food-processing. 

 This could be seen as a sales pitch for Wal-Mart. Boucher said retail chain was a controversial issue even in the US, but added: In the long-term, the effects are positive.

 Nato calls

 SUJAN DUTTA 

 In the war zone

Brussels, Sept. 22: Nato, the US-led western military alliance, wants Indian troops for its missions in volatile regions like Afghanistan and Kosovo.

 Nato officials here at its headquarters said Indian troops would be part of a wider engagement the alliance envisages with non-member states. 

 The alliance does not expect Indian troops for its missions overnight but as a consequence of a protracted engagement that will drive policy change in New Delhi and reforms within Nato. 

 Beginnings have been made at two levels. Nato headquarters has briefed Indian diplomats here. Its secretary-general Jaap de Hoop Schaffer has met defence minister Pranab Mukherjee.

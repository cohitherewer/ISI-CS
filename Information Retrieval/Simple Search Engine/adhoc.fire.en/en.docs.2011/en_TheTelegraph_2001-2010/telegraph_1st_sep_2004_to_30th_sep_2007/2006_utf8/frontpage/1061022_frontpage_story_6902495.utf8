 Prayer advice to Pak team

 IMTIAZ GUL

 Islamabad, Oct. 21: Pakistans cricketers have been told to avoid exhibiting their religious beliefs in public.

 Pakistan Cricket Board chief Nasim Ashraf has said that amid concerns that the team was being used by religious elements, the players had been asked to strike a balance between religion and cricket.

 The cricketers regularly pray in public and hold religious gatherings at team hotels.

 Ashraf said he had no problems with the players saying their prayers. But he added: I have told him (captain Inzamam-ul Haq) there should be no pressure on players who dont pray regularly. There should be no perception that if they dont pray they will not be in the team. He has assured me there is no pressure.

 A leader of the Opposition Muttahida Majlis-e-Ammal has accused Ashraf of trying to please President Pervez Musharraf by peddling his philosophy of enlightened moderation.

 Track alert for rebel bandh

 OUR BUREAU

 Dhanbad, Oct. 29: The state has been put on high alert in view of the 24-hour bandh called by the CPI (Maoist) tomorrow, with a large number of trains either cancelled or having their routes diverted.

 Officials of the Dhanbad division of East Central Railway, unwilling to take any chances, have cancelled a number of trains and diverted the routes of several others for the next three days. 

 The CIC section of the division is vulnerable to rebel attacks.

 The New Delhi-Ranchi Rajdhani Express was diverted through Mughalsarai, Gomoh and Rajabera to Ranchi, avoiding its normal route via Mughalsarai, Chunar and Chaupan. The Howrah-Jabalpur Shaktipunj Express, too, went via Gomoh and Mughalsarai instead of its normal route of Barkakana-Chaupan.

 Among the trains cancelled tomorrow are the 3347 and 3347-A Palamau Link Express, 627 Up Barkakana-Mughalsarai passenger, 623 Up and 624 Down Barwadih-Chunar passenger and 737 Up Barwadih-Dehri-on-Sone passenger. 

 On October 31, the 3348 and 3348-A Palamau Link Express has been cancelled.

 The 8611 Up and 8612 Down Varanasi-Ranchi Intercity and 8101 Up and 8102 Down Tata-Amritsar Express will avoid the CIC section and ply on the Gomoh-Gomia-Mughalsarai route. The Hatia-Jammu Tawi Express will also ply along the diverted route.

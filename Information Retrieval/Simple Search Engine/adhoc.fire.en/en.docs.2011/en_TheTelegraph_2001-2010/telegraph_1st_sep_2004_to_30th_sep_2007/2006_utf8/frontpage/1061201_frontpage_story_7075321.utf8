 Bengal blast slur on NDFB

 - Bodo rebel provided RDX to KLO

 OUR BUREAU

 Nov. 

 30: An arrested member of the National Democratic 

 Front of Boroland (NDFB) was the lynchpin of 

 the militant squad that triggered the November 20 train 

 explosion at Belakoba in North Bengal, Assam police said 

 today.

 The revelation about an NDFB link in the blast that killed 10 people came less than 48 hours after the Bodo militant group extended its truce with Delhi and Dispur by six months. A few weeks ago, the NDFB reluctantly admitted that some its members kidnapped and killed five Sashatra Seema Bal personnel and a civilian earlier this year, albeit without the sanction of their leaders.

 Police said Addison Sangma, a Bodo militant who was arrested in the border district of Dhubri on Monday, not only supplied RDX to the Kamtapur Liberation Organisation (KLO) of North Bengal but also prepared the blueprint for the train attack. 

 Addison was the main provider (of RDX) to the KLO for the explosion. He provided shelter to the KLO militants who triggered the blast, Dhubri superintendent of police Parthasarothi Mahanta told The Telegraph.

 Interrogated by a team of Bengal, Assam and railway police, Addison said he harboured four KLO rebels in his house, helped them draw up the plan for the terror strike and arranged for arms, ammunition and explosives. Two of the rebels, Dhononjoy and Rahul, are on Bengal polices most-wanted list.

 He gave us enough information on the incident to come to a definite conclusion, Mahanta said.

 Another source said the KLO militants had planned to trigger more blasts in Cooch Behar but shelved the operation when they learnt that Sangma did not have the required stock of RDX with him at the time. 

 Addison was arrested at Chotopankhadol village, under Golokganj police station, during a joint raid by the armys Jat regiment and Assam police. The raid was carried out on the basis of information extracted by Jalpaiguri police from arrested KLO rebels.

 The KLO members reportedly told interrogators that an NDFB militant matching the polices description of Addison was maintaining links with both Ulfa and their organisation. A Government Railway Police team, led by deputy inspector-general (Jalpaiguri division) Thyaga Raju, reached Dhubri soon after to pursue the leads in the case. It transpired that Addison joined the NDFB in 2000 and started assisting Ulfa and the KLO after his outfit entered into a ceasefire agreement with Delhi and Dispur.

 Intelligence reports indicate that the KLO has been expanding its base with the help of Ulfa, the NDFB and the Achik National Volunteer Council, a militant group active in the Garo hills of Meghalaya.

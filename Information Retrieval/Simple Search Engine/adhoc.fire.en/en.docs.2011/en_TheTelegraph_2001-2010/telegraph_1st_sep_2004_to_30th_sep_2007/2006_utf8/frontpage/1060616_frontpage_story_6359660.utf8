 3 Haldia projects 

on Salim table

 OUR BUREAU

 Haldia/Calcutta, June 15: The Salim Group has on its radar a 25,000-acre chemical hub, industrial park and township ? all at Haldia.

 Benny Santoso, who heads the Indonesia-based conglomerate, today toured the project sites accompanied by Prasun Mukherjee, a businessman who is helping the company in its initiatives in Bengal, and government officials.

 Santoso will meet chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee tomorrow. 

 Of the 25,000 to 27,000 acres the group proposes to acquire at Haldia, around 10,000 acres are needed for the chemical hub, another 10,000 for the industrial park and 5,000-7,000 for a township with schools, colleges and hospitals.

 The industrial park will have the status of a special economic zone (SEZ). 

 We want them to invest in Haldia since we want to promote it as a chemical hub. Going by the plans the Centre has for Haldia, it will be possible to accommodate three to four SEZs there. The group might give us the detailed proposal for the food park tomorrow, said Sabyasachi Sen, the commerce and industry secretary.

 He did not expect Santoso to submit tomorrow detailed project reports for the SEZ and township at Haldia and the knowledge and health cities as well as the expressway the group will build in the 24 Parganas.

 On the way to Haldia, the team 

 stopped at Uluberia to inspect a 500-acre plot where the 

 Salim Group wants to create a food park, close to its two-wheeler 

 manufacturing unit.

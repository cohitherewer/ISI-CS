 Parties warm to bill

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 25: A consensus appears to be taking shape in favour of a comprehensive amendment bill, not a stand-by ordinance, to redefine the concept of office of profit.

 However, political parties have left it to the government to decide when Parliament should convene to pass the amendment. A session is unlikely before the Assembly elections end in May.

 After meeting L.K. Advani and Left leaders separately, parliamentary affairs minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi said: Everyone wants an amendment to the parent law comprehensively.

 The talks are learnt to have centred on several points. One, whether to issue an ordinance or a comprehensive bill. Two, if it is a bill, whether it should be comprehensive or a token amendment and three, when the House should be convened. 

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh took the initiative and deputed Das Munshi for the talks. Singh handed Das Munshi a four-point questionnaire and asked him to seek specific answers from the parties.

 Keen to avoid a replay of the controversy, an official took down the submissions. Singh is expected to convene an all-party meeting in the first week of April.

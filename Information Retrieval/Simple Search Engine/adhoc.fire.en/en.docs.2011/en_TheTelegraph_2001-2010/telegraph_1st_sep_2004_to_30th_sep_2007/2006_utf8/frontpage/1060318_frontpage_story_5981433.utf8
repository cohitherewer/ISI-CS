Calcutta, March 17: Angry junior doctors of a government hospital besieged a senior police officer late tonight during a protest against the alleged assault on one of them by relatives of a dead patient. 

 National Medical College and Hospital turned into a battleground after Aniruddha Basu, a junior doctor, was allegedly beaten up by relatives of Humayun Rashid, 45, who died in the evening after being admitted in the afternoon with a heart problem.

 Around 11 pm, when Vineet Goyal, the deputy commissioner of police of the eastern suburban division, rushed to the hospital with a team, he was surrounded by the junior doctors and interns, numbering around 200. The doctors had not released Rashids body.

 Goyal was rescued by a force beyond midnight after some 300 policemen descended on the hospital. Rashids body was also taken out at the time.

 The doctors had held the DC and other police officials hostage at RRM Block where the patient died, refusing to let them go unless security was strengthened. The hospital superintendent and his senior colleagues were also under siege.

 According to the police, Rashid was admitted to the medicine ward of RRM Block around 3 pm. He died around 7.30 pm. His relatives charged Basu, who was on duty, with negligence and allegedly beat him up, ransacking the ward.

 As the news spread, the junior doctors and interns rushed in from their hostels and closed the collapsible gate of RRM Block.

 The patients relatives, waiting outside the block to collect the body, broke the gate and went inside, but were pushed out by the doctors.

 Jamshed Alam, a relative, said: We have not come here to create any disturbance. The moment we get the body, we will leave, he added.

 Hollywood high road for Sabya Snail 

 SMITA ROY CHOWDHURY

 Mumbai, March 31: He has dressed Bollywood queen bee Rani Mukherjee in Black and Babul, but going by the way things are shaping up for Sabyasachi Mukherjee, the Calcutta boys creations might soon be draping Hollywood stars like Charlize Theron and Jennifer Aniston.

 The flood of orders that his collection, The Snail, bagged after yesterdays show at the Lakme Fashion Week in Mumbai had added up to Rs 70 lakh by tonight.

 The highlight among the big buys was Hollywood in the form of Tracey Ross, whose store at the Sunset Plaza boasts of star clients like Theron, Aniston, Kate Hudson and Johnny Depp.

 Tracey has placed a sizeable order for my collection and she has promised to use it for promotions for Hollywood, the designer said.

 The boyish smile that hasnt left his face since the show won applause and accolades for its refined simplicity just kept growing wider. This has been the best business I have got from a fashion week so far?

 And its not just a Hollywood high for Sabya. Londons leading fashion store Browns, which already hosts Sabyasachis creations on its racks, has placed a big order after yesterdays showing.

 The buyers list also includes Zenia Fashion and Moda Inn from Kuwait and Les Nomades, Geneva. Sabyasachis collections have always done very well at our store and we just love working with him, said Naser of Zenia Fashion.

 Before leaving for Mumbai, Sabyasachi had allowed The Telegraph a sneak peek of The Snail at his Tiljala workshop and said: This is my most mature and most evolved collection. This is a winner and I know it will take me very far internationally.

 Today, when Albert Morris of Browns was complimenting Sabyasachi for the best finishing of garments among designers from this part of the world, one knew exactly what the designer had been talking about.

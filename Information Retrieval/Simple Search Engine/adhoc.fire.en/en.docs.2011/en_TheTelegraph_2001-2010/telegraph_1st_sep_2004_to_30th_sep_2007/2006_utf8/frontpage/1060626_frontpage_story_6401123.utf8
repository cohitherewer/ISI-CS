 Modi face on condom packs

 - Effort under AIDS campaign leaves customers unimpressed 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Modi, Bhatt: Faces 

 to launch a thousand condoms 

 Ahmedabad, June 25: Raman Singh put his pictures in Chhattisgarhs school textbooks, hoping to catch em young. Fellow BJP chief minister Narendra Modi wants to catch them slightly older ? and more interested.

 Perhaps figuring out that nothing sells like sex, Modi has lent his face to huge crates of condom and contraceptive pills that have suddenly appeared in every ration shop across Gujarat.

 The shopkeepers have been asked to open the boxes before every customer, man or woman, of the appropriate age and persuade them to take their pick. Early reports suggest that many customers have found the gimmick in bad taste.

 The crates, despatched to ration shops this month under an AIDS awareness and family planning scheme called Kalyan Chhaap, carry photographs of Modi and his health minister, Ashok Bhatt. Dubbed condom boxes by shopkeepers, each contains 1,000 condoms and strips of contraceptives for free distribution.

 We are supposed to keep this box on our counter and open it before our customers, including women, and tell them they can take anything they want, said a shopkeeper in the chief ministers Maninagar constituency in Ahmedabad. But many of my customers, especially women, have taken offence.

 Congress leader and former education minister Hasmukh Patel agrees. By showing their faces on condom boxes, the chief minister and his health minister have proved they lack a sense of decency; they dont know how to inform the people.

 Bhatt, however, is unfazed. Theres nothing wrong in getting our photos printed on the condom boxes, the health minister said. 

 After all, AIDS awareness 

 is our programme like any other government programme. Why 

 shouldnt we take credit for what we are doing? 

 he asked.

 Bhatt claimed the programme was getting a good response in the rural areas.

 AIDS activists support the scheme and dont care much if the boxes carry ministers pictures.

 Except for a small section 

 of people, I dont think anybody will object to free 

 condom distribution at government ration shops, said 

 Prof Gaurang Jani, who teaches sociology at Gujarat University. 

 This only indicates Modis political will. I 

 have no problem with it.

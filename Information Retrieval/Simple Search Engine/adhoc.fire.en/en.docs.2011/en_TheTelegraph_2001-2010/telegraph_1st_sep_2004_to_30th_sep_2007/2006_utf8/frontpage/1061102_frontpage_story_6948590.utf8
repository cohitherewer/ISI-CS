harp on 

jihadi 

threat

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Guwahati, Nov. 1: Police chiefs of the northeastern states today said the security establishment must shift focus from Jammu and Kashmir to this part of the country if it is to contain jihadi elements.

 Jihadi terrorism and export of fundamentalism is a matter of grave concern for us...It is an important subject which we will be discussing, Assam director-general of police D.N. Dutt said, setting the tone for the deliberations at the two-day annual conference of police chiefs of the region.

 Senior officials of the Union home ministry, Subsidiary Intelligence Bureau, paramilitary forces and West Bengal police are also attending the conference.

 Inaugurating the conclave, chief minister Tarun Gogoi said the threat from jihadi elements and human trafficking were the two most serious problems that the police needed to address. He also stressed the need for intelligence-sharing and co-ordinated operations by the police and other security agencies.

 Chief secretary S. Kabilan said Delhi had consistently underplayed the fact that the Northeast is vulnerable to infiltration by extremists from across the international borders. Sometimes I wonder if the policy planners in Delhi have an understanding of the complexities of the region... and the immense threat to the integrity of the country emerging from across the border(s). Even today, the central intelligence apparatus does not have much of a presence here, he said.

 S.K. Sarkar, additional director-general of police (Intelligence) of West Bengal police, told the media on the sidelines of the conference that Ulfa and the KLO were establishing camps in Bhutan and Nepal. He said both outfits were being helped by the Maoists of Nepal.

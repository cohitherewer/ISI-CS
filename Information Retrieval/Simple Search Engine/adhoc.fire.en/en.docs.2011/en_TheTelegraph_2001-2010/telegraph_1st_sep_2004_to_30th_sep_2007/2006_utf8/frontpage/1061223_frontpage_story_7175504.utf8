 Girl says ex shot her, cops sceptical

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Dec. 22: A lovers tiff gone horribly wrong, or a lie to cover up for the family?

 Thats the question police are grappling with, as they investigate the mysterious firing on a Delhi University student in Noida this evening.

 Twenty-year-old Pooja claims she was returning home after tuition when her former boyfriend his name is not clear shot at her from a revolver.

 She has told us that ever since they broke up two months back, he had been following her around and harassing her, said sub- inspector S.P. Malik at the Noida Sector 20 police station, where the case has been registered.

 Pooja even cited her ex-boyfriends crazy behaviour as the reason she broke up with him, the police said.

 Today, she said, he was waiting outside her teachers house in Sector 26 in Noida, where Pooja lives as well and shot at her without saying a word.

 She is now convalescing at Noidas Kailash Hospital, where doctors say she is stable.

 The bullet basically skimmed her body. She is not critical and could be back home by tomorrow. There is no reason for anxiety, said Dr Ramina Luthra. 

 The police suspect Pooja is trying to find scapegoats to cover up for her family.

 Noida police officers said preliminary enquiries were already conclusive on one point: Pooja, according to them, is lying.

 We have spoken to her teacher, the paanwala there, and all others present there. Not one person has confirmed the incident, said B.P. Singh Yadav, station house officer at the Sector 20 police station and the investigating officer in the case.

 According to Yadav, Pooja never even left her home.

 Servants at her residence have confirmed that she never left her house, he said.

 Although Yadav said it was too early to have any suspects, the polices line of argument suggests Poojas family members are on the list.

 Several members of the extended family had gathered for a private occasion, the police said. At her house, nobody would speak.

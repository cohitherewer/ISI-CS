 Caution cancels IAS exam

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 16: After CAT and medical entrance exams, the civil services do not like to take chances with a potential scandal.

 The civil services (preliminary) examination for public administration has been cancelled after it was found that the number of question papers at a centre did not tally with the scheduled figure. 

 The candidates will now have to take another test on June 18. Information on the venue and time of the re-examination and admit cards are being mailed to the candidates, the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) said.

 The examination for the optional subject of public administration bearing subject code 22 was held on May 14. Around 3.5 lakh aspirants had taken the preliminary examinations but the number of candidates for the public administration test was not available.

 On the same day, it came to the notice of the UPSC that one of the examination centres had received fewer question papers than it should have. 

 We did not receive any complaint or allegation of leak or any malpractice, but it was decided to cancel the examination to keep the standard of the most prestigious service examinations high, UPSC chairperson Gurcharan Jagat said.

 The UPSC chief did not mention it but there has been a series of scandals related to examinations involving some of the most prized careers in the country.

 First, the question paper for CAT, the common admission test conducted by the IIMs, got leaked. Then, doctors were caught cheating at the entrance examination to post-graduate courses.

 Sources said though there was no evidence of a leak, the UPSC has ordered an inquiry.

 The anomaly was noticed at one of the sub-centres in Delhi. Though the number of question papers was enough for the candidates there, it was less than what the centre should have received, the UPSC chairperson said. 

 Praveen Chauhan, a Delhi University student who took the test, said the re-examination gives more credibility to the selection procedure. I am happy about the UPSC not taking any chance. It is quite possible that the paper was leaked, Chauhan said.

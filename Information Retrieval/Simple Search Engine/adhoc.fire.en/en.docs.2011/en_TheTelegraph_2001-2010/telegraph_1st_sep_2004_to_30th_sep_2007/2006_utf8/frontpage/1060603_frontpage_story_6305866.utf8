 Tourists depart with one dead

 SUJAN DUTTA 

 Swaraj Datta 

 Srinagar, June 2: Swaraj Datta, the tourist from Calcutta who was critically injured in a grenade attack on Wednesday died of his wounds in the Sardar Maharaja Hari Singh Hospital here this morning. 

 Dattas body was embalmed and flown to Calcutta late this afternoon. 

 Datta, a diabetic with a history of hypertension, had multiple perforations in his lower abdomen from the blast. 

 Datta was travelling with his wife Bithi, son Sujoy, Sujoys father-in-law Biplab Datta and his wife Rubita.

 His daughter-in-law, Sumona, is still in a hospital here. She was seriously injured in the legs but was said to have stabilised after a seven-hour surgery and 13 bottles of blood. 

 Doctors first considered amputating her legs but reconsidered the decision after her mother-in-law pleaded with them. 

 Sumona will go to Calcutta only after doctors here certify that she is fit to be flown. 

 Most of the tourists in the two buses that were attacked at Gurdukadal and Dal Gate have left for Calcutta. 

 Fourteen tourists who were with Bidisha Travels of Barrackpore, including four-year-old Tamali and her parents, flew to Delhi this morning en route Calcutta. 

 Of the 42 tourists in the group organised by Bidisha Travels, 27 have left by road to Jammu. 

 CPM MP Amitava Nandi was coordinating efforts to get a special AC III-tier coach allotted for the traumatised group from Jammu. 

 Paresh Mandal of Bidisha Travels said the group may stay overnight in Jammu if their coach was not allotted for this evening. 

 Till this afternoon, 24 of a group of 36 tourists with Rocky Travels left by bus for Jammu and they were also likely to be on the train. 

 Surojit Datta, the tour operator, said arrangements for the others depended on their fitness. 

 The Srinagar superintendent of police (tourism) M.S. Punoo, who was overseeing the arrangements, said five of the tourists were likely to leave tomorrow. Four of them are still in hospital. 

 Apart from Sumana, doctors were also attending to Ashok Ghosh, who has splinter injuries on the right side of his head.

 Teacher held over rape bid

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, April 1: A 40-year-old teacher of a school in Tangra was arrested today on the charge of attempting to rape a child who was appearing for the annual examination.

 Biswajit Roy of Panchkari Radharam Adarsha Vidyalaya took the nine-year-old girl inside an empty room on the pretext of helping her to solve the English question paper and tried to assault her, the deputy commissioner of police (eastern suburban division), Vineet Goyal, said.

 Preliminary investigation suggested that the teacher has been sexually abusing the girl over the past one week. Today, he took the girl inside the room around 10.30 am. We have registered an attempt to rape case. The girl has been sent for medical test, Goyal said.

 The girl, the daughter of a trader, returned home around 11.30 am. Two classmates, who are said to have passed by the room and seen the incident, also accompanied her.

 She went to the toilet. I could not believe what the classmates told me. After 15 minutes, she came out and started crying on my lap. Then she narrated the incident, her mother said.

 She and some neighbours rushed to the school. But the headmaster asked us to leave. Then we went to Tangra police station, the mother added.

 The headmaster of the primary section, Sunil Mondal, later said: Its a very shocking incident. I am not aware what exactly happened.

 Tension ran high in the area and a crowd blocked traffic on Christopher Road, where the school is located.

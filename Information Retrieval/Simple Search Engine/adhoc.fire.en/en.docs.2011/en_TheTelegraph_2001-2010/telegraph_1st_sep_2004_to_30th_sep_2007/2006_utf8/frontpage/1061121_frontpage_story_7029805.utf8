 DC faces axe for code break 

 SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA

 Ranchi, Nov. 20: Ajay Kumar Singh, the deputy commissioner of Deoghar, is set to get the marching orders, apparently for rubbing Chief Justice M. Karpagavinayagam the wrong way.

 The senior official was not present to receive the chief justice during his tour of Deoghar last week.

 Taking serious view of the matter, chief minister Madhu Koda paid a courtesy call on the chief justice today and apologised. 

 The deputy commissioners decision not to receive and see the chief justice off was really shocking. Koda could not have condoned such a lapse, said a source. 

 However, officials at the chief ministers office here said Kodas courtesy call was prescheduled.

 Justice Karpagavinayagam was on a two-day official visit to Giridih and Deoghar and attended a programme held by the district legal services authority last week. He is said to have expressed anger at the DC there. 

 I have been told by judicial officers they had received bad treatment from the DC, said the chief justice.

 The chief justice not only disallowed the DC, the vice-president of the district legal services authority, to light the ceremonial lamp but also stopped him from proposing the vote of thanks. Police superintendent Suman Gupta did the honours.

 The outburst is said to be the culmination of several complaints against the DC. 

 Earlier, Singh was said to have refused meeting Justice N.N. Tiwary, the inspecting judge of the Deoghar court. 

 Although there is no mention in the rulebook to receive or see off a chief justice, there are certain unwritten rules too, said an IAS officer.

 Cabinet secretary Aditya Swaroop said according to protocol, the DC should personally receive the President, Prime Minister, governor, chief minister and Union cabinet ministers.

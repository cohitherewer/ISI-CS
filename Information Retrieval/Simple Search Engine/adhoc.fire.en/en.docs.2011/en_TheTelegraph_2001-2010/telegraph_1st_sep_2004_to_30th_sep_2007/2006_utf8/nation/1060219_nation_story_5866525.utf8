 Chirac takes off, fighter in pocket

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 A Rafale fighter

 New Delhi, Feb. 18: French President Jacques Chirac, who is due here tomorrow, is expected to offer the Rafale fighter aircraft for an Indian Air Force order of multi-role combat aircraft that could top $8 billion.

 The Rafale is a fourth-generation fighter aircraft and its first technology demonstrator was built in 1984-85 and exhibited its prowess with touch- and-go landings on the deck of the Clemenceau, the asbestos-laden French aircraft carrier that Chirac has ordered back to France in the middle of its voyage to the Alang shipbreaking yard in Gujarat.

 France was in the running in the IAF competition with Dassault Aviations Mirage 2000-V but the company is understood to have conveyed to India that it cannot keep its assembly lines running in expectation of the air force order. 

 The Rafale is heavier and more expensive than the Mirage ? a variant of which is already operational in the IAF ? but it is under production.

 Rafale is also a Dassault product and incorporates avionics and systems from, among others, Thales, which last year won the $3.5-billion Scorpene submarine order from the Indian Navy.

 The first squadrons of the Rafale in the French Air Force are expected to be operational in six months and projected orders for the aircraft from Frances air force and navy are for 300 aircraft. 

 Among others who had responded to the IAFs request for information are Lockheed Martins F-16 and Boeings F/A-18 EF Super Hornet (US), the Gripen Jas 39 (Saab, Sweden), RSK MiG Corporations MiG 29M/M2 (Russia).

 But the IAF expects more manufacturers, including the Euro fighter Typhoon, to formally bid for the order once the global tender is issued.

 The IAF was interested in taking a look at the F-16 with the Active Electronic Scanned Array (AESA) radar which Washington is yet to clear for the manufacturers to present to India.

 The French are likely to offer the Rafale with the AESA for which Dassault has roped in two companies, Thales and SNECMA.

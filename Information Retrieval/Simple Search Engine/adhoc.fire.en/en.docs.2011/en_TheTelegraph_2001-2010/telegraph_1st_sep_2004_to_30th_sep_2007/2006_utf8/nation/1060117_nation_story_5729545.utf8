 IIM lines up fresh plea

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi/Bangalore, Jan. 16: IIM Bangalore is likely to file a fresh application with the Centre for setting up a campus in Singapore following the human resource development ministrys refusal to clear the first request.

 Sources said Reliance Industries Mukesh Ambani, who is associated with IIM Bangalore, may take up the issue with the Centre. They said the IIM is still keen to go ahead with the overseas project as such an initiative would enhance its brand profile.

 Officials in the central ministry, however, were tight-lipped and refused to say whether there could be a reversal of its stand. The officials also declined to reply to questions whether not allowing IIM Bangalore to set up a campus abroad was a policy decision or a one-time order.

 Last week, the HRD ministry had turned down the IIMs request, saying that the management school should first meet internal requirements. Critics of the HRD ministrys decision have contended that if domestic demand has to be met first, it will be such a long-drawn exercise that any overseas venture in the near future is implausible.

 Among the few who welcomed the decision was Murli Manohar Joshi, who held charge of the HRD ministry before Arjun Singh took over. IIM Bangalores best bet may lie in the discomfiture of Singh ? who considers himself the secular spearhead of the UPA government ? at being seen on the side of Joshi, who is counted among the BJP hardliners.

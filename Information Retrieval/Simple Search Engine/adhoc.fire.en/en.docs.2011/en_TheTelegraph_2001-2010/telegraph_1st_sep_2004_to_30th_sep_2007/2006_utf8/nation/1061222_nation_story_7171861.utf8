 Bush gets PMs greetings, concerns

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Dec. 22: Seasons greetings, garnished with some nuclear concerns.

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today passed on to President George W. Bush Delhis concerns about some aspects of the civil nuclear cooperation bill, hoping they will be addressed in the bilateral agreement. 

 Bush (in picture) phoned Singh this evening, three days after he put his stamp of approval on the Henry J. Hyde US-India Peaceful Atomic Energy Cooperation Act. 

 With Christmas and New Year round the corner, Singh conveyed the seasons greetings to the President and his wife.

 The Prime Minister said India still has some concerns, though many have already been addressed in the Presidents signing statement, the PMO said. Both leaders expressed hope that the remaining concerns will be addressed in the next stage of negotiations.

 Delhi hopes the bilateral 123 agreement would not contain extraneous and prescriptive provisions that have been included in the waiver bill. 

 Singh had assured Parliament earlier this week that the government would negotiate hard with the US to ensure that the contentious issues were kept outside the bilateral agreement which would be binding on India. 

 The two leaders expressed happiness at the strengthening of the bilateral relations highlighted in President Bushs initiative to amend US laws to enable bilateral civil nuclear cooperation, which received strong bipartisan support in the US Congress, the PMO statement said. 

 Indias main concerns are about the provisions that might put a cap on the countrys strategic nuclear programme and undermine independence of its foreign policy. 

 Bush had sought to make things easier for Singh by saying that certain portions of the bill were merely advisory in nature.

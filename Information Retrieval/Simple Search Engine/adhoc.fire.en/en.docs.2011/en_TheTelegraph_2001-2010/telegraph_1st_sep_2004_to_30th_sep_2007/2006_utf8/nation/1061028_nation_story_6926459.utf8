 Calling visa bonus 

 Kuala Lumpur, Oct. 27 (PTI): Indian workers flying into Malaysia can now apply for calling visas, a facility which is likely to reduce the waiting time for employers who will receive them.

 The calling visas are similar to the visa-on-arrival facility extended to tourists and businessmen, deputy home affairs minister Tan Chai Ho said. Workers from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal will receive these visas at Kuala Lumpur airport. They dont need to apply at the Malaysian high commission, he said.

 Before they come here, their employers in Malaysia should have forwarded their names and details to the one-stop centre at the immigration headquarters for processing and approval, Tan was quoted as saying by Star newspaper.

 The arrangement is likely to cut down the waiting time for employers from between one and two months to one and two weeks, the paper said.

 Once approved, the bosses receive the work permits and they can contact the workers to fly to Malaysia. They can apply for the visas when they reach KLIA (the airport), Tan said.

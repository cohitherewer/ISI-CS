 An F-16: Tough bargaining on

 Islamabad, Sept. 11: Pakistans long-delayed F-16 purchase from the US has stalled again just before the two sides were to ink the deal as Islamabad has realised that the jets would be useless in combat with the Indian Mirage 2000.

 Pakistan was to sign what is called a letter of acceptance with the US to buy at least 18 new F-16 multi-role combat aircraft. But Pakistan Air Force (PAF) officials informed General Pervez Musharraf a week ago that the aircraft did not have the electronic warfare system they want.

 Musharraf, who began a three-nation tour today that also takes him to the US, was told that without this system the F-16s would be good only for training and not for combat with the Indian Mirage 2000 or any other Nato (the US-led western military alliance) aircraft.

 This means any Nato aircraft attacking the F-16s from beyond visual range could take them out like sitting ducks. The F-16s would not know when they would be locked in the sight of the adversary and would be unable to take evasive action. 

 With Pakistani officials raising this issue, the visit from Washington for which President George Bush had nominated a special envoy to participate in the signing ceremony scheduled for September 9 was called off.

 The PAF is to buy at least 44 F-16s from the US under a $5-billion package. They include 18 brand new latest F-16s of C and D version and 26 used jets.

 Concerned over the absence of an effective electronic warfare system, Pakistani defence officials had requested the US Secretary Air Force International Affairs, which is the coordinator and supervisor for the project, to grant another extension till December 31 (the previous extension passed off on July 31) to seal the deal. 

 Musharraf is expected to try to extract some concessions when he meets Bush towards the end of this month.

 The two countries have remained engaged in negotiations on F-16s amid concerns expressed by several US Congressmen about possible transfer of technology to China by Pakistan. 

 China has been closely working with Pakistan on nuclear and defence armament programmes. 

 We understand US concerns are largely China-centric, said a key figure related to the F-16 deal.

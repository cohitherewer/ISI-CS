 Court ruffles House 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New 

 Delhi, Dec. 7: The Opposition has asked the Prime 

 Minister to call a meeting of party leaders to discuss turf 

 wars between the judiciary and Parliament.

 The suggestion came after CPI member Gurudas Dasgupta raised the subject in the Lok Sabha, accusing the judiciary of over-activism and of interfering in the domains of the legislature and executive.

 As MPs from many other parties also wanted to speak, Speaker Somnath Chatterjee agreed to a fuller discussion sometime later under Rule 193. Dasgupta had raised the issue through a calling attention motion, which doesnt allow a long discussion.

 The deputy leader of the Opposition, V.K. Malhotra, suggested that Manmohan Singh summon an all-party meeting before the discussion, so that Parliament can hold a proper debate.

 Dasgupta was speaking on the need for harmonious functioning of the three organs of the state: legislature, judiciary and executive. He alleged a lack of harmony and cited three instances.

 One, the Supreme Court notice to the Speaker over an issue decided by the Lok Sabha in its own wisdom the expulsion of 10 MPs in the cash-for-questions scam.

 Two, the court setting up a committee to monitor if its Delhi sealing orders were being implemented. Three, an apex court observation against industrial strikes.

 The CPI leader argued that the large number of public interest litigations had created a situation where the judiciary was infringing on Parliaments domain.

 The government, however, took a restrained view.

 Law minister H.R. Bhardwaj said the Constitution had built-in checks and balances, and each organ of the state was accountable in one form or the other.

 SC on Speakers

 The Supreme Court today rejected arguments that the actions of the Speaker of a legislature were above judicial scrutiny. Unlike in other countries the Speaker does not resign from the political party from which he had been elected to the House, a five-member Constitution bench said. Therefore, it said, a Speaker cannot be considered absolutely impartial.

 The observations came as the court heard arguments on the constitutional validity of the Bahujan Samaj Party split in August 2003 that allowed Mulayam Singh Yadav to form the government in Uttar Pradesh. The Speaker had recognised the defection by 37 BSP members.

 Confessions of a cop

 - Bombers were experts, we are groping

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, July 20: The highly 

 tech-savvy professionals who carried out the July 11 blasts 

 have left Indian explosives experts groping for non-existent 

 clues, says a web site.

 But this isnt the Lashkar-e-Toiba crowing after a successful strike. This is a sulky Mumbai police chief explaining why his men shouldnt be criticised even after failing to make any headway in nine days of investigations.

 Police commissioner Anami Roy has gone and done something unprecedented ? he has sat down at his desk at police headquarters, written a 1,500-word article attacking what he sees as unjustified media criticism and posted it on the city polices web site.

 Roy is at pains to explain the difference between the 1993 blasts and the 7/11 bombings. Dawood Ibrahims amateurish henchmen had strewn the city with unexploded bombs in cars and scooters, handing the sleuths just the clues they were looking for.

 The train blasts, however, were a textbook terrorist strike carried out with clockwork precision by professionals.

 It was not a simple crime. It was done and executed by a most professional and techno-savvy group, and with high precision. It was well-planned to the last bit, the article on www.Mumbaipolice.org rues.

 We didnt come across any bombs that were unexploded, and we didnt find a single trace of the bombs on any site. The investigation is difficult. Our explosive experts are groping?. We are doing our best. But our best is still not enough.

 Roy has accused the media of spreading disinformation by alleging a rift between him and director-general P.S. Pasricha. News reports have cited how Roy, anti-terrorist squad chief K.P. Raghuvanshi and Pasricha were speaking in different voices.

 Call us a force of jokers? and we will accept that. But, when you write that this might not have happened if the encounter specialists were around, that is detrimental, Roy complains.

 A former IPS official frowned on Roys efforts, saying: This is no time for police to be rhetorical? police need to be action-oriented, and should be focusing on catching the culprits instead of writing such articles.

 He said Mumbai police had made no attempts to trace the funds trail behind the attacks or seek the help of agencies like Americas Federal Bureau of Investigations.

 No-trust bid

 The Opposition tried to table a no-confidence motion against the states Democratic Front government in the Assembly amid chaotic scenes on Thursday but was not allowed to. The Shiv Sena-BJP members blamed the government for the failure to prevent the train blasts.

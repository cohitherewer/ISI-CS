 Varanasi, March 8: Her head bandaged and face contorted in pain, the 21-year-old Japanese was shuffling with difficulty across the lawns of Sir Sunderlal Hospital this afternoon.

 Rikuta Chiharus eyes betrayed the emotion most foreign tourists were feeling a day after serial blasts rocked this temple town: a frightened bewilderment. I dont know? dont ask me, its painful despite the sedatives.

 Rikuta had been sitting with many others near the foreign tourists assistance booth at the Cantonment station last evening when one of the bombs went off. The splinters hit her on the head and shoulder.

 Please leave her alone, she cant even stand. She is under high sedation, pleaded her companion, a Japanese man in his mid-twenties, without identifying himself.

 He helped her into a car and they were off to their hotel, where they would have to make a decision: whether to continue with their Indian trip.

 Rikuta may have been unluckier than most, but the hundreds of foreign tourists here, largely unhurt physically, are nevertheless grappling with a sudden sense of horror and insecurity. Many have been frantically calling up their embassies or local travel agents to find out how soon they can head back home.

 The US tourists appear to be panicking the most. Some are rescheduling their plans and leaving for other places in India, but many have decided to return home, said Arup Srivastava, a tourism official.

 A source in a five-star hotel said 50 Americans had sent SOS messages to a travel agent for air tickets from Mumbai back to their country.

 Varanasi, with its reputation of being the leading centre of Indian mysticism down the centuries, draws thousands of foreign tourists every year, with March setting off the peak season.

 Im scared. Yes, the mood in Varanasi has changed suddenly, said Californian Jordana Stein, 22, as she nervously moved around the station area. Jordana, like her fellow American tourists, had cancelled her boating plans for the morning and stayed indoors till late afternoon.

 I came here to see if I could get tickets to other places in India. Maybe Ill go to Agra. I love India.

 The scene at the Cantonment stations tourism office would have done nothing to encourage her. With the blast taking place just six feet away, it was the worst-hit site at the station. The tourists have been coming to the office, giving it a nervous look and making for the ticket counters.

 Nicolas Nadime, a 24-year-old French, looked less unnerved. Has he decided to leave? You suggest what I should do. Should I stay back? he asked, looking rather undecided. He then told his female companion: Maybe we will go to Darjeeling now.

 US condemns blasts

 The US has condemned the Varanasi blasts, calling them acts of terrorism. If you take a look at it, it is quite clear that these are acts of terrorism.... So we would certainly condemn these acts, state department spokesman Sean McCormack said.

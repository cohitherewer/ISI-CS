 on twin peaks

 China has no selfish interest

 New Delhi, Nov. 22: The two highlights of President Hu Jintaos visit to India have been the renewed commitment to complete the alignment of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) through the exchange of maps and the hint that China might change its attitude to India-US civilian nuclear cooperation. 

 A number of small decisions from a Calcutta-to- Kunming car rally, opening a consulate in Calcutta, proposing joint exploration and development of oil and gas in third countries to sharing flood-season hydrological data on trans-border rivers were also taken. Together, they add up to a substantive relationship in the offing.

 On the border question, the two sides agreed to do more than continue the talks between the two special representatives M.K. Narayanan and vice-foreign minister Dai Bingguo. Once the special representatives were appointed, the exchange of maps and defining the LAC was given up. This work will be restarted.

 Now, the two sides have agreed to complete the process of exchanging maps, indicating their respective perceptions of the entire alignment of the LAC on the basis of already agreed parameters as soon as possible. 

 The Joint Working Group on the boundary has been asked to expedite its work, including on the clarification and confirmation of the Line of Actual Control and the implementation of confidence-building measures.

 The second issue of significance that the two sides addressed was of civilian nuclear cooperation. Although the significance of this issue need not be exaggerated, it has to be seen in the context of the ongoing process of Indo-US civilian nuclear cooperation. 

 The nuclear cooperation issue could have been kept out with China claiming that there was no point discussing it bilaterally till the Nuclear Suppliers Group changed its rules in view of the Indo-US deal. 

 That an acceptable formulation (the two sides agree to promote cooperation in the field of nuclear energy, consistent with their respective international commitments) has been found suggests that Beijing wants to adopt a positive approach to the issue. Beijing is hinting that it might be willing to change its positions with changing international commitments. 

 That China does not see the NSG guidelines as written in stone is clear from the two sides emphasising innovative and forward-looking approaches to promote international civilian nuclear cooperation.

 Beijings implicit recognition of India as a nuclear weapons power is also evident in the joint statement claiming that both are committed to non-proliferation objectives and agree to expand their dialogue on the related issues, in bilateral and international fora. This takes Indias possession of nuclear weapons for granted and not as proliferation. It says that henceforth India and China would together pursue non-proliferation objectives. The statement excludes any lingering problems about Indias nuclear status.

 On Chinas position on Indias ambition to be a permanent member of the UN Security Council, Beijing has found language that does not support India categorically while encouraging Indias aspirations to play a greater role in the United Nations. It is a clever formulation that can neither give India satisfaction nor cause dissatisfaction.

 On trade, no new ground has been broken. At the present rate of growth, the bilateral trade in any case could be about $40 billion by 2010. However, there is little doubt that trade lends substance to the Sino-Indian relationship without trade, the relationship would be entirely rhetorical. And trade between India and China is growing. 

 Therefore, it may not be entirely correct to dismiss the visit as a mere pro forma gesture and as a prelude to doing bigger things with Pakistan when President Hu goes there later this week. Beijings relationship with Islamabad is of a different kind than with India and much more geo-politically oriented.

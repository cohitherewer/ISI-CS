 Rae Bareli, May 7: Hes not a brilliant speaker. There are no comic interludes or philosophical pauses. His demeanour is expressionless and his body language stiff. The only moments when his face lights up or puckers into a frown are when he spots a child or old woman waving from the crowd, or when an eager beaver interrupts him with a Rahul Gandhi zindabad cry.

 Before it pronounces its verdict on Sonia Gandhi, Rae Bareli has done so on her son and election manager. 

 The overwhelming judgement is he has emerged as a political personality in his own right, left his imprint on the constituency, and has done enough to qualify as the Congress president or the Prime Minister or, ideally, both in the near future.

 Hes a photocopy of his father, declared Rajesh Chowdhury, chairman of the Sehegaon village committee.

 Even sister Priyanka, who arrived yesterday to oversee the final phase of election management, said Rahul had done remarkably well and there was little left for her to do.

 So, what was Rahuls contribution?

 He has breathed life into a dead party organisation, said Indresh Vikram Singh, the Rae Bareli Congress committee general secretary. The impossible, he explained, was not achieved through personal charm or charisma or networking. Hes systematic, he makes plans that are vetted and approved; and once thats done, everything has to work according to plan.

 While the BJP had for long adopted the slogan of 10 youths for every booth without being able to make it work, Congress sources said that without any sloganeering, Rahul created an 11-member committee for each of the 1,279 booths in his mothers constituency. A record unmatched by even cadre-based parties such as the Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party.

 Singh said the first thing Rahul did was work with the block- and panchayat-level party committees to identify 11 young people committed to the Congress ideology.

 He believes in the Congresss original philosophy of lok kalyan (peoples welfare) and doesnt think about juggling caste equations.

 The data on the booth managers and selectors were fed into Rahuls laptop so that when the result is out, Rahul can identify the quantum of individual dedication and build a line of grassroot leadership.

 Rae Bareli is the laboratory and if it succeeds, it will be replicated in the other constituencies, said state Congress spokesman Akhilesh Pratap Singh.

 In Amethi, his Lok Sabha constituency, Rahul has drafted two former police officers sympathetic to the Congress to train youths in the partys ideology, his style of working and the United Progressive Alliance governments social sector programmes.

 Sources said the idea was to raise an army of grassroot propagandists to carry the Congresss message to every corner of Amethi.

 In Rae Bareli, his theme was development. He said the Mulayam Singh Yadav government was bent on scuttling the development schemes in the area to deny Soniaji the credit, and therefore it was important to send her back to the Lok Sabha.

 There was no reference to the office-of-profit controversy or his mothers sacrifices. Whether he spoke in a backward caste-dominated village like Sehegaon or a Muslim-majority hamlet like Hasanganj, the content was identical and devoid of sectional appeal.

 This, according to Jagat Narayan, a booth worker in Sehegaon, was a positive.

 Sonias opponents in this election are from the backward castes. Our village is full of backward castes, and yet not a vote will go to the others. We have benefited from the Indira Gandhi canal and the roads that came up whenever Rae Bareli had a Congress MP.

 In an election dominated by what people described as junoon (craze) for Sonia and mohabbat (love) for Rahul, nobody else has a chance, claimed Ram Mishra of Neem Teekar village. This is an election which is not being fought by the Congress but by the people.

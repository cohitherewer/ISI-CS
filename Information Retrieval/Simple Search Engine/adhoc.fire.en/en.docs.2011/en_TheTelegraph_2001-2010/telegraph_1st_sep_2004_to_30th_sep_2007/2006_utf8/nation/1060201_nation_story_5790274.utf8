 Online help for American visas

 Mumbai (PTI): US embassy officials said on Tuesday that a new system of online application for visas has been put in place to give priority to emergency visa cases for people travelling to the US.

 We have started a new system where we can allot appointments for non-immigrant visa interviews according to priority and wherein the applicant can set up an appointment online, thus reducing the hassle of physically applying, William Bartlett, the head of visa operations for the embassy, said.

 The main reason to set up this facility was to give priority appointments to emergency cases, such as a medical emergency or a businessman who sees an opportunity. With this, we hope to be able to process business applications within two to three weeks. 

 Also through this online system, applicants can search for the best possible appointment, Bartlett said.

 HC fiat on nursery admission

 New Delhi (PTI): Delhi High Court on Tuesday granted private schools here the last opportunity to evolve a transparent and comprehensive policy and dispense with the practice of interviewing nursery students and their parents for admission within four weeks.

 A division bench of Justices Vijender Jain and Rekha Sharma had earlier, on a PIL filed by advocate Ashok Aggarwal, issued notices to the government and the private schools questioning the authority under which such interviews were being conducted in the capital.

 The case will be heard on February 28.

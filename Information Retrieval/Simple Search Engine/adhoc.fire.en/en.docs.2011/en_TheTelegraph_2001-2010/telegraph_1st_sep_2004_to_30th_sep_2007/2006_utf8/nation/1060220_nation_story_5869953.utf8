 Bengal sets alert guidelines

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Feb. 19: The state government today announced guidelines for early detection of bird flu in Bengal, telling poultry owners to send serum samples for laboratory tests if five or more birds die in their farms.

 If more than 10 per cent of the birds die in a poultry, it has to be closed down immediately, officials said a day after revelations that the bird flu virus, H5N1, had been detected in a northern Maharashtra poultry.

 The Calcutta Municipal Corporation has asked its health inspectors and doctors across all the 141 wards to inform poultry sellers at markets about the guidelines.

 If the virus is detected in a single bird anywhere, all poultry within a three-km radius will have to be culled while those in a seven-km radius beyond it must be vaccinated.

 The regulations will be made more stringent if the flu is detected in humans. Once that happens, outstation visitors will have to be screened, said health secretary Kalyan Bagchi.

 Not a single chicken or migratory bird, however, is known to have died of the disease in the state so far, animal resource development (ARD) secretary Subesh Das said. A total of 1,185 serum samples from the state have been sent to a Bhopal laboratory since last April, but none tested positive for the virus.

 The ARD secretary will meet poultry owners at Writers Buildings tomorrow to inform them about the symptoms of the disease in birds: drowsiness, lack of appetite, breathing trouble, movement in circles and death within 48 hours of falling sick.

 The government is also considering blocking entry of poultry from other states.

 We have to ensure that poultry from Maharashtra dont enter Bengal, a health department official said.

 Normally, when prices fall, traders try to channelise supply to other states. Bengal gets a large supply of eggs and chicken from Andhra Pradesh, which is not far from Maharashtra. There are chances of an infection travelling across the border.

 Senior ARD and health officials today met scientists of the Institute for Animal Health to chalk out a programme to contain a possible outbreak.

 The districts are being asked to step up surveillance on poultry farms. ARD officials will meet small poultry farmers in a surveillance drive between February 22 and 24, the health secretary said after the meeting.

 Rapid response teams, made up of ARD officials, have been readied in each district, the animal resource development secretary said. A thousand pieces of protective gear have been supplied to these teams. These officials will collect samples for testing in case of outbreaks.

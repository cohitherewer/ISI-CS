 Best Bakery ruling on Friday

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Feb. 21: The Best Bakery verdict, which was to be given today, will now come on Friday.

 After getting four extensions from the Supreme Court to conclude retrial in one of the worst Gujarat riot cases, a Mumbai sessions court announced today that it would deliver the operative ruling on February 24.

 Although additional sessions judge Abhay Thipsay gave no reason for reserving the verdict, court sources said he had been working on the judgment over the weekend and required a couple of days more to give it final shape.

 A total of 4,600 pages have been recorded as evidence. 

 Fourteen people were killed when a mob set ablaze Best Bakery in Vadodara on March 1, 2002.

 Zahira Sheikh, a key witness who later turned hostile, moved Supreme Court seeking retrial of the case outside Gujarat after a trial court in the state acquitted all the 21 accused of the attack on the bakery owned by her family.

 On April 12, 2004, the Supreme Court ordered a retrial and transferred the case to a special court in Mumbai. 

 Zahira, however, turned hostile and accused social activist Teesta Setalvad, who had backed her appeal for a retrial, of forcing her to lie in court. Her mother Sehrunissa, sister Saira and brothers Nafitullah and Nasibullah and two independent witnesses had turned hostile earlier.

 The Mumbai court framed charges in September 2004 and the trial began a month later. Although four of the 21 accused could not be traced, the remaining 17 accused were tried in Mumbai.

 This morning, all of them were brought to Thipsays court amid high security. They left crammed in a police vehicle, calling out to the media to take their photographs.

 The accused had some time ago approached Bombay High Court for bail because of the delay in judgment.

 While transferring the case from Gujarat, the apex court had directed Maharashtra to conclude the trial by December 31, 2004. However, the Mumbai court sought four extensions, the last of which expires on February 28.

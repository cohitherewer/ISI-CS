 Conversion law push

 Dangs (Gujarat), Feb. 12: The Sangh parivars Shabri Kumbh passed a resolution today urging state governments to enact laws to check religious conversions.

 On the second day of the Kumbh, thought up by the Sangh to push tribals towards Hindutva, participants expressed concern at what they described as mass conversion of Dalits and tribals. 

 In the absence of a central legislation, states should enact stringent laws to curb the illegal activities of Christian missionaries, the resolution said.

 RSS chief K. Sudarshan, VHP general secretary Praveen Togadia and Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan were present at the Kumbh. 

 The Arunachal and Gujarat governments should immediately notify the rules so that the main purpose of enacting such a legislation is fulfilled, it said. Anti-conversion laws are in force in both states.

 Israel, Korea, China, Sri Lanka and some Latin American nations already have such laws in place, and India should take a lesson from them, the resolution said.

 The inordinate increase in the population of Christians in Arunachal Pradesh, Tripura and Dadra and Nagar Haveli and of Muslims in the border states of Sikkim, Assam, Manipur and Tripura is a matter of concern and has grave national implications, it added.

 Another resolution passed at a congregation of saints (sant sammelan) said: It is time for all Hindutva forces to forget all differences of caste and creed and work together. It urged saints to fan out in villages to educate people against conversions.

 Earlier, Sudarshan said the time had come to take on anti-Hindu forces who, he claimed, were playing havoc with the tribal social structure through induced conversions. This has to be combated with everything at our command and with the use of tactics that the opponent has been using against us.

 The RSS chief said Muslims and Christians were also a part of the country, before adding: They must, however, stop looking for guidance abroad and Indianise their respective faiths so as to merge in the national mainstream.

 Togadia, who made an unscheduled appearance, offered an alliance of sorts to the Christian faith against Islam. But for this their conversion activity in India must stop forthwith, he said. 

 Christians in Dangs, who have been the target of attacks by fundamentalists in the past, are afraid the Kumbh will be followed by another reign of terror.

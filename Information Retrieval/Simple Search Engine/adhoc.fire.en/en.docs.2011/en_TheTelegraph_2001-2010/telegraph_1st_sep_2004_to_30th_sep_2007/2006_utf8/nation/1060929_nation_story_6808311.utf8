 Suspense on Rahul role

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 28: The suspense over whether Rahul Gandhi will get a bigger role in Congress affairs and the uncertainty over a new foreign minister show no signs of abating.

 According to Congress sources, Sonia Gandhi did declare that Rahul will be active in Uttar Pradesh politics before the Assembly elections early next year, but it is unclear whether she will exhaust what many call her trump card in the state.

 After Sonia hinted at the role she envisaged for her son, the immediate expectation was that the Amethi MP would be brought in as a general secretary with a specific responsibility, like looking after the frontal organisations (Youth Congress, the National Students Union of India, Seva Dal and others). Oscar Fernandes, a minister without portfolio in the government, is on the job now.

 About Rahul, a general secretary said since Sonia was at the height of her popularity as Congress president and UPA chairperson, there was no need to turn the focus away from her leadership by giving her son a bigger role. With over two years left for the next Lok Sabha elections, the question of who would lead the Congress and the UPA Sonia or Rahul was likely to be addressed and possibly resolved in 2008.

 One view is that rather than expend the Rahul card the Congress can hope to double its tally of 16 in the Uttar Pradesh polls at best it was better to let him work on his constituency and that of his mother. 

 Another section believes that Congress feeder channels like the Youth Congress and NSUI badly need a charismatic head. They function in an ad-hoc way. Fernandes is unable to devote much time and attention because his plate is full. We depend on these organisations to throw up and nurture our leaders and cadres, a source said.

 Rahul understands such problems and, therefore, would do something substantial once the party entrusts him with the task, the source added.

 At the moment, the only organisational change members are reasonably sure will be made is resolving Fernandess status. He could either be inducted into the party structure or continue as minister. 

 There is also a suggestion that Karnatakas representation among office-bearers of the Congress there are four general secretaries and one secretary from the state should be brought down. In all probability, Veerappa Moily may be divested of his position as general secretary because he is heading important government committees. 

 The vacancy caused by Ambika Sonis move to the government has to be filled, too. Asked about the timing of the organisational and cabinet shuffles, sources said nothing beyond soon enough.

 No deal yet, but nuclear fight rages

 K.P. NAYAR

 Washington, Feb. 12: Contrary to public perception, India did not at any stage offer to put its fast-breeder programme on the civilian nuclear list to be separated from military ones in order to move forward on the Indo-US nuclear deal.

 Nor did the Americans ask for it. Again, contrary to public perception, foreign secretary Shyam Saran did not submit to the Americans in December 2005 any list in black and white of facilities that would be exclusively used for civilian purposes.

 All he did at his meetings with the US under-secretary for political affairs, Nicholas Burns, was to discuss the broad parameters and yardsticks which would govern the separation of Indias civilian and military nuclear facilities, according to sources here and in New Delhi who are privy to their dialogue.

 But the shadow-boxing over the nuclear deal between the Prime Ministers Office and the ministry of external affairs on the one hand and the countrys nuclear establishment and the scientific community on the other has already ensured that the fast- breeder programme will now not be put on the civilian list.

 With his clever strategy of going public on an issue that was not yet on the table, Anil Kakodkar, the secretary of the department of atomic energy, has ensured that fast-breeders will now remain part of the countrys military nuclear programme.

 The nuclear establishment currently has an impressive eight reactors simultaneously under construction. When all its fast-breeders become fully operational by the end of this decade, significant amounts of weapons-grade plutonium for making more and advanced atomic bombs will become available.

 The nuclear deal, agreed between Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and American President George W. Bush in July last year, is like dinner guests fighting over food that is nowhere on the table. 

 It is unique in that it is an agreement, which has no text, no framework, no signatures, and, as of now, no convergence of views between governments which are supposedly parties to it.

 T.P. Sreenivasan, who was until recently Indias permanent representative to UN organisations in Vienna, including the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), says that in his 37 years as a diplomat, he has seen no other bilateral agreement (that) has been the subject of so much analysis before it came into effect.

 He told a group of think tanks in Washington recently that there is no consensus on it within the Indian establishment because the deal was still in a blueprint when it was revealed.

 Sreenivasan, who was at the Indian embassy in Moscow in the early years of implementation of the Indo-Soviet friendship Treaty of Peace, Friendship and Cooperation, says the treaty may not have come about if Indira Gandhi and Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev had publicly announced their intent and then proceeded to negotiate it as Singh and Bush are doing now.

 Last Julys joint statement by the Prime Minister and the US President required India, among other things, to separate its civilian and military nuclear facilities and programmes, file a declaration regarding its civilian facilities with the IAEA, voluntarily place its civilian nuclear facilities under IAEA safeguards and sign an additional protocol with the IAEA with respect to civilian nuclear facilities. None of these has happened.

 On Washingtons part, Bush said India should acquire the same benefits and advantages as other states with advanced nuclear technology, that he would promote full civil nuclear energy cooperation with India and seek agreement from the US Congress to adjust American laws and policies and work with Americas friends and allies to adjust international regimes to enable full civil nuclear energy cooperation and trade with India. 

 None of these has happened either, making the agreement a mirage so far which is somewhat disproportionately exercising both its critics and supporters in India.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 CAS fee and ad curbs

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 2: The government notification announcing the implementation of the conditional access system in parts of Calcutta, Delhi and Mumbai by the year-end will tighten the screws further on broadcasters. In its ruling on July 20, Delhi High Court had ordered the government to enforce the system by January 1, 2007.

 According to the government announcement, if broadcasters announce a tariff that is too high for pay channels seen by those who subscribe to CAS, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) can step in. A cap has also been placed on the number of commercials that can be shown on television.

 Channels can show advertisements for only 12 minutes per hour during any programme 10 minutes can be allotted for commercials and up to two minutes for advertisements promoting their own programmes.

 The notification has amended rules under the Cable Television Networks Act. 

 The CAS notification was issued on July 31, in compliance with the ruling by Delhi High Court on the implementation of the system. Subscribers will get their channels through a set-top box and will subscribe only to channels or bouquets of channels they wish to see during the month.

 Differences regarding channel prices was partly responsible for the delay in the implementation of CAS. 

 The information and broadcasting ministry had earlier sought more time from Delhi High Court but it has now indicated through the notification that if there is no consensus, Trai will have the final say.

 The ministry has given a clear signal that it is keen on adhering to the CAS roll-out deadline set in the recent high court ruling the notification has asked broadcasters to announce their tariffs within 15 days.

 Mulayam tell-all threat to VP, 17 yrs late

 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY

 Lucknow, July 10: Mulayam Singh Yadav today threatened to hit back at V.P. Singh with a more scathing book than the one his one-time mentor has written.

 Days after the former Prime Ministers Manzil se Zyada Safar (Travel Beyond Destination) triggered a storm, the Uttar Pradesh chief minister said his pen would expose many senior politicians, including Singh, and their corrupt politics.

 Under attack from Singhs political combine, the Jan Morcha, Mulayam gave vent to his venom by calling him utterly corrupt in his private life. The inside information that I can write in my book would be explosive. I can tell the world that a leader whose wife got huge compensation from the state government by passing off a patch of babool tree forest as sandalwood forest? is now calling me corrupt.

 He does not have any moral authority to challenge the policies of my government. I dont care what he says. I know what kind of malpractice he had indulged in, he said.

 The controversy had broken in 1989, when a deal was struck between the government and Singh, who had donated land for the poor in Manda. Singhs wife Sita Devi demanded compensation for a forest of sandalwood trees that had to be felled. It was alleged later that it had only some babool trees. But the Mulayam government paid her Rs 58 lakh.

 The Singh camp cant figure out why Mulayam was raking up a 17-year-old dispute. Why did he make this payment if it was controversial? asked Raj Babbar, the convener of the Jan Morcha.

 Mulayams sudden aggression against his rivals are being attributed to the rising temperature in the Samajwadi circle over the spate of controversies engulfing the chief minister. The latest was Saturdays riot in Dadri, which sparked allegations that Mulayam had sold land cheap to industrialists close to him.

 Last month, the chief minister and his family faced charges of acquiring wealth disproportionate to their known sources of income.

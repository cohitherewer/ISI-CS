The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Four-year wait ends with tap water

 - Hospital debut, finally

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Durgapur, Nov. 17: A subdivisional hospital lying ready but useless for the past four and a half years because of lack of water will finally open tomorrow.

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee will visit Bankuras Khatra, 250 km from Calcutta, to rid the subdivision of a dubious distinction of being the only one in Bengal without its own hospital. 

 A year and a half after its construction was completed, The Telegraph reported on December 4, 2003, that Bankuras low water table had made the Khatra Subdivisional Hospital meaningless.

 The water table at Khatra was so low that deep tube-wells were ineffective and the area did not have any piped water supply. 

 Engineers suggested an alternative that piped water be brought from the Kangsabati, 10 km away which included construction of a water treatment plant for nearly Rs 3 crore. 

 We did that. The public health engineering department had a project lined up to supply piped water from Mukutmanipur. The project was meant for the Ranibandh and Khatra blocks. We are getting our water from there, said M.M. Das, the Bankura chief medical officer of health. 

 The chief minister will also open the water supply project on the Kangsabati at Mukutmanipur.

 The news of the hospitals opening has brought joy to thousands who had to rush to Bankura town, 50 km away, for any serious treatment.

 The entire subdivision so long depended on a 20-bed primary health centre, where doctors and infrastructure struggled to cope with the pressure of 9 lakh-odd people.

 The new, 120-bed facility will begin with 10 doctors. We will have doctors for gynaecology, ophthalmology, medicine, surgery and dental departments. Their number will increase soon, a district health official said.

 Jaladhar Bauri, 63, who had tuberculosis, is hopeful that he will no longer have to travel to Bankura Sammilani Medical College for treatment. I dreaded that journey on a bullock cart. Such an arduous journey was very bad for my health our own hospital is opening at last, he said.

 Subir Pal, 58, a leprosy patient from Dendua village, also had to travel to the medical college for monthly check-ups. Relief he said.

 It is true there was a delay in opening the hospital, but we were helpless. Now the hospital is ready to treat patients, said subdivisional officer Sanjay Bansal.

 District officials said 40 per cent of the people of Khatra live below the poverty line. Most suffer from malnutrition and TB, diarrhoea and other enteric diseases are common.

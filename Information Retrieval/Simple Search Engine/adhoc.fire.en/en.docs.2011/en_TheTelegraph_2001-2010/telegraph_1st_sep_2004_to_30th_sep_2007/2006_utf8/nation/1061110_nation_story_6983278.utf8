 US visa faster and cheaper

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 US calling 

 New Delhi, Nov. 9: Travelling to the US will become a little cheaper with Washington deciding to reduce the non- immigrant visa fee by 33 per cent.

 US ambassador to India David Mulford today said the visa issuance fee of $50 (Rs 2,235) has been scrapped, reducing the overall charge by 33 per cent. 

 The reduction is part of a restructuring programme of visa procedures.

 The fee was reduced after the embassy sent a request to the state department.

 The ambassador stressed the need to reduce the visa fee further to minimise the disparity between Indian and American visa fees.

 Mulford said the visa backlog has been cleared. One can now get visa appointment at the embassy or consulates within a week.

 The waiting period used to be up to six months.

 He said the demand for visas has increased and steps have to be taken to keep pace with it.

 More than 80,000 Indian students have joined US universities this year. 

 Over 60,000 Indians apply for tourist visas every year. Embassy officials said there was no limit on the number of student visas issued every year.

 Visa appointment slots were increased recently to clear the backlog. In Chennai alone, 30,000 new slots were added.

 The US consulate in Mumbai will soon become the leading non-immigrant visa process post in the world. 

 At present, Mumbai is the 12th busiest post, with Mexico and Seoul getting the top slots. 

 The consulate alone processed 1.25 lakh non-immigrant visa cases from October 2005 to September 2006.

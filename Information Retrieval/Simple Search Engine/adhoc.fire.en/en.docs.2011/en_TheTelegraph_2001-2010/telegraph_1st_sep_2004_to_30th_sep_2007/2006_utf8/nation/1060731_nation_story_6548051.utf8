 Ringing cell is new explosive 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Jammu, July 30: When police busted a racket that provided militants with pre-paid SIM cards under false names, they thought the rebels rush to get mobiles was aimed at improving their communications network.

 An arrested Lashkar-e-Toiba activist has now allegedly told them the cellphones are meant for a different purpose: they are to be used as bombs to set off carnage in public places.

 The cellphone bombs are easy to carry and plant, and arouse no suspicion, Tipu alias Noor Ilahi has told the police. 

 The blasts are also easy to set off from as far as you want ? just dial the number of the mobile-turned-bomb.

 These mobiles, fitted with explosives such as TNT or RDX, would be kept in the vibration mode. The moment it rings, it would explode.

 Police sources said it was Tipu, a teenager arrested after the June 12 grenade blasts at Jammus general bus stand, who had spilled the beans on the Lashkar moles in the army and state police. His revelations had led to the arrest of three soldiers from the Jammu and Kashmir Light Infantry ? Abdul Haq, Mohammed Shakeel and Mohammed Sharif.

 Tipu has reportedly named two militants, Abu Shaheen and Arbaaz, among those given the job of planting mobile bombs.

 The first target was to be National Conference MLA Javed Rana, Tipu said, but the rebels asked to plant the devise at his residence had refused, saying they didnt want to kill a leader from their own area.

 The police recently discovered that several Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited franchisees were providing militants with illegal mobile connections.

 Since customers in the state can get SIM cards only after a thorough background check, the rebels were being issued the connections in the names of citizens who had no clue about it.

 Last month, the police arrested Sandeep Kumar, a sales executive with a BSNL franchisee at Jammus Bahu Plaza, and his alleged Lashkar link, Javed Ahmed.

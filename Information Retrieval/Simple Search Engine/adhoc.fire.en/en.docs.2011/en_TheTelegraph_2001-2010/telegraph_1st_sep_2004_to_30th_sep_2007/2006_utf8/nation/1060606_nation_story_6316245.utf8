 Mumbai/New Delhi, June 5: Sharad Pawar today went along with the BJP-Shiv Sena in backing friend and industrialist Rahul Bajajs nomination for the Rajya Sabha, leaving coalition partner Congress feeling badly let down.

 As Bajaj filed his papers as an Independent, a defiant Congress fielded its own candidate, state-level functionary Avinash Pandey, even with the numbers stacked against it.

 To win, a candidate needs 144 votes. The BJP, Shiv Sena and Pawars Nationalist Congress Party together command 182 while the Congress has 73.

 Congress national general secretary Margaret Alva accused Pawar of going back on his word and even chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh indicated that a tacit agreement had been breached.

 In the Rajya Sabha elections last time, the seat had gone to NCP as their numbers were more and we had supported them, Deshmukh said. 

 This time, our numbers are more, so it is natural the seat should come (to us). If they decide to renegade, what is to be done?

 Sources in both parties, however, insisted there was no danger to the coalition government in the state or the alliance at the Centre, where Pawar is a minister. Congress spokesman Abhishek Singhvi declined to term Pawars decision a betrayal.

 Earlier, efforts by the Congress for a last-minute pact between Pawar, who is in London, and Sonia Gandhi had failed. 

 With Pawar not likely to return before June 10, three days after the withdrawal deadline, a solution seemed unlikely though Congress sources said talks would be held with Union minister and NCP leader Praful Patel tomorrow.

 NCP sources, however, said it would be impossible to persuade a man of Bajajs stature to pull out now. Its easier for the Congress to withdraw a lightweight like Pandey.

 Bajaj steered clear of controversy. I am being supported by the BJP, NCP and Shiv Sena. I also met Soniaji. But the Congress obviously has to take care of its own interests, he said.

 I have no hard feelings. My family has had a long association with the Congress party.

 The NCP has been sore at its partner ever since one of its candidates was defeated in the legislative council election after the Congress decided to back his rival, an Independent candidate.

 Congress sources said the partys intention to contest the June 15 election was to prove that the NCPs secular credentials were a sham and Pawar was moving closer towards the saffron camp.

 But a state Congress leader said: Pawar can come together with the BJP and Shiv Sena to support Bajaj because he is his old friend, but this does not reflect any growing closeness between them as the ideological polarisations are too sharp.

 Kerala pesticide claim

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Thiruvananthapuram, Aug. 24: The Kerala government today filed a report in the high court saying tests have revealed harmful levels of pesticide in Coke and Pepsi.

 Tests conducted on samples of the two soft drinks collected from Thiruvananthapuram showed toxic levels of the pesticide chlorpyrifos. Chief government analyst Najma Begum, who filed the report, said the results of the tests had come two days back.

 Justice S. Siri Jagan, who heard petitions filed by the two cola companies against the governments ban on the two drinks, has referred the case to a division bench headed by Chief Justice V.K. Bali.

 The companies had contended in the court that the state government had not independently verified the contents of the drinks and had not heard them out.

 Buddha sticks to stand

 Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has made it clear to cabinet colleagues that his government would not initiate any action on colas despite pressure from the CPI. The Centre will have to decide, the chief minister said.

 After Chinese red wine, a Tibetan hiccup

 - Bhai-bhai and big brother

 SUJAN DUTTA 

 Hu, Sonia: Tough 

 call? 

 Heap of Stones, India-China Line of Actual Control, Oct. 31: An Indian brigadier and his Chinese counterpart locked arms and sipped from goblets of Yunnan red wine in this frontier area yesterday amid hopes that the warmth will wash down from the icy Tibetan tableland to Delhi and Beijing.

 India is hoping that the warmth that cuts the chill among old soldiers will radiate also from the visit by Hu Jintao the first by a Chinese head of state in a decade scheduled from November 20.

 But the highs are likely to be punctuated in the interim by the visit of Sonia Gandhi to Tawang, the garrison town in Arunachal Pradeshs Kameng district, 37 km downhill from here. 

 The Congress chief is slated to visit Tawangs famous monastery on November 5. The monastery is patronised by the Indian Army and is a symbol of Indias enduring support for the Dalai Lama and his Tibetan cause. A predecessor of the Dalai Lama founded the shrine that follows Tibetan Mahayana Buddhism.

 Brigadier Sanjay Kulkarni, who led the Indian delegation at the border personnel meeting, heads the garrison at Tawang. His troops face the Chinese frontier guard across Bumla where the McMahon Line-Line of Actual Control-International Boundary (disputed borders have many descriptions) is marked by a heap of stones and is named as such. 

 On the Chinese side of the LAC, under a nylon Peoples Liberation Army tent, Senior Colonel Li Ming of the PLA Border Defence Regiment forced the Yunnan Red Wine down the brigadier, who was forced to break a fast. From another tent, the smell of Chinese dishes such as chicken claw with chilli salad and deep fried chicken claws wafted across the flat plane at 15,500 feet above sea level.

 Forty-four years ago in 1962, Chinese forces broke into India through Bumla, inflicting a humiliating defeat on the Indian military and rattling Jawaharlal Nehrus government. More than 2,400 soldiers of the Indian Army were killed.

 At the Heap of Stones where the officers later threw a pebble each to denote a wish for lasting friendship in sub-zero temperatures, there was in the event an advertisement of bonhomie.

 Border personnel meetings are held at Bumla four times every year, twice on the Indian side and twice on the Chinese. This was on Chinese territory but yesterdays event has been invested with more importance than on previous occasions because it backgrounds Hus visit.

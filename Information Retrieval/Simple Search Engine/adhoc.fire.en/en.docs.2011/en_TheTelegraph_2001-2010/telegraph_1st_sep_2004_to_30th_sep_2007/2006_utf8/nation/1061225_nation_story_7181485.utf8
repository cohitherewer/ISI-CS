 Wake-up call in girl child deaths

 - Parents told to report all such incidents

 GAJINDER SINGH

 Neglected?

 Chandigarh, Dec. 24: Not one of them lived beyond two. And all were girls.

 The mysterious deaths of several girl children in the last two months in Nawanshar, once among the lowest in terms of sex ratio, has prompted the districts deputy commissioner to issue a directive ordering people to report such cases before performing the last rites.

 It is strange that while no male child has died over the last two months, about 10 girls have breathed their last. It could be due to negligence, Krishan Kumar said yesterday.

 The order has been issued to ensure that people understand their responsibility and help us to provide correction. We have been monitoring pregnant women from the conception to the delivery stage. But we have to extend the monitoring for a much longer period now.

 The deaths have come as a fresh challenge for the deputy commissioner, whose efforts helped reverse to a great extent the districts dismal male-female ratio in the 0-6 age group in the last census. From 754, the girl child count rose to nearly 935 after Kumar and several non-government organisations launched a movement against female foeticide.

 Of the 16 districts in the country that have the worst imbalance in the sex ratio, 10 are in Punjab. The nation- al figure is 927 to 1,000. In Punjab, it is 793.

 The deputy commissioner ruled out infanticide to be the reason behind the recent deaths.

 We maintain a computerised record of all pregnant women in the district of six lakh people. I believe it is the negligence of girls that stems from hundreds of years of social stigma accompanying the birth of a girl that has led to parents neglecting them by not providing them nutritious food, he said.

 The order will make it mandatory for parents to report the deaths of their children now. We would like to know the cause of the deaths so that we can provide help. The health department, too, should understand that its responsibility does not end with the delivery.

 According to the states finance and health minister, Surinder Singla, it is women who are more responsible for female foeticide.

 They rejoice at the birth of a male child and are dis- appointed at the birth of a baby girl. It is time for introspection by them, he had told a gathering.

 A large number of girls in Punjab continue to be either killed before birth, or are considered a curse by their parents whose traditional preference for sons remains unshakeable.

 Recently, the case of a Patiala doctor who dumped foetuses in two wells behind his clinic after abortions had created a furore in the state.

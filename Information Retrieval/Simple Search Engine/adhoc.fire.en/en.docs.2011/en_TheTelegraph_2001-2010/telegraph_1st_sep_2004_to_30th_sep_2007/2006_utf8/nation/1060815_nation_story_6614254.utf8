 Kalam mum on bill

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 14: The Congress-led government is uneasy about President A.P.J. Abdul Kalams silence on the office-of-profit bill.

 The Prevention of Disqualification) Amendment bill has been lying with the President for 12 days and the monsoon session will end on August 25.

 If the bill remains unsigned till then, government sources say a serious political and constitutional crisis will develop. 

 We tried to probe his mind on this bill through the highest channels but failed, they said.

 Article 111 of the Constitution says while the President can return a bill to Parliament once for reconsideration, he has to sign it if it is sent back with or without incorporating his suggestions. But there is no time frame.

 The governments biggest fear is while the bill remains unsigned, the Election Commission might start acting on the 40-odd petitions against MPs holding offices of profit. The panel has held its horses because of the uncertainty over the fate of the bill after Kalam sent it back. 

 The EC is not bound to note that the President has not given his consent. It can start acting on the petitions independently, the sources said.

 Among those whose fortunes could be made or marred by the commission are Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee and CPM MPs J. Hannan Mollah and Mohammed Selim. 

 Samajwadi Party MP Amar Singh, PMK member and Union health minister Anbumani Ramadoss and Congress members and central ministers T. Subbirami Reddy and Jairam Ramesh are also in the line of the fire.

 The commission is considering the reply furnished by the Bengal government on the petitions against Chatterjee, Mollah, Selim and six other CPM MPs. 

 On Reddy, it has sought more information from the Andhra Pradesh government because he chairs the Tirupati-Tirumala Devasthanam Trust.

 PM in hurry for Pak talks

 MONOBINA GUPTA 

 Singh, Musharraf: 

 Time running out

 New Delhi, Sept. 7: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is ready to walk the extra mile to resume talks with Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf and explore mutually beneficial solutions to all disputes.

 At a meeting with Left leaders Prakash Karat and A.B. Bardhan this evening, Singh said time was running out and it was best to hold negotiations with Musharraf, who had both civil and military powers vested in him.

 Singh told the leaders that the Lefts insistence on resuming talks had helped him neutralise hawks in his party, the Congress, and those within the security establishment. 

 Karat and Bardhan found that the Prime Minister was not only willing to resume talks but also displayed a flexible approach to border disputes land and maritime and the Kashmir conflict. 

 They felt he had imaginative solutions in mind, including plans to give Kashmir greater autonomy. They were also told about a proposal for joint sharing of maritime resources along disputed borders.

 The Prime Minister is expected to hold talks with the Pakistan President in Havana on the sidelines of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) summit, slated for September 15 and 16.

 Karat and Bardhan emphasised the need to resume the dialogue that came to a halt after the July 11 serial train blasts in Mumbai. 

 A section of the Congress feels the Centre should take a tough stance against Musharraf who, they believe, is not doing enough to end cross-border terrorism. 

 It is easier for Singh to show flexibility in a dialogue with Musharraf as long as there is pressure from the Left parties. This will give the Prime Minister not known for taking a tough stand within his party a bulwark against his critics. 

 Karat and Bardhan told the Prime Minister there was a demand in Pakistan to separate the posts of the general and President. 

 India will have to contend with the military authority separately if Musharraf, under increased pressure from fundamentalists after the recent violence in Baluchistan over the killing of Baluch leader Nawab Akbar Khan Bugti, were to step down as President, they said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Champions League on Ten Sports

 SUBHAJIT BANERJEE

 Calcutta, July 11: The biggest soccer tournament ? after the World Cup, of course ? has just changed channels. Ten Sports has picked up the telecast rights to UEFA Champions League, the annual treat of the best club football in Europe. 

 The Dubai-based broadcaster will beam the next three seasons of the tournament, starting this September, including around 1,000 hours of soccer action.

 Champions League, which was being shown by ESPN STAR Sports in India so long, reportedly has a global viewership of one billion. The qualifying round games for the 2006-07 edition kick off tonight.

 This is a great step forward for us and further improves an amazing year for Ten Sports. We have now added the best club football in the world to our sporting lineup, said Chris McDonald, the CEO of Ten Sports.

 The channel, however, refused to comment on the amount it paid for the rights.

 Lars-Christer Olsson, the CEO of UEFA, said: We are delighted to welcome Ten Sports as a new broadcast partner. This agreement will undoubtedly benefit football fans throughout the entire Indian subcontinent.

 Ten Sports is planning a host of activities as the tournament progresses September onwards, including on-air contests, promotions and screenings. 

 We would be targeting traditional football markets like Calcutta, Cochin, Mumbai and Hyderabad, as well as the non-traditional ones like Delhi and the rest of north India, Rakesh Rao, director of marketing amp; communication, told The Telegraph.

 Programming specials would include pre-match studio shows and highlights packages. The production would be done out of Dubai and the channel is planning to rope in some of the best sporting personalities.

 With the renewed interest in world soccer stars post- World Cup, the channel is expecting a rise in television ratings. We expect the average TRPs of 1-1.5 to grow significantly as we reach the tournament to 60 million homes across India, Rao added.

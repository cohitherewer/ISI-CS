 Jayalalithaa: Pressure tactic

 Chennai, June 11: Tamil Nadu today became the first non-Congress state to offer a fuel price relief, buckling to Opposition pressure hours after making light of ally Congresss gentle persuasion.

 Chief minister M. Karunanidhi announced his government would forgo sales tax on the amount by which the price of diesel has been raised. But unlike the Congress-ruled states, there would be no tax relief on petrol.

 Diesel, whose price had risen by Rs 2.23 a litre in the state, will now be costlier only by Rs 1.78 a litre following the 45-paise waiver.

 The move, which amounts to an about-turn from what Karunanidhi had told the Centre hours earlier, came after a single, hard-hitting statement from his rival Jayalalithaa.

 At a meeting here last evening, Karunanidhi had disappointed petroleum minister Murli Deora, who has been trying to persuade the states to cut sales tax on petrol and diesel. If he gave a tax relief, the chief minister explained, he would be forced to raise bus fares and the public would resent that equally.

 Deora understood our difficulties, the chief minister had told reporters last night.

 But the situation changed dramatically this morning. In a public statement, Jayalalithaa reminded Karunanidhi that after a fuel price hike when she was chief minister, the DMK chief ? then in the Opposition ? had advised her to reduce the sales tax.

 What prevents the DMK leader, now that he is in power, to adopt his own recipe? the ADMK chief asked.

 She also reminded Karunanidhi of his poll promise of slashing bus fares.

 If Karunanidhi honestly meant what he had said, he should now act upon his words, Jayalalithaa said. That is what the people expect.

 As the chief minister announced his latest decision in the afternoon, he said the move would cost his government Rs 180 crore a year. And since he wouldnt raise the fares of public buses, the sector transport corporations (STCs) would suffer an additional yearly loss of Rs 100 crore.

 Karunanidhi said such sops could only provide an urgent, temporary relief to the people.

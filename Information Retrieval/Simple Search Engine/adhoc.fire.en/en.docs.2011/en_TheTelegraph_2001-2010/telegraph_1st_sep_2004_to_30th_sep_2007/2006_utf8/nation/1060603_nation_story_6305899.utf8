 Dragged to limelight by disasters

 June 2: She would have 

 remained blended into the background through her life, if 

 it had not been for the disasters that struck her.

 All that one remembers are the TV cameras zooming in on the crumpled, tear-strained face of a small woman, who can barely stand as her husbands body is taken away in a grand procession. 

 Very little is known about Rekha Mahajan, except that she was the wife of the late BJP leader Pramod Mahajan, who was shot by his younger brother Praveen. Today, she is in the news again because her son is struggling for his life at a hospital after probable drug abuse. 

 Her private life has become a public spectacle that she cannot control, even as it is scary to wonder what she is going through.

 Her husbands death was unexpected, violent. It must have caused her extreme grief. And now, barely a month later, her son is seriously ill, says Dr Bharat Shah, a psychiatrist with Lilavati Hospital, Mumbai. 

 She must be going through her trauma again on visiting her son. The hospital scenes would bring back the memory of her husbands death. There is too much focus on her family, too, he adds. 

 It is a double disaster. She must be in a state of shock, said Mumbai-based psychiatrist Dr Harish Shetty. She must be shattered. She should be left alone and only close members of the family should be near her. She needs emotional, mental, spiritual help, he added. 

 But life for Rekha began on a far less dramatic note. She was born Rekha Hamine and lived in Ambejogai in Marathwada, about 500 km east of Mumbai, in a low-income family. Joining Yogeshwari Mahavidyalaya seems to be the first turning point in her life.

 She met classmate Pramod there. They used to act together in college plays. It appears that Pramod who had a stage fixation; he chose a young woman named Sarangi as Praveens bride when he saw her dancing at her college also fell in love with his future wife when she was performing in a play. She was also reported to be the better actor.

 Pramod and Rekha married in 1972. They had two children, Rahul and Poonam, both trained pilots. That is where the curtain came down on Rekhas story.

 As Pramod rose and fell and rose again from the BJPs flamboyant funds collector, to a visionary techie to scandals linking him with women and moneybags, to Prime Minister-in-waiting Rekha was backstage. 

 Except for file shots that show her, in jewellery and silk sarees, attending a wedding, an inauguration, a naming ceremony, smiling, and always by her husbands side. A woman who wouldnt be noticed if it wasnt for the famous man beside her.

 Perhaps, she had grown comfortable there; she had her own life as Mahajans wife that did not encroach on what he did outside.

 But she must have tempted the fates; they decided to line up tragedies for her and drag her through a womans worst nightmares.

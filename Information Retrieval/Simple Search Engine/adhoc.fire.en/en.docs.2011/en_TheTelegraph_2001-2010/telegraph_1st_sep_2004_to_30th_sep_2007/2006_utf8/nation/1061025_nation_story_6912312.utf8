 CPM sends IT union teaser to Citu

 - Why only here: party plays for level playing field

 Calcutta, Oct. 24: The Bengal CPM today sought to turn the tables on Citu by suggesting that the labour arms fledgling infotech union should be taken to other states also to ensure a level playing field and prevent the flight of capital from here.

 Bengal should not suffer. If the association is limited to the state, it can trigger a flight of capital. So, the employees body should gain a foothold in IT and ITES sectors in other states as well to give Bengal a level-playing ground, said Benoy Konar, a senior member of the CPM state secretariat and a central committee member.

 The West Bengal IT Services Association will be formally launched at a rally in Salt Lakes Sector V on November 17.

 However, state Citu president and Konars fellow member in the CPM secretariat, Shyamal Chakraborty, said the association would be limited to Bengal. The reason: the partys labour arm does not have the muscle to establish its presence in Bangalore, Gurgaon or Hyderabad. 

 I have no idea whether Citu has made an effort to organise IT workers at the central level or at other centres. Citu hardly has a presence there (at the other centres). Our effort is limited to Bengal now, said Chakraborty.

 He denied that the move would scare away investors. Nobody would run away from Bengal. Mitsubishi Corporation opened its second unit in Haldia even after we formed a union there. The same with the sponge iron units in the state. One should not confuse the formation of a union with strike in the industry. It does not mean we are going to call a strike.

 Some IT companies, he alleged, are trying to create a fear psychosis to conceal their unlawful activities. 

 The state governments stand, IT minister Debesh Das said, is neutral. Employees have a right to form a union but nobody should coerce them.

 Both Chakraborty and Das agreed, though, that the hire-and-fire policy an issue that apparently prompted Citu to take up the cause of IT workers is not rampant in Bengal. 

 Its the other way round. Job mobility in the industry allows IT-ITES employees to leave for better deals. I have not received any complaints of hire and fire in the states IT firms, Das said.

 It is not a big worry for us now, said Chakraborty. But he accused a section of the companies of refusing to obtain the labour departments clearance, which allows them to work 24x7 an exemption given to the industry under the Shops and Establishment Act. 

 No employee should be compelled to work more than 48 hours a week, Chakraborty said.

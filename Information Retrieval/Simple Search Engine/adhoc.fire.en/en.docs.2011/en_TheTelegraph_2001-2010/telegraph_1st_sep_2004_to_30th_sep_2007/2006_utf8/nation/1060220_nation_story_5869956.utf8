 Scepticism amp; conspiracy theory at play

 Pune, Feb. 19 (PTI): The chairperson of the National Egg Co-ordination Committee today disputed the prevalence of bird flu in Maharashtra and urged the Prime Minister to stop the culling of birds till fresh samples indicated presence of the deadly H5N1 strain.

 The reason for the high mortality among chickens in Navapur is the Ranikhet disease and not bird flu. The tests done on the samples of birds at the Maharashtra governments disease investigation section in Pune point the cause of their death as Ranikhet disease, said Anuradha Desai, who is also the chairperson of Venkateshwara Hatcheries, the countrys largest poultry company.

 This is what even eminent scientist Dr J.M. Kataria, the head of the department of avian disease at the Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Bareily, believes, Desai said.

 She denied reports about deaths of birds at Venkateshwara Hatcheries. We are not into commercial production of eggs. We are into breeding and selling of day-old chicks and also manufacturing of vaccines. As we dont have any poultry farms, where is the question of birds dying due to bird flu in Venkateshwara Hatcheries? she asked. 

 Desai said even the samples tested at Punes Poultry Diagnostic and Research Centre have not confirmed the presence of the H5N1 strain. 

 Once the productivity life of the birds is over, they need to be culled after 72 weeks. But in Navapur, the farmers extended the period from 72 weeks to 100 weeks, which only had made the birds more vulnerable to diseases and it was Ranikhet this time, she repeated. 

 Probe appeal

 A former director of the National Institute of Virology in Pune has said there is need for detailed investigations into how the virus arrived in a remote place like Nandurbar, including the possibility of deliberate introduction. 

 I am worried and surprised about the whole thing, said Kalyan Banerjee, who is also a member of the government committee that advises on bio-terrorism.

 Two months ago, India had purchased 2 million doses of a bird flu vaccine. It also placed orders for the drug Tamiflu from an MNC while three Indian companies have announced they will soon have a generic version of Tamiflu. And suddenly more than 30,000 poultry die of bird flu in a remote place, Banerjee wondered. 

 He was mystified as the virus showed up in a place that is not near an international border or on the path of migratory birds. Asked if the virus could have been introduced deliberately, he said all aspects must be investigated.

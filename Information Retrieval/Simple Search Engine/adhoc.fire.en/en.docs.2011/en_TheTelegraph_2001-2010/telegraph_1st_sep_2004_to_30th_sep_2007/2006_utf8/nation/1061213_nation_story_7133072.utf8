 Sati shield for women

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 12: A proposed amendment to the anti-Sati law would treat a woman trying to commit the act as a victim, not an offender, and hold the local community responsible for the crime.

 Women and child development minister Renuka Chowdhury told the Lok Sabha today that an amendment to the Commission of Sati (Prevention) Act, 1987, was under the consideration.

 She said the proposal was to treat the woman committing Sati as a victim, make panchayat responsible for the act and increase punishment. 

 As the act stands now, a woman who tries to burn herself on the funeral pyre of her husband faces imprisonment of up to one year, but the special court trying the case has to take into consideration the circumstances that led her to take the step and her mental state at that time.

 Those who abet Sati face life imprisonment or death under the act now. But there is no concept yet of holding the entire local community responsible. Glorification of Sati, however, is punishable.

 India alters project for Pak truce

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 18: India has decided to change the design of the controversial Kishenganga hydro-power project in Jammu and Kashmir to end a long-standing dispute with Pakistan.

 The Union cabinet today agreed to scrap the plan to build a water reservoir with a capacity of 220 million cubic metres on the Kishenganga to run a 332-MW hydro-electric station, which Pakistan had fiercely resisted as a violation of the Indus treaty. Kishenganga is a tributary of the Indus.

 Instead of the reservoir, India will now build a run-of-the-river hydropower project. Science and technology minister Kapil Sibal said even after the alteration, the project capacity will remain 332 MW.

 Speaking after the cabinet meeting, Sibal said the new proposal has been submitted to Pakistan and the response is awaited.

 Pakistan had objected to the project on the grounds that India cannot store water under the Indus treaty signed in 1960. The World Bank-brokered treaty allows construction of the run-of-the-river scheme, the minister said.

 The Kishenganga project has been pending since 1994. 

 Under the Indus treaty, India holds the rights to the waters of the Ravi, Sutlej and Beas while Pakistan gets to use the waters of the Indus, Chenab and Jhelum. All the rivers flow from the country into Pakistan.

 After going through the issues raised by Pakistan, India decided that reconfiguration could be the way out of the dispute. Sibal said Pakistans concern about protecting its irrigation plans has been addressed.

 The cabinet decision comes at a time when Indian water resources ministry officials are in Pakistan to resolve differences over the construction of the Wular Barrage, also known as the Tulbul Navigation project. 

 Import nod

 Pakistan today allowed the import of corrugated sheets from India till September through the land route, for exclusive use in reconstruction of its earthquake-affected areas. Recommendations from the earthquake reconstruction and rehabilitation authority will be required for the import.

 Tribals wrath scalds steel unit

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, March 24: More than a hundred tribals today vandalised a steel plant owned by the Calcutta-based Adhunik Group in Orissa.

 A 100-strong mob led by former MLA George Tirkey ransacked three sponge iron plants in protest against pollution, taking their attack next to Adhunik Metaliks in Sundargarh district.

 The tribals arrived at the 250,000-tonne capacity plant, shouting slogans for jobs. Some of them later entered the plant, scaling a wall. Another group barged in from the opposite side.

 Armed with bows, arrows, axes and sticks, they assaulted the plants 400-odd employees.

 Within minutes, the rampaging mob ran through the plant and vandalised the coal washery, the mini blast furnace and the direct-reduction-of-iron unit, bringing production to a halt. They also destroyed vehicles parked near the plant at Chadri Hariharapur. 

 Police wielded the baton when some of the protesters tried to force their way in through the main gate, but failed to establish order. Later, the police fired seven to eight rounds in the air. 

 The attack was pre-planned, said Sundargarh collector Sujata Pandian.

 Sundargarh superintendent of police S. Shyni said: We showed tremendous control.

 In January, hundreds of armed tribals had blocked the lone railway entry point to the city, demanding that the 1.7-million-tonne Rourkela Steel Plant return its surplus land to the original owners. 

 Among the executives of the Adhunik plant injured were vice-president Narendra Prasad, chief of security Hansraj Singh, manager E.G. Pillai, assistant general manager P. Mishra and Suman Mishra of the reception department. Executive director Arun Katorka was also beaten up.

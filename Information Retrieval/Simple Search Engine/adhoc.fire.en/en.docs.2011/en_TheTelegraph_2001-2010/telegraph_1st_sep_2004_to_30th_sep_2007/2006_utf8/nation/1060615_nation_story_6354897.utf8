 Cheque bounce row

 Bangalore, June 14: The promoter of the Bangalore-Mysore expressway, Nandi Infrastructure Corridor Enterprises, claimed today that a cheque of Rs 5 lakh handed over by the Karnataka government had bounced, reports our special correspondent.

 The government had handed over the cheque last week on a Supreme Court order to pay up legal costs incurred by the company.

 The companys managing director Ashok Kheny said the treasury cheque had been returned to his bank on the ground that there were insufficient funds.

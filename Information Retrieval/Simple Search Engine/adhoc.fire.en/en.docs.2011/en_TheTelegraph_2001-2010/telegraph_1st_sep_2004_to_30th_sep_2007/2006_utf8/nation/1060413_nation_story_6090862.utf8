 Second stint for Milkman

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Ahmedabad, April 12: Three weeks after Verghese Kurien made what many saw as a long-overdue exit from the Gujarat milk cooperative scene, he is back to play a second innings.

 The 84-year-old has been appointed honorary adviser to the countrys largest dairy, the Mehsana Dairy, in a move seemingly as full of intrigue as his dramatic resignation from the Gujarat Co-operative Milk Marketing Federation on March 20.

 Kuriens opponents in the federation, who had joined forces to remove him before he pre-empted them by stepping down, are upset.

 In his new role, Kurien, who came to be known as the Milkman of India, may not wield the kind of powers he had as chairman of the Rs 3,500-crore federation, but he will through his decisions certainly exercise some influence on its board. 

 His appointment, announced today, seemed to deepen divisions in the federation and embitter the succession battle opened up by his exit.

 The race for the chairmans post has left the federation split into two camps ? one headed by Mehsana Dairy chairman Vipul Chaudhary and another by Amul chairman Ramsinh Parmar. 

 Both had backed the move to oust Kurien through a no-confidence motion last month.

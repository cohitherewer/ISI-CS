 Cola ad ban on govt plate

 OUR BUREAU AND AGENCIES 

 New Delhi, Aug. 10: The government is considering a ban on cola advertisments, Parliament was told today.

 Talks to test the legal ground for a ban were being held with the information and broadcasting ministry, health minister Anbumani Ramadoss said in the Rajya Sabha, but made it clear there was no decision yet.

 Ramadoss said states were authorised to carry out pesticide checks and were free to take decisions based on those findings. They could also clamp a ban if there was proof the drinks harmed health.

 He said he would find out whether there were reports of pesticide contents in soft drinks sold in Europe. We are trying to bring out comprehensive standards for testing. I am very concerned, the minister said, adding the government was trying to set norms for water and sugar contents in carbonated drinks.

 The onus to supply pesticide-free drinks was on companies, which will have to face the consequences if they fail to measure up to the responsibility, Ramadoss said. The panel set up to verify Centre for Science and Environments (CSE) findings on pesticide residues is likely to submit its report within two weeks.

 Even as the minister asked soft-drink makers to be more accountable, the cacophony got shriller with business chambers wading into the muddle.

 We are urging both the central and state governments to go through a due diligence process, check if a law has been violated and then come out with a notification banning or not banning a product. If this does not happen, it will affect investments, both domestic and overseas, said Ficci secretary-general Amit Mitra. 

 Government actions have to be driven by the rule of law and overall public interest. We are concerned the arbitrary decision to ban manufacture and sale of carbonated beverages has been taken without going through the due process of law, CII president R. Seshasayee said.

 Kerala has banned the manufacture and distribution of Coca-Cola and Pepsis drinks.

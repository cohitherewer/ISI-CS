The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 3 more IITs coming up

 MONOBINA GUPTA

 New Delhi, Nov. 15: The Centre has decided to set up three new Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) to reach more students.

 The decision comes close on the heels of the controversy over a 27 per cent quota for other backward classes students in higher education that has led to a fear among general category students that they will be left out in the cold.

 The location of the new IITs is yet to be decided.

 At present, there are seven IITs Kharagpur, Madras, Delhi, Guwahati, Kanpur, Roorkee and Powai which together have 3,980 seats. But the number of aspirants runs into lakhs. In 2006, for instance, over three lakh students took the entrance test.

 IIT directors who appeared before the oversight committee, headed by Veerappa Moily, set up to monitor implementation of the quota, had repeatedly sought more time to introduce the new reservation structure. It is to come into effect from the next academic year.

 The decision to set up new IITs may offset some of the criticism the UPA government, particularly the HRD ministry, is facing. Although the battle against quotas is mainly being fought by medicos, IIT and Indian Institute of Management (IIM) students have also opposed reservation.

 The new IITs will together add another 3,000 seats. The HRD ministry has been stressing on the need to increase seats in view of the galloping demand. Over the last few years, the IITs have increased their student intake but the ministry maintains that more needs to be done to meet the demand for technical manpower. 

 The HRD ministry has written to the Planning Commission for approval of the new IITs, which will be funded by the government for six years. Each will annually get Rs 650 crore. Over a period of time they are expected to become self-sufficient through collaborations with industry and international research institutes.

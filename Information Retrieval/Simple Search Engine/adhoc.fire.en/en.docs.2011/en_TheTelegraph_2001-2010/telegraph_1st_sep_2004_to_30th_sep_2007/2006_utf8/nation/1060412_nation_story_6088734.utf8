 Heartlands dead man alive on reel

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Satish Kaushik

 Lucknow, April 11: Sometime soon, Bollywood should be having its own version of Dead Man Walking.

 No, Satish Kaushiks yet untitled film will not centre around a Sean Penn on death row, but on one of the scores of dead men literally walking in eastern Uttar Pradesh.

 The film has been inspired by one much-alive Lal Bihari of Azamgarh who was recorded as dead in the states land records. It took the man 18 long years and countless gimmicks to get himself resurrected.

 The man, who had taken to calling himself Lal Bihari Mritak (Lal Bihari Dead), was the victim of a racket in which government officials would collude with relatives of land-owning people, declare them dead and grab their property and insurance policies.

 It is a very strange struggle of a man who was dead according to government records and it took over 18 years to prove he was alive, Kaushik, known for Salman Khan-starrer Tere Naam, said about his new film.

 The man went in and out of various courts for years and fought with the system to make him alive. He had to scream from the rooftops that he was alive.

 The incredible story of Lal Bihari hit the headlines last year when he moved Allahabad High Court for Rs 25 crore in damages from the state government for recording him as dead for more than 14 years.

 Lal Bihari was recorded as dead in 1976 and his neighbour named the owner of his plot. He was working as a daily wage earner in Azamgarh ? he lives in Amilo village ? when he was cheated of his life and land.

 For 18 years after that, Lal Bihari ran from pillar to post to prove he was alive. He filed several cases but to no avail. Finally, he abducted a neighbour to get his name into the criminal records, which he could use to prove he wasnt dead.

 He was ultimately recorded as alive in government records in July 1994 and was returned his land.

 I want the compensation because the governments criminal lapse caused me untold financial loss. For 18 years, a piece of land that I owned was cultivated by others. This drove me to the streets, Lal Bihari, who now runs an association to help others like him, said.

 Besides, by declaring me dead, the government deprived me of my rights as a human being. I could have got a job.

 If all goes to plan, the shoot for Kaushiks film should get rolling soon. The script is almost final and work will begin soon, he had said on a recent visit.

 Lal Biharis was not an isolated case. Several such cases were reported from Azamgarh district in 1999-2000 and from Kanpur district also.

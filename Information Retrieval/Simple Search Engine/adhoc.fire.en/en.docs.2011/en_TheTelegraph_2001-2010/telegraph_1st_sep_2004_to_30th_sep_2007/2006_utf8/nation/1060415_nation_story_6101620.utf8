 Women cry bias at work

 - Gender discrimination common, finds CII survey

 SOHINI MOOKHERJEE

 Calcutta, April 14: Almost every time Shalini gets late for or slips up at work, her sniggering colleagues in the advertising agency throw meaningful glances ? its only to be expected, you see, shes a woman with a family.

 Rohini, a geologist, had this uneasy feeling during the interview with a multinational that her gender was an issue. She didnt get the job.

 More than 25 per cent of women in the workplace have faced some sort of gender discrimination, shows a survey done by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII). 

 Some 56 per cent of the companies surveyed do not have a sexual harassment policy, the study on levels of women empowerment in the workplace reveals.

 A survey like this, which encompasses respondents across industry segments, has been attempted for the first time by CII, said Anu Aga, director of Thermax Ltd and chairperson of the CII women empowerment cell.

 The survey covered 59 women managers and women at other levels in 149 companies.

 It shows that the proportion of women in the workforce across industry segments is only six per cent. Its not very much different for even organisations like the CII.

 I have been lucky to be part of an organisation which is gender neutral. But corporate India is slowly adapting itself to the needs of the increasing presence of women in the workplace, said Chanda Kochhar, ICICI Bank executive director.

 The survey shows that the female workforce in mid-sized companies (turnover Rs 30 to Rs 100 crore) is 18 per cent but drops sharply to four per cent in the large ones (Rs 100 crore and above).

 Aga put the difference down to the fact that large companies were usually in manufacturing where the rate of women employment was low.

 Companies are still distinctly uncomfortable and implicitly often try to avoid recruiting women in streams like chemical and mechanical engineering and geology. Aga received this feedback from some university professors and women engineers.

 Junior management in the companies surveyed had 16 per cent women, the middle level four per cent and the senior level four per cent. In the leadership position the presence of women is virtually nil.

 The study also busts some myths. It says women leave jobs for the same reason as men ? for better prospects and higher pay. Only a small percentage switch for family reasons.

 The first woman president of a business lobby in Calcutta, Nayantara Pal Choudhury, who heads the Bengal National Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said more women should play an active role in industry associations and run for office. Such platforms would give them greater exposure.

 Companies, however, are simply not equipped to help women at work. Some 84 per cent of the women surveyed felt the maternity leave period was not enough. Day-care centres for children, flexible timings and counselling and career-related help after a break are some of the other needs they highlighted.

 Sunita Ramnathkar, joint managing director, Fem Care Pharma Ltd, explained why it might make commercial sense for companies to create a work environment for women.

 Marketing geared towards women is just about catching on in India but it would also help if companies realised the potential of hiring more women to create, brand and promote womens products because theyre more attuned to the needs of women.

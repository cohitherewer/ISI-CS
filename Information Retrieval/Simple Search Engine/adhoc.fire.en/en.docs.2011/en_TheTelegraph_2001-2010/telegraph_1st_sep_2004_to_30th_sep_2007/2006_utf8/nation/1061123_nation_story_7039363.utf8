 Womens bill

 New 

 Delhi, Nov. 22: The womens reservation bill 

 will be placed in Parliament in the last week of the winter 

 session. Sonia Gandhi, who took it up at a UPA-Left coordination 

 committee meeting this evening, spoke to Lalu Prasad, a 

 bitter opponent of the bill, and he has agreed to support 

 it. 

 The bill will be referred to a standing committee, the equivalent of cold storage, for the second time.

 SC moots curb on Speakers powers

 - Court scanner on disqualification of lawmakers

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 Supreme Court, Parliament 

 New Delhi, Dec. 11: The Supreme Court today gently nudged Parliament to consider curbing the Speakers powers.

 With holders of the office often being accused of bias, the court said, the House may need to consider if Speakers of national and state legislatures should have sole power to expel lawmakers under the anti-defection law.

 Although the bench, headed by Chief Justice Y.K. Sabharwal, floated the idea of handing this power to the Election Commission, it hastened to add that Parliament alone could decide the matter.

 Whether to vest such power in the Speaker or Election Commission or any other institution is not for us to decide. It is only for Parliament to decide, the court said.

 We have noted this aspect so that Parliament, if deemed appropriate, may examine it, bestow its wise consideration. Sabharwal said, appearing to try his best to avoid a legislature-judiciary row.

 The three-judge bench, however, cited how, in the recent past, questions have been raised about impartiality on some issues having political overtones, which are decided by the Speaker. If not checked, it may ultimately affect the high office of the Speaker.

 The courts suggestion came as it upheld the dismissal of six MLAs under the anti-defection law by the Haryana Speaker in 2004. The court said it had limited powers to scrutinise any Speakers action.

 The court mentioned the recommendation by a constitutional review panel many years ago that the power to expel lawmakers be vested in the Election Commission and not the Speaker. Some experts have suggested that the Speaker at least seek the poll panels opinion in such matters and act on it.

 Last week, the apex court had rejected arguments that the actions of the Speaker of a legislature were above judicial scrutiny. Unlike in other countries, the Speaker does not resign from the political party from which he had been elected to the House, a five-member Constitution bench had said in an observation. Therefore, it added, a Speaker cannot be considered absolutely impartial.

 Rivals gun for Rajan minister

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, March 10: The Opposition today called for the head of Siddharam Mhetre, minister of state for home, following media reports that a tapped conversation between two gangsters had pointed to their links with the Congress leader.

 The leader of the Opposition, Shiv Senas Ramdas Kadam, wrote to chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh, demanding Mhetres resignation and a probe. 

 Unless Deshmukh makes Mhetre resign, we will not allow Assembly proceedings (which begin on Monday) to continue, Kadam warned. The BJP backed the call.

 The alleged conversation between underworld don Chhota Rajan and his jailed associate, D.K. Rao, was tapped by police in September last year.

 The transcript purportedly shows Rao telling Rajan he had paid a bribe of paanch peti (peti stands for Rs 1 lakh in gangland parlance) to Mhetre at his official residence to reinstate 12 police officers. The officers had been suspended on the charge of helping the Rajan gang murder a traitor in their ranks, Om Prakash Singh.

 The transcript is one of 44 attached to a chargesheet filed against Rao and six others on February 14 in the murder case. Selectively leaked to the media, it mentions the ministers name as Sitaram Mhetre. The other transcripts allegedly contain references to prominent Mumbai personalities.

 Rao was in Nashik central jail when he is believed to have received an order from Rajan over phone to get Om Prakash, who was in the same jail, killed for betraying the gang. Rao selected 13 of his men for the job, but the problem was that all of them were in Arthur Road jail.

 Police investigations suggest Rao bribed 12 officers and got his team of 13 transferred to Nashik jail.

 Rao, jailed since 1999 in several other cases, was re-arrested in the murder case in 2002 and handed a 10-year sentence.

 From his new cell in Arthur Road jail, Rao continued to run the gangs operations, prompting the police to tap the mobile phone he had smuggled into the prison.

 Between September and December last year, the police recorded over 150 conversations. On December 15, Rao was detained under a stringent law against organised crime.

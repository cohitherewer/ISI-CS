 Prejudiced? Blame it on a brain spot

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, May 21: A small region in the front of the human brain might be part of the machinery of prejudicial thoughts against racial or ethnic groups different from ones own, maps of the brain in action have revealed.

 Scientists at Harvard University and the University of Aberdeen who used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans to delineate the region believe their study could help unravel the brain mechanisms of stereotyping and prejudice.

 Harvard psychologist John Mitchell and his colleagues have shown that different areas of the region called the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) are active when people think about other people whom they perceive as similar to or different from themselves.

 Brain mapping using MRI involves using magnetic fields to track blood flow in the brain while people are thinking about something. The higher the blood flow to a particular area, the greater is the activity in that zone.

 In their experiments, the researchers showed college students pictures of two people ? one described as having liberal views, the other described as having conservative political views.

 The scientists then set up an experiment in which the students brain activity would be scanned while they were thinking about each person.

 The scientists found that the lower part of the mPFC region was active when people had thoughts about a person whom they considered similar to themselves, while the upper part of the mPFC became active when they were thinking about people whom they perceived as unlike themselves.

 The mPFC has long been known to be involved in the higher thinking processes such as emotion, said Shashi Wadwa, professor of neuroanatomy at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in New Delhi. Its not surprising that this region turns out to be involved in prejudice. After all, prejudice is thinking coloured by emotions.

 The scientists said their findings support a theory called simulation, according to which people use knowledge about themselves to infer the mental states of other people. 

 They said prejudice may arise because people assume that the mental states of others do not correspond to their own.

 People may then rely on stereotypes to assume mental states of others dissimilar to themselves.

 The researchers said one way to reduce prejudice would be to breach arbitrary boundaries based on social group membership by focusing on shared similarities between people.

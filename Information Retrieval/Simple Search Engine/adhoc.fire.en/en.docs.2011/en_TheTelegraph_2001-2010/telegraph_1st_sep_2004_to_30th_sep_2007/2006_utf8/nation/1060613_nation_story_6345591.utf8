The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Advani amp; Atal court arrest

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 12: It might seem as if the BJP defied the RSS today by refusing to reduce state levies on fuel but the party claimed that the Sangh never made such a suggestion anyway.

 The Sangh mouthpiece, Organiser, had attacked the BJP-led protest against the petrol price hike. 

 But the BJP and other NDA constituents went ahead with the protests today, with Atal Bihari Vajpayee, L.K. Advani and Rajnath Singh courting arrest. 

 Rajnath Singhji spoke to Bhagwatji (Mohan Bhagwat of the RSS), said BJP spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad. The matter has been clarified. What has appeared in the Organiser is not the RSS point of view.

 Vajpayee led the NDA rally and described the Congress demand to BJP-ruled states to slash sales tax on fuel as a joke. We have no objection if states cut taxes on their own. But it would be a joke if the Centre uses its pressure on states to slash their taxes, Vajpayee said at the rally.

 He also insisted on a reduction in central excise and customs duties to bring down prices of petrol and diesel.

 Cong parity push for cooperative banks

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 5: The National Cooperative Unions of India, which meets the Prime Minister this week to demand parity for cooperative banks and lending institutions with their commercial counterparts, has the Congresss support.

 A 10-member delegation, which includes former Madhya Pradesh chief minister Digvijay Singh, will meet the Prime Minister on Saturday. S.S. Sisodiya, who heads the union, is a former finance minister of Madhya Pradesh.

 They will demand that urban cooperative banks be exempted from paying income tax and the 7 per cent interest rate that commercial banks charge be extended to them. 

 The team will also emphasise that non-performing assets of cooperative banks estimated to be Rs 8,000 crore by the Vaidyanathan committee which was set up by the Centre be either waived or equally shared by the Centre and the states. 

 So far, the Centre has asked state governments to bail out the cooperative banks that are in the red. The NDA government had created a bail-out package for commercial banks whose NPAs amounted to nearly Rs 30,000 crore. The amount we want waived is peanuts, a union source said. 

 The delegation will also ask for the recommendations of the Vaidyanathan committee to be implemented. The committee has suggested a model act to enable state governments to draft their own laws to regulate the working of cooperative banks. 

 Another demand is that cooperative banks be put on the concurrent list to rule out discrimination. 

 At present, cooperative banks come under state governments. 

 The Congress team will also emphasise the need to bring a comprehensive credit control act to cover all lending institutions. 

 Congress sources said Sonia Gandhi was keenly interested in reviving the spirit of the cooperative movement.

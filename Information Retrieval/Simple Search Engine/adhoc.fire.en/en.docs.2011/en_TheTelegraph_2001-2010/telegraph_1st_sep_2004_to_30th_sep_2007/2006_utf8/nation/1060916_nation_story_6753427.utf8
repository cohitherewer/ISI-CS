The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Hindu Subhas

 When told Basu disapproved of his Tarapeeth visit, Chakraborty shot back: People neednt always agree on all counts. Jyotibabu himself had visited a gurdwara with his head covered after Indira Gandhis assassination. 

 Although this wasnt aimed at anyone in particular, he said: Ive been to all famous temples and mosques in India, those who criticise me now have themselves done the same on the sly.

 There might be some truth in that, though communists are supposed to be atheists. 

 Chakraborty said he had visited Kali temples at Kalighat and Dakshineshwar. I see no harm in this. I dont think this violates any principle of Marxism.

 Although CPM state secretariat member Benoy Konar said Chakraborty would have to decide first whether he is a theologist or a Marxist though he need not be one or the other since South America already has a history of priests practising religion with Marxism the BJP was elated.

 Tathagata Roy said: Subhasbabu is a realist. He has finally understood that Marxism belongs to the realm of history, while Hindutva was always there and will continue to remain. At last, hes hit upon the real thing.

 Chakraborty has gone far with his newly expressed opinion on religion, but he claimed he did not perform puja. I was given flowers. Should I have thrown them away? Even if someone offers puja, whats wrong? Millions of people frequent the temple.

 The minister was photographed offering puja with hands folded, garlanding the idol, offering it a zari-lined sari and chanting Joy Ma Tara.

 Chakraborty believes communists have alienated themselves from Indian culture and tradition Sangh boss R.S. Sudarshan would love this.

 Uncomfortable with the lal salaam he has been flashing since his student days, Chakraborty said: I prefer the namaskar and pranam.

 Prakash Karat, the CPM boss, is not going to love this. We havent been able to make ourselves acceptable everywhere. How else can you justify that only three states with an 11-crore population are communist-ruled in a country of over 100 crore? Chakraborty wondered.

 Might in margin and masses

 Thiruvananthapuram, May 11: Crown in hand, the CPM wont say which head will wear it.

 But with Opposition leader V.S. Achuthanandan, whose name was not on the CPMs first list of candidates, pulling off a convincing victory, it will be difficult for the party to overlook him this time.

 Achuthanandan (in picture) won by 20,000 votes from Malampuzha in north Kerala despite whispers that a section within the party would have been happier had he lost.

 Achuthanandan is considered the antithesis of Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee because of his doctrinaire approach and perceived opposition to reforms as well as development projects, though he has been trying of late to dispel the notion that he is a prisoner of the past. 

 Labelled the eternal bridesmaid, the 82-year-old leader was trounced in his own seat in 1996 when the party had won. In an ironical conspiracy of events, when he romped home last time, the party lost.

 This time, however, luck ? plus a vocal group of comrades ? seems to be on the side of Achuthanandan, who had to wage a proxy war against the pro-changers within the party to get the Assembly ticket. The backlash that followed Achuthanandans exclusion forced the CPM to make an unparalleled somersault and accommodate him.

 It is learnt that the rival faction, led by state secretary Pinarayi Vijayan, has almost conceded the top post to Achuthanandan but would ensure that the cabinet is evenly balanced so that the chief minister does not settle scores. 

 For instance, Vijayan would like one of his lieutenants to handle the home portfolio. Similarly, Vijayans faction will insist on the plum portfolios of education and finance.

 Politburo member Sitaram Yechury said in Delhi today that the decision on the new chief minister would be taken on May 13 and the proposal placed before the elected MLAs on May 15.

 The numbers are on Vijayans side in the state party apparatus but Achuthanandan has a popular appeal that few CPM leaders can rival.

 During the past five years as Opposition leader, Achuthanandan has cultivated different classes of people by campaigning against corruption and sexual exploitation of women and championing the cause of environment.

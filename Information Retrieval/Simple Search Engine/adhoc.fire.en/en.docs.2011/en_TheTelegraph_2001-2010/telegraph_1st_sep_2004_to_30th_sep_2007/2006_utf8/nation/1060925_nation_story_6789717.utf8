 Jawan kills colleagues

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Imphal, Sept. 24: Four paramilitary troopers lost their lives to bullets last night not fired by militants but by a colleague who then turned his Insas rifle on himself before being overpowered. 

 The unprovoked burst from K. Saphaba Singh, of Assam Rifles, came a little after 9 inside the 5 Assam Rifles post at Kadamtala of Jiribam sub-division in Imphal East.

 The Imphal resident was part of a security team returning from Silchar last night. As soon as the convoy reached the post, he got off and began firing indiscriminately.

 The four slain jawans have been identified as constable Sawan Singh and riflemen B.K. Singh, S.S. Padha and V. Leimanthang. B.K. Singh and Leimanthang are Manipuris. 

 Four jawans, one of them from Manipur, were injured and are being treated at Silchar Hospital.

 Army spokesperson Lt Col. S.D. Goswami said an army court of inquiry has been set up to probe the firing and did not rule out domestic problems behind the sudden attack.

 An unofficial report said some jawans were drinking inside the post when Saphaba Singh began firing from his service rifle. The report suggested that an argument among the jawans preceded the fatal burst.

 Senior officers said the four injured jawans might throw some light when they are questioned.

 Saphaba Singhs act has swivelled the spotlight back on a syndrome increasingly worrying the army and paramilitary brass: jawans cracking under the strain of a life under the shadow of militancy and training their guns on colleagues and seniors.

 Free TV pledge runs into cash crunch

 Karunanidhi: Promises to keep

 Chennai, June 27: A free colour TV in every poor household ? that is what DMK chief M. Karunanidhi had promised in his Assembly election campaign. But a funds crunch seems to have come in the way. 

 As a result, only 30,000 families will get the free TVs, not all the 53 lakh families below the poverty line as promised, at least not right now. 

 The limited distribution will make the government lighter by Rs 6 crore at least. But thats very little compared with Rs 1,060 crore, which it would have to shell out for gifting TVs to all 53 lakh poor families. 

 As this is a limited number, the government will not float a global tender as was hinted earlier. Global tenders will be called for the second phase, which would be a bigger exercise. 

 The free distribution of the 14-inch colour TVs is to be launched on September 15, the birthday of DMK founder-leader C.N. Annadurai. The government hopes to peg the price of each set at Rs 2,000 as they will be purchased in bulk. 

 A committee of MLAs from various parties has been constituted to oversee implementation of this scheme, which in the DMK manifesto was billed as pro-women, to give them access to recreation and general knowledge. The chairman of this committee is chief minister Karunanidhi himself.

 Opposition ADMK and its ally, the MDMK, have decided to boycott the committee as ADMK chief Jayalalithaa believes the free distribution of TV sets was not a feasible proposition. 

 The MDMK, led by Vaiko, feels the money could have been used elsewhere. 

 All other parties ? the Congress, the Left parties and the PMK ? are represented in this committee. Karunanidhis son M.K. Stalin, also the state rural development minister, is on this panel.

 The committee in its first meeting today identified the profile of the beneficiaries for the first phase. 

 Families living in the samathuvapurams ? ideal villages built in each district during the previous DMK regime where people from all castes live in a complex sharing common amenities ? tribal families in the district of Nilgiri and families of one slum colony each in north and south Chennai will get TVs. Also included will be families living in state-supported rehabilitation homes.

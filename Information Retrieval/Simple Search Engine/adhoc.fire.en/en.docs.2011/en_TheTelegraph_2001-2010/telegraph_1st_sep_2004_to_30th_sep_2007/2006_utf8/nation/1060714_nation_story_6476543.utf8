 PM to see boy who lost legs

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, July 13: When he visits Mumbai tomorrow, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh will try to wipe the tears of a 17-year-old paani-puri vendor who lost both his legs in the blasts. 

 Kamlesh Rajbhor lies on a bed in Ward 2 of Sion Hospital, both his legs amputated.

 The boy who runs a paani-puri stall near Mahim station was standing on the platform on Tuesday evening when a train entered and the first class compartment blew up. A piece of metal that flew off the roof hit Kamleshs legs.

 He was brought to the hospital and had to undergo emergency surgery.

 When I opened my eyes, my friend Shankar was by my bedside and he told me that my legs had to be amputated, the teenager said, tears in his eyes.

 Originally from Zamalpur in Uttar Pradesh, Kamlesh will be among the patients the Prime Minister will meet when he visits two hospitals during his four-hour visit.

 Singh will be accompanied by Maharashtra chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh and Union petroleum minister Murli Deora.

 Government officials handed the boy Rs 50,000 as compensation ? he was among the 34 people who have received the cheques so far.

 More help is likely to pour in from the Congress, which rules the state with alliance partner Nationalist Congress Party.

 Deora has promised Rs 5 lakh and his party colleague Margaret Alva has offered to organise a Jaipur foot for Kamlesh. 

 The Prime Minister is likely to announce additional relief when he visits the hospitals. We handed Rajbhor a cheque, but he doesnt have a bank account. So we will open an account tomorrow morning, Mumbai Regional Congress Committee gen- eral secretary Upendra Doshi said.

 On the eve of the Prime Ministers visit, Sion Hospital was being cleaned and spruced up by workers. Ward 2 was being given a fresh coat of paint and the floor on the way to the ward was being wiped. 

 The additional commissioner (crime), Hemant Nagrale, supervised the security detail and conducted a rehearsal for Singhs convoy.

 The Prime Minister is scheduled to land at 1.30 pm and reach the hospital at 2 pm. 

 After spending 15 minutes there, he will drive to KEM Hospital in Parel and then go back to the airport where he is to meet state administration officials before return- ing to Delhi, government officials said.

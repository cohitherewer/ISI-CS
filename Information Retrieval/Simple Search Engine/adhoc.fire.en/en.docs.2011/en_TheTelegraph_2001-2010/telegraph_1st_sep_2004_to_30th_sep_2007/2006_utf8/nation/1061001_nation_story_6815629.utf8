 Havana terror plan on test

 New Delhi, Sept. 30: As Mumbai police blamed Pakistans Inter-Services Intelligence for the July 11 blasts, an ambitious plan that Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and President Pervez Musharraf recently agreed on went on test even before it has taken off.

 Officials said the first casualty of the police assertion could be the joint mechanism to fight terror that the two leaders decided to put in place when they met in Havana during the NAM summit.

 The mechanism, whose parameters are yet to be defined, would have included exchanging leads while probing crime and was hailed as a step forward in the battle against terrorism.

 Today, with Singh away in South Africa, there was no official reaction from India to Pakistans assertion that Delhi should produce evidence to back its claim that the ISI masterminded the July bombings.

 There has been a strong criticism of the joint mechanism from a section of the security establishment in India which has against trusting Pakistan. Delhi claimed that the joint mechanism would test Pakistans intention of helping India in investigating crime. The Mumbai train blasts were said to be a test case.

 The officials, however, said public opinion was turning against Pakistan and that would make it difficult for the government to sustain the peace process.

 Another hurdle was Pakistans insistence that the joint mechanism would not include help in nailing Kashmiri militants. Islamabad said they fell in a different category.

 The interpretation was challenged by Delhi, which clarified that the scope of the joint mechanism would include all forms of the scourge.

 The officials said Mumbai polices claim has come at a time when Musharraf, who is in London, has been fiercely opposing reports pointing fingers at the ISI for abetting terrorism. He said the agency was responsible for eliminating hundreds of al Qaida elements in the war against terror.

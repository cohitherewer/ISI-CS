 Cop chops an ear after sunlight row

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, Nov. 12: A flourishing banana grove, allegedly blocking sunlight for a crop of peas, triggered a fight in a Bengal village last evening that culminated in a policeman chopping off his neighbours ear. 

 Around 5 pm yesterday, Yaar Ali Mondal snipped some 50 leaves leaning into his territory. 

 Subhendu Biswas, 25, who joined the force just three months ago as a constable, could not take the insult. An altercation ensued and Subhendu started beating up Yaar Ali, a farmer 15 years his senior. 

 Yaar Ali retaliated by landing a punch on his face and Subhendu fled, said an officer of Krishnagunj police station, about 120 km from Calcutta.

 A little after 6 pm, the officer said, Subhendu returned with his father Sunil and four other residents of Majdia in Nadia district. They went to Yaar Alis house and dragged him out. 

 Subhendu, who came with a scythe, started hacking Yaar Ali. At one point, Yaar Alis right ear came off.

 He had to be given 57 stitches all over his body. Doctors at Shaktinagar Hospital here described his condition as critical.

 The constable with the ninth battalion of the Bengal armed police is absconding. Subhendus father Sunil has been arrested, though, for instigating him.

 Some 100 villagers who had gathered hearing the commotion last evening were threatened with dire consequences if they dared to intervene. Dont come anywhere near me. You all know I am a policeman. Just watch how I teach this man a lesson, Subhendu had shouted at the crowd. 

 Yaar Alis brother Hekmat, who was among those who looked on, said all the villagers were scared. No one came forward to save my brother when he cried for help.

 Hekmat, however, was the one to call police.

 The villagers picked up Yaar Ali, who was left unconscious and without an ear, and took him to hospital.

 The police found the ear in front of his house when they came for investigation.

 But for Sunil, all the others have fled. We will arrest them soon, said district police chief Ajay Nand.

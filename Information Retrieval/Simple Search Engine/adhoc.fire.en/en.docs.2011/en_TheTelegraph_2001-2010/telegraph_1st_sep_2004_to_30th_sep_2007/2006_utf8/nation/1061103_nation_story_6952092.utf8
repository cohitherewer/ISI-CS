 New Delhi, Nov. 2: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today sought a legitimate and fair share of public and private sector jobs for minorities while stressing that the nation does not belong to any single race.

 It is essential that communal peace and harmony be maintained and the minorities get a fair share in central and state government and private sector jobs, Singh said, inaugurating the annual conference of state minority commissions.

 Pointing out that poor access to the common school system was the main factor behind the socio-economic backwardness of minorities, Singh said the government would work to ensure greater access for Muslim girls to professional education.

 During the current plan period and the next, we must ensure that concrete schemes for setting up secondary and higher secondary schools in blocks and districts with a predominantly Muslim population are implemented for Muslim girls, he said.

 The Prime Minister stressed that widening access to professional education for Muslim women, particularly to medical and engineering courses, should be a priority area for educational programmes. 

 This nation does not belong to any single race, least of all any group of religious extremists. It belongs to a mosaic of religiously, linguistically and culturally varied communities, he said.

 He said the communal harmony legislation, aimed at guaranteeing compensation to victims of religious riots, is expected to be passed in the winter session of Parliament.

 Asserting that those seeking to disturb communal peace must be dealt with firmly, he said: The Indian state has the solemn obligations to protect the life and liberty of all citizens, particularly those belonging to the minority communities.

 Those affected by communal riots, Singh said, must be provided effective relief and rehabilitation assistance. There should be regular monitoring of the effectiveness and adequacy of such assistance, he added.

 Singh indicated that a bill granting constitutional status to the National Commission for Minorities (NCM) will be passed in the winter session of Parliament. We hope to enact this bill in the winter session. The commission has to be given adequate powers to investigate complaints. Its finances and manpower base will also be expanded.

 The Prime Minister said the Centre has appointed a committee of secretaries to monitor its 15-point minority welfare programme. The chief ministers have been urged to put in place a similar mechanism at the state level so that the new 15-point programme receives due attention at the highest political level.

 However, Singh regretted that a large number of development schemes have not been able to reach out equitably to the poor and the underprivileged among minorities. Available evidence does not inspire confidence that the benefits of these schemes have flowed equitably to the eligible sections among minorities.

 Home minister Shivraj Patil, human resources development minister Arjun Singh and minorities affairs minister A.R. Antulay also attended the annual conference, organised by the National Commission for Minorities. They dwelt mostly on the harmony bill, and on the need to create an atmosphere in which minorities could use their rights fearlessly. 

 Patil said a parliamentary standing committee was vetting the communal harmony legislation.

 Antulay lamented that even 59 years after Independence, the life and properties of minorities are not always safe.

 He expressed concern over the lacklustre functioning of some state minority commissions. Without naming the Gujarat government, he said the Centres suggestions on the riot-displaced persons were not being adhered to in the state.

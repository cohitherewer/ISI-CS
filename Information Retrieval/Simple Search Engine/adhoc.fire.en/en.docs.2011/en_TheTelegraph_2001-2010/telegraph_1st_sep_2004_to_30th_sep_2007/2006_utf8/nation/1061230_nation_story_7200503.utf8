 Teens kill for cell amp; cash

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chennai, Dec. 29: Three teenagers in search of easy cash for a New Years party kidnapped an 11-year-old they knew, and then smashed his head because he wouldnt stop crying, police said.

 Aravind, a doctors son from Chennais western suburb of Saligramam, was kidnapped two days ago by three neighbourhood boys while he was playing hide-and-seek. His body was found near his house yesterday.

 Aravinds father, who works at a leading private hospital, had refused to buckle before the Rs 5-lakh ransom demand and had informed police.

 The police, who had put 15 teams on the job, did not reveal the names of the accused, only giving their ages as 15, 16 and 17. All three have been arrested. Two of them are Class X students and one a school dropout.

 Chennai police commissioner Lathika Saran told reporters the three teenagers had confessed to committing the crime for money. 

 They wanted to buy cellphones and have a good New Year, she said.

 Aravind had been kidnapped on a bicycle and kept in a nearby house the owners were away, and the boys had the keys to the house where he was given a meal of chicken and rice. 

 After some time, the boy began crying, saying he wanted to go home.

 The kidnappers tried to gag him with a piece of cloth but when the boy still continued crying, he was clobbered on the head with bricks, Saran said. The severely bleeding boy fell unconscious and died sometime later, with the gag still stuffed into his mouth.

 They dumped the body on temple land near his house and then made the ransom call. The boy was already dead by the time the ransom call was made, Saran said. 

 The killers cleaned the house and sprinkled chilli powder at the scene of the crime to throw the polices sniffer dogs off the trail, the commissioner said, inspired by a recent Tamil film. The three then went home.

 But police investigation revealed that Aravind was last seen with them, and they broke down under questioning.

 The boys are likely to be sent to a juvenile home and could come out when they turn 18, police sources said. The juvenile act bars sending them to prison, they said.

 Chief minister M. Karunanidhi has expressed shock over the murder and announced a solatium of Rs 1 lakh to the boys family from the chief ministers relief fund.

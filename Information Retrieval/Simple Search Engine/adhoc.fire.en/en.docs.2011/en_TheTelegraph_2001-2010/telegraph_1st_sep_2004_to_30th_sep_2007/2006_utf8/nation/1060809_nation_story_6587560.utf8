 Prod for pesticide-free sugar

 - Ministry orders sophisticated study

 - NGO slams delaying tactic

 New Delhi, Aug. 8: The health ministry has asked research centres in Calcutta, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad to use sophisticated detection equipment to look for even the slightest traces of pesticides in sugar.

 In a statement tabled in Parliament today, health minister Anbumani Ramadoss said this multicentre study would seek to pre-empt the remotest possibility of pesticide traces coming into soft drinks through sugar.

 The minister also said a previous pilot study of 200 sugar samples collected from retail and wholesale outlets from across India last year had broadly found absence of pesticide residues.

 The Bidhan Chandra Krishi Vishwa Vidyalaya in Kalyani, Bengal, the National Institute of Occupational Health in Ahmedabad and the National Institute of Nutrition in Hyderabad will conduct the new study, he said.

 The Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) has questioned the need for the new study when tests on hundreds of sugar samples picked up from different parts of the country have already revealed the absence of pesticide residues.

 The health ministry admits that 200 sugar samples were free of pesticides. The Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) has data on another 275 samples that were also found to be free of residues, said CSE associate director Chandra Bhushan.

 This retesting is just another delaying tactic, he said.

 Ramadoss also said the health ministry had set up an expert committee to guide the process of fixing maximum residual limits for pesticides in carbonated beverages, fruit and vegetable juices and other finished products.

 In a statement today, the CSE challenged cola giants to release data about their soft drinks tested during 2005 or 2006. The pesticide residues we detected are way above the finalised but not yet notified standards, the CSE statement said.

 The non-government organisation cited the report of the joint parliamentary committee released in 2004 that had found some soft drink bottles with levels of pesticide residues higher than standards for packaged water.

 The CSE also said any food item whether milk or apples or vegetables that does not meet standards is unsafe and must be regulated, and the environmental community is working to minimise this contamination.

 The CSE said soft drink companies should not say groundwater is contaminated because they have the technology to clean it up. The standards for pesticides are set on the basis of nutritional value of food, it said in its statement. We cannot compare apples or milk with soft drinks. Milk is essential and it gives us nutrition. But soft drinks are non-essential, non-nutritive.

 Standards for water that goes into soft drinks came into effect from October 2004. A committee of the BIS had met more than a dozen times over the past three years and arrived at the standards for finished soft drinks. These have not been notified.

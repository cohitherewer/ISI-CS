 Wary Delhi stays off Lanka peace talks 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 29: India will not send an observer to the four-nation donors conference to be held in Japan tomorrow, wary of direct participation in the Sri Lankan peace process. 

 Despite several representations from the four co-chairs ? the US, Norway, the European Union and Japan ? India has decided to stay away from the meeting that drives the Lankan peace process.

 However, a spokesperson in the external affairs ministry said today that as in the past, the Indian embassy in Tokyo would be briefed on the decisions arrived at regarding the conference. For an earlier conference in Oslo, Delhi had taken the same approach.

 In order to seek Indias participation, Japans special peace envoy Yashushi Akashi had flown down to Delhi with a request to send an observer for the conference. 

 A similar representation was made by Norway, which is acting as the talks facilitator between the Sri Lankan government and the Tamil Tigers. Norwegian minister Eric Solheim had stopped over in Delhi on his way to Tokyo on Saturday.

 The four co-chairs have, however, left it to Delhis political leadership to decide on its role in the Sri Lankan peace process. 

 There is wide acceptance that India is best placed to facilitate a solution to the ethnic strife in the island nation.

 Delhi, which is not prepared to take a pro-active approach, has maintained that it wants a solution that satisfies all the sections with- out disturbing the territorial integrity of the strife-torn country. 

 Foreign ministry officials said historical reasons are pulling India back from active participation even though the situation on the island is fast deteriorating. 

 The Tokyo conference assumes significance as it is taking place against the backdrop of war clouds looming on Sri Lanka. 

 The conference will discuss the EUs proposed move to ban the LTTE and its possible impact on the peace process. 

 The issue of large-scale displacement of people from the northeastern region of Sri Lanka will also be deliberated upon. 

 A refugee crisis is building up with mass exodus triggered by impending war fears. 

 It will directly affect India, as most of them are Tamils heading for Tamil Nadu.

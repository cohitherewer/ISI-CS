 Tea board slams false Pepsi ad

 Coimbatore (PTI): The Tea Board of India has described as totally false a Pepsi advertisement that reportedly claims that tea contains more pesticide residues than the soft drink.

 The advertisement showing residue level present in tea was 14.2 ppm (parts per million) and 28,000 times more than the standards prescribed by the health ministry is totally misleading, R.D. Nazeem, executive director of the Nilgiri chapter of the board, said on Friday.

 Trip of memories down silk road

 Poonch, June 19: For 100-year-old Reshma Bi, its the end of a six-decade wait. For her great-grandchildren, its a door opening to a land with the magic appeal of forbidden territory.

 Young or old, in Poonch they just cant wait for Tuesday to dawn when yet another India-Pakistan bus service will unite this border town in Jammu with Rawalkot across the Line of Control.

 Congress president Sonia Gandhi and defence minister Pranab Mukherjee would be at the frontier crossing of Chakan da Bagh, seeing off the outgoing bus and welcoming the passengers from Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.

 But right now, the residents of this town have no time to think of VIPs or ceremony ? the opening of the frontier has released emotions embedded deep in their own lives.

 We just cant stop talking about it in family gatherings. A dream has come true after a long wait, said Reshma Bi of Qasba locality.

 The 100-year-old has forgotten which year her shopkeeper husband Dost Mohammad died, but she clearly remembers that it was 1948 when her younger brother Taj Mohammad Khan crossed the frontier and never came back.

 I never saw him again; now Im looking forward to meet him so that I can die in peace, Bi said.

 The Chakan da Bagh point was opened for a day last November 7 ? after 58 years ? to allow trucks to ferry relief to quake-ravaged PoK. Two weeks later, the barrier was lifted briefly again for divided Kashmiri families to cross over on foot.

 But passenger buses will be plying across the line for the first time since 1947, and almost three years after the guns from the bunkers on the surrounding hills fell silent.

 The 12-km stretch from Poonch to Chakan da Bagh, rebuilt after the October 8 quake in less than four months, is smooth as silk, residents say, and the bus will glide along like a boat sailing on calm waters.

 Tomorrow, a bus will leave with 30 Indians and 36 visitors from PoK who will be returning home. Another will bring in 30 from the Pakistani side. The price of a ticket is Rs 70.

 Poonch plans a warm welcome for the visitors, among whom will be shopkeeper Gul Mohammads uncle. When he arrives, my uncle should feel that nothing has changed in these long decades, Mohammad said.

 The twin border districts of Rajouri and Poonch have more than 25,000 families divided by the LoC, but till the November 2003 ceasefire, Poonch seemed to make news only when mortar shells hit from across the frontier.

 The glamour of the launch of the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad bus, on April 7 last year, is missing. The Prime Minister wont be coming; there will be no speeches and no flagging-off ceremony ? only a seeing-off function, a welcome at Chakan da Bagh and a public meeting at the army stadium.

 The hype may be subdued, but the excitement is not.

 I have lived to see this day, and will witness my hopes turn into reality tomorrow, said Abdul Rahim, a man in his late sixties.

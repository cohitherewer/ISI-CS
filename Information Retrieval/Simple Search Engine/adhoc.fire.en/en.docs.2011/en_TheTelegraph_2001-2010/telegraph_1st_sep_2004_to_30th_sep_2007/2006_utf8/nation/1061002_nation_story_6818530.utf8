 Mumbai, Oct. 1: Srichand Hinduja presided over the wedding today in Mumbai of his niece, Renuka, to Swiss lawyer Olivier Cavadini, who could not have imagined the tamasha that would attend his Hindu wedding when he asked his girlfriend to marry him.

 As a concession to Swiss mountain traditions, Srichand commissioned the artist M.F. Husain to include a horn in his wedding art work.

 Renuka is the daughter of Srichands third brother, Prakash, who lives in Geneva.

 A few Swiss visitors, including the bridegrooms father, enjoyed having turbans put around their heads.

 The wedding, which was held at Param Jamuna, the Hinduja mansions in Juhu, drew a respectable crowd of well-known politicians and businessmen. More were expected at tonights gala dinner.

 Among the politicians were Praful Patel, Amar Singh, Murli Deora, Udhav Thackeray and Chagan Bhujbal. Well-known business figures included Mukesh Ambani who came with his wife, Nita. Sunil Mittal of Bharti Telecom was there, too.

 There was a good turnout of personalities from London, among them Sir Gulam Noon, the food millionaire.

 Taking in the sea of followers and the palanquin, which bore the bride away, was New York hotelier Sant Singh Chatwal who had also organised a glamorous wedding with many foreign American guests when his son, Vikram, got married earlier this year.

 Three generations of the Hindujas turned out in force today. With Srichand were his brothers, Gopi, Prakash and Ashok. Then there were their sons and daughters and their children.

 For a business family, the Hindujas are remarkable in one respect. They remain united and a wedding gives the elders a chance to introduce the baby cubs to the outside world.

 We are a global business, explained Srichand.

 Miles to chug to foot blasts bill

 Mumbai, July 23: The Rs 5 crore it must spend on damaged coaches and platforms is the least of Western Railways worries. As its July 11 bill takes shape, its becoming clear that it will be dominated by the huge compensation package.

 Western Railway has already shelled out over Rs 10 crore in ex gratia and theres more to go. Railway authorities are also staring at the huge compensations the railways claims tribunal is likely to award.

 Add to that the hospital bills that are still to be footed, with only Nanavati Hospital and Holy Family Hospital having been paid Rs 6 lakh and Rs 5 lakh.

 I cant say for sure if this is the highest compensation ever paid by the railways, but as far as I can remember, it should be. Once the private hospitals send in their bills, the picture should be clear, said Western Railways chief public relations officer, Pranay Prabhakar.

 That could take some time as most patients need follow-up treatment. We still have about eight-nine patients in our care and each has bills ranging from Rs 20,000 to Rs 25,000. But most of the discharged patients are coming back for follow-ups, said Hinduja Hospital spokesperson Anupam Verma.

 Frankly, victims of a blast such as this need long-term treatment. We have been instructed to send the bill to the state government. They and the railways will sort it out between themselves who will pay the bill.

 Prabhakar agrees. The medical bills will take longer to clear as most of the injured have suffered injuries in their ears, and most of these cases need to be reviewed from time to time. We will pay the bills as and when they come ? theres no ceiling.

 Lilavati Hospital has sent its bills directly to Western Railway but said it cannot reveal the amount.

 We have 20 patients and the bills vary from Rs 50,000 to Rs 3 lakh. Also, many of the discharged patients are coming back to get stitches removed and for further treatment, a Lilavati official said.

 Western Railway has already paid ex gratia of Rs 5 lakh each to the relatives of 177 of the 183 dead; Rs 50,000 each to 189 of the 224 grievously injured and Rs 20,000 each to 188 of the 218 with minor injuries. These include payments to the families of 10 of its 17 employees who died and 33 injured staff.

 Its ridiculous to say WR employees who were victims of the blast will not be paid. In fact, some of them have already been paid, Prabhakar said.

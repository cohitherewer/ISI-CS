 Phone lines choke on call surge

 OUR BUREAU

 July 11: As news of the serial blasts in Mumbai filtered in, Mumbaikars scrambled to ensure that their close ones were safe only to find that all landline and mobile phone networks had jammed.

 Panic-stricken residents may have cursed their phone operators and wanted to fling their phones but this is not the first time that phone networks have jammed in a moment of crisis.

 Mobile phone operators pointed out that such network congestion is to be expected in situations such as this when almost every subscriber tries to make a call at the same time. The network gets overloaded since everybody is trying to reach everybody, an Airtel spokesperson said.

 Airtel has a subscriber base of 1.3 million in Mumbai, which is supported by 1,100 cell towers or base stations and four switches. 

 Each switch can handle around two million calls at peak hours. But calls may not reach the switch at all because of congestion at the base station.

 No network is designed to have all its subscribers call at the same time just as no roads or railways are designed to have all cars or trains run at the same time. Hence, in such a situation there is bound to be congestion, a Hutch spokesperson added. Hutch has a subscriber base of around 2.1 million in Mumbai and 1,200 base stations.

 The spokesperson said it was difficult to put a figure on the number of calls the network can support at any given point since the algorithms are not so simplistic. 

 Thats not to say the mobile company has less capacity, he pointed out. The capacity is huge. In fact, the network is working at more than normal capacity at the moment. But as it is, its peak time and everyone is on the road, he said.

 According to the Airtel spokesperson, there is little that the mobile operators can do to decongest the system, besides try and prioritise services like SMS and send calls in batches. Once people reach home and as people stop making calls, the congestion eases up, he said.

 The Hutch spokesperson added: At such moments, we request our subscribers to only call if they must and to try to make the conversations short.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 One of the 

 last old greats falls silent

 Obituary / Naushad 

 Actors Dharmendra 

 and Dilip Kumar arrive to pay homage to Naushad. Picture 

 by Gajanan Dudhalkar 

 When Baiju Bawra, his first 

 big hit, premiered at Mumbais Broadway Theatre in 

 1952, Naushad couldnt help crying. It was on the footpath 

 across the theatre, where he used to sleep till a few years 

 ago, that he would dream of big screen stars singing his 

 songs of love, heartbreak and death.

 Naushad Ali died today of illnesses 

 associated with old age at Nanavati Hospital in Mumbai. 

 He was 86.

 He was mourned by the entire film 

 industry, which remembers him as one of the last greats 

 of the old guard, a fine zinda dil (lively) 

 human being and, above all, one of the greatest musicians 

 who contributed to make Hindi cinema what it is today.

 Dilip Kumar, a contemporary and 

 a close friend who was his constant companion for the last 

 two years, could barely speak. A noble man, 

 Naushad was unforgettable, he said. 

 Naushads life and achievements 

 span the history of modern Indian cinema. Born in Lucknow 

 in 1919, Naushad realised early that music would rule his 

 life. Away from home, the boy would spend hours under the 

 spell of the haunting voice of a wandering qawaal or 

 a flute player despite a disapproving father.

 As a young man, Naushad trained 

 under Ustad Ghurbat Ali, Ustad Yusuf Ali and Ustad Babban 

 Saheb in Lucknow, got work as a harmonium repairer and composer 

 for amateur musical theatricals ? and then ran away to Mumbai 

 to fulfil his destiny.

 He worked with music director 

 Khemchand Prakash, who composed for Mahal, and later 

 with A.R. Kardar and P.N. Madhok. Naushad made his debut 

 with Prem Nagar in 1940. His best-known compositions 

 are from Mughal-e-Azam, Mother India, Baiju 

 Bawra, Mela and Sangharsh. Naushads 

 last film was Akbar Khans Taj Mahal, which 

 has just been released in Pakistan.

 It is a great loss. He was 

 awesome. If one thinks of the first two or three names associated 

 with Indian cinema, his is one of them, said poet 

 and lyricist Javed Akhtar.

 I did not have an opportunity 

 to work with him, though my father (poet Jan Nisar Akhtar) 

 did work with him for one film. As a composer, Naushads 

 greatest strength was the Indianness of his music, 

 Akhtar said. He made Indian classical music simple 

 and made it reach the common man.

 He added: His greatest work 

 was with Shakeel Badayuni. Naushad the composer, Badayuni 

 the poet and often Mohammad Rafi the singer formed a trio 

 that made some unforgettable melodies. 

 Some of the best examples of the 

 Naushad-Badayuni partnership are Afsana likh rahi hun 

 dil-e-beqarar ka from Dard sung by Uma Devi (discovered 

 as a singer by Naushad, she became Baby Tuntun later); Bachpan 

 ke dil bhula na dena from Deedar, Mohe bhool 

 gaye sanwariya from Baiju Bawra, Mere mehboob 

 tujhe meri mohabbat ki kasam from Mere Mehboob; 

 Apni azaadi ko hum hargiz mita sakte nahin from Leader; 

 Aaj ki raat mere dil ke salaami lele from Ram 

 Aur Shyam and Aaj puraani raahon se koi mujhe awaaz 

 na de from Aadmi. 

 In a recent interview, when Mughal-e-Azam 

 was released in colour, Naushad reminisced about how 

 one of the eternal Hindi love songs came to be made. 

 When the music team was asked 

 to write a love song, Badayuni first came up with lyrics 

 like Prem kiya tha chori nahi kari. But Naushad didnt 

 like it. Badayuni revised the words and settled on Pyaar 

 kiya to darna kya. Naushad, Badayuni and producer K. 

 Asif then worked through the night to finish the song. 

 Actor Raza Murad, for whom Naushad 

 was a father figure, said the recipient of the Dadasaheb 

 Phalke Award was not only a great music director but his 

 work was particularly relevant to our times. 

 Even as religion is again 

 an issue in Gujarat, it is wise to remember that in Baiju 

 Bawra, Naushad the composer, Badayuni the poet and Rafi 

 the singer came together to create a song that went Man 

 tarpat Hari darshan ko aaj. 

 Naushad was representative of 

 a culture that is gone, said Akhtar. He 

 had that politeness of words and courteous manners. He embodied 

 Lucknow ki tehzeeb. 

 He was full of life and 

 humour till the end, said Dilip Kumar. 

 At Nanavati Hospital, where Naushad 

 was admitted on April 20, he would regale doctors with shayari. 

 I met him day before yesterday. 

 As I was leaving, I said I did not want to burden him any 

 more. He shot back saying how could that be a burden, 

 said the actor, breaking down. 

 And he had a good word for everyone. 

 In a tribute to Mehmood after the comedians demise, 

 Naushad told The Telegraph: Mehmood saab 

 ko jannat mile (May Mehmood go to heaven).

 That is where he, too, belongs.

NATION BRIEFS

 Krishnagar, June 27: An 11-year-old girl committed suicide in a Nadia village this morning after her mother refused to give a rupee more than what she usually does to buy vegetables.

 Jhumpa Das of Chakdah, who had to do the daily bazaar as her mother and elder sister went out to work as domestic helps, asked for Rs 11 today. 

 Ratna, the mother, a divorcee, slapped her for being a spendthrift. Together 

with 15-year-old Shampa, she earns Rs 900 every month.

 The inspector-in-charge of Chakdah police station, about 60 km from Calcutta, said the mother saw Jhumpa hanging on returning home from work.

 Hyderabad: The anti-Naxalite commando force, Greyhounds, killed eight Maoists in the Amrabad forest belt, about 235 km southwest of Hyderabad, on Tuesday. Of the eight killed, six were women. The encounter happened on a day the rebels had called a state bandh to protest the police killing of two of their top leaders last week. The patrolling commandos zeroed in on the Maoists when they were resting after lunch. The commando bullets killed four rebels, including their commander Mahesh and his deputy Swaroopa, on the spot.

 New Delhi: Defence minister Pranab Mukherjee will chair a meeting on Wednesday that will discuss the creation of special battalions of army veterans to combat Naxalites in several states. The meeting of the Kendriya Sainik Board will be attended by chief ministers of a number of states. Its agenda paper notes that many states are facing extremist problems and difficult law and order situations and a special battalion entirely comprising ex-servicemen would be a very effective force. The states would also save on training cost and time.

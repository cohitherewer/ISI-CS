The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Probe and politics in guru clash

 OUR BUREAU AND PTI

 New Delhi, Jan. 4: Confirming that the herbal medicine samples provided by Brinda Karat tested positive for animal and human parts, the Centre has asked the Uttaranchal government to carry out an independent probe into allegations against the drugs promoted by yoga guru Swami Ramdev.

 The popular television guru, however, found support at two ends of the political spectrum. The Samajwadi Party and the BJP felt that the controversy is linked to an attempt to malign traditional forms of medicine.

 Union health minister Anbumani Ramadoss said the Uttaranchal government has been requested to carry out fresh tests as the samples given by Karat were not lifted directly by the Centre. Ramdevs pharmacy is based in Uttaranchals Hardwar.

 CPM leader Brinda Karat supplied those samples to us, which we got tested. Now we have asked Uttaranchals drug controllers to investigate the case, Ramadoss said.

 The tests were done at three centres, including one in Calcutta.

 Ramadoss said the alleged samples of Ramdevs impotency drug contained animal and bone parts. Ramdevs pharmacy stocks herbal medicines that claim to treat conditions ranging from epilepsy to cancer to impotency.

 Ramdev has dismissed the allegations, saying he was being framed by multinationals opposed to his indigenous medicines.

 There are several issues. We did not pick the samples. She (Karat), being an MP, supplied those samples to us and it was my duty to get them examined, Ramadoss said.

 The minister said high levels of calcium and phosphorous were found in two samples.

 If found guilty by Uttaranchal authorities of mislabelling his medicines as purely herbal, Ramdev could be charged under the Drug and Cosmetics Act, the minister said.

 In Agra, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav said he was with Ramdev on the issue as the yoga guru had taken up cudgels against multinational drug companies. Ramdev was also promoting indigenous medicines, the chief minister said.

 Mulayam Singhs traditional foe, the BJP, too, saw in the controversy an attempt to destroy Indian faith in Ayurveda.

 BJP spokesperson Prakash Javadekar flashed copies of Karats statement and the health ministrys letter. Where does the letter say that human skulls and animal parts are being used in medicines produced in Divya Yog Pharmacy owned by Baba Ramdev? Javadekar asked. There is a deliberate attempt here to destroy Indian faith in Ayurveda.

 The RSS tonight said the controversy is a conspiracy hatched by retrograde Leftists to demean reputed persons of Bharatiya culture.

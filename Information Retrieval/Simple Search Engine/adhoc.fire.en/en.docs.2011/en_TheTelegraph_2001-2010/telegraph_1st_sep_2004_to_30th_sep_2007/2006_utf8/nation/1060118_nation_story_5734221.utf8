 NDA to join Speaker meet

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 17: The NDA today decided to attend an all-party meeting called by Speaker Somnath Chatterjee on January 20 to discuss court notices on the expulsion of MPs but said it was against any clash between the legislature and the judiciary.

 The BJP, on its own, has done a number of flip-flops on the expulsion. Leader of Opposition L.K. Advani had shocked his party by boycotting Parliament over it.

 Advani was widely criticised within the party both for the boycott and his statement that expulsion was too harsh a punishment for the MPs involved in the cash-for-questions scam.

 But the BJPs alliance partner ? the Janata Dal (United) ? had refused to join the boycott and voted for the motion to expel the MPs. The BJP has since been eager to sink differences though it was not clear, till a few days ago, if it would attend the all-party meet. The issue was not sorted out even at the BJP parliamentary party meet last week.

 Today, however, the NDA spoke in one voice with BJP deputy leader in Parliament V.K. Malhotra, saying the issue should not snowball into a confrontation between the judiciary and the legislature.

 We will put across our view that we are against any confrontation between the judiciary and the legislature. We had said earlier also that the opinion of courts should be sought, he said after an hour-long meeting of NDA leaders at A.B. Vajpayees residence.

 Asked if the Speaker should accept the notice issued by the courts, Malhotra said: They should receive the notice but the Speaker or the chairman of the upper House need not present themselves before courts.

 But Malhotra and NDA convener George Fernandes took exception to what they termed the Speakers publicising the issue even before the all-party meet. The Supreme Court has sought the assistance of Parliament in resolving the case and we should respond, Fernandes said. Nothing should be done that will create rifts in the system.

 Prosecution plea

 A lawyer has moved a special court in Delhi seeking prosecution of the expelled MPs, reports PTI.

 The lawyer filed 11 complaints on January 10, saying the MPs were public servants under Section 2(c) of the Prevention of Corruption Act. Accusing them of abusing their position as public servants, he urged the court to take cognisance of their offences.

 The complaints, originally filed at the Tis Hazari courts, have since been transferred to the Patiala House courts.

 The identical complaints ? to be heard on February 20 ? have been filed under Section 5 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, which empowers a special judge to take cognisance of an offence without the accused being committed to trial.

 According to the complaints, the MPs rendered illegal services by asking questions in Parliament and committed the offence of criminal misconduct by taking money by corrupt and illegal means.

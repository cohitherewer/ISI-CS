 Musharraf: Delhi cold wave 

 New Delhi, Jan. 7: A sense of pessimism crept up on bilateral relations as Delhi today rejected Pakistan president Pervez Musharrafs fresh proposal to demilitarise Srinagar, Kupwara and Baramulla.

 Delhi also turned down suggestions for a joint control or joint management of Jammu and Kashmir, saying it cannot be the basis of any settlement as the state was an integral part of India.

 In a sharp reaction to Musharrafs remarks during a television interview that he would ensure peace if the army is pulled out of the three districts, the Indian foreign ministry said demilitarisation or re-deployment of forces was an internal matter and not governed by any foreign government.

 India was also cool to a possible move from Pakistan to invite Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to watch a match in the cricket series. Official sources said even though there was no formal invitation, Singh had no plan to undertake cricket diplomacy.

 The foreign office also took exception to Musharrafs promise to stop militancy in Kashmir. The ministry reminded the President that he had promised to check terrorism and not militancy. The solemn implementation of his commitment was unconditional, it added.

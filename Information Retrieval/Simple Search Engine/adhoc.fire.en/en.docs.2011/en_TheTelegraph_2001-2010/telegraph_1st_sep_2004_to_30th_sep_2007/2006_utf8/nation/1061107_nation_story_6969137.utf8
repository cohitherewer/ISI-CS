The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 NDA? Not a word 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Calcutta, Nov. 6: Mamata Banerjee continued to keep everyone guessing today, keeping mum on her relations with the BJP-led NDA.

 I have nothing to say in this regard. My party has a policy of its own and I would not speak a word more than that. I will decide what to do in the future, she said. 

 However, Mamata (in picture) 

 welcomed the Youth Congresss support to Trinamul 

 Congress programmes against the Bengal government. Its 

 good.

 Told that the BJP had decided to invite her to a programme in Nadia to be attended by its president Rajnath Singh, she pleaded ignorance. 

 Bengal BJP general secretary Rahul Sinha confirmed that the party had invited her. 

 At a three-hour meeting of the Trinamul general council, Mamata refused to take questions from party functionaries on her BJP ties. When someone wanted to know if the tie-up with the Congress would send a wrong signal to the partys rank and file, she asked him to keep quiet. 

 The Youth Congress had invited Mamata to a demonstration in north Calcutta against the blood test kit scam today. Mamata didnt go.

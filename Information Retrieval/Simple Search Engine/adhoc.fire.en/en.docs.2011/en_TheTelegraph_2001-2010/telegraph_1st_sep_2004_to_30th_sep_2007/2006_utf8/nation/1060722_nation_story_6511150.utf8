 Air force denies moles in ranks

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 21: The air force today said multiple checks on its personnel were being carried out and there is no evidence that it is being subverted from within. These checks were a standard procedure in the force.

 We cannot discuss intelligence inputs publicly. However, on receiving such reports we have our procedures and machinery in place to act expeditiously. I can assure that we have scanned the system and there is no militant in the force, air force spokesman Wing Commander Mahesh Upasani said. 

 The air force clarification comes after a letter by national security adviser (NSA) M.K. Narayanan to chief ministers was leaked to a television channel. The letter asked the chief ministers to tone up the police administration because militants were now infiltrating the security apparatus. To illustrate his point the NSA referred to a 40-page report by the National Security Council Secretariat last September that insinuated that operatives of the Lashkar-e-Toiba had got themselves recruited into the Indian Air Force.

 It is rare for an official as senior as the national security adviser to cast aspersions on the armed forces even if it was meant as a lesson for the state police forces. Defence sources said they were alerted by warnings from intelligence agencies before the NSA sent the letter to chief ministers and had verified antecedents of recruits.

 In the air force we have methods to check personnel through police and other intelligence agencies. These verifications are carried out periodically, Upasani said.

 Where even a milkmaid stirs fear

 UTTAM SENGUPTA IN JHUMRA

 Sangita: Young and deadly

 She is seventeen and has already spent six years in the jungle with the Maoists. Sangita is now in jail but the policemen who interacted with her cannot get over their awe. 

 A wide-eyed sub-inspector narrates how the frail girl dismantled and assembled an AK-47 in just two and a half minutes.

 An IPS officer marvels at her intelligence while a CRPF assistant commandant exclaims, She has no formal education but her poise and wit certainly floored us.

 While it is now known that every Maoist armed squad active in Jharkhand and there are 37 such squads in Jhumra alone comprises 18 guerrilla fighters including two or three women. Sangitas squad, she confided, has as many as nine women, possibly because it is a technical squad. 

 Unlike others, said her interrogators, Sangita is not quite singing but has admitted that her role was to set up mines and bombs.

 Unlike in Bihar, where squads do not boast of women in their ranks, women from Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Andhra are playing an increasingly important role in the Communist Party of India (Maoist). Sheila Marandi, for example, is known to be a member of the central committee and another woman is known to be the area commander of the outfit in the Piparwar area of Khelari.

 But not many of them have surrendered or been arrested. Only five women have been arrested in the last one year in Bokaro, Giridih, Dhanbad and Hazaribagh. 

 And the only woman to have surrendered in the last five years, Pooja Hembrom, was abducted by the rebels and killed after she was made an approver and given a post in the Jharkhand Armed Police.

 Recalls a senior IPS officer, with whom Hembrom stayed till her tragic end: She was aware of the risks and we had forbidden her from moving out alone or without any information. 

 But she was depressed and was apparently in love with a member of the squad. She went out to meet him and was picked up by the rebels.

 Pooja, she says, was disillusioned because the organisation would not allow her to remain committed to the relationship. She also complained that she was forced to cook and wash utensils but was not given the education that she was promised.

 But Naxalites, point out police officers, are increasingly using women as baits. The attraction of living with women, they claim, lure village youth to join the banned outfit.

 Medical examinations of the arrested women, some of them barely in their teens, confirmed that they were sexually active. More important, women are being increasingly used to catch unsuspecting security personnel off guard.

 At Topchanchi (Dhanbad), a woman approached a guard on duty at a police outpost and asked for drinking water. When the guard left his post and laid down his firearm to pump water, Naxalites stormed the post, killed all the five policemen and decamped with arms. During the raid of the armoury of home guards at Giridih also, police sources said, women were used for distraction. 

 Now we ask women to remain at arms length, said an officer. Even when the milk woman comes to the camp, we prefer to send our men out, concurred a CRPF officer at Jhumra.

 Moreover, women get access to homes more easily and are more effective in persuading villagers to join the outfit, believe officials. 

 Around 15 per cent of the hardcore, armed Maoists in the state are women, they believe. But most of them join the rebels ranks because of problems in the family. 

 Either stepmothers ill-treat them or their widowed mothers marry again. Thats why most of them have no home to return to and, therefore, surrender is often not an option.

 Arjun taps party foes

 DHIRENDRA K. JHA 

 New Delhi, May 10: Arjun Singh, under attack in his party for going public on reservation for OBCs, is seeking support for his proposal from the Congresss known enemies.

 The HRD minister recently got in touch with the Samajwadi Partys chief whip in Parliament, Mohan Singh, to ask him for help to push through the proposal to reserve 27 per cent seats in higher education institutions. 

 About 10 days ago, the minister had briefed Janata Dal (United) president Sharad Yadav on the quota plan, which will cover institutions like IITs and IIMs, Dal (U) sources confirmed. 

 Both parties, associated with Mandal politics, are political enemies of the Congress ? one in Uttar Pradesh and the other in Bihar. With the Samajwadis, the relationship is particularly bitter. Rahul Gandhi, on whom the Congress has pinned its hopes for the future, has more than once got into a wrangle with the party which loves to hate Sonia Gandhi.

 Sources said Arjuns overtures to the Samajwadis and Dal (U) are aimed at putting pressure on his partys leadership. He already has the support of the Left.

 The Congress finds itself in a fix on the quota proposal ? it can go neither forward nor backward. In the absence of a formidable group of OBC leaders, it can hardly hope to capitalise on a forward movement. Such a move might also hit its renewed penetration among the upper castes. But a step backward will further alienate the large mass of OBC voters. 

 The dominant viewpoint in the party, therefore, is to strike a balance that will satisfy both the OBCs as well as economically weaker sections of the upper castes.

 Arjuns concerted effort to muster support from outside the party comes even before the Congress has formally discussed the issue and firmed up an opinion on how to wriggle out of the controversy. 

 His latest forays may, therefore, further infuriate those Congress leaders who are up in arms against not only the quota proposal but also the way Arjun has sought to push it through.

 Stormy passage for profit bill

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 31: The passage of the controversial profit bill was not expected to be smooth, but even the Opposition would not have expected the uproar that accompanied the division of votes in the Lok Sabha over the issue today.

 The lower House passed unchanged the Parliament (Prevention of Disqualification) Amendment bill that gives reprieve to over 40 MPs, including Speaker Somnath Chatterjee, after a bitter daylong debate.

 The bill, returned by President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam for reconsideration by Parliament, was passed by the Rajya Sabha last week.

 So acrimonious was the discussion in the Lok Sabha that despite the bill having been passed by a voice vote, a division was asked for by the Opposition that deputy Speaker Charanjit Singh Chatwal allowed.

 The bill was finally passed with 230 votes in favour and 71 against, with the government expressing readiness to set up a joint parliamentary committee to go into the definition of office of profit. Congress president Sonia Gandhi and the Speaker were not present in the House. 

 Leader of Opposition L.K. Advani warned the government that the bill would face judicial reprimand. 

 I urge you to reconsider the bill. Do not be in a haste to pass it. It will not stand the test of judicial scrutiny. We should not send the message that the bill was passed to protect MPs, he said.

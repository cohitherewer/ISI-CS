 Jessica prompts Sonia law-change call

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 3: In the wake of the Jessica Lal case, Sonia Gandhi has written a letter to home minister Shivraj Patil, suggesting that the government amend the Criminal Procedure Code to protect witnesses in criminal cases and ensure they do not turn hostile. 

 The letter also said statements of the victim and the witnesses should be properly recorded and the victim should be given the right to appeal if they felt justice had not been done. 

 Patil, who received the letter today, described these suggestions as very good and said they would be incorporated in the amendment bill. He has handed the letter to home secretary V.K. Duggal. Sources said Duggal was told to look into the matter immediately so that the bill could be passed in the ongoing Parliament session.

 The Congress presidents letter follows the countrywide uproar over the acquittal of the accused in the Jessica Lal murder for want of evidence. The model doubling as bartender was shot dead in a restaurant allegedly by Manu Sharma, the son of a Haryana minister, when she refused to serve alcohol at 2 am.

 The acquittal sparked a public campaign for retrial. While no decision has been taken on a retrial, Sonias letter, official sources said, would push the government to legislate the change in the existing bill.

 BJP spokesperson Sushma Swaraj, who chairs the parliamentary standing committee on home affairs, said in a news briefing that if the government desired, it would study the bill and recommend the inclusion of Sonias proposals. The bill, said Sushma, was introduced when the NDA was in power but there was no provision for witness protection. The bill could not be passed because the government was voted out.

 When the UPA came to power, the bill was reintroduced but awaits discussion and passage. It was not on the agenda of the ongoing session but it appears that the standing committee ? despite Sushmas known antipathy for the Congress president ? is set to get cracking. 

 When the NDA had amended the bill, we did not anticipate that a case like Jessica Lals would have such a fallout. Otherwise, we would have made the changes, she said. 

 Ironically, the Congress was not aware of Sonias letter. A media cell member said: We are ascertaining if she wrote it. Party spokespersons Abhishek Singhvi and Jayanthi Natarajan could not be reached.

 The party took its own time to react to the Jessica Lal case even as the Left and the BJP were quick off the mark. After a signal from 10 Janpath, its members demanded a retrial in Parliament.

 However, Congress sources said after the interest evinced by Sonia, it was no longer that certain if Vinod Sharma, Manus father, could keep his job. He is a minister in the Haryana government. The chief minister, Bhupinder Singh Hooda, recently defended him. 

 In the Congress, there was a view that as long as Sharma senior distanced himself from his son, he would be safe. Nobodys willing to bet on that anymore.

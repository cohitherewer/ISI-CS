The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 With women, free rice and Jaya rule

 M.R. VENKATESH

 Jayalalithaa: Promises galore

 Tiruchirappalli, April 28: Chinese and tandoori food available here, the board in front of Manivilas, a vegetarian restaurant at Srirangam, proclaims proudly.

 This would have been unthinkable even at the turn of the millennium in the ancient Vaishnav pilgrim centre, but a lot appears to have changed in five years.

 Or has it? As Jayalalithaas campaign van pulls up before a small mandap, built in memory of Sri Chaitanya who paid a visit in 1510, it reminds you that some things have stayed the same.

 The freebie war before an election, for instance.

 It had been her rival M. Karunanidhi, the DMK chief, who had fired the first shot by promising quality rice at just Rs 2 a kg to ration card holders. Now Jayalalithaa has gone one better by offering 10 kg rice free.

 And from the looks of it, the women in the villages have bitten the bait.

 I have been voting for the two leaves symbol (of the AIADMK) since I was 18, said Palaniamma, a middle-aged farm worker in Manikandam near Tiruchirappalli whose right hand is crippled by arthritis. I cant forget Amma, who for seven months during the drought three years ago gave us 30 kg of free rice per month.

 Dhanalakshmi, who sells flowers near the Srirangam temple, doesnt care about the bouquet of sops announced in the DMK manifesto, including free colour TV sets.

 I shall vote only for Amma. She will implement the 10 kg free rice scheme. I have confidence in her, she said.

 The goodwill of these women forms the bedrock of the chief ministers campaign as she flits from one constituency to another in an electioneering blitz that resembles a carnival.

 Hours before her meeting began near the 13-tier, 235-foot-tall Raja Gopuram tower of Srirangams Ranganathaswamy temple, the crowd was out in strength in the scorching summer heat.

 Young singers belted out hits from old films of the late MGR, former chief minister and Jayalalithaas political mentor. These were interspersed with improvised songs plugging the achievements of Ammas government in the past five years.

 A pre-recorded speech by the chief minister announced how she had striven to follow MGRs path and the promise she had made to him to be a mother, guide and protector to the Tamil people.

 Suddenly the din reached a crescendo ? the arrival of the security personnels jeeps meant Amma wasnt far behind. A group of Dalit village musicians began playing on a long, pipe-like folk instrument to the accompaniment of drums.

 Into this festive scene, festoons and banners flapping all around, Jayalalithaa made her entrance.

 She grabbed the microphone and talked of the free rice scheme, of how she had ably tackled the tsunami tragedy and the floods and turned the state into a haven of peace.

 Sometimes, she has a surprise for the audience. In Musiri town last night, she promised to write off farm loans and interest arrears due to cooperative banks as thousands listened, many from treetops, roofs and the tops of transport buses.

 But to many women voters, it doesnt matter if none of this is delivered.

 Some of us in the Dalit colony did not get the Rs 1,000 announced as flood relief, but we will still vote for Amma, a woman said at Iyampalayam.

 Mumbai, Dec. 26: Mumbai will not get a drop of water tomorrow so air travellers might have to go without air-conditioning and find some toilets locked, hospitals will cater only to emergency patients, and the citys 16 million residents will need to fill drums, buckets and maybe even pots and pans to cope with the dry day.

 Municipal commissioner Johny Joseph said the water supply will be shut at 10 am tomorrow and will resume at 10 am on Thursday.

 During the 24-hour shutdown, perhaps the first in the citys history, BMCs hydraulic engineers will carry out repairs and replace a stretch of the citys chief water supply pipeline to add another 250 million litres per day (MLD) to the citys water supply. Mumbai now receives about 3,200 MLD of water, but needs about 3,900 MLD. 

 We will be laying and joining a huge pipeline at Pise Panjrapur during this shutdown, said A.N. Gajbaje, senior hydraulic engineer. The work is part of a project that will increase water supply by 1,000 MLD by June. 

 But for now, residents are panicky. We bought additional drums to store water. But if the shutdown continues for more than a day, we are not sure what to do, said Hira Sawant, a housewife in Vikroli, who has also filled up large utensils with water. 

 Advocate Farhana Shah, one of actor Sanjay Dutts five lawyers, said her central Mumbai building had installed two pumps to ensure water reaches the top floors. We stay on the fourth floor and the water pressure is low. We get water only for two hours anyway. The pumps have ensured the water storage tank in the house is full. 

 Sion Hospital, one of the citys largest, is not taking chances. We have decided to postpone planned routine surgeries. We will only do emergency operations. We will minimise routine admissions, Dr M.E. Yeolekar said.

 Mumbai International Airport Limited spokesperson Manish Kalghatgi said: The airport has a storage capacity of about 30 lakh litres, but our usage is about 40 lakh litres per day. We may have to rationalise the use of air-conditioning and keep some toilets closed.

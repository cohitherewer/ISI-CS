 Relief for ex-soldiers

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi, Aug. 22: The Supreme Court today directed the government to provide free medical facilities to army personnel who retired before January 1996.

 The order came on a public interest litigation filed by the Confederation of Ex-Servicemen, which sought free and full medical services.

 The Centre said a scheme was in force for medical benefits to ex-army personnel against a one-time contribution. 

 The court upheld the scheme, but the bench headed by Chief Justice Y. K. Sabharwal asked the government to either waive the amount, or pay it on behalf of those soldiers who retired before January 1996.

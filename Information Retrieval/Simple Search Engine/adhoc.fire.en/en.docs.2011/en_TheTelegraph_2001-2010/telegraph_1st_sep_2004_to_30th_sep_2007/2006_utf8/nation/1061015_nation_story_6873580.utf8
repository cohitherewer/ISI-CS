The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Singh sees big power hurdle to UN seat

 BHARAT BHUSHAN

 On 

 board Air India One, Oct. 14: Having lost the race for 

 the UN secretary-generals job two weeks ago, the 

 chances of India joining the high table at the Security 

 Council also seem to have receded. 

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh 

 today admitted that some big powers were coming 

 in the way of India realising its ambition.

 Those in power would not 

 like to give up their power. Some big powers still do not 

 appear to have made up their mind. Therefore, we have a 

 long way to go before effective reforms in the Security 

 Council can be realised, Singh said.

 He was clearly hinting at the 

 US. Of the permanent five members of the council, Britain, 

 France and Russia have supported Indias candidature 

 while China, though opposed to Japans candidature, 

 is privately sympathetic to India. That only leaves the 

 US.

 Singh also seemed somewhat tentative 

 about the future of the India-US nuclear deal. I 

 do not control the legislative process of the US. But I 

 still feel, and we have assurance of the US government, 

 that they are very serious....

 Claiming growing support for 

 India in the 45-member Nuclear Suppliers Group, to whom 

 India made a presentation on Thursday in Vienna, Singh said: 

 All the major powers Russia, France, Britain 

 and the US are supportive of India being given exceptional 

 treatment and of the terms of our agreement with the US.

 Reluctant to name Pakistan directly 

 in Europe, on the way back home the Prime Minister was very 

 pointed about its role in terrorist acts in India. He claimed 

 that Delhi would provide Islamabad credible evidence of 

 the involvement of elements in the Pakistan establishment 

 in acts of terrorism against India. 

 Referring to denials already emanating 

 from Pakistan, he asked: Before we have even given 

 them evidence, what is the point of talking like this?

 About the embarrassment caused 

 to the government over the appointment of the U.C. Banerjee 

 Committee inquiring the Gujarat riots being described as 

 politically motivated and illegal by the states high 

 court, Singh said he would review the situation and decide 

 whether to go for an appeal or explore other alternatives.

 He suggested that the Centre 

 was not going to take a hasty decision on the recommendations 

 of the Jeevan Reddy Commission for repealing the Armed Forces 

 (Special Powers) Act. We have to understand the gravity 

 of the situation in various parts of the country. 

 Defence agents

 The Prime Minister refused to 

 comment specifically on former defence minister George Fernandes 

 being charged in the Barak deal. The legal process 

 must proceed, he said while admitting that the question 

 of agents in defence deals was a vexing one. 

 If agents cannot be done 

 away with, then we must know who the agents are. They could 

 be registered or some other mechanism would have to be found.

 Asked about Fernandess 

 comments on the President, he said with a wicked smile: 

 Nothing surprises me particularly a comment 

 from Mr George Fernandes.

 Singh said he had read parts 

 of General Pervez Musharrafs autobiography and found 

 it very interesting. But he refused to make 

 any specific comments on the contents of the book as India 

 and Pakistan had to do business with each other.

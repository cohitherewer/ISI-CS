 Pak terror link on Blair table

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 7: After sharing with the US Mumbai polices findings implicating Pakistan in the 7/11 train blasts, India is planning to put the evidence before Britain and the European Union.

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who leaves on Monday for London and Helsinki, will raise Delhis concerns about terrorism in the wake of the recent findings, foreign secretary Shiv Shankar Menon said today.

 India and Britain have held talks on terrorism in a joint working group. Menon said the forum would be used to raise concerns about the recent incidents and the findings that have come to light.

 He said Indias position on terrorism has not changed and was determined by what we see on the ground. He said the proposed India-Pakistan joint mechanism on terrorism will not compromise Delhis efforts to highlight Islamabads role in terrorism.

 Singh will meet British Prime Minister Tony Blair for the third India-Britain summit in London. He will also meet chancellor of the exchequer Gordon Brown and foreign secretary Margaret Beckett.

 The security issues will dominate the talks as India and Britain will be holding major sporting events Delhi is the venue for the 2010 Commonwealth Games and London will host Olympics 2012 that will require close cooperation.

 Menon said support on the nuclear deal with the US would also top the agenda during the Prime Ministers visit to London and Helsinki, where he will attend the 4th India-EU summit on October 12.

 Britain has already supported the deal. As most of the EU countries are members of the Nuclear Suppliers Group, Delhi will get a forum to lobby its case of opening up nuclear trade. Menon said the EU, as a bloc, has not formulated its position on the nuclear deal. But many members have come out in support of the civil nuclear cooperation with India.

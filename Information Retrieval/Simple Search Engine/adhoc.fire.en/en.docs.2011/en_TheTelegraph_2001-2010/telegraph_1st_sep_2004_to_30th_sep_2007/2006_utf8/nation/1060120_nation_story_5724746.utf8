 Party plot thickens

 Hyderabad, Jan. 19: Just when the Andhra Pradesh state Congress was getting ready for the partys plenary here on January 21, a new problem has cropped up. 

 The state Congress committees plan to acquire 5,000 square feet of prime government land has run into rough weather as some 100 encroachers at Bhimraowada in Nampally ? the site of the plot ? are up in arms against the proposal. 

 When Sonia Gandhi comes, we will meet her. We will threaten to kill ourselves if they ask us to vacate, said Bapu Rao Yadav, one of the encroachers. Didnt they find any other place to construct the party office? We have our roots in this place for the last 20 years. Why should we go? asked another one.

 The state Congress has been functioning from Gandhi Bhavan managed by the Gandhi Trust, paying a rent of Re 1 monthly for the last 35 years. 

 But Andhra chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy, who had spent lakhs to renovate the Gandhi Bhavan, felt the need for a separate building for the state unit. 

 So, the plot at Bhimraowada, adjacent to the present location, was chosen for allocation to the ruling party at a throwaway price of Rs 100 for each sq foot when the market rate is Rs 25,000 per square foot. 

 This deal, too, has raised eyebrows. 

 The state government, however, justifies the deal by saying that other political parties have always benefited from government largesse.

 The CPM, the BJP and the Telugu Desam Party got prime land sold to build their offices at subsidised rates during the previous N. Chandrababu Naidu regime. 

 The CPM got 2,000 square feet to build its party office ? the M. Basavapunniah Memorial Buildings in the RTC Cross Road. It also got 5,000 square feet in another part of the city to construct the Sundaraiah Vijnan Kendra.

 The NTR Memorial Trust, which is the Desam headquarters, is built over an acre of land in the posh Banjara Hills. It has a massive air-conditioned conference hall and a corporate complex above it, a garden and a services complex.

 The Naidu regime had also granted an acre to the BJP to build its state headquarters. 

 The well-furnished and air-conditioned complex with wooden fittings is now named Dr Shyam Prasad Mukherji Bhavan, said Venkaiah Naidu, a former BJP president who had picked up 25 per cent of the cost of the building.

 More recently, the Telengana Rashtra Samiti was allocated two acres, also in Banjara Hills. 

 The TRS is yet to complete its complex on the plot due to a public interest litigation that contends that the land is part of a lake.

 We are all public figures, elected by the people and serve the people. Such allocations are not a new thing. Chandrababu Naidu got prime land allotted to the TDP. We also gave land to the TRS, said Md Ali Shabbir, Andhra Pradesh information minister.

 Chief minister Reddy has also launched a scheme to benefit senior party men, prominent supporters and journalists. 

 About 50 acres of prime land in the city is earmarked for allotment.

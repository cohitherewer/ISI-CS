 Dragons business belly growls

 JEHANGIR S. POCHA 

 Beijing, Nov. 19: A China hungry for new markets and enhanced influence in Asia will undoubtedly push for deeper economic ties with India during President Hu Jintaos visit next week. 

 While Sino-Indian trade (the purchase of each others goods) is now worth about $20 billion, Sino-Indian investments (establishing businesses in each others countries) will be an abysmal $6 million this year. 

 Clearly there is an imbalance, said Sun Shihai, a professor of Asian Studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing. We need to correct this and have more open economic ties. If this happens, there is incredible potential, including big Chinese investments in India. 

 To this end, Beijing is pushing India to recognise it as a market economy under World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules, and begin discussions on the creation of a free trade agreement between both countries. 

 The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) has estimated that if the two countries trade freely, China could become Indias largest trading partner and bilateral trade could touch $50 billion by 2017. But New Delhi is not likely to bite, and the Chinese know this. 

 There is no concern about India in China but in India there is concern about China, said Sun. Some people are not comfortable with China becoming a big player in the Indian economy. 

 Part of New Delhis concern is that it is the junior player in the relationship. For example, while China is Indias second-largest trading partner, India is Chinas 11th largest trading partner. 

 More significantly, 90 per cent of Chinas imports from India are cheap raw materials bought in bulk, such as iron ore, chemicals and plastics. On the other hand, Beijing must be happy to see that about 35 per cent of its exports to India are high-value products, such as electronics and machinery, according to the CII. 

 This has led to cries of Chinese mercantilism from some Indian boardrooms, which fear their more efficient and often secretly subsidised Chinese competitors will flood the Indian market with cheap products.

 India suffers from a $2-billion trade deficit with China. Some economists are warning this figure could leap to $10 billion if tariffs against imports are dropped. 

 On the investment front, things look even bleaker. 

 Indian companies have invested around $200 million in China since 1996 and have been welcomed. But Chinese firms, who invested only about $60 million in India during the same period, have faced discrimination, Sun said. 

 Over the past year, three major Chinese firms that won open bids in India have had their contracts cancelled on security grounds. The companies are CIMC Tianda, which was to have been part of a project to modernise several airports, Huawei Technologies, which was selected to supply switching gear to the state-owned BSNL, and the Hong Kong-based Hutchison Port Holdings, which was barred from participating in a $250-million contract to expand Mumbais port. 

 Raj Mishra, managing director of Orind Refractories, Ltd in Beijing, the largest Indian company in China with annual revenues of about $75 million, said consumers would benefit if these grievances could be set aside. 

 Indian manufacturing companies can really benefit from coming to China, and Indias IT, pharmaceuticals, media and banking industries have great opportunities in the local market. Its especially good timing for Chinese companies to go to India, as their products are very relevant to Indian consumers. 

 But Jin Linbo, director of Asia Pacific Studies at the China Institute of Foreign Studies in Beijing, said even a magical solution to Chinas and Indias problems will not immediately increase investments. The fact is, Chinese dont have much knowledge and understanding of the Indian market, he said. 

 Hu schedule

 Hu will land in India on Monday evening and will be given a reception at the Rashtrapati Bhawan on Tuesday morning. He will hold talks with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh that day, adds our special correspondent in Delhi.

 GSLV report in a month

 New Delhi, July 14: Preliminary analysis of the Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle failure on Monday shows that propellant flow into one of its four strap-on motors was not controlled after lift-off and it failed to produce enough thrust, top space officials said.

 The Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) has set up a failure analysis committee to find out why the engine stopped delivering thrust. The committee is expected to analyse the performance of all subsystems on the GSLV-F02 flight and submit a report in 30 days.

 The analysis will rely on a colossal amount of digital data sent by hundreds of sensors embedded throughout the body of GSLV-F02 in its final moments, Isro officials said. These sensors pick up values of pressure levels, temperatures and forces, among other variables, from strategic points in the GSLV and send them to computers on the ground. Engineers are now sifting through this data to diagnose the sequence of events aboard the launch vehicle that doomed the flight.

 Within minutes of the failure, Isro engineers realised something was wrong ? one strap-on motor was not generating enough thrust. They say this is surprising because Isro has had an excellent history with strap-on motors, which use liquid propellants for extra thrust in the first stage of the GSLV.

 The liquid-fuelled strap-on motor is the Vikas engine that also provides thrust in the second stage of the GSLV and the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle, Isros proven workhorse. But the liquid-fuelled engine is rated for higher levels of thrust as a second stage engine than as a strap-on motor.

 Isro officials point out that with four strap-on motors on each GSLV, at least 12 motors have performed flawlessly during the earlier three successful flights of the GSLV.

 However, this is not the first time that the GSLV has had a problem with one of its strap-on motors. In its first attempt to launch the GSLV five years ago, Isro had experienced a strap-on motor failure.

 The strap-on motors are ignited four seconds before the core solid motor of the first stage begins to burn and the rocket lifts. During these four seconds, each of the four strap-on motors is expected to deliver at least 90 per cent thrust. Only then does a computer allow the ignition of the core solid motor. If the strap-on motors do not provide thrust, the computer aborts the lift-off.

 In its first launch attempt, one of the strap-on motors provided only 30 per cent of required thrust and the launch was aborted on the ground. Analysis showed that one of the plumb lines in the motor had a partial block. The defect was corrected, leading to the first successful GSLV flight on April 18, 2001.

 The successful lift-off of the fourth GSLV flight earlier this week implies that each of the four strap-on motors would have been functioning well at t-zero. Something happened within seconds after t-zero to cut thrust in one of the motors, an official said.

 The answer lies in the data relayed by the sensors on the rocket, he said. Unexpected deviations in the sensor readings will tell us why GSLV F02 failed to soar into space.

 Alls not clear yet in bird flu belt 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Not cocksure? 

 Mumbai, March 8: Health workers have culled hundreds of thousands of poultry and cleared tonnes of bird droppings from farms in Maharashtras Navapur, but state authorities are reluctant to formally declare the area free of bird flu.

 We can say we have almost finished the culling operations and the disposal of bird faeces and feed, but at least scientifically we cannot say it is 100 per cent bird-flu free, said state health director Prakash P. Doke. We will keep Navapur under vigilance for at least three months.

 The state administration, however, heaved a sigh of relief after 95 human samples sent to the Pune-based National Institute of Virology tested negative for avian influenza.

 Doctors and animal husbandry officials are still camping in Navapur, where the countrys first H5N1 cases were detected in chickens last month, to monitor any unusual bird deaths or traces of any symptoms of the influenza among the 59,000 population of the poultry town. I would put it this way that culling operations have been complete 99 per cent, but we have to be vigilant for any unusual bird deaths, Doke said.

 Only two patients have been kept under observation at the Navapur sub-district hospital. One had pneumonia symptoms, and the other person, part of the faeces disposal teams, was admitted after he reported fever.

 State animal husbandry commissioner Bijay Kumar, who is still in Navapur, said over 20 poultry farms out of the 52 have been sanitised.

 The rest would be complete in another two or three days. Our teams have disposed of nearly 5,000 tonnes of bird faeces, but we estimate that by the time we finish the operation, it would touch a figure of 8-9,000 tonnes, said Kumar.

 An estimated 7,000 tonnes of chicken feed ingredients at five poultry farms is yet to be disposed of. A crucial aspect of the surveillance operation, he added, would be to check if the virus is found in fresh bird populations in the region.

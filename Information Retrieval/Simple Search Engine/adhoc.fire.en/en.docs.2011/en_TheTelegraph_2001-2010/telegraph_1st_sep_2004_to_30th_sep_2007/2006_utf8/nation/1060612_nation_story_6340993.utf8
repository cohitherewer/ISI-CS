 Punjab records heroin rush

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Rahul: Nothing unusual?

 Chandigarh, June 11: The heroin reported to have been found in Rahul Mahajans blood might well have been routed through Punjab, police officials in the state who are battling with a spurt in narcotics smuggling say.

 Heroin seizures have increased in the state during the last one year. Nearly 200 kg of the drug has been confiscated. The drug is taken to Delhi on train or by road and then dispatched to other parts of the country and even destinations abroad, a police officer said.

 A special narcotics cell was set up by the police in December last year to fight attempts by drug dealers based in Pakistan and Afghanistan to push drugs into India.

 While the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) has seized 125 kg of heroin, the BSF has caught 35 kg of heroin along the 564-km Pakistan border in Punjab since April 2005. The rest was seized by the police. 

 We estimate that the seizure of heroin is less than 10 per cent of the total quantum that is being smuggled through this border as the Samba border in Jammu and Kashmir, the earlier route, has now been effectively sealed, a senior BSF official said.

 With consumption of heroin in the state thought to be negligible, the police and other security agencies are concerned about the growing perception of Punjab being a safe state among smugglers.

 Smuggling has been an old profession in Punjab. Earlier, it was liquor and gold. Smugglers turned to arms during the terrorism era. It is narcotics now, an officer said. 

 We have information that consignments are sometimes even thrown across the fence, buried in fields and retrieved at a later date by couriers who are informed on the telephone or the Internet. Unfortunately, only couriers have been arrested. There is no information on the druglords on both sides of the border despite intense interrogation of the couriers, he said.

 All that the couriers have revealed is that the drugs are being pushed as the youth now have much more money to squander as a result of the IT revolution, the officer said.

 According to sources in the NCB, heroin is being smuggled across the border in quantities of three to five kg or less, to make it easier to hide. 

 Once the contraband reaches Amritsar or Ferozepur, the consignment is sent to Ludhiana, Jalandhar and Chandigarh on way to Delhi, where it is collected, sold, disbursed to the other metros or sent abroad.

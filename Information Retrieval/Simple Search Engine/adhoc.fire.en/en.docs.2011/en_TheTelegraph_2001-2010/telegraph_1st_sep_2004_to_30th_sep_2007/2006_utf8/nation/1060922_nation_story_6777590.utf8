 Puja back-off

 Calcutta, Sept. 21: After Subhas Chakraborty created a flutter by offering puja at Tarapeeth temple and laying bare his Hindu credentials, the CPM leadership is taking no chances in the run-up to the Durga Puja festivities, says a staff reporter.

 Left Front chariman Biman Bose has reportedly asked land and land reforms minister Abdur Rezzak Molla to stay away from the inauguration of a puja in his district.

 The CPM leader from South 24-Parganas was scheduled to open a puja of Unnati thakur (goddess of progress) at Baruipur on September 24 but reportedly backed out after being refused permission by Bose. The puja is the brainchild of Baruipur zonal committee secretary and former MLA Hemen Majumdar.

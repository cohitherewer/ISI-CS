 Airline fined for denying travel

 New Delhi (PTI): A consumer court has asked Gulf Air to cough up Rs 26,000 as damages and also refund air fares to two passengers for forcing them to travel by another airliner despite having valid tickets.

 The court rejected the airliners contention that entry was denied because the passengers did not possess visas of various countries where the plane stopped during the journey. 

 As is apparent, the stand taken by the appellant that there was problem of visa is an afterthought to cover up its deficiency as the complainants had already undertaken a break journey with the same airliner while going to London, it said.

 At the London airport, complainants Santosh and Kanwar Singh were not permitted to board the flight. Later, they had to travel in a British Airways plane by shelling out Rs 64,000 extra.

 The consumer forum held Gulf Air guilty of deficiency of service and asked it to compensate the complainants by paying them the British Airways air fare and Rs 26,000 as damages.

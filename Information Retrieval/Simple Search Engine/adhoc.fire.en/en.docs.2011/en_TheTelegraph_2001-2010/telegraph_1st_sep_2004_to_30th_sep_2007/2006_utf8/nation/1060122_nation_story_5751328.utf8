 Cops eye ISO badge

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Jan. 21: Extortion and rape may be on the upswing in Mumbai but the metros lawkeepers want to go in for a makeover of sorts.

 Mumbai police are planning to apply for an ISO 9001:2000 certification for all its 83 police stations so that they can be brought on a par with international standards.

 Police chief Anami Roy said on Friday this would make his force the first in the country to get an ISO certification. Hyderabad police have acquired ISO certification for some units but this would be the first time this would be done on such a large scale. Our central control room already has been certified.

 The police have taken the lead in installing two key systems ? Geographical Information System (GIS) and Global Positioning System (GPS) ? which would cut down the response time for SOS calls.

 The GIS is likely to be launched by end January and GPS by end March, Roy said.

 The department has also created an interface with the public by revamping its website www.mumbaipolice.org, which provides for online redress of complaints.

 In spite of the modernisation initiatives, the city has recorded a spate of rapes in the past five years (see chart). Prominent among them was the daylight rape of a 17-year-old student by a drunk constable at a police post on Marine Drive in April 2005.

 Conceding this incident was a blot on the police, Roy said: We found that in 79 per cent of the rape cases reported, the victim and the accused knew each other.

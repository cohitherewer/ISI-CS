 Calcutta, April 11: The owner of a nursing home and a local committee member of the CPM in Howrah district, Subid Mullick, was shot dead by a group of youths at Sonarpur on the southern fringes of the city last night, apparently for protesting against a flesh-trade racket. 

 At least four bullets pierced the right side of the 55-year-olds head, abdomen, forehead and right arm. Police said the assailants fired at least 10 shots.

 Mullick was taken to the Baruipur sub-divisional hospital where he was declared dead.

 Preliminary investigations revealed Mullick had become the target of two persons in the Bagnan area of Howrah who ran a sex racket. 

 The police said the two had brought over some girls from Mumbai and wanted to sell them off here. Mullick came to know about this and threatened to expose them.

 We think this is the reason for the murder. We suspect they had hired the killers. We sent a police team to their houses but the two persons are absconding, South 24-Parganas superintendent of police S.N. Gupta said. An unidentified person has been detained.

 Mullick, a practitioner of alternative medicine, was better known as daktarbabu in Sonarpur-Baruipur area. He owned a small nursing home in a rented house at Panchghara in Baruipur, where he stayed with one of his sons. The other members of his family live in Chitnan in Joypur of Howrah district.

 Last night, Mullick was murdered while he was returning to his Panchghara home from Howrah. After boarding a rickshaw from Subhasgram station, he was proceeding to his home two km away when a taxi intercepted him. 

 It was around 11.42 pm, and daktarbabu was travelling in my rickshaw, said Mohammad Moinuddin. Three revolver-wielding youths got out of the taxi, grabbed Mullick and forced him to get down, he added. 

 I somehow managed to escape and hid behind a bush. I heard the sound of at least 10 rounds. After the criminals left the place, I came out and found daktarbabu lying in a pool of blood. He was still gasping, Moinuddin said.

 A police officer said the youths had gone to the nursing home to enquire about him. They told the nursing home employees that they had come with a patient. They left behind a fictitious address, the officer said.

 Questioning the taxi driver who was traced today, the police have come to know that the vehicle was hired from Sealdah. They tied the drivers hands, gagged him and kept him on the rear seat. The assailants let the taxi driver go with his vehicle after they reached Manicktala, an officer said.

 The Howrah CPM, however, blamed the Congress for the murder, which denied the charge.

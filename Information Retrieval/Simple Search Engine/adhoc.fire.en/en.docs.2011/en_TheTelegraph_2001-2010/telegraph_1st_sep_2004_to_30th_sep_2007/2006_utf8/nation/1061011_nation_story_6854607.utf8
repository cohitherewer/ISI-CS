 New Delhi, Oct. 10: The CBIs cases against former defence minister George Fernandes and former navy chief Sushil Kumar come just as the defence ministry headed by Pranab Mukherjee is preparing for big-ticket acquisitions. 

 Together with Ved Malik, who headed the army and A.Y. Tipnis, the then head of the air force, Admiral Kumar made up the trio of generals who led India in its last war. 

 Through last week, Malik and Tipnis have been caught in an unseemly controversy on the efficacy of each others force in the war. But that is at least at the level of a professional debate. Kumar and the war minister of 1999, George Fernandes, are practically being accused of having their hands in the till. 

 This raises the question what did the Kargil war do for the Indian military? Or did it undo more?

 Last April, after the defence ministry referred the cases to the CBI, Mukherjee had said there would be no witchhunt on defence deals struck during the NDA regime. 

 The cases made public by the CBI today are on deals struck (except for Denels anti-materiel rifle that was nipped in the bud) in the desperation for acquisitions after the 1999 Kargil war when the services were showing poor inventories.

 The politics of the cases registered by CBI today threatens to push the clock back of bureaucrats and serving officers to the time when military acquisitions were tardy. This happens, too, at a time when the top brass such as Air Chief Marshal S.P. Tyagi are pointing to depleting force levels. 

 The former chief of naval staff, Admiral Kumar, had fallen off the radar of Delhis substantially large community of military experts and strategic analysts. The case now brings him back into focus. Within the services, the top brass would point to him and say such a fate can befall somebody who dares to take decisions.

 But Mukherjee is claiming that he has knocked the defence procurement system into shape and has made it more transparent. Few defence deals anywhere in the developing world are transparent, such is the nature of the business in which tactical requirements have to be kept secret. 

 In addition, almost every transaction with Israel is carried out behind an opaque screen. In the last four years, Israel has emerged as the second largest supplier of military hardware to India. Apart from the Barak, India has procured or is procuring pilotless spy aircraft, ammunition, electronic surveillance systems, the Phalcon AWACs and a missile defence system. Yet, there is almost zero information on military relations with Israel that is put out in the public domain.

 There is another equally important feature that the case brings out. And that is the lack of indigenous military capability. The Barak missile system was procured because the navy said the indigenous Trishul anti-missile missile was not up to the mark. 

 Kumar is alleged to have overriden the anxiety of the Defence Research and Development Organisation.

 But the services are always saying that the DRDOs equipment rarely meet their capability requirements. In the absence of cheaper alternatives at home, it gets easier to point to equipment available abroad in times of real or imagined emergency, as after Kargil.

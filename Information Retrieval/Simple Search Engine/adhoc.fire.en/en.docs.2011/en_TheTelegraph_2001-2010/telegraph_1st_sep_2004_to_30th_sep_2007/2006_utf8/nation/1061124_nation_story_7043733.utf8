 House relief for traffic victims

 New Delhi (PTI): A parliamentary committee 

 has agreed in principle to remove the provision under which 

 victims of prostitution can be arrested and recommended 

 that action be taken against pimps, procurers and agents 

 involved in soliciting.

 In a comprehensive report presented to Parliament, the standing committee on human resource and development took note of the observation made by the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) on the misuse of Section 8 of the Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act.

 The NHRC said a study had brought out several distortions in law enforcement. A person who was made to solicit under coercion, duress, threat, etc. could not be charged with the offence of soliciting.... A victim of trafficking should not be arrested at all. This calls for sensitivity and accountability of all concerned, the report said.

 The committee also recommended 10 years rigorous imprisonment for those trafficking in children, noting that they deserve the maximum punishment. 

 SC seal on scientist sack

 New Delhi (PTI): The Supreme Court 

 has upheld the Bhabha Atomic Research Centres decision 

 to compulsorily retire a scientist who abstained from duty 

 for over two years without authorised leave.

 The court deplored the orders of the Central Administrative Tribunal and Kerala High Court to reinstate scientist George Philip. 

 Philip, working as scientific officer in Barc, was granted a two-year extraordinary leave in February 1982 for a scholarship programme in Canada. The government took an undertaking from Philip that he would not register for any PhD programme or extend the leave. But he did just that and returned four years later, when he was compulsorily retired.

 Girl set ablaze

 Hoshangabad (PTI): A Dalit girl was allegedly burnt to death by a youth at a village near this Madhya Pradesh town after she refused to withdraw a complaint of rape against him. 

 The 16-year-old was asleep at home when Chhote Singh Rajput poured kerosene on her and set her on fire. 

 NHRC chief

 New Delhi: Justice Shivaraj 

 V. Patil, former Supreme Court judge and a member of the 

 National Human Rights Commission, has been appointed the 

 acting chairperson of the panel. 

 Shah Rukh

 Mumbai (PTI): The income-tax 

 department on Thursday carried out a survey of the office 

 of Shah Rukh Khans company, Red Chillies Entertainment, 

 in suburban Bandra to check if norms relating to tax deduction 

 at source have been followed. The operation was to continue 

 till midnight.

 The central government will spend about Rs 40 crore to give the surroundings of the Taj Mahal a modern look, tourism minister Ambika Soni has said.

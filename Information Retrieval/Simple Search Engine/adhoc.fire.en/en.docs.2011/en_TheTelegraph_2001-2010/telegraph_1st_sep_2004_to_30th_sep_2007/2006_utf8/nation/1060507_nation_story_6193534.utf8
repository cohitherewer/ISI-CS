 Mercury goes up, north India dives indoors

 New Delhi, May 6: Khajuraho sizzled and it was scorching further north. In fact, so hot it was that it left young lovers cold.

 Couples, looking for quiet spots in the capitals parks, had nowhere to go as a heat wave gripped central and northern India.

 Day temperatures crossed 44 degrees Celsius in Rajasthan, south Haryana, north Punjab and western Uttar Pradesh and hovered between 42 and 44 degrees elsewhere in these states.

 In Khajuraho, Madhya Pradesh, it was 43 degrees Celsius.

 Weather scientists predicted an even hotter tomorrow. The temperatures are likely to increase by 2 degrees over the next two days, they said. 

 As the heat wave swept across Delhi, the patches of green in Lodhi Gardens, Nehru Park, Buddha Jayanti Park and the India Gate lawns ? favourite haunts of lovers, tourists and tired workers ? were deserted.

 With the Palam weather station in Delhi recording 44.5 degrees, those who could stayed indoors or sought shelter in air-conditioned restaurants. 

 Many roadside ice-cream vendors who enjoy brisk business during summers also chose to stay off the streets during most of the day. 

 But restaurants serving beer were besieged by customers. The demand for ice-cold beer goes up in summers. Weve been full since 11 this morning and were going to get lots of thirsty people all through the evening, said the manager of a restaurant in Connaught Circus.

 The heat got to former foreign minister K. Natwar Singh as well. He had to cut short a speech in Deeg, Rajasthan, after he suffered symptoms of a minor heat stroke. Singh was admitted to a hospital where he was advised rest.

 The heat did not spare tourist towns either. Tourism activity is close to nil nowadays, the manager of a Khajuraho hotel said.

 Sometimes, we do get Spanish and Italian tourists around this time of the year, but not this year. Perhaps because of the upcoming World Cup, he said.

 Scientists have attributed the heat wave to the absence of a western disturbance ? wind patterns that transport the relatively cool air from beyond the tropical zone into the subcontinent. 

 We havent had a western disturbance since May 4, said Akhilesh Gupta, a scientist at the National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting that predicts weather five days in advance.

 During the month of May, the sun is right overhead in central India, Gupta said. Its another factor that contributes to the intense heat.

 Although a weak western disturbance centred over Iran today is expected to reach India within two days, its too weak to significantly lower the temperatures, he added. Under its influence, there may be isolated thunderstorms. 

 Eastern India is under the spell of the western disturbance of May 4 that is now anchored close to Bengal and is likely to contribute to rains and thundershowers at many places in the Northeast and a few places in Bengal and Sikkim.

 U-turn on power 

 The Delhi government has withdrawn its guidelines on stopping power supply to markets and industrial areas in the evening within 24 hours.

 Under the guidelines, power supply to industries and markets was to be stopped from 6.30 pm and 7.30 pm, respectively. The government said the advisory guidelines were withdrawn following the increase in the inflow of power to Delhi.

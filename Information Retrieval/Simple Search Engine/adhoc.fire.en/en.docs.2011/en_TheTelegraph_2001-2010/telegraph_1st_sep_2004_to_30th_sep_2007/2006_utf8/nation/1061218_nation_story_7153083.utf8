 Jamaat in modern family campaign

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 New Delhi, Dec. 17: At a gathering of a thousand Muslim men in Guwahati in the first week of December, they were asked how many had paid mehr to their wives. Barely two hands were raised. I said you people are nothing but chor (thieves). They hung their heads in shame, said N.K. Asandi, the Delhi-based public relations coordinator of the Jamaat-e-Islami Hind.

 Mehr are the gifts, inclu-ding money, given to the bride by the groom as part of the wedding contract, which acts as a safety net for the woman.

 A couple of days later, at a similar congregation in Silchar, the men were asked to say truthfully how many of them had given equal inheritance rights to their daughters in accordance with the Sharia. Not one hand was raised, Asandi said. 

 The current debate on stereotyping Muslims as terrorists, fundamentalists and inward-looking has led to introspection at various levels of the community, according to S.Q.R. Ilyas, a member of both the Jamaats central advisory committee and the All India Muslim Personal Law Board. 

 Muslims should realise that if they are not practising Islam and the value system in its true spirit, we will be targeted, he said. 

 Ilyas clarified that this outlook was not to take Muslims back to basics but rather to adapt Islam to the modern context.

 A Jamaat member said, off the record, that the organisation was also looking at allowing the community to reform itself from within rather than act under extraneous pressures.

 This is why the Jamaat organised a 10-day Islami family campaign across the country from December 1 to 10. We took a conscious decision not to involve the maulvis and ulemas in a big way because they have compromised the communitys interests all along, said Asandi. 

 The clerics were invited, but they were treated to a few home truths such as to keep away from solving personal problems relating to marriages and divorce, Asandi added. 

 The message to the clerics was to use the Friday prayers to create public awareness of Islamic teachings on social and family issues. 

 According to Ilyas, one of the big fallouts of the campaign was the decision to set up counselling centres for discussing marital problems. 

 The traditional way is to engage senior members from the families of the husband and wife, and make them sit together and take a decision on behalf of the couple. But this doesnt help. 

 A better way is to involve the couple directly and for this, professional counsellors are best suited rather than family members or persons known to them, he said.

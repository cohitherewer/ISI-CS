 Poll fund on cabinet table

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 20: The state funding of elections ? at least partial ? might soon see the light of day.

 The law ministry is awaiting the response of the Election Commission to proposals in this regard, after which the cabinet will take up the matter.

 The government is keen on partially providing funding for elections in kind, law and justice minister H.R. Bhardwaj told the Rajya Sabha during question hour today.

 The statement comes a few days after the poll panel called an all-party meeting to discuss the proposals for state funding of elections.

 The Centre, in a bid to curb money power in elections, had asked the commission for advice. 

 When CPM leader Nilotpal Basu asked why helicopter and jet expenses for electioneering were excluded from the ceiling on poll costs, Bhardwaj said this was the recommendation of the Indrajit Committee report and was necessary for security reasons.

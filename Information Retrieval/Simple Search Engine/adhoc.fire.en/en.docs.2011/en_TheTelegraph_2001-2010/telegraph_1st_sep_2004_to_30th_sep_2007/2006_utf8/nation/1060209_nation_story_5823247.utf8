 Drink blow to executive 

 - Hit-and-run test finds high level of alcohol

 Chatterjee: A swig too many

 Mumbai, Feb. 8: Standard Chartered Bank vice-president Neel Chatterjee was today slapped with a fresh charge of drunk driving after a blood test confirmed he was heavily under the influence of alcohol when his Mercedes ran over a watchman last Saturday.

 Mumbai police, however, ruled out re-arresting Chatterjee who was released on bail the day after.

 Deputy commissioner, Zone V, Rajesh Kumar Mor confirmed that the test showed 130 mg of alcohol in his blood, much higher than the permissible limit. 

 According to police regulations, if the alcohol content is higher than 30 mg per 100 ml of blood, a motorist is liable for a drunk driving charge.

 Chatterjee, who manages corporate communications for the bank, knocked down the 60-year-old temple watchman while trying to cross the busy Cadell Road that night and sped away before a police squad intercepted his black Mercedes.

 The watchman succumbed to head injuries leading to the bankers arrest on charges of rash and negligent driving causing death, misbehaving with the police, not reporting the accident and not stopping to help the victim.

 Senior police sources ruled out applying the more stringent Section 304 A (II) for culpable homicide not amounting to murder. 

 After what happened in the Salman (Khan) case, we find 304 A Part II legally untenable. It is difficult to prove in court. Hence we have not applied it in any other case, a police officer said.

 The non-bailable offence was registered against the actor in the 2002 hit-and-run case but the charge was dropped after a long legal battle.

 Inspector Suhas Raikar, who is investigating Saturday nights case, told The Telegraph: Today, we have added the drunk driving Section 185 of the Motor Vehicle Act after the blood test report arrived. In his initial statement, Chatterjee had told us he had been drinking since Saturday afternoon at his Worli home and was driving towards the western suburbs to meet some friends for dinner.

 Chatterjee now claims he does not recall knocking down any person that night. 

 His lawyer Vijay Trivedi said: The Motor Vehicle Act section is okay, but the police cannot now add any other substantial charge against my client. He maintains that he did not run over anybody on Saturday night.

 Nephew caught in tug-of-war

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Ahmedabad, March 11: Zahira Sheikhs widowed sister-in-law Heena has threatened to file a police case against her in-laws to seek the custody of her four-year-old son Samir.

 Nafitullah, Zahiras elder brother, died on March 3 in a Mumbai hospital where he was undergoing treatment for septicaemia. 

 Heena says she was not informed of his death even though she had called up her mother-in-law Shehrunnisa, living in Mumbai with daughters Zahira and Sahira, the same day. She learnt about it from the newspapers.

 When Nafitullah fell ill and was admitted to the local Bhailal Amin hospital for treatment, Samir was taken to the hospital on the pretext that his father wanted to see him, Heena said.

 Even after he was discharged from the hospital and moved to Mumbai for treatment, the family did not send Samir back, she added, threatening to file an FIR.

 But Vadodara police commissioner Deepak Swaroop said: We cannot ask Heenas mother-in-law to hand over the child. It is a civil matter. The court will deal with it.

 Heena, who was Nafitullahs second wife, had been living at Best Bakery for about a year with her husband. A tribal, she converted to Islam and changed her name from Kailash Vasava to Heena after the marriage. This was few weeks before the Best Bakery carnage in 2002. 

 Now, she lives in poverty but is determined to fight for her sons custody and her right to stay on at the bakery. 

 The Best Bakery property was transferred to Nafitullahs name by his mother. So now I am the legal heir of the property and nobody can force me to vacate it, said Heena, who has rented out a part of the building to two families.

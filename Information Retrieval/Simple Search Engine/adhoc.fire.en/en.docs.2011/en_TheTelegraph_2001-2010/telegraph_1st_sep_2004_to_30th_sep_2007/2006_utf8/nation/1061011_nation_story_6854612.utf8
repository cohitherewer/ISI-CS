 Congress smug, Pranab safe

 New Delhi, Oct. 10: On April 4, 2005, when the UPA gave what was perceived as a clean chit to George Fernandes in the Kargil coffin scam, there was dismay in its ranks. 

 The Congress-led coalition virtually shot down one of its primary weapons in campaign 2004 Sonia Gandhi had seized the corruption charge against the former defence minister with alacrity and made it an issue.

 Fernandess successor Pranab Mukherjee, wittingly or unwittingly, became the fall guy after law minister H.R. Bhardwaj told a channel on April 10: We had drafted our affidavit and sent it to the defence ministry through the attorney-general. There it was changed before it was filed in court.

 Mukherjee tried to cover his tracks by stating there was no question of giving a clean chit to any person, much less Fernandes, and a supplementary affidavit would be filed to clarify a number of points. But his defence reportedly cut no ice with Sonia or the Congress.

 Today, when the CBI named Fernandes in its FIR on the Barak surface-to-air missile purchase, the Congress smiled benignly because it felt he had got his comeuppance.

 For the record, Janardhan Dwivedi, general secretary in charge of the AICCs media cell, said: The law enforcement agencies are doing their work. As a political party, we do not wish to comment on it. He added that Fernandes was not a factor for the Congress any longer.

 While sources acknowledged that Fernandes was a spent force with virtually no party, constituency or ideological credibility, they sounded smug that after the coffin fiasco, the Janata Dal (United) leader had at last been fixed.

 The sources said the Barak episode gave Mukherjee the much-needed chance to re-establish his credentials with Sonia. Although the CBI handled the investigation, it could not have proceeded without the defence ministrys support and inputs, they claimed. 

 The sources claimed his detractors in the Congress could find it harder to shore up their case for shifting him from the defence to the foreign ministry.

 In the past week, there was speculation that Mukherjee, who was reluctant to become foreign minister because he would have to report directly to the Prime Minister, more so until the nuclear deal was clinched, had agreed to accept the portfolio.

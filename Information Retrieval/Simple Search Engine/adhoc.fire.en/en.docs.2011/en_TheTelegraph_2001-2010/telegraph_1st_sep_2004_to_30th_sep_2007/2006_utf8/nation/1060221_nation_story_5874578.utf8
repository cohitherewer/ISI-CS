 Vaiko stubs out quit whispers

 Vaiko: No exit

 Chennai, Feb. 20: Vaiko today ended speculation on his switchover to the Jayalalithaa camp by vowing to strengthen and lead the DMK-led alliance to victory in the elections.

 The MDMK chiefs three-page statement came just after the DMKs criticism of Vaikos party, which is a constituent in the Democratic Progressive Alliance (DPA).

 The DMKs statement last night said pretending to be part of the DPA and yet trying to bargain with the opposite camp was not honest politics.

 Reports from inside the MDMK, however, hint that Vaiko faced intense pressure from some colleagues to not go with the Jayalalithaa-led ruling ADMK. Vaiko had been beaming quit signals for about a week to DMK chief M. Karunanidhi.

 In todays statement, Vaiko said he regretted propaganda secretary Nanjil Sampaths intemperate remarks against the DMK and Karunanidhi.

 But he said that even at his recent news conference in Delhi he had maintained that the party continued to be part of the DMK-led alliance.

 In the last 12 years since the MDMKs inception, we have paid a very heavy price for upholding certain basic norms of political decency and integrity. Even in the run-up to the 2001 Assembly elections, though we had to snap ties with the DMK in the eleventh hour, we still fought that election alone and did not align with the opposite front (led by ADMK) just for winning a few seats in the Assembly, Vaiko said.

 He said he was taking time over finalising the list of seats and the number of constituencies to contest as he was still consulting colleagues. But it was painful that the DMK sought to force the issue when the MDMK felt that it could take some more time to finalise its list, Vaiko added. 

 The partys main complaint against the DMK is over its big brother attitude in seat-sharing arrangements.

 Karunanidhi welcomed Vaikos decision. I am very happy and this is what I expected of him, he said.

 Seat-sharing talks would resume after a few days, the DMK chief said.

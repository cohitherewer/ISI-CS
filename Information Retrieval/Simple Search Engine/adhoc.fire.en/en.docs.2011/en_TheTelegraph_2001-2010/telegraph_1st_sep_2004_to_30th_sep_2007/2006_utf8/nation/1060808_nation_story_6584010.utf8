 Iraq amnesia for Cong

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 7: The Pathak committee, which gave a clean chit to the Congress in the oil-for-food scam, has noted that partymen who were part of the delegation to Baghdad in 2001 were not forthcoming on what transpired there.

 The inquiry authority said the delegates who went to express solidarity with sanctions-hit Iraqis did not answer whether any report on the visit had been submitted to the Congress president who had approved the trip.

 The replies were either that they did not know or that it could have been prepared, said the Justice R.S. Pathak-headed probe panel, which submitted its report to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh last week.

 The committee noted that in the absence of documentary proof, it had to fall back upon the oral testimony of six persons who were in Baghdad at that time, including former foreign minister Natwar Singhs son Jagat and his cousin Andaleeb Sehgal who had joined the delegation.

 The report by the authority, however, does not clarify whether Moti Lal Vora, who appeared before the panel as a treasurer of the Congress, was asked about the existence of a report on the visit.

 Clearing the party, Vora had merely told the committee that the letters written by Natwar to Iraqi oil minister Amer Mohammed Rasheed was not official but for a personal purpose.

 It is apparently that Shri Natwar Singh tried to project himself as speaking for the entire Congress party while in fact he was addressing a personal request to the Iraqi government, the report said.

 Besides Vora, Natwar, Jagat, Sehgal and friend Aditya Khanna, the list of those who deposed before the authority include Aneil Mathrani, A.R. Antulay, P. Shiv Shankar and Randeep Singh Surjewala.

 Jagat, who joined the delegation later, tried to justify his presence as a representative of the Youth Congress. But then Youth Congress chief Surjewala said he had not authorised Jagat to go to Iraq as a representative of the wing.

 Jagat later presented a letter signed by Surjewala to support his claims. Though the letter was addressed to whom it may concern, the last line read: We look forward to the day the sanctions against your great nation are lifted.

 The authority noted that the one country that could have been intended was Iraq. There is nothing to show that any other country was under a sanctions regime, the panel said, taking note of the letter.

 About the evasive replies by members of the delegation, the report pointed out that the then secretary of the external affairs department, Mathrani, who was part of the delegation, did not seem to recall many of the incidents relating to the visit.

 The report also said Mathrani tried to distance himself entirely from the delegation.

 Mathrani, who was secretary of a department then headed by Natwar, even told the authority that he did not know Natwar closely.

 On being shown documents that proved that he had organised the visit, Mathrani, a former ambassador to Croatia, said he did not recall anything.

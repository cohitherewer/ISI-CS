 IT, widows to get property tax relief

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, 

 Nov. 27: Infotech companies and people facing excessive 

 hardships will be given some relief when an area-based 

 property tax regimen is introduced in Calcutta.

 Widows, deserted women, senior citizens and physically challenged house-owners can apply for a breather when the new format that is expected to raise taxes comes into being.

 Property owners who are facing excessive hardships would get exemptions, remissions, reductions for a year if recommended by a committee to be constituted by the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, according to amendments to a bill that will be tabled in the Bengal Assembly tomorrow.

 The recommendation will have to be cleared by the mayor-in-council, which governs the corporation.

 Information technology companies will be among the biggest beneficiaries of the exemptions.

 The mayor-in-council will be empowered to exempt IT (only software programming and development) companies and IT-enabled services like call centres from property tax to the extent of 50 per cent of annual tax for the first six years.

 However, the relief will be given only when at least 50 per cent of the covered area in a building or premises is exclusively used for IT-ITES industries.

 Incorporating some of the changes suggested by the Assembly select committee, the government will introduce a reworked corporation amendment bill in the House.

 Instead of assessing property tax on the basis of actual or projected annual rent as it is done now, the new regime will determine tax based on base area unit value to be decided by the municipal valuation committee.

 According to the new formula, every CMC ward will be divided into different blocks. Every square foot in a particular block will have a uniform tax rate. But the tax rate will differ from block to block.

 Urban development and municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya, who headed the select committee, described the new tax regime as scientific and realistic.

 He said the division of municipal wards into tax-blocks would mean differentiating slums and lower-middle class areas from affluent localities. 

 But Trinamul Congresss Partha Chatterjee and SUCIs Debaprasad Sarkar recorded notes of dissent in the select committee report, complaining that the new regime would accelerate exodus of the poor and low-income residents from the city.

 They opposed another provision to tax vacant spaces, including water bodies, attached to building plots, saying such a measure would increase the tax burden.

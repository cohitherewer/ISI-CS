 IB stalls plan for visa on arrival

 GAUTAM DATT

 New Delhi, Oct. 12: The home ministry has again shelved a proposal to allow visa-on-arrival facility to attract foreign tourists after the move was resisted by intelligence agencies.

 The tourism ministry, backed by the industry, had put pressure on the government to introduce the visa-on-arrival facility. The ministry had identified 16 countries for granting visas on arrival.

 The facility is seen as vital for the sector India stands to lose tourism revenue as other neighbouring countries are now coming up with an open visa regime.

 However, sources said, the Intelligence Bureau scuttled the proposal at a meeting held recently. Officials from the home and tourism ministries and the bureau attended the meeting, convened to discuss two proposals put forth by the tourism ministry.

 One of the suggestions was to allow 10-year visas for travellers from certain European countries. At present, India gives 10-year visas only to UK and US citizens. The other proposal was to issue visas on arrival to citizens of a select group of countries.

 Sources said both proposals were shot down by the Intelligence Bureau. The security establishment wants the 10-year visa facility to be given strictly on a reciprocal basis.

 They said if other countries agree to give 10-year visas to Indian citizens like the US and the UK, Delhi should extend the same facility. The tourism ministry was asked to wait for the other countries to make the move.

 The proposal of visa on arrival was put back in the cold storage after the Intelligence Bureau officials told the home ministry that it would pose a security threat. 

 It was suggested that existing visa procedures should be streamlined so that tourists do not face problems in travelling to India.

 Pakistan recently announced visas on arrival for a select group of countries. Sources said the Indian meeting was held before Pakistan made the announcement but the Intelligence Bureaus policy is unlikely to change, given the strong position it has taken.

 The sources said the bureau cited examples of other countries that have started limiting visa-on-arrival schemes.

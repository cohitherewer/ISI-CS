 GE wake-up call in spoilt rice noodles

 New Delhi, Sept. 6: A type of genetically engineered (GE) rice from China, unapproved for human consumption, has contaminated rice stick noodles and rice vermicelli sold in France, Germany and the UK, Greenpeace International has announced.

 The findings, based on tests in an accredited and independent laboratory, indicate that processed food products may be a source of unapproved and thus illegal GE rice contamination in other countries, the environmental group said.

 These findings are shocking and should trigger high-level responses, Jeremy Tager, Greenpeace GE rice campaigner, said. The GE rice, engineered for resistance to insects, has not been approved for commercial cultivation anywhere in the world.

 In a report released yesterday, Greenpeace said the GE rice was an experimental crop that appears to have made its way from Chinese scientists into the hands of Chinese farmers. We have unsubstantiated evidence, but no official documentation, to say that contamination resulted from the sale of experimental GE rice from Chinese scientists to farmers, Tager said. 

 Greenpeace said precise information about the genes inserted into the experimental rice crop is not known, though laboratory tests indicate it contains the protein known as Cry1Ac or possibly a fusion of Cry1Ab/Cry1Ac proteins.

 Three scientists from institutions in France and Norway have released a statement expressing concern over the contamination, cautioning the Cry1Ac protein has not been approved for human consumption in any food crop. There is concern over its potential allergenicity, they said.

 Greenpeace activists in India said the findings in Europe should be a wake-up call for India where regulatory mechanisms for GE crops are weaker than in Europe. The gene in the GE rice from China is similar to the gene in GE brinjal slated for field trials in India this year, said Divya Raghunandan, GE campaigner with Greenpeace India.

 Environmental groups in India have long claimed that farmers have often violated mandatory field trial guidelines. Earlier this year, activists had documented how one farmer in Andhra Pradesh cooked and ate GE okra (bhindi) on field trial on his farm and how some farmers sold GE cotton that they were expected to destroy.

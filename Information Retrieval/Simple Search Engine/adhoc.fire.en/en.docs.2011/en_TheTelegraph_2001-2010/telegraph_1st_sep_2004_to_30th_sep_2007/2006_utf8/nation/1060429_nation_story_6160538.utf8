 Muzaffarnagar 

 (PTI): Enraged at being denied a share of family property, 

 a 16-year-old boy allegedly beheaded his father on Thursday 

 and surrendered to 

 police.

 Ankur allegedly cut off the head 

 of Mahipal, 45, in Goela village of Muzaffarnagar district 

 as he was unhappy that his father had decided to hand over 

 the family land to his brother, said superintendent of police 

 G.N. Goswami.

 After killing his father, Ankur came to Shahpur police station and surrendered. He expressed no remorse about what he had done, the police officer added.

 The boy told police that he wanted justice for his family.

 As no one from the family came forward to lodge an FIR against Ankur, the village watchman wrote a complaint alleging that Mahipal was beheaded by his son, Goswami said.

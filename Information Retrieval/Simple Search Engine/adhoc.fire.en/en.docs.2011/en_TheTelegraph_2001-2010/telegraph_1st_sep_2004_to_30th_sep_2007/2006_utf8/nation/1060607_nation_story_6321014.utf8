 Term harsher for drug sellers

 New Delhi, June 6 (PTI): Delhi High Court has ruled that seizure of a 500 gm substance which contains a mere 5.1 per cent heroin will not invite stringent provisions of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act to convict a person for 10 years.

 The observation, at a time Rahul Mahajan is facing charges of drug abuse, came as Justice Badar Durrez Ahmed interpreted various provisions of the act and granted bail to one Mahesh Pal Singh, who was arrested for possessing heroin.

 Justice Ahmed observed that apart from the weight of the substance, it was necessary to examine the purity level of the heroin to conclude whether a person is involved in trading the material or was a buyer for self-consumption.

 Chemical analysis of the 500-gm material seized from the accused revealed that the substance contained 5.1 per cent of diacetylmorphine (heroin) following which the officials invoked Sections 21 and 37 of the act to seek his prosecution.

 Counsel for the accused argued that it was not the total weight of the substance allegedly seized that should be considered but the actual percentage of heroin content that determines if the accused possessed it for personal consumption or commercial purposes.

 Government counsel Pawan Sharma said it is the weight of the total material seized from the accused that should be taken into consideration.

 However, Justice Ahmed noted that the purity level of heroin available at retail stage was around 32 per cent and at the wholesale stage over 60 per cent. The low-purity level in the case of the material seized from Singh revealed that the substance had changed several hands before coming into the possession of the accused, which indicated that the accused might be a user, the judge added.

 Dawood kin in lock-up

 Dawood: Most-wanted family

 Mumbai, Feb. 16: Mumbai police have arrested Dawood Ibrahims nephew on extortion charges.

 Sameer Mohammed Gulab Wagle, the 32-year-old son of Dawoods late sister Sahira, was held in connection with a money settlement case on Wednesday morning, officers from Byculla police station said.

 Zaqi Khan had borrowed Rs 2.8 lakh from Sharafat Solkar, who runs a money-lending business, to purchase a chicken shop in south-central Mumbai, the police said. When Khan failed to pay up, Solkar approached Wagle, who was his friend. 

 Wagle, who runs the Garib Nawaz Travel Agency in Nagpada, threatened Khan, who paid Rs 1.25 lakh to Solkar, promising to give the rest of the amount later.

 When he did not, Solkar knocked on Wagles door again.

 On Sunday, Wagle summoned Khan and his younger brother Taqi to his house in Nagpada, where Solkar was present. Khan apologised and agreed to settle the payments. 

 He then joined Solkar, Wagle and three others for dinner at Banjara Hotel. 

 After dinner, around 11.30 pm, Solkar changed his mind and asked Khan to sign an ownership transfer document for the chicken shop. When Khan refused, the group locked him and his brother in separate rooms in the building where Wagle stays. But they did not realise that Taqi had a mobile phone, said deputy commissioner of police Santosh Rastogi.

 Taqi informed the police control room at Crawford Market around 3 am on Monday. The message was conveyed to Byculla police station, which sent a team to rescue the brothers. The police arrested Solkar and his associates, but Wagle gave them the slip. 

 He was traced on Wednesday morning.

 Asked if Wagle used the name of his dreaded uncle to do business, Rastogi said: No, he did not. But people in the Nagpada area are aware that he is Dawoods relative. We have arrested them on charges of issuing threats, wrongful confinement and extortion under several sections of the Indian Penal Code.

 The police said Wagles mother Sahira had committed suicide a few years ago in her native village, Ratnagiri, on the Konkan coast.

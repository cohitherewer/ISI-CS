 Pranab gets a raise, asks for more

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Cash-strapped?

 New Delhi, Feb. 28: Finance minister P. Chidambaram today earmarked Rs 89,000 crore in allocations for the military, a Rs 6,000-crore hike that defence minister Pranab Mukherjee described as modest but he immediately said there were hardly enough funds for new acquisitions.

 The increase in defence allocations is in contrast to the peace politics and peace diplomacy persuasions of the UPA government with tensions on the borders with Pakistan having run low for more than two years now and the dispute with China nearly frozen. But the governments position is that a strong military will be one of the pillars holding up its peace projects. 

 The armed forces, on the other hand, will have just enough in the 2006-2007 allocations to keep their machinery running but will have to ask for more to add to their arsenal.

 The defence minister has already sounded out the finance minister on a supplementary grant because he has worked out that barely Rs 1,000 crore will be available for new acquisitions despite the capital outlay for defence being increased by more than Rs 3,000 crore to Rs 37,458 crore.

 Mukherjee said that of the capital outlay, about Rs 29,990 crore would go for acquisitions. Most of this amount will be incurred in recurring payments for acquisitions already contracted in previous years like the aircraft carrier Admiral Gorshkov, the British Hawk Advanced Jet Trainers, Israeli Phalcon AWACs and the French Scorpene submarines.

 Mukherjee said the budgetary allocations for 2006-2007 were a 8.9 per cent hike over the revised estimates for 2005-2006. The revised estimates show that the defence ministry has spent Rs 81,700 crore of its Rs 83,000 crore allocation.

 I will have to go for a supplementary demand. I have already spoken to the finance minister about this because there will be hardly about Rs 1,000 crore for new acquisitions, Mukherjee said.

 Of the total defence allocations of Rs 89,000 crore, the defence minister said, 47.5 per cent will go to the army, 18.14 per cent to the navy, 28 per cent to the air force. Allocations for the Defence Research and Development Organisation at Rs 5,454 crore were about 6.13 per cent of the defence budget.

 Mukherjee said the finance ministry was insisting that 67 per cent of expenditure must be incurred by December. However, that was not possible in 2005-2006. But expenditure picked up in the first quarter of 2006. 

 Among the big-ticket items that the military establishment is looking to buy are multi role combat aircraft for the air force. The IAF had initially projected a need for 126 of this category of aircraft but that requirement is likely to be revised upwards and the force may even contemplate buying more than one type of aircraft. 

 Even in the initial projection, this purchase alone could cost about $ 8 billion. The defence allocations as they stand now do not account for this. But firming up the global tender and negotiating the deal could take as long as two years and the amount may be accounted for in subsequent budgets or through a supplementary budget.

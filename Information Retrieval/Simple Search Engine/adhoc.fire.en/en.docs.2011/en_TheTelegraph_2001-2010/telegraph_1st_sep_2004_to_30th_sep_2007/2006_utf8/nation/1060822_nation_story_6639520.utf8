 Frivolous PIL 

 New Delhi, Aug. 21: The Supreme Court today imposed a fine of Rs 10,000 on 10 people who had jointly filed a PIL seeking disqualification of Congress president Sonia Gandhi from Parliament on the ground that she owed allegiance to a foreign country, reports our legal correspondent.

 It is a frivolous petition, a bench headed by Chief Justice Y.K. Sabharwal said while dismissing the PIL by advocate Santosh Kumar Srivastava and nine others.

 The PIL contended that owning property in a foreign country amounted to owing allegiance to the country, which disqualified one from being amember of the House.

 The petitioners said Sonia had mentioned in her nomination papers that she had ancestral property worth Rs 13 lakh in Italy.

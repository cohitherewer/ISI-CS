 Sangh link singes BHU teachers

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, Nov. 24: Over 100 Banaras Hindu University (BHU) teachers have locked horns with Union HRD minister Arjun Singh after they were served a showcause notice for attending an RSS seminar in Varanasi.

 University sources said 116 teachers were asked to explain in two weeks why disciplinary action should not be taken against them. They are planning to contest the notice.

 The RSS had organised a seminar at Viswa Sanvad Kendra in Varanasi on cultural nationalism on November 11. A local newspaper reported that 116 BHU faculty members the university has more than 1,000 teachers had spoken at the meet.

 This morning, vice-chancellor P. Singh served notices to these teachers, quoting the reports. The notice said they had violated the Central Civil Service Conduct Rules of 1964. Under the present circumstances of the country, teachers of a central university are supposed to have a secular attitude, it added. 

 Professor Kaushal Kishore Mishra said he had received the notice. I am shocked to see how a prestigious university is being run by the dictates of one politician (Arjun). I am a free man and I have the right to attend any seminar on any subject of my choice. I cannot be slapped a notice because I did not attend the seminar during class hours. 

 Viswanath Pandey, the universitys PRO, confirmed the notices were sent. Serving notice does not mean taking action. We believe it is not in the best interest of the nation to fall in line with RSS theories. What will the teachers impart to the students if they show their bias?

 BJP leaders in Lucknow were quick to protest. It is not a crime to attend any RSS meet. It is highly condemnable the way the professors are being harassed, former chief minister Kalyan Singh said.

 Kerala offer spurned

 JOHN MARY

 Thiruvananthapuram, July 16: The Kerala governments offer of help for Malayali victims of the Mumbai blasts has drawn a sharp reaction from the Maharashtra government, which said it cannot discriminate on a regional basis.

 The Maharashtra chief secretary, D.K. Sankaran, who is a Malayali, replied to his Kerala counterpart Mohammed Riasuddins letter of help on Friday by politely turning down the offer.

 Chief minister V.S. Achuthanandan had announced an ex-gratia amount of Rs 50,000 for the next of kin of Keralites who died. He had also assured medical help to the rest of those who were injured in the blasts and had sent principal secretary, general administration, E.K. Bharat Bhushan, to Mumbai.

 According to sources, the Maharashtra government directed its officials not to let the Kerala official into Mantralaya, the state administrative headquarters, nor to offer him any assistance.

 Sankaran told a local TV channel this evening that he could not accept the Kerala gesture of extending relief on the basis of regional or other considerations.

 We do not differentiate between communities and have offered the best possible help to all the victims. The state turned down the offer of help from the Kerala government since it was only for people from Kerala who were affected by the blasts. We have given equal help to all and the state is capable of looking after every affected victim, he said.

 Bhushan, who is back from Mumbai, said: The whole controversy is unfortunate. I had gone there mainly to coordinate with the Non-Resident Keralite Affairs cell. I was on a fact-finding mission, and lending a hand of consolation to those traumatised by the tragedy. I stayed with a friend and shuttled from hospital to hospital, looking for the injured. Im fully satisfied with the cooperation from the Maharashtra officials.

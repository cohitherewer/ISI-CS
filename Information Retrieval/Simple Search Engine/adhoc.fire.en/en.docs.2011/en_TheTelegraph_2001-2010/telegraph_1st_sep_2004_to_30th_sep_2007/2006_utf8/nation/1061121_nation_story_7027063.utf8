 Salve on Mamata sulk

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mitra, Das Munshi 

 Calcutta, Nov. 20: The Bengal Congress began a damage-control exercise today, realising that Priya Ranjan Das Munshis insistence on fielding a candidate for the Islampur bypoll has put a spanner in its recent bonhomie with Mamata Banerjee.

 Leading the mission was former state party chief Somen Mitra, who is not often on the same side as the information and broadcasting minister. 

 Mitra prevailed on the legislature party to cooperate with the Trinamul Congress over a no-confidence motion against the Left Front. 

 Congress legislature party leader Manas Bhuniya accompanied leader of Opposition Partha Chatterjee and Trinamul chief whip Ashoke Deb to the Speakers chamber to serve the no-trust notice. 

 Thirty Congress and Trinamul MLAs will have to raise their hands in the Assembly tomorrow to get the motion admitted by the Speaker.

 The two parties together have 51 MLAs in the 294-member House.

 Somen and I had held several rounds of discussions with Manas to ensure that our MLAs collaborated with Trinamul. The unity in the Assembly will help consolidate our ties with Mamata, state Congress working president Pradip Bhattacharya said. 

 A Trinamul leader had yesterday said Mamata was hurt by the Congresss decision to contest the North Dinajpur seat, where her candidate and the CPMs are also in the fray. 

 Still angry, she today told a rally in Singur, about 40 km from Calcutta, that she would take on the CPM alone. 

 At the root of the trouble is apparently another no-confidence motion brought against the Congress chairman of the Islampur municipality by two Trinamul and four rebel Congress councillors.

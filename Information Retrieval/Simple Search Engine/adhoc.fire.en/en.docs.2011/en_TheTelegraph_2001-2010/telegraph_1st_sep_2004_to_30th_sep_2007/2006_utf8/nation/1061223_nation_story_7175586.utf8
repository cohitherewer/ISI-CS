 Joshi spices up PM row

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Joshi

Lucknow, Dec. 22: Murli Manohar Joshi today added some sound bites to the ongoing chorus on whether L.K. Advani is the BJPs Prime Minister-in-waiting.

 Although he refused to say anything directly about Advanis purported ambitions Advani had in a recent TV interview said that the leader of Opposition was traditionally the Prime Minister-in-waiting --- Joshi made his views clear.

 Atal Bihari Vajpayee has been the best Prime Minister ever. He enjoys this reputation not only in the BJP but across the political spectrum. He is clearly the most acceptable among the partys top leaders. He has magical qualities, Joshi said.

 Joshis remarks come barely a week after party chief Rajnath Singh declared that the BJP had two Prime Minister candidates Vajpayee and Advani. Rajnath himself has opted out of the race.

 Although most leaders shied away from responding to Joshis take on the controversy sparked by Advanis statement, some party insiders echoed him.

 So long as he (Vajpayee) is around, it is difficult to project another leader, said a journalist close to the BJP.

 Some leaders attributed Joshis outburst to the party ignoring him of late. He is no longer part of the BJPs biggest troika (Vajpayee/Advani/Joshi) nor is he anywhere to be seen on the posters and banners that have come up during the partys ongoing national executive and council meetings here.

 Even in the BJPs last national executive in Dehra Dun, Joshi had stormed out on the first day. He had then felt slighted by the party decision not to invite him for the public rally customarily held at the end of every executive. 

 Snigger though they may at Joshis statement, most leaders here cannot help discussing who the partys next Prime Minister candidate is. They are even talking about the protest letter Arun Jaitley sent to the TV channel that beamed Advanis interview.

 Jaitley had argued in the letter that Advanis statement had been twisted out of context and the press release sent out by the channel before the interview bore no relation to what he actually said.

 However, the dominant belief is that Advanis statement was a clear pointer to his hidden ambitions.

 What did Akbar tell Anarkali after she declared that she wanted to be princess for one day? a senior leader asked. That all this while this was your real ambition.

 Meaning, one cannot hide genuine desires. Joshis high praise for Vajpayee just after Advani had purportedly voiced his desire to be Prime Minister is also being perceived as an articulation of his own genuine desire for the top job.

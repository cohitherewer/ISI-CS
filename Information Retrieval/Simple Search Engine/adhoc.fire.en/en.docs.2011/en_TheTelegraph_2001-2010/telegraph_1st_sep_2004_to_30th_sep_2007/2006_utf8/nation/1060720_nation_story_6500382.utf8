 Gag on blogs gives bumbling India a bad name

 K.P. NAYAR

 Washington, July 19: Indias biggest asset in the Western world ? freedom of expression ? has been thrown into question by the inept handling of a ban on 17 Internet websites and blogs by the ministry of communications.

 Instead of blocking the 17 specific websites, which have allegedly been preaching messages of religious hatred in the wake of the July 11 Mumbai bombings, Internet Service Providers all over the country have simply blocked users from accessing internationally respected sites ? entire domains ? such as Googles Blogspot and Yahoos Geocities.

 These and several other similar domains, which host thousands of blogs or online web journals have been inaccessible to Indians since the weekend.

 Americans woke up this morning to reports in every major US newspaper and on television channels, dumping India along with Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, China and Ethiopia, which censor the Internet.

 The timing of the communications ministrys blunder could not have been worse. A campaign to project India as a paragon of democracy and free speech ? like America ? is at its height here in the run-up to a vote on the Indo-US nuclear deal in the Senate and the House of Representatives next week.

 The inept blocking of entire Internet domains enables Indias enemies here to question assumptions behind the projection of India as a free society. 

 A New York Times correspondent in New Delhi wrote in a dispatch published today: As Indias financial capital, Mumbai, observed a moment of silence today to commemorate the serial bombings of its commuter trains seven days ago, a blistering silence blanketed the Indian blogosphere?Indian bloggers have reacted with anger and confusion, accusing the government of censorship and demanding to know why their sites have been jammed.

 SiliconBeat, a website which is part of The Mercury News, one of the largest news and information outlets on Americas west coast (of which Silicon Valley is a part), reacted when reports first came in about the gag order by the communications ministry.

 We expressed doubt this could be the case, given that India is democratic, and not a Big Brother-like blog-filtering state like China. However, as we have followed events, and people have commented on our blog and directed us to the latest developments, things havent improved ? and we have confirmed only that this is the governments doing.

 Top bureaucrats in the communications ministry have compounded the ham-handed implementation of their order by bad public relations, leaving it to a single officer, Gulshan Rai, director of the ministrys computer emergency response team, to give confusing and often contradictory information to a barrage of queries from the international media.

 The US media reported that at least on one occasion, D.S. Mathur, the secretary for telecommunications, hung up on an American reporter seeking information for a story on the ban.

 Americans, concerned over what they see as Internet censorship by India, are looking for the minister of communications, Dayanidhi Maran, who is visiting San Francisco but has discreetly opted to keep a low profile in view of the controversy.

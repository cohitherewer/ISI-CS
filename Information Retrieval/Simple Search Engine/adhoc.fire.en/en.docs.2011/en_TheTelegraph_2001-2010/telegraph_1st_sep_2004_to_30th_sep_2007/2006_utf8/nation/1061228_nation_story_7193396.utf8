NATION BRIEFS

 Srinagar, Dec. 27: A decade after human rights lawyer Jaleel Andrabi was murdered, Jammu and Kashmir police have said his alleged killer is hiding in Canada. 

 Submitting a status report in the case for the first time before a chief judicial magistrate, the police said the CBI is seeking a red-corner notice to extradite Avatar Singh, a former major in the Territorial Army believed to be behind the lawyers death. 

 Andrabi disappeared on March 27, 1996, and his body was fished out of the river Jhelum 19 days later.

 Lucknow (PTI): The Lucknow University has expelled 38 students, including all office-bearers of the students union, after finding their replies to the suspension notices on campus violence unsatisfactory.

 Burdwan: Amartya Sen has said India is lagging behind developed countries in primary education. The primary education system needs to be revamped immediately, the Nobel laureate said in a seminar. We encourage students studying medical or engineering courses. But we often forget about our students in primary schools.

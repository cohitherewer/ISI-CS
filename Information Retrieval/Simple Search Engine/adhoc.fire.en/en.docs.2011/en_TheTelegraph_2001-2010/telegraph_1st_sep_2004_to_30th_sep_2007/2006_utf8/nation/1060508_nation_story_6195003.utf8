 Temple ban

 Varanasi, May 7 (PTI): Cellphones and cameras have been banned on the premises of Sankat Mochan temple, which was rocked by a terror attack two months ago.

 The decision was taken by the district administration last night at a meeting to review security measures at sensitive religious shrines, official sources said.

 Locker rooms have been set up outside the temple, where devotees can keep their mobile phones and cameras.

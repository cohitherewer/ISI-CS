 Buddha price glare on Centre

 Calcutta, June 29: Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today blamed the Centre for the spiralling prices of foodgrain and vegetables in retail markets across the country, reports our special correspondent. 

 He said he had expressed his concern to Union agriculture minister Sharad Pawar. Why are the prices rising now? The food and agriculture ministry should seriously think over the reasons for rise in the prices of foodgrain. 

 Bhattacharjee said the Centres neo-liberal policies in agriculture and procurement of foodgrain had led to the price hike and increased dependence on foodgrain imports at the cost of self-reliance in production. 

 Why is the Centre now importing wheat? It is good that they have stopped the export of pulses. But it should take steps to arrest the price rise. 

 Bhattacharjee said the hike had badly hit people in Bengal, but maintained that the state government alone could not control it. In a nation-wide open market, its not possible. If we do it, it will lead to crisis of supply to our state.

 He said he was talking to the food department to work out ways to bring down prices. 

 I am trying to do something.

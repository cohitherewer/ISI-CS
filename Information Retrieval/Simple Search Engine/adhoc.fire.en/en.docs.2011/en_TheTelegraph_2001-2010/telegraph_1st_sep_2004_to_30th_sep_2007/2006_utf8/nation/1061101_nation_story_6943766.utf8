 Forget opium, CPM sets up minority cell 

 BISWAJIT ROY

 Karat

 Calcutta, Oct. 31: The 

 party named after the man who said religion is the opium 

 of the masses has set up a group that will deal exclusively 

 with issues concerning minorities, especially Muslims.

 The CPMs newborn group referred to within the party as minority fraction will meet for the first time tomorrow in Delhi.

 The fraction, which includes all Muslim members of the central committee as well as leaders deputed to work among the minorities, is headed by general secretary Prakash Karat.

 Set up during the last meeting of the CPM central committee in Delhi, the group is expected to chart a plan to woo the minorities by championing their democratic aspirations.

 The move comes at a time the party is trying to expand its base in the Hindi heartland, particularly in Uttar Pradesh where elections are round the corner as well as in Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, which have sizeable Muslim populations.

 Party MPs and central committee members from Bengal Mohammed Salim and Hannan Molla, former state labour minister Mohammed Amin and former MP Mainul Hassan will represent the state CPM at tomorrows meeting.

 This is the first time the CPM is forming a fraction on the basis of religious identity. So far, the party had fractions on issues like labour, insurance and education. The Bengal CPM has a minority sub-committee.

 However, party sources stressed that the CPM would not float a separate minority organisation. Communists cannot form an organisation based on religion or caste, said a central committee member.

 The CPM is also working on a charter of demands to be placed before the UPA government. This would include demands to ensure employment and education opportunities to Muslims, a leader said.

 But the CPMs opponents are certain to see an electoral design behind the move a charge the party is already facing in Kerala.

 In the southern state, the CPM-led Left Democratic Front had officially distanced itself from the Muslim League in the last Assembly elections. But the front enjoyed the support of the Indian National League, a breakaway faction of the Muslim League, as well as the Peoples Democratic Front led by Abdul Madani, an accused in the Coimbatore blast case.

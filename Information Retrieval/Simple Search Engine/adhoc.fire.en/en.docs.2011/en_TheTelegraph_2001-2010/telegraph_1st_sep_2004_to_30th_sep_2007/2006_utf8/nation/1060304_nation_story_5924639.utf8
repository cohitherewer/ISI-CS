 Lucknow/Hyderabad/Srinagar, March 3: Anti-Bush demonstrations flared into street riots in Lucknow this afternoon, claiming four lives, including that of a three-year-old boy who was hit in the head by a stone.

 In Hyderabad, which the US President visited today, mobs stoned police after the Friday prayers, setting up clashes that left five persons, including two senior officers, injured. The police came under attack also in Kashmir, which was shut down.

 In Lucknow, efforts of the Mohammadi Mission, which had called a bandh, to force shops to close down in the Ameenabad area set off a clash between two communities.

 Soon, the violence had spread to Kesharbag, Nasirabad and Balarampur areas, with stone-throwing mobs battling each other on the streets and from rooftops, and hoodlums joining in with firearms. The boy was reportedly playing outside his home when he got hit. He died in hospital.

 The news of the death stoked the fire, with the police coming under a shower of brickbats in the commercial areas of the old city, where shops, a bank and vehicles were set on fire. By the time the Rapid Action Force and Provincial Armed Constabulary had quelled the rioting by firing and bursting tear gas shells, at least 20 people had suffered injuries in several hours. Three of them died in hospital.

 The dead were from both communities, prompting the VHP to call a bandh tomorrow in Lucknow.

 Tomorrows CBSE exams in the affected localities have been postponed.

 The situation became grim after the anti-socials took charge of the anti-Bush protests and indulged in violence, district magistrate R.N. Tripathi, out in the streets in anti-riot gear, told reporters. The situation is largely under control now.

 In Hyderabad, the administration kept the rallies by the Left and Muslim groups several kilometres away from Bushs routes. 

 All markets and offices stayed closed in Srinagar and traffic went off the streets as demonstrators marched shouting pro-Islam, anti-India and anti-Bush slogans.

 At the Friday prayers, imams delivered furious denunciations of those who indulged in unpardonable blasphemy against the Prophet. 

 They accused Bush of causing the deaths of thousands of innocents in Afghanistan and in Iraq and condemned his anti-Muslim agenda.

 A nervous police, pelted with stones through the day, used batons and teargas to break up mobs in downtown Srinagars Nowhatta, Bohri-Kadal and Gojiwara localities.

 The police handled scores of demonstrations throughout the city today, but not a single ugly incident happened anywhere. Our boys used extreme patience, an officer said.

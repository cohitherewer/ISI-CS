 New Delhi, May 20: The Group of Ministers set up to deal with the reservation row today suggested what the government had hinted at yesterday: introduction of the Other Backward Classes quota with a seats increase.

 Briefing the CWC on the recommendations, defence minister Pranab Mukherjee hoped for a possible breakthrough by Monday even as the government hardened its stand against the agitating medicos.

 The Group of Ministers has worked out a formula to increase the number of seats as well as institutions to ensure that the seats available to general category students arent reduced, a source said.

 The GoM, which submitted the recommendations to the Prime Minister, also suggested that new institutions on the lines of the AIIMS be set up across the country.

 The government earlier threatened strict action against the striking doctors. In a warning signal, it put out newspaper advertisements for recruitment of doctors at its hospitals. Health ministry officials said walk-in interviews would begin on Monday.

 But to try and resolve the standoff through a dialogue, Mukherjee and finance minister P. Chidambaram met representatives of the agitating doctors. Mukherjee later said he had requested the doctors to call off their agitation and they had said they would get back to him tomorrow. I hope it will be resolved by Monday, Mukherjee said.

 The medicos, too, appeared to soften their stand after the meeting. Dr Nethan, speaking on behalf of the agitators, said the proposals to protect the number of seats in the general category and introduce the new quota in a phased manner were a positive step. Yesterday, the doctors had been doubtful about a seats increase, arguing this would need upgraded infrastructure and more teachers and hospitals.

 Late tonight, however, the medicos decided to continue the strike over the Centres rejection of their demand for a committee of experts to review the reservation policy.

 We have decided to continue with the strike. But we are ready to negotiate, a representative of the agitators said. He added they werent aware of the Prime Ministers appeal to them to call off the agitation, and so had not considered it yet.

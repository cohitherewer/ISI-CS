 Cleric quits, Mulayam breathes easy

 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY

 Mulayam Singh

 Lucknow, Aug. 20: The leader of a key Muslim political front who was unhappy with Mulayam Singh Yadav resigned last night, giving the Uttar Pradesh chief minister a bit of relief ahead of elections early next year.

 Maulana Kalbe Jawwad, the chairman of the Peoples Democratic Forum (PDF), stepped down along with a key aide in a departure expected to thwart the formation of a politically strong coalition of Muslim groups.

 Jawwad, a widely respected Shia scholar, became the rallying point for some Muslim clerics upset with Mulayam. However, at a news conference here today, he said he did not receive the large response he needed from community leaders in his offensive against the chief minister.

 Some clerics tried to use the PDF as a platform to widen the Shia-Sunni divide in the state, but I always tried to unite various sects within the community, Jawwad, who claimed the support of 14 Sunni groups, said.

 Jawwad had sparked fears in the Samajwadi Party that he would turn into a Maulana Badruddin Ajmal, the Mumbai perfume trader who denied the Congress the 10 seats it needed for a simple majority in the Assam elections earlier this year. The wild-card contestant was believed to have inspired clerics disillusioned with mainstream political parties.

 The PDF was formed on May 15 with the aim to take Muslims who make up 23 per cent of the voters to a position where they could rule Uttar Pradesh. Its leaders believed that if the Yadavs, who comprise only 7 per cent of the electorate, could run the government, there was no reason why politically organised Muslims could not.

 Under Jawwad, the PDF stepped up its criticism of Mulayam who, some clerics suggested, might have even played a role in piling pressure on the religious leader to quit.

 Jawwad had other rivals, too. One of them was the Shahi Imam of Delhis Jama Masjid, Maulana Syed Ahmed Bukhari, who launched the Uttar Pradesh United Democratic Front (UPUDF), also in May. 

 Publicly, Bukhari has been breathing fire at Mulayam, but his past alliances have earned him the reputation of a turncoat. But Bukhari, a member of the Himmat Committee launched by former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee in 2004, is despised by a large number of clerics for his pro-BJP tilt.

 Although the PDFs general secretary, Nahaluddin, said all constituents were still with it, some observers think Jawwads move could lead to the fronts possible disintegration and even a merger with Bukharis outfit.

 The front had plans to field candidates in 140-145 Assembly seats and could form an alliance with like-minded parties elsewhere. The Bukhari outfit could match it. 

 Many clerics feel the resignations in the PDF would help Mulayam, who has enjoyed the loyalty of Muslims since the Ayodhya movement, breathe a little easy now.

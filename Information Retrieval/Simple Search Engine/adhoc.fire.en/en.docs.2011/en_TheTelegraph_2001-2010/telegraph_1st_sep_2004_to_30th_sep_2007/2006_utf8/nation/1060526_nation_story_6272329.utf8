 Left volley on Calcutta airport

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 25: The Left parties have told the government that the joint venture route for Calcutta and Chennai airports was totally unacceptable.

 The Left has also demanded an authoritative policy pronouncement on the subject in line with the common minimum programme. 

 Angered by civil aviation minister Praful Patels comments that the joint venture option is being considered for the two airports, Left leaders sent a letter to the Prime Minister in which they listed the demand.

 Expressing surprise at Patels statement that a route different to the one followed for Delhi and Mumbai could not be taken, the letter by Left leaders, including Prakash Karat, said: We have to categorically point out that such a policy orientation is totally unacceptable. We firmly reiterate the need for modernisation of all airports, including Chennai and Calcutta, and are convinced that the Airports Authority of India (AAI) is capable of executing these projects, and they have the technical, operational and financial capability to ensure this.

 Excluding the AAI from undertaking this modernisation exercise and handing over these assets to the private JV (joint venture) will make the profitable public sector entity sick, the letter said.

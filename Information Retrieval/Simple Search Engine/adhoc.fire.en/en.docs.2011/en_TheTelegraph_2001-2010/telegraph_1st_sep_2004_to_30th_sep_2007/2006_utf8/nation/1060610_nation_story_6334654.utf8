 Pak consulate hunt ends

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, June 9: Pakistans unending hunt for space to re-open its Mumbai consulate might finally be over.

 Thirteen years after it was closed down following the razing of the Babri Masjid, a one-acre plot in Kalina not very far from Santacruz airport could house the consulate.

 The plot belongs to the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority and would be leased out for 60 years at a cost of about Rs 7 crore.

 Pakistan has yet to give its final nod but indications are that after several options fell through, the suburban Santacruz plot will fit the bill.

 They (Pakistani officials) had come to Mumbai and seen plots in Bandra, Santacruz and Oshiwara and finally chose this one-acre plot. It is priced at Rs 6.94 crore, housing authority vice-president Iqbal Chahal said.

 The difference this time, however, is that Kalina residents are not up in arms against having a Pakistan consulate in their area.

 Why should it bother us? In fact, it is a relief because in case of a terrorist strike, this area at least will be spared for obvious reasons, said a resident, Nikhil Bhandari.

 Some see the development as an indicator of improving Indo-Pak ties. Times are changing. How long will we hold on to past enmities? Its time to move on, said Avanti Khare, a local teacher.

 The Kalina plot is quite a way off from Pakistans first choice, Jinnah House, which it is believed to have been eyeing since Partition. But India was not game.

 The second option was Mittal Chambers in Nariman Point in the heart of Mumbai. But the people there refused to have anything to do with Pakistan, citing security concerns. Next, a bungalow in south Mumbai and a commercial building were considered but plans had to be shelved because of opposition from residents.

 It was a bit tough getting Pakistan space in a commercial or a residential building because neighbours and residents would be apprehensive. I think a plot is the best option even from the security point of view, a senior government official said.

 If this comes through, it might pave the way for an Indian consulate in Karachi.

 Kiran on Booker list

 Kiran Desai, the Indian-origin 

 author who has been shortlisted for the Booker

 London, 

 Sept. 14 (PTI): Indian-origin writer Kiran Desais 

 novel The Inheritance of Loss was today shortlisted 

 for this years Man Booker prize along with five other 

 works of fiction.

 Her book, a cross-continental saga set in New York and India with a teenage girl as the protagonist, explores contemporary issues like multiculturalism, fundamentalism and terrorism.

 Kiran is the daughter of writer Anita Desai, who was shortlisted for the prize three times in the 1980s.

 The other five books which are in the fray for the $50,000 award are Kate Grenvilles The Secret River, M.J. Hylands Carry Me Down, Hisham Matars In The Country of Men, Edward St Aubyns Mothers Milk and Sarah Waterss The Night Watch.

 Each of the six authors, selected from a list of 19, receives $2,500. 

 The award, which went to The Sea by Irish author John Banville last year, will be announced on October 10.

 Of the six, only Waters was nominated before, while Matar is the only first-time novelist to make the cut. 

 British author David Mitchell the bookmakers early favourite to win when the list was announced last month is not included on the list. 

 Previous recipients Peter Carey, Nadine Gordimer and Barry Unsworth also failed to make it past the first round, BBC reported. 

 Each of these novels has what we as judges were most looking for, academic Hermione Lee, chair of this years judging panel, was quoted as saying.

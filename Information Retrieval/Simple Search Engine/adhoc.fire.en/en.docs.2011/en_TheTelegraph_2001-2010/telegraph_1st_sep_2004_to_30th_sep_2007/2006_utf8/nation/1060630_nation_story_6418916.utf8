 Fiction, says priest

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Thiruvananthapuram, June 29: A leading priest at the Sabarimala hill shrine has threatened to take Kannada actress Jayamala to court for casting aspersions on priests and spreading canards about her supposed entry into the temple way back in 1987.

 The temple, Keralas leading Hindu shrine, welcomes people from all faiths ? unless they happen to be women aged between 10 and 50.

 Jayamala (in picture) also said she was pushed from behind in the queue and ended up touching the idol, which to the orthodox amounts to defilement.

 Priest Kantararu Mohanararu, who hails from a family that has traditional bonds with the temple dedicated to Lord Ayyappa, reflected a growing concern among believers and the clergy who believe that Jayamalas claim is too preposterous to be true.

 He said it would have been very difficult for Jayamala, aged 27 in 1987, to breach the security apparatus and be shoved all the way up to the portals of the innermost abode of the deity who sits a further 15 feet away on a pedestal. 

 How could she have done all this without anyone noticing her? Her claim that a priest had presented her a rose after she touched the idol and that other devotees outside touched her hallowed self are pure fiction, Mohanararu said.

 Jayamala made her admission in a letter to Vedic astrologer Parappanangadi Unnikrishna Panicker. The issue has kicked off a gender row with women devotees expressing disappointment at the ban and activists criticising the discrimination.

 Hindu temple endowments minister G. Sudhakaran, a Marxist, said he smelt a conspiracy. The actress can be prosecuted if what she says is true. Her remarks are aimed at driving a wedge between sections of devotees. She should have kept off the row surrounding the temple, Sudhakaran said.

 The controversy has acquired a new dimension with Mohanararu accusing foul play by Panicker.

 Panicker had led a team of astrologers who conducted a traditional ritual which, he said, showed that the presiding deity was displeased with some of the recent happenings at the temple. The astrologer has hit back by saying he was being targeted because he is not a Brahmin.

 G. Raman Nair, the president of Travancore Devaswom Board, which governs the Sabarimala temple, says the controversy is too serious to be ignored. The board will meet on July 7 to decide on the probe.

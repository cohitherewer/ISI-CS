 Hrishida makes a quiet exit

 - A film-maker who struck a chord with the middle class, creating a genre defined by simplicity amp; sensitivity

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Hrishikesh Mukherjee

 Mumbai, Aug. 27: There was an eerie quiet at Lilavati Hospital this evening where Hrishikesh Mukherjee breathed his last around 4.40 pm.

 No one from Bollywood could be spotted on the hospital premises, which usually turns into a celebrity circus whenever the rich and famous are housed there.

 But this Sunday was different. Except for a huddle of close family members, there were not many mourners to be seen. Outside, the city was busy celebrating its biggest festival Ganesh Chaturthi.

 At first glance, one could hardly tell that one of Bollywoods greatest film-makers the man credited with launching Amitabh Bachchans career and giving prized roles to Rajesh Khanna, Dharmendra and Sharmila Tagore had passed away.

 Most stars had discreetly visited him in hospital over the past two months while he lay critically ill and supported by a ventilator.

 It is not clear till when Hrishidas body will be at the hospital. Mr Bachchan will go to pay his respects once the family is through with the arrangements, said Rosy, the superstars assistant.

 Just a kilometre from Lilavati Hospital, there was frenzied activity at Mukherjees Carter Road residence in Bandra.

 His son-in-law Pradeep Bhattacharya, who had been shuttling between the hospital and residence, said: We hope to bring him over to the house later in the night.

 We except a lot of visitors tomorrow and we are in the process of making last minute arrangements to handle that. His son is on his way back from the States and will arrive on Monday. The cremation would be on Tuesday.

 Mukherjees old friend and colleague A.K. Hangal had visited the ailing director last month and remembered the meeting fondly.

 He had tubes attached to almost every part of his body and couldnt speak. But he was his usual self. He used to call me Munna, ever since I played the part in Bawarchi. At the hospital, he communicated with paper and pencil. As soon as I walked into the room and sat down, he wrote Now that Munna has come, I am going to get better soon. He was so full of life, Hangal said.

 Hangal remembered first meeting Mukherjee at Mumbais Mohan Studio where he had gone to meet Bimal Roy.

 I used to be part of the Indian Peoples Theatre Association and he, though not formally into it, was very close to the values and beliefs it stood for. He was a socialist, pro-working class, pro-middle class.

 Our shared values created a strong bond between us. When I was leaving the hospital that day, he just held my hand for a long time. I knew it was a goodbye.

 Last salute

 The Prime Minister and the President joined Bollywood in offering Mukherjee their last salute. Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee offered condolences to his family.

 Rajesh Khanna, who acted in Anand and Bawarchi, said: Every morning I will remember him and the thoughts he gave me. Hrishida will continue to live in us forever.

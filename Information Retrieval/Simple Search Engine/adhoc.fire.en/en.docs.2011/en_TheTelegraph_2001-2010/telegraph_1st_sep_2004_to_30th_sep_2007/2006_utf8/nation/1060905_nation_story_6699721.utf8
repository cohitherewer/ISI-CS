The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Finally, quota protesters show political colours

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 4: The 

 anti-reservation students, who had won many admirers by 

 keeping their distance from all political parties, have 

 begun to show political allegiance.

 Youth For Equality, which led the country-wide quota protests in May, will support BJP student wing, Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad, in the upcoming Delhi University polls.

 The decision is an about-face from the groups vaunted stand of not having any alliance with any of the (political) student bodies, and threatens to widen the fissures in the anti-reservation camp that began showing recently.

 Although the ABVP, like its parent party, officially supports the 27 per cent quota for other backward classes in higher education, many of its activists had implicitly backed the protesters.

 We have decided to support the ABVP because we share some common ground, said Abhishek Kumar, Delhi University coordinator of Youth For Equality.

 The common ground, he explained, was that both organisations want the creamy layer out of the quotas ambit. So does the CPM.

 In a democracy, there is no other way of expressing ones point of view, Kumar said.

 The ABVPs political opponents have been quick to claim that the decision only confirms what they have long suspected that deeper links exist between the anti-reservation agitators and upper-caste parties like the BJP and Shiv Sena.

 We have long believed that Youth for Equality was being financed by the BJP, Shiv Sena and some industrialists. They were putting up a charade. This decision only vindicates our belief, said Shubhonil Chaudhary, secretary of SFI, the CPM students wing, at Jawaharlal Nehru University.

 Many supporters of the anti-quota movement are dismayed. Joining hands with the ABVP would seriously reduce Youth For Equalitys credibility, they said.

 The reason I supported them was that they were not with any of the political parties. They were independent, fighting for what they thought was right. Now that has changed, said Ashok Gulati, a businessman.

 Youth for Equalitys decision, however, is in keeping with the growing consensus among its leaders that it would be next to impossible to stop the reservation bill, which has been tabled in Parliament and referred to a standing committee.

 The anti-reservation group has now started focusing on opposing the creamy layer rather than the quota itself.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Delhi twice shy on Nepal

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 This is a victory for the people of 

 Nepal, who have displayed extraordinary courage.... 

 The future of Nepal is safe in their hands From 

 the statement issued by the Government of India

 New Delhi, April 25: India today welcomed the Nepal kings announcement to revive Parliament and called it a victory of the people but has adopted a policy of adhocism for the aftermath.

 Defence minister Pranab Mukherjee 

 (in picture), who chaired a meeting of the cabinet committee 

 on political affairs in the absence of the Prime Minister, 

 said India will not pre-judge developments in 

 Nepal that will ensue with the reconvening of its Parliament 

 from Friday.

 So many things will develop in course of time. Let us not pre-judge all these things. Now there is a 12-point understanding between the Maoists and the seven-party alliance. What will be the ultimate outcome will be too difficult to say right at this moment, Mukherjee said after the committee issued a statement on the events in Nepal.

 The statement makes no mention of King Gyanendra or the fate of monarchy. Neither does it say anything specific on the Maoists who have rejected the acceptance of the seven-party alliance of the kings decision.

 Todays statement is the second on Nepal after Delhi gave another welcoming statement when Gyanendra said last Friday that he will transfer executive authority to the people. 

 But in the four days between that statement and todays, India was forced to reconsider its position by the sustained demonstrations in Kathmandu. It is of some solace to the Indian government that there was evidence of celebrations in Nepals capital today despite the Maoists rejecting the stand of the seven-party alliance in accepting the kings decision.

 This (the announcement to re-convene Parliament) is a victory for the people of Nepal who have displayed extraordinary courage and reaffirmed their faith and commitment to freedom and democracy. The future of Nepal is safe in their hands, the official statement said.

 It acknowledged that there are more issues that needed to be sorted out. Mukherjee would not take a question on where India stood on the Maoists demand for a Constituent Assembly.

 We are conscious of the challenges that lie ahead for Nepal as it embarks on the journey towards restoring political stability, achieving economic recovery and finding a peaceful solution to the armed conflict, the statement read.

 Asked if India will resume arms supplies to Nepal, the defence minister said: Let the government be installed. That will depend on the requirement of the government. Mukherjee sought to underplay Indias hand in shaping the kings announcement and in getting the seven-party alliance to accept the revival of the Nepalese parliament.

 We do not have any role beyond that of a neighbouring country. We have to have peace with our neighbours. We cannot change our neighbours, he said.

 Foreign secretary Shyam Saran, who is a Nepal hand having been the ambassador to Kathmandu, was by Mukherjees side as the defence minister gave the briefing after the meeting. 

 The 90-minute meeting was attended by, among others, human resource development minister Arjun Singh, home minister Shivraj Patil, railway minister Lalu Prasad and agriculture minister Sharad Pawar.

 Eye scan for terror

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 7: The look in their eyes may vary from shifty to wary to cold. But they cant hide the shape and colour even with contact lenses ? at least from these cameras.

 The Centre plans to catch terrorists and criminals trying to enter or leave the country from the unique pattern of their irises.

 Once the Iris Recognition Immigration System (IRIS) is installed at airport immigrations, passengers will have to pass through an automated barrier and look into a camera for a couple of seconds.

 The camera will immediately send the details of their irises ? even if hidden by contact lenses ? to a computer that will match them against a data bank to tell if a particular passenger is a wanted terrorist.

 No two iris patterns are alike; this system is the quickest and surest way to zero in on suspects and potential threats at a crowded and busy place like an airport, a home ministry official said.

 The principle is based on biometrics, the technique of measuring features of the human body to identify individuals. It allows body parts to be used as security passwords and in PIN identification, smart cards and the like.

 The ministry is working on the proposal. We plan to have a biometric data bank of wanted terrorists, the official said.

 Does India have data on the iris patterns of Dawood Ibrahim or Osama bin Laden? Not yet, but it might someday, ministry sources suggested efforts are on to build a common data bank on international terrorists through cooperation between the internal security agencies of various countries.

 The ideal situation would be to shift to the e-passport that has several biometric features of the individual stored on it. But its very costly ? only a few advanced countries have done it and that, too, not fully, the official said.

 The security agencies of many countries record the biometric details of major or potential criminals and terrorists once they arrest him. Sometimes, such data are procured through the intelligence agencies. There is a possibility that we might get some biometric details, such as the iris pattern of people like Osama and Dawood Ibrahim through some source.

 Nursery interviews outlawed

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 10: Delhi High Court today directed private schools in the capital to end the practice of conducting interviews of children and their parents for admission to nursery classes.

 A division bench directed all schools to end the practice within four weeks. 

 The court set the deadline today after the school managements failed to come up with suggestions on parameters for admission despite the courts earlier direction on December 9, 2005, to do away with such interviews.

 Expressing anguish over the inaction of the school managements, the court recalled that even though the association of unaided private schools had assured in an affidavit that suitable parameters would be evolved to dispense with the practise, no such efforts had been made even four months after the assurance.

 The order was passed after a public interest litigation was filed by Social Jurist, an NGO, which pointed out that private schools were conducting interviews of both the parents and children of tender age at the time of admission. 

 The organisation had also alleged that the practice not only caused embarrassment and inconvenience to parents but also subjected the children to severe mental trauma.

 Many principals refrained from directly criticising the judgement but said some sort of screening method was needed.

 Phulwari (Patna), Jan. 1: Four-year-old Bablu, from Shivganj in Bhojpur, looks happy as he plays with the stuffed clown the President gave him yesterday. Not ready to let go of it, he slept with the toy last night. Bablus smile is infectious. He doesnt know he suffers from leukaemia but he feels extremely tired.

 Manoj, 13, is not so happy but it doesnt show because he ever so often breaks into laughter. He missed out on a gift from the President and reminds the doctor about it. 

 The doctor hands Manojs father a hundred-rupee note and asks him to get a toy for his boy. Manojs blood cancer is serious.

 Sujata, 11, whom A.P.J. Abdul Kalam also met, says: Rashtrapatiji asked me if I was all right. I am fine now.

 Things, however, were quite different in March when Sujata arrived at Mahavir Cancer Sansthan. 

 She had a lump in her neck and her spleen was enlarged. After chemotherapy, she is 90 per cent cured, says her grandfather Surya Narayan Mishra, a retired teacher from Chhapra.

 It is Sujatas story that inspires the doctors here. It keeps alive the hope that Bablu, Manoj, Kundan, Pintu, Rashid, Rajesh and their friends can actually defeat cancer. All of them come from poor families.

 Hospital director J.K. Singh, a cancer specialist, feels the children must attend school because knowledge is the key to fight the disease.

 Only eight hospitals in India have a separate department of paediatric oncology to treat children suffering from cancer. The one at this hospital, run by Mahavir Mandir in Patna, is the biggest. 

 The 50-bed, 20,000-square-foot facility, inaugurated by the President yesterday, is the first of its kind in eastern India.

 Children under 15 make up 40 per cent of the countrys cancer patients. Seven out of 10 among these children suffer from blood cancer (leukaemia). Some 70 per cent of child blood cancer patients can be cured, and the lives of the remaining 30 per cent can be prolonged, Singh says.

 But only 10 per cent of these children get cured. The rest do not get good treatment because of ignorance, poverty or the lack of healthcare infrastructure. This was why we opened a separate paediatric oncology department here.

 The reasons for the high incidence of blood cancer among children are that they have rapidly growing cells and that the disease is linked to heredity.

 Parents should get their children examined at least once a year. They should report any problem to a doctor at once. Most important, they should keep the children away from tobacco in any of its forms, Singh says.

 The hospital will soon send teams of doctors to 600 schools of the region, not only to detect early cancer cases but also to educate the children about the seriousness of the disease and, through them, their parents and teachers.

 Kids are the best target group for generating cancer awareness. If one child gets to know about it, he will trigger a chain reaction. We have started a department of community oncology, which will co-ordinate the awareness programme, says Magan Deo Narayan Singh, the institutes media consultant.

 Heat on for Neel arrest

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Feb. 10: The Nationalist Congress Party has demanded the re-arrest of Standard Chartered vice-president Neel Chatterjee in the hit-and-run case.

 The party wants Chatterjee to be put behind bars under more stringent sections and be made to pay a compensation of Rs 50 lakh.

 The 49-year-old executive, whose blood tests have revealed that he was drunk when he knocked down 60-year-old temple watchman Ramakant Dhuri on the night of February 4, had to be chased by a police patrol car and brought to book.

 A group of NCP activists, led by Vijay Kamble, today staged a demonstration at Dadar police station, accusing the police of conniving with Chatterjees lawyers to allow the executive to get bail so easily.

 The Bhoiwada metropolitan magistrate released Chatterjee on a cash bail of Rs 10,000 on Sunday afternoon.

 What has happened is really sad. We will move Bombay High Court by next week, demanding cancellation of bail to Chatterjee and his re-arrest. Dhuris poor family has lost an earning member and should receive at least Rs 50 lakh in compensation, Kamble said after meeting the watchmans family in a slum near the Nehru Planetarium in Worli. 

 Kamble has promised the family ? Dhuris widow Yojana, 55, son Rajesh, 32, daughter-in-law Sujata and grandson Romit, 6 ? necessary legal help. Dhuris other son, 28-year-old Vinayak, works in a garment shop in Dubai. We dont know much about the laws, but we feel that the police have not applied the right sections. How else could he get bail so easily? asked Rajesh.

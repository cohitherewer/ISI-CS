 Journalist lights up slap charge

 Chennai, Aug. 30 (PTI): A French journalist has alleged that he was assaulted and detained at Chennai airport by CISF personnel on the charge of smoking at the check-in area early this morning.

 Serrguey Ugin, an employee of the daily Le Monde, alleged that a CISF officer slapped him, while others roughed him up and hit him on his legs.

 CISF sources, however, said it was Ugin who had hit the officer when asked to stub out his cigarette.

 The problem began when Ugin and his journalist wife Flora, who had been holidaying in Pondicherry, were waiting to board a flight to Paris, sources said. Just before boarding, he wanted to smoke and lit a cigarette, when an officer allegedly slapped him.

 Other CISF personnel then rushed to the spot and beat up the scribe, apparently thinking that he was a terrorist.

 The matter has been sorted out and Ugin will leave for France tonight or tomorrow.

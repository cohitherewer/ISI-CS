 Bangalore, Oct. 29: Mysore police have arrested three persons and detained four for he-lping suspected militants Mohammed Fahad and Moha-mmed Ali Hussein procure crucial documents, including driving licences and birth certificates.

 Those arrested are passport agent Sharief, a Mysore City Corporation deed writer, Nanjappa, and an agent, Gopal.

 Fahad had visited his relatives and his fathers house in Kozhikode and tried to get a passport from there. The passport agent took Rs 20,000 and photographs, assuring Fahad he would get a passport in the name of Mohammad Koya. Police are checking if the application was filed in Kerala.

 Mysore police commissioner Praveen Sood said Hussein got his name included in an old ration card by changing one Asifs name to Ali and coaxed a woman to claim she was his mother. He got a birth certificate with Nanjappas help. Gopal helped Fahad get a domicile certificate.

 A forensic team from Bangalore has arrived to examine seized weapons and other equipment.

 Police in Kerala have registered a case against the husband of Fahads sister for not sharing information about the Pakistani national. However, Kammat Haji was not taken into custody.

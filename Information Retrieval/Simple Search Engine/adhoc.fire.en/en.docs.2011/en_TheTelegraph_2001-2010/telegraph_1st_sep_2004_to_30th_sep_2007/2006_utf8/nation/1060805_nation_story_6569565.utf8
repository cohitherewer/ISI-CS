 Effigy fury singes cops

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Bhopal, Aug. 4: The hostility between the ruling BJP and its breakaway group led by Uma Bharti has turned violent with three police constables suffering injuries during the burning of an effigy of the Madhya Pradesh chief minister in Chattarpur district.

 Workers of Umas Bhartiya Janshakti Party were burning an effigy of Shivraj Singh Chauhan at Bejewar tehsil, some 300 km north of the state capital, last evening when policemen in civilian clothes tried to prevent it.

 Mistaking them for BJP members, some workers of Umas BJP reportedly sprayed kerosene on them, said Chattarpur superintendent of police Chantal Shepherd. 

 Three of them were taken to the Chattarpur civil hospital with 20 per cent burns, a witness said.

 The police are trying to identify the culprits.

 A former Union minister and close Uma aide, Prahlad Patel, however, denied that his party workers were responsible. 

 We had been holding a peaceful demonstration since July 31 to draw the governments attention towards suicides because of poverty and malnutrition. 

 As per democratic traditions, we were burning the chief ministers effigy, he said. 

 Prahlad alleged that Chauhan had instructed the state polices bigwigs to ensure that his effigy is not burned.

 State Congress general secretary Manak Aggarwal also recalled incidents of his party workers getting beaten up in Sagar, Bhopal, Sehore and several other districts while trying to burn Chauhans effigy.

 There is a great deal of merit in what Prahlad is saying, said Aggarwal, the leader of the main Opposition party in the state.

 Prahlad threatened the ruling BJP not to politicise the issue. It was an unfortunate incident and perhaps policemen sustained burns while trying to prevent the effigy-burning. It was not a wise move under the circumstances. They were not in uniform, too, he said.

 Tension prevailed in the area today, forcing the district administration to deploy over 10,000 policemen drawn from neighbouring districts.

 Chattarpur district is among Umas few strongholds in Bundelkhand, one of the most backward regions of the country.

 Dias car 

Mumbai, March 15 (PTI): The customs department in Mumbai has seized an imported car of actor Dia Mirza for allegedly evading duty, department sources said.

Customs officials have summoned Mirza, suspecting 

that she did not pay the duty on her Land Cruiser. The actor, who is currently 

in Goa, will appear before the department soon, they said. 

 The department had earlier seized imported cars of actors Salman Khan and Saif Ali Khan but returned them after realising that they had paid the necessary dues. Sanjay Dutts Porsche and Suniel Shettys Hummer were seized late last October. 

 Actor Sushmita Sens Land Cruiser was seized on similar charges earlier this month. 

 She has been asked to cough up Rs 20 lakh for the luxury vehicle.

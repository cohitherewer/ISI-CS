 Code set for forensic test

 New Delhi, Nov. 10: Law enforcement agencies may not be able to fudge evidence as they allegedly did in the Jessica Lal murder case where the accused, Manu Sharma, has strong political connections. 

 Home ministry sources said the directorate of forensic science has issued a code of ethics to all forensic laboratories in states to prevent foul play in establishing or destroying evidence.

 The ministry decided to issue the guidelines after it found that frequently the samples sent to various laboratories were not portions of the same sample but of different ones, throwing up several results and leading to acquittal of the culprit.

 In the Jessica case, the prosecution had argued that Manu fired two bullets, one in the air and the other fatally at the model. But a forensic report declared that the bullets had been fired from different guns. 

 This, coupled with the polices failure to find a single gun, had led to the collapse of the case. It has been alleged that the cartridges were tampered with.

 In the guidelines issued last month, the ministry asked all the labs not to accept cases from outside their jurisdiction without permission of the competent authority. For example, a case from outside the state should be taken up only when the permission has been given in writing by the government of the state from which it is coming.

 It has become mandatory for the investigating officer to obtain permission from a senior officer not below the rank of superintendent of police for referring cases for re-examination. 

 The investigating officer will also have to certify that the sample being sent for re-examination are the remnants received from the lab that had tested it earlier. The parcel in which the sample is sent should bear the seal of the first lab.

 If the sample to be examined is different from the first one for instance, another sample taken from the same scene of crime, it should be treated as a fresh case rather than a re-examination. 

 In the case of a difference of opinion among two laboratories, a committee formed by the directorate of forensic science will examine the reports and give its finding of the reasons for the divergence.

 Kashmir sleaze on HC radar

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Srinagar, May 10: Jammu and Kashmir High Court has ordered the states chief secretary and director-general of police to appear in person before it on May 12 with all the relevant communications the government had exchanged with the CBI in the sex scandal that has rocked the Valley. 

 Hearing the case, Justice Hakim Imtiyaz Hussain passed the order today.

 The summons came on a day it was announced that following a notification issued by the department of personnel and training, a special team of the CBI will arrive tomorrow to take charge of the probe from the state police. 

 Responding to media reports alleging involvement of some senior local politicians, bureaucrats and police officers in the sleaze racket, the high court took cognisance of the matter on its own last Tuesday.

 The Kashmir Bar Association that had filed a public interest litigation on the matter decided to boycott the court unless its PIL was heard by the division bench of the high court instead of the single judge before whom the PIL was listed for hearing today.

 Raising anti-government slogans, the bar association members took out a protest march. The association has also demanded the setting up of a fast-track court to dispose of the PIL.

 The CBI has formed a team of 12 officers headed by a DIG-rank officer to investigate the case. The agency will set up a camp office for three months here, sources said. 

 The CBI team will be arriving here tomorrow and all the case records are ready to be handed over to it, said a senior state police officer. 

 Activists of the womens wing of the Opposition National Conference took out a protest march here today demanding punishment for those involved in the scandal.

 Two militant outfits today issued a threat to sleaze ring operators to wind up within 24 hours or face consequences.

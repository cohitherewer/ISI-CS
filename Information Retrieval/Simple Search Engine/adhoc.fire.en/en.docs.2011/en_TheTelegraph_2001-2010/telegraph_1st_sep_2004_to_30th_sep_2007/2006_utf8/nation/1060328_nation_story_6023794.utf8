 HC order to clear Azads grave

New Delhi (PTI): Delhi High Court has ordered the city police 

commissioner to take immediate steps to clear the site of late freedom fighter 

Maulana Abul Kalam Azads grave where an unauthorised structure has been 

built.

 A special bench of Justices Vijender Jain and Rekha Sharma said the land on which Azads grave stands ? in the precincts of the Jama Masjid ? should be developed as the appropriate resting place befitting his stature on a par with that of Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru.

 It also granted four weeks to various government agencies to put into motion the redevelopment plan for the Jama Masjid area, which will cost Rs 93 crore.

 Najmi Waziri, counsel for the Delhi Wakf Board, and other advocates had complained to the court that some persons had clandestinely constructed a structure at the site of Azads grave and were staying there.

 Iran gas supply in pipeline

 Mashaee is the first Iranian leader to visit Delhi after India voted in favour of an International Atomic Energy Agency resolution seeking Irans referral to the UN Security Council as punishment for enriching uranium for nuclear weapons. India used the visit to clear the air over its position on the nuclear programme and Mashaee seemed satisfied.

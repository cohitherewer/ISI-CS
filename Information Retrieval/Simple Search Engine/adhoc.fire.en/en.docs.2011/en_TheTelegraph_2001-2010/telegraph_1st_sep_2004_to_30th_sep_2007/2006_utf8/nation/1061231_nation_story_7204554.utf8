The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Now, a dacoity in Singur

 OUR BUREAU 

 Dec. 30: A Singur farmer who had sold his land to the Bengal government for the Tata Motors factory today became the target of robbers who took away money and jewellery worth over a lakh from his house. 

 A gang of 10 masked men, who apparently used gas-cutters to get through an iron grille and shovels to prise open a door, stormed into Paban Bags house at Beraberi early this morning. 

 Bag (40) had handed over his four-bigha plot for the proposed car plant, an officer of the Singur police station said. The robbers had expected him to keep a part of the money at home, he added. 

 What they took away, though, was jewellery and some Rs 10,000.

 Hooghly superintendent of police Supratim Sarkar called it a petty crime.

 The heist took place 48 hours after Tinkari Dey and his wife Maya, who had also given their land for the Tata project, were found dead in their house at Gopalnagar (East). 

 On December 18, teenager Tapasi Malik was found in flames at Bajemelia, a few kilometres away. She had been protesting against the Tata project, about 40 km from Calcutta.

 Letter protest

 The Trinamul Congress-backed Save Farmland Committee will write to the President and the Prime Minister protesting against the Bengal governments decision to extend prohibitory orders in Singur. The restrictions would be in place for another 19 days.

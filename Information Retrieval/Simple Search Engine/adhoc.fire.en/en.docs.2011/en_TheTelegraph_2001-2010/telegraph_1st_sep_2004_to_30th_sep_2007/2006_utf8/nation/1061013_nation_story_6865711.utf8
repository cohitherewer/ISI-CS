 EU chair plays nuke poker

 Helsinki, Oct. 12: Finland, which holds the current presidency of the European Union, today hedged its bets on publicly supporting the Indo-US civilian nuclear cooperation deal.

 Indian officials, however, dismissed this, claiming that this was no big deal. Their confidence came from the fact that in private conversations they have been told that Finland, in fact, is sympathetic to the deal.

 Finland is unable to support the deal publicly because it currently holds the presidency of the European Union it would not like to do anything that pre-empts the emergence of a common European position.

 This was borne out by Prime Minister Matti Vanhanen of Finland repeatedly refusing to be drawn into a categorical statement about whether Helsinki supported the India-US nuclear deal. He claimed that since the European Union did not have a common position on the issue, he could not discuss his countrys individual position.

 Successive countries, who take their turn at the six-monthly rotating EU presidency, have tied to get a common EU position on a variety of issues and failed and there is no reason to believe that a unified position would be achieved on the Indo-US nuclear deal in the three months left of Finlands presidency. But clearly Helsinki wants to be careful of the sensibilities of other EU members.

 Finland is a member of the 45-member Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), which seeks to control trade in nuclear technology and materials as well as dual-use technologies. India needs changes in NSG guidelines, and was hoping for clear support from Helsinki, so that it can access nuclear material and technology from the international market.

 Prime Minister Vanhanen had no problem, however, in accepting the fact that Indias energy consumption was increasing rapidly. He agreed that every country had the right to choose its sources of energy. But when it came to saying something categorical on the India-US civilian nuclear cooperation deal, he only said he hoped that India could be part of all those agreements that we have in the field of nuclear energy.

 This could either mean that he hoped to welcome India in the NSG or that he wanted India to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the Wassenaar Arrangement on Export Controls for Conventional Arms and Dual-Use Goods and Technologies. 

 If Indian officials are not indulging in doctoring the views expressed by the Finish government in private, then Vanhanen could mean the former a distinct position from the hardline taken by some other NSG countries.

 The Finnish Prime Minister, however, also seemed to suggest that like Finland, India should explore the use of bio-energy and other sources of renewable energy. In his country, for example, he said 20 per cent of all energy was accounted for by bio-energy. 

 Vanhanen also said Finland favoured Indias permanent membership of the UN Security Council.

 Both Manmohan Singh and Vanhanen agreed that there was a need for countering the global challenge of terrorism with widest possible cooperation. 

 The Indian Prime Minister said: We discussed the need to strengthen international initiatives in combating terrorism. India has been a victim of terrorism. I appreciate the support and solidarity extended by Finland.

 Singh said that in his meeting with his Finnish counterpart Prime discussions were held on the vast complementarities that existed between the two countries which must be fully exploited. He listed several areas where bilateral economic cooperation could be enhanced.

 The Prime Minister said that India was a safe, secure and profitable investment destination. He argued that Indias young population profile and a large pool of skill could be an asset to Europe, where an aging population is increasing and economic growth has slowed down.

 Both the Prime Ministers categorically condemned the North Korean nuclear test and urged Pyongyang to come back into the six-nation dialogue. Vanhanen said: It is the only way for (resolving) this problem. North Korea should, of course, end its nuclear weapons programme.

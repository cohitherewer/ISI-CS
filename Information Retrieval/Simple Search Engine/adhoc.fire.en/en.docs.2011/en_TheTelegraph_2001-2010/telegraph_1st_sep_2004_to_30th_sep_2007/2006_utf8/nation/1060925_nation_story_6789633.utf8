 Coke fishes in rain water

 Dikshit: Hand in hand

 New Delhi, Sept. 24: Kerala and Karnataka may be sceptical about Cola companies, but the government in Delhi appears to have no such misgivings.

 Instead, the Sheila Dikshit regime is collaborating with Coca-Cola on a project critics of the soft drink major see as an attempt to change its image.

 In the middle of a controversy over too much pesticide content in its drinks, the cola company is busy with rainwater harvesting, and is getting support for its efforts from the Delhi government.

 One such rainwater harvesting plant was inaugurated recently in Chittaranjan Park, the capitals little Bengal. It isnt the only such plant on Cokes agenda though.

 Five such plants are planned for Delhi alone and, according to Coca-Cola India vice-president Deepak Jolly, the company is thinking of taking the idea to other cities with water-shortage problems. 

 Suchitra Pillai a parent who was part of the campaign to get soft drinks out of school canteens both recently and in 2003, when the issue of pesticides in colas first came up feels Coke is just trying to change its image.

 The fact of the matter is we still dont know whether their soft drinks are safe. That they should be trying to raise the water table after Plachimada is even more ridiculous, she says.

 The reference is to the controversy over the north Kerala bottling plant accused of depleting the groundwater level in the area. Local residents have been agitating against the plant for allegedly causing water shortage and pollution.

 Jolly sees no contradiction. The water harvesting idea was conceived before the pesticide crisis. We are not trying to reinvent our image, he says. But Pillai says it is not when the idea was conceived that raises questions, but its implementation at a time when the monsoon is nearly over.

 Dikshit, who is in trouble after the shop-sealing drive and police firing on traders, is, however, not averse to being seen with the heads of the cola major.

 The water harvesting plants are to receive subsidies and other help from the Delhi government as a part of her pet Bhagidari scheme projected as a partnership between citizens and their government.

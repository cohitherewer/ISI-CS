 BJP takes family planning lesson from Pak

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Chauhan: In neighbour rsquo;s steps

Bhopal, Dec. 22: When it comes to preaching family planning among Muslims, the BJP government in Madhya Pradesh is even prepared to follow the Pakistan model.

 Health minister Ajay Vishnoi has triggered controversy by announcing the Shivraj Singh Chauhan-led government would follow the example of Pakistan, which has reportedly decided to distribute contraceptives at mosques and involve clerics in spreading family planning awareness.

 As a first step, the state will distribute 10,000 copies of a book written by BJP national executive member and columnist Muzaffar Hussain. The book, published by the Vishwa Hindu Parishad-run Vishwa Sanwad Kendra, claims Islam promotes population control.

 Vishnoi said: I received inspiration from Pakistan and what Hussain has written in Census Islam and Family Planning. The book will help correct the misconceptions about family planning among Muslims.

 Some Muslim clerics and scholars, as well as the Congress, view the ministers remarks with suspicion. The scholar and Jamiat-e-Ulema representative, Noorullah Yusufzai, said the governments reliance on a columnist associated with the Sangh parivar was questionable.

 He is neither an authority on Islam nor on family planning. I feel some of the Quranic verses he quotes do not convey the meaning he has derived from them.

 Since when has the BJP government started viewing Pakistan as a model? Why has it singled out the Muslim community? writer Manzoor Ehtesham asked.

 What is the use of distributing books when the literacy level is so low? Is not the minister aware of the link between socio-economic indicators and population stabilisation?

 Vishnoi justified the focus on Muslims saying: At several places, ignorance is being deliberately encouraged in the name of Islam. We want to present a correct and accurate picture.

 About the low rate of literacy, he said: We are working to improve that, too.

 State Congress spokesman Manak Aggarwal questioned Vishnois obsession with Muslims. According to the 2001 census, the state population is 6,03,48,000, he said. Hindus account for 5,50,05,000 (91.2 per cent) and Muslims for 38,41,000 (6.3 per cent). So, I believe the decision has more to do with religion and politics than addressing a social concern.

 Sources close to Vishnoi said he got his inspiration from a recent news report. It quoted Pakistans population planning minister, Chaudhry Shahbaz Hussain, as saying that the birth rate in his country was 1.86 per cent, which his ministry wanted to bring down to 1.3 per cent by 2020.

 Hussain was also quoted as saying that contraceptives, medicines and family planning literature would be made available in mosques. Around 22,000 clerics, including 6,000 women scholars, were being appointed to raise awareness.

 Aggarwal said Vishnois initiative would be useless.

 Its a step taken to keep Sangh leaders in good humour and save his chair, he said alluding to Vishnois feud with state Speaker Ishwardas Rohani. 

 Since both are from the BJP, Chauhan is under pressure to act against one of them and end the embarrassment.

 Cong searches for answers 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 2: Destiny, or perhaps P.V. Narasimha Rao, picked Manmohan Singh to change the face of the economy irrevocably in 1991. Fifteen years later, destiny, or perhaps Sonia Gandhi, chose him to bring Raos foreign policy to its logical fruition. 

 When Singh was made the finance minister, the economy was in a shambles. It had an unsustainable fiscal deficit of 8.5 per cent of the GDP and was stagnating at a Hindu growth rate of 4 per cent. 

 After unveiling the historic 1991 budget, which marked Indias break from a state-controlled and licence-ordered economy, Singh had said: I said to him (Rao)? there is a chance that if we take bold measures, we may turn around and that, I said, is an opportunity. We must convert this crisis into an opportunity to build a new India.

 The Congress took its time to accept Manmohanomics and the partys old-timers still blame Singh for the drubbing in the 1996 elections. When he was made Prime Minister in 2004, in deference to the Congresss conservatives, he himself qualified his pro-reforms outlook with the phrase reforms with a human face.

 Today, as he clinched the nuclear deal with President George W. Bush, Singh was seen as making a quantum leap forward from the pro-US tilt inducted by Rao in Indias foreign policy. That is what the partys die-hards, weaned on a diet of non-alignment and a scepticism of Israel, said. 

 They wondered what qualifications Singh would insert to take care of their sentiments when he speaks on Bushs visit in Parliament on Monday.

 The Congress tried to make the best of the situation even as its ministers were badgered with questions on what India had gained and lost in the deal and how they would counter the Left campaign in the Assembly elections.

 A cabinet minister, who till yesterday was hoping the deal would be aborted, wistfully said path-breaking moves never get accepted immediately. There are no short-term gains. We will see the benefits five or 10 years later. He cited three policy milestones associated with Congress regimes to make his point ? Rajiv Gandhis technology mission, panchayati raj and economic liberalisation. 

 In his briefing, Congress spokesman Rajeev Shukla claimed that the deal would give a fillip to the bijli, sadak, paani agenda. 

 To counter the perception that Singh was cosying far too much to Bush, Shukla said: The government dealt with the US and not an individual. He whipped out the initial reactions in the US press about the US selling itself to India and the devil lurking in the details of the disastrous N-deal to shore up the contention that Singh hadnt done too badly for himself. 

 A minister known for his anti-US stance said: ?this much I gathered that India will be the USs strongest ally in this region against two of its biggest threats: the Islamic block and China. Bush is praising our record in democracy and religious pluralism. 

 But, in the next breath he asked: If I was to use the last point in my campaign, my voters can ask, why does an age-old party like the Congress need a certificate from Bush? I have no answers.

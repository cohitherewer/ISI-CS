The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Atal, Advani dropped from BJPs A-list

 POORNIMA JOSHI

 Vajpayee, Advani 

 New Delhi, May 19: The 

 BJPs almost religious belief in symbols and fables 

 seems to have reached ludicrous levels of late.

 Much is being read into the BJPs official telephone directory circulated among party workers recently. The short directory is revised every year and gives an indication of where everyone is placed in the party hierarchy.

 In what is largely seen as a pointer to their irrelevance, the names of L.K. Advani and Atal Bihari Vajpayee have been deleted not just from the book jacket but also from the top leaders list.

 In last years phone book, Advanis name was listed on the front page. The book jacket carried both their pictures with prophetic statements outlining their vision for the party.

 We want to truly integrate the nation, said Vajpayee in last years phone book. We believe that through dedication and perseverance, we will realise national unity and create a new India of our dreams.

 Advani had stressed the need to wipe out the dark curse of poverty. No country can be great if its people remain poor. The first task before us ? before the BJP as well as the nation ? is to wipe out the dark curse of poverty, his statement read.

 But much has happened since the phone book was printed last year. Advani is no longer party president and Vajpayee is barely coherent on most occasions. The new president, Rajnath Singh, has been vaguely trying to assert himself while Advani is ruthlessly crushing all his feeble efforts.

 Against this background has come the new phone book that has deleted Advanis and Vajpayees pictures and messages and relegated them to the common MPs status on the back pages. 

 Vajpayees name crops up in the Uttar Pradesh MPs section while Advani makes his appearance in the Gujarat MPs list.

 Large pictures of BJP ideologues Shyama Prasad Mookerjee and Deen Dayal Upadhyay dot the book jacket. Their far-sighted statements replace Advanis and Vajpayees in bold letters. And Rajnath replaces Advani on the front page.

 Advani is reportedly not too pleased with the changes. Rajnath is said to be gleeful. The workers, meanwhile, are furiously engaged in discussing the symbolism reflected in each page of the latest phone book.

 Rajnath has finally been immortalised in print. Advani and Vajpayee are officially in the has been category. Perhaps, the party can now think of more basic things like getting its act together, said a worker.

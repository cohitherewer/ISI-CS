 Veil off Rajivs aborted Tiger plan

 M.R. VENKATESH

 Rajiv Gandhi

 Chennai, Aug. 19: Rajiv Gandhi had asked M. Karunanidhi to meet Tamil Tiger leader V. Prabhakaran in a jungle to negotiate a settlement at the peak of the Indian intervention in Lanka, the Tamil Nadu chief minister disclosed today.

 The revelation takes the wraps off a 17-year-old non-starter that could have prevented Rajivs assassination, changed the course of Indian politics and raised the possibility of lasting peace in Lanka, now back on the brink of civil war.

 Karunanidhi said the initiative could not make headway as Vaiko, who was then in the DMK, made a clandestine visit to the same jungle, Vavuniya, in northern Lanka.

 Vaikos cover was blown and an MPs trip to Lanka in the middle of Indian peacekeepers disarming of the Tigers triggered an uproar.

 The furore ensured that Karunanidhis proposed trip, never made public till now, was aborted, the chief minister told the Assembly today.

 Without blaming Vaiko, the DMK leader said he was compelled to make this disclosure after long years as Indias response to resolving the Tamil question in Lanka had to be inevitably looked at from the perspectives that prevailed when Rajiv was alive and after his assassination.

 Karunanidhi was responding to MDMK member Kannappans plea drawing attention to the exodus of Tamils from Lanka and Colombos criticism of an Assembly resolution condemning the bombing of an orphanage in which 61 girls were reported killed.

 Karunanidhi said the initiative was mooted by Rajiv in 1989 when he had gone to pay a courtesy call on the Prime Minister after the DMK returned to power in January.

 Rajiv Gandhi advised me to go to Colombo first and then to Vavuniya to meet Prabhakaran, either with Vaiko or with Murasoli Maran (the late Union commerce minister) or with both and asked me to finalise the dates for the visit and send it to the PMO on reaching Chennai, he said. 

 He also assured me that transport and logistical facilities needed will be arranged.

 The following day, K. Natwar Singh, then foreign secretary, was deputed by Rajiv to meet me in Tamil Nadu House in Delhi where we discussed the Lankan Tamil crisis at length, Karunanidhi added.

 Another meeting followed with the Prime Minister that afternoon, when, to my utter surprise, Rajiv Gandhi even praised Prabhakarans valour, the DMK leader added. 

 Prabhakaran is the prime accused in the assassination of Rajiv two years later but the Tigers have recently tried to distance themselves from it.

 Rajiv was assassinated in 1991 and hundreds of Indian soldiers died in the Lankan peacekeeping mission, considered Indias biggest misadventure abroad.

 The next day, just when all arrangements for our visit to Lanka was about to be made, Vaiko, after leaving a bland note for me, somehow managed to go to northern Lanka through some other way, Karunanidhi said. 

 I was deeply pained and embarrassed by this sudden turn of events and I immediately expressed my apology to Rajiv Gandhi, said the chief minister, whose partys alleged soft stand on the Tigers was cited by the Congress to topple the Gujral government in 1998.

 Vaikos trip rocked the Rajya Sabha where members asked how an MP could secretly visit a neighbouring country. Rajiv Gandhi was magnanimous even at that stage to say let us not worry about Vaiko going there, but he should return safely, recalled Karunanidhi. 

 I had another opportunity to meet Rajiv Gandhi in Chennai when he mentioned about his plans going awry then. The talk about the initiative mooted by Rajiv Gandhi ended there, never to be revived.

sought to crack case

 Thiruvananthapuram, Oct. 28: Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs scheduled visit to the southern district of Kollam in Kerala has been cancelled in the wake of a threatening email against him and President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam.

 Late tonight, a 26-year-old was detained in connection with the email. The suspect has been identified as Akbar Shah from Alappuzha in southern Kerala. 

 It is not clear whether the Prime Ministers original schedule will be revived if the detention and subsequent investigation prove that the email was a prank as the Centre was suggesting last night. 

 As of now, the rest of Singhs Kerala itinerary remains unchanged. He is scheduled to arrive on October 31 evening and leave the next day, after attending the Kerala Formation Day golden jubilee.

 He will attend all three programmes in Thiruvananthapuram as scheduled. His helicopter trip to Chavara in Kollam to lay the stone for a public sector titanium sponge unit has been called off following objections by security officials, chief minister V.S. Achuthanandan said today.

 Earlier in the day, police had released a sketch of a youth they suspect had sent emails to some 40 police officers from an Internet cafe in Kochi, threatening to assassinate the Prime Minister and the President.

 The deputy inspector-general of police, K. Padma Kumar, who is heading the probe in Kochi, had said the suspect could be in the 25-30 age group, fair and of average height.

 The polices cybercrime cell identified the computer from which the mails were sent and zeroed in on the suspect from details provided by the cafe staff.

 The investigating officers here contacted Microsofts MSN base in the US to get information on whether any messages other than the threatening emails had been sent from the ID created by the suspect. 

 The US justice department was also contacted and a formal request made for the data as it was a matter of national security, the officials said. 

 Following the request, all messages in the inbox and outbox of the ID were sent to the police here, they said. 

 Investigations have revealed the email ID was created on October 26 at the cyber cafe at 2.30 pm. The messages were sent between 3.15 pm and 3.30 pm. From 2.30 pm to 4.15 pm, the suspect was at the cafe, the police said.

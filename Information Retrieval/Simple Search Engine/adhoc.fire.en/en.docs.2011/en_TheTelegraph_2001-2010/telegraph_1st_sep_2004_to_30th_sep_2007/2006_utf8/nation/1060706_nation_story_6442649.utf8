 Cong trader dilemma

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 5: Prodded by Sonia Gandhi to rein in prices and streamline the public distribution system, Congress chief ministers asked the Centre to empower them to crack down on market manipulators.

 The chief ministers who spoke at a meeting convened at the Congress presidents home blamed the price rise in some parts of the country on an executive order issued by the NDA government in 2002 to amend the Essential Commodities Act. 

 The order had eased curbs on movement and accumulation of essential commodities, which, according to Congress leaders, encouraged speculative purchases and hoarding.

 However, the chief ministers stopped short of demanding the revocation of the pro-trader order. 

 A resolution which was adopted said the order should be reconsidered, the state governments should be empowered to intervene in cases of hoarding and forward trading in essentials should be regulated to curb excessive speculation.

 Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy, the Andhra Pradesh chief minister, voiced the dilemma confronting the Congress: how not to antagonise the traders and yet ensure a fair deal to the farmers and consumers. We are only asking that traders should display the stocks they hold and the prices, he said.

 Sources said the chief ministers took agriculture minister Sharad Pawar, who was not present, to task for not anticipating the shortfall in foodgrain. There was a clamour that the Congress should take away this ministry from the Nationalist Congress Party.

 It is learnt that the Prime Minister ? who attended the meeting along with three senior colleagues ? while not supporting the view, emphasised that India should become self-sufficient and stop importing foodgrain.

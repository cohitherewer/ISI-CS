 Cash bait call for research

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 22: Indias science academies have called for changes in science and technology education integrated BSc-MSc courses, a two-year BTech degree programme open to science graduates and monetary incentives to entice students into research careers.

 A document, submitted by the Indian National Science Academy and the Indian Academy of Sciences to the Planning Commission ahead of the finalisation of the 11th Five-Year Plan, has asked for restructured courses in select universities and proposed incentives ranging from housing facilities to higher stipends.

 The proposals seek to promote a research culture in universities, said Tiruppattur Ramakrishnan, president of the Indian Academy of Sciences.

 Academy members say university science has steadily declined in recent years because of a drop in the number of talented people opting for science and because of existing internal recruitment policies.

 Theres pressure on PhD students in India to do post-doctoral research outside India, said Subhash Lakhotia, a senior zoologist at the Banaras Hindu University. The best go abroad and most who return want to spend all time on research and dont want to teach. We need to develop a post-doctoral culture in Indian universities.

 Senior academy members said the existing science education system in India virtually ensures uncertainty in a students career for some six years after an MSc degree. A student completes the post-doctoral programme and is ready to settle down in the late 20s or early 30s, said a member of the academy in Bangalore.

 Besides urging higher stipends, the academies have proposed teaching assistantships for PhD students similar to the ones that US universities offer graduate students and housing facilities. Ramakrishnan said other science agencies have also made similar proposals.

 The academies have suggested that 20 select engineering colleges be allowed to admit BSc students for a two-year BTech course in areas that require skills in both science and technology.

 Having sent off the proposals, both science academies are now contemplating reaching out to the public.

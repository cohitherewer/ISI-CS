 The job: push destruct button 

 - The 

 rocket man with an unenviable task 

 ANIL BUDUR LULLA

 Bangalore, July 10: On June 28, scientists at the Sriharikota space port were excited about todays launch of the GSLV carrying the Insat-4C payload.

 One of the rocket men, range safety officer Krishnamurthy, was busy explaining that he is paid for a job he would never want to do: destroy the launch vehicle if anything goes wrong after lift-off.

 His only job is to push the button to detonate and disintegrate the massive launch vehicle so that it does not plummet back on earth, in case something goes wrong.

 Today, something did go wrong at the first stage of separation. Applause at the majestic lift-off turned into horror as scientists watched the launch vehicle deviate from its pre-determined path and milli-seconds later, burst into flames.

 Scientists at the master control centre, which monitors the health of the satellite and controls the lift-off sequence, are in charge for only about 17 minutes, by which time the launch vehicle ? powered by four liquid strap-on boosters, a solid propellant engine and a cryogenic stage ? would have put the satellite into the orbit.

 As a range safety officer, my job is to check if the rocket is on course. Otherwise, if there is a potential threat, I am authorised to destroy it by remote, Krishnamurthy had told The Telegraph earlier. Today, he probably did just that.

 The launch window for the Insat-4C was kept open between July 10 and 15. The designated lift-off time was 4 pm, but it took off an hour later.

 The last time a satellite was launched at Sriharikota, it was stalled with just 1.5 seconds remaining as one of the four strap-on boosters failed to rev up the thrust of over 70 per cent required for a perfect lift-off. The new, second launchpad from where the GSLV took off today is custom-made and indigenous. This is the first time that a GSLV is being launched from here. Earlier last year, a PSLV was successfully launched from the pad.

 With a mission life of 10 years, Insat-4C would have joined a constellation of Indian National Satellites (Insat) orbiting space.

 Insat is one of the largest domestic communication satellite systems in the Asia-Pacific region. The other satellites in operation are Insat-2E, 3A, 3C, 3E, 4A, Kalpana-1, GSAT-2 and Edusat.

 The system provides services in telecommunication, television broadcasting, meteorology, including disaster warning, tele-education and telemedicine. It has 175 transponders for communication services, besides Met instruments. Its capability would have been enhanced further as Insat-4C would have provided DTH television services.

 The GSLV stands tall at 49 metres and weighed 414 tonnes at lift-off. It is a three-stage vehicle. The first stage has a core motor with 138 tonnes of solid propellants and four strap-on motors, each with 42 tonnes of liquid propellants. The second has 39 tonnes of liquid propellants. The third is a cryogenic stage with 12.6 tonnes of liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen.

 The vehicle is guided through a predetermined trajectory and its performance is monitored through telemetry and tracking. GSLV also employs separation systems to split the various stages after the propellants are exhausted. The disaster occurred at the first stage of separation.

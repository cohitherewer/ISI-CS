Calcutta, Dec. 8: The death of a 45-year-old Indian diamond merchant in Belgium during a police raid has shaken the Indian community in Antwerp, the diamond capital of the world. 

 Nikhil Manilal, managing director of Beltaj NV part of Gem Star Company with presence across the globe suffered a cardiac arrest on Wednesday morning after a team of eight police officers reached his Wilrijk home in Antwerps suburbs with a search warrant.

 We have learnt that Nikhil complained of cardiac pain, but the police ignored his plea to call his wife and carried on with their investigation, said an Antwerp-based Indian diamond trader on condition of anonymity. 

 Apparently, the police did call an ambulance, but Nikhil died before he could be given cardiac care. 

 While the police account of the incident is still not available, the fact that the dying man was not allowed to meet his wife has spread like wildfire among the 500-plus Indian families in Antwerp, evoking strong reaction. 

 The raid was financial in nature. So, the police could have allowed his wife to arrange for some cardiac care. But the police called up the judge, who told them to carry on with the investigation. They did not stop even after he collapsed. It is so inhuman, added the diamond trader, echoing the majority feeling. 

 The sudden death of Nikhil has once again brought to centre stage the growing differences between diamond merchants and the Belgian authorities. 

 Around 90 per cent of people involved with the diamond trade in Antwerp are foreigners, primarily Indians and Jews. Indians dominate 60 per cent of Antwerps flourishing rough and polished diamond trade that reported a turnover of $36 billion. 

 I feel the government is unnecessarily harassing the Indian diamond community said Calcutta-based couture jeweller Raj Mahtani from Satramdas Dhalamal. 

 According to Mahtani, who was in Antwerp between 1990 and 1995, Indians are paying a price for making it big in the diamond trade, keeping the price index low through price competition and removing middlemen from the trade. 

 Tax rates and transparency in reporting business volumes have been some of the thorny issues between the merchants and the Belgian authorities. 

 In an act of solidarity, the grief-stricken diamond industry has called a four-day strike starting today.

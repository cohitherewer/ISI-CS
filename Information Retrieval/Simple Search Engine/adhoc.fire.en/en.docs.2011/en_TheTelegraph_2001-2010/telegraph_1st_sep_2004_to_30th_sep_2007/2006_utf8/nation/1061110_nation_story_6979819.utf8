 Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has fallen into the trap of impersonators. There are three fake profiles with photographs and other details of Bhattacharya doing the rounds on Orkut, an online friends network.

 The profile is attracting visitors, from hardcore criminals to college students, and comments scrap in Orkut parlance. Impersonation is the rule of the game as Bhattacharyas scrapbook, where one can post comments, has scraps even from serial killer Hubba Shyamal, who is in jail.

 Others write with requests ranging from jobs to favourable postings some in jest. But the most common expression is that of surprise, with the majority unable to believe that the chief minister is spending time Orkuting.

 Getting a response from the chief minister in the virtual world is easier than extracting a reply from Writers Buildings. Besides, his impersonators are trying to open a channel of communication with his political rival Mamata Banerjee. Bhattacharya has been found posting scraps on the Trinamul Congress leaders scrapbook.

 Someone has prepared the Trinamul leaders profile with care. It claims that her political view is centrist, sense of humour is obscure and fashion preference is alternative. 

 Although voters deserted Mamata during the last Assembly elections, the profile of Agnikanya some scrappers call her by that name is drawing visitors in hordes.

 The impersonators have not focused on leaders from Bengal alone. Profiles of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and his cabinet colleague Lalu Prasad have also been created. 

 The Prime Ministers profile boasts he is clever and quick-witted, while Lalu Prasad tells the world that his favourite sport is gilli-danda.

 Osama bin Laden is the other favourite among the impersonators. Osamas profile reveals his present location is Afghanistan. He has also admitted: I am the terror.

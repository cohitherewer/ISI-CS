 New Delhi, Feb. 22: At least four out of every 10 MiG 21 aircraft with the Indian Air Force (IAF) crash. This startling figure was revealed in statistics presented to Parliament in an answer by defence minister Pranab Mukherjee today.

 The grim statistic is also a measure of just how the IAF has to cope with tragedy after tragedy with the outdated MiG 21 air defence fighter. Faulty policies, tardy acquisitions and obsolete technology take a heavy toll on the fighting fleet but the government and air headquarters still maintain that the aircraft has to serve beyond its shelf life.

 In January, the defence establishment vetted the Aamir Khan starrer Rang De Basanti that focuses attention on the problem of the MiG 21. The film, loosely adapted from the real-life story of a crusade by the mother of a MiG 21 pilot (Abhijit Gadgil) who was killed in a crash, is now a hit.

 In a written reply to Jaya Bachchan, Pranab Mukherjee said today that out of the 793 MiG 21 aircraft that were inducted into the IAF since 1963, it has lost 330 ? about 41.60 per cent ? in accidents. The MiG 21 aircraft make up the bulk of the IAFs fighter fleet.

 Mukherjee said earlier versions of the MiG 21 aircraft ? Type 77, Type 96 and Type 75 Bis ? are in the process of being phased out. The latest version called the MiG 21 Bison with modern avionics would be in service till 2020, he said.

 No figure was available on human casualties as a result of MiG 21 accidents since the aircraft was inducted.

 In another reply, Mukherjee said that in 2005-06, nine accidents were reported. This is the least number of air accidents in a single year recorded by the IAF.

 A continuous and multi-faceted effort is always underway in the IAF to enhance and upgrade flight safety. Measures to enhance the quality of training to improve the skill levels, ability to exercise sound judgement and situational awareness of pilots are being pursued. Constant interaction with Hindustan Aeronautics Limited and original equipment manufacturers of concerned countries are also maintained to overcome the technical defects of the aircraft. Besides, anti-bird measures are also undertaken, Mukherjee said in a written reply to N.P. Durga in the Rajya Sabha. 

 He claimed that the IAF is moving towards achieving the flight safety standards of the advanced air forces of the world and it is a continuing exercise.

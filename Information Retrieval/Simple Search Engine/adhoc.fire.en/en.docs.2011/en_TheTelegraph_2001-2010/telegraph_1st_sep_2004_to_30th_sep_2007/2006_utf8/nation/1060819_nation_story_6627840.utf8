The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Row over NCERT books

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 18: A bunch of NCERT books raised a storm in the Rajya Sabha today with MPs objecting to their contents.

 Minister of state for parliamentary affairs Suresh Pachauri assured the members that their feelings would be conveyed to the ministry concerned and the books that had been laid on the table of the House would be examined.

 BJP leader Ravishankar Prasad raised the issue during zero hour, flashing the offending textbooks published by the National Council for Education and Research and Training (NCERT) for schools. 

 He read out some passages from the books, which referred to Jats as robbers and Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Aurobindo Ghosh and Bipin Chandra Pal as terrorists.

 Bipan Chandras book (on modern Indian history) was reintroduced and revised. The book accuses Jats of robbery. Whats worse, it calls Lokmanya Tilak, Aurobindo Ghosh and Bipin Chandra Pal terrorists, the BJP MP said.

 The books should get published, but the kind of books NCERT is publishing is causing harm to the nation and children, he added.

 Congress spokesperson Satyavrat Chaturvedi and CPM MP Sitaram Yechury, too, expressed concern. This is a very urgent matter and I request the government to conduct a probe into how these books have come about. This requires immediate action, Yechury said.

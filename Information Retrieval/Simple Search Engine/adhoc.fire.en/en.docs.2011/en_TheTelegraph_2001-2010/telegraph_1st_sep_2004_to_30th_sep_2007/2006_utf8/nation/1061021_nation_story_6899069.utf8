 Pension blow to casual staff wife

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 20: The wife of a government employee, who dies before being accorded permanent status in service, cannot claim family pension and other terminal benefits, the Supreme Court has ruled.

 Setting aside a Rajasthan High Court order, a bench headed by Justice Arijit Pasayat said such benefits would be available only to families of employees who enjoyed permanent status at the time of death.

 Only benefits specified by rules meant for casual labourers could be claimed, the apex court said, allowing an appeal by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research.

 The high court had upheld a central administrative tribunal order directing the council to provide all benefits to the wife of the casual labourer who had acquired temporary status under a central government scheme.

 The tribunal held that the wife of Durga Lal was entitled to family pension and other benefits. It treated her husband as having been regularised on the day of his death. 

 In its appeal against the tribunals order before the apex court, the council said Lal was not a permanent employee, but only a casual labourer who had acquired temporary status after the central government announced the Casual Labourers (Grant of Temporary Status and Regularisation) Scheme in 1993.

 Lals wife, however, contended that her husband had worked for nearly 20 years a period long enough to be deemed as having been in regular service, even if there was no formal order granting him permanent status. 

 The council said the scheme under which Lal was granted temporary status also prescribes the service benefits, but family pension was not among them.

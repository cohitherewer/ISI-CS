 100 kg of explosives seized

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Srinagar, Sept. 20: The army seized a huge cache of explosives from a hideout in the border district of Kupwara today.

 Defence spokesman Col. Hemant Juneja said this evening that the army busted a jungle hideout of the militants in the Kupwara border district on Wednesday in which 100 kg of explosives, 124 detonators, and 14 IEDs were recovered.

 This is one of the largest quantities of explosives seized from the district recently.

 It could be RDX, he said.

 No militant was present at the spot when the operation took place.

 A senior police officer said militants had dumped the explosives in the hideout for use in subversive activities they planned in the valley. 

 Also in the same district, a woman worker of frontline Lashkar-e- Toiba (LeT) was arrested along with an accomplice identified as Aamir Malik from Lam Audoora Mawar village. 

 A police spokesman here said the two had gone to attend a meeting of LeT there.

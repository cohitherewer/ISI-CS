 New Delhi, May 23: Amid vociferous protests by BJP members, the Lok Sabha today took an unprecedented step by admonishing its former secretary-general Subash C. Kashyap for his remarks against Speaker Somnath Chatterjee.

 The motion to admonish Kashyap for gross breach of privilege was passed by a voice vote even as the BJP members continued chanting: Loktantra mein tanashahi nahi chalegi, dadagiri nahi chalegi, Nadir Shahi nahi chalegi (in a democracy dictatorship, bullying and behaving like Nadir Shah will not help). 

 Kashyap was not present at the bar of the House when the motion was adopted. 

 The motion was moved by Leader of the House Pranab Mukherjee just before the over-three-month-long budget session was adjourned sine die. 

 The BJP was so upset with the motion that four of its members in the Lok Sabhas Privileges Committee today resigned from it in protest.

 The Privileges Committee, in its report tabled on May 19, had recommended admonishing of Kashyap for committing a gross breach of privilege and contempt of the House by imputing motives to the Speaker in discharge of his duties and casting reflections on his impartiality.

 BJP deputy leader V.K. Malhotra took exception to the listed motion saying the committees report had not come up at the Business Advisory Committee meeting. 

 The treasury benches and other allies of the UPA shouted counter-slogans. As the din continued, the Speaker first adjourned the House till noon and then again till 2 pm. The House was adjourned sine die when it reassembled after the second adjournment. 

 Kashyap had commented on the Speakers decision to disallow an adjournment motion notice given by Trinamul Congress leader Mamata Banerjee on the ground that the House could not take up an issue which had already been discussed and decided in the same session. 

 Speaking to a TV channel about the incident, Kashyap had said: Well, it has a personal aspect also which should not be forgotten. When Mamata Banerjee was elected to the Lok Sabha for the first time, she had defeated Somnath Chatterjee.

 He had further gone on to challenge the Speakers decision, saying there are many instances when discussions on the same subject have been held twice or more during the same session. Kashyap, however, could not substantiate this point before the Privileges Committee.

 As the Lok Sabha today concluded on a bad note, the government and the Congress launched a scathing attack on the BJP, accusing it of bringing a new low in the history of Parliament by targeting the Speaker and using abusive language against him.

 It was an ugly demonstration of the deep-rooted frustration within the BJP on three counts: the recent rath yatra turning a big flop, election outcome in various states and the recent crisis in Jharkhand, parliamentary affairs minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi said.

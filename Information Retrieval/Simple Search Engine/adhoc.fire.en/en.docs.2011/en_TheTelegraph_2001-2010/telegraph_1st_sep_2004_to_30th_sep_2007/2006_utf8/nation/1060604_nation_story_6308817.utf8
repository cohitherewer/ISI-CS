 Quota reports by July 31

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Bangalore, June 3: The five sub-committees, constituted by the oversight committee on reservation to study the impact of the proposed 27 per cent OBC quota in higher education, will submit their reports by July 31.

 Oversight committee chairman M. Veerappa Moily said here that the sub-committees would look into admissions in IITs, IIMs, agricultural institutes, central universities and health sciences. The sub- committees have the countrys best brains, he added.

 The former Karnataka chief minister said the oversight committee would initiate a dialogue with the best brains in the country and evolve innovative methods for excellence in higher education.

 The oversight committee has already met twice and Moily is expected to hold discussions with the sub-committee members on June 8. On the basis of reports submitted by them, the oversight committee is expected to frame a comprehensive roadmap for achieving a knowledge society based on inclusive policy. It will submit its recommendations to the government by August 31, Moily said.

 Stoutly defending the proposed 27 per cent reservation for OBCs in higher educational institutions, Moily said the government favoured increasing the number of seats so that meritorious students are not impacted by reservation. It has already been announced that the new reservation policy will be introduced from the 2007-08 academic year.

 According to Moily, the southern states had made the highest contribution to the countrys GDP growth despite the existing reservation system, including Tamil Nadus 69 per cent, which clearly showed quota had not affected talent.

 He argued it was a wrong notion that the backward classes lacked talent and eligibility. Reservation has not affected the productivity in states like Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, he added.

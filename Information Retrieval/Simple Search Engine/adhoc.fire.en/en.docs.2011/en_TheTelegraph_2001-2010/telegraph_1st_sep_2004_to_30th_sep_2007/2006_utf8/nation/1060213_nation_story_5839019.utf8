 Student charged

 Houston, Feb. 12 (PTI): A 22-year-old Indian student accused of stabbing his female professor over poor grades has been charged with intent to murder.

 A Middlesex county grand jury charged Nikhil Dhar, a senior at the University of Massachusetts at Lowell, last week with armed assault with intent to murder and battery with a dangerous weapon, causing serious body injury.

 Police sources said Dhar stabbed Mary Elizabeth Hooker, an associate professor of clinical lab sciences at her Fresh Pond home on December 22 after he followed her from the university, where she taught science.

 The police arrested a blood-spattered Dhar in a nearby yard with the help of cellphone calls from Hookers neighbours. 

 Dhar has been ruled dangerous by a judge and will remain in jail until trial.

 Friends and acquaintances of Dhar still cannot believe the incident and said they were shocked to hear that the reserved student, an elected senator on the student government, had been arrested and charged in the attack of a professor.

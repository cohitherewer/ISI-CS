 Foreign varsities in quota bother

 Bill Blokade?

 New Delhi, March 31: The 93rd constitutional amendment bill, which has extended seat reservation in central universities and professional institutions to students from other backward classes, could open a Pandoras box.

 At present, reservation exists only for scheduled caste and scheduled tribe students.

 Foreign universities wishing to set up campuses in India may now have to reserve seats for SC/ST students as well as those from the OBCs.

 The foreign universities bill, being thrashed out by the law ministry, has made it clear that institutions setting up campuses in India will be given national and not preferential treatment. This means foreign universities wishing to set up wings in the country will have to follow the same rules that apply to Indian entities, both government and private. 

 There are now three categories of universities ? those mandated by Parliament, by the state government and those that come in the category of deemed universities. Foreign universities are likely to be clubbed under the last category.

 The Centre is bringing the bill to regulate foreign institutions that want to take advantage of the market that exists in India, particularly if the human resource development ministry decides to open up higher education in the World Trade Organisations General Agreement on Trade in Services.

 Sources in the HRD ministry said education is not for commerce and profit and the issue of foreign universities is not just about academics but also about socio-political ramifications.

 It was said that the Sarva Siksha Abhiyan, a key programme for universalising elementary education, has broken new ground in terms of increase in enrolment in the 6-14 age group. 

 The officials said once this huge pool completes secondary education, they will be eligible for higher education. At present, India has merely 8.97 per cent students doing higher education. 

 In China, 15 per cent students are in higher education and in Malaysia the figure is 23 per cent. Developed countries like the UK has a 45 per cent enrolment figure while in Australia, it is as high as 70 per cent.

 Genetic tomato for soldiers

 New Delhi, March 27 (PTI): Aimed at providing fresh vegetables to soldiers posted in high-altitude areas like Siachen, the government today said it was developing transgenic tomatoes, which could grow in cold environment of the Himalayas. 

 One of the DRDO laboratories at high-altitude in (the) Himalayas has undertaken the development of transgenic tomato which can grow in the cold environment to provide fresh vegetable to our soldiers, defence minister Pranab Mukherjee said.

 He said the country needed a second green revolution to meet the challenges of the growing population not only in India but at the global level.

 This can be accomplished by identifying the plant genes responsible for drought resistance, pest resistance, saline tolerance and cold tolerance and then develop genetically engineered transgenic plants for our specific needs, he said.

 In view of limited sources of conventional energy and availability of vast resource of biomass in the country, the defence minister said india needed to focus its research and development to commercial extraction of energy from biomass.

 Bio fuel using plant sources or ethanol and also the blue green algae, which can produce hydrogen gas for use in fuel cell, can contribute to meet the energy needs, he said. Pti acb pp 03271514 del

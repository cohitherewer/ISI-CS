 Congress grapples with UP headache

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 10: The Congress may have had the satisfaction of winning three of the 12 mayoral seats in Uttar Pradesh and making some gains in Rae Bareli and Amethi, but there is much for the party to worry about.

 Loss of seats in practically all the Lok Sabha constituencies held by the Congress (barring Mathura, Amethi and Rae Bareli), infighting, a possible revival of communal votebanks and a consolidation of upper-caste votes the party has to grapple with all of this.

 In at least three constituencies Kanpur, Aligarh and Bansgaon the official candidate faced opposition from within the party, either from the sitting MP or his rivals. 

 Aligarh MP Bijendra Singh publicly declared the mayoral nominee, Sushil Chowdhury, to be an RSS agent. 

 Vivek Bansal, the national secretary and Aligarh MLA, said four tickets for the citys municipality and town planning body elections were given to minority community members. But Singh wanted a minority community nominee for the mayors post as well.

 This would have polarised the election on religious lines. We secured the Hindu votes with so much difficulty in the last Lok Sabha polls that we did not want them to return to the BJP, Bansal argued.

 When Chowdhurys candidature was announced, Singh and his supporters went to town alleging he had RSS links. The allegation reportedly sent the minorities scurrying to the Samajwadi Party and the hardcore Hindutva voters to the BJP. 

 Congress sources said Chowdhury, a businessman, had only once contributed to the BJPs kitty and had a long association with them as a Youth Congress activist. 

 In Kanpur, too, the opposition to the mayoral nominee, Badrinarayan Tiwari, was on the grounds of his RSS connection. Tiwari had the support of local MP and Union minister of state for home, Sriprakash Jaiswal, but the local party unit was against him. 

 If our workers are going to hold a persons religion against him, then god help our party. Tiwari is on the board of a temple trust and if that is how Hindutva is defined, then its too bad, a source said. Again, both Muslims and Hindus turned away from the Congress. 

 As in Kanpur, in Bansgaon, too, the local MP is a minister but his support did not help the mayoral candidate. 

 Reservation was another issue at work silently, sources said. In Hapur, a satellite town of Delhi, workers attached to the MP, Surendra Prakash Goyal, reportedly defected to the BJP to consolidate the upper caste votes against the Samajwadi Party and the Independents, suspected to have the BSPs backing. 

 A section of the state Congress blamed HRD minister Arjun Singh for actively propagating his brand of backward caste politics. It has brought no benefit to us but has cost us dear, a source said.

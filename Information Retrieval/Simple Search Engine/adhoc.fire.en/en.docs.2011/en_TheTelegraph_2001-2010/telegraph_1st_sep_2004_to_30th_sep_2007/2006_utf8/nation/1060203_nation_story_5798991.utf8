 RS poll plea

 New Delhi, Feb. 2 (PTI) Former Rajya Sabha member Kuldip Nayar today moved the Supreme Court, seeking to restrain the Election Commission from issuing notification for conducting polls for the 60 seats of the Upper House that will fall vacant between February and June 2006.

 Nayar, whose PIL challenging an amendment to Section 3 of the Representation of Peoples Act, 1951 ? which scraps the domicile requirement for Rajya Sabha candidates ? is pending before a Constitution bench, urged the court to take up the matter at an early date as the vacant seats are likely to be filled up soon. 

 Appearing for Nayar, senior counsel Fali S. Nariman submitted that apart from domicile, there was also the issue of secret ballot, which was done away with by the same amendment during the NDA rule.

 The court said the matter would be taken up in the last week of February.

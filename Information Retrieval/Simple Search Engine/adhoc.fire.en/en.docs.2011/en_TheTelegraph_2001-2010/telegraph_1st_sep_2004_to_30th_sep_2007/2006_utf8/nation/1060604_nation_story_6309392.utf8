 Praveen cool, wife wary

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, June 3: As the late Pramod Mahajans family grappled with its overdose of crisis, the man who started it all did not seem surprised.

 Officials of Arthur Road Jail, where Praveen Mahajan is lodged for fatally shooting his brother Pramod, said he reportedly told some inmates that this had to happen.

 It is Bibek (Moitra) who is solely responsible for ruining our entire family. He has got what he deserved. This is retribution, a jail source quoted Praveen as saying.

 In his statement to Mumbai police after shooting his brother, Praveen had mentioned being ill-treated by Bibek and other aides of Pramod.

 He, however, seems to hold no grudges against his nephew Rahul and is reportedly quite concerned. Since his cell has no television or access to newspapers, he is quite anxious about his nephews news, said a jail official.

 Mumbai police sources said they had information that a Delhi police team, due to arrive in the city to investigate the Rahul-Bibek case, might interrogate Praveen.

 In Thane, a resident of Jinja apartment, where Praveens wife Sarangi lives with her children and her mother, said security guards have been told not to allow anyone into her house. 

 She has also requested the society not to allow any mediaperson on the premises, the resident added.

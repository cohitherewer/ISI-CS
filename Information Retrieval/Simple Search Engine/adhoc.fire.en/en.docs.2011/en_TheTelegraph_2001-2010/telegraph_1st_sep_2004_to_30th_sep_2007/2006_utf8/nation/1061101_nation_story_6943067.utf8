 New Delhi, Oct. 31 (PTI): The sealing drive against unauthorised commercial establishments in the capital will resume from Thursday despite the state government deciding to approach the Supreme Court to seek relief for traders who are on a three-day strike since yesterday.

 The Municipal Corporation of Delhi today moved court, which has ordered the drive, seeking protection for over 44,000 traders who have given an undertaking to voluntarily close their commercial establishments in residential areas.

 The Union urban development ministry has said it would probably go to the apex court tomorrow against the resumption of the civic bodys action.

 On the second day of the strike, when some of the major markets under threat remained closed, the court-appointed monitoring committee recommended that the drive, scheduled to be resumed from tomorrow, should be put off by a day. 

 It also suggested that the court should ask the Centre to provide adequate police force for the drive to ensure safety of the sealing teams.

 The committee also said the corporation and the police should be directed to videograph the sealing operations and events like violent speeches by political leaders and traders inciting people.

 India gets its own GM cotton

 G.S. MUDUR

New Delhi, April 5: Cotton plants genetically 

modified by scientists at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, and an 

Indian company are set to become Indias first homegrown GM crops approved 

for commercial release.

 The cotton, jointly developed by IIT Kharagpur and JK Agri Genetics in Hyderabad, is among GM crops approved yesterday by the governments Genetic Engineering Approval Committee (GEAC), a top official said.

 This will be the first GM crop technology from India for commercial release, Desh Deepak Verma, co-chairman of the GEAC told The Telegraph. 

 All genetically engineered varieties of cotton that have been under cultivation in India since 2000 are based on technology developed by the US biotechnology giant, Monsanto, and licensed or sublicensed to various seed companies in India, he said.

 All GM cotton approved for cultivation in India contains genes from the bacteria Bacillus thurigiensis (Bt) that allow the crops to protect themselves from pests.

 The technology was entirely generated here using Bt from India, said Soumitra Sen, head of the Biotechnological Research and Extension Foundation at IIT Kharagpur. 

 Sen and his colleagues have also been working on GM rice, brinjal and tomato. However, none of these plants is ready for commercial cultivation yet.

 Were also working on a new generation of GM cotton that could resist a wider range of caterpillar pests than the first-generation Bt cotton, Sen said.

 The GEAC also approved today another cotton variety based on Chinese technology, Verma said.

 The latest approvals come amid what activists claim are irregularities and violations of biosafety guidelines during trials of cotton and other GM crops.

 Greenpeace had earlier this year organised a meeting where farmers admitted they had sold GM cotton from field trials that should have been destroyed at the end of the trials. Some farmers did not separate GM crop from other crops as required under safety rules.

 Activists said one farmer in Andhra Pradesh even admitted that he cooked and ate GM okra (bhindi). A senior member of the GEAC said field trial rules are supposed to be made clear to participating farmers, and allegations of violations will be investigated. A few farmers might have become greedy, but a few isolated violations should not vitiate the entire process, the member said.

 The indigenous GM cotton is based on joint research by IIT Kharagpur and JK Agri Genetics. 

 The IIT team incorporated genes into cotton lines provided by us, a top company official said. Theres been no foreign technology input, he said. This cotton has been undergoing field trials for the past two years, he added.

 Biotechnology industry analysts expect that the entry of indigenous varieties of GM cotton will reduce the market prices of these products.

 Activists evaluating the performance of GM cotton that has been under cultivation have claimed that while the yields of non-Bt cotton are marginally lower than Bt-cotton, the cost of cultivation of Bt cotton is higher than that of non-Bt cotton.

 Development funds freeze

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 2: The Election Commission has directed the Centre and the five poll-bound states not to release funds under local area development schemes, of both MPs and state legislators, until the Assembly election process is complete.

 Bengal, Assam, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Pondicherry will go to polls from April 3. 

 The budget session of Parliament could also be rescheduled for the elections. Instead of having the second half of the session in April, it may be put off till after the elections conclude on May 8. 

 The finance bill, however, may be passed before Parliament breaks up for recess in March as a rule stipulates that there should not be more than a 75-day gap between the introduction and passage of the bill. 

 In todays poll panel communication, the Centre and the governments in the five poll-bound states were instructed to impress upon ministers and authorities not to announce grants, lay foundation stones or make ad-hoc appointments in government and PSUs.

 The commission said no fresh work should start under the local area development schemes, but work that had already begun could continue. There would be no bar on payments for completed work, subject to the full satisfaction of the concerned officials, the poll panel said.

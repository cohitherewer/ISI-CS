 By God! Tirupati asks stars to stay away

 Hyderabad, Dec. 26: If a frown darkens the face of Hema Malini or Madhuri Dixit for the next two weeks, blame Lord Balaji.

 Both actresses as well as Sridevi and Meenakshi Sheshadri had to cancel their trips to Tirumala on Sunday after the Tirumala Tirupati Dewasthanam chairman advised them to stay away.

 Sridevi and Hema had planned to walk the 22 kilometres to the hill town of Tirumala from Tirupati on Sunday, taking a leaf out of Aishwarya Rais book. But the temple authorities said they could not provide them special treatment because of a record rush.

 Another 300 VIPs from 10 states who had sent in requests for special darshan in the run-up to the new year, or on Vaikunta Ekadasi that falls on January 1, have received the same advice.

 I appeal to all VIPs, including film stars, politicians and industrialists. Please do not come to Tirupati till the second week of January. We cannot facilitate you at all, Dewasthanam chairman B. Karunakar Reddy appealed with folded hands in TV advertisements and interviews to all the channels on Sunday.

 Against our capacity to accommodate 44,000 people, we have been receiving over 1.5 lakh devotees since Sunday. More than two lakh people have been waiting for two days in queues around the temple, Reddy said.

 The crush, with devotees eager to start the new year with Balajis blessings or just taking advantage of the school holidays, has brought Tirupatis infrastructure close to a collapse.

 The hordes arriving in buses, trains and cars have kept each of the twin queues stretching beyond 5 km for the past week.

 And they have forced the premier shrine known for drawing the countrys whos who where the privileged can jump the miles-long queues to shut its doors to the VIPs in favour of hoi polloi, if only for a while.

 Even the godmen and their followers have been told not to come with demands for special pujas.

 We have suspended all special tickets and special pujas this year-end, said Tridandi Sri Ramanuja Jeer, a monk.

 Tens of thousands are standing in the queues braving the chilly winter. Thousands of others are sleeping on the roadsides and the bus stands. Restaurants and hotels are chock-a-block.

 The Dewasthanam is providing free food to all devotees round the clock, said the temples executive officer, A.P.V.N. Sharma.

 Nearly 1.5 lakh people had darshan on Sunday, the number going up to almost 1.62 lakh on Monday.

 We are trying our best to accommodate everyone, but our hands are tied. After all, we cannot allow darshan 24 hours a day, Sharma said. The temple is open for darshan for about 18 hours a day.

 Hundreds of cars and taxis are stranded on the hill road leading to Tirumala as the authorities allow just one vehicle to enter for every vehicle leaving the 30-square-km town.

 The state government has rushed a team of five IAS and IPS officers to supervise security. Special care is being taken to guard the cash and gold in the temple vaults and in the towns banks.

 It will take at least five days to clear the crowds. As for those still coming in, Balaji alone knows, another member of the temple executive said.

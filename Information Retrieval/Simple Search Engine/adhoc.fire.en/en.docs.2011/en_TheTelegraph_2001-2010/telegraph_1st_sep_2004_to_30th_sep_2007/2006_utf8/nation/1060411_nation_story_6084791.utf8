 Varsity notice

 New Delhi, April 10: The Supreme Court has issued notices to the Centre and the University Grants Commission on a PIL seeking to restrict the granting of deemed university status to only those institutions that have worldwide reputation of providing quality training, reports our legal correspondent.

 A bench headed by Justice Ruma Pal sought the response of the Centre and the UGC on the petition which also sought fresh guidelines to check misuse of the status by these institutes which open hundreds of centres across the country. 

 Advocate Viplav Sharma, who filed the petition, pointed out that there were over a 100 such universities in the country and many of them did not even have proper infrastructure. 

 The deemed university status is granted by the Centre on the advice of the UGC.

 Glare on crowded zoos

 New Delhi, Sept. 1: The Supreme Court today directed the Central Zoo Authority to give details on steps taken to prevent overcrowding of animals in zoos.

 A bench headed by Chief Justice Y.K. Sabharwal also asked state governments to respond within four weeks to the allegation that most zoos in the country do not have the stipulated medical facilities.

 The directives came during the hearing of a PIL by People for Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta), which alleged that the number of animals in zoos was much higher than that recommended by the zoo authority. In 159 recognised zoos in the country, there were 41,235 animals on March 31, 2004, as compared to 28,607 a year ago. 

 This was despite the fact that the apex court in 2000 had asked the government to take steps to avoid inbreeding and overcrowding in zoos. The authority, too, had said the number of tigers/panthers in big, medium and small zoos should not exceed 10, six and four, respectively, but several zoos were flouting the directive, Peta said.

 The petition further alleged that many zoos are not able to provide proper medical services because of lack of trained manpower.

 Five tigers and one leopard died allegedly due to babesiosis infection between July 9 and August 9 this year at Ranchis Birsa Munda Zoological Park, the NGO pointed out. Several deaths were also reported from Delhi zoo between 2005 and 2006.

 In its PIL, Peta has objected to breeding of non-critical endangered species in zoos. The inbred genetically crippled animals cannot be released in the wild, it said. 

 The government had declared in 1992 that the primary objective of operating a zoo was conservation of wildlife. The NGO contended that keeping animals like monkeys, nilgais, spotted deer, sambhar, bear and elephants was also contrary to that objective.

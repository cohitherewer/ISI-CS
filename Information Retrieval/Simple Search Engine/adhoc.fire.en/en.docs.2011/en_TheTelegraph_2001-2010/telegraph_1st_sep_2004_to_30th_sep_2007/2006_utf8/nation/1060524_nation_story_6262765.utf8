 Demolition law in Supreme Court

 New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Tuesday refused to stay the operation of a new law ending the demolition and sealing drive in the capital but decided to examine its legality, reports our legal correspondent.

 A vacation bench headed by Justice Arijit Passayat sought the response of the Union ministries of urban development and law and justice and the Municipal Corporation of Delhi on two public interest litigations challenging the constitutional validity of the Delhi Laws (Special Provisions) Act, 2006.

 We cannot stay the operation of the act, the bench said but added the effect of the law has to be examined.

 If we hold that the statute is bad, the sealing will continue, the court said when the petitioners counsel sought the stay on the desealing drive, which started today.

 The case will be heard again on July 17 by a bench headed by Chief Justice Y.K. Sabharwal.

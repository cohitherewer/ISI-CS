 Nigerians feel Rahul effect

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 5: Nigerians in Delhi could feel the side- effects of Rahul Mahajans alleged tryst with drugs with several hotel owners in Delhi today declaring that they would refuse accommodation to people from the West African nation in future.

 Many of the hotel owners at Paharganj, a favourite with low-budget backpackers visiting Delhi from around the world, cited bad experiences in dealings with Nigerians.

 In our experience, Nigerians seem to regularly get on the wrong side of the law. As a consequence, we get into trouble with police, said Rajesh Suri, a member of the Paharganj Bar and Hotel Owners Association.

 With Nigerians involved again in the high-profile Rahul Mahajan case, our hotels, which generally have quite a few of them, are getting a bad name, he added.

 The associations decision comes a day after three Nigerians were arrested in connection with the supply of drugs in the Rahul case.

 Abdullah, a Nigerian national supposedly in India for his higher studies, has been charged with providing the drugs that proved fatal for Pramod Mahajans secretary, the Bibek Moitra, and nearly claimed Rahuls life.

 Michael Gogo, another of those arrested on Sunday, is the son of a Nigerian diplomat in the city.

 In recent months, Delhi police have found the drug racket carried out under the protection of relatives and friends of African embassy officials. Embassy vehicles with (CD) number plates are used to escape police scrutiny.

 Obikawa Ahmed, a Nigerian staying in Paharganj, criticised the hotel associations the move, saying it would hit innocent Nigerians as well.

 Just because some of my countrymen have been involved in drug-trafficking and other crimes, it isnt correct that all of us get blacklisted, he said.

 According to Obikawa, most Nigerians come to India for studies, the system of education back home not being as good as here.

 Nigerians and other Africans have been coming to India because we see a society free of many of the ills back home, while it is not racist like some countries in the West. That perception may now change, unless the Indian government does something about such sweeping blacklisting of Nigerians, he said.

 Ajit Kumar, who runs Hotel Paradise, also in Paharganj, feels the hotel owners are justified and are helping police control drug-trafficking by their decision.

 Our decision is in the interest of all those interested in maintaining law and order in Delhi, he said.

 Delhi police arrested 12 Nigerians in 2005, and have taken seven into custody so far this year, for supplying cocaine.

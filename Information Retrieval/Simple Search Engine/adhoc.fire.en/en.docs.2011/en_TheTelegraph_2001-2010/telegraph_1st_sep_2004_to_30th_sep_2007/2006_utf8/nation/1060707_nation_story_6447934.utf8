 Farmers stall survey for power unit

 - Land Mayday call over PA system

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Durgapur, July 6: Responding to an appeal over the public address system from a place of worship, about 1,000 farmers gheraoed a team from the Power Development Corporation yesterday when it went to conduct a land survey in Katwa for a thermal power project.

 The farmers protested against the acquisition of nearly 1,000 acres in Kadampukur, 180 km from Calcutta, to set up the 1,000-mw power plant. 

 A police contingent arrived from Katwa and rescued the six officials after three hours.

 The land survey began on June 25. Yesterday, when the surveyors reached Kadampukur village, farmers working on the fields questioned them.

 When they came to know about the survey, they rushed to a mosque and made an announcement using its public address system: Ora amader jomi nite eshechhe. Je jerakam bhabe achhen chole ashun. Rakta thaktey jomi debo na, sapath grohon karun (They have come to take our land. Come immediately. Take the oath that we will not give our land till we are alive).

 Soon, about 1,000 farmers armed with sticks, brooms and sharp weapons had gheraoed the officials.

 Power minister Mrinal Banerjee said he would inquire into the matter. I will seek a report from the local administration. However, the project will come up.

 The villagers of Kadampukur and other areas of Katwa have formed the Krishi, Krishak Khetmajoor Banchao Committee to oppose land acquisition for the power project. The committee is believed to be backed by the local Congress and the Trinamul Congress.

 Power Development Corporation managing director S. Mahapatra said: We will not take any land without paying the prescribed compensation.

 Earlier this year, villagers had launched a protest in Katwa when state industries minister Nirupam Sen went there to lay the foundation stone for a proposed power plant. 

 There have been similar protests by farmers against acquisition of land in Hooghlys Singur for Tata Motors small-car unit.

 Yesterdays incident has embarrassed the local CPM leadership of Katwa, with party leaders blaming the Congress and the Trinamul Congress for misleading the farmers.

 The Opposition knows that if the power plant comes up, they will lose the villagers support. For this, they are trying to mislead the villagers. 

 We will launch a door-to-door campaign and tell the villagers about the necessity of the power plant. The plant will also generate jobs, said Achintya Mullick, the CPMs Burdwan district committee member from Katwa.

 The Congress MLA from Katwa, Rabindranath Chatterjee, said: The villagers are in the dark about the project. The government is trying to acquire two-crop and three-crop land from poor farmers. So, the villagers gheraoed the officials yesterday.

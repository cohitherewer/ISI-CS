 Showcase of love and hate

 ASHIS CHAKRABARTI

 The bronze statue of Hemingway at the Floridita bar

 Havana, Sept. 16: They also call it the Fifth Avenue. 

 Its the finest showpiece of a road in all Cuba, lined by manicured lawns and well-trimmed trees and running along the Caribbean Sea on one side and rows of grand, old buildings of the Spanish colonial days on the other.

 For leaders from the non-aligned countries and delegations that have come with them, the Fifth Avenue is the favourite haunt after work. They all hit the road to see two things Cubas anti-Americanism and its love for an American. 

 First comes the building that houses the American Interest Section, a substitute for a full-fledged diplomatic mission. On view around it are a couple of billboards that capture the 47-year-old stand-off between Cuba and the US. 

 One of the billboards shows the US President as a vampire, with blood dripping through his teeth. Another places him in the company of Hitler. Both are called terrorists.

 Between a square and the American Interest Section building stand long poles, with a clutch of large Cuban flags trying to block the building from public view. 

 Visitors are told that the flags have been put up to prevent public viewing of the provocative, imperialist campaign banners routinely put up on top of the building. 

 But then, no one stops for long near the building.

 The visitors move on to travel to Old Havana, where they head for two of the old towns major attractions the Hemingway hotel and the Hemingway bar. 

 Room 511 of the hotel, Ambos Mundos (which means Both Worlds) was the American authors favourite place when he happened to be in Havana. Its been preserved as a museum, housing many of the Hemingway memorabilia. 

 Its during his stay in the room between 1932 and 1937, the guide says, that Hemingway wrote For Whom The Bell Tolls. 

 Down the narrow cobble-stoned road outside the hotel one travels to the Floridita bar. A bronze statue of Hemingway, one arm leaning on the bar counter and a bronze book open next to him, greets visitors as they enter through the door. 

 Day and night, the visitors pose with the statue. On the night of the NAM summits inauguration, the visitors included the President of Lebanon.

 If the anti-Americanism of the Bush banners gives a taste of Cubas politics, the Hemingway tourism has a story about its economy. 

 In a country where common people can barely afford anything other than the basics that are provided by the state, the Hemingway tourists are welcome contributors to the economy. 

 The Hemingway story, though, is old in Havana. The new story is John Lennon, whose statue in a park was unveiled by none other than Fidel Castro in 1997. 

 The Lennon statue, local people believe, stands as a testimony to a slow change in Cuba that Castro allowed. It stands to mark a changing time when rock music, long hair and any semblance of the hippie cult were no longer taboo. 

 No matter what happens, Cubans seem to be singing and drinking their mojito and daikiri, the white rum-based cocktails, any time of the day or night. 

 Its difficult, though, to say how much is changing or what the people actually want. Castros state has ruled their lives so completely for so long that changes are not easily understood or openly welcomed. Its not easy to make sense of such a country and know the minds of its people during Hemingway tours.

 Law with protection

 GYANANT SINGH 

 New Delhi, March 22: The governments move to bring an ordinance to protect MPs from disqualification from Parliament has created a furore in political circles. But legal experts feel the action could stand the test of law.

 Although a person holding an office of profit is barred from being an MP, the Constitution empowers Parliament to exempt certain offices from being regarded as offices of profit to protect holders of some posts, the experts said.

 One expert cited the 1970 Kanta Kathuria case in which the Supreme Court had held that a state legislature or Parliament could provide such protection even with retrospective effect and, therefore, the reported move by the government to promulgate an ordinance to add to the list can protect sitting members of Parliament.

 According to Article 102 of the Constitution, a member of the Lok Sabha or the Rajya Sabha would be disqualified if he or she holds an office of profit under the government unless the post is declared by Parliament by law not to disqualify its holder.

 Article 191 vests similar powers in state legislatures regarding disqualification from the membership of legislative Assemblies and legislative councils. 

 Such exceptions cannot be created by an executive act but by a law or an ordinance if either House is not in session.

 The Parliament (Prevention of Disqualification) Act, 1959, lists offices which are outside the ambit of offices of profit for the purpose of disqualification. Besides, there are enactments, like the Muslim Wakf Act and the Tea (Second) Amendment Act, which exempt certain posts from being considered offices of profit.

 The government reportedly proposes to bring an ordinance to add to the list of exceptions provided in paragraph 3 of the 1959 act to protect the membership of certain persons, including National Advisory Council chairperson Sonia Gandhi.

 At present, paragraph 3 includes offices held by a minister, minister of state or deputy minister of the Union or state, leader of Opposition, office of chief whip, parliamentary secretaries, office of a member of a delegation sent abroad and offices under any body connected with a university. There is also scope for defining office of profit under paragraph 2 of the act.

 Although the President is the final authority on disqualifying an MP for holding an office of profit, the issue is generally settled by courts as neither the Constitution nor the Representation of People Act has defined the expression.

 Article 102 provides that a person would be barred if:

 He holds an office under the government of 

India or any state

 The office is an office of profit

 The office is one other than that exempted 

by Parliament

The Supreme Court has in various judgments held that 

an office would not be considered to be one under the government if any of the 

following questions are answered in the negative:

 Whether appointment is made by the government

 Whether the government holds the power to dismiss

 Whether the government pays remuneration

 Whether the functions performed are for the 

government

 Whether the government exercises control over 

the performance of those functions

 But regarding what constitutes an office of profit, the Supreme Court has not settled the issue and stressed that the question has to be looked at in a realistic way.

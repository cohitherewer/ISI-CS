 Safety first for Cong, BSP

 - Amar tapes take back seat to poaching fears

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Amar: Breather?

 New Delhi, Feb. 27: The Congress and Bahujan Samaj Party may have had Amar Singh on their lips today, but it was Mulayam Singh Yadav who was on their mind.

 After BSP and Congress MPs plunged both Houses of Parliament in turmoil over the Amar Singh ki amar kahani CDs, sources in both parties admitted their eyes were fixed on Lucknow, with the Congress especially anxious about protecting its own flock.

 The Congress fears the Samajwadi Party would try to poach on its 16 MLAs in Uttar Pradesh if Mulayam found himself short of a majority in the Assembly following a court verdict tomorrow.

 The Lucknow bench of Allahabad High Court is expected to rule on Tuesday whether a split in the BSP in 2003, which saw 40 MLAs walk out of it and later join the Samajwadi Party, was legal. If the judgment goes against the defectors, Mulayam loses 40 MLAs.

 Congress sources said that given the Samajwadi Partys predatory instincts, its leaders might try to lure away MLAs from the Congress and the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD). Sources close to RLD chief Ajit Singh, too, said his first priority was to keep his own flock together.

 There was some relief for the Samajwadi Party from the Supreme Court, which restrained the publication and broadcast of the illegally tapped phone conversations of any person till further orders in response to a petition filed by Amar.

 Although an Uttar Pradesh Congress functionary claimed the order didnt apply to political parties and activist groups, the top leadership is believed to be against a campaign on the tapes for fear of inviting legal strictures.

 Neither is the BSP going to town with the controversy because, as a source said, If we talk of the tapes, Mulayam and Amar Singh will raise the Taj corridor issue. Our leader will then spend her time and energy fending off the charges against her.

 Congress sources maintained it would be smarter politically to milk the tapes closer to the Assembly elections so that the charges stick to the Samajwadi leaders.

 In Parliament today, the BSP had demanded a probe into the CDs, which allegedly contain conversations between Amar and Mulayam about the buying of judges. The Congress pressed for a referral to the Rajya Sabha ethics committee.

 The government said the home ministry was examining the authenticity of the CDs and would act if required, but the MPs werent pacified.

 Through the rumpus in the Rajya Sabha, Amar sat silently listening.

 Teen thrown on train tracks

 Lalu Prasad: Probe order

 Patna, Jan. 2: Gannu Kumar Paswan was standing near the door of the Magadh Express this morning when he heard a commotion. Minutes later, he found himself on the tracks, writhing in pain.

 The 18-year-old, an employee of a private printing press in Patna, now faces the prospect of losing both his legs as he battles for life at Nalanda Medical College and Hospital.

 Paswan fell from the sleeper class compartment in which he was standing when an alleged ticketless traveller, who was engaged in a scuffle with a travelling ticket examiner (TTE), landed on him. The incident happened near Patna Sahib station around 11.30 am.

 Some local people spotted the profusely bleeding Paswan on the tracks and rushed him to hospital. Paswan is understood to have lost one leg while the second one, too, is in a critical condition. 

 Angry people disrupted train movement for about an hour by squatting on the tracks at Patna Sahib station and even manhandled two TTEs, Omprakash Pathak and Manish Prasad, while demanding compensation for the victim, sources said. Traffic on the Delhi-Howrah main line remained paralysed for almost three hours. 

 The situation was brought under control only after senior police officers arrived at the spot. Well get the matter properly investigated and take action, said superintendent of police (city) Rakesh Rathi. 

 Eyewitnesses alleged that one of the TTEs was extorting money from the ticketless travellers. The rail employees, however, denied the charges.

 Still in a state of shock, Paswan recalled: There was a lot of commotion. People were trying to move away. I, too, tried but could not. 

 Extortion in the name of penalty for ticketless travelling is pretty common here. The TTEs are the worst extortionists and most inhuman, a co-passenger said. 

 Railway minister Lalu Prasad has ordered a probe by divisional security commissioner of the Danapur division of East Central Railway, Jitendra Srivastava. We will be able to find out how the tragedy occurred and who is at fault only after a probe. Necessary action will be taken, he said. 

 Srivastava visited Paswan at the hospital to record his statement. Prima facie it appears to be a case of accident. I am trying to get in touch with the TTEs who were on the train at the time of the mishap, he told reporters.

 Meanwhile, the victims father, Manohar Prasad, has lodged a complaint against an unknown TTE with the Government Railway Police (GRP) at Patna Sahib.

 In a similar incident, two GRP jawans had pushed a tea vendor out of a running train at Hajipur in October last year. 

 Muhammad Salim Ansari (14), from whom the policemen first snatched money before pushing him out, had lost his both legs and later died.

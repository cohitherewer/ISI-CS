 Sheep cloud on GM crop

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Probe cry

 New Delhi, Aug. 2: Non-governmental organisations have charged the governments Genetic Engineering Approval Committee (GEAC) with failing to investigate claims that sheep have died in Andhra Pradesh after grazing on farms where genetically engineered cotton plants were being grown.

 The Centre for Sustainable Agriculture (CSA) and another organisation representing shepherds had called on the GEAC to investigate the deaths earlier this year.

 The Animal Health Centre in Warangal district had conducted autopsies on 11 sheep during February and March this year after allegations made by the shepherds. 

 The local shepherds union had approached the CSA which had in turn written to the GEAC asking for a probe.

 However, the GEAC Indias apex agency that oversees safety and environmental issues relating to genetically modified products in its meeting on June 1 noted that the general opinion was that the report (of sheep deaths) appears to be exaggerated and is based more on hearsay than scientific facts.

 That reaction of the GEAC has angered the NGOs.

 In a fresh letter sent to the GEAC on Friday, the NGOs have said the agency has failed miserably in its mandate of investigating concerns relating to safety issues of genetically modified products. They have called for an independent national research team from state and national centres to probe the claims of mortality.

 GEAC members have said that the claims are unfounded because the genetically modified Bt cotton plants were approved only after extensive safety tests on animals.

 Instead of simply dismissing the deaths, the GEAC should investigate the causes, said Gangula Venkat Ramanjaneyulu of the CSA.

 The NGOs have said GEAC should go public with the studies that it used to dismiss the claims of sheep deaths. 

 We want to know on what basis it has rejected the post-mortem findings, Ramanjaneyulu said.

 Tata Sky viewers to get Zee

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Sept. 20: In an order that will cheer up direct-to-home viewers, the Telecom Dispute Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) has passed an interim order asking Zee-Turner, distributors of Zee and other channels, to provide signals to DTH firm Tata Sky within 48 hours. 

 The respondent (Zee-Turner) will supply its 32 channels from all bouquets to the petitioner (Tata Sky) within 48 hours, said Arun Kumar, chairman of the Delhi-based telecom tribunal that also hears disputes in broadcasting.

 Zee-Turner is a joint venture, of which Zee Telefilms owns 74 per cent and Turner International India, a Time Warner affiliate, 26 per cent.

 Tata Sky, 80 per cent of which is owned by the Tatas and 20 per cent by STAR Network, had requested the tribunal to fix the subscription rate somewhere between the price it was willing to pay and the one demanded by Zee-Turner. 

 Tata Sky wanted to pick channels at a rate much lower than what Zee-Turner was willing to accept. We wanted them to take our entire bouquet, instead of picking and choosing, at Rs 75 per subscriber, said a Zee official. 

 He would not say anything beyond that Zee-Turner would comply with the interim order. We will not give an official comment till the final hearing is over, he added.

 Tata Sky, the tribunal made it clear, would have to pay Rs 75 as subscription fee, the price Zee-Turner wanted.

 Zee-Turner has undertaken before TDSAT to provide all its 32 channels to Tata Sky within the next 48 hours. Our subscribers will now be able to enjoy over 100 quality channels and eight interactive services. This reiterates our commitment to provide subscribers with world-class satellite TV service, Tata Sky CEO and MD Vikram Kaushik said in a statement.

 Tata Sky filed a case in early July accusing Zee-Turner of denying it channels and setting exorbitant terms. The tribunal had then asked both sides to settle the matter amicably. 

 Zee-Turner markets its channels in two bouquets. Zee TV, Zee Cinema, Zee Movies, Zee English, CNN, Cartoon Network, CNBC, Trendz, Reality TV, Zee Marathi, Zee Punjabi, Zee Bangla and Zee Gujarati are part of the first, while HBO, Vh1, Pogo, Zee Business and Awaaz make up the second collection.

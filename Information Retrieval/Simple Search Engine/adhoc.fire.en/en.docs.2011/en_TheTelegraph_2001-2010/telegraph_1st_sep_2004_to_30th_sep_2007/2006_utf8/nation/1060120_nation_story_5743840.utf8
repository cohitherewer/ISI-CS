 Bombay blasts rerun plot hint

 Mumbai: The Lashkar-e-Toiba had hatched a plot in Mumbai that involved triggering remote-controlled explosions similar to the 1993 serial blasts, police said on Thursday. 

 The anti-terrorist squad (ATS) said the six detonators seized from three suspected Lashkar militants were actually radio devices that could enable controlled explosions from a distance of 6 km, reports our special correspondent.

 ATS chief and joint commissioner K.P. Raghuvanshi confirmed this to The Telegraph but denied reports that some quantity of military-grade explosives were also seized from the Lashkar trio. 

 The three men from Kashmir were arrested earlier this month. A Haj house imam was also arrested in the same case.

 special correspondent. 

 The king will be in New Delhi as the states chief guest on Republic Day. Naushads wife, Suhaila, is expected to plead for mercy for her husband. 

 She said she would leave for Delhi on January 21, accompanied by Naushads mother, uncle and daughter Ashna, just two-and-a-half years old.

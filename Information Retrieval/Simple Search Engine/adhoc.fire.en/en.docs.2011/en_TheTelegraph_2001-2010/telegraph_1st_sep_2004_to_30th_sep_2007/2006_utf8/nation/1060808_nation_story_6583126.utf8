 Bengal land model for TN

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Chennai, Aug. 7: The DMK government wants to take a leaf out of Bengals very successful land reforms model to implement in Tamil Nadu.

 A high-level team from the southern state, including ministers and officials, will shortly be in Bengal to study the model to get its ambitious programme of redistributing 50 lakh acres of wasteland rolling.

 The team will be in Calcutta in the next few days for a first-hand knowledge on how the state government developed wastelands in Bengal, Tamil Nadu chief minister M. Karunanidhi said last night at a meeting in his constituency, Chepauk.

 I have spoken to the West Bengal government and it has acceded to our request to share its experience, Karunanidhi said. 

 The planned redistribution of wastelands in Tamil Nadu at the rate of two acres per landless farmer, as promised in the DMKs poll manifesto, will start on September 17, the birth anniversary of the late social reformer Periyar, the chief minister said. 

 The land redistribution will be preceded by the kick- off of the free colour TV distribution scheme on September 15, the birthday of the late C.N. Annadurai, the party founder.

 The party had promised free colour TVs to all below-poverty-line families that did not have television sets in the state. 

 Karunanidhi alleged that the previous ADMK government had given incorrect information on the total area of wasteland in the state in one of its annual budgets. 

 It had mentioned that 50 lakh acres of wasteland were available for development, said Karunanidhi, who is also the DMK chief. We made our poll promise on redistributing wastelands owned by the government with that number as the basis.

 He, however, promised that his government would redistribute to several lakhs of poor farmers whatever land is available even if there is a dispute on the amount of government-owned wasteland in Tamil Nadu.

 Revenue and other government officials have already begun a survey of state-owned wastelands, he said, adding that the DMK was determined to go ahead with the scheme. 

 But his government will not approve of the method adopted by the Jayalalithaa regime to develop wastelands by leasing them out to big companies, which in turn entered into individual contracts with farmers to develop those wastelands, Karunanidhi said.

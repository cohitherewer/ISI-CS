 May 26: The southwest monsoon set in over the Kerala coast today, six days ahead of schedule, accompanied with moderate rainfall and winds exceeding 28 kilometres per hour.

 A weather office release said the monsoon, whose normal date of arrival is June 1, had advanced over southern Kerala, Lakshadweep and parts of Tamil Nadu, including Chennai.

 Met director K. Santosh said the forecast this year had been for a May 27-29 onset.

 There was a perceptible increase in cloudiness and wind speeds along the southwest coast and they are expected to accelerate along its usual trajectory of northern Kerala, parts of Tamil Nadu and south Karnataka, he said.

 Santosh added that the conditions were such that the monsoon would move towards the Northeast and southern parts of Karnataka in the next two or three days. Most of the west coast will be covered by early next week. For the rest of the country, it was too early to predict the exact dates.

 The monsoon usually arrives over Calcutta between June 5 and 10, Mumbai by June 10 and New Delhi by June 29. Most years, it covers the entire country by July 15.

 The Indian Meteorological Department has forecast this years rainfall at 93 per cent of the long-period average (LPA) with a model error of 5 per cent. The probability of the June-September rainfall being deficient (below 90 per cent of the LPA) is 22 per cent.

 It is positive news, said Indranil Pan, chief economist with Kotak Mahindra Bank. But we have to look at the performance of the monsoon during the season to know its impact on the prices and the economy.

 The southwest monsoon is the main source of water for farming, which generates about a fifth of Indias gross domestic product.

 Traders said the rains would halt a bull run in the prices of commodities and improve yields of oilseeds, rice, cotton and sugarcane, which are highly rain-dependent.

 It will have a salutary effect on the runaway commodity prices in India. The market has already come down, said Atul Chaturvedi, president of Adani Exports, a top grains trading firm.

 If the monsoon now advances without any delay, it will benefit the farmers, and sowing of soybean and groundnut will be over by mid-June. But we will have to see the spread of the rains during the entire season.

 With nearly two-thirds of Indias billion-plus population dependent on farm-related income, the arrival and distribution of the rains play a major role in the economy.

 Indias economy, the third-largest in Asia, has expanded at an average 8 per cent in the past three years after normal rains, and the Reserve Bank expects a growth of 7.5-8 per cent in the fiscal year ending March 2007.

 Maneka: Fangs bared

 New Delhi, Aug. 18: Maneka Gandhi bared her fangs today in what appeared to be the beginning of a catfight in the Nehru-Gandhi clan with the BJP playing referee.

 The CBI had yesterday registered a criminal case against Maneka. The charges amounted to cheating in disbursement of funds from the Maulana Azad Foundation to an NGO in her constituency Pilibhit when she was the minister for social justice and empowerment. Today, Maneka launched a shrill attack on her sister-in-law and UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi, blaming her for the FIR.

 Personal vendetta and viciousness are taking the shape of public policy, she charged as the BJPs deputy leader in the Lok Sabha, V.K. Malhotra, party spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad and Lok Sabha MP Manvendra Singh nodded. 

 The political establishment is directly responsible for this pathetic nonsense. The UPA chairperson is using the CBI to terrorise and intimidate the Opposition.

 She did not spare the Prime Minister who, according to her, is fully aware of and responsible for the political witch-hunt against her. I am not shy of saying who in the Congress is responsible. There are only two persons who have any authority the UPA chairperson and the Prime Minister, if he does anything at all without orders, she said.

 Maneka claimed that senior CBI officials informed her earlier this month that they had orders from the top to register a criminal case against her. Top CBI officials told me that they were told by the Prime Minister that the UPA chairperson had ordered that a case should be registered against me, she said. She alleged that Sonia gave this directive at a meeting at the Prime Ministers residence. I know of this meeting in the Prime Ministers house, she said.

 Maneka said even if she wanted to, she could not have diverted funds from the foundation because all such decisions are first approved by a board of 14 eminent persons, including President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam. No decision was taken without the consent of the board.

 Malhotra said the BJP supported Maneka in her fight against injustice and vendetta. 

 The Congress dismissed Manekas allegations as rubbish.

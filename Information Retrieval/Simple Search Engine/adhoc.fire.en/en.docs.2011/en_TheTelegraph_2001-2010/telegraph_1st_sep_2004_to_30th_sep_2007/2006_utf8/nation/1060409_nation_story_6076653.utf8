 Aligarh varsity at SC door

 New Delhi: Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) moved the Supreme Court on Saturday against an Allahabad High Court order setting aside the universitys minority status, reports our special correspondent. 

 Five separate special leave petitions have been filed against the January 5 judgment holding the minority status and reservation of half the seats at the university for Muslims as unconstitutional. 

 The AMU Old Boys Association had earlier moved court against the judgment. Their petition will be heard along with those filed by the university.

 The high court had ruled that the AMU was not a minority institution and, hence, reservation of seats was unconstitutional.

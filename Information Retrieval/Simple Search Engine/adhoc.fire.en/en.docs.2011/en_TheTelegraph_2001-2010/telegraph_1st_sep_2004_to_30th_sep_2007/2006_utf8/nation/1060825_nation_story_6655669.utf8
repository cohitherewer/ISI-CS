 Jaipur hair snip jolts Parliament

 New Delhi: The humiliation of a Sikh 

 teenager in Jaipur who was attacked by a group of six and 

 had his hair forcibly shorn raised a storm in Parliament 

 on Thursday.

 The heated exchanges between the Congress and the Opposition came on a day the main accused, Arjun Meena, was arrested in Delhi before being taken to Jaipur.

 We are hoping to find out the whereabouts of the others involved from him, Delhi police assistant commissioner Rajan Singh said.

 In his FIR, 17-year-old Inderpreet Singh said he was assaulted and had his hair cut. The attack led to protests in Rajasthan and Punjab.

 In the Lok Sabha, the Congress clashed with the BJP, which rules Rajasthan, and the Akali Dal, forcing two adjournments. In the Rajya Sabha, BJP members raised the issue and all parties joined in condemning the incident.

 Army clears gender air

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 23: The army today asserted that there was positive discrimination in favour of women in its officer cadre but there was no move to grant them permanent commission like officers who graduate out of the National Defence Academy (NDA) and the Indian Military Academy (IMA).

 Army headquarters sources said women officers on short-service commission are given the substantive rank of captain after a years service while men hold the substantive rank of lieutenant (which is junior to captain).

 The sources said the cabinet approved in November 2005 the abolition of the Women Special Entry Scheme (WSES) through which women officers have been inducted into the army since 1993 but the rules under which women will be commissioned were still being framed.

 It is likely that after the WSES is scrapped, women will be put through the same amount of training in the Officers Training Academy in Chennai as the gentlemen cadets. Now, women have to go through at least six months of training and men through a year before being granted short-service commission.

 Officers on short-service commission serve for five years, extendable by a further nine years in two years subject to fitness and choice.

 The sources said there were anomalies in the promotions of officers and a distinction had come about between men and women on short-service commission because the rules that govern promotions under the recommendations of the A.V. Singh Committee have not yet been framed.

 The recommendations are relevant only for officers on permanent commission, the sources claimed.

 Even if the Womens Special Entry Scheme is scrapped, the intake of women into the service will not be reduced and is set to go up in future. Currently, 150 women cadets are taken into the service annually, up from 50 in 1993.

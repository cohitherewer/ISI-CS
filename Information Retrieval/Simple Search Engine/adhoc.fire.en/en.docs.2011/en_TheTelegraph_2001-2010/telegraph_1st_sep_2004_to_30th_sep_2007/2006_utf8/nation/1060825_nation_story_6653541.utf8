 CPM guns for poll panel

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Nilotpal Basu

Calcutta, Aug. 24: The CPM has stepped up its campaign against the Election Commission ahead of bypolls in Bengal. 

 Accusing it of abuse of power, bias and high-handedness, the CPM has written to other parties seeking a consensus on constitutional and legal amendments to reform the commission by defining its rights, power and fixing its accountability, central committee member Nilotpal Basu said today.

 We want reforms in the Election Commission in the wake of its biased and arbitrary decisions during the Assembly election in Bengal. The Election Commission became part of the slander campaign against us, the former Rajya Sabha MP said. 

 Basu was speaking at a seminar on the commissions rights, power and duties organised by the DYFI, the partys youth wing.

 Article 325 of the Constitution is not clear on the ambit and limit of the Election Commissions powers. Thats why we are seeking amendment,Basu said.

 Bypolls to one Assembly seat and three parliamentary seats are due soon.

 The amendments should spell out the criteria for constituting the multi-member commission and the eligibility of individual members, and introduce a provision to remove them if they fail to discharge their duties, he said. 

 Basu wanted it clarified whether the commission can impose a huge financial burden on states by holding multi-phase polls. The rights and power of observers should also be defined, he added. 

 The CPM also launched a tirade in the Assembly, alleging that the names of lakhs of genuine voters had been deleted and voting rights denied on polling day on whimsical grounds. The five-phase Assembly elections in Bengal, the ban on political graffiti and posters and deployment of paramilitary forces in polling booths came under attack. 

 The Election Commission members are never democratically elected but they are conducting the democratic polls. To whom are they accountable?said Speaker H.A. Halim. 

 Sports minister Subhas Chakraborty complained that the commission denied parties their rights. The Election Commission could not rise above dirty politics. The deletion of the name of one lakh voters was deliberate, he said.

 But former chief election commissioner T.S. Krishnamurthy said: Hitler came to power through election. So democracy has to be zealously guarded since free and fair election is a constantly evolving process.

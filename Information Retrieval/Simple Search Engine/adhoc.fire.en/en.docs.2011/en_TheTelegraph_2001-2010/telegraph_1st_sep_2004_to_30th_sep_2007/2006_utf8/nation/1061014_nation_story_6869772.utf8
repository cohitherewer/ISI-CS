 Rigging cloud on civic polls

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Chennai, Oct. 13: Ballot papers snatched away, candidates in hospital after attacks, bogus voting, agents threatened and voters shooed away from booths the mayhem often seen in Bihar in the past marred elections to the Chennai Municipal Corporations 155 wards today.

 Thugs, allegedly working for the DMK-PMK combine, prowled the streets from 7 am, when the first phase of civic polls in the state took off with the Chennai municipal body seats. The government had declared a holiday.

 ADMK lawyers moved Madras High Court this afternoon with petitions to stop the elections. Vaikos MDMK sent an SOS to President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam requesting immediate intervention to ensure a repoll. 

 The court was closed, but a bench constituted urgently admitted former ADMK minister D. Jayakumars plea seeking a stay on counting and an order to scrap the elections. Notices have gone out to the state election commission and police, besides DMK president and chief minister M. Karunanidhi.

 The rush to court followed attacks on Kalairajan and Sekar Babu, both ADMK MLAs from the city, when they tried to prevent bogus voters from entering booths. DMK leaders said it was the ADMK men who first entered booths and indulged in violence.

 At least two leaders were in hospital after suffering injuries in assaults blamed on DMK cadres. 

 The first was a CPM member from South Chennai. The other was an MDMK candidate in the citys ward number 81. 

 In MGR Nagar, allegations flew that goons, reportedly hired by the DMK, thrashed cadres of the CPM, which is contesting eight wards on its own after failing to reach a seat-sharing understanding with the ruling party.

 ADMK chief and former chief minister Jayalalithaa called the elections a total mockery of democracy. 

 Right from the morning when polling opened, DMK goons began capturing booths, she said while calling fresh voting in all seats under supervision of the police from other states and central forces. The BJP and the Desiya Murpokku Dravidar Kazhagam (DMDK), led by actor Vijayakant, joined the ADMK in crying foul.

 Talking to reporters in the evening, state election commissioner Chandrasekharan said the elections were by and large peaceful in other civic bodies of the state. He conceded there were some incidents in Chennai, where repoll has been ordered in 13 booths. 

 Karunanidhi, unfazed by allegations against the DMK, brushed aside the reports of rigging and violence. Jayalalithaa, he snidely remarked, had already found good reasons to rationalise her partys imminent defeat.

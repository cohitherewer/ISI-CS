 View on security threat routine

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi/Mumbai, Dec. 22: The home ministry today took stock of the security cover for top politicians, but described as routine an advisory sent to some states about terrorist threats to the Prime Minister and Sonia Gandhi.

 A ministry spokesman said it was a practice to make periodic threat assessment for all its protectees.

 A similar exercise was undertaken in view of the forthcoming festivals, Republic Day functions and Assembly elections in four major states.

 The ministry admitted an advisory had been sent but did not reveal the content of the letters sent to the Special Protection Group (SPG) and state governments.

 The spokesman added that on the basis of the threat assessment received, an advisory was issued to all concerned to be vigilant and strengthen security arrangements for protectees in order to avoid any untoward incident.

 The ministry said such advisories are issued regularly.

 Both Manmohan Singh and Sonia are travelling during the weekend. The Congress president will speak at a rally in Mumbai tomorrow while the Prime Minister is visiting Bengal on Saturday and Sunday. 

 Mumbai police commissioner Anami Roy today conducted a review of the security arrangements at Shivaji Park, the venue of the rally. 

 Armed commandos will be be positioned on specially erected towers on and around the ground. A network of closed-circuit television sets will monitor movements.

 A turnout of over three lakh people is expected for the public meeting, Sonias third such rally in Mumbai in the past three years. She will flag off the Congress campaign for elections in 10 municipal corporations, including Mumbai, on February 1.

 Mumbai police have a busy day ahead of them. President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam will also be in the city to attend an event organised by the global alumni of IIT at the Bandra-Kurla complex. Agriculture minister Sharad Pawar is scheduled to address a meeting of his Nationalist Congress Partys minority cell.

 A controversy has developed around Sonias rally with state election commissioner Nand Lals warning that the expenses would be counted as election expenditure since it is taking place after the code of conduct coming into force.

 The Congress, therefore, is trying to pass it off as a rally planned earlier, unconnected to the elections. Sanjay Nirupam, spokesperson for the Maharashtra Pradesh Congress Committee, said: This is a scheduled programme planned two months ago. The rally is part of the partys foundation-day celebrations.

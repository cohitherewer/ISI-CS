 Sonia backs Iran, US line

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Sonia and Rahul 

 New Delhi, Feb. 21: Congress chief Sonia Gandhi has welcomed the February 23 debate in Parliament on Iran and indicated that the Prime Minister is willing to have one on the Indo-US nuclear pact as well.

 Government sources said Manmohan Singh might make a statement on the nuclear deal on February 27 and have a discussion after the visit of US President George W. Bush.

 Although the dates of Bushs visit have not been officially announced, it is believed he will be in the capital from March 1.

 Addressing a meeting of the Congress Parliamentary Party this morning, Sonia iterated the Prime Ministers line that the government would always give paramount consideration to the protection of Indias short-term and long-term strategic and national interests.

 In her speech, copies of which were given to the media, the Congress chief said: The issue of Iran and its nuclear status as well as that of our nuclear agreement with the USA are under intense public scrutiny. These will be discussed in Parliament as well. The Prime Minister has made a detailed statement giving the complete background to our governments stand. We welcome the opportunity for a debate in both the Houses.

 Sonia, who heads the ruling coalition, used the forum to convey her anguish to Muslims caused by the publication of the cartoons of Prophet Mohammad. Our party also strongly condemned this. I want to make it very clear that the Congress party condemns the denigration of any faith, she said.

 However, she did not mention the Sachar committee, which has been tasked by the government to collect data on the number of Muslims in its employ in all sectors, including the army.

 Speaking on the economy, she urged the government and the Congress to keep a closer watch on the prices and availability of foodgrain and other food items as well as essential commodities like kerosene and cooking gas. Sonia said it was time to watch imports in critical and sensitive areas.

 Her message to the government was benefits of growth must reach the weaker sections in due proportions. The Congress party has always believed that without distributive justice, economic growth cannot be sustained, Sonia said.

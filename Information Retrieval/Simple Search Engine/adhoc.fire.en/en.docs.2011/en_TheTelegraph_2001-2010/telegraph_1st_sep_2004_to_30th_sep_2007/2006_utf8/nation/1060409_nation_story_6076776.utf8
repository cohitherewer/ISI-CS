 IIT aspirant caught in fear amp; curfew web

 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY

 Aligarh, April 8: IIT aspirant Rahmat Siddique is at his wits end. The all-India IIT entrance test is tomorrow but instead of doing his last minute brushing up, he has been wasting time running from pillar to post.

 One, he has had to beg and plead with police and district administration officials to let him go and collect his admit card in the time of curfew.

 Then, he has had to rush to the district magistrate to get hold of a curfew pass, without which he will not be able to get to his exam centre in violence-wracked Aligarh tomorrow.

 Three days after clashes erupted on Ram Navami over decorative lights at a makeshift temple, Siddique is shaken. Rioters have been on a roll outside his Delhigate home and hes worried what tomorrow will bring.

 I have seen a mob howling for the blood of the rival group, I have seen a bullet-riddled body lying on the street outside. Concentrating on studies has become a nightmare, the 19-year-old said.

 This morning, Siddique somehow managed to reach the office where admit cards were being handed out. As though the obstacle race wasnt enough, officials there told him he would immediately have to go to DM Bhuvnesh Kumar to get hold of his curfew pass.

 Mr Kumar gave me a curfew pass so that I can reach Raghuveer Sahay Inter College, which is in a curfew-bound area. This is the first time any student has got such a strange gift along with the admit card: a curfew pass, he said.

 Aligarh Muslim University had cancelled all exams yesterday, as did all schools and colleges after the clashes in the university town. The same, however, could not be done with the IIT entrance test, which is an all-India affair.

 Some 1,500 students from Aligarh and nearby areas will take the test at centres in curfew-bound areas. Apart from Siddiques centre, Tikaram Kanya College and St Fedlie School are in tension-ridden areas.

 All other exams, including those in Aligarh Muslim University, have been cancelled. But the IIT exam will have to be held undisturbed, Kumar said.

 Although most schools and colleges are shut till further notice, the student community in the AMU hostel is trying hard to keep up a semblance of normality on the campus. They have been attending classes, but are not unaffected. We are going through a lot of tension because of what is going on outside, said Rubina, a mass communication student.

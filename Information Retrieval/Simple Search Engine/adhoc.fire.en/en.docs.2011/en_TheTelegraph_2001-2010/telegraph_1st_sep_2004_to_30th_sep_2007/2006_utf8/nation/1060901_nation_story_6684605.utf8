 SC pension punch 

 New Delhi, Aug. 31: The government can withhold the pension of a retired government servant if he is found to have caused any pecuniary loss to the public exchequer by being negligent during his period of service, the Supreme Court has held.

 A three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice Y.K. Sabharwal noted that state governments were free to frame rules for withholding or withdrawing pension, or any part of it, to recover their losses resulting from the misconduct or negligence of public servants.

 The apex court ruling came while upholding the constitutional validity of a provision in the West Bengal Services (Death-cum-Retirement Benefit) Rules 1971, which empowers the governor to order recovery from a pension of any loss caused to the government.

 The bench said it did not agree with earlier Supreme Court judgments that set aside such rules on the ground that payment of pension was not the governments discretion.

 The judges observed that courts could look into whether a particular order withholding or reducing the pension of a government official was valid or not, but they could not strike down the rule.

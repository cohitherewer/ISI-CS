 SC washes hands of contract labour

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 8: The Supreme Court has ruled that courts cannot order abolition of contract labour in any establishment. Only state governments can decide on the subject, it said.

 A bench headed by Justice S.B. Sinha said matters relating to abolition of contract labour can only be decided by appropriate governments under the Contract Labour (Regulation and Abolition) Act, 1970, and not otherwise.

 No court can determine the question as to whether contract labour should be abolished or not, the same being within the exclusive domain of the appropriate government, the court said. 

 A state government is, however, required to apply its mind before deciding on the matter as the decision taken by it is not beyond the pale of judicial review, the court said, while allowing an appeal filed by the Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL).

 The judgment assumes importance in view of the fact that employees working on contract can seek their absorption as permanent employees only after contract labour in their establishment is abolished. Courts can decide a dispute regarding absorption of workers on contract only after the state government issues a notification prohibiting employment of contract labour in the establishment. 

 SAIL had questioned the legality of a decision by the Karnataka govern-ment to refer to a labour court a dispute by some contract workers seeking their absorption as permanent employees in the Visveswaraya Iron and Steel Ltd at Bhadravathi.

 Over 600 employees, allegedly engaged by contractors working for SAIL, had put forth a demand before the state government for their absorption as permanent employees. 

 The state government referred the matter to a labour court for adjudication but SAIL objected, saying the reference by the state government was impermissible in law.

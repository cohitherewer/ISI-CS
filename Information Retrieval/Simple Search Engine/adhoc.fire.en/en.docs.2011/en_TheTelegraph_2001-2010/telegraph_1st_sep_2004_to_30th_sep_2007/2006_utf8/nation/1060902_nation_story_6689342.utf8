 Lebanon on French menu

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi, Sept. 1: Indian defence officials led by minister Pranab Mukherjee will be given a briefing by the French government on military operations in Afghanistan and Lebanon where the French are part of separate coalition forces on the ground.

 Mukherjee (in picture) will be leading a team of officials from the services and the ministry on a six-day official visit to France and Germany tomorrow. High on the defence ministers agenda are talks with France on the India-US civilian nuclear deal. France is a member of the Nuclear Suppliers Group. But it is not being officially announced.

 The French will give presentations on subjects concerning bilateral military relations but the Indian delegation will be listening avidly to the French experience with the UN peacekeeping in Lebanon and with the Natos International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan.

 In Lebanon and Afghanistan, Indian and French forces have to collaborate in the middle of conflicts that neither side is party to. In Afghanistan, that is of interest to New Delhi because it is in its immediate strategic neighbourhood, Indian forces are deployed at establishments run for India-sponsored projects. 

 France provides a major contingent to the ISAF and both sides have to coordinate development activity in the face of increasing attacks from the Taliban this year.

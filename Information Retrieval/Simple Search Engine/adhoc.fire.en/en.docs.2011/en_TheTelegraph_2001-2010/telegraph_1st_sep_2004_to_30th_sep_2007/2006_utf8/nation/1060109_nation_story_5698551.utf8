 Naidu joins Amar cry

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 )Amar, Naidu: In 

 chorus

 Hyderabad, Jan. 8: Suddenly, telephone tapping stories are crawling out of the countrys political woodwork. 

 After Amar Singhs allegations against the Centre and Jayalalithaas empathy, Telugu Desam Party chief N. Chandrababu Naidu today joined the chorus, saying his telephone and those of his partys top brass were being tapped.

 Naidus comment came after a long chat he had with Amar Singh at the Desam office this morning.

 He said he had definite information that his personal phone at the party headquarters in Banjara Hills and that of several politburo members of the Desam were being tapped. I will come out in the open when I get some proof like Amar Singh did, he told reporters after meeting the Samajwadi Party general secretary, who first raised the phone-tapping stink.

 Amar said he would mention Reliance Infocomm, owned by his close friend Anil Ambani, in his petition in the Supreme Court soon. A Reliance Infocomm employee was arrested by Delhi police in connection with the alleged phone tappings.

 Naidu said: As the matter was raised by many Opposition leaders, I demand that an impartial inquiry should be ordered to bring forth the facts and clear the apprehensions. 

 The matter should be inquired by a team of three chief ministers, including Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee (of Bengal), Nitish Kumar (of Bihar) and Jayalalithaa (of Tamil Nadu), Naidu said, echoing Uttar Pradesh chief minister and Samajwadi Party boss Mulayam Singh Yadav on this issue.

 Naidu extended full support to Amar and said he would join a delegation of Opposition leaders to meet the Prime Minister if needed.

 The Congress government in Andhra Pradesh has vehemently denied Naidus allegation of phone tapping.

 On January 5, Amar spoke to Jayalalithaa to enlist her support. The Tamil Nadu chief minister, after a meeting with the Samajwadi leader, said she had long suspected that her phones, too, were being tapped by the Centre. 

 She said: Shri Amar Singh has furnished solid proof that the Centre has organised the tapping of the telephone of an Opposition political leader.

 Today, Amar also said he had received threat calls. According to the Samajwadi Party leader, the callers threatened that he would face the consequences if he took Congress president Sonia Gandhis name again in relation with his tapping allegation.

 Amar said the time was ripe for a law against phone tapping on the lines of the law on the right to information.

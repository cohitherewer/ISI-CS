 Dressing down for flags on skirts

 CHARU SUDAN KASTURI

 Flag okay on face, not skirt 

 New Delhi, Aug. 18: Riddhi Sarkar cant figure out why she was scolded by a government official on Independence Day.

 Wearing her patriotism on her sleeve, or rather skirt, the 10-year student of a Kendriya Vidyalaya in Gurgaon was not the only student to earn a dressing down. Nor was her school the only one to go against the law on August 15.

 The official was there to reprimand the school, not you, Riddhis teacher explained to her.

 Six government schools were pulled up by Haryana government officials because their students wore the Indian flag on their skirts while performing at a celebration on Independence Day.

 Wearing the Tricolour below the waist is a violation of the Indian Flag Code, which was revised last year.

 We thought it was just a display of our pride in being Indian, said Shashank Puri, one of the teachers who had trained the children for the performance.

 Parents and school authorities said senior administration officials who had organised the event had not objected either before or during the show.

 So many of the officials present during the function actually came up to us to congratulate us on the performances of our daughters, said Riddhis mother Shiela Sarkar.

 Ramneek Kaur, whose 12-year-old daughter Prerna was another participant, echoed her. They (the officials) should have stopped the function if it was in violation (of the code).

 District magistrate Anantram Tanvar said the schools had taken the decision to wear the flag on skirts at the last minute, taking the administration by surprise.

 But the school authorities beg to differ.

 Though the flag was not worn during any of the rehearsals, it was always clear to the administration that the flags were going to be worn during the performance, said the principal of one of the erring schools.

 The schools admitted that the idea was theirs, but it had been accepted by the organising committee set up by the state government well before the performance.

 An investigation is on to find out who is responsible for the violation.

 Congress MP Naveen Jindal, the man behind the amendment to the code, hails from Haryana. Earlier, citizens were not allowed to wear the Tricolour even on the upper half of their bodies.

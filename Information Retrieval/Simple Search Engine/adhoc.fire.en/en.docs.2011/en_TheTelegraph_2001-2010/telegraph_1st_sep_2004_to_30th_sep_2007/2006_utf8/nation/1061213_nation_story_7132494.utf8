 Junk Viagra, have rosogollas to spice up sex life

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Just pop one

 Bhopal, Dec. 12: Some came and directly asked for it. Others checked out amla, triphala and other herbs before sheepishly enquiring about kavanch rosogollas, supposedly powered to increase sperm count and cure sexual dysfunction.

 The four-day national forest expo saw a mad rush for all vitality-enhancing herbs, ranging from safed moosli, van tulsi, satavar to kavanch (mucuna prurita, a climbing legume indigenous to tropical countries) seed laddoos and rosogollas.

 Safed moosli (chlorophytum borivilianum) is used as a tonic to rejuvenate the reproductive system. Van tulsi (ocimum gratissimum) can cure menstrual irregularities and all types of weakness. Satavar or asparagus racmouse is an under-shrub that is used in medicated oils.

 A stall from Khajuraho selling kavanch rosogollas was most crowded as people vied to get hold of a box of six for Rs 100.

 Vaid Amar Nath, claiming to be a disciple of Guru Shantanand of Khajurahos Laundi Ashram first to have prepared kavanch rosogollas said making them was not difficult but it was a long-drawn process.

 First, the kavanch seeds have to be mixed in milk. Then, they have to be skinned and added with ayurvedic medicines.

 Next, the mixture has to be shaped into rosogollas and fried in pure ghee. Then, they have to be steeped in honey for six months to last two-and-a-half years without refrigeration.

 Anwari Begum, 42, a resident of Shajhanabad asked the ayurveda practitioner if the rosogollas would be good for her. Share these rosogollas with your partner. You know sharing is caring, he said.

 Auto-rickshaw driver Deerendra set off howls of laughter when he asked: Doctor sahib, is it better than the pills that are high on promise but short on performance?

 Naresh Gupta, a doctor running a clinic in Sehore district, said most people came to the expo expecting miracle herbs. He named a couple, the Vermas, who asked for something to spice up their private life.

 These developments mark a change in peoples attitude towards sex, he said.

 Haji Mustafa, an ayurveda practitioner from Narsinghpur, vouched for the efficacy of the rosogollas. They do much more than merely enhancing bodily pleasure, he said.

 At other stalls too, sex tonics promising to improve male potency did good business. Ram Autar Dixit, a teacher, said he had come looking for vaids who would provide free consultation.

 But I was dismayed to find that most reputed practitioners were missing. They were reportedly summoned by state ministers and influential bureaucrats, he claimed.

 Anil Soni, who sold safed moosli, was heard telling people to complete the 14-day dose. It does not start showing effect within an hour but controls sexual power throughout life. It will prevent shrinking of nerves and other infections around the genitals, he said.

 Vaid Nazeer, an acupuncture expert, said herbs were cheaper than allopathic drugs but not easy to find. We spend months in dense forests collecting these rare herbs, he said.

 State forest minister Himmat Kothari said: In four days, we had a sale of over Rs 1 crore, which is impressive as herbs are not expensive.

 The expo was inaugurated by governor Balram Jakhar on December 7 and ended yesterday.

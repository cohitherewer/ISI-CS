 Dating pay case

 Kanpur, Nov. 23 (PTI): A local court has issued a notice to Wipro chairman Azim Premji after the wife of an employee alleged that her husband left her because the firm paid him a dating allowance.

 The chief metropolitan magistrate issued the notices one of which also went to Wipro vice-president Pratik Kumar after Tripti Nigam filed a case under the new domestic violence law. Gaurav and Wipro have to reply by November 29.

 Tripti had initially filed a case of domestic violence against her in-laws. The magistrate had asked Gaurav and his parents to submit their replies in that matter by November 25.

 Nandlal Jaiswal, Triptis lawyer, said she filed a fresh case in the same court on Wednesday, making Premji and Kumar parties to the matter. In her new petition, she has argued that the alleged dating allowance had changed her husbands behaviour towards her.

 Wipro denied it had any such allowance. We dont have a dating allowance in any form and hence cannot elaborate on this alleged issue, the company said in a statement from Bangalore. We have no formal intimation on this (the court notices), it said.

 Cops clueless about Zahira

 Ahmedabad: A day after Vadodara police commissioner Deepak Swaroop formed a special team to trace Zahira Sheikh, Gujarat police said they are still clueless about her whereabouts, reports our correspondent.

 The witness to the Best Bakery massacre was sentenced to a year in jail on Wednesday for deflecting the course of justice by her numerous flip-flops during trial.

 We have sent a team to Mumbai but we have not been able to trace her, Swaroop said. 

 Social activists, however, feel the police are not taking the hunt seriously enough. Raeeskhan Pathan, who represents the Citizens for Justice and Peace, accused the police of pretending they are in the dark about Zahiras whereabouts. She cannot survive without the financial support of those who bought her silence, Pathan said.

 Congress spokesperson Hasmukh Patel echoed her. A non-traceable Zahira is safe for the government, police and the culprits, who were hand-in-glove during the riots.

 Witness shield on table

 New Delhi: The home ministry has made 

 a long list of proposed amendments to the Criminal Procedure 

 Code Act in response to Sonia Gandhis letter asking 

 it to find ways of witness protection so that they do not 

 turn hostile, reports our special correspondent.

 One of the proposals on the home ministrys list, which comes in the wake of the Jessica Lal verdict, is to allow witnesses in criminal cases to record their evidence on camera.

 The ministry also suggests allowing an appeal on behalf of the victim against an acquittal order, instead of waiting for prosecution to act.

 Fraud shot

 New Delhi: A guard posted at the Kashmere 

 Gate branch of Punjab and Sind Bank shot dead a man trying 

 to withdraw Rs 1.15 lakh from an account by allegedly impersonating 

 its holder. Sarvesh Sapra, 28, died on the spot.

 A case of culpable homicide not amounting to murder under Section 304 of the IPC has been registered against Chaturbhuj.

 Raj party

 Mumbai (PTI): Two-and-a months after 

 resigning from the Shiv Sena, Raj Thackeray announced formation 

 of his political party, Maharashtra Navnirman Sena, on Thursday. 

 It will formally take off on March 19 with a rally here.

 IAS to poll fray

 Thiruvananthapuram: Delhis former 

 demolition man K.J. Alphons has resigned as 

 Kerala land revenue commissioner to contest the Assembly 

 elections. The 53-year-old Alphons will contest for the 

 Left Democratic Front.

 The 

 tsunami hit tourism in parts of the country but the overall 

 flow of tourists increased by 13 per cent and foreign exchange

 Ulfa prisoner signal

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 7: The Ulfa-constituted Peoples Consultative Group today extracted an assurance from Delhi that it would look into instances of human rights violation in Assam and seriously consider releasing jailed leaders of the banned militant group.

 The Government of India has agreed to examine and initiate a series of confidence-building measures with regard to instances of human rights violation and examine the issues for release of certain detainees in consultation with the state government, Union home secretary V.K. Duggal told the media after being closeted with the PCG members for nearly two-and-a-half hours at the Prime Ministers Office.

 Reading out a joint statement, the home secretary said both sides committed themselves to maintaining an environment conducive to a dialogue. 

 Duggal also said the government planned to hold another round of discussions with the PCG as early as possible and listen to all their concerns. 

 He evaded queries on whether Delhi made any commitment on stopping army operations against Ulfa, a demand that the outfit and its team of mediators have been raising all along.

 PCG spokesperson Arup Borbora said a consensus was reached on how to take the peace process to its logical conclusion. 

 He said the entire gamut of issues raised by Ulfa were discussed at the meeting, but it is understood that the Delhi team remained silent on the demand for the release of three Ulfa members who went missing during Bhutans counter-insurgency offensive in December 2003. 

 A PCG member, however, said the government had promised to gather information on the trio of Robin Neog, Asanta Baghphukan and Bening Rabha. He said the PCG expected the next round of talks to be held before Bihu (mid-April). 

 Apart from Duggal, national security adviser M.K. Narayanan and senior bureaucrats from the Prime Ministers Office and the home ministry attended todays meeting. 

 The first round of talks was held in the capital on October 26 last year. The PCG had described the meeting with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who broke convention to participate in it, as a very good beginning.

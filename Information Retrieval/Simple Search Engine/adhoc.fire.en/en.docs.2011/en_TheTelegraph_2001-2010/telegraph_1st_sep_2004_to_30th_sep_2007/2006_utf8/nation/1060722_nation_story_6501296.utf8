 Polio alarm in heartland

 G.S. MUDUR

 New Delhi, July 21: India has recorded a spurt in polio cases this year, with at least 100 children paralysed by the poliomyelitis virus in the past six months.

 While virtually all the cases have surfaced in a few districts of western Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, public health officials are worried because the monsoon months with high-transmission risk have yet to pass.

 By July 10, the number of children with polio had touched 81, higher than the total number of 66 last year. In the past 10 days, medical workers have confirmed 19 cases of polio in Moradabad district.

 Health officials in New Delhi have blamed the Uttar Pradesh health administration for what they call its utter failure in delivering vaccines effectively to infants and children in the affected districts during the second half of 2005.

 Its a sad situation, entirely because of poor quality of the immunisation effort in the affected districts, said a senior public health specialist who has spent years managing Indias war against polio.

 A large number of children did not receive the vaccine, and post-immunisation house-to-house campaigns to seek out and vaccinate unimmunised children did not work.

 Were worried about the possibility of a spill-over into other states, the officer told The Telegraph. Three years ago, the polio virus slipped out of Uttar Pradesh and triggered outbreaks in Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, states that had eliminated the virus for many months before its re-entry ? ferried there by infected but symptom-free children or adults.

 The polio virus multiplies in the human gut and is excreted by infected children, even when they do not fall ill. Infants pick it up through contaminated food or water and the chances of this happening rise during the rainy season.

 Moradabad has been the worst-affected district, accounting for half of all cases this year. But polio has also surfaced in Badaun and Bareilly. Investigations by central authorities have shown that immunisation campaigns by the state health administration missed 10 to 18 per cent of infants and young children in villages around these towns, a health officer said.

 Such children remain inadequately protected from the virus. About one in 200 infections advance to irreversible paralysis, most often in the legs. Most of the polio paralysis has occurred in children below two years of age, he said.

 There appeared to be a lack of accountability in the local health administration in Uttar Pradesh. There was no action taken even when problems were pointed out, the officer said, requesting not to be named.

 According to figures released by the National Polio Surveillance Programme for the period January 1 through July 15, Uttar Pradesh had 85 polio cases, Bihar had 13 cases, and Jharkhand and Madhya Pradesh had one case each.

 Public health specialists find the rise in the number of polio cases this year particularly discomforting because by the end of 2005, India had recorded its lowest-ever levels of polio transmission.

 The World Health Organisation has classified four countries as polio-endemic as of 2006 ? Nigeria, India, Pakistan and Afghanistan. 

 Nigeria has reported 520 polio cases this year, Pakistan 7, and Afghanistan 14.

 Were hoping things will improve. Some officials have been moved, a top central health officer said. In the past, the state has aggressively responded. Moradabad had zero polio cases in 2003.

 Coin chaos in House

 DEBABRATA MOHANTY

 Bhubaneswar, Feb. 13: The coins did not set the cash registers ringing. Instead, they brought the House down.

 Orissa Assembly Speaker Maheswar Mohanty had to adjourn the House several times today after some Congress members led by Anup Sai unpacked a sackful of coins on a table. 

 Two minutes before question hour ended this morning, Sai and his party colleagues dashed to the well with the coins. The House marshals and Biju Janata Dal members tried to prevent them from opening the sacks, but failed.

 Sais group demanded that the Speaker count the loose change, which they claimed amounted to Rs 60,000, and give them a receipt. The money, they said, had been collected to pay for the damage caused to a House microphone in August last year.

 MLAs Nimai Sarkar, Debasish Patnaik and Rabindra Mallick were fined Rs 60,000 for damaging the Speakers imported microphone while trying to climb on to his podium.

 In December, Mohanty followed it up by deducting the fine from the salaries of the three legislators in four instalments.

 Please remove the coins, the House cant go on like this, the Speaker pleaded as the Congress members heaped coins of various denominations on the table. A few of them landed on the carpet.

 The Speaker then adjourned proceedings for 15 minutes. When the House assembled after lunch, Mohanty directed the watch and ward staff to take away the coins.

 As the staff went to the well, the Congress members demanded that the cashier collect the money and give them a receipt. The House was subsequently adjourned four times and finally for the day as the Congress MLAs refused to let anybody touch the coins. 

 Till this evening, the Congress members were inside the Assembly. The business advisory committee of the House met later in the evening to break the deadlock but in vain. 

 The Speaker later said he would not allow the Opposition to make a mockery of parliamentary norms.

 Singh mulls all-party meet

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 23: The government was considering several options and not explicitly an ordinance on defining offices of profit, and consultations with all political parties will be held, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said shortly after Sonia Gandhi announced her resignation from Parliament this afternoon.

 The Prime Minister refused to take a question on what the options before the government were but said there is a problem. He was in favour of evolving a consensus.

 Singh was informed by Sonia of her decision to quit as MP shortly before she announced it at a news conference. He was not in the huddles at 10 Janpath last night and this morning during which the UPA chairperson made up her mind. 

 He was called by Sonia after the cabinet meeting and the meetings of the cabinet committees on security and economic affairs after which he drove to 10 Janpath.

 The Prime Minister described Sonias decision as exemplary but replied with an I dont know when asked if other MPs, including Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee, should take a cue from her.

 Mrs Sonia Gandhi is the tallest leader in our country, he said. Again, she has shown a rare commitment to moral values which we do not find in plenty in our country.

 Singh was speaking after a defence investiture ceremony at Rashtrapati Bhavan. Sonia was not present at the ceremony during which President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam presented gallantry medals to armed forces personnel. 

 Minutes before taking questions from the media, Singh confabulated with Union home minister Shivraj Patil separately after the two walked away from the gathering in the banquet room.

 Patil was in the huddles at 10 Janpath last night and this morning along with law minister H.R. Bhardwaj, defence minister Pranab Mukherjee, minister for information and broadcasting and parliamentary affairs Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, minister of state Suresh Pachouri, AICC political secretary Ahmed Patel and AICC general secretary Janardhan Dwivedi.

 The Prime Minister said the issue of office of profit affected people from different political persuasions. But he was clear that no explicit decision to push through an ordinance has been taken. 

 Singh said the decision to adjourn Parliament sine die yesterday was not taken abruptly. This decision was not taken yesterday. It was made with the consent of all political parties many, many days ago. The decision was taken because of state elections during which MPs would be busy campaigning.

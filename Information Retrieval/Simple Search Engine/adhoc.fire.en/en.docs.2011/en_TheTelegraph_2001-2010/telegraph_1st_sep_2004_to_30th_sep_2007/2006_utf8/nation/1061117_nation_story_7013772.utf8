 New Delhi, Nov. 16: Iranian foreign minister Manouchehr Mottaki today explained his countrys position on its nuclear programme to the Indian leadership and sought to expand economic ties with Delhi.

 Mottaki said Iran would go ahead with uranium enrichment at its plant at Natanz despite opposition from the US and key European countries which have been exploring ways to impose sanctions on Tehran for its nuclear programme.

 Asking Tehran to adhere to its international commitments and avoid confrontation, India said diplomacy, and not force, should be used to resolve the issue.

 Mottaki, who arrived on a two-day visit this morning, met Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and extended an invitation from President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to visit Iran.

 He will meet petroleum minister Murli Deora tomorrow for a discussion on the India-Iran-Pakistan gas pipeline project. He talked of the need for progress on the proposed project that has been hanging in balance on the issue of gas pricing. 

 The Bush administration has been opposed to the project. The US has been averse to Delhis ties with Iran and opponents of the India-US nuclear deal have also raised the issue. Mottaki also held talks with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee and foreign secretary Shiv Shankar Menon. Mukherjee told the minister that Indian companies were keen to invest in Iran and pitched for a bilateral investment pact. 

 Delhi also wants an agreement with Tehran to avoid double taxation.

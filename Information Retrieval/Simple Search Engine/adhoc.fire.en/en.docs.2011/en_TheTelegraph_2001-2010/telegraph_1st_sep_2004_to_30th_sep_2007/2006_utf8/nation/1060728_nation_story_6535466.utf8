 Rapist and mom get jail

 Ajmer, July 27 (PTI): A fast-track court today sentenced Babloo, the main accused in the rape of a Japanese tourist in Pushkar, to seven years rigorous imprisonment and sent his mother and brother to three years in jail.

 The court also slapped a fine of Rs 5,000 on Babloo and of Rs 2,000 each on his mother Roshni and brother Raju for cheating and conspiracy.

 Sanjay, another brother of Babloo, and his friend Raju Sahi ? who were among the five accused ? have been acquitted by additional district judge Mahaveer Prasad Sharma. 

 Babloo, the son of a hotel owner, had raped and robbed the tourist after drugging her with bhang on April 2. 

 The 24-year-old woman had faxed a complaint to the Ajmer superintendent of police from Agra on April 18, alleging that she was raped by the 22-year-old and that he did not return her the Rs 54,000 that she was asked to keep in safe custody with Roshni. 

 The Japanese embassy had rushed officials to Agra to record her statement. 

 After initial hearing in the Pushkar munsif court, the case had been referred to the Ajmer district judge for further hearing. It was later sent to the fast-track court. 

 Rajasthan High Court had earlier granted bail to four of the five accused but rejected a bail plea by Babloo. 

 This was the second rape case filed by a foreigner this year. The son of a top Orissa-cadre IPS officer was sentenced to seven years in jail for raping a German tourist at Alwar in April. 

 A fast-track court had convicted MBA student B.H. Mohanti of raping the 26-year-old research scholar from Berlin on the intervening night of March 20 and 21 in a hotel.

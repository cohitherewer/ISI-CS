 Domestic helps in rights cry 

 Mumbai (PTI): Thousands of workers will 

 take part in a symbolic stop-work agitation in Mumbai on 

 the domestic workers day on January 9.

 The protest will be held at Azad Maidan in south Mumbai to demand basic rights from the Maharashtra government, Anand Pawar of the Mumbai Domestic Workers Welfare Association said.

 The domestic workers are demanding that the state government recognise and give them rights as labourers by passing the Domestic Workers Bill, pending since 1998, Pawar said. Their other demands include weekly holiday with pay, medical benefits, regularised hours of work, social security and bonus.

 In Mumbai alone, 45,000 children and eight lakh adults were employed as domestic workers, he said.

 No Bihar tableau for R-Day

 Patna (PTI): For the second year in a 

 row, the tableau from Bihar would not be displayed at the 

 Republic Day parade in New Delhi.

 The theme chosen by the state government has failed to get the clearance of the defence ministry, the nodal agency for organising the January 26 ceremony, official sources said. The tableau depicted a woman offering prayer to the sun god at the Chhath festival.

 Bihar public relations department minister Arjun Rai alleged the refusal reflected the anti-Bihari mindset of the UPA government. Several changes were made in the tableau on the suggestions of the nodal agency officials but it was rejected at the last moment, he said.

 Rai said chief minister Nitish Kumar was personally looking into the matter.

 mission might be ready for takeoff by 2008, space scientist

 them to open fire.

 minister Ghulam Nabi Azad has ordered a vigilance inquiry 

 into the fire at a Gujjar hostel in Poonch.The fire destroyed 

 quake relief material kept there.

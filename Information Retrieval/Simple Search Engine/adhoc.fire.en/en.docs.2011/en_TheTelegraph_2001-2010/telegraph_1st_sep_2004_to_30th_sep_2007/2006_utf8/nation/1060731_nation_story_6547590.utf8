 Fugitive traced to Chandigarh

 Kuala Lumpur, July 30 (PTI): Former magistrate Balbir Kaur, one of Malaysias most sought-after fugitives who had disappeared from here after being charged with corruption, has been living a life of comfort in Chandigarh, a media report claimed today.

 Kaur, now 48, was arrested by Malaysias anti-corruption agency in October 1987 for allegedly taking 25,000 ringgit (Rs 3.17 lakh approximately) to acquit three Indonesians facing charges under the customs act. She jumped bail.

 She now goes by the name of Daljit Kaur, is married and has three grown-up children, The New Straits Times said. She owns a factory in Mohali.

 Kaurs whereabouts surfaced after she attested a document transferring power of attorney to her sister here in connection with a dispute over land owned by her family here. The document issued in India was certified by a Penang-based lawyer and lodged with the high court there in April.

 Deputy inspector-general Musa Hassan said the local police would liaise with Indian police before serving an arrest warrant. Interpol is involved and we leave it to them.

 Left for Nepal step-in

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 11: With anti-king demonstrations gaining ground despite a crackdown against political leaders, CPM leader Sitaram Yechury today asked Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to intervene in restoring democracy in Nepal.

 Yechury, along with Nationalist Congress Party leader B.K. Tripathi, met the Prime Minister at his residence and requested diplomatic efforts to end the political crisis in the Himalayan kingdom.

 We have asked the Prime Minister to use his good office to ensure democracy is restored in Nepal, said Yechury after meeting Singh.

 Yechury met Singh under the banner of the India-Nepal democratic solidarity committee, headed by his senior colleague Harkishen Singh Surjeet.

 The CPM leader said India should mobilise international opinion against the king and continue to suspend military aid to the Royal Nepalese Army. The solidarity forum has backed the alliance between political parties and the Maoists.

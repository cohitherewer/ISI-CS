 Cong cry to scrap council

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 27: Sonia Gandhis resignation from the National Advisory Council has led an influential section of the party to argue that it should be disbanded.

 This section feels that it is a superfluous adjunct to the government and bereft of political representation, its utility in terms of making policies and decisions is limited.

 Sonia resigned from the council and the Lok Sabha after accusations that despite being an MP, she was holding an office of profit as its chairperson and that the government was bringing an ordinance to change the law to protect her. 

 Those that are now seeking the councils demise argue that it was not needed in the first place. What was the reason except to patronise NGOs and civil rights activists? How many of the NGOs in India are genuine? they ask. 

 There are also insinuations that certain people in the party had played on the Congress presidents reported softness for NGOs while advocating the councils creation. 

 They are asking what special purpose the council would have served when there were at least three formal mechanisms to ensure the government did not veer from the common minimum programme on the basis of which the UPA was formed and the Lefts outside support obtained.

 The three forums are the UPA coordination committee, the UPA-Left coordination committee and the Congresss core committee. According to a government notification, the council was set up as an interface with civil society in regard to the implementation of the common minimum programme and to make detailed recommendations to the government in the areas of priority identified in it.

 Sources asked if this meant the three forums were not good enough to monitor the governments working or interact with civil society. 

 They contested the perception that the council represents the UPAs social face and supplies correctives on reforms. The Congress gave the corrective on reforms when we took a policy decision (in the Bangalore plenary of 2003) that reforms need to have a human face. The message to Manmohan Singh was clear. We have to contest elections and acquit ourselves before people, so how can anyone claim the party does not have peoples interests at heart and that something like the council is needed as a watchdog? a source asked.

 They also pointed out that while the Left put the brakes on divestment, the Congress had internally raised tough questions on the Indo-US nuclear deal which the Prime Minister had answered before the partys working committee put its seal of approval.

 The council did give inputs and a pro-people focus to legislation like the Right to Information Act and the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act. But, the sources said, the common minimum programme was already committed to the laws. With or without the council, Sonia would have ensured they went through. 

 In the Congress, there is a growing feeling the council controversy involving its president is something the party could have done without when it is facing elections in five states and trying to put its act together in Uttar Pradesh before the 2007 Assembly polls. 

 While there is realisation that the incident has thrown up larger issues concerning party-government coordination, the Congress must extract political mileage from Sonias second sacrifice.

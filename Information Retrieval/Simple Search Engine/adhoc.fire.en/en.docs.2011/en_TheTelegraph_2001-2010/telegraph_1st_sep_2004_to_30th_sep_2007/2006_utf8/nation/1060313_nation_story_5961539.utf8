 Board to boardroom battle for lord

 AMIT ROY

 London, March 12: Lord MacLaurin of Knebworth who, as chairman of the England and Wales Cricket Board, regularly clashed with BCCI president Jagmohan Dalmiya is now chairman of Vodafone and involved in a running battle with another Indian ?Arun Sarin.

 It must be just a coincidence that Indians continue to make life so difficult for this English aristocrat. MacLaurin apparently wants to oust Sarin as chief executive of Vodafone, one of Britains biggest companies, but it seems that if there is to be more blood on the boardroom carpet, it may be that of the Englishman.

 On the whole, these are difficult times for Indian-origin businessmen. One of them, Chai Patel, chief executive of the Priory Healthcare group who had donated ?100,000 to the Labour Party, was recommended for a peerage by Tony Blair but the Appointments Commission, the honours watchdog body, does not think that this Indian is fit to be elevated to the House of Lords and has blocked his name.

 An angry Patel has now revealed that he also gave Labour a loan of ?1.5 million, which, under present rules, did not have to be made public.

 Patel said that within weeks of agreeing to the loan, he was told he had been nominated by Blair for a peerage, which, if true, clearly constitutes an error of judgement on the part of the Prime Minister.

 Blair wants to bring more qualified Indians into the House of Lords, which is a worthy enough ambition, but in nominating Chai Patel, he has selected a man completely unknown to the Indian community in Britain. Now that Patels peerage is being blocked, he is embarrassing the Prime Minister, the Labour Party and himself by claiming he was advised he could keep quiet about the ?1.5-million loan. He has also asked the Appointments Commission to explain why his name has been blocked.

 For several weeks now, the newspapers have also been full of the troubles at Vodafone, which last year, under 51-year-old Sarins leadership, bought 10 per cent of Sunil Mittals Bharti Tele-Ventures Ltd (BTVL) for $1.5 billion. Ultimately, this might be the investment that gets Sarin out of trouble.

 From all accounts, MacLaurin and Sarin just dont get on ? in the way that MacLaurin and Dalmiya did not get on.

 Typical of their rows is the report in todays Sunday Times, headlined: MacLaurin vs Sarin: the showdown.

 Behind the troubles at Vodafone, a ?75-billion company, lie its recent poor performance. It dealt a double blow to investors last month by revealing that revenue growth was likely to be slow and its assets were overvalued by as much as ?28 billion.

 It has been reported that MacLaurin wants to get the backing of big institutional investors in an attempt to oust Sarin, who came to the UK from the United States. But Sarin has powerful supporters on the board and may turn the tables on MacLaurin, who is due to retire at the end of June, anyway.

 According to the Sunday Times, After the meeting with investors, the chairman will demand a meeting with Sarin. His decision to confront his chief executive threatens to deepen the chasm between them, and bring to a head the crisis in one of Britains biggest and most successful companies.

 In one of the most spectacular power struggles witnessed by investors, the Vodafone board has been divided between the old guard, led by MacLaurin and strongly identified with Sir Chris Gent, the former chief executive, and the new team that Sarin has started to assemble.

 In some ways, this new row is reminiscent of the power struggle between MacLaurin and Dalmiya and how cricket used to be run from Lords before the shift of power to India. These days even the ICC is based in Dubai for tax reasons.

 MacLaurin has issued a not very convincing statement: There is no showdown meeting with Arun Sarin. And Arun has the complete backing of the board.

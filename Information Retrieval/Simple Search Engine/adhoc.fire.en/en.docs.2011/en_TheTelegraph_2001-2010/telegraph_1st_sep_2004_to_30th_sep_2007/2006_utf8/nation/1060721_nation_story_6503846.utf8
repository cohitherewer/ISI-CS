 Tripura clean chit to preachers

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Agartala, July 20: Tripura police have freed the 11 detained Maharashtrian preachers, giving them a clean chit and regretting the inconvenience to them.

 The turnaround came within hours of a state Jamiat Ulema Hind team, led by its chief Mufti Tayebur Rahaman, meeting chief minister Manik Sarkar yesterday for the release of the innocent preachers. 

 By last night, the police had issued a media release describing the detainees as religious workers operating under the banner of the Tablighi Jamat and saying they would be freed.

 The Tablighis ? preachers who spread awareness of scriptures and rituals ? had been detained on July 13 from a mosque at the border village of Malaya in Dhalai district following complaints by residents.

 Police never harassed them and never registered a case but only interrogated them after detention to discharge their administrative duties, the media release said.

 However, R. Tonti and Sachin Rane, the two officers of Maharashtra polices anti-terrorist squad who came here to question them, maintained a studied silence on the subject.

 The polices suspicions had been aroused by the preachers inability to speak the local languages. But Muslim leaders said it was usual for Tablighis to travel to places far from their homes on their mission.

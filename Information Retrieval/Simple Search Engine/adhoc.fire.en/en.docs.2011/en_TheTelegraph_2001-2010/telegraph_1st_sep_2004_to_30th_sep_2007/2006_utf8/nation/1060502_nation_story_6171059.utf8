 New Delhi, May 1: Two senior ministers today came out in support of reservation in educational institutions.

 We should introduce reservations. And also increase the number of seats, meeting the aspirations of a larger number of people who want quality higher education, finance minister P. Chidambaram told a private news channel.

 Chidambaram, who is a member of the group of ministers on reservation of jobs in the private sector, rejected the argument that reservations would dilute the quality of either student intake or the quality of graduates.

 Union agriculture minister Sharad Pawar also favoured reservation, saying it was a misconception that merit was the domain of a privileged few. He asserted that peoples representatives must make laws that allow reservations for marginalised sections.

 It is good if standard educational institutions make attempts to improve quality. However, to keep away students belonging to neglected strata in the name of merit is unacceptable, Pawar said at a programme in Pune.

 It is wrong if a section of society thinks that only it has merit. Given a chance in higher education, students belonging to the neglected class of the society can also prove that they, too, have merit in them, he said.

 However, torn between those opposing and supporting reservation, the Congress adopted the Rahul Gandhi line of middle path on the complex issue.

 Echoing what the MP had said two days ago, party spokesman Abhishek Singhvi said: On an issue as valid and complex, different viewpoints and groups can have valid points. I do not see any (wrong) in that.

 SC puts plea on hold

 The Supreme Court today refused to entertain a petition seeking to strike down the constitutional amendment that provides for reservation for other backward class students in educational institutions. The court said the matter would not be heard before the government enforces the quota.

 In another case relating to reservation of seats in post-graduate medical courses, the Centre today asked the court not to direct 10 per cent seat reservation for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes within the all-India quota for at least this year.

 The Supreme Court had in an interim order asked the government to keep 10 per cent seats in abeyance after some students challenged the method of calculation of the reserved seats.

 The students had said the 22.5 per cent reservation was being calculated after excluding 50 per cent seats under the all-India quota. The court said it would hear the matter on Friday.

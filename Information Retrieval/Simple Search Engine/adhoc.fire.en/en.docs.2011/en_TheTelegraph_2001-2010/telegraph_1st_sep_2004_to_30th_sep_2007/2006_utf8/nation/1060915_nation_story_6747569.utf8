 Mumbai cops face girl heat in Bengal

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 14: Seven Mumbai police personnel were arrested in Howrah today after they failed to explain how one of the six girls they were supposed to hand over to a home in Liluah went missing in transit. 

 The seven, including four lady constables, have been charged with dereliction of duty and suppression of facts. Bally police arrested them following a complaint lodged by the authorities of the state-run Liluah Home for Destitute Women.

 They will be produced before a Howrah court tomorrow.

 After interrogation of the seven, it clearly transpired that they had failed to carry out their duty of bringing back all the rescued girls safely to the home. Besides, they had tried to suppress the fact that one of the girls had gone missing from their custody, said Howrah superintendent of police Neeraj Kumar Singh.

 Investigations revealed that the personnel part of a 15-member Mumbai police team were on their way to Howrah along with the six girls rescued from Mumbai. The magistrate of a court in Mumbai had ordered that the girls, who were staying in a shelter for women in the city, be taken back to the Liluah home from where they had gone missing.

 According to the police team, one of the girls said she wanted to go to the toilet as the train neared Bilaspur. The train was moving slowly and she managed to jump out by pushing away one of the lady constables. 

 They told us that soon after this incident, a group of four lady constables got off at Rourkela station in search of the missing girl. But there appears some loopholes since they did not lodge a complaint either at Bilaspur or in Rourkela, said a senior officer of Bally police station.

 The five girls who reached Howrah have reportedly told the police here that the personnel accompanying them had intimidated them and told them not to say anything before the district police. They alleged that some of the policemen were drunk.

 We have spoken to the girls and are probing these allegations as well, Singh said.

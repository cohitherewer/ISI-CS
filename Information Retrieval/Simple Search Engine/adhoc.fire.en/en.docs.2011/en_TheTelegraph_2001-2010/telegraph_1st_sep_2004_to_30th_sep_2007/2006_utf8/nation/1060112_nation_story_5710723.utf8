 EC turns down Jaya defer plea

 New Delhi, Jan. 11 (PTI): The Election Commission has rejected actor-turned Samajwadi Party MP Jaya Bachchans plea to postpone the hearing on a petition seeking her disqualification from the Rajya Sabha and fixed the matter for hearing tomorrow.

 In a communication sent to Jaya, the commission said if she or her authorised representative failed to appear for the hearing on Thursday, it will proceed with the matter ex-parte, or in the interests of one side only.

 Rejecting her plea for postponement, the commission said the hearing had already been deferred thrice since November last year at her request.

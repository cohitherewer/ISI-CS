 River-link cloud on monsoon engine

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, March 28: Interlinking Indias rivers on a massive scale might raise salt concentration in the Bay of Bengal and tinker with the engine that drives the monsoon, atmospheric and environmental scientists have said.

 Freshwater from the Ganga, Brahmaputra and the Mahanadi flowing into the Bay of Bengal plays a critical role in intensifying monsoon activity by maintaining low salt levels in the layer of water in the top 20 metres of the bay.

 Canals between rivers might reduce freshwater discharge into the bay, raise salinity (salt level) and affect monsoon rainfall, said Vedharaman Rajamani, professor at the school of environmental sciences at Jawaharlal Nehru University. 

 The low salinity in the Bay of Bengal sustains convection, which is the engine for the monsoon, Rajamani said. The low salinity leads to relatively higher temperatures at the sea surface, which stimulates convection and cloud formation. Increased salinity would mean lower sea surface temperatures and lower potential for cloud formation, which might mean less rain.

 We cant say with 100 per cent certainty that this will happen. Nor can we say it wont happen, he said. Physics tells us some impact is likely. We need to simulate in computer models how river links will change rainfall.

 Since the 1960s, successive governments have been evaluating proposals for connecting rivers through a complex network of canals that would transfer water across river basins and reduce the flow of river water into the sea.

 The ministry of water resources has been engaged in preparing feasibility reports on proposed links between several rivers ? Mahanadi-Godavari, Ganga-Gandak and Ganga-Damodar, among more than a dozen others. Last year, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh signed an agreement for preparation of a detailed project report on the Ken-Betwa link.

 Scientists, however, caution that not enough is known about the monsoon to predict its behaviour under reduced freshwater flow into the Bay of Bengal.

 Less freshwater discharge could indeed increase salt concentration and lower temperature. But to assume that this will also reduce the rainfall is a huge jump with a hypothesis, said Debasis Sengupta, an atmospheric scientist at the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore.

 Sengupta said common-sense physics does suggest that the lower the sea surface temperature, the lower the convection and the lower potential for clouds and rain.

 However, the region with the deepest and most persistent cloud is not always the region with the highest sea surface temperatures, he added. In a system as complex as the monsoon, common sense may not apply.

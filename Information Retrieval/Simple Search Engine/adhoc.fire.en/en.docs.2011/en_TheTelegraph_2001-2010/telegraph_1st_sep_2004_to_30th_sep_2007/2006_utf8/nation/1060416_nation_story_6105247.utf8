 Salman can go abroad

 Jodhpur, April 15 (PTI): Salman Khan was today granted permission to travel abroad by the district and sessions courts here.

 The actor can now go on a world tour for Rockstars 2006, a show that will travel to Canada, the US, the UK and Europe from April 21.

 Salman moved applications through his counsel in the two courts where he is facing trial in cases under the Arms Act and the Wildlife Protection Act.

 He has been allowed to travel abroad between April 17 and June 14 after his counsel gave an assurance that the actor would appear before the courts on the expiry of the duration and even in between, if required.

 Earlier this week, Salman was sentenced to five years rigorous imprisonment for killing a chinkara in September 1998 but was granted bail three days later. His revision petition in the case comes up for hearing on April 22.

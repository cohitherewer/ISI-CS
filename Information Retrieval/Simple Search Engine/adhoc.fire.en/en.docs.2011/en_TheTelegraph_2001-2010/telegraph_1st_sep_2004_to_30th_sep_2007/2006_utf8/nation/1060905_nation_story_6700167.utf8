 PM pill 

for chief ministers

 New Delhi, Sept. 4: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is expected to stress on the importance of a secure environment, communal harmony and sensitivity to backward sections when he addresses the chief ministers conclave here tomorrow.

 Home ministry sources said he is expected to voice concern at the possibility of a fall in overseas investments in states perceived to be susceptible to insurgency.

 The Centres feedback is investments in core infrastructure areas are not coming in at the expected rate and big companies are shying away from resource-rich states like Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Bihar. There is also apprehension that Maharashtra, the hub of economic activity, might suffer if there is a repeat of attacks like the July train blasts.

 The meeting is expected to take stock of the Salva Judum and assess whether Chhattisgarh should persist with the drive to mobilise people against Maoist rebels.

 Singh is likely to emphasise the importance of gathering intelligence from local sources instead of just relying on central inputs. He would also tell the chief ministers to ensure that law enforcers do not target a specific community in the name of fighting terror.

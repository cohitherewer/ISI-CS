 CPM wish list on eve of protest

 DEVADEEP PUROHIT

 Calcutta, July 8: First it was the DMK that forced a U-turn on divestment. Now its the turn of another ally, the CPM, to tighten the screws on the Centre on the other contentious issue ? price rise.

 Two days before its weeklong nation-wide agitation against spiralling prices, the party has finalised its main protest planks and drawn up an elaborate wish list.

 A campaign note prepared by the CPM, now being circulated among state units, traces the root of the problem to policies adopted during the National Democratic Alliance regime. It holds the NDA government responsible for the current crisis and wants Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to undo the damage.

 At the centre of the CPMs attack is the NDA governments decision to bring down the number of essential commodities from 70 to 15. Dilution of the Essential Commodities Act by removing licensing requirements, stock limits and movement restrictions on specified food items has been cited as a major reason behind the Centres inability to control spiralling prices.

 To minimise the miseries of the aam admi (common man), the CPM is demanding reversal of the policy because it allowed hoarders and black marketeers to play havoc with the supplies and prices of essential commodities.

 Another demand from the CPM is immediate prohibition on futures trading in essential commodities. Futures contracts are traded in regulated exchanges. Businessmen, holding large stocks of commodities for commercial purposes, use these instruments.

 The NDA government had permitted futures trading in all commodities, including essential commodities, through a notification in April 2003. The sharp rise in the volume of trade in commodity futures over the past two years has contributed to the price rise, the CPM note argues.

 According to the party, the impact of price rise on the common man could have been reduced had the Congress-led UPA government taken steps to strengthen the public distribution system (PDS).

 Allies set for budget battle

 New Delhi, Feb. 15: The Centre and the Left are gearing up for combat during Parliaments budget session, which begins tomorrow, reports our special correspondent.

 The Left parties ? the UPA governments most significant allies ? have decided to use the floor of the House as their battleground and the government says it will meet the challenge head on.

 We are ready for any discussion that the Speaker may admit in the House under any rule, said Prime Minister Manmohan Singh after a meeting hosted by Somnath Chatterjee for all party leaders. 

 After the CPMs recent politburo meeting in Calcutta, party general secretary Prakash Karat had threatened to put the government in the dock. 

 No-trust cry

 Days after the Left took the steam out of the proposed no-confidence motion against the Centre, the Samajwadi Party has reiterated it will bring the motion if India votes against Iran at the IAEA on March 6.

 The renewed threat came today following a meeting of its parliamentary party, which also decided to hold a rally in Delhi with the Left on March 2.

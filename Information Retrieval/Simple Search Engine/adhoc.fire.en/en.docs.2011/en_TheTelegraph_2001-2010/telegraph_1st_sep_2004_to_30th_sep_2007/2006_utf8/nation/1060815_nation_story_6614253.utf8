 Finally, Natwar turns Iraq gun on Congress

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Natwar Singh

 New Delhi, Aug. 14: Natwar Singh today described the Pathak committees report as a flawed document and suggested for the first time that while it was quick to implicate him, it was silent on the role of the Congress in the oil-for-food scam.

 Making a personal statement in the Rajya Sabha, he referred to para 15.8 of the report which, he said, clearly stated that on August 21, 2002, Iraqi oil authorities wrote to their minister seeking approval for allocating one million barrels of crude oil for the benefit of the Indian Congress Party.

 After the approval by the Iraqi oil minister, this contract was also sent for the approval of the United Nations Overseer, the former external affairs minister said.

 Justice Pathak, he added, quoting the report, then says enigmatically: How the name of the Indian Congress Party came to be mentioned in this letter is not known.

 Natwar said this was precisely what Justice Pathak was mandated to do. Instead of doing so, he surmises, as if he had entered the mind of the Iraqi authorities, that what appeared to be the reason to him was that I and my son (Jagat) so projected ourselves that the Iraqi authorities formed the impression that we were representatives of the Congress party. This is mere conjecture on his part in order to implicate me and my son and does him no credit, Natwar said.

 Pleading his innocence, he said Justice Pathaks conclusions dealing with the contract in which I was mentioned as the non-contractual beneficiary and the contract in which the Congress party was mentioned as (a) non-contractual beneficiary are at best questionable.

 He has not explained why I would ask for one contract in my name and another in the name of the Congress party. In neither case has he produced any evidence of my linkage except through surmises and assumptions.

 Natwar emphasised that he had not signed any contract, received any voucher, signed any receipt or made any transaction with any party.

 The upper House heard him in silence, barring one interruption by Suresh Pachauri, the minister of state for parliamentary affairs.

 The NDA and Samajwadi Party members, who had taken up cudgels for Natwar, sat mum.

 Parliamentary affairs minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi later said that a debate on the report would be slotted in both Houses on August 21 or 22. Congress sources said they would not spare Natwar for dragging the party and its president, Sonia Gandhi, into the controversy and insulting the Prime Minister.

 As further proof of his innocence, Natwar said that during his stay in Baghdad in January 2001, he did not discuss the oil-for-food programme with any Iraqi authority. The delegation was a political delegation. The administrative arrangements... were in the hands of Aneil Mathrani, who was the secretary of the foreign affairs department of the (Congress) party, he said. The report exonerated Mathrani.

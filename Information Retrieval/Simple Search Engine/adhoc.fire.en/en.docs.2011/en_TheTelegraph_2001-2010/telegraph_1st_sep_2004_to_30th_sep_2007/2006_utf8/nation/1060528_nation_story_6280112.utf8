 Blair boost to UN high table bid

 K.P. NAYAR

 Washington, May 27: Indias flagging campaign for a permanent seat in the UN Security Council has received an unexpected and powerful shot in the arm from an unexpected quarter ? 10 Downing Street.

 What is unexpected about the new lease of life for the Group of Four (G4), which made an aborted bid for the UNs high table last year, is not just the source of fresh support for India, Germany, Japan ? and possibly Brazil ? but the prescription for such support.

 Tony Blair, Britains embattled Prime Minister, suggested during a visit to Washington yesterday that if the UN General Assembly cannot agree on who should become permanent members in an expanded Security Council, then an interim arrangement should be found to accommodate India, Japan and Germany in the council pending a final settlement.

 I am now sure we need reform. If necessary, let us agree some form of interim change that can be a bridge to a future settlement. But we need to get it done, Blair said in a speech at Georgetown University here.

 A Security Council which has France as a permanent member but not Germany, Britain but not Japan, China but not India, to say nothing of the absence of proper representation from Latin America or Africa, cannot be legitimate in the modern world, Blair said, sparking immediate speculation here and at the UN headquarters in New York about his proposal.

 What is significant about the new British proposal is that it was made in Washington: the Bush administration has so far supported only Japans bid for a permanent place in the council. But it is well-known that the present White House needs only a prod and workable formula in the General Assembly for supporting Indias claim for permanent membership in the UNs most powerful arm.

 Yesterday, the US state department did not buy Blairs formula outright, but its spokesman, Sean McCormack, said: We support expansion of the Security Council by two or so seats... Japan being one of those seats.

 Equally significant is the timing of Blairs proposal. It comes at a time when there is fresh movement at the UN, among the G4 countries and among African states, whose support is crucial for any change in the composition of the Security Council, towards reviving the issue in time for the next General Assembly in September.

 Blair spoke out in favour of institutionalising Indias presence at the Group of Eight (G8) meeting of rich nations. The G8 now regularly meets as the G8 plus 5. That should be the norm, he said. Plus 5 is made up of India, Brazil, China, Mexico and South Africa.

 Blair also called for the merger of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund and for a successor to Kofi Annan as the UN secretary-general with more powers.

 Blairs proposals triggered an outpouring of cynicism among British journalists covering his visit here.

 Anne Penketh, diplomatic editor of The Independent, wrote: Call it the ultimate exit strategy. A $400,000 salary plus expenses, a rent-free townhouse on Manhattans East river instead of a mortgage in Bayswater... Add world travel and loads of goody bags for Cherie, and Tony Blair could well be tempted by the job of UN secretary-general, which just happens to fall vacant at the end of this year.

 Alec Russell, Washington bureau chief of The Daily Telegraph, commented: The setbacks in Iraq inevitably overshadowed his visit to Washington, which may be his last as Prime Minister...Mr Blair was clearly trying to move the domestic and international debate on from the rifts over Iraq to how to tackle future crises.

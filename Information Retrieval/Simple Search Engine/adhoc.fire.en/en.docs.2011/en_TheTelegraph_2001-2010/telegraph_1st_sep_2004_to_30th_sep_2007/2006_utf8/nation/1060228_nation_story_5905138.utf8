 Township plan to unlock idle land

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Feb. 27: The RPG Group will develop a township and an industrial park at Mulajore, the address of its closed power plant.

 Sanjeev Goenka, the vice-chairman of the group, said the township would come up on a 30-acre plot while another five acres would be developed for the industrial park.

 We will develop a modern township complete with all the amenities like supermarket, clubs and stores, Goenka said today at a programme where Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee laid foundation stones for three RPG Group projects.

 The 43-acre plot, located in a densely populated area, housed a power plant which had to be closed down because of pollution. 

 The remaining eight acres at the site will be used by the RPG Enterprises-owned CESC.

 The Bengal chief minister requested Goenka that the industrial park be reserved for small-sector, IT and non-polluting industries.

 Goenka did not rule out the possibility of joining hands with a partner to develop the project.

 The Mulajore project comes close on the heels of the state governments nod to the Bata township project. There, too, a residential complex and a non-polluting industrial park will come up.

 Goenka said the Mulajore initiative is part of a plan to unlock the value of idle real estate assets.

 In the next few months, we will unlock value in a phased manner of all its (RPG Group) non-profitable and under-profitable properties across the country, Goenka said.

 The group has identified properties in Maharashtra, Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Karnataka to be unlocked.

 We are preparing a register of properties to be unlocked. An internal team is working on it and the process should be over in the next eight weeks, Goenka said.

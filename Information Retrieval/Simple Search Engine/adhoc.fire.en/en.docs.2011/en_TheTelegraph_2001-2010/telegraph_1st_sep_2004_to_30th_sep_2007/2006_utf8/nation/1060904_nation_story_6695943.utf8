 A train that was blasted in Borivli on July 11

 Mumbai, Sept. 3: The anti-terrorist squad (ATS) today formally arrested suspected al Badr militant Akmal Hashmi in the July 11 serial blasts case, bringing the total number of arrests to 10.

 Picked up in south Kashmir on August 23, Hashmi alias Abu Ahmed told his interrogators that the Lashkar-e-Toiba had executed the 7/11 blasts in Mumbai local trains. The outfit had dispatched 17 members to Mumbai to execute the plan and 16 of them had returned to Pakistan, he told Jammu and Kashmir police.

 After Jammu and Kashmir police informed their counterparts in Mumbai, the ATS sought Hashmis custody and brought him to Mumbai by train last night. After preliminary interrogations, he was formally arrested.

 In the remand application, he has been named an accused in the Mahim blast, one of the seven explosions, and a conspiracy charge has been slapped on him.

 The police said Hashmi worked as a divisional commander for Al Badr and they needed to interrogate him about his reported statement that he had knowledge of the July 11 plot. The court remanded him in police custody till September 13.

 ATS chief K.P. Raghuvanshi, however, refused to divulge any details about Hashmis role in the bombings. 

 We have watched the CDs of his statement. We want to verify his statement. It is more or less confirmed that the terror plan received local support and we are trying to tie up the loose ends, he said.

 Two other accused have been taken to Bangalore for lie-detector and narcoanalysis tests. Kamal Ahmed Ansari, the Madhubani resident and one of the first arrests in the case, and Tanvir Ahmed Ansari, a unani medical practitioner, will be subjected to the tests tomorrow, sources said.

 The squad has also received an alert from central intelligence agencies about a terror squad of four to six members which could strike during the Ganesh festival. 

 The 10-day festival ends on September 6. On that day, thousands of devotees will head to Mumbais six waterfronts to immerse Ganesh idols, posing a security challenge to Mumbai police.

 Sources said the alert warned about a possible strike by a group named Armed Islamic Group of Algeria. 

 The alert also identified the operatives in the terror module as Abdullah Wahab, a 39-year-old explosives expert from Algeria, Yasman Kadeera, a 27-year-old operative involved in such operations in Yemen and Algeria, Kalile Mauchier, 35, and Hasan.

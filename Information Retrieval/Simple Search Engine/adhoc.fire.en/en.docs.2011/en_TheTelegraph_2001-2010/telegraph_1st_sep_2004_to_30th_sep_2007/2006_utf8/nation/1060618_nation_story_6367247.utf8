 Quota ball passed to govt

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 17: Oversight committee chairperson Veerappa Moily has left it to the Centre to finalise the bill for implementing 27 per cent quota for Other Backward Classes in higher education institutions.

 After a meeting of the committee earlier this week, Moily had indicated that he would prefer the government to finalise the bill after the panel submits its interim report.

 But he changed tack after a discussion with human resource development minister Arjun Singh. Moily now says the committee has no intentions of interfering with the bill. It is entirely the prerogative of the Centre and Parliament to finalise it.

 Moilys ambivalent statements had created confusion about the status of the bill and whether the HRD ministry would wait for the committees approval before it introduced the bill in Parliament. The ministry, however, had maintained from the outset that the bill had nothing to do with the committee.

 The legislation will carry enabling provisions for fulfilling the 93rd Constitutional Amendment Act that was passed to give reservation to OBC students.

 Titled Central Educational Institutions (Reservation of seats and regulation of admission and fee) Bill, it will specify three categories of quotas ? 27 per cent for OBCs, 15 per cent for Scheduled Castes and 7.5 per cent for Scheduled Tribes.

 For the first time, all the three categories of reservation will be applicable not only to the government institutions but also to unaided private institutions and deemed universities. So far, the private institutions and the deemed universities did not have to keep quotas even for SC and ST students.

 The bill regulating foreign universities that will be brought in the monsoon session of Parliament makes quotas mandatory for foreign institutions, too. They will have to reserve seats for OBC, SC and ST students if they want to start institutions in India.

 The bill will give the University Grants Commission the authority to lay down rules for monitoring admissions and fixing fees. A two-tier fee structure is possible to give greater concessions to OBC, SC and ST students.

 The bill also seeks to ensure compliance from private institutions. The Centre is empowered to monitor the implementation of quota and punish defaulters. Punishment could take the form of withdrawal of grants in the case of the deemed universities.

 The bill will apply only to central universities, IITs and IIMs. States will have to put together their own quota rules and the percentage of reservation for OBC students.

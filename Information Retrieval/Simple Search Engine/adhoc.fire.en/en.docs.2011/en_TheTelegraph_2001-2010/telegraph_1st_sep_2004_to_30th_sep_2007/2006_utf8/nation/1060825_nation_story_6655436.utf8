 Textiles to terror twist

 Mumbai, Aug. 24: Unaffected by the hustle and bustle around him, Abdul Qadir Kolsawala quietly spreads a mat on the floor and offers namaaz-e-esha, the last prayer of the day. That done, he gazes at the news channels his youngest son, Yakub, has been glued to. Yakub is trying to find out if his brother Ayubs 24-hour ordeal is finally over.

 Ayubs travails have shaken Memon Colony in Jogeshwari, a Sunni neighbourhood minutes away from the Jogeshwari railway crossing, where one of the seven train bombs exploded on July 11. Five of the 12 Indians detained and later freed by Dutch authorities from the Northwest Airlines flight escorted back to Amsterdam are from here.

 Ayub owns Seasons Garments, an outfit specialising in the import and export of readymade garments like bridal wear and salwar-kameez. He travels to Mauritius, South Africa and Port of Spain once in a few months to attend trade fairs, where he finds it easy to scout for orders.

 More than 45 garment exporters, including my son, travelled to Port of Spain for a fair on July 25. Some of them returned a few days ago. Ayub called us an hour before his flight from Amsterdam and told us he would reach Mumbai on Wednesday night, says Qadir.

 Until Wednesday evening, when news of the arrests filtered in, the Kolsawalas had no idea one of their own would be in the dock. We had no idea it could be our people. These are all young, hard-working, family-oriented individuals. How could we imagine that they can be detained as terrorists? We got worried when none of them answered their mobiles, Qadir said, adding Ayubs wife and his two kids spent a sleepless night.

 Even on Thursday evening, the family could not get in touch with Ayub or others in the group. 

 Yakubs wife Lubna, a teacher in a nearby school, tried to contact Northwest Airlines and got through to BNH Schiphol, the airport hotel where rooms for the stranded passengers had been booked. Someone there told me Ayub had stayed at the hotel, and even boarded a flight to Mumbai. Then, the list was released and we found his name on it. When the government knew Indians had been detained, should it not have intimated us or provided information? she asked.

 Sanober Chhotani, whose husband Shakeel Chhotani runs the garments business with Ayub, was fuming at the discrimination Muslims face after terror attacks. Isnt it a basic human right that a person be allowed to call his family even if he is detained for questioning?

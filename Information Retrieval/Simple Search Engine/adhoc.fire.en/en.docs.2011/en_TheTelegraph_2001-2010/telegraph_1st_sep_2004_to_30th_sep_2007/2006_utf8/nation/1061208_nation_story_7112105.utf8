 Sporting Sidhu files bail bond

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chandigarh, Dec. 7: As a quote it fell short of a Sidhuism, but the signs were clear that after a rather subdued day, Navjyot Singh Sidhu was returning to form.

 I am not worried. I believe in today and not tomorrow, the former cricketer said today as he submitted his bail bond at a magistrates court.

 Today, he treated his ordeal on a par with a setback on the cricket pitch. 

 I have been a sportsperson and have had many ups and downs, the TV commentator and BJP member said.

 Sidhu, granted bail till January 31, said he would soon file a special leave petition in the apex court and appeal against the sentence.

 His bail bond of Rs 10,000 was submitted by Chand-igarh BJP chief Yashpal Mahajan, while a local lawyer deposited the amount for co-accused Rupinder Singh Sandhu, who also got three years.

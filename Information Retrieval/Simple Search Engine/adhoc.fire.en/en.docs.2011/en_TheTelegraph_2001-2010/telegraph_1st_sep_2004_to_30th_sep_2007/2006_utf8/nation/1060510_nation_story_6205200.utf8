The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Nation at a Glance

 House channel set for dry run

 New Delhi (PTI): The Lok Sabha television 

 channel, claimed to be the first in the world to be run 

 by a legislature, will start its experimental run from Thursday.

 The channel has taken shape as Speaker Somnath Chatterjee is keen to extend the visitors galleries of Parliament to every household and bring the Houses closer to the people, sources said.

 Chatterjee had earlier opened up the Zero Hour for live telecast and put the House proceedings live on Doordarshans satellite channel.

 The channel will close down temporarily after the conclusion of the second phase of the budget session which begins on Wednesday. The experimental run is like a full dress rehearsal for the two 24-hour channels for the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha.

 TV terror threat in Valley

 Srinagar (PTI): Cable television 

 operators in Srinagar have stopped beaming several entertainment

 All cable TV services across the city were disrupted from 12.30 pm on Tuesday. The services resumed after two hours without some entertainment channels and all news channels.

 inspector on poll duty at a counting centre in Tamil Nadus

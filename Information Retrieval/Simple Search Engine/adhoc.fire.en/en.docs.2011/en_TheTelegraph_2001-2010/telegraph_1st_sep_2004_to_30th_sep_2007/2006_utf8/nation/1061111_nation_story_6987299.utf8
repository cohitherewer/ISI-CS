 Abhishek Bachchan: Eligible?

 Abhishek Bachchan is to be honoured with the Yash Bharti Samman Uttar Pradeshs highest award for culture in a decision that has sparked a controversy. 

 The junior Bachchan will receive the award from chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav at Gomti Nagar in Lucknow on November 20, the second time this year that the Yash Bharti awards are being given away. The first time was in February.

 It is not just the decision to give away the awards twice in the same year that has raised eyebrows, questions are being asked whether Abhishek is at all eligible. The award is meant to honour people either born in the state or those who have lived here for a considerable period of time and have contributed to the state. 

 But Mohan Swaroop, the culture secretary, insists the actor fits the bill because he has an ancestral home in Uttar Pradesh. He fulfils the criterion, Swaroop said.

 The department of culture has also defended the decision to hold the programme for the second time this year. Of course the chief minister can hold a programme anytime he wishes to honour someone who has contributed to the growth of the states culture. This programme is happening in the current financial year. The February programme was held with funds for the last financial year, Swaroop said.

 Abhishek will be the fourth from his family to get the award, after grandfather Harivansh Rai Bachchan, who was a poet, and parents Amitabh and Jaya. While Jaya is a Rajya Sabha MP of the ruling Samajwadi Party, Amitabh is known to be very close to the partys leadership and is often seen sharing the dais with Mulayam and his general secretary Amar Singh. 

 For the Bachchan son, this will not be his first brush with controversy in the heartland state. The Uttar Pradesh governments decision to make his film Bunty Aur Babli tax-free had sparked a row, especially because the film that was passed up was Bose: The Forgotten Hero.

 Is Abhishek at the pinnacle of his life that the state government should list his name among other stalwarts? asked Akhilesh Pratap Singh, the Congress spokesperson. 

 Cricketer Mohammed Kaif, journalist Sheetala Singh, historian Yogesh Praveen, poet Uday Pratap Singh and four wrestlers from Etawah are the other awardees. Mulayam, himself a wrestler, is a great patron of the game.

 Omissions from the list, especially that of Manoj Tewari, an actor responsible for a resurgence in the Bhojpuri film industry, and classical artiste Kishan Maharaj, have also raised eyebrows. 

 Tewaris name was announced by the chief minister at a rally in eastern Uttar Pradesh, where the star hails from, but does not figure on the list. BJP leader Lalji Tandon has protested Kishan Maharajs omission.

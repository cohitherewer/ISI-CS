 Quota troops get set for showdown

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 20: The government may be keeping quiet on the move to reserve seats for students from Other Backward Classes in central educational institutions till the Assembly polls are over, but the quota cries are getting louder.

 The demand got a fillip after the Election Commission charged human resource development minister Arjun Singh with violating the model code of conduct by announcing a reservation policy. Singh denied the allegation and told the poll panel that he had not announced any reservation for OBCs.

 A parliamentary forum of OBC MPs are up in arms, reminding the UPA government of the promises it had made through a legislation at the beginning of this year. An amendment to Article 15 of the Constitution empowered the government to provide a quota for OBCs in educational institutions.

 We will hold a meeting of the OBC MPs as soon as Parliament meets on May 10 to firm up our resolve to get the government to take an early decision on the reservation issue. Our delegation will also convey our views to HRD minister Arjun Singh and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, convener of the forum and Congress MP Hanumantha Rao said.

 So, office of profit is not the only controversy that will keep Parliament on the boil when it meets on May 10. The quota chorus ? which is growing shriller by the day despite the poll panels attempts to shove it under the carpet ? is likely to trigger a bigger storm.

 Rao said though the forum is trying to involve MPs belonging to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, too, its demand at the moment is restricted to reservations for OBC students in central educational institutions, including IITs and IIMs.

 We are, however, not opposed to reservation of jobs in the private sector. But we will take it up later, as topmost on our agenda, for which the forum was created, is to secure such reservations for the OBCs as are already enjoyed by the SCs and STs in educational institutions, Rao said.

 As soon as the Election Commission withdraws its whip after the completion of polls in Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Assam and Pondicherry, all political parties would be raising their voices to demand reservation for OBC students, making things easier for the forum, he added.

 Already, there are enough indications that the quota storm has taken into its fold almost all political parties. 

 The Congress, in particular, is afraid of the disastrous consequences if it does not act swiftly to fulfil the expectations it has raised by promising to implement reservations in central educational institutions. 

 Any delay might harm the Congress more than any other party, a senior Congress leader said on the condition of anonymity.

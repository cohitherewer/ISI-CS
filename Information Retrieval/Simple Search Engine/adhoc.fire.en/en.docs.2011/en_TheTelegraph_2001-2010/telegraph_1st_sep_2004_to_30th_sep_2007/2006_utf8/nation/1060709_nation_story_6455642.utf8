 Dwivedi in Ambika shoes

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 8: Congress general secretary Janardhan Dwivedi was today appointed the chairperson of the partys media department.

 The post held by Ambika Soni had been lying vacant for six months after she left the Congress organisation to join the Union cabinet as tourism minister.

 Dwivedi, considered the second-most powerful person in the Congress after Sonia Gandhis political secretary Ahmed Patel and who writes most of Sonias Hindi speeches, will be assisted by Abhishek Singhvi, designated the media departments vice-chairman.

 Congress sources said that after her wake-up call to the Manmohan Singh government to get cracking on the crises it faced ? from reservations for Other Backward Classes to price rise and food imports ? Sonia has got down to putting the organisation in order.

 She is expected to reconstitute the state Congress committees and reallocate the charge of Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh, which are still with Soni, now the tourism and culture minister.

 The other general secretaries to be inducted in the media department are Satyavrat Chaturvedi and Mukul Wasnik. Chaturvedi will be the Congresss chief spokesperson and Wasnik and Jayanthi Natarajan will assist him.

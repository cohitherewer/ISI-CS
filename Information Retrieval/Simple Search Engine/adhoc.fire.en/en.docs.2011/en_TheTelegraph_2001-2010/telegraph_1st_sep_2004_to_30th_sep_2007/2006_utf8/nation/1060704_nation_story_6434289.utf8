 Cops tap Kashmir militants mobiles

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Jammu, July 3: State police claim to have obtained the mobile numbers of scores of militants after busting a network that provided pre-paid SIM cards to rebels under false names.

 The cellphones of 30 Lashkar-e-Toiba and Hizb-ul Mujahideen commanders are already under surveillance, officers said. A list of another 30 numbers is being drawn up.

 The police claimed they had already got important leads from the militants conversations.

 With their satellite phone and radio messages regularly intercepted by the security forces in the past, the militants have largely switched to mobile phones, officers explained. The rebels allegedly paid several Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited franchisees heavily for the illegal connections.

 Since customers in the state can get SIM cards only after a thorough background check, the militants were issued the connections in the names of citizens who had no clue about it.

 Sandeep Kumar, a sales executive with a BSNL franchisee at Jammus Bahu Plaza, and his alleged Lashkar link, Javed Ahmed, have been arrested.

 Rajouri police chief Farooq Khan said the racket had been active for several months. We are trying to find out all the details.

 Most of these pre-paid SIM cards had been issued by the Bahu Plaza-based distributor, the police said. A leading BSNL franchisee based in Gandhi Nagar in the heart of Jammu city, too, is allegedly part of the network.

 The racket was unearthed on May 25, the second day of Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs roundtable conference in Srinagar, following a call to the police from Hizb militant Mohammad Yasin.

 Yasin, a former special police officer, called up the police control room at Rajouri, 150 km from here, from his mobile and falsely claimed a massacre in the border district.

 After investigations, the police discovered that the mobile connection was registered in the name of an engineer working for a private company.

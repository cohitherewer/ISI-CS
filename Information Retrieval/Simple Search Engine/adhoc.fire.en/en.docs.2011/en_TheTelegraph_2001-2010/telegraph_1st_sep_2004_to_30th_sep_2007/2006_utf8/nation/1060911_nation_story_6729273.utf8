 Six-month jail for torturing wife

 New Delhi (PTI): A local court has sentenced a man to six months in prison for harassing his wife who died after being allegedly set ablaze by his mother in February 2001, in east Delhi.

 Giving credence to the dying declaration of Rahisa that her husband Shahid used to beat her without provocation, additional sessions judge Sanjay Sharma awarded the jail term to the accused under Section 498a (subjecting a woman to cruelty) of the IPC.

 Shahids mother Wahidan, accused of setting Rahisa on fire after dousing her with kerosene, had died in Tihar Jail during the pendency of the trial.

 The two co-accused in the case, nieces of Shahid who handed over the match box to Wahidan, are facing trial in a juvenile court.

 The judge, however, absolved Shahids sister-in-law, another co-accused, for want of evidence. Shahid was also absolved of murder, as he was absent during the incident.

 According to the prosecution, Rahisas in-laws used to torture her for not bringing enough dowry.

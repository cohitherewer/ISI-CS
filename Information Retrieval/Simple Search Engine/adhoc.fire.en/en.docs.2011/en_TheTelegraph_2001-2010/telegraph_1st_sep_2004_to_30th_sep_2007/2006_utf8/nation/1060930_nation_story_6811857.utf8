 Sealing breather for traders

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 29: Traders in Delhi got a festival bonus today when the Supreme Court gave them the nod to operate from residential areas covered by a government notification permitting mixed-land use. 

 Dismissing a plea challenging the validity of the notification, a bench headed by Chief Justice Y.K. Sabharwal said there will be no sealing of properties in areas protected by the notification till it was invalidated. But the government cant issue any new notification without the courts nod.

 The court also allowed small neighbourhood shops to stay on, but the owners would have to register themselves by December 31. Those traders who have given an undertaking to stop operations can also continue till October 31. But sealing will go on in areas not protected by the notification and the Delhi Laws (Special Provisions) Act, 2006.

 The Group of Ministers on sealing welcomed the order and said the notification would provide relief to lakhs of people in the capital. We are examining the interim order in detail and will again convene a meeting within a week, home minister Shivraj Patil said.

 With both the notification and the act being enforced after the Supreme Courts directive to seal commercial properties in residential areas, residents had challenged them on the ground that they were meant to circumvent the order.

 Indian air hostesses for China 

 Beijing, May 30 (Agencies): China Eastern Airlines Company Ltd, the only Chinese airlines that operates a direct flight to India, will deploy Indian nationals as air hostesses for the first time on its Beijing-Shanghai-New Delhi flight from June 3, the company announced today. 

 China Eastern, based in Shanghai, announced that 16 Indian girls had completed professional training as air stewardesses and would work on the Beijing-Shanghai-New Delhi route. They are the first group of Indian stewardesses ever hired by a Chinese air company, Xinhua news agency reported. Their monthly salary will be $800. 

 The airlines opened flights from Beijing to Shanghai and then to New Delhi in March 2002 amid warming economic and diplomatic ties between the two countries. Now, there are four weekly flights on the route. The company also began to provide air services for passengers from Beijing and Shanghai to Mumbai and vice versa in April last year. It increased its flights between the two nations to seven a week.

 To recruit foreign stewardesses is one of the measures it has taken to further localise its air services. It has recruited 100 in-flight attendants from countries like Japan, South Korea and India and plans to recruit more from Russia and the Philippines. 

 Chinas flight schools can produce barely half the 1,200-1,600 new pilots required each year by the rapidly expanding aviation industry, with shortages of qualified flight attendants nearly as severe.

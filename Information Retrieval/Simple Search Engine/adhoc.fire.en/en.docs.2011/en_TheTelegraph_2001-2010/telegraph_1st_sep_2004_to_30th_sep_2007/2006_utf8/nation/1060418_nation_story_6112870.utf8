 Watch it! Tech tabs on crime loopholes

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi. April 17: In three police stations in Mumbai, police will soon get a special pen that creates digital records of everything written with it and produce what might be the countrys first tamperproof first information reports (FIRs).

 In a forensic science laboratory in Gujarat, scientists are trying to refine a technique of reading electrical signals from the human brain that will help investigators tell whether a person was at a crime scene or not.

 In New Delhi, engineers are designing a recording system to capture courtroom proceedings. And in Bangalore, police might soon carry hand-held computers to record text, audio, and video at crime scene investigations.

 Indias science and technology ministry has launched technology projects to plug loopholes in criminal investigation and law enforcement processes.

 Its technology to do away with human interference, science and technology minister Kapil Sibal said today, releasing details of the projects coordinated by the government-funded Technology Information Forecasting and Assessment Council (Tifac).

 The projects are expected to be completed in the next 12 to 18 months. Civil society would then have to decide how to make use of the technologies, he said. Some amendments in laws might need to be pursued to facilitate their use.

 In the digital pen and paper technology that will be field tested in Malabar Hill and two other police stations in Mumbai, a pen electronically records all that is written with it on a special paper used to record FIRs. An electronic record of the text will allow investigators to track any changes that are subsequently made in the FIRs as well as facilitate rapid FIR retrieval through key words, a senior Tifac officer said.

 The tamperproof secure courtroom digital recording and video conferencing system will record court proceedings and store them in a server. They need not be available for public viewing. But appeals courts could call for and scan such proceedings in the event of conflicting claims about what had transpired during the original proceedings.

 The handheld computer that Bangalore police will experiment with in the coming months will facilitate tamperproof acquisition, storage and transmission of crime scene investigations data. Any changes to the records will be tracked.

 The brain-mapping studies under way at the forensics science laboratory in Gandhinagar are aimed at harnessing electrical signals from the brain to determine whether a person had actually experienced a situation ? a crime scene, for instance ? prior to the test.

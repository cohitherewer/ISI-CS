The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Offer rain at Jobs Mart

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Dec. 9: Not just tech talk and tech tools, Infocom 2006 is offering much more. 

 It has been raining jobs at The Telegraph Jobs Mart as Day One of the fair saw as many as 50 offers being made by various companies to aspirants signing up for career counselling with the recruiters. 

 The response on the first day of the two-day Jobs Mart has been overwhelming. We have had 3,000-plus registrations today, an organiser said. 

 During the career counselling sessions, representatives from recruiters briefed the aspirants about the nature of jobs on offer and the skill-set the companies were looking for. 

 As a steady stream of aspirants poured into the counselling hubs, companies like Genpact were forced to postpone final interviews to a later date. 

 We did not even have time for a breather because of the number of people who turned up for the counselling sessions, a representative at the Genpact stall said. 

 Genpact has collected 1,000-odd resumes and has made four definite offers for BPO jobs while another one will be confirmed on December 18. The company will shortlist more candidates and interview them at a later stage. 

 Hero Mindmine, a training and hiring outfit, finalised 20-odd candidates for IBM while Xponse shortlisted six. These candidates will go for a second round of interviews in a weeks time for the final placement.

 Around 500 candidates were shortlisted during the day by several companies. Google zeroed in on 150 candidates through a test organised on the flanks of Jobs Mart. 

 We have a rigorous round of interviews which cant be undertaken here. Those shortlisted are being given the address of the venue for the interviews, said a representative at the Google stall. 

 The Jobs Mart will continue tomorrow and registrations can be made till 7 in the evening. We are expecting a bigger turnout on the last day, an organiser said.

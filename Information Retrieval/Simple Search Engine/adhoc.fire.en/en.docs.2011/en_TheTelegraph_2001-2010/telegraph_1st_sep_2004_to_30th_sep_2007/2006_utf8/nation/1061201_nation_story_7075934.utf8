 Miners trapped

 Andal, Nov. 30: Six miners were feared killed when a ceiling of a coal mine in Burdwans Andal area caved in this morning.

 Police said 215 workers, who were on night shift, were inside the Eastern Coalfields Ltd (ECL) mine at Shyamsundarpur, about 220 km from Calcutta. Around 4.45 am, a portion of the ceiling around 400 sq ft gave way. 

 Rescuers pulled out 209 miners. There was no trace of the rest of them till late this evening. ECL officials said chances of the six miners being alive were almost zero. 

 The workers had just started blasting when the ceiling came down. Unable to bear the intensity of the blast, the ceiling might have collapsed, an official said.

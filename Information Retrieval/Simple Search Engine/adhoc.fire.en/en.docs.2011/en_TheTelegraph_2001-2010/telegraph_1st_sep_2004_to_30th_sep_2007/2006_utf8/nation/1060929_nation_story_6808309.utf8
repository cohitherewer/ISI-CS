 Phoolan clone shot dead

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, Sept. 28: Uttar Pradesh police have shot dead Rano Devi, ending the reign of fear unleashed by one of the few women bandits in the Chambal ravines.

 The 22-year-old and four members of the dreaded Deo Kumar gang were felled today in an encounter at Aiena village under Aurraiya police station, about 175 km from here.

 Rano, one of the youngest recruits in the gang, kept firing from the jungles. Etawah superintendent of police, Ashoke Jain, who oversees the area around Aurraiya, said she held out till the last minutes.

 Deo Kumar had this lone woman in his gang and had used her in the recent abduction of four people. She could be a new recruit. But she may well have been the last surviving woman dacoit. There is no other in the ravine that we know of, Uttar Pradesh additional director-general of police Padam Singh said today.

 Women bandits held sway over Chambal for years starting with Phoolan Devis reign in the 80s. But recent months have witnessed only reverses. Sarala Jatav surrendered last year. Eighteen-year-old Manorama of the Satpal gang was also a force to reckon with till a couple of months back when she gave up arms.

 For many gangs, women had become a status symbol. But rivalry between groups and the police crackdown made them realise it wasnt safe any more to have women members, said DIG (Kanpur zone) Daljit Singh Chaudhary.

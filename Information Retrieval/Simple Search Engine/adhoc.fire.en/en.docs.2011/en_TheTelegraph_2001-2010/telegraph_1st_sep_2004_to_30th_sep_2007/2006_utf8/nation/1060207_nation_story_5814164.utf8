 Police await VP blood report

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Feb. 6: Standard Chartered Bank vice-president Neel Chatterjees blood sample was today sent for testing to a laboratory to ascertain if he was drunk when he knocked down a man in central Mumbai on Saturday night.

 The sample could not be sent by doctors to the lab yesterday as it was a Sunday. A report is expected tomorrow or on Wednesday.

 The report would determine if Chatterjee could be charged with drunk driving. 

 Witnesses said Chatterjee had appeared to be drunk when his black Mercedes hit temple watchman Ramakant Dhuri and sped away. Dhuri succumbed to head injuries in hospital.

 Chatterjee was arrested and charges of rash driving causing death, misbehaving with a public servant and not assisting and reporting the accident were slapped on him. The offences are collectively punishable with nearly four and a half years imprisonment. As all the offences are bailable, he was released yesterday after furnishing a cash bail of Rs 10,000.

 Dadar police station inspector Suhas Raikar said: We have not called Chatterjee for questioning today, but we will once we finish recording the statements of eyewitnesses.

 Standard Chartered today described the accident as an unfortunate incident and said it was saddened by the reported loss of human life. 

 Chatterjees wife answered a call to his mobile phone, saying: He has gone out to meet his lawyers. 

 His lawyer said he had asked Chatterjee to pay compensation to the victims family.

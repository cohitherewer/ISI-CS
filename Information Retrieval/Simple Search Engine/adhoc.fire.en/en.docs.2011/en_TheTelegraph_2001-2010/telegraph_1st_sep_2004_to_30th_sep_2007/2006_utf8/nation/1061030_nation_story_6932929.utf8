 New Delhi, Oct. 29: Running from one casualty ward to another with a calm reassurance about him and responding to seemingly endless cries of desperation from families urging doctors to look at their loved ones, Sunil Mishra could pass off as an experienced specialist.

 In the fifth year of his MBBS, Mishra is just an intern at Safdarjung Hospital, but pressure is not new to him.

 Mishra was one of the hundred-odd MBBS students pushed into service before their time, forced to come face to face with the aftermath of terror bodies of the dead, and of those still alive, but with blood rushing out like water over a broken dam.

 The night of October 29, 2005, is still fresh in their memories. The day Delhi suffered its largest number of casualties to a single organised act of terror was also the day these boys and girls all aged between 19 and 22 discovered themselves. Discovered, they say, what their work could really be about.

 We were just packing our bags to go home for Diwali when the medical superintendent at our college came to our hostel and told us we were needed here, recalls Mishra.

 Third- and fourth-year students from nearby medical colleges, including AIIMS and Maulana Azad Medical College, were asked to rush to Safdarjung where police brought the injured from the two most devastating blasts at Sarojini Nagar and Paharganj.

 Mishra and around 10 others came from a Kurukshetra medical college.

 That was the day we grew into doctors, in a sense, says Swastika Gupta, a student of the Maulana Azad college who has been granted special permission to do her internship at Safdarjung. Normally, students of colleges with hospitals attached are expected to undergo internship there itself.

 A year on, the nightmarish scenes still replay themselves before them, the interns say.

 Rumours had flown thick and fast as the doctors travelled from across the city to Safdarjung. Once they reached the emergency wards though, all rumours were pushed aside by the sight before them.

 The only department giving the emergency competition that day was the mortuary department, says Amit Singh, senior surgeon at Safdarjung Hospital.

 The students were divided into groups some to carry out blood transfusion, others assigned as assistants in life-saving surgeries. As much as we worked, we could not have done much without these youngsters, says Singh.

 It was 48 hours before many of the doctors took a break, by when it was mostly clear who would live, and who were unlikely to.

 Some of lifes toughest lessons had been learnt and it was time to go back to college.

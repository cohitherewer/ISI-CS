 Spotlight on spoiler in record TN poll

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chennai, May 9: The spotlight has turned on filmstar-turned-politician Vijaykant, who could play spoiler, in an election that has seen the highest turnout since 1984 ? 70.22 per cent. 

 The exceptionally high polling in the close fight between the ADMK and the DMK for the 234-member House has sparked speculation about how many votes Vijayakants Desiya Murpokku Dravidar Kazhagam (DMDK) will get and whose votes it will cut into. 

 The DMDK is contesting 232 of the 234 Assembly seats. Reports from the districts reaching here today suggest that the long queues outside polling stations had a good number of youths and first-time voters who might have backed Vijayakant, for the sake of novelty or because they were fed up of both the main parties. 

 The actor-politician, contesting from Viruddhachalam, said: I see a silent wave in favour of my party. 

 State chief electoral officer Naresh Gupta, who released the final polling figures here this evening, said tsunami-hit Nagapattinam had a turnout of 75.45 per cent and neighbouring Tiruvarur 75.8 per cent. Karur, in the heart of the Cauvery delta, polled the highest for any single district at 77.15 per cent, he said. 

 More men than women came out to vote, with the ratio 51:49. A higher turnout of women has in recent years gone in favour of the Jayalalithaa-led ADMK in the state with 4.64 crore voters. 

 Although most exit polls have pointed at a big win for the DMK-led alliance, this is a tough election outcome to predict. Counting will be held on May 11. Electoral rolls being in good condition, more enthusiasm among voters and the contest being seen as tough could be the reasons for the record turnout, Gupta said. 

 He also announced that the Election Commission had ordered repolling in 18 booths across 12 Assembly constituencies tomorrow, mainly because of malfunctioning of electronic voting machines.

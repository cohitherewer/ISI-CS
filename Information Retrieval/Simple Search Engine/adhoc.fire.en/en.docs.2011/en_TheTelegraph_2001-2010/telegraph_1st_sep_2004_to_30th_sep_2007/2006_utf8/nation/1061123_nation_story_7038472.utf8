 Cong to speak for aam admi

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 New Delhi, Nov. 22: Eager to convey the message that the Congresss hand is still with the common man, the party has decided to use Parliaments winter session to raise issues that will appeal to the aam admi even if this means embarrassing the government.

 The Congresss chief whip in the Rajya Sabha, V. Narayanaswamy, has given a notice for a discussion under Rule 176 on streamlining the public distribution system.

 The House business advisory committee has yet to take a call on admitting the notice but party sources said they were sure of a discussion because their chief, Sonia Gandhi, was keen on one.

 A notice for a discussion on the Centres policy on special economic zones (SEZ) another subject that reportedly interests Sonia is likely.

 Narayanaswamy said senior Congress MPs of the Rajya Sabha will meet tomorrow or on Friday to finalise how the notice should be phrased.

 The Congress also wanted to give a notice on price rise but was pre-empted by the Left. The business advisory committees of both Houses today decided to slot a discussion on price rise next week.

 Party sources said the Centre is still far from fulfilling the commitment on the public distribution system made in the UPAs national common minimum programme. 

 It had said that within the next three months from May 2004 the government would formulate a comprehensive medium-term strategy for food and nutrition security. The objective will be to move towards universal food security over time, if found feasible, it said.

 The Congresss stand was articulated by Sonia at a meeting of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci) in December 2000. We certainly need to manage the subsidy bill, but not in a manner in which the burden falls on the less privileged, she had said.

 The Congress which won the 2004 election on the slogan Congress ka haath aam admi ke saath wants to iterate that it is sticking to its commitment. Besides, sources said they were a trifle alarmed at the way the Left successfully straddled two political worlds: exercise power without responsibility and authority without accountability.

 At the Congress chief ministers conclave in Nainital in September, Sonia had said she was opposed to a land acquisition policy that allowed prime agricultural land to be put to non-agricultural uses. 

 The government will table the Sachar committee report on the socio-economic conditions of Muslims in Parliament on November 25. Sources said they expect the BJP to disrupt the House tomorrow and on Friday.

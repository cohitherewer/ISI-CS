 Bush comes to Singh rescue

 - US President shrugs off prescriptive clauses as House debates N-law

 K.P. NAYAR 

 Washington, Dec. 19: As debate rages in Parliament over the nuclear deal with America, George W. Bush, the US President, has tactically intervened to shore up Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs position on the issue.

 Several hours after signing a bill approving the deal into law yesterday, Bush separately issued a statement virtually rejecting several prescriptive clauses in the legislation, which have caused anxiety in India.

 Bushs rejection of those clauses will help the UPA government in blunting the attacks from the BJP and Left parties against the new act.

 The expectation here is that it will also help the Prime Minister in allaying fears among Indian scientists that the deal amounts to compromising Indias independence on matters nuclear.

 My approval of the act does not constitute my adoption of the statements of policy (in the legislation) as US foreign policy, the President said in his statement, which is likely to annoy several lawmakers, who worked hard to include compromises in the legislation in order to secure wide support for its passage in the Congress.

 Many of these compromises have been consigned to a sense of Congress Section 102 enabling New Delhi to argue that this section constitutes a non-binding section of the new law.

 Now Bush has made it clear that his administration does not attach any value to it, a decision, which should please many Indians opposed to the law.

 Given the (American) Constitutions commitment to the presidency of the authority to conduct the nations foreign affairs, the executive branch shall construe such policy statements as advisory, Bush said.

 He pointed out that Section 103 of the act purports to establish US policy with respect to various international affairs. 

 This section, among other things, seeks to prevent non-nuclear weapon states from producing nuclear weapons. India is considered as a non-nuclear weapons state here even after the signing of yesterdays law.

 Section 103 also seeks a moratorium at the earliest possible date on the production of fissile material for nuclear explosive purposes by India, Pakistan, and China.

 If Section 104(d)(2) of the act were construed to prohibit the executive branch from transferring or approving the transfer of an item to India contrary to Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) transfer guidelines that may be in effect at the time of such future transfer, a serious question would exist as to whether the provision unconstitutionally delegated legislative power to an international body, Bush argued.

 In order to avoid this constitutional question, the executive branch shall construe section 104(d)(2) as advisory, the President concluded.

 The implication of this conclusion is that the US may transfer nuclear equipment and technology to India even if Washingtons effort to change the NSG guidelines is delayed or unsuccessful.

 As a concession to legislators, however, Bush added: The executive branch will give sections 103 and 104(d)(2) the due weight that comity between the legislative and executive branches should require, to the extent consistent with US foreign policy.

 In what is clearly an effort to ease concern in India over various reporting requirements in the new act, Bush concluded: The executive branch shall construe provisions of the act that mandate, regulate, or prohibit submission of information to the Congress, an international organisation, or the public, such as sections 104, 109, 261, 271, 272, 273, 274, and 275 in a manner consistent with the Presidents constitutional authority to protect and control information that could impair foreign relations, national security, the deliberative processes of the executive, or the performance of the executives constitutional duties.

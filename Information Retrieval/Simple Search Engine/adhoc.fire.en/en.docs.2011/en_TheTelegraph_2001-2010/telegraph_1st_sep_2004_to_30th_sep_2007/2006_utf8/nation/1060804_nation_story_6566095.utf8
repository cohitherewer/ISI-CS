 Hazare in fight for information 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 3: The Centre, which is planning to bring about controversial amendments to the Right to Information Act, 2005, in this session of Parliament, could face its most strident opposition outside the House.

 Anna Hazare, the anti-corruption crusader, today joined hands with Aruna Roy, the architect of the right to information movement in the country, accusing the Centre of misleading the people about the amendments. 

 They have decided to go on an indefinite agitation, starting August 7. Hazare said he would start a hunger strike from August 9 in Mumbai. 

 The Prime Ministers letter to (former Prime Minister) V.P. Singh and Anna Hazare on the need for the amendments contains inaccuracies and is a blatant attempt to mislead (people), Roy said. The PM appears to have been misled by his advisers.

 The tentative bill, a copy of which is with The Telegraph, seeks to exclude file notings except substantial notings on plans, schemes, programmes of the central or state government... relating to development and social issues from the purview of the act. 

 Manmohan Singhs letter had said file notings were not part of the definition of information.

 But Roy said the fact that the definition included material in any form, including advice and opinion, shows that file notings were included in the original bill.

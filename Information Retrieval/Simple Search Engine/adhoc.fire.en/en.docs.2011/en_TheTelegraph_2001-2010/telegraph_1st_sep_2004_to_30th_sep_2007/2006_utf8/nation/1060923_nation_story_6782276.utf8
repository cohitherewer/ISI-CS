 Thiruvananthapuram/ Delhi, Sept. 22: The cola giants won a major victory today with Kerala High Court quashing the state governments ban on the sale and manufacture of Coke and Pepsi.

 The Kerala government said it would appeal the court order that terms the ban unjust and arbitrary.

 The two-judge bench cited a Supreme Court judgment to rule that a state does not have the powers to clamp such a ban under the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act.

 In the Godavat pan masala case, the apex court had ruled that states cannot issue such bans except in emergent situations, and that, too, only temporarily and after hearing out the affected party.

 The high court order came on appeals filed by Hindustan Coca-Cola Beverages Ltd and Pepsi India Holdings Private Ltd against the state government ban of August 10. The ban was based on findings by a Delhi-based NGO, the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), that 11 cola brands contained high levels of pesticide.

 The judges accepted the companies arguments that the government had not independently verified the quality of the products, that it had merely relied on an NGO, and that the CSE findings could not be relied on.

 The companies also argued that the government had denied them natural justice by not seeking an explanation before imposing the ban.

 CSE director Sunita Narain said the verdict was unfortunate and if our report cannot be relied on, it was for the federal government to release its test results so that we have the data with us.

 Its extremely sad. Well definitely file an appeal, chief minister V.S. Achuthanandan said.

 The All India Youth Federation, the CPIs youth wing, has called for a statewide boycott of colas.

 PepsiCo said: This high court order clearly validates our steadfast confidence in the quality and safety of our products. PepsiCo follows one quality standard across the globe.

 Ameer Shahul, Coke public relations manager, said the company would take steps to make Coke available in the local market. But the issue of production, embroiled in a different court case, is more complicated.

 The Coke plant in the northern Palakkad district had suspended production because of stiff conditions imposed by the local Perumatty panchayat. The Pepsi plant is located in an industrial zone and escapes tough norms on drawing underground water.

 In July this year, two NGOs the Hazards Centre and Peoples Science Institute had come out with a report saying Coca-Cola had caused groundwater pollution in the area.

 Mayilamma, a leader of the anti-Coke movement in Palakkad, said if the company resumed production, she would resume her agitation too.

 Mamata threatens river of blood

 Singur, June 18: Mamata Banerjee today dared Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees government to acquire an inch of farmland here for the Tatas small-car unit. 

 Addressing a rally of over 5,000 farmers under the banner of the Krishi Jomi Banchao (Save Farmland) Committee, the Trinamul Congress chief urged them to resist the land acquisition and con- front the police with kitchen tools like the ladle and the rolling pin and lathis. 

 Im accepting the chall- enge thrown by the government. It will not be allowed to take over an inch of agricultural land at Singur without creating a river of blood. Let them deploy a million-strong police force, there will be no retreat. I hope good sense will prevail and the government will not trigger violence at Singur, said Mamata, Trinamuls lone MP in Bengal. 

 The party has 29 MLAs, though, and one of them is from Singur in Hooghly, about 40 km from Calcutta.

 The Tatas want 1,000 acres there and the government is set to acquire it in less than six months.

 The women of Singur, Mamata said, should gear up for the battle. 

 She reminded them of the militant role played by the squatters of Gobindapur, the slum off railway tracks in south Calcutta who resisted eviction for years. 

 At Singur, the government has offered more than the market price as compensation for the land. There is also a 10 per cent bonus for those who give it way voluntarily.

 Mamata told the farmers the promise is a trap laid for them. Dont fall into it. This government will deprive you of your land and livelihood by promising a hefty compensation package, but dont give up your land for money.

 Local CPM leaders had earlier said farmers have already promised to give away over 500 acres on their own.

 Mamata called these villagers misguided, saying they had fallen prey to the CPM tactics. Trinamul supporters should visit them and show them the right path, she added. The party would bring out a procession at Singur next Sunday with the women leading it.

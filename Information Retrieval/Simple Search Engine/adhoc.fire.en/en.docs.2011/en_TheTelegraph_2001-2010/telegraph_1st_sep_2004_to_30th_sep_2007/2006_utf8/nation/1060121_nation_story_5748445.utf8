 Dharam looks for way to wriggle out

 Dharam Singh: In a spot

 Bangalore, Jan. 20: After being taken by surprise by a section of the Janata Dal (Secular) MLAs led by H.D. Kumaraswamy, Karnataka chief minister Dharam Singh is looking for an honourable exit.

 Singh hinted that such a thing could be possible when he told reporters this morning that he was looking at an option to exit before the Congress-Dal (S) ministry faces the floor test in the Assembly on January 27 as directed by the governor.

 But he hastened to add that he hoped for a miracle that would help him tide over the crisis. Emphasising that he cannot take decisions on his own, he said: I will leave the decision to the party high command.

 Sources said party president and UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi was unhappy with Singh for letting former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda ? his good friend ? walk all over him.

 Singh owes his job to Gowda as the former Prime Minister had convinced Sonia in the run up to form the coalition 20 months ago that they could work together.

 Sonia has also been receiving many complaints from senior Congress leaders who were kept out of the government for their alleged closeness to former chief minister S.M. Krishna.

 The coalition bubble burst with Gowdas prot?g? Siddaramaiah cozying up to the Congress, which led to his exit from the Dal (S).

 The last straw was when the zilla parishad polls threw up a hung verdict and Gowda insisted that the Congress should consider his party instead of Siddaramaiahs AIPJD despite finishing last.

 Sonia is believed to have refused to meet Gowda when he was in Delhi a fortnight ago. This triggered the winds of change blowing in Bangalore.

 Late this evening, reports said Dal (S) MLAs were taken to Goa or Kerala so that they would not be convinced or blackmailed emotionally to return to the party fold before January 27.

 Kumaraswamy burst the coalition bubble staking claim to form a government with the BJP and 39 rebel MLAs.

 AICC general secretary Margaret Alva had an hour-long meeting with Singh at his official residence, before the chief minister had a chat with AICCs A.K. Anthony, in charge of the Karnataka Congress. After meeting Gowda, Alva told reporters: Everything now rests on Dal (S) president H.D. Deve Gowda.

 For the first time since the Dal (S) rebels took him by surprise, Singh attacked Kumaraswamy and accused him of destabilising his ministry. The Congress will not talk to him. He has taken many MLAs along. It is nothing but horse-trading.

 He, however, sought to distance the father from the sons antics. I do not share the view that Gowda is with his son.

 The BJP tonight shifted its 70 MLAs to Chennai and lodged them in a hotel. The MLAs arrived shortly after 10 pm by a Kingfisher Airlines special flight.

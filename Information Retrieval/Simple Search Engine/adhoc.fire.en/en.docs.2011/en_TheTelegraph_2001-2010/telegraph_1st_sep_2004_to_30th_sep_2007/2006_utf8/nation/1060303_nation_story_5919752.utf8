 An earful, for no Taj

 New Delhi, March 2: The hard bargaining over the nuclear deal is done, but the US President may have some trickier negotiations at hand to buy peace at home.

 George W. Bush didnt say whether he had ever done a deal with his better half to see the worlds most romantic place if a chance to visit India came along. All he revealed is that ever since Laura Bush learnt that the monument was definitely off the itinerary, he has been hearing no end of it.

 It was an unusually light-hearted Prime Minister Manmohan Singh who broached the subject at the banquet he hosted this afternoon for his American guests. Brimming with good humour at the green light to the nuclear pact, he couldnt resist pulling the US Presidents leg.

 He turned to the US First Lady and sympathised: I am truly sorry that the President is not taking you to see the Taj Mahal this time. I hope he will be more chivalrous the next time you are here.

 But the Texan was not to be outdone. He declared to the gathering that his wife had been talking of nothing else: I have been hearing about the Taj from Laura ever since I told her were not going there.

 That makes it two models of Indian beauty the Bushes would miss: Aishwarya Rais secretary claimed she was invited to the banquet but had to fly off to Brazil.

 The host and the guest looked warm and relaxed in each others company. The Prime Minister broke with protocol to take Bush around, introducing him to industry captains, media bosses and members of the scientific establishment among the 200 and odd guests.

 Ratan Tata was there; so were Sunil Mittal and Tarun Das of the Confederation of Indian Industry. Mukesh Ambanis presence was noticed with as much interest as the absence of his brother Anil.

 In a grand gesture, Singh chose to invite predecessor Atal Bihari Vajpayee. He shared a table with George and Laura Bush, the Prime Minister, his wife Gursharan Kaur and Sonia Gandhi.

 The courtesy was extended even to the BJP leaders aide and former national security adviser, Brajesh Mishra.

 Bush turned on the charm as the Prime Minister took him to each table and made introductions. Rama Reddy suffered a taste of Texan humour when he mentioned he was the publisher of the International Herald Tribune in India.

 Oh, The New York Times (which owns IHT), dont trust anything they write. And you can quote me on that, Bush said.

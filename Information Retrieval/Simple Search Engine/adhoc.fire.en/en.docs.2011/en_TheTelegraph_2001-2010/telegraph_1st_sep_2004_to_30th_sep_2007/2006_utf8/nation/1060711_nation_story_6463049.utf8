 MP action stars add punch to politics

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Role models? Sanjay 

 Gandhi and Biju Patnaik 

 Bhopal, July 10: BJP leaders may hold no brief for the policies of the late Sanjay Gandhi or Biju Patnaik, but they sure seem to admire one aspect of their style. Hands-on governance.

 Since the BJP came to power in Madhya Pradesh in December 2003, there have been over three dozen instances of ruling party politicians beating up government officials, according to state home ministry files.

 BJP spokesman Uma Shankar Gupta took matters in his own hands on Saturday when a public works department official stood up to him. He slapped the officer. 

 As a member of the Babulal Gaur ministry a year ago, Gupta had beaten up a doctor at the state-run Hamidiya hospital. Even the day of his swearing-in didnt pass without Gupta flexing his muscles. Arriving late at the Raj Bhavan gates, he had thrown a police officer to the ground after being stopped.

 According to a complaint lodged with Bhopal police, the BJP leader smacked R.C. Chaturvedi, accusing him of not attending to complaints filed by party corporators.

 When I told him they were being attended to, he started abusing me and said I would lose my job. When I objected to his filthy language, he slapped me, Chaturvedi said.

 Sanjay Gandhi, a man in a hurry during the heady days of the Emergency, had suggested public beating of errant bureaucrats.

 In 1991, then Orissa chief minister Biju Patnaik, too, had called upon the people to thrash any official they found uncooperative.

 In Madhya Pradesh, the exchanges have been one-sided. The action stars include water resources minister Jugal Kishore Bagri, who had grabbed a secondary education board clerk by the scruff. He was upset at some discrepancy in the mark-sheet of someone he knew.

 Jagdish Mohel, too, was a minister when he locked up a group of officials so that loyal party workers could give them a proper hiding. 

 Taking the cue from their leaders, BJP activists have been beating up the police and government officials at will.

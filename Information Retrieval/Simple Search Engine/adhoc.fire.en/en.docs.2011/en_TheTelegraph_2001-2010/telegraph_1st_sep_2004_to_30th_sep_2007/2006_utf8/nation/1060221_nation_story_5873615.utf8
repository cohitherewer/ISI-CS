 Left walks out to wake up govt

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi, Feb. 20: The Left parties are stepping up the heat on the ruling Congress as US President George W. Bushs visit to India next month draws closer. 

 Left members in both Houses today walked out to protest the Congress-led governments lack of response to US ambassador David Mulfords objectionable letter to Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee on Indias economic and foreign policies.

 The MPs demanded that the government ask for Mulfords recall. All options are open before us. Anything can happen, CPM leader Basudeb Acharya said in the Lok Sabha, when asked whether the Left would pull the government down on this issue.

 However, at a recent meeting the CPM politburo had ruled out any attempt to topple the government as it would only help the BJP.

 There has been only one occasion earlier during the tenure of this government when the Left walked out of Parliament. This was when the MPs were protesting against the privatisation of Mumbai and Delhi airports. 

 Today, when the Left members walked out, MPs from the Samajwadi Party, Rashtriya Janata Dal, Bahujan Samaj Party, the Akali Dal and the DMK joined them.

 The BJP did not miss the opportunity to criticise the UPA. The government must clearly spell out its policy, party leader V.K. Malhotra said. But its MPs did not walk out.

 Raising the Mulford issue during zero hour in the Lok Sabha, Acharya said: The US ambassador has sent a letter to Bhattacharjee reacting against his remarks on President Bush at a public rally of the CPM. The government is not taking the issue seriously.

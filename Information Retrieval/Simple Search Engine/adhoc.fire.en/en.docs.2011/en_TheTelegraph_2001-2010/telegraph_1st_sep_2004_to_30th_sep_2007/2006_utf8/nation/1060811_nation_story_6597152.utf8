 Vajpayee letter standoff

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi, Aug. 10: The Lok Sabha deadlock over Atal Bihari Vajpayees aspersions on Speaker Somnath Chatterjee today showed no signs of an early thaw.

 The standoff led to speculation that Parliament could be adjourned sine die, ahead of the scheduled date on August 25, once important financial business was done with.

 The Congress and other UPA constituents, the Samajwadi Party, the Telugu Desam, a former NDA constituent, and t the Janata Dal (Secular), pulled their weight behind the Left and the Speaker.

 At a meeting this evening, they supported a proposal, mooted by ministers Pranab Mukherjee and P.R. Das Munshi that Vajpayee should apologise to Chatterjee for his letter where he expressed lack of confidence in the CPM veterans ability. If he didnt, they would move a resolution condemning Vajpayee for insulting the Speaker.

 The Janata Dal (United) and Biju Janata Dal went along with Vajpayee. There is no question of Vajpayee or anyone apologising, said V.K. Malhotra, the BJPs deputy leader in the Lok Sabha.

 Left sources ruled out chances of Parliament being curtailed. saying: At best, we may protest for another day but we also want legislation and discussions to take place.

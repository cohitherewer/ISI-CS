 3 crore cases pending, 3000 judges short

 New Delhi, April 30 (PTI): The countrys courts are staring at a backlog of nearly 3 crore cases when about 3,000 posts for judges are lying vacant.

 According to the first issue of Court News, a quarterly newsletter published by the apex court, a mind-boggling 2,92,10,015 cases were pending before the Supreme Court, 21 high courts and subordinate courts as on December 31 last year. To add to this, 2,886 positions for judges were vacant as on April 14 this year.

 In Delhi alone, the high court has six positions and subordinate courts 123 positions waiting to be filled. Delhi High Court has 78,379 cases pending and the lower courts have to decide on 7,86,464 cases.

 In Calcutta High Court, 20 of the 50 posts for judges lay vacant while in subordinate courts, 103 of the 706 posts were empty. There are 2,55,993 cases still pending in Calcutta High Court. The pendency in Bengals lower courts is 19,82,095 cases.

 But it is the district and subordinate courts in Uttar Pradesh that have the most number of vacancies ? 756 out of the approved strength of 2,172 seats are unoccupied. It is no surprise then that Uttar Pradeshs subordinate courts also have the highest pendency of civil and criminal cases, precisely 44,58,861 cases to deal with.

 Of the high courts, the one in Patna topped the vacancy list with 22 of the 43 positions lying unfilled. The court had 91,580 cases pending.

 The situation was slightly better in Bombay High Court where only seven posts for judges were vacant against the sanctioned strength of 64. The number of cases pending here was 3,47,953 as on December 31 last year.

 However, in the subordinate courts under Bombay High Court, 230 of the total 1,608 posts of judges were yet to be filled up at the end of last year with a whopping 40,83,891 cases waiting to be dealt with.

 Madras High Court was in a better position with only nine of the 49 judges posts vacant. The number of cases pending was 3,63,551. The situation in the trial courts was also better in Tamil Nadu. Only 29 of the total 757 posts for subordinate judges were vacant and 8,56,048 cases pending.

 Of all high courts, Sikkim High Court is the only one to have all three judges on the bench. It also had the lowest pendency ? 42 cases ? at the end of the last year and 747 cases, again the lowest, pending in trial courts.

 The apex court too is working with two judges short of the sanctioned strength of 26. It had 35,301 cases pending as on March this year.

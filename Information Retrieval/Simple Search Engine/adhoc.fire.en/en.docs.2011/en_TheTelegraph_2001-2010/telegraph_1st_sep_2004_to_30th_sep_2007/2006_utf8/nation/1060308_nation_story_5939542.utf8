 Sonia: Profit punch

 New Delhi, March 7: A day after the Election Commission recommended Jaya Bachchans disqualification, the BJP sought to turn the tables on Sonia Gandhi, saying she holds an office of profit in the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation.

 The BJPs deputy leader in the Lok Sabha, V.K. Malhotra, said his party was consulting legal experts about whether the Congress presidents disqualification can be sought on the same ground as Jayas.

 The Congress president also holds an office of profit. We are considering all options. We will consult legal opinion. After all, Jaya Bachchans disqualification was recommended after it was proved that she holds an office of profit, Malhotra said.

 Besides being the chairperson of the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation and the National Advisory Council, which oversees proper implementation of the Common Minimum Programme, Sonia holds several other posts.

 According to Sushma Swaraj, Malhotras counterpart in the Rajya Sabha, the BJP will pitch for Sonias disqualification only after all rules are properly examined. But we are definitely considering the possibility, she said.

 Mamata slur

 Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee today demanded the disqualification of several CPM MPs for holding offices of profit.

 At least six CPM MPs can be disqualified for holding offices of profit. I shall write to President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam requesting him to disqualify all of them for using government cars and other facilities as cabinet ministers, Mamata said.

 CPM Bengal secretary Anil Biswas said Mamatas allegations were nothing but pre-election gimmicks. 

 Our MPs do not work for personal interest. We send our representatives in Parliament to work for the people, he said.

 If the law is applicable to Jaya for holding an office of profit, why should it not be enforced against the CPM MPs who, too, enjoy offices of profit? she asked.

 The Trinamul chief said Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee is chairman of the Sriniketan-Santiniketan Development Authority and Mohammed Salim is chairman of the Minority Development Corporation. Similarly, CPM MP Hannan Mollah is the chief of the state Wakf Board, while Lakshman Seth is chairman of the Haldia Development Authority.

 While Amitava Nandi holds the post of vice-chairman of the state Fisheries Development Corporation, Swadesh Chakraborty is chairman of the Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners, she added.

 Salim, however, speaking on phone from Delhi, denied the allegations. None of the CPM MPs against whom Mamata plans to write to President seeking their disqualification do not hold offices of profit, he said.

 The CPM MLA from Ballygunge and Left Front chief whip, Rabin Deb, said Mamata should have made her comments after verifying the facts. Mamata tells things without knowing the basic facts. This smacks of bad taste.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Call for monument funds, with caution

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Money matters

 New Delhi, June 18: A parliamentary committee has called for more money from the private sector for the upkeep of historical monuments, but warned this should not lead to the structures being put to commercial use.

 The Committee on Transport, Tourism and Culture welcomed increasing participation of corporate houses in the Archaeological Survey of Indias conservation efforts.

 But at the same time, the committee also cautions that private involvement should not lead to commercial use of monuments, putting their safety and sanctity at stake, said the report presented during the last session of Parliament by the panel headed by CPM leader Sitaram Yechury.

 According to the report, the culture department told the committee that the corporate sector participated in the conservation projects only through the National Culture Fund administered by the ministry.

 While corporate funding was allowed, the conservation work was carried out under the direct supervision of ASI, the department said.

 Though the report didnt mention this, the corporate houses will now have a greater say in how the conservation work is carried out.

 An ASI official recently said that unlike in the past, donor organisations could now recommend non-ASI experts for a conservation job. So far, only in-house ASI experts were considered. However, the final decision will rest with the ASI and, as before, it would be in charge of a project.

 The Centre started seeking corporate money for protection of historical monuments about a decade back with the setting up of the National Culture Fund. This has led to ASI-corporate sector collaborations for the upkeep of monuments like Taj Mahal and Humayuns tomb.

 In 2001, the ASI signed an MoU with the Tata Group on a 15-month project which mainly concerned developing Taj Mahals surroundings and upgrading tourist facilities.

 Similarly, the ASI has worked with the Aga Khan Trust and the Oberoi group of hotels on Humayuns tomb and with the Apeejay group to spruce up Jantar Mantar in Delhi.

 Indian Oil Corporation has also been involved in the maintenance of monuments across the country.

 Typically, the amount contributed to the National Culture Fund for a specific project ranges from a few lakh rupees (Apeejay Group gave Rs 10 lakh for Jantar Mantar) to a couple of crores as with the Humayuns tomb project.

 IIT law school opens doors

 BISWARUP GOOPTU

 July 23: The countrys first intellectual property rights law school opened at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, today, with authorities promising more in the days ahead.

 The Rajiv Gandhi School of Intellectual Property Law will also operate from the IITs Calcutta campus at Salt Lake before moving to the institutes new complex at Rajarhat, scheduled to come up in 2008.

 While the law school will kick off its current session with 55 students in its two programmes, it plans on ramping up the headcount to 800 by 2011, with the Calcutta campus accommodating at least 300 by 2009.

 Once we start introducing new courses, the student headcount will go up sharply, said project leader K. Chakravarti. 

 There is a tremendous demand for lawyers specialising in intellectual property in India and, therefore, we are confident there will be a tremendous response to programmes on these lines, Chakravarti said.

 The law school now offers two programmes: a six-semester, three-year, full-time residential course for a bachelor of law degree with specialisation in intellectual property rights, and a three-semester, one-and-a-half year, part-time non-residential programme for a postgraduate diploma.

 We are currently offering the postgraduate diploma programme at Calcutta only, but will introduce it in our Bhubaneswar campus next year, as we feel that the demand is quite high in that part of the country. Kharagpur, too, will have the diploma programme shortly, Chakravarti said.

 Next in line is an integrated six-year, dual degree B.Tech LL.B programme, for which the human resource development ministry has already given its approval. The law school also plans to introduce LL.M and PhD programmes in the near future.

 The funding for all the initiatives, including creation of physical infrastructure, will come from the Union government, which has promised to match (alumnus) Vinod Guptas pledge of $1 million. They have been extremely enthusiastic about the project and have fast-tracked it to its completion, said S. K. Dube, director, IIT Kharagpur.

 The IIT also signed a technical collaboration agreement (TCA) with George Washington University (GWU) in January to facilitate student and faculty exchange, joint research and curriculum development.

 The TCA with GWU will soon place the Rajiv Gandhi School of Intellectual Property Law among the top law schools of intellectual property in the world. 

 No other institute teaches IPR law as a full-fledged course. We will also teach law related to technology, which is also not taught anywhere in India, said Probir Kumar Gupta, the law schools head.

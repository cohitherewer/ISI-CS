 13 burnt alive in family feud

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Hyderabad, June 10: A brother versus brother property feud ended in 13 people being burnt alive last night as a mob loyal to one torched the ancestral house in which the relatives of two others were cooped up.

 The incident happened in Polkampalli village of Mahboobnagar with supporters of Gade Kistappa turning on the families of Gade Ashok and Gade Hanumayya after fresh negotiations to resolve the dispute fell through.

 Ashok had gone to Kistappas house to thrash out matters ahead of the land case hearing next week. But he came to blows with Kistappas relatives ? Kistappa was killed in February allegedly by his brothers goons ? and was forced to flee to safety.

 When the families of Ashok and Hanumayya got to know what had happened, they trooped to the familys ancestral home and locked themselves in. The 11 who huddled there included four women and four children.

 As expected, a mob of about 100 Kistappa loyalists headed for Ashok and Hanumayyas houses but found the families missing. Furious, they asked the neighbours for their whereabouts before marching to the ancestral house.

 The mob first beat up Basavaraj and Srinivas, guests who had come calling on Hanumayya, before setting them on fire. Finding the doors locked, the mob splashed petrol about the house and set it on fire.

 Once the mob left, all those who had gathered out of curiosity returned to their homes. As the house burned in silence ? no cries or shrieks piercing the darkness ? they assumed the families had fled.

 It was only this morning when police dug out 11 bodies from the rubble that the villagers realised what had happened. The dead included Hanumayya, his wife, son, daughter, daughter-in-law, sister and four grandchildren, two as young as three.

 Most of the women and children died of suffocation. Even the aged, who hid below tables and cots, died after a lot of suffering, police superintendent K. Srinivas Reddy said.

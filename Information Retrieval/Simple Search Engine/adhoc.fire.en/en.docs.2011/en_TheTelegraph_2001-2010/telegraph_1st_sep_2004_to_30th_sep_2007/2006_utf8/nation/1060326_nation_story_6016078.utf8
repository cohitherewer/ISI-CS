 Brake on rebel search

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 R. Udaygiri (Orissa), March 25: Police are apparently going slow with their hunt for the Maoists who raided the R. Udaygiri sub-jail yesterday to protect the lives of the jailer and the police officer the rebels took hostage.

 Around 700 Maoists swooped on the jail yesterday morning, freed some 40 prisoners, destroyed the local police station, killed three personnel, looted ammunition, broke open the treasury and burnt down its stock of stamp papers.

 As the attackers left, they took the jailer, R.N. Sethi, and the officer-in-charge of the police station, Ranjan Mallik, with them.

 While escaping towards the jungles, the Maoists are believed to have passed through Saralapadar village, about 8 km from R. Udaygiri. There they hung a banner warning the police that if they began search operations within the next 24 hours, the hostages would be killed.

 Officially, the police say a massive combing operation is on, aided by five platoons of the state armed police and one of the CRPF. But officers say, with the condition that they will not be named, that the police have taken the Maoists threat of killing the hostages seriously.

 The police also suspect that the fleeing guerrillas planted a large number of landmines in the jungles off Saralapadar. Sources said they have information that the Maoists borrowed some T-shirts for their two hostages at the village.

 The Maoists also left behind a letter at the jail containing a list of demands for the release of the hostages. These include the unconditional release of all Maoists and their supporters from the states jails, transfer of land and water bodies to the tribals and an end to the special greyhound training of policemen to combat Maoists.

 The letter is written in Oriya and signed by Sunil, secretary of the CPI (Maoist) state organising committee.

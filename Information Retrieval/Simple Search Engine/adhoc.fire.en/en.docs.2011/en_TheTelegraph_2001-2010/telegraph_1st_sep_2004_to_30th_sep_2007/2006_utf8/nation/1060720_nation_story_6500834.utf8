 Land for plazas, not jawans homes

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Not welcome in Punjab?

 Chandigarh, July 19: Land for malls, not for the military.

 The Punjab government, which has been doling out prime land at low rates for shopping plazas, multiplexes and retail outlets, has turned a deaf ear to the armys request for land to build houses for its personnel.

 Army Welfare Housing Organisation officials lamented that repeated reminders to chief minister Amarinder Singh ? himself a former soldier ? have failed to evoke any response.

 Punjab has about 2.5 lakh ex-servicemen and over 50,000 widows of army personnel.

 In a letter to Amarinder last month, the armys director-general of discipline, ceremonials and welfare, Lt Gen. M.G. Girish, pointed out that no progress had been made on providing housing to soldiers despite several reminders in the last four years.

 It added that the Punjab Urban Development Authority had intimated army headquarters after Amarinder took over as chief minister that no plot can be allotted to the housing organisation because of scarcity of land.

 There is no dearth of government land for industrialists who have embarked upon the state to build colonies where each flat is being sold for nearly a crore of rupees, but for us ? the jawans ? who have been braving bullets at the countrys frontiers, even a small plot on the outskirts of some cities suddenly becomes unavailable, said an official of the housing organisation.

 The organisation had sought land in Mohali, Amritsar, Ludhiana and Jalandhar to build low-cost flats not exceeding Rs 6 lakh each. The project comes under the Jai Jawan Awas Yojna, a housing scheme for soldiers.

 Last month, the state gave the nod to Reliance Industries to set up agriculture hubs, for which government land would be allotted on realisation of full costs. Land owned by panchayats and the government would be allotted at an annual lease of Rs 16,000 per acre with an escalation of 10 per cent after every five years.

 Earlier, the government had decided to hand over panchayat land at the prices prevailing 30 years ago, sparking protests by the Akali Dal and farmers bodies. A plot in Mohali costing over Rs 1,000 crore was to be handed over for less than Rs 10 crore to Reliance, which led to charges of selling out the state to the company.

 Delhi-based real estate giants like DLF have been provided land for commercial and residential highrises. Also, government organisations like the Punjab Mandi Board, which has acres of prime land at its disposal, has built retail outlets and handed over plots to private developers.

 Life-support denial

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 16: A patient died in a hospital here last night after being refused the ventilator that doctors insisted could only be used for VIPs injured in terrorist attacks.

 Rizwana Hussein implored doctors at the Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Hospital to spare one of the two automatic ventilators for her husband, Nawaz, but her request was turned down. The heart patient in his mid-forties died later.

 We were told the two ventilators were not available for common people, said Rizwana. When she begged the doctors to be cons-iderate, they retorted: What will happen if terrorists attack VIPs and they need the ventilators?

 Her husband was given a manual respirator, which she and her kids, Rizwan, 7, and Wasim, 5, took turns to hold on in a desperate effort to keep him alive. 

 However, the manual device is less effective than automatic ventilation, which responds to a patients actual condition and does not have to be adjusted frequently.

 If a person is critical, as Nawaz appears to have been, a manual ventilator should only be used if an automatic one is not available, said Ramesh Lakhani, a cardio-thoracic specialist.

 The hospital refuted the charge that the patient was denied a ventilator despite the fact that two were available. 

 It is a very sad event, as every death is, the hospital said in a release. There was simply no ventilator available at that point, said Ram Bakshi of Lok Nayaks emergency ward, which Rizwana had approached.

 A cardiologist not on duty in the hospitals emergency services last night confirmed that the doctors were under instructions to keep two ventilators for VIP emergencies. The orders had been renewed before Independence Day. 

 But when a man is dying, a doctors job is to try and save him. No other consideration should be valid under the Hippocratic oath that every doctor takes, he said.

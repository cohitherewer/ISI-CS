 Remand home ruckus

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Jan. 3: The Dongri Childrens Remand Home will not forget this New Years eve in a hurry. 

 On Saturday night when the rest of the city was partying, inmates of this central Mumbai home went on a rampage when their demand for liquor was apparently not met. In the melee, around 35 inmates escaped. 

 Police say they have arrested 16 inmates and at least five are adults. Many inmates are adults. It is they who create trouble and spoil the children, a senior police officer said. 

 The authorities said the boys went berserk on the night of December 31 after their demand for liquor was not met. We organised special New Year meals for them. They got chicken curry and rice for dinner, vegetables and pulao in the afternoon. But they were not satisfied. The boys here have all kinds of vices like drinking and smoking. When we dont allow them, they start all this, said Shobha, a staffer. 

 Other sources said the trouble began after some staff members took money from the boys and sneaked in alcohol. Many of them were high. They were hysterical and screaming abuses. They then jumped over the fencing wall and fled, said a security guard.

 However, several inmates, while hurriedly commenting on the incident (they are officially under lock and key), said this was untrue. Some of the boys got angry after they did not get liquor even after paying the staff?. They got very angry and went pulling the whole place down. Some children used the opportunity to escape, said a 12-year-old. 

 The remand home is not high on security. There are just six guards for the 300-plus inmates.

 The number of inmates has increased after the Juvenile Justice Act was modified to include children up to the age of 18, but there are about 60 employees to run the place.

 The violence has left the staff rattled. They said some boys cut themselves with blades. We have next to no security here. I have written many times for more security but none has been provided. And look what has happened now, said Shyam Gorad, the in-charge of the remand home.

 Srinagar, May 24: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today appealed to Kashmiri militants across the Line of Control to come home and told the troops there should be zero tolerance of custody deaths.

 In the light of the changing environment, we are reviewing the cases of all detainees, Singh said in his opening address at a round-table conference in Srinagar attended by 30 mainstream leaders but boycotted by the separatist Hurriyat and the BJP.

 Included in this is a review of those (who) crossed over (to Pakistan-occupied Kashmir) after violating our laws and who are now anxious to come home.

 He spoke in Urdu, reading from a prepared text.

 Earlier, addressing a meeting of the Unified Command, the Prime Minister told them to follow the law.

 It is possible and desirable that you should be firm but humane; effective and efficient; in control but unobtrusive, he was quoted as telling military, police and civilian commanders.

 You must be steadfast in your commitment to human rights and there should be zero tolerance for custodial deaths.

 Singh stressed that internal security receives our continuing attention and I would like to mention that security forces are here to protect the people and their stay here is based on this.

 The motto should be maximum security with minimum disruption of normal life, he added.

 But Srinagar, which is in the middle of its best tourist season in years, turned into a ghost town today with only gun-toting securitymen out on the streets. Even by Kashmir standards, where troops keep vigil day in and day out and bunkers dot the streets, security was exceptionally tight.

 All roads into the city were sealed off, and barricades and razor-fitted wires erected in lanes leading off the main roads. The boulevard along Dal Lake popular with tourists was off bounds because the Sher-i-Kashmir International Conference Centre where the round-table was held is located here. Tourists living in houseboats and hotels on the boulevard were told to stay indoors.

 To complete the curfew-like picture, a shutdown call by separatists against the round-table ensured that offices, schools and markets were closed and transport was off the roads. Children did not play cricket on the streets.

 I had come here for three days with my family. Because of the extraordinary security and the general strike, my precious holiday has been spoiled, said Manoj Kumar.

 High-speed motor boats keeping vigil on the conference venue were the only sign of movement on Dal Lake, with shikaras out of business.

 In spite of the tight security, militants launched six grenade attacks, injuring 38 people, 14 of them jawans. Yesterday, a suicide bomber had injured 26 BSF jawans and on Sunday, five people were killed when militants opened fire on a Congress rally.

 At the conference, Singh said he hoped the Hurriyat would join the talks later. The dialogue with All-Parties Hurriyat Conference was positive. I hope at the appropriate time they will also join the series of round-table conferences so that they can share their views with all of us. The Hurriyat had stayed away from the conference calling it a crowd and had offered to meet the Prime Minister separately, which he declined.

 There are two dimensions to the problems of Jammu and Kashmir. One is the relationship between Delhi and Srinagar and the other is the relationship between Delhi and Islamabad. These two dimensions are of course different but each affects the other, Singh said.

 Left wary of Iran clause

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 8: The Left parties fear that the final deal approved by the US Congress might not correspond to the July 18 agreement signed by the two countries.

 The CPM leadership did not issue a formal statement today, saying it would have to read the full text before coming out with a response. 

 But Lok Sabha MP Mohammad Salim said: We are concerned about the terms in the deal about Iran. 

 The final deal expects the US administration to give an annual report on Indias stance on Irans nuclear project, spelling out whether Delhi is moving in tandem with Washington.

 This was one of the issues raised by the Left when it was negotiating with the government on the deal. 

 This is a deal between two countries and there should be no reference to a third country, said Salim, who is also a central committee member. We cannot accept the dictates of another country about how we should behave towards Iran. 

 Salim stayed away from a meeting hosted by Nicholas Burns for Indian MPs to update them on the deal, saying he does not believe in going to the US embassy and being briefed by their government representatives.

 The issue for the CPM is whether or not the nine points of concern raised by the party have been addressed in the final deal. The leadership is clear that any deviation from the guarantee given by the Prime Minister in Parliament will be taken up in the ongoing session.

 The Prime Minister, under continued pressure from the Left, had made a statement in Parliament promising that the government would not stray from the July Indo-US agreement. Manmohan Singh had also taken note of the Lefts nine points of concern and addressed them one by one. 

 At the end of his statement, the Left leaders had expressed satisfaction that the government has redressed all their concerns.

 Senior CPM leaders, however, believe that the Indo-US deal is likely to have covert clauses that will reveal themselves bit by bit. The party also apprehends that the UPA governments foreign policy is being dictated by the US administration.

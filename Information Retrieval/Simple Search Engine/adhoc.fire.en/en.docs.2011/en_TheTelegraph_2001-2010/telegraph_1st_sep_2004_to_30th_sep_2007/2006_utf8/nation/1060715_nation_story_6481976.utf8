 Praveen charges

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, July 14: In a hurry to meet the 90-day deadline, Mumbai police today filed a 650-page chargesheet against Praveen Mahajan, accused of killing his brother and BJP general secretary Pramod Mahajan.

 Worli police filed the chargesheet before the Bhoiwada metropolitan court under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code for murder and Section 449 for criminal trespass with the intention of committing a serious crime.

 Police sources said the chargesheet contains statements of 58 key witnesses, including Pramods widow Rekha, brother-in-law Gopinath Munde and daughter Poonam.

 Praveen was arrested on April 22 after he surrendered before the police minutes after he fired three rounds from close range at his elder brother at the BJP leaders Worli house. A profusely bleeding Pramod was rushed to the Hinduja hospital where he battled for life for 12 days before succumbing to his injuries on May 3.

 Following Pramods death, the initial charge under Section 307 for attempt to murder was converted into murder. Praveen was not present in the court when a police team filed the chargesheet. He is likely to be given a copy of the chargesheet when he is produced before the court for further remand on Monday.

 Torture whiff in boy death

 SHASHANK SHEKHAR

 Bokaro, Jan. 1: Manraj Tirkey had no idea what lay in store for him when he stepped out of home on December 22. 

 The 17-year-old, a resident of Gumla Colony and a school dropout, was planning big for Christmas with his friends when some policemen saw them wandering around 4.30 pm. 

 They swooped on the boys and arrested them on charges of stealing ornaments from a local shop the day before.

 This morning, Manraj succumbed to injuries, allegedly caused by police torture, in a city hospital. His body was later handed over to his family.

 Manraj was bleeding from his mouth and nostrils when his parents went to see him on December 28. His father, A. Tirkey, is a daily wage labourer who could not fund his sons studies after Class IX. He has two sisters.

 Police officers stuck to the allegation that the teenagers had stolen the ornaments, claiming Manraj was suffering from an incurable disease. But they could not explain why no formal complaint had been lodged.

 They also could not explain why the boys had been kept in police custody for so many days.

 The boys are between 10 and 19 and stay in the Sector XII area. Besides Manraj, the group included Dilip Ram (19), Harendra Kumar (13), Manoj Kumar (10), Isatannis Keiro (17) and Prakash Baraich (15). 

 Harendra was kept in custody till December 27 while Dilip, Manoj and Isatannis were allowed to leave the previous day. Prakash is still in custody. 

 Sources said there was a theft in a jewellery shop on December 21 and the police picked up the boys, who had contributed Rs 50 each for Christmas celebrations, the following day. 

 Sources close to the police alleged the boys were tortured in custody.

 Manraj bore the brunt of the abuse and had to be admitted to hospital.

 Bokaro deputy superintendent Sandhya Rani claimed the boys had been released on December 24 but were again picked up after the police found some stolen ornaments in their possession.

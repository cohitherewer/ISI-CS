 CPM sounds Kerala alarm

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi, Oct. 24: The CPM, in one its rare bouts of candour, has conceded the partys inability to control factional strife in Kerala, a state where it romped home in elections this year.

 A report on the implementation of the decisions taken at the 18th party congress makes no bones about the fact that the state committee is split down the middle.

 The party leadership (in Kerala) should collectively and individually make a serious introspection about all deviations political, ideological and organisational. They should fall in line with party positions, says the report.

 At the two ends of the tug-of-war are camps led by chief minister V.S. Achuthanandan and state committee secretary Pinarayi Vijayan. The duel turned particularly ugly on poll-eve, though the central leaderships intervention ensured a united face was presented.

 But the bleak reminders have hardly faded away. The unity of the party in Kerala can be strengthened only when the whole leadership takes correct organisational methods to resolve policy differences. All violations should be taken seriously, the report warns.

 The VS group accuses Vijayan of backing economic reforms probably of the type the party loathes and indulging in corruption. The CPM papers over the rifts, preferring to use words like organisational and policy differences. 

 It is quite natural that the leaders may have different attitudes and approaches on such matters (policy and organisational), the report says, urging various groups to seriously consider the issues raised in such debates and to ensure an understanding is reached. 

 If there are differences on issues which require immediate solution, they should try to settle these with the help of the party centre, the report goes on to say.

 Conflicting opinions are not the only worry. There is media management, too. And, the dossier is not lacking in advice. The press in Kerala is always projecting the party as a divided house. The leadership should be very careful in giving replies to the queries of press people, it says.

 The factional feud, the authors of the report warn, has started telling on membership. 

 Dropping of party members and candidate-members (the second stage before a person becomes a full party member) is very high in Kerala. In 2006, 10.19 per cent of party members and 23.19 per cent of candidate-members did not renew membership. 

 The contrast with Bengal where dropout figures are only 2.31 per cent for full members and 9.7 per cent for candidate-members only deepens the pangs.

 The 18th party congress had called for a rectification campaign to bring its party cadre on the right ideological track.

 Moral support and money trickle in 

Medicos reject PM call, plan mass rally

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT AND PTI

 New Delhi, May 25: The anti-quota campaign gained fresh momentum today with doctors from private and government hospitals deciding to extend their support to it, amid loud thinking about civil disobedience and medical bandhs.

 Defiant medical students rejected a new appeal from Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to call off the agitation and spent the day campaigning for a mass rally to be held on Saturday.

 Health services remained paralysed across Punjab and Haryana today as doctors from both state-run and private hospitals stopped out-patient services in response to a call from the local branch of the Indian Medical Association.

 While senior doctors from the government-run Safdarjung Hospital in the capital resolved to discontinue out-patient services from Saturday, private doctors dropped cheques and doled out cash to support the campaign.

 Were going to support this until the students get what theyre asking for, said Anurag Saxena, the secretary of a local branch of the Indian Medical Association, moments after he dropped a cheque of Rs 11,000 into a donation box next to the lawn at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, the hub of the agitation. The afternoon collections alone touched over Rs 70,000, students said. 

 This agitation is not fizzling out. This is just the beginning, said Sanjeev Chibber, a cancer surgeon from a private hospital. The year 2006 is going to be remembered for this peaceful anti-reservation civil disobedience movement.

 The students had appealed to professionals and traders to stop working for three hours this morning but the call did not seem to have had a big impact because many were not aware of it.

 The striking medical students tried to address the problem today by speaking with resident welfare associations and traders organisations and seeking their support for the agitation.

 In Punjab, private nursing homes, clinics, hospitals and chemist shops remained closed to express solidarity with protesting medicos, the Punjab president of the Indian Medical Association told PTI.

 In solidarity with the striking students, were discontinuing OPD (out-patient department) from Saturday until this issue gets resolved, said Shabnam Bhandari, professor of radiodiagnosis, and vice-president of the medical officers association of Safdarjung Hospital.

 Members of Youth For Equality spearheading the agitation have said they want an independent commission to assess the impact of caste-based reservations in the past and make its findings public before any new quota system is introduced.

 A doctor said that while the government could afford to ignore striking medical students, a well-coordinated but short mass strike by doctors would force it to negotiate.

 At this point, theres only a slim possibility for such a mass medical bandh but its not impossible, said the doctor.

 The Delhi Bar Association today pledged support to the medical students. We dont want to do anything in a haste, but we are now exploring legal options (to challenge the government decision), said Pramod Sharma, a Bar member.

 Child work ban gathers dust

 MONOBINA GUPTA

 No relief yet

 New Delhi, Aug. 20: The Centre has banned employing children in households and eateries from October 10, but is doing little to make sure the curb is enforced.

 Bachpan Bachao Andolan, an NGO working for child labourers, says the government has not even responded to its suggestions for making the ban effective, and not a joke.

 We wrote to Union labour minister C. Chandrasekhar Rao immediately after the ban was announced and urged him to put in place a mechanism for the ban to be implemented, says Kailash Satyarthi, the head of the NGO.

 On August 1, the labour ministry issued a notification adding two areas jobs in households and eateries to the list of hazardous occupations for children. The Child Labour (Regulation and Prohibition) Act, 1986, prohibits hiring of children under 14 in such jobs.

 In my letter to the labour minister, I pointed out that the ban will be counter-productive if it is not properly implemented. Till now, people have flouted the child labour act inside factories. Now the violations will be more rampant in households and eateries, says Satyarthi.

 Upset with the Centres indifference, the Andolan is seeking the Supreme Courts intervention. A 1996 case related to child labour is coming up for a hearing on August 30. We have petitioned the court to set up a national commission or a national authority to monitor the ban, says Satyarthi. 

 A retired Supreme Court judge should head the authority which, he says, can have two members from civil society, besides representatives from the Union education, social justice, home and labour ministries.

 Social organisations say the governments record on eradicating child labour does not inspire confidence. Like the earlier decrees, the new restrictions on children working in households and eateries will not be effective if implementation remains poor. 

 Over the past two decades, not one offender has been put behind bars under the child labour act though there are 70-90 million child workers in the country, NGOs say. 

 The Centre could not even provide accurate statistics to the Supreme Court in the past decade. It first furnished a figure of 36,000 child labourers in hazardous occupations. When the court refused to accept this as authentic, it reeled off a new figure of 4.7 lakh. 

 The court had asked the government to set up a rehabilitation fund. It had directed offenders to give Rs 20,000 and the government Rs 5,000 for every child worker rescued, says Satyarthi. 

 Employers were told to ensure the child had at least three hours a day for studies. Satyarthi claims none of these measures was implemented.

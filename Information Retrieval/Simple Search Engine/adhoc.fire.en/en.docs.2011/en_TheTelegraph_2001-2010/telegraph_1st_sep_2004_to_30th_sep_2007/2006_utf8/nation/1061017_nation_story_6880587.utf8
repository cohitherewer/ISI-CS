 Crown on head, plea for Panchen

 McLeodganj, Oct. 16 (Reuters): Braving a controversial swimwear round and questions about Tibets freedom struggle, a sociology student born in India has won the annual Miss Tibet beauty pageant held by Tibetans in exile.

 Organiser Lobsang Wangyal said the pageant is not a political event but a celebration of beautiful, elegant, brave and modern Tibetan girls.

 But in truth this pageant with a difference is a mix of glitzy entertainment, hype and the slightly incongruous promotion of the Tibetan refugees cause independence from China.

 I have a huge responsibility, being Miss Tibet is not easy, said 21-year-old winner Tsering Chungtak, as fireworks lit up the night sky yesterday over McLeodganj, home to the Dalai Lama and thousands of Tibetan refugees. I have to represent my country on the international stage.

 And Chungtak wasted no time, appealing for the release of Gedhun Choekyi Nyina, believed to have been held under house arrest by the Chinese since 1985, when he was a six-year-old boy, three days after the Dalai Lama recognised him as the incarnation of Tibets second highest religious leader, the Panchen Lama.

 We all know the Panchen Lama is the worlds youngest political prisoner, she said, dressed in the traditional Tibetan costume for the final round of the event. I am going to raise my voice and I want people to support me.

 The Miss Tibet contest, now in its fifth year, has never been short of controversy. Unsurprisingly it annoys the Chinese, and a previous winner had to pull out of beauty pageants in Zimbabwe and Malaysia last year after Chinese objections.

 Just five girls took part in this years event a sixth pulled out after objections from the high-altitude Tibetan unit of the Indian Army where she serves.

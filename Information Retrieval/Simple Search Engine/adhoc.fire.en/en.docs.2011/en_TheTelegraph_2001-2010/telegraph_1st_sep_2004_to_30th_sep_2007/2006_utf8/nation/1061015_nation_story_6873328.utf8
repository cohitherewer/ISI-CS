 Dhaka, Oct. 14: As Bangladesh basked in Nobel glory, Muhammad Yunus today saluted the 1971 war martyrs who died to give birth to his nation but he left open-ended a query on whether he would head its government.

 Beginning his day by placing a wreath at the National Martyrs Memorial in Savar, Yunus hoped that the peace prize that had united his nation in joy yesterday would also serve to unite its bickering political parties.

 Drawing strength from the martyrs (who) are the source of all our inspirations, Bangladeshs banker to the poor said: We want the same kind of unity in politics like the unity that has been created by the Nobel Prize.

 I believe a wind of peace is now sweeping the country. The people are united. The politicians should seize this opportunity to make peace and avoid confrontation.

 A smile playing on his lips, the 66-year-old economist who had pioneered micro-credit in 1976 offered to broker peace between the two alliances that are squabbling over electoral reforms.

 If needed and if they (politicians) want, I will try to help the process. I think they will be able to come out with a positive result, he said.

 But he waved away as hypothetical questions on whether he would agree to head a caretaker government to oversee elections scheduled for early 2007.

 The politicians have to ensure smooth elections unitedly, he said at a crowded news conference at the Grameen Banks office in Dhakas suburbs.

 Todays newspapers were dominated by pictures and stories of the achievements of Yunus and Bangladesh, which, after years of political unrest, found a moment of joy and national unity.

 Leaders of the two main alliances are to sit on Monday for their fifth round of parleys on electoral reforms amid Opposition threats to boycott the January elections if the talks fail.

 The bickering parties were united in praising Yunus. Prime Minister Khaleda Zia and Opposition leader Sheikh Hasina Wajed hoped his achievement would boost Dhakas international image.

 But it is unclear how the two leaders will respond to his appeal for peace.

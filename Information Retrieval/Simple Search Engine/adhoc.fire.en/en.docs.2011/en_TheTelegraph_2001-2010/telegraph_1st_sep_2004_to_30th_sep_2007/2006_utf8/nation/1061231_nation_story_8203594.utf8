The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Not less

 equal

 If the big picture brought hope, the small print 

 wasn rsquo;t too bad either

 Flying tackle

 Women tested 

 another male bastion this year with nearly half the girls in the air force doing consistently better than the men in training. This has had training school commandants, 

 instructors and IAF doctors saying the policy of barring the gender from flying combat aircraft is grossly unfair. ldquo;If you are asking if the women are capable (of becoming fighter pilots), the answer is yes, rdquo; the chief of the Bangalore-headquartered training command, Air Marshal B.N. Gokhale, said.

 A push for policy change has come from the Institute of Aerospace Medicine in 

 Bangalore, where researchers are ready to test select women pilots to see if they are 

 capable of flying fighter jets.

 Your own woman 

 To enable ldquo;more and more women to take that first step towards financial independence rdquo;, ING Investment, investment manager for ING Vysya Mutual Fund, has launched the Mahilanivesh scheme 

 exclusively for Indian women. Under the package, any 

 investment (selected from a pre-denominated instruction amount) will be parked in ING Vysya floating rate fund (an open-ended income scheme) and the money will be automatically transferred in monthly instalments to ING Vysya dividend yield fund (an open-ended equity scheme).

 Less is better

 The National Family Health Survey (NFHS-3) has found that the fertility rate has touched or fallen below the replacement rate mdash; signifying fewer births than deaths mdash; in six states. Kerala, Andhra Pradesh and 

 Himachal Pradesh have done especially well. Fertility rates have fallen in many other states, with four out of five women in several parts of northern India saying they do not want more than two 

 children. All of it suggests better education among rural women and a bigger say in family matters.

 Whenever, wherever 

 Travelling has never been so good for women. Top Indian hotels are offering special packages, including extra security. The Oberoi Group and ITC have a floor dedicated to female guests, with women butlers for room service. The hotels screen calls to make their lady guests feel safe.

 Tour operators are providing female escorts or guides for women travelling alone at 

 unfamiliar places and offering cheaper fares, with a shopping spree thrown into the itinerary. With a survey 

 showing women make up 56 million of the 139 million 

 travellers in the Asia-Pacific region, including India mdash; and by 2011 may overtake men mdash; the industry is just showing a keen business sense.

 A weight off

 Women left depressed by the unrealistic standards set by real-life Barbies had reason for cheer this year. The tide turned against super-skinny models with Italy and Spain banning them because of the health risks posed by the desperate diet regimes they follow. Brazil, too, has launched a campaign to ban underweight women from the catwalk, while Hollywood actress Kate Winslet has been shouting from the rooftops in favour of the ample, filled-out frame.

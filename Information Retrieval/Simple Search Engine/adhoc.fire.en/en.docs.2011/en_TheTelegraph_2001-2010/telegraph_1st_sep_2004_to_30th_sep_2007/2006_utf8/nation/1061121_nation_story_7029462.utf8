 Bachchan the fourth, parents play baraati 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Abhishek in Lucknow

 Lucknow, Nov. 20: Amitabh 

 Bachchan said he had come as a baraati, and son Abhishek 

 would have been any grooms envy as he strode up the 

 dais in a buttoned-up black bandhgala, hair held 

 in place by a jet-black band.

 Big B was only joking, but the Yash Bharti award function seemed as much a family affair as Bachchan Juniors wedding would have been.

 Abhishek today became the fourth Bachchan to receive Uttar Pradeshs highest honour, emulating his poet grandfather, the late Harivansh Rai, and parents Amitabh and Jaya.

 The state governments choice of such a young actor for what is seen as a recognition of lifetime achievement had stoked controversy, especially as the family is close to the ruling Samajwadi Party.

 Abhishek, though, quickly set about disarming his critics by declaring he did not deserve the honour and was giving away the Rs 5-lakh prize in charity.

 I consider myself fortunate. I know I dont deserve this, the actor said, coy as a groom, to a roar of appreciation at the Ram Manohar Lohia Park, packed with young fans from schools and colleges.

 Amitabh, who wore a grey bandhgala, came up to hug his son while Jaya, dressed in a red sari, clapped away.

 Amitabh sent the audience wild by saying he and his wife had come as baraatis (grooms companions) and added with a twinkle: This isnt the baraati you think it is. I only wish my son takes this award as an inspiration, works hard and brightens the image of his state of origin.

 Abhishek said: I will work hard to live up to the legacy of my grandfather and father. But I have decided to gift the money for the cause of any social work in Uttar Pradesh.

 Samajwadi general secretary Amar Singh then announced that the Bachchans had donated the money to the Uttar Pradesh Hindi Sansthan for the promotion of Hindi.

 Chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav declared he was trying to encourage young achievers and that talent has nothing to do with age. I dont care who is happy or unhappy. I do what I think fit.

 Among the other recipients was cricketer Mohammad Kaif, who is away in South Africa. His father Mohammad Tarif received the award on his behalf.

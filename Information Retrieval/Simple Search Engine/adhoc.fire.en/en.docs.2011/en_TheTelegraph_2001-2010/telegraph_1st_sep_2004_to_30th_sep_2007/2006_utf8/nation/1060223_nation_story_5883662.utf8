 Private quota in oxygen tent

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 New Delhi, Feb. 22: The UPA governments promise to facilitate affirmative action in the private sector may be given a quiet burial.

 The group of ministers (GoM) formed to examine the issue feels that it is unrealistic to expect the private sector to opt for quotas on its own. That leaves the government with only one option: pass a law making it incumbent on private companies to earmark a quota for Dalits and tribals.

 Sources in the group of ministers said legal opinion suggested that the option would require a constitutional amendment, which was not tenable.

 After a meeting on February 20, the eight-member GoM, headed by Sharad Pawar, decided to refer the issue back to the Union cabinet without making any recommendation.

 The terms of reference do not allow us to do any more. We have not been able to elicit anything more than assurances from the industry. We do not have the mandate to do more, said a member.

 Shortly after the GoM was set up on August 30, 2004, the Tatas and Videocon had written to social justice and empowerment minister Meira Kumar that they would back the governments initiative. But there was no response from the rest.

 Asked if the cabinet mandated the GoM to study the feasibility and scope of a legislation, a source said: We will, if we are required to. But this seems highly unlikely because it is controversial and we dont want to antagonise industry. Besides, who will enforce such a law?

 Even GoM members like Lalu Prasad and Ram Vilas Paswan, who built their political careers on the reservation plank, were reportedly lukewarm to the idea in recent meetings and stayed away from the last one.

 None of the rest, including P. Chidambaram, Kamal Nath, Meira Kumar, Dayanidhi Maran and Kapil Sibal, has waved the reservation flag, at least not in the recent past.

 Congress sources said even the Left was not as worked up over this issue as it was on the privatisation of public sector units, infrastructure modernisation and FDI in insurance. If at all there was a party which may cash in on the governments inadequacy, the sources said, it was the Bahujan Samaj Party.

 The Congresss economic resolution at the Hyderabad plenary in January indicated the shape of things to come. The resolution asked the government to evolve legislative and administrative support for reservation but did not elaborate.

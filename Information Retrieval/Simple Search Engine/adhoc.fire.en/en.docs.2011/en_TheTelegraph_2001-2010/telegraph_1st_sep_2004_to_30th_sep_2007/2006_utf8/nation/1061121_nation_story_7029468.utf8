 Rap for creamy layer stance

 New delhi: The concept of creamy layer was not devised to exclude anybody from the ambit of reservation but to promote those who deserved it the most, the Supreme Court said on Monday.

 Commenting on the governments resistance to the exclusion of the creamy layer from reservation, a bench headed by Chief Justice Y.K. Sabharwal said if it was not left out, backwards who are financially worse would be adversely affected.

 Some people have to be put in the creamy layer to give benefit to others in the group, the court said while taking note of a PIL by BJP MP Haribhau Rathod. 

 The petition sought exemption of OBCs engaged in hereditary professions from the purview of the creamy layer rule devised by the apex court. Rathods petition will be heard on Friday with another similar one.

 Music leads Zoheb to India

 London (PTI): Zoheb Hassan, 

 brother of late Pakistani pop singer Nazia Hassan, will 

 visit India to revive his connections with the music world, 

 his mother Muniza Basir has said.

 Zoheb, who had given up music for some time, is back with his latest album Kismet, which has become a hit within two weeks of its release in Pakistan, selling over 50,000 CDs, Muniza said in a statement.

 I am glad that he has gone back to music as music is his first love. Losing a sister like Nazia and giving up music was catastrophic for Zoheb, she said.

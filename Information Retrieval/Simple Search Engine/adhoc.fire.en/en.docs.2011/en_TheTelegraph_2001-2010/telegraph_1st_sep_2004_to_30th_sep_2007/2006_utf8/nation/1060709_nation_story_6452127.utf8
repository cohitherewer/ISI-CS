 For BJP, Singh is unfit to be PM

 Singh: Barrage of blows

 New Delhi, July 7: In an unprecedented attack on Manmohan Singh, the BJP today declared him unfit to be Prime Minister and alleged that he had lost the backing of his own party.

 This is the first time the BJP has gone so far as to question Singhs ability to lead the country ? till now, the party had confined its attack to calling him the weakest PM ever. But today, it was an all-round assault on Singhs complete irrelevance even in the routine functioning of the UPA government.

 Leading the charge was BJP general secretary Arun Jaitley, who said it was time the Prime Minister did some serious introspection. 

 I think the time has come for him to ask himself why he is still the PM. Is he caving in at the slightest provocation because even the Congress has stopped backing him? he asked.

 The former law minister reeled off a series of instances when the Prime Minister has caved in.

 While HRD minister Arjun Singh set his own agenda for reservation, health minister Anbumani Ramadoss had his way in AIIMS. On Iran, too, Natwar Singh did as he pleased, he claimed. The list is endless. Besides, there is always the Left to mount additional pressure on the PM. In such circumstances, it is natural to assume that even the Congress has stopped backing him.

 Citing the Prime Ministers decision to put on hold all disinvestment plans, Jaitley alleged that the government was struck by a complete policy paralysis. 

 There is a national drift towards a total policy paralysis in the government. The drift is so large that it has put a question mark on the PMs ability to lead the country. He is willing to kneel and bow to any and every pressure group within and outside the UPA, Jaitley said.

 The DMK wanted the 10 per cent disinvestment in Neyveli Lignite Corporation to be stopped. The PM decided to halt the entire process of disinvestment. The government policy on sensitive strategic matters like Nepal is being outsourced to the CPM. The UPAs policy against terrorism has been sacrificed at the altar of vote-bank politics. Huge hurdles are being posed to economic reforms. The Indo-US nuclear deal makes a mockery of Indias independent foreign policy. What does all this indicate?

 When the UPA assumed power, Jaitley said, there were unconstitutional centres of power. But the PM was one of the centres of power at the time.... Now, he has stopped being even that.

 AIIMS poser

 The BJP today asked the Prime Minister to explain his role in the ouster of P. Venugopal from AIIMS.

 In a letter to Singh, senior party leaders A.B. Vajpayee, L.K. Advani, Jaswant Singh, Murli Manohar Joshi and V. K. Malhotra demanded that Venugopal be reinstated as director of the institute with immediate effect.

 Terming the AIIMS governing body proposal to sack the famous cardiac surgeon as an insult to the countrys professional community, the BJP leaders said the PMs authority was used to enforce this decision.

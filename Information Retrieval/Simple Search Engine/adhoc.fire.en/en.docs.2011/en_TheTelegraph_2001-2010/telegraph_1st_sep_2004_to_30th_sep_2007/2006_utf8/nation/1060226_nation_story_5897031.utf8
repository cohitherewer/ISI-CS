The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 No buyer for Telgi estates

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Bangalore, Feb. 25: Abdul Karim Telgis palatial properties dont attract buyers, the income-tax department has learnt the hard way. 

 An auction this week of two of the stamp scamsters prime properties drew a blank. After two hours, the auction was called off. The next date is March 10. 

 The last time, too, the properties ? on Mosque Road in Frazer town, just 2 km from M.G. Road ? did not attract buyers when they went under the hammer in October last year. 

 However, in the first auction in February last year, a building owned by Telgi on Palace Road was bought by Mac Charles India Limited, a hotel chain. It was the only bidder.

 In the latest bid, the I-T department had quoted a reserve price of Rs 2.86 crore and Rs 2.55 crore for the properties.

 We organised the auction this week only after 10 enquiries came in. But no one turned up, a tax official said.

 Asked if the tag was too hefty, the official said they had quoted prices in keeping with land prices in Bangalore.

 The officials suspect potential buyers are scared because of Telgis official and political clout. But Telgi himself had consented to the auctions to recover his tax dues, they said. 

 The scamster is not an I-T assessee and owes the department crores. Even if they sell all his assets in Mumbai, Khanapur, Bangalore and other places, he will still have to cough up more I-T dues, a police official, involved with the stamp scam probe, said.

 The department can take over Telgis properties, but its first priority would be to sell and recover Telgis tax dues. 

 Tax officials in Mumbai, too, faced the problem of no takers when they called auctions for properties belonging to elusive don Dawood Ibrahim.

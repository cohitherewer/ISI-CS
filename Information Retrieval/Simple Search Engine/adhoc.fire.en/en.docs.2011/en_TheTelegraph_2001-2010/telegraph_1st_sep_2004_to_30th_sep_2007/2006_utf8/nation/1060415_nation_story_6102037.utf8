 Sex taint on IPS officer

 Patna, April 14: An IPS officer who claims he had vowed in his student days never to marry is being probed for alleged sexual exploitation of a woman with false promises of marriage, says our special correspondent.

 The woman says Amitabha Das, Bihar Military Police commandant at Jamui, had given her a gold engagement ring in 1997, but kept putting off the marriage while establishing sexual relations with her.

 Das, who was handpicked by the Election Commission to be Buxar superintendent before the February 2005 polls, alleges its a plot by the Ranbir Sena for the beating it took at his hands.

 Police spokesperson Anil Kumar Sinha said: A woman IPS officer has been assigned to conduct an investigation.

 J amp;K orphans

 Srinagar, Jan. 11 (PTI): Jammu and Kashmir High Court has sought details from the Centre and state government about 550 orphans who were adopted by a Pune-based NGO soon after the October 8 earthquake.

 Acting on a petition filed by the Kashmir Bar Association and some NGOs, the court asked the Centre to file a detailed report and directed the state government to furnish the names and whereabouts of the children adopted by Bharatiya Jain Sangathan. Vacation judge Justice Bashir Ahmad Kirmani gave two weeks to the state government to furnish the names and parentage of the children and also names of those who have given consent for the orphans adoption.

 Bar Association president Mian Abdul Qayoom argued there were contradictions in the statements made by the government about the return of 91 children from Pune. 

 He sought permission from the court for lawyers to visit the children to know their condition.

 Deputy advocate-general M.A. Baig, who represented the state, pleaded that the permission may not be granted as the children might feel as if they are in a jail. Some senior officials were sent to Pune and they found the children in a happy state, he said.

 However, Qayoom insisted that a team of Kashmiri lawyers should be deputed there to find out the actual situation as the government version of the events did not show that the children were in good condition.

 The government said only Bharatiya Jain Sangathan had come forward to help these children ? mostly from the worst-affected Uri and Tangdhar regions. Besides quake victims, parents of those who were hit by militancy, had also approached the government for sending their children to Pune, it said.

 The Bar Association in the December 26, 2005, petition described the sending of the children as smuggling and questioned the motive of the state behind the step, which it termed malafide and politically motivated. 

 It had questioned the authority of the government to send the 550 children from Jammu and Kashmir to Pune and described it as a violation of the international convention on rights of children.

 After the 1993 earthquake in Latur, a move to relocate children to Pune was vetoed and the local MLA and panchayat intervened, though the relocation site was just a few kilometres away, the petition said.

 But in Kashmir, the state has acted as a willing and acceding party to a project, which is unacceptable, the bar association said, seeking directions to bring back all the children and admit them to schools in their native places.

 Jorhat, June 5: Boy for sale. Price: Rs 6,000. Seller: Father 

 With a full-throated sales pitch like any hawker, a widower today hit a busy street of Assam to find a buyer for his three-year-old son because the child was tying him down at home and coming in the way of their survival.

 It was a typical Monday morning in the Upper Assam town of Golaghat, 250 km from Guwahati, teeming with children and officegoers, until Bhaba Baruah, 23, started hawking his son on the busy street. I want to sell my son for Rs 6,000. Are you interested? He can help you with the household chores, the man announced to passersby.

 As a crowd milled around the father and son, news reached the office of the Golaghat unit of the All Assam Students Union (AASU) and a few activists rushed to the site to dissuade Baruah.

 Asked why he wanted to sell his son, Baruah said the boy had become a burden since his mothers death eight months ago. I cannot go out to find work, leaving him alone at home. There is no one to look after him, he said.

 AASU vice-president Jatin Bora, who was in the student unions Golaghat office when the incident occurred, said over phone that some members of his organisation later verified that the boy was Baruahs son.

 We found out that Bhaba hails from Balipathar, in Karbi Anglong. He married about five years ago and the couple had a son but his wife died of complications during another pregnancy. He has nobody else to call his own except a sister, who is married, Bora said.

 Prodded by AASU activists, Baruah admitted that he had borrowed money from a moneylender and intended to clear his debt with the amount he hoped to get by selling his son.

 Bora said Baruahs sister Nira, a resident of Bokajan in Karbi Anglong, was traced immediately. We sent father and son to Bokajan and requested Bhabas sister to take care of the boy, the AASU vice-president said.

 Nira said she found it impossible to believe that her brother would try to make money out of his son. He loves his son so much. I cannot believe it unless I meet my brother, she said. 

 Nira claimed that Baruah and his son were on their way to Nagaon, but had to stay back in Golaghat for a day because they missed the last bus to Bokajan.

 Nira has now promised to take care of the boy.

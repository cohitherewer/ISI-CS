 BJP swing at Lalu spend

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lalu Prasad

 New Delhi, June 23: The BJP has asked finance minister P. Chidambaram to probe the source of the Rs 10,01,250 that Lalu Prasad paid in cash to a five-star hotel in Delhi for his daughters wedding reception.

 In a letter to Chidambaram, BJP spokesman Prakash Javdekar has alleged that while making the payment, the railway minister had violated finance ministry rules relating to transparency about big expenditures by tax-payers.

 The finance ministry has introduced a new Saral form that is supposed to give the government an idea about tax-payers expenditure patterns and sources of income. It has laid down that those making high-value expenditures must give the source of the money spent.

 Before inflicting this provision on the common people, I hope you will set a precedent by asking revenue authorities to enquire from Mr Lalu Prasad Yadav about where he earned Rs 10 lakh, which he paid in cash to Ashok hotel, Javdekars letter says.

 The BJP spokesman cited four reasons why Lalu Prasad should be investigated:

 One, government rules say a tax-payer must furnish his PAN number on any payment above Rs 50,000, but Lalu Prasad hasnt done this on either payment to the hotel.

 Two, Section 133A of the Income-Tax Act says that when a tax-payer spends big money, the income-tax office concerned has the right to call him and ask him to explain the source of his income.

 Three, there had been similar reports of huge expenditure when the Rashtriya Janata Dal leaders elder daughter got married, but no enquiries were made.

 Four, there is already a disproportionate assets case pending in the courts against Lalu Prasad and his wife Rabri Devi.

 According to the BJP, Lalu Prasad paid Rs 9 lakh against receipt number 532337 to Hotel Ashok on May 4. Another receipt (number 532338) shows a payment of Rs 1,01,250 on the same day.

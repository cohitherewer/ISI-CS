 Eyeing India, with books amp; bazookas 

 SUJAN DUTTA

 New Delhi, Jan. 31: A Patriot III missile with its body encased in glass to reveal the electronic innards points skywards. Alongside the most sophisticated missile defence system, get a feel also of the F/A-18 E/F Superhornet and the Swedish Gripen multirole combat aircraft from their simulated cockpits.

 If not, how about delving into the latest in management texts at Elseviers or some refreshing soul food for the mind from the titles by Puffin?

 Bazookas and books signal new foreign investment destinations in India. 

 In the capitals trade fair grounds at Pragati Maidan, Defexpo 2006 opened today alongside the World Book Fair. Both are being held on an unprecedented scale. At Defexpo, global military majors are scouting for potential Indian partners. At the World Book Fair, the best known names in publishing are looking to open India offices.

 Policy-driven changes in the defence sector and in the media are goading foreign players into setting up or expanding businesses in India. The government now allows up to 100 per cent foreign direct investment in non-news and non-current affairs publishing. 

 In the new defence procurement policy, the government has made it mandatory for all foreign vendors to plough back at least 30 per cent of values in offsets. The upshot is that Lockheed Martin and Raytheon, Thales and BAE Systems are beginning to talk more and more to the Tatas and the Mahindras and Larsen and Toubro.

 I invite guests to take advantage of skills in India and collaborate with companies here to export defence products to other countries, said Pranab Mukherjee sensing the mood at the Defexpo inaugural. A total of 420 companies from 39 countries are participating in the event as exhibitors. Several more countries have sent official and ministerial-level delegations.

 Mukherjee was actually hawking Indias appetite for military hardware and software. In 2004, he pointed to latest available statistics, India was the worlds largest importer of arms. 

 In 2006, he said, India was converting its domestic defence industry from a supplier to its armed forces to a competitor in other regional markets.

 Our 39 ordnance factories, eight defence public sector units and 50 defence research laboratories need to take a market approach. They should bring in the latest technologies and develop state-of-the-art products for domestic use as well as for export, the minister told an audience of global military representatives and heads of the organisations he was talking about. 

 India alone is projected to import $6 billion worth of military hardware by 2008 ? in just two years time.

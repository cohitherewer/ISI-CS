 New Delhi, July 29: A proposal by a group of ministers that the government should publish an authorised history of the 1857 war of independence appears to have been dropped.

 The group planning the commemoration next year of the 150th anniversary of the uprising had come up with the idea of an official, government-endorsed history in all major Indian languages. Headed by human resource development minister Arjun Singh, the group suggested that the government should also commission an authorised film on 1857.

 After four meetings, the group placed its suggestions before a 68-member national committee of leaders from across the political spectrum, which met for the first time this month. 

 At the meeting chaired by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, the committee members made it clear they were not keen on an official version of 1857 ? viewed variously as the first war of independence or a sepoy mutiny in accounts by names like Karl Marx and V.D. Savarkar. 

 Instead, they suggested little-known or unpublished documents from the time should be published in the form of a series.

 Participants also suggested that declassified British documents should be studied and published, eyewitness accounts traced and printed and travelogues reprinted. 

 The meeting conceded a role for bodies like the National Book Trust and Publication Division in publishing accounts of events between 1857 and 1947, when India gained Independence.

 The suggestions have now gone back to the group of ministers, which also includes Ambika Soni, P. Chidambaram and Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, which will decide what shape the year-long commemoration will take.

 But it was bound to keep the national committees suggestions in mind because sources said it would not want the Congress-led government to be accused of peddling its own, preferred version of 1857. At the meeting, the Left recalled the work of Marx and the BJP cited Savarkar.

 A National Museum of Freedom is likely to be set up at the Red Fort as part of the celebration. Stamp releases, memorials at state capitals, exhibitions and seminars are also lined up.

 Apart from the anniversary of 1857, several other celebrations are lined up in the coming months: the centenary of the adoption of Vande Mataram, the 75th anniversary of Bhagat Singhs martyrdom, his birth centenary and the 60th anniversary of Indias Independence.

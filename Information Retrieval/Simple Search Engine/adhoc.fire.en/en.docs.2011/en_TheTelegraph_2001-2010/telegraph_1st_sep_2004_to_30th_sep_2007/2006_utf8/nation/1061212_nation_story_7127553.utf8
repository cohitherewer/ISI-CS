 Kerala Left ousts NCP

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Thiruvananthapuram, Dec. 11: K. Karunakarans hope of cosying up to the comrades has suffered a setback with the ruling Left Democratic Front ousting the Nationalist Congress Party, with which his Democratic Indira Congress merged recently.

 At an LDF state committee meeting here today, CPM state secretary Pinarayi Vijayan asked NCP leaders Cyriac John, A.C. Shanmughadas and A.K. Sasindran to go out so that the front could discuss the merger. The three left, without an inkling that the door had been shut on them for good.

 Vijayan said the NCP had no place in the front as there had not been a change in the LDFs stand on Karunakaran, who broke away from the Congress last year.

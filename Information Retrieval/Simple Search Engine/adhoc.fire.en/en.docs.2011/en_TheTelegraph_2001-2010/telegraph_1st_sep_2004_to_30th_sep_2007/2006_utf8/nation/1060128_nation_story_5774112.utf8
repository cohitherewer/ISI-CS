 Modi threat mailer held

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Ahmedabad, Jan. 27: Gujarat police have arrested a Delhi School of Economics graduate from his home in south Delhi for allegedly sending a threatening and abusive email to chief minister Narendra Modi.

 The 32-year-old executives father, a retired deputy secretary, too, is being brought to Gujarat under police custody for questioning.

 Omar Farooq Sidiqqui, an MBA, allegedly sent the email a month ago. He is human resources head with a Delhi-based company, Advance Technology Support, and reportedly earns Rs 60,000 a month.

 His phone number had been kept under surveillance for some time before he and father Irfan were picked up yesterday in a joint raid by the Gujarat polices anti-terrorist squad (ATS) and Delhi police, ATS deputy inspector-general D.G. Vanzara said here.

 Though the father is not directly involved, he had to be summoned to Gujarat because the phone is registered in his name, Vanzara explained. 

 The duo will be produced before a Gujarat court.

 The police have seized Omars laptop, which will be sent to the forensic science laboratory at Gandhinagar.

 Vanzara refused to reveal the content of the mail, saying the language is so indecent and filthy that it is not in the interest of the public to publicise it.

 We want to understand the mind of this D-school graduate ? why such a highly educated person who has also done an MBA and has been drawing a monthly salary of Rs 60,000 (should) write such nasty emails.

 Omars elder brother is an MRCP settled in London. One of his three sisters is a gynaecologist in Kanpur and the other two are Delhi University lecturers.

 Modi received several threatening emails in the past two years, including one from a Mumbai-based software engineer. The chief minister called the youth to Gandhinagar and told him he had forgiven him. The police didnt pursue the case.

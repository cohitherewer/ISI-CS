 RTI helpline in officers memory

 Gurgaon (PTI): A year after 

 Indian Oil Corporation executive S. Manjunath was allegedly 

 murdered by the oil mafia in Uttar Pradesh, a trust devoted 

 to his memory has started a helpline to build awareness 

 on the Right to Information Act and instituted an award 

 for individuals fighting corruption.

 Infosys chief mentor N.R. Narayana Murthy and senior IPS officer Kiran Bedi were the first to call the helpline jointly launched by the Manjunath Shanmugham Memorial Trust and Parivartan, an NGO working for the act.

 RTI activist Arvind Kejriwal, who won this years Magsaysay award in the emergent leader category, said the trust and his NGO came up with the idea of the helpline as Manjunath had fought against corruption and for peoples rights.

 Court order for truant bookie

 New Delhi (PTI): A city court 

 issued a proclamation order against Sanjeev Chawla, alleged 

 bookie and accused in a cricket match-fixing scandal, because 

 of his repeated failure to appear before it in a Fera case.

 The order requires Chawla to appear before the court on February 6, 2007.

 The match-fixing scandal was unearthed by Delhi police six years ago.

 I am convinced that it is not possible to serve the accused by ordinary process as he seems to be evading service on him, said additional chief metropolitan magistrate Kamini Lau while issuing the proclamation order against Chawla.

 The court directed the enforcement directorate to publish the notice in dailies in London, where Chawla is allegedly living.

 Prithvi test

 Balasore (PTI): Prithvi, Indias 

 surface- to-surface medium range missile, was test-fired 

 from the integrated test range at Chandipur, 15 km from 

 here.

 The indigenous single-stage missile was fired at 9.55 am. With a launch weight of 4.6 tonnes, Prithvi can use both solid and liquid propellant.

 CPM leaders shot

 Calcutta: Three CPM leaders 

 have been murdered in Bengals Nadia and Hooghly districts 

 since Saturday night. Police identified the dead as Narayan 

 Debnath, 40, and Sushil Sarkar, 36, who were shot dead in 

 Nadia, and Asim Saha, 30.

 Jolie leaves

 Mumbai (PTI): Angelina Jolie 

 and her partner Brad Pitt have left for home after the shooting 

 for A Mighty Heart in Pune and Mumbai for over a 

 month. The couple left by an early morning flight with their 

 three children.

 A suitcase left inadvertently at the Chennai domestic airports car park created a flutter. It was later found to contain 800 gm of gold jewellery and a digital camera, airport officials said.

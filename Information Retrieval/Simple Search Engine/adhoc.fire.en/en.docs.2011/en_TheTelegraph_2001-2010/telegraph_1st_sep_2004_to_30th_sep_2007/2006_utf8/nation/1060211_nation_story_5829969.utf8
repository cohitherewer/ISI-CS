 Huge explosive grab by Maoists

 R. KRISHNA DAS

 Raipur, Feb. 10: Hundreds of Maoists raided the magazine of Indias largest iron-ore producer in Chhattisgarh last night and carried away about 50 tonnes of explosives after killing eight security personnel and injuring another eight.

 The assault on the National Mineral Development Corporations Hiroli magazine in Bailadila comes nine months after the rebels stormed a Hindalco mining unit in the mineral-rich state, razing several buildings but apparently failing to locate the explosives store.

 The NMDCs entire stock of explosives, used in mining, is stored in Hiroli, situated about 15 km from Kirandul town in Dantewada district and 550 km from the state capital, Raipur. The magazine is guarded by the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF).

 The Maoists had already signalled their growing prowess in the state by killing 13 security personnel in twin attacks on Monday. On Thursday evening, about 700 rebels emerged from the hills around and ringed the magazine, inspector-general of police M.W. Ansari said.

 Around 8 pm, the guerrillas lobbed a few grenades and petrol bombs and began firing. The three jawans guarding the building fired back while their 14 colleagues rushed to their help from the barracks, about 50 metres away.

 As a gunbattle raged for over four hours, the rebels continued to ask the security personnel over loudspeakers to surrender. It was past midnight when the jawans, having taken heavy casualties and run out of ammunition, gave up the fight.

 The rebels failed to clean out the magazine, which can store up to 60 tonnes of explosives, but took away all the jawans weapons and ammunition, sources said.

 With the attackers having destroyed the wireless system, it was left to a civilian, who somehow managed to escape, to inform the CISF post downhill, about 5 km away.

 Reinforcements were sent from Kirandul but by the time they had cautiously made their way to the scene of the attack, it was morning and the rebels had fled.

 Since the Maoists had taken position in the hills and might have planted landmines to kill the personnel rushing to aid (the magazine guards), the force moved with maximum alert, a senior police officer said. The neighbourhood is being combed for the attackers.

 One of the injured, Yuvraj, said from his hospital bed in Bacheli, near Kirandul, that the attack was so sudden that the jawans in the barracks didnt get time to take up vantage positions. Three of the injured are fighting for life.

 This is the first rebel attack on the mining giant, which manages Bailadila Deposit-14/11C and Bailadila Deposit-5,10/11A in Chhattisgarh. In November 2002, however, Maoists had looted two tonnes of explosives from a private magazine in Bhansi, Dantewada, that supplied explosives to NMDC.

 The Bailadila iron-ore project is the NMDCs biggest and brings it the maximum profit. The ore is ideal for steel-making and prized for its quality in the world market.

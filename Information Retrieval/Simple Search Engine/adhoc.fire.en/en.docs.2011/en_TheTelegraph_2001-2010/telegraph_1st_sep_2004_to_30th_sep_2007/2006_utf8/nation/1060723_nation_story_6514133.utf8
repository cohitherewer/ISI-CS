 Govt works on pension fund deal

 MONOBINA GUPTA

 New Delhi, July 22: Faced with the Lefts opposition to some of the provisions in the pension bill, the government seems to be exploring the option of accepting at least one of the amendments suggested by the recalcitrant ally.

 The amendment seeks to entrust the management of the pension fund not to private agencies but to managers of public sector undertakings.

 Two of the core components of the Pension Regulatory Development Authority bill are handing over the management of the fund to private agencies and investing the money in the stock market. The Left is opposing both the provisions.

 While the UPA government has indicated that it is willing to accommodate the Lefts suggestion on PSU managers, it is still not willing to drop the stock market investment option.

 The government has listed the pension bill as one of the legislation it proposes to table during the monsoon session, scheduled to begin on Monday.

 The bill was discussed at a meeting of the UPA-Left coordination committee today. Talks are going on. The government is reworking the bill. But we have not reached there yet, CPM general secretary Prakash Karat said after the meeting.

 Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee is keen to see the pension bill through since it would lessen the financial load on his government. The Left trade unions, however, are opposed to any form of private role in the pension fund. 

 Todays two-hour discussions focused on issues that are expected to come up during the monsoon session.

 The government said it was ready with a response to the note the Left had submitted outlining its opposition to various policies, particularly those linked to the economy and foreign policy. 

 We did not discuss the governments response today because of lack of time. There were important parliamentary issues that had to be discussed, Karat said.

 One of the issues discussed today was the Indo-American nuclear deal and the bill passed by the US Congress. 

 The Left voiced its misgivings about the governments growing proximity to the Bush administration. We have informed the government that we will raise the matter in Parliament, Karat said.

 The Left is demanding a constitutional amendment that will enable Parliament to discuss and ratify any treaty India signs with a foreign country.

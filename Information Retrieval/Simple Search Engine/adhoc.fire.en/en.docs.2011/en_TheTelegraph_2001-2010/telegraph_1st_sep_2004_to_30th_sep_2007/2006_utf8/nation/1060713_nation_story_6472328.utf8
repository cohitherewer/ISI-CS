The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 At top, bid to limit damage

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 New Delhi, July 12: The Centre today swung into controlling the damage from the Mumbai blasts by trying to correct an impression gaining ground that Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and his government were not on top of the situation.

 First came the price rise, then the food imports. This was followed by the DMKs threat to pull out of the UPA government over divestment. Then the Agni and Insat launches failed. Finally, the serial blasts. The credibility of the government appears to have been gravely undermined, sources said.

 Information and broadcasting minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi who, according to the sources, was monitoring the TV coverage, felt it was time to emphasise the confidence-building measures and let these take precedence over the rush of negative images.

 Maharashtra chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh was directed by the Delhi bosses to convene an all-party meeting so that the hawks of the BJP and Shiv Sena could be reined in. 

 The sources claimed that the immediate upshot was that BJP leader L.K. Advani, who had questioned the security preparedness to deal with such blasts, toned down his stand, saying it was not the time to criticise the government. The Lefts decision to call off its agitation over economic issues was cited as another manifestation of the political establishments maturity and solidarity in times of crisis.

 Second, the Prime Minister was advised to address the nation. The sources said Singhs decision to let home minister Shivraj Patil read out his prepared statement yesterday did not go down well with Congress leaders. They felt Singh should have said a few words himself.

 Sonia Gandhi did better by deciding to visit Mumbai at once, the sources said. Singh is likely to visit Mumbai on Friday.

 In his address, Singh emphasised: No one can make India kneel. No one can come in the path of our progress. The wheels of our economy will move on. India will continue to walk tall and with confidence. 

 Describing Mumbai as the symbol of a united and inclusive India, he said the enemies of our nation did not realise that we Indians can stand united. This is living proof of our contempt for terrorism.

 The Congresss concern was that repeated attacks on Indias financial nerve centre could thwart its objective to emerge as Chinas competitor. Therefore, rather than try and do an Atal Bihari Vajpayee and virtually declare war against Pakistan, Singh was counselled to say positive words by saluting the resilience of the people of Kashmir and Mumbai and stress on Indias economic growth.

 Patils performance is also causing disquiet in the Congress and the government. Questions were raised on why Patil addressed the media jointly with home secretary V.K. Duggal and why they apparently gave contradictory answers. On such occasions, the normal practice is for the departments secretary to address the media. If the minister wanted to do it, it should have been a solo show, a source said.

 There was a realisation that the Congress should formulate a clear line on tackling terrorism and not allow its policies to get linked to the welfare of minorities.

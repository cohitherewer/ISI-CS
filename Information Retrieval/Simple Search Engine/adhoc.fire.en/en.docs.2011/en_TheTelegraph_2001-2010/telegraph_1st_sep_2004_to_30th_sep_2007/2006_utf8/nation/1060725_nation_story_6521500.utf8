 Mumbai, July 24: Tanvir Ahmed Mohammed Ansari is a physician. Today, handcuffed and hooded, he was escorted by police through a crowd of television reporters to a court to hear the charges against him, including murder and violation of laws relating to explosives.

 The 33-year-old, who practises traditional Indian medicine, is the fourth man to be arrested in connection with the July 11 Mumbai train blasts that killed nearly 200.

 Picked up by the crime branch from a central Mumbai hospital a few days ago, Ansari was handed over to the anti-terrorism squad (ATS) for formal arrest last night.

 Ansari had received training in Pakistan in handling explosives, bomb-making, and using weapons, ATS chief K.P. Raghuvanshi said. We suspect he was part of this conspiracy. ATS and crime branch officials are jointly interrogating him to ascertain his exact role.

 Although the ATS officially refused to say how important a catch Ansari was, highly-placed Mumbai police officials said he was a hardcore Lashkar-e-Toiba operative.

 Sources said the unani medicine graduate from Nagpur travelled to Tehran in 2004 and then moved to Bahawalpur in Pakistan before attending a Lashkar training camp in Muzaffarabad in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.

 He was trained in launching Stinger missiles and rockets. He also took classes in operating weapons like AK-47 assault rifles, and throwing grenades. He is a hardcore ideologue, and has been trained to give little information if he is arrested, a senior police officer told The Telegraph.

 The source revealed that Ansari has been waiting for instructions from Lashkar commanders since he returned to Mumbai via Tehran. A police officer said investigators traced phone calls allegedly from Nepal and Bangladesh to Ansari before the July 11 explosions asking him to do something.

 A top-level Lashkar commander had called Ansari several times instigating him to act, the officer said.

 Ansaris mother Shaimunnisa said her son is innocent. He is a doctor. He saves lives, does not take lives. The police are free to investigate. But I know my son could not be part of a blasts conspiracy as they suspect. 

 Shaimunnisa also said her son had no link with the banned Students Islamic Movement of India, accused of playing a role in the blasts.

 Ansari, a thin, bearded man in an off-white shirt and black trousers, was produced before additional chief metropolitan magistrate A.M. Garde at the Mazgaon court this afternoon. Asked if he knew what charges had been pressed against him, he said he did not.

 The magistrate remanded him in police custody till August 4.

 On July 21, the ATS had arrested Khalid Sheikh, 24, Kamal Ansari, 32, and Mumtaz Chaudhary, 38. We have got important leads from the trio, Raghuvanshi said. More arrests are likely in the case. We are trying to ascertain the roles played by them in the conspiracy.

 Asked if the ATS had recovered Ansaris passport, he said: He told us he has destroyed his passport. 

 Asked if Ansari had trained others in making the deadly 7/11 cocktail, sources said he would be brought face to face with the others arrested.

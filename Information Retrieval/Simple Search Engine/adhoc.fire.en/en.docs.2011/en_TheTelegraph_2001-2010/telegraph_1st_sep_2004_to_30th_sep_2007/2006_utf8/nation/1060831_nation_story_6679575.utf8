 Duty-free shops clutch at straws

 New Delhi, Aug. 30: Companies running duty-free shops at Indias international airports are keeping fingers crossed on a new rule that requires purchased items to be delivered when passengers are boarding the plane.

 Battling a sales slump since August 11, when tighter rules barred liquids and cosmetics in hand baggage, these firms are hoping the seemingly bizarre rules will work in India. 

 The Centre will relax baggage norms on September 1, weeks after the aborted plot in London to blow up planes forced aviation authorities to ban an assortment of items from being carried into the cabin.

 All that the passengers will have is a bill listing the purchases, after which duty-free shops will have to get the items security-checked and handed over at the gate of the aircraft. 

 There is ambiguity on how the new system of shopping will work. But at least its better than the blanket ban imposed on August 11, said Atul Ahuja, director of Flemingo Duty Free, one of the three such chains in India.

 Ahuja said the ban caused a 35 per cent drop in sales last month. Flemingo, a Dubai-based firm that entered India three years ago, owns 25 shops in 12 airports. The company has invested $6 million here, but is still recovering its investments, Ahuja said.

 If the new system of delivery on aircraft doors works in the US and other countries, theres no reason why it cannot be successfully replicated in India, said an executive of the ITDC, which also runs duty-free outlets. 

 However, some questions remain unanswered. One of those is whether passengers flying out of the country will trust the shops enough to leave behind the purchased items, if only to get them back a while later. 

 It will also lead to a last-minute tallying of bills and, possibly, missing packages. 

 The civil aviation ministry is framing new rules for duty-free shopping, prompting owners to adopt a wait-and-watch policy. We will observe shopping pattern at airports in the next few days. If the situation demands, we may ask the ministry to take a re-look at the new norms, said one operator. 

 After the plan to attack several aircraft mid-flight between Britain and the US was foiled, the new concept of duty-free shopping has become a worldwide phenomenon. But passengers may go through a little discomfort in this, said the senior ITDC official. 

 Just before Canada relaxed the cabin-baggage restrictions on August 18, duty-free shop operators there threatened to sue authorities for losses arising out of the curbs. Their counterparts in India were more forgiving.

 A Mirza with a volley of wisecracks 

 - Shazia set for india tour

 AMIT ROY

 Shazia Mirza, Britains first Muslim comedienne

 London, Oct. 22: Shazia 

 Mirza, who has made a name for herself as Britains 

 first Muslim comedienne, has been advised not to upset 

 Muslims in India, when she undertakes her first British 

 Council-sponsored tour of the country next month.

 Mirza, 30, first came to prominence immediately after 9/11 when audiences were unsure how to react to the way in which she introduced herself.

 Wearing a hijab, she would offer a deadpan delivery: My names Shazia Mirza at least, thats what it says on my pilots licence.

 Mirza told The Telegraph today: I will be going to India on November 2 and doing one-hour shows in a number of cities Mumbai, Goa, Delhi. I have been told the audience will be middle class essentially and that I can do anything but I must take care not to offend Muslims.

 Mirza was born and brought up in Birmingham of parents who had emigrated from Pakistan. She has a science degree from university and was a schoolteacher for a while but such was the demand for her brand of humour that she has become a full-time comedienne. Her first tour of America was a success.

 This is her first trip to India and it is understandable that the British Council should be a little nervous. Hopefully, both the British Council and Mirza will discover that Indians are broad-minded enough to accept her jokes.

 The British have certainly discovered that allowing Mirza to function has helped to defuse some of the problems in relations with the UKs 1.6 million Muslims. 

 Only once has Mirza been set upon by a group of Bangladeshi youths, and that was a long time ago.

 In an article she has submitted to the Left-wing New Statesman weekly, Mirza said: Muslims are at a very difficult period in their history, especially in the West. George Bush and co. are akin to salt on our wounds. When I was growing up in Birmingham, nobody wore the veil, burkha, dustbin liner, whatever, and now when I go back, everyones wearing it. Muslims feel threatened and this is their way of surviving.

 She couldnt resist adding: All the women in my family have started wearing the burkha and this is great because we all use the same bus pass. My brothers have started to use my mothers pass as well. So its not all bad news.

 The point of her kind of humour is not only to have a Muslim woman making fun of members of her own religion but also to draw attention to the stereotypes that the wider British society has of people from the Islamic faith.

 This veil business is not really about the veil at all, wrote Mirza, tongue in cheek. 

 The answer is quite simple: we want Islam to take over the world and Birmingham to be the capital. This is a war between Islam and the west and were winning. It must be obvious by now that whatever we do, we do with a bang.

 Many of her jokes are about sex and the single Muslim girl. She makes a point of revealing, for example, that she is a 30-year-old Muslim virgin. I am worried that if I die a virgin, then when I get to heaven, Ill be one of the 72 virgins that has to sleep with one of the suicide bombers. (Some Muslims believe that a life of piety will earn them indescribable pleasures in heaven.)

 Britain would like to project Mirza proudly as an example of a modern British Asian who can express herself freely in contemporary, multicultural Britain. It is a high-risk strategy but so far it has worked.

 Amuls big slice faces the knife

 An Amul ad: Ahmedabad agony

 Ahmedabad, March 25: Milkman of India Verghese Kurien no longer around, Amul may soon have to give lesser local brands right of way in the Ahmedabad milk mart.

 The taste of India corners nearly half the Rs 700-crore market here, swamping out brands like Uttam, owned by the Ahmedabad District Producers Union, and Mother Dairys Sugam.

 Amul, marketed by the Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation once headed by Kurien, sells almost 6 lakh litres a day. In comparison, Uttam manages about 80,000 litres and Sugam 76,000.

 Over the past six months, the Ahmedabad union had been asking the Gujarat federation to withdraw from its territory. Chairman Mohan Bharwad had met Kurien several times and told him he was finding it tough competing with Amul.

 Finally, Bharwad moved court, alleging Kurien was dumping milk procured from other districts in the market here under the Amul brand name. It is believed this dispute eventually cost Kurien his chair.

 Bharwad is hoping Uttam will now get a chance to capture the market. Once our plant is commissioned, our capacity will be around 4.5 lakh litres, enough to supply the Ahmedabad market.

 But if Uttam were to grow, the Gujarat federation would have to withdraw its packed milk from the biggest milk market in the state. Bharwad claimed he had got positive indications from the federation.

 But Ramsinh Parmar, chairman of the Kheda District Cooperative Milk Producers Union, said: It will not be immediately possible to withdraw Amul from the Ahmedabad market as the Ahmedabad union cannot meet the milk requirement. But soon we are going to work out some arrangement.

 Amul was originally a brand of the Kheda District Cooperative Milk Producers but soon came to be recognised as the Gujarat federations umbrella brand.

 Bharwad accused the Gujarat federation under Kurien of step-motherly treatment. Though the interests of farmers was our prime concern, the federation did not allow us to increase fat milk procurement price, which is why we could not utilise our total capacity, he said.

 The Ahmedabad union chairman said district cooperatives like Mehsana and Surat sell their milk first in the local market under their brand names. Other cooperatives enter the market only when the district cooperative has exhausted its entire procurement. 

 The only exception is Ahmedabad, where Amuls market share was nearly half. In the interest of local farmers, it needs to be corrected, Bharwad said.

 India in bribery big league 

 Oct. 4: India has emerged as a superpower in bribery while doing business abroad, according to a survey that has tossed up a mixture of consternation and concern at home.

 Companies from India, China and Russia all emerging export powers are among the most likely to give bribes abroad, according to the survey by corruption watchdog Transparency International.

 The 2006 Bribe Payers Index (BPI), based on responses of more than 11,000 business people in 125 countries, showed India, China and Russia who together account for nearly 9 per cent of global exports at the very bottom of a list of 30 countries rated for their propensity to bribe abroad. 

 India has scored the least 4.62 on a scale of 10. A score of 10 indicates a perception of no corruption, while zero means corruption is seen as rampant.

 In the case of China and other emerging export powers, efforts to strengthen domestic anti-corruption activities have failed to extend abroad, the watchdog said.

 The survey comes at a time when several Indian companies have acquired foreign companies.

 Some Indian industrialists reacted with outrage but a few conceded corruption is an issue. Indian companies going abroad represent some of our finest corporate entities, said Vivek Bharati, a Ficci adviser.

 But D.H. Pai Panandikar, who heads a think tank, said: It (bribery) happens everywhere. This is not peculiar to India, but the extent of corruption in Indian businesses is much more than some other countries.

 Although India, China, Russia and Turkey were the worst offenders, the watchdog also singled out Italy and France.

 The two countries, which ranked 20 and 15, were in the bottom six of the list when responses from Africa were isolated. If you look at how respondents in Africa and lower income countries responded, sometimes the companies from wealthier countries seem to be bribing virtually as much, an official said.

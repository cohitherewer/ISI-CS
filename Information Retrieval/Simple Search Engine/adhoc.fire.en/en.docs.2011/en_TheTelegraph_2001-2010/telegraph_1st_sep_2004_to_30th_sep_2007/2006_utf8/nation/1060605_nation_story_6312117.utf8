 Balm for Rahul in Atal sympathy

 MANJEET SEHGAL WARRIOR

 Manali/Shimla, June 4: The first comments from the BJP offering sympathy and help to Rahul Mahajan, recovering from a possible drug overdose, came today with Atal Bihari Vajpayee saying such mistakes happen in young age.

 Mistakes are often made in youth when you fall in bad company. Rahul has also made one. Well try to set it right. Efforts will be made to give a new direction to Rahul, the former Prime Minister told reporters after a party meeting in Manali.

 The BJP seemed to be distancing itself from Pramod Mahajans son after he was admitted to hospital in a critical condition early on Friday morning, allegedly following a late-night binge featuring drinks and drugs.

 Embarrassed by the scandal amid a buzz about Rahul joining the party sometime soon, BJP leaders have been emphasising that he is not a party member and that his problem is a personal one.

 Vajpayee was equally careful in distancing the BJP from the scandal, but his comments suggested the party might not wash its hands of the young man altogether. 

 The party has nothing to do with this episode but well definitely try to improve Rahul, he said.

 Asked whether the BJP might give Rahul a role in national politics, Vajpayee seemed to leave the issue open.

 He will only be able to achieve this place with hard work and talent. The party never gives national fame to any leader; it is the leader who achieves it with his hard work and talent. Asked whether the incident had tarnished the image of the BJP, he said he didnt think so.

 Vajpayee, who had last December intriguingly described Pramod Mahajan as the BJPs Lakshman ? throwing power equations in the party briefly into a turmoil ? was asked who the next Lakshman was going to be.

 Lakshman is born only once, was the terse answer.

 He denied any factionalism in the BJP, saying: There is no infighting in the party and if there is something, well set it right.

 Terror salvo

 Days after the attempted militant strike on the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh headquarters in Nagpur, Vajpayee alleged that the Centres soft policies were encouraging terrorists to step up their attacks.

 He also mentioned the recent attack on tourists, from Bengal and Gujarat, in Kashmir and the growing strength of the Maoists.

 Vajpayee criticised the rise in prices, saying: During our time, foodgrain was exported but today we are forced to import the same due to fall in production.

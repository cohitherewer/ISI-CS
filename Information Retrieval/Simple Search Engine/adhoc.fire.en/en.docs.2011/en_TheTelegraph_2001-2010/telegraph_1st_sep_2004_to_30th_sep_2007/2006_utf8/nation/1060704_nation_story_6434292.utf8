 Mumbai slums in UN showcase

 New Delhi, July 3: A UN report has picked Mumbai to highlight the problem of slums, where nearly a third of the worlds urban population lives.

 In a chapter ? Mumbais quest for world city status ? UN-Habitats State of the World Cities Report 2006-7 points out: More people live in Mumbais slums than in the entire country of Norway. Mumbai has five million slum dwellers.

 The report takes a global overview of slums. A few chapters are case studies on cities like Mumbai, Paris, Vancouver and New Orleans.

 The Mumbai part says that despite the active role played by NGOs and slum bodies, the situation of slum dwellers in Mumbai remains dire. 

 Only 5 per cent of slum households had direct access to water through individual taps. Nearly three-fourth of slum households depended exclusively on public toilets: less than 1 per cent of Mumbais slum population had access to individual toilets or to pay-per use toilets.

 Still, Mumbai was a magnet for Indians from the rest of the country.

 Quoting from a 2003 report by private consultancy firm McKinsey amp; Co, it says the city needs to build at least 1.1 million affordable housing units in the next decade.

 The data collated by the report says that slum dwellers in developing countries are worse off than those who live in rural areas.

 The worlds one billion slum people are more likely to die earlier, experience more hunger and disease, get less education and fewer chances of employment than those urban residents who dont live in slums, it concludes. In countries like Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Haiti and India, child malnutrition in slums is comparable to that in rural areas.

 The report says 30 per cent of the worlds urban people live in slums. Of the slum dwellers, 60 per cent are in Asia.

 Cops quiz Sahils friend 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Sahil: Noose tightens?

 Mumbai, June 10: Delhi police today questioned Haroon Qazi, the co-owner of Velocity discotheque and alleged friend of Sahil Zaroo, the youth accused of bringing drugs to Rahul Mahajans party last week.

 A team led by Suresh Kaushik of Connaught Place police station has been camping in Mumbai for the last three days to verify information Sahil has given during his interrogation.

 Kaushik, who had a 30-minute meeting with Qazi at a coffee shop, asked him about his relationship with Sahil and his social life. He was called for questioning after Sahils phone records showed he had made calls to Qazis Mumbai number on June 1, the day of the party.

 The bash that stretched late into the night claimed Bibek Moitra, the secretary of Rahuls late father Pramod Mahajan, and sent Rahul to hospital and then to jail.

 Qazi told the police he met Sahil in 2004 in connection with a New Years Eve party that Sahil and his Kashmiri friend, Babrak, wanted to organise. But, he added, he has not interacted with Sahil since then. 

 I had organised New Year parties earlier and, hence, they wanted me to organise one at the Oberoi. Sahil told me his uncle has two shops in the hotel?. I dont know anything more about Sahil since he was not a friend, Qazi told The Telegraph over phone this evening. 

 He denied having received any calls from Sahil on June 1.

 I was in the US from January to June 4. International roaming is not activated on my phone and, hence, I have never received any call from Zaroo either in June or before that. I showed him (Kaushik) my passport, which records the dates when I left and arrived, Qazi said.

 The police also quizzed Qazi about his friendship with Bibek.

 Yes, I was friends with Bibek and had met Rahul through him. I met Bibek in 2000 to secure a college admission and had been meeting them. We went out for dinner together, but I have never seen or heard (about) any of them consuming any narcotic substance, Qazi said. 

 He added that he hadnt been in touch with either Bibek or Rahul for the last few years. I am just an innocent bystander being dragged into this, he said.

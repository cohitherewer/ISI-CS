 Tale of minority deprivation

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New 

 Delhi, Nov. 17: A committee to study the social, 

 economic and educational status of Muslims has not recommended 

 reservation, but is believed to have urged the government 

 to examine the scope for affirmative action.

 The report, prepared by a committee chaired by Justice Rajinder Sachar and presented to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today, has confirmed the backwardness of Muslims.

 It said Muslims lag behind other religious groups on most developmental indicators. They were poorer, more illiterate, had lower access to education, were relatively under-represented in public and private sector jobs and found it harder to access credit for self-employment. 

 In urban areas, the community mostly lives in slums. 

 The committee found variations in the condition of Muslims across states and regions. 

 The committee stressed the need for formulation of appropriate programmes to address the educational and economic backwardness of the community, a statement by the Prime Ministers Office said.

 Singh told the committee that he wanted a discussion on the report to evolve a national consensus on how to improve the social, educational and economic status of Muslims. 

 This would be in accordance with the governments commitment to achieve growth with equity, to strengthen our pluralistic ethos and build an inclusive society, the statement said. 

 The report will be tabled in Parliament in the winter session.

 Singh said he had felt an acute lack of authentic, comprehensive and updated information on Muslims. 

 The Opposition BJP said it would support government efforts to assist the community if these were not guided by poll politics. 

 We warn the government against using the recommendations as a launching pad for introducing a religion-based quota regime, BJP spokesman Arun Jaitley said.

 Dalit demand

 The Sachar Committee wants Dalit Muslims classified as a most backward caste a proposed sub-group of OBCs. But an apolitical organisation of Dalit Muslims, the All India United Muslim Morcha, has demanded that Dalit Muslims be re-inducted into the list of the scheduled castes, from where they were ejected in 1950.

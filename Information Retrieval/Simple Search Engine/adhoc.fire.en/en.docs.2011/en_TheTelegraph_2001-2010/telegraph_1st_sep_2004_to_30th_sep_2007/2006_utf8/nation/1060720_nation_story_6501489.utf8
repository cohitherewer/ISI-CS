 Mystery of the lone body

 SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI

 Mumbai, July 19: A strange coincidence thrown up by an unclaimed body and a hoax email has landed sleuths probing the Mumbai blasts in a dilemma.

 The email had said last week that the Lashkar-e-Qahar had carried out the blasts. The mail said 16 people had taken part in the strikes, of whom one died.

 Since police are claiming now that the mail was a hoax, the matter should have ended there, but for a twist.

 Out of the nearly 200 blast victims, only one body is yet to be claimed.

 Till this evening, the mangled body ? the head attached to a part of a male chest ? was lying unclaimed in the morgue of Sion Hospital.

 Though all the bodies of the people who died in the blast ? 207 in all ? have been identified, nobody has come forward to claim this body, a source in the anti-terrorist squad said.

 Many have been quick to put two and two together and speculate whether there is a grain of truth ? intended or otherwise ? in the hoax email.

 But the investigators are livid. These are vicious attempts aimed at misleading the public for the sake of sensation, said an officer.

 But the police did concede that they know little about the body other than that it was found at the Matunga Road station, one of the seven targets of the bombers.

 K.P. Raghuvanshi, who heads the anti-terrorism squad, said the force would not spare any effort to identify the body. We are trying various means to get some information about the dead person. The face is mangled and only the head along with a part of the torso was recovered. We have asked for DNA mapping of the body.

 He added that the police were working with doctors to reconstruct the face.

 When that is done, we will try to create a sketch of the face and put it out to see if anyone can identify the body, Raghuvanshi said.

 He also brushed aside suggestions that the unidentified body could belong to a suicide bomber. 

 Another senior officer said: Fidayeen attacks have a certain model. There is a pattern to the blasts. All the targeted bogies were first class coaches of outbound trains from Churchgate. All of them were in the fourth compartment from the engine.

 Listing the pattern, the officer said the attackers are unlikely to have opted for a lone aberration. There wouldnt have been an exception in one particular case. It is impossible that of the seven blasts, only one was a fidayeen attack. If suicide bombers had been used, we would have had seven unidentified bodies, not one.

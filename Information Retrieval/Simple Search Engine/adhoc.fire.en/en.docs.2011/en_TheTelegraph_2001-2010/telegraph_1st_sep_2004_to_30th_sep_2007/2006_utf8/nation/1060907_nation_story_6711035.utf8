 Sample test in Mattoo case

 New Delhi (PTI): Delhi High Court on Wednesday asked the CBI to prove that the blood and semen samples collected in the Priyadarshini Mattoo murder case were not tampered with before being sent for analysis to the Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics.

 A bench headed by Justice R.S. Sondhi questioned additional solicitor-general Amrinder Saran for over an hour as his counsel could not give satisfactory answers.

 The court had observed on Tuesday that except on two grounds, the judgment of the trial court appeared to be supporting the prosecutions view that accused Santosh Singh is involved in the Mattoo murder case.

 The two grounds, which the CBI claimed were irrefutable evidence but were rejected by the trial judge, were the findings of the DNA test by the Hyderabad-based laboratory which established that semen samples recovered from Mattoos undergarments and blood stains collected from the visor of Singhs helmet belonged to the same person.

 Mattoo, a law student, was raped and strangled to death on January 23, 1996.

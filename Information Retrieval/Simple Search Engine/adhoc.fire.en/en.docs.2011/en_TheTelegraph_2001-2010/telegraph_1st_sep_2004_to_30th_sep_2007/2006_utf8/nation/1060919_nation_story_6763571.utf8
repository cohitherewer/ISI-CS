 Delhi dusts Dawood hope again

 Dawood

 New Delhi, Sept. 18: India will make another bid to step up pressure on Pakistan to act against Dawood Ibrahim, raising the issue at a key conclave of Interpol beginning in Brazil tomorrow.

 Delhis case against Dawood will be presented at the 74th General Assembly session of Interpol, which will be held in Rio de Janeiro from September 19 to 22.

 The session is being considered significant among Indian intelligence circles as CBI director Vijay Shanker, who also heads the National Central Bureau of India (Interpol, New Delhi), would bring up the issue against the backdrop of a special notice which the assembly had decided to issue against Dawood at Berlin last year. 

 While pitching its arguments, the Indian delegation is expected to press forward the need to create a mechanism that makes it mandatory for signatory countries to pay heed to notices issued by the Interpol and help another member country to arrest and hand over a wanted person. 

 Disclosing Dawoods various addresses, including one in an upscale colony in Karachi, the special notice issued in March this year had placed the gangster in the same category as top al Qaida operatives.

 Circulated to the UN member nations, the notice gave details of Dawoods 11 passports and 16 aliases. It lists NU 37, 30th Street, Defence Housing Authority, Pakistan, as a possible hideout of the don. The second address mentioned in the notice is White House, near Saudi Mosque, Clifton Road.

 The notice was expected to make it more difficult for Islamabad to host Dawood but no progress on arresting him was discernible till now.

 While eight out of 11 passports of the don were issued from Mumbai, the remaining three were issued from Pakistan, Yemen and the UAE. 

 Dawood had got his Pakistani passport (G866537), the latest among the 11, on August 12, 1991. If the date is authentic, it suggests that he could have been liaising with Pakistan much before the 1993 Bombay blasts. 

 The general secretariat of Interpol at Lyon, France, had forwarded contents of the notice to all the 184-member countries, including Pakistan, asking them to freeze the dons assets and impose a travel ban and arms embargo as Dawood is the subject of UNs anti-terrorism sanctions.

 The four-day deliberations of the Interpol assembly, which will draw senior law enforcement officials and experts from around the world, will discuss issues relating to terrorism, human trafficking, drugs and organised crimes, cyber crime and expansion of the Interpol database. 

 The delegates will also review a proposal for the establishment of the Interpol anti-corruption academy.

 Telling silence on pension bill

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 25: Chances of the pension bill getting passed in the winter session of Parliament have receded further with the CPM leadership failing to convince its trade union comrades to support the legislation.

 Yesterday, the Congress leadership had renewed efforts to bring the Left around to its view. Left leaders said the pension formula remained unacceptable.

 However, opposition to the Pension Fund Regulatory Development Authority Bill came mostly from MPs and trade union leaders and not the party leadership. 

 Sources pointed out that CPM politburo member and Rajya Sabha MP Sitaram Yechury (in picture) present at the meeting was silent. 

 CPI MP and trade union leader Gurudas Dasgupta was the first to protest. 

 The CPMs leader in the Lok Sabha, Basudeb Acharya, joined him. Both Dasgupta and Acharya said they did not accept the governments formula.

 Yechurys silence could be seen as keenness on the part of the CPM leadership to go along with the UPA and pass the bill. 

 Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has supported Union finance minister P. Chidambaram on the legislation since it would relieve the states exchequer of the responsibility of footing the bill for pension.

 Current pension liabilities come to 1.64 per cent of the gross domestic product or Rs 52,480 crore on the basis of estimated GDP for 2005-06.

 Yechury told the government that the party would get back to it on Tuesday after consulting the leadership. The party is willing to walk the extra mile to please Bhattacharjee but other Left Front partners are not ready to follow suit.

 The CPMs willingness to accommodate the governments stand is visible in the fact that it has not raised the possibility of public sector managers of the fund investing in stocks. 

 It has objected to handing over the pension fund to private managers. The Centre has agreed to place it under a public sector entity. But this entity is more than likely to invest the money in the stock market. The CPM, however, is willing to look the other way.

 Last week, the UPA leadership at a co-ordination meeting with the Left had mooted a new pension formula to make the bill acceptable to the Left. 

 But the allies rejected it after the government refused to give an assurance on maintaining the present position where 50 per cent of a government employees basic salary is paid as pension.

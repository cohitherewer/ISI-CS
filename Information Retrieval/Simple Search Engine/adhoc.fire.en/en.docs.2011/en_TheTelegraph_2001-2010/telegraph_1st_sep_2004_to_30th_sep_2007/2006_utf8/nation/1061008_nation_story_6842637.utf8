 Call for Delhi role in Lanka

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chennai, Oct. 7: A pact between Sri Lankas two main political parties has paved the way for a more pro-active role by Delhi in the peace process, Colombos former chief negotiator with the Tamil rebels said here today.

 G.L. Peiris said the ruling Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and main Opposition United National Party (UNP) have agreed that the countrys ethnic crisis needs a political solution.

 Without giving details, he said their joint document would say there is a justifiable role for the military in tackling terrorism, but at the end of the day it has to be a political solution.

 In the changed circumstances, an Indian role is indispensable, Peiris said. We expect India to play a more vigorous role.

 Peiris said Colombo appreciated Delhis constraints after burning its fingers with the Indian Peace Keeping Force in the 1980s. But the understanding between the two most important Sinhala parties on the ethnic issue should remove in part some of the inhibitions that India faces vis--vis the peace process.

 The UNP leader, who was the chief government negotiator in the first six rounds of the peace talks, said a divided Sinhala polity had hobbled the Norway-brokered peace process in recent years, with every advance being followed by a setback.

 Peiris wouldnt provide details of the agreement till the two parties signed a formal pact, but spoke of an exciting period ahead.

 There was too much of labelling and polarisation in the past which denied a middle ground. So, we have not used words like federalism or unitary as we do not want to use such labels when the consensus is being shaped.

 Peiris said the UNP and SLFP, which met in Colombo on Thursday to agree on six key issues of national interest, would sign a memorandum of understanding in the presence of the Buddhist clergy by October 15.

 Although the Tamil Tigers in the north and fringe Sinhala parties like the Janatha Vimkuti Peramuna in the south are yet to react, the development is a huge bonus before the planned resumption of peace talks by October 30, he said.

 Cry to end child marriage

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 27: Prevention isnt always better than cure.

 At least, that is what activists fighting against child marriage believe.

 A section of womens organisations wants the government to bring a legislation that will seek to abolish child marriage.

 But the government ? the home and law ministries ? is not keen on it. They believe it may hurt traditional customs. This would mean also hurting vote bank politics, said Sudeshna of the National Alliance for Child Rights, a voluntary organisation.

 The government has so far been depending on the 1929 Child Marriage Restraint Act to check the menace. The act has barely been implemented, she says.

 Child marriages have been taking place with impunity throughout the country, particularly in the heartland states of Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan.

 Faced with the need for a stronger law, the government introduced the Prevention of Child Marriage Bill in the Rajya Sabha two years ago. It was later sent to a parliamentary standing committee, which heard out representations from various groups. Several of them argued in favour of a bill that would abolish and not just prevent child marriage. The department of women and children sided with them.

 Prevention means that a society will make an effort to stop child marriage. Abolition means it will end the practice. The government wants to go from restraint to prevention. We want it to go to abolition, says Sudeshna. It is a question of attitude. Abolition implies a much stronger commitment.

 According to the 2005 UN report on the state of world population, 50 per cent of girls in India are married before they are 18. The legal age of marriage is 18 for girls and 21 for boys in the country. Recently, a Delhi High Court verdict reducing a girls legal age for marriage to 15 years triggered a wave of protests from womens organisations.

 They agree that the clause of prevention is a step forward from restraining child marriage. The prevention act sanctions child marriage prevention officers for the first time, says Sudeshna.

 The prohibition officers, she explains, will be the agents of change. They will be empowered to stop the marriage and also work at a social level to bring about a change of attitude.

 Rampant child marriage is taking a heavy toll on girls and women. India has a very high maternal mortality rate. Young girls drop out of school, are married off and then get pregnant at an age when it could prove fatal.

 Activists say violence against women is on the rise. A UNDP report on violence against children looked at child marriage as an indicator of the extent of violence that exists in that society, says Sudeshna.

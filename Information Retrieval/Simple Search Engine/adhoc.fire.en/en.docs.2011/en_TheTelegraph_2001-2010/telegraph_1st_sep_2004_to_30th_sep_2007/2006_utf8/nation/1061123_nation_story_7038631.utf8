Mumbai, Nov. 22: An Indian doctor, little known in his own country but a hero to the Chinese, will be remembered by President Hu Jintao who meets his family here tomorrow.

 Dwarkanath Kotnis, who died while treating wounded Chinese soldiers over six decades ago, is perhaps the only foreigner buried at Chinas Heroes Cemetery. His story is told in Chinese textbooks and a medical school has been named after him.

 Dr Kotnis was sent to China as part of an Indian medical mission in 1938, a year after the Sino-Japanese war began. He worked on the frontline till his death in 1942 from epileptic suffocation. He was only 32.

 The Chinese consulate has told us he (Hu) wants to meet us on Thursday, 79-year-old Vatsala Kotnis, the doctors younger sister, told Reuters. We are excited.

 The agency said the family would gift Hu a handcrafted bedspread made in Solapur Dr Kotniss birthplace similar to the one they had given to former Chinese Premier Li Peng when he met them in 2001. Visiting Chinese dignitaries never forget the family. And for all his anonymity in India, the doctor has a Calcutta connection that is still alive.

 During those days, he was closest to Dr B.K. Bose who was also part of the mission. Dr Bose, on his return in 1943, founded the Dr Kotnis Memorial Acupuncture Centre, which has branches all over Calcutta and its suburbs. It trains hundreds every year, Vatsala said. The sad bit is that while people know about the hospital, they dont know the man.

 The doctors other sister, Manorama, said: We hope the fact that the President of China is meeting his family will make people think.

 He wrote to us how he learnt to use chopsticks. But later, his letters only spoke of the scarcity of medicines and lack of infrastructure, Vatsala said. One day, the letters stopped coming. A year and a half later, they learnt of his death.

 Amid the shock, there was solace. We came to know he had married a Chinese woman and had a four-month-old son. They visited us in 1958. My nephew had the same smile. He was named Ing Hwa, which means an Indian flower, Manorama said.

 Ing Hwa died at 24, just after completing his medical course. Dr Kotniss wife Guo Qinglan remarried and lives in Dalian. She is 91 and has visited the Kotnises many times.

 Hurriyat spurns round table

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Srinagar, Feb. 20: The moderate faction of the Hurriyat Conference today announced it would not participate in the Prime Ministers all-party round table conference on Kashmir on Saturday.

 Such a meeting would only add to the confusion and, in fact, damage the ongoing dialogue process on Kashmir, faction chief Mirwaiz Omar Farooq said.

 The announcement came after a series of meetings the Mirwaiz held with the factions executive committee, working committee and the general council at the uptown Rajbagh headquarters.

 It has been unanimously decided that the Hurriyat shall not participate in the round table conference to be held in New Delhi on February 25, he said.

 The Mirwaiz rued that the Indian government had neither made concrete proposals for the resolution of the Kashmir dispute nor worked to bring about a material change in the ground situation so that the common man felt a sense of relief.

 He opposed the idea of inviting pro-India leaders to the round table conference. Only those who started the present movement and who disputed the present status of Kashmir should have been invited to the round table meeting, he said.

 Such a meeting was highly premature and when the real time for such a meeting would come, it should include representatives from both sides of disputed Kashmir, he said.

 The Mirwaizs stand puts him in line with the breakaway Hurriyat faction led by Syed Ali Shah Geelani, which has also refused to attend the conference.

 Shabir Shah of the Democratic Freedom Party and the Kashmir Bar Association have likewise spurned the offer. They claimed it was an exercise to buy time on Kashmir on the eve of the US Presidents visit to India.

 Nod to amend criminal code

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 3: The Union cabinet tonight gave the go-ahead to an amendment bill that will revise the criminal procedure code on the basis of law commission recommendations.

 The Criminal Law (Amendment) Bill, 2003, proposes to confer on the families of victims the right to appeal against verdicts favouring the accused if they feel their plea for justice has not been handled well.

 The amendments could help prevent a repeat of the Jessica Lal and Priyadarshini Mattoo cases in which the accused have gone scot-free because of inadequacies in the criminal justice system.

 They also include a provision for protection of witnesses, which would prevent them from turning hostile. 

 A new section for protection of witnesses is likely to be inserted into the Indian Penal Code, which will prescribe punishment of a jail term of up to seven years or a fine or both.

 If the amendments are cleared by Parliament, people can become a party along with the state and fight for justice against the accused.

 The changes will put an end to the practice of witnesses turning hostile after recording their confessional statements before a magistrate and meet the demand of law enforcement agencies to protect witnesses from pressure of any kind.

 Union finance minister P. Chidambaram said after the cabinet meeting that the proposed amendments on the basis of 154th, 177th and 178th reports of the law commission would result in a better, effective and humane criminal justice system.

 Implementation of the recommendations of the 154th report would result in a better, effective and humane criminal justice system, he said.

 He said the home ministry would give final touches to the legislation and efforts were on to bring it in the ongoing session of Parliament.

 Some of the other features of the bill include protection of citizens against indiscriminate arrests and interrogation without the presence of lawyers.

 The legislation also seeks to give arrested persons the right to have their family or friends informed.

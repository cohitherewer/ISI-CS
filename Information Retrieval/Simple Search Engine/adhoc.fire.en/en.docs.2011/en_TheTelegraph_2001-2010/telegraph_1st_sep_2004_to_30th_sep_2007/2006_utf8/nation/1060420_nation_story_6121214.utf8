 5-day weather forecast, on Net

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 19: Indian weather scientists have opened a direct channel of communication with consumers ? via cyberspace, and will soon provide information through e-mail and SMS.

 Five-day weather forecasts for 20 cities and actual weather observations updated every six hours from 200 stations across India will be available on a weather portal launched by the department of science and technology today.

 Science and technology minister Kapil Sibal unveiled the portal that is being described as a one-stop basic weather information provider for the public.

 Data from the Indian Meteorological Department and the National Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasting will be extracted to provide consumer-friendly information on the website www.indiaweatherwatch.org.

 The five-day forecasts ? now available for 20 cities ? will include information about rainfall, maximum and minimum temperatures, and cloud cover. The portal will offer five-day forecasts for 40 cities from June 1, 2006.

 The website will also have general and zone-wise weather bulletins and a special page for severe weather events ? whenever they occur.

 A special link on the portal will also provide consumers explanations of weather terminology ? the meanings of meteorological terms such as western disturbance, depression, scattered rainfall and isolated rains.

 Some of these terms have never been explained to people before, said Akhilesh Gupta, a scientist at the National Centre for Medium-Range Wea-ther Forecasting, which has been issuing five-day weather forecasts for several years.

 People could now use this website to know all they want to know about the weather over India without trying to decode information on the Indian Meteorological Department and National Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasting websites which are primarily intended for scientists, Gupta said.

 He said individuals could register at the portal and opt for weather alerts via e-mail or SMS. Were still working out communication protocols for this but, hopefully, well have this alert system in place within a year, he added.

 The portal, hosted by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry, will also look for software technologies that will allow it to transmit such weather alerts in Indian languages.

 It will also provide agricultural advisories for different agro-climatic zones. These advisories will have zone-specific information about routine farm operations such as sowing, harvesting, irrigation scheduling, and fertilizer applications.

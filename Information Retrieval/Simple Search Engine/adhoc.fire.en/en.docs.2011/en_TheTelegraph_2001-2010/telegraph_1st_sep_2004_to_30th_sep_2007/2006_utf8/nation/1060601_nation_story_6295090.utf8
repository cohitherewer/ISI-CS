New Delhi, May 31: One of the most elite special 

forces of the military, the Marine Commandos (MARCOS), was at the centre of todays 

upsurge of violence in Kashmir after its good-Samaritan effort went awry and resulted 

in the deaths of 22 children in an accident. 

 The army opened fire and killed two protesters this morning when a mob allegedly surrounded the MARCOS base at Watlab near the Wullar lake.

 The schoolchildren from Handwara were being given a joyride by the MARCOS in the picturesque freshwater lake in north Kashmir when the speedboat overturned. Till this morning, the bodies of 21 children and a teacher were found from the depths. The naval detachment in Kashmir is a reserve under the armys 15 Corps that is deployed in the Valley.

 Like the army, the MARCOS in Kashmir is also on a drive that is called WHAM ? an acronym for winning hearts and minds ? but the military is so intensely resented in the area around Bandipore that even a tragic accident has become cause for mobilisation against the government.

 Chief of naval staff admiral Arun Prakash ordered navy chief of personnel vice admiral N. K. Verma, to go to Kashmir immediately, meet the chief minister and convey condolences. The navy also announced a compensation of Rs 20 lakh for the families of the children.

 Reports reaching navy headquarters here said the children from a private primary school in Handwara aged between seven and 14 years were visiting the Wullar on an excursion. The teachers requested the MARCOS for a ride on their vessel, a BAUT (Boat Assault Universal Type) with an outboard motor that is capable of skimming over the water at high speeds. The children were taken out twice and the BAUT overturned when it was on a third circuit of the lake, about 50 to 60 metres from where it had started. 

 The children were said to be seated on the rim of the BAUT and were excited by the spray of water thrown up as it turned. The vessel overbalanced and upturned. A BAUT has a capacity to carry 16 fully equipped combat troops. There were at least 33 children and adults without lifejackets on the vessel. A teacher and 11 children were rescued.

 Suitable disciplinary action would be taken against the guilty personnel, navy headquarters sources said. The army has ordered a Court of Inquiry headed by a brigadier. The state government has also ordered a judicial inquiry.

 Shortly after the incident, 13 Rajasthani workers were injured when an unknown assailant lobbed a grenade at them near Sopore. This morning, about 600 villagers from Bandipore and Watlab gathered in front of the MARCOS detachments camp. 

As the police and the army tried to keep them at bay, 

defence sources in Delhi said, someone opened fire and injured lance naik B. P. 

Singh. The army opened fire and killed two protesters, one of whom was allegedly 

carrying a pistol.

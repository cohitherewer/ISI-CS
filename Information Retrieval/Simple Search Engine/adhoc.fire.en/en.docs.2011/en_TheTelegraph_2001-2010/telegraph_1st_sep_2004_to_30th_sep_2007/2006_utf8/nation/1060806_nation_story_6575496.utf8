 Karat on Reliance

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Ahmedabad, Aug. 5: CPM leader Prakash Karat today asked the Centre to order a probe into the charge that Reliance benefited from the Iraqi oil-for-food scandal.

 It has got the maximum number of oil vouchers. It has paid the maximum surcharge. But no investigation has been carried out against it. I fail to understand why, the CPM general secretary said.

 The UN-sponsored Volcker committee had named Reliance as a non-contractual beneficiary along with three other parties.

 If former external affairs minister Natwar Singh and the Congress could be investigated on the basis of the Volcker report, why cannot Reliance be investigated? he asked. We will demand in Parliament that investigations should be carried out against Reliance.

 In a statement, the Mukesh Ambani-owned Reliance Industries said it had always followed national and international laws and norms. The Government of India and its various departments have always been kept informed at every stage of our trade and other transactions with foreign countries, it said.

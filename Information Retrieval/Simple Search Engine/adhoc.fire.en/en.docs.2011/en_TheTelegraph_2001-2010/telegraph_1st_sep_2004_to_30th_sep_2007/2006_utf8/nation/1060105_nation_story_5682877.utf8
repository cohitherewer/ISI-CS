 Dud heart surgery blot on hospital

 MANJEET SEHGAL WARRIOR

 Shimla, Jan. 4: The states premier medical college has been accused of negligence in each of its first 20 operations that used stents to clear blockages in heart patients arteries.

 All the 20 stents ? tiny tubes inserted into blocked arteries to open them up ? had allegedly passed their expiry date. This means the arteries could get blocked again, as well as infected, and the patient would need another operation to get the stent replaced.

 The scandal was exposed by a Shimla-based medical representative one of whose relatives had heart surgery at the Indira Gandhi Medical College (IGMC) and Hospital, Shimla. He learnt about the goof up by reading a slip in the patients file that mandatorily carried information of the gadgets used in the operation.

 The medical representative then complained to the head of cardiology at the hospital, police sources said.

 By then, the hospital, whose heart surgery unit had opened in November 2005, had used stents from the same batch on 19 others, senior hospital officials said.

 The Delhi-based supplier had pasted a new date-sticker on the stents, a police source said. The original sticker gave the expiry date as February 2005 but the fake one gave a new date: February 2006.

 Even after it came to know of the matter, the hospital took no action against the supplier other than cancelling its supply order.

 But Himachal Pradesh High Court, taking suo motu notice of a newspaper report, on December 30 asked the states principal secretary, health, to probe the allegation. The court gave the government 15 days to file its probe report.

 Under the courts orders, the police have registered a case against the Delhi-based firm and the owner of a local medical store, Manchanda Medicines, which had sold the stents to the hospital.

 Sources said doctors at the hospital would have known about the expiry date having passed, because they are hand-in-glove with the suppliers, who pay them hefty commissions. So far, no cases have been registered against any doctor or hospital official.

 A relative of a heart patient who was operated on last month accused the hospital also of overcharging patients.

 The stents are available for just Rs 25,000 in the market, whereas the IGMC charges Rs 55,000 for one. A mafia is active in the hospital.

 The health secretary and hospital administration could not be contacted.

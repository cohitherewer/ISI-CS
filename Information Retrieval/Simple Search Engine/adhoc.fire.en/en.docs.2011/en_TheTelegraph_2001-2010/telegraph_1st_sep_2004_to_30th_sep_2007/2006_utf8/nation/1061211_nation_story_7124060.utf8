 have all the peacocks gone?

 New Delhi, Dec. 10: Sonia Gandhi loved the bungalow housing the office of the National Advisory Council (NAC) on 3 Motilal Nehru Marg and spent many working hours there as chairperson. 

 Across the road from her house on 10 Janpath, the bigger lawns were a hit not with Sonia alone but also the peacocks who called on her. They always flew in with her, said a staff member. 

 Neither Sonia nor her winged guests have been to the office since she resigned in March because the NAC was deemed an office of profit. 

 As the joint parliamentary committee mandated to come up with a generic and comprehensive definition of an office of profit acceptable to all state legislatures is about to conclude its sittings, there is no sign that Sonia will return to the bungalow on Motilal Nehru Marg. 

 NAC members and staff are not just worried about who will head the council if Sonia does not but also about what will happen to the council after December 31, when its term ends. 

 Once the winter session of Parliament is over, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh will have to take a call on whether the NAC should exist or not. We are keeping our fingers crossed, said D. Swamidhan, a member.

 Meanwhile, the members continue doing what the NAC was tasked to monitor the implementation of the UPAs national common minimum programme and the governments flagship programmes in the social sector. 

 The council takes up one theme every month and asks officials of the ministry concerned to make a presentation on related subjects. In November, the rural development ministry made a presentation on the draft national policy on rehabilitation, a subject said to be close to Sonias heart.

 Sources said they had a problem with the draft because it did not provide for a land for land compensation except where government land was available, and ran contrary to the NACs version of the bill which was seen by Sonia.

 On December 12, the urban development ministry will update the members on the Urban Renewal Mission. 

 The members exchange notes after a presentation and submit their report to the NAC secretary, Arun Bhatnagar, a retired bureaucrat. Bhatnagar and his officials are in constant touch with the ministries over follow-up action. 

 Sources, however, said Sonia is out of the picture and has not asked what the NAC is doing since she stepped down.

 Asked how the officials responded in the absence of a chairperson, Madhav Chavan, a member, said: They are as serious and responsive as they were before. The question is not their seriousness but what happens at the level of implementation by the Centre and the states. 

 The NAC was envisaged as a high-level supervisory body for the UPAs aam admi agenda. If it gets an extension, members expect the council to have a chairperson to initiate new policy guidelines. 

 Unconnected with the NAC, parliamentary affairs minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi announced that in keeping with the Congresss demand to speed up the passage of legislation linked to the common minimum programme, bills on unorganised workers and child protection will be introduced in the budget session.

 Das Munshi will also brief ruling alliance MPs on flagship programmes to facilitate their dissemination at the grassroots.

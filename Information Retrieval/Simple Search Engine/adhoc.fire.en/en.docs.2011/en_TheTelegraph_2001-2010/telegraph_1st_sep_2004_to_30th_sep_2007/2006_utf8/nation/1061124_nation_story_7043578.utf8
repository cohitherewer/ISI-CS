 Law leash on quacks

 New Delhi, Nov. 23: The government has decided to bring in new legislation to punish quacks those practising systems of medicine other than allopathy, ayurveda, siddha, unani, homoeopathy, yoga and naturopathy.

 The government had formed a panel of experts to examine the merits of various forms of alternative medicine. 

 Those practising electropathy, reflexology, hypnotherapy, gems-and-stone therapy and music therapy had also been demanding their forms treatment be included in the bill, but the committee decided not to give them recognition after evaluating each of them.

 The bill will be introduced in the current session of Parliament.

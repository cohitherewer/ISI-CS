 Calcutta, Dec. 25: Peering between the countless heads in front, little Neeta told her mother: I want to know how hungry she is. 

 A few heads away, a father was saying are oito, oi dike taka (there, look that way) to his daughter as she craned her neck for a view of Calcuttas latest if not the hottest holiday must-see and it was not the new cub in the zoo. 

 Hundreds today squeezed in a stop at Mamata Banerjees dais at Esplanade between their Christmas outings at the zoo, the museum, Victoria Memorial or the Maidan.

 Children who would otherwise feel shy to be seen in daddys arms were crying to be lifted up, and like Rahul Munshi, most obliged. 

 The Munshis waited for over half an hour to get anywhere near Mamatas dais. 

 Singur and Mamata Banerjee have been all over the newspapers and television. My daughter had been asking me a lot of questions about it said Rahul, whose next stop would be the planetarium.

 The Trinamul Congress chief had yesterday lamented that she would be left on the street while others enjoyed Christmas. 

 With her blood pressure fluctuating, Mamata did not leave her bed opposite Metro cinema. The fasting leader was a big draw, which made viewing difficult for the younger ones.

 Her health is going downhill. So we thought we should see her, said Prasanta Das, a Kasba resident who was with wife Mitali. 

 As a woman, I am proud of her grit. But she has to live to keep fighting, said Mitali, echoing Jyoti Basu. 

 Is it like a pandal visit during Durga Puja? Soma Nandi, a university student, flared up at the suggestion. Thakur dekhte ashini motei. I feel bad for her as a woman, Soma said.

 But like a Puja pandal, there were frequent announcements over the public address system. Keep moving. Please dont stand in front of the dais. There are a lot of people in the queue, let them see as well.

 Munni Balmiki, who came with a group of women labourers from Budge Budge, said: Itnedin se ek aurat bhukhi, pyasi road mein padi hai, magar kisine unki fariyad nahin suni (A woman has been lying hungry and thirsty on the road for so many days but no ones listening to her complaint). Her companions nodded. 

 We know Buddhababu is concerned about women. He should visit Mamata once, said Shampa Sarkar, Neetas mother, who came from Uttarpara, also in Hooghly.

 There were others too from the district that housed Bengals first car plant Hind Motors and is going to house the second Tata Motors like Asoka Mukherjee of Bhadreswar.

 Like many politicians, harried policemen managing the surge of onlookers want Mamatas fast to end. An officer on duty gestured to show how tiring the day had been. 

 But Deepak Das was on the other side. He had been selling lemon tea at the venue all these days. Sensing a killing, he also stocked cucumbers today.

 And there was Kartick, Mamatas brother. She will be angry at us if we ask her to end her fast, he said.

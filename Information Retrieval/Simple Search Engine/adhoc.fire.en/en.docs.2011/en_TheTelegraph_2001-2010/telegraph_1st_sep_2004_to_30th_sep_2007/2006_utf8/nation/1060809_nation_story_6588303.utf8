 Pet trouble in Orissa Assembly 

 Bhubaneswar (PTI): The Orissa Assembly 

 witnessed unruly scenes on Tuesday over allegations that 

 an Opposition legislator had kept a tiger cub as pet, which 

 is illegal. 

 After treasury bench members made the allegation, Opposition Congress stormed the well, forcing Speaker Maheswar Mohanty to adjourn proceedings for 10 minutes. 

 As the matter was not resolved, Mohanty later adjourned the House for lunch recess. 

 One of the Independent legislators said the Opposition MLA who had kept the tiger cub, released it in the wild near Mundali when wildlife authorities cracked down on people illegally keeping wild animals. The cub was later picked up by wildlife personnel, he said.

 Protest against flight delay

 Kozhikode (PTI): Irked by delay in the 

 departure of an Air-India flight, its passengers said they 

 would not alight at the Karipur international airport near 

 here. 

 The Jeddah-Kozhikode flight, originally scheduled to take off on Sunday, was grounded at the airport there due to a technical snag. It reached Kozhikode at 7.45 am on Tuesday, police said. 

 Passengers said they would not leave the aircraft as Air-India had failed to make adequate arrangements during the delay. They shouted slogans before they finally dispersed. 

 Air-India officials said the delay was inevitable due to some technical problems and all the 240 passengers were accommodated in Jeddah hotels.

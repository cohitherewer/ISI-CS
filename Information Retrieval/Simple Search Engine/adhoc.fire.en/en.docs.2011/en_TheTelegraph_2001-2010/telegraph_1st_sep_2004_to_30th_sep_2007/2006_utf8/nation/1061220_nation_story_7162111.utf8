 Mumbai, Dec. 19: Sanjay Dutt today got his bail extended for two days, but uncertainty loomed over whether he can finally win the battle to stay out of jail on the ground of good conduct.

 Special public prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam was confident of defeating Sanjays appeal for suspension of whatever prison term he gets, and a star criminal lawyer told The Telegraph the actor was too old to get probation.

 Sanjay had surrendered to the anti-terror court this morning on the expiry of his original bail. He arrived in a striped blue shirt and denims, unsure if he would walk out, still a free man, later in the day.

 But he earned a reprieve till Thursday, when his plea for a further bail extension will be heard along with his invocation of the Probation of Offenders Act.

 Under the act, a first-time convict guilty of a minor offence can have his jail term suspended on strength of good behaviour.

 As soon as Sanjays counsel Satish Maneshinde told judge Pramod Kode the actor would claim probation, special public prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam jumped from his seat. We are going to oppose it, he said.

 Outside the court, Nikam told reporters: The nature of his offence and the circumstances are such that he cannot benefit from the act. We can produce the circumstances to prove that.

 Nikam wouldnt say if he would cite the tapes of a purported conversation between Sanjay and gangster Chhota Shakeel, carried out allegedly from a five-star hotel in Shirdi at a time when the actor was on interim bail.

 We will file a detailed reply on Thursday, he said.

 Criminal lawyer Majeed Memon said the act applies only to those under 21, whereas Sanjay is 47.

 The statute of the act, as well as section 360 of the Criminal Procedure Code, specifies that this concession can be given only to a novice offender below 21, he said.

 Through the probation period whose maximum duration can be three years a court-appointed probation officer keeps an eye on the convict. Any misconduct can get him hauled to jail. At the end of the period, if the officer gives a favourable report, the judge can suspend the entire sentence.

 Whatever the decision on probation which applies only after sentencing Sanjays lawyers will on Thursday also fight for a bail extension. If they win, the actor can at least be at large till his sentencing comes up sometime in January.

 Lawyer Farhana Shah told the court Sanjays 18-year-old daughter Trishala, a law student in New York, would arrive in Mumbai on Friday and the actor should be allowed to spend time with her.

 She added that Sanjay was the lone earning member in his family and, since his father Sunil Dutt had not left a will, needed time to settle issues of estate. Besides, he had pending film assignments.

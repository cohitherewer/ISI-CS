 NSCN miffed with Delhi

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 20: At a time when the Manmohan Singh government is keen on finding an amicable solution to the Naga imbroglio, the atmosphere has been vitiated by Union home ministry officials in the run-up to talks for extending the ceasefire beyond July 31. 

 The parleys for extending the ceasefire with the National Socialist Council of Nagalim (Isak-Muivah) are to be held in Bangkok at the end of this month. However, this week, in a meeting to review ceasefire ground rules, harsh words were exchanged between home ministry officials and an NSCN (I-M) delegation. 

 The NSCN (I-M) has accused the armed forces of not showing all the arms and ammunition seized from its activists in the ceasefire period when cases are brought against them in court. The home ministry has taken this to mean that the army is being accused of gun-running. The NSCN (I-M) says it only wants to know where the seized weapons disappear as they are not accounted for legally. 

 The NSCN (I-M) has also demanded that it should be consulted in the appointment of the chairman of the Ceasefire Monitoring Group. Its current chairman, Lt Gen. (retd.) Ramesh V. Kulkarni, is highly respected by them for his fairness. He is disliked by the security forces for the same reason ? they probably expect him to take sides. Gen. Kulkarnis tenure ends on July 31 and there is a move to get a more pliable person. 

 However, the NSCN (I-M) seems most upset with the callous and cavalier attitude of home ministry officials in adjourning the ceasefire ground rules review meeting without completing the agenda. A home ministry source, who did not wish to be identified, explained that senior officials could not spend two or three days at a review meeting. We kept one day for the meeting and then even extended it by another, he said.

 The NSCN (I-M), however, has a different story to tell: The special secretary (home), chairing the meeting, kept walking in and out citing other appointments. On July 18 we began at 11.30 am, but he walked out before lunch for an hour for another appointment. He came back at 2.30 pm but walked away an hour later again, telling us he had another engagement, Brig. Phungthing Shimrang, convenor of the Ceasefire Monitoring Cell of the NSCN (I-M) said.

 The leader of the Naga delegation, Lt Gen. (retd.) V.S. Atem, objected to the meeting being adjourned peremptorily. He pointed out that the meeting was the first since August 2004 and taking place after an express assurance given as a condition for extending the ceasefire in January this year. It was agreed to continue the meeting on July 19. We met at 9.30 am. Once again the special secretary got up at 11.30 saying Thank you gentlemen, that would be all. I have another meeting now, Shimrang said.

 When we objected, we were told that he could meet us only after three months as rules permitted only one meeting every quarter. Who made these rules for these bureaucrats? Is this an indication of Indian seriousness to resolve the Naga issue? he asked.

 The NSCN (I-M) had submitted a seven-point agenda for discussion on July 1. Only three items could be discussed partially, with an exasperated special secretary telling them that either he could devote 30 minutes to each item or they could focus on only one item. 

 If he is so busy, then why were we invited to Delhi? We have respected the ceasefire for nine years. If there are problems in the ceasefire, then the Indian officials must have the patience to thrash them out. What is the point in saying that they are busy with the Mumbai blasts? Is the Northeast not important or do they think nothing can happen there to focus their attention on it? Shimrang asked.

 Rahul caveat on mapping

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, July 21: Rahul Mahajan, who faces various charges under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, today filed a caveat in the Supreme Court to prevent any attempt by police to secure in his absence an order for his brain mapping.

 With Delhi High Court staying 

 the brain mapping test, the police could move the Supreme 

 Court against the interim order. But in view of the caveat, 

 the apex court cannot pass any order without hearing Rahul.

 The high court had yesterday stayed a June 29 trial court order allowing a brain mapping test in the case. The interim stay came on a plea by Rahul challenging the trial court order. 

 The stay would operate till the high court takes up the matter for further hearing on August 18.

 Rahul has contended that forcing him to undergo a brain mapping test would be violative of his right to privacy and to life and personal liberty.

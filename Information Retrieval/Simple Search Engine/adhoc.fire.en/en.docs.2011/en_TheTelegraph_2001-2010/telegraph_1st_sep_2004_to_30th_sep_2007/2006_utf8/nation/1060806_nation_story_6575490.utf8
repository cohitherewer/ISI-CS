 Singh sets terms for Left nuclear inputs

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Manmohan Singh

 New Delhi, Aug. 5: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is expected to address the concerns of the Left on the Indo-US nuclear deal on Thursday.

 Sources said he is likely to give a categorical assurance in the Rajya Sabha that there will be no compromise on the strategic programme and India will not accept any fresh conditions for implementing the July 2005 pact.

 The Left parties have given notices in the upper House for a short-duration discussion under Rule 176, which does not involve moving a formal motion or voting. 

 Sources said Singh, through defence minister Pranab Mukherjee, had sought the Lefts inputs for his reply to the discussion. They said the Lefts stance was that it would draft his reply. 

 But the PM took a principled position. He said as long as the Left was part of any joint enterprise with the BJP and the NDA, forget drafting his statement, he would be loath to take their inputs. He was clear that as long as the Left negotiated independently, he would reciprocate, a source said.

 CPM MP Sitaram Yechury was part of a joint front with the BJP, Janata Dal (United) and the Samajwadi Party which demanded a parliamentary resolution on the deal. 

 Sources said the government is expected to get the Lefts inputs by tomorrow. 

 Apart from the finer technical and scientific details, the sources said the broad framework of Singhs reply would be: I cannot dictate to the US Senate what we expect of them. I can confirm I am committed to what I have stated earlier in Parliament. The actual and final agreement will have to await the Senates ratification. We will cross-check and if there are departures, we will react appropriately.

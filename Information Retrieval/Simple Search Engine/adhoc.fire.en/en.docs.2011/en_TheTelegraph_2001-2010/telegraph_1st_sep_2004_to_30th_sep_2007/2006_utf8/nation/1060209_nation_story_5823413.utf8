 Wife told to support husband who quit job 

 M.R. VENKATESH 

 Chennai, Feb. 8: A Madurai court has ordered a state government employee to pay maintenance to her estranged husband.

 In an interim order yesterday, Judge Prakasan of the third assistant sub-court in Madurai directed the woman (name withheld on request of the court) to pay Chinnasamy Rs 1,000 every month, pending the disposal of their civil suit, sources said.

 The order, which came in a town where goddess Meenakshi is the reigning deity, could have far-reaching legal and sociological implications.

 Chinnasamy, who was working as a constable in the Central Reserve Police Force in north India, quit his job a few years ago to stay with his wife, a revenue inspector in Usilampatti near Madurai.

 However, the marriage turned sour soon after and the woman filed for divorce in 2001 at the Madurai court. 

 As the divorce petition was being heard, Chinnasamy sought maintenance of Rs 3,000 a month, saying he was unemployed and had no money to even pay for the court proceedings. He said he had left his job and returned home at his wifes request. 

 Chinnasamy, who sought an additional Rs 2,000 for legal costs, produced letters in court that his estranged wife had written some years ago, persuading him to quit his job, sources said.

 The woman told the judge she could not afford to pay such a high maintenance amount. He then directed her to pay Rs 1,000 a month as interim maintenance. 

 When reporters in Madurai tried to get the womans reaction to the court order, she walked away in a huff. She is expected to appeal against the ruling in a higher court. 

 Nanmaran, a senior lawyer in Chennai, said the instance of a woman being asked to pay interim maintenance to her estranged husband was not unusual.

 Under Sections 24 and 25 of the Hindu Marriages Act, there is a provision for a woman to pay her husband for divorce proceedings and an interim maintenance during the proceedings, as the court may seem reasonable, if the husband has no independent income, the lawyer said.

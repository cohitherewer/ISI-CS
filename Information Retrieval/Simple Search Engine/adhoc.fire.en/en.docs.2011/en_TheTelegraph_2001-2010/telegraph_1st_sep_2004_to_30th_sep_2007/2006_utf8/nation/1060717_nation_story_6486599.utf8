 Blog samaritans keep city connected in crisis

 SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI

 Bridging the gap

 Mumbai, July 16: Technology can be a two-edged weapon.

 Smart use of technology, say investigators, is making it difficult to trace those who carried out the July 11 blasts. Yet, technology was the biggest comfort for the city that evening. 

 As mobiles jammed and landlines collapsed, the Internet became the only medium to get connected. Bloggers took it upon themselves to connect not just a city in crisis, but also people to their friends and families across the globe.

 I and my friends were uploading posts after posts on our blogs, talking about personal experiences, real life scenarios, helpline numbers, just about anything. The bottomline was to share information, said Shahid Doshi, a blogger with rediff.com. 

 The biggest challenge was to provide information to people on the whereabouts of those who could have been on the blast-hit trains. 

 Mumbaihelp.blogspot.com provided information on the dead and injured, names and numbers of hospitals, traffic advisories, and offers of blood donation and temporary accommodation for stranded passengers. Contributors to the blog also helped people get in touch over phone with relatives. 

 The mumbai.metblogs.com put up detailed lists of the injured and the dead along with photographs and contact details of the missing people.

 I dont know how to thank these people. It was such a relief not to see my brothers name on that list when I was stranded on the road with a jammed mobile and inactive PCOs all around. Even the policemen on the streets did not have many answers, said Namita, a call centre employee who had gone to Dadar market on her day off.

 I was supposed to meet my brother at Matunga station around the time the bomb went off on a train there. Unable to figure out anything, I just went to a cybercafe to check the television news sites, but decided to check the blogspots, she said.

 Namitas parents, who stay in Pune, too logged on to the blog sites to get details of the blasts, she said. 

 Amit Verma, mumbaihelp blogger, said that in the first two hours after the blasts, the sites blogspot got over 50,000 hits.

 Peter Griffin, founder of the site, said that the next day, there were at least 29,000 visitors logging in.

 Many metblogs.com members, including myself, visited the blast sites, police stations, hospitals and morgues personally to collect the correct information. We wanted to put forth a resource database. In that sense, the bloggers were ahead of mediapersons in many ways, said Santhosh Wilson of metblogs.

 Some blogspots such as indiauncut.blogspot.com also provided links to others who were displaying information on the blasts.

 There were others who called local numbers or visited homes to pass on information about people to their families.

 Suman Arora, a graphic artist with an advertising agency, said her Canada-based extended family reached her through a blogger.

 They gave her our numbers and address and Aaron DSouza, a blogger from Bandra, got in touch with us. Apparently, he stays just a few streets away and came knocking. Just imagine, a complete stranger and he was there to extend a helping hand, said Suman.

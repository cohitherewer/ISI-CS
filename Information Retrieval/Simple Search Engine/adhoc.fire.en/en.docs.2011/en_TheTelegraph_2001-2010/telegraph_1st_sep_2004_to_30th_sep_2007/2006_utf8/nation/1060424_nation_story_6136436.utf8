 Delhi dams dispute, barely

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 23: Indias move to change the design of the controversial Kishenganga hydro-electric power project in Jammu and Kashmir might only partially resolve its long-standing dispute with Pakistan.

 The Union cabinet last week decided to scrap the plan to build a reservoir that would have blocked 20 million cubic metres of water from the Kishenganga from flowing into Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. Pakistan had objected to the reservoir saying it would violate the Indus Water Treaty. However, that is only one part of the objection.

 Delhi has not addressed Islamabads concerns about the diversion of water from the Kishenganga, known as Neelum across the border, to the Madhumati rivulet where the 300 mw hydro-electric power station will come up. Pakistan claims that the diversion will affect the flow of the river, which joins Jhelum at Domail near Muzaffarabad after crossing the Line of Control.

 Allaying Pakistans apprehensions, India has said the diversion would not have any impact on the irrigation facilities in the Neelum valley that lies across the LoC. Officials said a part of Kishenganga will flow into Madhumati to reach Wular Lake but the other part will remain on course, leaving enough water for the Neelum valley. Moreover, they pointed out, there was not much potential for agriculture in the valley.

 For the moment, the plan to give up construction of the reservoir has brought more cheer to the Indian side, as it will save 12 villages in the scenic Gurez valley in Baramullah from submerging.

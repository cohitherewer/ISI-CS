 Emission chips on the table 

 SEETHA

 Stern

 New Delhi, Dec. 5: India is not in favour of scaling down its poverty-alleviation and growth ambitions to contribute to carbon-emission reduction, and the burden of mitigation has to be borne by the rich countries.

 That is the message Nicholas Stern, author of the Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change, appeared to have got in two days of interactions he had with Indian policy makers yesterday and today.

 Stern, in Delhi for a series of seminars and meetings to discuss the report, said at a limited media interaction that he fully agreed with and understood the Indian position.

 Awareness of the need to take preventive action on climate change and global warming within the Indian policy making establishment is increasing and India is already doing a lot of work in this direction, he said.

 He commended the Planning Commissions focus on an integrated energy policy and its emphasis in the approach to the Eleventh Plan.

 But India needed to take further action to improve energy efficiency. It is well known, Stern said, that the Indian power sector is not as efficient as it should be.

 Energy security by moving towards renewables and nuclear power is in the interest of all nations, he said. 

 Stern had a meeting with R.K. Pachauri, the chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and is slated to meet Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and the secretary of the ministry of environment and forests tomorrow.

 He had interacted with Planning Commission officials, such as deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia and member Kirit Parikh, yesterday.

 The Stern Review warns that a continued business-as-usual approach to energy consumption and use would have serious consequences for global warming and climate change and could shave as much as 5 per cent off the global gross domestic product. 

 Early and urgent action needs to be taken to stabilise carbon emission levels at or below 550 parts per million (ppm). By 2050, the report says, global emissions would need to be around 25 per cent of current levels.

 Stern said there was no contradiction between environment-friendly development and economic growth. Ambitions for growth and poverty reduction need not be sacrificed for environmentally sustainable development, he pointed out. It is quite possible to continue the growth story by doing energy activity in different ways. There is a close relationship between environment and growth. 

 Development, he said, is good for adaptation, but adaptation is crucial for development. Stern also backed the Indian position that rich countries have to bear a majority of the burden of financing efforts to reduce emissions.

 Carbon taxing and trading will be a crucial part of the story as will cooperation between developed and developing countries on technology development and sharing. At the same time, he did not feel that this would foster a dependence of the poor countries on the richer ones.

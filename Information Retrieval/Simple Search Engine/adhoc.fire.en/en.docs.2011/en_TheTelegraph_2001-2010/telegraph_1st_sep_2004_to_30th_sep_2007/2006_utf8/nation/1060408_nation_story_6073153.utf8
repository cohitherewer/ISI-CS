 Heads of two officials roll 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, 

 April 7: The clashes sparked by a bunch of electrical 

 wires refused to die down in Aligarh today, prompting the 

 government to boot out top district officials and clamp 

 down on two BJP leaders.

 City superintendent of police S.K. Verma and additional district magistrate Satya Bhan were suspended for negligence as the Ram Navami violence spread to new areas on its third day and two more deaths raised the toll to six.

 District magistrate R.K. Singh, senior superintendent of police Ajay Anand and city circle officer M.P. Singh were transferred.

 The Samajwadi Party government took the BJP head on, detaining former Aligarh MLA K.K. Navman for alleged incitement and blocking Lalji Tandons way to the clash-hit university town.

 Tandon, the leader of Opposition in the Assembly, was whisked off the railway platform as his train arrived in Kanpur and sent back to Lucknow after a few hours at the circuit house.

 As the BJP protested, the new administration launched a search-and-arrest operation in Aligarh, rounding up over 100 people by evening. 

 The police showed off their impartiality: the arrested include people from both communities.

 The clashes began on Wednesday after some people tore the Ram Navami lighting off a makeshift temple, alleging that the connections ran through the premises of a neighbouring mosque.

 Gun battles left four dead and 13 injured yesterday, with six battling for life.The discovery of two more bodies today stoked the flames.

 Mobs set homes and cars on fire in Bhujpura after a man was found stabbed to death on a street. Stray skirmishes continued in some areas already under curfew.

 With the CRPF, Rapid Action Force and Provincial Armed Constabulary joining the district police in patrolling the streets, the Friday prayers passed peacefully.

 The Aligarh Muslim University cancelled examinations and all schools and colleges were shut till further orders.

 The Centre, which sent minister of state for home Sriprakash Jaiswal to the town, and the state showered ex gratia. Every bereaved family is to get Rs 7.5 lakh and each injured Rs 1 lakh or Rs 1.5 lakh depending on the severity of the wound.

 The BJP demanded Presidents rule, blaming the clashes ? the third in Uttar Pradesh since October ? on minority appeasement policies of the Centre and the state government.

 Both (governments) have been encouraging intolerance in some particular communities, party spokesman Prakash Javadekar told reporters.

 In October 2005, communal clashes killed 10 people and injured about 100 in Mau, a town in eastern Uttar Pradesh. 

 Last month, four were killed in Lucknow.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Family fights spill out at BJP conclave

 POORNIMA JOSHI

 Joshi: Fuming

 Dehra Dun, Sept. 9: An ominous prophecy about the BJPs crucial national executive meeting seems to have come true with all the internal bickering in the party spilling out in the open in the last three days.

 It started with the BJP MP from Tihri, Raja Manvendra Shah, writing an open letter to all party leaders warning them against starting the national executive on September 7. I told them it was partial lunar eclipse and the beginning of the shradh season, all ominous signs, a very bad time to start planning for the future, Shah said. 

 His words rang true when senior party leader Murli Manohar Joshi left the meeting in a huff on the very first day. 

 It later transpired that Joshi was bitter about the reluctance on party president Rajnath Singhs part to involve him in discussing any real issue confronting the party. 

 The former HRD minister felt left out and insulted as he was not extended the courtesy of an invitation to the partys customary public rally in the middle of the national executive meet where all senior leaders Atal Bihari Vajpayee, L.K. Advani and Rajnath were to participate. 

 The Joshi camp described this as particularly distasteful and insulting because Dehra Dun is home ground for Joshi, the BJP leader being a Brahmin from these hills. 

 None of the important issues are being discussed. The mole controversy was not even mentioned even though the issue hurt the image of the party for almost half of the monsoon session. Rajnath is allowing himself to be manipulated by Advani. The political resolution, in the form of the presidents speech, had absolutely no vision for the future, said a source.

 While Joshi left for Delhi, differences between Advani and Arun Jaitley came to the fore. Jaitley has been openly critical of the BJPs handling of the monsoon session, mainly regarding two crucial issues the Pathak committee report on the Iraq oil-for-food scam and the Indo-US nuclear deal. 

 The criticism is widely being perceived as an attack on Advani as he is leader of Opposition and so in charge of strategising during Parliament sessions.

 On the nuclear deal, Jaitley is known to have clashed with Yashwant Sinha in a parliamentary party meeting. 

 Jaitleys view reportedly was that the BJP should never have hobnobbed with the Left, which is what Sinha did to formulate the sense of the House on the nuclear deal.

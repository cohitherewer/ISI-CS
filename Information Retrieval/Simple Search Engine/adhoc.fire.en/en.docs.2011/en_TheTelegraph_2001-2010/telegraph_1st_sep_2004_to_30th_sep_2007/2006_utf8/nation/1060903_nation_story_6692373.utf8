 Channel price protest

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 2: Television companies could mount a legal challenge to the five-rupee ceiling fixed by the broadcast regulator for each pay channel under the conditional access system.

 We are considering challenging that and we will decide very quickly, STAR Group-India chief executive Peter Mukerjea said after a two-and-a-half-hour meeting of the Indian Broadcasting Foundation.

 Mukerjea and others who attended the meeting, however, made it clear they discussed other options, too. We are reviewing what our options are, Discovery channels Deepak Shourie said.

 The broadcasters will seek legal opinion on the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) order that laid down the ceiling on Thursday. They are also considering talking to Trai and approaching the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal for a review of the order.

 The broadcasters may also seek a meeting with information and broadcasting minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, Mukerjea said.

 The Trai order says that under CAS, households would pay no more than Rs 5 a month for each pay channel to which they subscribe, plus taxes. In addition, if they choose not to buy but rent a set-top box, they would have to pay rental and a security deposit.

 The deadline for CAS to come to select parts of Delhi, Calcutta and Mumbai is December 31. The system is already in operation in Chennai.

 Under Trais rate regime, a subscriber who wants to watch 20 pay channels and all free-to-air ones can expect to pay less than Rs 250 a month. In non-CAS areas, the earlier charges remain.

 Trai was authorised to fix the charges by the government after the broadcasters failed to come up with a rate structure for CAS. But the broadcasters say there should be no Trai fiat at all on tariffs. Why would you put a price on a television channel? Mukerjea said. It doesnt make any sense.

 Trai argues that consumers shouldnt end up paying high cable television bills under CAS: the new system will not take off if it turns out to be too expensive.

 Discovery, however, says market forces would sort this out: the consumer will decide whether he prefers CAS or a different system, such as direct-to-home (DTH).

 Todays meeting was scheduled to discuss another contentious issue the proposed broadcast bill but the tariff order dominated proceedings.

 Misunderstood Katiyar is sorry

New Delhi/Jammu (PTI): Hours after being booked 

for inciting communal passions in Kashmir by offering rewards of Rs 1 lakh each 

for any civilian killing a militant, BJP leader Vinay Katiyar has offered to apologise.

A reward of Rs 2 lakh for a civilians family 

in case he dies fighting militants was also reportedly announced at a BJP programme 

in Jammu on Thursday to protest last months killing of Hindus in Doda and 

Udhampur.

 With Jammu and Kashmir police registering an FIR charging BJP general secretary Katiyar and vice-president Sahib Singh Verma on Saturday and the party leadership asking him to clarify his remarks, Katiyar denied making the monetary offer. 

 My comments have been misunderstood which I regret. I only offered party support to village defence committees in the event of police, the army or the state government identifying people killed by them as terrorists. There was no money fixed for such support, he said.

 Katiyar also insisted that he had no intention to incite religious hatred. 

 Verma, however, did not apologise.

 Zahira to file tax returns

Mumbai (PTI): The prime witness in the Best 

Bakery case, Zahira Sheikh, will file returns for the assessment year 2003-04 

within a fortnight in response to the income-tax departments notices, her 

lawyer has said.

After filing the returns, she would urge the department 

to revoke their order provisionally attaching her properties, counsel Umesh Deshpande 

said on Saturday.

 Zahiras total assets are worth less than Rs 1 lakh and she does not own any flat in Mumbai or plots in Vadodara as claimed by income-tax authorities, he said. 

 Hence, Zahira is not required to file returns but in keeping with the income-tax departments directives, she would file returns within a fortnight, he added.

BBC to bring key Fifa World Cup matches live to listeners in India.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 8: The air force is expanding its set-up for disaster management by adding a fleet of communication vehicles that can be airlifted to trouble zones. 

 The vehicles will be equipped with high frequency, very high frequency and Inmarsat phones and will be flown by AN-32 transport aircraft and Mi-17 multi-utility helicopters.

 The chief of the Air Force Communication Centre, Group Captain S.C. Luthra, said an experiment with two utility vehicles was successful just after the tsunami in December 2004. The Disaster Management Communication (DMC) vehicles were the first to reach Car Nicobar in the Andamans on a helicopter.

 Two DMC vehicles are now stationed at the air headquarters in Delhi. The Air Force Communication Centre is in charge of all the communication networks at the IAF headquarters. 

 DMC vehicles will now be stationed at all IAF commands across the country.

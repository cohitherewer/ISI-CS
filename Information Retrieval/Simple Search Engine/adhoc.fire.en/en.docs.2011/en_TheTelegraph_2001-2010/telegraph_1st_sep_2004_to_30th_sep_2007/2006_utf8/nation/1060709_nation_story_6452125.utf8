 Venugopal: Boost from court

 New Delhi, July 7: Health minister Anbumani Ramadoss was left red in the face today when Delhi High Court stayed the process initiated by him to sack AIIMS director P. Venugopal.

 Justice Anil Kumar also issued a notice to the Election Commission on a plea by the cardiac surgeon seeking Ramadosss disqualification from Parliament on the ground that he was holding an office of profit as president of AIIMS. 

 The judge directed the Centre and the governing body of AIIMS, which had passed a resolution on Wednesday recommending Venugopals removal, to file their replies to his petition within two weeks. The surgeon has contended that the resolution was unconstitutional and contrary to the principles of law laid down by the Supreme Court.

 The interim order, passed after hearing extensive arguments from both sides, is a victory for Venugopal as such protection is generally granted only if the court is convinced that the petitioner has a prima facie case and not ordering status quo would cause irreparable injury to their rights.

 The government has the option to seek review of the order passed by Justice Kumar by a larger bench of the high court.

 Former law minister and BJP leader Arun Jaitley, who appeared on behalf of Venugopal, contended that the AIIMS director enjoyed a fixed term and could not be removed prematurely unless there were justifiable grounds. 

 When additional solicitor-general Gopal Subramaniam, who appeared for the government, argued that the director had violated service rules by criticising the government in public, Jaitley said the governing body did not have any material to support the allegation. Criticising a minister did not amount to misconduct, he added. Venugopal had gone to the media against Ramadoss.

 The government, which had yesterday offered to withdraw the sack resolution if Venugopal agreed to resign, told the court the offer had been made even before the resolution was passed. 

 Subramaniam said the government had asked the director to step down and only when he refused to do so was a decision taken to terminate his services.

 Venugopals five-year tenure ends on July 2, 2008.

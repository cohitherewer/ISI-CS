 Visa slap? Not again

 Modi: Once bitten, twice shy

 Ahmedabad, April 25: Once bitten Narendra Modi is twice shy to apply for a US visa.

 The Gujarat chief minister has been invited for a Gujarati convention in New Jersey in July, but is reluctant to apply for a visa for fear that he might be denied entry again.

 Last year, the US had kept him out citing a domestic backlash against the 2002 Gujarat riots. Modi had then been forced to cancel his address to the Asian-American Hotel Owners Association in Florida and a public meeting in New York.

 Sources in the chief ministers office said Modi was keen to attend the first-ever convention organised by the Gujarati Association of North America, but unless he was assured his application would be considered favourably, he would not risk a slap in the face again.

 The organisers of the July 7-9 convention, however, said US visa authorities had been non-committal about the whole affair.

 Sudhir Parekh, chairman of the National Organisation of Indian Associations in the US, told Modi last week inquiries at the state department met with the stock response that said nothing could be said till a fresh application was made.

 The convention organisers are believed to be making another attempt at convincing the US authorities that denying Modi entry again because of the 2002 riots would be an over-reaction.

 Union textile minister and Modis bitter rival Shankersinh Vaghela will be attending the convention.

 Last year, Modi had organised a swabhimaan rally to protest the US decision. His political mentor L.K. Advani had then said: So far, Modi was a symbol of Gujarati pride and self-respect. But now his name has become synonymous with the countrys self-respect.

 Shiv Sena leader Manohar Joshi had said all US consulates in India should be shut down in retaliation. He had also urged Modi never to go to the US again.

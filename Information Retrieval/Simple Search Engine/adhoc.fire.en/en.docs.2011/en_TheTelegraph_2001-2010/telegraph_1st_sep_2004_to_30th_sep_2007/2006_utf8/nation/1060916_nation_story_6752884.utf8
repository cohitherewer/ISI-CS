 Raze jolt to Jaya

 RASHEED KIDWAI 

 Jaya Bachchan: Illegal glare

 Bhopal, Sept. 15: The Congress-ruled Bhopal Municipal Corporation has razed a structure Jaya Bachchan had built in open space in front of her ground-floor flat in Ansal Apartment here.

 An angry woman came out of Jayas house shouting when the operation got under way last evening: Why are you targeting us when the city has so many illegal buildings?

 It was not correct, however, that the corporation was targeting Jaya alone. Twenty-four illegal boundary walls were razed in the presence of top corporation officials who went to work after Madhya Pradesh High Court dismissed a plea by Jaya and others seeking an injunction against the move to tear down the boundary walls and sheds.

 Jayas neighbour Rajesh Nagu claimed he and others had moved the Supreme Court against the corporation order. Our petition has been admitted and is coming up for hearing, Nagu said. 

 Many residents were happy that the authorities were acting against well-known people. But the incident could raise a political storm since the Bachchan familys differences with Sonia Gandhi are no secret. The Samajwadi Party, which Jaya represents in the Rajya Sabha, could pounce on the decision to claim she was being victimised by the Congress because of Sonia.

 When Jaya lost her MPs position because she was holding an office of profit, the party had voiced this allegation, turning it into an issue. She returned to the Rajya Sabha after being elected again.

 The Ansal Apartment flat figures on the list of properties Jaya had submitted in her affidavit to the Election Commission. Her mother and sister occupy the flat. The actress had spent her childhood in Bhopal, where her father Taroon Bhaduri used to work as a journalist and writer, though not in this flat.

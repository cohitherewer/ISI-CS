 Sonia cement for TN team

 Sonia: Alliance booster

 New Delhi, Feb. 15: Vaiko is set to walk out of the Democratic Progressive Alliance, but ties between two other partners in the group were cemented today when Sonia Gandhi named M. Krishnaswamy the president of the Congresss Tamil Nadu unit.

 Krishnaswamy is the father-in-law of Anbumani Ramadoss, Union health minister and son of the Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK) chief S. Ramadoss. 

 Both the Congress and the PMK are allies in the DMK-led front, as is MDMK chief Vaiko, who is now threatening to switch sides and join hands with Jayalalithaa.

 If the DMK fears the family ties will increase the Congress-PMKs bargaining power for seats in the Assembly elections, Congress sources said this was not their objective. 

 Krishnaswamy belongs to the influential Vanniyar community, which dominates northern Tamil Nadu, and his anointment was meant to neutralise the negative fallout of another move the party is about to make, a source said. 

 The Congress plans to expel Thindivanam K. Ramamurthy, a former state unit chief who is also a Vanniyar, for allegedly hobnobbing with Jayalalithaa. 

 The PMK, a Vanniyar-centric party, had expressed the fear that Ramamurthys exit could help the ADMK in the northern districts where it now has a small presence. Hence, there was no choice but to bring in Krishnaswamy, the sources explained.

 But politics and family have never been too far apart in Tamil Nadu. Karthi Chidambaram, the son of Union finance minister P. Chidambaram, is the frontrunner in the race to replace Krishnaswamys son Vishnu Prasad as head of the state youth Congress. 

 Karthi and DMK chief M. Karunanidhis daughter Kanimozhi had taken up cudgels on behalf of filmstar Kushboo, under attack for speaking out about pre-marital sex. Kanimozhi, who writes feminist poetry, has launched a website called Karuta (views) with Karthi to challenge the anti-Kushboo campaign. 

 However, Karthi has competition in Manik Tagore, a state general secretary. He is the nephew of Rajya Sabha MP Sudarshan Nachiappan, who defeated Chidambaram (then in the Tamil Maanila Congress) in 1999. 

 Nachiappan was persuaded to give up his seat for the finance minister in the last Lok Sabha poll, which he is believed to have resented. 

 Even if Tagore is pipped to the post by Karthi, the sources said he might be given an Assembly seat. 

 The sons of central minister E.V.K.S. Elangovan and Krishnaswamy are also in the race.

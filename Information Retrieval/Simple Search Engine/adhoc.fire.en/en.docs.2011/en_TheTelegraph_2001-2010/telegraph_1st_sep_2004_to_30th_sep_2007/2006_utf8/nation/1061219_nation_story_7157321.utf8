 Dutt to plead good conduct

 Mumbai, Dec. 18: Sanjay Dutt today indicated that when the time comes to argue the quantum of his sentence, he would seek to avoid jail on the ground of good conduct.

 In an application before the anti-terror court where he is to surrender tomorrow, the actor hinted he would invoke the Probation of Offenders Act.

 Under the act, a first-time convict whose offence is not too serious can get his jail term suspended for a probation period if he can convince the judge his behaviour inside and outside court has been good.

 The court, if it accepts the probation plea, designates a probation officer to whom the convict must periodically report.

 If, at any point during the probation period, this officer finds the offender guilty of any misconduct, the court may cancel the probation on a report from him and send the convict to jail.

 Sanjays application urged the Tada court not to take him into custody but extend his bail which expires tomorrow because he is likely to later plead for his release on probation.

 The actor had on November 28 been convicted under the Arms Act for possessing an AK-56 rifle and a 9mm pistol, but was allowed bail for three weeks.

 Other than the probation argument, his application cited all the three reasons that had helped him get bail on the day of conviction.

 The 47-year-old said he had to look after his 18-year-old daughter Trishala, expected in Mumbai for Christmas after her college in New York closes on December 22.

 Two, several of his film shoots were incomplete. Three, he needed more time to settle matters related to his father Sunil Dutts estate.

 The court has so far heard arguments on the sentencing of 36 of the 100 convicts in the 1993 Bombay blasts case. Sanjays turn is likely to come only after the Christmas vacation, possibly in early January.

 This means that if the court refuses to extend his bail, he will have to spend several days in jail till he can try his luck with the probation plea.

 In our application we have cited this point (probation act), as we would like to take it up when the matter comes up for hearing on the quantum of sentence, Sanjays lawyer Farhana Shah said.

 Sanjay, however, seems likely to stay behind bars for at least two days after he surrenders before special judge Pramod Kode tomorrow morning: the decision on his bail extension may not come until Thursday.

 Six other accused had been granted time to surrender on various grounds, and they too have appealed for extension. The prosecution today told the court it would like to make a common reply to all the petitions, and the judge posted the matter for hearing on December 21.

 These six convicts are: customs collector Somnath Thapa, Mobina Bhiwandiwala, Zaibunnisa Kazi and Sanjays friends Yusuf Nullwala, Kersi Adajania and Russi Mulla.

 If Sanjay gets a short jail term and a probation, he might be able to stay free altogether if his conduct stays good, whether or not he appeals the sentence in the Supreme Court and gets a stay and later an acquittal.

 The actor has lined up a battery of lawyers for Thursdays arguments, including senior counsel V.R. Manohar, known for his acumen on complex legal points. Assisting him would be Satish Maneshinde, Farhana Shah and Karan Singh.

 A nervous Sanjay has been performing rituals and offering prayers at various shrines to try and avoid another stint at the Arthur Road jail.

 Last week, he prayed at the Mahim dargah on the last day of the Urs festival. On Sunday, he performed a yagna at the Sidhivinayak temple.

 The Bollywood star also visited the childrens ward last week at Wadia hospital to spend time with terminally ill patients. 

 Yesterday, he met teenage drug addicts at a home in Vakola.

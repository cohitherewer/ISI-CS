 New life for doctor rural duty 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Sept. 22: A 

 controversial proposal to make one-year rural service mandatory 

 for doctors in India before they get permanent registration 

 has resurfaced from a health ministry task force.

 The proposal had elicited scepticism in the past not only because city-bred students may not want to go to villages, but because the existing medical education system doesnt train doctors for villages. 

 The health ministry is now examining the proposal under which Indias 28,000-odd students who graduate from both public and private colleges each year will get their permanent registration only after they have served in a rural area for one year after their internship, health minister Anbumani Ramadoss said.

 They will be expected to render medical services in rural areas on the basis of temporary registration, Ramadoss said after a meeting of the National Rural Health Mission steering group. The mission is aimed at upgrading rural healthcare through several new initiatives, including adding doctors in Indias 3,220 community health clinics. 

 Each community health clinic should have one paediatrician, one gynaecologist and one anaesthetist among other staff. Only 981 clinics meet these criteria today, a senior health official said. 

 A task force under the mission had revived the proposal that has been circulating in policy-making circles for many years but was never implemented. Even today, health officials said they would not be able to specify when and how the proposal would translate into educational rules. 

 Senior medical faculty warned that mandatory rural posting would not work as the education system does not prepare doctors for rural areas. 

 Doctors today wont open up an abdomen without an ultrasound, said a senior doctor. Earlier, the surgical procedure would begin after a quick examination with our hands. 

 Plucking graduates from a city and forcing them into rural India wont work. Wheres their commitment? Many will see this as just one more thing they have to do, said a faculty member of a medical institute. 

 Instead, some health experts are veering towards an alternative strategy providing special training to doctors already working in rural areas to equip them with multiple skills. 

 We do have doctors in rural areas many of them MBBS graduates. The idea is to retrain them to handle obstetric emergencies, deliver anaesthesia and handle some surgical procedures, a health ministry official said. 

 Doctors who are already practising in rural areas would have the motivation and commitment to pick up these new skills and deliver services to local people, said a medical faculty member.

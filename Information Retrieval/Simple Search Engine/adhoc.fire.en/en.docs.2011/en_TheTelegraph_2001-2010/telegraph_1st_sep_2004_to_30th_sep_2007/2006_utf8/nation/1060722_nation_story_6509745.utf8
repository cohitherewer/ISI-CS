 Left to block pension bill 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 21: The CPM will vote against the pension bill if the government introduces it in the monsoon session of Parliament.

 Our position on the bill remains the same, CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury said on the eve of the UPA-Left coordination committee meeting. 

 The Centre is planning to bring the pension fund regulatory development authority bill in the coming session although the Left has said it will support it only if the government accepts two key amendments. 

 Both strike at the core of the bill, which essentially aims to privatise the pension fund.

 We are opposed to handing over the pension fund to private managers. It can be managed by public sector managers. We are also opposed to investing the pension fund in the stock market, Yechury said. 

 The government till now has been inflexible on both the amendments. 

 We will support the bill only if the government supports them, the CPM leader said.

 The UPA-Left coordination committee does not have a defined agenda for tomorrows meeting. 

 We have given them a note explaining our objections to some of the governments policies. The reply has not come yet, Yechury said. We expect tomorrows meeting to focus on broad policy matters which are likely to come up in Parliament.

 The UPA government anticipates trouble in the monsoon session not only from the BJP, the main Opposition party, but also its allies in the Left Front. The leadership will try to neutralise some of the tension that has been brewing at tomorrows meeting, which will be attended by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi. 

 The Left has been cut up with the Centres economic and foreign policies. The DMKs intervention staved off the divestment from Neyveli Lignite Corporation and Nalco but there is more trouble on the economic front. On the governments proposal to restructure the banking sector, Yechury said: Our main concern is that the foreign banks should not take over Indian banks. 

 The government is also planning to raise the cap on the shareholding of a foreign bank in an Indian bank. We do not want it, said the politburo member.

 One of the major issues of contention between the allies is the governments foreign policy and the Prime Ministers soft attitude towards the Bush administration. We will raise the foreign policy issue in Parliament, Yechury said. 

 There is a possibility that the Rajya Sabha may bring a resolution demanding a discussion on the Indo-US nuclear deal.

 The Prime Minister had given an assurance in both Houses of Parliament that Indias national interest will not be compromised, Yechury said. 

 The Left had earlier warned that the nuclear deal would compromise Indias foreign policy.

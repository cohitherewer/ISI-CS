 Fax speaks of drugged rape

 OUR BUREAU AND AGENCIES

April 19: After tracing a booth in Agra from 

where a Japanese tourist faxed a complaint of rape to Pushkar, police are trying 

to track down the alleged victim.

 The police have identified the booth in Agra from where the complaint was faxed, said Agra IG Rizwan Ahmed. We have sent messages requesting all hotel owners that if any tourist by her name was staying (in their hotels), she should cooperate with the police in bringing justice to her.

 A case has been registered and the Japanese embassy in Delhi informed about the complaint. No arrests have been made yet.

 A police team from Rajasthan, known for rapid judgments in rape cases, has also reached Agra.

 Ahmed said the booth operator who helped her fax the complaint found the woman badly shaken. She looked disturbed. She said she was in trouble and faxing the message was important, the operator was quoted as saying.

 According to the PCO owner, the tourist had been staying in an Agra hotel for some time but did not say where.

 Ahmed said the woman reached Pushkar on April 1. In the pilgrim town, she met two youths identified as Sanjay Raja and Shahid. The two had promised me to find out for me a good guesthouse and took me to Hotel Quiet Palace. There I met Babloo, son of the hotel owner and hotels manager. He asked me to deposit my money, too. He said he would keep the money in safe custody with his mother Roshni. I agreed and handed over Rs 54,000, the complaint alleged.

 The next day, on April 2, Babloo held a party during which the woman was served lassi mixed with bhang (the leaves and flower tops of the cannabis plant). As she fell unconscious, Babloo raped her, the fax alleged.

 The tourist also alleged that the 22-year-old Babloo kept her under watch and she spent the next few days virtually confined in her hotel room. I had asked the money back but Babloo refused to hand it back to me, she said in her complaint.

 The woman is believed to have bribed one of the sweepers of the hotel to run away in the early hours of April 4. We are trying to find out what she has been doing since April 4, Ahmed said. In Jaipur, Rajasthan home minister G.C. Kataria said: If anyone is found guilty, he will not be spared and the law will take its own course.

 Kataria said the Japanese woman had reported the assault 16 days after the crime, but it would be taken up on a priority basis.

 Prince rerun, minus the happy ending

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Prince after his recuse

 Bhopal, Dec. 24: Five-year-old Vijay Pal, who fell 125 feet down a dry bore well yesterday, was not as lucky as Prince from Kurukshetra.

 In a rerun of Princes rescue in July, Vijay was pulled out of his black hole last night. But he died minutes later, allegedly because the district administration that rescued him hadnt thought of pushing the huge crowd back from the scene.

 The weight of so many people had caused part of the soil to cave in and block the hole, suffocating the boy.

 In Kurukshetra, six-year-old Prince had spent 50 hours in his 60-foot-deep hole, surviving on the water and biscuits lowered to him and the oxygen pumped into the bore well. For two days, television channels had beamed his ordeal live from the village in Haryana into the nations living rooms.

 Yesterdays tragedy happened at Sunehra in Madhya Pradeshs Raisen district, some 60 km from Bhopal.

 Vijay, the son of a farmer, was playing with friends in a field when he fell down the hole. The other boys immediately informed his parents, who got in touch with the district administration.

 Local administration employees were sent to the spot and the army was called in from Sagar district. The rescue team dug a parallel hole six feet away from the bore well, and then reached Vijay through a horizontal shaft.

 After a six-hour operation from early afternoon, during which Vijay was heard moaning, the boy was out of his pit. But his heart gave out within minutes, eyewitnesses said.

 District collector Arun Bhatt said the whole staff of the tehsil was at the site and had made every possible effort to save the boy. He had no answer when asked why the crowd had not been kept away.

 Expressing sorrow, Bhatt said, We did our best but unfortunately the boy died due to suffocation.

 Princes rescue, a novelty for Indias small-screen audiences, had the entire country glued to their television sets.

 A nation where nearly five children die every minute suddenly seemed more than ever conscious of the value of a human life. People prayed for the boy in towns and villages, the army was galvanised and even the Prime Minister expressed concern.

 A posse of politicians, including Haryana chief minister B.S. Hooda, descended on the spot. Gifts and prizes worth lakhs of rupees were announced and given to Prince and his family.

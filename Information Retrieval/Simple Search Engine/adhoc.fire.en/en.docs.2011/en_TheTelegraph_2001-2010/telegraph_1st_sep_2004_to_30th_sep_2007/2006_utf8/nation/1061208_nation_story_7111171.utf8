 Thiruvananthapuram, Dec. 7: Five HIV-positive orphans have been thrown out of a school after a performance at an event to mark World AIDS Day made their condition public.

 Authorities of Mar Dionysius Lower Primary School at Pampady in Keralas Kottayam district reportedly asked the caretaker of a local orphanage yesterday to take the children back lest their continuation spoil the name of the school.

 The children are in the 4-10 age group one boy is in pre-nursery, two girls are in the second standard and two girls are in Class IV.

 The school authorities parroted the usual explanation. Other parents will pull out their wards if the HIV kids are allowed to remain in the school and mingle freely with the rest, said an official.

 P.C. Yohanan, secretary of Asha Kiran orphanage, said the school turned a deaf ear to his appeals. I tried to convince them that segregation harmed the kids more than the disease itself. But they wouldnt listen and I had to take my kids back to the orphanage.

 This is not the first instance of HIV-positive children being thrown out of a school in Kerala. Siblings Benson and Benzy and Akshara and Ananthu had to stay at home when schools slammed their doors on them.

 After hearing about yesterdays incident, state health minister P.K. Sreemathy sent a team from the Kerala AIDS Control Society team to Kottayam, which is the countrys first fully literate town.

 After the AIDS Day programme on December 1, the local media had gone to town about the childrens performance, taking the veil off their HIV-positive status, said an official of the AIDS control society.

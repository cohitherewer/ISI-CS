 Delhi tragedy replays in Mumbai

 CHARU SUDAN KASTURI 

 New Delhi, July 12: Razia Sheikhs aged eyes look blankly ahead. The tears have dried and she may not want to speak, but her face tells a story of grief.

 The trauma for Razia and her family just does not seem to end. 

 The 66-year-old widow of a retired State Bank of India employee is still haunted by the images of her son Asif struggling in hospital, before succumbing to injuries caused by the blasts that ravaged Delhi last October. 

 Today, she is reliving her worst nightmare. Her grandson Riyaz is fighting for life in a Mumbai hospital after the train coach he was in was ripped apart in Dadar.

 Those who carry out these attacks are definitely not Muslims. Allah will punish them, if no one else does, is all Razia can say.

 She and her 36-year-old daughter Rizwana, who live in south Delhis Jungpura, say they received news on Riyaz around midnight.

 My elder brother Qasim called and told us that Riyaz, his son, is in critical condition, says Rizwana.

 Riyaz, 21, was on his way home from the call centre where he works. He finished work early in the morning, after which he spent time with his friends at Churchgate before boarding the train back home, Qasim, trying to control his sobs, said over the telephone from Mumbai.

 Riyaz now lies in Hinduja Hospital. Qasim says splinters pierced through Riyazs stomach and intestines. Doctors are not sure whether his son will pull through. He would have escaped had the blast been seconds later, says Qasim, who resides in Dadar.

 The train had just reached Dadar station, where Riyaz would have got off, when the bomb exploded. 

 Last October 29, Asif, Qasim and Rizwanas young brother, had been out shopping in Delhis Sarojini Nagar market, but the shopping spree on the eve of Id-ul-Fitr was cut short in the blast. 

 Asif was in Safdarjung Hospital for three days before he died. 

 Like Riyaz, Asif, too, had called home minutes before the fateful moment.

 He called to ask what his aapa (sister) wanted for Id, says Rizwana, breaking down. She pulls out the white kurta she had planned to give Asif on Id. She never did.

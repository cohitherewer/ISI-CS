The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 From remand home to global fest

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, July 26: He wanted to become a rich man in Mumbai. That dream did not come true but Karna Kumar Gupta is set to get his share of glory, in Mongolia. 

 The teenager, an inmate of a juvenile reform home in Varanasi, has been chosen to represent India at the International Summer Camp Childrens Festival in Nairambal from August 1 to 8.

 Karna will sing popular Bhojpuri numbers at the festival, where destitute children from across the world will gather.

 Five years ago, Karna, whose father is a painter, had run away from home in the Veerapatti area of Varanasi to chase his dream in Bollywood. He was eight years old then.

 But he failed to reach there despite several attempts. 

 In 2005, Karna again set out for Mumbai. This time, too, luck wasnt in his favour. He was caught at Bhusawal railway station in Madhya Pradesh selling bottles of water and sent to a remand home in Jalgaon in Maharashtra.

 Six months ago, Karna was shifted to the Bal Sudhar Griha, where he stays now.

 At the home, Karna would often sit by himself, crooning songs of Bhojpuri icon Manoj Tiwari Mridul. When his talent caught the ears of his teachers, they decided to give him proper training.

 Two weeks ago, we received a call from the district probationary officer (DPO), A.K. Mishra, asking us to send names of at least four talented boys to represent India at the festival in Mongolia, a remand home officer said.

 Apart from Karna, the others who made it to the shortlist were cricket players.

 Within a few days, we received another call from the DPO, saying Karna had been selected, the officer said.

 District magistrate Rajiv Agrawal has full faith in Karna that he will popularise Bhojpuri music at the festival.

 Karna isnt sure where Mongolia is ? all I know is it is a foreign trip ? but is aware of his brush with fortune. 

 The 13-year-old, who wants to become Manoj Tiwari No. 2, will fly from Delhi on Sunday, carrying his new dresses ? blazers and ties ? in a new air bag.

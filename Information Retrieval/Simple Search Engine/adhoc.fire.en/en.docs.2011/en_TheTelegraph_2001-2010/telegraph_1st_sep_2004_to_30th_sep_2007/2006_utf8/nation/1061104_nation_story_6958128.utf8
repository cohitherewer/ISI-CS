 Sangh back to temple games

 - RSS dusts Ayodhya to counter minority push

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 3: The Sangh parivar views Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs statement on minorities getting their share in jobs as yet another instance of growing minorityism of the UPA that, it hopes, would result in consolidating the Hindus and reviving the long-dead Ramjanmabhoomi movement.

 Besides getting the BJP to repeatedly attack the government for appeasing minorities, the RSS has stepped up activity on the Ayodhya temple front with a series of programmes planned to rekindle the agitation to construct the temple.

 The signs are all too clear for a concerted campaign by all arms of the Sangh, slated to begin early next month. 

 While BJP spokesperson Prakash Javdekar today warned of dangerous consequences of the UPAs minority appeasement, RSS national executive member Ram Madhav said the Prime Minister was proposing a violation of the Constitution that would result in widespread resentment in the country.

 The Akhil Bharatiya Karyakari Mandal (the national executive of the RSS) has formally passed a resolution joining hands with the VHP to step up the Ramjanmabhoomi agitation.

 The Sangh has enrolled Sankaracharya Swami Vasudevanand Saraswati to announce that it would organise Hindu conferences and public meetings in all districts across the country between December 1 and 6 to mobilise Hindus and strengthen their resolve for construction of the Ram temple.

 In every public meeting, RSS volunteers would join their friends in the VHP and assorted organisations of saffron-robed sadhus to announce four resolutions:

 The Ram temple will be built at the same place where today Ramlala (the idol of Ram) is situated

 No mosque will be allowed within the cultural boundary of Ayodhya

 No mosque will be allowed in the name of the invader Babur

 The Ram temple will be built with the stones stored in the Ramjanmabhoomi Nyas. They are the stones for which devotees of three lakh villages donated Rs 1.25 each in 1989-90

 The RSS resolution said a signature campaign, too, would be launched among the sadhus to adopt the same resolution.

 The model of the proposed Shri Ram Mandir also has reached all the houses in all cities, villages and abroad. The Hindus are sentimentally attached to this model. These sentiments must be honoured and the construction of the Shri Ram Mandir begun at the earliest under the auspices of the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas. 

 We call upon the Hindus to maintain their solidarity and remain determined to achieve its goal of Shri Ram Mandir construction, said the RSS resolution.

 For the record, Madhav said it was a very serious and concerted campaign to bring the Ram temple back into the nations agenda.

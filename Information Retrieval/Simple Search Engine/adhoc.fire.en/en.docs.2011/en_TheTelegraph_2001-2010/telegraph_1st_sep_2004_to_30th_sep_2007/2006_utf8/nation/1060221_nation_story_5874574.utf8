 Defence head count heads to court

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 20: Former deputy army chief Lt Gen. R.S. Kadyan has moved the Supreme Court, seeking an immediate stop to the ongoing head count of Muslims in the defence forces.

 Kadyan has also asked for a directive to the Centre not to declassify the data collected so far and produce the full record before the court.

 The petition was mentioned before a bench headed by Chief Justice Y.K. Sabharwal today and is likely to come up for hearing after it is numbered by the registry.

 Kadyan said he was aghast after reading reports that Justice (Retd) Rajinder Sachar, who is the chairman of the committee appointed by the Prime Minister to carry out the survey, had sought a list of Muslims employed in the defence forces.

 The former officer, who spent 44 years in the army, said the decision was ill-advised and would cause colossal damage to the integrity, camaraderie, morale and professionalism of the forces in the long run.

 It was highly improper to pick only one minority community for the survey, he said, adding that besides Muslims, there were many Sikhs, Christians and Parsis in the armed forces. 

 Kadyan cautioned that the survey would not only destroy the secular fabric of the defence forces but could also create some sort of fear among Muslims.

 He said the survey would not serve any purpose as there was no provision for reservation in the armed forces, not even for scheduled castes and scheduled tribes.

 Religion, apart from being a matter of individual faith, plays no other part in the forces, the former army officer said.

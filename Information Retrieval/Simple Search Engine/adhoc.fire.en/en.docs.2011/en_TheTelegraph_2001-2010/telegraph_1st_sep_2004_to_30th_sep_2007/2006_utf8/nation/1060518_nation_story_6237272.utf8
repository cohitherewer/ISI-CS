 Jessica case extradition

 New Delhi, May 17 (PTI): Delhi High Court today directed police to examine the possibility of initiating extradition proceedings against Vikas Gill, an absconding accused in the Jessica Lal murder.

 Gill is accused of harbouring prime suspect Manu Sharma and fled to the US in October 2005.

 The court issued notices to Chandigarh-based doctor J.S. Bedi for handing Gill a false medical certificate and directed that Gill be declared a proclaimed offender.

 Do you think he (Gill) is going to come back to India if you declare him a proclaimed offender? The only thing you can do is to attach his property. By that you think he will rush back to India, the court said.

 Step closer to satellite reliance

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 28: With a 50-second burn time, Indian space scientists today successfully ground-tested the full indigenous cryogenic stage to be used in the geosynchronous satellite launch vehicle.

 The test, at the Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre in Mahendragiri in Tamil Nadu, is the first for the complete stage that includes the cryogenic engine, liquid oxygen and hydrogen tanks, fuel flow control systems, and electronics.

 The cryogenic stage fuelled by liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen is a complex technology that India is trying to master in a bid to make GSLV flights completely self-reliant. All GSLV flights so far have used cryogenic engines supplied by Russia.

 The stage tested today produced the specified thrust and all systems performed satisfactorily, Indian Space Research Organisation sources said. 

 Previous tests had involved only the cryogenic engine and not the entire stage.

 The stage was tested for 50 seconds, the sources said. In actual space flight, the stage will need to deliver thrust for 750 seconds. Full duration tests of the cryogenic stage will be conducted in the coming weeks, the sources said.

 The first indigenous cryogenic stage is expected to power a GSLV flight sometime during 2007-08. 

 The GSLV is Isros largest and most powerful rocket, designed to carry 2500-kg class multi-purpose satellites into geostationary orbits.

 Arabian mirage on Titan

 New Delhi, May 4: Radar images taken by a spacecraft orbiting Titan, Saturns largest moon, have revealed vast seas of sand and dunes that look much like the sand dunes in the Arabian and Namibian deserts.

 The images captured by the Cassini spacecraft show sand seas and dunes, up to 100 metres tall running parallel to each other for hundreds of kilometres near Titans equatorial region, Cassini team members said.

 Its bizarre, said Ralph Lorenz, a team member at the Lunar and Planetary Laboratory of the University of Arizona. 

 These images from a moon of Saturn look just like radar images of Namibia or Arabia, said Lorenz, the lead author of a research paper describing Titans sand seas that will appear in the US journal Science tomorrow.

 The composition of Titans sand is unknown, but the most likely materials are organic solids or water ice or a mixture of the two, the scientists said.

 The dunes on Titan suggest that the moons geological processes can create sand-sized particles. Researchers believe Saturns powerful gravity generate tides in Titans atmosphere that create gentle surface winds. 

 In Titans thick atmosphere and low gravity, a gentle wind is enough to blow grains along the ground, Lorenz said.

 The dunes are similar in geometry ? width, spacing and length ? to the dunes in Namibia and the Rub al Khali in Arabia, geologist Nicholas Lancaster with the Desert Research Institute in the US, said in a commentary in the same issue of Science.

 Its remarkable. I dont think anyone would have expected to find this on Titan, particularly the loose material to make up the sand and pile it into the dunes, Lancaster told The Telegraph.

 The origin of Titans sand is still a mystery. One possible explanation is the erosion of ice bedrock by liquid methane rains. Although researchers believe it does not rain much on Titan, isolated storms could be intense enough to cause such erosion.

 An alternative explanation for the origin of sand is the interaction of light with gases in Titans atmosphere that over billions of years might have given rise to organic solids that somehow turned into sand-sized particles.

 World Bank ends freeze

 Cry for aid

 New Delhi, Aug. 29: After investigations into allegations of fraud and corruption in the procurement of pharmaceuticals, the World Bank this week resumed lending to Indias health sector.

 The bank has approved a package of $672 million to improve reproductive and child health services, reduce death and illness from tuberculosis and increase health services in Karnataka.

 The package covers $360 million for reproductive and child health, $170 million for the second national tuberculosis control project and nearly $142 million for Karnatakas health systems development project.

 The bank had withheld presenting the three projects to its board while it probed allegations of wrongdoing in the procurement of drugs in an earlier reproductive and child health programme.

 The investigation found serious deficiencies in procurement and practices, the bank said in a statement. The findings were passed on to the Indian government, which took strong action in response to the information, it said.

 The bank and the Government of India have agreed to implement a strong action plan aimed at addressing collusion and corruption in procurement in the health sector, said Praful Patel, the banks vice-president for South Asia.

 The $360-million grant for the reproductive and child health project is aimed at improving the health of poor women and children in rural and tribal areas and urban slums. Despite progress in improving healthcare delivery, India still has high levels of maternal and child mortality. About 136,000 women and 2.4 million children die every year in India mostly as a result of preventable causes.

 The $170-million credit for the tuberculosis programme aims to achieve the global targets of 70 per cent detection of cases related to the disease, and a cure rate of 85 per cent.

 The $141.83 million for Karnatakas health services would focus on maternal and child health and communicable diseases and seek to extend the reach of essential services to rural and under-served areas.

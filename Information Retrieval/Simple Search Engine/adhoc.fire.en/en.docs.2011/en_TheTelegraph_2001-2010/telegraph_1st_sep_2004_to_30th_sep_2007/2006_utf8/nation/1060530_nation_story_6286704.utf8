 BJP gifts Sangh more power and presence

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 29: The RSS has snatched its pound of flesh from Rajnath Singh by securing amendments to the BJPs constitution that arm the Sangh with unprecedented powers over the party.

 On the first day of his first national executive as BJP president, Rajnath, who is perceived to have won the party crown at the RSSs behest, returned the favour.

 The BJP passed four amendments aimed at giving overwhelming powers to RSS functionaries on deputation to the BJP. After the amendments, the RSSs presence will be more visible in the BJP as the Sanghs cadre strength will almost double. Besides, the Sangh cadre can work independently.

 BJP office-bearers as highly placed as state presidents have been stripped of their powers vis-?-vis the organising secretaries in the states. Organising secretaries are largely RSS men on deputation to the BJP.

 At a glance, the amendments make it look as if the BJP president suddenly has sweeping powers. Only the party president ? in this case, Rajnath Singh ? has the power to appoint and remove Sangh nominees as party organising secretaries from the district-level upwards.

 A closer scrutiny, however, indicates that by giving more teeth to the president, the amendment has taken away the power of district and state officials to remove RSS functionaries from state units.

 Without consulting the state party president, no general secretary (organisation) can be either appointed or removed at the district level.

 The move assumes significance in the light of the relentless power tussles between the state BJP leaders and the organising secretaries who are RSS men.

 Nowhere was it more visible than in Madhya Pradesh where the all-powerful organising secretary, Kaptan Singh Solanki, and Uma Bharti were at war. 

 By amending the party constitution, Rajnath has allowed the state organising secretaries to freely dictate terms to the party units.

 Sanjay Joshi, the national general secretary (organisation), will have two more secretaries. The unstated part of the amendment is that the additional posts would be filled by more RSS men.

 The party has decided to appoint zonal organising secretaries ? an RSS tradition. The BJP will create the post now to accommodate more RSS representatives who would oversee the political affairs of one or more states.

 Buddha squirms at writing on the wall

 Calcutta, March 1: No one likes to see the writing on the wall ? and the chief minister is no exception.

 Never mind if this writing is not a hint of what will come.

 Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today made it clear how he felt seeing poll graffiti screaming out his name in Jadavpur, his election turf. The veteran Marxist, whose government had on the Election Commissions request come out with a notification last month that banned defacing walls throughout the poll-bound state, said he was embarrassed.

 On my way to attend a function at Chakgeria in South 24-Parganas, my attention was drawn to an election graffiti in my Jadavpur Assembly constituency mentioning my name. I was really embarrassed at the very sight of that, he said.

 The Election Commission, the Bengal chief minister added, needs to call an all-party meeting to convey its stand on the issue.

 Bhattacharjee may be feeling embarrassed, but the state secretary of his party is not.

 Asked to comment on what Bhattacharjee said, Anil Biswas said: There is no reason for the chief minister to feel embarrassed.

 Why not? Pat came the reply from the CPM leader. Because he is a party candidate.

 When it was pointed out that former chief minister Jyoti Basu also thinks poll graffiti uncivilised, Biswas said: It is not that I am saying that it is something civilised. What is to be seen is whether or not it looks bad.

 Biswas has been breathing fire since February 23, when the state government invoked the West Bengal Prevention of Defacement of Property Act, 1976, which disallows graffiti on public and private buildings across the state.

 The day after, the CPM secretariat met and decided that the party would seek clarifications from the poll panel, citing earlier orders by the commission. The partys message was loud and clear: the state governments decision to implement the act would not prevent the CPM from appealing to the Election Commission for fresh directives on wall writing.

 Since February 24, Biswas has been saying he would only follow the poll panels directive and that he is waiting for a reply from the commission.

 I have written to the EC and I am awaiting its reply. I will only go by EC directives, he had said, when told that the state government had already issued a notification banning defacement of private and public property.

 Although Biswas stopped short of criticising the governments decision, he kept questioning it, though not in words, but by stressing that the poll panel was the final authority on matters related to elections.

 His comments revealed something else, too: his reluctance to follow a directive issued by a government headed by his party.

 Biswas may be unwilling, but state home secretary Prasad Ranjan Roy makes it very clear that the ban on poll graffiti across the state is already in force.

 We have asked SPs and the commissioner of police, Calcutta, to convene a meeting of political parties to ensure that there isnt any graffiti and that walls be cleaned up, the officer said.

 N-plant plot busted

 ANIL BUDUR LULLA

 Bangalore, Jan. 16: Bangalore police have arrested another Lashkar-e-Toiba militant in connection with last months terror attack on the Indian Institute of Science campus and seized explosives from him.

 Bangalore police commissioner Ajai Kumar Singh told reporters today that Habeeb, arrested from Almatti in Bagalkot district of north Karnataka yesterday, was an important catch with Lashkar links. 

 The 35-year-old accused used two aliases ? Mehaboob Ibrahim and Chopdar ? and interrogation had revealed that he was planning explosions at the Kaiga nuclear plant near Karwar, Almatti dam in Bagalkot and wanted to disrupt power transmission lines from the Sharavathy project in Shimoga district, Singh said. 

 The police are on the lookout for some of his associates. The explosives seized from Habeeb were gelatin sticks. Some incriminating documents have also been seized, the commissioner said.

 This is the second Lashkar militant arrested in connection with the science hub attack. Habeeb, a fabrication mechanic and a native of Guledagud in Bagalkot, was working in Saudi Arabia between 1993 and 2001 and allegedly in touch with Abdul Rehman, who was arrested earlier. 

 The police latched onto Habeeb after Rehman went through a narco analysis while in custody. Habeeb would be produced before the court later in the day.

 He is an important Lashkar activist in Karnataka who worked under Rehman. Even if he is not linked to the IISc attack, his intention to use explosives exposes him to the charge of waging war against the country, Singh said. 

 Both the accused have not yet admitted to their role in the attack on Indian Institute of Science in which an IIT Delhi professor emeritus was killed and four others were injured. 

 However, the police claim both had been trained in handling weapons and explosives.

 They seemed to have been trained on how to respond to police interrogation, too. So far, they only revealed a Lashkar-backed conspiracy to indulge in organised attacks on vital installations, Singh said.

 While Rehmans connections were being probed in India and abroad, Bangalore police have registered cases for hatching a conspiracy and waging war against the Indian government and spreading communal violence using fire arms and explosives. 

 The police are verifying Rehmans claim that a few people from the state had travelled to Pakistan and Bangladesh for arms training.

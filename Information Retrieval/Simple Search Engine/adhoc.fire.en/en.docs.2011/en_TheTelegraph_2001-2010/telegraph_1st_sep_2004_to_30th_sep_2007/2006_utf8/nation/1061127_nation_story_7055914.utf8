 Creamy layer damper

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT AND PTI

 New Delhi, Nov. 26: The creamy layer among other backward classes (OBC) may not be able to straightaway take advantage of the 27 per cent quota in institutions of higher education if the government accepts the recommendation of a parliamentary standing committee.

 The standing committee on human resource development has said the creamy layer the well-off among the weaker sections should be allowed to tap the extra quota only when other OBC candidates are not available in sufficient numbers to fill up the 27 per cent quota, a PTI report said.

 The creamy layer should be considered for reservations if there is a shortfall in the required 27 per cent of OBC students, according to the standing committee which has members of Parliament who are opposed to offering reservations to the creamy layer.

 The bill introduced by the government earlier this year does not exclude the creamy layer from the quota system. An oversight committee, formed under Veerappa Moily to suggest ways to implement the OBC quota, had left the decision whether to include or exclude the creamy layer to the government.

 But the concept of giving non-creamy layer OBC candidates a right of way over creamy layer OBCs had emerged during the discussions of the Moily oversight committee.

 In its report, the Moily committee had said that an analysis of the national sample survey data suggests that the inclusion of the creamy layer will result in seats getting pre-empted by the OBCs from the top two income brackets at the cost of the poorer candidates.

 The oversight committee had said almost all rural OBCs from northern, central and eastern regions of the country would be deprived of the intended benefit of reservations. It had also cautioned that if the creamy layer is not excluded, the poorest among the OBCs would be placed at a disadvantage.

 During its discussions, the oversight committee had considered the suggestion that the creamy layer should be excluded in the first instance, and a provision should be made that, if after admissions of the non-creamy layer OBCs some reserved seats remain vacant, these should be offered to the creamy layer candidates.

 The report of the standing committee on HRD is yet to be tabled in Parliament. To incorporate its recommendations into the quota bill, a member will have to move an amendment to the bill.

 Political consensus has eluded the creamy layer concept. The CPM is not against excluding the affluent, but parties that rely on the OBC vote bank want all backwards to be covered.

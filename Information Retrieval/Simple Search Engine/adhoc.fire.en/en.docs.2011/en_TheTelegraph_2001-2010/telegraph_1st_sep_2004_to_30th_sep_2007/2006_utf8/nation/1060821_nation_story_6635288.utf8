 Lalu PIL verdict today

 New Delhi, Aug. 20 (PTI): The Supreme Court will tomorrow pronounce its judgment on a public interest litigation that has challenged the appointment of a special judge in the disproportionate assets case against Lalu Prasad and his wife Rabri Devi.

 A bench of Justices K.G. Balakrishnan, A.R. Lakshmanan and S.H. Kapadia will deliver the verdict on the PIL filed by BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi and Rajeev Ranjan Singh Lallan of the Janata Dal (United).

 The PIL has also challenged the quashing of income-tax cases against Lalu Prasad and Rabri and sought cancellation of their bail.

 In the petition, the NDA leaders have questioned the appointment of additional district judge Munni Lal Paswan as special CBI judge to try the assets case, which is an offshoot of the fodder scam case that involves the Rashtriya Janata Dal chief and his wife.

 Appearing for Lalu Prasad and Rabri, senior advocate Ram Jethmalani had earlier contended that the PIL was not maintainable as it was politically motivated.

 He said if the appointment of Paswan as special CBI judge was quashed, it would set a wrong precedent.

 Defending the proceedings before the income-tax tribunal and a change of prosecutor, solicitor-general G.E. Vahanvati had said the allegation that favours were shown to Lalu Prasad after the United Progressive Alliance came to power at the Centre in May 2004 was false.

 Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, who appeared for the NDA leaders, alleged that after the UPA came to power at the Centre and Lalu Prasad became railway minister, the income tax cases were dealt with in a manner to suit him and his wife.

 He also said the CBI replaced the prosecutors involved with the case for a decade with inexperienced officers.

 Demanding proper monitoring of the case by the apex court, Rohatgi had requested that the prosecution in the assets case be conducted by the original prosecutors and the special court be directed to complete the trial within three months.

 Questioning the decision to entrust the criminal case to Paswan, he had said the apex court should decide who the judge would be.

 Rohatgi had submitted that the apex court should monitor the case like the Gujarat riot cases and direct the Centre to appeal against the tribunals order in tax matters pertaining to the RJD chief and his wife.

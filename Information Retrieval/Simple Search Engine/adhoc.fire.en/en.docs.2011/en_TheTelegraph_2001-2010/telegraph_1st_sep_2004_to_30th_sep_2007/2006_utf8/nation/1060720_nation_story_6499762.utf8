 Profit cloud on Jairam

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Jairam Ramesh

 New Delhi, July 19: The Election Commission has received a petition seeking disqualification of minister of state for commerce and industries Jairam Ramesh for holding an office of profit. 

 The petition alleged that by being a member of the National Advisory Council (NAC), Ramesh was holding an office of profit and hence he should be disqualified. Rashtriya Mukti Morcha chief Ravinder Kumar filed the petition which was referred to the poll panel by President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam last week, sources in the commission said. 

 The petition is under process to see whether Ramesh occupied the NAC post after he became a Rajya Sabha member, they added.

 Ramesh joins four ministers of the Manmohan Singh government against whom petitions have been pending with the commission seeking disqualification for allegedly holding offices of profit. 

 The other four are Pranab Mukherjee, Sharad Pawar, Meira Kumar and T. Subbirami Reddy.

 St Columbas

 New Delhi, June 21 (PTI): The Delhi government has derecognised the St Columbas school for allegedly transferring funds worth Rs 1.83 crore to its parent organisation, the Christian Brothers of India.

 But the order will come into effect only from April 2007, a government official said.

 The government served three notices on the school following an audit check. But the school has not replied. The official also said the school had hiked fees without any reason.

 The school authorities were not available for comment.

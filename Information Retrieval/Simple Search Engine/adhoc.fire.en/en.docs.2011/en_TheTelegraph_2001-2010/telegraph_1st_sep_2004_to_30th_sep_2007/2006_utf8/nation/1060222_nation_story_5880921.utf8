VIRUS SHOTS 

 Bangalore: The Karnataka government has ruled out bird flu as the cause of the death of 16,000 chickens in a poultry farm in Shimoga. 

 The birds died due to Infectious Bursal Disease, a common disease that affects poultry in the state, sources said. Their blood and faecal samples have been sent to Bhopals High Security Animal Disease Laboratory and the reports are expected in a few days, they added.

 Beijing/Dhaka (Agencies): China has banned import of pet and wild birds and ordered stricter screening of passengers from bird flu-hit countries. Bangladesh has banned import of poultry and poultry items and cancelled import orders from six more countries, including Germany and France, taking the list to 25. 

 Chennai: Chicken prices across Tamil Nadu have crashed by Rs 15 to Rs 20 a kg and around three crore eggs have remained unsold since Monday. Chief minister Jayalalithaa said there has been no instance of the virus attack in the state.

 Bhaderwah, April 24: Chotta Kashmir turned out in strength to clock a record turnout, probably because the son of the soil is in the fray.

 Bhaderwah, the constituency from which Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Ghulam Nabi Azad is contesting the mandatory bypoll to retain his throne, registered a turnout of 72 per cent.

 At this point of time, we have the polling percentage of 72 per cent from Bhaderwah constituency. But it is likely to go up by two to four percentage points as the final figures are yet to come in, chief electoral officer Braj Raj Sharma said this evening.

 This is an all-time record in Bhaderwah, Sharma added. In the 2002 Assembly poll, 54 per cent of the electorate in the constituency had cast its vote.

 Three other seats in the state, too, went to largely peaceful polls today, barring an attempt on the life of a candidate and stray incidents of violence. The overall turnout is estimated to be 59 per cent, according to a preliminary count.

 But Jammus Bhaderwah, called Chotta Kashmir for its picturesque similarities with the Valley, is in the limelight because Azad is the first non-Kashmiri to become chief minister of the state.

 Last time, when then chief minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed contested a byelection in Pahalgam, the voting percentage did not exceed 22 per cent.

 Several people today declared in public that they voted for Azad, strengthening the general perception that his victory is a foregone conclusion. 

 Bhaderwah is for Azad. You write it down and if you dont believe me, wait till Thursday (counting day), said Naheed Imitiaz, a middle-aged woman, as she came out of the polling booth with her friends. All of us have voted for our chief minister?

 Confident that their son of the soil will win by a very big margin, some have decided to retain the ink on their finger. This, they believe, will stand testimony that they did cast their votes for the first-ever non-Kashmiri chief minister.

 However, BJP candidate Dhantar Singh, the only one who dared to challenge Azad, felt the optimism of these voters was misplaced. They are in an illusion. The electronic voting machines will tell a different story altogether on April 27, the day when counting is done. Just wait and watch, he said.

 Despite militant threats and bomb explosions last week, enthusiastic voters queued up before polling stations in the constituency that has been declared completely sensitive with 60 security companies deployed.

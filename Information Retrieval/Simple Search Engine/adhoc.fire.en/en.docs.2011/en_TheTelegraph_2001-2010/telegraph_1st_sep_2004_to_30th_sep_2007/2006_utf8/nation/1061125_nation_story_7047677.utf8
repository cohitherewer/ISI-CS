 Below zero marks for UPA govt

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 24: The BJP carried out a mid-term appraisal of the UPA today, recording the ruling alliances performance as below zero on a scale of one to ten.

 Weak, helpless and useless is how the BJPs deputy leader in the Lok Sabha, Vijay Kumar Malhotra, described the government as it completes half of its term in office.

 We do not recall any government that has invited such severe admonitions from not just the Opposition but also from the judiciary and even top-ranking officials like the Intelligence Bureau director E.S.L. Narasimhan, Malhotra said.

 He said the BJP would bring an adjournment motion in the Lok Sabha on Monday to focus attention on the governments complete failure on the internal security front.

 On all important issues from internal security to price rise the UPA has failed like no other government did ever before, Malhotra said .

 You have the head of the countrys top intelligence agency pleading with the government to provide a solid legal infrastructure to deal with the threat of terrorism. But let alone bringing in new legislation, the government has done away with even the existing laws like the Prevention of Terrorism Act, he said.

 The countrys home minister is publicly declaring that we are not safe, that India is being targeted from all sides. Terrorists can attack everything from nuclear installations to IT centres that are of importance to us. What kind of government is this, he demanded.

 On the economic front, even their allies are attacking them. Prices have hit the roof, he added.

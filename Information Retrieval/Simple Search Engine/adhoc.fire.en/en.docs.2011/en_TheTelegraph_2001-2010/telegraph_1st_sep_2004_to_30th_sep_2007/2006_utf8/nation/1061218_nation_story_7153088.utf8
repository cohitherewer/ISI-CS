 Isro reaches for Mars in stage II

 New Delhi, Dec. 17: A scientist at a space centre in Thiruvananthapuram inscribes dreams on sheets of paper and desktop computers, laying down possible flight trajectories of two spacecraft one to Mars, the other to an asteroid.

 At the Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre, engineers have also drawn up preliminary designs of space capsules to hold two or three astronauts. In Bangalore, researchers are trying to find ways to make satellites smaller and smarter.

 The Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) is in transition, at the edge of one era, poised to move into another the nation willing. At space centres across the country, policy makers and researchers are looking for new research and technology challenges.

 Isro has more or less achieved its primary objectives set by Vikram Sarabhai in the 1960s. Its time for a second vision, said Isro chairman G. Madhavan Nair. The late Sarabhai, described as the father of Indias space programme, had envisioned the use of space technology for national development goals.

 India now has two operational launch vehicles, and constellations of satellites that help predict weather, pinpoint promising fishing zones, relay lessons to rural schools, and connect patients in remote villages to doctors in cities.

 While the lunar orbiter Chandrayaan-1, expected to be launched in 2008, will be the first among the new-era projects, Isro has asked in-house scientists to come up with ideas about future space missions.

 We have the technology to send space probes to explore the inner solar system, said Jitendra Goswami, director, Physical Research Laboratory, Ahmedabad, which is pursuing planetary science research.

 Scientists at the Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre and the Isro Satellite Centre in Bangalore have drawn up pencil-and-paper plans for post-Chandrayaan missions space probes to Mars and two asteroids.

 But scientists cautioned that Isro will encounter obstacles on the ground including non-technology challenges involving human resources in any attempts to turn such paper dreams into reality.

 The agency will also need to build a critical mass of experts in astronomy and space instrumentation crucial to sustain space exploration via space probes.

 Isro engineers will have to learn to communicate with distant spacecraft, develop smaller and smarter spacecraft that will require lower levels of human control and design payloads to make meaningful science possible.

 Over the past decade, weve seen a dramatic depletion of talent in space instrumentation, said a senior scientist in Isro.

 Astronomers today have easy access to observational data from telescopes used by the international community such as the Hubble Space Telescope or the Chandra X-ray telescope and do not have to design their own instruments. We have to reverse this trend, he said.

 Space exploration projects are also expected to entice and retain talent within Isro, which, officials said, typically loses about 10 per cent of technical staff. Most who leave do so within two or three years, said an Isro official.

 We cant pay salaries that the private sector offers. But with new projects, we can offer exciting challenges to young people, ask them to do things no one in India has done before, said Vissa Sunderaramaiah, Isros scientific secretary.

 Nair said Isro wants a national debate on Indias future space projects, including manned missions. Earlier this month, some 80 scientists, several from outside the space department, attended a meeting in Bangalore where Isro unveiled proposals for a manned space mission, expected to cost Rs 10,000 crore over eight years.

 Tiruchirappalli, March 3: At the DMKs crucial state conference ahead of the Assembly elections, Sonia Gandhi is everywhere.

 Her pictures adorn the conclave logo; she smiles at you from the huge advertisements, dominating the right side while silhouettes of M. Karunanidhi and the late Dravidian leaders, Annadurai and Periyar, jostle for space on the left.

 It signifies one of the strangest features of this years Tamil Nadu polls: the Congress, once the DMKs principal rival, is now its biggest ally.

 Sonia isnt here yet, but she will be on Sunday, the last day of the three-day DMK conference that hopes to hammer out vital poll-related issues.

 Seat-sharing talks with some of its smaller allies, particularly the Vaiko-led MDMK, having got bogged down, Karunanidhis party is striving to project the Congress as its best friend.

 The DMK chief this morning spoke of a 90 per cent chance to clinch a seat deal with the Congress when Sonia comes down to address the conference.

 He acknowledged that the final seat shares of the seven allies ? who include the PMK, CPM, CPI and the Indian Union Muslim League ? is still some way off.

 We will do this as early as possible after the conference, first picking up the threads with the Left parties, he said, but added that a pact was close to being sealed with the Congress.

 He was less optimistic about the MDMK. Although Vaiko had last week scotched speculation about quitting the alliance, it was clear he was the biggest hurdle to a seat deal.

 Karunanidhi said Vaiko had asked for 25 of the 234 seats. The DMK initially agreed to 20 and in my latest offer yesterday, I went up to 22, he said.

 In what sounded like an ultimatum, he added: If he (Vaiko) accepts the 22 seats, I am hopeful he will continue to be in the alliance.

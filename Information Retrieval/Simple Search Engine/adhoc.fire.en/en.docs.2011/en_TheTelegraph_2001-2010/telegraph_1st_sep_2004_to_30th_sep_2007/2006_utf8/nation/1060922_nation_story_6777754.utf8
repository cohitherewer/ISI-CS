 Buddha firm on second airport

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 21: The 

 Bengal government seems determined to set up a second airport 

 in the city, even if the central government does not come 

 forward with financial assistance. 

 We will develop a second airport, 35 km from Dum Dum, with participation from the private sector if the central government doesnt provide funds, Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said here today.

 During his visit to the city in July, Union civil aviation minister Praful Patel had ruled out a new airport, saying the existing one could be upgraded.

 Im talking to a few private players. The Centre has estimated an investment of Rs 2,087 crore for modernisation of Dum Dum airport, Bhattacharjee told the 48th annual general meeting of Capexil, earlier called Chemicals and Allied Products Export Promotion Council.

 The two runways at the airport are so close that a pair of flights cannot take off or land at the same time, Bhattacharjee said. 

 He insisted there was little scope for a third runway. We need a greenfield airport and a feasibility study has been commissioned, he said. The government has identified a site near Garia for the purpose.

 Patel is more keen on Dum Dums modernisation, saying the plan is based on traffic at the airport in 2025.

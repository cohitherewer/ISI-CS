 Baig and Azad: Too 

 close? 

 Srinagar, Aug. 31: Jammu and Kashmirs Congress-led coalition government was in turmoil today after junior partner Peoples Democratic Party recalled its deputy chief minister who had apparently got too close to chief minister Ghulam Nabi Azad.

 The PDP had earlier in the day told Azad that his deputy Muzaffar Hussain Baig held too many key portfolios, some of which should be handed over to other PDP ministers, such as Tariq Hamid Kara. But the chief minister rejected the request.

 A provoked PDP immediately called a meeting and, after a three-hour huddle, announced that Baig was being withdrawn from the ministry and also sacked as the legislature party leader.

 The party said it had nominated agriculture minister Abdul Aziz Zargar as leader of its MLAs and written to Azad to induct him as the new deputy chief minister.

 Baig has been holding some of the most important departments of the government, including finance, planning and development, law, parliamentary affairs and tourism. The PDP had expected he would be relieved of some of these in a shuffle that was completed today, and was upset when he wasnt.

 The first leg of the shuffle had taken place on Tuesday with several new ministers sworn in but the new allocation of portfolios was announced today.

 Following the announcement, PDP chief Mehbooba Mufi met Azad and demanded that Baig be stripped of finance and planning.

 Finance, she said, should be given to forest and housing minister Kara, who is close to her father and the previous chief minister, Mufti Mohammad Sayeed. Planning should go to some other PDP minister.

 But Azad stood by his deputy, who is believed to have become very close to the chief minister, and merely took away the relatively lightweight department of tourism from him and handed it to Kara.

 With Congress-PDP ties in apparent jeopardy, the Opposition National Conferences leader, Omar Abdullah, was asked if he was preparing to lend outside support to the Congress. He replied that the situation does not demand such a move.

 We are not considering any option. We are sitting in the Opposition and will continue to do so, Abdullah said.

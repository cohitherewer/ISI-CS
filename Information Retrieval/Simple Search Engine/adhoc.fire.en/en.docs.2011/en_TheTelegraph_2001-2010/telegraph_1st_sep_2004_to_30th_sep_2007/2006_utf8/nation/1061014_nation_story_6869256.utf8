 Million get set to change faith

 OUR BUREAU

 Mumbai, Oct. 13: The air in Nagpur was thick with tension today as about a million Dalits warmed up for a mass conversion rally tomorrow and the VHP and Bajrang Dal threatened to scuttle it.

 The rally, to mark 50 years of B.R. Ambedkars conversion to Buddhism, purportedly aims at giving Dalits a chance to convert to a religion of their choice. Copies of anti-conversion laws passed by some states are likely to be burnt.

 The VHP and Bajrang Dal have termed this a provocative action and vowed not to allow any such thing in Nagpur that is home to the RSS headquarters.

 These are anti-national elements. Our Constitution gives freedom of religious propagation, not proselytisation, said Prashant Harpalkar, organising secretary of the Maharashtra VHP.

 The rally has been organised by the All India Christian Council and the All India Confederation of Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes. They plan to promote tomorrow as World Religious Freedom Day.

 Christian council general secretary John Dayal said in secular India, all were free to follow a religion of their choice and anti-conversion laws were against the spirit of the Constitution.

 Fed up with the oppression of the Hindu religion, many Dalits want to convert to Christianity, to Buddhism, even Islam and Sikhism. Tomorrow, they will convert and burn copies of the draconian (anti-conversion) law.

 Dayal said similar ceremonies would be held this month in many places, including Delhi and Hyderabad.

 A symposium was held today as part of the conversion programme. It was attended by Maharashtra minority commission chairman Mohamed Nasim Raziuddin Siddiqui, a close aide of NCP backward leader Chhagan Bhujbal.

 Siddiquis presence is being seen as significant as most parties, including the Shiv Sena, have been trying to woo the backward classes.

 Of course, there is a political angle. The conversions are a mark of protest against the cornering of political and social power by higher castes. It is time to reclaim that, said Sakya Ponnu Durai of the SC/ST federation.

 But even as the tension spiralled, Nagpur police claimed they have yet to be contacted by the organisers.

 No official request has come to us. Still we are being watchful. We will not tolerate any disturbance or violence. We will take action if anyone breaks the law or tries to exploit the situation, Nagpur police commissioner S.P. Yadhav said.

 Ramdas Athavale of the Republican Party of India, former Prime Minister V.P. Singh, BSP leader Mayavati and Udit Raj of the SC/ST federation will attend the rally. Bollywood personalities Raj Babbar, Mahesh Bhatt and A.K. Hangal are scheduled to attend.

 Arunachal Pradesh, Orissa, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Gujarat have passed anti-conversion laws. No such law exists in Maharashtra.

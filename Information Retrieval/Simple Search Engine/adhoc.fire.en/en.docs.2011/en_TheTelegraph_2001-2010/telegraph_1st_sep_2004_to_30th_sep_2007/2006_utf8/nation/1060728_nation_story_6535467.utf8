 Hot sambar kills boy

 Chennai, July 27: A 12-year-old boy died and two others suffered serious burns when they fell into a vessel of boiling sambar at a school mid-day meal centre in Tamil Nadu yesterday, reports our special correspondent.

 Dheenan, a student of the Government Higher Secondary School at Melavalampatti in Kancheepuram district, succumbed to severe burn injuries at a hospital in Chennai. Veerappan, 11, and Sivasubramanian, 12, who suffered third-degree burns, are battling for their lives.

 Chief minister M. Karunanidhi, who had launched the mid-day meal scheme on July 15 ? the birth anniversary of the late leader Kamaraj Nadar ? has asked electricity minister Arcot N. Veeraswamy to announce an ex-gratia of Rs 1 lakh to the family of the dead child.

 New Delhi, Jan. 13: A day after his party softened its tone on Sonia Gandhi and the Centre in the phone-tapping controversy, Amar Singh avoided repeating his charges against the Congress chief.

 But the Samajwadi Party general secretary, summoned to a police station and questioned about his allegations, tried to widen his campaign against political espionage by drafting in Congress leader Natwar Singh. He met the former foreign minister today and later alleged Natwars house was being bugged.

 I have information from the Enforcement Directorate that false documents are being made against Natwar Singh. I have come to him personally because it is dangerous to talk on phone now a days.

 Amar also rattled off names of senior political leaders who have claimed to be victims of phone-tapping: L.K. Advani, George Fernandes (whose allegation was made today), Chandrababu Naidu and senior Congress leaders, too, are suffering from this onslaught. This is not my personal fight.

 The BJP, however, distanced its campaign against political surveillance from Amars personal affairs.

 Amar also spoke darkly of a conspiracy to kill him and BJP leader Pramod Mahajan. I have told police that one of my close friends met a person called Rahul between December 27 and 28. He revealed that the IB had outsourced an assignment to tap my phone. Rahul made other disclosures ? including one about a plan to kill me and Pramod Mahajan.

 Instead of Sonia, the target of his attack today was Congress general secretary Ambika Soni, who, he alleged, was at the root of the controversy.

 The Samajwadi Party had climbed down from its aggressive stand yesterday, fielding Janeshwar Mishra ? Rajya Sabha MP and a Lohiaite veteran ? to control the damage wrought by the two-week campaign against the UPA government and Sonia. 

 Other than lack of support from the Left and ally Ajit Singh, one reason for party chief Mulayam Singh Yadavs turnaround, sources said, could be his familys view that he must not go the full hog to bail out Amar. 

 The family believes that proximity to Amar has diluted Mulayams Lohiaite socialist image, which he needs to polish up again with the polls approaching.

 Amar today grumbled about being called to the Delhi polices special cell unit, where he was questioned from 2 pm to 3.35 pm. I am no criminal. I am a victim? The police were quite decent but they could have come to my house instead. Summoning me to a police station is an insult.

 Asked how long it would take the police to crack the case, Union home secretary V.K. Duggal said: I can only say very soon.

 Chandigarh, Jan. 10: Memories of terror returned to haunt Punjab with the discovery of 114 live grenades from the Golden Temple complex in Amritsar.

 Had even one of them detonated, it could have caused extensive damage to the sanctum sanctorum, police said. 

 This is the first time such a huge amount of explosives has been found here since Operation Bluestar in 1984, when the army raided the shrine to flush out militants. 

 Jagtar Singh, a volunteer, detected the grenades that were packed in jute bags. He was participating in a Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee-organised kar seva to build a new administrative complex.

 Some kar sevaks were digging to lay the foundation of a new building next to the Guru Nanak Nivas, SGPC secretary Dalmegh Singh said. 

 As soon as Jagtar struck a piece of iron, the SGPC was informed and it contacted the police, Dalmegh added. The grenades were rusted and looked very old. The area, incidentally, was occupied by the army and other paramilitary forces after Operation Bluestar in June 1984.

 The grenades have been handed to the bomb disposal squad of Punjab police.

 We have conducted a search of the area where the grenades were found. They are being thoroughly examined. Since they have become rusty, it is difficult to read the markings on them. Had they exploded, they would have damaged even the main temple, which is situated about 50 metres away. We have cordoned off the whole area, said Amritsar superintendent of police Kaustub Sharma.

 The police have asked the SGPC authorities to stop digging in the complex till probes are over. Later, any digging will be under the supervision of the police, an officer said.

 A Chandigarh-based forensic laboratory has been asked to find out how long the grenades were there in the temple. The army, too, will help in investigations.

 The Centre has sought a report from the Punjab government. 

 Chief minister Amarinder Singh, however, played down the significance of the discovery, saying the grenades were rusted and could not have been used.

 SGPC officials questioned the role of the army and paramilitary forces immediately after Operation Bluestar. 

 They handed the complex back to us after claiming that the temple and the surrounding areas had been cleared of terrorists and guns and ammunition. It is shocking to find how such a large cache of grenades could have escaped undetected, especially when they had combed the complex with sophisticated gadgets, an official said.

 In the late eighties, some skeletons were discovered when the area around the temple complex was being razed to construct a pathway.

 The grenades dug out today, however, did not scare away devotees who continued to throng the temple in thousands.

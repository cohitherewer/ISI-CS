The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Visa googly at Pak fans

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chandigarh, Oct. 5: Mohammad 

 Yousuf may be getting all the support from his mates that 

 Younis Khan seems to miss, but when his team takes the field 

 at Mohali the Pakistan skipper may lack enough backing from 

 the stands.

 Punjab police have requested the Centre to cut down on visas to Pakistani fans entering through the Wagah border to watch their teams ICC Champions Trophy matches here on October 25 and 27.

 Nine Pakistanis who had crossed the Wagah border to watch the India-Pakistan Test match in March last year are yet to be accounted for. They could be anywhere in the country, even plotting terror attacks, an officer said.

 We want the external affairs ministry to cut down the number of visas to one-fourth of last time and, if possible, not (let in any Pakistani fan) at Wagah.

 Pakistan has two group matches at Mohali, against New Zealand and South Africa.

 For the first India-Pakistan Test last year, the Centre had granted 2,754 visas to Pakistanis to cross over at Wagah. In keeping with the usual mehmangiri that Indian and Pakistani cricket fans receive in each others countries, most stayed as guests at local peoples homes and even some hotels put them up for free.

 But 11 of the mehmans went missing, only two of whom have been arrested and are in jail.

 Punjab cricket boss I.S. Bindra said the Centre had not yet okayed the proposal to open the Wagah border to Pakistani fans.

 If Delhi does flash the green light, the police plan to ferry the Pakistanis from the border and keep them under strict watch in Mohali. Well escort them back to the border after the matches. Well watch every movement they make during their stay in the town, the officer said.

 A three-tier security ring has been put in place in and around the 37,000-seat stadium, with barricades, closed-circuit cameras, infra-red scanners and night-vision devices installed up to a kilometre from the ground.

 Considering the terror attacks in Mumbai and other parts of the world, we have decided to have airport-like security at the venue and its neighbourhood. Cricket could be a target of terror, Mohali police chief Naunihal Singh said.

 Bindra said the security at Mohali is the strictest ever seen at any venue in India.

 We want to see how people react to the security measures. It could be a trend-setter for other states to follow. Even the International Cricket Council would be monitoring our security measures.

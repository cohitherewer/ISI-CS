 Nirupam calls for party help 

 - Pro-industry govt foresees slide in support for CPM in Bengal, but eye on brighter future 

 BISWAJIT ROY

 Calcutta, July 9: With the Opposition crying foul and allies sounding apprehensive, Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and industries minister Nirupam Sen are urging the CPM rank and file to rally behind their land acquisition drive for industry.

 Firm on carrying forward his vision of development, Bhattacharjee, however, is aware that the CPM runs the risk of losing the support of the poor, particularly small and marginal farmers whose land is being taken away. 

 CPM state secretary Biman Bose and Prabhat Patnaik, who is part of the partys think tank, have already warned of a possible clash between the perceptions of its old base, the poor, and new middle-class supporters. 

 We are aware of the alienation at the micro-level and possible immediate loss of support among farmers whose land is being acquired, Sen told The Telegraph. But we have to think of the future. And the party as well as the mass organisations role is important in minimising this alienation and mobilising peasants support for industrialisation.

 Referring to the immediate need to acquire 38,000 acres for big industrial and infrastructure projects, Bhattacharjee said in an interview to the CPM organ Marxbadi Pa- th: Its not possible to acquire this huge amount of land by the field officers of the land and land reforms department. It will be an impossible task without the conscious efforts of the Krishak Sabha (the CPM farmers wing), particularly when the Opposition is spreading confusion. 

 The party and the mass organisations can play a key role in organising peoples initiatives, he added.

 The Left Front governments success in land reforms was possible because of synergy between the Krishak Sabha and the governments political will, felt the chief minister. 

 We have to explain to the farmers the relation between agriculture and industry, why we need industrialisation and what the government has done so far to safeguard the interests of those who would give up their land, he explained.

 In the same periodical, Sen highlighted the same issue. Our success depends on what the relation between the party and the government will be and how far we will be able to carry forward that relation. 

 But with land and land reforms minister Abdur Rezzak Mollah expressing concern about the wisdom of farmland acquisition, it is clear that the party still has many doubting Thomases. 

 Benoy Konar, a Krishak Sabha leader and CPM state secretariat member, admitted that. We could not activate the party, the Sabha and the panchayat system in support of industrialisation. 

 Sen said: Campaigns are on within the party and among mass organisations to underline that after 30 years of Left rule, achievements of land reforms would boomerang on us if we dont step on to the next task ? industrialisation.

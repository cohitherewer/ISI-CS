 Soren blinks, but Munda soldiers on

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 5: Amid increasing pressure from the Congress and the RJD, JMM chief Shibu Soren today agreed to give up claim to the chief ministership of Jharkhand and, in the process, speeded up the churning in the state.

 Three of the four Jharkhand ministers who quit today were holding repeated talks with the UPA leaders for the past three days, but Sorens rigid stand had caused a deadlock. Although the numbers in the Assembly appeared to be against the Arjun Munda government, there was no movement. 

 The impasse was broken early today when Congress leaders Ahmad Patel, Mobel Rebello and R.K. Anand persuaded Soren, sources said.

 Once Soren blinked, Madhu Koda emerged frontrunner for the post. 

 Koda, Anosh Ekka and Harinarayan Rai have been camping in the capital. They have been joined by lone NCP MLA and minister Kamlesh Singh.

 In the event of the formation of a UPA government led by Koda, the Congress would extend outside support, sources said. But it is keen on the Speakers post.

 Munda, who came to Delhi early today to participate in the chief ministers conference on internal security, continued to put up a brave face and said he was ready to prove majority in the Assembly.

 Definitely, I will, he said, when asked if he would be able to prove his majority. Whenever... I am ready to prove it. Everything will come up on the floor of the House.

 The BJPs central leadership is not trying too hard to help Munda as he faces the biggest crisis in his 17 months in power. Party president Rajnath Singh is said to have washed his hands of the crisis. You handle things the way you want to, he is reported to have told Munda.

 Explaining the partys stand, a senior leader said: The fragile coalition in Jharkhand would become even more unstable under UPA. The government would not last beyond six months. At the end of the six months, we would have transferred all negative factors to the ruling alliance and face elections with a clean slate.

 The only worry is the psychological impact of losing a state and one where the RSS has a strong network. For Rajnath, particularly, losing Jharkhand would be a big setback considering that he had built his reputation on the victory in the state.

 An unstable government is what the Congress is worrying about, too. So though it is in the thick of the drama, in public the party is keeping a distance from the developments.

 A senior Congress leader said the ideal scenario would be if the Munda government fell and Presidents rule was imposed. 

 Admitting that no party wanted an immediate election, sources said six months of central rule would give the Congress, which is ruling in Delhi, a chance to break the power and patronage networks created by the BJP. Then we will be ready to face an election.

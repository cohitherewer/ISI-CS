 Doctors suspend quota fight

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Aug. 25: Doctors and medical students in the capital, who have been leading the anti-quota battle, have decided to lay down arms, at least for now. 

 We have achieved our immediate aim, said Vishal Patnaik of Maulana Azad Medical College, after the bill was sent to a standing committee.

 But away from the glare of the television cameras, they counted their wounded literally and in terms of morale admitting that they needed to rework their strategy.

 Doctors from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) and Maulana Azad college are going back to work, at least till the winter session of Parliament. So are their counterparts from other medical colleges in the capital. All of them had taken mass casual leave for the second day in a row today. 

 Students from IIT Delhi, Jawaharlal Nehru University, Delhi University and Indraprastha University have not called off their protest officially but admit their combined numbers would not fill more than a few police buses.

 Since the bill to grant 27 per cent reservation in higher education to OBCs was introduced on the last day of the monsoon session and can now come up only in the next session, the protesters say they have more time to get other students and doctors from around the country to join in. 

 Till then, we are calling off the protests, said Vinod Patro, president of the AIIMS Resident Doctors Association.

 But among themselves, the medicos are beginning to accept the quota as final. The main reason most of us are here is the creamy layer being included among those who will benefit from the reservation, said Rajiv, a first-year MBBS student at AIIMS.

 Those leading the protests also admit the focus of their fight during the winter session will not be over the bill, but the creamy layer. 

 Unlike the job quota, the proposed education quota will apply to all OBCs, including the financially well-off, if the bill is passed in its current form. Even if the bill goes through, the creamy layer must not benefit, said Anil Sharma of the AIIMS Resident Doctors Association. 

 Yesterdays shadow when over 200 doctors, mainly from AIIMS, were arrested and given a strict warning by police hung over todays plans to march to Parliament.

 Quite frankly, most of us are pretty scared after the kind of warning we received yesterday, a usually vocal AIIMS resident doctor said.

 Instead, around 3,000 protesters marched peacefully from Jantar Mantar to Parliament Street for a sit-in a couple of hundred metres from Parliament.

 Around 300 IIT students, however, had other ideas breaking ranks to block traffic at Janpath and then the inner ring of Connaught Place, before being hauled into police vans. Those detained were released in the evening.

 Calcutta confusion

 Medical students in Calcutta had not decided till late tonight whether or not to suspend protests. Yesterday, many of them had taken casual leave. Today, National Medical College students took out a rally and those at the Medical College and Hospital held a sit-in.

 Many students in both colleges skipped classes. Medical students in Burdwan and Bankura and National Institute of Technology students in Durgapur also boycotted classes.

 But the students, who have been protesting under the banned of Youth for Equality, sounded undecided about the protests.

 We are planning to call off our strike from tomorrow. However, our demand that the bill should be reviewed by an apolitical body still holds, said Supriya Basu, a member. 

 But Bharat Bhusan Shukla, another member, said: We are still discussing the issue.

 Mumbai, Feb. 20: The anti-corruption bureau today arrested suspended sub-inspector Daya Nayak and the prosecution said it would summon as a witness Amitabh Bachchan who attended the inauguration of a school allegedly set up by the encounter specialist. 

 Nayak and his associate Rajendra Padte are accused in a disproportionate assets case. The two surrendered before the court in keeping with a Supreme Court order. 

 The apex court had refused to interfere with a Bombay High Court order rejecting Nayak and Padtes bail plea. 

 It asked the two to surrender before the trial court in Mumbai and told the judge to hear their plea the day they surrender.

 Nayaks wife Komal was accused of helping him launder his wealth, but was granted bail by the high court.

 Additional sessions judge S.P. Mahajan today rejected Nayak and Padtes bail plea on the ground that a prima facie case was made out against them.

 The two were taken into custody by the anti-corruption bureau. 

 The defence moved an application for bail and arguments lasted the whole day.

 The two will be produced in court tomorrow for remand.

 Nayak allegedly donated about Rs 1 crore to Radha Nayak Government High School, set up by a trust in Yeennehole in his native village in Udupi district of Karnataka.

 Several Bollywood celebrities had attended the inauguration of the school in 2000, the prosecution said. 

 All those who were at the function would be summoned by the anti-corruption bureau to record their statements as witnesses, public prosecutor R.V. Kiny said. 

 Nayak had denied the charge that he donated Rs 1 crore to the school and submitted a list of donors during an earlier inquiry. The prosecution claimed that some of the names on the list were fake. 

 For the first time in court, the prosecution today mentioned the extortion angle against Nayak, saying a case was pending against him in which he is alleged to have amassed wealth disproportionate to his known sources of income through extortion.

 The anti-corruption bureau said although it was not concerned with Nayaks extortion activities, it needed to interrogate this angle to find out about the source of his wealth.

 There are some cases registered under the Indian Penal Code against this accused (Nayak). These cases indicate the source of his income, Kiny told the court. 

 The public prosecutor asked how the former sub-inspector could amass assets worth over Rs 40 lakh when he was drawing a monthly salary of barely Rs 10,000 and his wife was not working.

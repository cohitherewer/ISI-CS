 Face net for BSF in fight against enemy No. 1

 - Officer 

invents malaria shield

 BSF personnel patrol the Bangladesh border in south Tripura

Aizawl, July 30: For those who guard the Indo-Bangladesh 

border in the Northeast, enemy number one is not the gun-wielding 

soldier on the other side but a tiny, winged creature that does not believe in 

boundaries.

 When A. Jayapaul, a Border Security Force officer formerly in charge of the Gokulnagar sector headquarters of the Tripura-Cachar-Mizoram frontier, saw 40 to 50 of his boys die of malaria in a single year, he decided they needed special protection from mosquitoes while on duty. Since most repellent creams dont work for long, the commandant came up with the innovative face net, a simple invention that has since become a part of the BSFs survival kit across the remote border posts of the region.

 Jayapaul, who is now the additional deputy inspector-general of the BSF in Mizoram, won a cash reward and the coveted Commendation Roll for his invention. He was also adjudged the most innovative BSF officer in a nation-wide contest in which devices designed to benefit border troops were evaluated on the basis of usability. Several private companies have approached me with business propositions and suggested that I should patent my invention. I havent been able to do so because it is, after all, an invention of the BSF, Jayapaul told The Telegraph.

 The face net is made of special material, stitched along the edges of a jawans helmet or jungle hat and reaches below the shoulder. At the lower end, the net has rows of black iron washers to increase its weight. The washers, resembling rings, ensure that the veil stays in place close to the body instead of hanging loose.

 Jayapaul said the incidence of malaria among BSF personnel deployed in the region had declined since they started using the face net. The terrain we encounter in the Northeast is so rugged that it is impossible to rush someone who is seriously ill to a hospital by road. The only option is to airlift the person. So we need all the protection we can get in these mosquito-infested areas, the BSF officer said.

 Jayapaul is now working on a body net which, he promises, will be several times better than the face net.

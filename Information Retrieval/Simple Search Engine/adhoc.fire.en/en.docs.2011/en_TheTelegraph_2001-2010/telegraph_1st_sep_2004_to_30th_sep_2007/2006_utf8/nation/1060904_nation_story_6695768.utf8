 Nod to prosecute RAW double agent

 MANAN KUMAR

 New Delhi, Sept. 3: The 

 home ministry has given its permission in principle to prosecute 

 Ravinder Singh, a Research and Analysis Wing officer who 

 was allegedly found to be working for the US intelligence 

 more than two years ago. 

 According to official sources, 

 the CBI has initiated chargesheet proceedings against the 

 former RAW joint secretary under sections of the Official 

 Secrets Act. 

 Once the chargesheet is filed, 

 the CBI would give Singh, whose whereabouts are unknown, 

 a chance to appear in court. If he does not turn up, a non-bailable 

 warrant can be issued. If that does not help, he could be 

 declared a proclaimed offender and an Interpol red-corner 

 notice brought out, said a senior official. 

 The CBI investigation will take 

 into account the findings of RAWs internal inquiry 

 against its former officer. 

 Singh, who went missing in May 

 14, 2004, was a major from the army on deputation with the 

 RAW. He chose to be permanently absorbed there after completing 

 his deputation. 

 He was dismissed by the President 

 in June 2004 under Article 311(2) (c) of the Constitution. 

 There is no provision for a judicial review of the decision.

 Intelligence agencies believe 

 Singh fled to America via Nepal with the help of his US 

 handlers in late May 2004 after he was tipped off that he 

 was being watched by RAWs counter-intelligence wing 

 for over a month. Although no definite leads are available, 

 he is believed to be living in the US since then. 

 The former RAW joint secretary 

 came under suspicion after a slip by a US diplomat 

 working under cover at the American embassy. According to 

 the sources, the US official, on a routine liaison session 

 with RAW officers, happened to mention Singhs name 

 which made the senior intelligence sleuths suspicious. 

 The RAW then began a counter-surveillance 

 operation against Singh. The counter-intelligence unit began 

 tapping his phones and a spy camera was fitted in his office 

 at the RAW headquarters. 

 The spy camera has reportedly 

 shown Singh photocopying top-secret documents and other 

 operational details of the countrys external intelligence 

 agency. 

 During his tenure at RAW, Singh 

 worked as head of its office in Amritsar and then as a field 

 operative in West Asia and west Europe. Later, he held charge 

 of the Southeast Asia portfolio as a joint secretary. 

 In Amritsar, his main task was 

 collecting trans-border human intelligence about the Pakistan 

 military and the training of Sikh terrorists by the ISI 

 on Pakistani territory. 

 In West Asia, he monitored the 

 activities of terrorist groups while in west Europe he focused 

 on Sikh terrorist elements operating there.

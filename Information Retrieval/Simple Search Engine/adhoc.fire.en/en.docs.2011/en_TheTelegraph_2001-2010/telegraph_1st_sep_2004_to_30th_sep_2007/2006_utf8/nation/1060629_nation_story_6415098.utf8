The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 IT demand beyond city

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, June 28: With land prices around New Town going through the roof, the Bengal government will acquire several hundred acres for IT parks elsewhere in the state.

 Nine companies will be housed on a 30-acre plot in Siliguri. NRI businessman Purnendu Chatterjee has also sought 200 acres there for a biotech-cum-IT hub.

 There are many takers for plots outside Calcutta because the land is cheaper, urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya said. 

 IT minister Debesh Das met him this evening and discussed the land requirement, which includes around 500 acres in Baruipur, South 24-Parganas.

 Although the Baruipur proposal could not be finalised today, Bhattacharyas department has agreed to allot 100 acres at Dankuni and 10 acres at Nonadanga, off EM Bypass, for IT parks. 

 Land acquisition has been a sensitive issue in South 24-Parganas. The go-slow on Baruipur possibly, stems from that.

 Benny Santoso of the Indonesia-based Salim Group is scheduled to meet chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee in the third week of July. 

 Bhattacharya said Santoso would furnish detailed project reports for the township and the 100-km expressway from Barasat in North 24-Parganas to Raichak in South. 

 The Salims also want to build a 2-km, Rs 2,000-crore bridge across the Hooghly from Raichak to Kukrahati. Chief secretary A.K. Deb today okayed the scope of work for its pre-feasibility study. 

 The South 24-Parganas headquarters will be shifted to Baruipur. The government is working on the acquisition of another 150 acres for that. 

 Land and land reforms minister Abdur Rezzak Mollah, commerce and industries minister Nirupam Sen, Bhattacharya and local CPM MPs Sujan Chakraborty and Shamik Lahiry discussed the modalities today.

 Dehra Dun, Sept. 8: Sensing a multi-dimensional crisis in the agrarian sector, the BJP today came out with a crucial amendment to its stand on special economic zones (SEZs) and land acquisition for development along with a resolution on rural credit, farmers suicides and loans.

 A militant supporter of SEZs, the BJP today added riders to the concept. Former party president M. Venkaiah Naidu, who drafted the resolution, said SEZs have to be accompanied by special concessions for affected families.

 The document lists five terms for allotment to SEZs:

 Irrigated land should not be acquired

 Families should be given market rates for their land

 Affected people should be made partners in the project

 Special educational opportunities should be provided for children of these families

 Employment needs of the affected families should be met.

 The social and economic consequences of land acquisition on a farmer are adverse. He loses land, livelihood and employment. Land acquisition laws need to be reviewed to provide for actual market compensation, employment in projects and preferential allotment of plots for being partners in development, Naidu said.

 The BJP resolution also seeks medical insurance for farmers and immediate steps to improve the precarious state of rural credit.

 The party demanded a joint parliamentary committee on farmers suicides to evolve a holistic strategy to tackle what Naidu described as a multi-dimensional crisis.

 The BJP urges the government to act fast on the five suggestions made by the National Commission on Farmers such as risk-stabiliser fund, farmer-centric minimum support price and market intervention scheme and include them in the 11th Five Year Plan, the resolution says. 

 It contains a short chapter on the World Trade Organisation, saying the stalemate is a result of agricultural subsidies given by developed countries. 

 These subsidies are hurting the interests of the Indian farmer. Cheaper products of developed countries are invading the global market. There are no takers for the surplus from developing countries. They (the developed countries) dump their surplus in the domestic market that is depressing farm prices locally.

 Agriculture had been a bone of contention at WTO negotiations with developing countries demanding a reduction in subsidies that make their farm products uncompetitive in the international market.

 The BJP also slammed the UPA governments decision to import 35 lakh tonnes of wheat to augment buffer stocks to ensure food security.

 Delhi funds after duty cut

 BISWAJIT ROY

 Calcutta, June 27: Having reduced the stamp duty on property transfers, the government is hopeful of getting from the Centre the much-awaited funds under the Jawahar National Urban Renewal Mission. 

 Various development projects under the mission had been proposed in Calcutta and other urban areas like Asansol in Burdwan, Uluberia in Howrah and Bansberia in Hooghly, but their takeoff was stalled because among Delhis conditions were the stamp duty slash and phaseout of the urban land ceiling law.

 In his budget speech this year, state finance minister Asim Dasgupta proposed to reduce stamp duty from 10 per cent in Calcutta and Howrah and 8 per cent in other urban areas to a uniform 6 per cent.

 The Centre had asked for reduction of stamp duty to 5 per cent over a period of seven years. Although Bengals stamp duty rates for urban areas were low, we decided to slash them further. I hope now it (the Centre) will cough up the money for our projects, municipal affairs and urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya told The Telegraph.

 Bhattacharya, who will meet Union urban development ministry officials tomorrow, is expecting 35 per cent of the funds for the projects proposed under the mission.

 Bengal had not received any funds under the mission in the last financial year, apparently for failing to fulfil the Centres conditions. 

 The conditions were put forward at the insistence of funding agencies like the Asian Development Bank and World Bank, Bhattacharya said in a manner of complaining. 

 The mission, to be implemented over seven years, replaced the megacity scheme in November 2005.

 In a letter to union urban development minister Jaipal Reddy, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattcharjee had recently assured the stamp duty cut and the setting up of an expert committee to examine the urban land ceiling act. 

 We want social control over urban land to avoid concentration of ownership in a few hands. However, the state government will decide its course of action on the basis of the expert committees recommendations, the minister said.

 Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority chief executive officer P.R. Baviskar said the Bengal government has mooted 57 urban development projects worth Rs 1,017 crore under the mission. 

 Of these, 15 projects worth Rs 400 crore are likely to be cleared by the end of this year. The detailed project reports for nine have already been submitted to the Centre. The remaining six will be furnished by August.

 Gandhi catfight in House

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Sonia 

 and Maneka

 New Delhi, Aug. 22: The catfight in the Nehru-Gandhi clan spilled into Parliament today with Maneka Gandhi mounting an attack on sister-in-law Sonia Gandhi in the oil-for-food scam.

 The Lok Sabha had to be adjourned as Maneka flung barbs at the Congress chief amid slogan-shouting from both sides. Maneka is smarting from a CBI case for cheating against her, which she has alleged was registered at Sonias behest.

 The BJP let Maneka do most of the talking. On the other side, P. Chidambaram, Kapil Sibal and P.R. Das Munshi led a hostile pack from the treasury benches that forced an adjournment after Maneka linked Sonia with the scandal.

 CPI leader Gurudas Dasgupta started the debate, blaming the Congress for not dealing honestly with the issue. His query was why did the other members of the Congress delegation not inform the high command of what Natwar Singh and his son did in Iraq?

 Gurudas directed most of his queries at Sibal. Why are you constantly looking at me as if I am responsible for the scandal? Sibal demanded.

 I look at you because yours is the most beautiful face in that crowd, Gurudas replied.

 That explains a lot of things about you, Sibal retorted.

 Maneka took up from where Gurudas left off. The basic question Justice Pathak should have answered is did Natwar and his son use the Congress to make money or were they used to make money by the Congress?

 Her theory was that everyone in India connected to the scandal belonged to the Congress. The Congress president took Natwar to meet the Iraqi Vice-President. She authorised the delegation. The other members of the delegation A.R. Antulay and P. Shiv Shankar were senior Congressmen. 

 Why would they not inform the Congress president about what Natwar did in Iraq? Why did he meet the Iraqi oil minister if it was just a goodwill delegation? What goodwill was he spreading with the oil minister of Iraq?

 Maneka said the delegation followed months of preparation. 

 And yet, there was no itinerary. They were there for four or five days but no itinerary was made. Why, because all of them knew, the Congress president knew what was going to happen. They were there to make money, she said.

 Jammu, Oct. 12: A 14-year-old student, Jeetinder Singh, killed himself after he was humiliated by the school principal for failing to pay the fees.

 Taunted and beaten up by the principal of Harminder Public School, the Class IX student hanged himself at his Preet Nagar home yesterday, his family and friends said. 

 On Tuesday, we were in school for the biology exam. But the principal did not allow us to sit for the exam and forced us to leave as our fees for a few months had not been cleared. He also harassed and physically assaulted my brother, Jeetinders younger brother Gagandeep, who was also his classmate, said.

 Their father is a driver for the Archaeological Survey of India and his mother a housewife. The family finds it hard to make ends meet.

 The suicide has sparked widespread protests in the town. The principal, Kirtan Singh, who had gone into hiding yesterday, was arrested today.

 Jeetinders classmates said he felt humiliated by the principals bashing and went into a depression. The humiliation did him in, said one of his close friends at school.

 The station house officer of Gandhi Nagar police station, Gyan Chand Sharma, said an FIR had been registered against Kirtan under Section 306 of the Ranbir Penal Code for physical assault.

 He said police had found no suicide note and the case was registered after recording the statements of Jeetinders father and brother.

 Local residents, including Jeetinders family members and relatives, blocked the national highway near the police station and demanded cancellation of the schools registration. 

 The education ministry should cancel its registration, said Jeetinders relative Rajinder Singh. 

 They alleged that the principal, who is a government employee, is not authorised to run a private school.

 Earlier, student activists and residents forced the school administration to close down the institution. 

 Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad activists, led by state president Ranjit Sharma, demanded that a murder case be lodged against the principal. 

 Hundreds of students from various colleges and schools gathered outside the school and protested against the principals behaviour.

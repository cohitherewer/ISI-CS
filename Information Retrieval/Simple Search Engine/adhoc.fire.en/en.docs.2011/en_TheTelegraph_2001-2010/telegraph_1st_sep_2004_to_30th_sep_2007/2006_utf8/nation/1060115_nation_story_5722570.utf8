 New Delhi, Jan. 14: Widening the Kashmir dialogue beyond the Hurriyat Conference, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today met separatist leader Sajjad Lone.

 Lone, who is the chairman of the Peoples Conference and son of slain leader Abdul Gani Lone, said after the one-hour meeting that the widening of the talks the PMO has taken up should be institutionalised because it is the civilised way and is better than violence.

 He is the first separatist leader outside the Hurriyat that the Centre has reached out to.

 This process of dialogue on Kashmir is very long and most important right now is the process itself, and it should continue. I spoke with the PM and told him something in confidentiality. It would be wrong for me to divulge that here. However, the PM was very positive and he assured us that the process would continue, said Lone.

 Sources said the next in line could be leaders like Shabbir Shah and Yasin Malik, after which a second round of talks with the moderate faction of the Hurriyat led by Mirwaiz Umer Farooq might be held.

 PMO spokesperson Sanjay Baru said: The Prime Minister said his intention is to reach out to the hearts and minds of all through the dialogue process. He recognises that there are groups which are outside the electoral process. Meetings will be called with the other groups and this group in future.

 Besides Singh, national security adviser M.K. Narayanan, principal secretary T.K.A. Nair, home secretary V.K. Duggal and interlocutor on Kashmir N.N. Vohra were present during the talks.

 Slighted CPM turns riot gun on Mulayam

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 11: The CPM today broke its silence over deteriorating law and order in Uttar Pradesh, demanding a high-level judicial inquiry into the role of police during the recent Aligarh communal violence.

 Sources said the demand is a reflection of the CPMs annoyance over Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadavs initiative to announce a third front independent of Left parties.

 This could be the beginning of a new phase of strained ties between the Left and its close ally, the Samajwadi Party, the sources said.

 The CPM, which has so far kept mum despite the riots, asked Mulayam to take immediate steps to ensure peace and harmony in the state.

 In the recent period, a number of incidents of communal provocation and violence have occurred in UP, the communal riots in Mau being one of the major ones.

 The state government has not taken these incidents seriously and the administration has been lax in responding firmly to communal activities, the CPM politburo said in a statement.

 The CPM claimed the riots began at a spot having a history of trouble and if police and district administration had firmly intervened, vested interests could not have succeeded in spreading violence.

 Firm action needs to be taken against those who have perpetrated or instigated the violence. The role of police at various levels needs to be investigated by a high-level judicial team, the politburo said.

 This is the first time that the CPM has made a frontal attack on the worsening law and order in Uttar Pradesh.

 According to sources, the change in the CPMs attitude could get more defined if the Samajwadi Party continues trying to carve a niche for itself along with the Telugu Desam, and minus the Left parties.

 The Samajwadi Party had recently joined hands with the Desam and vowed to form a third front by aligning with regional parties attached neither to the Congress-led UPA nor the BJP-led NDA.

 The initiative has exposed the CPM to accusations that despite being outside the UPA, it is playing second fiddle to the Congress. What has irked the CPM most is the fact that its ally has pushed it into an uncomfortable spot when it is busy with elections in Bengal and Kerala, where the Congress is its main opponent.

 The CPM tried to downplay the third front initiative, saying it would not work in the current political scenario.

 This third force is based upon numbers (in Parliament). Its a cut-and-paste (proposal), which is not possible in the 14th Lok Sabha, CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury told reporters.

 He said there was no need to set up a third alternative to the Congress and BJP. An alternative opposed to communalism but not based merely on numbers will work.

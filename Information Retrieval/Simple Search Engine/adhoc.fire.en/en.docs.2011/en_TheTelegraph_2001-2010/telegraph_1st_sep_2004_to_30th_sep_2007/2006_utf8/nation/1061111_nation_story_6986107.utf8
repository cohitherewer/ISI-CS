 After blockbusters, a tap from taxman

 Mumbai, Nov. 10: 

 Munnabhai and Krrish may have met their match 

 in the tax collector.

 As part of a drive to make Bollywood account for the hundreds of crores it deals in, the Maharashtra government has sent notices to nine film-makers under a star tax levied in May 2005. The recipients, who include the likes of Yash Chopra, Karan Johar and Rakesh Roshan, must pay 0.25 per cent stamp duty on all business deals exceeding Rs 1 lakh since May 7, 2005.

 The notices are the second batch sent under the new law, the first being despatched in August to 13 actors and actresses, including Amitabh and Abhishek Bachchan, Aamir and Shah Rukh Khan, Aishwarya Rai, Rani Mukherjee and Hrithik Roshan.

 Although the levy which also applies to sports personalities is rather low at Rs 250 per Rs 1 lakh, Bollywood has been upset about the transparency it would impose on the industry. The tax has had to wait for the collector of stamps to set up an enforcement wing before it could kick in.

 The stamp duty is to be paid on all contracts between producers, directors, distributors, actors, actresses, lyricists, technicians and other crew members. This includes deals covering music copyright, satellite rights and distribution.

 Many of the recipients have delivered hits this year or are set to release big-budget films.

 Chopra is preparing for the release of Dhoom-2 with a never-before cast of Hrithik, Aishwarya, Abhishek and Bipasha Basu. Rajashri Production, whose boss Ajit Barjatya is one of the nine notified, released Vivah today.

 Karan Johars Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna, Rakesh Roshans Krrish and Vidhu Vinod Chopras Lage Raho Munnabhai are among the years biggest hits while J.P. Dutta has just released Umrao Jaan.

 Ram Gopal Varma, Subhash Ghai and Adlabs owner and producer Manmohan Shetty are the other recipients.

 Adlabs has signed a three-film deal with Hrithik for a reported Rs 45 crore, making him the highest paid Bollywood star. For Shetty, its been a busy year: Anil Ambanis ADAG has bought a stake in Adlabs, and Shetty is financing Varmas remake of Sholay apart from adding another multiplex to his kitty.

 The notices, dated November 3, warned the nine that if they didnt respond within eight days of receipt, the documents of the deals could be seized. Failure to pay up could bring fines.

 None of the nine was available for comment. P.K. Gupta, an associate of Barjatya, said: Ajitji is busy with the release of Vivah today, but well reply to the notice in due time. Our contracts are above board and well have no problems.

 Film-maker Mahesh Bhatt said: I believe the film community is talking about fighting this move.

 Among the 13 stars notified in August were John Abraham, Saif Ali Khan, Kareena Kapoor, Preity Zinta, Priyanka Chopra and Juhi Chawla.

 The government has sent notices to 35 brand ambassadors in all, including Sunil Gavaskar and Sachin Tendulkar, who recently signed up with Canon. Most are complying, an official said.

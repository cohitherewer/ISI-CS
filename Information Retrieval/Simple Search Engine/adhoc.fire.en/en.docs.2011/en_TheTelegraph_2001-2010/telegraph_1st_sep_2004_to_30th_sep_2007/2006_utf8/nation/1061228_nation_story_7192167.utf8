 Temple saved by a whisker

 Rameshwaram, Dec. 27: A small shrine off the dazzling blue ocean here has been a big saving grace for locals.

 The Kothandaramar temple, on the south of this pilgrim island, is revered as the place where Vibhishana was anointed king of Lanka after his brother Ravana was felled by Ram, sources said, citing a wall painting inside that testifies to the coronation.

 But the shrine was nearly lost to the Sethusamudram Ship Canal. The temple was threatened by an alignment of the canal. Marks on black stones had been made. We could have lost a heritage temple and the locals their livelihood, a source said.

 Local fishermen and small traders who live off tourism coming to the shrine implored the powers that be in Delhi and the canal alignment was changed, the source said.

 The Kothandaramar temple on way to lands end at Dhanushkodi has a Calcutta connection. Philanthropist Ramkumar Bangur renovated it in 1976-78.

 Relief over the shrine doesnt exactly make this pilgrim island an oasis of peace. Discontent simmers over the swarms of Lankan refugees, and the way the state government has gone out of its way to pamper them.

 No government in Sri Lanka will hand a separate state to the LTTE, as it has been demanding. It is a vain fight. But refugees keep flocking here, says a local trader.

 The refugees are making their presence felt here in the cluster of stalls on the road to the Rameshwaram temple. They peddle puja items, black dhotis and copra for devotees heading to Keralas Sabarimala temple.

 The refugees are well looked after. The Tamil Nadu government has been selling rice at 57 paise a kg in their camps. Officials at the Mandapam camp, among the largest in the state, have also sent plans for a Rs 2-crore hospital to be constructed with assistance from the World Bank. 

 We have an obligation to the Tamil refugees, but how long can our government sustain their stay here at such a huge expense to the exchequer? asked Congress MLA Hasan Ali. Both Rameshwaram and Mandapam fall under his Ramanathapuram constituency.

 He criticised the LTTE for killing its own people and forcing innocent Tamils to flee, saying the refugee problem will end only if Sri Lankas ethnic issue is resolved to the satisfaction of all, including the Tamil Muslims there.

 Hasan, among the guests of Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapakse during his recent visit to Delhi, advocates a more constructive approach to the refugee tangle.

 Some political parties in Tamil Nadu feel the recent death of LTTE ideologue Anton Balasingham in London could make things difficult for the Tigers, but Hasan feels nobody can be sure whether LTTE chief Prabhakaran will soften.

 For a practical solution to the ethnic issue, the Sri Lankan government must have a cordial relationship with the Tamil Nadu regime, apart from ties with the Government of India. I suggested this to Rajapakse, he says.

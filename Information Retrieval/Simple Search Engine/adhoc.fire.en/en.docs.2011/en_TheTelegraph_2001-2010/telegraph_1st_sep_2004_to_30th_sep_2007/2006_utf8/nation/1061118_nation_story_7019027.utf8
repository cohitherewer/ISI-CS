 Double hurdle to polio fight

 No Remedy?

 New Delhi. Nov. 17: Poor sanitation and overcrowded living conditions lower the efficacy of the oral polio vaccine (OPV) in parts of India, international health experts said today, vindicating what an Indian virologist has been asserting for 30 years.

 In a study to fathom polios persistence in India despite multiple doses of OPV, researchers from India, the UK and WHO have identified poor sanitation and overcrowding as key obstacles to eradicating polio.

 These conditions make it easy for the polio virus to spread through water contaminated by faeces and decrease the efficacy of the standard trivalent OPV, they said in a report today in the journal Science. Trivalent OPV has live, but weakened, versions of each of the three types of the polio virus.

 Although children in India have received more doses of the vaccine than children in other countries, polio has persisted and surged this year with 520 confirmed cases, compared to 66 cases last year.

 The outbreak this year is clustered in western Uttar Pradesh. In Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, children under five have received on average 15 doses of the vaccine, compared with 10 doses in the rest of India.

 Everyone has been asking with so much vaccination, why is polio still around? Nicholas Grassly, an infectious disease expert at the Imperial College in London and the principal investigator, said.

 This vaccine has worked well in the rest of India. Its important to acknowledge and understand its low efficacy in western Uttar Pradesh, Grassly said. 

 The study analysed over 96,000 cases of polio-like paralysis in children since 1997 to find out what factors most strongly influence polio persistence.

 In unsanitary and overcrowded conditions, such as those prevalent in western Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, a child is likely to have other stomach viruses and diarrhoea which can prevent trivalent OPV from working effectively, it said.

 The study team members said their findings corroborate earlier work by T. Jacob John, former head of virology at the Christian Medical College in Vellore, who had first highlighted the low efficacy of OPV during the 1970s.

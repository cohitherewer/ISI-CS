 Medicos, jawans fight on train

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, Jan. 16: Medical students and Provincial Armed Constaulary recruits clashed on a train last night, sparking protests that paralysed rail services and hospitals in the state.

 Eighteen students returning to Lucknow from Meerut after post-graduate entrance tests boarded the Nauchandi Express around 11 pm to find their reserved seats occupied by 15 PAC recruits. The jawans, also going to Lucknow, refused to vacate the seats. 

 A row erupted as the train left Meerut and turned violent in the S-3 compartment when some jawans misbehaved with women students. The PAC jawans were drunk and they attempted to molest a woman, said a student who reached Lucknow today.

 When the Allahabad-bound train reached Moradabad around 1.30 am, more PAC jawans boarded it and began hitting and abusing the students. When they resisted, at least 10 were thrown out of the train. 

 Infuriated, students and other passengers halted all trains entering and leaving Moradabad. The students and jawans fought a pitched battle. Stones and bottles were hurled and at least 12 medical students and jawans were injured, said Amitav Yash, the additional superintendent of Moradabad. 

 Trains from Lucknow to Delhi had to be stopped at Bareilly, Badaun and Saharanpur. Nauchandi Express left Moradabad at 9.30 am today.

 In Lucknow, rail traffic was disrupted in the morning when hundreds of medical students squatted on the tracks. Medical colleges in Allahabad and Kanpur remained shut. 

 In Patna, railway minister Lalu Prasad demanded the dismissal of the errant PAC recruits. There appears to be no fault on the part of the doctors, he said.

 Hernia gaffe on toddler

 New Delhi, Dec. 13 (PTI): Surgeons at a government hospital here have mistakenly conducted a congenital hernia operation on a four-year-old boy who had gone there to remove an extra finger on his right hand.

 The mix-up happened at Ambedkar Hospital yesterday when Kapil Brijpal, son of a milkman, was allegedly taken to a wrong operation theatre where another child was supposed to undergo a hernia operation.

 Kapils father has filed a complaint with police alleging negligence. No case has been registered so far.

 We have forwarded the complaint to the medical board of the Delhi government. Further action will depend on the basis of the report of the board, deputy commissioner of police (north-west district) Manish Aggarwal said.

 The boys father alleged that the doctors made him sign a consent form while the operation for hernia was on claiming that the boy has been diagnosed with the ailment.

 He claimed that his son was mistakenly taken to a hernia surgery room instead of the orthopaedic operation theatre.

 BJP savours Uma setback

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Bhopal, May 6: Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan won the Budhini byelection today, trouncing his Congress rival Raj Kumar Patel by 36,525 votes.

 Chauhan bagged 66,689 votes against the 30,164 secured by Patel.

 The victory is all the more satisfying for Chauhan as he relegated Gulzar Singh Markam, the candidate backed by expelled BJP leader Uma Bharti, to the third place. Markam, who represented the regional Gondwana Gantantra Party, managed only 7,000-odd votes and forfeited his deposit. 

 Markams claim to represent tribal aspirations fell flat with his humiliating loss. But more important, the defeat was a virtual slap in Umas face whose sustained campaign failed to shore up Markams prospects. 

 Uma had addressed over 40 meetings and spent five days camping in Budhini and claimed Madhya Pradesh as her fiefdom. She said the Chauhan government was surviving at her mercy.

 After launching her new political outfit, the Bharatiya Janshakti Party, on April 30, Uma had predicted that her party would form the next government. So the Budhini outcome should come as a jolt. Worse, not a single BJP MLA has joined Umas camp yet, though she had claimed the support of a majority of BJP legislators.

 The Congress, too, is breathing easy, as it feared losing the second spot to Umas nominee. Congress leaders like Digvijay Singh, Jyotiraditya Scindia, Suresh Pachauri and Jamuna Devi spent considerable time campaigning in Budhini. They believed that if Umas candidate performed better than the Congresss, the main Opposition party could have been projected as a third factor in state politics. 

 We draw relief from the fact that the main contest continues to be between us and the BJP, a Congress leader said. Chauhans victory was a foregone conclusion, the leader added. 

 However, for Chauhan, the road to the Assembly was a bit bumpy. Taking cognisance of poll-related malpractices, the Election Commission had deferred the bypoll from April 24 to May 3. But Chauhan took the snub in his stride. He ordered over 20 ministers and BJP functionaries to leave Budhini. He returned vehicles and publicity materials while embarking on a 163- kilometre padyatra across the constituency.

 All eyes are now on the Vidisha Lok Sabha seat, which is set to be vacated by Chauhan. It is still not clear who would replace Chauhan, though the names of his wife Sandhya and Maneka Gandhis son Varun are doing the rounds. There were also unconfirmed reports that Uma was thinking of jumping into the fray.

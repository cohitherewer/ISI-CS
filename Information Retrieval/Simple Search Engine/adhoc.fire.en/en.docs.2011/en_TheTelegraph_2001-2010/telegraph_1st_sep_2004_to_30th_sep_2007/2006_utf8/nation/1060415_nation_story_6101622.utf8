The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Much-loved 

 leader from the old world

 Obituary

 Much 

 about A.B.A. Ghani Khan Choudhurys persona and politics 

 belonged to an old world. Like his grand home on the outskirts 

 of Malda town, that dominated a rural landscape dotted by 

 mud huts and mango groves. Nearing 80 and struck down by 

 ill health for many years, he still remained the lord of 

 his place. 

 His political style was often 

 unorthodox; he had little patience with the niceties of 

 rules and procedures. If he decided that something was the 

 right thing to do, he would brook no hurdles, no criticism. 

 But he was a big-hearted man who would not do things for 

 petty personal gains. 

 His politics was not very different 

 from the way feudal lords ruled over their subjects. But 

 Barkatda, as he was known to his people in Malda and his 

 partymen everywhere else, struck his own kind of balance 

 between the old world and the demands of mass politics. 

 No wonder he was elected to the Lok Sabha from Malda eight 

 consecutive times from 1980. 

 Not that he had a free run of 

 the elections. At least on one occasion, he came close to 

 a shock defeat at the hands of his Marxist rival. The political 

 reality showed that even Malda was changing, but the myth 

 of Barkatda endured beyond the electoral details. 

 It would be incorrect, though, 

 to portray him as the big small-town man. He loved Malda 

 and was loved by the people there. And, he made no secret 

 of using his political stature and the resources at his 

 command for Maldas benefit. Whether as the irrigation 

 minister in Siddhartha Shankar Rays cabinet or as 

 Union minister for coal and then railways, he would do anything 

 and everything to try and get projects to be located in 

 and around Malda. 

 But Choudhury made it big in Congress 

 politics in Bengal and, for a brief while, in Delhi as well. 

 Not many Congress leaders in Bengal enjoyed the confidence 

 of Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi the way Choudhury did. 

 At the height of his political career he was seen by Congressmen 

 as one party leader in recent decades who had done the most 

 for Bengal. 

 The metro in Calcutta may not 

 have been entirely his idea, but, as railway minister, he 

 not only gave it the first push but also dealt firmly with 

 a sceptical bureaucracy in order to get funds for the project. 

 For all his eccentricities, Choudhury 

 was perhaps the most loved Congress leader of Bengal of 

 recent times. Several other leaders perhaps had better leadership 

 qualities or better understanding of political strategies. 

 But, few of them enjoyed the unquestioning loyalty of their 

 followers that Barkatda did.

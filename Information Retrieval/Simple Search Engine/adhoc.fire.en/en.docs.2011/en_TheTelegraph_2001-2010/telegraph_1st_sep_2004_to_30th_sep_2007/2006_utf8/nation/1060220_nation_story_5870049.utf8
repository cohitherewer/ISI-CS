 Blast in soft drink crates

 OUR CORRESPONDENT AND PTI

 Ahmedabad, Feb. 19: At least 25 people were injured in an RDX explosion in Ahmedabad railway station in the wee hours today, prompting authorities to sound an alert across the city.

 Forensic tests have proved that the material used was RDX. However, we do not know the exact quantity of the high-quality explosive used to trigger the blast, Gujarat director-general of police A.K. Bhargava said. 

 An explosive device placed among crates of soft drink bottles went off on platform No. 2 around 1.45 am shortly after the departure of two trains.

 The blast ripped through a phone booth, shattered glass panes more than 20 feet away , besides ripping apart the asbestos roof of the platform. 

 There were few people on the platform when the explosion took place. The owner of the phone booth had a narrow escape as he had gone to have tea. 

 Train traffic to the station was suspended for a few hours but resumed at 4.30 am.

 Gujarat home minister Amit Shah said close scrutiny by the forensic and bomb disposal teams proved that a timer device was used to trigger the powerful blast.

 Bhargava said no person or outfit had claimed responsibility for the blast. However, it was an act of terror as it created panic and fear among people. Detailed investigation is on, the police chief added.

 Divisional railway manager Arvind Khare said security has been stepped up at the station. There were no intelligence reports about the possibility of such an explosion, he added.

 The 25 injured people have been admitted to a hospital. The condition of three is said to be serious. Among those injured were four railway officials. Two boys working as tea vendors turned deaf.

 Khare said those injured would be given compensation according to the nature of their injuries.

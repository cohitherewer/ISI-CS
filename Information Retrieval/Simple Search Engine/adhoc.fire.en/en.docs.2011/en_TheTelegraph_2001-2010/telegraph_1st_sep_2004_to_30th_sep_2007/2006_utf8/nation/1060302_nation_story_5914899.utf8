 Button rap on minister 

 New Delhi, March 1 (PTI): A Union minister was told to button up when he rose to answer a question in the Lok Sabha today.

 Minister of state for coal Dasarinarayan Rao had begun to reply to a query during question hour when Varkala Radhakrishnan, a CPM veteran, butted in. He pointed out to the chair that the minister was being discourteous to the House by keeping his shirt buttons open.

 Sir, I have also been a Speaker (of the Kerala Assembly). I would not have allowed this to happen, Radhakrishnan told deputy Speaker Charanjit Singh Atwal, who was in the chair.

 As the House burst out laughing, Rao quickly buttoned up.

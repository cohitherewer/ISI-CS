 Pune, Oct. 8: Cooped up 

 in a fifth-floor Le Meridien suite where his paparazzi-spooked 

 parents chose to spend much of the last 36 hours, Maddox 

 got some fresh air this afternoon, but Brangelina werent 

 breathing easy. 

 An auto-rickshaw ride with their four-year-old kid was cut short when a posse of shutterbugs was able to end their arduous, and sometimes perilous, wait for a picture of the star-couple.

 Surprisingly, Maddox was at ease when the flashbulbs whirred, and was hardly queasy with the attention his parents loathe. Such is the aversion that their bodyguard deemed it fit to beat up an eager-beaver British photographer at the Meridien on Saturday.

 For the Indian media though, the picture wasnt bleak. In fact, it was the brightest in the four days since they have been trying to put the Hollywood celebrity-couple in their frames.

 The victory was sweeter because it came their way after they beat Brangelinas security agents who have been employing a curious combination of decoys and dummy convoys to put desperate photographers off trail.

 In the cat-and-mouse game today, the photographers took positions on all exit and entry points; cars and bikes were kept ready outside the hotel.

 Two seemingly inconspicuous autos came in from the front entrance and made their way to the basement. But it was a casual workman in the basement, after all, who lifted the proverbial smokescreen for Indian photographers. He tipped them off just when the stars were preparing to leave, again in an auto-rickshaw.

 As two vehicles one carrying security agents emerged amid abuses hurled at the media crew from the outwitted guards, Jolie and Pitt, Maddox sandwiched in between them, were seen goading their driver to carry on. While Jolie wore a beige jacket on a white shirt, partner Pitt was sporting a white shirt. 

 As hordes of media crew chased the star-studded auto-rickshaw (MH12AQ 5648), the couple decided to abruptly end their second ride in two days the last one was on Friday and return to the safe confines of the Meridien.

 When they started out, Indian shutterbugs had a two-point mission: to get shots and keep firang paparazzi out. We will not let them take even one photo. This would not have been so much trouble, if they were not present here. Jolie and Pitt are more bothered about them, said one from a leading daily.

 Later in the day, word went out from the production crew of A Mighty Heart that the star couple would hold a news conference soon, but only the Indian media would be invited. 

 The film is based on the life of slain Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl. Jolie is playing Pearls wife Mariane, on whose book the film is based. Michael Winterboom is the director and Pitt a part-producer of the movie, whose shooting begins tomorrow in a bungalow at Aundh on Punes fringes. 

 A three-day schedule for Mumbai is also ready, sources said, but did not divulge the dates.

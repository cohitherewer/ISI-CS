 Soldier shoots down major

 OUR BUREAU

 Jammu/New Delhi, Sept. 14: A soldier turned his service rifle on his senior officer and riddled him with bullets near the Line of Control in Kashmir late last night, adding to a lengthening list of fragging incidents that is worrying commanders at army headquarters.

 Naik Ravi Kumar was arrested after he shot Major Harsh Kumar of Jaipur with his Kalashnikov inside the camp of the Rashtriya Rifles 38th battalion at Thanamandi in Rajouri sector.

 Naik Ravi Kumar shot dead Major Harsh Kumar on the night of September 13-14, 2006, at a remote company post. The individual has been taken into custody. Investigations are in progress and an inquiry has been ordered, a statement from the army said.

 But sources in Jammu said Ravi Kumar was angry because the major had den- ied him leave. This version was not corroborated in New Delhi where a source said: The Court of Inquiry is investigating but prima facie it looks like the officer had pulled him up for failing to perform a task. Ravi Kumar was engaged in clerical duties with the battalion.

 The act of killing or attempting to kill a senior officer known as fragging in US military parlance gained currency with the US war in Vietnam. Last December, army headquarters ordered all officers to screen troops at the unit level for symptoms of stress after studies pointed to pressures that drive soldiers to momentary insanity because of prolonged deployment in low-intensity conflict operations.

 There were 95 incidents of assault and affray, including beating up of officers, between 2002 and 2004. Eighteen incidents were recorded in 2005.

 Militants killed

 Security forces last night killed two Lashkar-e-Toiba militants, one of them involved in the massacre of 13 Hindus in Udhampur district in April.

 After a hunt of over four months, security personnel raided the hideout of Ejaz Ahmad, a top Lashkar militant who took part in the killing of the 13 shepherds in the upper reaches of Basantgarh on April 30 a day before the massacre of 22 Hindus in Doda district.

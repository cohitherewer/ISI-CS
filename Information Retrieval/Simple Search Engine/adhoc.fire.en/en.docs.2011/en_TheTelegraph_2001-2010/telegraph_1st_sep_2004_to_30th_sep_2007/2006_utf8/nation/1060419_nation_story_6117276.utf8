 Court quashes poll panel fiat

 Kochi: Kerala High Court has quashed the Election Commission order forbidding the state government from inking its final deal with Dubai Internet City (DIC) for the Rs 2,100-crore Smart City project in Kochi, reports our special correspondent.

 Disposing of a PIL filed by Intelligent Decisions (India) Private Ltd seeking to quash the fiat, the court said the agreement was not covered by the model code of conduct since the government had taken the decision in 2004. 

 It was due to a case pending before the court that the government could not proceed with the project, the court said. 

 The government had signed an MoU with DIC to set up an IT free-trade corridor on nearly 500 acres in the city.

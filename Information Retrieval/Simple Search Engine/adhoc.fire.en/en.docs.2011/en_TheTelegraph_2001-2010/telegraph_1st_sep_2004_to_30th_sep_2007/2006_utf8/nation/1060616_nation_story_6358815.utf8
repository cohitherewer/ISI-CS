 Zarqawi dole

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, June 15: The US air strike that killed Abu Musab al-Zarqawi last week may have saved Mulayam Singh Yadav the sum of Rs 500 a month and his security officials a big headache.

 Had the chief of al Qaida operations in Iraq (in picture) been alive, he could have turned up at Lucknows Ambedkar Maidan tomorrow to meet the chief minister and claim unemployment dole.

 At least, so suggests a domicile-and-unemployment certificate that carries the official stamp of the Lucknow district magistrates office.

 As the government gears up to pay the first instalment of its vaunted unemployment allowance tomorrow, a local daily has exposed how the scheme has spawned a forgery racket with the likely collusion of corrupt officials.

 The newspaper yesterday published a fake domicile certificate issued in the name of Zarqawi ? whom Osama bin Laden had called the prince of al Qaida in Iraq ? citing his address as AI, Jal Sansthan Colony, Water Works Road, Lucknow.

 When the real resident, Amit Tripathi, was approached, he was totally confused. No I didnt apply for unemployment allowance, he told police.

 The state government ordered a probe last night, but tomorrows programme is on. Some 21,630 jobless young men and women from the Lucknow division will receive their first payment at Ambedkar Maidan, 300 of them from the chief minister personally.

 The state government had announced the dole for the states 8.5 lakh educated jobless youths in May, just months ahead of the Assembly polls scheduled early next year.

 The expose has got the Opposition, which cannot afford to oppose the Rs 400-crore measure, screaming that unless steps are taken to make the scheme corruption-free, it would descend into farce.

 We are not against the dole. But the hurry with which it is being launched, probably with an eye on advancing the date of the polls, might defeat the real purpose, BSP leader S.P. Maurya said.

 We might be able to detect a scam in it soon, said the Congresss Akhilesh Singh.

 The government had no time for such cautions. Today, officials were busy registering the jobless and issuing them a token each. A long queue had formed in front of the unemployment registration office in Lucknow.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Govt defends telecast rules

 SINGH GYANANT KUMAR

 New Delhi, Feb. 9: The Centre has strongly defended the downlinking guidelines which make it mandatory for all private channels to share with Prasar Bharati their feed relating to events of national importance, including cricket matches.

 The move comes in the backdrop of Doordarshan facing difficulties in getting live telecast rights for the ongoing India-Pakistan series.

 Responding to a petition by TEN Sports challenging the constitutional validity of the guidelines, the Centre has told the Supreme Court that similar provisions exist in other countries, including Australia, Ireland, Germany, Italy and the UK.

 The Television Without Frontiers directive of the European Union, too, urges member states to ensure that sporting events of national importance are available to the maximum number of viewers on a free-to-air basis.

 In an affidavit filed in response to the petition, information and broadcasting ministry director Seema Jere Bisht has pointed out that satellite television does not reach 240 million viewers in the country and they are missing out on events for which private channels have acquired exclusive telecast rights.

 The guidelines seek to balance the right of the public to watch such events with that of private channels, she added. 

 The commercial interests of the channels are also protected as 75 per cent of the revenue generated by Prasar Bharati by marketing such events would go to the exclusive rights holder, Bisht said. The rest would be retained by the public broadcaster and used to meet technical, uplinking and other costs.

 The views of various broadcasters were taken into consideration while framing the guidelines, the government said, adding that the list of sporting events of national importance would be drawn up in consultation with sports channels, sports rights management companies and the sports ministry.

 The Dubai-based TEN Sports, which has the exclusive telecast rights for the ongoing India-Pakistan matches, does not have an unfettered right to downlink into India a channel uplinked from abroad, the government said. 

 The guidelines were drawn up to regulate downlinking of channels by broadcasters, it added. 

 They also kept in view the observations of the Supreme Court in the 1995 Cricket Association of Bengal case and a Bombay High Court directive in January 2005 to frame downlinking guidelines under the Telegraph Act.

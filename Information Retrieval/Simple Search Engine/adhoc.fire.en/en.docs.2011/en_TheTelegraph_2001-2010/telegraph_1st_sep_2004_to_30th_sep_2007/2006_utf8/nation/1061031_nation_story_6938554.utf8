 Breathless Basanti flogs remakes

 - Classic 

 films cannot be remade, says Hema 

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Bhopal, Oct. 30: She doesnt 

 talk without purpose, she says smugly, almost breathless 

 between non-stop banter as the irrepressible Basanti who 

 couldnt be reined in as the most charming buggy-driver 

 on Indian screen.

 Decades later, economy of words still proved difficult for Sholays chariot queen as she held forth on why remakes made little sense and how the legendary characters in reprises wouldnt even feel imitated, much less flattered.

 Can there be a Basanti like me? Basanti is Basanti and its only me, said Hema Malini, in the city to perform Draupadi, a dance drama based on the Mahabharata figure, at a function organised as part of the Madhya Pradesh Assemblys golden jubilee celebrations.

 Asked if daughter Esha could don Basantis robes, the Dreamgirls eyes lit up, but the lips were firmly in place. There is no such offer for her now. And as I said before, Basanti is Basanti and that is me!.

 Remakes are a bad idea and the young line of actors cant live up to the legendary characters played in classics like Sholay, Mughal-e-Azam, Umrao Jaan, Don and Pakeezah, she said. 

 The message could have reached Shah Rukh Khan, Farhan Akhtar, J.P. Dutta, Ram Gopal Verma and several others with big-budget remakes in the pipeline. 

 I believe that classical and good films should not be remade. The good flicks cannot be remade. Only bad films should be made into good films, Hema said. 

 She clarified that her remarks should not be seen as casting aspersions on the younger lot. They (young Bollywood stars) are extremely talented and a professional lot. But they cannot match the life-time performances given by the great artistes of our industry.

 Hema said her opposition to remakes of popular films of yesteryears was based on a simple principle such movies will fail to achieve popularity. 

 I believe that remake films cannot provide natural character to the scenes and the situations in comparison to the original film on the subject, she said. 

 Hema expressed her disappointment at the virtual disappearance of classical dance from Indian films, but hoped it would stage a comeback. The influence of western culture is dominating Hindi films. The interest of the new generation in classical dance has also declined.

 Hema is a trustee of Bhopals Bharat Bhawan, a national centre of arts. She denied charges that she had been neglecting the institute. I am unable to provide ample time due to my busy schedule, but will do so.

 Since joining politics, Hema said she was trying to be taken more seriously as an artiste rather than a political leader. An artiste has the ability to directly connect with people. 

 Asked about her role with Amitabh Bachchan in the film Baabul, she said the superstar had the ability to play every role superbly. 

 On the entry of star-children, Hema saw nothing wrong in it, going on to say her dream was to work with her daughter in the role of a mother.

 Job revolution, with graft war

 Hyderabad, Feb. 2: In the late 1990s, a visiting Sonia Gandhi had promised Anantpur, wracked by farmers suicides, that she would do something for the districts poor.

 Today, she accompanied Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to Bandlapalli, a village in the poverty-stricken district, for the launch of what they both termed a revolutionary scheme to remove poverty countrywide.

 The Prime Minister handed job cards to five villagers, flagging off the national rural employment guarantee scheme, a Congress poll promise, in 200 districts of the country. The programme guarantees every rural household 100 days of work every year.

 It is not a routine development programme. It provides legal right to employment, a chance to create infrastructure, Singh said, urging the states to ensure the scheme stays free of corruption. 

 There should be no denial or delay or ambiguity?. A sound monitoring system and grievances redressal mechanism should be put in place involving all stakeholders.

 You can use the right to information act to check irregularities in implementation, Sonia advised the villagers.

 Anantpur is rich in historical associations for the Congress, uniting three generations of its first family in their battle against poverty.

 Five decades ago, Jawaharlal Nehru and his daughter Indira had been guests at a community lunch at a gruel centre, set up during a famine, in a village 30 km from Bandlapalli. Sonia was visibly moved when officials told her how Indira and Nehru had sat down with ordinary villagers at B. Pappur and eaten a meal of the local staple, ragi gruel.

 Sonia was served a better fare: she tasted the Rayalaseema delicacies of ragi sankati (steamed ball of ragi flour), verushanaga paccahdi (peanut chutney) and jonna roti (jowar bread) at a community lunch with 150 villagers.

 Sonia said her mother-in-law, who had coined the slogan garibi hatao (banish poverty), would have been happy to see the launch of the rural job scheme that promises to turn her dream into reality.

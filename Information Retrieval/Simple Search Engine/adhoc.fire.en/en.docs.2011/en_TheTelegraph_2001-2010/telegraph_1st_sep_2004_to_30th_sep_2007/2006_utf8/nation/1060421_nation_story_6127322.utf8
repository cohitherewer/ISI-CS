 Damages for flood diseases

Mumbai: Bombay High Court has directed the Maharashtra government 

to consider proper compensation for relatives of those killed by flood-related 

diseases like leptospirosis during the July 26, 2005, deluge and submit a report 

at the next hearing of a petition, reports our special correspondent.

 The verbal orders by a bench of Justices Kshitij Vyas and Dhananjay Chandrachud came during the hearing of the petition filed by an NGO, Project Smita, formed by a group of filmmakers after the deluge.

 Filmmakers Mahesh Bhatt, Soni Razdan, Vinta Nanda, Raman Kumar, Ashok Pandit and adman Alyque Padamsee, among others, had filed the petition against the failure of the Vilasrao Deshmukh government in tackling the cloudburst and its aftermath.

 According to Mihir Desai, the counsel for the petitioners, the state government had filed an affidavit before the court earlier, assuring compensation for the kin of those drowned during the deluge as well as those who fell victim to the outbreak of diseases.

 However, we informed the court about two leptospirosis victims who were refused compensation. The collector told the court that the government had compensated only those who died by drowning. The court then orally asked the collector to take instructions from the government to consider compensation for (relatives of) those killed by diseases like leptospirosis, Desai said.

 According to official statistics, more than 1,450 people died because of floods across the state, while over 457 died of diseases, including 341 in Mumbai. 

 The relatives of those drowned or killed in landslides were given an ex gratia compensation of Rs 1 lakh.

 Khurana salvo

 New Delhi: Expelled BJP leader Madan Lal Khurana on Thursday 

threatened to reveal sex scandals involving very senior party leaders, 

reports our special correspondent. 

 Sanjay Joshis scandal was nothing compared to what I am going to reveal. I am talking about some very senior persons, Khurana said as he sent his resignation letter to the party.

 BJP leaders dismissed the threat, but RSS veteran M.G. Vaidya, too, had promised to spill the beans on party leaders sometime ago. 

 The Madhya Pradesh BJP has been talking of at least one more sex CD involving two senior leaders with a Sangh background.

 Nod for highway 

 New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Thursday gave the go-ahead 

to the construction of the Rs 2,250-crore Bangalore-Mysore express highway project. 

It also imposed a fine of Rs 5 lakh on the Karnataka government, which had appealed 

against a high court order clearing the project.

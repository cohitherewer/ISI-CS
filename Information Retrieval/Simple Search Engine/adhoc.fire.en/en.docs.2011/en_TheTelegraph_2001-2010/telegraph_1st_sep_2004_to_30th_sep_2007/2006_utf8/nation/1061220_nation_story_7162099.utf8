 Babri hawk plays harmony harp

 RASHEED KIDWAI 

 Uma Bharti: Changing tune

 Bhopal, Dec. 19: From exhorting the mob around Babri Masjid to give it ek dhakka aur, Uma Bharti seems to have turned into a votary of religious harmony.

 As the muezzin (person who calls out for people to come to the mosque for prayers) rose at dawn on Sunday, the dargah of Garib Nawaz Moinuddin Chishti drew a visitor.

 The lady in saffron walked briskly, bowed before the grave of Indias greatest preacher of Islam, offered a chadar and sat down for 15 minutes of solitary meditation.

 On her way back, she stopped to examine the Jannati Darwaza (gateway to heaven), checking if she could pass through it. 

 The khadims (attendants) regretfully told her the door opens only once a year, during Urs.

 Devotees believe that whatever is asked for with a true and sincere heart while passing through the Darwaza is granted.

 The nazim (administrator) of the dargah was elated. She came to pay her respects. The personality of Garib Nawaz draws men and women from all faiths, Nazim Abdul Aleem said over the phone.

 The general secretary of Umas Bhartiya Janshakti Party, Chandraraj Singhvi, quoted from the sadhvis speeches before and after the dargah visit to argue she was a changed person.

 Didi has been saying that the essentials of all religions are the same: serve, love, purify, meditate (pray) and realise. Be good, do good, be kind, be compassionate.

 Singhvi added that Uma, at recent public meetings in Rajasthan, had kept saying she was ready to show respect for the Quran, Bible and all faiths provided the others had the same regard for Ram, Krishna, the Gita and the Ramayan.

 Singhvi said Umas Ajmer visit carried political significance. It is not like visiting Mohammed Ali Jinnahs grave. Khwaja sahib (Chishti) was a revered saint of humanity and not a politician, he explained, alluding to how L.K. Advanis visit to Jinnahs grave in Karachi had sparked controversy. 

 In Bhopal, Umas supporters said the dargah visit and her remarks in Rajasthan marked a shift in attitude. Some recalled how the sadhvi had opposed the idea of halting at dargahs and other Muslim shrines during the 2003 Assembly poll campaign.

 When she was contesting the 1999 Lok Sabha election from Bhopal, Uma had said she didnt like the idea of wrapping a green dupatta round herself and bowing before mazars. I tell them, you stick to your faith and I stick to mine, she had said.

 In Rajasthan this week, according to Singhvi, she told audiences: Prayer, fasting, charity and pilgrimage are the first steps in all religions. Respect all prophets, all saints, all messengers of God. All saints speak the same language (the language of love). All religions lead to God. Remember this point well and live in peace and harmony with all.

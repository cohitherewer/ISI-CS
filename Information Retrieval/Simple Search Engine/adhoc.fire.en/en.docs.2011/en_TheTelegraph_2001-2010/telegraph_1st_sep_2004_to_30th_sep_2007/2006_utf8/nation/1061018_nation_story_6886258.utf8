 An Indian soldier in 2017, through JJs eyes

 Meet Lance-Naik Ram Bhagat Rai of the Maratha Light Infantry. 

 Thats right. That aint no Yank from the banks of the Tigris in Iraq.

 Thiss what the Indian soldier will look like circa 2017, about 10 years from now. 

 A figment of General Joginder Jaswant Singhs fertile imagination, this graphic was displayed by the army chief at the conclusion of the commanders conference and the second conclave of former chiefs.

 The army chief is tied down by the mundane of the day-to-day in an army that is engaged 24X7 in Jammu and Kashmir and the Northeast. But that has not stopped him from being futuristic.

 We are getting maximum support from the government to develop the future infantry soldier as a system. It may take 10 to 15 years to achieve all that is shown here, he said. The general believes it is a possibility by the end of the 12th plan (2017).

 He believes that nearly two-thirds of the equipment the soldier is carrying on his back, head, strapped to the thigh and the shoulders will be indigenous. But that does not really matter. Even the US imports a lot of equipment from different countries.

 But the ambitions of the army brass are cut short by the urgency of counter-insurgency. In Jammu and Kashmir and in the Northeast, you need boots on the ground, said Singh. Assuming that in the time to come there will be a solution in Kashmir and compulsions of the military in these regions will reduce, we will be able to restructure (the army) into a lean-mean fighting machine of the 21st century.

 For the time being though, the army chief is struggling with products from the Defence Research and Development Organisation such as the Arjun main battle tank. It has been in the works for close to two decades but still the army has found little use for it. 

 But under pressure, the army is now raising two regiments of the Arjun. The general said the tanks had been ordered but a squadron of the machines was yet to be put through trials.

 Hizb top gun killed in hideout

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Jammu, Sept. 5: Police shot dead top Hizb-ul Mujahideen militant Billu Gujjar in an operation in Jammu last night.

 Wasim Khan alias Gujjar, who figured high on the list of most-wanted militants in the region, was killed in his hideout in the hills of Gool in Udhampur district, Jammu and Kashmir police said.

 The police laid a cordon and barged into his hideout, a summer hut, and shot him. Gujjar, caught unawares, did not put up much resistance. An AK rifle with three magazines and a satellite phone set were found on him.

 Agency reports said Gujjar had come to a village in Gool tehsil in Udhampur around 8 pm yesterday to meet his wife when the security forces cordoned the area on a tip-off. They shot him dead around midnight.

 It was a clean operation with no collateral damage, said deputy inspector-general of police L.I. Mohanty.

 He added that the police raided the village after receiving intelligence reports that Gujjar was there. Residents helped shelter the militant for some time.

 The self-styled district commander carried a reward of Rs 5 lakh on his head and was said to be a nightmare for residents and the security forces.

 He is believed to have supervised and taken part in a series of killings of security forces in Gool, Doda, Kishtwar, Rajouri and Poonch. Records show that Gujjar was the brain behind the killing of Hindu teachers in the Gool area in 1998 and an attack on a police post. He also carried out improvised explosions on the roads of Gool that killed many soldiers and BSF personnel in recent years.

 This (Gujjars killing) is a great success for the police, Sheeshu Pal Vaid, the inspector-general of police, said. Vaids force had drawn an elite group of men from the special operations group to track down the militant.

 His crimes are countless, Vaid said. It is a big day for the people of the region because a mastermind of terror has been eliminated. He was terror personified.

 Gujjar turned to militancy in 1991. He first made Doda district his base. Vaid said Gujjar was constantly changing hideouts. There were many occasions when we missed him by minutes.

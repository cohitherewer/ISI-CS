 Marathon boy stable

 Mumbai, Sept. 25 (PTI): The condition of Mrityunjay Mandal, the seven-year-old marathon runner who collapsed yesterday at Peddar Road after running 68 km and was hospitalised, is stable.

 Mandal collapsed because of hypoglycaemia (deficiency of glucose) and dehydration. He was admitted to GT Hospital in south Mumbai.

 Hospital superintendent H.S. Jadhav said the boys condition was stable. He is doing fine, but will be under observation for at least 48 hours before being discharged, said paediatrician Nita Sutay.

 Although he was admitted to the paediatric ward yesterday, I shifted him to the intensive care unit for better observation and monitoring, Sutay said. 

 We are checking all his parameters and they seemed to be within normal limits. He is fine now but we would like to observe him for at least another two days, she added. It would be difficult to say what would have happened had Mandal continued running or had not been given timely medical intervention.

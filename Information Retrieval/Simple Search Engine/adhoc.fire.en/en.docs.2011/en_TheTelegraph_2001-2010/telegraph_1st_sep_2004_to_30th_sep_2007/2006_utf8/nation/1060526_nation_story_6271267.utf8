 Mumbai readies deluge shield

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

No repeat?

Mumbai, May 25: Twice shy after last Julys 

deluge, Mumbai is trying to insure against a repeat by putting in place an elaborate 

plan of evacuation, shelter, information and treatment two weeks before the monsoon 

arrives.

 All suburban hospitals would be put on 24-hour alert, chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh assured the city today. Public address systems on every major road will give out accurate information on water-logging and traffic jams, and the railways will set up a central information centre for hourly updates on trains.

 Deshmukh said the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has been asked to evacuate residents from 48 buildings listed by a survey. The government has identified municipal schools that can be turned into transit camps in an emergency.

 Reliance Energy Ltd has agreed to keep 100 transformers and feeders on stand-by to prevent power cuts. The company would also complete the job of raising the height of its transformers in low-lying areas to ensure non-stop power supply. Mobile companies have been asked to be ready with extra generators.

 The ban on plastic bags will be strictly enforced. The chief minister added that the BMC has filled up 12,000 potholes in the city and promised to finish most of the job by May 31.

 Deshmukh, who today chaired a meeting of the disaster management authority he set up last August, said the BMC, the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority, BEST, the railways and the fire brigade have been asked to work out an emergency plan to deal with a deluge-like situation.

 Chief secretary D.K. Sankaran will co-ordinate with his opposite numbers in Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka to ensure that overflowing waters from their dams do not cause flooding in Maharashtra. 

 Last year, the backflow from the Almatti dam in Karnataka had caused massive floods in Maharashtras western districts of Sangli and Satara.

 Deshmukh has extended the deadline from May 31 to June 5 for the completion of pre-monsoon work, such as desilting of nullahs and road repairs.

 We have learnt a lot from the deluge experience, Deshmukh said.

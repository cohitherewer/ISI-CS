 Shirt swap, forced into tunnel from pitch

 TOM DART

 London, June 30: Think Bobby Moore and Pel? exchanging their tops after England played Brazil in the 1970 World Cup finals. There is no more honourable end to a sporting contest than for one man to swaddle himself in nylon damp and pungent with anothers sweat.

 Well, tell it to Fifa: the naked truth is that it does not like flesh. Players are encouraged to swap shirts in the privacy of the tunnel because the sports world governing body considers it unseemly to have semi-naked men wandering round the pitch.

 Shirt-swapping was even prohibited at the start of the 1986 World Cup because Fifa did not want players to bare their chests on the field.

 Although players do not exchange their gear on the pitch as often as they used to, do not assume that the practice is dying out.

 An FA spokesman said after Englands match against Ecuador in the round of 16 that some of the South Americans waited patiently outside the England dressing-room to pass on messages requesting a particular players kit.

 Shirt-swapping has become the equivalent of autograph-hunting for footballers. Steven Gerrards house boasts a vast trophy room filled with England caps, shirts and other memorabilia.

 The centrepiece is a glass cabinet commemorating Liverpools 2005 Champions League victory.

 Rotating mannequins model a Gerrard Liverpool shirt and an Andriy Shevchenko AC Milan top. 

 Tales of famous players giving away their clothing to lesser opponents but having no interest in a reciprocal gesture are common. Naturally, the famous players are the most in demand, which means that deals are often sealed before matches, or even during them.

 Gary Megson, the former West Bromwich Albion manager, banned his players from swapping shirts with top players because he did not want them to act as if they were starstruck. 

 Under the hammer 

 Although top players these days 

 hardly need to raise cash by putting a Ronaldo shirt on 

 eBay, there is a profit in getting shirty. A reaction such 

 as Alf Ramseys in 1966 ? after the infamously ugly 

 game against Argentina, the England manager stopped George 

 Cohen from swapping shirts with Roberto Perfumo ? would 

 be unpopular with players with an eye for easy money. Game-worn 

 items can be highly valuable. A shirt the seller claims 

 was worn in the 1978 tournament by Oscar, of Brazil, fetched 

 ?450 on eBay. Its not quite up there with the elite. 

 Cohens 1966 World Cup shirt was sold for ?38,400 two 

 days ago, while Pel?s 1970 World Cup final shirt went 

 for ?157,750.

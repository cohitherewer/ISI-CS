 Thiruvananthapuram, March 22: Embattled Kerala Opposition leader V.S. Achuthanandan has put out a two-paragraph statement calling for calm and compliance with party discipline.

 Achuthanandans sympathisers had taken to the streets after the party denied him a seat in the polls. The statement followed a politburo meeting yesterday.

 Achuthanandan called for an end to the current campaign that the CPM was divided into two factions over his candidature or otherwise.

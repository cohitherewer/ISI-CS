 Tech leash on crime data cheats

 Kapil Sibal: Probe matters

 New Delhi, Oct. 30: A bit of technology, an investment of Rs 230 crore, and a desire for change might help transform Indias tainted criminal investigation system.

 The department of science and technology and Microsoft today announced that the technology hardware and software to record all crime scene investigation data in tamper-proof digital format is now ready.

 The technology, first pledged by science and technology minister Kapil Sibal nearly 18 months ago and developed by Microsoft, allows easy collection and storage of crime-related data without any chance of any subsequent unauthorised alteration. 

 Police stations in Dehra Dun and Jaipur have already tested the technology.

 The technology, officials indicated today, was the easy part. As one Microsoft official put it, the big challenge is to get the nations 23,000 police stations to embrace it.

 Criminal investigations have been known to be hampered by tampered evidence and witnesses changing their statements. We know that things can go wrong by the time the case comes to the court, said Sibal.

 The new technology will allow police officers to use devices such as tablet PCs and digital cameras to record all crime scene evidence and store it on servers managed by the state and central governments. All the data, including first information reports, audio and video records of statements and investigations would be stored in a read-only format.

 The data once recorded cannot be deleted, but can be altered by an authorised officer and the date of the alteration is recorded. The original data can also be retrieved despite the alteration.

 The digitisation and storage of crime scene data would also allow rapid access to information and find patterns and correlation that would not be possible with the existing system, company officials said.

 In an investigation, connecting two events is often impossible without connections and shared knowledge between two investigating officers. For instance, the new technology would allow an investigating officer to search a database and pull out information about all RDX related cases under investigation in a state or across the country in minutes.

 Sibal said the department of science and technology would meet relevant government departments, including the home ministry, urging adoption of the technology. 

 Company officials have told the department that the technology would cost about Rs 100,000 for each police station translating into Rs 230 crore for Indias 23,000 stations.

 But the technology could spread only with desire for change springing from within the criminal investigation system, Sibal said. There are pockets willing to collaborate with us on this, he said.

 Soon after taking over as science and technology minister, Sibal had announced his plan of exploiting technologies to improve the criminal investigation process developed.

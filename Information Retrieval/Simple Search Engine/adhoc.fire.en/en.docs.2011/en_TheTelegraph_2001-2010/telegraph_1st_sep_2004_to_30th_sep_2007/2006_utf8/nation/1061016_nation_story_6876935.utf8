 Patna/New Delhi, Oct. 15: Lalu Prasads efforts to field joint candidates against the NDA in the Bihar bypolls received a blow today with Ram Vilas Paswan sticking to his guns and refusing to support the Rashtriya Janata Dal.

 Shakuni Choudhary is the party candidate from Bhagalpur while negotiations are still under way for the Nalanda seat, RJD general secretary Shyam Rajak confirmed over phone from Delhi. 

 The Lok Janshakti Party president, on the other hand, declared: Theres no question of supporting the RJD in any of the seats. 

 Sources said Lalu Prasad, AICC general secretary Ahmad Patel and Paswan had several rounds of talks but failed to achieve anything tangible.

 The CPM is learnt to be sore over the RJDs decision to field Subodh Rai as its candidate from Bhagalpur. The CPM wanted Rai, who had represented the seat in the Lok Sabha from 1999 to 2004, to be the joint UPA nominee this time.

 Sources in the party said Rai, despite the failure of the joint effort, will contest the poll and has already filed his nomination. 

 The CPI, too, has asked its nominee from Nalanda, Gaya Singh, to file his papers. Our candidate (Gaya Singh) will file his nomination from Nalanda tomorrow. We have conveyed our decision to the Congress and the RJD. LJP leader Ram Vilas Paswan has supported us from the beginning, CPI secretary D. Raja told The Telegraph today. 

 He added that barring the RJD, all UPA constituents and allies were unanimous on the candidature. The Congress is also with us, he said.

 In the two Assembly polls held in Bihar last year, the UPA suffered heavy losses because of the Paswan-Lalu Prasad rift.

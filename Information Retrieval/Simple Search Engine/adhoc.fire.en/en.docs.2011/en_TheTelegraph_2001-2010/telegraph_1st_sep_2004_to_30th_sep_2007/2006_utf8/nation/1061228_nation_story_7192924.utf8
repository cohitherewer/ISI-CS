 Tata evokes anger, approval

 OUR BUREAU 

 Dec. 27: Ratan Tatas bombshell today accusing rivals of encouraging trouble over his project in Singur made some fellow car makers angry, but there were other industry sources who said someone of his stature wouldnt speak without knowing what he was saying.

 Let me just say it is not just political because I happen to know that some of our competitors are also fuelling some of this fire. They would be very happy if the project got delayed, Tata said in an interview to a TV channel. 

 Officially, Maruti Udyog would not comment. But a senior official of the company said: These comments are completely preposterous. It is very offending to hear such comments from a senior industrialist like Ratan Tata.

 With four models, Maruti is a competitor in the small-car segment that Tatas Rs 100,000 vehicle will revolutionise. So is Hyundai, which makes the Santro and several others like General Motors, Honda, Volkswagen and Toyota which are planning to enter this market.

 According to the governments definition for taxation, a small car cant have a more than 1200cc engine (petrol, 1500cc for diesel) and shouldnt be over 4 metres long.

 Officials from the Tata group refused to say who Ratan Tata was targeting. I havent seen the interview, so it would not be right for me to comment, said a Tata Motors official. 

 Auto industry observers appeared to be in agreement with Ratan Tata. Its not someone from outside the auto industry who seems to be doing this. I will not be surprised if one of the leading manufacturers, who could find his position threatened in a particular segment, fuelled some of the fire, a source said.

 Tata Motors plans to make 1 million cars at the Singur facility in the next four years. Such an ambitious plan could upset the fortunes of the industry which sold 1 million cars in 2005. 

 Dilip Chenoy, director-general of the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers, said: The entry of a vehicle in the Rs 1 lakh category has the potential to exponentially grow the demand for four wheelers. It will introduce a new brand of consumers and redefine the price points.

 According to the industry source who spoke on condition of anonymity, Ratan Tata is not the sort of person who makes outlandish statements. Probably this has been going on for some time now.

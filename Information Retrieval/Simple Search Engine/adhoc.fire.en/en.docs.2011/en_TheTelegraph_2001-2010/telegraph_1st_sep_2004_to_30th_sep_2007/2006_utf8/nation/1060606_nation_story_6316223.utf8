 Bajrang moral cops strike again

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Bhopal, June 5: After a brief lull, the Bajrang Dal is on the rampage again, targeting the minorities and acting moral police.

 Today, it disrupted a news conference in which two Christian women, who were allegedly gangraped, were being presented. A day earlier, its activists had harassed two government officials, a man and a woman, for apparently getting cosy in private.

 State Bajrang Dal convener Devender Rawat and his men forced their way into a news conference that was being addressed by state minorities commission member Indira Iyenger.

 Shouting at the top of his voice, Rawat said: I will not allow you to tarnish the image of nationalist Hindu organisations.

 As Iyenger rose to respond, the gang began vandalising the venue. The police took their time arriving and, instead of making arrests, merely asked the Dal activists and Iyenger to leave.

 Yesterday, Rawat and his gang had barged into a house in upscale Char Imli where a senior government official was in the company of a woman colleague. Rawat accused them of inappropriate behaviour and dragged both to a police station. The police, however, could not register a case as the matter involved consenting adults getting together at a private place.

 An unfazed Rawat justified his action. They were doing dirty things and we caught them red-handed, he said. Its a shame the police didnt take stringent action.

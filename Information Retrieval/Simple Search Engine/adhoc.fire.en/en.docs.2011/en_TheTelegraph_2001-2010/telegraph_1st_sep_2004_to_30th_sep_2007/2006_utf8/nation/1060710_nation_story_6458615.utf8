 SC grants right to evict tenant

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 9: The Supreme Court has held that a society intending to carry on non-commercial activity from residential premises in possession of a tenant could be allowed to seek eviction on the ground that it required the premises for its own occupation.

 A society cannot have any residential requirement and, therefore, its activities would determine the nature of its use of a residential premises, a bench of Justices A.R. Lakshmanan and Altamas Kabir said while interpreting the bona fide requirement clause invoked by landlords for eviction of residential premises.

 According to the clause, landlords can seek eviction for use or occupation of the premises for purposes of residence if they do not have any other accommodation in the area.

 The apex court, however, dismissed the plea of a tenant challenging a Punjab and Haryana High Court order that allowed Arya Samaj Seva Sadan to get its premises vacated for running a library.

 The tenant said that running a library could not be equated with the expression for his own occupation. 

 But the Supreme Court said: A juristic person cannot have need of residence but may use a premises for non-commercial purposes.

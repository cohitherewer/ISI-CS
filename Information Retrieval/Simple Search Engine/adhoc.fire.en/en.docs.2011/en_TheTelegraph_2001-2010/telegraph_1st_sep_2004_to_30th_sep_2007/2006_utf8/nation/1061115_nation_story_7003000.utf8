 Defence push for private funds

 New Delhi, Nov. 14: Indias defence research outfit has asked the government for a new funding and stake-holding pattern that ropes in the private sector.

 Pushed to the wall after being pilloried by the army, the navy and the air force for failing to deliver much-needed equipment and draining the exchequer, the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) is pushing for the new pattern of funding that will tie the forces as well as the private sector into its projects.

 The proposal was made after a dissection of the DRDOs failures by its chief, M. Natarajan, also the scientific adviser to the defence minister. Natarajan told a gathering of experts on investments in defence research today that the organisation had assessed its strengths and weaknesses. In a presentation that was rare because it was so candid, Natarajan said: we assumed a scientific base but it was inadequate.

 The allocation for DRDOs projects for the current year is a whopping Rs 5,454 crore that is just 6.13 per cent of the total defence budget but its accumulated losses on its major projects are multiples of that figure. Only last month, the DRDO lobbied with the government and extended its Trishul missile project by another year after the ministry asked it to shut it down by December 2006 for failing to deliver in 22 years.

 The new stake-holding pattern for its projects proposed by the DRDO is: 70 per cent by the DRDO, 20 per cent by industry (private and/or public) and 10 per cent by the users (army, navy, air force, coast guard etc). 

 DRDO has four major projects: the Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme covering the missile systems Prithvi, Agni, Akash, Trishul and Nag; the Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) project christened Tejas, the main battle tank Arjun and an Electronic Warfare System. Each of these projects, including the variants of the weapon systems, have incurred huge time overruns.

 Pointing to other drawbacks, Natarajan said the country has a manufacturing base for military products (in the Ordnance Factory Boards and the defence PSUs) but quality is wanting. He said the government had also not given precise policy directives on indigenisation.

 But, he pointed out, the effort at developing a military-industrial base in the country had proved to be herculean. It was also done against the background of what he called the triple trap syndrome:

 what is developed abroad will not meet national requirements

 what is suitable will be denied

 what is not denied will not be affordable.

 It is largely on this plea that the DRDO has slipped in failing to deliver on its promises that the military services are asking for huge imports. Among the big weapon systems that are meant to substitute for DRDO projects are 126 multi-role combat aircraft for the IAF (because the LCA project has slipped), Barak ship missile defence (because the Trishul has slipped) and possibly more T-90 tanks (because the MBT Arjun has been deemed unusable with its current configuration).

 Lalu edges past other Yadav

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 Lalu Prasad, Mulayam

 New Delhi, Feb. 25: One was dismissed as a rustic, quick with witticism but short on substance, despite ruling his fief undisturbed for 15 years.

 The other lacked the gift of the gab but had an equally firm grip over his terrain through a pragmatic use of grassroots and durbar politics and the realisation that to be a long-distance runner, he needed to overcome his drawback.

 Both dreamt of becoming Prime Minister. But the first saw his ambitions thwarted by a corruption scandal while the second came within sniffing distance of the prize before bad luck snatched it away.

 Linked by caste and region but poles apart in style and temperament, Lalu Prasad and Mulayam Singh Yadav now have another thing in common: each has tried his hand at an image makeover.

 The Samajwadi Party boss nearly beat Lalu Prasad to it when, in his second stint as Uttar Pradesh chief minister, he went beyond caste and communal politics to speak of development and economic reforms. In keeping with his new image, he brought corporate honchos such as Anil Ambani, Nandan Nilekani and Adi Godrej on board as he unveiled a blueprint to morph his state into Uttam Pradesh (the number one state).

 On the other hand, until the last Bihar elections, Lalu Prasad gave the impression that development was the hobbyhorse of the urban rich, and that there was nothing wrong in keeping the rural poor permanently poor. The shock defeat apparently changed his worldview.

 As he unveiled his rail budget yesterday, hardly anybody could accuse him of being populist or Bihar-centric. That the railways has witnessed a turnaround and is aiming to be Indias bigger profit-earner in 2007 was credited to him thrice by the Prime Minister.

 But just when the RJD chief is set to embrace reforms and modernisation, his Yadav brother in Lucknow seems to have dropped his reform plans and gone back to his caste moorings.

 On Friday, as Lalu Prasad spoke of public-private partnership, outsourcing of essential services and competing with low-cost airlines, a forlorn Mulayam vowed to continue his fight to include some of the most backward castes in the scheduled castes list. 

 Lalu Prasad has used his stint at the Centre to spruce up his image so that when the next elections arrive, bringing with it the prospect of a third front, he can realistically hope to lead it minus the baggage of caste politics and his earlier contempt for governance.

 But Mulayam is entangled in controversies largely of Samajwadi Party general secretary Amar Singhs making. If he is to remain relevant to Delhi politics, Mulayam must battle the odds in Uttar Pradesh and retain power in the 2007 state polls. His aides (not Amar Singh) admit this would need a lot of hard work and a reversion to his original image.

 For Lalu Prasad, the battle for the power sweepstakes has shifted to Delhi. Mulayam remains grounded in Lucknow.

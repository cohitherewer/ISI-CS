 Tease complaint bites AMU student

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, May 17: An AMU students complaint of eve-teasing on campus today boomeranged in her face with a probe team clearing the alleged harassers but rapping her for bringing disrepute to the institution.

 Farah Aziz Khannum, who studies mass communication at Aligarh Muslim University, had alleged that two male students on a bike waylaid a friend near the administrative block on February 2, snatched her shawl and passed obscene remarks.

 She also claimed, in a written complaint filed the same day, that two other girls had been harassed two days earlier for not wearing dupattas and she for turning up in trousers and T-shirt.

 The probe, conducted by the universitys womens cell, however, said nothing of the kind had happened. Farah had blown the whole thing out of proportion in search of publicity and action should be taken against her, it said.

 The probe committee has found no truth in Farahs allegations of eve-teasing on campus, Ameena Kishar, a member of the probe team, comprising four senior lady professors and the registrar, said.

 According to the report, Farah had put in her complaint to the university at 2 pm on February 2 but by 5 pm, sent it out to media offices and students unions of other institutions. She was clearly looking for publicity, the report said.

 Farah, who is from Jharkhand, could not be reached for comment. But just after the incident, she had alleged: When our complaints were not taken seriously by university authorities, I decided to take it up with student leaders of JNU.

 University vice-chancellor Naseem Ahmed confirmed she had received the report. We will take a decision on the committees recommendations against Farah if required.

 As news of the report spread, there were stray voices of protest. One of Farahs well-wishers claimed the matter had been hushed up under pressure from the students union. No student had spoken up for fear of reprisal, she said.

 Another alleged that as some of the teasers belonged to the AMU students union, president Abdul Hafiz Gandhi had taken exception to the complaint.

 The victims had come to us but instead of waiting for our decision, went out of campus to campaign against university authorities, Gandhi said.

 There are two more complaints of sexual harassment pending with the probe team, one against senior law faculty Mohammed Shabbir and another against senior Sanskrit professor Mohammed Sharif.

 While a US research scholar has accused Shabbir of making sexual advances at her while she was interviewing him on Muslim personal law, Hindi literature student Asma Javed has made similar allegations against Sharif.

 Both teachers have been suspended till the probe is over. Both have pleaded innocence. There are prima facie evidences of sexual harassment against the professors, hence they have been suspended, probe team member Kishar said.

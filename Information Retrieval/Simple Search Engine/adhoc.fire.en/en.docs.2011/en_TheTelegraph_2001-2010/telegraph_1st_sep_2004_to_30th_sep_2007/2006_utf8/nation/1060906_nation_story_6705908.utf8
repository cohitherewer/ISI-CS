 Jagat sacked

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 5: Jagat Singh, the son of Natwar Singh and Congress legislator in Rajasthan, has been expelled from the party for indiscipline and misconduct.

 Natwar and Jagat were suspended from the party after the Pathak inquiry commission indicted them for their alleged role in the Iraq food-for-oil scam.

 According to information from Jaipur, a disciplinary committee headed by senior Congress leader Pradhyuman Singh had recommended Jagats expulsion after he failed to reply to a showcause notice issued to him on August 18, following his suspension. Jagat, a sitting MLA from Lakshmangarh, does not lose his Assembly membership. He can continue to be an unattached MLA.

 Rajasthan Congress chief B.D. Kalla said in Jaipur: Defying the showcause notice after suspension from the party on August 18, Jagat not only involved himself in the pro-Natwar swabhimaan rally but also assailed many senior Congress leaders from the dais on August 23, which was highly deplorable. Kalla said a letter informing Jagat about his expulsion had been issued.

 Asked if Natwar would also be expelled, sources said his reply to a showcause notice is under consideration. In his reply last month, the former foreign minister remained defiant and maintained his case should be referred to Sonia Gandhi. He questioned the locus standi of A.K. Antony, the chairman of the disciplinary action committee, and that of another member, Pranab Mukherjee, to take action against him.

 Natwar said Antony and Mukherjee, too, were expelled earlier by the Congress for six years and had floated their own parties. In view of this, my case should be referred to the Congress president, he demanded.

 Delhi sealing drive widens net

 New Delhi (PTI): The Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) intensified its sealing drive on Saturday, with commercial premises in the posh A and B category colonies coming under its ambit.

 The A and B category colonies had so far been spared in the drive that resumed on September 1.

 A Supreme Court-appointed monitoring committee directed the civic body on Friday to continue with the sealing operation.

 MCD personnel began sealing commercial establishments in the upscale areas like Greater Kailash, South Extension, Green Park and Golf Links on Saturday as traders shouted anti-government slogans.

 Around 40,000 commercial establishments, whose owners had given affidavits for voluntary closure, will also be sealed, an MCD spokesperson said.

 The sealing drive has been intensified despite the Centre and the Delhi government issuing notifications to permit trading activities in residential areas.

 The MCD is, however, seeking legal opinion on the committees observations, sources said.

 Krishna in jeans sparks row

 Vrindavan (PTI): Lord Krishna 

 in the famous Banke Bihari temple was allegedly clothed

 Activists of the Samajwadi Party and Krishna devotees took out a march and burnt an effigy of the temple caretakers, blaming them for dressing the idol in modern attire during Anand Mahotsava festivities on Thursday.

 Devotees from around the world flock Vrindavan, 10 km from Mathura, to visit this temple considered auspicious for members of the Hare Krishna cult.

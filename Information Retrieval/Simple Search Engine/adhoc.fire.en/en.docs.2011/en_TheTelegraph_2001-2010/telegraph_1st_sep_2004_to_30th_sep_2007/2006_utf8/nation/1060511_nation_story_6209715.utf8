 Court glare on defaulter DDA

 New Delhi (PTI): A Delhi consumer court 

 has asked the Delhi Development Authority to cough up Rs 

 8.25 lakh for not paying the interest against deposit kept 

 by a housing society for allotment of land. 

 Such conduct of the DDA did not augur well for such a mammoth and monolithic statutory authority... who for a little delay or default on the part of the consumer comes with heavy hand to charge interest at the rate of 18 per cent, said the Delhi State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission. 

 The DDA has been given one month for the payment.

 The Jhelum Arorvansh Co-operative Group Housing Society Ltd had applied to the DDA for a 20,500-sq metre land at Dwarka and deposited Rs 55 lakh in 1990. 

 Later, Delhi High Court had quashed allotment of land to various societies and ordered a refund. The Supreme Court in 1992 ordered the DDA to refund the money within six months. 

 However, the DDA paid the money in five instalments after the deadline expired but did not pay any interest.

 Indian bags fortune in UAE

 Dubai (PTI): An Indian has 

 won the UAEs first national bonds draw worth over 

 Rs 1.1 crore but insisted that he would continue working 

 on his former job. 

 Valiyakath Ebrahim Kutty Abdul Saleem was the first winner to scoop big money in the recently launched national bonds draw. 

 Of course I am very happy as anyone would be with this good fortune but I will continue to live as I always have, the 47-year-old Keralite told the Gulf News. I am going to continue working and bringing my young family up as normal. 

 Saleem wants to donate money to different charities in Kerala. 

 Fake doctor

 Lucknow (PTI): The K.G. Medical 

 University here has cancelled the MBBS degree of a doctor 

 after it found that he had obtained admission showing a 

 fake caste certificate. 

 The university has also asked the Medical Council of India to cancel the registration of Raj Kumar Gupta. 

 Shivani case 

 New Delhi (PTI): Delhi High 

 Court on Wednesday refrained from granting bail to suspended 

 IPS officer R.K. Sharma, prime accused in the Shivani Bhatnagar 

 murder case, as the trial proceedings were expected to be 

 completed by July end. The matter has been posted for July 

 27.

 Blast injures kids

 Varanasi (PTI): Four boys 

 were injured when a country-made bomb exploded in Parsurampur 

 village of Varanasi on Wednesday. The incident took place 

 when a boy lifted a container fitted with two bombs from 

 a heap of garbage. 

 Thakur House, built by the Dutch 300 years ago 

 at Fort Kochi in Kerala and currently owned by a tea company,

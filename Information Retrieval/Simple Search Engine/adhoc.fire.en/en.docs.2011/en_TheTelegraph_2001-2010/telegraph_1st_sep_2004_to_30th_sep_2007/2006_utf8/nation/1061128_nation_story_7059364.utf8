 Judge claims forced exit

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 27: A high court judge who had tendered his resignation in 2003 today approached the Supreme Court seeking reinstatement on the ground that he was forced to put in his papers.

 A bench headed by Chief Justice Y.K. Sabharwal rejected the plea by former Rajasthan High Court judge Arun Madan, who argued that his resignation was not voluntary. 

 Madan, who had quit following allegations by a litigant that he asked for sexual favours, claimed he was made to sign a typed resignation letter. The fact that the letter was typed proves that he was forced to sign, he said.

 Madan cited Article 217 of the Constitution, which says a high court judge may, by writing under his hand addressed to the President, resign his office. 

 But the bench said it would consider the plea only if Madan cites a precedent in which the court had ruled that the resignation had to be made in a judges handwriting. It said the plea could not be entertained also as Madan had filed it after such a long time.

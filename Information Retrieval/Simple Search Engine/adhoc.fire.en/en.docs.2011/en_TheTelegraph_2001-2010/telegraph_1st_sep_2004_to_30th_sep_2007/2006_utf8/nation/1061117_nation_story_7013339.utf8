 Villagers turn in Pak militant

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Srinagar, Nov. 16: A Pakistani Lashkar-e-Toiba militant was turned in by villagers in Kupwara this morning, five days after a suspected Hizb-ul Mujahideen man suffered the same fate.

 Saqib Aziz Malik from Muzaffargarh in Multan was handed over to police after an encounter. Kashmir police chief S.M. Sahai said the police got Maliks custody after residents of Gulgam in Kupwara, 90 km from Srinagar, came forward with information about his presence in the area and then handed him over.

 He (Malik) had escaped from an encounter site and taken refuge in a house, Sahai said. The villagers informed us and handed him over. This is the fourth incident of its type in Kashmir this year.

 Three militants were killed in the daylong encounter at Gulgam yesterday, but Malik had managed to escape.

 Sahai said the militant had crossed the Line of Control from the Machil sector in Kupwara on November 5 and was part of a five-member group trapped in the village. 

 The writing is on the wall. It is a good sign that people are coming forward, Sahai said. 

 Last week, residents of Pulwama district had handed Ghulam Nabi Mir over to the army after he lobbed a grenade outside a mosque, killing several people. The Hizb has disowned Mir, saying he was working with security forces.

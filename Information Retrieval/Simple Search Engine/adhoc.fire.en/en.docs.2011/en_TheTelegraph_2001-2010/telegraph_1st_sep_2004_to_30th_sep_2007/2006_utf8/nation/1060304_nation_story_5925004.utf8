 Congress has battle on hand

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 3: The BJP today said it would give a structured response to the Indo-American nuke deal only after Prime Minister Manmohan Singh makes his statement in Parliament, possibly on Monday.

 The view emerging in the party, however, was that the coupling of the nuke deal with the Iran vote ? a perception the government had tried hard to check but failed ? had spawned the politics of competitive minorityism and the culprits were the Left and the Samajwadi Party.

 The BJP claimed it would not vitiate the ambience despite the wishes of a few, including a general secretary who felt the time was ripe to go back to communal politics and junk issues like price rise and farmers plight.

 The BJP said it would rather wait and watch the Congress stew in its own juice, created by such allegedly overt minority appeasement moves as amending the Foreigners Act in Assam to protect minorities, Muslim reservation and a separate minority affairs ministry.

 The Bush visit, said sources, had in one stroke demolished these planks, and Singh and the Congress would find it hard to explain why.

 A Congress minister shared the BJPs reading and blamed the Left and the Samajwadi Party for communalising the nuke deal-Iran vote. He asked what was the need for CPI leader A.B. Bardhan to address an anti-Bush rally in Delhi on Wednesday organised by the Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind.

 Left sources said Bardhan had offered support on an issue they felt about strongly and there was no communal motivation.

 As the Congress tried to hammer out a campaign to clear the air on the nuke-Iran issues, spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi outlined the broad contours in his press briefing today.

 They include:

 The nuke deal could not be reduced to a single point but should be viewed as part of a large pattern of every co-operation in the context of the energy crunch faced by India;

 It was an Indian proposal, through and through, of India, by India, for India and that the US had wanted much, much more

 The Congress leadership would not have brooked the slightest compromise with Indias sovereignty; and

 The interests of the aam- aadmi were intact because the deal would provide vital inputs of energy to farmers and industry, all of which yield fruits for the aam-aadmi.

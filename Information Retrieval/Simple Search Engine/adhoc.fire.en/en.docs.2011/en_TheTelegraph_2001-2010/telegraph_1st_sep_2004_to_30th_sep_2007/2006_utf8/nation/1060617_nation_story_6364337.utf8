The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Making a difference, with MPs funds

 Bangalore, June 16: At a crossroads just outside Bangalore, an arrow points to Bagalur where a road disappears into the countryside. Turn right and black tarmac stretches out as far as the eye can see.

 The Bangalore North MP has turned a 20-year-old dirt track into a 12.5-km road that matches national highway standards. We can make a difference, if we want to, says H.T. Sangliana, a former police officer who is now the BJP MP.

 My fellow MPs told me not to allocate MPLAD funds for roads as very little will actually go for the work. But after I sanctioned funds, I told the contractor I expect quality work. I not only threatened the poor fellow, but also made surprise inspections at night.

 The ministry of programme implementation made an exception for Sangliana, allowing him to use Rs 1.25 crore for a single project. Members of Parliament get Rs 2 crore a year and have to account for several small projects. 

 They know I am honest. Thats why they approved the project with a rider that it should never be taken as a precedent by other MPs.

 A devout Christian who never misses service on Sundays and sees Gods hand in everything he does, Sangliana is a Mizo whose term as a Karnataka cadre officer has inspired two Kannada films. 

 He defeated former railway minister and Congress heavyweight C.K. Jaffer Sharief and former Union minister C.M. Ibrahim of the JD(S) in the last general elections. 

 At his office, a huge smiling visage greets the visitor along with the words: You are the potter, I am the clay. Make me and mould me, this is what I pray!

 I meet all visitors. Some come for advice, some for jobs, some for transfers, some for passport verification, he says, dressed nattily in a designer shirt and tie.

 Holding court is what Sangliana was famous for even as Bangalores police commissioner, and the sessions were always open to the media. Lurking outside would be rowdies whom he would invite in and say: I will knock you off the rowdy sheeter list if you promise to reform. This promise converted 125, he says. They are still in touch with me and ask what they can do for me now that I am MP, he chuckles.

 Asked how a Christian tribal came to join the BJP, he says: Oh, they were the ones who came last with an offer?. I took it up because they were good people. I dont think they are the type to scare away Christians or burn their prayer houses.

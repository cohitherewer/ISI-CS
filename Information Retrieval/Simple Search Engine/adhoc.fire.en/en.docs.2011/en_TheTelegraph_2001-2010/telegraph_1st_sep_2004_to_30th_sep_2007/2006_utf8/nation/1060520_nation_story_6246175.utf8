 Praveen kin to get car

 Mumbai, May 19: A metropolitan court today directed police to return Praveen Mahajans car but rejected his appeal to be moved from a high-security cell in Arthur Road jail.

 It also deferred the hearing on his application to undergo psychiatric tests. Praveen killed his eldest brother Pramod Mahajan last month.

 A Bhoiwada court magistrate asked the police to return Praveens turquoise blue Maruti Swift to his family after the defence argued the car was not used in the crime. Praveen had driven it to reach Pramods Worli flat before he shot the BJP leader.

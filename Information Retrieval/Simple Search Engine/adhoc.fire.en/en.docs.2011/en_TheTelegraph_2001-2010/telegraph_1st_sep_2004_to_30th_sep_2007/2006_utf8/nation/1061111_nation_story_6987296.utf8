 Partial proof test for Pak

 New Delhi, Nov. 10: At next weeks foreign secretary talks, Delhi will test Islamabad by providing some proof of Pakistani involvement in the Mumbai train blasts and other terror acts in India, government sources said today.

 The officials, however, clarified that Shiv Shankar Menon would not be able to share the entire evidence with Riaz Mohammad Khan when they meet here on November 14 and 15. The reasons are legal: the police havent yet filed a chargesheet in the Mumbai blasts, a source said.

 India, however, will provide enough leads for Islamabad to act on and prove that it is sincere about a joint fight against terrorism, an official said. It will be a test of Pakistans intentions.

 Maharashtra police have accused Pakistani spy agency ISI of masterminding not only the July 11 Mumbai blasts but also the September 8 bombings in Malegaon. 

 Karnataka police have alleged that two men arrested for plotting strikes in Bangalore and Mysore are both Pakistanis.

 There has, however, been some semantic confusion at the top level of the government about whether the July 11 evidence reportedly shared also with Washington is clinching.

 US assistant secretary of state Richard Boucher, who was in Delhi today, accepted that the terrorist groups behind the train blasts had Pakistani links. But he stopped short of backing Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs remark about India having credible evidence against the ISI. Boucher would not say if the attack was sponsored by the Pakistan government.

 New Delhi hopes that the foreign secretaries would finalise the details of the joint mechanism on terrorism, conceived in Havana.

 The sources said the peace process had three legs, the first being Pakistans commitment to fighting terrorism. The second was the resolution of all disputes, including Kashmir, and the third related to building a relationship.

 Although terrorism is the key issue in next weeks talks, the Sir Creek and Siachen disputes are also on the agenda.

 Indian officials, though, played down Pakistan foreign minister Khursheed Mehmood Kasuris recent remark about a solution to Siachen being in sight. They said India had not scaled down the terms it had set for a settlement.

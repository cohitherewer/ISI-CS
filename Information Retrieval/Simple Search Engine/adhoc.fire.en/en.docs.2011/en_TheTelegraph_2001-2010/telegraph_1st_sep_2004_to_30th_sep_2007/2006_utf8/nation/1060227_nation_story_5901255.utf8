 Chennai, Feb. 26: A city couple who forged a chief justices signature to run a job racket were busted when the husband called police after swindled job-seekers locked up his wife.

 Panchaksharam and his wife Vaideygi, both in their 50s, would take sums up to Rs 90,000 from their victims and hand them fake appointment letters for well-paid administrative posts in the high court. 

 The letters would bear the Madras High Court chief justices signature in green ink and the official seals of the court and the state government ? all forged.

 Once the victims produced the letters at the high court, they would be thrown out. 

 The police had been put on the scent of the racket by a woman named Chitra, who alleged Vaideygi had duped her out of Rs 45,000 with the promise of a high court job. But it was the accused themselves who unwittingly provided the breakthrough.

 The couple had been accosted by a group of seven people each of whom they had cheated with fake appointment letters for the job of accounts officer in the high court.

 The victims took them to a building in the citys Mylapore area, locked them inside a room and demanded their money back.

 Panchaksharam was able to convince the captors that if they let him go he would arrange the money. But Vaideygi was held back as hostage.

 After he was released, Panchaksharam went straight to the police alleging his wife had been kidnapped by a gang and offered to lead them to the spot. The police rescued Vaideygi but as they questioned the captors, the whole story spilled out.

 Raids at the couples home threw up 13 forged appointment letters, fake stamp papers and forms and booklets relating to a special provident fund scheme, the police said.

 According to officers, the racket ran into lakhs of rupees. The couple were yesterday remanded in jail by a city magistrate.

 The police said the accused had cheated a large number of job-seekers from Vellore and Pudukottai districts out of hefty sums, ranging from Rs 75,000 to Rs 90,000. Panchaksharam had refunded part of the money to some of the victims after they threatened to call the police.

 Panchaksharam is a former employee of the Metropolitan Transport Corporation, police said. Vaideygi had taken voluntary retirement from state government service four years ago.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Letter appeal to be PM, Sonia cool

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 11: As TV channels flashed the news that Sonia Gandhi had won the Rae Bareli bypoll by over 4 lakh votes, a certain eager beaver in the Congress decided she should replace Manmohan Singh as the Prime Minister.

 Seated in Parliaments Central Hall, MP and former Chhattisgarh chief minister Ajit Jogi whipped out a paper and drafted a letter to the revered leader urging her to become the Prime Minister.

 Jogi said he rustled up the Congress MPs ? 25 in all ? he could spot in the hall and they signed the letter enthusiastically. 

 Congratulating Sonia for the win, the letter said: It is our firm belief that the mandate given by the people of Rae Bareli is a categorical assertion of the hopes and aspirations of the entire nation that you now directly and immediately assume the burden and glory of the government of India. 

 The letter was delivered to Sonia by a flunkey of Jogi. Her response was swift and unequivocal: This talk is wrong. These things should not be talked at all in the party, she told journalists.

 Congress sources said in one stroke she distanced the party from Jogis endeavour and made it clear she disapproved of an individual enterprise.

 Before Sonias statement, the party got into damage-control mode. First, Rajiv Shukla, a spokesperson close to 10 Janpath, came out with a denial. 

 It is learnt that Sonias political adviser, Ahmed Patel, called Jogi and gave him an earful. He was told by Patel to publicly disown the campaign before the media which Jogi did, half-tearfully. 

 Later, he joined the queue of Congress members who called on Sonia in the evening to congratulate her. While others came with bouquets of orchids and tiger lilies, Jogi carried a single red rose. In return, Sonia handed Jogi a red rose, too, accepting his demand to give Rahul Gandhi organisational responsibility. 

 Sources said in the shuffle that will take place after the Parliament session, the Amethi MP would probably be made a general secretary in charge of frontal organisations like the Youth Congress and the National Students Union of India.

 But Jogis letter was not quite the impulsive response it appeared to be. For some time, there has been a buzz in a section of the Congress that the government requires a political Prime Minister and not someone who believes administrative and economic reforms are a panacea for all problems.

 This section was miffed with Singh for not giving Congress MPs time. His doors are always open to the Left members but not us, said a signatory to Jogis letter.

 There was suspicion that human resource development minister Arjun Singh was fanning the dissidence.

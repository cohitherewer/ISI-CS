 Axe looms on secrets act

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 9: The second administrative reforms commission has called for scrapping of the Official Secrets Act of 1923 saying it has a shadow of colonial regime and is incongruous with the kind of transparency necessary in a democratic society.

 The commission, which submitted its first report to the Prime Minister today, has recommended a series of measures for effective implementation of the Right to Information Act at all levels, including the judiciary and legislature.

 While suggesting scrapping of the 83-year-old secrets act, the report, handed in by chairman Veerappa Moily, also suggested that suitable safeguards be incorporated in the National Security Act (NSA).

 The OSA (Official Secrets Act) has a shadow of colonial regime. Some of the provisions of the OSA can be incorporated in NSA, Moily said after his 40-minute meeting with the Prime Minister.

 Minister of state for personnel Suresh Pachauri was present at the meeting.

 Moily said the Prime Minister had assured him that a road map for the implementation of the report would be worked out. Whatever recommendations we gave are practicable for implementation.

 The report has suggested revamping information commissions, saying at least half their members should be drawn from non-civil service background so that they represent the variety in society.

 Moily said the involvement of the bureaucracy in such commissions would not serve the purpose. Their composition, therefore, should have at least 50 per cent from non-civil service.

 The report said the information commissions should be entrusted with the authority and responsibility of monitoring the implementation of the Right to Information Act in all public authorities.

 Holding the complete re-organisation of public records as a condition to effective implementation of the Right to Information Act, the reforms commission has called for the setting up of a public records office in each state as a repository of expertise to monitor, supervise, control and inspect all public records.

 One per cent of the funds for the Centres flagship programmes should be earmarked for updating records and building infrastructure, it said.

 The report suggested NGOs should be brought within the ambit of the Right to Information Act. It insisted on evolving clear guidelines to determine which NGOs would come under the purview of the Act.

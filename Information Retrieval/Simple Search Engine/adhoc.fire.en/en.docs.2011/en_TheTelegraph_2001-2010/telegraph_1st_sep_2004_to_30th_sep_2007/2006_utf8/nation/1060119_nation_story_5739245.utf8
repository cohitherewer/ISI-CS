 Raze big fish houses: Delhi HC 

 New Delhi, Jan. 18 (PTI): Delhi High Court today directed the municipal corporation to take action against the big fish in the capital who are violating building norms.

 The courts rap came on a day Delhi chief minister Sheila Dikshit said an ordinance to regularise unauthorised buildings in the capital ? like the one brought by the Maharashtra government to legalise structures in Ulhasnagar ? was being considered.

 Setting the cut-off date at December 31, 2000, a division bench of Justices Vijender Jain and Rekha Sharma asked the Municipal Corporation of Delhi to remove all illegal constructions that have come up after that. 

 The court told the civic authority not to adopt a pick-and-choose policy while demolishing illegal constructions and to act against the big fish first. It also directed that the structures be razed completely.

 Even illegal constructions in Lal Dora areas, which include villages that are within the city limits but where municipal laws dont apply, should be demolished, the court said. 

 The judges asked the MCD to display on its website the list of illegal constructions with names of the building owners. It said the MCD commissioner, additional commissioner, chief vigilance officer and the chief law officer would be responsible for implementing its order. 

 The court also asked the Delhi Jal Board and power distributors BSES Rajdhani Power Limited and NDPL to withdraw civic amenities in the structures identified as illegal.

 Probe into death after ventilator denial

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Dec. 3: The Prime Ministers Office has asked the Delhi chief secretary to probe the case of Nawaz Hussein, who died at a city hospital allegedly after being denied an automated ventilator.

 The PMOs letter to chief secretary Ramesh Narayanswami follows a petition to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh by Ranadhish Chaudhary, a reader of The Telegraph, which reported the incident. 

 On the night of August 15, Nawaz was rushed to Delhis Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Hospital by his wife Rizwana and their two children, seven-year-old Rizwan and five-year-old Wasim.

 According to Rizwana, Nawaz had high blood pressure and had complained of uneasiness.

 Rizwana has alleged that her husband was denied an electrically operated automated ventilator although two were available then.

 The reason, she said she was told then, was that it being Independence Day, the ventilators had to be reserved for VIPs in case of a terrorist attack. 

 Rizwana was given a manual ventilator, with which she and her sons took turns at trying to keep Nawaz alive. Nawaz died that night.

 The hospital had denied her allegations. However, two doctors independently told The Telegraph that they had received instructions from the medical superintendent to reserve two ventilators for VIPs in the period leading up to Independence Day.

 The medical superintendent of the Hospital is a Delhi government employee, hence the PMOs letter to the Delhi chief secretary, asking him to take action as appropriate.

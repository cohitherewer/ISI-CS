 Blast Pak logistics suspect acquitted 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Oct. 5: The prosecution in the 1993 blasts case suffered a setback today when the anti-terror court acquitted a person charged with financing and arranging trips of five co-accused for arms training in Pakistan.

 The CBI had charged Mohammed Ahmed Mansoor, alleged to be a key aide of prime accused Tiger Memon, with working at the behest of Anees Ibrahim, the younger brother of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim.

 The prosecution was dealt its first major blow on September 28 when the court acquitted five men accused of travelling to Dubai for a conspiracy meeting and planning a trip to Pakistan for arms training.

 In their confession, co-accused Salim Bismillah Khan, Mohammed Hanif Shaikh, Usman Khan, Shaikh Ibrahim Hussain Shaikh and Mohammed Sayeed Mohammed Issac had said a man named Ahmed received them at Dubai airport on January 22, 1993, and arranged for them to be sent to Pakistan.

 But as it could not be established that he was this man, Mansoor had to be let off. 

 We will study the verdict and then decide whether to file an appeal in the Supreme Court, said public prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam.

 However, two other Memon aides were not as lucky. 

 Judge Kode of the anti-terror (Tada) court held Nasir Dhakla and Rafiq Shaikh guilty of undergoing arms training in Pakistan and attending conspiracy meetings with Memon. 

 Dhakla was also held guilty of assisting the landing of arms and explosives on Maharashtras Raigad coast.

 He was, however, acquitted of the charge of filling RDX in vehicles parked across Mumbai on the day of the blasts. 

 The duos conviction has taken the total number of guilty in the blasts case to 28.

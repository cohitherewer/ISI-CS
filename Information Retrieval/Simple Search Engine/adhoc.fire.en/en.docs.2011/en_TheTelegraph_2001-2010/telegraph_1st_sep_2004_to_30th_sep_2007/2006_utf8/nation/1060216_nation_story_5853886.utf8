 Abuse charge against judge

 PTI AND OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi, Feb. 15: A lawyer has accused a judge of outraging her modesty but Delhi High Court has asked the bar association and a veteran advocate to hammer out a settlement.

 The advocate, Navratn Chaudhry, urged the court to direct police to register an FIR against the district and sessions judge, S.N. Dhingra.

 Dhingra, the lone district judge in Delhi, had been asked by the high court to bifurcate the Tiz Hazari courts so that people from other areas of the capital can also avail of legal facilities without having to travel long distances.

 The decentralisation process has pitted many lawyers, who are reluctant to move away from the Tiz Hazari complex, against Dhingra. The lawyers had gone on a strike but the judge refused to be cowed down, asking litigants to represent themselves and courts to take up cases whether advocates turned up or not.

 Sources said the current controversy could have its roots in the standoff. 

 Appearing on behalf of Chaudhry, senior counsel Indira Jaisingh urged the court to direct the police to register cases under Sections 354 IPC (outraging modesty) and 499 (defamatory) against Dhingra for using abusive remarks against the petitioner and other women advocates in his court on February 7.

 The petitioner also wanted the court to initiate contempt proceedings against the judge for reportedly casting aspersions on the virtue of other women advocates.

 Jaisingh complained that besides making a caustic remark against Chaudhry that she had no modesty to be outraged, the judge cast aspersions on the character of women advocates.

 She said Dhingras alleged threat to get woman advocates thrown out of the court and arrested amounted to contempt of court. 

 Jaisingh added that it was the duty of the high court to direct police to register an FIR as complaints made to the Chief Justice of India, the chief justice of high court and the National Human Rights Commission have yielded no result.

 However, the bench of Justices Vijender Jain and Rekha Sharma asked the Delhi High Court Bar Association president, A.S. Chandiok, and Jaisingh to find a settlement. The bench felt that since the matter involved the sensitive relationship between the bar and the judiciary, it would be better if the issue was sorted out across the table.

 Delhi now has three courts ? Tiz Hazari, where 75 per cent of the cases are concentrated, Patiala House, which caters to central Delhi, and Kadkaddooma in the east. Under the bifurcation plan, a part of Tiz Hazari will be moved to Rohini in the north.

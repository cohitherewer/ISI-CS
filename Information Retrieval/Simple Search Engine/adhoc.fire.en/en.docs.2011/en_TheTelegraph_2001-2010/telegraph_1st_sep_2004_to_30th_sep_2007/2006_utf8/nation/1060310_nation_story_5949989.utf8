 Sarabjit loses plea for life

 OUR BUREAU

 Islamabad/Chandigarh, March 9: Hopes for the release of Sarabjit Singh, an Indian sentenced to death in Pakistan on spying and terror charges, were dented today with the Supreme Court here dismissing one of his four review petitions and the government sounding unsure of a presidential pardon.

 The death sentence had sparked a clamour for his release in India last year and prompted diplomatic efforts at the highest level, with Delhi just stopping short of a formal request for clemency.

 The apex court rejected the review petition, saying it had been filed too late, Sarabjits lawyer Rana Abdul Hameed said. Like the convicts family, Rana claims the farmer from Amritsar is innocent and had unwittingly strayed across the border into Pakistan.

 In the early 1990s, two lower courts had sentenced Sarabjit to be hanged in four cases relating to five explosions in Lahore, Kasur and Faisalabad, which left 14 people dead. The Supreme Court upheld each death sentence in August and September last year.

 Rana said a second review petition was still pending. ...But we have no hope. Now the only way out appears to be to file a mercy petition before General Pervez Musharraf seeking his pardon.

 He added the plea would be submitted after the courts verdict on the second petition.

 After todays verdict, Sarabjits family has also pinned all their hopes on Musharraf. We can now only pray at the feet of President Musharraf who can pardon him, said Dalbir Kaur, Sarabjits sister. 

 But Pakistan information minister Sheikh Rashid said he didnt know if Musharraf could pardon him as, according to Islamic law, only family members of those killed can grant clemency to the accused.

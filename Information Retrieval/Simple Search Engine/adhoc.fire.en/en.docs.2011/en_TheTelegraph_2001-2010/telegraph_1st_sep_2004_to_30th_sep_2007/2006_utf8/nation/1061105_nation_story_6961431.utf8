 Plea to stall shop sealing

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 4: The Municipal Corporation of Delhi today filed an application in the Supreme Court citing difficulty in resuming the shop sealing drive in residential areas due to inadequate manpower.

 The manpower crunch, the MCD said, was due to a series of festivals this month, like the Guru Parab and the Sant Nirankari Samagam, when police will have to be deployed in large numbers. 

 Yesterday, too, the MCD filed applications seeking to suspend the sealing drive. But todays application, the civic authorities said, was necessary to place on record some additional facts that would make its resumption difficult. 

 The pleas will come up for hearing on Monday.

 Sources said the MCD filed todays application at the Centres behest. 

 The corporation has said that after reviewing the situation, the government felt it was not conducive to resume the sealing of shops.

 In its application yesterday, the civic authority had requested the Supreme Court to temporarily suspend the drive in view of the sensitive and volatile situation in the capital, specially after the three-day bandh called by traders.

 The MCD said the commencement of the sealing drive at this time would lead to a serious law and order problem.

 Bangalore, June 11: The 

 politics of privatisation stepped onto new territory last 

 night with farmers near Bangalore digging up a 50-metre 

 stretch of the countrys biggest private-sector road 

 project, allegedly incited by the ruling party.

 Local villagers used the parked excavators of the promoter, Nandi Infrastructure Corridor Enterprises, to cut a deep trench across the Bangalore-Mysore expressways peripheral road just a week before it was to be thrown open.

 The villagers grouse is that the company has failed to keep its promise of digging fresh borewells to make up for damaging their drinking water sources; and replacing the seven-foot-wide viaduct with a 30-foot one to allow larger vehicles to ply under the toll road.

 Company officials said the demands were being met in due course and that the villagers were politically instigated.

 The peripheral road connects two national highways leading out of Bangalore. From its mid-point, a 111-km expressway, now partly built, will connect the city with Mysore.

 Ever since it was approved nine years ago, the project has been shackled by a series of obstacles raised by politicians. 

 Former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda has openly opposed the expressway, which he had himself cleared in 1996 as chief minister.

 Pancha Lingaiah, a villager associated with the ruling Janata Dal (Secular), alleged that the company had still not provided jobs to the displaced families as promised.

 Karim Khan, who lost land to the project, said he was bothered less about the poor compensation he was paid (Rs 7 lakh an acre compared with the present Rs 1 crore an acre) and more about the expressway cutting his village off from the local dargah.

 The latest vandalism comes at a time when the Karnataka government, which alleges the company was allotted excess land for the project, is considering a bill to acquire the extra bit back.

 The government, headed by Gowdas son H.D. Kumaraswamy, had tried to stall the project over the excess land issue, but received a bloody nose in the high court and then the Supreme Court.

 The apex court recently cleared the Rs 2,250-crore project, including the five satellite townships along the expressway.

 The state government had only last week handed the promoter a cheque for Rs 5 lakh as legal costs as directed by the court.

 After the farmers action, the company lodged a police complaint. It has, however, promised that the villagers demands would be met before this portion is opened.

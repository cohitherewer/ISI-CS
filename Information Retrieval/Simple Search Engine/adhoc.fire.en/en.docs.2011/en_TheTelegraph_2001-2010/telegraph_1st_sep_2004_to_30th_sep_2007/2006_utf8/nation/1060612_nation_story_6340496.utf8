 Mumbai, June 11: Item girl Rakhi Sawant has alleged that Punjabi pop singer Mika forcibly kissed her in public during his birthday bash last night. 

 Rakhi, whose stage shows in interior Maharashtra were cancelled after protests against her obscene dancing, was among the bunch of Bollywood faces present at the party at the Fun Republic multiplex in Andheri.

 Rakhi and Mika posed for cameras and the item girl pecked him on the cheek. But, things turned ugly after this, according to Rakhi.

 She claimed Mika forcibly kissed her on her lips in public view, which embarrassed her. Rakhi also said Mikas bodyguards assaulted her friends when she protested.

 Mika, who is Punjabi pop singer Daler Mehendis brother, later said: It was done in jest. I and Rakhi perform together in shows. Lets forget it and move on.

 But Rakhi lodged an FIR at Oshiwara police station under Sections 354 (teasing a woman) and 323 (physical assault) against Mika. 

 A police officer confirmed this, saying: Yes, we have registered a complaint at 1 am. We will investigate the complaint. 

 But Daler is upset with the party kissing row involving Mika.

 This party kissing is not Indian culture. Rather, it is an unwelcome intrusion into it, he said over phone from Hyderabad. 

 He suggested that Rakhi and Mika should resolve the matter mutually.

 Rakhi, who is the daughter of a Mumbai assistant commissioner of police, was in the news last month when Kolhapur police registered an obscenity case against her for indecent behaviour and gestures during a dance performance for a beer company. 

 Rakhi was let off with a reprimand. 

 Four days later, the police in Nanded had to resort to a mild lathicharge to disperse an angry mob which tried to disrupt a stage show by Rakhi. The police in Nashik, Aurangabad and other Maharashtra towns then refused permission for any shows featuring her.

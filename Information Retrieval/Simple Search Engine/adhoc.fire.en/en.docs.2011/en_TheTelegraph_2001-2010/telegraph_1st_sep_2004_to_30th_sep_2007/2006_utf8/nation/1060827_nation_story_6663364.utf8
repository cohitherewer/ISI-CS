 PM date with Pervez

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 26: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and President Pervez Musharraf are likely to meet on the sidelines of the Non-Aligned Movement summit in Cuba in September, ending weeks of chill between Islamabad and Delhi after the Mumbai train blasts.

 The Indian high commissioner in Pakistan, Shiv Shankar Menon, and foreign secretary Shyam Saran held discussions with the Prime Minister this evening on the agenda of the NAM meeting, slated for September 15 and 16.

 After the July 7 blasts that killed more than 180 people, Delhi, indicating Pakistans possible involvement, had indefinitely suspended the peace process by postponing the dialogue between the two foreign secretaries.

 Sources said India would raise the subject of cross-border terrorism with the Pakistan leadership at Cuba. Delhi has already expressed its disappointment at Islamabads failure to dismantle the terrorist training camps operating from its territory.

 India claims there are at least 50 such camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.

 Just before Menon briefed Manmohan, his Pakistan counterpart, Aziz Ahmed Khan, had travelled to Islamabad to hold discussions with Musharraf on India-Pakistan relations. Islamabad is keen to resume the composite dialogue.

 After the NAM summit, Manmohan and Musharraf are likely to meet on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly, also scheduled in September.

 After the Mumbai blasts, the foreign secretaries had met in Dhaka but failed to draw up a road map to resume the peace talks.

 India has been firm on the demand that Islamabad take action on the ground to prove that it is not supporting terrorism anymore.

 The third round of the composite dialogue was to end with the foreign secretary-level talks last month. 

 India and Pakistan have rounded up discussions on several issues, ranging from Sir Creek, Siachen and terrorism to hydel power projects, without reaching a settlement.

 The two neighbours, however, have renewed their commitment to continue with the confidence-building measures.

 India yesterday informed Islamabad that it is temporarily suspending the Thar Express because of damage to the railway tracks by floods in Rajasthan.

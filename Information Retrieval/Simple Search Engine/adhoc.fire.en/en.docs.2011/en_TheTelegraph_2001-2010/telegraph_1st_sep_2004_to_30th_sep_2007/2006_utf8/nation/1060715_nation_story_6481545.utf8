 New Delhi, July 14: The Mumbai train blasts appear to have brought the government and the ruling Congress, which have been speaking in different voices on inflation, food imports and divestment, on the same plane. 

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh told the media in Mumbai that the militants who carried out Tuesdays blasts were instigated and supported by elements across the border, and warned Pakistan it would be exceedingly difficult to carry forward the peace process if it did not rein in the terrorist elements.

 In Delhi, Congress spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi said: Congress doesnt believe in suspension of talks. But it cannot be a one-way street. We cant have these things in an ambience of distrust, terror and deaths.

 Cross-border terrorism has neither diminished nor changed its form, colour, content or character. Interests inimical to India are being allowed to act with impunity from across the border. 

 Singhvi warned that if the atmosphere did not immediately improve, nothing can be ruled out. Sources later clarified that the threat meant nothing drastic. 

 He only meant talks at any level cannot be resumed unless and until Pakistan demonstrates tangible results on the ground on cross-border terrorism. But as a party, we cannot exceed our mandate and announce that secretary-level talks or talks at some other rung cannot take place. The government will have to take a call on that, a source said. 

 The Congress has taken a grim view of the alleged interventions of senior ministers Arjun Singh and A.R. Antulay when the Union cabinet yesterday discussed the Mumbai blasts. 

 As national security adviser M.K. Narayanan pointed a finger at Pakistan, the human resource development minister reportedly quoted a Maharashtra judge as having alleged that the aborted attack on RSS headquarters in Nagpur was set up by the Sangh itself. Antulay reportedly spoke of how a blast in Maharashtras Nanded in April was executed by people posing as members of the minority community.

 While the Prime Minister said such divisive issues should not be raised in the cabinet meeting, a senior Congress functionary wondered why Arjun and Antulay were bent on playing vote-bank politics all the time. 

 On terrorism and foreign policy, there is nothing like the PMs, Arjuns or Congresss view. The nations view is our view. And the view right now is, enough of confidence-building measures and talks.

 The party would not comment on the alleged role of locals. Asked to comment on Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadavs clean chit to the Students Islamic Movement of India, one of the prime suspects, Singhvi said: Simi is a banned organisation under the law of this land. 

 Sources said right now, the strategy is to limit the focus on Pakistan. More concrete leads and evidence are needed before we open our mouths on extra-sensitive matters like Simi and the role of locals, a source said.

 The government-party coordination is the outcome of the efforts of Janardhan Dwivedi, the newly-appointed chairman of the Congresss media department. He was in touch with information and broadcasting minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi and the minister of state in the PMO, Prithviraj Chavan, before formulating the party line on Pakistan. 

 Sources said Dwivedi impressed on the Prime Minister and finance minister P. Chidambaram that just as the other UPA constituents had the right to raise their demands, the Congress, too, should not be denied this privilege.

 Nuke deal hint to Japan

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Tokyo, Dec. 14: While the economic agenda has dominated Manmohan Singhs visit here, Japans response to the Indo-US nuclear deal is believed to be the major point of interest of the behind-the-scenes parleys.

 In his speech in the Japanese parliament, Singh made no direct reference to the deal. He spoke of the need for cooperation between the two countries on energy security. But there was no mistaking the veiled reference to it when he said: Our region as a whole needs the assurance of the security of energy supplies and the efficient functioning of the energy markets.

 India sees nuclear power as a viable and clean energy source to meet its growing energy needs. Singh sought Japans support in helping put in place innovative and forward-looking approaches of the international community to make this possible.

 The message, according to Indian officials here, is Japan, being a member of the Nuclear Suppliers Group, could smooth the way for international endorsement of the deal.

 Singh, however, assured Diet members that Indias commitment to universal nuclear disarmament remains unshaken.

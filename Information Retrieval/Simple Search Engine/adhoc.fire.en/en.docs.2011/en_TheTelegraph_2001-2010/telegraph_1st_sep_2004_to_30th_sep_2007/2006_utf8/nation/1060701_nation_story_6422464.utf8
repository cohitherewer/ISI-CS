 Naga leader clears air

 New Delhi, June 30: The National Socialist Council of Nagalim (Isak-Muivah) has clarified that it was not amenable to the idea of Nagas settling within the Indian Union, reports our special correspondent.

 NSCN (I-M) general secretary Thuingaleng Muivah today clarified that contrary to some reports in the Indian media, his organisation had not accepted that Nagas were willing to settle within the Indian Union. 

 What we have been proposing is that Nagalim and India should become a federation. The relationship of the federation of India and Nagalim will be based on the agreement arrived at between the two sides, he said in a telephone conversation with The Telegraph from the Netherlands.

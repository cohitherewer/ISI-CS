 Multiple voices on PMs minority speech 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Dec. 10: In the middle of an expected BJP build-up against the Prime Ministers statement on minorities, a jarring note has been struck from within the government.

 Hours after the PMO issued a statement that Manmohan Singh did not mean Muslims alone when he listed the sections that should have the first claim on resources, Union minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi declared that such a clarification was completely uncalled for.

 Ironically, in between, the Congresss official spokesperson, Janardhan Dwivedi, had said the clarification was necessary.

 Referring to Prime Ministers speech at the National Development Council yesterday, the PMO said the reference to the first claim on resources referred to all priority areas, including programmes for the uplift of scheduled castes and tribes, other backward classes, women, children and minorities.

 An avoidable controversy has been created by deliberate and mischievous misinterpretation of his remarks, the PMO statement added, accusing some sections of the electronic media of fuelling a baseless controversy.

 In his speech, the Prime Minister had said: I believe our collective priorities are clear: agriculture, irrigation and water resources, health, education, critical investment in rural infrastructure and essential public investment needs of general infrastructure along with programmes for upliftment of SCs/STs, OBCs, minorities and women and children.

 The component plans for SCs and STs will need to be revitalised. We will have to devise innovative plans to ensure that minorities, particularly the Muslim minority, are empowered to share equitably in the fruits of development. They must have the first claim on resources.

 However, Das Munshi, the information and broadcasting minister, said: There was nothing unconstitutional about what the Prime Minister said. It is in keeping with the mandate of the UPA and the spirit of the common minimum programme. The clarification was completely uncalled for and it has ended up creating more confusion.

 It was not clear whether the PMO issued the clarification on its own and whether the political leadership was in the picture.

 A section of the party already feels that the Prime Minister is too apolitical. With Assembly elections round the corner in Uttar Pradesh, which has a sizeable Muslim population, the Congress would not have minded a controversy that painted it minority-friendly.

 Das Munshis aggressive stand also reflects a tussle within the Congress, involving veterans such as Arjun Singh and A.R. Antulay, to capture the minority mantle. 

 The multiple voices within the Congress came amid threats by the BJP to rake up the issue in Parliament tomorrow. The deputy leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, V.K. Malhotra, said the Prime Ministers remarks were a matter of grave concern as they amount to dividing the countrys resources on religious lines.

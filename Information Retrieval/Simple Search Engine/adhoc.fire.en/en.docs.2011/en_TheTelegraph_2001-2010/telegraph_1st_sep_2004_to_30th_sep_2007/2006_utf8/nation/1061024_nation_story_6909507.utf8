 Bias PIL on AIIMS

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 23: A 13-member 

 independent team probing allegations of caste discrimination 

 at AIIMS plans to file a public interest litigation in the 

 Supreme Court against the institutes administration.

 The team, comprising social activists and members of the Union home ministrys National Integration Council, has recommended that the government introduce an equal opportunities bill in Parliament to ensure that students from the reserved categories do not face any discrimination in higher educational institutes.

 After hearing about media reports on the alleged discrimination against SC/ST students, we were shocked. Unfortunately, our findings are that the media reports were completely accurate and discrimination does go on, said N. Paul Diwakar of the National Campaign on Dalit Human Rights, one of the teams members.

 A health ministry committee is also probing the alleged bias at AIIMS first reported by The Telegraph.

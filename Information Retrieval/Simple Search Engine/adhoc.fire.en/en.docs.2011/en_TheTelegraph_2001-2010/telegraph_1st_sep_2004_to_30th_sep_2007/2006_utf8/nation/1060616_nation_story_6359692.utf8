 Insourcing after complaints

 AMIT ROY

London, June 15: In what is probably the first 

important example of insourcing, British energy giant Powergen announced 

today that its call centre operation was being recalled from India back to the 

UK.

 The number of jobs involved was not disclosed but Powergen said the reason for the recall was that a number of customers had lodged complaints. The nature of these complaints was not specified, however.

 It was also stated that it would be easier to manage and train staff in the UK.

 This is a setback for India and the first victory for the white collar union Amicus, which has long campaigned for an end to outsourcing of jobs to India.

 David Fleming, national officer of Amicus, said: We welcome Powergens announcement. It is becoming increasingly clear that the business case for offshoring is being eroded by the day.

 He alleged: There is a growing crisis in the Indian call centre and back office industry. Labour costs are rising, turnover is spinning out of control and middle management are ill equipped to deal with the challenges of managing offshore services. We will see more and more companies looking back towards the UK as they realise the high-skilled, low-cost spin sold to them by consultants was exactly that ? spin.

 Powergen shifted its call centre operation to India almost five years ago, but from today all queries from its customers will be answered at the companys five UK call centres in Bedford, Bolton, Leicester, Nottingham and Rayleigh in Essex.

 Powergen said some calls to customers and letter-writing will continue to be made from India, but this will stop at the end of the year.

 Nick Horler, managing director of Powergen, said: Offshore call centres may have their place for certain industries. However, we believe that we can best achieve industry-leading customer service by operating solely in the UK. When customers contact us they need to be confident that their query will be fully resolved quickly.

 He added: Although the cost of overseas outsourcing can be low, were simply not prepared to achieve savings at the risk or expense of customer satisfaction.

 Air force call to shop to stay fighting fit

 New Delhi, April 2: The Indian Air Force is struggling to keep its fighter aircraft fleet from being depleted by obsolescence and has proposed a quick buy of new Mirage 2000-V aircraft and hastened deliveries of the Sukhoi 30 Mki.

 Fresh proposals to keep its fleet at the authorised strength of 39.5 squadrons are being made by the IAF because of lapses in its procurement programme even as the government uses a global tender for 126 multi-role combat aircraft as a bait to score diplomatic points with.

 Air headquarters is asking the government for a go-ahead to a proposal to buy 20 Mirage 2000-V aircraft off the shelf from Frances Dassault Aviation. Exact figures are dependent on price negotiations and configurations of equipment but a Mirage 2000-V off the shelf could cost upwards of Rs 180 crore each.

 Officially, the reason for the delay in issuing the request for proposal (RFP) for the 126 multi-role combat aircraft is that the document was being redrafted to bring it in line with the new procurement policys offset clause. The RFP is pending for nearly six months even after the companies responded to the air forces request for information more than a year ago.

 Lockheed Martin with its F-16, Boeing with its F/A-18 E/F Superhornet, MiG Corporation with its MiG 29M/M2, Saab with its Grippen and Dassault Aviation are among the contenders for the order but the IAF expects more companies to bid once the RFP is issued.

 Dassault Aviation is reported to be in the process of winding up its Mirage 2000 production line and is now pushing the Raphael. The IAF has three squadrons of Mirage 2000H and for many in the force, it is the favoured fighter aircraft.

 The real reason for the delay in formulating the RFP is probably diplomatic. As a pay-off to the US for the nuclear deal that US President George W. Bush committed to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh during his visit, India is dangling the order for the American companies as a bait.

 The US government and the Bush administration have been trying to sell to its domestic audience that the nuclear deal for India will have significant spin-offs in several sectors, one of which is the military-industrial. An order of 126 F-16s, for instance, will mean a big boost to Lockheed Martin, which has its facilities in, among other places, Texas.

 In a parallel development, the Cabinet Committee on Security in two sittings considered asking the public sector Hindustan Aeronautics Limited to speed up deliveries of Sukhoi 30 Mki, which are being produced under licence from Irkutsk and Sukhoi of Russia. 

 Three different sets of agreements were signed with the Russians and the final one in 2000 stipulated that Irkutsk would supply 50 Sukhoi 30 Mki and eventually the IAF would acquire a total of 190 aircraft.

 The licence-produced Sukhois are to be delivered by 2013 but the government, under pressure from the IAF that is worried about the depletion in its fighter-squadron strength, is asking HAL to complete deliveries about five years earlier. 

 The financial implications of the move are not yet clear but the licence-produced Sukhois come for about $22.5 million each.

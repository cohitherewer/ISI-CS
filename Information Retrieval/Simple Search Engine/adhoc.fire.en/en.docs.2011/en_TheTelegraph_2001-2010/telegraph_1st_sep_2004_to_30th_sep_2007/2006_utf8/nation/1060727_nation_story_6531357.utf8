 Steel giants in ore snub

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Ranchi, July 26: Steel Authority of India (SAIL) and Tata Steel have turned down the governments request to provide iron ore from their captive mines to some of the new companies that have set up units in the state.

 The two behemoths today told the Arjun Munda government that their own steel production would get adversely affected if they start sharing iron ore. 

 The decision comes at a time when the government is scurrying to convince companies like Mittal Steel that it would be able to provide the required iron ore. 

 SAIL and Tata Steel have their captive mines in West Singhbhum. SAILs four iron ore mines are located at Kiriburu, Meghataburu, Gua and Chiriya. Tata Steels lone mine is at Noamundi.

 Over a month ago, the mines and geology department had suggested to the two companies that they spare about 25,000 tonnes of iron ore each month to companies which do not have captive mines.

 The governments suggestions came in the wake of requests made by five new units that they should get enough iron ore for production. 

 The steel giants shot down the request at a meeting today with mines secretary Santosh Kumar Satpathy. Officials of SAIL and Tata Steel expressed their inability to comply with the governments requests. Satpathy has asked them to explain their position in writing by August 15, said a source in the mines department.

 SAIL officials reportedly argued that iron ore, mined from Kiriburu and Meghataburu for Bokaro Steel Plant, was not sufficient. 

 Bokaro Steels requirement this financial year is about 7.94 million tonnes of iron ore from Meghataburu and Kiriburu. But production of iron ore at the two mines cannot exceed 7.59 million tonnes at this juncture, said a mines department official.

 The Chiriya and Gua mines supply ore to SAILs plant at Burnpur in Bengal. There would not be any surplus ore either at Gua or Chiriya that could be given to other industrial units, an official said.

 Tata Steel depends on the Noamundi iron ore mines, which provide about 5 million tonnes against the demand of 9 million tonnes a year. The rest, explained company officials, is met from mines in Orissa.

 Sources in the mines department said the West Singhbhum-based Rungta Mines has been approached to provide iron ore for the new players. 

 Satpathy acknowledged that both SAIL and Tata Steel were not in a position to provide iron ore to other players. Both these companies have to meet their own requirements first, he said.

 Land gift to farmers 

 Jammu, Dec. 29: Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Ghulam Nabi Azad is trying to don the farmer-friendly cap of Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah. He announced yesterday that tillers could become owners of government land in their illegal possession by paying only 10 per cent of the cost, reports our correspondent.

 Azad said farmers occupying such land could buy up to 12.5 acres by paying just 10 per cent of the total price. That price, too, would be fixed at a subsidised rate of one-fourth of the market price. It is virtually free, he said.

 More than 250,000 acres is under illegal occupation and the market price of the land is estimated at Rs 25,000 crore.

 Azad drew parallels with the land to tiller scheme launched by first chief minister Abdullah in 1950 to allow landlords to keep up to 22 acres, handing over the rest to the tillers.

 Jaya doubts Stalin attack

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chennai, June 22: Jayalalithaa today said the recent attempt on the life of DMK youth wing leader M.K. Stalin could have been stage-managed.

 The incident seems incredulous going by reports coming from there and the way it is being sarcastically talked about among people, she said.

 A CRPF constable had foiled the attempt by an unknown assailant who tried to attack Stalin with a knife when he got off at Madurai station.

 Jayalalithaa asked if there was anything for police to probe when the veracity of events at Madurai station was under question. The Tamil Nadu government has transferred the case from railway police to the CID considering the seriousness of the issue.

 Why all this drama? asked Jayalalithaa. If they (the DMK regime) had desired that Mr Stalin be given Z-category security (which he has been provided after the Madurai incident), they could have given it directly.

 Rebutting chief minister M. Karunanidhis statement that security for Jayalalithaa had not been scaled down after her defeat in the recent polls, the former chief minister said the situation on the ground was there for everyone to see. All the visitors to my house are remarking that security is virtually non-existent, she said.

 Jayalalithaa disagreed that the threat to her life was any less than that to the DMK chiefs. What security threat does he face, particularly when he is known to be soft towards Tamil militant groups, a friend of the LTTE and a closer friend of the slain brigand Veerappan? she asked. It is I who face a real security threat, as I had crushed extremist forces like the TNLA in Tamil Nadu with an iron hand.

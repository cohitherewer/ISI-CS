 Statue mud on Uddhav

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 The statue of Meenatai Thackeray

 Mumbai, Oct. 11: Bal Thackerays estranged nephew Raj today insinuated that the Shiv Sena bosss son Uddhav had himself desecrated his mother Meenatais statue in July for political gain.

 The allegation came a day after a streetfight erupted in Dadar between Sena cadre and supporters of Rajs breakaway Maharashtra Navanirman Sena (MNS) after a poster of Thackeray was torn down.

 Everybody knows who defaced the statue. Dont make me open my mouth, a bristling Raj told reporters, pointing a finger at his cousin.

 The Shiv Sena is devoid of any issues. They are doing every possible thing to gain public sympathy. There was no defacement of Balasahebs poster by our cadre.

 Like the streetfight over the poster last evening, Sena cadre had gone on rampage in July after the statue of Meenatai Bal Thackerays late wife was defaced.

 Raj apologised for the Dadar flare-up, in which 30 people were injured, but put the blame on the Sena. Denying any poster had been torn, he said: There were arguments between supporters of the parties over putting up posters.

 Uddhav followed it up with a rejoinder at a news conference an hour later, attributing the clashes to the MNSs desperate reaction.

 They (MNS) are doing all this because they are frustrated that those who left Shiv Sena to join their fold are returning to us. We dont believe in attacking anyone first, but we are more than ready to retaliate when attacked.

 There had been an exodus from the Sena into the MNS when Raj floated the party last year. Raj, seen as Thackerays heir apparent, had quit after Uddhav was handed the Sena reins.

 Despite the war of words, Raj conceded that people 15 prominent leaders have gone back to the Sena had been deserting his party. I dont want those who have betrayed MNS back in the party.

 Police have picked up 25 people, including Sena and MNS leaders, for the flare-up.

 Those arrested include Sena MLA Sada Sarvankar, Sena students wing president Abhijit Panse and youth leader Milind Vaidya.

 The situation in Shivaji Park was tense but under control this morning.

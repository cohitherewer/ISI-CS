 - Bad publicity forces govt 

to clear legal amendments

 The 

 Targets

 The amendments are aimed 

 at preventing:

 Online data theft

 Video voyeurism

 Identity theft

 e-commerce fraud

 Privacy violation 

New Delhi, Oct. 16: BPOs, be warned. Data theft could soon saddle you with fines as high as Rs 5 crore and land your employees behind bars.

 Stung by the adverse publicity from sting operations on data theft, the Centre has decided to amend the law to hold companies accountable and impose punishments ranging from fines to imprisonment.

 A new section will be added to the information technology act to make protection of clients sensitive data the responsibility of companies and organisations.

 Companies found lax in protecting data would be forced to cough up Rs 5 crore as compensation to the affected party, according to the amendment proposal.

 Besides, if information is passed to a third party without the consent of the client, it will be considered a criminal offence. Violation will attract imprisonment of up to 2 years or fine of up to Rs 5 lakh or both.

 The amendments, which will be tabled in Parliament in the winter session, were cleared by the cabinet today.

 The trigger appeared to be a UK television channel that showed alleged middlemen, including one from Calcutta, offering to sell confidential information sourced from call centres.

 Concerns have been raised both within the country as well as by customers abroad on adequacy of data protection and privacy laws in the country, said Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, the minister who briefed the media after the cabinet meeting. A need is, therefore, felt to strengthen the legislation pertaining to data protection and privacy.

 The amendments are also aimed at preventing computer misuse like video voyeurism, identity theft, e-commerce fraud and sending offensive emails.

 Message fiends will face punishment of up to two years with fine and computer hackers will be imprisoned for two years or fined up to Rs 5 lakh. E-commerce fraud could attract imprisonment of up to five years and fine.

 Last week, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, while visiting London, had assured British investors that India was sensitive to their concerns about data theft and would plug loopholes.

 Indias apex infotech body, the National Association of Software and Services Companies (Nasscom), said it was hopeful that the proposed amendments to the act would lead to better handling of cyber crime by enforcement authorities.

 The proposed amendments will further strengthen the Indian information technology act and secure the legislative framework for security practices in the Indian business process outsourcing sector, Nasscom said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Liveable, via metro

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, June 21: The Prime Minister today laid the foundation stone for Mumbais metro rail project with a call to make Indian cities more liveable and people-friendly.

 The Rs 19,525-crore project will make Mumbai the third metropolis after Calcutta and New Delhi to offer commuters cheap, comfortable and fast travel.

 When this is completed in phases, I am confident that it will make Mumbai a more liveable city, a better connected city, a city where distances shrink with the passage of time. I hope that the Mumbai metro, like the Delhi metro, becomes a symbol of efficiency and economy, Manmohan Singh told a packed Shanmukhananda Hall.

 The nine-corridor network is expected to be complete by 2021. When the first leg ? the 11.4 km Versova-Andheri-Ghatkopar stretch ? is finished, possibly by December 2009, commuters will be able to travel east-west without getting broiled inside a crowded bus or paying the high auto-rickshaw fares.

 In total, the metro rail will stretch for 146 km, of which 32 km will be underground. There will be 36 stations, 11 of them underground. The elevated part will be 12 metres above the ground. The fares are expected to be between Rs 8 and Rs 10.

 The Prime Minister spoke of the need to upgrade urban infrastructure and stressed the importance of the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission that pledges to pump Rs 50,000 crore into 60 cities over the next five years.

 He said that in a few years, over 40 per cent of the population would live in urban areas, and cities would become the hubs of economic, commercial and social activities.

 Prosperity and progress radiate from urban hubs into the rest of the country. Rough estimates indicate that urban areas account for 50-60 per cent of our GDP (gross domestic product). And this urban space has sadly suffered from years of neglect, Singh said.

 We have to invest in public transport, in roads with space for bicycles and pedestrians, in sanitation, in public parks, in water bodies, in airports, in railway stations, and many other amenities of modern life. Our citizens expect all this from the government. Our cities have to become more liveable and more people-friendly.

 A consortium led by Anil Ambani groups Reliance Energy Ltd will build the first phase of the Mumbai metro. Reliance Energy will pick up 74 per cent of the Rs 2,356-crore tab while the Mumbai Metropolitan Regional Development Authority will supply the other 26 per cent.

 Anil Ambani today had mother Kokilaben by his side when Manmohan unveiled the foundation stone.

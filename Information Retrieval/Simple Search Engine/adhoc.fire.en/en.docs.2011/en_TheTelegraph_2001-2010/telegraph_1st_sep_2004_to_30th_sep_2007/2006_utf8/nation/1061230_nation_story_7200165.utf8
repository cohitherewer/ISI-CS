 Calcutta CAS clock ticks

 - Govt asks broadcasters and police to keep watch

 A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta, Dec. 29: With 48 hours to go for the conditional access system (CAS) to enter homes in parts of the city, the Bengal government asked broadcasters to assess preparedness and police to monitor violations after the rollout.

 According to our assessment, of the five city multi-system operators (MSOs), SitiCable and Cablecom are well prepared, while Manthan Broadband is not. Kolkata Cable and Broadband Pariseva has lost some of its crucial cable operators, while Srishti, the MSO for Behala area, is not prepared at all, said information and cultural affairs secretary Dilip Chakraborty. 

 He was speaking after a meeting between the state information and cultural affairs department, and broadcasters Sony, ESPN, STAR and Zee at Writers Buildings today.

 The team of broadcasters, accompanied by director of films division in the central government, Abhijit Sanyal, is conducting a check on Srishtis control room to assess its CAS status. If we find them unprepared, well report the matter to the information and broadcasting ministry and see if operations in that area can be allotted to an MSO thats better prepared, Chakraborty said.

 CAS will come into effect in Kidderpore, Garden Reach, Chetla, Alipore, New Alipore, Behala, Thakurpukur, Parnasree, Budge Budge and Maheshtala at December 31-January 1 midnight.

 Viewers in these areas who havent ordered set-top boxes or opted for a direct-to-home (DTH) connection will be able to watch only free-to-air channels, mostly the government-run Doordarshan and some regional channels.

 Only 35,000 of the over 3.5 lakh TV owners who have applied for set-top boxes will get pay channels. But the government feels the new-year blackout of pay channels will trigger a flood of orders and demand will outstrip supply.

 The administration has been roped in, too. The information and cultural affairs department has asked Calcutta police and the district administration of South 24-Parganas under which most of the CAS areas fall to ensure no unencrypted signals (of pay channels) are beamed from December 31.

 At a meeting with the deputy commissioner of police and the additional district magistrate of South 24-Parganas today, we have asked them to conduct random checks to find out whether MSOs are illegally beaming unencrypted signals, said Chakraborty.

 Officials say a fingerprinting technology helps them determine if MSOs are drawing unencrypted signals. We need police to control the law and order situation that might arise after the channel blackout, an official said.

 The information and broadcasting ministry said CAS will also roll out in some areas of Delhi on December 31. There is no possibility of any extension in the deadline. In fact, the government will take action, including criminal proceedings, against MSOs and cable operators who dont meet the deadline, an official said.

 Advising consumers not to defer CAS plans, the ministry made it clear that an extension wasnt possible because the deadline had been set by Delhi High Court. The ministry doesnt have the power to order an extension.... The transition time to run encrypted and unencrypted channels and switching off pay channel signals in unencrypted format began from December 16 and will end on December 30, the ministry said in a statement today.

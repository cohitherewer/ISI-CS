 Bunty bash, Umrao style 

 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY

 Lucknow, Jan. 29: The music may have been Bunty aur Babli, but the mood was predominantly Umrao Jaan.

 Lucknow boy Shaad Ali, having achieved his big city dream in Mumbai, was getting married to long-time girlfriend Shazneen Hussain in their hometown yesterday.

 The venue, a five-star hotel near Gomtinagar, was fittingly bathed in neon as it welcomed its Bollywood guests to the tunes of Kajra re and Bunty aur Babli. But the old Lakhnavi charm was unmistakable in the invitees sherwanis and churidars and the fragrance of aatar (traditional perfume) wafting through the air.

 The young maker of Bunty aur Babli was playing the lead role as bridegroom, but there could be little doubt that it was father Muzaffar Ali who had provided the direction.

 The veteran filmmaker, who had two decades ago memorably portrayed the life of a Lucknow courtesan in Umrao Jaan, had designed the wedding cards and overseen the entire arrangements, including the preparation of the Mughlai wedding feast.

 Shaads mother and CPI leader Subhasini Ali had lent her touch, adding a tinge of the Marxist red to the mehndi as she joined the traditional jig at Fridays pre-wedding ceremonies at the brides place, Habibullah Estate.

 Among the guests were Pakistan high commissioner Aziz Ahmed Khan and Tata Steel managing director J.J. Irani. The brides father, Ishaq Hussain, is a senior director with Tata Steel.

 Shazneens maternal grandfather, the late General Habibullah, had served the Indian army while Shaads grandmother Laxmi Sehgal had fought for Independence with Netaji Subhas Chandra Boses forces.

 We are very happy with our childrens decision. We are looking forward to strengthening the bonds further, said an ecstatic Begum Habibullah, who counts Sehgal as one of her closest friends.

 Shazneen, who studied in Mumbai and London, has specialised in photography.

 EC chief role in sack for Chawla

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 23: Chief election commissioner B.B. Tandon today told the Supreme Court that neither he nor the President can act on his own to oust Naveen Chawla as election commissioner.

 Tandon cited an 11-year-old apex court ruling to argue that the President is bound to seek the poll panel chiefs recommendation if one of the latters subordinates is to be removed.

 On the other hand, the commission chief said, he himself cannot act on the MPs memorandum seeking Chawlas removal ? on the ground of his proximity to a political party ? until the President formally seeks his recommendation.

 CEC (chief election commissioner) cannot suo motu (on his own) act on the said memorandum without awaiting formal reference from the President, Tandon, who retires on June 29, said.

 The court was hearing a petition by BJP leader Jaswant Singh asking whether it was right for Chawla to stay on the panel. 

 The petitioner suggested that the memorandum signed by 205 MPs, which the President had forwarded to the government, be referred to the poll panel chief instead.

 Tandon said that if the apex court directed the Centre to refer the memorandum to the chief election commissioner, he would make his appropriate recommendation to the President.

 He said the apex court had, in the 1995 T.N. Seshan case, held that a poll commissioner could not be removed except on the election panel chiefs recommendation.

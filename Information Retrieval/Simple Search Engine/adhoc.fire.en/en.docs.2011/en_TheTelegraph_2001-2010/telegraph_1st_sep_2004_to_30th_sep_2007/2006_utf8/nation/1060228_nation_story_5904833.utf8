 Beauty queen in sleaze web

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Kamna

 Lucknow, Feb. 27: Her looks had made her ambitious, and her ability to quote Maya Angelou and Paolo Coelho before beauty pageant judges kept the awards coming till Kamna Chaudhary found herself crowned Miss Agra in 2003.

 For the undergraduate daughter of a conservative Agra homoeopath, life would have seemed a page out of Coelhos The Alchemist ? a parable celebrating the power of dreams and the miraculous ways they can come true.

 Now, caught up in a vortex of alleged abductions, sleaze CDs and blackmail ? and said to be held captive with police help by a man accused of forcibly marrying her ? she might turn to the life of fellow beauty queen Anara Gupta for a parable: One on the dangers that can waylay small-town women who dream of making it big through their looks.

 Former Miss Jammu Anara Gupta, who was detained by police on the charge of acting in porn films, has been cleared by a forensic laboratory after nearly a year of mental agony and harassment. But the 25-year-old Kamnas story stays an ever-deepening mystery, not least because of her own conflicting statements on her relationship with husband Hemant Kumar.

 The girl was kidnapped in 2004 by Hemant ? a photographer and owner of two local TV channels ? an FIR lodged by her father R.S. Chaudhary in May that year says. Hemant allegedly took her to the Arya Samaj Mandir and forced her to marry him.

 Chaudhary says Hemant and his friends gangraped her, took smutty photographs and began blackmailing him with a demand for Rs 10 lakh.

 Kamna, however, appeared before an Agra magistrate on August 3, 2004, and said she was staying with her husband of her own will. Seven months later, in March 2005, she returned to the same court to claim she had been forced to make the earlier statement. She alleged she was being held captive by Hemant with the help of the local police and some journalists.

 The court sent her home to her father, but days later, Chaudhary claims, she was kidnapped again. Soon, sleaze CDs flooded Agra with her face morphed on those of the female actors, he said.

 After the Allahabad High Court declined to intervene, Chaudhary approached the apex court and the state womens commission. A commission representative, Ashoke Pandey, went to Hemants home on December 10 and reported: In my presence and that of the police, two persons virtually threatened her and dragged her away after she made allegations against the police and the so-called husband.

 The commission summoned her and Hemant to Lucknow on December 14. Kamna said she was tortured and showed injury marks all over her body, commission sources said. If I say anything, Ill be killed. Policemen are helping my abductors, Kamna said.

 The commission sent her to her parents, but on December 16, she was apparently kidnapped again.

 Chaudhary moved the Supreme Court, but by then Kamna had provided her latest flip-flop, telling a counsellor she wished to live with Hemant. Chaudhary lost the case last week.

 This is a case complicated by Kamnas contradictory statements, a police officer in Lucknow said. What is she so scared of? Her conflicting statements will only ruin her case and reputation.

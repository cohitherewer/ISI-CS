 Minor plea

 New Delhi, Dec. 28: An accused cannot seek benefits available to juveniles if he does not claim to be a minor at the stage of trial, the Supreme Court has said.

 A bench headed by Justice S.B. Sinha said age was a question of fact to be established by evidence and cross-examination, which could not be allowed at a later stage, reports our legal correspondent.

 The observation was made while rejecting appeals by two murder convicts who sought benefits under the juvenile justice act.

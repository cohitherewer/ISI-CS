The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Nation at a Glance

 Leash on bus music, car films 

 New Delhi (PTI): Watching a movie in 

 a car while on a long drive or listening to the latest chartbuster 

 on a Blueline bus in Delhi could result in owners facing 

 punitive action, traffic police have said.

 The police said 1,501 drivers of Blueline buses were prosecuted during the past year for playing music in violation of the Delhi motor vehicles rules.

 Around 830 drivers of Blueline buses and 37 private cars have been fined in the last three days.

 The declaration of the punitive action came following complaints that several car-owners had installed DVD screens on the front panels of their cars. 

 Terror stress in talks with UK

 New Delhi: India will look forward to 

 lessons on tackling terrorist strikes from Britain, which 

 was rocked by serial bombings in July last year.

 Terror tops the agenda of British foreign secretary Margaret Becketts weeklong visit to India starting on Wednesday. Officials said the London experience could be useful for Indian security agencies, which have to be prepared to prevent similar strikes. 

 They believe the serial blasts in Mumbai and London had many similarities. 

 Becketts trip is a follow-up to the India-UK summit in London last month. 

 The focus of the talks on terrorism will be strikes carried out in metropolitan cities, an official said. 

 Beckett will meet foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee and also call on Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. 

 Abortion rap

 Melbourne (PTI): A Sydney-based doctor 

 of Indian origin, accused of performing an illegal abortion, 

 has been put on a two-year good-behaviour bond.

 Suman Sood was found guilty of unlawfully giving abortion drugs to a woman in 2002. She was the first to be convicted for an illegal abortion in New South Wales in the last 25 years.

 Flag meeting

 Jammu (PTI): Indian and Pakistani troops 

 on Tuesday held a flag meeting over the repatriation of 

 four Pakistanis to Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir. The meeting 

 was held at Chakan-da-Bagh on the Line of Control in Poonch 

 district.

 Life for murder

 Ghaziabad (PTI): A sessions court sentenced 

 two persons to life on Tuesday for a murder committed 10 

 years ago. Pramod and Jabir had stabbed to death one M.P. 

 Singh. Two others were acquitted in the case.

 Around 30 lakh runners in 262 cities and towns of Maharashtra will 

 take part in a marathon on December 17 to salute the spirit 

 of the state. The marathon will start at 8.30 am.

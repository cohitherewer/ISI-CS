 Bangalore, April 16: With terrorists stepping up strikes in northern India, intelligence officials in the south, too, have stepped up vigilance.

 The arrest of 15 militants in Karnataka after the December 28 attack on the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) in Bangalore has exposed a wide Lashkar-e-Toiba network in the region, sources said.

 State intelligence officials were startled to find that the network was quietly spreading through several districts of Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra that once made up the old Nizam state of Hyderabad.

 Its difficult to predict where the next strike will be, but there is no doubt that the Lashkar is active in the old Nizam areas. All the southern police intelligence wings are sharing information regularly, an intelligence official said.

 The Lashkar wants action in Junagadh (Gujarat) and the Nizam areas of Hyderabad apart from Jammu and Kashmir. The group was earlier using Hyderabad as its headquarters in the south, but after the blasts at the police special task force office there, the militants fanned out to Zahirabad on the Andhra-Karnataka border near Bidar.

 Intelligence inputs suggest militants have been enrolling themselves for English-speaking courses and computer training in Bidar and Gulbarga.

 After the IISc attack, the Karnataka police woke up to find sleeper cells at places across the state, such as Chintamani, Mulbagal (both near Bangalore), Mangalore (on the coast), Bidar and Bagalkot (in northern Karnataka).

 Sleeper cells refer to militants who are used for specific tasks and exist for years without the police getting suspicious.

 Sources said much of the recruitment is done in Saudi Arabia and the Gulf, where many Indians travel to work or on pilgrimage. A few come into contact with recruiters.

 Saudi spiritual centres are teeming with Lashkar agents who indoctrinate them. The Indians are shown footage of the Gujarat riots, Babri Masjid demolition and killings in Jammu and Kashmir that are blamed on securitymen. They are then sent for training in Pakistan or Bangladesh on fake Saudi passports, a source said.

 Back in Saudi Arabia, they are assigned specific tasks. Once they return to the Nizam areas, they try to spread their ideas among the youth. Often, young men from the Nizam areas are directly sent to Bangladesh for training. Some of them are also involved in hawala rackets.

 Some of these operatives buy property in an area and try to acquire influence and authority ? for instance, through philanthropy, sources said. All the while they continue to scout for recruits, motivate them and raise and distribute funds for militancy.

 The investigation of the IISc attack has revealed that some of those who returned after training in Bangladesh wanted to establish a training centre near Bangalore. For now, I think we have thwarted their plans, an intelligence official said.

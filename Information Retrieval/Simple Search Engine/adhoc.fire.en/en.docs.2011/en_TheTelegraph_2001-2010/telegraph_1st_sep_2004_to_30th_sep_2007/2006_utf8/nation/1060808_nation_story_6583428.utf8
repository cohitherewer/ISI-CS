The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Leak to let-off, focus shifts

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 7: The privilege notice against the Prime Minister may have caused a stir but the focus in the next few days is not likely to be so much on the leak as the exoneration of the Congress by the Pathak report.

 For today, the leak dominated proceedings in both the Houses with the Opposition demanding an apology and Manmohan Singhs resignation. Manmohan was not present in either House.

 In the Rajya Sabha, members from the Samajwadi Party, Telugu Desam and the ADMK gave notices for breach of privilege. The issue led to repeated adjournments with MPs raising slogans against Manmohan and Congress chief Sonia Gandhi.

 In the upper House, Natwar Singh made several unsuccessful attempts to have his say amid the din caused by protesting MPs.

 The NDA took the leak seriously till afternoon. Both George Fernandes and BJPs Vijay Kumar Malhotra had given a privilege notice against Manmohan yesterday. After an NDA meeting in L.K. Advanis chamber this morning, another privilege notice was given in the Lok Sabha.

 However, events took a turn after the Pathak report was tabled. The BJP realised the report gave them more ammunition against the government than the leak.

 In any case, establishing breach of privilege against Manmohan would not be easy because there was no evidence. Besides, the Pathak panel was not established under the Commission of Inquiry Act. As such, the government was not bound to table it in Parliament.

 So, the BJP fielded Arun Jaitley to launch a scathing attack on the findings of the report. Jaitley never repeated the word scapegoat, used by Advani to describe Natwar in the oil-for-food scam.

 Jaitleys argument was simply that the government allowed Justice R.S. Pathak to investigate only one part of the scandal that related to Natwar and son Jagat. The second part that related to the Congress was covered up. 

 It is one half of an inquiry and one half of cover-up, he said.

 Jaitley departed from Advanis argument that took a softer approach towards Natwar. He said there were two individual non-contractual beneficiaries Natwar and the Congress.

 Our question is, why have both the beneficiaries not been treated at par? We hold no brief for Natwar Singh. But why have two standards for two beneficiaries?

 He claimed the Pathak panel suffered from deliberate procedural handicaps against probing the Congresss role in the scandal.

 There were basic flaws with the structure of the probe panel and the probe:

 a) No criminal case was registered to stop the investigating panel from obtaining evidence through coercion

 b) Though the government had assured that the Pathak panel would be given power to issue a letter rogatory and notices under Section 8B, none of these powers was given

 c) The government has procedurally erred in holding an in-camera trial in a case relating to corruption.

 Jaitley argued that without completing the money trail, exonerating the Congress was a hasty decision.

 Where was the problem in registering a case? he asked. Even if someone impersonated on behalf of the Congress, it still amounts to a case of cheating. Without following proper procedure and relying on evidence produced voluntarily by the government, it is hasty to exonerate the Congress.

 He said these were preliminary 

 comments. A detailed analysis of the report 

 would follow, he said, indicating a renewed focus 

 on the findings of the report in the days to come.

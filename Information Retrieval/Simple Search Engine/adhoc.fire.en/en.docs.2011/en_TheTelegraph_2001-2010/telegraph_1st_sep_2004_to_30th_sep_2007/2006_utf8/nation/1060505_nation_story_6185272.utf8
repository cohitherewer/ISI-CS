 Too smut for censor board sleuths

 Sharmila: Porn problem

 New Delhi, May 4: Despite hiring private detective agencies, the censor board finds it tough to crack down on cinemas that re-insert sleazy bits into films after they have been cut out by the censors.

 Central Board of Film Certification chairperson Sharmila Tagore says the law enforcement agencies need to act tougher against the racket. She told The Telegraph the board cant do much more than what it is doing right now.

 This includes paying private detective agencies to keep tabs on theatres that refuse to cut out the pornographic portions the board asks them to delete.

 Once the detectives find that a cinema is breaking the law, they can get the police to conduct a raid and seize the print.

 During 2005, a total of 83 instances of interpolations in films were detected, and the boards reports were sent to judicial magistrates for action against the distributors and cinema owners.

 But these detected cases represent a small portion of violations actually taking place, officials say.

 Exhibitors and distributors break the law by not implementing the cuts ordered by the board. Or they re-insert portions they might have left out from the version of the film handed in to the censor board while seeking a certificate.

 Sometimes, a completely unrelated porn clip is introduced in a movie that has got a censor board certificate.

 According to the censor board, cinemas are expected to display a list of cuts ordered in the film that they happen to be screening. If the cuts are still shown, they breach the Cinematograph Act, which covers the problem of interpolation.

 In some states, this can mean suspension of the theatres licence. But many exhibitors and distributors get away with the violations because they are not reported to the authorities.

 Tagore said the method of hiring detectives was not working too well. We have complaints that the detective agencies become part of the system, she said, meaning that they are bought over by the distributors and theatre owners.

 The censor boards regional offices in Delhi, Mumbai and Thiruvananthapuram have employed detective agencies. So has the Hyderabad office, though it is now looking for a replacement for the agency it had been relying on.

 Tagore said the law enforcement agencies had to take responsibility for implementing the Cinematograph Act.

 She said the civil society, too, needs to get involved. If a cinema in the neighbourhood has been showing sleaze, people should report that to the authorities.

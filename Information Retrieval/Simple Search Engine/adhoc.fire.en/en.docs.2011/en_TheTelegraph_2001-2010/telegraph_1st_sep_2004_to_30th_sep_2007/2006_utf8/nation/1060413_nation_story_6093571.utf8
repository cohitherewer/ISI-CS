The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Court to hear radio plea

 Calcutta, April 12: Calcutta High Court has admitted a petition moved by Radio Today Broadcasting Limited challenging the legality of some rules of the Indian Performing Rights Society (IPRS) relating to the radios right to air songs, says our legal reporter. 

 Admitting the petition for hearing on April 19, Justice K.J. Sengupta today restrained IPRS from initiating any criminal proceedings against Radio Today, which is set to launch services in the city.

 Radio Todays petition argued that IPRS has no legal authority to claim royalty for broadcasting songs by any performer from any FM radio station.

 Rockets for Maoists? Ambattur is clueless 

 - Unwitting cogs in wheel

 Chennai, Sept. 17: The small workshops at suburban Ambattur that made the rocket and launcher components for the Maoists may not have known what their end-products were meant for, workers and other unit owners say.

 The kingpin of the racket, Raghu alias Srinivasa Reddy, and his wife Sudharani are at large while the owners of the six units that built their arsenal are behind bars.

 We usually never know from where an order originates, for that is not our concern, said a worker at Arun Engineering Company, a small foundry that mostly takes up sub-contracts from the automobile industry.

 He said Raghu came to the shop about two years ago with a cone-like die and ordered some 600 pieces to be made from it. He said the cones were to go into a cotton spinning machine.

 Most of the six tainted units are lathe shops at the remoter corners of the Ambattur industrial estate that has some 1,500 small and medium units and over 10,000 tiny sector workshops.

 Raghu carefully chose small people, playing on their hunger for orders, a unit owner said.

 The spokesman for the Tamil Nadu Cottage and Tiny Industries Association, to which many of the units are affiliated, agreed. We arent sure whether these accused unit owners were really in the know. Raghu would get each component made at a different unit, telling it the articles were for making agriculture implements, such as pump-sets.

 Raghu is believed to have got most of the dies for the components made from Everest Engineering Company.

 Its owner, Sivaji, is a Telugu-speaking man from Hosur. He set up shop here just a few years ago, recalled a neighbour. Raghu regularly visited the unit but this was put down to both men being from Andhra.

 Everest passed on some of the orders for the weapon components to friendly units that took sub-contracts. The sub-contracting system works through a someone-knows-someone network, a worker said.

 I do machine work as a sub-contractor for a big automobile company near Chennai and do not take other jobs. But Sivajis case was different. He specialised in several things so its possible that he could be led up the garden path for a few extra rupees, said a unit owner.

 Everests signboard names a whole range of jobs, from jig boring, pressure dies, plastic dies to gravity dies.

 We are shocked and shamed. It has affected our entire trade and now we have to be extra careful while taking orders, said a lathe owner who works a milling machine.

 Itll be a Herculean task finding out about the background of the people who give out the sub-contracts, shuddered the Ambattur Industrial Estate Manufacturers Association spokesman. But we cant afford not to be cautious in the future.

 The police are investigating whether Raghu took up any contract from the defence ministrys Heavy Vehicles Factory at Avadi near Chennai. Many of the small units in Ambattur take up government contracts.

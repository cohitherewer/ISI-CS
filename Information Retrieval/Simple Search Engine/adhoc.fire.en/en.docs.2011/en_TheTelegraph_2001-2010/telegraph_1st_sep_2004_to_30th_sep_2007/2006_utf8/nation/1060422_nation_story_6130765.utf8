 India suspect in Nepal peoples eyes

 Kathmandu, April 21: Indias role in hammering out a compromise that saves the monarchy, and then quickly welcoming the kings offer even before the Nepalese political parties here had reacted to it, is already being criticised in Nepal.

 Hate messages are apparently already being sent to Indian diplomats on their phones. However, no one knows whether this might snowball into some kind of anti-India protest on the street.

 An activist associated with the Nepali Congress did not think so. While saying that he did not want to be hard on India, he did comment: The people will not like this as India will be seen as not sharing their aspirations.

 We are very friendly with the people of India. It is the government of India with which we have a love-hate relationship, he said.

 Many in the Nepalese capital believe that India may end up looking very foolish if the seven-party alliance rejects the kings offer tomorrow, a likely possibility.

 It is sad that the largest democracy in the world has raised its voice to save the monarchy. The United States was in favour of the king and now India has reduced itself to being the tail of the Americans, said a dejected senior bureaucrat in King Gyanendras government, who did not want to be identified.

 Indias current role is being compared to what it did in 1951 when the present monarchs grandfather, King Tribhuvan, was restored to the throne by New Delhi.

 Why are you repeating the same mistake? Dont you see that Gyanendra is seen as a hatyara raja (killer king)? How many more people need to be shot dead before India understands this? the bureaucrat asked.

 Protesters in Kathmandu, Chitwan, Pokhra and other parts of Nepal apparently are already shouting slogans that the kings offer was a deception and betrayal. People like G.P. Koirala will be lynched if they accept the offer, said an activist.

 India clearly does not think so. While not openly critical of New Delhi, many Nepalese activists are wondering why the political parties were not consulted before India welcomed the kings announcement.

 What was it that Karan Singh said to the king that he felt emboldened enough to justify his takeover on television. How come suddenly he had the courage to say Half the sovereignty will lie in me and the other half in you? India is giving more importance to the monarchy than to the political parties and the people of Nepal, said Sushil Pyakurel, a former human rights commissioner of the country.

 Nepali Congress leader Chakra Prasad Bastola said: I dont think that India understands the situation here.

 It is a cop-out by India which may cost it dear, said another politician who did not want to be identified. He wondered why India, which had played with a straight bat in Nepal for most of the time during the four-year-old crisis, had suddenly done something that may result in losing Nepal at least for a generation.

 Calcutta, June 23: The government today announced a Rs 50-crore special allocation for underdeveloped rural areas, many of which are now in the grip of Maoist extremists.

 The fund has been allocated to intensify development efforts centring on production, employment, education, training, public health and housing in these areas, finance minister Asim Dasgupta said. 

 In addition, Rs 5 crore has been specially earmarked for Paschimanchal (western zone), which comprises 74 blocks of Bankura, Purulia, West Midnapore, Burdwan and Birbhum districts. 

 Bankura, Purulia and West Midnapore are known Maoist strongholds, but the rebels showed their ability to strike outside the region with the murder of two CPM leaders in Nadia earlier this week. 

 The government had expressed concern about the Maoists growing influence in the poverty-stricken pockets of the state.

 Dasgupta has also allocated Rs 10 crore especially for the development of north Bengal, a region also reeling under poverty and grappling with rebel activities.

 The government has already identified more than 4,000 villages, mostly in the five south Bengal districts, as the most backward. 

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has admitted the lack of development in the region and also asked the administration to step up the efforts to reach out to the people.

 Despite funds allocations, delivery has often been a problem in the impoverished region.

 A separate department for Paschimanchal development has been created to expedite the implementation of poverty alleviation programmes. 

 Paschimanchal being a month-old department, it could not have a budget of its own. 

 Dasgupta has raised the total outlay for north Bengal, Paschimanchal and the Sunderbans from Rs 77 crore to Rs 104.5 crore. 

 The government will also take loans worth Rs 150 crore from the National Bank for Agricultural and Rural Development (Nabard) for the development of the three regions ? Paschimanchal, the Sunderbans and north Bengal. 

 The budget has also made provision of Rs 40 crore to be given as old-age assistance to tribal people.

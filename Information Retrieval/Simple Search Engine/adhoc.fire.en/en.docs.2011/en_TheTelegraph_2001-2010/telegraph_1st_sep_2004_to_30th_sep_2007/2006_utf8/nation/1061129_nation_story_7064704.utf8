 New Delhi, Nov. 28: A day before she is scheduled to appear in court in the Nitish Katara murder, Bharti Yadav stayed away from the flashbulbs, slipping out of her house through a side entrance and visiting the passport office in a burqa.

 Vikas Yadav, her brother and the chief accused in Nitishs murder, had no such inhibitions he slapped a journalist trying to take a snap at the Patiala House courts where he was asked to appear today.

 Bharti submitted her expired passport at the office of the passport commissioner near Patiala House around 11.30 am.

 Spotted by reporters with another woman, Bharti was seen rushing up the stairs of the passport office building and almost tripped over her burqa.

 Her lawyer S.C. Bhuttan confirmed Bharti had submitted her passport. But only in the evening did he admit that she had come in a burqa, having denied it for much of the day.

 She left the house from a side entrance to escape the media, he said. But he refused to divulge the identity of the person with her.

 Her brother Vikas took a wild swipe at a photographer who tried to click a picture as he was leaving the court around 4pm. Vikass lawyers hustled into a waiting Toyota Land Rover before matters turned uglier.

 The incident comes not long after friends and lawyers of Santosh Singh convicted for the rape and murder of law student Priyadarshini Mattoo attacked journalists at Delhi High Court.

 Mumbai, March 30: Rani Mukherjee was bowled over by the pure poetry in his clothes and the rest of the audience could not stop gushing about their international appeal.

 In a throwback to his winning performance at India Fashion Week in Delhi in 2004, Sabyasachi Mukherjees designs at the Lakme Fashion Week ? showcased at the NCPA in Mumbai this afternoon ? impressed buyers from home and away.

 Two years ago, his Frog Princess look had catapulted the young designer from Calcutta to the international stage. This time, The Snail ? with its clean simplicity marking a distinct departure from his signature style ? promises to be a giant leap forward.

 Its a beautiful collection, very well thought out and very well executed. He just knows the women he dresses, said Albert Morris of Londons fashion landmark Browns, where Sabyasachi already has a presence on the racks.

 Rani adorned the first row at the designers show this afternoon. Dressed in an off-white and black creation from The Snail collection, the actress later told Sabyasachi: Your clothes are pure poetry.

 Her Bollywood colleague Koena Mitra, too, kept the compliments flowing. I just loved the show. I felt it was a very quiet collection that had a very peaceful effect, said Koena, who is Sabyasachis childhood friend.

 For the designer, The Snail is a serious line, completely in sync with the international forecast of a clean and fresh mood in fashion, a move to get away from bohemia to a refined simplicity.

 The inspirations for the clothes were basic: school uniforms and maternity wear. In an era of mass production, the collection is all about slowing down, is how Sabyasachi described the collection.

 In the run-up to fashion week, Sabyasachi had, for The Telegraph, rated The Snail 8.5 against 4 for his Frog Princess. But the audience reaction to the collection ? it was the most-applauded so far ? scored a near 10.

 The response is much more than I had expected, smiled Sabyasachi.

 Zahira questions Bakery findings

 New Delhi (PTI): Zahira Sheikh, key witness in the Best Bakery case, has questioned the findings of the committee which indicted her as a self-condemned liar. 

 She alleged on Tuesday the inquiry proceeding was neither fair nor honest and was based on distortion of facts.

 Terming the findings as guess work, her counsel D.K. Garg told a bench of Justices Arijit Passayat and H.K. Sema that the findings as recorded are oscillitating and are not clear and specific. 

 Garg also raised suspicion on the method in which the questions were framed.

 In her objection, Zahira alleged the inquiry officer did not adhere to the January 10, 2005, order of the court on the terms and reference of the probe. It also gave the impression of acting as a puppet of activist Teesta Setalvad.

 Kashmir links restored

 Srinagar (PTI): Road and air links between 

 Kashmir and the rest of the country were restored on Tuesday, 

 a day after heavy snowfall played havoc.

 Three flights landed at Srinagar airport and a special Haj flight is scheduled to take off later. 

 About 225 stranded vehicles, mostly carrying goods, on the Jammu-Srinagar National Highway were allowed to cross the Jawahar tunnel after snow was cleared by the Border Roads Organisation, official sources said.

 However, the valley was plunged into complete darkness with the electricity supply system crumbling under the weight of heavy snowfall over the past 36 hours.

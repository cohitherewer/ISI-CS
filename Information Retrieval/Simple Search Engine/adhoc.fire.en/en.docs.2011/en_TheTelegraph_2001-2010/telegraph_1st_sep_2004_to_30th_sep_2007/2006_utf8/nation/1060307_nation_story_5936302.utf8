 New Delhi, March 6: A petition before the Supreme Court challenging the constitutional validity of doing away with the domicile clause in the Representation of the People Act has cast a shadow on the biennial Rajya Sabha elections, to be held on March 28. 

 The Supreme Court reserved its verdict after hearing the arguments on the petition, which was filed by former Rajya Sabha MP and journalist Kuldip Nayar, but the judgment will apply to the elections this month even if it is pronounced subsequently.

 If the court holds that only domiciles belonging to a state can contest the seats to the upper House from that particular state, it may put paid to the prospects of several heavyweights, across the political spectrum, who are aspiring to either get re-elected or make their debut in Parliament.

 Congress sources admitted that the impending verdict could upset its plan to get two senior ministers, Arjun Singh and H.R. Bhardwaj, re-elected. Both were returned from Madhya Pradesh the last time. 

 This time the Congress does not have the required number of MLAs to return even one member. It will need the support of the Samajwadi Party (with seven MLAs) and the four dissident BJP loyalists of Uma Bharti. Sources said there was no hope from the Samajwadi, whose relations with the Congress have hit rock-bottom. Uma, they added, was unpredictable.

 The fall-back plan is to have Arjun elected from Chhattisgarh and Bhardwaj from Haryana. But an unfavourable judgment could invite their disqualification. 

 In the BJP, Sushma Swaraj was elected from Uttaranchal last time. This time, the party does not have the support, so Sushma is looking at Rajasthan or Madhya Pradesh, neither of which is particularly keen on her. 

 The Congresss Rajiv Shukla is strapped for a safe state. Last time, he was elected from Uttar Pradesh as a Loktantrik Congress Party nominee with the help of the Samajwadi and Independents. The Congress, with its 16 MLAs in a 402-member Assembly, is on a sticky wicket.

 Shukla was banking on a bailout from Uttaranchal but N.D. Tiwari, who recently resigned as chief minister, spoilt his plans. Congress sources said Tiwari hoped Sonia would okay his resignation so he could return to Delhi politics through the upper House. 

 The CPM has plans to send Subhashini Ali from Bengal from where two of its members ? Nilotpal Basu and Dipankar Mukherjee ?will retire. She belongs to Uttar Pradesh and though the CPM was once stuck on the state only principle, this was given a go-by to get Brinda Karat and Sitaram Yechury elected from Bengal.

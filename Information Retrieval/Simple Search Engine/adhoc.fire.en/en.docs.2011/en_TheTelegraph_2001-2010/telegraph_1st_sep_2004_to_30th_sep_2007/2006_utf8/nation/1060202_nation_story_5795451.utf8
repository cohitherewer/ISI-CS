 Unions unsure of staying power 

 DHIRENDRA K. JHA

 New Delhi, Feb. 1: The airport employees agitation has sowed seeds of uncertainty in the minds of trade union veterans.

 Despite the airport employees resorting to a cease-work, and not a strike lest it attracts the tough law Esma, senior trade union leaders conceded that the protest movement was in a state of flux.

 The leaders are worried about the ability of the Airports Authority of India Employees Union (AAIEU) to sustain the agitation.

 The Left trade unions, especially Citu, are keeping their fingers crossed as the airport organisation is an independent union with a brief agitation track record.

 The Airports Authority of India Employees Joint Forum, which includes several officers associations besides the AAIEU, is a heterogeneous organisation that, the trade union leaders fear, might falter in the long run.

 We can join them in solidarity only if they continue on the path of agitation, Citu secretary Tapan Sen said.

 What the trade union leaders fear most is that the AAIEU is a new entrant to the mainstream movement against privatisation. 

 The Left trade unions are also not quite sure of the course of action the AAIEU will take if the government decides to tighten the screws.

 Only two years ago, the AAIEU developed close relations with the mainstream trade union movement against privatisation and participated for the first time in the September 29 general strike, Sen said.

 The uncertainty notwithstanding, AAIEU general secretary M.K. Ghosal said the airport employees would continue their agitation till the government rolls back the tender process.

 The central trade unions, including Citu, Aituc, HMS and BMS, have given a call for observing solidarity day throughout the country on Thursday. 

 The CPM, criticising the governments move to go ahead with the tender process, said the privatisation drive might not remain confined to the airports in Delhi and Mumbai alone.

 Next in line will be Calcutta and Chennai followed by other major airports. There is a concerted campaign to discredit the AAI (Airports Authority of India). Without allowing them to modernise the airports, they are being accused of incompetence in building and running world class airports, the CPM politburo said.

 The CPM also extended full support to the airport employees agitation, saying: The employees have gone on strike after the UPA governments decision to hand over these two airports to private companies in the name of modernisation.

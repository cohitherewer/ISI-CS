 Molest charge on singer

 Panchkula, Oct. 8 (PTI): Punjabi pop singer Gursewak Mann has been accused of forcibly holding a girl by her arm even as his friend clicked photographs with the crooners mobile at a local discotheque last night.

 Police have charged Gursewak, brother of singer Harbhajan Mann, and his unidentified friend with outraging the modesty of the girl, who hails from Himachal Pradesh. No arrests have been made so far, police said, but added that statements of all those present at the time of the incident would be recorded.

 In her complaint, the girl, who was there with a friend, alleged that Gursewak grabbed her arm outside the discotheques ladies toilet.

 The hotel opened its discotheque last week and the girl, who attends coaching classes in Chandigarh, was partying with her friend when the alleged incident took place.

 Heated arguments followed objections raised by the girl when Gursewaks friend started clicking away, she said in her complaint.

 Gursewak, on the other hand, told the police that the friend was taking his photos in the corridor of the discotheque, near the toilet. 

 The girl and her friend were sent for medical examination, the police said. 

 Gursewak has been asked to hand over his mobile to the police, who will check if photographs were taken or deleted later. It might even be sent for forensic examination, the police said.

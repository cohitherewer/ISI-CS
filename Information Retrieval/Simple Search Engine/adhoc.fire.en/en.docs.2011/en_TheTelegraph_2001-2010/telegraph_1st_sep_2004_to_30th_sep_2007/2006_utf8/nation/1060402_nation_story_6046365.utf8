 Puri temple 

 Bhubaneswar, April 1: About 100 servitors of the Jagannath Temple in Puri today shut the main door for about one-and-a-half hours in protest against the policies of the temple administration.

 Last month, the administration had announced that visitors could enter the temple through the eastern and southern gates and exit through the western and northern gates. The rule was to be enforced from today. 

 This was done for security reasons, but, apparently, the servitors were not happy with it, said temple administrator Hrusikesh Tripathy.

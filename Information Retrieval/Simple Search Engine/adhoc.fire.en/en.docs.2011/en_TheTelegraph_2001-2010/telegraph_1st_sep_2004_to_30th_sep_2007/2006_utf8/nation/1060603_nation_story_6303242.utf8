 Calcutta, June 2: The first time Bithi Datta had been to Kashmir was in 1975, on her honeymoon, making a dream start to her married life.

 She returned today from her second trip meant to recapture the magic of 31 years ago with husband Swaraj Dattas body.

 There was so much joy when we were leaving so many people had come to see us off with food and sweets. Now look at our state, she sobbed in a relatives arms at Calcutta airport where she arrived with the coffin.

 The couple had been travelling with their son Sujay, daughter-in-law Sumona, and Sumonas parents Biplab and Rubita Datta.

 All except Bithi and Rubita were injured in Wednesdays bus blasts. The family had to leave Sumona behind in a Srinagar hospital because her injuries will take longer to heal.

 Swarajs death has put paid to Bithis dreams of travelling the world with her husband after his retirement in 2007.

 Swaraj loved to travel with his wife. He would just pack a few bags and leave. Between December and May, the two of them had visited at least eight places, including the Sunderbans, said Jayshree Datta, Swarajs aunt.

 This time, he had decided to drag Sumonas parents along. He told me that once he retired, he would travel around India visiting the hills and the seas and exploring every corner of the country with Bithi.

 Swaraj loved to tell a good story. In January, during a trip to Sikkim, he and Bithi had experienced an earthquake. After returning home in Kasba, the elderly man was full of stories about how they had escaped the jaws of death.

 As they set out for Kashmir, the State Bank official had promised everyone he would return with a bagful of photographs and stories.

 A grenade attack by militants in a faraway land would have made one hell of a story if only Swaraj Datta had lived to tell it.

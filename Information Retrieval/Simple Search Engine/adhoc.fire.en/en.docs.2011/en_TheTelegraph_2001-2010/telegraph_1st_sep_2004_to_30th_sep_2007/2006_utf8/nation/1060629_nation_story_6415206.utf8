The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

NATION BRIEFS

 Calcutta, June 28: Theatre personality Tapas Sen died tonight after protracted illness. He was 81.

 Sen is survived by son Jay, who is also in theatre, daughter 

 and a grandson. 

 A pioneer in light arrangement for modern theatre, Sen was 

 associated with IPTA and worked with all eminent directors, 

 including Sambhu Mitra and Utpal Dutt. In Dutts Angaar, 

 he famously recreated the flooding of a coal mine.

 Calcutta: Murder accused MP Adhir Chowdhury 

 will be in Berlin on July 9 to watch the World Cup final. 

 Calcutta High Court has allowed the Congress leader, now 

 out on bail, to be part of the greatest show on earth. He 

 will be out of the country between July 5 and 10. 

 New Delhi: The army has said the security 

 apparatus in the Kashmir Valley will get a tone-up with 

 the focus on cities and towns. This was decided at a high-level 

 meeting hosted by army chief General J.J. Singh. But there 

 were different perceptions on whether violence was the result 

 of an increase or decrease in infiltration. Infiltration 

 is slightly higher this year, Union home secretary 

 V.K. Duggal said. Army sources, however, said infiltration 

 was slightly less than the corresponding period 

 last year. 

 Santiniketan: Rajat Kanta Ray has been appointed vice-chancellor of Visva Bharati University. President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam picked Rays from among three names submitted by the university. A modern history professor, Ray is now the head of the history department of Presidency College, Calcutta.

 New Delhi: Atal Bihari Vajpayee has said V.P. Singhs claims about him planning to quit the BJP in 1988 are laughable. In his book Manzil Se Zyada Safar, Singh had claimed that Vajpayee was unhappy with the BJP and wanted to quit the party. But Vajpayee said: His statement that I was unhappy with the BJP is not just factually incorrect, it is laughable.

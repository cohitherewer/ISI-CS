 New Delhi, Feb. 22: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today turned down the demand of the Left parties for US ambassador David C. Mulfords recall, but said he shared their sentiment. 

 Speaking in the Rajya Sabha, Singh described Mulfords letter to Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee on his criticism of President George W. Bush as unwarranted. 

 I share the sentiments (of Left party members). But my own feeling is that the action we have taken would suffice for the time being, he said, responding to CPM member Nilotpal Basu, who wanted the government to send a strong message, saying it was a matter of national self-respect. 

 During the three-day debate on the motion of thanks to the Presidents address, the Left had pushed for Mulfords recall. 

 I have no hesitation in saying that it (letter) was unwarranted and a departure from normal diplomatic norms, Singh said.

 The external affairs ministry has already told Mulford he should adhere to established protocol and channels of communication and to see that such incidents do not recur, the Prime Minister said. 

 When Singh rose to reply to the debate on the motion of thanks, it was clear he would be firm with his Left allies ass well as the Opposition BJP.

 He started by asserting that the Centre remained firmly committed to the common minimum programme, drawn up with the Left. Next, turning towards the Opposition, the Prime Minister described interventions by BJP leaders Rajnath Singh and Venkaiah Naidu as irresponsible. This sparked a brief ruckus before the entire Opposition walked out in the middle of the Prime Ministers reply.

 Singh then had the Left MPs listening attentively as he listed the achievements of the government in socio-economic development, particularly in poverty alleviation and empowering the marginalised.

 Referring to the Lefts concerns about foreign policy, the Prime Minister said his governments policies ? both foreign and domestic ? were formulated with national interest uppermost in mind.

 Singh wound up with lavish praise for cabinet colleague Lalu Prasad, crediting him with the remarkable performance of the railway. The railway minister has of late been sulking about being sidelined in the ruling alliance.

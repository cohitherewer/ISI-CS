 Kathmandu, June 6: Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koiralas four-day official visit to India, which began today, has raised several questions.

 Several people in the Nepalese capital feel that Koiralas visit to India has been fixed in a hurry, particularly as Delhi is yet to formally accept or declare its support to the proclamation of the restored house of representatives.

 As Som Niroula, an accountant and a human rights activist, said: Koiralaji is the head of an interim government created by a parliament which is to be dissolved and a new constitution is to be framed by a constituent assembly. At this stage, he felt, the Prime Minister should not be going out on state visits.

 Subodh Pyakurel, the chairperson of the Informal Sector Service Centre, said: The legal status of the restored parliament is unclear. It was revived by the king at the last moment and immediately accepted by the Seven-Party Alliance. The CPN (Maoist) has expressed its reservations about the alliance projecting this house of representatives as the regular parliament.

 Apart from these questions on the streets, there were also rumbles of dissatisfaction expressed by Koiralas coalition partners and the CPN (Maoist).

 Most of the coalition partners wanted to be assured that during his visit, Koirala would not agree to anything that would kick off controversy or compromise national interest. 

 During a lengthy all-party meeting at his house yesterday, Madhav Kumar Nepal, the general secretary of the CPN (UML), told reporters: The Prime Minister assured us that he would not sign any deal that is controversial or against national interest. 

 Narayan Man Bijukche, of the Nepal Workers and Peasants Party, and Amrik Sherchan, the president of the Janamorcha Nepal, were also present at the press briefing by Madhav Nepal.

 According to sources, Koirala is going to India to ask for budgetary support and development. 

 Finance minister Ram Sharan Mahat said Koiralas wish list consists of an aid package worth Rs 468.75 crore (around $104 million) for the next five years. 

 But will the visit be without controversy? During the days of democracy, every visit by Nepalese Prime Ministers to India was marked by the treaties they signed. 

 Most of the controversies raged around the Indo-Nepal treaties on hydroelectric projects. Whether it was the Karnali or the Mahakali project, the agreements were hotly debated on the floor of the house of representatives and the Prime Ministers ? from Koirala and Manmohan Adhikary to Sher Bahadur Deuba ? were all accused of having sold out Nepals waters and power-generating capacity for a pittance.

 It seems that apart from budgetary support, Koirala will try to secure Indian assistance in the hydropower, road and aviation sectors. According to reports here, during bilateral negotiations he will try to obtain special Indian assistance for at least one of the three mega hydropower projects ? the 600-mw Budigandaki, the 400-mw Arun III and the 300-mw Upper Karnali.

 The CPN (Maoist) has already made its position clear. Dina Nath Sharma, a member of the CPN (Maoist) peace talks team, has said: The current government does not have the mandate to take decisions on nationally important issues. 

 Speaking at a function at the Reporters Club yesterday, Sharma said: It should be a purely goodwill visit. Political problems should be resolved before economic package.

 If Madan Regmi, a well-known columnist, is any indicator of the popular apprehension, then perhaps the denizens should take note. 

 Regmi wrote in The Kathmandu Post (May 23): Let us assume for the time being that Delhi this time is not after exploiting Nepal as it did in 1950 and 1990 which changed Nepals political system but served Indias interest instead of Nepals. (The) Koshi, Gandaki, Mahakali river accords are examples.

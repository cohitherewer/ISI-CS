 New Delhi, Nov. 10: The Centre plans to go back to the Supreme Court for a halt to the sealing drive against illegal commercial establishments in residential areas.

 A group of ministers headed by home minister Shivraj Patil met today to decide on the next course of action but could come up with no ideas other than the obvious.

 We will approach the Supreme Court again asking for respite for traders, urban development minister S. Jaipal Reddy said. He didnt clarify if the sealing drive would be put on hold tomorrow.

 Earlier in the evening, sources close to Delhi chief minister Sheila Dikshit the only one outside the Union cabinet at the meeting had hinted at the possibility of asking the Municipal Corporation of Delhi not to seal shops on Saturday.

 The MCD has no plans to seal on Sunday a holiday for its staff so the traders may get a two-day breather. 

 The government is likely to call a meeting of political parties at the weekend before approaching the apex court again.

 A 24-hour traders bandh passed peacefully today. Although most shops and markets stayed closed, schools were open.

 Adding to the Centres headache, a group of students from Don Bosco Public School and Bal Bharti School have petitioned Delhi High Court saying the uncertainty over classes being held was affecting their studies. 

 We do not know when our school will be open and when it will be closed. We have no idea if the winter vacation will be shortened, or when our pre-board examinations will be held, said Jagbir Singh, a class X student of Don Bosco.

 Sealing continued today in Greater Kailash, South Extension and parts of Defence Colony in south Delhi.

 The BJP upped the ante against the government, accusing it of not taking the livelihood of traders seriously enough. It said a change in the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act was all that was needed to bring relief to traders.

 A simple change in Section 345 A is what is needed, BJP general secretary Arun Jaitley said. The section defines the nature of establishments that can be declared illegal and sealed.

 Jaitley, Delhi BJP chief Harsh Vardhan and leader of the state Opposition Jagdish Mukhi have written to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh asking for the change in the act.

 The office of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India, sealed on Wednesday, was yesterday de-sealed for 15 days to allow officials to collect their papers and shift.

 A 42-year-old man who tried to kill himself after his South Extension shop was sealed is out of danger, officials at Safdarjung Hospital said. 

 He is still being monitored, though, a doctor, Avdesh Khanna, added.

 New Delhi, Oct. 11: George Fernandess attempts to drag the Presidents name into the Barak deal found no takers in the political establishment.

 The BJP was silent, the Congress was critical and Fernandess own party, the Janata Dal (United), refused to comment on his demand to charge A.P.J. Abdul Kalam.

 Fernandess case was that he had consulted Kalam then scientific adviser to the defence minister before signing the Barak deal and he had reportedly said the missile system was good.

 Dal(U) spokesperson Shambu Shrivastava said: We cant comment on the President because we dont have the details of what Fernandes said. Even off the record, the otherwise voluble socialists were tongue-tied.

 But sources wondered why Fernandes, who was part of the group that originally proposed Kalams candidacy for presidentship along with Mulayam Singh Yadav, dragged him into the scandal. 

 More so, because he is still the NDA convener and the BJP-led coalition considers Kalam a valuable ally in its battle against the UPA. He hears us out whenever we ask for time. On crucial political issues like the office-of-profit bill, the stand he took helped our campaign, sources said.

 Mulayam, who has turned out to be Fernandess lone saviour after he was sidelined in his own party, has not said a word on the issue.

 The BJP shied away from commenting on Fernandess remarks. Its spokesperson, Prakash Javadekar, spoke on every aspect of the Barak episode except this one. The Congress is known for its vindictive politics. They are hell-bent upon pinning down Fernandes, who has been an effective crusader against the corrupt Congress regime for the last four decades, said Javadekar.

 But BJP sources said despite their roller-coaster relationship with the late K.R. Narayanan, who was President for some part of the NDA regime, it never stooped to making charges against him.

 Congress spokesperson Jayanthi Natarajan said: We strongly condemn this attitude and the words used by Fernandes. Such a mindset and such remarks that had no hesitation in hitting out at the high office of the President should not be dignified further with comments.

 Child death rap on doctors

 New Delhi, April 11 (PTI): A consumer court has asked two doctors of a plastic surgery clinic here to pay Rs 2 lakh as compensation to a woman whose two-and-a-half-year-old son never regained consciousness after being administered anaesthesia and died within three days.

 The hospital where the child was taken as well ... Dr B. Kaur, who administered the anaesthesia, are guilty of medical negligence and are liable to compensate the unlucky parents, said the Delhi State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission.

 Terming it the most unfortunate case of medical negligence, the court held two doctors, Suresh Gupta and Kaur, of the Delhi Plastic Surgery Clinic, jointly guilty as well as severally, liable to pay.

 The complaint said Ankur was given three stitches at a hospital after suffering a forehead injury in 1991. Apprehending a scar on the face, his mother Madhu Sudan, who was the complainant, took him to the clinic where Dr Gupta advised micro-stitches to make the marks invisible.

 Ankur was administered an anaesthetic injection containing ketamine during treatment. His parents panicked when he did not regain consciousness after several hours and took him to Sir Ganga Ram Hospital where he died.

 The clinic said the anaesthesia is commonly given to children.

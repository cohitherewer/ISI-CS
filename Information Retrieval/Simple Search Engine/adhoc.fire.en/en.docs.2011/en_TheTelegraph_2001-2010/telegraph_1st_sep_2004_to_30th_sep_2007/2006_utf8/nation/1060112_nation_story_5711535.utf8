 Demolition boot on Delhi VIP foot

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 11: The demolition demon has suddenly changed course to chase its creator, the Sheila Dikshit government in Delhi.

 Delhi High Court has directed the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD), which spearheaded the demolition drive against illegal constructions in the capital, to file an action taken report by January 31 on illegal properties allegedly owned by prominent local politicians.

 The order poses a problem for the administration: the list of the alleged violators carries names such as Delhi Speaker Chaudhary Prem Singh, Delhi Congress chief Ram Babu Sharma, Delhi finance minister Ashok Kumar Walia, Delhi Jal Board vice-chairman Anjali Rai and prominent legislators Mukesh Sharma, Jai Bhagwan Aggarwal and Prahlad Singh Sawhney.

 The court had sought information after taking suo motu cognisance of reports that influential persons were being spared in the ongoing demolition drive in the capital.

 Public perception is that it is only the lower strata of society which encounters the brunt of law. This perception must be rectified and this can only be achieved when the most influential meets with the rigours of law along with ordinary citizens.

 Instead of voluntarily agreeing to become conforming users or to rectify or modify or remove their illegal constructions, the stand of the prominent and influential persons is that an ordinance will be passed to regularise unauthorised construction. If this is so, ordinary citizens should be treated in a like manner, Justice Vikramjit Sen had observed.

 The court order prompted chief minister Dikshit to hold a series of meetings, including one with urban development minister S. Jaipal Reddy. 

 The MCD, sources said, has little option but to issue notices to the politicians. The sources said the Delhi government has asked the Union home ministry to provide central forces to prevent possible disturbances if the civic officials are given the green signal to move against the politicians.

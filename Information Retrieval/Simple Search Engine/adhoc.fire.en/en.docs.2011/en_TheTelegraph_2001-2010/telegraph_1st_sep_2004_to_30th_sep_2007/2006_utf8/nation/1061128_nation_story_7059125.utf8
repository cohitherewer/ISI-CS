 Pak duo in Malegaon plot

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Nov. 27: Maharashtra police today claimed to have solved the Malegaon blasts case and revealed, for the first time, the involvement of two Pakistani nationals in the conspiracy.

 Director-general of police P.S. Pasricha told a news conference that the plot to trigger a series of explosions in the communally-sensitive powerloom town on September 8 was hatched on May 8, two months before the July 11 train bombings in Mumbai.

 May 8 was also the date prime accused Noor-ul Hooda got married in Malegaon. They planned on that day that they needed to commit some terror act to disrupt communal harmony between Hindus and Muslims, Pasricha said, adding that all eight arrested in the case so far were active members of the outlawed Students Islamic Movement of India.

 Four bombs, planted on bicycles, had exploded in Malegaon, killing 37 and injuring over 200 people.

 The officer said a man identified as Muzzamil had crossed over from Pakistan and helped the group prepare the bombs. Muzzamil is absconding and so is the other Pakistani national, who is yet to be identified.

 However, Pasricha was tight-lipped on the involvement of the Pakistan government or the ISI. Investigations are not yet over, we are still gathering more information. At this stage, there is no evidence to suggest that Pakistan is involved in the blasts. If a few Pakistani nationals are involved, it does not mean that the Pakistani government or the ISI is involved.

 Mumbai police had accused the ISI of masterminding the July 11 explosions. Islamabad denied the charge. 

 Pasricha said all the arrested have confessed to participating in the conspiracy and added that two of them were trained in Pakistan.

 The officer said an independent witness his identity is being kept under wraps who was present when the bombs were assembled had also recorded his confession. We have scientific evidence like lie-detector tests, brain mapping and forensic evidence to back up the case, he said.

 Sati mystery in MP

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Sagar (Madhya Pradesh), Aug. 22: The mysterious death of a 45-year-old woman on her husbands funeral pyre has sparked claims that she committed sati even as the state government insisted it was nothing more than a suicide.

 Remains of Janakranis body were found by her son Pappu in Tulsipur, 250 km from Bhopal, just after villagers returned from the funeral of her husband Prem Narayan Gond, a 58-year-old who had been paralysed for the last five years. 

 Local BJP MLA Ratan Singh, the brother-in-law of Uma Bhartis brother Swami Lodhi, said he had heard from reliable sources that the mother of three committed sati. 

 Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan ruled out the possibility of sati, saying the Gond tribe Janakrani belonged to had no tradition of following the banned practice. He pointed out there were no public rituals, nor was the symbolic act of putting husband and wife together on the pyre followed. 

 Chauhan has, however, ordered an inquiry. 

 There were whispers in Tulsipur that Janakrani did perform the divine act of sati, but no villager came forward with a formal acknowledgement for fear of punishment for glorifying the custom.

 According to Pappu, only the men cremated his father in keeping with the tribal tradition and went for the post-funeral bath. 

 While they were away, Janakrani left the house on the pretext of answering natures call. When Pappu went to the cremation site, he saw remains of his mother smouldering. The toilet pitcher she was carrying lay next to the pyre. 

 Sagar collector S.S. Shukla said there was no evidence to suggest that she committed sati. He paraded Tulsipur sarpanch Bhagwan Singh to prove his claim. Preliminary probe suggests that it was a case of suicide. She was alone when she jumped into the pyre, Shukla said. 

 Superintendent of police Mohd Sayeed Afsar also said no case of sati had been registered so far.

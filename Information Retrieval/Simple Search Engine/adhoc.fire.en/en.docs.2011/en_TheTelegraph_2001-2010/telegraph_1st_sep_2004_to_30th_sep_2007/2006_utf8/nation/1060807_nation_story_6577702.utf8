 Shifts to clear court pile-up 

 SUMAN K SHRIVASTAVA

 Ranchi, Aug. 6: Judges could soon be working in shifts to help clear the huge backlog of around 3 crore cases pending in courts across the country.

 Taking a cue from the corporate world, the Supreme Court is said to have mooted a proposal to the Union law ministry and high courts to put in place a system under which judicial officers manning the subordinate courts would work in two shifts.

 The high-ups in the higher judiciary want the new proposal to be effective from November 26 (celebrated as Law Day) across the country, said a top source in Jharkhand High Court (in picture).

 The proposal follows a suggestion from Supreme Court Chief Justice Y.K. Sabharwal last month that a double shift system be introduced on an experimental basis to ease the pressure. 

 Chief Justice Sabharwal had proposed that as a first step, pilot courts could be set up in every district, preferably the one having the maximum number of pending cases, which would work in double shifts. 

 The proposal of the Supreme Court is in line with the suggestion. In the beginning, sources said, one magisterial court should function in two shifts in every district. 

 There is a backlog of around 1.8 crore in subordinate courts.

 The reason behind beginning the shifts for judges presiding over the subordinate courts is that no extra infrastructure, like courtrooms or ministerial staff, has to be created. 

 All that the state government has to do is to pay the salary of judicial officers who could either be fresh recruits or retired personnel.

 The state law department has received a proposal from the registrar-general of Jharkhand High Court to set rolling the process for appointment of magistrates. 

 Jharkhand does not have adequate number of retired judicial officers to work in shifts.

 The Centre and the state government are yet to explain how they plan to meet the expenditure. The tab for running the fast-track courts, created during the previous NDA regime at the Centre, was picked up by New Delhi.

 A senior judge, requesting anonymity, told The Telegraph that the proposal is practical. Even under British rule, he pointed out, big landlords were appointed in districts as honorary magistrates.

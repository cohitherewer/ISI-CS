The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 AIIMS panel split on chief

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Venugopal

 New Delhi, Dec. 11: If it involves AIIMS, a split down the middle cant be too far away.

 After students and faculty of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, its now the turn of a committee to deliver a divided mandate on director P. Venugopal.

 The panel was set up on the instruction of the Prime Ministers Office to study the autonomy and functioning of AIIMS, which was caught in a storm during the divisive quota controversy. 

 Two of the four members of the committee have questioned Venugopals credentials as an administrator. 

 The observations by P.K. Hota, the former health secretary, and R.K. Srivastava, the current director-general of health services, were made in dissenting notes submitted along with the report to the Prime Minister on October 11. The report has not been made public.

 The overall recommendations in the report, however, have focused on increasing the autonomy of AIIMS and making it one of the top 100 medical schools in the world, M.S. Valiathan, who chaired the committee, told The Telegraph. The fourth member of the committee was M.K. Bhan, the biotechnology secretary.

 A demand frequently voiced by Venugopal in the past few months, autonomy to AIIMS had become synonymous with the directors war cry in his tussle with health minister Anbumani Ramadoss.

 Hota and Srivastava have echoed the opinion of Ramadoss, who had recently called Venugopal a great doctor but a poor administrator.

 There is no doubt AIIMS gets massive funding and, therefore, as a former health bureaucrat, in my opinion, it also needs much closer observation than other medical institutes under the health ministry, Hota said over the phone today. Financial records were rarely prepared on time, Hota said, claiming that mismanagement had become something of a norm.

 Hota asked for the three-month tenure of the committee to be extended, but Valiathan turned it down on the ground that all terms of reference were covered.

 Valiathan, the former director of an institute of medical sciences and research in Kerala, said the dissenting notes were not allowed to affect the final recommendations. We did not get into the recent controversy... that was not in our terms of reference.

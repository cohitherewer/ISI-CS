Mumbai, July 13: When the 

 news of the blasts broke, the families of Mussharat Feroz 

 and Anjani Kumar didnt even wonder. They knew for 

 certain their near ones would have been on the targeted 

 trains.

 The drivers and guards were in the thick of the 7/11 tragedy, when seven blasts in 11 minutes killed at least 200 commuters, but they were back in their train cabins the next day. And again today. And they would return tomorrow, and the day after.

 To tell you the truth, I was scared to come back. Once I stepped on the train again, the images of the dead and injured flashed through my mind, said Feroz, who was driving the 619 down Borivli slow train when it blew up at Jogeshwari.

 After 13 to 15 hours at the station on Tuesday through Wednesday morning, helping with the rescue work and then submitting their reports, Feroz and his colleagues had just a few hours rest at home before they were summoned back to Churchgate station.

 My family is very worried; they asked me to take leave for a few days, he said. But we had to come back?. Life goes on.

 The men in charge of Mumbais local trains hadnt even had time to inform their families on Black Tuesday.

 I was frightened, but was only worried for the passengers. I saw bodies of 15- and 16-year-olds and thought of my brothers who travelled by train every day. It could have been one of them. But I had to be strong; I had to work, said guard Girish Jadav whose train was ripped apart in Bandra.

 It was much later, when I was done with helping the passengers, that I realised I hadnt informed my family. At that point of time, you dont think, you just act.

 He admitted his family was worried and so was he. My mother went to the temple yesterday. But what has to happen will happen, he sighed.

 None of the guards or drivers was among the casualties, but Western Railway lost 15 employees who were travelling on the trains. Driver Anjani Kumar doesnt even want to think about it.

 I have finished my duty today. I want to go home; I am very tired, he said.

 His most vivid memory is of his blood-spattered shirt. I was soaked in blood and the stench was unbearable. It had started raining. The gruesome scene and the smell made me nauseous.

 K.N. Shelke, guard of the train that took the first blast, never let horror or emotion get the better of him. His first thought was about preparing a list of the injured lying around the tracks.

 At first, no one wanted to help, but later they came forward and helped me draw up the list. I ran to the control tower. When I got back, most of the bodies had been moved. I reached home after more than 16 hours.

 I still shudder when I think of what I saw on Tuesday. But again, being on the train comes as easily to me as eating. Its part of my life, said Shelke, who has been with the railways for 27 years.

 Ravindra Dharvi, .P. Gupta, Girish Chaurasia, S.C. Gautam, Basant Majhi ? they all did their bit on Tuesday. They have one request for the passengers: Be a bit more alert.

 Its physically impossible for us to check every part of the train and keep an eye on all thats going on. Trains stop at stations for one to two minutes, and anything can happen then, Gupta said.

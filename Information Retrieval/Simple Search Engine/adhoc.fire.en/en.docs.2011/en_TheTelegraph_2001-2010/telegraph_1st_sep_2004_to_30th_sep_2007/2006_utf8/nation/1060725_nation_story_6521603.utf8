 Indian faces slavery charge 

 Sydney (PTI): The owner of a chain of 

 Indian restaurants near Sydney has become the first person 

 in Australia to be charged under a new trafficking law for 

 enslaving an Indian youth and forcing him to work without 

 pay for seven days a week.

 Yogalingam Rasalingam was arrested on Sunday night for allegedly keeping Anbalagan Rajendran as a slave and subjecting him to gross human rights violation, including denying him pain-killers when he complained of pain from long and excruciating hours of standing in the kitchen.

 Police raided Rasalingams Taste of India restaurant on July 13, where they found the 23-year-old, whom he had brought to Australia on the promise of a better life. 

 But when Rajendran arrived in Sydney on June 1, Rasalingam allegedly took away his passport and made him live in a tin shed.

 Bomb panic

 created a flutter in Katra when he claimed that the refrigerator 

 condenser he was carrying was a bomb. People mistook Kalu

 Devi pilgrims and called police. Kalu was disarmed 

 and later released.

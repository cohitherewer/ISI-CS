 Scientist visa in US soup

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 17: The US today said it has not taken a final decision on the visa applications of two Indian scientists.

 However, one of them ? former Indian Institute of Science head Goverdhan Mehta ? maintained that he was denied permission to travel and vowed not to reapply.

 The US embassy, in a statement released here, regretted the inconvenience caused to Mehta, an expert in organic chemistry, and nuclear scientist Placid Rodriguez.

 The two had applied separately for visas at the US consulate in Chennai. While Mehta was invited for a lecture at the American Chemical Society, Rodriguez was to attend a symposium at the annual meeting of the Metals, Minerals and Materials Society in March.

 The US embassy came out with the statement after reports about the visa denial sparked outrage in the Indian scientific establishment. 

 Although it is generally the US policy not to comment on individual cases, the US embassy feels compelled to correct the inaccuracies regarding Professor Mehtas application for a visa, said the statement.

 No final decision has been taken on Professor Mehtas application pending receipt of additional information necessary to process his visa request, it said.

 An embassy official said the US has respect for the scientists of India and other countries and no one was trying to discourage visits by members of the Indian academic and scientific community.

 Mehta, however, is not impressed. I was clearly told that visa has not been granted, he said from Bangalore, where the IISc is located.

 The scientist was furious at the behaviour of consulate officials. He felt humiliated when the interviewer asked him to convince him that his work was not related to chemical warfare. 

 I could not answer the absurd question. Then I was told that I have not been honest. How can anyone say this to a scientist? It was not a personal humiliation, he said. 

 Mehta has decided not to reapply even as an official from the US consulate today requested him to do so.

 The US embassy officials said Rodriguezs visa had been delayed for different reasons. They regretted that the professor was upset.

 The mission was in touch with Rodriguez and was encouraging him to continue with the visa application, the officials said. Mehta was welcome to continue his application whenever he chose to, they added.

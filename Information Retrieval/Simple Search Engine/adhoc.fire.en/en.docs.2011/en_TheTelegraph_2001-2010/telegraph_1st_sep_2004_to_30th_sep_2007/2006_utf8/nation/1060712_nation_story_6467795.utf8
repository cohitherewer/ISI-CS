 Dum Dum Park wakes up to void 

 - Four dead, crisis man in battle for life

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Kaberi Ghosh Roy

 Calcutta, July 11: The Ghosh Roys of Dum Dum Park would always look to Ashis ? the third of the four brothers and director of the Geological Survey of India ? to bail the family out of any crisis.

 Now they have to grapple with four deaths, including that of Ashis s wife Kaberi, and the knowledge that he is battling injuries in Srinagars SMHS Hospital.

 It is a void we cant put in words. We cant believe Kaberi is no more. She was so full of life that both at home and in the para, no one can believe she is dead, said Ashiss elder brother Ashok. The eldest brother, Dipak, is away in New Delhi.

 I cant exactly tell you how it feels to learn from television news that he (Ashis) is struggling at SMHS Hospital in Srinagar. We always believed he was the most well-informed among us and knew how to come out of any crisis. Maybe this time, things were just not under his control.

 On July 7, when Ashis and Kaberi ? both Presidents award winners ? left for Srinagar, there was much excitement in the family. They were going to Amarnath with Kaberis mother Prati-ma Bhattacharya, brother Sandip, his wife Chhaya and her mother Kamala Bhattacharya.

Since not many from our family would travel in such a big group we all felt that this would be a great experience, particularly since they had plans of visiting Vaishno Devi and even Golden Temple on their way back. Yesterday, they called us to inform that they would be returning on July 22, said Satyen Bose, Ashis uncle.

 Ashis, who is respected not only in his family and his para but also among colleagues, won the Presidents medal last year for his work as disaster management expert. He came back home to Kaberi with a broad smile.

 The year before, Kaberi had won an award from the President for her work with a section of local women whom she helped to form a self-sufficient group, earning money through door-to- door service with cooked food. So when Ashis returned, he had a big smile and told his wife that even he could win an award, said Susrut Dhar, a local youth who was close to Kaberi.

 The Ghosh Roys were not the only family grieving in Dum Dum Park. 

 Shubranjit Das Majumdar has lost his mother, Purabi, and his aunt, Bandana Haldar. 

 Every year, my father (Subir) would take the initiative to organise trips. This year, a group of 22, includ- ing me, was supposed to head for Kashmir. This afternoon, my father called me up and narrated how everything was lost, Shubranjit said.

 His cousin Shubhabrata Haldar refuses to believe his mother is no more. 

 I am still waiting for a final confirmation, said the sound engineer as he clutched a CD with pictures of Bandana in different moods ? the last that he had taken.

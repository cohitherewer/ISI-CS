 Oil scam probe gets more time

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 27: The government has granted a three-month extension to the Justice R.S. Pathak panel probing Indian involvement in the Iraq oil-for-food scam.

 The United Nations-appointed Paul Volcker committee, which exposed the scam, had named former external affairs minister K. Natwar Singh and the Congress as beneficiaries.

 The term of the Pathak panel was to end on May 10, but he had sought an extension of six months. The probe, he argued, would take time as it would have to be conducted in the US, Germany, Iraq and Jordan.

 The panel, which is to submit its report in Parliament, has the authority of a civil court and can summon witnesses and documents, and record evidence.

 It is to investigate if any Indian entity or individual received money or any other consideration from, or paid any money or other consideration to, any government, agency, company, firm or individual in connection with the UN oil-for-food programme.

 As of now, the Pathak panel has issued two notices each to Natwar and his son Jagat.

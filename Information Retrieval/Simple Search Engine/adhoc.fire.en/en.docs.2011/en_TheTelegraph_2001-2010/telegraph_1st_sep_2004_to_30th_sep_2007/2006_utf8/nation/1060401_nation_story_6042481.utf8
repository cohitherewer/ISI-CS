 Rumblings get louder over H1-B cap hike

 S. MITRA KALITA

 Washington, March 31: Somewhere in the debate over immigration and the future of illegal workers, another, less publicised fight is being waged over those who toil in air-conditioned offices, earn up to six-figure salaries and spend their days programming and punching code.

 They are foreign workers who arrive on H-1B visas, mostly young men from India and China tapped for skilled jobs such as software engineers and systems analysts. 

 Unlike seasonal guest workers who stay for about 10 months, H-1B workers stay as long as six years. By then, they must obtain a green card or go back home.

 Yesterday, the House Judiciary Committee heard testimony for and against expanding the H-1B programme. 

 This week, the Senate Judiciary Committee approved legislation that would increase the H-1B cap to 115,000 from 65,000 and allow some foreign students to bypass the programme altogether and immediately get sponsored for green cards, which allow immigrants to be permanent residents, free to live and work in the US.

 But underlying the arguments is a belief, even among the workers themselves, that the current H-1B programme is severely flawed.

 Opponents say the highly skilled foreign workers compete with and depress the wages of native-born Americans.

 Supporters say foreign workers stimulate the economy, create more opportunities for their US counterparts and prevent jobs from being outsourced overseas. The problem, they say, is the cumbersome process: Immigrants often spend six years as guest workers and then wait for green card sponsorship and approval.

 At the House committee hearing yesterday, Stuart Anderson, executive director of the National Foundation for American Policy, a non-profit research group, spoke in favour of raising the cap. Still, he said in an interview, the H-1B visa is far from ideal. What you want to have is a system where people can get hired directly on green cards in 30 to 60 days, he said.

 Economists seem divided on whether highly skilled immigrants depress wages for US workers. In 2003, a study for the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta found no effect on salaries, with an average income for both H-1B and American computer programmers at $55,000.

 Still, the study by Madeline Zavodny, now an economics professor at Agnes Scott College in Decatur, Georgia, concluded that unemployment was higher as a result of these H-1B workers.

 In a working paper released this week, Harvard University economist George J. Borjas studied the wages of foreigners and native-born Americans with doctorates, concluding that the foreigners lowered the wages of competing workers by 3 to 4 per cent. He said he suspected that his conclusion also measured the effects of H-1B visas.

 If there is a demand for engineers and no foreigners to take those jobs, salaries would shoot through the roof and make that very attractive for Americans, Borjas said.

 Those who recruit and hire retort that a global economy mandates finding the best employees in the world, not just the US. And because green card caps are allocated equally among countries (India and China are backlogged, for example), the H-1B becomes the easiest way to hire foreigners.

 No breather for cola twins

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Thiruvananthapuram, Aug. 25: Kerala High Court today declined to stay the ban on production and sale of Coke and Pepsi in the state.

 The division bench of Chief Justice V.K. Bali and Justice M. Ramachandran posted the case for final hearing on September 11, observing that no action was possible until the case was heard in detail.

 The bench said no further adjournments would be given and directed parties to complete their arguments before September 11. The Palakkad-based Peoples Forum for Natural Justice was allowed to implead in the case.

 Hindustan Coca-Cola Beverages Ltd and PepsiCo India Holdings Private Ltd had appealed for a stay on the ban, contending that it was legally flawed because the companies were not heard out and there was no independent verification of the products.

 The drinks had been banned earlier this month after the New Delhi-based NGO Centre for Science and Environment reported harmful levels of pesticide in 11 carbonated soft drink brands owned by the two companies.

 Opposing the stay, the government counsel submitted a report of chief government analyst Najma Begum confirming harmful levels of the pesticide chlorpyrifos in samples collected from Thiruvananthapuram.

 The two companies pointed to a government-appointed expert panels report this week that said the CSE had failed to prove its claims. The NGO has rejected the findings and said the health ministry was pandering to big multinationals at the cost of public health.

 Our soft drinks have been regularly tested and evaluated by the world-renowned UK government laboratory the Central Science Laboratories, a statement by Hindustan Coca-Cola Beverages said.

 We are completely confident about the safety of our soft drinks in India because they are produced to the same level of purity, regarding pesticides, as the EU criteria for bottled water globally accepted as one of the most stringent in the world, it added.

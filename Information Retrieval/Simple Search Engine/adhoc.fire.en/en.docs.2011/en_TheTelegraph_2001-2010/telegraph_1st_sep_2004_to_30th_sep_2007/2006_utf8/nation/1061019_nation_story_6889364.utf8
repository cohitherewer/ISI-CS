The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Lonely girl, with TV for company

 - Reports 

 of troubled childhood 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Behrampore, Oct. 18: Shreyashi, the 18-year-old daughter of Congress MP Adhir Chowdhury who tried to commit suicide today, appeared to have spent a troubled and lonely childhood, accounts of people who know her suggest.

 Bijoy Das, who manages the Chowdhury house in Behrampore, about 200 km from Calcutta, spent an hour with Shreyashi last morning in her Gol Park flat. 

 She told me she was not coming home to Behrampore during Kali Puja. She had not come to Behrampore during Durga Puja either. I felt she was very upset about something, said Bijoy, 35, who has been working for Adhir (in picture) for 15 years.

 On many occasions, I fed her in my arms. She is one of the most unfortunate girls I have seen. She used to be so lonely, he sobbed.

 Narayan Mahato, who too works in the house, echoed Bijoy. 

 Several others spoke on condition of anonymity. Her father is a busy politician and her mother was busy with her dance group and politics. Often, she would return from school and spend hours alone watching TV or staring out of the window. Her parents had few friends in the para, an acquaintance said.

 Across the street from the Chowdhury home in Behrampore, Alokesh Majumdar was fighting back tears. Please dont disturb us, said the 70-year-old grandfather who was the one person Shreyashi loved to talk to.

 It was not just the busy lives her parents led that got to the teenager, acquaintances said. Shreyashi was shocked and found it difficult to cope when her parents were accused of murder in July last year. 

 I still remember the day four months ago when Shreyashis mother Arpita appeared before the district judges court. Shreyashi was with her and she looked uncomfortable. We realised she found it difficult to face the world with both parents accused of murder, said a resident of Behrampore and an acquaintance of Adhir.

 Adhir and Arpita were charged with the murder of a father and son in Behrampore in July 2005. While Arpita obtained anticipatory bail, her husband was arrested in Delhi before being freed on bail.

 When The Telegraph spoke to Shreyashi last November, she insisted they were innocent. Deep inside, I know my parents are in no way connected with such a heinous act. They have been framed. We all have become pawns in the political chessboard.

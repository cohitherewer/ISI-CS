 Stillbirth blot on India

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi May 5: India, China, Pakistan and Bangladesh account for half of an estimated 3.2 million stillbirths worldwide, says a study published this week.

 The causes of a significant proportion of these stillbirths ? defined as babies born dead during the last trimester of pregnancy ? remain unknown, says the study by an international team of health researchers.

 Cynthia Stanton at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in the US and her co-workers assessed data from 103 countries and developed a statistical model to arrive at an estimate for stillbirths worldwide.

 Our estimates suggest that more than 3.2 million babies are born dead every year, and the true figure is probably higher, given the limitations of the available data and the fact that stillbirths are under-reported, the researchers said in a report in The Lancet.

 Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia accounted for the highest rate of stillbirths ? 32 per 1,000 deliveries.

 Around 51 per cent of all stillbirths occurred in four countries ? India, China, Pakistan and Bangladesh. 

 Stillbirth rates were five times higher in developing countries (25 per 1,000 deliveries) than in the developed ones (5 per 1,000 deliveries).

 The deaths of most of these babies are avoidable, said the researchers. The low rates of stillbirth in the developed countries show that appropriate healthcare services can help reduce it.

 They said the need to identify the causes of stillbirths is a step towards reducing them. However, even in settings with the possibility of extensive investigation, the cause of death might not be established in a third of stillbirths.

 Independent studies in India have previously identified a number of factors that are believed to be contributing to stillbirths ? adverse foetal growth, intrauterine growth retardation and iodine deficiency disorders.

 Doctors at the NRS Medical College in Calcutta had a decade ago conducted one of the earliest systematic surveys of stillbirths and found that the rate was 38 per 1,000 deliveries.

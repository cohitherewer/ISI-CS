 SC clears air on tribal quota for children

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 15: The Supreme Court has held that children of a tribal woman married to a non-tribal man cannot claim reservation in jobs and other benefits available to Scheduled Tribes.

 Children of a tribal man married to a non-tribal woman could, however, claim the benefits, a bench of Justices H.K. Sema and A.R. Lakshmanan said.

 Distinguishing the two cases, the court said children brought up in a forward-class environment were not subjected to any disability, which was a condition for a person to be brought under the purview of the Constitution (Scheduled Tribes) Order 1950.

 The SC and ST certificate is not a bounty to be distributed. To sustain the claim, one must show that he/she suffered disabilities ? socially, economically and educationally, Justice Sema said.

 The court also said a forward-class woman would not be entitled to reservation if she marries a SC or ST person. A person with an advantageous start in life would not be enti- tled to reservation after entering the community through adoption or marriage.

 The judgment upheld a Madhya Pradesh High Court order dismissing the claim of one Anjan Kumar, who had sought reservation as his mother was a tribal.

 Kumar, who was born to L.K. Sahay, an upper-caste man from Gaya, and Angela Tigga, an Oraon from Madhya Pradesh, had obtained an ST certificate from the SDM, Gaya. He filed the case after being denied a job under the reserved category in the 1993 civil services examination.

 He referred to a home ministry circular that said when an ST woman marries a non-ST man, their children would get the tribal status if the mothers community accepts them.

 But the apex court said Kumar was born and brought up in Gaya. It further said such circulars were not law.

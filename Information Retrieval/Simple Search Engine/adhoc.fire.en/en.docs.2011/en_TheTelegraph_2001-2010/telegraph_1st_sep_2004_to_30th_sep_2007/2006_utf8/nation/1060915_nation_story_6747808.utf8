 Game amp; life end in hail of gunfire

 Montreal, Sept. 14 (AP): Kimveer Gill, the gunman who opened fire at Dawson College in Montreal yesterday, has said on a blog in his name that he liked to play a role-playing Internet game about the Columbine shootings.

 The last of six journal entries in Gills name, on www.vampirefreaks.com, was posted at 10.41 am (1441 GMT), about two hours before he was shot dead at Dawson.

 He said he was drinking whisky in the morning and described his mood the night before as crazy and postal.

 He also said on the site that he liked to play Super Columbine Massacre, a Net-based computer game that simulates the April 1999 shootings at the Colorado high school by two of its students, which left 13 people dead.

 Gill wrote that he hated jocks, preppies, country music and hip-hop. Work sucks... school sucks... life sucks... what else can I say?. Life is a video game youve got to die sometime.

 Below a picture of him aiming the barrel of a gun at the camera an inscription reads: I think I have an obsession with guns... muahahaha.

 Anger and hatred simmers within me, said another caption below a picture of Gill grimacing.

 He also wrote that he is 6 feet 1 inch, was born in Montreal and is of Indian heritage. He said his weakness is laziness and that he fears nothing. 

 Responding to the question, How do you want to die? Gill replied: Like Romeo and Juliet or in a hail of gunfire.

 Gill wore a black trench coat during the shooting and opened fire in the cafeteria just as Columbine students Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris did in 1999. Gill also maintained an online blog, similar to Klebold and Harris, devoted to Gothic culture, heavy metal music such as Marilyn Manson, guns and journal entries expressing hatred against authority figures and society.

 A phone call to his family home was answered by his mother, who didnt give her name. 

 Hes a good man. Just ask anybody. Ask the neighbours. He was a good son, she said. 

 She added that police took his computer. I dont know what they found in the computer. They took everything. 

 She said she first heard about it late last night through the media. The police showed up shortly after.

 A neighbour who lives across the street from the home said Gill was a loner.

 There were never any friends, Louise Leykauf said. He kept to himself. He always wore dark clothes.

 Another neighbour, Mariola Trutschnigg, said she noticed a change in appearance in recent months. He started wearing a mohawk and black clothes, she said.

 A 23-year-old man and a 12-year-old girl accused of a triple murder in Medicine Hat, Alberta, this year also had profiles on www.vampirefreaks.com.

 The girl is accused of killing her parents and brother.

 Montreal police chief Yvan Delorme said the lessons learned from other mass shootings had taught police to try to stop such assaults as quickly as possible.

 Before our technique was to establish a perimeter around the place and wait for the SWAT team. Now the first police officers go right inside. The way they acted saved lives, he said.

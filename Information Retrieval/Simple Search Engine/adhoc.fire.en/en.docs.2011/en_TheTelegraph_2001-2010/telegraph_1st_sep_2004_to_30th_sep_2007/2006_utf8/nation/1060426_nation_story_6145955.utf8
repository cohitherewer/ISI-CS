 Kaavya admits chance lift

 Viswanathan: Apologies to all

 New York, April 25 (AP): Kaavya Viswanathan, the Harvard University sophomore who made a dream debut as an author, has promised to change her novel in future editions after apologising and acknowledging that she had unintentionally borrowed material from an author she deeply admired.

 Viswanathans How Opal Mehta Got Kissed, Got Wild, and Got a Life, published in March by Little, Brown and Company, was the first of a two-book deal reportedly worth six figures. But on Sunday, the Harvard Crimson cited seven passages that closely resemble the style and language of the novels of Megan McCafferty, a former editor at Cosmopolitan.

 When I was in high school, I read and loved two wonderful novels by Megan McCafferty, Sloppy Firsts and Second Helpings, which spoke to me in a way few other books did. Recently, I was very surprised and upset to learn that there are similarities between some passages in my novel... and passages in these books, 19-year-old Viswanathan said in a statement issued by her publisher.

 She also apologised to McCafferty and to any who feel they have been misled by these unintentional errors on my part.

 While the central stories of my book and hers are completely different, I wasnt aware of how much I may have internalised McCaffertys words. I am a huge fan of her work and can honestly say that any phrasing similarities between her works and mine were completely unintentional and unconscious, she said.

 Little, Brown publisher Michael Pietsch said that he did not think Viswanathans borrowings were caused by the pressures of being both a student and an author.

 Pietsch also did not blame Viswanathans collaboration with 17th Street Productions Inc., a book packager specialising in teen narratives which helped her develop the story.

 Every word in that book was written by her, for better or for worse, he said, adding that work on a new edition would begin tomorrow.

 The book had a first printing of 100,000 copies.

 Pietsch acknowledged several passages beyond those cited by the Crimson would have to be revised because of similarities to McCaffertys writings, though the current edition will not be withdrawn from stores.

 Viswanathan, who was 17 when she signed her contract with Little, Brown, is the youngest author signed by the publisher in decades. DreamWorks has already acquired the movie rights to her first book.

 Viswanathans novel tells the story of Opal, a hard-driving teen from New Jersey who earns straight As in high school but gets rejected from Harvard because she forgot to have a social life. Opals father concocts a plan code-named HOWGAL (How Opal Will Get A Life) to get her past the admissions office.

 McCaffertys books follow a heroine named Jessica, a New Jersey girl who excels in high school but struggles with her identity and longs for a boyfriend.

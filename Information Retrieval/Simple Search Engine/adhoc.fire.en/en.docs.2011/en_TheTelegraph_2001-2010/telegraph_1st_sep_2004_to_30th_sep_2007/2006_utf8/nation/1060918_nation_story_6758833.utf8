 Ramani turns gun on police

New Delhi, Sept. 17 (PTI): Socialite Bina Ramani today claimed Delhi police made her an accused in a destruction of evidence case related to Jessica Lals murder in an attempt to silence her as a key witness.

 A day after she walked to freedom after spending nine days in police and judicial custody in a cheating-cum-forgery case, Ramani (in picture) said: Truth and justice will prevail. I will rely on justice. 

 Asked whether she feels that the move was an attempt to silence her, 63-year-old Ramani said: It certainly looks like that. I think the whole nation knows that and feels the same way.

 I havent even got a chance to see what they (police) have said. But one thing is sure, truth will prevail, she said about the case, a more serious charge under which she could be arrested.

 On the cheating and forgery case against her, she said: I havent forged anything in my entire life. I have nothing to hide and my conscience is totally clear.

 Ramani had earlier said the cheating case was an attempt by the police to eliminate witnesses in the murder case.

 She was arrested in Goa on September 6 after a court here issued a non-bailable warrant.

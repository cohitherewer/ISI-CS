 Pak limits film relief

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Jan. 23: Islamabad has taken a strong first step towards lifting the ban on Indian films but the blackout order is still in place, Pakistani officials said. 

 Three days ago, the Pakistan Censor Board scrapped the rule that said every film to be exhibited in Pakistan would have to declare that the film featured no Indian.

 Earlier, the censor board would require an affidavit for every film that said that no Indian actor or Indian crew would be present in the film, said Jamshed Zafar, vice-president, Pakistan Film Producers Association, which is lobbying hard for lifting the ban.

 The rule was omitted when a film produced in 1984, Sohni Mahiwal, featuring Indian actors Sunny Deol, Poonam Dhillon and Zeenat Aman, sought permission to be exhibited in Pakistan.

 It is not an Indian film as it is a Russian collaboration, said Zafar, who has met President Pervez Musharraf twice recently on behalf of his organisation. 

 The deletion of this rule does not mean a total lifting of the ban. But it is a strong first step, he said. He added that the lifting of the ban on exhibition of Indian films is also not far away.

 Pakistan Censor Board chairman Ziauddin clarified that the government has allowed the exhibition of only Sohni Mahiwal on the basis of a court decision. 

 Information minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed said he was unaware of any decision to lift the ban.

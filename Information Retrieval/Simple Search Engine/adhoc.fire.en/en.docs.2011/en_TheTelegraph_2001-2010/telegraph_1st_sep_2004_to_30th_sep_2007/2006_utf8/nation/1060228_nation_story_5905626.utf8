 Lovers lose their corner

 - Drill drives out qila regulars

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Purana Qila

 Location: Eastern side of India Gate, north of Humayun rsquo;s Tomb

 Built: By Humayun in 1533 AD. Captured by Sher Shah Suri after he defeated Humayun. 

 Sher Shah built the 

 Qila-i-Kuhna mosque around 1541 AD and the Sher Mandal, an 

 octagonal building of red sandstone.

 Architecture: Medieval military style. The 

 ramparts of the fort cover a perimeter of 

 two km with 18-metre-high sandstone walls. It has three double-storey gateways surmounted by chhatris.

 Events held: Sound 

 and light shows and classical music 

 concerts mainly from October to March

 New Delhi, Feb. 27: Till about 2 in the afternoon today, the leafy lawns of Purana Qila were a safe haven for tentative lovers. That is when nosy shutterbugs arrived to wrestle with stern securitymen wiping the lawns clean four days ahead of George W. Bushs scheduled address at this historical monument.

 Amid the breathless throng of harried Delhi police constables and their stiff US counterparts, the regulars were obviously out of place. They hid in the corners or strolled uneasily in the tiny museum as overzealous bodyguards and intrusive security devices crowded their comfort zone.

 The Old Fort is one of the few public spaces in the city that provides rare privacy to hundreds of young couples. The guards even take the trouble of finding extra-secluded corners for the more discreet, of course for a price.

 The going rate has gone up from the Rs 50 or Rs 100 they would earlier charge. But given the hostility they regularly face on the streets, lovers in Purana Qila do not seem to mind the rising rates. But this afternoon, they realised that the tranquillity of their coveted corners was soon going to be shattered.

 Bush is to address a select group of top businessmen, politicians and the well-heeled from the grounds of the forts magnificent Sher Mandal, a two-storeyed pavilion that served as a pleasure tower for Afghan king Sher Shah Suri in the mid-sixteenth century.

 They tell us the place is going to be sealed from tomorrow. Is it true? enquired an anxious young couple. They are used to the regular sound-and-light shows and occasional classical music concerts here. But a VVIP visit is not common, and certainly not welcome.

 History suggests that it is better not to let important people wander around unguarded. Humayun died while going down the Sher Mandal for his daily prayers. There are several versions of this story. But the one I like to believe is that Humayun just tumbled to his death, like he tumbled around all his life, says superintending archaeologist B.B. Sharma.

 Bushs visit presented a different set of problems for the keepers of the nearby zoo. As all the entrances are required to be sealed from tomorrow, the zookeepers were hurrying with their routine jobs. 

 Zoo director D.M. Singh had rushed off for an emergency meeting in the environment ministry. You see, we have to organise feed for our inmates. All this needs to be settled before the gates are sealed, said a zookeeper.

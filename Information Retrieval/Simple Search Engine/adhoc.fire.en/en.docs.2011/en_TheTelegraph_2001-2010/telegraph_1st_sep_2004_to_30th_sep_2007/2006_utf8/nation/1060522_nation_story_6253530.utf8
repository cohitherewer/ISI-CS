 Brinda fee fire

 Ranchi, May 21 (PTI): CPM leader Brinda Karat today said huge capitation fees charged by private educational institutions, and not reservation, was giving merit a slow burial and urged the Centre to put a stop to the practice. 

 She suggested increasing seats for economically backward sections. At present, merit means money. Dole out money and get merit certificates from private educational institutions, Karat said.

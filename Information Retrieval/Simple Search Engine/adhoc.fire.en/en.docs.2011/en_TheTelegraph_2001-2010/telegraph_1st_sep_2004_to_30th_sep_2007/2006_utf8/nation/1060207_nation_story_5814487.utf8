The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 U-turn, under compulsion

 - Left to attend meet, singh to discuss iran in house

 Karat: Change overnight

 New Delhi/Calcutta, Feb. 6: A day after turning down an invitation from Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, the Left parties today retraced their position, deciding to attend a meeting of the coordination committee with the ruling alliance, scheduled for February 13.

 The decision was taken at a meeting between the chiefs of the CPM and the CPI. Sources said Prakash Karat, the CPM general secretary who visited the CPI headquarters with the new invitation, persuaded his counterpart, A.B. Bardhan, to attend the meeting.

 Although it was not quite clear what led the Left to change its mind so quickly, an indication was available in Calcutta where CPM Bengal secretary Anil Biswas said: There is no question of a boycott?. There is no alternative, this is a political compulsion.

 The compulsion is to not give the Opposition BJP-led National Democratic Alliance a handle. Scenting a rift between the allies, the Congress and the Left, NDA leader George Fernandes fished in troubled waters yesterday, calling on the Left to stop supporting the government. 

 Sources said at the meeting, the UPA government could try and cool Left tempers which have flared over the airport privatisation and Indias decision to vote for reporting Iran to the UN Security Council.

 Such was the unhappiness that Biswas had even issued dire warnings of reviewing support. It must, however, be kept in mind that Biswas is speaking from a state where the CPM and the Congress will shortly contest the Assembly elections against each other.

 Ahead of the CPM politburo meeting in Calcutta on Thursday and Friday, the rhetoric was no less bitter. 

 Biswas said: We will attend the (coordination committee) meeting to iterate our stand on these issues (airport and Iran). The UPA has deviated from the common minimum programme. We apprehend similar violations in days to come. We will go to the people and explain how the Congress is trying to destabilise the country.

 Sending a strong signal to the government, the CPI secretariat, which met today, decided to convene an emergency session of the partys national executive to review its ties with the government.

 Yesterday, the Left parties had decided that each constituent would convene a meeting of their apex decision-making body to discuss the issue.

 The central committee of the Forward Bloc will meet in a few days. RSP leader Abani Roy has announced his partys decision to sever ties with the UPA. 

 But in the CPM, reviewing the partys relationship with the UPA would require a discussion in the central committee, the decision-making layer just below the politburo.

 Hope for tutors-to-be

 New Delhi, Sept. 23: Offering relief to students who had obtained certificates in teacher education from institutes not registered with the National Council for Teachers Education (NCTE), the Centre has amended the law to validate certificates issued by such institutes.

 The National Council For Teacher Education (Amendment and Validation) Ordinance 2006, which allows these centres to seek recognition with retrospective effect, is likely to bring cheer in Bengal as Calcutta High Court had banned 115 primary teachers training institutes. 

 The court had said candidates holding certificates from institutes not registered with the NCTE should not be considered for recruitment.

 The ordinance, amending the National Council for Teacher Education Act 1993, is reported to have been promulgated by the Centre mainly to help students whose qualifications were invalidated by the high court.

 A new chapter inserted in the act allows an institute, which had already conducted an examination after being granted affiliation by an examination body, to apply for NCTE recognition with retrospective effect. 

 The provision, which came into force on September 11, will remain in force for six months. 

 The ordinance, which is being seen by some as an attempt to overreach the courts order, has clarified that anything done or any action taken according to the new provisions would be valid notwithstanding any judgment, decree or order of any court to the contrary.

 The amendment will validate qualifications obtained from unregistered institutes as soon as recognition is granted by the NCTE but such institutes are barred from admitting new students till they obtain recognition.

 On a PIL alleging that many institutes had not obtained the mandatory NCTE sanction, the high court had declared them illegal. Of the 131 institutes recognised by the West Bengal Board for Primary Education, only 16 are recognised by the NCTE.

 The board had granted affiliation and conducted tests according to the West Bengal Primary Education Act 2000 but the petitioners had contended no teachers training institute could start functioning before a nod from the NCTE.

 The order was an embarrassment for the Bengal government, which had enacted a law allowing the board to grant affiliation to such institutes.

 DMK, ally at odds on staggered quota

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chennai, Aug. 26: The DMK today distanced itself from ally PMKs hard line against staggered introduction of the other backward classes quota in central institutions of higher education.

 The reservation bill, which was tabled in Parliament yesterday before being sent to a standing committee, provides for the 27 per cent quota to be implemented over three years. The provision had provoked an outburst from PMK chief S. Ramadoss, who wants the quota introduced at one go.

 Asked about this, DMK president and Tamil Nadu chief minister M. Karunanidhi told reporters, We are happy to the extent that we got (the bill tabled). We will continue to fight for what is (the backward classes) due.

 Ramadoss had yesterday criticised the DMK for failing to pressure the Centre on the issue as strongly as it had done during the controversy over the move to sell shares in the Neyveli Lignite Corporation.

 Karunanidhi countered this by saying that while almost all political parties and trade unions were united against the divestment plan, the country was divided on reservation.

 One mustnt forget the chequered history of the movement for OBC reservation in the country, the chief minister said. He cited how even the Mandal Commissions recommendation for an OBC quota in central government jobs, accepted by the V.P. Singh government in 1990, could not be carried out at one go.

 Full victory on reservation was still some way off, Karunanidhi said, adding he would try and convince Ramadoss about this when they met.

 Just as when a car stops or slows down you have to push it, we will take steps to nudge the OBC quota bills implementation forward.

 Mealtime clash in Mumbai jail kills 1

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Dec. 23: A man accused of robbery was killed and four others were injured when two groups of undertrials clashed inside Arthur Road jail today.

 Identified as John Robert DSouza, the 34-year-old died at JJ Hospital where he was brought grievously injured with stab wounds.

 DSouza was arrested in 2001 by the crime branch on robbery charges, jail sources said.

 According to deputy inspector-general (prisons) S.P. Yadav, the clash occurred near circle 6 of barrack number 4 when the undertrials gathered for the morning meal.

 An argument ensued when water from DSouzas plate seeped into the plate of another undertrial, Sachin Shete.

 Yadav said DSouza and Shete were hardly on the best of terms, and the argument led to a fight during which Shete broke the aluminium meal plate and stabbed DSouza several times.

 Shete also suffered minor injuries in the scuffle along with three others, believed to be of African origin.

 The NM Joshi Marg police station has registered a murder case against Shete.

 Violent clashes between inmates of the jail are common, but this is the first time that an inmate has been reported dead.

 Regular fights have been reported from the jail between rival gangsters loyal to Dawood Ibrahim and Chhota Rajan.

 The two gangs have been at loggerheads since the 1993 serial blasts when Rajan broke away from Dawood and formed a separate organised underworld syndicate.

 Rajan entered into a tacit understanding with Indian intelligence agencies and provided vital information about Dawoods movements when the don was in the United Arab Emirates and later moved to Karachi.

 Rajan also eliminated several Dawood men out on bail in the 1993 serial blasts case.

 In 2001, Dawoods men tried to kill Rajan in a Bangkok apartment.

 The jail houses over 3,000 undertrials and convicts, though its capacity is said to be around 1,700. 

 Many of the 100 convicted in the blasts case are lodged in the high security jail.

 Most of the clashes in the jail have been reported either during meal time when the undertrials come together or when groups of accused are transported to city courts for hearing.

 In August last year, a head constable suffered serious head injuries when four Rajan gangsters got into an argument with those from the Dawood camp while being shifted to another cell.

 The undertrials clashed with bricks, which were part of construction material for rebuilding a toilet.

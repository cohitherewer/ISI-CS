 New Delhi, July 26: A week after the death of Devesh Kumar Swain, the lone Indian killed in the Israeli air strikes on Lebanon, the Centre today sounded Tel Aviv on compensation for his family.

 Swains family has received only Rs 25,000 from the Orissa government so far.

 The foreign ministry took up the subject of compensation with the Israeli ambassador in Delhi, David Danieli. Tel Avivs response is awaited, a ministry official said.

 Swain, 42, worked at the Maliban glass factory in Lebanons Bekaa valley which was struck in Israeli shelling last week. He is survived by his wife Shakuntala and four children at Khadipala village in Orissas Kendrapara district.

 Delhi had earlier failed to register even a protest with the Israeli embassy over Swains death, arguing it had taken place in a hostile environment.

 Delhi, however, had protested when an Indian soldier working for the UN peace-keeping mission in Lebanon was injured in Israeli shelling. Tel Aviv has regretted both incidents and promised investigations.

 The reports of the death of four UN peacekeepers ? one each from China, Canada, Austria and Finland ? has raised concerns about the safety of the Indian troops stationed in Lebanon as part of the UN Interim Force in Lebanon (Unifil).

 Delhi has said its 673 soldiers are safe and has left it to the Security Council to decide if the peace mission should be extended beyond July 31.

 A senior foreign ministry official said the Security Council was considering a three-month extension for Unifil, and Delhi would continue to station its troops if the term was extended.

 The beleaguered UN force is under pressure as the Israeli defence forces and Hizbollah have intensified their attacks.

 India has already launched a massive evacuation plan for its civilians trapped in the war zone. Around 1,500 have been moved to safety through a sea-air corridor established by Indian Navy ships and Air-India aircraft.

 CPM skips Sonia rally

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chennai, April 25: Congress chief Sonia Gandhi today hinted at her partys role as a king-maker in Tamil Nadu but a key ally spoiled what could have been a perfect picture of coalition harmony.

 The CPM, which supports the Congress-led alliance at the Centre, skipped the rally aimed at mainly boosting the image of former chief minister M. Karunanidhis DMK.

 While CPI veteran A.M. Gopu represented his party, coalition leaders on the dais squirmed when Tamil Nadu Congress chief M. Krishnaswamy could not find anyone from the CPM as he welcomed all the top leaders present.

 Apparently, the CPM stayed away because todays rallies in all the three places with Sonia as the star speaker had been organised by the Congress. However, what made the CPMs absence the immediate talking point at the rally was the recent statement of its general secretary Prakash Karat that their alliance in Tamil Nadu was only with the DMK.

 In neighbouring Kerala, the CPM and the Congress are rivals.

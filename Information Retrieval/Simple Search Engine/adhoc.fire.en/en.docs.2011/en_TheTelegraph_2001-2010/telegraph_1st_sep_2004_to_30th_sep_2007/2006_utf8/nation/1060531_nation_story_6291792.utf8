 Murmur over faith economics

 ASHWANI TALWAR

 New Delhi, May 30: When all faiths are equal before the state, shouldnt it spend the same amount to mark milestone events of all religions, some parliamentarians want to know. 

 The question was not exactly put this way, but there were murmurs of dissent from a couple of MPs over the small amount the Centre has sanctioned to mark the 2550th anniversary of mahaparinirvana or the passing away and salvation of the Buddha. 

 The year-long commemoration has been allotted a paltry Rs 10 crore, prompting two MPs to point out to a parliamentary consultative committee of the tourism and culture ministry two instances in the past when the government had allotted substantially more funds for similar events for Sikhs and Jains. 

 The BJPs Shripad Yasso Naik and Sikkim Democratic Fronts Nakul Das Rai said that in 1999, the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government sanctioned Rs 50 crore for the 300th anniversary of the founding of the Khalsa Panth. 

 In 2001, for the 2600th birth anniversary of Mahavira, at least double the amount of what has been sanctioned for the mahaparinirvana was allowed.

 The Buddhist commemoration was launched on May 13 at the Vigyan Bhavan here. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh inaugurated the event, Congress president Sonia Gandhi made a speech. All through the year, there would be seminars and exhibitions, Buddhist monuments would be renovated and a postage stamp may be issued to mark the mahaparinirvana.

 The objections whispered at the consultative committee meeting, chaired by tourism and culture minister Ambika Soni, are not the first. 

 The implementation committee of experts, who chalked out the mahaparinirvana anniversary plan, also said Rs 10 crore was too little. So this committee, also headed by Soni, has set up a sub-group to figure out how much money would really be needed to implement the projects planned for the year.

 Once the group comes out with the figures, the implementation committee will lobby for more funds with the finance ministry and the Planning Commission.

 In any case, there has been a sizeable expenditure over the years on upgrading infrastructure around Buddhist sites, simply because they draw a large number of tourists from overseas.

 More money is needed and the Centre hopes it would get it from the Japanese government.

 The tourism and culture ministry has chalked out a Rs 5,500-crore mega project for sites in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Orissa, Himachal Pradesh, Sikkim and Jammu and Kashmir. It is awaiting Japanese loans for this.

 Apart from the conservation of monuments, the money would go into developing roads, airports and amenities for tourists. 

 Japan has helped in developing Buddhist circuits in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. 

 Countrywide, the ministry has identified 22 Buddhist sites for development.

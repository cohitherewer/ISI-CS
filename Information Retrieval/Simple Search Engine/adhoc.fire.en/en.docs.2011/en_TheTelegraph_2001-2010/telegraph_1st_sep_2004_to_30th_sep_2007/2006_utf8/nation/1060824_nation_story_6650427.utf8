 Apology to Amisha

 Mumbai, Aug. 23 (PTI): The organisers of the India Day parade in New York have apologised to Amisha Patel and Air-India for the misunderstanding that led to a complaint being filed against the actress for allegedly misbehaving with an airline employee.

 In a statement, the Federation of Indian Associations said it had booked two first-class seats for Patel and her companion for the Mumbai-Newark flight but the booking was automatically transferred from one flight to another, creating confusion. 

 We sincerely regret this confusion and wish to tender our apologies to Amisha Patel and Air-India in this matter, the statement said.

 An Air-India employee had alleged that Patel had misbehaved with her after her companion was not upgraded to first class.

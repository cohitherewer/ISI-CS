 Transit leaves Nepal on edge

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 5: India has decided to extend a transit treaty with Nepal for only three months, stonewalling the kingdoms attempts to ensure an automatic renewal for seven years.

 The treaty is a vital lifeline for Nepal as it allowed the land-locked country to trade with the outside world.

 The temporary arrangement ? aimed at preventing the treaty from collapsing ? was put in place after the two sides failed to agree to a comprehensive review of the agreement.

 The transit treaty, due to expire today, has been extended till April 5. The decision was taken at the end of two-day talks between Indian and Nepalese trade officials. 

 The renewal of the treaty can be stalled if any side raises objections. Sources said Nepal was in favour of automatic renewal of the pact for seven years.

 Indias objection to the renewal has raised fears in Nepal that the big neighbour is reviving arm-twisting tactics of the past. It has also brought back memories of an economic blockade in the late nineties.

 Nepal is worried about Indias insistence on reducing the number of transit points. The kingdom wants to retain at least seven transit points. Officials said India has not spelled out the modalities of the review process. 

 India had allowed Nepal to carry third-country goods from 15 transit points. But Nepal has been able to use only six. 

 Nepal made an offer that its territory can be used as a transit route between India and China. India refused to facilitate import of sensitive goods from the customs points. Delhi said it is willing to allow Kathmandu to import and export goods from the Mumbai port. 

 A spokesperson for the external affairs ministry said the extension was granted to enable the two countries to complete the review process.

 On the negotiation table was a five-point agenda that included rationalisation of transit points, movement of goods like fertiliser and sugar, access to other Indian territory through Nepal and railway facilities.

 The renewal of the pact was crucial in the wake of deteriorating relations between India and Nepal after the February 1 royal coup. With India, the US and the UK deciding to restrict arms supply to Kathmandu, the Kingdom turned to Beijing. 

 India is keen to curtail the growing proximity between Nepal and China, which is against Delhis strategic interests. India also wants to restrict movement of sensitive goods to key transit points as it affects the domestic market.

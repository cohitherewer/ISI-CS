 Oscar ticket for Rang De

 - Aamir-starrer edges out Krrish, Munnabhai

 A scene from Rang De Basanti

 Mumbai, Sept. 25: Rang De Basanti was today expectedly chosen the Indian entry for the Oscars, triggering a frenetic expectation that has become an annual ritual to be followed by disappointment.

 This year, there were eight films in contention, including Lage Raho Munnabhai, Krrish and Omkara. It was a tough call, Film Federation of India member Suparn Sen said.

 Rang De Basanti stood out for its cinematic quality, its script. It is a very contemporary film and overall we thought it would be a good choice, said chief juror and film-maker Basu Chatterjee.

 Featuring Aamir Khan, Atul Kulkarni, Soha Ali Khan, Kunal Kapoor and Anupam Kher, the film describes how seven youngsters graduate from carefree college students to rebels against the system.

 Rakeyesh Omprakash Mehras blockbuster will vie for the Best Foreign Film category. Only three Indian films Mother India (1957), Salaam Bombay (1988) and Lagaan (2001) have made it to the shortlist.

 Yet Indian films have had huge success overseas this year and received critical acclaim. Omkara, based on Shakespeares Othello, Krrish portraying the Indian superhero, and the Aamir-Kajol starrer Fanaa had record outings in the US and Britain.

 With US collections of $427,000 (Rs 1.96 crore) in just three days, Omkara burst into Varietys US box office top-20 charts. Rang De grossed Rs 6.25 crore from the four major markets the US, UK, Australia and the Gulf in its opening weekend.

 Rakesh Roshans Krrish netted 59,000 (Rs 51.5 lakh) on the first day in Britain while in America it did business worth $170,000 (Rs 78 lakh) on 67 prints. If the trade buzz is to be believed, Adlabs recovered its Rs 9-crore investment on the films overseas rights within 24 hours.

 Many in Bollywood are surprised that with all that box office success behind them, Indian filmmakers should still crave Oscar glory despite the serial disappointments on awards night.

 Its a game the film industry plays, said film-maker Mahesh Bhatt. 

 Aamir started the madness. Even Saaransh was selected for the Oscars, I was informed by one of my production managers, but we didnt dance in the streets. The craze about the Oscars is a reflection on the kind of people we have become. The whole thing is absurd.

 Filmmaker Pradeep Sarkar doesnt agree. How can you say that? Its the Oscars! Its the biggest achievement for anyone related to films. Getting a nomination just goes on to say how these films are loved, he said.

 One of Rang Des cast, Kunal Kapoor, too feels that appreciation is something one can never get enough of.

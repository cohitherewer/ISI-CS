 Cry for fast-track rape justice

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 12: Fast-track courts can serve as a deterrent in rape cases by increasing the conviction rate, experts say. 

 A fast-track court in Rajasthan today sentenced a rapist to seven years in jail less than a month after the crime was committed.

 Delay in trial is one of the main factors behind witnesses turning hostile, a senior public prosecutor at the Tis Hazari district courts said. A public witness not only loses interest in the case, but is also likely to be influenced by the accused during a protracted trial, she said.

 Even victims tend to abandon the case with the change in circumstances over a period of time, she added.

 In several cases of rape of minors, the victims are married by the time they are called upon to depose and then they are unwilling. 

 In one case, she said, the victims brother requested the court not to insist on her presence since her in-laws did not know of the rape. 

 Since the list of witnesses in rape cases is usually short, fast-track courts can be helpful, the public prosecutor said. 

 The apex court has ruled that conviction could be based on the statement of the victim if it is corroborated by medical evidence, she added. 

 Girija Vyas, the National Commission for Women chairperson, said all states should follow Rajasthans example in delivering speedy justice to rape victims. The NCW has recommended trial of all heinous rape cases by fast-rack courts, she said. 

 It has also suggested changes in laws relating to sexual offences. A chargesheet in a rape case should be filed within three days and statements of witnesses immediately recorded before a magistrate to ensure they do not turn hostile during the trial, Vyas said.

 Legal experts said it was not possible to hand any particular case to a fast-track court, but state governments could list a class of cases, such as rape.

 In a fast-track court, the accused gets the opportunity to defend himself like in any other court. But the trial is held at one go, without adjournments, making justice swift.

 Delhi has entrusted fast-track courts with all old cases filed before 1999 with no classification on the basis of offences.

 Minor raped

 A minor girl was raped in a moving car in the Sultanpuri area of north-west Delhi allegedly by her neighbour and his relative this morning, police said. 

 The 15-year-old girl, a student of Class VII, was raped in the car allegedly by her neighbour Sudhir and his brother-in-law Devinder when she was on her way to school. The duo has been arrested, police said. 

 According to the victim, Sudhir and Devinder dropped her near her school around noon. 

 A case has been registered against the accused persons and the car in which the offence was allegedly committed has been recovered, they said, adding the victim has been medically examined.

 However, Sudhirs wife claimed her husband and the victim had illicit relations and the allegation was false and fabricated.

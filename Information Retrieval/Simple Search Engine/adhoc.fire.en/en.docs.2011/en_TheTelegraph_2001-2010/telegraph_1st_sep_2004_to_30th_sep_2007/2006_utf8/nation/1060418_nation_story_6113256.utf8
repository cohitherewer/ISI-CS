 Mumbai, April 17: Aamir Khan might heed Arundhati Roys advice and stop endorsing Coca-Cola if he finds the company in the wrong in the water pollution controversy at Keralas Plachimada.

 The Rang De Basanti star, who made headlines last week by backing the Narmada dam oustees and Bhopal gas victims, today said he would continue to champion social causes and Plachimada could well be his next stop.

 Whenever I feel I need to lend my voice, I will, Aamir, dressed casually and sporting a baseball cap, said at his Pali Hill flat in Bandra.

 In Delhi on Friday, when he visited the agitating Narmada protesters, he was handed a memorandum listing the Plachimada protesters demands addressed to Coke, whose bottling plant there has been accused of causing water shortage and pollution.

 Writer-activist Roy later said she would give Aamir a big zindabad if he stopped endorsing Coke. Today, the actor promised to get to the bottom of the issue.

 Coca-Cola officials are scheduled to meet me in the next few days. I will understand the issue in its entirety, and will even meet people in Kerala if need be. At the end of this exercise, if I feel they (Coke) are in the wrong, I will move away from them (alag ho jaoonga). But, we must not hold a company to ransom just because it is a multinational.

 Khan is Cokes brand ambassador and had featured in the award-winning Thanda Matlab Coca Cola commercials directed by friend Ashutosh Gowariker.

 The Bollywood star welcomed the days Supreme Court decision on the Narmada dispute as a victory for humanity, and appealed to Medha Patkar and two of her associates to break their fast.

 The court didnt stay work at the dam and fixed the next hearing for May 1, but said that unless the oustees were properly rehabilitated, it would stop construction.

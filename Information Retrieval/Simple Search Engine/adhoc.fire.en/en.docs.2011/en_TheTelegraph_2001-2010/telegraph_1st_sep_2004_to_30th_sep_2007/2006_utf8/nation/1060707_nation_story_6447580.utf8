 Jaya forces flip-flop

 M.R. VENKATESH

 Chennai, July 6: A month after forcing M. Karunanidhi into an about-turn on fuel prices, Jayalalithaa has got him to do a double somersault on stake sale in the Neyveli Lignite Corporation.

 It was partly his annoyance at Jayalalithaa being invited to inaugurate the workers agitation at Neyveli that had prompted the DMK chief minister into his first U-turn on the subject.

 From direct opposition to sale, Karunanidhi changed tack to float a compromise formula that would sound pro-worker while keeping Delhi happy: sell the stake to the employees themselves.

 The move, meant to be a trial balloon, boomeranged spectacularly. The Centre eagerly grabbed the suggestion, announcing on Monday that a large share of the equity being sold would be reserved for employees, but the trade unions and the Left rejected any form of divestment.

 The planned indefinite strike at Neyveli began on Tuesday. The DMK, whose labour arm enjoyed the loyalty of the largest chunk of the companys 19,000-strong workforce, now risked losing supporters to the ADMK workers wing, party sources said.

 An alarmed Karunanidhi, whom the Centres quick acceptance of his suggestion had taken by surprise, did his second U-turn and asked it to drop the divestment plan altogether.

 As Delhi kept silent and Jayalalithaa scoffed at his vacillation, Karunandhi was left with no choice but to prove his loyalty to the workers cause by the drastic means of a pullout threat.

 Last month, a day after Karunanidhi had told the Centre he wouldnt slash sales tax on the increased fuel prices, Jayalalithaa had got him to reverse his stand with a single public statement. She had reminded him that after a fuel price hike when she was chief minister, he had advised her to cut sales tax.

 As the DMK chiefs move today got the Centre to put all divestment decisions on hold, Jayalalithaa promptly claimed credit.

 This is certainly a victory for the workers, she said, but I am equally happy that my reading of the situation? has come true.

 Jayalalithaa had earlier declined to inaugurate the agitation on July 3, saying she didnt want to divide the workers by provoking the DMK-affiliated union to walk out of the strike.

 Karunanidhi tonight faxed a letter to the Prime Minister and Sonia Gandhi thanking them for the latest decision. Employees of all the public sector undertakings owe a deep gratitude to the UPA government, he said in near-identical letters.

 Asia-Europe club opens doors for India

 Washington, Sept. 11: Nearly 12 years after Europe and Asia together rejected New Delhis attempts to join the biggest biennial Asia-Europe summit, India has finally been invited to join the Asia-Europe Meeting (Asem).

 The sixth Asem summit in Helsinki today decided to invite Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to attend the organisations next biennial meeting in Beijing on October 24-25, 2008, officials hosting the Helsinki summit said.

 Contrary to the conventional wisdom that Indias potential as a global power is opening doors worldwide for New Delhi, the invitation to join Asem has been prompted, partly, by Singhs presence today in Brasilia to attend the India-Brazil-South Africa (IBSA) Dialogue Forum summit.

 Asems 38 member states 25 European and 13 Asian have been somewhat panicked that India, Brazil and South Africa, three of the worlds large emerging economies, are turning their backs on conventional multilateral institutions and charting their own course.

 The invitation to Singh is an attempt by prominent leaders in Europe and Asia to bring New Delhi back into their fold.

 Indias inclusion in Asem has also been prompted by growing discomfort among Asian countries, which opposed Indias membership in the 1990s, over the growing imbalance in the Europe-Asia dialogue.

 With the steady expansion of the European Union (EU), Asem now has 25 European members. Asia has only 13.

 Asems charter allows any country joining the EU to automatically become part of Asem. 

 That means the number of European nations in the group would go up to 27 soon with the accession of Romania and Bulgaria to the EU. 

 Asian states, which once fought Indian attempts to join Asem, therefore, concluded that the only way to overcome this imbalance was to have more Asians in the organisation.

 Along with India, the Helsinki summit decided to admit Pakistan, Mongolia and the Asean secretariat in Jakarta to be a part of the Asem process.

 Officials in Helsinki said some internal procedures still have to be completed on both the EUs part and that of Asia for Indias admission to be formalised, but this is expected to be done at the next Asem foreign ministers meeting, which Germany has agreed to host in 2007.

 The idea of an institutionalised Asia-Europe dialogue was conceived in 1994 when it dawned on the Europeans that the coming century would be Asias.

 The Asians enthusiastically responded to the idea and the Asean became the engine for the dialogue on the Asian side because India was still lagging in economic dynamism or reforms and the Asean was seen worldwide as Tiger economies.

 Then Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao was very keen that New Delhi should be part of the Asia-Europe dialogue, but countries like Indonesia and Malaysia were loathe to let India into Asem unless Pakistan was allowed in as well.

 Some Asian states, such as Singapore, favoured Indias inclusion but did not want Pakistan to join.

 Europe, too, was obsessed with China and South East Asia then and felt India would be a drag on the new organisation.

 It was a disappointment for Rao when the first Asem summit convened in Thailand without India in 1996.

 Subsequent Indian efforts to join Asem failed just as New Delhis bid to be a part of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) had failed.

 In the case of Asem, the aberration has now been corrected with the decision of the Helsinki summit.

 Nine die in Nalanda massacre 

 ASHISH SINHA

 Gowachak (Nalanda), May 19: Ten-odd policemen guarding a panchayat poll station in Dumri village, dominated by upper caste Bhumihars and overlooking this hamlet, had a choice to make yesterday: whether to save human lives or protect the booth.

 They opted for the latter as that was their brief.

 The complication of Dumri falling in Sheikhpura and Gowachak in Nalanda ? which are adjoining districts ? also prevented the police from acting.

 Nine persons from the backward castes were killed in Gowachak by men from the upper caste, who, after the recent changes in the panchayat law, are set to further lose political control of rural Bihar.

 Chief minister Nitish Kumar, who visited the village in his home district today, refrained from calling the killings an upper-caste-versus-lower-caste phenomenon.

 It is a criminal act. The trigger-happy killers may have been aware of the caste of the victims. But that is a matter of investigation, said Nitish, who announced compensation and government jobs for the families of those killed.

 Scores of villagers countered the chief ministers assessment. Gowachak is dominated by the backward Yadavs and the extremely backward Kahars. The killers, who operate in the same area, definitely knew this. If they were simply desperate to kill, they could have done that in Dumri itself. But then, that village is full of Bhumihars, argued Dev Anand, a Kahar youth of Gowachak.

 A group of six persons, two of them well armed, entered Gowachak late last afternoon from the Dumri side. They were returning from Bhadrathi village where a rival Bhumihar group had killed one of their supporters.

 A 13-year-old, who was in the group with his father, had started to run when he saw men with guns. But the father asked him to return, saying they had done no wrong and so would not be targeted. The boy returned. Within seconds, the father and the son were shot dead, the witness said.

 If the message the killers wanted to convey to the lower caste people was to remain within limits, they did their job well.

 Tears trickling down her cheeks, Sharda Devi, an elderly woman from the deprived Nai (barber) caste, said: Babusaheb, my son is contesting the panchayat elections. Now I will ask him to withdraw from the race. We are poor people and we cannot take on the powerful Bhumihars. 

 Villagers of Dumri were tightlipped about the incident and would not utter a word on the charge of the killers taking shelter in the house of Naro Singh, a local Bhumihar contesting the post of mukhiya. After much persuasion, one resident opened up and said: Yeh ladai to chalti rahegi (This battle will go on).

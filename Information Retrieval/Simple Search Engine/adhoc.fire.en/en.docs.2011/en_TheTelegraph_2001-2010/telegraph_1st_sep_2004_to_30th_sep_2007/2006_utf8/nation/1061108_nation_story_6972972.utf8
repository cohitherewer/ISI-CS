 Ram rethink 

 after Jessica trial blow New Delhi 

 (PTI): Delhi High Court has dismissed an application 

 by Jessica Lal murder accused Manu Sharmas counsel 

 Ram Jethmalani seeking transfer of the case to another court.

 The former law minister said he 

 would decide whether to appear on behalf of the prime accused 

 at all or not. 

 Jethmalani filed the plea after 

 a newspaper report suggested that Justice R.S. Sodhi, who 

 leads the bench hearing the case, had been approached by 

 Sharmas family in 2002 offering favours in return 

 for an acquittal.

 The defence counsel said Sharma 

 feared that the judge would be unable to deliver an unbiased 

 verdict following the report. 

 We adopt an open court hearing 

 of every case and they are open to public debate, discussion 

 and criticism. Insulating ourselves will result in great 

 injustice to the parties involved in the matter, Sodhi 

 said on Tuesday.

 Stay on Venugopal dismissal 

 New Delhi: Delhi High Court has stayed 

 the dismissal of AIIMS director P. Venugopal till February 

 22, 2007. 

 Although such stays would have 

 attracted celebrations by a large section of the resident 

 doctors till recently, hardly anyone barring faculty members 

 close to him seemed particularly interested on Tuesday.

 Quite frankly, if he is 

 dismissed again sometime next year, there will hardly be 

 any protests. He will not be able to help us in our anti-reservation 

 protests anymore, an office-bearer of the AIIMS Resident 

 Doctors Association said.

 Venugopal has been facing barbs 

 from health minister Anbumani Ramadoss for supporting strikes 

 against reservation for backward classes. 

 NN Sippy

 Mumbai (PTI): Film producer 

 N.N. Sippy died at Mumbais Breach Candy Hospital on

 Sargam, Chor Machaye Shor and Fakira, 

 was admitted to the hospital with heart ailments last week. 

 He is survived by his son and three daughters. 

 Mysore plot 

 Kozhikode (PTI): Two persons, 

 one of them a police head constable, have been arrested 

 in connection with the Mysore terror plot. They had allegedly 

 helped Pakistani national and suspected al Badr terrorist 

 Mohammed Fahad procure a fake passport. 

 Kids killed

 Lucknow: Two schoolchildren 

 were killed when a minibus in which they were travelling 

 plunged into a river in Muzaffarnagar on Tuesday. The driver 

 lost control of the vehicle while trying to negotiate a 

 speeding truck.

 The Goa government plans to convert a Portuguese-era building 

 in Panaji into a national museum, which will show artefacts

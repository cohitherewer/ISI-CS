The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Mollah demands discussion

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, July 9: Bengals land and land reforms minister Abdur Rezzak Mollah, who had on Friday warned of a possible food crisis if farmland was taken away for industry at the present rate, today demanded discussions in the party to ensure a balance. 

 Discussions always help us clear our understanding and close ranks. I have already submitted a report containing proposals on land use to the party. If it wants me to elaborate on alternative ways to ensure balanced use of land and our food security, I will be happy to do so, he told The Telegraph today. 

 CPM state secretariat member Benoy Konar, however, ruled out any discussion on food security or allied issues in the party. These are nothing new. We have already discussed them. Now our task is to implement our policies, said Konar, who is overseeing party affairs in the absence of state secretary Biman Bose, now in the US.

 Mollah had told the Assembly on Friday: (Our) productivity has declined because land for cultivation has been reduced. Our food security may be in crisis if we fail to increase agri-productivity by five times and reclaim fallow and arid land for agriculture and related activities.

 Konar, though, reiterated what the chief minister had said earlier. He said: It needs no telling that production of foodgrain decreases with reduction of cultivable land. But we have to increase fertility of the land to yield more and sustain our food security. 

 A group of ministers will discuss the contours of the land use policy on July 21.

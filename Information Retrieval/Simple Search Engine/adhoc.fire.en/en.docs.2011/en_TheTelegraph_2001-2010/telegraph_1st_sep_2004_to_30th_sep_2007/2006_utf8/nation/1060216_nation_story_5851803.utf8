 Rajnath gives govt some tips

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 15: On the eve of the budget session, the BJP tried to hit the ruling UPA where it really hurts ? issues concerning the aam aadmi ? and offered advice on a range of matters, from efficient tax administration to agricultural reforms. 

 In a memorandum submitted to the Prime Minister and the finance minister today, BJP chief Rajnath Singh listed almost all social welfare and rural development plans as projects that are not working effectively on the ground.

 The party has submitted around 80 notices for debate in Parliament that starts tomorrow. Of these, over 20 per cent concern the public distribution system, problems dogging farmers and price rise. 

 Rajnath announced that he would supervise a countrywide campaign on increasing prices while Parliament is in session.

 Describing the National Rural Employment Guarantee Programme as a mere rehash of the Food for Work scheme, he said it has been delayed and introduced in a truncated form to cover only 200 districts. 

 Our estimate is that while the Union budget had allocated Rs 11,000 crore for the scheme, the actual expenditure has been far less and the additional allocation is, in fact, less than Rs 2,000 crore.

 Rajnath said the central allocation for agriculture was minuscule and that the Centre was paying no heed to the plight of the farmers. 

 The BJP chief alleged that the Centre was curbing the growth of the housing sector. He demanded that the ceiling on home loan interest up to Rs 10 lakh be fixed at 7 per cent and service tax be removed from cooperative housing societies.

 Alleging that many unreasonable demands have been made on the common man, he said the Centre should promote a taxpayer-friendly environment.

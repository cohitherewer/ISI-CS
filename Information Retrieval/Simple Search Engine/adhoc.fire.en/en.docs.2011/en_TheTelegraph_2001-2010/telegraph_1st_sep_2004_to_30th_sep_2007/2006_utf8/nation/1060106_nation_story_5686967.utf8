 Carnage over romance 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, Jan. 5: A man burnt to death his uncle, aunt and three young cousins because they wouldnt let him marry the childrens eldest sister.

 The revenge attack in Kareli village, Allahabad district, comes four days after five children and their pregnant mother were roasted alive in Bihars Raghopur following a property dispute coloured by caste conflict.

 The teenaged girl, the reason for the murder, Neetu, was away in Kanpur where her parents had married her off to keep her away from cousin Bhaiyalal alias Raju, with whom she had had a brief affair.

 The young lovers had eloped last July before returning in December, and the shamed parents had hurriedly arranged a match for Neetu over Bhaiyalals protests, police said.

 The clue to the crime came from 14-year-old Nanu, the murdered couples second daughter who had escaped death because she spent the night with her aunt, prime suspect Bhaiyalals mother.

 Nanu said she had overheard Bhaiyalal and his friend Diyalal alias Mahendra discuss plans to buy petrol.

 I remember wondering at the time why they needed to buy petrol ? they didnt own vehicles, she sobbed. When she asked them, she was sternly told to keep her mouth shut and not to meddle in others affairs.

 Last evening, when I was watching TV around 8, I learnt they had bought some petrol. But how would I have known what they had planned?

 Half an hour after midnight, Nanu was woken up by a commotion. I ran out. It was my cousin, Bhaiyalal. Our house was in flames, and he was slipping away in the night.

 We are looking for Bhaiyalal and an accomplice, said Allahabad range inspector-general A.C. Sharma. He said the killers had locked the house from outside. 

 Everybody could hear the victims cries but none dared come close as a huge ball of fire had engulfed the house.

 Inspector Rajesh Chowrasia, officer-in-charge of the local police station, said Nanus statement had been recorded.

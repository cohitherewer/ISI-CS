 Actors poll debut spoils Jaya show

 Vijayakant and Jayalalithaa 

 Chennai, May 15: A flash in the pan or first steps to a new front?

 That is the buzz in Tamil Nadus political circles as the Assembly poll results reveal how actor-turned-politician Vijayakants fledgling party spoiled the show for the ADMK-led front in at least 43 constituencies.

 Analysts say if the newly-floated Desiya Murpokku Dravida Kazhagam (DMDK) hadnt contested, Jayalalithaas ADMK and its allies, the MDMK and the Dalit Panthers of India (DPI), might have fared much better in these 43 seats.

 Maybe, the analysts say, they could have even ended up near the 118 majority mark in the 234-member House instead of their final tally of 69, of which the ADMK won 61, the MDMK 6 and the DPI 2.

 From Harbour, a constituency in Chennai city, to 42 others spread across the state, the results show Vijayakants outfit polled between a minimum of 4,080 votes (in Tirunelveli) to a maximum of 35,684 in Sayamanallur near Madurai. In all these segments, the ADMK and its allies have lost directly to the DMK, as Vijayakants DMDK cut more into their votes than that of their main rivals.

 Although the DMDK, which contested 232 seats, joined the fray late, sources here said the actors fan club network in all the districts reached his partys symbol to voters in just three days.

 The sources also said that apart from his fans, who call him Karuppu MGR or dark-complexioned MGR, many first-time voters plumped for Vijayakant ? either for his bold move to take on the big two Dravidian parties or because they were looking for an alternative.

 Several marginal sections, including those in some segments reserved for Dalits, also voted for Vijayakants party, the sources added.

 But Vijayakants outfit hasnt only spoiled the chances of the ADMK-led front or set other parties like the BJP thinking in Tamil Nadu. Observers said it has also put into shade another film star-led party, the state unit of the All India Forward Bloc headed by actor M. Karthik.

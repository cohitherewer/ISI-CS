The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Mr Clean chants nation first 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 25: The most they say about the man is that he is scrupulously clean. On day one in his chair in the defence ministers office in Room 103 of South Block, Arackaparambil Kurian Antony has let it be known that he will tailor his work to the demands of a transparent democracy.

 I will do everything in the national interest, Antony said shortly after taking charge. 

 Asked if he was going to move against the involvement of middlemen in defence deals, he said: We are living in a democracy, that too a transparent democracy. Every action of a public person politician, official or parliamentarian is scanned by the people. That fact everyone should be aware of.

 But Antony will seek to temper his remarks on military matters. This (the defence ministry) is a big responsibility. I have had only one brief discussion with the defence secretary (Shekhar Dutt) last evening. This is a ministry in which you cannot over-react. First you have to know the facts. I cannot start reacting on the basis of every brief discussion. I need a more detailed briefing and then only I will react on policy matters, he said.

 The former Kerala chief minister a disciple of godwoman Amma brings with him a reputation of being a man of few words. He has headed the state government thrice not once did he complete a full term of five years. The administrative tasks he set out to do were left unfinished.

 Antony takes the seat when the defence ministry calls for tough and quick decision-making on acquisitions worth billions of dollars.

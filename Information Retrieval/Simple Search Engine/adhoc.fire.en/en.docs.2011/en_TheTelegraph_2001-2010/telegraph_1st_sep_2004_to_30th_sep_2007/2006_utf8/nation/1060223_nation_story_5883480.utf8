 Bofors row

 New Delhi, Feb. 22: The Opposition BJP regained its spirits for the first time in Parliament today as even the Left joined its offensive against the governments decision to allow Ottavio Quattrocchi access to his bank accounts in London.

 BJP deputy leader in the Lok Sabha Vijay Kumar Malhotra asked: Is Sonia Gandhi the Queen of India that we cant even mention her name in Parliament without the Congress going to pieces? Malhotra was responding to the Congresss hysterical reaction to L.K. Advanis reference to Quattrocchi as a friend of Sonia Gandhis family.

 The Lok Sabha was adjourned twice as the Opposition demanded a statement from Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on the Bofors controversy. The Left also sought an explanation from the government but did not join the BJP in a walkout.

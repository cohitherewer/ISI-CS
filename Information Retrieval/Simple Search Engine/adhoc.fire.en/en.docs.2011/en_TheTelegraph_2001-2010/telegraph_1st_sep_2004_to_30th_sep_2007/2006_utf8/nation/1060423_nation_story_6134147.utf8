The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Pramod, the flamboyant

 POORNIMA JOSHI

 Pramod Mahajan

 New Delhi, April 22: The political class is in shock. Those who stayed behind in Delhi chanted hymns; others rushed to Hinduja hospital where Pramod Mahajan was battling death.

 He is still critical, mumbled a shocked L.K. Advani. Atal Bihari Vajpayee rang up Pramods wife Rekha. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh wrote to her wishing Pramod a speedy recovery, while Sonia Gandhi expressed shock. 

 Every BJP unit in the country has been instructed to perform Mahamrityunjay Yagna to ward off danger to Pramods life.

 As the shell-shocked BJP struggled to come to terms with the attack, many leaders could not help but point out that the only person who would not have been overwhelmed by the event is the flamboyant Pramod himself.

 It was to him the party normally turned to on any occasion of such enormity. It was Pramod who hunted for medical help in rural Bihar after Ravi Shankar Prasad was shot at during an election rally in October last year.

 We rushed into a clinic that looked more like a barbers shop, Pramod had told this reporter. Ravi was fainting. There was no time to waste. This doctor still hemmed and hawed till I yelled and told him to get on with the job.

 That was Pramod in his elements ? flashy, over the top, utterly effective and never far from scandals.

 Party workers lay bets that the only person capable of calmly deciphering and managing todays unreal events is Pramod himself. There is also the unreasonable belief that Pramod alone has the ability to surface not entirely unscathed but unfazed this time, too, as he did on so many earlier occasions.

 How many politicians in India can claim to have emerged out of a scandal like the one that followed journalist Shivani Bhatnagars murder? Pramod was named, in full glare of TV cameras, as a suspect by the wife of the prime accused, R.K. Sharma. Pramod remained a Union minister during and after her outburst.

 Neither the scandal nor the allegation of ushering in the much-derided five-star culture into the BJP really distressed Pramod. Much as the RSS blamed him for the Congressisation of the BJP, the Maharashtrian had roots deep enough in the Sangh not to let the criticism wither him.

 He was attacked for the India Shining campaign and blamed for the BJPs Lok Sabha defeat in the 2004 elections. 

 But he was resurrected in just about a year, overseeing the partys silver jubilee celebrations and organising elections in Assam, the only crucial state for the BJP in the current round of Assembly elections.

 After Advanis ouster as BJP chief, Pramod gauged which way the wind was blowing in the party. The way he organised the Mumbai conclave in December 2005 bore the distinct mark of the Sanghs influence. Gone were the infamous five-star arrangements. The workers slept in tents and leaders occupied a rundown hotel near the Bandra reclamation ground.

 Pramod sat under tacky tents day after day and supervised each detail. In between, he found time to recount his life ? carefully omitting the more controversial details ? to this correspondent. People are shocked when they first come to my house, he said. Is this your house? How can it be so simple, they ask me. Everyone has a very different idea of my lifestyle.

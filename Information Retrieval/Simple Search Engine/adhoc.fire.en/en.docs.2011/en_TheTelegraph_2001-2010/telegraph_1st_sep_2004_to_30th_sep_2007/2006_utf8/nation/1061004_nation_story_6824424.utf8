The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Bandh to log out IT hub

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 The Infosys office in Bangalore

 Bangalore, Oct. 3: Its shut-down time tomorrow for the BPO and the IT industry in the city.

 The ruling JDS-BJP coalition has announced that it would provide indirect support to a state bandh called by activists to protest the Centres decision to withdraw its affidavit before the Supreme Court in the tussle over Belgaum.

 The affidavit had said Maharashtras petition seeking transfer of Marathi-speaking areas of Belgaum and other districts was not maintainable. So the move to withdraw the affidavit is being seen as a plan to placate Maharashtra MLAs.

 The Mahajan Commission, which went into the issue, said Belgaum and other Marathi-speaking areas were a part of Karnataka. Both sides accepted the panels recommendations, but the issue has been allegedly kept alive by Maharashtra politicians.

 More than 600 associations all over the state have called tomorrows bandh, which is expected to paralyse normal life. While interactive BPOs have decided to shift operations, non-voice BPOs and the IT industry are not taking any chances and have decided to log off.

 Any bandh call brings back memories of the violence after Kannada matinee idol Rajkumar died. The violence forced industry to shut down for two days.

 The non-voice BPOs have decided to remain closed tomorrow and instead work on Saturday or Sunday. We will treat it as pending work and give employees the option of coming in on one of the days this weekend to complete their work, Anand Parthasarathy, who is attached with a leading BPO, told The Telegraph.

 Those hit hard are call centres whose operations will have to be shifted for the day to elsewhere in the country. Arrangements are already being put in place. But smaller BPOs have a problem as they do not have more than one facility to temporarily shift work.

 We are planning to introduce a 24-hour shift starting Tuesday night and they will be relieved by those coming in on Wednesday night, a call centre vice-president added.

 The bandh is scheduled from 6 am to 6 pm.

 IT companies have decided to shut down operations completely as a good percentage of their employees are women. It is unsafe for them to travel in cabs or company buses as they have to travel at least 2-25 km to work, an IT majors representative said.

 Infosys, Wipro and other software majors have decided to declare a holiday. We will be working on a compensatory Saturday two weeks from now, Kaavya Kasturirangan of Infosys said.

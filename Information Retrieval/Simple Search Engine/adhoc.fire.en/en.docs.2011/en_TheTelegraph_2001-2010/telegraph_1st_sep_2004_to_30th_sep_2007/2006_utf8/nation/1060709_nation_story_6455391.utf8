 Birthday boy steals getaway to Goa 

 - recharging, ysr style

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Taking a break

 Hyderabad, July 8: N. Chandrababu Naidu used to be known as the CEO of Andhra Pradesh, but in some ways his successor is a more modern corporate chieftain in his practices than he was.

 Take, for instance, how Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy spends his birthdays. Reddy is in Goa today celebrating his 57th birthday.

 Or how he takes his weekends off and tells his officers to spend more time with their families.

 Reddy also takes time out for picnics and visits a farmhouse near Hyderabad for what he calls fresh air. His cabinet colleagues make fun of his ways, but the chief minister says such weekends give him the energy to beat the strain of being in the hot seat.

 I believe in the western lifestyle, he told them once. Work while you work and play while you play.

 In the YSR regime, the chief secretary or police officers do not ring his doorbell early in the morning. If its something important, they speak to him over teleconference.

 Thank god he is not an NTR who expected officials to be at his doorstep at 5.30 am, chief secretary T.K. Dewan once said.

 Reddy left for Goa yesterday, accompanied by family and friends. I am going to pray for the well-being of the people of Andhra Pradesh and prosperity for all, he told a news channel before boarding the plane.

 The regular cabinet meeting was hurried up so that he could reach the airport on time, while party workers and dignitaries made a beeline to his chamber since morning to wish him happy birthday in advance.

 Last year, Reddy, a religious-minded Christian, visited Jerusalem and Bethlehem and several ancient churches in Rome. He also met the new Pope, Benedict XVI.

 In 2004, Reddy spent his birthday in Pulivendla, his native village in Kadapa district. That was his second month in power after the victory in the May 2004 Assembly polls.

 The family man that he is, Reddy dotes on his mother Jayamma, wife Vijayalakshmi and daughter Sharmlee. All of them and his son Jagan have accompanied him to Goa, where the chief minister is scheduled to spend two days before taking the plane back to Hyderabad on Monday.

 In a recent interview, Reddy said he does not hide anything from his family. And his daughter has always been his source of strength. She boosted my confidence in times of crisis and also supported me, he says. 

 In fact, till the new official residence of the chief minister was built to his taste in Begumpet, Reddy stayed in his daughters house in Banjara Hills.

 His own house ? Sree Bagh, on Road No. 2, Banjara Hills ? has been demolished and a shopping complex is being built there. The Naidu government had refused to give him the land despite favourable court decisions.

 Reddy, who studied medicine, is also a keen football fan. A plasma TV at home has been keeping him posted on the latest World Cup news. I will not miss the finals on Sunday even in Goa, he told his aides who had offered to tape the France-Italy showdown.

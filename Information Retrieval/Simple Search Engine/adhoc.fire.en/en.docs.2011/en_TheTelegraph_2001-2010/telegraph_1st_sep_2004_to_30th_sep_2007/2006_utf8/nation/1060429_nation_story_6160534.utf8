 Teesta: Court move

 Ahmedabad, April 28: 

 Human rights activist Teesta Setalvad has decided to challenge 

 the appointment of tainted police officer P.C. 

 Pande as Gujarats director-general of police.

 Teesta is planning to move the Supreme Court, questioning Pandes appointment on the ground of his controversial role in the 2002 Gujarat riots.

 This person, who as Ahmedabad police commissioner during the 2002 riots was not able to protect the lives of people, has now been rewarded with the highest office. What kind of signal is the government trying to send to riot victims? Is there any hope, any future for the victims fighting for justice? asked Teesta.

 The Mumbai-based activist had earlier moved the apex court to challenge Pandes deputation to the CBI as additional director, following which he was shifted to the Indo-Tibetan Border Police.

 She was also instrumental in getting the Best Bakery case transferred to Mumbai for retrial.

 Pande, as Ahmedabad police commissioner, was blamed for allowing the massacre of over 120 people at Gulbarg Society and Naroda Patia in 2002. 

 Over 500 people were killed in the area under his jurisdiction during the riots.

 Survivors of the carnage have reacted strongly to Pandes latest appointment, terming it a big blow. 

 Nearly 2,000 riot-related cases are to be investigated. Can we expect a fair investigation? asked Naeed Sayyed.

 Roopa Modi, the only Parsi woman who lived in Gulbarg Society and lost her 13-year-old only son in the carnage, has also lost hope of justice.

 Tanvir Jafri, the son of Congress leader Ehsaan Jafri who was among 39 Gulbarg Society residents burnt alive by a mob on February 28, 2002, said: It (Pandes appointment) amounts to threatening riot victims. It is ironical that the police officer responsible for the massacre is today the top cop in the state and in a position to influence investigation.

 Citing the earlier apex court judgment on his deputation to the CBI, right activists said they will again move the court to challenge Pandes appointment.

 Rights activist Cedric Prakash described the appointment as a big let-down for those fighting for justice. The question we are asking is whether there is any hope and future for riot survivors, he said.

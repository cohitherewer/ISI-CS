 New Delhi, March 15: Delhi police today issued lookout notices against all the witnesses in the Jessica Lal murder case to prevent them from leaving the country.

 Lookout notices are issued against those wanted in criminal cases and sent to airports if there are apprehensions that they could leave the country.

 Yes, we have issued it, said special commissioner of police (intelligence) U.K. Katna, who is heading the investigating team set up by Delhi police commissioner K.K. Paul. 

 The team was formed on March 6 after a fresh FIR was registered demanding a probe into allegations of destruction of, tampering with and fabrication of evidence during investigations.

 Katna refused to divulge any details of those against whom the notices have been issued. He only said they were required for investigations.

 Socialite Bina Ramani, who owned the restaurant where Jessica was murdered in 1999, her Canadian husband Georges Mailhot and her fashion designer daughter Malini are believed to be on the list. While Bina has a British passport, her daughter holds a US passport. The Ramanis had allegedly washed the restaurant premises after the incident, thereby destroying evidence.

 According to police sources, notices have also been issued to all the nine accused, including Manu Sharma, the son of former Union minister Vinod Sharma, and co-accused Vikas Yadav, whose father D.P. Yadav is a former MP.

 The police are also on the lookout for actor Shayan Munshi, a key witness who had turned hostile, and the police officers who had investigated the case.

 After all the accused were acquitted by a trial court on February 21, Jessicas sister Sabrina had voiced concerns that Sharma might try to leave the country though the appeal in the case was yet to be filed.

 With the verdict triggering public outrage, Delhi police filed an appeal in the high court on Monday.

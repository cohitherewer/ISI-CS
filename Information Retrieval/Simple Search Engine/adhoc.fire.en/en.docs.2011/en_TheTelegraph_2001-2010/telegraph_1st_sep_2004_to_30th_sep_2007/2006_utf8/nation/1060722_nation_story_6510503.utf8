 Delhi rethink on Judum 

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi, July 21: The Centre today indicated that it would stop giving indirect support to Salwa Judum, the peoples resistance movement against Naxalites in Chhattisgarh.

 The government appears to be in favour of a long-term plan to replace the resistance movement, which has drawn criticism from several quarters for having led to the killing of many tribals in the past year.

 At a high-level meeting, the Union home ministry asked the Chhattisgarh government to come up with short-term and long-term action plans within a month.

 The tribal affairs ministry has also raised objections to using tribals in the fight against the rebels and called for an end to Salwa Judum.

 Releasing the draft national tribal policy today, tribal affairs minister P.R. Kyndiah attacked the strategy of Salwa Judum to counter insurgency in tribal areas, saying such unrest should not be treated as a mere policing problem.

 Arming the tribals to fight Naxalites should be stopped. The strategy of Salwa Judum is no answer to the problem. What happened in Chhattisgarh is very painful, Kyndiah said, calling for a rethink and relook on the issue.

 A week ago, Maoists attacked a camp in Dantewada district, housing mostly members of Salwa Judum, killing 31 people and injuring around 100.

 After the 90-minute meeting today, which was chaired by home minister Shivraj Patil, Chhattisgarh chief minister Raman Singh sought to downplay the differences between the Centre and his government on continuing with the resistance movement.

 Singh said Salwa Judum is a peoples movement and its work will be complete the day peace returns to Chhattisgarh.

 National security adviser M.K. Narayanan, Union home secretary V.K. Duggal, adviser to the Chhattisgarh government K.P.S. Gill, Chhattisgarh DGP .P. Rathore and senior officials of the Central Reserve Police Force and the Intelligence Bureau were also present at the meeting.

 Singh sought more central security forces to provide adequate protection to the relief camps, more mine-proof vehicles and funds for police modernisation.

 While the Centre agreed to provide two more CRPF battalions and more mine-proof vehicles and better technology for intelligence gathering, it questioned why the state needed funds for police modernisation without utilising the money provided to it earlier.

 Union home secretary Duggal said the Centre had assured help to Chhattisgarh in strengthening its intelligence machinery as the affected areas were vast, making surveillance an uphill task.

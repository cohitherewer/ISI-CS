 UK hunt for Husain vandals

 AMIT ROY

 London, May 27: Scotland Yard is hunting for three Indian thugs who entered Asia House, a high-profile cultural centre in London, and sprayed black paint on two of M.F. Husains works at an exhibition which then had to be closed for security reasons.

 Indian high commissioner Kamalesh Sharma, who inaugurated the exhibition earlier this month and spoke warmly about Indias greatest living artist, was in Edinburgh today and could not be reached for comment on the Indian governments official position.

 Diplomats indicated that Sharma, an art lover, is personally outraged that the thugs are claiming to act on behalf of an estimated one million British Hindus.

 In the current political climate when any form of religious extremism is equated with terrorism, the culprits, if caught and found to be Indian passport holders, face speedy deportation to India after a spell in jail. 

 In any case, anti-terrorist police are starting to keep tabs on known Hindu activists with financial and other links to political extremists in India.

 A source told The Telegraph: Three thugs entered Asia House on Saturday. There was no way of telling them from normal people. They entered the basement where M.F. Husains exhibition was being held and sprayed the painting called Durga with black paint. They defaced one other painting.

 The 26-inch-by-26-inch oil on canvas painting was done in 1964.

 The source added: Asia House is not saying anything at the moment. I have spoken to Husain who is very upset by what has happened. He is also fed up although he has learnt to take these things in his stride. This painting was done some 40 years ago. He celebrates the joy, the colour of life and has no intention of causing any offence to anyone.

 A demonstration by a small group of Hindus was due to have taken place outside Asia House today but has been called off since the exhibition, which was to have run till early August, was cancelled.

 Husain himself did not turn up at the preview ? he came the next day ? which was attended by senior members of Londons Indian community. It was opened by the Indian high commissioner who described how interest in Indian art was growing. India is rising everywhere but who would have thought Indian art would also rise, Sharma had said.

 The exhibition, M.F. Husain: Early Masterpieces 1950s-70s, included 16 of his works. We wanted to show his early works, which are his most significant, said Amrita Jhaveri, formerly of Christies and now a collector and consultant.

 Those who collected Husain several years ago made no secret of their acquisitions. Among those who have supported Husain over the decades are the Hinduja brothers, who are orthodox Hindus.

 Asia House, located in New Cavendish Street just behind Selfridges, calls itself one of the premier pan-Asian organisations in Britain, promoting a greater understanding of the rich and varied Asian cultures and economies. 

 It runs a lively programme of approximately 100 events annually, covering Asian economics, politics, visual and performing arts, literature, food, film and fashion.

 Its mission is to promote appreciation and understanding of Asian countries, their arts, religions and economies and to foster closer communication between the peoples of Asia and Europe.

 Asia House covers countries from Iran in the west to Japan in the east and from the Central Asian republics in the north to Indonesia in the south. 

 One woman, a Hindu, who attended the opening and who has Husains in her drawing room, said: I thought this collection was somewhat dull but there was certainly nothing offensive.

 Speaking tonight from New Delhi, Labour peer Lord Meghnad Desai, said when he returned home to London, he would press Scotland Yard vigorously to pursue the criminals. I am hoping I can persuade Asia House to reopen the exhibition. I intend doing something about this. This is a crime of vandalism and should be pursued through the courts.

 His wife, Kishwar, added: We are both incensed about this.

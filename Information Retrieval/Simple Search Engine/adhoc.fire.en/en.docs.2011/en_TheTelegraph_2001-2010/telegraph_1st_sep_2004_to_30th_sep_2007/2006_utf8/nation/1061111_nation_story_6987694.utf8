 Tahap (Pulwama), Nov. 10: Yesterday, Omar Maqbool Ganai passed his Class VIII examination. Today, he was buried in a local graveyard, not far from his school. 

 Omar is one of the five persons, all members of an extended family, who lost their lives in an attack on Abdul Rasheed Dawoodi, a leader of the Barelvi sect outside Markazi Jami Masjid here, about 45 km from Srinagar. 

 Over 30 others, including Dawoodi, were injured, some of them critically, in the attack carried out with the apparent motive of fanning sectarian clashes.

 His (Omars) father Maqbool came to my house this morning and asked for a set of books for his son, said Ghulam Hassan Wagay, Maqbools relative whose daughter has joined Class X. He was jubilant that his son has passed the exams.

 Omars grandfather, Ghulam Mohammad Ganai, said the family was celebrating his success. When Omar came with the result, we were all happy but now he is no more.

 My son is a private school teacher and was working hard to sustain his family. He was eager to give a good education to his son but his dreams are shattered, Ganai added.

 H.K. Lohia, the DIG of south Kashmir, blamed the Hizb-ul Mujahideen. They (victims) belong to the Barelvi school of thought who are not liked by Hizb, he said. We suspect the hand of a local Hizb militant.

 Hizb has condemned the attack and blamed Indian agencies, accusing them of trying to trigger sectarian strife.

 In this otherwise sleepy village, every family is in mourning. Wailing women and speechless men dot the roads and the narrow bylanes, all discussing in whispers the motive for the attack.

 The incident occurred when Dawoodi, the leader of Tehreek-e-Soutul Awliya (the movement for propagating the voice of Sufi saints), was leaving Ganais house to address a Friday gathering in an adjoining mosque.

 Several dozen people, including children, mostly from Ganais extended family, accompanied Dawoodi. As they reached the lane outside the mosque, a grenade was lobbed at them.

 Ganai lost his son Nissar, grandson Omar and granddaughter Bismah. I do not know who did this and why, he said. 

 Ganai is the only person in his house who has not lost his senses. Every time someone shrieks, Ganai consoles them. 

 All those (dead) lying on a stretcher outside belong to our family. Oh God what have you done to us, screamed Shafi, one of Ganias sons. 

 Do not weep. So many people have died here. Perhaps, this will bring azadi, mocked the father.

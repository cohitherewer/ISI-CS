 P.V. Narasimha Rao: No nominees

 Hyderabad, April 1: P.V. Narasimha Rao is dead but his money has been growing.

 At last count, the former Prime Minister had a little less than Rs 1.4 lakh in fixed deposits.

 Any claimants? None ? Rao didnt name a nominee.

 Oversight? Maybe. Or it could be that Rao, as famous for his pout as his penchant for perceived indecisiveness, forgot to make up his mind whom to leave behind the assets he had deposited in the Mulkanoor rural cooperative bank.

 Rao was vice-president of the bank for six years till 1962 when he became a legislator.

 A. Praveen Reddy, the current president of the bank, said Rs.1.38 lakh has accrued in the late leaders name against his deposits and in interests.

 Asked why the amount was not handed over to Raos family, the bank president had earlier said rules forbid us to hand over (the assets) to anyone other than the nominee mentioned by the depositor. In Raos case, he hadnt even mentioned as nominee his wife Satyavatamma, who died before him.

 However, the banks governing body recently authorised payment of the money to any one family member, preferably the elder son. P.V. Narasimha Rao contributed a lot for the development of the bank and we are all grateful to him and his leadership, the banks president said.

 Despite the authorisation, none of Raos sons has come forward. Although we have written to the family members to come and accept the amount accrued to P.V. Narasimha Raos account, none of them has so far, Reddy said.

 Nor has anyone from the family claimed documents for 9.74 acres that Rao owned in Vangara, his native village in Karimnagar district, Reddy added.

 While Raos money lies unclaimed, a memorial the Andhra Pradesh government has planned for the late leader on the banks of Hyderabads Hussainsagar lake is yet to take shape.

 The land has been allotted but work hasnt started yet.

 Failed-test choppers on buy list

 SUJAN DUTTA

 The army is set to issue an order for 197 helicopters 

to either Eurocopter (top) or Bell though their flying machines failed tests in 

Siachen.

New Delhi, June 15: The army is set to issue an order worth hundreds of millions of dollars for 197 helicopters to one of two military majors despite their flying machines failing tests in Siachen, the main operational area for which the need has been projected.

 An important but little-publicised feature of the Siachen conflict ? the entire Kargil sector since the 1999 war ? is the business it can generate for military-industrial entities. 

 Should the India-Pakistan talks to militarily disengage in the heights succeed, the need for such flying machines will diminish.

 The Cabinet Committee on Security will shortly decide on the acquisition of either the US-aviation company Bell Textrons Bell 407 Shen or the EADS Eurocopter AS 350 B3 Ecureil. The cost of the helicopters is likely to be upwards of $600 million.

 An official involved in the evaluation said the machines had underperformed in trials for quick take-offs after landing on small snowbound helipads at high altitude.

 But both Bell and Eurocopter have landed their machines near Mount Everest and at another peak in the Nepal Himalayas to demonstrate their high-altitude capabilities.

 At Siachen, trials were conducted by both the Army Aviation Corps and the 114 Helicopter Unit of the Indian Air Force.

 The 114HU ? also called The Siachen Pioneers ? that flies small two-seater Cheetah helicopters is at the centre of air maintenance operations in the zone.

 Among the trials was a test for super-quick landings and take-offs. Some helipads in the zone are little more than a canvas-sheet over a 6ft by 6ft bed of snow. Pilots describe them as stamp-sized. The Cheetah ? the lightest helicopter in use ? barely has more than 30 seconds in which to land and take off.

 The turnaround time is at most 40 seconds. But pilots of the Cheetahs who tried out the Bell and the Eurocopter choppers reported less-than-satisfactory performance.

 The Bell 407 and the AS 350 B3 were being evaluated because the Army Aviation Corps entire fleet is to be replaced. The corps of about 12 squadrons (about 180 choppers) currently flies mostly outdated Chetak and Cheetah helicopters. 

 Hindustan Aeronautics Limited is now closing down the production lines.

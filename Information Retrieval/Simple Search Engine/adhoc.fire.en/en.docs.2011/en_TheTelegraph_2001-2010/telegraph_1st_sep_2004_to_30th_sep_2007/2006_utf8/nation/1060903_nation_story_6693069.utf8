 Airlines to raise rates to offset fuel costs

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT AND PTI

 New Delhi, Sept. 2: Jet Airways and Spicejet are planning to hike fuel surcharge by Rs 100 per ticket from September 5.

 Most other airlines, including the state-run Indian, will be following suit.

 State-run oil companies raised jet fuel prices by 4 per cent yesterday.

 A spokesman for Indian said: We will consider increasing prices and will hold a meeting soon to work out the details.

 Air Deccan said it would raise the surcharge from September 22 on all sectors operated by its airbus and turboprop ATR aircraft fleet, a spokesperson for the airline said.

 The revised fuel surcharge would be effective on all classes of travel but would not be applicable to tickets sold on or before September 4. However, the increased surcharge would be applicable if tickets are presented for any voluntary change on or after September 5.

 This will be the third hike in three months and the fourth this year. 

 In the last three months, the fuel surcharge has soared from Rs 300 to Rs 500 and then to Rs 650, which is now being hiked to Rs 750.

 Most airlines have seen their profits plummet in recent months, partly because of rising fuel costs.

 Domestic airlines have a grouse that the price of jet fuel in the country is among the highest in the world and it raises their cost of operation. The high price is because of the high excise and sales tax on the fuel.

 With the festive season starting, this is also traditionally the time when airlines start raising fares as traffic starts picking up. 

 A Sahara executive said: Fares could go up further in winter as most airlines are suffering from eroded profits and higher overhead costs.

 The oil companies have gone in for a price hike this month to bring domestic prices in line with rising international prices. 

 The increase in jet fuel price ranges from Rs 1,622 to Rs 1,918 per kilolitre (kl) in the four metros depending on the sales tax.

 The price of aviation turbine fuel in Calcutta has been increased for domestic airlines by Rs 1,918 per kl from Rs 47,691.07 per kl to Rs 49,609.80 per kl.

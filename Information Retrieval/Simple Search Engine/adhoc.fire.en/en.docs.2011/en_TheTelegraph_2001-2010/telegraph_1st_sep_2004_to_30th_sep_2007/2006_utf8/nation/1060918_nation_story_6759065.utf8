 Soldier on killing spree after quarrel

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Srinagar, Sept. 17: A soldier gunned down a non-commissioned officer and a trooper at an army camp near the Line of Control last night, adding to the growing list of fragging in frontier postings.

 Police said the soldier went berserk after a quarrel with his colleagues at the camp in Tangdhar sector, north Kashmir.

 He opened indiscriminate fire resulting in the death of a non-commissioned officer and a soldier, a police officer said.

 Two others were critically wounded in the shooting before the angry soldier was overpowered.

 Three days earlier, a soldier had shot a major dead inside an army camp in Rajouri, Jammu, after being denied leave.

 The army brass is worried at the increase in fragging which refers to a soldier killing or trying to kill an officer.

 These incidents happen mostly among soldiers who have been fighting militants in Jammu and Kashmir or the Northeast for a long time. 

 Stressed out by the relentless pressure and the long separation from their families, they often crack, especially when denied leave.

 Violence within troops has, on an average, been reported every 13th day for the last three years. Between 2002 and 2005, a soldier committed suicide almost every fifth day.

 The army has hired counsellors and psycho-analysts to fight the problem and arranged for recreation centres for the troops.

 The defence spokesman here confirmed the latest incident but said: It was the result of negligent handling of weapon by the trooper and action has been initiated in the matter.

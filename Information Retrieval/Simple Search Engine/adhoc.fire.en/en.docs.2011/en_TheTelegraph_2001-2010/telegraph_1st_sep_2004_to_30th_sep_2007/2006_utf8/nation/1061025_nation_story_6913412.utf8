 Srinagar, Oct. 24: Anger spilled onto Srinagars streets on the eve of Id after a police vehicle ran over two men on a motorcycle, sparking massive protests and partial shutdowns.

 Ali Mohammad and his 22-year-old son Imtiyaz, both government employees, were on their way to office when the Gypsy knocked them down. While Mohammad died on the spot, his son was rushed to the nearby Bone and Joint hospital, where he succumbed to injuries.

 The mourning that followed the accident overshadowed preparations for Id in their Kuthpora Chadroo locality with thousands pouring in to share the familys grief. Kashmir celebrates Id on Wednesday.

 The family of my uncle has been devastated, said Khursheed Ahmad. They had prepared the delicacies for the special meal tomorrow and were looking to celebrate Id. But look what happened. Mohammad is survived by his wife and a 14-year-old son. 

 Farooq Ahmad, the deputy inspector-general of police, said the driver who ran over the duo, Tejinder Singh, has been arrested. Promising action against him, Khan said: This was an unfortunate incident.

 Protesters fought pitched battles with the police. Around a dozen people, including some policemen, were injured. Angry mobs set ablaze a police vehicle and damaged another.

 People said rash driving was to blame for the deaths. After hitting them, the policemen lifted the victims and dragged them towards their vehicle. This infuriated us, said Muneer Ahmad, an eyewitness. They even misbehaved with a woman who was asking them to be polite. 

 A large number of people gathered at the scene and chased away the policemen. People staged a dharna on the main road with the bodies. Police had to open fire in the air and lob tear-gas shells to disperse the mob. Many markets downed shutters in protest.

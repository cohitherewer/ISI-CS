 Reddy tops CMs class

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN 

 New Delhi, Sept. 22: A day before Congress chief ministers give an account of their governments performance to Sonia Gandhi and Manmohan Singh at a conclave in Nainital, the Prime Minister started a mid-year review of the Centres social initiatives to check how the states are doing. 

 Sources close to Singh said an early prognosis was that among the chief ministers, Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy of Andhra Pradesh topped the charts while Vilasrao Deshmukh and Tarun Gogoi of Maharashtra and Assam were at the bottom of the heap. The host of the Nainital conference, Narain Dutt Tiwari, was labelled so-so.

 The Andhra government is being seen as the most efficient user of the money released under the Access Irrigation Development Fund. While a charitable explanation for Assams non-performance was that Gogoi has been preoccupied with the Assembly polls, no such brief was held for Deshmukh.

 On Tuesday, when the Prime Minister reviewed one of the jewels of his government, the Bharat Nirman project, for two hours, he found that all Congress-ruled states, barring Uttaranchal, had attained the targets set by the Centre for this year in the infrastructure sectors.

 The Opposition-governed Jharkhand, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Orissa, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan lagged behind. And for no fault of the Centre, the sources stressed. 

 In his speech in Nainital, Singh is expected to emphasise that the onus of implementation of programmes is on the states. The other points he will harp on are that in the non-Congress states, party workers should start an awareness campaign on how much funds the Centre has released for each programme and how they are being spent, if at all. 

 If the Opposition seems like stealing the credit, the Prime Ministers message will be that it should be stopped on the tracks and the focus should be deflected to the Congress and his government.

 The sources objected to the comparison of Singhs concept of awareness campaign with the NDAs India Shining campaign and maintained that there was no propaganda in it.

 Singh has reportedly decided to devote two weeks to reviewing his governments social projects. Depending on the outcome, he is likely to announce new initiatives keeping in mind that three Congress states Punjab, Manipur and Uttaranchal go to polls early next year and a little over two years are left for Lok Sabha polls.

 On Wednesday, he spent time going through the Rural Health Care Mission. Among the flaws he detected were the lack of ASHAs (accredited social health activists). The mission envisages one ASHA for every 1,000 population and one per habitation in hilly and tribal areas.

 Today, the Prime Minister scanned the Vocational Educational Mission. Next week, he will look at other flagship programmes such as the National Rural Employment Guarantee Programme, Sarva Siksha Abhiyaan and the Urban Renewal Mission.

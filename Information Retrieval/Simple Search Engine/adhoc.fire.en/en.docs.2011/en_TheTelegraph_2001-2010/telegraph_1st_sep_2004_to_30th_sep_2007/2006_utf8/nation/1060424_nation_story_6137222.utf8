 SC notice on IAF pilots plea

 New Delhi (PTI): The Supreme Court has asked the Centre to explain why an Indian Air Force pilot should not be permitted to take premature retirement on full reimbursement of the money spent by the government on his training.

 The court issued a notice to the Centre on a petition by Squadron Leader Shakul Tyagi challenging the January 14 order of Delhi High Court. The high court had held that the pilot, on whose training the state spent crores of rupees, could not seek retirement on the ground that the job was affecting his marital life.

 Tyagi has challenged the high court verdict on the ground that the present policy of premature retirement, because of its selective application, has resulted in discrimination and hence was violative of Article 14 (right to equality) of the Constitution.

 He had moved the high court after the air force rejected his plea for premature retirement, terming it as an alibi to join the private airline industry.

 Indian human trafficker held

Durban (PTI): An Indian, alleged to be the kingpin of a human 

trafficking racket, has been arrested.

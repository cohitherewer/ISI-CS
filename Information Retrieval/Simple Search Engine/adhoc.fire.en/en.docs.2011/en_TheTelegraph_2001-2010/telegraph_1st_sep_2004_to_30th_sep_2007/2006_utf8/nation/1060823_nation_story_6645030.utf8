 Cancer drug test case

 G.S. MUDUR 

 New Delhi, Aug. 22: Surabhi Kakar is worried whether a lifeline that Parliament had thrown to hundreds of patients across India with blood cancer might vanish through a court case that comes up for hearing tomorrow.

 The Cancer Patients Aid Association (CPAA) is preparing for a legal battle against pharmaceutical giant Novartis that has challenged the rejection of its patent application on an anti-cancer drug called Gleevec by the Indian patent office earlier this year.

 The case will be heard in Chennai High Court tomorrow.

 The company has also challenged an amendment to the Indian patent law by Parliament last year that is aimed at preventing drug companies from obtaining patents on new forms of known substances.

 Indian companies are producing relatively inexpensive generic versions of this anti-cancer drug imatinib myselate used in the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia. Patients fear if Novartis wins the patent, there will be no generic versions.

 The generic products cost about Rs 10,500 a month, but the drug from Novartis costs nearly Rs 1,20,000 a month, said Kakar, an official with the Indian Cancer Society that supports cancer treatment through private donations.

 Right now, we have an eight-year-old boy and a 16-year-old girl using the generic products. They need treatment for at least a year. We wont be able to afford the medicine if the cost leaps to Rs 1,20,000, Kakar said.

 Novartis has said Gleevec is its original research product and it takes between $500 million and $80 million to discover a new medicine. Original products are, therefore, always more expensive. The company has also claimed it has been making available the product free to patients who need the drug and are not insured or are not reimbursed, and have no financial recourse.

 In January this year, the Chennai patent office had rejected the patent application of Novartis on the ground that it claimed only a new form of an old drug. The ruling by the patent office had been widely hailed by patient groups.

 But in May this year, Novartis filed two cases against the government one challenging the rejection of its patent application, and the other against amendments to the Indian patent law that was used by the Chennai patent office.

 This has become a test case, said K. Madhavan Gopakumar with the Centre for Trade and Development in New Delhi. The amendment to prevent patents on new forms of known substances was a key safeguard enacted by Indian parliamentarians to avoid frivolous patents from being granted, he said.

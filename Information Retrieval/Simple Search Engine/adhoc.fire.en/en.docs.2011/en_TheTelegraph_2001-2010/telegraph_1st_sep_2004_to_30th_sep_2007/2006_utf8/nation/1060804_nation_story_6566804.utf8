 Natwar blow to Cong, boon for BJP

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 3: Exit Jaswant Singh and enter Natwar Singh in Parliament? 

 The submission of the Pathak committee report has prompted the ruling Congress as well as the Opposition BJP to rework their strategies for the rest of the monsoon session, which has so far been dominated by the controversy over Jaswant and the mole.

 For the BJP, the Pathak report could not have come at a more opportune time. The party, struggling to defend Jaswant, has now been handed an issue that could deflect attention from the mole storm.

 However, for the Congress on a high after making the CPM climb down on its plan to move a resolution on the nuclear deal and the BJP cower in embarrassment over Jaswant the timing could not have been worse.

 The Congress, which was readying to sharpen the knives on the BJP and Jaswant on the Kandahar hijack, may have to retreat a bit, party sources admitted.

 Soon after the purported contents of the report on the oil-for-food scandal were leaked, Natwar suggested he would not let the clean chit to his party go unchallenged.

 The only aspersion against me and my son is that we misused our position. At that time I was neither a minister nor an MP nor my son was an MLA. How does the question of misusing of our position arise?

 How can, therefore, any aspersion be cast on me and the Congress given a clean chit?

 The BJP had already flung the same question: how come the Pathak commission let the Congress off the hook without most of its senior leaders (barring treasurer Motilal Vora) being interrogated? 

 Late this evening, Congress president Sonia Gandhi went into a huddle with general secretary Janaradhan Dwivedi and Vora at her residence.

 The sources said the meeting was convened to devise a strategy to cope with the Opposition flak the party is certain to face in and outside Parliament. Natwar would be served a showcause notice shortly, one of the sources said.

 Other responses would include a further investigation by the Enforcement Directorate based on the conclusions of the Pathak committee report and placing an action taken report in Parliament.

 Under the rules, the government is not bound to table the Pathak report in Parliament because the decision to probe the charges was taken by the executive. But given the perception that the BJP would go to any length to deflect attention from its internal disorder, the Congress might try to defuse the situation by tabling the action taken report.

 Privately, the Congress was delighted at the commissions reported suggestion that Natwar had misused his position.

 Questions were asked on why he missed no chance to embarrass Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on foreign policy issues, particularly the nuclear deal. 

 Natwar had teamed up with the CPM, the BJP and the Samajwadi Party to press for a collective parliamentary resolution on the deal. The Congress suspected that Natwar was exerting pressure to wangle a clean chit and return to the cabinet.

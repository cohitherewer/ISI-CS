 Wanted, teachers who dont bunk

 Washington, March 28: Almost 42 per cent of teachers in government-run primary schools in Jharkhand and nearly 38 per cent in Bihar are missing from classrooms, according to an inspection report by the World Bank.

 The national average for absenteeism in government-run primary schools is 25 per cent, the report prepared by the bank in association with Harvard University says.

 Governments and donors may construct school buildings and supply textbooks, but if teachers are repeatedly absent, students are unlikely to learn, according to Halsey Rogers, a senior economist in the World Banks Development Research Group, one of the authors of the report.

 The study covered 20 Indian states and focused on 3,700 schools. Investigators made three unannounced visits to each of these government-run institutions before concluding that their teachers were chronically absent.

 The study is a continuing project, the earliest findings of which were released in 2004.

 But little has changed since and an expanded version of the report is to be made public in summer, Rogers, who participated in an online chat at the World Bank on the issue today, said.

 Curiously, the study found that it was often the higher-paid teachers who absconded from the classrooms.

 Rogers says, therefore, that raising salaries alone may not reduce absenteeism. But the study concluded that a better work environment in school could lower the absence rate.

 We found a clear association between better infrastructure and lower absence. If the facilities are better ? if they have, for example, functioning toilets and a roof ? they are going to be more enthusiastic about going to work and working in those better conditions.

 Notwithstanding the 25 per cent teacher absentee figure, the investigators established only one instance in which a supervisor had dismissed a teacher for repeated absence.

 State government officials told those conducting the study that they could not inspect institutions because high crime rates made inspections dangerous and there were no funds for petrol for teams to go on such inspection tours.

 Maharashtra, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh had relatively low rates of absconding teachers, but the 100 per cent literate state of Kerala had an abnormally high figure of 21.2 per cent. The prosperous state of Punjab reported 34.4 per cent.

 The World Bank is in the process of bringing out a similar study on absenteeism by doctors in the public health system.

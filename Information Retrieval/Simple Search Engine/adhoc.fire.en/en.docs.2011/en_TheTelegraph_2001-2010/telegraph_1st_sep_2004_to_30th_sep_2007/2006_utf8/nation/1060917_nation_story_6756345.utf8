 Coke questions court powers

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 16: The Supreme Court today heard the familiar complaint about courts meddling in the affairs of governments or legislatures, but it came from an unlikely quarter a cola major.

 Coca-Cola, fighting allegations that its products contain high levels of pesticide, argued that it lay beyond the apex courts powers to regulate soft drink contents or prescribe safety standards.

 It was for the legislature and the executive to draw up and enforce such rules, the multinational said, responding to a public interest litigation that sought a committee of experts to judge the harmful effects of soft drinks on health.

 The company said the petition which also seeks a regulatory regime, disclosure of the contents on the label and a check on allegedly misleading advertisements was not maintainable.

 None of these functions are envisaged by the Constitution as judicial functions, Coca-Cola argued. In the guise of redressing a public grievance, (such a move) encroaches upon the sphere reserved by the Constitution for the executive and the legislature.

 The company added that the petition didnt contain any evidence that the executive or the legislature had abdicated their responsibility.

 In these circumstances, it is respectfully submitted that the interference of this honble court would be entirely unwarranted and contrary to the constitutional scheme.

 In the absence of a rigid separation of powers under the Constitution, governments and legislatures have earlier accused the judiciary of encroaching on their domain.

 Coca-Cola said it was the Centres job to make sure that food and beverage safety standards, as well as disclosure requirements, were in keeping with the countrys obligations under international agreements like the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade and the Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phyto-sanitary Measures. 

 It mentioned that the petitioner had also failed to discuss in detail the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, which has already laid down norms on content and disclosure, and banned misleading advertisements.

 The NGO petitioner, the Centre for Public Interest Litigation, had also failed to mention that the government was coming up with a law the Food Safety and Standards Act on the subject, the company said.

 Coca-Cola told the court that it followed the same procedures for cleaning and purifying all its ingredients everywhere in the world.

 PepsiCo, which too had been directed by the court to file a response, said in its affidavit that the allegations were baseless and merely based on Internet downloads.

 It said the company had never targeted children through its advertisements and that it was incorrect to claim that soft drinks made a person obese.

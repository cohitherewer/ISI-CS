 All eyes fixed on Rahul

 April 30: As disquiet in the UPA government and the ruling Congress becomes somewhat more vocal, Rahul Gandhi is being seen as a final arbitrator.

 Rahuls recent statement that he is ready to take up greater responsibility assumes significance in this context.

 It is an open secret that Rahul and sister Priyanka are Congress president Sonia Gandhis most trusted and permanent political advisers. Therefore, their support is crucial for the ever-changing political equations in the Delhi durbar.

 Since Rahul is a more public face than Priyanka, the 36-year-old holding an M. Phil in developmental economics from Cambridge has become the most sought-after leader in the party.

 The Prime Ministers camp is increasingly looking to the GeNext Gandhi for support to his thrust on reforms and geopolitical strides like the Indo-US treaty.

 The old guard, too, is counting on him. Leaders like Arjun Singh, M.L. Fotedar, Narain Dutt Tiwari, Sheila Dikshit and others feel duty-bound to apprise him about the primacy of socio-political programmes to strengthen the Congresss mass base.

 The truth is that unlike Sonia, both camps do not enjoy proximity to Rahul.

 Congress insiders said Sonia is keenly observing Rahuls responses to tricky political situations that are part of his hands-on orientation for a future role.

 Sonias role model and mother-in-law Indira Gandhi had adopted a similar course while grooming Rajiv Gandhi. He was given a suite at 1 Safdarjung Road and made accessible from a separate entrance on 1 Akbar Road. He was given a private secretary, V. George, and associates Vijay Dhar and Arun Singh.

 Dhars father D.P. Dhar had been in Indira Gandhis inner circle of advisers. Rajivs office used to be an alternative durbar where regional satraps, warring ministers, industrialists, scientists and senior bureaucrats made a beeline.

 At present, both sides are trying to catch Rahuls attention to fine-tune their strategy. The outcome of Assembly polls in five states is set to add fuel to fire.

 Arjun has been vociferously backing caste-based reservations and quota for minorities. Natwar Singh, out of the loop following the Volcker controversy, is subtly hinting at the dangers of a paradigm shift in foreign policy and its possible impact on the domestic polity.

 Old family retainer M.L. Fotedar has gone a step further, pointing at Manmohans alleged remark supporting P.V. Narasimha Raos stand on the Babri masjid.

 In a recent interview to a Hindi magazine, Fotedar recalled that on December 4, 1992, he had raised the Babri issue in a cabinet meeting and said nothing was being done to protect it. Rao had then apparently said he was looking into it.

 Dr Manmohan Singh, finance minister at the time, supported Mr Rao. I told him (Manmohan), Kindly keep quiet, it is our duty to protect the disputed structure.

 Coming from an otherwise cautious Fotedar, the move to drag in the good doctor is not without significance. As the present-day Congress has virtually disowned Raos handling of Ayodhya, saying Manmohan was siding with Rao amounts to casting aspersions.

 It is not clear how Rahul reacts to all this. He is busy managing Sonias election in Rae Bareli. Post May 11 will be a decisive period.

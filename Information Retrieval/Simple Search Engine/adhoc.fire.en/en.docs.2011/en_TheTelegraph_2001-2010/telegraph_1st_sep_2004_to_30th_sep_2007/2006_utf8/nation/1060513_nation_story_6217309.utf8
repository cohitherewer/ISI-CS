 Brigadiers under glare

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 12: Army headquarters has ordered an investigation into illegal business deals alleged to have been struck by four brigadiers on suspicion that they were involved with their senior officer, a major general, in cheating the force.

 Major General Gur Iqbal Singh was sacked after a court of inquiry framed charges of illegally selling army supply liquor in the open market and also of misusing funds. 

 The case came to light after a truck carrying cartons of liquor was confiscated while being driven from Bareilly in Uttar Pradesh to Sangrur in Punjab in November last year.

 Sangrur is the major generals hometown and he was at the time commanding the 6 Division headquartered in Bareilly. 

 Army sources said since the court of inquiry, a summary of evidence against the major general officer was being recorded. So far, 18 accounts of charges against him have been recorded. 

 The judge advocate general department of army headquarters will decide if he will face a court martial or will be liable for other punishment. The investigation is being conducted by the armys central command in Lucknow.

 The suspicion that the brigadiers ? also with the same division ? were acting in collusion with their one-time commander arose as the evidence was being recorded. 

 An army source said action against them would be decided after the procedure against the major general is finalised. They are already on the hook, the source said.

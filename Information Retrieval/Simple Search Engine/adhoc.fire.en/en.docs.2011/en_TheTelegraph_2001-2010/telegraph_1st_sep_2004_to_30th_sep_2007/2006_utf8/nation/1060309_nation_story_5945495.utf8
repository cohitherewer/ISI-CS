 After nuke deal, busy days for Barc

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Reactor rush 

 New Delhi, March 8: For a facility of high national security importance where India will not entertain any international inspections, the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (Barc) has plenty to do between now and 2010.

 Under the plan to separate civilian and military nuclear facilities, Barc will have to extract and shift the fuel core of Indias oldest reactor, Apsara, and shut down its second-oldest reactor, Cirus, by 2010.

 Both Apsara and Cirus are located within the Barc complex. In his statement in Parliament on the separation plan, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said the decision to shut down Cirus and shift the fuel core of Apsara was taken to avoid intrusive inspections in a nuclear facility of high national security importance. These steps will not hinder ongoing research and development, Singh said.

 Apsara and Cirus are among Indias stable of research reactors ? facilities for basic and applied research on nuclear reactions that also serve as training houses for reactor operations and produce radioactive isotopes for medicine and industry.

 The decision to shut down the 40MW Cirus reactor would, ideally, need to be followed up by a decision to build a new research reactor, according to nuclear scientists who said the demand for isotopes has been steadily growing in India.

 In 1985, the 100MW indigenous research reactor Dhruva became operational and has emerged as the main source of radioactive isotopes in the country. By the time Cirus is shut down in 2010, Dhruva would have become 25 years old.

 Nuclear scientists have been planning a new research reactor. A Barc paper on research reactors, written well before the Indo-US nuclear deal, had argued that it might be necessary to have a new reactor operational by 2010.

 The basic design of the new reactor could be similar to that of the 100MW Dhruva with appropriate modifications in the design based on operating experiences over the past two decades, according to the paper by scientists from the reactor group.

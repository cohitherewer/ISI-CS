 Budhias mother looks back

 PRABUDDHA S. JAGADEB

 Budhia: Wonder boy

 Bhubaneswar, May 9: Just before the train whistles its way into Bhubaneswar station, one can see the Gautam Nagar slum through the window. And hidden in the maze of houses is the place where child runner Budhia Singh spent three years of his now-famous life.

 The boy may no longer live there, but his mother Sukanti and three elder sisters continue to be residents of the slum facing the railway lines.

 As controversy swirls around Budhia, Sukanti recalls how her son used to run through the bylanes really fast. 

 He was always very swift. Once when he was a toddler, he had crawled up to the railway tracks and some neighbourhood boys brought him back. Thank god no train was coming, she recalls.

 After her husband, a mason, died five years ago, Sukanti took to dishwashing in local houses. She was forced to take her elder daughter Rashmita, then in Class II, out of school and put her in as a domestic help. The family said they would send her to school, but never kept their word, Sukanti laments.

 Rashmita, now 12, wants to study further but knows that may not be possible. I was very good at drawing, she smiles.

 Finding no way out, Sukanti decided to sell her only son. A hawker who frequented our slum wanted to take Budhia with him. He gave me Rs 800, she recalls, adding: But Biranchi sir, who is also the president of our slum, became very angry at this. When the hawker came he asked him to return the child. He even paid Rs 800 from his pocket. 

 This began Budhias life away from home. He started staying in the judo association hall here with some other youths.

 Far from Budhias world of fame, Sukanti has to toil to make both ends meet. Working at the womens hostel of a private engineering college since February, she has to start early to reach her workplace at 8 am. She gets Rs 2,000 for her efforts. 

 Das, Budhias coach-cum-mentor, has come under fire from various quarters for making the child run. But he also has an admirer in the boys mother. When we were in penury, it was Biranchi who looked after the family. I have dedicated my son to bring glory to the nation. Let him run, she says. At least now I can look after my children with the assured income (from the college job).

 Apart from being Budhias coach, Das also trains Sukantis daughters in judo. 

 What if Budhia is asked to stop running? I wont allow that to happen as long as I am alive. When he is with Biranchi, I can at least visit him daily. There are some people with vested interests who cannot tolerate a kid from a slum going so far. They are also jealous of the coach, she says.

 On the doctors raising health concerns, she adds: As a mother I feel nothing wrong with him. The doctors may have been bribed.

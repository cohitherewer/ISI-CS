 New Delhi, Nov. 4: Delhi University today conferred an honorary doctorate on its most famous student. Amitabh Bachchans homecoming, however, wasnt quite smooth.

 Amid the thunderous applause that greeted the superstar at his alma mater, there were voices of dissent, not all of which were muffled.

 The ceremony, where doctorates were also awarded to Delhi chief minister Shiela Dikshit, chief scientific adviser to the Prime Minister C.N.R. Rao and cartoonist R.K. Laxman, had the limelight firmly fixed on Bachchan the chief reason for some peoples chagrin.

 Rao, for instance, made it clear in his acceptance speech. I have spoken to the PM on several occasions. Commercial success is all fine, and I come from the small, neglected community of science, but without science there is no future.

 Laxman decided not to bare his displeasure in public. But he told some journalists that he wasnt happy at being sidelined.

 For his fans, Bachchan may be a superstar, but for some teachers at DU, he is just a poor student. Bachchan, however, would not dispute that. Having failed in his graduation exams once, the actor today said he had never ever thought I would get a doctorate from the same university.

 The teachers are believed to have spoken to vice-chancellor Deepak Pental about their reservations over awarding a doctorate to Bachchan.

 Not all in the academic world would share their sentiments, though. This has been a year of doctorates for the actor. In July, Leicesters De Montfort University had awarded him the degree for his contribution to films. 

 The degree Doctor of Letters however, does not allow Bachchan to use Dr before his name.

 The actor said it was a day to cherish. Recalling the days spent outside the girls college Miranda House, he had the audience in splits. But he also had a word of caution for students. 

 Today, many good jobs dont need you to have high academic qualifications. The youth of today believe they know which highway to the future they should take. But without education, they wouldnt know where the speedbreakers are, when to slow down, to apply brakes, he said.

 Through the day, Bachchan played the role of a perfect gentleman picking up Dikshits degree when she dropped it and obliging autograph-hunters, ignoring protests from Black Cats.

 There was only one person, though, whom Bachchan had to share the spotlight with. Wild screams rent the air as son Abhishek made an entry. Sporting a grey Armani suit with a blue tie and a hairband, the junior Bachchan settled down next to mother Jaya, sister Shweta, her husband Nikhil Nanda and Samajwadi Party leader Amar Singh.

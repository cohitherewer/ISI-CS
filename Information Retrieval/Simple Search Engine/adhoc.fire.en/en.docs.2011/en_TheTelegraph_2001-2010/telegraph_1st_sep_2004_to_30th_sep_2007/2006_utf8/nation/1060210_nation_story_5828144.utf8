 Youth shot at by robbers in Orissa Infocity

 PRIYA ABRAHAM

 Bhubaneswar, Feb. 9: Rajeev Choudhury, a first-year student of the Central Tool Room and Training Centre in Chandrashekharpur here, felt uneasy after dinner last night.

 The youth asked classmate Devendra Singh to accompany him on a stroll. It was around 9 pm and the road leading to the Infosys campus in Infocity was probably the best place to go for a walk, he thought.

 A few minutes later, Choudhury was lying in a pool of blood. A bullet fired by a motorcycle-borne criminal had just hit the youth in his early 20s. 

 The bullet is lodged in the lower abdomen of Choudhury, who was being operated upon in the citys Kalinga Hospital. The surgery started at noon and was still on at midnight. 

 Two men riding a motorcycle stopped right in front of us. Both of them wore helmets and they asked for cash, recounted Singh today, pacing up and down the hospitals corridors.

 The assailants tried to snatch Choudhurys mobile phone but he resisted. A scuffle ensued and the criminals managed to snatch his money and phone.

 Using the bushes as cover, Singh ran towards the campus to get help, but his friend continued to fight till one of the criminals pulled out a handgun and fired at Choudhury. 

 The duo escaped with a cellphone and Rs 150. 

 An Infosys guard who heard the gunshot rushed to the spot and informed security officer Manoranjan Das of the incident. Das then reported the matter to police. 

 Although Choudhury was rushed to the hospital, the doctors did not operate on him till 12 noon today.

 Choudhury, who is originally from Bihar but whose family now lives in Sikkim, took admission for a Masters certificate in computer-aided design in December last year. His parents were yet to arrive. 

 Chandrashekharpur police have lodged a first information report under Section 392 of the Indian Penal Code but police superintendent Amitabh Thakur said they had no idea who the attackers could be. 

 Investigating officer Satyajit Mishra has asked the telecom department to monitor the calls that are received on the snatched mobile phone.

 An hour before the Infocity firing, trader Anang Satyapal Patnaik was robbed of his motorcycle at gunpoint near Fortune Towers while he was riding with a friend. 

 The police suspect that the two incidents could be linked.

 18 kids drown in lake

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Srinagar, 

 May 30: Eighteen schoolchildren on a joy ride on 

 an Indian Navys motor boat drowned in north Kashmirs 

 Wullar lake this afternoon.

 Fourteen children and a teacher were rescued and taken to hospital. A senior police officer said naval divers and commandos were still searching the lake for missing children.

 Police said over 100 students of Burning Candle School in Handwara town had gone for a picnic to the Watlab health resort near Bandipore. 

 At least 40 schoolchildren and the teacher boarded the navy boat, which capsized while taking a turn in the middle of the lake.

 So far, 18 bodies of schoolchildren have been recovered by divers of the navy and troops of Rashtriya Rifles who were assisted by local fishermen, said A.S. Lone, deputy inspector-general of police, north Kashmir range.

 A spokesman of the armys 15 Corps, Lt Col V.K. Batra, said the children and their teachers had requested the Indian Navy authorities deployed on counter-insurgency duty in the area for a joyride. The navy officials had taken permission from their superiors before taking the children out on a ride, he added.

 Police said the driver of the motor boat swam to the shore and alerted the naval authorities.

 A defence spokesperson said an inquiry has been ordered into the incident.

 As soon as the boat capsized, the school authorities fled the spot, leaving the administration confused over the exact number of children who had gone to the lake.

 Reports from Handwara said hundreds of relatives of the children gathered there as news of the tragedy spread. Police said residents raised slogans outside the navy camp in Watlab and pelted stones.

 Senior police and civil officers have reached Watlab.

 The navy has posted divers and specially trained commandos to sanitise the Wullar lake, which is Asias largest freshwater body.

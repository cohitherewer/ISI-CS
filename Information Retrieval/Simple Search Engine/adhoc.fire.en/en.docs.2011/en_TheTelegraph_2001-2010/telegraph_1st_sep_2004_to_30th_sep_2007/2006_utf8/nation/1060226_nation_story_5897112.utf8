 PMO signal to separatists

 MANAN KUMAR

 New Delhi, Feb. 25: After converting the much-hyped round table on Kashmir into a face-saving all-party conference, the Prime Ministers Office today warned separatist Kashmiri leaders to either join the peace process or face marginalisation.

 Their (separatist leaders) absence in todays conference was their loss, not ours. They should understand they can get further marginalised if they dont join the process, said national security adviser M.K. Narayanan, after the meeting that lasted over seven hours. They could continue to meet Prime Minister Manmohan Singh separately, he added.

 Emphasising that the meeting was a beginning, Singh said: To indicate our commitment, I would like to announce that the next round table will be held in the second half of May in Srinagar.

 Narayanan said the Hurriyat Conference, which stayed away today, has approached the Centre for holding the second round of talks. He denied that the PMO rushed to hold the conference, saying if it was possible for others to join, the separatist leaders could also have come.

 Kashmir observers, however, believe there was no need to put the round table on a fast track just to put up a progress card to US President George W. Bush. Some others said the take it or leave it approach adopted by the PMO would not work and the separatist leaders could turn hostile.

 National Conference chief Omar Abdullah said it was a good beginning. The separatist leaders should have come... Many people would advise the Prime Minister to stop talking to them now but I would advise him otherwise. Kashmir is not a law and order problem. It is a political issue and should be solved like one.

 An observer who attended the meeting, however, said it ended in a loss of face for the PMO. What is the meaning of having a round table with those already involved in the constitutional process?

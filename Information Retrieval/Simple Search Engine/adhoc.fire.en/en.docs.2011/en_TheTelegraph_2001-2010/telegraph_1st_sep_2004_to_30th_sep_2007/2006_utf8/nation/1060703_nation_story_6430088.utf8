 Darjeeling toy train heritage in danger

 New Delhi, July 2: The Darjeeling Himalayan Railway could lose its status as a Unesco heritage site if the Bengal government doesnt take better care of it.

 The warning appears in a briefing by Union tourism and culture ministry officials to their minister Ambika Soni, who heads for Calcutta on Tuesday. The officials want the minister to raise the issue with the state government.

 The Darjeeling railway is among the issues listed for discussion when Soni meets the states tourism minister Manab Mukherjee on Wednesday. Also on the agenda is a discussion on developing the Sunderbans as an eco-tourism destination.

 Soni will meet chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, too, during the two days she will be in Calcutta.

 The Darjeeling railway, which meanders through 90 kilometres of picturesque landscape from Darjeeling to Jalpaiguri, was included on Unescos list of World Heritage Sites in 1999.

 In the Union tourism and culture ministrys assessment, the civic amenities around the heritage track are falling apart and there are encroachments along the tracks. The railway ministry recently spent Rs 80 lakh on removing encroachments and restoring the Elysia Building, the headquarters of the Darjeeling railway before 1948.

 The ministry maintains it is the state governments job to make sure that standards are maintained, and if Calcutta doesnt act in time, the Darjeeling line might lose its Unesco status.

 The ministry also suggests some tourist traffic should be diverted from Darjeeling town and that Kurseong and Kalimpong should be developed.

 The toy train line is one of three mountain railways worldwide to figure on the Unesco list of over 800 sites. Nearly 30 of these sites are in India. 

 But two of the heritage sites in India have been put on a Unesco warning list of sorts. The Hampi monuments in Karnataka and the Manas wildlife sanctuary in Assam figure on the list of world heritage in danger.

 What Sonis ministry is implying is that the world heritage status of the 125-year-old Darjeeling railway could be similarly threatened. But it cannot be said at this stage how strongly she would sound the warning when she is in Calcutta.

 On the Sunderbans, the Centre says an environmental impact study needs to be done before a big tourism project is undertaken. In 2004, the state government had submitted a proposal for developing a tourism circuit with the Sahara group. But after environment groups and others raised a fuss, the project was dropped.

 Since then, the state government has asked the Planning Commission and the environment and forest ministry to study the possibility of promoting sustainable tourism in the ecologically fragile Sunderbans.

 Soni would also discuss the progress in the development of a tea tourism circuit with financial help from the Centre. The state has said it found it difficult to get the private sector involved in the project.

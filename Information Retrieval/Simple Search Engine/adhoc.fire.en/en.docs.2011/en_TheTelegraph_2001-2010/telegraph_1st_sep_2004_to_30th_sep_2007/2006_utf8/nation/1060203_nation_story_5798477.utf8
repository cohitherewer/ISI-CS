 Bangalore, Feb. 2 (PTI): Karnataka High Court today rejected an interim prayer seeking disqualification of chief minister-designate H.D. Kumaraswamy and 35 other Janata Dal (Secular) legislators.

 The court said it was not inclined to pass any order before Speaker Krishnas decision on disqualification.

 The verdict comes a day before the Dal (S)-BJP coalition is slated to take office.

 The bench said: Whether the MLAs are liable to be disqualified is to be decided by the Speaker. The judges, however, said they expected the Speaker to take appropriate action as early as possible.

 The petition was filed by MLAs Vatal Nagaraj (Kannada Chaluvali Vatal Paksha), G.V. Srirama Reddy (CPM) and S. Rajendran (Republican Party).

 A single-judge bench yesterday referred the petition to a division bench.

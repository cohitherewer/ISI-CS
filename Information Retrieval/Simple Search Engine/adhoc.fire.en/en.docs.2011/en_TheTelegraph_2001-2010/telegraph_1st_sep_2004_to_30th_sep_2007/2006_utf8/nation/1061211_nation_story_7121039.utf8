 In crisis, a right to rob

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Dec. 10: The agrarian crisis that is spawning suicides in Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra led a group of Madhya Pradesh farmers to claim a right to rob trains for survival.

 As long as they took only what they desperately needed: bags of urea.

 Prakash, Dhuria, Mukesh and their five comrades were defiant at Runkhera station, where they had lifted urea bags off a stationary goods train on Friday night.

 Urea is so vital for us, yet it is out of our reach because of the high price. And the price is still going up. We feel we are within our rights to take these bags as they are meant for us, 32-year-old Prakash said at the station, some 20 km from Ratlam town.

 None of the eight farmers, arrested by the Railway Protection Force (RPF), have a previous record of crime. All have pleaded guilty.

 As in many other states, farmers in Madhya Pradesh are struggling to survive.

 The southwestern town of Ratlam, founded by Captain Borthwick in 1829, boasts well-built houses and brisk trade. But the farmers in the surrounding villages face an acute water shortage for their soyabean and cotton crops. In the dry seasons, they often migrate in search of work.

 According to the Narmada Bachao Andolan and the Opposition, the farmers suffered losses after being supplied the genetically modified BT cotton seeds, especially in the southwestern district of Malwa.

 The price of cotton at the mandis (village markets) has fallen from Rs 4,300 a quintal to Rs 2,500.

 The urea on the train at Runkhera was to be offloaded at Ratlam. Railway authorities said they booked the farmers after realising that several urea bags were missing.

 Their number stayed unclear with some officials claiming over 50 bags were stolen while the RPF kept the figure down to 15-odd.

 There was similar confusion over how many farmers were involved in the theft. Some railway officials said there were 40 in the gang but most had been let off out of sympathy.

 Local people, however, alleged that the RPF had arrested so few because it was itself involved in the theft. Else, how could the theft have taken place with the RPF guarding the station round the clock? said Ramesh Aggarwal, a merchant in Ratlam. This racket may have been going on for a while.

 The RPF strengthened the suspicion by not handing the farmers over to local police. Instead, it charged them with causing damage to the railways.

 State agriculture minister Chaudhary Chandrabhan Singh, who defended the use of BT cotton seeds, said he had not heard of the Runkhera theft.

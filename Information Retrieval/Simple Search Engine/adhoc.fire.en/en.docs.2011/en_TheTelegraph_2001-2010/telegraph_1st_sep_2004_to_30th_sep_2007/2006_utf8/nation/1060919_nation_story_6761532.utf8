 Delhi looks to new beginning

 ASHIS CHAKRABARTI

 On board the Prime Ministers special aircraft, Sept. 18: There is no shift in Indias position on terrorism, but it is no use condemning terrorism and not doing anything about it, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said today. 

 He was convinced that there was an explicit commitment on the part of Pakistan to work with India and do what it can to control terrorism. 

 Pakistan seemed to have realised that it cannot be business as usual unless terrorism was controlled.

 Singh was talking to journalists on his way to Frankfurt en route to New Delhi at the end of the NAM summit in Havana. 

 According to him, President Musharraf has assured him that Pakistan has no hand in perpetuating terrorism in India. 

 Musharraf wanted to leave the past behind and work together with India in future. Thats the best we could get in the circumstances, Singh remarked. 

 And the Prime Minister was confident that the joint India-Pakistan anti-terror institutional mechanism, that the two leaders decided to put in place during their talks in Havana, was a new beginning. 

 I hope it works, but if it does not, then also we have to deal with the consequences. 

 But he wanted the mechanism to be credible and to inspire confidence in both countries. 

 Indian sources argued that the proposal for the mechanism reflected a subtle change, if not in policy, definitely in its implementation. 

 The idea behind it is that while New Delhi will continue to condemn and control terrorism, it will not let the India-Pakistan relations be held hostage to the issue of terrorism. 

 This meant, according to these sources, there would be a reduction in hostile rhetoric on terrorism and Pakistans role in it. The change , it was said, reflected Singhs commitment on improving relations with Pakistan, the issue of terrorism notwithstanding.

 This was no facile optimism, but a realistic approach emanating from the Prime Ministers conviction that the destinies of the two countries are inter-linked and that there was no alternative to talking and trying to improve relations with Pakistan. 

 A reduction in the trust deficit was not a one-day process, Singh said during his interaction with the journalists.

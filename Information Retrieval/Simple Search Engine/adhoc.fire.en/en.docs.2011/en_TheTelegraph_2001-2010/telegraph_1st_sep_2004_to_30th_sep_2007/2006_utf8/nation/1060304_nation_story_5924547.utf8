 Lucknow battle reaches apex court

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 3: The Supreme Court will on Monday hear petitions challenging the Allahabad High Court judgment that set aside the merger of a group of breakaway Bahujan Samaj Party MLAs with the Samajwadi Party in September 2003.

 In four petitions before the apex court, 29 of these 40 MLAs have questioned the high court verdict, given as a 2-1 majority decision, which has kicked off a tug-of-war for these MLAs between the BSP and the Samajwadi Party.

 The petitioners have sought an immediate stay arguing that the two judges expressing the majority opinion had written separate judgments that differed on key legal issues.

 The judgments are likely to create political confusion and spur the Congress and the BSP to use the office of the governor to try and destabilise the state government, the MLAs alleged.

 On February 28, the high court had declared the then Uttar Pradesh Speakers recognition of the merger as invalid and directed the current Speaker to decide the matter afresh.

 Thirteen legislators had broken away from the BSP after the BJP pulled down the Mayavati government in 2003. The BSP filed an application before the then Speaker, Kesri Nath Tripathi, asking that these rebels be disqualified under the anti-defection law.

 But a few days later, another 27 party MLAs joined these 13 to form an independent group of 40 in the Assembly, which was then merged with the Samajwadi Party.

 The high court has asked the current Speaker to first decide the applications seeking disqualification of the first batch of 13 defectors before ruling on the validity of the split and the merger as a whole.

 The BSP had challenged Tripathis decision in the high court arguing he had acted in a mala fide manner by keeping the disqualification applications pending. If the 13 MLAs had stood disqualified, the numbers would fall and the split would not be valid.

 Women press for harass panel teeth

 - Plea to fix inquiry committee status

 New Delhi, Oct. 30: Internal inquiry committees set up to prevent sexual harassment at work may have the power to deliver a final and binding verdict if womens organisations have their way. At present, establishments, not the panels themselves, can penalise an offender.

 We want the government to define the status of an inquiry committee in the Protection Against Sexual Harassment Bill. The committee can now only recommend action against the offender but that opinion is not binding on the organisation, says Jyotsna Chatterjee of the Joint Womens Programme (JWP), one of the voluntary organisations pressing for such a change in the legislation.

 The final disciplinary action is left to the discretion of the establishment which could be companies, institutions or government departments which could well ignore the committees view. Recommendations of transferring an officer facing such charges are often disregarded.

 Establishments are guided by their own service rules, too. For instance, the final verdict in a sexual harassment case in a central ministry will be handed within the ambit of the service rules governing the bureaucracy. 

 Chatterjee cites a case at the Institute of Communication and Technology, where a panel found a member guilty of sexual harassment but had to leave the final action to the governing body. Our recommendation was sent to the governing body. It was up to them to decide the final course of action, she says.

 Guidelines laid down in the Supreme Courts 1997 Vishakha judgment had said the inquiry committee must have at least three members one of whom must be an expert and, more important, should be headed by a woman.

 The bill has been pending for three years, but organisations have been known to observe some of the Vishakha guidelines. But this is being done mostly of their own volition, and there remains no force of the law behind their apparent adherence.

 Once the bill is passed, it will be mandatory for every establishment, public or private, to set up a redress machinery to stop sexual harassment at work. This was the essence of the Vishakha ruling, but womens organisations and the National Commission for Women (NCW), which drafted the bill, have alleged that establishments have been violating the guidelines.

 The NCW says it has been getting complaints from several women who have no redress mechanisms at work in banks, MNCs and government organisations. In many cases, the systems have been put in place, but are ineffective. 

 The bill that will now be introduced will act as a deterrent to an offence that is widespread, said a member of the Lawyers Collective, a group that has been actively engaged in drawing up the bill. 

 The bill defines sexual harassment as unwelcome sexually-determined behaviour such as physical contact, advances, sexually coloured remarks, showing pornography, sexual demands whether by words or action.

 It is the womans perception of sexual harassment that will count, the bill says. It is the reasonable perception of the woman that would be relevant in determining whether any conduct was sexually coloured and if so whether such conduct was unwelcome or not, the bill says.

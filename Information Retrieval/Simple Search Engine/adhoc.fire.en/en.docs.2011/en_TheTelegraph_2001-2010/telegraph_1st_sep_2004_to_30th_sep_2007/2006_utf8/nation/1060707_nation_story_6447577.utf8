 Pass seal on Sikkim

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Nathu-la, July 6: Indian government organisations involved in the opening of this pass for border trade are consistently referring to this point as the international boundary, conveying that whatever residual issues on resolving Chinas acknowledgement of Sikkim as a part of India have been resolved.

 Nathu-la is on what has been technically called the Line of Actual Control between India and China in east Sikkim. Such a recognition from Beijing ? if any were warranted since the Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao presented a map showing Sikkim in India during his April 2005 visit to New Delhi ? comes on the birthday of the Dalai Lama, whose Tibetan government-in-exile enjoys Indian hospitality.

 Despite the trade, the Indian Army will continue to man the international boundary including Nathu-la. The security concerns in carrying out our primary tasks have been adequately addressed in light of the trade activity across the pass, the Indian Army said in a press statement here.

 The relations between the two armies continue to be cordial and regular border personnel meetings are held twice a year. Issues of concern are promptly addressed through the telephone hotline or through flag meetings between the two military garrisons, the army said.

 The Border Roads Organisation (BRO), headed by the army, also has a new description for Nathu-la. An official brief by Dantak, the BRO project that maintains the road, says: Project Dantak of the Border Roads Organisation was tasked last year in July 2005 to execute all work to join the Jawaharlal Nehru Marg (as the road is named in India) with the Chinese road at the Nathu-la international border.

 Sikkims chief minister Pawan Chamling did not use the words international boundary or international border in his speech at the ceremony to mark Nathu-las opening but said he expected the event to lead to more liberalisation of Indian and Chinese border policies.

 The re-opening of Nathu-la trade route also augurs well for the entire Northeast region of India. This is the way to realise the larger goals of Indias Look East policy and consolidate sub-regional groupings like South Asia Growth Quadrangle and (the) Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Techno-Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC), he said.

 He said Sikkim was honoured to be a land-bridge between India and China. Please be assured that this rare honour bestowed upon us would be respected, maintained and operationalised in the best Indian tradition of keeping the national interest aloft for ever and ever.

 The Nathu-la experience today is a rare instance of a state government having a say in shaping foreign policy.

 Atal spies crisis

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 30: Atal Bihari Vajpayee today hinted at an internal crisis in the BJP, immediately sparking speculation about crucial desertions from the party.

 Jharkhand strongman Babulal Marandi recently quit the BJP, preceded by important leaders Uma Bharti and Madan Lal Khurana, to name three.

 Vajpayee typically refrained from naming anyone but spoke about the BJPs turmoil within. Some people are leaving the party. Though not many are leaving, this issue needs to be looked into, he said.

 Delivering his valedictory address to members of the partys national executive, he said: We can never be damaged by external factors. But there is certainly a crisis if we start creating our own problems.

 Party general secretary Arun Jaitley refused to elaborate on Vajpayees comments. Facing a flurry of questions about whether Vajpayee was referring to any possibility of Uma or Khuranas return to the BJP, Jaitley said: It is not a tradition in our party to comment on Vajpayeejis speech.

 Our behaviour is judged by the kind of relations we evolve with each other. If we have created an atmosphere where people cannot express themselves freely, it should indicate a crisis, said Vajpayee.

 He talked at length about states where the BJP is in power and better relations between the party and the state governments. 

 There should be better relations between the organisation and the government wherever we are in power. We are running responsible governments in several states but the effort should be towards ensuring that we win future elections in the states. In some states, there are coalition governments. This is a difficult task. We should work in such a manner that these governments function smoothly, Vajpayee said.

 Shahnawaz in temple trouble

 GAUTAM SARKAR

 Bhagalpur, Oct. 13: Shahnawaz Hussain, the BJP candidate from Bhagalpur, offered prayers at a Shiva temple yesterday. Today, several hundred litres of milk, water from the Ganga and honey were poured in the sanctum sanctorum of the century-old temple to purify it as priests chanted mantras.

 The ritual was organised by Pradeep Joshi, president of the Hindu Seva Samiti and an Independent MLA who is also fighting for the Bhagalpur seat. The bypoll is being held after deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi vacated the seat. 

 Hussain filed his nomination yesterday.

 Joshi asked how Hussain, a non-Hindu, was allowed inside the temple but the two priests were unfazed. Shankar and Pappu Jha were calm and said that while Joshi followed the prescribed rituals, they saw nothing wrong with Hussain offering prayers.

 We are not aware of anything the temple may have lost when a non-Hindu entered it and offered puja, said one. 

 Hussain, a former Union minister, pointed out that he offered prayers at places of worship of different faiths. 

 Bihar urban development minister and BJP member Ashwini Choubey, pushed to the backfoot by the aggressive Joshi and his high drama, rationalised that Hussains wife Renu Sharma was a Hindu before marriage and she might have influenced him to pray at the temple. 

 Dozens of BJP leaders had accompanied Hussain and explained that the BJPs culture of tolerance for all faiths influenced the party candidate.

 The Rashtriya Janata Dal added another twist to the tale, alleging that Hussain had violated the model code of conduct by trying to use a temple in a political campaign. Former MP Subodh Rao said both Hussain and Joshi were disturbing communal harmony in the silk city.

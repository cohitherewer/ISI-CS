 Lips sealed, Arjun tackles wagging tongues

 Arjun: Bid to clear air

 New Delhi, April 30: As conspiracy theories accused him of working to destabilise the Prime Minister, Arjun Singh today met the media in what seemed a damage control bid.

 Little that was controversial escaped his sealed lips and those who expected a defence of the planned Other Backward Classes quota ? a day after Rahul Gandhi side-stepped the complex matter ? were disappointed. Yet there were subtle jabs at perceived opponents of the policy, such as his colleague Kapil Sibal.

 Sources close to the HRD minister said he wanted to dispel the impression that his move on reservations was aimed at cornering Manmohan Singh, and to undo the damage to his image by the student-police clash over the quotas.

 Asked if he felt he had got his due from the party ? reports had suggested he was out to grab the Prime Ministers job ? he said: I am getting what I should get. I do not feel deprived.

 Arjun also tried to put himself in the clear on the meeting with Natwar Singh, which had reportedly annoyed Sonia Gandhi. Just hours before the meeting, the former foreign minister had criticised the Centres Nepal policy and suggested he was being targeted in the oil-for-food scandal while the Congress was being let off.

 Arjun said: The Congress is nowhere in the picture. I am confident that the Congress has not compromised and will not compromise. He added the meeting was not significant and if Natwar had flouted party discipline with his remarks, action must be taken against him.

 On the students protesting against OBC reservation, Singh had only one thing to say: they shouldnt listen to those instigating them.

 On the policy itself, his lips were sealed till the Assembly polls got over, and he had no comment on Rahul Gandhis stand that both pro- and anti-reservationists had valid reasons. 

 But asked whether Kapil Sibal should have spoken against reservation, he said: It is certainly not desirable.

 The science and technology minister had earlier this week voiced concern at possible dilution of excellence, though he yesterday claimed he wasnt speaking about the OBC quota at all.

 Sources said Sonia recognises the need for pro-people measures but will not stand for any destructive move to dislodge the Prime Minister or make things difficult for the government.

 Book plan

 Arjun told reporters he plans to write a book describing his experiences during a five-decade political career. It will be titled A Grain of Sand in An Hourglass of Time.

 Mulayam looks for cola ban route

 Lucknow, Oct. 15: Mulayam Singh Yadav has spoken of banning Coca-Cola and Pepsi in Uttar Pradesh through a legislation, standing with the BJP against the United Progressive Alliance on a thorny subject.

 Union health minister Anbumani Ramadoss had given the cola majors a clean chit in August saying the Centres tests had failed to corroborate the allegations of the NGO, Centre for Science and Environment, that the duos soft-drink brands contained high levels of pesticide.

 But Mulayam has told the Assembly he was prepared to impose a ban on Coke and Pepsi after the BJPs Lakshmikant Vajpayee and the Rashtriya Lok Dals Ajay Kumar raised the issue.

 The chief minister, however, did not want to risk an executive order with Kerala High Court having ruled that a state government is not empowered to impose such a ban under the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act.

 The high court had squashed the cola ban by the Left-ruled Kerala, the only state to impose a blanket ban on Coke and Pepsi sales. Most BJP states, however, have stopped the sale of colas in schools, colleges, hospitals and government offices.

 In the Assembly last week, some BJP members insis- ted that the Uttar Pradesh government ban the colas immediately.

 But Mulayam said: In Kerala, a ban was imposed but the high court vacated it. Let us have a consensus in the House. Once this is done, there will be more than one way to impose the ban. If a legal formula is evolved, I am prepared to go for it.

 He told the members that the soft drink majors had a long reach.

 The chief minister cited how the members of the parliamentary committee formed to look into the pesticide controversy during the National Democratic Alliances tenure were overwhelmingly in favour of the colas. 

 The sole Samajwadi Party member on the panel, Akhilesh Singh Yadav (Mulayams son and MP from Kannauj), was helpless, he said.

 My party could not do anything then. Itni taakat hai bechne walon ki (the sellers have that much clout).

 Mulayam, who has been trying to shed his pro-industrialist image in the run-up to the Assembly polls slated for early 2007, used the issue to project a pro-farmer stance. He said his government wanted to promote home-grown soft drinks, made of fruit juice, that would benefit the farmers.

 A Samajwadi Party MLA suggested the state government conduct its own tests on cola samples before ordering a ban.

 Whether you go for a fresh test or not, I know soft drinks like Coke and Pepsi are dangerous to public health, Mulayam said.

 Earlier, state revenue minister Ambika Chaudhary had told the House that Section 3 of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act did not list soft drinks among the 63 items that came under regulation. Therefore, the legislative route was the only option.

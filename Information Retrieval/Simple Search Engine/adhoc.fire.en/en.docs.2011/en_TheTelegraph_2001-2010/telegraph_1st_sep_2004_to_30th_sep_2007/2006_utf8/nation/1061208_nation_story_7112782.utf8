 Last-minute trouble for nuke bill

 OUR BUREAU

 Washington/New Delhi, Dec. 7: A US official visiting New Delhi assured India that its concerns will be addressed in the bill allowing the nuclear deal between the two countries to start rolling even as the legislation hit a roadblock at the last minute.

 We anticipate a very supportive bill, under-secretary of state Nicholas Burns said at a joint news conference with foreign secretary Shivshankar Menon. 

 The US intends to meet all the commitments that we made to the Indian government that includes fuel assurances, he said.

 Under the deal, the US will cooperate in developing civilian nuclear energy in India, for which an enabling legislation has to be passed in Congress. 

 The two arms of Congress the House of Representatives and the Senate have passed their separate bills and the process of reconciling the two versions in an agreed text is under way in a conference of members of both legislatures.

 Last evening, John Boehner, the majority (Republican) leader of the House of Representatives, halted all action on the text of the legislation. The bill was earlier expected to be put up for vote in Congress today after the Senate and House of Representatives versions of the text were finally reconciled around noon on Wednesday.

 The bill would now be put before Congress only when Boehner and other leaders are able to resolve some new issues.

 Burns was confident the bill would be passed before it goes to President George W. Bush for signing into law by Friday, the last day of Congresss lame-duck session, so called because a new House is to be formed shortly with recently elected members.

 If its not cleared tomorrow, the bill could get delayed for months. 

 Congressional aides have been working all night to resolve the problems. They worked all night on Tuesday to produce an agreed draft. 

 Some Congressional aides are saying that a number of Congressmen, especially Democrats, are extremely upset that many provisions aimed at restraining Indias nuclear programme have been watered down in the final text in an effort to make the deal acceptable to New Delhi. 

 Pressure from these Congressmen has persuaded Boehner to put off action until they are pacified, according to these aides.

 Others are saying Boehner is worried that since the India-related bill is assured of passage, many Congressmen are trying to attach their pet provisions unrelated to the bill to this legislation, a common practice in Congress. Boehner is stalling to avoid such an eventuality and wants to bring the India-related bill to the floor at short notice and, perhaps, on the last day. 

 The reality, probably, is a mix of the two.

 Congress has attempted a compromise among Indias concerns, the Bush administrations views and those of key Congressmen.

 The result broadly is that provisions India does not like will remain in the bill, but will be sufficiently watered down so as to be toothless from New Delhis point of view, Congressional aides said.

 That way, all sides can claim victory and save face.

 Section 106, which prohibits the export of equipment and technology for uranium enrichment, processing of spent fuel and heavy water production, may remain in the statute. So may Section 107, which requires end-use monitoring of US exports and re-exports of nuclear material.

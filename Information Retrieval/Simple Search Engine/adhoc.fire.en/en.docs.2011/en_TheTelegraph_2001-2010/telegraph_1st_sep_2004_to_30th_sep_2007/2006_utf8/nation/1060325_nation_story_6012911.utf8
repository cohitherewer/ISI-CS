 Kalam sends ball to EC court

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 24: Sonia Gandhis timing was just right: the day she quit the Lok Sabha and the National Advisory Council, President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam had sent to the Election Commission petitions seeking her disqualification from the House.

 Poll panel chief B.B. Tandon today revealed that his office had received the references ? which alleged Sonia held offices of profit ? from the President yesterday while he was away in Assam.

 The commission was forwarded two petitions against the Congress president ? one from Telugu Desam MPs and the other from Indore-based BJP leader Sanjay Jarulia. The complainants, if necessary, would be asked to furnish additional documents.

 Asked whether this mattered any more since Sonia had quit both the House and the alleged office of profit, Tandon said it was the commissions duty to give its opinion on references from the President.

 The President has also forwarded to the poll panel petitions against a host of other MPs: Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee and nine other CPM members; Congress leaders Karan Singh, T. Subbirami Reddy and Kapila Vatsyayan as well as Anuradha Chaudhary of the Rashtriya Lok Dal.

 Tandon said the petitions against the CPM members and Chaudhary lacked several key details and documents, which the complainants have been asked to furnish by April 17. The petition against the Left MPs was filed by Trinamul Congress general secretary Mukul Roy.

 The commission has also received a reference from the Jharkhand governor relating to four MLAs: Khiru Mahato, Karia Munda, Chatru Ram Mahato and Saryu Rai. It today completed the hearing on Uttar Pradesh minister Azam Khan.

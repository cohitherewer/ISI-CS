 Condi to skip Afghan meet

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Rice: No show

 New Delhi, Nov. 6: US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice and Pakistan foreign minister Khursheed Mehmood Kasuri will skip the second regional economic conference on Afghanistan slated to be held in Delhi later this month. But Iranian foreign minister Manouchehr Mottaki will attend the event that had promised to bring together high-profile world leaders.

 The conference, scheduled to be held on November 18 and 19, brings together countries helping in the economic reconstruction of Afghanistan. This is the second edition of the summit, the first being in Kabul last December.

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Afghan President Hamid Karzai will inaugurate the meeting. All the participating nations will be represented by their foreign ministers. 

 The possibility of Rice attending the conference had raised the stakes but she decided to send assistant secretary of state for South and Central Asia Richard Boucher.

 Kasuri will be in Delhi this month on a private visit.

 Pakistans move to send a junior minister minister of state for economic affairs Hina Rabbani Khar is seen as an attempt to take the sting out of the conference. 

 India and Pakistan have been at loggerheads on the situation in Afghanistan. Delhi has raised concerns about Islamabads role in reviving the Taliban.

 But officials said the focus of the conference will be to carry forward the Kabul declaration. Representatives will come from 19 countries, including the G8 nations. 

 Among the foreign ministers, Russias Sergei Lavrov is expected to be in Delhi and so is Frances Philippe Douste-Blazy.

 Representatives of the World Bank and other international organisations will also take part in the deliberations.

 The officials said key issues like how to utilise the capacities of existing regional programmes would come up for discussion along with finding ways to strengthen national capacities.

 India is one of the major contributors in providing economic assistance to Afghanistan, taking part in several infrastructure development projects, the officials added.

 Delhi had volunteered to host the summit earlier this year as part of its endeavour to join international efforts to stabilise war-ravaged Afghanistan.

 Tharoor bets on Big Five

 New Delhi, June 19: Indias decision to back Shashi Tharoor for United Nations secretary-general was a carefully crafted move that followed informal consultations with the major powers except China.

 By the time Tharoors candidature was announced, the foreign office had sounded four of the five permanent members (P5) of the UN Security Council: the US, Russia, Britain and France.

 Tharoor himself recently went on a private visit to China and is believed to have been told by Beijing it would not stand in his way.

 Goh Chok Tongs refusal to be a candidate is seen as a boost for Tharoor: the US had apparently been very keen on the former Singapore Prime Minister.

 Delhi is still apprehensive about Beijings support for its choice, but old ally Russia has backed him with a wink and a nod. Before coming to Delhi ? he arrived last night ? Tharoor had spent a week in Moscow and met Russian leaders.

 Therefore, as of now, though the P5 members may not have strongly and overtly backed Tharoor, they havent shown any opposition either.

 Tharoor said he had come to India in search of his roots and to familiarise himself with its political establishment before the launch of his campaign for the December election. I am here to visit my home base and meet the political leadership, he said.

 Tharoor, who traces his roots to Keralas Palakkad district, today met Prime Minister Manmohan Singh at his Race Course Road residence and separately interacted with foreign office mandarins and political parties.

 He met CPM leaders ? who have influence with countries such as China, Cuba and Venezuela ? to seek their support. He, however, faced tough questions from party general secretary Prakash Karat and his junior colleague Sitaram Yechury.

 We want to know how Tharoors candidature affects Indias claim to a (permanent) seat in the UN Security Council, Yechury said.

 Tharoor has a tough job at hand as his nomination has flung the doors open for a fierce competition among Asian candidates. In keeping with a rotational policy, an Asian is likely to be chosen for the key job.

 Tharoor will fight three fellow Asians ? Sri Lankan diplomat Jayantha Dhanapala, Thailands deputy Prime Minister Surakiart Sathirathai and South Korean foreign minister Ban Ki Moon.

 Several more candidates are expected to show up. India, however, isnt taking Pakistans threat to block Tharoors candidature seriously. 

 For Delhi, the dark horse could be Jordanian diplomat Prince Zayed Al Hussein, who represented his country at the UN. He has US backing though he isnt a declared candidate yet.

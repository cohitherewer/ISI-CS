 Jinnah frost melts a little at RSS movie

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Advani and Sudarshan

 New Delhi, Aug. 16: The wayward son seems to be back in favour.

 Barely seven months after the RSS pushed him out of the BJP presidents office, L.K. Advani was yesterday seen getting up close and personal with parivar chief K.S. Sudarshan.

 The occasion was the launch of Karmyogi, a film on the second RSS chief, M.S. Golwalkar, in which Advani is the only leader from the BJP who makes an appearance.

 Advani shared the dais with Sudarshan and the two were seen deep in conversation for a while. It was the first sign of a thaw in a relationship gone sour after the BJP leaders praise of Pakistans founder Mohammad Ali Jinnah angered the Sangh.

 For a while, relations between Advani and Sangh leaders were so bitter that they were not on talking terms, not even over phone.

 Although he made a trip to Nagpur and met Sangh leaders after announcing the Bharat Suraksha Yatra in April, the Sangh top brass was cold to his advances. But things seemed to have taken a different turn last evening.

 In the film, which also features Sangh stalwarts like Sudarshan and second-in-command Mohanrao Bhagwat, Advani comments on the life and times of Golwalkar. In the 20th century, the Sanghs was the biggest movement of nation-building, he is quoted as saying in the film.

 In RSS circles, the film is largely being portrayed as an important documentation of not just Golwalkars life but also as the Sanghs counter to allegations of involvement in Mahatma Gandhis assassination as well as the charge of not having participated in the freedom struggle.

 The storyline was prepared by Sangh-affiliated academic Rakesh Sinha, RSS ideologue Balram Mishra and former Sangh spokesperson Ram Madhav. The film underlines Golwalkars response to Gandhis assassination his letters to Jawaharlal Nehru and Sardar Patel condemning the murderous attack by Nathuram Godse.

 Advani was also asked to honour the people involved in the making of the film TV actor and former BJP MP Nitish Bharadwaj, Balram Mishra and Arvind Balgaiyan, the theatre actor from Bhopal who played Golwalkar.

 The move to have Advani as a commentator is aimed to allay public perception that he has fallen out with the Sangh, an RSS leader said.

 Besides Advani, Sushma Swaraj was the only BJP leader present at the function packed with RSS whole-timers. Advani had also brought his daughter Pratibha along for the screening.

 After the film started, he joined his daughter and Sushma and watched with them.

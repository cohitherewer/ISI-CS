 Kids lucky on Jaya birthday

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Chennai, Feb. 24: Today was the right day to be born in Tamil Nadu. Scores of children at government hospitals were welcomed into the world with expensive gifts by ministers because they were sharing their birthday with chief minister Jayalalithaa.

 The upcoming Assembly elections would have provided an added fillip to the politicians efforts.

 If information technology minister D. Jayakumar gifted gold rings to newborns at Royapuram in north Chennai, his cabinet colleague B. Valarmathi showered silver anklets in her constituency of Alandur on the citys periphery.

 PWD minister . Pannerselvam had earlier formally opened the celebrations of Jayalalithaas 58th birth anniversary by cutting a 58-kg cake at the ADMK headquarters.

 Ministers and bureaucrats lined up at the chief ministers residence but few were lucky enough to get an audience to wish her personally. The rest had to be content with leaving their bouquets and messages behind.

 Hundreds of women party workers gathered outside the bungalow to cut another huge cake and burst crackers. They later distributed sweets on the streets.

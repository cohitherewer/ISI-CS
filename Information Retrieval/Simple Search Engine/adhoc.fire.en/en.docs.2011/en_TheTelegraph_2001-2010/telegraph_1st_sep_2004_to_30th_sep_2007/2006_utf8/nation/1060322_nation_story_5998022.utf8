 CAG raps govt for jet luxury

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 21: The Comptroller and Auditor General has found that the government has paid an exorbitant amount to do up VVIP aircraft with plush interiors and in-flight entertainment facilities.

 The Centre contracted five executive aircraft to be used for VVIPs in September 2003. The CAG has said an additional amount of Rs 126.9 crore was spent on fancy trappings.

 The aircraft (Legacy jets) were bought from Embraer of Brazil. Four of these, valued at Rs 571.54 crore, are to be used by the air forces communication squadron and one, costing Rs 140.97 crore, is with the Border Security Force.

 The report said the communication squadron already has Avro and Boeing aircraft. Although these aircraft are underutilised, the defence ministry projected a need for the Legacy jets. The CAG has questioned this purchase.

 The expenditure of Rs 101.52 crore on interiors and in-flight entertainment in... the four aircraft for the communication squadron underscored inadequate concern for economy, the report said. For the aircraft for the BSF, Rs 25.38 crore was spent.

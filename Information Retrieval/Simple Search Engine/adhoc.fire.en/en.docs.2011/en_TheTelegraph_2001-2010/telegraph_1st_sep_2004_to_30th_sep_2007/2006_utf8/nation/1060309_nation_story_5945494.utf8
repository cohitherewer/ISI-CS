 Uma tied in name knot

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 8: Whats in a partys name? Plenty, if Uma Bharti has to swing her political fortunes.

 The sadhvi, who was expelled from the BJP on December 5 last year, is currently engaged in picking the right name ? and thus, the right image ? for her political front. She has set April 30 as the deadline for the announcement.

 Names like the Bharatiya Janata Dal or the Real BJP might sting her erstwhile party. But the Sanyasin Party (SP) would, perhaps, be more apt for an electoral debut in Uttar Pradesh, where the real SP (Samajwadi Party) is currently in power.

 Sources said the delay in the announcement is largely because she is extra cautious about which of her diverse identities she wants to promote ? a mascot of Hindutva, a woman, a sadhvi or an OBC? But then, she is equally popular with the upper castes.

 The name of a political party is an important indication of which way she is headed; the kind of politics she wants to pursue. Would she recreate her past and emerge as the latest Hindutva icon or align herself with the backward castes and practise a different brand of politics. She is thinking hard, said a source.

 Names and symbols hold a pride of place for all political parties. The Bharatiya Janata Party is synonymous with the BJPs cultural nationalism, the Samajwadi Party falls back on Mulayam Singhs socialist past and the Biju Janata Dal is clearly an attempt to cash in on Biju Patnaiks popularity.

 In Madhya Pradesh, Uma had led a successful election campaign three years ago, flaunting her OBC identity on her sleeves and focusing on development issues. The Hindutva aspect was temporarily forgotten.

 But the story is different in her new battleground. The ongoing political turmoil in Uttar Pradesh and its caste-ridden politics have added to Umas anxiety. If she wants to cash in on Hindutva, which is the upper-caste vote-bank, she loses out on OBC support.

 The Hindutva identity poses a problem in attracting the backward classes, the SCs and oppressed sections. The fact that she was thrown out of the BJP has evoked sympathy from the OBCs, a section Uma belongs to. So, while her Hindutva image is a positive factor, in UP it becomes a problem vis-?-vis the OBC votes, said a source close to Uma.

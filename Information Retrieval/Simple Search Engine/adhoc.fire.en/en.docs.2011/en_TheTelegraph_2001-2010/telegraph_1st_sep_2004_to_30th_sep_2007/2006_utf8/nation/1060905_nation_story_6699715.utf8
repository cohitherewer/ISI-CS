 New Delhi, Sept. 4: An attempt by advocates from Kashmir to use the Supreme Court as a forum to show the world the real face of India in Kashmir today brought a sharp rebuke from the bench.

 The Jammu and Kashmir High Court bar association, a respondent in a Srinagar sex scandal that has reached the apex court, had threatened to use the hearing to expose what the Indian establishment was doing to the Valley.

 This happens only in India. Despite all this you are being heard. No other democracy will allow you Chief Justice Y.K. Sabharwal told the bar members.

 The bar association had issued a press note saying it was not compromising its stand on Kashmir by appearing before Indias highest court.

 The bar association is not going back on its stand on Kashmir issue. On the other hand, by appearing in the case it will expose politicians, bureaucrats, police officials, etc, who have sexually exploited teenage girls of Kashmir in the name of countering insurgency and show the entire world the real face of India in Kashmir, the August 23 statement said.

 Among the accused in the sex scandal are several MLAs, former ministers and senior police officers.

 Please keep judiciary away from all this. This should not be made a political issue. This is a social evil it has to be unearthed, the Chief Justice told the bar, which then expressed regret.

 The bench transferred the case against the 14 accused so far chargesheeted by the CBI from the Srinagar sessions court to a Chandigarh court.

 The accused had petitioned the apex court for a transfer, pleading that no lawyer in Srinagar was willing to defend them because of a threat from the bar association. The bar denied this.

 Those chargesheeted include MLAs Raman Mattoo and G.A. Mir (both former ministers), principal secretary Md Iqbal Khanday, former advocate-general Anil Sethi, deputy inspector-general K.C. Padhi and deputy superintendent Md Yusuf Mir.

 The racket burst into the open in March after 13 people were arrested on the charge of making and circulating obscene CDs.

 With the local media full of how people in high places were exploiting minor girls, the Jammu and Kashmir High Court took suo motu cognisance and began monitoring the investigations.

 The bar association then stepped in, moving the high court for a CBI inquiry. In May, the state handed the probe over to the central agency.

 The high court then ordered the investigating officer to question the suspects in custody. The CBI challenged this in the apex court, which today clarified the order didnt mean every person named by the victims had to be arrested.

 With this and the transfer plea by the accused before it, the court had issued notices to all the parties, including the bar association. Some bar members decided to stay away, but a majority saw an opportunity for political propaganda.

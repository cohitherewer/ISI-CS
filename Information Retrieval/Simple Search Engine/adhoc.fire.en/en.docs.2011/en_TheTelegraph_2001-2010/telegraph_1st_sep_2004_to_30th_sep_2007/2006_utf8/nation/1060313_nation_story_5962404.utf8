 Talks afloat on backwaters

 JOHN MARY

 Kumarakom (Kerala), March 12: The border delineation process between India and China will start probably after two more rounds of ongoing talks between the two sides.

 Indias national security adviser M.K. Narayanan and Chinese vice-foreign minister Dai Bingguo told reporters at the Kumarakom backwater resort in central Kerala that both countries were pleased with the pace of the parleys, based on the laid-down Political Parameters and Guiding Principles.

 Dai Bingguo said the picturesque backwaters helped make a good start.

 Im in the province of my friend Narayanan and were looking forward to clinching crucial issues. With talks in his own beautiful province, we hope to make much progress. The beauty of this place will add to our wisdom, he said.

 Narayanan said the focus of the current negotiations was to take out the core issue from the logjam. The political and strategic direction would lend the much-needed thrust for resolving the complex border issues, he added.

 Our effort is to extricate the talks from the logjam, Narayanan said, adding that a definite framework could be formulated after the next two rounds of talks. We are for reaching an agreement as soon as possible to strengthen India-China friendship.

 Asked about Chinese apprehensions over the civilian nuclear deal between India and the US, Narayanan said the issue was unlikely to dominate the discussions. But the part concerning China as a member of the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) would figure in the talks.

 Dai Bingguo was cryptic in his reply on the deal, saying: Weve taken note of the deal between India and the US. But we are here primarily for discussions on the border issue.

 Narayanan said the talks were initiated when the NDA government was in power in Delhi. Two rounds each were held with the then national security advisers Brajesh Mishra and the late J.N. Dixit.

 The two delegations, with 10 members on both sides, were given a traditional welcome on arrival at the Taj Garden Retreat.

 Girls showered flowers on the guests. As the guests dipped into the best of Kerala and Chinese cuisine, youths performed kalaripayattu, the local martial art, in the background.

 After the two-hour-long meeting, the guests boarded the Palace on Waves, a houseboat, for dinner. The setting could not be more poignant with Chinese fishing nets silhouetting the hotel where the talks were held.

 The team will leave for Kochi after another round of talks on Monday morning before they wind up and leave for Singapore on Wednesday.

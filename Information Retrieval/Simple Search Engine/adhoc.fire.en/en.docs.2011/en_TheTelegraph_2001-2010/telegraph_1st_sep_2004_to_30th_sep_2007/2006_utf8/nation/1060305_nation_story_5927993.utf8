 Singh nudges Bush on Iran

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 4: With the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) set to discuss Iran again on Monday, the Prime Minister had tried to buy time for Tehran during his one-to-one meeting here with the US President.

 Iran is a proud nation and should not be pushed to the wall, Manmohan Singh had told George W. Bush.

 He argued that the leadership in Tehran is new and should be given time to get its perspective right and have a dialogue. Iran should not be treated the way it is being now.

 Behind the Prime Ministers diplomatic efforts was the realisation that his governments relations with the Left, already strained because of several issues including Bushs visit, would be severely tested during Mondays IAEA board meeting. He was anxious to avoid a showdown at the meeting.

 Bush, however, stood firm. He referred to the Russian offer to purify uranium for Iran and argued that Tehran had been given enough time. He added that Iran hadnt helped the US in Iraq.

 Sources said India was yet to decide how it would vote if the issue reached the voting stage at the IAEA meeting. Officials said Delhi would follow its instincts after analysing the resolution.

 Bushs stand would have hardened today with Tehran and the top European Union powers failing in their latest efforts to resolve the standoff.

 After two-hour talks last night in Vienna at Irans request, German, French and British representatives, as well as EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana, said Tehran had no new ideas on how to allay fears that it seeks nuclear bombs.

 Delhi, which had last month voted for a resolution to report Iran to the UN Security Council, is trying hard to avoid a vote on Monday, as it can have serious political implications back home.

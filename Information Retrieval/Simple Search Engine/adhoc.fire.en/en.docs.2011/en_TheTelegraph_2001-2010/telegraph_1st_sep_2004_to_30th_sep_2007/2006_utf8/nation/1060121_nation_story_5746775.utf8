 Calcutta, Jan. 20: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee is seeking investment from Singapore to upgrade airports, ports and chemical plants in Bengal.

 After an hour-long meeting at Writers this evening, Goh Chok Tong told reporters he had assured the chief minister he would send a team of officials to check out prospects in the state.

 I told him I am not an expert in these fields. But I will send a team of technocrats to Bengal to look into the prospects. We are looking for investment opportunities in Bengal, the senior Singapore minister said.

 Like he had done at the Confederation of Indian Industry meet yesterday, Goh today said Bhattacharjee was reform-minded but some of his party colleagues were yet to catch up with his thinking.

 The chief minister is my friend. He is very reform-minded and understands that the policy must change if one wants foreign investment. But some of his colleagues are old fashioned, Goh said.

 I have asked the chief minister to send some MPs to Singapore to interact with MPs there and find out how Singapore tackled the problem of development.

 At the CII meet earlier in the day, Goh stressed much the same thing. He said the reform and liberalisation momentum in Bengal had to be maintained and the collective mindset overhauled.

 This mindset change has to apply to Bengal. CM told me he has to review this with some members of his party. I asked him why dont you send some MPs to Singapore, Goh said, straying from his written speech at the final session.

 Bhattacharjee refused to react to Gohs suggestion. Eto taratari bola jaey na (I cant comment so soon), he said.

 Playing on the reform refrain, Goh said that in a globalised world, investors were spoilt for choice. They can pick and choose their markets. We have to push the pace of reforms to improve our competitiveness so that we are the chosen ones.

 Goh said India would require at least $150 billion to develop world class infrastructure in the next 78 years. This is a huge but critical investment. These projects can benefit from private sector participation and open up huge opportunities for both India and foreign businesses.

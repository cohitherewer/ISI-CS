 Watch Krrish, trace his steps

 Singapore, June 21: Before saving the world, Krrish has cracked The Da Vinci Code.

 The Rakesh Roshan film, starring Hrithik Roshan as the countrys first indigenous superhero, has spawned an international tourist tour, very much like what the Dan Brown bestseller did.

 If taking a Da Vinci tour means hopping through the famous locations in the book ? Pariss Louvre Museum to Londons Temple Church to Scotlands Rosslyn Chapel ? a Krrish tour would take you to all the spots in Singapore that form the backdrop of the much-awaited sequel to Koi? Mil Gaya.

 So what would be a sample itinerary of a Krrish tour? It starts off with a breakfast of Kaya toast and soft-boiled eggs at the Lau Pa Sat, the 112-year festival market near which Hrithik fell from 50 metres above during the shooting.

 After a detailed exploration of the canopy that saved Hrithik, you can head to Sentosa Islands where Hrithik and leading lady Priyanka Chopra romanced in the waters during the song Koi tumsa nahin.

 After a lunch of chilli crab or fish head curry, its time for a tram ride around the Singapore zoo where a Krrish sequence was shot featuring two orang-utans, besides the lead pair. The tour then moves to The Esplanade ? Theatres on the Bay and then Suntec City, which marks the backdrop for the high-octane climax.

 Leading tours and travel agencies in India are waiting for the Rs 50-crore blockbuster to release ? this Friday ? before they introduce the Krrish tour in association with the Singapore Tourism Board (STB). 

 Three agencies, including Cox amp; Kings and SOTC, are finalising the details of the tour that should be a three-day-two-night trip around Singapore, a source in STB said. 

 A co-production between Rakesh Roshans Filmkraft and the Singapore board, over 60 per cent of Krrish was shot in the Lion City in a 60-day schedule in end-2005. 

 The second half of my script demanded a foreign location and Singapore proved to be the ideal balance between modernity and traditions, Rakesh says. The city is foreign but not alien having as much wide spaces as it has towering skyscrapers.

 With the STB having its Film in Singapore scheme ? inviting filmmakers around the world to come and shoot movies in the city ? Krrish was always travelling to the Far East.

 It was like an arranged marriage between two consenting parties, says Ken Low, its assistant chief executive, brand and communications. Having only produced films locally under our scheme, now we are finally ready to present Singapore to the worldwide audience under the experienced vision of Rakesh Roshan.

 And if Rakeshs track record is anything to go by, the STB has got a winner on their hands. Before the release of Kaho Naa? Pyar Hai, the annual Indian tourist count to New Zealand was 5,000 and, after it became a hit, the number went up to 25 lakh.

 The STB has found two automatic brand ambassadors in Hrithik and Priyanka. 

 While Hrithik calls the Lion City his favourite city in the world and the only deserved candidate to sport the tag of the global food capital, Priyanka confesses: Despite shooting for 60 days, I came back within two months for a holiday in the same city. Doesnt that say a lot about the city?

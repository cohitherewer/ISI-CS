 Lalu case

 New Delhi, July 25: The Supreme Court today directed the registrar-general of Patna High Court to appear before it tomorrow for clarifications on the procedure for appointment of the special judge hearing cases against Lalu Prasad and his wife Rabri Devi.

 A three-judge bench issued the order as records on the appointment did not specifically mention if the matter was placed before a full bench of the high court.

 The apex court was hearing a public interest litigation by Bihar deputy chief minister Sushil Modi and Rajiv Ranjan Singh Lallan objecting to the promotion of the special judge hearing the disproportionate assets case against the railway minister and his wife and appointment of a new judge in his place.

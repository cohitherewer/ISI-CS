 Cable classes on CAS

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 18: CAS is on the way and several viewers are still clueless about what it means. To clear the air, telecom regulator Trai has asked the bigger cable operators to begin a one-month public awareness programme.

 The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India today issued directions to multi-system operators or MSOs who distribute signals to the smaller cable operators to start the campaign before October 15.

 CAS has to be implemented in notified areas of Delhi, Calcutta and Mumbai by December 31. Todays order indicates that Trai is pushing for that deadline.

 Under the system, a set-top box has to be rented or bought and one can pick channels and pay for them only. 

 The MSOs have been asked to let Trai know about their plans two days before they begin the awareness programme. The regulator must be given details of the mode and method of campaign.

 They must also send a report with full details within two days of completing the campaign.

 Asked what shape the campaign is likely to take, Roop Sharma, who heads the Cable Operators Federation of India, suggested that MSOs can use channels showing their own programmes or films to broadcast details about CAS.

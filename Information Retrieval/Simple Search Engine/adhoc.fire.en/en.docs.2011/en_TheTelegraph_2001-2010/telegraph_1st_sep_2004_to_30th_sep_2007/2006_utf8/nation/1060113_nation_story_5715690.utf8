 Job offer ends steel town siege

 OUR BUREAU

 Jan. 12: Tribals have lifted their economic blockade on Rourkela after they were given a conditional assurance that those genuinely displaced would be given jobs.

 The end of the blockade eased pressure on the Rourkela Steel Plant, the raw material supply of which was affected.

 The tribals had squatted on rail tracks near the town, demanding return of surplus land acquired for the steel plant in 1954 and jobs for the families of the displaced.

 The blockade, which had paralysed train services on the Howrah-Mumbai main line since Tuesday morning, was withdrawn at 4 am following a seven-hour discussion among tribal leaders, the revenue divisional commissioner and senior executives of Rourkela Steel. 

 The officials assured the tribal representatives that the verification process of unemployed oustees would be done within the next two months. Besides, the commissioner would apprise the government of the surplus land that the plant has.

 The tribal leaders said they have been given a written assurance that a notification would be issued inviting applications from oustees who had not been provided with jobs. The applications would be verified and genuine applicants would be offered jobs, subject to availability and suitability.

 The plant has been asked to extend the limit of its peripheral development plan from 8 km to 100 km of the boundary.

 Voice Amars: Lab 

 OUR BUREAU

 Hyderabad/New Delhi, Jan. 25: The Central Forensic Science Laboratory (CFSL) in Hyderabad today confirmed that the voice in the Amar Singh tape belonged to the Samajwadi Party leader.

 Experts at the laboratory said there was nothing unusual or questionable in the tape, obtained by alleged tapping of Amars phone, but added that they hadnt been sent the entire tape.

 Delhi police, however, denied it had forwarded Amars voice sample to the laboratory. We never gave any voice sample to the CFSL, said Karnal Singh, the joint commissioner investigating the case.

 A laboratory source confirmed this but explained: We could gather his (Amars) voice samples locally from television news clippings, which we compared with the CD sent from Delhi.

 A Union home ministry source explained that the law doesnt allow the police to take Amars voice samples without his consent.

 Even if Amars voice samples were sent to the CFSL, Delhi police cannot admit this, for they can be taken to court, the source said, adding that a sample was indeed taken to clarify doubts relating to an important matter. He did not reveal what the matter could be.

 The Delhi police said they hadnt received the labs report yet.

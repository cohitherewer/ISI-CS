 Sanjay drive in contempt trap

 Mumbai, Dec. 8: A signature campaign that Bollywood plans in support of Sanjay Dutt could bring contempt charges but the organisers are unfazed, at least for now.

 Leading film stars are expected to be in the forefront of the December 12 campaign, planned by some two dozen associations of producers, actors and technicians.

 Bollywood argues its objective is not to undermine the Tada (anti-terror) courts verdict against Sanjay but to express gratitude towards a man who has contributed a lot to the industry. But special public prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam isnt convinced.

 Bollywood organising a public campaign of this nature would tend to mount pressure on the judicial administration to show leniency towards Sanjay Dutt (who awaits his sentencing), Nikam told The Telegraph from his hometown, Jalgaon.

 This is interference in the judicial process and I would not hesitate to launch contempt of court proceedings against the organisers.

 Nikam argued that Bollywood was rallying around Sanjay only because he is a matinee idol. Why isnt it holding a similar campaign for the other accused convicted under the same sections?

 The actor has been nailed under Sections 3 and 7 of the Arms Act for possessing an AK-56 rifle and a 9mm pistol, but has been cleared of terrorism charges. Seven others who either transported, stored or tried to destroy the weapons allegedly on Sanjays instructions were convicted under the same sections.

 Nikam said the film industry had mounted a similar campaign in 1993-94 when Sanjay was arrested. Rallyists held banners outside Thane jail and shouted: Sanju baba, we are with you.

 Sanjay Dutts supporters have every right to adopt legal remedies available for his release, but a signature campaign is an attempt to capitalise on public sympathy for a matinee idol.

 Dharmesh Tiwari, general secretary of Cine and TV Artistes Association, ex- pressed surprise at Nikams objections.

 I am not aware of the legalities raised by Nikam. We have already clarified that it is not our intention to disrespect the judicial verdict, he said.

 We are merely organising a signature campaign to express our feelings for Sanjay. There will be no morcha, no banners and no mercy appeals. We are not going to either submit the signatures to the Tada court or take any legal steps.

 Asked whether the industry would go ahead with the programme, Tiwari said: Yes. Our committee has not discussed this yet. We will discuss it and check if this amounts to any legal violations.

 The top Bollywood stars likely to participate in the campaign are in Malaysia for a global film awards ceremony. They are expected back on Sunday night.

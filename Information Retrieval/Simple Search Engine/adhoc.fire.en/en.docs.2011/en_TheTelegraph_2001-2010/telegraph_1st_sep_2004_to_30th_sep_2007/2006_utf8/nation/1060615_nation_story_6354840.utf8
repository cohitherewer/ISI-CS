 Skys limit for Nepal flights

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 14: More flights to and from Nepal may be in the pipeline with civil aviation officials working on a plan to review the air service agreement between the two sides.

 The move follows Indias assurance to Nepal Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koir-ala that it would allow his countrys airlines to operate unlimited number of flights to this side of the border.

 Civil aviation minister Praful Patel had met a Nepalese team during Koir-alas visit here. Part of Delhis Rs 1,000-crore aid package to Kathmandu is for development of airports.

 Nepals ministry of culture, civil aviation and tourism is expected to invite its Indian counterpart for talks.

 Discussions will also be held on expanding the number of seats on flights. Under the current arrangement, Indian and Nepalese airlines share 6,000 seats every week. 

 Nepal ? its aircraft can land only in Mumbai, New Delhi, Calcutta, Chennai, Varanasi and Bangalore ? wants to cover a few more Indian destinations but is held back by the seat restriction.

 India has promised to open up 18 destinations for Nepal. The move, officials said, is part of the governments open-sky policy, particularly for South Asian countries. However, Nepal seems to be interested in only two places ? Dehra Dun in Uttaranchal and Bagdogra in Bengal.

 Reports from Nepal said the country would look for speedy security clearance for its aircraft entering Indian skies. Delays often lead to wastage of crucial flying time. 

 In return for Indias open-sky favours, Nepal has offered Indian carriers access to destinations in China and Hong Kong. The move is going to be profitable for Nepal as well, as it will generate revenue.

 Another issue the two sides are looking to settle is the re-arranging of Indian routes, which Nepal feels is too circuitous. A straight-line route is being chalked out that will reduce flight time and help cut costs.

 Evidence left to be trampled under countless feet

Conspiracy smoke rises

 Meerut/ Delhi, April 11: Evidence that could establish what started the fire at Victoria park ? electrical short-circuit, as is being suspected, or a cylinder blast ? might have already been lost.

 Hours after the blaze raced through the consumer goods fair, killing at least 35, hundreds of people ? traders trying to salvage their stuff, mediapersons and the plain curious ? were trampling all over the place.

 Nitin Rastogi, who had set up a water filter stall, was one of those rummaging through the rubble. Thats my laptop, he pointed at an unrecognisable metal-and-plastic lump.

 It wasnt just the individuals. The administration allowed rubble to be shifted about mechanically using excavators before forensic experts were called, sources said. Reports said this helped recover a couple of charred bodies from the debris.

 But it also spawned theories of an administration conspiracy. Was the administration trying to dump the bodies along with the rubble? some asked.

 The charge has caught the imagination of people shaken by the fire, especially since it explains the low death toll.

 How can you have only 50 dead in a fire like that, a man argued before a small group around him at the city morgue. The police had yesterday said 45 had died, but revised the toll to 35 today.

 N.S. Sager of Meeruts Progressive Advocates Association, who agrees with this line, and some other association members briefly prostrated before an excavator last night, but gave up when the police trained water hoses on them.

 Experts say that after a fire, not caused by a bomb explosion, is extinguished, nothing should be disturbed till the site has been inspected for an electrical malfunction.

 A short-circuit is widely being blamed for the fire that swallowed three air-conditioned pandals, packed with stalls selling televisions, computers and other home appliances, in five minutes. The first fire tenders had arrived in minutes ? they are located close to Victoria park ?but could do little.

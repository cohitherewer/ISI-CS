 Profit plea no threat

 Manmohan Singh, P. 

 Chidambaram

 New Delhi, Aug. 26: The Congress today dismissed the petition seeking disqualification of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and finance minister P. Chidambaram for holding offices of profit, saying the trustees of the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation fall in the list of posts exempted by the recently passed profit bill.

 The RGF is a private trust where trustees do not get any emoluments. Over the years, several senior Congress leaders have been on the RGF trust, Congress leader Janardan Dwivedi said.

 Three days ago, the President had referred the petition filed by Rakesh Kumar to the Election Commission for its opinion, creating a fresh controversy just as the dust over the disqualification issue appeared to have settled after A.P.J. Abdul Kalam gave his assent to the legislation.

 Kumars petition sought the disqualification of Singh and Chidambaram on the ground that they held offices of profit as RGF trustees.

 Chief election commissioner N. Gopalaswami told reporters in Dehra Dun today that the poll body would examine the petition. We received this complaint only three days ago. We will find out the exact position like the date of appointment and benefits, if any, he reportedly said, adding that the poll panel would take some time to probe the complaint.

 Sources in the panel, however, said now that the office of profit bill has become an act, being a trustee of the RGF would not attract disqualification.

 The Parliament (Prevention of Disqualification) Amendment Act, 2006, which lists 55 offices that have been given immunity, does not specifically mention the RGF. But the office of chairperson or trustee (by whatever name it is called) of any trust, whether public or private, has been exempted from being considered an office of profit.

 Sources in the poll panel said there is no ambiguity in the act on these posts and, therefore, no action can be taken against the Prime Minister and the finance minister.

 The sources said the reference made by the President is nothing but part of a routine procedure to obtain the Election Commissions opinion.

 The BJP, on its part, has made it clear that it has nothing to do with the petition. We do not know who the petitioner is, Satyapal Jain, the person in charge of the partys legal cell, said.

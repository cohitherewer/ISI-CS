 Israelis molested

 Shimla, July 1: A youth was arrested in Dalhousie today for allegedly molesting and looting two Israeli women, one of whom clicked his picture as he was molesting her friend, reports our correspondent.

 Ruth Abraham, 20, and Yella, 22, arrived in Dalhousie, 260 km from Shimla, on Thursday and were keen to visit the hill station of Khajiar, known as the Switzerland of Himachal Pradesh.

 The police said when the women were on their way on foot to Khajiar, they met the accused, Vipin Kumar, who introduced himself as a tour guide. He misguided them to a nearby forest and when the three reached a place called Panjpulla, which was deserted, the 20-year-old molested the Israeli tourists. 

 The accused also snatched Rs 9,000 in cash, a music system, travellers cheques and a cellphone from the women.

 He will be produced in court on Sunday, Diwakar Sharma, the Dalhousie DSP, said.

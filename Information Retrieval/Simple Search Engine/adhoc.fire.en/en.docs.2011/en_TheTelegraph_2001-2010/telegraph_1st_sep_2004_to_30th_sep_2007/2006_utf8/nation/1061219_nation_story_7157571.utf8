 Mrs okay, Yashodhara 

drops royal address

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Bhopal, Dec. 18: Yashodhara Raje Scindia wants to be addressed as Mrs instead of shrimant (highness). 

 Scindia, who holds the tourism and sports portfolios, wants chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan to restore the Mrs title before her name instead of the regal shrimant. The Gwalior royal family scion wants the November 1 gazette notification, asking authorities to address her in the new way, quashed. 

 The 51-year-old former NRI now says she had sought the feudal title for the sake of uniformity, claiming shrimant preceded her name on electoral rolls. 

 Shedding the regal badge might not be easy, though. Sources close to Chauhan say a section of the BJP hostile to Scindia will question why the chief minister junked democratic norms to oblige her in the first place. A proposal to delete the title will have to be moved to the governor and a fresh gazette notification issued.

 The Congress is already in attack mode. A mere letter wont do. She should offer a public apology. The chief minister, too, must explain why the title was given and why hes withdrawing it now, spokesman Manak Aggarwal said.

 A stressed-out Chauhan, who has returned from a trip abroad to find his health minister threatening to resign over a fight with the Speaker and the power minister sulking over a tiff with the governor, is taking lessons from Baba Ramdev on performing the surya namaskar (Sun salutation).

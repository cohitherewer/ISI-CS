 Blue Ice catches chill

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Chandigarh, Dec. 18: The lights dimmed as the music fell silent. Then they went out. By evening, the locks were in place. The chill had got through to Blue Ice.

 As news of Manu Sharmas conviction in the Jessica Lal murder case filtered in, the crowd at his two- storey bar-cum-restaurant-cum-night club the towns hippest hangout for the young as well as the old started thinning. Soon, the last of the revellers had quietly filed out.

 We are shutting down because of the coming municipal elections. All bars have been asked to down shutters by evening today, mumbled an employee.

 Other restaurants with bars, however, remained open. The ban was only for liquor.

 Also open was the restaurant in the hotel owned by the family, Picadilly. Only the bar was closed.

 We came to have some fun, dance around a bit. But it is closed. They could have just shut the bar. Why have they done away with the music? complained Jasmine, a party animal still loitering outside the restaurant with some of her friends.

 They are mourning by shutting a place that offers enjoyment to hundreds daily.

 Blue Ice was not the only place to have caught the chill. All work stopped at the Haryana secretariat after the news came in that Delhi High Court had ordered Manus arrest in the seven-and-a-half-year-old case.

 Efforts to locate Manu provide futile. Father Venod Sharma, a powerful Congress politician and former minister in the Bhupinder Singh Hooda cabinet, was said to be in New Delhi arranging for yet another defence for his son in the Supreme Court. Phone calls to his mobile went unanswered.

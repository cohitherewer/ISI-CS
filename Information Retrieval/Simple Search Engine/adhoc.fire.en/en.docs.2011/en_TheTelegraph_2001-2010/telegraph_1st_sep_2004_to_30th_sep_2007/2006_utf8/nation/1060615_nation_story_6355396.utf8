 Trinamul boycott

 Calcutta, June 14: The Trinamul Congress will boycott the budget session of the Assembly because Speaker Hashim Abdul Halim will not allow the Opposition the same time as the government to speak on the governors address and the Bengal budget. 

 This is discrimination, said Trinamul legislature party leader Partha Chatterjee. 

 The Left Front and the Opposition got about 50 per cent votes each in the Assembly elections. So, the Opposition should be given equal time, Chatterjee said after walking out of the House in protest against the Speakers decision.

 The Speaker had first said the time given should be on the basis of the parties floor strength and then offered 40 per cent of the time, which Trinamul rejected.

 Rs 1000 cr in Prasar pocket

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 5: For a public broadcaster, Prasar Bharati says it has become quite good at making money.

 In the just-ended financial year, its revenues crossed the Rs 1,000-crore mark for the first time. Nearly a third of the money came from cricket.

 Doordarshan grossed Rs 960 crore and All India Radio Rs 270 crore in 2005-06. That adds up to Rs 1,230 crore, which translates into a little over Rs 1,000 crore in net revenue.

 Honestly, it is a surprise for us, Prasar Bharati chief executive officer K.S. Sarma told reporters today. The previous year, Prasar Bharati earned Rs 831 crore, making this years increase over 30 per cent.

 Though he did not have figures, Sarma said Prasar Bharati might have grossed higher revenues than any private broadcaster over the year.

 Unlike the private players, Prasar Bharati is not aiming at making a profit. It spends more ? about Rs 1,800 crore a year ? on running the show. But it is a good earning-spending ratio for a public broadcaster, Sarma said. Anything higher, he added, would be crassly commercial.

 Sarma played down the contribution of earnings through cricket telecast rights. He said in most years, cricket adds only about Rs 100 crore to the kitty. But this year, the game contributed more ? about Rs 300 crore ? including money it was owed from earlier years.

 Prasar Bharati said its marketing of the 2005 India-Pakistan series generated Rs 180 crore and that of the India-Sri Lanka-South Africa series the same year brought in Rs 140 crore.

 The public broadcaster has also been making more money than in earlier years by directly selling advertisement slots for Hindi blockbuster movies, instead of giving agencies the right to do so. It hopes to raise over Rs 100 crore every year through this.

 Prasar Bharati is also exploring money-spinning schemes at the local level. For example, the Doordarshan station at Salem made Rs 50 lakh last year by scrolling advertising messages on television screens like some private channels do. In the coming years, Doordarshan hopes to earn up to Rs 500 crore a year through this alone.

 Sarma, however, said that Doordarshan often loses its young journalists to private channels which offer higher salaries. The public broadcaster was also slow in breaking news, he added.

 The chief executive officer said Doordarshan would use some of the extra money it earned to set things right.

 DD News has to improve, there are no two views about it, Sarma said.

 However, he and his colleagues dismissed suggestions that Doordarshan news lacked credibility. Doordarshan puts news on air only after verifying it, director-general Navin Kumar said. Our news is always authentic, it is never wrong.

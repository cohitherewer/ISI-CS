 Hang me if I am guilty: Salman

 Salman: Seeking fast trial

 Jodhpur, Jan. 12 (PTI): Hang me if I am guilty, Salman Khan pleaded in a court here while seeking early disposal of the black buck poaching cases of 1998.

 Main pareshan ho gaya hoon. Mujhe phansi par chadha do agar doshi hoon to aur mukadme ka faisla jaldi se kar do (I am disturbed. Hang me if I am guilty but decide the case at the earliest), the actor told chief judicial magistrate B.K. Jain.

 Salman is facing trial on charges of killing the protected wild animals on October 11, 1998, when he was in Jodhpur for the shooting of Sooraj Barjatyas Hum Saath Saath Hain.

 Public prosecutor Jeevan Ram Choudhary said Salman made the appeal after recording his statement in the Ghoda farm case, along with five others. 

 The actors plea was not in the court records as he made the gesture after recording the statement in the form of a request, the prosecutor said.

 Salmans counsel Hastimal Sarswat said the actor told the judge that he was innocent and was falsely implicated in the poaching cases.

 The court today also began the final arguments in the case pertaining to hunting black buck in the Bhavad farm on the same day. Actor Satish Shah was present during the hearing, the counsel said.

 The actors and the others were booked under the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, by Jodhpur police for hunting the endangered species of deer in the two farms.

 The police cordoned off the court premises as a large number of people gathered to catch a glimpse of Salman.

 The argument will continue tomorrow and all the accused will be present in court, Sarswat said.

 Bollywood burst on British charts

 London (PTI): 

 Eleven of the 20 most successful foreign-language films 

 released in the UK last year were from India, a media report 

 said on Sunday. 

 A record 74 Bollywood films were 

 released in the UK last year, compared with 61 entirely 

 British productions, it said.

 In 2004, the Indian film industry was worth around 2.4 billion, and it is projected to grow by 18 per cent each year in the foreseeable future, the Sunday Times said.

 According to the report, The Merchants of Bollywood, a spectacular song-and-dance theatre production, directed by Toby Gough, is due to begin touring Britain next month.

 The idea for the show originated from his friend Mark Brady, a producer based in Sydney with whom he had previously worked. I kept reading so much about what was happening in Bollywood, that I called Toby and said I was putting him on a plane to Mumbai to check out the possibilities.

 Nod to sack for crime blot

 services were terminated in 1984 on the ground that he had

 of possessing charas.

 Although the trial court had acquitted him, he had denied he was arrested and gave a false declaration at the time of his appointment by the MCD.

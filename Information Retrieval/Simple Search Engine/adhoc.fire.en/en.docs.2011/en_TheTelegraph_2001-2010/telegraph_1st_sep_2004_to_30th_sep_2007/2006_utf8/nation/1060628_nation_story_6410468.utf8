 Child death arrest

 Mumbai, June 27: Another member of the Gajaria family has been arrested in connection with the rape and murder of a 10-year-old domestic help in Lokhandwala Complex, home to many film stars. 

 After 64-year-old retired marine engineer Vinod Gajaria, his 60-year-old wife Madhu and son Rajendra, 28 ? who are already in custody ? the police today arrested Gajarias daughter Roma Bhatia, who lives in the same building.

 Oshiwara police had found Sonu Salve dead in the third-floor flat of Gajaria at Galactica Housing Society in the plush complex in Andheri on June 21. 

 The Gajarias had told the police that Sonu committed suicide by hanging herself from the ceiling. But an autopsy revealed that the girl had injuries in her private parts, neck and mouth, indicating that she was sexually assaulted and then strangled. 

 Roma today said she visited her parents at 5 pm that day but did not see anything amiss. But the post-mortem report said Sonu had died around 4.

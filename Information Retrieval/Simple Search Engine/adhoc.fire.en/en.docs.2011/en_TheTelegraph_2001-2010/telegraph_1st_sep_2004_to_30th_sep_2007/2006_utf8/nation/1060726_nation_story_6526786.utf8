 Dissidence replay in Shillong, CM shaky

 OUR BUREAU AND AGENCIES

 July 25: Dissidence has 

 flared up again in the Congress-led government in Meghalaya, 

 raising the spectre of a second leadership change in less 

 than six weeks. 

 By evening, chief minister J.D. Rymbai appeared resigned to the prospect of being asked to relinquish charge. D.D. Lapang, who was forced to step down on June 15, has landed in Delhi, pushing for his reinstatement. 

 Claiming the support of 20 of the Congresss 28 MLAs in the 60-member Assembly, Lapang had a brief meeting with the party general secretary in charge of Meghalaya, Oscar Fernandes, in New Delhi in the evening.

 Lapang is learnt to have told Fernandes that Rymbai does not enjoy the confidence of coalition partners in Shillong and his performance in the Assembly was unimpressive.

 Lapang is likely to meet Congress president Sonia Gandhi tomorrow after which a clear picture is expected to emerge.

 In Shillong, asked whether he was contemplating stepping down voluntarily, Rymbai said: I am waiting for an AICC communiqu?. Only after it comes through shall I make up my mind. 

 I was always with Lapang, even when his leadership was challenged, Rymbai added. Those who made me chief minister are now back-stabbing me. 

 The septuagenarian Congress leader claimed to have agreed to become chief minister only because his predecessor ? then under fire from his flock ? suggested that he take over as the alternative leader. 

 On what transpired at the meeting between him and Congress chief Sonia Gandhi in New Delhi last week, he said: I was asked about dissent by some MLAs, but I thought everything was under control and that is what I told the AICC president. I told her that I would visit all district headquarters and monitor development activities as I felt that there was no serious problem.

 Rymbai got a taste of rebellion the very day he assumed office. Several MLAs expressed annoyance at not being included in the 12-member ministry in return for their support.

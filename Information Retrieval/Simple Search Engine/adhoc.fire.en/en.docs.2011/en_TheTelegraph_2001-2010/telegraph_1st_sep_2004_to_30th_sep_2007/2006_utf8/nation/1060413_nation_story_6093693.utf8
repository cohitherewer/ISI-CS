 Heads roll after tragedy

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, April 12: Two days after a consumer fair blaze left dozens dead, heads began to roll in the Meerut administration. 

 The district magistrate, the additional district magistrate, the senior superintendent of police and two other officers have been removed from their posts with immediate effect.

 DM Ram Krishna has been replaced by Mukesh Meshram and Navneet Sikera will sit on SSP Rajiv Sabbarwaals chair, an official release said.

 Krishna has been sent to the planning department and Sabbarwaal has been posted as the commandant of the Provincial Armed Constabulary in Gorakhpur, Satish Agarwal, principal secretary, home, said. ADM (city) Sirish Kumar Dubey has not been given any new assignment till the probe is over.

 The transfers were ordered to ensure a fair probe into lapses, if any, by district officers in granting permission to the fair at Meeruts Victoria park.

 State chief secretary Naveen Chandra Vajpayee said Dubey was found prima facie responsible for allowing the fair to take place without completing the formalities and gathering compliance reports from other departments.

 Earlier in the day, the ADM said his role was merely to judge if the fair would cause any law and order problem. I cannot take the responsibility for how the other departments like fire service and power corporation had cleared the proposal for the fair.

 Vajpayee did not divulge what action would be taken against the DM and the other officers. 

 The Uttar Pradesh government today paved the way for bringing the DM and the other district officers under the scanner by upgrading the probe.

 Instead of the Meerut chief development officer, who works under the district magistrate, the inquiry will now be conducted by divisional commissioner Mohindar Singh. 

 The state chief secretary said Singh has been informed about the assignment and has been asked to submit his report at the earliest. 

 A cabinet meeting today cleared the decks for a judicial probe into the circumstances that led to the fire and lapses in giving the fair the go-ahead, Vajpayee said. 

 The probe report would also recommend steps the government should take to ensure such tragedies do not recur. 

 Vajpayee clarified that the probe would not interfere with the judicial inquiry. 

 The Mulayam Singh Yadav government today decided to raise the ex-gratia for those wounded in the blaze.

 The critically injured would receive Rs 1 lakh instead of Rs 50,000 and those with minor injuries Rs 50,000 in place of Rs 25,000.

 New Delhi, March 31: The Centre is in favour of classrooms on the ground and first floors to ensure safe evacuation of children in case of emergencies.

 It has said offices and administrative wings can be housed on the upper floors of multi-storeyed school buildings.

 Draft guidelines submitted to the Supreme Court today by additional solicitor-general Amrender Sharan also recommended setting up of boards for educational buildings at the national, state and district levels to look into safety measures in existing and future school buildings. 

 The recommendations were presented after a bench headed by Justice Ruma Pal heard a PIL seeking guidelines on students safety. 

 The petition cited the fire in a Tamil Nadu school that killed 94 children and left scores scarred for life. A kitchen fire, on which a mid-day meal was being cooked, had spread to the thatched roof of Saraswati English Medium School in Kumbakonam in July 2004. 

 Located on the narrow Kasiraman Street, the school did not have proper ventilation. The building consisted of two blocks joined together. The first had four floors and the second, where the blaze struck, was a two-storeyed structure with a thatched roof housing primary classes. 

 The tragedy had sparked widespread anger over unsafe infrastructure in schools across the country.

 After hearing the plea today, the Supreme Court asked the Centre and other parties for suggestions. 

 The governments draft guidelines have recommended that the National Board for Educational/School Buildings consist of a panel of experts. At the district level, the boards should have people working at the grassroots level.

 Board members should be given the power to grant or cancel licences after inspecting various aspects such as the width of staircases. They should also be entrusted with the task of giving clearance on setting up a school after considering its proximity to industries discharging toxic wastes and polluting gases. They should see to it that fire stations, hospitals and police stations are nearby.

 Other steps suggested by the additional attorney-general include drills and mock tests for students, teachers and staff to ascertain their presence of mind in crisis.

 The court has sought the response of state governments on the draft guidelines.

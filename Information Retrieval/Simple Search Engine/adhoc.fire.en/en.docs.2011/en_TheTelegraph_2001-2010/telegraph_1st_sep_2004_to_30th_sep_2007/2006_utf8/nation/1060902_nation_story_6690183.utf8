 Poll panel to close profit probe

 Chidambaram (top) and Chatterjee: 

 Relief

New 

 Delhi, Sept. 1: Abiding by the legislation on offices 

 of profit, the Election Commission today decided to close 

 disqualification cases against 40 MPs, including Prime Minister 

 Manmohan Singh, Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee and 

 finance minister P. Chidambaram.

 The commission officially denied having taken any such decision, but it was learnt that the full panel had discussed the pending disqualification petitions in the light of Parliament (Prevention of Disqualification) Amendment Act, 2006.

 It then decided to send a common opinion to President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam. The commission will soon send its opinion, most likely a common one, as the cases are similar, commission sources said.

 Kalam gave his assent to the disqualification prevention bill a day after Parliament approved the setting up of a joint committee to define what constitutes such an office. Presidential assent to the law with retrospective effect was expected to provide relief to MPs.

 Chief election commissioner N. Gopalaswamy said on August 19 that the panel would abide by the legislation in deciding on disqualification petitions.

 Since Jaya Bachchan was stripped of Rajya Sabha membership, a trend of filing disqualification petitions against MPs had picked up. Petitions were filed against some 52 MPs and over 250 MLAs.

 Although the commission cleared many petitions, cases remained pending against 40 MPs. Then a petition seeking the disqualification of Singh and Chidambaram came up.

 The petitions became a headache for the CPM as several were filed against Bengal leaders by Trinamul Congress general secretary Mukul Roy. Among them were CPM MPs Chatterjee, Nilotpal Basu, Amitava Nandy, Mohammad Salim and Hannan Mollah.

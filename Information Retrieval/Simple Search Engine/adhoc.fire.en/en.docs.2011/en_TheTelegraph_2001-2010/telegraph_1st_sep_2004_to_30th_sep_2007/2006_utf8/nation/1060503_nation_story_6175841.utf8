 Hyderabad, May 2: K. Suryanarayanas second wife was present at his Hyderabad home when his body was brought back last evening and at the funeral this morning even as his widow Manjula lay unconscious in hospital.

 Son Satyateja lit the pyre, watched by a handful of police officials, representatives of the Bahrain company Al Moyyad that the engineer worked for, and Gogula Swapna Reddy, who appeared yesterday claiming to be his second wife and seeking a share of the compensation.

 Al Moyyad CEO Pankaj Sehgal said Suryanarayana had violated the security code and gone out without armed escort and, therefore, the family might not get the Rs 25-lakh insurance claim. But the company will give them Rs 20 lakh as compensation. 

 The engineer was kidnapped on Friday and killed the next day.

 The state and the Centre have already announced Rs 5 lakh each as compensation.

 Swapna, who claims Suryanarayana had married her in 2002, has demanded a share for her one-year-old daughter Nidhisha, allegedly fathered by the engineer. Suryanarayanas family has informed her family that something would be worked out once the formalities are through, sources said.

 Manjula, rushed to hospital yesterday after consuming hydrochloric acid, is in the intensive care unit of the Asian Institute of Gastroenterology where she was shifted this morning after her condition deteriorated, father-in-law K. Chandrasekhar said.

 Her stomach is badly damaged due to over-consumption of acid. There is lot of damage to her liver also, said Dr Nageswar Reddy, the institutes director. She will stay under observation for 48 hours. 

 In view of her condition and the appearance of the second wife, the funeral was kept low key and all the rites completed before 10 am. 

 Swapna said at the crematorium that she was not after money or property. I just want the family to treat me as their daughter-in-law and also consider my daughter as their granddaughter. All my agitation is aimed at achieving that objective only, she said. 

 Sources said Suryanarayanas and Swapnas families hailed from the same village in Warangal and knew of their affair, but had turned a blind eye to it.

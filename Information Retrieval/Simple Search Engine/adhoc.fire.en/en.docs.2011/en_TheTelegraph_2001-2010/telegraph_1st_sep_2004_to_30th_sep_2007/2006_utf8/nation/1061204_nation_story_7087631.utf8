 Slipper fury at outlet

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Jabalpur, Dec. 3: Chanting Jai Shri Ram, Bajrang Dal activists stormed a footwear store here and smashed everything inside including pictures of Lord Krishna to protest the sale of slippers they allege was depicting Hindu gods. 

 The owner of the store, Praveen Sethi, rejected the charge, saying the allegedly offending footwear imported from Indonesia has been on sale since 2000. And how can they be representing religion when they themselves vandalised and broke pictures of Lord Krishna in my store? 

 The slippers have swastika-like symbols encircling a face.

 In a BJP-ruled state, nobody will be permitted to hurt Hindu sentiment and get away with it, VHP convener Mayaram Jaswani said, justifying the ransacking. 

 Police chief Siddharth Chaudhury claimed his men dispersed the mob in time.

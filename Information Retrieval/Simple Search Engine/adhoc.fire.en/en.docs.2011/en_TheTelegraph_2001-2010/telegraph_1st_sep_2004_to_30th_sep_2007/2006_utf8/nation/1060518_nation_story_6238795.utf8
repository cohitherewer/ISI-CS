 SC query puts BCCI in a spot

 New Delhi, May 17 (PTI): The Indian cricket board today found itself in an awkward situation when the Supreme Court asked why it was putting its weight behind a particular group in the battle between two Himachal Pradesh associations.

 To the BCCIs embarrassment, a vacation bench asked why it had filed a transfer petition when it was not a party (in a case) before the high court.

 The bench was hearing a plea by the Rajinder Zar-led association, which is loyal to board chief Sharad Pawar, and the BCCI seeking transfer of a plea filed by the rival group before Himachal Pradesh High Court.

 The bench said when neither the BCCI nor the Zar-led association was a party to the petition filed by the Anurag Thakur-led association, how could they approach the court on an issue raised by Zar.

 The Thakur-led group had challenged the Himachal Pradesh Sports (Registration, Recognition and Regulation) Act under which Zar had formed a parallel association, whose registration was stayed by the high court in January.

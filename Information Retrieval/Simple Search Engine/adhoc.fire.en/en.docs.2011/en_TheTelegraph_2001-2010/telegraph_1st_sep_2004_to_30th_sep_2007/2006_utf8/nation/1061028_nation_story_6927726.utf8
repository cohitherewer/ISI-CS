 Mumbai, Oct. 27: If you have enjoyed the remade Don and wish you could be in the thick of the action, this mobile games just the thing for you.

 Created by Hungama Mobile, the game was unveiled today by Shah Rukh Khan in Mumbai, with the films producer Ritesh Sidhwani and director Farhan Akhtar by his side.

 The game is available in two versions a Race and Chase on the streets of Kuala Lumpur with the Petronas Towers in the background, and a role-playing game.

 The Race and Chase offers the player a chance to outfox Don and capture him. In the other game, the player has to help Shah Rukh find the secret disc, which he desperately seeks to be able to prove he isnt the Don but a victim of mistaken identity.

 Shah Rukh, an avid gamer himself, said: I am a great fan of video games, and this game is just fantastic. I jumped at the very idea of this game and have already tried my hand at it. Mind you, its just as exciting as the movie itself but only here you get to be part of all the action in fact, do all the action yourself.

 Neeraj Roy, MD and CEO, Hungama Mobile, said: Our creative and gaming team visited Kuala Lumpur in May 2006 for the making of the movie, during which there were sessions with the editor and director to understand the flow and decide on game play. The team came back to India, worked on the concept, created a storyboard and later created the virtual game.

 They watched the movie rushes including the car crashes in Kuala Lumpur, skydiving and some of the fight sequences and have incorporated all those hair-raising stunts in the game, Farhan said.

 To download the game, you can SMS DON to 4646 and get the option to either download mono content or rich content. After following the instructions, the consumer needs to SMS DW to 4646 to access a WAP URL. After that, the game gets downloaded on the handset with just one last click.

 The game is available on mobile and online as a multi-player game. All operators in India, including Hutch, Airtel, Reliance, Tata and Idea, will provide the game. Besides, it will also be available across the Hungama Mobile distribution network, with over 50 carriers in 20 countries.

 The industry estimates that some 8-9 million games are downloaded every year in India. Games based on cricket, Bollywood and Hollywood movies, and racing are the most popular downloads. The charges range between Rs 15 and Rs 150 per game.

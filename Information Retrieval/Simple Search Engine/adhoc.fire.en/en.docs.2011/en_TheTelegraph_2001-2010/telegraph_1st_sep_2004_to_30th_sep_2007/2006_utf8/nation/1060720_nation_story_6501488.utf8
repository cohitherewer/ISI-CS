 Lanka appeals for help

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN 

 Colombo, July 19: Sri Lanka wants the Indian Navy, which has a flotilla of four ships in the Eastern Mediterranean, to come to the aid of its citizens in Lebanon, one of whom was said to have died today.

 The woman, whose family of three had also been killed, used to work as a domestic help in Beirut, which was hit by Israeli air strikes.

 There are between 80,000 and 1 lakh Lankans in Lebanon, many of them working as domestic helps. But Colombo does not have the wherewithal ? meaning the reach to deploy assets as far away as the Mediterranean ? and its armed forces are caught up in fighting the LTTE.

 We are very keen that India should come to our aid. We have informed all our citizens that they should get in touch with our embassy in Beirut, Sri Lankan foreign ministry officials said today. 

 Till this afternoon, about 150 Lankans had registered with its embassy for evacuation. But economic and financial compulsions were weighing heavily on them.

 The officials said efforts were also on to transport Lankans to Damascus in Syria. 

 Sri Lankan officials admitted that they were helpless. Colombo is also seeking assistance from Cyprus and Greece and organisations like the International Committee of the Red Cross and Caritas.

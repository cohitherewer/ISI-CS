 Priyanka off plenary

 Priyanka: Staying out

 New Delhi, Jan. 16: Priyanka Gandhi Vadra does not figure on the list of AICC delegates from Uttar Pradesh who will attend the Congress plenary in Hyderabad from January 21.

 The state was the last to finalise its list as it was waiting for Congress president Sonia Gandhis decision on including her daughters name. 

 When the list was submitted to Sonia a week ago, there were two blanks against Rae Bareli and Sultanpur, to allow her to nominate Priyanka from either place. 

 Party sources said Priyanka did not want to be on the list. The family is apparently keen to ensure that the spotlight stays on Rahul, who is in the Uttar Pradesh team, during the three-day session.

 Although she may be invited in the category of distinguished persons, the sources said, Priyanka is not likely to come to Hyderabad. 

 Despite an invite, she had kept out of the AICC session on Rajiv Gandhis birth anniversary last year in Delhis Talkatora Stadium.

 Manmohan Singhs name, on the other hand, is on the lists of two states ? Punjab and Assam. The sources said this meant both states wanted to claim the Prime Minister as their own. Singh, who is from Punjab, was elected to the Rajya Sabha from Assam.

 Although the Congress constitution does not bar a member from being nominated as a delegate from two states, the sources said it was an exception rather than the norm.

 An oversight or over- enthusiasm might cause a name to appear in two lists, but Singhs case, it seemed to the latter, they added.

 After the Prime Ministers Rajya Sabha term ends in 2007, Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh has requested him to contest for the Lok Sabha from his state. 

 According to the Congress sources, it was also possible that Singh would opt to get re-elected to the Upper House from Punjab instead of Assam next time. Assam goes to polls this year and if the Congress does not get a majority, he may have to look for options outside.

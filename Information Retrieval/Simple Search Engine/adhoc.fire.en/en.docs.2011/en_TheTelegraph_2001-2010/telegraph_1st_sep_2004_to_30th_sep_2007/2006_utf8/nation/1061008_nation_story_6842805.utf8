 New Delhi, Oct. 7: Shiv Shankar Menon today visited the headquarters of the BJP and the CPM in an unusual step by a foreign secretary.

 The bureaucrat held a 45-minute meeting with BJP leader L.K. Advani in the morning and spent over an hour with CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury in the afternoon, virtually presenting his credentials to the Right and the Left. 

 Although Menon chose not to comment as he rushed out of A.K. Gopalan Bhavan, Yechury said it was a courtesy visit by the new foreign secretary, who also happens to be a personal friend. Its good that the government is trying to build a political consensus on various foreign policy issues, Yechury added.

 Menon, who took over last Sunday, has also sought a meeting with BJP veteran Atal Bihari Vajpayee after Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs London visit. Singh is leaving for London next week.

 A senior diplomat said: It is unusual for a foreign secretary to visit the headquarters of political parties. Normally, such things are done by ministers.

 Parliamentary committees are the only place for the foreign secretary to interact with political parties, he said. Never in my career have I come across any such move.

 But he added that the foreign secretary can brief political parties if he has specific instructions from the Prime Minister.

 Former foreign secretary M.K. Rasgotra, however, defended Menons visits, saying the current political situation is completely different from the past. We no longer have a single-party government and Left parties are crucial outside supporters. They need to be explained various foreign policy issues and there can be no better person for this than the foreign secretary.

 Refusing to consider the visits as unusual, Rasgotra said: There are instances of foreign secretaries speaking to party leaders.

 Calling the post of foreign secretary semi-political, he added: The Prime Minister must have asked him (Menon) to give a factual briefing to political parties.

 As for the issues that were discussed, Yechury said the Indo-US nuclear deal, relations with neighbours, particularly Pakistan, and Delhis role in the Non-Aligned Movement came up. We (Left and the government) have had differences of opinion on several issues. So we deliberated on them, but there was no agenda as such, the CPM leader said. 

 We have reiterated our position that the government should adhere to the common minimum programme which promises that India will follow an independent foreign policy. We will not accept any deviation.

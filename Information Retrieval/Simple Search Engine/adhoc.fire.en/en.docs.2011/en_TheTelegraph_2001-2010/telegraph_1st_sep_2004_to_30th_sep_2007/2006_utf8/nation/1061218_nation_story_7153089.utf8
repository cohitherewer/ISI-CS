 Maoists sneer at Nepal

 G. S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Hyderabad, Dec. 17: Maoists in India arent too pleased with the way their counterparts in Nepal have merged the peoples guerilla army with government forces in the Himalayan nation and signed the arms-management treaty. 

 Early December issues of CPI (Maoist) publications, Jung and Kranti, have poured scorn on the Nepal Maoist experiment that ended with the multi-party rule, calling it opportunist and anti-revolutionary.

 Much of the criticism is directed at Prachanda. Former PWG spokesman and poet P. Varavara Rao says the Nepal Maoist leaders guerilla career was short hardly 10 years and had little impact on the international Maoist movement. Till 1995, Prachanda was in Nepal parliament as a Marxist member and now he talks of the futility of Indian Maoist movement, Rao held forth in a television interview that was broadcast today. 

 Prachanda has sought to ridicule three decades of Maoist movement to share political power in the Himalayan kingdom, writes Azad, a senior member of the CPI (Maoist) central committee, in Jung. 

 Sandeep, a top gun on the Dandakaranya action committee of the CPI (Maoist), also puts the Nepal leader in the firing line. Prachanda had no right to decide the future of 20,000-strong peoples guerilla army in Nepal.

 The Indian Maoist leadership is also upset over the rejection of the idea of a red corridor, from Andhra to Nepal. Such a thing never existed and is an impossibility, Prachanda had said during his recent visit to Delhi.

 It is rather ironical and sad that Prachanda is trying to disown any relation or contact with the Indian Maoist movement. It appears he is heavily under the influence of the Chinese government, Azad said in his article.

 Prachanda says Indian Maoists are not changing with the times. Is surrendering arms, the basic instrument of the agrarian movement, what he means by changing with the times, says Rao. Nepal Maoists have been successful because of the hilly terrain and lack of communication in their country, says Rao in an apparent attempt to analyse the failures of the Indian movement.

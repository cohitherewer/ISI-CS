 Terror-struck UP turns to Khusro 

 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY

 Amir Khusro

 Lucknow, Oct.8: Having seen the ugly face of jihad in temple raids and worried that Islamic militants were finding foot soldiers among its young men, Uttar Pradesh is rediscovering Amir Khusro, the 13th century poet who spread the message of love and peace.

 Khusro has given his whole life to you, Nizam. Would you please take care of my veil (of self-respect)? sang Khusro in one of his poems.

 His birthplace, Uttar Pradesh, too, is trying to take care of its veil of self-respect. 

 In March this year, serial blasts rocked Varanasi, killing at least 20. In July last year, militants had raided Ayodhya, bringing the temple-town to the brink of communal trouble. The terrorists are also known to recruit youngsters.

 The world faces a threat from hate-mongering. Uttar Pradesh , once a home for the sufi writers and poets, unfortunately came under attack from militants who preach hate. We need to change this by promoting the message of peace and love, says Kokab Hameed, the minister for tourism.

 He is not losing time. A grand plan his department has drawn up aims to tap the states rich legacy of dervish culture and will see an entire sufi circuit coming up soon. Dervish, derived from Darwish in Persian, refers to austere Muslim ascetics. Key centres where the culture thrived will get a makeover. 

 And, on the list of places where the state tourism department will devote cash and attention is Patiali village in Etah district. This is where Khusro was born in 1253 AD before moving to Delhi with his mother in 1260 AD.

 In Delhi, where he graced the Nizams court for years, Khusro penned several of his immortal poems steeped in mysticism and romance. His tomb is also in Delhi, where he was laid to rest after his death in 1325 AD.

 Etah district authorities say it is not easy to point out the exact location in the village where the poet lived. We are trying to scan old government records to find this out, said an officer.

 Many tourists from Bangladesh, Pakistan, Malaysia and southeast Asia dont know Khusro was born in UP, said Om Prakash, principal secretary in the tourism department.

 We have despatched a research team to the village of the sufi poet. The place will be connected well with cities by roads and better transportation facilities provided so that tourists can visit the place easily, said Ram Palton, assistant secretary in the Uttar Pradesh governments directorate of tourism.

 Sufi centres in Fatehpur, Bahraich, Rae Bareli will also figure prominently on the UP tourism map. 

 The mazars will be done up and the significance of each will be explained on metal or concrete panels placed at key points. 

 But the journey of rediscovery will not end at Khusros Patiali. Devasharef, near Lucknow, which has the dargah of Haji Waris Ali Shah, a Sufi saint, is also on the list of places on which the state will lavish money and care. 

 A fair, Deva Mela, that is held during the Urs festival every year, draws pilgrims from the world over.

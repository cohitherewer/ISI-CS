 Peace pales before death in Maoist zone

 Konta (Dantewada), March 1: Peace was what they had yearned for when they carried a white flag and a picture of a pigeon to mark the beginning of their mission. Today, the colour is still the same, but the mood is not.

 The cloth used to cover the bodies of tribals killed in yesterdays Maoist bloodbath has replaced the symbols of peace. The optimism, too, is all but gone in the rebel-hit villages of Dantewada.

 Konta, a sleepy town, 500 km south of Raipur, is yet to recover from the shock of the Maoist attack in which at least 32 villagers were killed. The unofficial toll is over 50.

 The Naxalites yesterday blew up a truck near Eklagoda, about 15 km from here, in which villagers were returning from a Salwa Judum (Movement against Naxalites) meeting. They also targeted two other vehicles the villagers were travelling in and fired indiscriminately. Many villagers were taken hostage.

 A day later, the villagers are searching for answers. They want to know why the Maoists struck in such merciless fashion. They also want to know why the administration left them alone after Mondays meeting.

 Koyam Muttaiah of Errabore, a neighbouring village, said: The villagers were literally propelled to the jaws of death when they were asked to board the vehicles. 

 Yesterday, chief minister Raman Singh had said the villagers had made a mistake by choosing to travel by vehicles and not walk back home, as was the standing instruction from the government.

 On Monday, the villagers were taken to Dornapal under heavy security cover to attend the Salwa Judum meeting. But they were left on their own during the return journey as the administration had already done its job by arranging vehicles, Muttaiah pointed out.

 The villagers, who were in two trucks and a bus, stopped at Errabore police station, 3 km from the spot, and requested the policemen on duty to escort them. The tribals apparently feared some unexpected development.

 The policemen, however, assured them that they had cleared the roads and the villagers could travel without fear, said Pondu Somaiya of Fandiguda. 

 Stressing the need for more government assistance in the peace mission, deputy sarpanch of Ashirguda Gudda Raja argued: How long will they continue their struggle against the heavily-armed rebels? The governments support is imperative.

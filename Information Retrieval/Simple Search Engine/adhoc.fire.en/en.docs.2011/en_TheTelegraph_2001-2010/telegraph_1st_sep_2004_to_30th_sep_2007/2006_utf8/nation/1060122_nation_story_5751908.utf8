 Bill tabled to scrap TN test

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chennai, Jan. 21: The Tamil Nadu government today tabled a bill in the Assembly to abolish the common entrance test (CET) for state board plus-two students looking to take up professional courses.

 Students of all other boards, however, must take the test, which will be based on the syllabus of the state board so that one standard applies to all.

 The Jayalalithaa government said it had been receiving requests from parents, teachers, educationists, social activists and students to do away with the CET.

 The test has become a traumatic experience for parents and children as it appears to determine at one stroke the future of the child, the Tamil Nadu Regulation of Admission in Professional Courses Bill, 2006, said.

 The state had scrapped the test last year but was forced by the courts to restore it for the academic year 2005-06.

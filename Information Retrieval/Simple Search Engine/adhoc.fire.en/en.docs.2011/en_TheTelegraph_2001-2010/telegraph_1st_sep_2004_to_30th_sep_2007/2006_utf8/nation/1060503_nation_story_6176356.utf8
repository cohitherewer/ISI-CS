 Rushdie rap for author

 New Delhi, May 2 (PTI): Describing Kaavya Viswanathan as a victim of her own ambition, well-known writer Salman Rushdie has refused to accept the India-born novelists plea that she is innocent of plagiarism in her debut novel.

 I havent seen the book, I have seen the passages that were compared between the two books. I must say I dont accept the idea that this could have been accidentally or innocently done. The passages are too many and the similarities are too expensive, Rushdie told a news channel.

 He said he was sorry that this young girl, pushed by the needs of a publishing machine and, no doubt, by her ambition, should have fallen into this trap so early in her career. I hope she can recover from it.

 He held both author and publisher responsible for the mess.

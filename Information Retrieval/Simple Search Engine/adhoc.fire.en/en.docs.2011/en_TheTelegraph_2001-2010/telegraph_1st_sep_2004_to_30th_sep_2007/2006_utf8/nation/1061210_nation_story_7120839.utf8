 Fraud term for NRI doctor

 London, Dec. 9 (PTI): An Indian-origin doctor has been sentenced to 18 months in prison for defrauding Britains state-funded national health service of tens of thousands of pounds by falsifying patient records.

 Vinod Thapar, 62, also risked the welfare of patients who used the Silver Street Medical Centre in Edmonton, the Scotland Yard said here.

 A judge at Southwark Crown Court yesterday sentenced Thapar and ordered him to pay 37,500 compensation to Enfield and Haringey Primary Care Trust and another 40,000 towards litigation cost.

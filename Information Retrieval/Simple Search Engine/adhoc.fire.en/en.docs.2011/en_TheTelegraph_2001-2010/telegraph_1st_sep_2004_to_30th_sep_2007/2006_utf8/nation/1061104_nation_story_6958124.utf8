 Big Brother? Test for HIV

 - Check 

 must for reality show contestants 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Nov. 3: This is a first on Indian TV the 13 celebrity contestants at a Sony reality show must take HIV tests first.

 After all, the bunch of glam girls and showbiz hunks might get intimate on the programme. Even if they do, youll get to watch.

 For, the show is nothing less than an adaptation of Big Brother, where contestants spend months locked up in a house their every move picked up by microphones and cameras 24x7 until all but the winner have been eliminated one by one.

 Since the first edition of the show was aired in the Netherlands in September 1999, varied versions have been telecast in as many as 70 countries.

 A source said some of the celebs had grumbled about the HIV test but later came round. They have also been taken to psychiatrists for counselling, said S. Sikcand, Sonys chief creative head.

 After weeks of speculation, the names of the contestants are out: Rakhi Sawant, Deepak Parashar, Rahul Roy, Carol Gracias, Bobby Darling, Amit Sadh, Salil Ankola, Aryan Vaid, Rupali Ganguly, Anupama Verma, Kashmira Shah, Ragini Shetty and Ravi Kisshen.

 The men and women, who will be vying for a prize money of Rs 50 lakh, have been packed off to an undisclosed location in Karjat, 80 km from Mumbai.

 The house, where the contestants will spend 86 days without ever venturing outside, will have two huge bedrooms, a living room and a kitchen.

 Although there will be separate rooms for men and women, the bone of contention could be the washrooms, which are common.

 The house has several prayer rooms, a swimming pool and a gym. A confession room will allow contestants to interact with the audience, who will be playing Peeping Tom, aided by 28 cameras.

 Although every country has tailored its version of the show to suit its audience, the broad idea has stayed the same. 

 The housemates are allowed no contact with the outside world no TV, radio or any other media, not even writing material.

 Usually once a week, the public votes to decide which one should be evicted. The winner receives prizes that might include a huge sum, a car, a holiday even a house.

 At regular intervals, each housemate gets to privately name several fellow contestants whom he or she wants evicted. Those with the highest nominations are announced, and viewers vote on their ouster.

 Pity that in the Sony version, the cameras will not follow the celebs into the bathroom. And nude scenes, if any, will be edited out. 

 The show must go on, but with Indian sensibilities in mind.

 Cong joins Mamata on Singur 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Sept. 21: Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee today trooped into Raj Bhavan, Congress Committee leader Abdul Mannan by her side, and appealed to governor Gopal Krishna Gandhi to stop the government from acquiring farmland in Singur for the Tatas planned small-car factory.

 The joint march was seen as another sign of the warming ties between Trinamul and the Congress. The two parties had not put up candidates against each other in last weeks bypolls.

 The BJP, Trinamuls official ally, was not part of what was otherwise billed as an Opposition delegation. We got the confirmation about the appointment with the governor at 11 am. So, there wasnt time to inform everybody, Mamata said. State BJP president Tathagata Roy said he was not aware of the programme.

 Mannan said he accompanied Mamata on instructions from the Congress. If my party gives me further directives on a joint movement with Trinamul, I will follow it. Asked if the Congress was being hypocritical in opposing the Singur land takeover and favouring such acquisitions for SEZ elsewhere, Mannan chose not to reply.

 AICC general secretary in charge of Bengal, Margaret Alva, said local issues shaped the partys policy in different states. In Bengal it is this (Singur land acquisition) factor that prompted two parties to come together. In other states, land for SEZs might not be an issue, she added.

 United in Calcutta today, the Trinamul and the Congress held separate rallies on September 10 and 11 in Singur.

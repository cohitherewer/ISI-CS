 Infiltration meeting

 New Delhi, June 26 (PTI): Army chief General J.J. Singh will chair a high-level meeting on Wednesday to frame a strategy for curbing infiltration into Jammu and Kashmir.

 Union home secretary Vinod Kumar Duggal and heads of almost all paramilitary forces will attend the meeting at the army headquarters, and a joint strategy will be worked out to counter militancy, especially infiltration from Pakistan, official sources said.

 This will be the third high-level meeting in less than a fortnight to discuss the increase in infiltration in Kashmir.

 The situation is grim and a large number of foreign mercenaries have managed to enter the state from the Poonch and Mendhar sectors of Jammu region and the Kupwara belt of the Kashmir area, a senior defence official said.

 The figures till June 15 showed over 200 militants had sneaked into the state, compared with last years 75.

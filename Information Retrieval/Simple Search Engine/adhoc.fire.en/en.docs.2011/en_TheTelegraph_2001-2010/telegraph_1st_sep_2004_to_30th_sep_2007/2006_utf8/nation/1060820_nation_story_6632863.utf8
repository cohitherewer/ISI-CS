 Labour pot boils again

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 19: Union leaders are ready to accept labour reforms but want assurances from the government that existing laws aimed at protecting the interests of workers will be implemented before change is introduced.

 This was the message sent to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who met union leaders over dinner at his residence and told them about the need to push through legal measures that would make hiring easier.

 The labour leaders, who have always shot down proposals for hire and fire, told Singh they would consider other labour reforms only if existing laws were enforced. 

 Violations were growing in the private sector with employees working 12 hours, they said, adding legal reforms must be matched by proper implementation of existing rules. After the meeting, it was announced that a group would be set up to examine working conditions.

 Representatives of the Congress-backed Intuc and RSS-supported Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh took part in the talks. The two unions, who have kept away from their Left colleagues in Citu and Aituc, today spoke in one voice on enforcing labour laws better.

 The Prime Minister said the wage ceiling for bonus would be reviewed while a committee will examine the demand for fine-tuning the price index with inflation.

 He also told the unions the previous trend of closing and divesting PSUs in a hurry had been reversed. Now, the emphasis is on reviving even loss-making PSUs. In revival packages valued at Rs 5,600 crore, the Centre has released Rs 1,800 crore as wages, Singh said, adding Rs 350 crore will be given before Dussehra for payment of wage arrears.

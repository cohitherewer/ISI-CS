 New Delhi, Feb. 7: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today decided that a high-powered committee would look into the demolition drive in the capital and come up with practical solutions to end the uncertainty and panic that has spread among residents.

 Amid cries to halt the court-ordered demolitions, Singh held an hour-long meeting with home minister Shivraj Patil, urban development minister S. Jaipal Reddy and Delhi chief minister Sheila Dikshit.

 Reddy later told reporters the Prime Minister has desired that the current uncertainty in Delhis ongoing drive should be brought to an end.

 After taking various factors into consideration, it was decided that the urban development ministry should appoint a high-powered committee of eminent people, experts and representatives of the Congress and the BJP to look into various violations that have gone on in Delhi for years and come out with a practical solution, he said.

 The committee will be set up in the next few days and will submit its report in three months.

 The decision to set up a panel came amid calls from the Congress government in Delhi for an ordinance to stop the demolitions.

 Reddy said all kinds of building and land law violations cannot be clubbed together. The Municipal Corporation of Delhi, he added, should focus on graver violations, like encroachment of public land which is a more serious violation, than minor violations on private property.

 The minister said the MCD would seek instructions from Delhi High Court and submit a plan of action to obtain necessary instructions from the court.

 Asked if this meant that the MCD should stop demolitions of private properties and those in the Lal Dora fashion hub till the committees findings are tabled, Reddy only repeated that the civic body should concentrate on encroachment on public land.

 Outlets of top fashion designers have been razed in the demolition drive. Ten schools, including the elite Vasant Valley and G.D. Goenka, have been served with notices.

 In Lal Dora, municipal bulldozers continued to plough into 2 MG Road, which houses outlets of some of the best known designers in the country, as the high court declined to stay the drive.

 Beer fine

 New Delhi, Aug. 7 (PTI): A consumer court has asked Delhi Tourism and Transportation Development Corporation Ltd and Vinsome Breweries Ltd to pay Rs 20,000 as compensation after worms were found in a beer bottle.

 Acting on a complaint filed by Anil Kumar, the district consumer forum (north), said: We have carefully seen the sealed beer bottle with naked eyes and found some foreign particles like pulp floating in the bottle. There is no question of disbelieving the complainant after seeing the beer bottle in question.

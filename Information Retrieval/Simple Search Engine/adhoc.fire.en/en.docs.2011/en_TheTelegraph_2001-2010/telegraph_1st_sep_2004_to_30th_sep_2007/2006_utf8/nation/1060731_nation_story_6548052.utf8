 Riot bill runs into speedbreakers

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 State hurdle: Modi, Swaraj 

 New Delhi, July 30: The bill to prevent communal violence is unlikely to be passed in the ongoing monsoon session of Parliament.

 The Communal Violence (Prevention, Control and Rehabilitation of Victims) Bill, 2005, is being considered by the standing committee on home affairs, which was to have submitted its confidential report to Parliament on Friday. 

 However, sources said, the committee chairperson, BJP leader Sushma Swaraj has asked for the deadline to be extended till the winter session.

 All states and political parties were to submit their recommendations on the bill. So far, only six states ? Gujarat is one of them ? and 11 parties have done so. The Gujarat government has objected to the bill saying it disrupts the federal structure of the country, sources said.

 This is part of confidential correspondence. I cannot tell you what we have said. But we have definitely sent in our recommendations, said a senior minister in the Narendra Modi government, which had been accused of failing to control the 2002 riots.

 Former law minister and BJP MP from Gujarat Arun Jaitley said the bill seeks to usurp the legislative powers of the state. Law and order is strictly a state subject. How can the Centre intervene? he asked.

 Chapter XI of the bill empowers the Centre to deal with communal violence in a state and take over its law and order mechanism if it suspects that the state does not intend to act. 

 The BJP has found fault with the composition of relief committees proposed in the bill, arguing that they are not balanced and the majority community has not been given representation. The party is also opposing a clause on disqualification of legislators. 

 Like the BJP, human rights and womens groups have launched a strident campaign against the bill, for a different reason. 

 While the BJP contends that the proposed legislation infringes on the powers of the states, the rights groups are against the veto power given to the states. In their public report, Colin Gonsalvez of the Human Rights Law Network and the anti-communal group Anhad have pointed out that all the core sections about prevention, control and punishment only come into effect if the state government concerned issues a notification.

 A state government may issue a notification bringing the statute into force in the state and yet render it sterile by not issuing further notifications declaring certain areas to be communally disturbed, Gonsalvez said in his report. 

 The prospect of the infamous Gujarat experiment of a state-sponsored terrorising of minority citizens is still a real enough threat. It is for this reason that the bill was so eagerly awaited. But what this law sets out to do is not to protect innocent citizens from such acts of their elected rulers. Instead, it sets out perversely to vest those same state administrations with even more powers.

 The bill was introduced in the Rajya Sabha in December and then referred to the 35-member committee. Although its proceedings are secret, the committee is learnt to be consulting a panel of four experts.

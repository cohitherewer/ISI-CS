 Dissent against Lalu in party

 Patna, Oct. 8: If the railway turnaround gives Lalu Prasad a reason to rejoice, the acts of party members do just the opposite. 

 The headaches, it seems, are many for the Rashtriya Janata Dal president. If party MLAs in Jharkhand stay firm on being part of the Madhu Koda cabinet, Bihar RJD spokesperson Bhola Prasad Singh takes a dig at the leadership over irregularities in the appointment of personnel to the state Legislative Council when the party was in power. 

 Now, veteran leader Shivanand Tiwary has made it clear that he has problems with the way the party chief operates, especially when it comes to Bihar politics.

 Lalu Prasad openly backed his family members by sending his brother-in-law Subhas Yadav to the Rajya Sabha in 2005. Another brother-in-law, Sadhu, is already a party MP from Gopalganj. Now, he has his wife and deposed chief minister as leader of Opposition in the Bihar Assembly, Tiwary told reporters today. There is no space for party workers like us in the RJD.

 Tiwary, who has written half-a-dozen letters to the party chief alleging nepotism on his (Lalu Prasads) part, has been seen moving around with state Janata Dal (United) chief Lallan Singh for the past two months. Sources said he also called on chief minister Nitish Kumar at his 1 Anne Marg residence recently. 

 The RJD national spokesperson has openly praised Nitishs development work. Yes, Nitish Kumar is doing good work for the state on the development and law and order fronts, Tiwary said.

 Lalu Prasad, who helped Koda come to power after the fall of the Arjun Munda government in Jharkhand, soon found the going tough. He could not take a decision on the two MLAs who would join the Koda cabinet due to internal problems.

 Lalu Prasad, it was believed, wanted Girinath Singh and Annapurna Devi in the ministry. But MLAs Ramchandra Chandravanshi and Prakash Ram queered the pitch by threatening to go to any extent if they were not included in the cabinet. Lalu Prasad later announced that the party would support the Koda government from outside.

 Despite being the railway minister and a vital component of the UPA, Lalu Prasad suffered a huge loss of authority after Rabri Devi lost power to Nitish Kumar. His success in toppling the Jharkhand government is hardly enough to compensate the loss he has suffered, a party leader said.

 The family members, too, seem to have deserted the raja of Bihar. Sadhu and Subhas Yadav, Lalu Prasads brothers-in-law, are no longer seen around him the way they used to be not long ago.

 Nitish Kumar and Sushil Kumar Modi had stood by with the RJD chief when he became chief minister for the first time. Nitish was then Lalu Prasads right hand man in the Janata Dal and Modi was in the BJP, which extended support to the new government.

 Now, Nitish and Modi have joined hands against him. Lalu has lost the support base as well as his friendshe will lose his political identity slowly but steadily, Tiwary said.

 Milk board boils in Kurien successor feud

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Verghese Kurien

 Ahmedabad, April 24: Those who united to oust Verghese Kurien as Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation chief have failed to agree on who should replace him.

 Since the Milkman of India resigned his post of 33 years on March 20, ambitious board members have frustrated all efforts at finding a consensus chairman.

 The federation now faces a bitter election on Wednesday with four candidates in the fray, almost bearing out Kuriens prediction of a power struggle once he had left.

 Board member Mohan Bharwad, chairman of the Ahmedabad Milk Cooperative and a key player in the revolt against Kurien, put up a brave face today and said he still hoped for a consensus. We are meeting tomorrow (to try and find one), he said.

 But another member said: Now there is hardly any chance as everybody has become power hungry.

 The last, faint hopes faded on Friday at a meeting called in Anand to thrash out a compromise. Only nine of the 11 board members ? bosses of district milk producers unions ? turned up and four of them insisted they wanted to contest.

 The four candidates are Mehsana Dairy chairman Vipul Chaudhary, Kheda union boss Ramsinh Parmar, Bansas union chief P. Bhatol and Valsad union chairman Mogabhai Desai. The voters are the 11 board members and the state registrar of cooperatives.

 The outcome of the election, likely to be a close fight, will decide if Amul products will continue to be sold in Ahmedabad district before local dairies like Uttam and Sugam exhaust their sales.

 Ahmedabad union boss Bharwad had moved court alleging Kurien was dumping milk procured from other districts in the local market under the Amul brand name. It is believed this dispute eventually cost Kurien his chair.

 Parmar, who controls Amul, and Chaudhary are in favour of continuing Kuriens policy of selling Amul competitively with local brands. They want to follow Kuriens legacy also on other issues, like his opposition to corporatisation.

 Victory for either would therefore do nothing to improve the federations relations with the National Dairy Development Board, whose chief, Amrita Patel, has been Kuriens staunchest critic.

 Chaudhary had stunned Kuriens opponents two weeks ago by appointing him adviser to his Mehsana Dairy, the countrys largest. Even when he expressed support for a no-confidence motion against Kurien, Chaudhary had suggested the Milkman be appointed adviser to the federation.

 Kurien, who pre-empted an ouster by resigning, earned a token of respect from the Centre last week when the Union human resource development ministry appointed him chancellor of Allahabad University.

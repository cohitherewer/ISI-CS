 Sonia push to womens bill

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 4: Sonia Gandhi today openly backed the Left parties demand to table the womens reservation bill in its original form in Parliaments winter session.

 Sonia Gandhi supported our demand to introduce the bill as it is, a Left leader said after a UPA-Left coordination committee meeting.

 At the three-hour meeting, home minister Shivraj Patil pointed out the problems of bringing the bill in its original form, saying there was divergence of opinion on reservation for weaker sections.

 Although the Centre stopped short of making any commitment, the Left parties feel that with Congress chief Sonia backing their stand, the bill could be introduced in Parliament sooner than later.

 The two sides also discussed economic issues mentioned in the nine-page note the Left submitted in June on the UPA governments performance. These included macro-economic policies and resource mobilisation, agrarian policies, food security and public distribution, foreign direct investment, financial sector liberalisation and privatisation.

 Sources said the governments efforts to persuade the Left leaders for a consensus on shedding equity by non-strategic public sector companies met with stiff resistance. The Left insisted that the PSUs needed to be strengthened, not privatised.

 Issues like attracting foreign capital and financial sector liberalisation also remained deadlocked in the face of opposition from the Left.

 A Left leader said the contentious special economic zones issue did not figure in the meeting. The Left leaders have sought a separate discussion on it with the UPA.

 The Left, however, bluntly told the government that its handling of the food security and public distribution system was a failure and had led to the crisis over foodgrain procurement and resulted in wheat imports.

 There is a lesson to be learnt in this, a Left leader said.

 The two sides have agreed to hold the next UPA-Left co-ordination committee meeting in the second week of November just before the beginning of the winter session of Parliament.

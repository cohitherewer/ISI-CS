The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Branding games BCCI plays

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Sept. 25: The cricket board has rebranded the major national tournaments to make them more saleable to advertisers as domestic matches hit TV screens around the world for the first time from next weekend.

 The telecast is a part of the $612-million TV rights deal the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) struck with Nimbus Communications earlier this year, 

 Neo Sports, the new television channel to be launched by Nimbus sports next weekend will serve as the vehicle for telecast of all BCCI domestic and international fixtures till 2010, said Nimbus chairman Harish Thawani. 

 The first domestic tournament to be shown is the Challenger Trophy renamed Challenger Series for the NKP Salve Trophy in Chennai starting October 1, where former India captain Sourav Ganguly is expected to play.

 Thawani said the unprecedented viewer and advertiser response to the Challenger Trophy held in Mohali in 2005 had set the stage for an even bigger show this time with the tournament to be telecast live by Sky Sports in the UK, Fox Sports in Australia, Super Sport in Africa, Astro in Malaysia and by Willow TV on the Internet.

 Nimbus has tied up with the Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group-owned Adlabs Radio, which was launched in Delhi today, for live coverage of the domestic matches, as soon as government regulations permit. 

 It has been our long-awaited dream to bring domestic cricket to the fans. For the first time in India, we will have up to 70 days of live cricket in India, which will include 32 matches this season. We intend to make domestic cricket events equivalent to other successful domestic brands in the world. We are on the brink of a revolution, said BCCI vice-president Lalit Modi. 

 Thawani said Nimbus hopes to knock up some Rs 4,000 crore in revenues through distribution, ads and syndication during the next four years, the term of the contract with the BCCI. 

 The board, too, smells a golden opportunity in domestic tournaments.

 Domestic cricket has not been marketed well till now, despite its huge potential. There is enormous talent in the domestic circuit which throws up some of the most exciting matches and spectacular cricket. I am convinced that the response will be the same here as in England, where tickets for competition finals are sold well in advance. Besides, television will also generate new stars. We just need to package this well, said I.S. Bindra, a member of BCCIs marketing committee. 

 As part of the packaging, the major tournaments will be branded anew slicker and smarter, as Modi put it. 

 Most domestic schedules have been reworked, too. Over 80 per cent of the one-day matches will be day/night fixtures to ensure greater participation of star players, while the main tournaments have been renamed, he added. 

 There is also a proposal to allow foreign players to play in domestic cricket, but Modi said this would be decided at the next BCCI working committee meeting. The proposed Twenty20 tournament next year will be discussed by the board later.

 Doctors verdict out: new quota sick

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi/Lucknow, April 10: The countrys leading organisation of doctors today opposed the proposal for an other quota for other backward classes in medical colleges, saying it would harm the quality of healthcare.

 Medicine is one profession which deals with precious human life ? a single mistake can be fatal, said Dr Vinay Aggarwal, secretary-general of the Indian Medical Association, a non-government body.

 The association, which has units across the country, will write to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and health minister Anbumani Ramadoss. It has summoned all its state presidents and secretaries to a meeting on April 30 to discuss the subject.

 The suggested 27 per cent reservation, coupled with the existing 22.5 per cent for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, will severely reduce the number of medical college seats open to the meritorious, the association said.

 With around 50 per cent seats reserved, these (quota) students will get admission on a platter. Once they graduate, jobs are also kept reserved for them and they also get early promotions, said Dr Sanjiv Malik, the associations national president.

 Mulayam support

 Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav has come out in defence of the proposal for the OBC education quota. The Samajwadi Party chief, who faces an election next year, claimed the quota was his partys brainchild. This is one issue over which I stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Arjun Singh.

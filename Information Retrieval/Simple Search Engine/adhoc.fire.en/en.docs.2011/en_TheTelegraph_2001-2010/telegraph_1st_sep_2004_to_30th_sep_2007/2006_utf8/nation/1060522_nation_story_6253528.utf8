 Shirk work at your peril: SC

New Delhi (PTI): The Supreme Court has ruled 

that overstaying on leave and unauthorised absence for long was a serious misconduct 

and an employer could punish an employee with dismissal.

Remaining absent for a long time, in our opinion, 

cannot be said to be a minor misconduct, a bench of Justices S.B. Sinha 

and P.K. Balasubramanyan said, upholding the dismissal of an employee of the North-eastern 

Karnataka Road Transport Corporation.

 The employee, a conductor, was dismissed after departmental proceedings for unauthorised absence for around three years.

 The labour court and Karnataka High Court had held that overstaying on leave and unauthorised absence was a minor offence.

 Differing with the view, the apex court bench referred to several previous rulings on the issue and said the high court judgment could not be sustained.

Sources at Shahupuri police station said Sawants 

offence was non-cognisable.

 A case under the Bombay Police Act was registered against Sawant for indecent behaviour and gestures during her May 18 performance for a beer brand of which she is the brand ambassador.

 On Saturday, she did a show for Police Kalyan Nidhi, which has reportedly prompted an organisation fighting for mens rights to move a court in Sangli. The Purush Hakk Suraksha Samiti accused Sawant of indulging in obscene and vulgar acts that were against public morality and asked the court to restrain her from repeating them.

village, has been arrested on the charge of murdering her husband. Police sources 

said Rohit Lodh has confessed to the crime.

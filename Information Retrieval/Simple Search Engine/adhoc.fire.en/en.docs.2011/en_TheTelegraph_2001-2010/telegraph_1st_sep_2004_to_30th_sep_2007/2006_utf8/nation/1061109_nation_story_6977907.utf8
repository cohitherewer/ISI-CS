The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Wanted, CPM Hindi head-hunters

 Calcutta, Nov. 8: The CPMs plan to expand its base in the Hindi heartland is being hobbled by a lack of dedicated organisers as leaders are not keen to leave secure sanctuaries like Bengal. 

 The party also has to ward off competition from NGOs in recruiting cadre. Prospective party workers, idealist and socially committed youth, are allegedly being lured away by NGOs offering better salaries and perks. 

 In Haryana, the party had groomed prospective cadre who were part of a literacy campaign but an NGO hijacked them, says MP and central committee member from Bengal Hannan Molla.

 With the partys growing clout at the Centre favouring expansion, the focus is on Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand and Orissa, besides Assam, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. 

 One of the reasons for the slowdown of the expansion plan is the inadequacy of cadre, says a report of the partys 18th congress, held last December. The party should recruit young cadre from (strong) states and strong districts in weak states and deploy them in areas where the party is weak, it adds.

 The CPM depends more on organisers from Bengal for guiding cadre in the heartland than their southern counterparts because of language problems. 

 But not many leaders are ready to leave Bengal to work at the party centre in Delhi from where organisers are assigned specific state responsibilities. Relaxed life after 30 years of Left rule has made insecure and harrowing jobs elsewhere unattractive to many, says Molla. 

 Today, student and youth organisations in Bengal do not produce dedicated organisers like the whole-timers of yesteryears who would risk life and career for a base outside Bengal, says another central committee member from Bengal. 

 Even the leaders of earlier generations are reluctant to venture out, he adds, attributing it to a mindset that develops because of the trappings of power. 

 Bengal party secretary Biman Bose rapped cadre in Calcutta last evening, saying all the vices that absolute power brings have crept into the party. He oversees party affairs in Assam, Manipur and Jharkhand. 

 Molla and former MP Nilotpal Basu are part of the five-member central secretariat that assists party secretary Prakash Karat implement the partys growth plan. Molla is in charge of Rajasthan, Basu Haryana and Calcutta MP Mohammad Salim of Jammu and Kashmir. Some others in the 16-member politburo and the 76-member central committee have also been entrusted with state responsibilities. 

 The number of Delhi-based politburo and central committee members has decreased following death and ailments of veterans, says Salim.

 Both Molla and Salim, however, feel migration of cadre would not produce miracles as they would face language and culture barriers in the caste-ridden, communally-divided Hindi heartland. 

 We would prefer to nurture local residents to work at the grassroots. The party would provide Rs 1,500-Rs 2,500 a month to new whole-timers in places where it is weak. The basic principle is to pay the unorganised industrys minimum wage to these recruits. Fourteen Adivasi whole-timers have already been deputed in Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand, Salim says.

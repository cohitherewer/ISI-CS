 Schools refuse to toe the line

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 19: Private schools are giving the Centre a tough time. First, they refused to fulfil their commitment to reserve 25 per cent seats for poor children. Now, they are refusing to waive fees for the single girl child.

 The human resource development ministry had last year announced a scheme waiving fees for single girl children from Class VI to XII.

 Officials in the ministry say they cannot impose their order on private organisations. All they can do is persuade them to meet their social obligations. We can lure them and give incentives like, for instance, give plots or tax incentives, said an official in the department of women and children. 

 The plot sop, however, had been tried before. The government had offered concessions on land to leading private schools in the capital with the understanding that they would reserve 15 per cent seats for children from underprivileged families. But most schools gave the understanding a go by. Those who met it did so on their own terms.

 According to the Central Advisory Board of Education (Cabe), in the few schools that do have a quota, there is a clear divide between rich and poor children. The underprivileged children attend classes after the main shift is over and the best teachers are kept for the privileged lot.

 The bill on fundamental right to education ? yet to be passed in Parliament ? makes it mandatory for private schools to reserve 25 per cent of seats for girls. Members of Cabe who drafted the bill say private schools cannot escape their share of responsibility. Once the bill is passed, they will have to abide by it.

 But the schools are belligerent. Carmel Convent went to court recently, challenging the girl-child guideline. 

 The Central Board of Secondary Education backtracked from its original circular asking all schools ? private and government ? to implement the policy. It told private schools that instead of waiving fees for Classes VI to XII, they could restrict it to Classes IX to XII.

 The 93rd Constitutional Amendment Act, which has been in the eye of a storm, can open the floodgates of a new controversy. 

 HRD officials say the act provides reservation for socially and educationally backward classes in educational institutions, which can be interpreted to include schools, and applies to all categories of schools.

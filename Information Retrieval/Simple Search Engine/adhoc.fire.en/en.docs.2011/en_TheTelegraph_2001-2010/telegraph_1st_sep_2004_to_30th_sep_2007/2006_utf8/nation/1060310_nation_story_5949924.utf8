 Bill to bail Jaya out of trouble

 OUR BUREAU

 March 9: The Uttar Pradesh government today passed a bill that seeks to take out certain posts from the list of offices of profit in a move the Opposition alleged was an attempt to save actor-turned-MP Jaya Bachchan and others like her from disqualification.

 Jaya had continued to head the states film development board even after her election to the Rajya Sabha on a Samajwadi Party ticket. The Election Commission had recommended to the President that she be stripped of her seat.

 A number of Uttar Pradesh ministers also fear they could be disqualified because they head state corporations.

 If the governor approves the State Legislature (Prevention of Disqualification Amendment) Bill 2006, passed with retrospective effect from January 2003, 79 posts of heads of various boards in the state will no longer be regarded as offices of profit.

 The bill was passed by voice vote amid stiff opposition from the BJP and the BSP. No Congress member was present. The bill is anti-constitutional and undemocratic, said BJP leader Lalji Tandon.

 Chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav defended the move, saying it has been found that politicians are more sincere than bureaucrats.

 Advocate Prashant Bhushan, however, said the move is unlikely to stop Jaya from being disqualified, as a state cannot exempt any office from being regarded as an office of profit to prevent disqualification from Parliament.

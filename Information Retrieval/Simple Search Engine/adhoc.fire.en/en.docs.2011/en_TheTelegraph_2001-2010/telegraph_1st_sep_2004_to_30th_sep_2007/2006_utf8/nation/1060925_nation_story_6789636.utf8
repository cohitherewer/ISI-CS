 Pandit plight, in pictures

 Mumbai, Sept. 24: Ajay Chrungoo is no stranger to death. 

 But the sordid images of bloodshed in his homeland have left an imprint on Chrungoo that his medical career could not erase. 

 So, a camera in hand, the Kashmiri Pandit doctor set about to capture the lost paradise on Earth. Three years of labour have given birth to a collection of photographs that Chrungoo is exhibiting in the city.

 The pictures depict the transition of Kashmir since 1989, when terror took root in the Valley and many Pandits were uprooted from their homes. 

 Its a sorry state of affairs. The situation in the Valley is such that the remaining 100-odd Hindu population there have to dress and talk like Muslims! They cannot put tika on their foreheads, or show any kind of religious inclinations, said Chrungoo, who has braved death threats since he began the project.

 The doctor is the chairman of Panun Kashmir, an organisation working for the rehabilitation of Pandits.

 If you see the photos, you will understand that they are not just happy to destroy the temples, but they have written obscene messages on the temple walls. It was so difficult to take these photographs. I got only two-three minutes on each site. Most of these places are known militant areas and it was a great risk. We scouted about 20 villages and managed to take about 600 photographs, Chrungoo said. 

 The photographs on display bring into focus a decade of horror a Hindu couple being dragged on a street after being tortured, children in a pool of blood and burnt houses lying abandoned. There are pictures of women and children in camps in the Valley, surviving without adequate food, water or any civic amenities.

 But the most poignant of them is the image of a priest in Sri Mangla Mata Temple in Wachi, Pulwara, looking directly into the camera with a headless deity in the background.

 This man has a death threat on him. I dont know if hes still alive. He takes care of the idol, despite it being rendered headless. I, too, have got many phone calls telling me that I will be murdered. I have received threatening letters as well. But its the support of my family that helps me continue my work. I firmly believe that terrorists will have their way, no matter what. The only thing we can do is find the source of terrorism and eliminate it. None of us are safe till that happens, Chrungoo said. 

 But he is quick to add that he does not blame all Muslims. What I am saying is that terrorism is an ideology, and the source of such ideology should be eliminated. Theres no excuse for terrorism.

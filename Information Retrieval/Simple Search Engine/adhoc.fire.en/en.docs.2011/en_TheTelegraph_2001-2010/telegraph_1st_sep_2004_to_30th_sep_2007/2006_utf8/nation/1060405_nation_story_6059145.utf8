The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Stars, crores for kids

 New Delhi, April 4: The hottest actor? Shah Rukh Khan. The coolest gadget? A mobile phone which also has a camera. The best sportsman? Sachin Tendulkar. Studies? Yawn.

 This is what city kids in India are saying. Cartoon Network today released the findings of its childrens lifestyle survey, which polled over 4,000 children aged between 7 and 14 in 14 cities across the country. In addition, the survey covered their parents as well as 841 mothers of 4-6 year olds.

 Shah Rukh is the favourite actor among the 7-14 year olds, with 20 per cent voting for him. Rani Mukherji is the favourite actress: she got 16 per cent votes.

 Sachin Tendulkar is the favourite sportsperson, by far. Forty-one per cent year olds picked him; Rahul Dravid was way behind at 13 per cent. Former captain Sourav Ganguly got 6 per cent votes. Tennis sensation Sania also polled 6 per cent, according to the survey, New Generation 2005, conducted over November-December last year.

 The study asked if children felt they spent too much time studying. An overwhelming 87 per cent of the 7-14 year olds said yes. But they realised they had no choice. For, 80 per cent also felt that getting the top rank was important, even if it meant less free time. This feeling was the highest in Calcutta: 97 per cent of the kids thought so. In Delhi, at the bottom of this scale, only 67 per cent said so.

 In fact, 95 per cent of the Calcutta kids felt it was difficult to score good marks without private tuitions or extra classes. Only 38 per cent in Delhi agreed.

 What gadgets did children dig? Cellphones with cameras ranked the highest (74 per cent) on the wish-list of children who had heard of them. X-box, iPod and Sony playstations also figured.

 The children were familiar with computers, of course. Forty per cent said they had used one in the past month. Boys and girls seemed to have almost equal access (boys 40 and girls 38 per cent). 

 There is big money involved here. The survey says 84 per cent of the parents have taken their children out shopping and 63 per cent shop with them at least once a month. One in four kids asks for something every time they are out. Most of them get what they want.

 A childs opinion also matters in big-ticket buys. Like TV sets, where 71 per cent parents acknowledged their children had a say on the brand, computers (70 per cent), mobile phones (67 per cent) and cars (66 per cent).

 Thirty-nine per cent of the children got pocket money. Sixty per cent got gift money. Crunching numbers, Cartoon Network reckoned that in the 14 cities, this added up to Rs 364 crore a year. Of this, kids spend Rs 291 crore.

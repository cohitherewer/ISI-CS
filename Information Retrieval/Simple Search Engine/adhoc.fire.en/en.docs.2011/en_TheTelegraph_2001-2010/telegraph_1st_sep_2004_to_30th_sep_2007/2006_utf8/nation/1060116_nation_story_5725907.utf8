 Murthy push to unshackle colleges

 Kochi/Ahmedabad, Jan. 15: Days after the Centre prevented IIM Bangalore from opening a campus in Singapore, a visiting minister from the Southeast Asian country questioned the decision and the Infosys boss called for autonomy in higher education.

 N.R. Narayana Murthy, Infosys chief mentor, explained how much the shackles on higher education were costing the country.

 Government regulations? have limited the ability of our colleges and universities to adapt and change, he said in Kochi.

 Consequently, we have failed to build truly world-class institutions. Many are not able to attract and retain high-quality faculty. A lack of orientation has also resulted in colleges focusing on outdated curriculum. As a result, a large number of our institutions produce graduates ill-equipped to relate their learning with the outside world.

 This is why the ranks of jobless university graduates have swelled to 5.3 million, Narayana Murthy said.

 His advice: Treat higher education as an industry in a free market economy so that it can be competitive.

 Singapore senior minister Goh Chok Tongs brief comments on the subject were restricted to the curb on the Bangalore institute (IIM-B). He said the loss was Indias.

 We are happy to welcome IIM-B in Singapore, said the former Prime Minister, who is visiting IIM Ahmedabad (IIM-A). It is their (Indias) loss. They could have made some money as well.

 In New Delhi, science and technology minister Kapil Sibal refused to directly comment on the IIM-B controversy but said educational institutions must be freed from controls and given relative autonomy to meet global standards.

 The views of the Infosys chief and Sibal are at odds with the stand taken by many governments and major political parties in India. M.M. Joshi, HRD minister in the Vajpayee government, had tried to slash the IIMs fees and get them to change their curriculum. His successor Arjun Singh, for all his assurances on autonomy, struck the latest blow at IIM-B.

 In Left-dominated Bengal and Kerala, the CPM and its affiliate students and teachers bodies have often opposed moves even towards limited autonomy for select colleges.

 Narayana Murthy and Indian Space Research Organisation chairman G. Madhavan Nair today received honorary DScs from the Cochin University of Science and Technology.

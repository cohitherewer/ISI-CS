 CPM surveys Delhi show

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, May 27: The CPM politburo today reviewed the two-year performance of the UPA government and expressed strong reservations about the proposed oil price rise and airport privatisation.

 The two-day meeting that began today was attended by 15 members, including Jyoti Basu. It discussed the impact of an oil price increase on people and suggested that the Centre be asked to rationalise the petrol and diesel tax structure to reduce the burden on consumers. The politburo also stressed that kerosene and LPG should be left untouched. 

 Politburo member Sitaram Yechury said the Centre should not keep increasing oil prices citing the rise in global rates. If duties are reduced, the Centre will not be required to raise prices, he said. 

 On airport privatisation, the CPM iterated its stand that the modernisation should be left to the Airports Authority of India and that there was no need for private players. The party said the AAI had the wherewithal to do the work but was being bypassed by the Centre.

 The upgradation of Mumbai and Delhi airports was handed to private parties amid opposition from the Left. 

 Why should private parties be here? AAI has enough money to modernise airports. We discussed the matter threadbare and the Centre should be persuaded to change its decision, Basu said.

 The proposed reservation for Other Backward Classes in higher educational institutions was also debated. 

 Yechury said students protesting the decision should withdraw their strike in the light of the Centres stand that the total number of seats will be increased. As the government has decided to raise the number of seats and thereby prevent dilution of merit, students should not continue with their strike, he said.

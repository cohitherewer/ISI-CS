The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Author took us for a ride

 The portrayal of the Maharaja and Anita in the novel is all trash. They have no one to defend them. Its my duty to defend mother (Anita) and son (Ajit) whose names have been tarnished by a writer who has made a lot of money and is seeking an escape route.

 One has no objection to fiction. The objection comes when you are deceptive. Moro came to see me in May 2004. I extended all courtesy. He said he wanted to write a book on Sikh history.

 I was delighted and presented him with a book on Jassa Singh Ahluwalia, founder of the Kapurthala state, and invited him to the rulers birthday celebrations to see for himself how Kapurthala observes the day.

 Moro did visit Kapurthala. But he never informed me of his visit; I was told by others.

 [Singh says that on November 10, 2004, he received an email from Moro saying he had received no help from his father Sukhjit Singh on the planned non-fictional book. So he had decided to write a novel on the years Anita spent in India, and had finished it.]

 This came as a shock. There is a lot of difference between a book on Sikh history and one on Jagatjit and Anita. He said the Spanish version would be released in January 2005. We told him we wanted to proof-read it. He sent us the epilogue instead. When he called, I gave him a mouthful.

 Moro was very deceptive right from the beginning. My father could sense that his objective was to mislead us. The moment you name family members and (publish) photographs you cant call it fiction.

 [Singh says Moros inspiration for the book came from an earlier book, Anita Delgado Spanish Maharani, by Elisa Vzquez de Gey in 1997.]

 Its a pleasant reading of Anitas diaries. De Gey has quoted everything. But it didnt sell. Moro realised that by adding mirch-masala he could make a bestseller of her diaries. In Europe, he terms his novel the real story but in India, he terms it fiction.

 I feel sorry for Ms Cruz. What does she know about Moros book except that it is a true story, which it is not? If she wants to reach out, consult us, we would help her out.

 Special powers act to stay

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 5: The defence ministry has said it will not revoke the Armed Forces Special Powers Act but amendments could be made.

 There is no question of repealing the act, defence minister A.K. Antony said today. But necessary amendments may be made to make it more humane. The army is also agreeable to these changes.

 The army had earlier told the government that the recommendations of a committee to repeal the act would severely hamper counter-insurgency operations. 

 Indeed, the army would have to rethink its deployment in the Northeast if the act was repealed and no provision was made to give indemnity to its personnel in counter-insurgency operations. The Prime Ministers recent statements in Manipur also reflect the defence ministrys view.

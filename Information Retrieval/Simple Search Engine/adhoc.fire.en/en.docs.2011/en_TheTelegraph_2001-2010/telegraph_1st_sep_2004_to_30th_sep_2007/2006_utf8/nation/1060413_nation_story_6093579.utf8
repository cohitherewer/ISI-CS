 God on lips, chomping on chocolates

Katrina turned away from jail

 MANISH SHARMA

 Jodhpur, April 12: Salman Khan, who was spending one more night in jail tonight, is seeking comfort in Allah.

 He offered namaz in his cell, said a source in Jodhpur Central jail where the star is lodged.

 While there were reports that Salman had received some chocolates in his cell, Katrina Kaif, his girlfriend who flew to Jodhpur this afternoon, was not allowed to meet him. She waited two hours in vain as the jail authorities turned her away citing rules.

 The 41-year-old actor has been eating the chapatis and vegetable curry and the chana-gur (for breakfast) that are given to ordinary inmates.

 Jail superintendent Mutthilal Chouhan said: We have given him a carom board in the cell and he is munching on some toffees and chocolates. 

 Earlier it was expected that Salman, who was on Monday handed five years rigorous imprisonment for killing a chinkara, an endangered antelope, would be freed on bail today.

 G.S. Mehta, the Jodhpur district and sessions judge, however, deferred hearing of the bail appeal till tomorrow. Salmans counsel H.M. Saraswat has filed a 44-page application that includes 38 points challenging the sentence given by the chief judicial magistrates court.

 It was not Salman alone who was seeking divine solace. His brother Sohail and sister Alvira flew by a chartered plane to the nearby Ajmer dargah of Sufi saint Moinuddin Chishti.

 His mother Salma, who was admitted to a Mumbai hospital after hearing about his sentence, was today declared fit to go home by attending doctors. 

 Mrs Khan is doing fine and we will discharge her tomorrow, said a spokesperson for Lilavati Hospital.

 Salmans friends and family members are camping just 6 km away in the citys only five-star hotel.

 The jail superintendent explained why he could not permit Katrina to see Salman. As per norms, I am unable to allow her as only three persons in a fortnight could meet the convicted prisoner and this limit was completed yesterday. I can permit only a person having blood relation with the inmate and that too purely on urgency basis, Chouhan said.

 Unconfirmed reports said Chouhan was putting Salman up in his own quarters on the jail premises. 

 Other visitors included Govinda, who came in a white shirt and black jacket along with director-friend David Dhawan. 

 There are two more cases pending against the star in the Jodhpur court ? one is a poaching case while the other falls under the Arms Act. The arms used to kill the animals were allegedly without licence. 

 Both the cases were to come up for verdict today, but the court deferred judgment till May 9 and 10.

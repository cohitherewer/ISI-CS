 Australia BPO row 

 Melbourne, Dec. 20 (PTI): As a part of its efforts against offshoring jobs overseas, the Australian Finance Sector Union has urged St George Bank shareholders to stop sending jobs to India.

 Paul Schroder, national secretary of the union, said frontline bank staff and union members would ask board members to commit to keeping jobs in Australia.

 Earlier this year, the bank had moved over 70 jobs to Bangalore.

 According to Schroder, the decision meant sensitive customer details were taken offshore, thereby undermining St Georges reputation, a Herald Sun report said.

 Their actions continue to fly in the face of concerns from workers, customers and shareholders, he added.

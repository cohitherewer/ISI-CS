 Jammu, Dec. 17: Police today quelled a prison revolt by about 300 militants, some of them Pakistanis, after a move to shift some of the prisoners outside the state sparked a standoff yesterday.

 For several hours at the Kot Bhalwal jail this morning, the police fired in the air and burst teargas shells while the prisoners took position on rooftops, armed with gas cylinders, sharp weapons and stones piled up since Saturday.

 The inmates, who officials said had become a law unto themselves, had refused to enter their barracks yesterday. They smashed the doors and windows of their barracks and pulled down one of the inner boundary walls.

 Then, positioned behind rows of gas cylinders seized from the jail kitchen, they challenged the guards to fire at them and risk an inferno.

 The police avoided a fight in the night, waiting for reinforcements from the police training schools and armed wings to arrive in the morning.

 There were 300 militants and we requisitioned 1,000 policemen, director-general of prisons M.K. Mohanty told reporters.

 Police teams entered the vast premises of the jail amid a shower of stones. The militants, face covered with cloth, took the teargas in stride, forcing the police to fire in the air and finally risk a charge to the rooftops, officers said.

 The strategy worked and by late afternoon, the situation was under control, police said. Officers wouldnt give details of the last stage of the battle, nor reveal how many inmates were injured.

 They put the number of injured personnel at four but agency reports said 15 policemen and 21 prisoners were injured.

 Sources said the militants wore black armbands and shouted slogans against the police and the government, alleging harassment by jail authorities.

 Tension had been building up in the jail over the past two months since mobile phones were seized from a few prisoners. The police said the militants were using them to stay in touch with their comrades in other jails.

 The Hurriyat Conference and other separatist groups have called for a shutdown tomorrow.

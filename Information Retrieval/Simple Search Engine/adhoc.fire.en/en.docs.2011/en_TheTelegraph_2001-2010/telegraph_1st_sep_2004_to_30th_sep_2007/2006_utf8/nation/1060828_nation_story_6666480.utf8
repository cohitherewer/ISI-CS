 Rap for allotment of used flat

 New Delhi (PTI): 

 The Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Commission 

 has asked the Ghaziabad Development Authority (GDA) to pay 

 Rs 26,040, besides interest, after a buyer was given a dilapidated, 

 pre-occupied flat and made to forfeit the registration amount.

 We are inclined to agree 

 with the applicant that the respondent (GDA) has indulged 

 in unfair trade practices in not allotting him a proper 

 house. And the GDA is not entitled to (make the buyer) 

 forfeit the registration amount, the commission said, 

 allowing the application of Amit Bhatnagar, a resident of 

 Paschim Vihar in Delhi.

 The commission said the GDA has also not been able to contradict allegations made by the victim.

 Bhatnagar had contended that he booked the flat on April 7, 1998. He deposited Rs 26,040 as registration amount and agreed to pay Rs 2.6 lakh for the flat in instalments.

 Server tip for govt websites

 New Delhi (PTI): 

 Central ministries and departments have been warned against 

 hosting their official websites on servers owned by private 

 companies, particularly those located outside the country.

 This has been communicated by 

 the Union ministry of home affairs, which feels that hosting 

 on private servers poses a serious threat to websites.

 Sources said the ministry has suggested that websites be put on servers of the National Informatics Centre and the Education and Research Network or any other server owned by the Union or state governments.

 The alert came in the wake of incidents of hackers breaking into government websites hosted on private servers.

 Gulf workers

 Dubai (PTI):As 

 many as 1,000 Indian workers, who lost their jobs after 

 a Bahrain-based garment factory closed down last year, are 

 yet to be paid their dues.

 The workers claim they have not 

 got wages of about Rs 1.23 lakh as promised to them by the 

 firm.

 Arms heat on cop 

 Muktsar (PTI): 

 An assistant sub-inspector of police, Harinder Singh, has 

 been booked for keeping country-made pistols and ammunition, 

 including AK-47 cartridges, at his house. A police team 

 conducted a raid on receiving information that he had held 

 on to the arms and ammunition instead of depositing them 

 at the police station he was attached with. Singh is absconding.

 Bribe arrest

 Patna (PTI): 

 A child development project officer has been caught red-handed 

 by the state vigilance bureau while taking a bribe of Rs 

 1,500 in Muzaffarpur against a promise of a job.

 Madras University, which has given 

 India six Presidents and two Nobel laureates, will turn 

 150 on September 5. It came into being after a decree by 

 then Madras governor Lord Elphinstone.

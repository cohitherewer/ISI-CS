 Rs 1000-cr ITC plan on Buddha table

Deveshwar: Mission Bengal

 Calcutta, June 26: From a new hotel and an agri-business to an IT park and logistics hub, ITC today announced a raft of plans for Bengal worth Rs 1,000 crore in investments.

 At a meeting with chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee this evening, company chairman Y.C. Deveshwar reportedly sought over 120 acres for the projects.

 On the list is a Rs 350-crore hotel with 300 rooms. We plan to add around 300 rooms in Calcutta. For the new hotel, weve sought around 10 acres of land. Weve given a list of land required to the government. Well come back in a month for a follow-up, Deveshwar said after the meeting.

 Officials said the company had been looking for land for a second hotel for a long time now. ITC had earlier bid for a six-acre plot off the EM Bypass near its existing hotel, but it lost to a Dubai firms record-breaking offer of Rs 219 crore.

 ITC had also expressed interest in taking over the state government-owned Great Eastern Hotel before backing out at the last moment.

 The company wants to expand its cigarette factory in Kidderpore but is again facing problems finding land.

 The issue of ITCs factory expansion has been pending with Calcutta Port Trust and the central ministry for some time now. The chief minister spoke to (Union shipping, road transport and highways minister) T.R. Baalu this evening and asked him to speed the matter up, said commerce and industry secretary Sabyasachi Sen.

 All their proposals are land-linked. They have named many places around Calcutta which they prefer for various projects. We will have to identify the land for them.

 On the companys wish list is 20 acres for a biscuit plant on the citys outskirts, Deveshwar confirmed.

 In addition to all this, the ITC chairman said, the company plans an agri-services business. For this, we will set up the cold storage chains and other facilities. This will be along the lines of Metro Cash and Carry, he said.

 Officials said the proposed agri-business was much smaller than Reliances Rs 2,000-crore agri retail chain and would serve only Calcutta. ITC already operates agri-businesses in Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra.

 Deveshwar spoke of a logistics hub just outside Calcutta. Weve sought around 20 acres near the Bombay Road-Delhi Road highway. 

 Also on ITCs mind is an infotech park in the Rajarhat area, for which Deveshwar has sought 50 acres from the chief minister.

 At present, in addition to the cigarette factory and Sonar Bangla, among the companys businesses in Bengal are a speciality paper factory at Triveni in Hooghly and two hotels in Darjeeling.

 Bengal has received a series of major investment proposals in the past few months. Tata Motor plans to invest Rs 1,000 crore in a small-car plant in Singur and Telcon Rs 250 crore in a payloader factory near Kharagpur.

 Indofood, a subsidiary of the Indonesia-based Salim Group, is looking to build a food park in Howrah. Its food-processing units will make a range of products from baby food to tomato ketchup. 

 Another Salim subsidiary, Mahabharat Motorcycle, is to open a factory near Uluberia.

 All-India medical quota next year

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 5: Seats in postgraduate medical courses that are filled through the all-India quota will not have reservation for Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe candidates this year. But from next year, 10 per cent of these seats will be so reserved.

 About half the medical PG seats at non-central institutions are filled through an all-India quota. 

 The Supreme Court had directed the Centre to reserve 10 per cent of the all-India quota seats for SCs/STs from this year, but recalled the order after the government cited technical problems and undertook to reserve the seats from next year.

 A group of students had earlier challenged the way the SC/ST quota was calculated in medical PG courses. They said the 22.7 per cent reservation was worked out after leaving out the 50 per cent seats earmarked under the all-India quota.

 With there being no reservation in the central quota, the SCs/STs got far less than 22.7 per cent of the total seats, the students argued.

 The central government accepted the argument but said it was too late to do anything this year. 

 The prospectus didnt mention an SC/ST quota; and if the seats were reserved now, it would lead to a flood of litigation.

 Bird flu found in Surat

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Ahmedabad, Feb. 25: Bird flu has been detected in samples from two poultry farms in a Surat taluka close to Navapur, spurring authorities to step up culling of chickens that has been underway for a week.

 A Bhopal laboratory had yesterday confirmed that birds in the Uchchal Timol and National poultry farms in Uchchal taluka, adjoining Maharashtras Navapur, were infected.

 Culling has been going on in poultry farms in Uchchal since February 18 on the Centres orders that no bird within a 3-km radius of Navapur should be spared. All chickens in four farms, including the infected ones, have already been killed.

 The Centre today downplayed reports of the flu, saying it could not be termed a fresh outbreak as Uchchal was within a 3-km radius of Navapur. There was no cause for panic, it said. 

 No case of bird flu in humans was reported.

 The disease among birds is not so alarming as we have already culled all the poultry from that particular area. But we are still taking precaution so that the disease does not spread, animal husbandry secretary D.K. Rao said.

 A decision has been taken to cull all birds within a 10-km radius of Uchchal.

 Along with resuming culling, the authorities have intensified the drive to vaccinate poultry workers and disinfect farms. 

 More than 19,800 chickens will be culled today. Disinfecting operations are already underway and will be intensified, Rao said.

 Till last night, about 88,294 birds in three villages in the 3-km radius had been culled, he said. The drive has now been extended to 22 villages.

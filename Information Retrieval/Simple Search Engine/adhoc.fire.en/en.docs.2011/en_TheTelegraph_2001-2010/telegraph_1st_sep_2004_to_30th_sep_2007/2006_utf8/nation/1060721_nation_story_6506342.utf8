 Nod to pay panel 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 20: Brushing aside the recommendations of the eleventh finance commission, the cabinet today approved the formation of a three-member pay commission for central government employees.

 The finance commission had suggested that there should be no pay panel for central government employees in future. 

 The term of the sixth pay commission, a purely temporary body, will be for 18 months.

 The commission will have one chairman of the rank of minister of state, one part-time member and one member-secretary of the rank of secretary or additional secretary in the central government, said Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, the information and broadcasting minister.

 The chairman and other members of the commission will be appointed by the Prime Minister, he said.

 The new commissions proposals are expected to cost the government an additional Rs 20,000 crore. The last pay commission added Rs 17,000 crore to the financial outgo of the Centre in the form of wages and salaries. 

 The commission will also examine the desirability, need and quantum of interim relief if any. 

 The decision on the sixth pay commission has been taken despite the economic survey asking the government to remain vigilant and exercise caution while implementing the fifth panels proposals.

 The survey for 2005-06 had pointed out that in the aftermath of the implementation of the fifth pay commissions recommendations, the general fiscal deficit increased every year to reach a peak of 9.9 per cent in 2001-02.

 The government needs to avoid a repetition of a similar deterioration (of fiscal situation) in the medium term, the survey had said.

 Analysts believe that the implementation of these recommendations might take up to three years and the government might therefore grant an interim relief of 10-15 per cent to the government staff.

 Das Munshi said state governments were also consulted before taking a decision on the pay commission. Once a decision is taken on the pay commission for central government employees, the state governments are expected to face a similar demand from their own employees.

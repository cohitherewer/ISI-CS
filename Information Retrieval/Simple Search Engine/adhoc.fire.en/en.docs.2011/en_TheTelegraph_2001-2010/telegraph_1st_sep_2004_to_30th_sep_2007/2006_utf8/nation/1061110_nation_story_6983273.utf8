 Father-in-law in dock for rape bid

 Burdwan: Rekha Das, 22, was set on fire 

 by her father-in-law after she thwarted his attempt to rape 

 her, police said. She died in hospital late Wednesday night.

 In her dying statement, Rekha accused Dharam Das, 67, of trying to rape her. 

 Dharam confessed to us that he tried to get intimate with his daughter-in-law on several earlier occasions.... But he denied the allegation that he set her on fire, an investigating officer said. 

 Rekha had married Dharams son Fakir, who works in Mumbai, six months ago and come to live with his family at a village in Burdwan, 170 km from Calcutta.

 On Tuesday, she was sleeping when a drunken Dharam entered her room. His wife Sumitra was sleeping in the next room. Sumitra woke up when Rekha started screaming. When she rushed to the room, she found Rekha engulfed in flames and Dharam standing at a distance laughing, the officer said.

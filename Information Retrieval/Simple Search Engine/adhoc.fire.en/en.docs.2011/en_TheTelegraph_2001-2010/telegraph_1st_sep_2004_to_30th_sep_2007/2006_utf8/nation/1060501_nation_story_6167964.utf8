 Maoists shot dead after boat hijack in Andhra

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Hyderabad, April 30: In a first-ever strike on a tourist spot in Andhra Pradesh, Maoists today hijacked two luxury boats in the middle of the Nagarjunasagar reservoir and took captive about 35 holidaymakers, including the crew.

 About 234 people of a marriage party and an advocates association had boarded the Shanti-Siri and M.L. Krishna for a visit to Nagarjunakonda, an island-hillock housing the relics of a famous Buddhist monk who preached there.

 After the boats anchored at the island and most tourists got off, the Maoists ? disguised as holidaymakers ? suddenly whipped out guns and forced the crew to take off with some stragglers still on board.

 The strike was believed to be in retaliation to the killings of nine Maoists in a police encounter in the Seshachalam forests in Kadapa three days ago.

 Late tonight, Guntur police said the Moaists had got the hijacked boats to stop at a spot 30 km from Nagarjunakonda, which is about 150 km southeast of Hyderabad.

 They then let off the tourists and the crew with a warning and a lecture never to sail down the reservoir again, blew up the boats and fled into the forests.

 Anti-Maoist commandos, put on the trail by police after an advocate tipped them off by phone from Nagarjunakonda, are believed to have chased the hijackers all evening and finally shot them dead near Maddimadu village.

 Those released by the Maoists are believed to be safe and are being brought back home. About 200 tourists stranded at Nagarjunakonda were ferried to Vijayapuri by alternative boats around 8 pm.

 Before the commandos took over the search, police teams from Guntur had begun scouring the banks of river Krishna, off which the Nagarjunasagar dam is located.

 There had been a slight delay as the two banks of the river fall in two different districts, leading to confusion over which district police should take charge.

 We deployed forces from Srisailam down to Nagajunasagar in pursuit of the Maoists, director-general of police Swaranjit Sen said.

 About 300 personnel, including about 100 anti-Maoist commandos, took part in the operation.

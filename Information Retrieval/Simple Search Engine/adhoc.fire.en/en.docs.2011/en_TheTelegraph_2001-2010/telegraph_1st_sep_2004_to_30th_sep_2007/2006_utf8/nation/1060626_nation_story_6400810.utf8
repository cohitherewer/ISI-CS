 Defence post hits Left wall

 SUJAN DUTTA

 New Delhi, June 25: Defence minister Pranab Mukherjees move to evolve a political consensus on the post of Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) is likely to run into rough weather with the Left seeking clarifications on what powers would be conferred on such an officer.

 The CDS is envisaged as a single-point military adviser to the government and the creation of the post practically calls for a restructuring of the higher defence echelons. 

 Mukherjee last month said he had written to all political parties before the government could decide on the post, and earlier this month sent a reminder to political parties.

 The creation of the CDS post was recommended by a group of ministers after the Kargil war under the NDA government. Although A.B. Vajpayees cabinet also left a decision on the post hanging, the NDA is perceived to be in favour of creating the office.

 However, its merits and demerits are also being debated among the services with navy chief Admiral Arun Prakash, who is also the chairman, chiefs of staff committee, supporting it but the air force opposed to the proposal and the army waffling.

 The defence ministry has not received the opinion of the Left, which is likely to be expressed after it has been briefed on the issue. Political queries on the CDS range from whether the post would be rotational ? i.e. held in turn by the chiefs of the armed services ? and what powers would be conferred on the office. 

 There would be questions on whether the powers conferred on the CDS would dilute the powers of the minister.

 Although the Centre is yet to take a decision, it has already put in place institutions that would function directly under the CDS like the Strategic Forces Command, the Integrated Staff Headquarters and the Andaman and Nicobar Tri-Service Command.

 The office of the heads of each of these institutions will be held in turn by the army, navy and the air force. The nomenclature of the headquarters of the armed services was also changed last year. They are now called the Integrated Headquarters of Defence even though in everyday use they are called army headquarters, naval headquarters and air force headquarters.

 In May, the armed forces also presented a joint doctrine that envisages pooling in of the resources of the army, navy and the air force for future military operations.

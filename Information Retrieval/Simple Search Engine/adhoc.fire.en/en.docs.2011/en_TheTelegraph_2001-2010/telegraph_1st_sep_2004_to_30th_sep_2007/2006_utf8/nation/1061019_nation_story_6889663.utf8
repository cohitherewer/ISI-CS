The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Party amp; govt in shuffle tango

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 New Delhi, Oct. 18: The impending changes in the cabinet and the All India Congress Committee, which were supposed to have been independent of one another, have got interlinked.

 Sources in the government and the Congress said both exercises would take place after Diwali for various reasons, despite Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs statements that a new external affairs minister would be appointed at the earliest.

 The main reason for the delay is that the Prime Ministers perceived desire to give the berth to Pranab Mukherjee will probably not be fulfilled. Not because the defence minister was reluctant, as sections of the Congress had insinuated, but because of the perception that the shift would create procedural and protocol problems.

 Mukherjee is number two in the Union council of ministers and presides over cabinet meetings, and the government in general, when the Prime Minister is out of the capital.

 Government sources said if a particular high-powered foreign visit required both Singh and Mukherjee to be away, there will be a problem in picking a minister to officiate for the Prime Minister. Shivraj Patil, Arjun Singh, Lalu Prasad or H.R. Bhardwaj? There is no clarity on this issue, there will be only confusion, one of the sources said.

 It appears that Patil, the home minister, could move to external affairs. Power minister Sushil Kumar Shinde is expected to replace Patil. The Congresss treasurer, Motilal Vora, may leave the party headquarters and take Shindes place.

 Although Patil was regarded as a loyalist of 10 Janpath, it is believed that Congress president Sonia Gandhi is not happy with his performance in the home ministry. One of the factors that apparently turned the tide against him was a spurt in minorities complaints of harassment by police after terror strikes.

 In the Nainital conclave of Congress chief ministers, when a question on Patil as home minister was put to Sonia and Singh, she gave an ambiguous answer and handed the mike to the Prime Minister.

 Congress members construed that as a sign of disapproval, saying if she wanted to bail out Patil, she could have given a categorical reply. We need a minority-friendly face in the home ministry and Shinde, a Dalit, fits the bill, a Congress general secretary said. 

 According to party sources, Ahmed Patel, the political secretary to Sonia, could come back as treasurer. He used to hold the job before Vora. 

 The sources said Sonia might abolish the political secretarys post or elevate the general secretary and chairman of the media cell, Janardhan Dwivedi, to the second-most powerful slot in the party hierarchy.

 Dwivedis detractors have been putting out the theory that the political secretarys post had become superfluous now that the Congress was in power and Sonia was in direct touch with the Prime Minister.

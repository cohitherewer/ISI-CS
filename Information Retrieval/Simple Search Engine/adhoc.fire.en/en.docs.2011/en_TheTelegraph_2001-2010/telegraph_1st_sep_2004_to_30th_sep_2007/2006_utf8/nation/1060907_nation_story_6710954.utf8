 Insat witch-hunt not Isro style

 - Crash cause identified, but defaulter company not to be blacklisted

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Bangalore, Sept. 6: The private company whose faulty mechanical component cau-sed the July 10 burn-out of the GSLV F02 vehicle only 62 seconds after launch will not be blacklisted, Isro chairman Madhavan Nair said today.

 According to the failure analysis committee, a defective regulator shut down the strap-on motor four 0.2 seconds after lift-off. From then on, there was no control on the vehicle, which veered off course and disintegrated, Nair said.

 He blamed an inadvertent error in the fabrication of the regulator by the company, which he refused to name.

 We have taken necessary action. We are not going to blacklist the company. There are many critical parts that go into the launch vehicle and deviation may occur due to statistical probability. Witch-hunting is not part of Isros culture. I take full responsibility for the launch failure, which cost Rs 250 crore, Nair added.

 The failure analysis panel, headed by former Sriharikota launch complex director K. Narayana, said there was a sudden loss of thrust in one of the four liquid propellant strap-on stages, reducing the vehicles control capability. 

 Nair said it was the first time that the mechanical device, which costs about Rs 1 lakh, failed. The company had supplied similar components that were used in seven successful launches, he said. Only this time, the regulator had a diameter of 16 mm, instead of 17 mm. 

 This incident will not affect private participation. We only want the industry to come up to our strict standards as 60 per cent of our components come from private firms. We have already conducted a review with our suppliers, another will be held next week, Nair said.

 The panel did, however, say manufacturing errors in the regulator had escaped inspection and acceptance-test procedures. 

 Nair said the committee found the GSLV design robust, but said Isro would accept all suggestions to enforce stricter control on fabrication, inspection and acceptance procedures. We are planning to measure more parameters during countdown and launch. We have to ensure nothing is left to chance.

 The GSLV flight will be launched again in June next year. Those who hired transponders on the Insat-4C payload the launch vehicle was carrying when it disintegrated on July 10, have been allotted spare ones. 

 However, the KU band transponders hired by Sun TV are unaffected as the company delayed its DTH plans. When they are ready, we will shift them to one of our international partners till Insat-4C is launched, Nair said.

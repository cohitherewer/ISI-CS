 No mole in Jaswant letter: PMO

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 30: The Prime Ministers Office today said the letter Jaswant Singh had passed on did not have the name of the mole in P.V. Narasimha Raos office, was not an original and was not signed.

 The BJP leader had said in Mumbai yesterday that he had sent to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh the name of the person who he suspected had passed on information to American intelligence agencies about Indias nuclear programme.

 The Prime Ministers media adviser, Sanjay Baru, said a letter was received from Jaswant but it did not contain any name and the document attached was not original.

 Singh has replied to Jaswant that it (document) has no signature or letterhead. The alleged informant is not named nor is there any confirmation that the person was from the PMO.

 If you have any further information in this regard, you may wish to disclose it to the public, the Prime Ministers reply, which Baru read out, adds.

 The document sent by Jaswant is a letter written by a senior American diplomat based in India in 1995 to a US senator, excerpts from which have already appeared in a news weekly. 

 I have received your letter of July 28 regarding an informant in the PMO in the mid-1990s, Singhs reply said.

 Simultaneously, I find that a copy of the letter has been published in the latest issue of India Today. Its the same letter which has been addressed to the Prime Minister. No other information has been given.

 Jaswant made the allegation in his book A Call to Honour ? In Service of Emergent India, released recently. He later said he was ready to meet the Prime Minister and reveal the name of the mole, but did not get an appointment from Singh who said that since the BJP leader had chosen to make the allegation in public he could make the name public, too. 

 Jaswant, who served as foreign minister in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government, dropped hints about the persons identity and said he had direct access to Narasimha Rao but gave no names. Yesterday, he said he had written a letter to the Prime Minister.

 In his reply, Singh has wondered why Jaswant did not give the information he had to Vajpayee.

 I am, however, surprised that the material sent by you was in your possession when you were a member of the Union council of ministers and still you did not share it with my predecessor, the Prime Ministers reply said. 

 Jaswant has not responded yet, but BJP spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad said he would.

 Govt prepares pitch for DD

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 World cup in sight 

 New Delhi, Oct. 16: The government this month plans to bring about an ordinance making it mandatory for private channels to share live footage of cricket and other big sports events with Doordarshan.

 The ordinance is seen as a move by the government to have its way on an issue over which it has been taken to court in the past.

 Sources said the Centre could seek the promulgation of the ordinance by the President on Thursday when the Union cabinet is expected to meet, or it could defer the decision till the next cabinet meeting a week later. In any case, the government appears keen that the ordinance is in place before the ICC World Cup, to be held in West Indies early next year.

 The stipulation that private channels share live feed from cricket matches and other sports events of national importance with the public broadcaster is already part of the Centres downlinking guidelines.

 In April 2006, the ministry followed that up with an order listing the events other than cricket ties that were dealt with separately deemed to be of national importance. 

 But it faced a legal challenge from Ten Sports, which had the rights to broadcast some cricket matches. The case is pending but the Supreme Court has restrained the government from enforcing the order.

 The court had asked the government counsel why the Centre did not bring in a law yet to deal with the matter. After objections by broadcasters, the government began working on a fresh draft of the bill, which deals with compulsory sharing of sports footage, among other issues.

 The government could cite the anticipated delay in introducing the bill in Parliament as a reason for the stop-gap measure of promulgating an ordinance.

 In the downlinking guidelines, the Centre has suggested a 75:25 sharing of revenue between private broadcasters and Doordarshan. Elsewhere, it has cited the practice in other countries where public broadcasters get to telecast sports events, even if private cable channels have won the exclusive rights to do so after outbidding others.

 Broadcasters, however, complain that the government fiat is not fair as private channels spend crores on buying telecast rights. 

 ESPN managing director R.C. Venkateish was reluctant to comment till an ordinance was actually promulgated. We cannot comment on speculation, he told The Telegraph. But he added: Our stand is well known.

 The events of national importance listed by the information and broadcasting ministry range from the Olympics and the Commonwealth Games to the Davis Cup and the Chess Olympiad. Semi-finals and after fall under this category. But if an Indian is playing, footage has to be shared from a lower level of the competition.

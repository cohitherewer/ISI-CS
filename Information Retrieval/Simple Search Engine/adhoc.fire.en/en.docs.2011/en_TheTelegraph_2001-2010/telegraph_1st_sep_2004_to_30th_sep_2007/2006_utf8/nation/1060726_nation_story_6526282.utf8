 Bully sons wife, shell out $65000

 London, July 25 (PTI): A British court has ordered a non-resident Indian woman to pay $65,000 as compensation to her daughter-in-law for subjecting her to bullying and humiliation. 

 Gina Satvir Singh, 26, told the Nottingham county court she was bullied, isolated and became seriously ill after an arranged marriage with Hardeep Bhakar in November 2002. She sued her former mother-in-law Dalbir Kaur Bhakar, 52, under the Protection of Harassment Act. 

 She alleged that Dalbir imposed a 17-hour daily regime of housework, forced her to bleach her skin and cut her hair, and restricted contact with her family. Gina also said she was forbidden to leave the house alone and was not allowed to listen to the radio, read newspapers or watch television. 

 Dalbir denied the allegations, but her claims of innocence were rejected.

 Yesterdays judgment said: The course of conduct towards Gina was not merely negligent, or even reckless, but deliberate. She was utterly miserable during those four months, and was suffering from what was for her an incomprehensible personal attack.

 Gina, who started working in her familys clothing and fashion businesses after leaving school at 16, rose to a managerial position before moving from Bunny in Nottinghamshire to Ilford in Essex to live in her marital home. 

 Gina, who entered into the marriage willingly, said: We were very happy together. But Dalbirs campaign of torment led to serious health problems and the breakdown of the marriage, she said. They divorced in November 2003. 

 Legal experts view the verdict as a landmark as it is believed to be the first time that the law, normally used to seek safety from stalkers, has been used for a case of domestic violence.

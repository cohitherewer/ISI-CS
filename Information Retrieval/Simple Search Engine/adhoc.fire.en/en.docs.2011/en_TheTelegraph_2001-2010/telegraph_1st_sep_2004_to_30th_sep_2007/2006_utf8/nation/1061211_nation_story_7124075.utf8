 Chennai, Dec. 10: 

 Weavers in Coimbatore have created a silk sari with more 

 than one-and-a-half-lakh colours that is now looking for 

 a place in the Guinness Book of Records.

 A 15-member team took just 25 days to weave the 5.6-metre sari that has been bought for Rs 40,000 by a buyer from neighbouring Andhra Pradesh. 

 The weavers, led by senior craftsman Thirumoorthy, used 164 colours of yarn in the warp the lengthwise threads on a handloom, over and under which the weft threads are passed to make cloth and 1,003 shades in the weft. This aggregates to 164,492 colours on the finished fabric. 

 Since nobody in Tamil Nadus handloom sector has attempted so many colours on a sari in one weave so far, we have applied for entering this unique silk sari into the Guinness Book through the good offices of the Gandhigram Rural University near Madurai, said M.P. Nirmala, special officer and managing director of Cooptex, the apex handloom weavers cooperative society in Tamil Nadu. 

 The sari was woven by a team from the Sirumugaipudur Sri Ramalinga Sowdeswari Handloom Weavers Cooperative Society.

 Apart from the colours, the sari, which was briefly on display at the Cooptex headquarters in Chennai, is special because of the dominant motif on its pallu, Nirmala said. It is the motif of the suns rays dazzling on the Gopuram of the Meenakshi Amman Temple in Madurai, a heritage temple.

 The border has the pyramids of Egypt, Leaning Tower of Pisa, Eiffel Tower, Taj Mahal, Great Wall of China and the Hanging Gardens of Babylon woven into it. 

 Several Indian designs like yallis (lion-faced figures), temple cars and swans have also been woven into the pallu of the sari using computer-aided techniques, Nirmala said.

 The textiles committee of the Government of Indias ministry of textiles, after examination, certified that 164 colours had been used in the warp side and 1,003 colours in the weft side, she added. 

 The saris usually woven at the cooperative can have up to 100 colours and take five weavers anything between 15 and 20 days to complete.

 We now have six more orders for such a gigantic sari, Nirmala said.

 The weavers used 11,531 Jacquard design cards to make the wonder sari. These pattern or design cards are named after the 18th- century French weaver, Joseph M. Jacquard.

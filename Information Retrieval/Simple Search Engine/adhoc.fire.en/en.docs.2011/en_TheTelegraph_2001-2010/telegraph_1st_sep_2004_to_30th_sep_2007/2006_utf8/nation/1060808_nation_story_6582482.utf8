 Table-ready shrimps out of nuke lab

 Staying fresh 

 New Delhi, Aug. 7: The research centre that spawned Indias nuclear programme has also been preparing to cater to the Indian palate with technology to produce the countrys first shelf-stable, ready-to-eat shrimps.

 Food technology scientists at the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (Barc) in Mumbai have developed a three-step process that allows cooked shrimps to remain edible and retain their taste and texture for two months at room temperatures.

 This is an alternative to frozen shrimps, said Ramesh Chander, a senior scientist with the food technology division of the Barc. Across the country, shrimps are now sold either fresh or frozen. Fresh shrimps do not remain edible longer than a few hours because just as any other meat product they attract microorganisms, and frozen shrimps lose texture which makes them harder to chew.

 The laboratory-scale process involves oven drying, vacuum packaging and irradiation with gamma rays to eliminate microorganisms and allow the food product to remain stable for long periods at room temperatures. We cook the shrimps in typical style of Indian cuisine with spices and salt, and then apply the combination process of drying, vacuum packing and irradiation, Chander said.

 This combination treatment for shrimps is similar to a process that the Barc research team had developed three years ago for mutton kebabs.

 Scientists caution that they will be able to transfer the technology to industry only after the laboratory process has been evaluated for scaling up to industry-level capacity. In the laboratory, the technology can handle at the most 10 kg cooked shrimp or mutton kebabs a day. For industrial operations, the process would need to be refined to handle several hundred kilograms a day.

 We will also have to study market acceptability for taste, Chander said. So far, its only our own people here in the lab whove eaten the processed shrimp and they liked it. We need wider evaluation to assess marketability.

 Fisheries experts say such a technology could help increase Indias share of the market for processed or cooked shrimp.

 The demand for cooked shrimp is rising around the world, said Jacob Daniel, joint director at the Marine Products Exports Development Agency in Cochin. India mainly exports frozen shrimp today and very small quantities of cooked shrimp which is also shipped out as frozen food, he added.

 Most of Indias shrimp catch today is exported to Europe and the US. The Barc scientists say the ready-to-eat shrimps that stay edible for two months outside the freezer might also increase domestic demand.

 Chander said the three-step process needs to be fine-tuned for a specific food. After refining the process for mutton kebabs and shrimps, the researchers are now trying to develop a similar process for bacon. 

 The food technology division at the Barc has been conducting research on the use of irradiation to eliminate microorganisms in food and extend the shelf-life of food products. International health and food agencies have jointly affirmed the safety of irradiated food after extensively reviewing studies. The irradiation process does not change the freshness or texture of food.

 Two years ago, food scientists at the Barc had transferred a technology for the production of banana juice to a Thailand-based company. The technique uses enzymes present in the banana to separate juice from banana pulp.

 The health ministry has approved a number of food items including onions, potatoes, garlic, semolina, rice, raisins, chicken, meat and seafood for irradiation. Irradiated food cannot be distinguished by sight, smell or taste. But under regulations, all packages of irradiated food are expected to be labelled with a special irradiated food logo.

 Two food irradiation plants have been in operation in Maharashtra for several years. Another 15 irradiation facilities are expected to be ready for irradiation of both food and medical equipment in several towns within the next few months.

 Airport officers move SC

 SINGH GYANANT KUMAR

 New Delhi, Feb. 1: As the government accepted bids for the modernisation of Delhi and Mumbai airports, the International Airports Authority of India Officers Association today challenged the power of the executive to involve private players in the process without parliamentary sanction.

 In a special leave petition filed before the Supreme Court, the association contended that under the Airports Authority of India Act, 1994, the management of airports, civil enclaves, air traffic and other related services are vested with the AAI and no change can be brought about without legislative clearance.

 The officers moved the apex court after Delhi High Court dismissed their petition that challenged the governments decision to allow 74 per cent private equity in joint ventures for airport modernisation. The officers termed the decision excessive.

 Bidding caveats

 GMR-Fraport, which won the contract for modernisation of Delhi airport, has filed a caveat in the Supreme Court in apprehension of possible cases against the bidding process.

 A caveat is filed to ensure that the applicant is heard first.

 The International Airports Authority of India has also filed a caveat seeking to be heard before any order is passed on any petition on the bidding.

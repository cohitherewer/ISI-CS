The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

SIDELIGHTS

 Matching pace with the spanking new Delhi-Bhopal Express ? touted as the fastest-ever train in India ? Lalu Prasad sped through his budget speech, skirting the hurdles laid by the Opposition and the Left, who tried to bring the House down with their protests.

 Only once did he grace them with a response. Will you not let me take the credit? Wont you allow me to speak? he asked the shouting brigade.

 He has inspired many a couplet, but today it was the ministers turn to let his poetic juices flow.

 From showing light at the end of the tunnel to blowing his trumpet, Lalu Prasad was the raja of rhyme. 

 Hum bhi dariya hai, apna hunar hamein maloom hai/Jis taraf bhi chal padenge, rastaa ban jayega (I too am a river which knows its capabilities/Whichever course I take will become the way), he recited to thunderous applause.

 The minister got moony over public-private partnership schemes. Ek kadam hum badhe, ek kadam tum/Aao milkar naap de faasle chand tak (I will take a step forward, you take one, Let us together measure the distance to the moon).

 There was one for passengers as well. Hum na haare par woh jeete, aisa hai prayas/Musafir ho rail ka raja, hum sabki yeh aas (Let us not be defeated but let them win/Let the passenger be king, that is our common wish). Is that why he is rolling out the Garib Rath?

 The minister turned up his poetic charm, but the Opposition and the Left were unmoved. As they rained venom on Lalu Prasad, finance minister P. Chidambaram rushed to calm them down. He walked across to the Left MPs thrice to make them see reason. 

 while, the minister got thirsty ? not for more verbal lashes, though. Again, Chidambaram played rescuer, with a glass of water. 

 As pandemonium reigned in the House, the man on some minds was Somnath Chatterjee. 

 With the press gallery debating how he would have dealt with the uproar, the Lok Sabha Speaker must have had a few hiccups in hospital, where he has been admitted for breathing problems.

 Much water has flowed down the Yamuna since the self-anointed leader of the grassroots tried to court millions with his kulhars and khadi. Today, he spoke the cool language of his denim-clad children ? i-tickets, e-tickets, food plazas and food courts were on his list of amenities for the common man. Not to forget the coolest of them all ? the fully air-conditioned Garib Rath.

 They were waiting for the once-upon-a-time king of Bihar to utter Patna, and they would launch their missiles. The good sport that he is, Lalu Prasad did not disappoint ? Patna was plastered all over his speech. Every time he said either Bihar or Patna, the Opposition MPs sprang to their feet and hurled abuses. 

 For a change, leaders of the Janata Dal (United), which had snatched his crown, did not complain as he showered sop after sop on the state. 

 Our man, of course, had a repartee ready for those running him down. Every state is covered. I will publish it in newspapers. Dont get nervous, he said. 

 Sonia Gandhi was caught smiling and thumping her desk with abandon.

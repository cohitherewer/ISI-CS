 Smoking ban

 New Delhi, March 27 (PTI): The Supreme Court today transferred to Delhi High Court two petitions filed in Madras High Court challenging the Centres notification banning on-screen smoking.

 A bench of Chief Justice Y.K. Sabharwal and Justices C.K. Thakker and R.V. Raveendran passed the order on a petition filed by the Centre.

 The bench clarified that interim orders passed by Madras High Court and Delhi High Court shall remain operative unless vacated.

 Film producer Mahesh Bhatt had last year challenged the Centres notification to ban on-screen smoking.

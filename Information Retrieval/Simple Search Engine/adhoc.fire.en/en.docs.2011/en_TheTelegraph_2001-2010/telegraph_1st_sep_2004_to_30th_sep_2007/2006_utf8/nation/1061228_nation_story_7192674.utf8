 Green warning shot over Siachen troops

 -Threat to ecology

 Islamabad, Dec. 27: Heavy troop deployment at Siachen is ruining its ecology, melting the 21,000-foot-high glacier and posing the threat of tsunamis, hurricanes and devastating floods, Indian and Pakistani environmentalists have warned.

 The ecologists have asked Islamabad and Delhi to take immediate steps, including troop withdrawal which both governments say they are discussing.

 The glacier reduced by 35 per cent during the past 20 years, retreating at the rate of 110 metres per year, Pakistani environmentalist Arshad H. Abbasi said. A study has shown the glacier gets warmer by 0.20 degrees Celsius every year.

 The Indian and Pakistani armies have been facing each other across Siachen, the worlds highest battlefield, since 1984. Islamabad wants withdrawal of troops to the level of a ceasefire agreed after the 1971 war, while India wants authentication of current positions before that.

 A recent global study says the melting of Siachen and other glaciers is contributing heavily to the rise in ocean levels, sparking fears of more tsunamis and hurricanes across the world, Abbasi said.

 Experts claim that glacier recession will first lead to flooding in India and Pakistan, but later the water volumes in major rivers such as the Indus, Ganga, Mekong (in Vietnam) and the Yangtze (in China) will fall.

 Abbasi cited several factors hurting the glaciers ecology: the establishment of permanent cantonments on either side of the Saltoro ridge, the heavy air traffic to forward camps, the cutting and melting of glacial ice by chemicals, and the daily dumping of over a tonne of chemicals, metals and organic and human waste.

 Natural life, too, has suffered, with the snow leopard and ibex forced out of the main conflict zone at Siachen, a name which means the land of wild roses.

 Environmentalists, including many in the US and Europe, suggested three years ago that India and Pakistan pull their troops back, detoxify Siachen and convert it into a trans-boundary peace park. 

 Among the ideas champions are Europe-based Giulano Tallone, Pakistani-American Saleem Ali and Mumbais Bittu Sahgal of Sanctuary Asia, who has been running a signature campaign for the establishment of such a park.

 Another idea, suggested in 1998 by a researcher at US think-tank Sandia National Laboratories, is the creation of a science centre in Siachen.

 Delhi and Islamabad are discussing troop withdrawal but an agreement has stayed elusive. Pakistan foreign secretary Riaz Mohammad Khan told reporters he had exchanged ideas with his Indian counterpart, S.S. Menon, last month, and there would be further talks in February. For the environmentalists, these claims are mere lollipops.

 The time has come for people in India and Pakistan to think of ways that may lead to the prevention of further recession of the glacier, Abbasi said.

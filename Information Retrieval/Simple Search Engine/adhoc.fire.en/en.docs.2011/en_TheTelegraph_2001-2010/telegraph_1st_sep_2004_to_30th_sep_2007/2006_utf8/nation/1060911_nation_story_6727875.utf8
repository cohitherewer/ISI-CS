 Spyder to target flying threats

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 10: The army has decided to buy an Israeli missile defence system called the Spyder and has forwarded a Rs 1,100-crore acquisition programme to the Cabinet Committee on Security to buy four regiments of the weapon.

 A missile regiment may have up to six systems.

 The Spyder was presented at Defexpo the defence exhibition in the city early this year.

 For India, the road-mobile systems would be mounted on Tatra trucks that the army already uses for some of its heavy equipment. Tatra trucks were originally procured from the Czech but are now indigenously made.

 The decision to buy the Israeli system further diversifies the armys inventory. Israel is the second largest supplier of military equipment to India but way behind the Russians.

 Both the countries are also considering a joint venture project with the Ordnance Factory, Khamaria, to manufacture cargo ammunition. Israel is in the process of selling three Phalcon airborne early warning systems that were contracted in 2004 for more than $1 billion.

 The Indian armed forces have also bought an unknown number running into hundreds of unmanned aerial vehicles from Israel.

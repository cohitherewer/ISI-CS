The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Superstar in new role as Super CM 

 M.R. VENKATESH

 Vijayakant: One-man party

 Chennai, May 24: The first signs of his self-confidence came in the run-up to the state polls, when the political greenhorn decided his party would contest all 234 seats.

 Within weeks he had turned spoiler for Jayalalithaa, ruining her chances by eating heavily into her votes.

 Now, days after having done M. Karunanidhi such a huge favour, film superstar Vijayakant has begun proving his potential for nuisance to the chief minister.

 The man who dresses like the late MGR is acting as if he were a super chief minister, a source said.

 Despite being the only member of his Desiya Murpokku Dravidar Kazhagam to have won an Assembly seat, the first-time MLA has been strutting about the states political scene making extravagant statements, declaring himself a cut above the average politician.

 It all began in the Assembly during the Speakers election. Condescending to attend the House after gentle prodding by pro-tem Speaker D. Sudarshanam, Vijayakant grabbed the microphone with a flourish.

 I may be a single-member party in the 234-member House, he boasted in his maiden speech, but I represent the voice of 28 lakh voters who voted for our party, particularly the unemployed youth.

 He then surprised everyone by swaggering off to Viruddachalam, his constituency, on Monday to spruce up his MLAs office without waiting for the governor to make his address to the House on Wednesday.

 He first met the media there, and then walked into the sub-collectors chamber to speak to a group of officials led by the deputy collector.

 This is unheard of, the source in Chennai said. An MLA -- a first-timer at that ? hardly ever directly addresses a meeting of officials so soon after his election.

 The actor has been dripping aggression in Viruddachalam. The man dubbed the Karuppu (dark-complexioned) MGR because of his fur cap and dark glasses has gone out of his way to promise a fight with the ruling DMK, if necessary, in the interests of the constituency.

 I am a different kind of man, Vijayakant is reported to have told the officials. I have come to politics to serve the people, and officials should extend all cooperation to me.

 He said he would restrict his acting career to possibly two films a year. But I need to continue with my acting, because I want to serve my people with the money I earn from films.

 He promised to expand the government boys higher secondary school in Viruddachalam and upgrade the government hospital.

 I will make Viruddachalam a model constituency, he declared at a rally in the town on Monday night, promising to visit the constituency at least once a month when the Assembly is not in session.

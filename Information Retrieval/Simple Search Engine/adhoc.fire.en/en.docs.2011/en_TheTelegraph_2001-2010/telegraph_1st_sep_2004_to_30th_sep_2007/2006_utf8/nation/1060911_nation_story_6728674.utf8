 Calcutta, Sept. 10: Queen was playing, Rani was watching and the audience was clapping in the middle of the show.

 They couldnt believe such a mature collection could come out of India, gushed Sabyasachi Mukherjee moments after he scorched the ramp with his spring-summer 2007 collection at the Olympus Fashion Week 2006 in New York.

 The applause at Bryant Park UPS on Saturday was encouraging, as was the response from buyers after the show.

 Members of the audience broke into claps in the middle of the show as some of the silhouettes came on the ramp, Sabya told The Telegraph from New York.

 Among the front-benchers were fashion editors from the US and Europe and a sprinkling of foreign celebrities. Besides Rani, filmdom was represented by Mira Nair and actress Sarita Chowdhury and Indira Verma.

 Top fashion stores of Europe, the US and Japan, including Browns, Selfridges, Saks Fifth Avenue, Goyce, Harvey Nichols, Bloomingdales and Barneys, were among the potential buyers.

 The energy and excitement level was very high, both backstage and on the ramp, Sabya said. Models with their hair adorned with large flower bouquets sashayed in high-heeled alligator-skin boots. Earrings made of cloth buttons and the occasional reading glasses Sabyas models sported were hugely appreciated.

 The collection starts where The Snail (the designers much-acclaimed autumn-winter 2006-07 line) ends, said Sabya.

 The colour was a happy blend of European and Indian hues like forest greens, bold reds, fresh pinks and blues, saffron, indigo, beige and camel. Silhouettes ranged from micro minis to super long, from body-fitting to oversized. Dresses, pants, jackets and more completed the line.

 A couple of maxis had everyone clapping, said Sabya. The clincher, he believes, was the technical maturity and the commercial viability of the collection. Talking of technique, he said he had used discharge printing, block printing, quilting, beading, pleating, pin-tucks and gathering.

 The carefully chosen music it started with sounds from rock band Nirvana and ended with Freddie Mercurys Queen was also a neat fit for the ambience, Sabya said. Since it was New York, I decided to use peppy music. While the styling of the collection was very girlie, I chose to use grown-up music.

 The show over, the designer hunkered down for talks with buyers. Next, he is heading for the London Fashion Week, starting September 19. Sabya will have a stall at the Natural History Museum, the venue of the event.

 I am really glad that I received such support from some members of the Indian community here. My main sponsors Lakme and Bombay Dyeing have helped me reach here, Sabya said.

 The presence of Rani, a Sabya loyalist ever since Black, was a special treat. Rani is shooting in New York and it felt so good that she cancelled half days shoot to watch the show, said the 29-year-old.

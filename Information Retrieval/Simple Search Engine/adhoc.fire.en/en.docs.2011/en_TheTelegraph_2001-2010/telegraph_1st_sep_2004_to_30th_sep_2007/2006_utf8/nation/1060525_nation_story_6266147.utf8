 Jaya clears return hurdle

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, May 24: Jaya Bachchan today resigned from the Uttar Pradesh Film Development Council, a post that cost her a Rajya Sabha seat and triggered a storm.

 The expelled Samajwadi MP (in picture) will now file nomination papers for a fresh election to the Upper House.

 Jaya had no option but to quit as chairperson of the council as the post was not kept outside the purview of offices of profit in the bill passed recently by Parliament.

 Her party colleague Amar Singh, however, had reason to rejoice as the Uttar Pradesh Development Corporation, of which he is the chairperson, figures on the list.

 Chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav who was upset over the Centres decision to exclude the film development council from the bill had told the Assembly last week that it was part of the UPA governments conspiracy to harass Jaya. He told his close aides later that he was determined to send her back to the Rajya Sabha.

 She comes from a respectable family. She has a reputation of her own as a respectable actress. If she does not qualify as a member of Rajya Sabha, who will? he asked.

 Election to two Rajya Sabha posts ? one vacated by Jaya and another by industrialist Anil Ambani ? will be held on June 15.

 The first day of filing nominations is Sunday ? this is when Jaya is likely to file her papers ? and the last is June 5. June 8 has been fixed as the last date for withdrawal of nomination papers.

 The Samajwadi Party is still searching for a name to nominate for Ambanis seat, but Jayas candidature is final, sources said.

 Ambani had quit the Rajya Sabha in March in the wake of the office of profit controversy. But the sources said he wanted to concentrate more on his business.

 The seat vacated by Ambani may see a tough contest as both the BJP and the Congress are set to field their candidates. 

 Jaya had entered Rajya Sabha in June 2004, but her stint came to an abrupt end in March this year when an advocate from Kanpur filed a case against her for holding an office of profit. The Election Commission disqualified her from the Rajya Sabha on March 16 with retrospective effect from July 14, 2004, 10 days after her election.

 Jaya moved the Supreme Court against the poll panel order, but it dismissed her petition.

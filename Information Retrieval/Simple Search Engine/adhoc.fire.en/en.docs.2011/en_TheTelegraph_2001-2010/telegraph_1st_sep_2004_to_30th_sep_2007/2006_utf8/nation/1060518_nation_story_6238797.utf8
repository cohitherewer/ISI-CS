The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 List cleared, Gogoi silent 

 OUR BUREAU

 May 17: Some big names, a couple of lesser-known names, trusted aides and at least one comeback man figured in a list of legislators chosen by chief minister Tarun Gogoi, altered and approved by the high command today for inclusion in his council of ministers, to be sworn in tomorrow.

 The high command has cleared the names of Congress MLAs who will take oath tomorrow in Guwahati, Gogoi said in Delhi just when speculation about who will make it had reached fever pitch. 

 The chief minister, however, refused to disclose the names of the legislators who would take oath as ministers at the Pragjyotish ITA Centre for Performing Arts in Guwahati.

 Sources said the list submitted by Gogoi to the high command contained 14 names, excluding Pradyut Bordoloi and Ripun Bora ? both ministers in the previous government ? and veteran Sarat Barkatoky. A slot was reserved for a representative of the Koch-Rajbongshi community, but Gogoi did not name any candidate.

 A committee of Congress leaders Pranab Mukherjee, Motilal Vohra and Kamal Nath scrutinised the list before sending it to party chief Sonia Gandhi for the final seal. 

 At the last stop, out went three of Gogois original choices ? Bidya Sing Engleng, Ajit Singh and Sarat Saikia ? and in came Bordoloi, Bora and Barkatoky.

 Two berths were kept open for an expansion of the ministry at a later date.

 Bengal arsenic curse spreads

New Delhi, Sept. 18: The Ganga plain in Uttar Pradesh might be plagued by arsenic-laced groundwater just like parts of Bengal and Bangladesh, a survey by a Calcutta-based research team has revealed.

 The two-year survey in three districts of Uttar Pradesh Ballia, Gazipur and Varanasi in the upper and middle Ganga plain has detected unacceptably high arsenic levels in groundwater samples and signs of health impact on the local people.

 Scientists from Jadavpur University who studied water from 4,780 tubewells have found that one in five wells had arsenic levels that exceeded Indias permissible limit of 50 micrograms per litre. And doctors from the Institute of Post Graduate Medical Education and Research, SSKM Hospital, detected arsenic-related skin problems in one in five of about 690 adults examined.

 In a paper in the journal Science of the Total Environment, the researchers have warned that people in the Ganga plain who depend on groundwater for drinking may be in severe danger. 

 We had predicted this three years ago, and the UP government did not believe us, Dipankar Chakraborti, principal investigator at the School of Environmental Studies at Jadavpur University, said.

 A limited survey in Semria Ojjha Patti in Bihar in 2003 had thrown up evidence of arsenic in groundwater and health problems among people there. They suggested that it might be a problem more widespread than presumed and might be affecting the middle and upper Ganga plains.

 The researchers believe that Himalayan rivers carry sediments rich in arsenic-minerals that provide an opportunity for arsenic to seep into the groundwater downstream along the rivers trajectory.

 The studies in Uttar Pradesh show that older tubewells had a greater chance of contamination. A similar pattern has been observed in Bengal and Bangladesh, he said.

 The Calcutta doctors examined 989 people in Ballia and Gazipur and found that nearly 20 per cent of adults and 5 per cent of children had typical arsenic-related skin lesions.

 The survey also revealed arsenic build-up in the hair and nails. Earlier studies had also revealed severe arsenic contamination in groundwater in Bihars Bhojpur district.

 Four years ago, researchers estimated that some six million people in nine districts in Bengal are drinking water with arsenic levels higher than the permissible limits and over 300,000 people in the state have visible skin lesions.

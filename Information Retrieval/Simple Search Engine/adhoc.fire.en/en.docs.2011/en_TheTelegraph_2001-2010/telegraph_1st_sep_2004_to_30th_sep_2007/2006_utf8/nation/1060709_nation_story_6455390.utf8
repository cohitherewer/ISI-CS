 Grenade targets MLA, 5 others die

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Srinagar, July 8: A National Conference legislator and former minister survived but five persons, including a former MLA, were killed in a grenade explosion in Kulgam this afternoon.

 The attack at the south Kashmir town wounded 39 people, besides Sakina Itoo, who has survived several attempts on her life.

 Militants lobbed the powerful grenade at the Opposition National Conference leader when she was coming out of a shrine in Kulgam, 74 km from Srinagar. Sakina reportedly suffered minor injuries.

 One person died on the spot while four others, including Ghulam Nabi Dar, a former NC legislator, succumbed to injuries later, said G.A. Peer, district magistrate of Anantnag.

 The injured include four policemen.

 Twenty critically injured people were referred to Srinagar for specialised treatment while nine were being treated in the sub-district hospital in Anantnag, Peer said.

 An army helicopter was sent to Kulgam to bring Sakina to Srinagar.

 Sakinas father, former Assembly Speaker Wali Mohammad Itoo, was gunned down by militants in Jammu in 1994.

 Militants have carried out several grenade attacks across the state during the last one month.

 Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Ghulam Nabi Azad recently said infiltration of armed militants has been three to four times higher compared to the last three summers.

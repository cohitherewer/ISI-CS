 Indians top diabetes, heart risk list in UK

 AMIT ROY

 London, March 12: Indians in the UK are much more vulnerable to heart attacks and diabetes than the rest of the population, a study has revealed.

 The author of the report, Professor Paul Durrington of Manchester University, has launched his findings at the House of Commons and called for urgent action to combat the growing epidemic of health problems among British Asians, which he blamed on diet and lifestyle.

 It is known that Indians will not abandon their food nor will they take adequate exercise. Not too many people follow the example of, say, Lakshmi Mittal who goes for a daily swim (though the steel baron does have the advantage of having his own pool).

 Many more women, alas, are starting to resemble cuddly film director Gurinder Chadha, whose Bend It Like Beckham paid tribute to the joys of being able to cook a full Indian meal.

 In his report, which is funded by the British Heart Foundation, Durrington said services in both primary and secondary care should be more pro-active in seeking out risk factors, as well as educating high-risk groups on how to reduce the risk.

 Research suggests that British men and women whose families are from the Indian sub-continent are about 50 per cent more at risk of coronary heart diseases than Europeans. 

 Evidence also shows that 20 per cent are diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, compared with only 3 per cent of the general population.

 Durrinton said: Of immediate concern are the high rates of untreated diabetes, abnormal cholesterol levels and high blood pressure among South East Asians in the UK. The good news is that the final outcomes of cardiovascular disease, such as heart attack and stroke, could be reduced significantly by identifying and addressing risk factors earlier on.

 There are today many yoga classes held throughout the UK. Their common feature is that almost none is attended by Indians.

 One medical expert has suggested that Indians get out a tape measure to assess just how unhealthy they are.

 Sudhesh Kumar, professor of medicine, diabetes and metabolism at the University of Warwick, said: Recent studies suggest that using a tape measure could be a more accurate way of measuring your cardiovascular and metabolic risk than relying on body mass index alone.

 He said: If you are an Asian woman and have a waist circumference of more than 80 cm or a man with a waist circumference of 90 cm, you are at greater risk of heart disease and diabetes and should seek advice.

 A department of health spokeswoman said: We are well aware that people from minority ethnic communities have up to a six times higher than average risk of developing diabetes ? that is why we are tackling poor diet on a national scale and backing a pilot project working with Asian communities to prevent cardiovascular disease and diabetes by encouraging healthier lifestyles. Reducing obesity is one of our key priorities and work under way includes a new cross-government obesity campaign and food labelling to help people buy healthier food and further work with industry to reduce salt, fat, sugar and portion sizes.

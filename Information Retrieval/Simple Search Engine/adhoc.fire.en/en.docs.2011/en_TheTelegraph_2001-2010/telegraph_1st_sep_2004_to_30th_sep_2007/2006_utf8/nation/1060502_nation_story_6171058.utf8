 Museum safety drive

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 1: The Centre has told the Supreme Court that security arrangements at all major museums were being upgraded in accordance with the recommendations of a committee.

 The recommendations had been forwarded to several important museums, including Victoria Memorial, the National Council of Science and the Maulana Abul Kalam Azad Institute of Asian Studies in Calcutta, for implementation, the Centre said.

 Responding to a PIL seeking special protection for historical assets after the theft of Rabindranath Tagores Nobel medal in March 2004, the Centre said it had constituted a panel to recommend security measures at par with international standards.

 The state governments had been asked to apply for financial assistance for security-related equipment under the museum grant scheme, the affidavit filed by the Centre said.

 The Centre added that it agreed in principle to depute an outside agency for periodic physical verification of historical objects in museums. But it admitted that no specialised training was being provided to security personnel posted in museums.

 The court asked petitioner Subhash Datta to file his response to the affidavit in a week.

 Vijayan ashes

 New Delhi, March 15 (PTI): Nearly a year after the death of Malayali cartoonist and writer .V. Vijayan, Delhi High Court yesterday directed that his ashes be immersed in the Ganges, settling a family dispute. 

 The court has permitted Vijayans wife and son to perform the rituals before his nephew and cartoonist Ravishankar immerses the ashes. 

 Although Vijayan, 75, died last March, his last rites have not been performed yet because of dispute over funeral rites between his wife and US-based son, who moved court, and Ravishankar. The cremation of Vijayan, who was given a state funeral by the Kerala government, was performed by Ravishankar.

 While the wife and son wanted the ashes to be immersed in either Godavari or Periyar, Ravishankar insisted on the Ganges.

 Yesterday, the court ruled that the wife and son should first be permitted to perform the necessary rituals, after which the nephew will immerse the ashes in the Ganges at Hardwar. 

 The fight over the ashes of Vijayan has turned out to be more fierce than the struggle for Ashes in cricket matches played between England and Australia, said Justice A.K. Sikri, who passed the order.

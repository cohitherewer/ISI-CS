 Remote warriors for IAF eyes in sky

 The Heron UAV: On rebel watch

 New Delhi, Sept. 27: The Indian Air Force is raising a special cadre of remote control warriors that will be dedicated to flying Israel-supplied unmanned aerial vehicles after practically junking an Indian-made drone that has been found to be good enough for target practice only.

 The air force sees the need for a committed cadre of at least 300 for the Israeli-made Searcher Mark II and the Heron UAVs the IAFs eyes in the sky that are also now being used for internal security operations with two deployed for surveillance in Naxalite territory in Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh. The cadre will increase with the expansion of the UAV fleet.

 The acquisition of the Israeli-made UAVs is being done alongside dismal results that the IAF has reported with the Nishant Remotely Piloted Vehicle made by the Defence Research and Development Organisations Aeronautical Development Establishment in Bangalore.

 So poor has the feedback on the Nishant been that the IAF has quietly been using it as only target aircraft. IAF fighters hone their shooting skills by firing at the target aircraft version of the Nishant called the Lakshya.

 In December last year, the cabinet committee on security asked the IAF to order 12 indigenously made Nishant a programme that began in 1988 for Rs 1.5 crore. But after their experience with the Israeli-made drones, the air force is less than enthusiastic about the Nishant order.

 The two Israeli-made UAVs being used in counter-Naxalite operations have been moved from their base in western commands Bhatinda to the Allahabad-headquartered central command. Air headquarters has also established a special UAV cell to raise the cadre that will be increased in number with the progressive acquisition of the pilotless aircraft.

 The exact number of UAVs with the forces is a closely guarded secret but the IAF is said to have less than 50 currently and the navy this January commissioned its first squadron of six UAVs. Each UAV has a crew of four and is operated from the ground. The commands to the UAV follow line of sight, meaning the UAVs have to remain visible to their operators for their pictures to be taken and transmitted to base.

 The IAF has reported that the deployment of UAVs during Operation Parakram the year-long stand-off of Indian and Pakistani militaries in 2001-2003 yielded excellent results. Since then, the forces have been using UAVs in Kashmir and, starting this year, in counter-Naxalite operations.

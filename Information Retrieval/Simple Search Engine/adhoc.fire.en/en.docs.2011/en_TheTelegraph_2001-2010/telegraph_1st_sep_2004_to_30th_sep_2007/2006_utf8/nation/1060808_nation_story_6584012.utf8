 Mumbai, Aug. 7: More than 52 people were killed and an estimated one lakh evacuated from flood-affected areas of Maharashtra as heavy rain heaped more misery on farmers, especially in Vidarbha, where hopes of a better crop appear to be sinking fast.

 In Mumbai, the incessant downpour sent residents scurrying to gauge the rainfall to ensure they did not get marooned. Till 8.30 am, Colaba in south Mumbai had received 191 mm rain, while Santa Cruz in the western suburbs recorded 224 mm. The figures were nowhere close to the record-breaking 944 mm that inundated the city on July 26, 2005.

 Heavy rainfall till late afternoon prompted office-goers to leave for home early on a day when attendance in schools and offices was thin anyway.

 Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh and his deputy, R. R. Patil visited low-lying areas like Kalina in west Mumbai early this morning before carrying out aerial surveys of flood-affected districts of the state later in the day.

 The scenario also looked grim in the rest of Maharashtra, where army columns, navy boats and air force helicopters carried out evacuation and relief operations. 

 A spokesperson for the Maharashtra government said of the 52 deaths reported, 31 were from Marathawada. In this region, 15,332 people were evacuated to safety. He said the rain had hit 85 tehsils and 678 villages in 12 districts.

 Officials said in Nanded, 34 villages were reeling under floods. Over 45,000 people had to be shifted to safe locations by an army column, three choppers, and eight boats. Seven people were reported dead. 

 In the adjacent Hingoli district, 34 villages were ravaged by swollen waters; 347 families were airlifted to safety. In Jalna, 17 villages were battling the floods, while 200 families were shifted to safe zones. 

 The administration was preparing for rescue operations in another 35 villages likely to be flooded from the water gushing out of the Jayakwadi reservoir. 

 Five deaths were reported here. In Parbhani, floods affected nine tehsils and 172 villages, killing five. In all, 3,475 people were evacuated to 29 relief camps set up by the district administration.

 In Andhra Pradesh, almost a million people have been marooned or are stranded in water-logged villages and towns, where the tributaries of the Godavari, Vashista and Penagana, have left a trail of destruction. 

 Thousands of tribals hung on to trees and spent nights on hillocks in West and East Godavari districts even as chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy sought army and navy support for relief and rescue operations.

 Over three lakh people are affected in the East and West Godavari districts alone, said Debabratha Kanta, an official of the state disaster-management cell. 

 The toll in the four days of torrential rain and flooding has touched 102 and left nearly a million homeless.

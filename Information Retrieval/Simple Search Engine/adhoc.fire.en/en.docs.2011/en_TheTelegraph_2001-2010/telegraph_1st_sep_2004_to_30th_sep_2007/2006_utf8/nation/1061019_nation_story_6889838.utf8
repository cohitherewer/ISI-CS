 One step closer to cracking autism

 New Delhi, Oct. 18: Italian and US researchers have identified a mutation in a gene that increases the risk of autism and have possibly nudged medical science a step closer to fathoming the causes of this devastating neurological condition.

 Researchers at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, and their collaborators have shown that a variant of a gene called MET is common in children with autism, and appears more frequently in families that have more than one child with autism.

 The mutation appears to raise the risk of autism by 2.27 times, Pat Levitt and his colleagues said in a research report on Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

 Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder in which an affected person finds it difficult to express needs either verbally or non-verbally, repeats words or phrases instead of responding to queries, displays emotions for no apparent reason, and dislikes departure from routine. About one in 500 people has autism.

 In recent years, doctors around the world have reported an increase in the diagnosis of autism, but they say it is unclear whether this is a true rise in the incidence of autism or whether the higher numbers result from greater awareness and more diagnosis now than before.

 While scientists have long speculated that as yet unknown factors in the environment might contribute to autism, a number of studies have suggested it has a genetic component. These studies suggest that only those genetically susceptible individuals who get exposed to factors in the environment develop autism.

 The MET gene that Levitt and his colleagues studied has been shown to contribute to the development of the cerebral cortex and cerebellum, two key areas of the brain that display developmental disruptions in autism, the researchers said. They hypothesise that the mutation in the MET gene works with other vulnerability genes and factors in the environment to precipitate the onset of autism.

 The discovery of a candidate gene is important because it might provide insight into the mechanisms of autism, said Nihar Ranjan Jana, a scientist at the National Brain Research Centre in Gurgaon. And that might be a first step towards designing therapy, he said.

 The candidate gene might also allow researchers to identify the environmental factors that contribute to autism, Jana said.

 The mutation could be inserted into mice and the mice could be exposed to various environmental factors from chemicals to psychological stress to determine which factor leads to symptoms that resemble autism, he said.

 But creating an animal model for autism is one of the biggest challenges ahead, said Jana.

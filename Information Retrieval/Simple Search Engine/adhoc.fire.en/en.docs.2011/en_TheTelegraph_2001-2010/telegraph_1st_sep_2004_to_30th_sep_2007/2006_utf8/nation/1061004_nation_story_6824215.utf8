 Blast arrest

 Mumbai, Oct. 3: A man who had been let off in a bomb-making case was arrested today for planting explosive devices for the July 11 train blasts. 

 Asif Bashir Khan alias Junaid was brought from Belgaum in Karnataka and arrested in Mumbai.

 The 35-year-old suspect has been charged in similar cases in the past and was out on bail. He has six criminal cases registered against him.

 Khan was a suspect in a 2001 bomb manufacturing case in Jalegaon. But he was acquitted because of lack of evidence, police said.

 Khan is the sixteenth person to be arrested in connection with the train blasts.

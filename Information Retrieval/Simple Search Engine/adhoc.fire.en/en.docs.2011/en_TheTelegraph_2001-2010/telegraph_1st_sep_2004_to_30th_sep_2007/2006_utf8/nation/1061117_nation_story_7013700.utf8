 Cop family for kid

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Teja Sri with an officer

 Hyderabad, Nov. 16: An 11-year-old girl whom her grandmother couldnt afford to send to school has become the latest instrument in the polices propaganda war against the Maoists.

 Teja Sri, daughter of CPI (Maoist) central committee member Lanka Papi Reddy, has been adopted by the police who are paying the Class VI students school fees.

 Those who cannot take care of their own families, what can they do for society? deputy inspector-general of police Ravi Gupta said today. The Naxalites should discharge their duties to their aged parents and their children.

 Papi Reddy, who now operates in Chhattisgarh, was secretary of the rebels Dandakaranya special zonal committee when Teja Sri was born to him and his wife, a fellow Naxalite. When the baby was a year old, Reddy sent her to live with his mother in Warangal.

 Ten years on, during a recent counselling of guerrillas families by the police, Reddys mother Laxmikanthamma told officers she couldnt afford her granddaughters school fees any more.

 The 65-year-old grandmother sought our help to bring up the child and we readily accepted, said Warangal police chief Soumya Mishra.

 On Tuesday, Mishra handed Laxmikanthamma a cheque for Rs 40,000 and declared the police had adopted the child.

 The grandmother then issued an appeal: The Maoists should lay down their arms and join the mainstream for the good of their families, which have been in dire straits for decades.

 Warangal police have also opened a childrens police station called Bala Maithri to counter Maoist propaganda among the young and to bring the guerrillas children under the polices wings.

 The CPI (Maoist) has announced the appointment of a central committee member, identified by the alias Praveen, as its new state secretary. 

 The police had killed the rebels earlier state chief, Madhav, in July before gunning down his designated successor Obleshu last week.

 The outfit said even its dalam commanders would not be told who Praveen really is.

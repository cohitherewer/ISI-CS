 Violence in Assam poll

 April 10: Violence in parts of volatile Karbi Anglong and minority-dominated Dhubri today marred the second and final phase of polling in Assam, which also saw a marginally lower turnout than in the first phase of elections on April 3, reports our bureau.

 A CRPF constable was kidnapped from a polling booth and three other security personnel were critically wounded in separate incidents in Karbi Anglong. 

 The other troublespot was Mancachar in Dhubri. Repolling was ordered in two polling stations following a fracas over alleged unavailability of special facilities for blind voters, which the Election Commission had promised in the wake of similar complaints during the first phase.

 In Golakgunj constituency, in the same district, security personnel fired three rounds in the air to disperse rival political activists who had clashed in front of a polling station around 1.30 pm.

 Chug to Pak by Thar Express

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 6: Come February, Pakistans Hyderabad will only be a train ride away from Jodhpur.

 Delhi and Islamabad today waved the green flag for re-opening the rail link between Munabao and Khokrapar, which was snapped during the 1965 war.

 The Thar Express will run between Munabao station on the Indian side and a newly-constructed Zero Point station in Pakistan. Munabao is 2.5 km from the international border and Zero Point barely a few metres away. 

 From Zero Point, the train will chug 8 km to Khokrapar. The railways of the two countries have made arrangements to run link trains between Khokrapar and Hyderabad and Munabao and Jodhpur.

 Pakistans customs and immigration formalities will be carried out at Zero Point and Indias at Munabao.

 The two-day talks between Indian and Pakistani rail officials have removed all hurdles the train link had been facing.

 The final agreement on starting operations on the track will be signed in Pakistan by the end of this month. 

 The train will initially run once a week but its frequency can be increased depending on the traffic. 

 For the first six months, the train will start from Pakistan and the rest of the year from India. Fares will be decided by the end of this month, said Ashok Gupta, who led the Indian delegation. 

 The head of the Pakistani team, Saleem-Ur Rahman Akhoond, said the 145-km track between Hyderabad and Khokrapar was converted to broad gauge in a record eight months. Such exercises normally take more than 18 months. But India had completed work on the track at Munabao railway station in no time and Pakistan reciprocated the gesture. 

 The officials said the three-year agreement could be renewed.

 - Scientists find Bharatnatyam helps nervous system

 Right Step to fight nervous Problems

 Chennai, Oct. 8: They have 

 enthralled audiences for centuries, twisting their limbs 

 into exquisite poses and manoeuvring their eyeballs and 

 face muscles to express every nuance of emotion.

 Now, Bharatnatyam dancers are giving scientists a lesson in how their blend of balance, motion and posture can hold the key to the prevention and treatment of a range of nervous disorders.

 An Indo-British team of neurologists doing a comparative study of ballet and Bharatnatyam dancers believes that the Indian dance form may enhance normal autonomic function, in other words, bodily equilibrium.

 The bodys nervous system has three parts the central (brain and spinal cord), peripheral (such as the nerves in the arms and legs) and autonomic nervous systems.

 Any failure of the autonomic system can lead to symptoms such as giddiness on standing up, profuse sweating, palpitations, chest pain and breathlessness, said Dr E.S. Krishnamoorthy, head of the Indian arm of the research team. These symptoms are usually accompanied with changes in blood pressure and heart rate.

 The scientists have found that Bharatnatyam helps maintain the autonomic system better than ballet does.

 Both ballet and Bharatnatyam dancers have hyper-extensive (allowing extra bending or rotation) joints, enabling them to perform the sublime movements that are a hallmark of their art.

 As the artistes performed the hastas and mudras, their increased joint range of motion was evident, said Krishnamoorthy, a neurologist and neuropsychiatrist with the Institute of Neurological Sciences at Chennais Voluntary Health Services Medical Centre.

 The two kind of dancers had another thing in common. We found that like ballet dancers, Bharatnatyam dancers are prone to depression and anxiety, and need constant reassurance and care, Krishnamoorthy said.

 Yet, there was one important difference. Unlike ballet dancers, Bharatnatyam artistes did not have disturbances of autonomic (nervous) function.

 The researchers plan to explore whether its the training Bharatnatyam dancers receive, as described in Bharatas Natya Shastra, that imparts certain memories in the human brain that prevents autonomic disorders.

 If so, this would mean that better autonomous function can be learned, and ailments like Parkinsons disease staved off in later life.

 Krishnamoorthy said the findings are preliminary. The next step involves a comparison between Bharatnatyam dancers and practitioners of a range of other dance forms.

 Krishnamoorthy said the researchers had collected their data on ballet dancers from already published studies in the West. They then spent six months observing 45 Bharatnatyam artistes from Chennais dance schools, studying the movement of their eyes, eyelids, chin and nose muscles.

 We looked at whether they had hyper-extensive joints, their autonomous functions like whether they maintained normal blood pressure, and whether they were prone to psychological distress and anxiety.

 The findings were revealed at a symposium in Chennai recently. The British side of the research is represented by the Indian-born neurologist, Christopher J. Mathias, professor of clinical neurology at the Imperial College School of Medicine and University College, London.

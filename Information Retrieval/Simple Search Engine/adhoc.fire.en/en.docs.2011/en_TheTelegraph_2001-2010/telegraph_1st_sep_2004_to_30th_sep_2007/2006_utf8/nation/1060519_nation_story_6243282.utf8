The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 PM breathes easy as polls scupper plot

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Singh: Time to smile

 New Delhi, May 18: On the second anniversary of the day Sonia Gandhis sacrifice handed him the Prime Ministers chair, Manmohan Singh could well be sighing in relief at having survived the latest efforts from within to make it wobble.

 Party sources said the recent Assembly poll results, particularly the Congress victory in Assam, came as a huge relief for the Prime Minister.

 Although Manmohan enjoys Sonias full backing, it is believed that a group of senior ministers and other Congress leaders had worked out a plan to corner him on the strength of pre-poll surveys and intelligence bureau reports. But the results caught them by surprise.

 According to the plan, some ministers were not only to step up the quota heat on Singh, they were also to question the Indo-US nuclear deal saying it had cost the party heavily in Muslim votes.

 In private conversation, a minister had even claimed that Delhis stand on Irans nuclear programme was a bigger mistake than the 1992 Ayodhya demolition (which the then Congress Prime Minister, P.V. Narasimha Rao, was accused of letting happen).

 Thus, Ajit Jogis call for Sonia to lead the nation and K. Natwar Singhs public criticism of the Indo-US deal fell into a pattern with M.L. Fotedars allegation that Manmohan had backed Rao at a cabinet meeting soon after the Babri demolition.

 Yet another minister is believed to have leaked a letter by Sonia to Manmohan seeking clarifications on the Free Trade Agreement and protection for Indian farmers. 

 Another minister ordered wheat imports although Manmohan had publicly ruled out the possibility.

 To his credit, the economist-politician stayed calm. And by May 11, when the results began pouring in, he could have afforded a smile.

 The Muslim majority districts of Assam, Bengal and Kerala had not rejected the Congress, refuting the theory that Iran and the Indo-US deal had antagonised the community.

 A senior Congress functionary said the anti-Manmohan leaders had difficulty stomaching the Assam verdict. Even after the results, a Union minister kept questioning the wisdom of forming a government with Bodo support, saying it could lead to problems. But Sonia vetoed him.

 Congress insiders, however, say Manmohan cannot afford to lower his guard. The elections in Uttar Pradesh, Uttaranchal and Punjab, slated for February 2007, would be another test for him.

 As Manmohan sits uneasy in his chair, his predecessor seems to have forgotten that he has lost his.

 On Monday, as he spoke on the recent killings in Jammu and Kashmir, former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee took care to describe how security forces were being mobilised. He then added that the Opposition should offer constructive criticism.

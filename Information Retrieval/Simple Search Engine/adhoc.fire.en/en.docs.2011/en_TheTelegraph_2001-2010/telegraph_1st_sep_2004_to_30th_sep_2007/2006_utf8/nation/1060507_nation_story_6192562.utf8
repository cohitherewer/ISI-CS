 Ganging up ? 

 Mumbai, May 6: Salem and Salman may gang up again.

 Another film on the don is in the making and Salman Khan ? he starred in the gangsters proxy production Chori Chori Chupke Chupke not so long ago ? is tentatively playing the lead.

 The film will be made by N.C. Chandra, the maker of critically-acclaimed movies like Ankush and Kagaar. He is a close friend of Salems lawyer Ashok Sarogi and has visited Arthur Road Jail where the gangster is lodged.

 Only, this film will not be inspired by the Abu Salem story, it will be the Abu Salem story, Chandra said, possibly referring to Mahesh Bhatts Gangster that is reportedly inspired by Salems affair with Monica Bedi.

 Salem was extradited from Portugal last November for a host of criminal cases, the prime being his role in the Bombay serial blasts which left over 250 dead.

 I have not met Salem yet. But I am doing a bit of research, said Chandra. The film will be produced by Sarogis wife Sarla.

 Salem is believed to be aware of the project. Is that why he sent Bhatt a legal notice before the release of Gangster?

 I would not be able to comment on that. You have to speak to him. Gangster has nothing to do with why I am making the film. The point is that like Hollywood, there is a market and expertise for reality cinema here, Chandra said.

 Sarogi said Chandra was an old family friend and had loved the idea of making a Salem film. We wanted someone who has handled reality cinema. We approached him and narrated what we wanted. He agreed.

 But Sarogi would not let on details about the films budget, claiming they were yet to be worked out. Asked if Salem had a financial role in the movie, he said: Its my money.

 The target is to get the film on the floors by the end of June. We are working on the script at present, Chandra said.

 Although Salman has yet to commit himself, the filmmakers have been sounding his old friend Shilpa Shetty about playing one of the female leads in the movie. The other lead may go to Aishwarya Rai lookalike Sneha Ullal.

 Mumbai police said they knew about the film but were not sure how it would be funded. Salems businesses are flagging. It looks like a desperate attempt to make some money out of his life story. We are keeping close watch, said DCP (crime) Dhananjay Kamlakar.

 Although the Mumbai underworld had a major role in funding films till the early nineties, its clout is believed to have diminished since.

 But its a cat and mouse game and there are attempts to revive influence. As of now, the underworld is not a player in Bollywood, Kamlakar said.

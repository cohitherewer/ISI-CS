 French peep into shipyard

 BASANT RAWAT

 Ahmedabad, Jan. 14: A French diplomatic team has visited the ship-breaking yard at Alang and held discussions with top officials on the yards preparedness for dismantling the decommissioned warship Clemenceau.

 The Gujarat government is believed to be helping the French team build a case for allowing in the ship, which is sailing towards Alang with 500 tonnes of hazardous asbestos, to be allowed to dock.

 Following protests from Greenpeace activists, a Supreme Court monitoring committee had recommended that the French warship should not be allowed to enter India.

 The committee will hear on January 20 the French and Gujarat governments arguments, after which the apex court is likely to decide whether the ship can be dismantled at Alang.

 Gujarat Maritime Board chief executive officer H.K. Das said the French team had come yesterday to have a look at the ground activities, facilities and infrastructure at the yard. The team included councillor Stephen Catta and deputy trade commissioner Fredric Rossi from the French mission in Mumbai and the naval attach? of the French embassy in Delhi, Commander Pierre Delbrel.

 Based on its report, the French ambassador in Delhi is likely to inform the apex court committee about the suitability of the ship-breaking yard for dismantling the vessel without creating an environmental hazard.

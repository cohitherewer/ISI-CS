 Bachchan bill hits governor wall

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, March 15: Mulayam Singh Yadav might be moving heaven, earth and a bill to prevent the disqualification of Rajya Sabha MPs Amar Singh and Jaya Bachchan, but governor T.V. Rajeswar seems hell-bent on playing spoilsport.

 The Uttar Pradesh governor has refused to give his immediate approval to the UP State Legislature (Prevention of Disqualification) Act, 1971, amendment bill, which would put some departments outside the purview of offices of profit, and has asked for some clarifications.

 The Election Commission had recommended the disqualification of Samajwadi Party leaders Jaya, the chairperson of the Uttar Pradesh Film Development Council, and Amar, who heads the state development council, for holding offices of profit.

 The bill, which the Assembly passed on March 9 to exempt heads of corporation, boards and councils from posts of profit, was sent to Raj Bhavan the next day along with four others for approval.

 While Rajeswar cleared the four bills without batting an eyelid, he decided to seek the opinion of legal experts after receiving the amendment bill. The governor was reportedly told that the bill bares the Samajwadi Party governments desperation to protect its members.

 Raj Bhavan sources said the governor was in no hurry to take a decision as the issue of Jaya and Amars disqualification is pending with the office of the President.

 Rajeswars decision to sit on the bill has added another thorn to his relations with the state government. It was supposed to be implemented with retrospective effect from January 1, 2003.

 Other MPs holding offices of profit include Shivpal Singh Yadav (chairperson of Mandi Parishad), Anuradha Choudhury (chairperson of Uttar Pradesh Irrigation and Flood Control Commission) and Azam Khan (chairperson of Uttar Pradesh Jal Nigam).

 The bill had Opposition parties in the Assembly crying foul and they branded it unconstitutional and undemocratic.

 Mulayam Singh, however, had said: I have always been against any draconian law in the country and had even campaigned for open ballot in the Rajya Sabha polls. I am moving this amendment to give more freedom to the legislators and members of Parliament.

 The timing of the bill ? it came a few days after the Election Commission turned the heat on Jaya and Amar ? raised his rivals hackles. 

 The government has proposed that the term daily allowances be changed to honorarium so that MPs can financially benefit from more than one office without attracting the provisions of disqualification in the act.

 PC to make Vedanta pay

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chidambaram

New Delhi, Dec. 5: P. Chidambaram told the Lok Sabha today the government is determined to recover a Rs 199-crore penalty that was slapped by the central excise and customs department on the Vedanta group, where he was a director before he became finance minister.

 Samajwadi Party member Mohan Singh said the government was not recovering the amount because of Chidambarams past association. 

 I am not making accusations. The minister should clarify because the government is getting a bad name. People are mentioning his name in a fraud of Rs 199 crore, said Singh.

 I am glad this matter was raised in my presence. No favour is being shown to anyone, Chidambaram said. After the fine was slapped, the company went to court, which upheld the customs order, he said. The company then obtained a stay from Bombay High Court. 

 He said the high courts Aurangabad bench does not have a revenue court, which has led to a delay in collecting the fine.

 But the chief justice of the high court has directed that an application be made to the administrative side for early disposal of the case. We will contest the case strongly and recover the money, the minister said, adding he, too, had heard of accusations (of favouring Vedanta).

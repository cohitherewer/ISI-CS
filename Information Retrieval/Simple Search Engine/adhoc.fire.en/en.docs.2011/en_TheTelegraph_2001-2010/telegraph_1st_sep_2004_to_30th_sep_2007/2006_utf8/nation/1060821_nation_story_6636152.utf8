 Indian cash gets Hollywood role

 Will Smith, Chris 

 Rock: UTVs stars 

 Calcutta, Aug. 20: Before 

 our stars can make it big in Hollywood, our money will.

 UTV Motion Pictures, which produced Swades and Rang De Basanti, is now co-producing three Hollywood films two with actor Will Smiths production company Overbrook Entertainment and one with Fox Searchlight, a 100 per cent subsidiary of 20th Century Fox. 

 Announcing this in New York on Saturday night, UTV CEO Ronnie Screwvala said his company is investing $37 million in the three films. UTV is focused on collaborating with like-minded partners like Fox, Sony and Will Smith to produce entertainment for global audiences, Screwvala said.

 Last year, UTV had teamed up with Fox Searchlight for Mira Nairs screen adaptation of Jhumpa Lahiris The Namesake. But with an Indian director and a largely Indian cast (Tabu and Irrfan), it was more of an Indian project. 

 The new co-production will be an out-and-out Hollywood film, called I Think I Love My Wife, starring Chris Rock (Beverly Hills Cop 2, Lethal Weapon 4).

 Most of the shooting for the comedy, about a married man who daydreams of being with other women, has been completed in New York. It is expected to be released on February 9, 2007, a month before The Namesake.

 The other UTV deal, with Will Smith, was worked out when the actor came down to India in February to launch Sonys English movie channel PIX. 

 The two-film, $30-million co-production agreement also involves Sony Pictures Entertainment, which has a first-look deal for the projects and will distribute the films worldwide. One will be an action film, starring Smith in the lead role, valued at $10 million. The other will be a CG-animated motion picture with the Men in Black star lending his voice to one of the main characters.

 While UTV is the co-producer and its representatives will be on the sets, the projects will be made entirely by a Hollywood production crew.

 For us, these projects are a big step in reaching key North American markets and expanding our presence globally, Screwvala said. We will continue to lead the way.

 The company will carry on producing Indian films, such as Ashutosh Gowarikers Jodha Akbar starring Hrithik Roshan and Aishwarya Rai. 

 Apart from UTV, Manmohan Shettys Adlabs Films has also tied up with Ashok Amritrajs Hyde Park Entertainment Group for a multi-million-dollar co-producing, financing deal. But they have not announced any film yet. 

 Adlabs had earlier tied up with Hyperion Pictures for Willard Carolls Marigold, but it was always more of a Bollywood project with Salman Khan in the lead, the music by Shankar Ehsaan Loy and India as the backdrop.

 Konark tide kills tourists

 - Tragedy near temple

 The Konark temple

 Bhubaneswar, Aug. 21: Four women strolling on a beach in Konark were swept into the sea during high tide this morning.

 They were tourists from Andhra Pradesh. Two others who were also on Chandrabhaga beach near the Sun Temple, including a seven-year-old, are missing.

 Police said the women, a part of a group of 48, from Andhras East Godavari district arrived in Konark from Bhubaneswar last night. They were to round off their trip with a visit to Puri today.

 The group had gone to the beach at dawn to catch the sunrise, when giant waves lashed the shore. The tourists began to run frantically, but Tarri Ankaiya Amma, 70, Tarri Kanta Amma, 38, K. Mahalaxmi, 38, and Thunduri Muga, 38, could not get away. Their bodies were washed ashore a few hours later.

 Tudi Laxmi, 28, and Thunduri Venkatesh, 7, are also believed to have been swept away, but their bodies havent been found yet.

 The high tide came all of a sudden and the tourists were not prepared. Their saris also prevented them from running fast, said Konark additional tehsildar Pramod Mishra.

 The bodies have been sent for post-mortem and will be handed over to families of the victims.

 Relatives of the dead women said there was no signboard on the beach warning them about the high tide.

 Although the water near Chandrabhaga beach is shallow, the flash tides come up to several feet, swallowing everything in sight. This is fairly common in Chandrabhaga, Mishra said.

 Before todays incident, the sea here had claimed four tourists this year.

 The toll in the neighbouring Puri beach, however, is generally much higher. Every year, about 40 lives are lost in the treacherous currents here.

 Tourists have been complaining about the lack of patrol boats and a first-aid centre on the beach.

 The fire office in Puri, too, is ill-equipped to carry out rescue operations, sources said.

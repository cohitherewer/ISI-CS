 Aircraft-buster ammo kills kids

 Anti-aircraft ammo

 Bangalore, May 12: Two children playing with a 23 mm live cartridge, normally fired from air defence artillery guns, were killed when it blew up after one of them hit it with a hammer this morning.

 The mishap happened aro-und 8.45 am when Prashanth, 14, and Susay, 4, children of army personnel, were playing in the verandah inside the sprawling Madras Engineering Group and Centre.

 Apparently, Prashanth was busy banging the six-inch long cylindrical metal object with a hammer while a curious Susay squatted next to him watching.

 The army top brass are trying to ascertain how the children could have laid their hands on the live cartridge. There are conjectures that as their residential quarters shared the boundary with the Army Air Defence unit, they could have scaled the wall and returned after finding the cartridge, which was of Indian ordnance factory make.

 When neighbours rushed out at the sound of a deafening blast, they saw body parts and blood splattered all over the walls. The one-bedroom family accommodation in front of which the children were playing was also extensively damaged.

 Prashanths father Subedar Naik Imbinathan has just retired from the Madras Engineering Group. He was aghast to see his son and his neighbour Havildar Pandians son, Susay, blown up. Pandian is serving in Jammu and Kashmir.

 Senior army officials confirmed that the cause of the deaths was the 23 mm cartridge used by Army Air Defence units. These units are stationed within military cantonments in all cities, and in Bangalore, they are at the Madras Engineering Group and Centre. Their mandate is to shoot down unidentified flying objects that threaten or try to fly over vital installations and prohibited areas.

 These units are used where air force units cannot be scrambled for interception. Apart from sensitive military areas, they are stationed near refineries, important buildings like Parliament and the Prime Ministers residence, a source said.

 The Army Air Defence units use high-calibre light artillery guns either mounted on tank chassis (called Shilka) or are towed to locations. They use the highly accurate 23 mm cartridges.

 Normally, every 23 mm cartridge is accounted for by the unit. The ammunition is normally kept locked up or loaded on the guns. None of our guys have reported a cartridge missing so far, an officer said.

 An inquiry is on as to how the children could have got the cartridge.

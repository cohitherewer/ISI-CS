 Pak prod to continue talks 

 IMTIAZ GUL

 Musharraf

 Islamabad, July 17: Disappointed over Indias decision to postpone the peace talks, Pakistan today underscored the need for carrying forward the process for resolution of all outstanding disputes.

 In no way would I underestimate the value and importance of peace process, foreign secretary Riaz Muhammad Khan said.

 He told mediapersons that New Delhi has already conveyed its decision, which had halted the peace process.

 What India needs to do is to agree on dates of meetings for the third round of talks, he said and added there was no reason for despondency.

 Rejecting Indias allegations linking Pakistan to last weeks terror attacks in Mumbai, he said there ought to be no linkage between acts of terror and the peace process.

 Even a joint statement, which was issued after a meeting between President General Pervez Musharraf and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on April 18, 2005, declared that any act of terror should not be allowed to impede the peace process, Khan said.

 He recalled that the joint declaration had also described the peace process as irreversible.

 New Delhis decision to postpone talks with Islamabad came after Singh found links between the Mumbai blasts and the elements supported across the border.

 I am disappointed by the Indian decision, said Khan, who was to leave for New Delhi for talks with his counterpart Shyam Saran to work out details about the third round of the composite dialogue.

 He said this (postponement) was a negative development, adding that it has interrupted the ongoing peace process, which not only improved the level of relations but also gave a boost to confidence-building and increased interactions between the two countries.

 The two countries had resumed the peace talks in February 2004 after a landmark meeting between Musharraf and the then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee.

 Stocks hit

 Pakistans benchmark stock index fell over 79 points due to concern over Indias decision to postpone this weeks talks with its neighbour which may mar the peace process and the economy.

 The Karachi stock exchange index lost 79.26 points, or 0.8 per cent, at 9,947.83 points as banking, oil processing and telcommunication stocks fell sharply. Investor sentiment was also dampened by a report by Pakistans central bank which stated expansion of the countrys $118-billion economy might slow down in the coming years, said an analyst.

 BSF zooms in on Bangla camps

 IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI

 Calcutta, Sept. 7: Tapping satellite power, the Border Security Force has drawn up a list of specific sites housing suspected terror camps in Bangladesh, a top official said.

 We have prepared a list of over 100 terrorist camps along with their specific locations in Bangladesh. The list and a map will be provided to officials of Bangladesh Rifles (BDR) at a meeting on September 18 in Calcutta, the official said.

 The perceived role of Bangladesh in harbouring militants from India will top the agenda of the meeting. A copy of the list has already been forwarded to the home ministry, the official added.

 Last year, we had given a list of over 100 such camps in Bangladesh but the BDR had denied it. Thats why we have located these camps with the help of satellite technology and drawn up a specific list. Now it will be very difficult for them to deny the existence of the camps, he said.

 The official, however, declined to say which satellite was used or when the tracking was carried out.

 The disclosure comes in the middle of a growing feeling in Bengal and Delhi that Bangladesh has slowly emerged as a safe haven for anti-India elements while the Centre was focusing attention on guarding the western and northern flanks.

 On Tuesday, Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had said in Delhi that training camps are now flourishing inside our neighbouring country. 

 Another senior BSF official said the map, along with the location of the camps, has been given to the chief minister last month.

 According to the official, most terror camps in Bangladesh belong to the Jaish-e-Mohammad, Lashkar-e-Toiba, Harkat-ul Mujahiddeen and al Qaida. Camps of groups like the Kamtapur Liberation Organisation (KLO) and Ulfa were also found. We have tracked down the location of some Ulfa leaders. They are based in Dhaka and are operating from there.

 The official said the camps are housed in secluded places in districts like Khulna, Maulavi Bazar and Rangamati (see map). After training, terrorists, including suicide attackers, are pushed into India, the official said.

 The BSF has requested Bhattacharjee to speed up land acquisition for border fencing. Out of the 1,145 km earmarked for fencing, only 504 km has been completed, he added.

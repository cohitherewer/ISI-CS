The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Deadline at door, cities cool to CAS 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 25: The court-mandated shift to CAS is just days away but there appears to be no mad scramble to rent or buy the set-top boxes needed for the switch.

 In select, already notified areas of Delhi, Calcutta and Mumbai Chennai already has the system CAS (conditional access system) will come into effect on December 31.

 Despite Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) advertisements in the media reminding viewers of the looming deadline, only around 50,000-60,000 of the four lakh cable television subscribers in Delhis CAS-notified areas have acquired set-top boxes. 

 The situation in other metros is not very different, according to industry sources here.

 But Roop Sharma, who heads the Cable Operators Federation of India, remains unfazed. Thats good, Sharma says. The numbers dont indicate that CAS has failed. 

 Sharma feels the absence of a rush to change might in the end lead to a better deal for all consumers: broadcasters would be forced to convert their pay channels into free-to-air if there are not enough people opting for the set-top box. Broadcasters need viewers, or the advertisers will back off.

 This is what happened in Chennai, Sharma says, referring to the example of broadcasters like Sun TV, which chose to turn their pay channels into free-to-air.

 Under CAS, households will be charged according to the number of channels they wish to subscribe to at Rs 5 a channel per mon th plus taxes.

 But thats for pay channels. If you want to watch just free-to-air channels, you dont need to get the set-top box. For the entire free-to-air bundle of 30 channels, you pay Rs 77 a month.

 Aware of this, multi-system operators or the MSOs the big operators who sell the channels to local cable operators have begun offering discounts on the Rs 5 per pay channel monthly rent. 

 Hathway has announced discounted pay channel bundles: Rs 120 for 30 pay channels. This is apart from the rent for the set-top box.

 There are also discounts for getting a CAS-enabled second connection in the same household.

 Consumers can also hope to benefit from the competition between cable operators who sell CAS and those who offer DTH or direct-to-home television through a small, individual satellite dish. Like CAS-enabled cable, DTH, too, needs a set-top box. The DTH providers, Dishtv and Tata Sky, hope that some of those who are now being forced to switch to CAS would rather opt for them.

 Already in some Delhi localities cable-operators have begun interacting with residents welfare association, urging them to stick to cable television even if they want to watch just free-to-air channels rather than go for DTH. A few have also slashed charges, even in areas where CAS wont be mandatory.

 Coping with low govt spending 

 New Delhi, Oct. 22: Having promised to spend 6 per cent of the national income on education in its common minimum programme, the government is now confronted with statistics that not only show it is nowhere near fulfilling the pledge, but also reveal that other sectors get more money.

 Investment in education dropped from 10.9 per cent of the total outlay in 1995-96 to 9.23 in 2004-05 both in the Union and state budgets.

 The Centre now spends the equivalent of 3 to 4 per cent of the GDP. Not only is this short, the increase in investment in education has not kept pace with that of other sectors.

 The allocations were raised in the UPA governments first year, but they were much less than those in other areas. Defence, for example, walks away with much more from the budget.

 An analysis of Union and state finances by the Aga Khan Education Foundation has shown that the share of education expenditure in the total budget was less than 15 per cent in all states.

 The study links its findings to Sarva Siksha Abhiyan, a key government programme for universalisation of primary education. The study brings out the gap between the required magnitude of additional financial resources for universalisation of elementary education and the actual additional spending from 1998-99 to 2005-06 at the national level, the foundation says.

 In the last eight years, that shortfall has been huge around Rs 87,687.3 crore. The situation will deteriorate in the absence of steps by the government to increase public spending. Persistent under-provisioning for elementary education in the past has resulted in a large cumulative gap, says the foundation.

 The study blames hitches in the flow of funds from the Centre to the states for the gap in investment. It also says some states have been unable to use funds on time.

 The major factors affecting the resource-absorption capacity of states have been traced to bottlenecks in the planning and budgetary processes that are being followed under Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, the report states.

 According to the foundation, funds to district authorities involved in education plans are not released in two instalments every year, but in several small parcels.

 Chargesheet torn up in court

 Srinagar, Aug. 5 (PTI): Sabeena, the alleged mastermind of the sex racket in Jammu and Kashmir, today tore a copy of the second chargesheet in a city court.

 How many chargesheets you want to give? she asked, tearing the copy as soon as the CBI handed it to her in the court of chief judicial magistrate M.Y. Akhoon.

 Sabeena was joined by her husband A. Hameed Bhulla but they were whisked away by police to the central jail. Bhulla alleged that they were being made scapegoats in the case.

 The second chargesheet was also handed over to some other accused, senior IAS officer M. Iqbal Khanday, hotel manager Riyaz Ahmad Kawa and deputy superintendent of police M. Yousuf Mir.

 Former ministers G.A. Mir and Raman Mattoo were given the copies yesterday when they were produced in court for extension of their judicial remand.

 The judge had also transferred the case along with their bail applications to principal sessions and district judge M. Yaqoob Mir, who is hearing the first chargesheet against the nine accused.

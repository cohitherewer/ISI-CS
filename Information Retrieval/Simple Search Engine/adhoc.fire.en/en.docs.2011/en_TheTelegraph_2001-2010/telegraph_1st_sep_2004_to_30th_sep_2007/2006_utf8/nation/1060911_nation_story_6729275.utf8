 Thane cache

 Mumbai, Sept. 10: Thane rural police today seized a large quantity of ammonium nitrate, gelatine sticks and detonators from a Bolero jeep near Shahpur along the Mumbai-Nashik highway, reports our special correspondent. 

 Police sources said 275 kg of gelatine, 1,450 detonators and 250 kg of ammonium nitrate were found in the vehicle in Tembha Pada village, 32 km from Shahpur.

 Police said the explosives were to be used for mining activities in the area and had no link with the Malegaon blasts.

 The two occupants of the jeep (MH15-BD4021) initially claimed they had licences for the materials. But they managed to escape, said inspector-general, Konkan Range, Satya Pal Singh.

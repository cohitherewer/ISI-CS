 Catch slips in the act amp; win

 - Fashion week malfunctions spawn mobile camera game

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Greg Chappell was the surprise front-row star on Day V at the Lakme Fashion Week in Mumbai as he sat through designer James Ferreiras show. 

Invited by organisers IMG, the Team India coach was accompanied by former cricketers Bob Willis and Damien Fleming. 

Chappell sat stoic and stern just like he did when his team was crashing out of the Champions Trophy. But at the end, he clapped loud and clear, probably having liked what he saw on the ramp better than what he has been seeing on the pitch of late.

 Mumbai, Nov. 4: Slip-catching is the new game in town but Indian cricket wont be gaining much.

 Gaming company Games2Win has launched 

 a new game titled Ms Malfunction (in picture below), 

 inspired by the outfit slip-ups at last years Lakme 

 Fashion Week and cashing in on the hype surrounding this 

 years ongoing event.

 What gamers have to do is use a mobile phone camera and, prompted by a blinking dot, capture wardrobe malfunctions as models sashay down the ramp. The more slips you capture, the more points you win, and the levels of difficulty increase.

 Alok Kejriwal, chairman of the Contests2win group and CEO of Games2win, said: We are constantly thinking of topical and Indian themes for inspiration, and the malfunctions that happen at fashion shows was an obvious idea. Given that the season of fashion is in, Ms Malfunction was a must-do for us.

 The multi-level game, branded a casual game and launched during the Lakme Fashion Week, recreates a fashion ramp with models walking down to foot-tapping music.

 The game was designed keeping the standard fashion show and ramp in mind. Our art and creative designers switched on some of the popular fashion channels for references, said Kejriwal, adding that the game was not heavy to load and would suit players who prefer simple games.

 Last years LFW was in the news more for two wardrobe malfunctions than for creativity. The first happened during a Beenu Sehgal show when model Carol Graciass outfit slipped and exposed her breasts. 

 The second mishap involved Gauhar Khan, whose skirt gave way to reveal her derriere.

 Although this weeks event has largely been free of such controversies, model Sucheta Sharma had a close shave. 

 During a show by Salman Khans designer sister-in-law Seema Khan, Sharmas dress slipped but she was saved from embarrassment by her silicone bra. The LFW has made it mandatory for models to wear safeguards as a precaution against such malfunctions.

 As far as the game goes, its manufacturers claim it has been a hot favourite. The game recorded 3,000-plus responses within hours of going live. Almost 80 per cent of the users are males in the 18-35 age category, but we are getting good response from women, too, Kejriwal said.

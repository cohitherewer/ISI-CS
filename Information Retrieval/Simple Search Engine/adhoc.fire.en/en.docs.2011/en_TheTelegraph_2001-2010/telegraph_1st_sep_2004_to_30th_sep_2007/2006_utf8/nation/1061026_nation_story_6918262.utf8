 Teesta bus crash kills 18

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Gangtok, Oct. 25: An overloaded bus carrying passengers returning from the Diwali break plunged into the Teesta this afternoon, killing at least 18. 

 Over 45 people were injured in the accident that occurred around 4 pm at Bageykhola, 40 km from here, on National Highway 31A. 

 The bus belonging to the state-run Sikkim Nationalised Transport was on its way from Jorethang in south Sikkim to Gangtok, a distance of 100 km. 

 The buses usually have a capacity of 40, but the vehicle was packed with local residents returning to Gangtok after the Diwali festivities. Administration sources said the number of dead could be more as many are feared to have been swept away by the river. 

 Eyewitnesses said the bus was giving way to another vehicle coming from the opposite direction near a sharp turn at Bageykhola, 60 km from Jorethang, when it hit the parapet and plunged 500 metres into the Teesta. 

 The bodies were fished out of the river with the help of local people. 

 Fourteen persons were declared brought dead at Singtam district hospital and one at Central Referral Hospital at 5th Mile in Tadong. Three died at Sir Thutob Namgyal Memorial Hospital here. 

 The driver of the bus, Mohan Kumar Sharma, is yet to be traced. He was not among the injured or the dead. 

 Since there was a shortage of ambulances, the injured were rushed to hospitals in taxis and other vehicles. Many of them are in critical condition with multiple injuries. 

 Kumar Subba, who had boarded the bus from Rangpo, said it was the carelessness of the driver that caused the accident. Subba said he remembers being thrown out of the vehicle after it hit the parapet. 

 Jitman Rai, too, remembers the bus hitting the parapet. I slipped through the window and held on to a tree and escaped with minor injuries, he said. 

 Health minister Hishey Lachungpa, roads and bridges minister D.T. Lepcha, home secretary Jasbir Singh and director-general of police C.M. Ravindran have visited the hospitals. East district collector R. Telang and senior police officials had gone to the accident site at Bageykhola to oversee rescue operations.

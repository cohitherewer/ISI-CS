 Law on uniform payment for land

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 New Delhi, Nov. 24: The government is drafting a law on national resettlement and rehabilitation to ensure that compensation for land acquisition is legally enforced and not left to the whims of the administration. 

 Sources privy to the draft said the rural development ministry is finalising the document for vetting by the law ministry. The government wants to table the law in the budget session.

 The rationale is, if land is acquired through a law (the Land Acquisition Act, 1894), displaced persons must also get their compensation through another law and not policy guidelines, a source said. 

 The law is based on the new national resettlement and rehabilitation policy of the current government that is intended to be an improvement on an earlier document. 

 The policy was sent to state governments for comments. After that, it was to be posted for public scrutiny before going to the cabinet and possibly to a group of ministers. 

 SEZ controversies have forced the Centre to address the problem of displacement not through a policy but a law. 

 The legislation will provide a uniform minimum standard for the states. It will cover all those who are displaced by projects such as the Narmada dam and SEZs.

 Under the national policy, a social impact assessment is suggested along with the mandatory environmental impact study for all projects displacing 400 or more families en masse in the plains or 200 or more families en masse in tribal or hilly areas.

 The assessment report will then be discussed at a public hearing and scrutinised by a multi-disciplinary expert group.

 Official sources ruled out land-for-land compensation, saying while the concept was realistic 30 or 40 years ago, it was fictitious today.

 The law is likely to have a provision to facilitate the purchase of land wherever the displaced person chooses. 

 After Sonia Gandhi suggested making landowners stakeholders in the projects that are put up on the acquired land, the envisaged law is expected to contain such a clause.

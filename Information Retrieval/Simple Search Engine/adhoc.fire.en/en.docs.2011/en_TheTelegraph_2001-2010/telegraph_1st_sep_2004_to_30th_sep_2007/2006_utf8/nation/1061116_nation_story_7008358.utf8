The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 B-school with 5000 in a bind

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 15: Delhis sealing drive moved from designer showrooms to education institutes, prompting many traders to accept the inevitable and begin moving out of illegal establishments.

 A management institute with 5,000 students and a newspaper office faced the brunt of the drive today near Qutub Minar.

 The Indian Institute of Planning and Management (IIPM) was the first to be sealed as hundreds of students watched, with books in hand.

 IIPM has applied for the premises to be temporarily de-sealed so that shifting can commence. But some students said they have not been told where the institute will be shifted to.

 We have been told not to worry, which is kind of difficult when our future is at stake, an MBA student said.

 Ten metres away, a student from Siliguri, almost in tears and hands folded, was asking a Bengali policeman: Ekhon ki (Now what)?

 Corporation officials a large police contingent in tow then moved to the newspaper office. But a days reprieve from the sealing was obtained, and journalists began moving their belongings into cars, preparing for tomorrow.

 Multinationals were not spared either. Amway, a direct-selling company, saw its sprawling complex sealed.

 In Laxmi Nagar in east Delhi, traders who till recently were engaged in street clashes with policemen appear to have reconciled to moving to a legal area.

 Trucks and vans on Vikas Marg were being loaded with wares temporarily being transferred to houses. Most closing shops are those who have found a legal plot somewhere else.

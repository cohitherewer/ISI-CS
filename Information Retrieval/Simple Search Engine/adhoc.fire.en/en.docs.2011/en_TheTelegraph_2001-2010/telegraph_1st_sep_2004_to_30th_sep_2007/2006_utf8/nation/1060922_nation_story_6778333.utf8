 Bullets on Israeli girl

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Sept. 21: The Sahar airport police today arrested a 23-year-old Israeli student found carrying 14 live bullets. 

 Identified as Noa Haviv, the girl had arrived from Tel Aviv this morning. 

 The bullets in Havivs luggage were detected during security check before she was to board a Jet Airways plane to Delhi, sources said. 

 The bullets had gone unnoticed during customs check at the international section, police said. Her luggage contained a magazine of a .32 pistol with 14 rounds. When we questioned her, she said the magazine belonged to her brother who lives in Israel, and it had accidentally got into her bag, additional commissioner (west) Bipin Behari said.

 With the help of the Israeli consulate, the police found her claim to be true. Havivs family faxed a copy of the pistols licence belonging to her brother. However, she was booked under the Indian Arms Act and will be produced in a local court tomorrow.

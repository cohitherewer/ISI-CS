 Plea on Shivani case diary

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 19: Police today moved the Supreme Court against a Delhi High Court order directing the prosecution in the Shivani Bhatnagar murder case to provide certain portions of the case diary to the main accused, IPS officer R.K. Sharma.

 The high court had directed the prosecution to supply copies of those portions where the police had recorded the statement of Shivanis husband Rakesh.

 In a special leave petition before the apex court, the police have contended that the defence did not have the right to get copies of the case diary.

 The diary could only be given to the court hearing the case if it called for the same, the police said.

 Sharma, inspector-general of police (prisons), Haryana, who is now under suspension, had sought the case diary on the ground that it was necessary for defending himself.

 Sharma is one of the six facing trial for the murder of the journalist who was found dead at her Delhi residence on January 23, 1999.

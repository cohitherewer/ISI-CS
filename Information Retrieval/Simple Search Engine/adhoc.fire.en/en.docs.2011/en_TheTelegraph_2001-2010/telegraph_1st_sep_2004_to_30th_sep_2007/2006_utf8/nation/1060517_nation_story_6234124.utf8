 Mumbai tug-of-war

 Mumbai, May 16: The game of one-upmanship between the states ruling coalition partners over the quota controversy went up a notch today with a Nationalist Congress Party minister organising a pro-reservation rally.

 As anti-quota protests raged across Mumbai, state public works minister Chhagan Bhujbal pushed an undecided Congress further into confusion about which side to support.

 Although it was the NCP that mooted the proposal to turn Maharashtra into the first Indian state to enforce reservation in professional colleges, protesters seem to be targeting the Congress.

 Bhujbal, a backward caste leader, organised a massive rally on Mumbais Azad Maidan this afternoon. His son Pankaj and nephew Sameer led the protesters who later broke police cordon and spilled over into the adjoining arterial roads to court arrest. Among them were over 400 members of the Mahatma Phule Samta Parishad, floated by Bhujbal, a former Shiv Sena leader.

 Although Bhujbal was expected to take part in the agitation, he did not. When my presence is needed, I will definitely be there to lead this battle for social justice. Today, they (anti-quota protesters) wanted students. We sent students, he told PTI.

 Bhujbal wouldnt hand the entire credit for organising the protest to his party. 

 He used the opportunity to prop himself up as the most influential OBC leader in the state.

 Well, there were some NCP members in todays rally, but the majority were my Parishad members. And what you saw today was just a small group of 5,000 people. I have organised bigger OBC rallies in Delhi and, if need be, there will be 5 lakh protesters here tomorrow, he said.

 Four other outfits also claimed credit for the rally, among them the Bahujan Vidyarthi Mahasangh affiliated to the Republican Party India (RPI), which claims to be a backward caste party.

 Yesterday, the RPI had staged a dharna on Azad Maidan under the leadership of the partys Mumbai unit president, Gautam Sonawane. 

 The Bahujan Samaj Party and many OBC organisations have decided to join the pro-reservation demonstrations.

 As both pro- and anti-quota groups stand firm, there are fears of possible clashes.

 Autopsy holes in student case

 Ranchi, Dec. 13: 

 A fresh controversy threatened to intensify the debate over 

 the circumstances in which engineering student Abhishek 

 Mishra died at the Dasham waterfalls last week.

 The post-mortem report, it was revealed today, indicated that Mishra had a full meal. The presence of faecal matter suggested that he had not relieved himself and that there was no sign of any stomach disorder either.

 The revelations fly in the face of the contention of his two surviving friends. While both had claimed that Abhishek had left them to relieve himself, one of them had said he had not eaten at all because of an upset stomach.

 Abhishek, who was a student of Birla Institute of Technology, Mesra, died last week while on a picnic at the waterfalls. 

 The autopsy report, however, ruled that the injury marks were caused by aquatic animals like fish.

 Sources said that while the report is definite about the cause of death being drowning, only a police investigation can establish whether the drowning itself was an accident, a suicide or a case of homicide.

 The claim of Abhisheks friend, Bharat Anand, that there was no mobile connectivity at Dasham has also aroused suspicion. 

 One of the images saved in Abhisheks laptop shows a friend speaking over a cellphone.

 Bharat has welcomed the demand for a probe and said it would set all doubts to rest. One of the survivors is Ragini, daughter of railway minister Lalu Prasad.

 Ranchi SSP N.P. Singh iterated that there was no fresh evidence to indicate foul play. 

 The officer said discrepancies in the friends versions could have arisen because they were unnerved by persistent questions from the media.

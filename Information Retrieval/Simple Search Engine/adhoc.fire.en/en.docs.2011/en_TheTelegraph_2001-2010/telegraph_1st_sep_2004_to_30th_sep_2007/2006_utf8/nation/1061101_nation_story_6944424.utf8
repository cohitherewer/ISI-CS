 Prices of 886 drugs set to fall

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Going cheaper

New Delhi, Oct. 31: The 

 Centre today released a list of 886 medicines whose prices 

 could fall by 0.2 per cent to 70.3 per cent as a result 

 of a long-planned reduction in margins the difference 

 between the manufacturing cost and selling price allowed 

 to wholesalers and retailers.

 Under new rules, wholesalers will be permitted a margin of 15 per cent and retailers 35 per cent, Union minister of chemicals and fertilisers Ram Vilas Paswan said. The guidelines are applicable to medicines manufactured on or after October 2. These may take about four to six weeks to reach retail counters, he added. 

 A wide range of anti-diabetic drugs, antibiotics, cough syrups and pain-killers could cost less. Some drugs used in surgery and for treatment of hypertension will also be cheaper. These include cetrizine, omeprazole and nimesulide.

 The new system of including local taxes in the maximum retail price (MRP) has already kicked in from October 2. 

 The National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority will, however, continue to fix the price of scheduled formulations without local taxes. Manufacturers will have to add local taxes to arrive at the MRP.

 Paswan said the government proposes to introduce a Drugs (Prices Regulation and Control) Act to ensure effective control on prices, production, distribution and supply of medicines.

 The list of 886 announced today is the first in a series of such price reductions and more drugs will be put on it later. 

 The move followed pharmaceutical companies acceptance of a government proposal to limit retail margins, fixed by distributors earlier. 

 They were given this authority as an incentive to promote a particular drug well.

 Paswan said he expected a reduction in the prices of anti-AIDS drugs as the state-owned Rajasthan Drugs and Pharmaceuticals and Hindustan Antibiotics were set to launch anti-retrovirals.

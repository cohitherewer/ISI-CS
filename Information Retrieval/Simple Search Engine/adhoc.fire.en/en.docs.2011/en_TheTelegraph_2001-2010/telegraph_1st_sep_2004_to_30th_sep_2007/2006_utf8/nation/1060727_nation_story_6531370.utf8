 Woman dies in Moscow mystery fall

 JOY SENGUPTA IN RANCHI AND OUR CALCUTTA BUREAU

 Ambika and Sajjan on their wedding day

 July 26: The call from Moscow last night did not bring the usual relief and happiness to Ambika Sharmas home on Ranchis Lake Road. 

 A man, identifying himself as Ambikas neighbour from Moscow, said she had fallen off the 10th floor of her apartment and died. He added that no one knew how the 32-year-old Ambika fell off the kitchen window. 

 As Ambikas parents frantically called up her in-laws in Calcutta, their worst fears were confirmed. Ambika had mysteriously died last night in Moscow where she had been living with her tea-exporter husband, Sajjan Sharma, and her twin children for the past two months. 

 Convinced that she had been murdered, Ambikas family today tried to lodge a case with the Kotwali police. 

 But the police refused to accept an FIR, saying the incident took place in Moscow and lodging a report would mean appointing an investigating officer. How is he going to investigate the case? We will contact the police in Calcutta where the mans family lives and look into the matter, said an official.

 Sajjan, 32, denied the allegation and said his wife had fallen accidentally.

 Describing it as complete injustice, Ambikas brother Basant Sharma said she had complained several times of being tortured by her in-laws for money and assets. 

 Basant said Sajjans family, which lives in Nagerbazar in north Calcutta, had refused to speak to them yesterday. We kept on calling but no one was ready to speak. When we threatened that we would go to the police, Sajjans mother took the call and said she had received information that some accident had occurred. The phone got disconnected after that, Basant said. 

 Ambikas sister-in-law Sushila Sharma said there is no one in Calcutta who can comment. I live here with my old mother and there is no one else from the family with us, she said. Everyone else stays in Moscow and we really do not know anything about the incident. We are as much in the dark as anyone else.

 Ambika, a BCom graduate, married Sajjan three years ago. 

 It was an arranged marriage and we gave everything we could. The problems started two months later. She used to call saying her in-laws misbehaved with her. They wanted a flat in Moscow and an imported car. That was beyond us but we used to provide them with cash from time to time, said Basant. 

 Ambikas husband said he was in a different room when the accident happened. She must have slipped and fallen. It is a crystal clear case and has nothing to do with murder, he said.

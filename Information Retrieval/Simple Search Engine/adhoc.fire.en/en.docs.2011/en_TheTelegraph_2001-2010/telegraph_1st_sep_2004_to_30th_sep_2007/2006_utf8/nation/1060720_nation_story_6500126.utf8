The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Business hears land wail

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, July 19: The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) has called for a comprehensive national policy to protect the interest of those displaced in the drive towards industrialisation.

 We need a well-planned and premeditated policy, CII president R. Seshasayee said, asked about the problems Bengal is facing in its effort to acquire land for industry.

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, whom the CII president met today, can, however, feel reassured as Seshasayee pointed out that it was not only Bengal that was facing the problem.

 It is a national issue. Many states are facing this challenge. We have to deal with this nationally as well, he said at an interactive session here with the media.

 The statement by the CII, which represents a sizeable chunk of Indian business, suggests that industry leaders are taking sympathetic note of the social unrest over acquisition of farmland.

 Seshasayee said land should not be procured irresponsibly. We have to be sensitive to the needs of the displaced people. It is important that skill development initiatives are taken with the displaced people, he said.

 But he also echoed what Bhattacharjee and Bengal industry minister Nirupam Sen have said: industrial progress cannot be hindered because of lack of land.

 The chief ministers meeting with the CII president and his team, which included eastern region chairman Bushen Raina and vice-chairman Biswadip Gupta, did not deal with land in particular.

 Seshasayee spelt out the chambers agenda of achieving 12 per cent industrial growth. Bhattacharjee, on the other hand, sought CII help on issues like formulating a national policy on iron ore and bringing in foreign direct investment in infrastructure sectors.

 Bhattacharjee also expressed interest in exploitation of deep mines in the state. Seshasayee said the CII could get in touch with companies from South Africa or Australia which have the required technology.

 The industry body has invited the chief minister to participate in its Made In India show in Beijing later this year.

 The fair, which would showcase Indian industry, is likely to take place in early September.

 Gupta said Bhattacharjee showed interest in visiting China and Japan.

 We requested him if he could dovetail his visit with the CII event, Gupta added. We are waiting for his response.

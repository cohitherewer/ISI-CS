 US visa shield

 New Delhi, Sept. 27 (PTI): In a bid to prevent misuse of its visa interview appointment system, the US embassy today announced changes in the process.

 If the applicant does not appear for the interview, the HDFC visa fee receipt (VFR) will be deactivated and the applicant will not be able to book another appointment, the US embassy said in a release.

 If the applicant has a valid reason for missing the interview, he can request the visa facilities services to reactivate his VFR, the release said. The applicant must go to the nearest US visa application centre in person to make the request.

 Other changes include deactivation of the VFR for 90 days in case of an applicant cancelling the visa interview appointment twice, it said.

 Mulayam sees topple plot

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, Nov. 15: Mulayam Singh Yadav today set up a fresh row with the Centre by alleging a conspiracy to dismiss his government before the state elections slated early next year.

 I have reports that the governor has recommended dismissal of the state government. But if my government is sacked, no party can run its democratically elected government elsewhere. The same pattern of removing the government should be followed there, too, the chief minister told a news conference.

 Mulayam said he had learnt about governor T.V. Rajeswars move from media reports and his own sources. The governor hasnt yet contradicted the media reports. 

 The Samajwadi Party chief minister has been making the allegation at political rallies for some weeks now, probably with the double objective of pre-empting such a move and whipping up a sympathy wave. He had dared the Centre to dismiss his government in an Assembly speech last week.

 An hour after his news conference today, Raj Bhavan issued a denial.

 A spokesman for the governors office said Rajeswar had not reacted earlier because Mulayams allegations had so far come at election rallies and had seemed to be just political rhetoric.

 Now that he is claiming he has confidential information, Raj Bhavan wants to clarify that there has been no recommendation for Presidents rule in Uttar Pradesh.

 Minister sends smoke green signal 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 For Historys sake: A still from the film Devdas

 New Delhi, Jan. 18: Teetotaller media minister Priya Rajan Das Munshi cannot imagine a lovelorn Devdas without the bottle and a Churchill without the cigar so he will tread a fine line on Bollywoods depiction of smoking in films.

 Das Munshi has to take a call on his health minister Anbumani Ramadosss request to ban smoking in films.

 I do not smoke and I do not drink and I am wholeheartedly with the anti-smoking campaign but there are historical characters who are sometimes shown on cinema smoking and drinking like Devdas and Churchill, Das Munshi said today in his first extensive briefing as Union information and broadcasting minister.

 What I am against is the glamorisation of smoking. I request all script and screenplay writers not to glamorise smoking and give youngsters the impression that it is good to smoke. 

 The minister has also made up his mind on who will sit in judgement on whether a film is glorifying smokers. I am shortly going to pack the censor board with the most glamorous people to decide what is glamorous and what is not.

 Das Munshi also made out a case for not imposing the ban. There are hundreds and thousands of workers in the bidi industry. In India, we must be practical. The cinema world also has many capable and knowledgeable people. I will urge them to ensure that smoking is not glamorised.

 The minister said his ministry was trying to formulate a code with the health ministry. I do not think a ban can be imposed from above.

 But Das Munshi favoured a pro-active role for censors to vet a film thoroughly as was done in the case of the Aamir Khan-starrer Rang De Basanti.

 I love watching cinema. I have not seen the film because I am not in the censor board. But let me tell you that if the censors think that they have to do a professional job of a film they will do so, he said. 

 The censors referred the film for vetting by the defence ministry and the animal welfare board with the full knowledge of the information and broadcasting ministry. They are acting strictly on our advice, Das Munshi said. 

 The Indian Air Force was unhappy with the way the film depicted its MiG 21 fighter aircraft (one of which crashed yesterday) and the defence establishment was also a little upset that the defence minister was shown as corrupt. The defence minister in the film is killed. 

 After the defence establishment cleared it, the animal welfare board objected to certain scenes. The films producers said yesterday that 20 seconds have been snipped off in deference to the wishes of the board.

 Babus put information out of reach

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Bhopal, March 21: The babus in Bhopal and Raipur have found a way to short-circuit the Right to Information act ? they are asking petitioners to cough up more than a lakh of rupees in photocopying charges.

 Ashok Chaurasia was told to pay Rs 147,102 when he sought some information at the government press at Hoshangabad, 60 km from Bhopal. The reply to his query ran into 73,551 pages. 

 State information officer T.N. Srivastava ? the man in charge of supervising implementation of the law in Madhya Pradesh ? said he is ascertaining the facts.

 In his petition, Chaurasia had sought information on 10 points on employees over-time slips and automatic folding machine. Government press representative A.K. Khanduri said the petitioner had sought records of the last 7-8 years. We got the copies made but as per the law, the petitioner has to pay for photocopying expenses, he said. 

 Chaurasia said he could not afford to pay so much. I am a poor man. If this is the case then how will a poor citizen ever get access to information? he asked. 

 Under the Right to Information act ? passed in October 2005 with the promise that it would bring transparency and accountability to governance ? any citizen can demand information from the government, including records, documents, memos, e-mails and orders. 

 In neighbouring Chhattisgarh, the situation is no better. In Raipur, Rakesh Shukla sought details of paddy procurement since the year 2000. 

 The reply ran into over 91,000 pages, costing Rs 182,000. In fact, there were so many documents that a room was allotted to keep the records. 

 Chief minister Raman Singh said he has written to the Centre, seeking guidance. He added that he cannot spare hundreds of government employees to gather information.

 The cost of photocopying a standard A-4 size page is Rs 2, according to the Right to Information Act, 2005. If the size of the document differs from the standard size, the local administration is expected to charge the prevailing rate.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Smart move by Dubai firm 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, June 22: The Dubai company behind the Smart City brand today came to Calcutta trying to sell the idea to Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.

 Senior officials from Dubai Internet City (DIC), which is part of the Dubai government, met the chief minister and made a presentation on their work.

 The DIC team has come to Bengal at a time Keralas new Left government has been dilly-dallying on a draft agreement between the company and the previous Congress-led ministry for a Smart City in Kochi.

 DIC has built the Dubai Internet City, the Dubai Media City, Knowledge Village and the rest of the kingdoms knowledge economy. For Bengal, it envisages a slew of industry clusters, such as a lifestyle park, a media city and a biotech park in addition to an internet city. A media city is a hub of media organisations with publishing, advertising, production and broadcast facilities.

 We will start an evaluation process on whether this concept can be brought to Calcutta. We hope to make progress. We have also invited the chief minister to visit and inspect our achievements in Dubai and the rest of the globe, said Deepak Padmanathan, chief strategy officer of the company.

 In some countries, weve built only an internet city, while in some others, we built an internet and media city. With the development of the knowledge industry, the internet city has found takers almost wherever we went. Weve worked in Malta and several north African countries, said Padmanathan.

 The Internet City in Dubai is an IT park built across 303 acres ? a free economic zone offering companies ownership, tax and customs benefits. 

 After meeting the chief minister, the team went around scouting for land in areas around the airport and New Town.

 In Kerala, chief minister V.S. Achuthanandan today told the Assembly he is not yet fully convinced that DIC is not just a real estate company.

 Achuthanandan, who was the chief campaigner against the free-trade IT corridor project when the Left was in Opposition, said his government was examining the draft agreement. If theres no clause that goes against Keralas interests, well think of further negotiations.

 Recently, asked about the possibility that Bengal might grab the Smart City project, Achuthanandan had said: Let them (DIC) go where they want.

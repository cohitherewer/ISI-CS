 Bail for Bidappa son 

 Bangalore, Oct. 21 (PTI): Adam Bidappa, son of fashion choreographer Prasad Bidappa, was today released on bail by a city court on furnishing a personal bond of Rs 20,000. 

 Adam also deposited Rs 1 lakh on a court order that he should deposit the amount if he wished to travel abroad. He has been asked to report to the police station on the 15th and 30th of every month.

 The court has posted the case for November 3. 

 An anticipatory bail petition for Bidappas wife Judith, against whom there is an arrest warrant for allegedly obstructing a public servant in the discharge of his duties, is likely to be filed on October 25. 

 Adam had allegedly abused policemen under the influence of alcohol at a bar on Thursday. Police had raided the bar as it was open at midnight in violation of excise and police rules. 

 Bidappa claimed that Judith, who had accompanied him to Ashok Nagar police station where Adam was taken, had accidentally hit a police officer who lost his balance and fell, fracturing his thumb.

 Succour for neighbours

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 9: India today offered to help its neighbours gain from its growing economic strength and said there was no danger of any South Asian country becoming a failed state anytime soon.

 Spelling out Delhis regional policy, foreign secretary Shyam Saran said India was working hard to make borders irrelevant by reaching out to neighbours.

 Delhi is also willing to shed the colonial hangover of treating its border regions as buffer areas, Saran said while speaking on Does India have a neighbourhood policy? at the Indian Council of World Affairs.

 We need to change this outpost mentality and treat border areas on a par with the hinterland.

 He added that though the region was volatile with many countries facing political instability, India didnt see any imminent danger of any of them becoming a failed state.

 Saran said India would have to interact with political parties in Pakistan. Delhi has been dealing with President Pervez Musharraf but Pakistan also has a strong political movement, he reasoned. And with Nepal undergoing a transformation, Delhi must put its weight behind the democratic forces.

 The foreign office has already taken steps to increase connectivity along the borders with Pakistan, Nepal, Bhutan, Myanmar and Bangladesh, the foreign secretary said.

 He spelt out some of the plans: Kargil-Skardu and Jammu-Sialkot bus services, a modernised checkpoint at Wagah to clear delays, upgrading key highways along the Nepal border.

 India also wants a trading point with China at Gumla and was exploring the possibility of a transit centre through Nepal to send goods to Tibet, Saran said. 

 The prospects are immense. The question is if there is political will to grasp this opportunity.

 Court gag on ship opinion fuels debate

 SINGH GYANANT KUMAR

 New Delhi, Feb. 14: The Supreme Courts bar on publishing opinion on whether the decommissioned French ship, Clemenceau, should be dismantled in India has sparked a debate in media and legal circles.

 A bench of Justices Arijit Passayat and S.H. Kapadia said yesterday: We are shocked to find (that) demonstrations are held and articles written and, if any one is found to be doing so, he should, prima facie, be held for contempt of court and suitable action be taken against him.

 Besides the media, the ban would also affect environmental groups like Greenpeace, which have protested against the entry of the 27,000-tonne ship to the Alang shipyard in Gujarat, saying the aircraft carrier contains hundreds of tonnes of toxic material.

 Senior counsel Rajiv Dhawan said initiation of proceedings would mean over extending the law of contempt. Courts should not ask anyone to remain quiet on matters already in the public domain, he added.

 Advocate Prashant Bhusan felt that such a restraint on freedom of expression would spell the end of democracy. The view that nobody could debate or express any opinion on a matter pending in a court of law is totally absurd, he said.

 The general secretary of the Editors Guild of India, Om Thanvi, pointed out that it was an undesirable restraint on the media. One could disagree with the opinion in an article but should never ban the expression of views, he added.

 Former attorney-general Soli J. Sorabjee, however, said none could comment on a matter pending before the court.

 Dhawan recalled that during the Narmada dam controversy also, the media was virtually asked to stay away from the case while it was pending before the court. But judges are unlikely to be influenced by articles and protests, he said.

 Technically, commenting on a pending matter amounts to contempt, but courts should not initiate such proceedings as it would, in reality, mean stifling public opinion, Bhusan said. Extensive discussions and demonstrations reopened the Bhopal gas leak case, he pointed out.

 He wondered how would one know about public opinion if the press is gagged. The government could then stifle criticism on any matter by filing a case, he added.

 The apex bench yesterday also expressed displeasure over the leak of the report of a monitoring committee appointed by the court on dismantling the ship. The committee had given a split opinion in favour of the dismantling.

 A new committee comprising experts from defence forces will now look into the matter. The court has asked the government to suggest by February 17 names of four or five retired personnel having experience in manufacturing and breaking ships.

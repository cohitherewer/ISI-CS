 Brother killed for resisting sister kidnap

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Behrampore, June 28: A 17-year-old boy was shot dead in a Murshidabad village last night when he lunged at one of the goons dragging away his sisters from home. 

 Shantigopal Pals sisters were saved. Hearing the gunshot, other residents of Chandpur rushed out and the gang dumped them while fleeing across a paddy field.

 A gang of six, some of whom had been trying to be intimate with Iti, 20, and Ambika, 14, for the past few days, broke open the Pals main door around midnight, about 210 km from Calcutta. 

 This wasnt the Pals first brush with molesters. Shantigopals 15-year-old sister Khuki committed suicide last year after being harassed by a group of young men. 

 The family did not lodge a police complaint fearing social humiliation.

 Last night, the sisters were sleeping together in one room. In another, Shantigopal was with his parents. They were woken up by the girls screams for help. 

 When the boy encountered the assailants, they were on their way out and his sisters were trying to latch onto the wooden frame of the broken door and anything else they could grip.

 Shantigopal shouted at them to free his sisters. Little Ambika, a Class VII student, could not put up much resistance and was dragged out into the open. Iti was still being pulled out of the room by a youth who had a gun aimed at Shantigopal. 

 He dived to grab him and was shot through his heart from point-blank range. Shantigopal was killed on the spot.

 A school dropout, he used to work in the fields. His father, Narendranath, is 70 and has eyesight problems.

 Iti was married to a Bengali in Uttar Pradesh four years ago. The mother of a child, she had come to her parents with her husband Ramcharan Pal, who works at a stone-crushing factory. Ramcharan left for his workplace two days ago.

 An officer of the local Naoda police station said that hearing the shot and the sisters cries, neighbours raised an alarm. By the time the villagers realised what had happened, the gang was dragging the sisters across a field. 

 As they fled, the kidnappers realised that the girls would slow them down. So they left them behind and disappeared in the darkness.

 Murshidabad superintendent of police Rahul Srivastav said: It was a planned attack. The miscreants headed straight for the sisters. 

 The villagers told the police that two of the goons belonged to Chandpur. 

 Ambika recognised them. They had been making lewd comments and indecent proposals at her on her way to and from school. They are very bad people. I never protested because I was scared they would harm my brother. Both of them raided our house last night, she said, shocked and still fear-stricken.

 The sisters lodged an FIR levelling charges of kidnapping and attempt to rape against the six.

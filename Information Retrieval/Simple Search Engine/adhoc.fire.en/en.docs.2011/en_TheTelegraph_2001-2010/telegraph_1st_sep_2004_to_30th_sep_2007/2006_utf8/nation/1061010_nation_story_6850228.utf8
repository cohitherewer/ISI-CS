 Buffalos turn to be obesity scapegoat

 - Livestock 

 count glare on milk

 Chennai, Oct. 9: The number of cows in India has been steadily falling and that of buffaloes has been rising, raising questions whether the high-fat buffalo milk has anything to do with the increase in obesity in the country.

 According to the latest National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO) survey on Land and Livestock Holdings conducted between January and December 2003 the number of milk-yielding cows for every 100 rural households has dropped from 34 in 1971-72 to 19 now. The number of milk-yielding buffaloes for every 100 rural households has mostly remained stable, dropping only marginally. 

 The total number of buffaloes in the country has increased to 80 million in 2002-03 from 73 million in 1991-92, while the cow population has reduced from 172 million in 1991-92 to 160 million in 2002-03. 

 The survey also says the countrys bovine population taken together cows and buffaloes indicates a gradual decline in milk-yielding animals for every 100 households in India. From 54 in the 1970s, this has come down to 36 for every 100 households. 

 Higher milk productivity has ensured that per capita availability of milk has increased despite this fall in population.

 But the gradual decline in the countrys milking stock is potentially a cause of concern, say researchers T.N. Datta and C.L. Dadhich, associated with the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB) in Gujarat. 

 The findings of the survey came up for scrutiny by administrators, academics and scholars at a two-day national seminar organised by the Union ministry of statistics and programme implementation in Chennai recently.

 One public health concern that came up at the meeting was whether more buffaloes meant more obesity among human beings. 

 R.C. Panda, secretary in the ministry, said an increase in the demand for buffalo milk also implied increased consumption of cream, ghee and other fatty substances that were its byproducts.

 In Gujarat, its only Amul

 Ahmedabad: A crucial board meeting of the Gujarat Co-operative Milk Marketing Federation on Tuesday unanimously agreed to adopt Amul as a common brand to sell their milk in the state. So far, member unions had been selling milk under their own brands.

 From October 1, Amul will be available throughout the state. The local brands with which it has had to fight for market share will be gradually withdrawn, it was decided.

 Mehsana dairy chairman Vipul Chaudhary, whose attempt to sell his entire produce under his dairys local brand name Dudhsagar is said to have prompted the only-Amul move by the federation, also changed his tune. The bitter critic of the single-brand decision said he was happy because the federation had addressed his concerns.

 Representatives of the Surat and Ahmedabad dairies, believed to be unhappy, did not attend the meeting.

 Mobile puzzle in Kalam hoax

 New Delhi (PTI): The phone call about 

 a bomb on President A.P.J. Abdul Kalams plane in Chennai 

 has baffled security agencies as it was made from a mobile 

 without a Sim card.

 Sources said the police control room at St Thomas Mount received the call at 10.38 pm on Monday. The caller said in Tamil that an explosive device had been planted on Kalams jet, which was to fly him to Delhi.

 Policemen saw the number 800 on the calling line identification system and guessed it could be a computer-generated call. But it was later found that the call had been made from a mobile without a Sim card as all cellphones have a facility to make emergency calls to the police and certain emergency numbers.

 Fall from train

 Mumbai (PTI): An engineering student 

 was injured after he fell off a running train, leading to 

 a protest in Navi Mumbai and disruption in rail services.

 Ajinkya Kulkarni, who fell off the train at Airoli, was admitted to hospital, where his condition was stated to be stable. Train services were restored by 12.55 pm, officials said.

 A-I flight relief

 New Delhi (PTI): After being stranded 

 for over two days at Delhi airport as an Air-India aircraft 

 could not be repaired, 290 passengers were flown to Frankfurt 

 and Los Angeles by a relief plane on Tuesday.

 Aborted foetus

 Udaipur (PTI): An aborted female embryo was found under a bridge, prompting the Rajasthan government to remove its chief medical and health officer and conduct searches at nursing homes. Three female foetuses were found floating in the Fateh Sagar lake here on August 2.

 Motorists in Dubai were forced to wait for a long time as roads were closed at regular intervals after a surge of admirers came to watch actress Aishwarya Rai shoot a commercial.

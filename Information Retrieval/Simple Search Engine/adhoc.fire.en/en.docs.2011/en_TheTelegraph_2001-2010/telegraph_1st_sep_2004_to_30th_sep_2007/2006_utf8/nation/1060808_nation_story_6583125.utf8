 Bravery debate over battle of Jhumra

 - Do the jawans who beat back Maoists deserve an award?

 The CRPF headquarters in New Delhi spent considerable time last month defining bravery. They also discussed if gallantry awards can be recommended for some of the jawans who repulsed a full-scale Maoist attack on the CRPF camp at the Jhumra hilltop overlooking the districts of Hazaribagh, Bokaro and Giridih.

 Gallantry awards, the majority argued, are given to people who show exemplary bravery while attacking or wresting enemy posts. At Jhumra, the men were just defending the camp and defenders, after all, do not require to be brave but merely need to be competent. 

 The argument in favour of giving awards was equally compelling. This was by far the fiercest attack launched on any CRPF camp anywhere, and that includes Kashmir, claimed CRPF commandants, tireless in praising their men.

 The camp itself, unlike other CRPF camps in Kashmir and the Northeast, was manned lightly and was not fortified adequately, the say. Even medium machine guns were not available and yet they managed to hold their nerve, fired judiciously, conserving their ammunition, and repulsed an overwhelmingly higher number.

 The field commanders are convinced that the Maoists retreated only because they suffered unexpectedly high casualty, including one or two of their top commanders. Not a single dead body has been recovered though, a factor cited by people arguing against gallantry awards.

 But the volume of blood found at different places, trails of blood and signs that bloodied bodies were dragged back into the forest led field commanders to claim that the rebels must have suffered at least three casualties. 

 We are now receiving information from arrested extremists that their casualty was as high as 18, say the commanders. If the figure can be verified, the Battle of Jhumra will undoubtedly be recorded as one of the most dramatic and brave battles fought by the central paramilitary forces, they say. 

 Even a month after the attack on June 25, bullets are still being retrieved from gunny bags in which flour is stored for the mess, recalls young Shiv Dayal Diwakar, a CRPF jawan at Jhumra hilltop. After the attack, the tents were in tatters and uniforms had dozens of bullet holes. Luckily, the men were in mufti, preparing to retire for the night.

 We have recovered over 2,500 empty cartridges from the camp and since barely 25 per cent of the cartridges are generally recovered, I reckon that they must have fired at least 10,000 rounds that night, says another jawan, Tej Bahadur Yadav.

 The routine patrol had returned to the camp around 8 pm and reported no unusual movement. The complacency at the camp was, however, shattered around 10 pm when an animal cry, magnified over loudspeakers and emanating from three different sides caught the jawans unawares.

 It was apparently the pre-determined signal for the attack as a hail of bullets began to rain on the camp. The initial burst killed a jawan who was standing out in the open, having just returned from sentry-duty. Others, in the tents or bunkers, dived for cover.

 When the firing stopped, says Nagendra Singh, I remember looking at my watch. It was 1.30 am and I thought I had just finished watching a thriller.

 Thanks to mobile phones, the base camp at the foothills and the battalion headquarters 140 km away learnt about the attack within minutes. But there was nothing they could do because there was no way reinforcement could reach the hilltop before daybreak. 

 The extremists declared over the loudspeaker that they wanted to regain control. This is our training camp and we will wrest it, they announced and offered the 100-odd jawans Rs 90 crore to desert the camp.

 This has been denied by the Communist Party of India (Maoists).

 In written statements, the banned organisation has claimed that the announcement has been distorted by security forces. 

 We had merely stated that we represent the aspirations of 90 crore people of this country, the statement had claimed.

 But CRPF jawans at Jhumra hilltop laughed the explanation away. They, in fact, repeated the offer several times, told us that if we wanted to remain alive till the next day, we should take the money and abandon the camp, claim several jawans. There were more intimate exchanges, too, recalls A.T. Rao.

 There must have been several extremists from Andhra Pradesh as instructions were also given in Telugu. Rao, himself from Andhra, shouted back a few abuses of his own in Telugu, prompting the extremist to ask him, in Telugu, about his home district. 

 The offer was also repeated in the language.

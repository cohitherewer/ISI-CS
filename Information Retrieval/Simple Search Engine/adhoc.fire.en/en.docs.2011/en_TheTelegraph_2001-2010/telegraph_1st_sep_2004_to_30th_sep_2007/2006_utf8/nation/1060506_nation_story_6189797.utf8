 was found hanging from a tree near Jumeirah beach in Dubai.

 The man, identified as Sheehan, 27, hailed from Kerala.

 The police are investigating the cause of death and did not rule out foul play.

 We do not have more information about the deceased. The body was identified by his brother and we have asked him to bring the passport of the deceased, the source added. Sheehans brother, when contacted by the paper, refused to comment on the death.

 Sheehan had recently joined Burj Al Arab hotel and worked in its housekeeping department.

 of telecom engineer K. Suryanarayana who was killed by the

 Manjula is battling for life in the ICU at the Asian Institute of Gastroenterology in the city. She had swallowed hydrochloric acid after another woman, Gogula Swapna Reddy, claimed she was Suryanarayanas second wife.

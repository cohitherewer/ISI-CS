 Parties keep govt guessing on profit law

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 26: The Centres initiative to sew up a consensus on the office-of-profit issue by the time the budget session resumes on May 10 is yet to evoke any response from political parties.

 While the BJP has held back its views, asking the Centre to first spell out its thinking on the proposed legislation, other non-UPA parties have decided to wait and watch.

 The government has, however, started the process of preparing the draft legislation, sources said.

 On April 3, the leader of the Lok Sabha and defence minister Pranab Mukherjee wrote to various parties seeking their views on whether they wanted amendments to the present law ? the Parliament (Prevention of Disqualification) Act of 1959 ? or a comprehensive new legislation. They were also asked whether the proposed law should be retrospective or prospective and whether the bill should be discussed and passed in this session itself.

 Sources said even three weeks after Mukherjee sent the letters, the government had not received any reply.

 The BJPs deputy leader in the Lok Sabha, V.K. Malhotra, said party leader Jaswant Singh had prepared a response to Mukherjees letter. Although Singh could not be contacted, it was learnt the BJP has decided to withhold its view till the Centre shares with political parties its thinking on the proposed legislation, planned to be introduced in the second half of the budget session from May 10.

 The Telugu Desam Party has agreed in principle on a legislation to resolve the issue but wants it to be prospective rather than retrospective. However, the party is yet to send its reply to Mukherjee.

 No matter whether it is an amendment to the existing act or a new comprehensive legislation, our partys opinion is that it should be prospective and not retrospective in effect, said Desam parliamentary party leader Yerran Naidu.

 The party would send its reply to Mukherjees letter only after its leaders have discussed the issue, he added.

 After the way the office of profit controversy flared up, the government was expecting the political parties to reply to Mukherjees letter in a week or two, sources said.

 The row erupted after Samajwadi Party leader Jaya Bachchan was stripped of her Rajya Sabha membership on the ground that she was holding an office of profit as chairperson of the Uttar Pradesh Film Development Council. 

 Amid charges that she, too, was holding offices of profit, Congress president Sonia Gandhi resigned from the Lok Sabha and from all government posts and is now seeking re-election from Rae Bareli.

 Teen shot dead for spurning militant

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Jammu, Feb. 25: Taslima Akhtar, 18, was gunned down in a remote Jammu village this morning for refusing to marry a militant.

 Taslima was shot dead from point blank range in front of all of us?. And we stood helpless, her father Mohammad Latif told the army. 

 She was the eldest of his six children ? three daughters and three sons. Their mother is hysterical with grief.

 Taslimas fianc?, a resident of Gursai village like her, was killed by militants last month. The village, in a forest area 230 km from Jammu, is in Poonch district.

 Col. D.K. Badola, spokesperson of 16 Corps, said: Taslima was engaged to one Tahir Mohammad of the same village last year, but terrorists killed him by slitting his throat on the pretext that he was an informer of the security forces.

 The militants, who had been hounding the girl for several months, pressured her again for marriage but her categorical refusal enraged them, the army quoted her father, a farm worker, as saying.

 Army jawans reached the spot about half an hour after the teenager was killed around 9.30 am. Three bullets were pumped into her, one in the head and two in the chest.

 Three militants, including the man who wanted to marry her, barged into the house and made the family line up before shooting Taslima dead. The family is terror-struck, the officer said.

 Police sources said 50 complaints have been received in the Jammu region over the past two years from parents of girls targeted by militants. The families are usually advised to move to a safer area. 

 Not all manage to get away on time. Parveena Bi, 20, from Lassana in Poonch, was killed in August 2004 after refusing a local Lashkar-e-Toiba militant. In January 2005, Afroza was killed in Bagla, Rajouri, when she spurned a militant.

 If they are not killed, the girls are married at gunpoint. Khatai Begum, 30, was one such. The Doda resident was forcibly married to a militant, but her husband died two years later. She has since been on her own, with a child.

 But sometimes a girl might get lucky, as Rubya Kauser did last year. The girl from a Rajouri village was abducted but escaped the next day.

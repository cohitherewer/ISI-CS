 Calcutta, Dec. 7: Dazzling Darjeeling, the scintillating Sunderbans and magical Murshidabad rubbing shoulders with Alpine Tirol, igloo hotels in Greenland or the wine trail in Bordeaux.

 For the first time, Bengals myriad tourist attractions will be showcased before a global audience, with Writers Buildings set to send a delegation to the International Tourismus Borse (ITB) in Berlin next year. Among the worlds top travel and trade fairs, ITB will be held from March 7-11.

 This is a wonderful opportunity for us to project Bengal as a tourism destination to the world market. We have decided to participate in the Berlin fair with a delegation representing all the stakeholders of the industry, state tourism secretary G.D. Gautama said today.

 A meeting of travel and hospitality trade representatives has been called on December 12 to discuss the nitty-gritty of the Berlin trip. Earlier this year, the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government had participated in two other trade fairs in Germany, the Hannover Messe and CeBIT, to carry the cause of Brand Bengal forward.

 For the first time in the four-decade history of ITB, India has been named a partner country, which is a huge shot in the arm for the tourism industry, said B.G. Roy, regional director of the Indo-German Chamber of Commerce, Calcutta, who met Gautama today.

 ITBs leading position as an international meeting place is underlined by the fact that more than three-quarters of its exhibitors and over 30 per cent of trade visitors are from outside Germany.

 Anil Punjabi, chairman (east), the Travel Agents Federation of India, welcomed the Bengal governments move to sit with travel trade representatives. Through an integrated approach involving all the stakeholders, we can raise the states share in Indias tourism pie, which is a sorry 2 per cent now, he said.

 Bengal has the unique selling proposition of mountains, beaches, tea-tourism, religion, wildlife a montage that has not been marketed professionally till now. ITB presents a unique platform for networking with the worlds leading tour operators, said Ranvir Bhandari, area manager (east) and general manager, ITC Sonar Bangla Sheraton amp; Towers.

 ITB offers an ideal opportunity for exhibitors to get their messages across to both trade visitors and the general public. The fair has different segments, including business travel, travel technology, books, cultural tourism, cruise lines and a travel centre for the young, besides adventure and eco tourism.

 Current trends and the impact of global tourism will be presented in a variety of events, customer presentations and news conferences. Responding to requests by exhibitors, three days from Wednesday to Friday will be reserved exclusively for trade visitors. This will give them a chance to hold meetings and conduct business in a relaxed atmosphere.

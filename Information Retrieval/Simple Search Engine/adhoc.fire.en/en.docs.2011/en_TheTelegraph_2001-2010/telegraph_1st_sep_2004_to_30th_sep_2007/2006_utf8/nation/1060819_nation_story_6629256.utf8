 Battle build-up in Uma seat

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Bhopal, Aug. 18: The BJP is planning to field Krishna Gaur, the controversial daughter-in-law of former chief minister Babulal Gaur, from Bada Malehra, the Assembly seat vacated by Uma Bharti.

 The partys Madhya Pradesh unit has sent Krishnas name to Delhi for approval. A homemaker, she became the head of Madhya Pradesh tourism while her father-in-law was the chief minister and earned the moniker of super chief minister.

 When Gaur was removed as chief minister, he agreed to become the states trade and industry minister. Taking a cue, Krishna, too, settled for a less lucrative post general secretary of the BJPs womens wing in the state.

 Uma has not spoken whether she would, contest from hometown Bada Malehra, a small municipality in Madhya Pradeshs Bundelkhand region. 

 The firebrand leader, who broke away from the BJP in November last year, has to take a pick between Bada Malehra and Vidisha the Lok Sabha seat vacated by current chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan. 

 A section of her Bharatiya Janshakti Party believes Vidisha will be the right choice because it will help Uma prove her claim that she alone was the architect of the BJPs spectacular victory in the 2003 Assembly and the 2004 Lok Sabha polls. 

 Uma is believed to be in two minds because a defeat there could dent her clout in the rest of the state. But those rooting for Vidisha believe the setting is right for her in the poll, tentatively scheduled for early October. 

 The BJPs Madhya Pradesh unit continues to be wary of the Uma factor. More important, the party is divided on finalising its nominee for Vidisha. An influential section comprising L.K. Advani, Venkaiah Naidu and Rajnath Singh wants Varun, Maneka Gandhis son, to make his political debut from this party bastion. 

 However, that plan has run into resistance from Chauhan, who is keen to field wife Sadhna. The names of party heavyweights Sushma Swaraj and Arun Jaitley are also doing the rounds.

 Another group of Uma supporters feels she should contest the Assembly polls from Bada Malehra. This section feels she will sail through easily, and that her presence in the Assembly will keep the ruling BJP on edge. 

 The Uma-BJP see-saw is also under the Congresss glare. 

 My take is that it will be Uma from the Vidisha Lok Sabha seat and Prahlad Patel from Bada Malehra, former chief minister and AICC general secretary Digvijay Singh said. Patel, a former Union minister, is an Uma associate.

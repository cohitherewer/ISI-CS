The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Dr MLA below poverty line

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, July 10: The 

 Congress legislature party leader in Bengal has demanded 

 that the governments list of below-poverty-line people 

 be scrapped because he features on it.

 Manas Bhuniya, MBBS, has been described in the document as a Class V dropout who earns a living as a daily wager. 

 After his protest during mention hour, Speaker Hashim Abdul Halim directed parliamentary affairs minister Sailen Sarkar to ask panchayat and rural development minister Surjya Kanta Mishra to find out how the name crept into the list. 

 Mishra would have to make a statement in the House giving his opinion on the matter. 

 I was stunned to see my name on the BPL list. It shows me as a daily wage labo- urer and a Class V dropout. One can imagine how the poor who really need the benefit are being deprived, Bhuniya told the House. 

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had wanted the list to be redrawn after many errors were detected in the first.

 Bhuniya said: The new list was hung up in panchayat and block development offices three days ago and it is again full of mistakes.

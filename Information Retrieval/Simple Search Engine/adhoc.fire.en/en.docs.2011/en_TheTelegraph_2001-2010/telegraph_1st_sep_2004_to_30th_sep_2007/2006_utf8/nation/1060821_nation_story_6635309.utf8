 Nagas snap Manipur oil line 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Imphal, Aug. 20: Manipur has lodged a complaint with the Union home ministry against the NSCN (Isak-Muivah) for allegedly trying to extort a huge amount of money from Indian Oil, forcing the company to shut down its retail outlets across the state.

 An official source said chief secretary Jarnail Singh called former Union home secretary K. Padmanabhaiah, who is now the government interlocutor in peace talks with the Naga group, and faxed a formal complaint to the home ministry yesterday. The government is likely to file another complaint with Lt Gen. (retd) R.V. Kulkarni, chairman of the ceasefire monitoring committee in Nagaland.

 Of all the militant groups active in Manipur, the NSCN (I-M) has been the biggest thorn in the governments side because it has been campaigning for the integration of Naga-inhabited areas of the region, including four hill districts of the state.

 The group, which has been engaged in a rough-and-tumble dialogue with Delhi for nine years, allegedly warned the Assam Oil Division of Indian Oil recently against doing business in Manipur until it paid the amount mentioned in an extortion notice.

 Sources said the notice was delivered to the Indian Oil office in Imphal about a fortnight ago. With no oil tanker coming to Imphal since then, fuel stocks have run out. The few petrol pumps that were open until yesterday put up out-of-stock boards this morning.

 Supply of petrol and diesel from Assam stopped a fortnight ago. Petrol reserves at the government-owned depot at Chingmeirong in Imphal will last 16 days. The diesel stock will probably last 19 days, a senior official said.

 Although oil transporters have not been directly threatened, tanker drivers fear that the Naga militant group will target them if they bring fuel to the state. 

 Food and civil supplies minister Thoudam Devendra Singh discussed the issue yesterday with the chief secretary and Indian Oil officials. A source said the oil major informed the state government of the NSCN (I-M)s alleged demand almost immediately after receiving the notice, but it was not until yesterday that Delhi came to know about it. 

 Devendra Singh said extortion by the NSCN (I-M) was in violation of the ground rules of its ceasefire with Delhi. He said the government team negotiating with the rebel groups leadership should raise the issue at the earliest.

 Tighter tenure rule for IAS

 S.P.S. PANNU 

 New Delhi, Dec. 5: The ministry of personnel has tightened rules to check the malaise of senior officers from elite services such as the IAS and IPS clinging on to plum deputation jobs even after their tenures have expired.

 Under new orders issued by the ministry on November 29, the terms and conditions of deputation will specify not only the period of deputation for the post but also the date of relieving, sources said. The officer will be considered to have reverted automatically to his parent cadre on this date. No further orders for relieving will be necessary, the order says.

 In the event of the officer overstaying for any reason whatsoever, he is liable to face disciplinary action and other adverse consequences. These include not counting the period of unauthorised overstay for the purpose of pension. Any increment due during this period shall be deferred, with cumulative effect, till the date the officer rejoins the parent cadre, the order says.

 The terms and conditions of deputation issued by various ministries or departments specify the period, but the ministry has come across a number of officers overstaying without the approval of the competent authority.

 The note says there should be no laxity on the part of controlling authorities in relieving an officer on deputation. It asks them not to go by the presumption that an officer can join his parent cadre only after being formally relieved.

 It will be the responsibility of immediate superior officers to ensure that the deputationist does not overstay. In cases where officers are already on deputation on the date of issue of the order and their normal tenures are getting over in six months, extensions of a month may be allowed on a case-to-case basis with the approval of the ministry of personnel, the order says.

 If organisations would like a relaxation in the new rules, the ministry of personnels approval must be secured prior to the start of deputation, the order says.

 The order covers officers of the all-India services, those joining central government posts on deputation from state governments as well as those on deputation to state governments, autonomous institutions and foreign bodies like the UN and the IMF.

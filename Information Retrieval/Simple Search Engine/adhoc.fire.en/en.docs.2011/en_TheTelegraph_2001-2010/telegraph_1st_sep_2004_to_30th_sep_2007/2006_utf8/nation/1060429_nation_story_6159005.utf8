 Jessica probe at forensic lab

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 28: The special investigation team of Delhi police that is probing a case of evidence tampering in the Jessica Lal murder will quiz six forensic experts from the Central Forensic Science Laboratory.

 While acquitting the nine accused in the murder case, a trial court had held Delhi police responsible for shoddy investigation. Following this, police commissioner K.K. Paul ordered the registration of a fresh FIR against unnamed persons for probing the destruction, tampering and fabrication of evidence and charges of conspiracy. 

 As part of the investigation headed by joint police commissioner, intelligence, U.K. Katna, the forensic experts are going to be questioned to find out more on the case. 

 The six who will be grilled are K.K. Jha, A. De, B.L. Bardhan (of the ballistics department), Kaushal Kumar (the biology department), Gautam Roy (photo department) and C.K. Chadha (fingerprinting). 

 The Central Forensic Science Laboratory had said in its ballistic report that two empty cartridges from two different guns were found at the scene of crime ? socialite Bina Ramanis restaurant Tamarind Court ? a claim that was not supported in the eyewitness accounts. The police inquiry seems to have been triggered by this claim by the forensic experts.

 In 2002, an in-house inquiry conducted by Paul, who was then the joint police commissioner, crime, had hinted at evidence-tampering in the case.

 One of the first heads to roll after the mass acquittal of the nine accused was that of former Mehrauli station house officer and investigating officer in the case, Surinder Sharma. 

 Sharma subsequently accused former forensic lab chief Roop Singh of evidence tampering. 

 The war of words between the two has now turned into a battle between Delhi police and the central forensic laboratory. 

 Earlier this week, the lab submitted a report to the Union home ministry blaming the police for giving them a faulty questionnaire designed to kill the case. 

 The forensic lab also pointed out that there was not only a time gap between the request for examination of samples and actual handing over of these but that Delhi police deliberately delayed calling forensic experts to the crime scene and handled the evidence carelessly.

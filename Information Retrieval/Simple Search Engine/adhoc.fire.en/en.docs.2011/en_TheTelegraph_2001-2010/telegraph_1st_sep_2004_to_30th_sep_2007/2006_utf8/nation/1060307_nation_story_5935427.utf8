 SC sends Salman to Rajasthan

 Salman: Setback

 New Delhi, March 6 (PTI): The Supreme Court today declined to entertain a plea by Salman Khan in the black buck poaching case, in which he and four other Bollywood stars are accused.

 Salman had approached the apex court contending that the statement of the prime witness, Harish Dulani, could not be accepted as evidence as he had not made himself available for cross-examination.

 However, a bench of Just- ices A.K. Bhan and L.S. Panta declared his petition dismissed as withdrawn and asked him to approach Rajasthan High Court with his grievances.

 Salman has accused the prosecution of intentionally not producing Dulani for cross-examination, contending that he was a false witness who had fabricated a case for police.

 Senior advocate Rajeev Dhavan, appearing for the actor, challenged the order of the chief judicial magistrate of Jodhpur, who had stated that the court could exercise its powers to question the accused with respect to the deposition made by Dulani.

 On February 27, the Jodhpur court framed charges against Salman, four of his co-stars ? Saif Ali Khan, Sonali Bendre, Neelam and Tabu ? and two Jodhpur residents for the alleged poaching of two black bucks in the village of Kankani on the intervening night of October 1 and 2, 1998.

 The charges were framed under the Wildlife Protection Act, which bans hunting of the black buck, and section 147 of the Indian Penal Code (unlawful assembly). Salman is main accused in the case.

 The two Jodhpur residents ? Dushyant Singh and Dinesh Ghawre ? are accused of abetting the crime and were charged under other sections of the wildlife act and the IPC.

 All the accused pleaded not guilty, preferring a trial.

 On February 17, Salman was convicted of hunting an endangered chinkara in Bhavad village, near Jodhpur, in September 1998, but delivered a suspended sentence of 30 days to appeal in a higher court.

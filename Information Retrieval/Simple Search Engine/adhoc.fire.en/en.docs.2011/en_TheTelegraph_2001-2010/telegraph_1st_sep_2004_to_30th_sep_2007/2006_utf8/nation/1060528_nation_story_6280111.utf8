 New Delhi, May 27 (Agencies): After the reservation rush, its time for a reality check.

 The Centre is looking at raising the number of seats to absorb the impact of increased quotas, but a parliamentary committee has said there is a serious shortage of faculty in central universities.

 In the 16 such universities, there were 1,988 vacancies as on March last year, with Banaras Hindu University and Delhi University having as many as 687 and 396 vacancies, respectively, the parliamentary standing committee on human resource development said in its report. 

 The situation is also far from satisfactory in JNU, Visva-Bharati and Mizoram University, it said, noting that out of the 1,988 vacant posts, 1,056 were of the lecturer category.

 Expressing surprise over such a large number of lecturers posts lying vacant, the committee feared that the situation might be worse in state universities.

 To attract and retain qualified and motivated teachers, the committee felt, there was a need to supplement their salaries with an attractive package of perquisites as well as support academic activities and recognise outstanding achievement.

 Our higher education system is faced with many challenges today. The pressure on it is going to increase further due to a large number of additional students expected to join higher education institutions in the coming years, particularly due to an upward pull generated by popular interventions like the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan and the mid-day meal scheme, the committee said.

 The panel also noted the tremendous imbalance in access to higher education between urban and rural areas, and said higher education in the country was largely a pro-rich and urban phenomenon.

 It said the University Grants Commission had introduced the scheme of establishing SC/ST cells in universities in 1983 to provide information regarding facilities available for them in educational institutions.

 But these attempts have not helped much, it said, adding that enrolment of Scheduled Caste students in higher education has ranged between 8.6 per cent in 1990-91 and 11.3 per cent in 2002-03, and between 2.1 per cent in 1990-91 and 3.6 per cent in 2003-04 for Scheduled Tribes.

 The panel recommended special programmes to encourage students from backward and minority communities as their participation in higher education was abysmally low.

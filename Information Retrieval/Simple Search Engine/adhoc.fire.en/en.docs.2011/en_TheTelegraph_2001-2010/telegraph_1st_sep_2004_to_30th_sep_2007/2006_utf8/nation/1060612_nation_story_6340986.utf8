 Doctor fined for bad nose job

 New Delhi (PTI): A consumer court has told a surgeon to pay Rs 1.1 lakh as compensation to an 18-year-old girl for leaving a gauze pack inside her nose that started giving off foul odour.

 Rejecting the appeal by Bangalore-based cosmetic surgeon B. Sadashiv Murthy, the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission held him guilty as he did not inform Rekha, a management student who underwent the nose job, that the gauze was to be removed within a day of the surgery.

 Not removing the gauze pack from the nose cavity inserted by the doctor is deficiency in service and negligence. This has caused mental agony to Rekha and her parents, said the commission bench. The anguish of this young girl who was shunned by her friends, college staff, hostel mates and was told to stay away from them for no fault of hers is agony and insult beyond doubt.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Hemmed in, Cong puts on brave face

 - Trouble trails party from Karnataka to Bihar, partners raise questions on govts credibility

 Sonia: Hands full

 New Delhi, Jan. 27: After the euphoria of Rahul Gandhis formal entry on the partys centre stage, the Congress today grappled with the more sobering realities of alliance politics, court raps and erring MPs.

 Facing the media for the first time after the Hyderabad jamboree, the party fielded uncomfortable questions on the Karnataka debacle, Buta Singhs resignation, CBI-law ministry contradictions on the Quattrocchi defreeze controversy and Left pressure on the Iran vote.

 Adding to these was the resignation of its Chandigarh MP, Pawan Kumar Bansal, as chairman of the House committee probing the misuse of the MPs development funds. Bansal has been accused of having misused his own allocation by giving Rs 5 lakh to a golf club to build a squash court in return for its honorary membership.

 The Congress tried to make the best of a bad situation. On Karnataka, it said we strained every sinew to save the Congress-Janata Dal (Secular) government from communal forces. But in private, leaders admitted the game was lost the day H.D. Deve Gowda called on Atal Bihari Vajpayee earlier this month.

 General secretary Ambika Soni insisted the Congress would not throw in the towel before the trust vote. It will be curtains for the chief minister only when the Dal (S) MLAs vote for communal forces. Let the people of Karnataka see which party is committed to secularism and which is not.

 She was later overtaken by events when N. Dharam Singh failed to take a vote of confidence and the Assembly was adjourned sine die.

 The Congresss calculation was that the Dal (S) would be the loser after aligning with the BJP as it has a large share of Muslim votes. 

 Party spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi tried to control damage from the Supreme Courts verdict on former Bihar governor Buta Singh and the BJPs demand that the Prime Minister should also quit.

 The court had accused Buta of misleading the Centre ahead of the Bihar Assembly dissolution last May but added the government should have been more circumspect.

 Despite saying the Centre was misled? the court does not go further in attaching importance to the issue, Singhvi said. By the BJPs yardstick, Vajpayee and Advani should have resigned several times because the court had questioned the NDAs decision on Ayodhya (and) the dissolution of the Gujarat Assembly, he added.

 Singhvi denied any delay in Butas resignation, arguing: The judgment came on Tuesday, copies were made available on Wednesday and he resigned on Thursday.

 On the Lefts demand that Delhi must not support any move to refer the Iran nuclear controversy to the UN Security Council, Singhvi said whatever decision is taken should be in national interest.

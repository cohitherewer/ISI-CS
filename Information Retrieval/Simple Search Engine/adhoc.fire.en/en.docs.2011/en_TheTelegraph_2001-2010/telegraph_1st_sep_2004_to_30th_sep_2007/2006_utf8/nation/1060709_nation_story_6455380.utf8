 Hue and cry as Hema signs in

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Hema Malini: In company of lightweights? 

 Bhopal, July 8: The Madhya Pradesh government today laid itself open to the charge of saffronisation of the arts by nominating BJP MP Hema Malini with a group of lightweights to the Bharat Bhavan Trust.

 The other nominees to the trust ? which looks after the countrys premier multi-arts complex ? are playwright Daya Prakash Sinha, painter Dilip Chinchalkar, writer Vinay Rajaram, singer Rajan Mishra and industrialist Sanni Gaur.

 This (the choice) indicates the formal process of saffronisation of arts and culture, said playwright and former trustee Habib Tanvir.

 Writer Manzoor Ehtisham went a step further, saying: The BJP seems to lack trust in all men and women of literature, arts and culture. Otherwise, there is no reason why it chose these lightweights. Other than Hema Malini and Rajan Mishra, one has not heard of the others.

 Pro-BJP writer Rameshwar Mishra Pankaj defended chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhans choice. The charge of saffronisation is laughable. Is Hema Malini saffron? Can her acting or dancing abilities be considered below par? 

 He admitted that Rajaram and Chinchalkar were not well known. But whats the harm in promoting youngsters?

 Hema and the others replace a defunct trust that included Manjit Bawa, Shabana Azmi and Tanvir, appointed by Digvijay Singhs Congress regime. The trustees are supposed to retire by rotation, but since 1998 there had been no replacement till the trust became defunct.

 The bhavan has had a history of feuds. A fed-up Bawa had once declared that artists were incapable of running a cultural complex like the bhavan.

 Hema and fellow trustees will be wading into fresh controversy with their first task ? that of organising a six-month celebration to mark the bhavans silver jubilee next February. The BJP government has announced it will not invite painter M.F. Husain, the man who had laid the buildings foundation stone with Tanvir.

 State culture minister Laxmikant Sharma says Husain doesnt deserve the honour because he has hurt Indian sentiments by drawing nude paintings of Mother India and Hindu gods and goddesses.

 I cannot felicitate him as he has made fun of Indian culture. He should have respected the sentiments of millions. He did not do so. We are not thinking of inviting him, Sharma said.

 Tanvir expressed shock at the decision, saying Husain had a key role in bringing fame to the bhavan. Some of the painters works are still on display there.

 To make a statement that Husain has harmed the Hindu religion is to rob the people ? especially artists ? of the freedom of expression. They (the BJP) are anti-art, anti-culture?.

 The Centre will nominate two more persons to the trust. These eight will then choose four more trustees. There will also be three bureaucrats as ex-officio members.

 Thiruvananthapuram, April 30: The slaying of Indian engineer K. Suryanarayana in Afghanistan has come as a tragic reminder of another murder, that of Border Roads Organisation driver Maniappan Raman Kutty from Keralas Alappuzha district.

 Maniappan was murdered by the Taliban in Afghanistan last November. Today, the news of Suryanarayanas murder has come as a second jolt to the people at Maniappans native village of Chingoli and nearby areas. 

 Nearly 7,000 people from Alappuzha district are employed with the Border Roads Organisation, though there are few left in Afghanistan now.

 E. Ahmed, the minister of state for external affairs, has condemned the Andhra Pradesh engineers murder as a dastardly act and vowed not to bow before such barbaric elements. 

 We were not given a chance to negotiate with the abductors or their interlocutors. The terrorists murdered the engineer even before the foreign ministry team had reached Kabul with the mandate to negotiate the release he said. 

 Maniappans widow Bindu said: Although somebody told the situation was grim, we were praying for the release of the engineer. 

 She said all countries that send their youths to work in Afghanistan should come together to prevent such ghastly crimes. 

 Bindu and her two children stay in Nangiarkulangara, a little distance from Chingoli. She is trying to put her life back on track after collecting nearly Rs 20 lakh as ex-gratia from various agencies. A central government job is on offer but the family perhaps wants her younger sister to get the job.

 M.R. Viswan, a former employee with the General Reserve Engineering Force (GREF), said at least one member from each family in Alappuzha and nearby places is serving with the engineering force, which is a sister concern of the Border Roads Organisation.

 The first wave of joining the GREF started with youths who had lost their livelihood following the reclamation of Kayamkulam canal decades ago. This almost coincided with the formation of GREF in 1960 and the able-bodied youths queued up before the GREF office as educational qualification was not the major criterion for employment, he said.

 Maniappans father Ramankutty, who stays in Chingoli with his wife, said: The central government should at least now sit up and take note. Our sons are taking up risky work in inhospitable terrain because of the abject conditions back home. Theres no meaning in bringing back all GREF employees from the risk zones.

 Maniappan had passed his school board examination before landing a job with GREF, courtesy his maternal uncles. His cousins L. Ravikumar and A. Pushpakumar serve in Jammu and Kashmir and Assam, respectively. His brother-in-law Sadanandan and first cousins Sahadevan, Chandran and Rathi are also with the GREF.

 Former non-resident Keralite affairs minister M.M. Hassan recalled that following Maniappans murder, the Kerala government had requested the Centre to bring back all Keralites working in trouble-prone areas. But there was resistance from GREF employees themselves and their families here as that would have led to loss of income.

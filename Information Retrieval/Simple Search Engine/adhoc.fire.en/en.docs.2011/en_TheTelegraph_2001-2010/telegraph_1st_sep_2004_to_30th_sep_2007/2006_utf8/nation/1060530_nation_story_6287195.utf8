 TN bills to repeal Jayas laws

 Chennai (PTI): Two bills for repealing the controversial anti-conversion law and Tamil Nadu Essential Services Maintenance Act (Tesma), enacted by the previous Jayalalithaa government, were introduced in the Tamil Nadu Assembly on Monday without being opposed.

 The Tamil Nadu Prohibition of Forcible Conversion of Religion ordinance was promulgated on October 5, 2002, prohibiting conversion from one religion to another by the use of force, by allurement or by fraudulent means. This ordinance was replaced by an act later. 

 However, the ADMK government decided to repeal the law and an ordinance for this was promulgated on May 18, 2004.

 The present government said the ordinance has lapsed and so a bill has been introduced in the current session.

 The government said that Tesma would be repealed as its provisions are draconian in character.

 Hindu act cry in South Africa

Durban (PTI): Hindu leaders in South Africa have asked the 

government to amend the countrys marriage act to accommodate customs and 

practices of the religion.

 The call came after a South African woman of Indian origin, Suchitra Singh, filed an application in the local high court for recognition of her Hindu marriage to Jailall Ramparsad in Durban 19 years ago.

 Singh, who was separated from her husband four years ago, now wants a legal separation to marry someone else. But this could happen only after her marriage is recognised by the law.

 She claimed that her rights had been violated by the marriage act as it did not have provisions for Hindu marriages.

 Officer pique

 Srinagar (PTI): The seniormost IAS officer of the Jammu and Kashmir cadre, B.R. Singh, has decided to quit after the appointment of C. Phunsog as the new chief secretary.

 I have decided to quit as my junior has been appointed as the chief secretary, Singh said.

 Jessica case

 New Delhi (PTI): South Africa-based businessman Deepak Bhojwani, 

a key witness in the Jessica Lal case, was interrogated by a special team of Delhi 

police. Bhojwani, a friend of Jessica, was the first witness to testify against 

Manu Sharma, who allegedly shot her.

 Sex racket

 Srinagar (PTI): A teenager who was allegedly pushed into 

a sex racket in Jammu and Kashmir has identified six of the 23 people, including 

senior police officials, paraded before her. Four have been arrested, the CBI 

informed the high court on Monday.

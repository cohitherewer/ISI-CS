 Land prices go up amp; up in Andhra

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Hyderabad, July 21: On February 21 this year, a 5.5-acre plot in Hyderabads upscale Jubilee Hills sold for Rs 335 crore, at Rs 1.42 lakh a square metre. Yesterday, 65 acres even in suburban Gachi Bowli ? 20 km from the city ? fetched Rs 703 crore at an auction.

 The BPO and biotech boom ? where 1,200 new jobs are reportedly created every day ? has turned Hyderabad into a real estate agents dream, with land prices rising by the week.

 Till now, the prices had been held in check by the fear that if Telengana got statehood, Hyderabad might be passed over to it. 

 That is now history with the government making it plain that if statehood happened, Hyderabad would become an independent Union territory.

 The Telengana factor will not affect land costs in Hyderabad any more, said Sudhir Reddy, Hyderabad Urban Development Authority (Huda) chairman.

 At yesterdays auction by Huda, nearly 50 real estate developers, including a few from Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore, bid for an hour starting from Rs 4.5 crore an acre.

 Gachi Bowli, in the Golden Mile Layout, is adjacent to the citys information technology hub, where the whos who of IT ? Infosys, Wipro, Microsoft and the like ? have set up shop.

 The location is just a 10-minute drive from the international airport and a 35-minute one from the city, said Venkatram Reddy, Huda secretary.

 The authority has lined up 100 more acres in the same area for auction.

 We have nearly 150 properties stretching to nearly 1,560 acres of prime land to be auctioned in a phased manner. We hope to raise a minimum of Rs 10,000 crore on this route to fund our expansion programmes, which include flyovers, new roads and road-widening, said an upbeat Sudhir Reddy.

 The last two auctions by the authority have triggered a new boom in real estate prices, jacking up the valuation of apartments and bungalows by over 40 per cent since January this year.

 Hyderabad will become another Mumbai or Bangalore in a matter of years, said the former president of AP Builders Association, Sekhar Reddy.

 Brinda ban

 Nagpur, Dec. 3 (PTI): Police today banned the entry of CPM leader Brinda Karat and five Dalit leaders to the city.

 Prakash Ambedkar, Ramdas Athwale, Jogendra Kawade, Sulekha Kumbhare and Rajendra Gavai were to participate in a rally to protest last months Dalit family massacre at Khairlanji, police said.

 Dalit organisations, who will not be allowed to take out a march here tomorrow, are likely to organise a peace meeting. The police have appealed to people not to assemble at Deekshabhoomi, where B.R. Ambedkar had embraced Buddhism in 1956.

 Navy chief confirms quit offer 

 OUR BUREAU

 Admiral Prakash 

 New Delhi/Bhopal, Aug. 8: The chief of the navy, Admiral Arun Prakash, today confirmed that he had prepared to resign after news of the war room leak broke last year and a relative of his was named as a suspect but defence minister Pranab Mukherjee rejected his offer to quit.

 Prakash is due to retire in October. He is now going through farewell visits that began last month with a surprise show at the Siachen Glacier where the navy has little, if anything at all, to do but his status as the chairman, chiefs of staff committee, was intended to be morale-boosting for the troops.

 The admiral said in Bhopal where he inaugurated a sailing club today that he stopped being in touch with his wifes nephew, Ravi Shankaran, as soon as he learnt that he (Shankaran) was running a business and was dealing with the armed forces. Shankaran, a former naval officer, is wanted by the CBI in connection with the navy war room leak case.

 It is my misfortune that the name of my wifes nephew is involved in this matter..., Prakash said. From the time he told me he is in business, I have not had any links with him. Now his name has come up... but I can do nothing about this. I have not spoken with him for some time now.

 One of the leads that investigators are following is a series of telephone calls that have been traced from the navy chiefs house to the offices run by Shankaran. He has been declared an absconder. Interpol has issued a red-corner notice for him.

 The navy chief has been reticent in talking about the war room leak case. In an interview that he gave to the in-house journal of the armed forces, the Sainik Samachar, this week, he said his responsibilities as the navy chief left him with little time to think about the controversy. He also insinuated that there could be vested interests working against him.

 I always believe that if you try to do something good and big, it affects many. While most people would be happy, there would be some who would be unhappy or would try to pick holes. The more you do, the more is the possibility of being written about. It happens, I am happy with the work I am doing, he said. 

 Three officers with the directorate of naval operations were summarily dismissed after an internal inquiry found that data had leaked from standalone computers through a pen-drive. The navy headquarters had said at first that the data was commercial in nature and did not compromise security interests but the CBI claimed the leak was more serious that it was first assumed.

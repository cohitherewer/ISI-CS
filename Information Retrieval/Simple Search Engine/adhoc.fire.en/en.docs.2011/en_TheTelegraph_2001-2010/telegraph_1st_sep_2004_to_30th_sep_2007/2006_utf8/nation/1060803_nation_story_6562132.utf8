 Navy, coast guard avert tragedy rerun

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Aug 2: Preventing a near-repeat of the fire tragedy at an ONGC offshore oil platform last year, the navy and the coast guard today rescued all crew members of a cargo vessel that sank precariously close to Bombay High and could have drifted and collided with an oil platform.

 On July 30, MV Oel Vision, a cargo vessel, developed engine trouble around 173 km west of Mumbai coast. Carrying 268 cargo containers and a crew of 28, the ship was on its way from Colombo to Pipavav port in Gujarat.

 It informed ONGC and they started a rescue and towing operation, hampered by bad weather. The ship tilted about seven degrees to one side, and had begun to sink and drift towards an oil platform, naval sources said.

 The vessel had reportedly drifted as close as half a nautical mile from the ONGC rig Rantop Mayer on the western side of Bombay High. 

 On July 27 last year, a vessel had drifted from its docked position due to high tide waves and had collided with a platform at Bombay High resulting in a major fire that killed over 12 people.

 According to protocol for such rescue operations, the Regional Contingency Committee that includes officials from the navy, the air force, the directorate general of shipping, ONGC and the coast guard, met at the Western Naval Command headquarters yesterday and decided to use Sea King naval helicopters to carry out a crew rescue operation.

 They airlifted 27 crew members around 9 pm last night, Commodore A.K. Karve, Chief Staff Officer, Operations, Western Naval Command said.

 This morning the captain of the ship, who had stayed back, was also rescued before the vessel sank around 4 am.

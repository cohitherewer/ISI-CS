 Pranab for Colombo

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 27: External affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee begins the new year with a trip to Colombo to invite Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapakse for the Saarc summit in Delhi in April.

 Mukherjee (in picture) will be in the island nation on January 8. While he is going as a host of the South Asian meet, the minister will try to persuade the Lankan leadership to exercise restraint in the ongoing strife with Tamil Tigers.

 The visit comes days after a group of pro-LTTE Tamil MPs met Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in Delhi to voice concern about the plight of the community in Lanka. 

 It was the first time a Prime Minister met pro-LTTE MPs after the organisation was banned following the assassination of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi.

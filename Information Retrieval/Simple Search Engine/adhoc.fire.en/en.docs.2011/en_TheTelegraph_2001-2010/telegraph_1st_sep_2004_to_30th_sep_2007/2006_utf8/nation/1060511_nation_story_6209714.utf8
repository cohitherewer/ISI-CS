 Priyanka scores vs Samajwadi

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 10: Priyanka Gandhis accusation that Uttar Pradesh minister Shivpal Yadav lured Rae Bareli voters with money bore fruit today with the Election Commission ordering a complaint be filed against him.

 The Samajwadi Party, however, had a mixed day with the poll panel giving a clean chit to minister Azam Khan in an office-of-profit controversy.

 PWD and power minister Shivpal ? a brother of chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav ? had been at the heart of Priyankas scrap with the Samajwadi at Rae Bareli which accused her of planning to rig the election. Priyanka hit back by objecting to Shivpal raising the slogan more vote, more note.

 After going through audio and video footage, the poll panel decided the minister had tried to bribe voters and asked the state chief electoral officer to file a complaint before an appropriate authority ? which could mean an FIR ? and send a compliance report by May 13.

 Khan, parliamentary affairs minister, was cleared in the light of recent legislation in the state House exempting the UP Jal Nigam, which he headed, from the profit list.

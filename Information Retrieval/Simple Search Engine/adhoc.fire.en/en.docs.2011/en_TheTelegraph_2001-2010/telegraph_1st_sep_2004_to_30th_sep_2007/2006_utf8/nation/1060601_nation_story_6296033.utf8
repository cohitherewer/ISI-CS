 Rain puts bus in grenade path

I just want to go back home

 Srinagar, May 31: It was plain bad luck for Shankar Bairagi and his fellow tourists from Bengal that it rained in Gulmarg today. Also, that Gandola, another point on their days itinerary, was without power.

 It forced us to return early to Srinagar, Bairagi said, wiping the blood oozing from his forehead. Else, we would have been back late in the evening.

 He added almost as an afterthought: We had heard that the situation in Kashmir wasnt very good. But we thought the militants wouldnt bother themselves with tourists.

 For Surajit Ghatak, it was a nightmare of another sort. The travel operator from Calcutta, who was on the other bus attacked by militants, is suffering from a deep sense of guilt.

 Ive been bringing tourists here for some time and I feel personally responsible for their safety. Im being wracked by guilt, especially about the two seriously injured tourists. I am praying to God for them, Ghatak said.

 Ghatak and his 36 clients had just returned from Sonamarg, and he was showing the group the tourist attractions around the Dal Lake as they neared their night stop, a hotel in Bishambernagar.

 While I was explaining the grandeur of the Dal Lake there was a loud explosion and the bus was filled with smoke. I was stunned for a moment. I thought I must have taken a hit, too.

 But I regained composure within minutes and somehow managed to open the door. As I tried to help the injured passengers off the bus, the local shopkeepers and commuters rushed to help.

 Basudev Naskar, a postal accounts office employee, was looking after his injured wife, Gayatri, and four-year-old daughter Tamali at the SMHS hospital.

 My first reaction was to look for my wife and daughter amid the dense smoke and smell of fire in the bus, Naskar said. After a few seconds, I saw my wife and daughter lying injured. But thank God, the doctors tell me their injuries are not very serious.

 Naskar said he had never imagined that the militants could target tourists.

 I had planned the holiday two months ago ? I wanted my wife and daughter to see Kashmir, he said. Now I just want to go back home.

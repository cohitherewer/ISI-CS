 ED showcause looms

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 4: The Enforcement Directorate is waiting for a go-ahead from the finance ministry to showcause former external affairs minister Natwar Singh and his son Jagat under the Foreign Exchange Management Act (Fema).

 The act deals with illegal possession, acquisition and transfer of foreign exchange. The directorate wants to showcause the father-son duo under Sections 3, 4 and 8 of Fema.

 Sources in the directorate said the officials have evidence of the money trail leading to Jagat, which the R.S. Pathak inquiry could not establish in its report.

 Due to the complex money transactions involved in the case, the directorate is almost certain to get a go-ahead from the finance ministry to showcause Jagat and two others believed to have benefited from the contracts, the sources said. 

 But a nod for similar proceedings against Natwar could take longer to come as it would be a political decision taken at the highest level.

 The Enforcement Directorate also believes that the Mercedes Benz impounded from Jagats New Delhi home 10 days ago was purchased with the money he allegedly made from the Iraqi oil-for-food contracts. 

 Jagat today denied owning the car. I dont have a Mercedes Benz, he said. I challenge the Enforcement Directorate to produce insurance documents and registration papers of the car.

 The luxury car, bearing the registration number DL 3C Q 1010, was found to be in the name of a travel agent, identified as Chetan Gupta.

 The Enforcement Directorate is now trying to ascertain if Jagat used any fraudulent route for purchasing the Benz.

 Hitting out at the investigating agency, Jagat said the ED has no evidence against him and his father, yet it harassed them.

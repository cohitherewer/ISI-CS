 Mumbai, Oct. 19: For some 

 families in Mumbai, Diwali is a festival of eco-friendly 

 lights.

 As diyas and crackers light up Mumbai leaving a cloud of smoke in their wake, 5,000 eco-friendly lanterns will burn this year in a quiet battle to keep the city clean.

 Aamod Shetye, a medical store owner in Dadar, has been producing these lanterns made of handmade paper, ice cream sticks, cloth and cardboard for the past two years. He runs 10 units in the city.

 Initially, we didnt manage to sell many of these lanterns. People thought they would not get as much variety as in plastic lanterns. I have decided that even if I dont make profit, I will continue to encourage artisans to make eco-friendly lanterns, says Shetye, who organises the Kandeel (lantern) Mahaotsav every year in the city.

 Contrary to popular belief, the lanterns come in various shapes and sizes. Folding lanterns made from a bamboo mattress are shaped like fish or temples and decorated with coloured cloth. 

 The price ranges between Rs 60 and 350. Lanterns made of handmade paper and sandwich paper in red, maroon, yellow, blue, orange and white with traditional motifs cost Rs 100. 

 This year lanterns made of appliqu, a temple art from Orissa, are being introduced.

 An average lantern takes four hours to make the smaller the lantern, the more intricate the work. A team of around eight starts working two-three months in advance. 

 The smallest lantern in Shetyes kitty measures 2 inches and is popularly called a car lantern. Priced at Rs 150, each takes one and a half days to make. There is a lot of demand from corporate offices and banks like HSBC and SBI for this type of lantern, he says. 

 The largest lantern measures six feet and is made of cardboard and coloured paper and can cost anything between Rs 20 and Rs 400, depending on the design and other factors. 

 Shetye also has a loyal clientele among children who are drawn by the lanterns shaped like cartoon characters. 

 I got this idea when I had gone to Singapore. I saw the characters there. I brought the idea to Mumbai and spoke to some local retailers..... You should see the demand from kids. They want to hang them in their rooms, he says.

 Shetyes art has also found global appreciation. He has exported 30 eco-friendly lanterns to the UK.

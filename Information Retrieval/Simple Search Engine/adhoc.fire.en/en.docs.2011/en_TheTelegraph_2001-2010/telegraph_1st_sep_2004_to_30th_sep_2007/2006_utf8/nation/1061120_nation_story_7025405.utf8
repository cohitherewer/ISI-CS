 RSS film relents on Sikhs

 New Delhi, Nov. 19 (PTI): Ahead of the Assembly elections in Punjab, the producers of an RSS film have deleted a controversial scene that showed Sikhs being protected by Hindus at the time of Partition.

 The original version of the film on Sangh leader M.S. Golwalkar screened in a Delhi auditorium on Independence Day immediately after RSS chief K.S. Sudarshan spoke about the organisations role in protecting Hindus during the Partition riots showed a Sikh man and woman being saved by Sangh activists.

 Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee chief Harvinder Singh Sarna, a fierce critic of Shiromani Akali Dal president Parkash Singh Badal, had then opposed the scene.

 The 110-minute film, released by former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee yesterday, now does not have the scene showing a Sikh man being beaten by rioters.

 Instead, it only shows RSS activists saving a woman from attackers.

 In Punjab, Badal is under attack from different Akali groups for his ties with the BJP. He has been accused of allowing the RSS interference in Sikh religious affairs.

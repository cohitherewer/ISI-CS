 Telgi faints before confession

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Telgi: Hard days

 Mumbai, Feb. 8: Abdul Karim Telgi fell unconscious today, hours before he was to continue his in-camera confession in the multi-crore fake stamps case.

 Telgi, who allegedly masterminded the Rs 30,000 crore scam, had complained of chest pain and breathlessness this morning before he lost consciousness at Yerawada central jail. He was rushed to Sassoon General Hospital around 10 am and is reported to be stable, jail authorities said.

 Prison officials were scheduled to escort Telgi to appear before chief judicial magistrate D.W. Modak at 11 am for the third consecutive day to record his voluntary confession in a 1995 fake stamp paper seizure case lodged in Mumbai.

 Telgi is afflicted with HIV and ailments like diabetes and high blood pressure.

 Last week, speaking via video-conferencing from Yerawada jail, Telgi had told sessions court judge U.D. Salvi that he wished to make a confession about his role in the case. 

 The court ordered that Telgi be produced before a Pune first-class judicial magistrate. Appearing before the Pune magistrate, Telgi opted to make an in-camera confession, which began on Monday.

 When complete, the confession would be sealed and despatched to Mumbai to be opened before Judge Salvi.

 He complained of chest pain and high blood pressure and was unconscious for some time. The jail officials informed the court that he could not be produced today. Doctors have informed us that he is conscious and stable now, but his blood pressure and sugar levels have shot up considerably, Telgis lawyer Harshad Nimbalkar said from Pune.

 Telgis hospitalisation has put a question mark on whether he would be able to continue the confession, in which he was expected to name several bigwigs who helped him prosper, including politicians, senior IPS officers and officials of the Nasik Security Press.

 Telgi had also hinted at making confessions in other cases in Maharashtra, including the seizure of fake stamps worth Rs 2,200 crore.

 Facing conviction in 10 different states, Telgi was found guilty last month and sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for 10 years by Judge Salvi in the first of the 48 cases lodged against him.

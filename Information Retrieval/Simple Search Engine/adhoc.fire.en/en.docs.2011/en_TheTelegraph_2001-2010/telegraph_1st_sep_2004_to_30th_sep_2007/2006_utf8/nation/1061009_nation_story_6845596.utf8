 Black law burial plan with rebirth punch 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 8: A controversial law that gives troops extraordinary powers to detain, grill or shoot at people in Manipur and Nagaland will be repealed if the Centre accepts the recommendations of a review committee.

 But rights activists are livid that some of the provisions of the black law including the licence to the armed forces to shoot at anyone they suspect to be a terrorist are to be kept alive by incorporating them into an all-India law.

 The Justice Jeevan Reddy committee has said the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA) should be scrapped because it is inadequate and is seen as a symbol of oppression in the Northeast. But it wants some of its thorniest features included in the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 2004.

 The Reddy committee has sought to empower intervention by the armed forces anywhere, not only in Manipur. The suffering of the people of Manipur will now be the suffering of people all over India, said Colin Gonsalves of the Human Rights Law Network.

 For years, the AFSPA has provoked protests in Manipur. Its against this law that Irom Sharmila has been holding her widely publicised, intermittent fast since 2000.

 The five-member Reddy panel was formed in 2004 after the alleged rape and murder of Manorama Devi by Assam Rifles troops led to fiery protests, including one in the nude by elderly Manipuri women. 

 The committee notes that Article 355 of the Constitution which makes it the Centres duty to protect states against external aggression and internal disturbance already empowers Delhi to send the army into a state. So it doesnt need the AFSPA for this purpose.

 The panel has recommended that the armed forces not interrogate accused as was allowed under the AFSPA but hand them over to the police. Critics, however, cite that the Supreme Court had passed a similar ruling in 1997.

 Acknowledging the concerns over human rights violations, the committee has recommended grievance cells in every district where the troops are deployed.

 These three-member cells are to be headed by a sub-divisional magistrate. One of the members should be an officer not below captain from the armed forces units operating in the region, and the second a state police officer not below deputy superintendent.

 The grievance cells, however, will only have the authority to obtain information from the armed forces and the state government on civilian complaints of rights abuse.

 Its the committees way of removing the feeling of discrimination in some northeastern states that has bemused rights activists.

 The ULP Act applies to entire India including the northeastern states. (If provisions from the AFSPA are incorporated into this Act) the complaint of discrimination would then no longer be valid, the committee said.

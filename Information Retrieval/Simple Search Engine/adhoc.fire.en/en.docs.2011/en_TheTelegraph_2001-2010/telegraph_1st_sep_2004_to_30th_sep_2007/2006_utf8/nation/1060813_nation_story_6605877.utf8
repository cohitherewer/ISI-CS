 Natwar-ally Amar backs off

 Natwar

 New Delhi, Aug. 12 (PTI): Samajwadi Party leader Amar Singh today distanced himself from Natwar Singh, saying the developments that led to his suspension were an internal matter of the Congress.

 Let me make it very clear that the Natwar Singh issue is the internal matter of the Congress party, said Amar, who came to be known as one of Natwars new found friends following the release of the Pathak panel report in the oil-for-food scam, said.

 He said that ever since we came into contact with each other, a malicious campaign had been launched branding him as a tutor and coach to Natwar.

 I am neither his tutor nor coach... I am a toddler. I was born in 1956 when Natwar was a seasoned diplomat representing India in China. He is the forefather of diplomacy, Amar said, adding he was distancing from this dirty campaign.

 Amar said the meetings he and other non-Congress leaders had with Natwar were in connection with the Indo-US nuclear deal as it was a key issue concerning the countrys security.

 He said Yashwant Sinha was a former foreign minister and we along with Natwar Singh exchanged views on the Indo-US nuclear deals and there wont be any compromise on the issue.

 Asked why he took this sudden decision to dissociate from Natwar, Amar said: We will still stand by him as firmly as we have. I am close to him and will continue to be so at a personal level in future too.

 We will also support him in Parliament when he would be speaking on the Pathak committee report.

 Asked if he was distancing himself because he had failed to get Natwar to go against Congress chief Sonia Gandhi, Amar said: I had no strategy. I have no strategy in this regard.

 BJP salvo

 BJP leader M.M. Joshi has said the Pathak commission should have examined Sonia as the Congress had been named as a beneficiary in the oil-for-food scam.

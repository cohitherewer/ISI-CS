 Train kills family of mourners

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chennai, Oct. 31: A group 

 of 17 mourners from the same family and the driver of their 

 autorickshaw died today when a train hit the vehicle at 

 a railway crossing.

 The family from Orikkai was going to the neighbouring village of Pudupakkam to attend a funeral when all were crushed to death near Kancheepuram.

 The autorickshaw developed a sudden engine problem as it approached the unmanned level crossing and got stuck in the middle of the tracks around 10.30 this morning, district collector Pradeep Yadav said. 

 As the driver desperately tried to pull the vehicle off the tracks, a fast local running from Tirumalpur near Arakkonam to Chennai Beach rammed into it, dragging the autorickshaw for nearly a kilometre. All occupants and the driver died almost instantly. 

 Share autorickshaws are supposed to carry a maximum of six passengers, but 17 had crammed into this vehicle. Of those killed, 14 were women, the Kancheepuram district collector said.

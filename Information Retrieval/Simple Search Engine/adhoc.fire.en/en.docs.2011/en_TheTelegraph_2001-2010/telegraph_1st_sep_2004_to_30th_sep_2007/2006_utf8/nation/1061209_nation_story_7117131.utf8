 Pak scores in women race

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Dec. 8: Pakistan and Bangladesh have more women parliamentarians than India, thanks to quotas.

 Data submitted to the Rajya Sabha this week revealed Pakistan has 73 women in a 342-member National Assembly and Bangladesh has 52 in a 300-strong Parliament. India, with 545 members in the Lok Sabha, has only 46.

 We are surprised by the statistics showing women in Pakistan and Bangladesh are better represented in Parliament than in India, said an official in the ministry of women and children.

 The status of women overall is better in India. The paradox is that countries whose track record on the status of women is much worse have sent more women to Parliament, the official added.

 Both the neighbours have done what India has not brought in laws to increase womens representation in the highest decision-making body.

 Bangladesh, for example, had only six women parliamentarians to begin with. A provision for 30 reserved seats for women in its Constitution lapsed in 2001, after which the government brought in a constitutional amendment bill to reserve 45 seats for women.

 The United Nations Development Fund for Women says legislative measures in Pakistan yielded similar results. A 22 per cent seat reservation led to much greater visibility of women in the legislature. 

 A third neighbour, Nepal, is now considering a 33 per cent quota for women.

 But in India, a bill to grant women 33 per cent quota in state legislatures and Parliament has been in the cold storage for a decade, with political parties going all out to stall it. 

 This is in spite of studies that show that women often are better policy-makers. A study by Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) on the impact of women policy-makers in Bengal and Rajasthan has shown that women local leaders invest much more in infrastructure, water, road and education.

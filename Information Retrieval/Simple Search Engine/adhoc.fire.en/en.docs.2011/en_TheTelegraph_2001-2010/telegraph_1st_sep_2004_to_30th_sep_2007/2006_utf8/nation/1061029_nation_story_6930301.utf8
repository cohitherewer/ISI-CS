The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 The smoking gun

 New Delhi, Oct. 28: Calling for a ban on smoking in films is the first step towards a total ban on cigarette and beedi manufacture. A total ban on cigarettes, claimed health minister Anbumani Ramadoss, is only a question of time.

 In an interview to a television channel, he indicated that only differences in perspective between various arms of the government and industry were delaying the ban.

 I would be very happy (to press for a total ban on cigarettes). This ban is just a question of time. I cant initiate it today. I would like to but there are other things involved in this, he said.

 The commerce and agriculture ministries, apart from the tobacco industry, have voiced reservations about a ban on tobacco, a lucrative revenue source.

 But Ramadoss emphasised he would continue to insist on a ban on smoking in films.

 Shah Rukh Khans cigar-smoking Don, which controversially got a universal certificate from the censor board, also came up for criticism.

 My experts say Shah Rukh Khan smoking in a movie is much more effective than a direct advertisement of a tobacco product, he said.

 Movies with smoking scenes are now mandated to be given an adult certificate.

 On the dengue crisis, Ramadoss blamed states for not doing enough, despite being given ample support from the Centre. We have a national vector policy in the country, and they advise the state governments. We provide chemicals and larvaecides. They do the implementation.

 Ramadoss described P. Venugopal as one of the worst administrators in the country, in a repeat of an earlier statement made after the AIIMS directors dismissal in July.

 Dr Venugopal is one of the best doctors in the country. But he is also one of the worst administrators in the country. It is not as if a good doctor can become a good administrator as well.

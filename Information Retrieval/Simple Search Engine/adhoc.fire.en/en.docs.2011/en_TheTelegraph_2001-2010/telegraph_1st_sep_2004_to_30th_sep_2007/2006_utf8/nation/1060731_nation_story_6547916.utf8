 New Delhi/Manama, July 30: At least 16 Indians, all from Tamil Nadu, died of suffocation today when a fire broke out in a three-storeyed building where over 200 expatriates live in this capital city of Bahrain.

 The fire, apparently caused by a short circuit, broke out at around 2.30 am (5 am IST) in the second floor of the building used as a residence for workers in the Gudabiya area here, officials said.

 Nearly 16 suffocated to death due to heavy smoke, seven were injured and 196 have been rescued, the interior ministry said.

 Indian ambassador to Manama Balakrishna Shetty and Baharain Prime Minister Shaikh Khalifa bin Salm al Khalifa visited the site along with senior ministers. 

 Expressing condolences to the Indian government, Khalifa told his ministers to ensure that steps are taken to prevent such accidents. 

 Shetty said the seven injured suffered from carbon monoxide poisoning and were on oxygen support in a hospital.

 One of the injured also suffered a fracture in his hand as he tried to jump from a window after breaking its glass, he said. 

 The ambassador said all the victims ? both dead and injured ? were from Tamil Nadu and worked for the Royal Construction Company. The people on the ground floor and the first floor escaped the fire and shifted to a neighbouring gym, he added.

 The Indian ministry of external affairs is making efforts to ensure that those injured are treated well. 

 Our embassy with the cooperation of the Bahrain government is taking all the necessary actions, minister of state for external affairs E. Ahmed said.

 Shetty said the company was warned in January about the poor safety of the workers but had not taken adequate measures and was flouting labour laws. 

 He added that the workers lived in overcrowded rooms with no ventilation.

 Once we get the list of the victims, we will contact their families and ask where they want the last rites to be performed, Shetty said.

 Police said the incident took place when there were 218 people in the building. However, the workers claimed that there were over 350 Indians.

 Hyderabad, Nov. 10: How do you make a group of talented, individualistic teammates work for a common purpose?

 Just watch how Gregory Peck, as Captain Keith Mallory, does it in The Guns of Navarone.

 Or, say, you have been assigned a job your team isnt quite qualified to do. How do you inspire them to meet the challenge?

 By learning from Colonel Nicholson, of course, who has it all worked out in The Bridge on the River Kwai. Or T.E. Lawrence (Peter Toole) in Lawrence of Arabia.

 At least, so believe infotech firms and BPOs in Hyderabad, who are making middle-level managers sit through screenings of vintage Hollywood movies so they can pick up leadership skills.

 That this is being done during office hours, in the companies own mini-auditoriums, is proof of how seriously they are taking the matter.

 After the screening, a discussion is held with the HR department, where a typical question would be: Have you learnt anything from the character of Colonel Nicholson (played by Sir Alec Guinness) today, Vasudevan?

 Its about building not only leadership but also teamwork, say the companies, mostly multinationals based in the UK or the US. 

 We want our techies to work in consonance with the companys agenda rather than their personal agendas. Most of the films we screen show that only collective decision and action led to an overall and cumulative climax, said Col. Gowrishankar, senior executive with the US-based Sierra Atlantic Inc.

 One reason for the innovative training is the high attrition rate reportedly above 25 per cent among senior-level executives in the software development and BPO companies. This means firms have to make their middle-level staff punch above their weight till they can fill the vacant slots.

 We want the middle levels to be conversant with the functions and responsibilities of their immediate supervisory levels for any emergencies, said Nalini Muralidharan, an HR headhunter with a multinational BPO.

 The exercise is paying dividends, said an executive whose firms operations had slumped in early 2005 after the sudden departure of 20 senior techies.

 The three-month training focuses on leadership, helps techies brush up on their skills and familiarises them with the companys business plans that are usually not revealed to middle-level staff. The films are a crucial part of it.

 Recently, one of the firms screened 

 Ek Ruka Hua Faisala, a Hindi adaptation of the English 

 movie Twelve Angry Men. The story of how a young 

 man helps his 11 fellow jurors drop their prejudices against 

 the defendant is a lesson in the importance of tact and 

 firmness in group discussions.

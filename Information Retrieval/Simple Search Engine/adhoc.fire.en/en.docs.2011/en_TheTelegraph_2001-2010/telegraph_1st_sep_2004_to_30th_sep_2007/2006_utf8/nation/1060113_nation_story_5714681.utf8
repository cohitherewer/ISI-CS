 Aamir film

 New Delhi, Jan. 12 (PTI): The Aamir Khan-starrer Rang De Basanti has once again run into trouble with the Animal Welfare Board of India today withdrawing the mandatory permission for its screening.

 Acting on a submission by BJP leader and animal right activist Maneka Gandhi, the board has decided that parts of the film involving animals were shot before obtaining the permission, its secretary Balasubrahmanyam said.

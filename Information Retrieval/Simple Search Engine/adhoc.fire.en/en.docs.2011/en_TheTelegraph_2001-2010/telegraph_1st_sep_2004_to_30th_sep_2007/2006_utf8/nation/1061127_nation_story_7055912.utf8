 Chiria door shut on Mittal

 Ranchi, Nov. 26: Jharkhand chief minister Madhu Koda today said his government was ready to offer an alternative iron ore mine to Mittal Steel for its greenfield project, but the company was welcome to explore its options outside if it was not ready to look beyond Chiria in the state.

 Kodas statement comes days after Sanak Mishra, Mittal Steel India CEO, was quoted as saying there was no question of setting up the plant in Jharkhand without access to the rich Chiria reserves.

 Koda told a news conference the state could do little on Chiria, over whose control the government is locked in a court battle with Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL).

 Mittal Steel cannot be assured of a mining lease at Chiria as a case is pending in Jharkhand High Court. If they want a mining lease at Ankua, we can do the needful, the chief minister said.

 Government officials said Kodas offer of Ankua, which Mittal Steel has already rejected, indicates he is ready to sacrifice the project.

 Mittal Steel, a source said, had told the government earlier that Ankua was not large enough for the big equipment necessary to mine about one million tonnes of iron ore every day.

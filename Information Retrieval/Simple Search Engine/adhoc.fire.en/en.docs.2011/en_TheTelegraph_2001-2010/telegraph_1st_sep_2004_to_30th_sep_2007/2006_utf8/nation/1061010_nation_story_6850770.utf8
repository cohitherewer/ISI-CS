 Siachen recce before gesture

 SUJAN DUTTA

 Pranab

 New Delhi, Oct. 9: Defence minister Pranab Mukherjee is to be given a recce of the northern glacier in Siachen tomorrow and briefed by the army ahead of a Diwali-Id peace gesture that Delhi is expected to make to Islamabad.

 Mukherjee will be accompanied by army chief General Joginder Jaswant Singh. 

 The army chief assisted by the commander of the Leh-headquartered 14 Corps will give a presentation and mark the developments since the October 2003 ceasefire.

 The military divides Siachen into three sectors northern, central and southern. The map reference point, NJ9842, is in the southern sector. This is where the Actual Ground Position Line along the Saltoro Ridge originates flanking the glacier to the north and the west. 

 The northern glacier has some of the most forbidding heights. It is also completely air-maintained, meaning troops here are almost wholly reliant on supplies dropped by helicopters. 

 In the three years since the ceasefire, the army has been able to build roads that are used seasonally in the southern sector.

 Proposals to demilitarise Siachen proffered by analysts have ranged from sector-wise disengagement to the establishment of a nature reserve. 

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh during his visit called for carving out a peace mountain in Siachen. But the stalemate in talks continues over the issue of where the troops should pull back, from up to which point. That is how the 10th and last round of talks between the defence secretaries ended this May. 

 Indias reconsideration of a gesture over Siachen identified by both sides as among the most solvable of outstanding bilateral issues comes three years after the ceasefire. Both armies assert that since the ceasefire, not a bullet has been fired. (Firing does still take place in Siachen to trigger avalanches that would otherwise threaten to bury army camps.)

 Delhi and Islamabad are expected to warm up for revival of the secretary-level talks in the Diwali-Id week beginning October 20.

 Mukherjee said here today that his visit to Siachen tomorrow was routine. He is expected to return by evening after touching down in the airfield in Thoise and at the Siachen base camp.

 Rahul must wait: Sonia

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 26: Sonia Gandhi has ruled out the induction of younger party leaders in the council of ministers in the near future. 

 In an interview to a television news channel, which will be telecast on Saturday, the Congress president said: I am not saying that they are not doing very much. But I feel that they can certainly do a little more, wait a little more and gain a little more experience in Parliament. 

 She added: The number is restricted. So even if I would like to do so, circumstances do not permit us to do so.

 Asked whether this circumstance 

 applied to Rahul Gandhi, Sonia quoted what her son had said 

 earlier. He would rather like to wait and watch before 

 taking up a position of responsibility.

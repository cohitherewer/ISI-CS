The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Cricket race runs into row

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Mumbai, April 5: Licking its wounds after losing 

telecast rights of the India-Pakistan Abu Dhabi Friendship Cup to PDM International, 

IMG has thrown its hat in the ring again.

 This time, it is bidding for matches that will be played between the neighbours in neutral venues over the next five years.

 And giving a healing touch to IMGs bruised pride would be the controversy clouding the bid by PDMs ward Sahara, which sponsors Team India and holds the telecast rights of the current India-England series.

 Zee Telefilms, Nimbus and ESPN-STAR Sports submitted their bids to the BCCI today amid a hue and cry about Saharas bid coming minutes after the deadline and in an unsealed cover.

 Sahara is being shown undue leniency, though they have violated norms, said a senior official representing a broadcaster.

 BCCI vice-president Lalit Modi, however, rubbished the protests, saying Sahara had not done anything wrong. The channel deposited the earnest money ? $5 million ? yesterday and its representatives came to his office 15 minutes before the deadline, Modi said.

 BCCI sources said that when it came to filing relevant documents, most bidders were deficient on some technical ground or other. The matter would be debated once the bids are opened on April 6, they said.

 The bids are for an estimated 25 matches to be played between India and Pakistan over five years in venues like Sharjah and Abu Dhabi. 

 The BCCI will tomorrow announce the verdict for the coverage that may fetch it at least $100 million dollars (about Rs 470 crore). 

 The board has fixed a reserve price of $5 million dollars a match and the total kitty could be more than $120 million dollars.

 The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), to avoid any controversy, has prepared legal documents to formally exclude the two ODIs in Abu Dhabi from the five-year agreement. 

 A BCCI source said although the bidders have been told that there would be 25 matches, the number has not been discussed with the PCB in detail yet.

 The two-match Abu Dhabi Friendship Cup is being organised to raise funds for people hit by the earthquake on October 8, 2005. 

 The International Cricket Council has decided to award official status to the matches that will be played on April 18 and 19.

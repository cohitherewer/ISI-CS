 Airport drill takes off

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi, Aug. 10 : A comprehensive security 

drill has been activated in airports across India after the London plot was unearthed.

 Quick reaction teams of paramilitary forces have been deployed in 65 airports, already on toes in the wake of the July 11 Mumbai train blasts.

 With the London incident and August 15 celebrations round the corner, we are naturally on high alert, a security official said.

 More explosive detection equipment are being pressed into service and stricter access control most airports had banned entry of visitors after the July 11 attacks is being enforced. Emergency anti-hijacking measures have also been put in place.

 We are also ensuring 100 per cent manual checking of cabin baggage for flights to... destinations that we feel could be targeted, besides about 50 per cent check in normal aircraft, an airport official said. Usually, cabin baggage is cleared after an X-ray scan with random manual searches once in a while. 

 We also have lists of passenger profiles. Plainclothes personnel have been deployed to keep an eye on suspicious movement, the official added.

 As part of the security beef-up, a two-tier security check is being followed. The government has also placed air marshals on select flights operating within India as well as to foreign destinations.

 The tourism circuit is being monitored closely, too. Civil aviation sources said the government has given instructions to increase security on flights to the US and Europe as these are considered particularly prone to terror strikes. 

 The number of CISF personnel at major airports has been increased. A proposal to import body scanners to detect suspicious objects is under consideration but it is not clear whether the government would allow such an intrusive practice.

 Black Cats for nuclear facility

 A contingent of the National Security Guards arrived in Chennai by a special plane from Delhi, adds PTI. The 38-strong NSG squad later left by road for the Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research at Kalpakkam, about 75 km from Chennai.

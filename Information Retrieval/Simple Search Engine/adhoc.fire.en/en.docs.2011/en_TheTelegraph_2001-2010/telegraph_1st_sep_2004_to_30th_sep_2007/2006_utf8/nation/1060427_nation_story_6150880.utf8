 Khatau son acquitted

 Mumbai, April 26 (PTI): Manish Khatau, son of industrialist Mahendra Khatau, was acquitted today by a fast-track court in a hit-and-run case.

 Manish had reportedly run his car over a police constable, seriously injuring him, at Marine Drive in south Mumbai on August 15, 2005.

 He was arrested and charged with offences of attempt to murder and that of preventing a public servant from performing his duty. 

 The police, however, did not charge him with rash and negligent driving, which led to his acquittal today. 

 Manish bore the medical expenses of the constable.

 Nine witnesses were examined but the prosecution failed to prove any of the charges.

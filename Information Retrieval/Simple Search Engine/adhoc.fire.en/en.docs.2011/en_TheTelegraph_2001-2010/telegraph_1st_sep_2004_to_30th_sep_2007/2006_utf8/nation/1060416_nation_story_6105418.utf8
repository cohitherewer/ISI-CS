 Party piles dam heat on Singh

 - Modis Gujarat card rattles Congress; Rang De Basanti runs into BJP ire

New Delhi, April 15: If Narendra Modi cried foul in public, so did the Congress, but in private.

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs reluctance in announcing a decision on the Narmada issue has as much to do with pressure from within the Congress as Modis protest.

 Some influential Congress leaders reportedly conveyed to Singh that the Centre must not do anything that would go against the sentiments of the people of Gujarat or undermine the party in the state. 

 They voiced their unhappiness with the recommendation of the review committee of the Narmada Control Authority to suspend work to increase the height of the dam until the displaced were rehabilitated. The Congress leaders said water resources minister Saifuddin Soz, who chairs this committee, was misled by some bureaucrats. 

 Ahmed Patel, the political secretary to Congress president Sonia Gandhi and the undeclared number two in the party hierarchy, told the Gujarat leaders they were at liberty to go ahead with their agitation against Medha Patkar, highly-placed sources said.

 What was not certain was whether Patel was backed by Sonia or not. Sonia is usually reluctant to associate the Congress with anything that will affect the partys aam admi image. Besides, she is concerned about the health of Medha Patkar, who is continuing her hunger strike in hospital.

 Congress sources said Modis victory in the 2002 elections was not only because of the religious polarisation. They said he profited by his active championing of the Sardar Sarovar issue and the propagation of the view that the Narmada waters would transform Gujarat into an oasis.

 The Congress sources recalled that his favourite slogan was Narmadey Sarvadey (Narmada is supreme). He got a lot of mileage from an achievement for which the Congress should justly take the credit because we laid the foundation of the dam. But we failed, a Congress leader said.

 The Congress fears that if Modi was allowed to steal the Narmada thunder, this time too, the party may as well abandon what little hope it had of reviving itself in Gujarat. 

 So, even on pain of being seen with the BJP, Congress strategists decided to hit the streets against Medha. It is not a question of being pro- or anti-BJP. The Narmada is worshipped by every Gujarati, Hindu or Muslim, upper caste or Dalit. If the Congress and BJP share a stand on it, so be it, said a source.

 Asked what the party would do if the protests turned violent ? already there are reports of vandalism ? or were hijacked by the Sangh parivar, a Congress leader said: We will see, we will cross the bridge then.

 If the perceptions of the central and state units do not match, we have decided we should go along with the state and support their views, he added.

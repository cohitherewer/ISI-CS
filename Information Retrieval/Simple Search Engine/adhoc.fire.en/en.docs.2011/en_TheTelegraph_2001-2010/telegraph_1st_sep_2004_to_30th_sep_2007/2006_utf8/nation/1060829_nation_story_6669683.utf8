 Srinagar, Aug. 28: Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front chief Yasin Malik today said al Qaida would not be allowed to set up base in Kashmir as it would turn the whole world against the freedom struggle in the state.

 Back from the US after three months where he had gone for treatment, Malik appealed to the people not to support al Qaida but clarified he was not aware of its presence in Kashmir just yet.

 If al Qaida starts its operations in Kashmir, the whole world will turn against the ongoing freedom struggle in Kashmir, he told a news conference.

 Any association with it will harm the present movement as the whole world is pitted against it. We are sure to lose sympathy for our cause should we have any liaison with it.

 Malik said the JKLFs cause is just and sacrifices are colossal. It must continuously return to its basic principles and put forward an ethical articulation of its struggle so that it wins more and more friends around the region and the world.

 The pro-independence leader announced the JKLF would launch a non-violent resistance programme from September 7 against rights violations in the Valley.

 We will begin with a day-long hunger strike on September 7. From September 9, peaceful protests will be held in all major towns in Kashmir against the recent human rights violations in Kashmir.

 Malik said the zero tolerance the Prime Minister promised against rights violations should be honoured and observed in letter and spirit.

 The Prime Minister had given the assurance during his visit. He should ensure that his commitment to Kashmir is carried out by troops deployed on the ground.

 Malik said that during talks with officials in the US, he had pointed out that the current exercise was a consultation process for Kashmiris. But it should be replaced with a negotiation process where a solution that satisfies the Kashmiri aspiration for independence can be arrived at with India and Pakistan.

 He stressed that the need of the hour was to build a non-violent and ideological force that is more vocal and more powerful in its actions.

 Clash shuts Gaya temple

 Gaya: Gayas Vishnupad temple witnessed 

 a clash between Gaywal pandas (senior priests) and 

 police outside the shrine on Wednesday, reports our correspondent.

 The main gate of the temple, where thousands of people come to perform salvation rituals for the dead (pindadan) during Pitra Paksh (September 6-21 this year), was closed after the violence.

 The pandas exchanged blows with the police on hearing that a policeman had beaten up the son of a priest outside the temple. 

 The initial trouble ended following the intervention of some senior pandas but the matter did not end there as the police allegedly assaulted Gaywal panda Sanjay Kumar Kataryar. 

 Several pandas gathered outside the office of the lodging house committee, the statutory body responsible for the management of Pitra Paksha, and raised slogans against the district administration. Then they closed the gates of the temple, suspending the pindadan rituals.

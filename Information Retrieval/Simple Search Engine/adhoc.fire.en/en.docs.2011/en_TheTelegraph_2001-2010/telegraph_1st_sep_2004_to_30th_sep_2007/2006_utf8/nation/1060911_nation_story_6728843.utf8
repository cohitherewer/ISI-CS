The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Dr Singh, another degree from UK

 AMIT ROY

 Cambridge Calls

 London, Sept. 10: Cambridge 

 is to confer an honorary degree on Manmohan Singh, just 

 as Oxford did last year.

 He will receive a degree 

 of Doctor of Law on October 11, said a spokeswoman 

 for Cambridge University.

 Unlike Amitabh Bachchan, who received 

 an honorary degree from De Montfort University, Leicester, 

 earlier this summer, the Indian Prime Minister is entitled 

 to prefix his name with Dr.

 This is because in 1962, Singh 

 did his PhD from Nuffield College, Oxford.

 Singh described Oxford as ones 

 own alma mater in his speech on July 8 last year but 

 this should be regarded as mere politeness on his part. 

 If Punjab University, where he received his BA and MA in 

 1952 and 1954, respectively, is discounted, Cambridge can 

 claim to be his real alma mater.

 This is because he came to St 

 Johns College and got a first in economics. Singh 

 is currently an honorary fellow of St Johns, where 

 the most distinguished Indian is fellow economist Professor 

 Sir Partha Dasgupta.

 Normally, those who do PhDs have 

 to do an MA first. But since a Cambridge BA converts in 

 time to an MA without any extra work, Singh moved on to 

 Nuffield College, Oxford, where he got his PhD in 1962.

 The Oxford ceremony last year 

 was held a day after the suicide bombings in London. This 

 year, he is coming for the India-UK economic summit.

 Although much in Cambridge has 

 changed since he was an undergraduate here in the 1950s, 

 there is enough to remind him of the old days. 

 There has been a formal notice 

 about the honour beingconferred on him: Congregation 

 of the Regent House on Wednesday, 11 October 2006: Notice 

 7 August 2006.

 The Vice-Chancellor reminds 

 members of the University that an additional Congregation 

 will take place on Wednesday, 11 October 2006, at 11.15 

 am, at which the Chancellor will admit Dr MANMOHAN SINGH, 

 M.A., Prime Minister of India and Honorary Fellow of St 

 Johns College, to the degree of Doctor of Law, honoris 

 causa.

 His name is in capitals so that 

 it indicates he is a big shot or that he will, as a Prime 

 Minister, put a lot of lucrative contracts in Britains 

 way (though such sentiments are never publicly expressed).

 There are strict rules on dress 

 for the occasion but, after 800 years, the univer- sity 

 has not got a policy yet on turbans. The Indian Prime Minister, 

 however, should have a good time at the after-show party: 

 A reception for all those attending the Congregation 

 will be held afterwards. Refreshments will be served.

 One more thing: Prince Philip, 

 the Duke of Edinburgh, who is the Chancellor of Cambridge 

 University, will bestow the degree if he does not have anything 

 better to do.

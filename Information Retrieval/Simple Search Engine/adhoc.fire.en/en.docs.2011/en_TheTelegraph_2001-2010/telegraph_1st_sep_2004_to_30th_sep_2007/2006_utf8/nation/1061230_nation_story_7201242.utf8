 Fatal sex-politics mix

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, Dec 29: Kavita Chaudharys dangerous liaisons may have unfolded at a wrong time in election-bound Uttar Pradesh, but its not the first time that the mix of sex and politics has claimed a life in the heartland state.

 But unlike Kavita, who police said was killed by her partners-in-sleaze after a dispute over sharing their blackmail booty, not every death was the result of a young womans self-destructive appeal.

 Three years ago, a young poetess was silenced after she refused to abort her illegitimate foetus. A DNA test confirmed that former minister Amarmani Tripathi was the father of Madhumita Shuklas unborn child. Tripathi is now in jail.

 Womens activist Madhu Saran recalls that the murder was then described as a violent way to suppress illicit relationships between young women and powerful politicians.

 In the early nineties, a senior BJP leader was accused of rape. Twenty-two-year-old Kusum Misra said she was illegally confined in a house in Ayodhya. The case triggered a political furore but, a month later, Misra withdrew her complaint.

 After that, she has not been seen anywhere.

 The BJP leader had claimed the allegations were part of an attempt to smear his image as he was at the forefront of the temple movement.

 In the late eighties, badminton ace Syed Modi was murdered and a senior Congress politician was accused of conspiring with the shuttlers wife, Amita, also a national-level badminton player, to eliminate him. Both were later acquitted.

 When the Congress was in power in the seventies, one murder caused a commotion not only in Uttar Pradesh politics but also in Delhi.

 Shubha Lahiri, who came from a lower middle-class family and nursed political ambitions, was allegedly sexually exploited by power brokers. When her body was found in a drain in early 1974 behind a ministers bungalow, political circles were abuzz with speculation on who the murderer was.

 Today, after Kavitas murder, the heat is on chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadavs Samajwadi Party.

 The Samajwadi Party government is shielding ministers involved in the case, says S.P. Maurya, the chief of the Opposition BSPs legislative party.

 Advani dusts Ayodhya ties

 New Delhi, Nov. 29: L.K. Advani, the architect of the Ram Janmabhoomi movement, today revived his association with the upheaval, with an eye on next years Uttar Pradesh elections.

 The BJP leader said not once or twice, but thrice he was proud to have been at the forefront of the movement.

 His forceful assertions would gladden the hearts of the BJPs mentors in the RSS, who believe the party should not shy away from consolidating its influence among Hindus.

 I am proud to have taken active part in the Ram Janmabhoomi movement, but I deeply regret the demolition of the mosque, Advani said.

 The leader of the Opposition was retorting to the ruling UPAs charge that he had no right to question the governments political morality when he himself had continued to hold important offices in the NDA regime even after being chargesheeted in the Babri Masjid demolition case.

 Advani attacked the UPA government and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh for having given a cabinet berth to Shibu Soren, who is behind bars on the charge of murdering his secretary 12 years ago. We have heard about criminalisation of politics. This is criminalisation of the council of ministers, Advani said.

 His comments are being viewed in the context of the Uttar Pradesh Assembly polls that are drawing near. The Samajwadi Party is on the back foot, and its main adversary, the BJP, hopes to reclaim lost ground in a state that holds the key to power at the Centre.

 The party is keen to consolidate its Hindutva base and Advanis comments were aimed at boosting its efforts. I have never felt burdened because of my association with the Ram Janmabhoomi movement, the former BJP chief said.

 The UPA and its Left allies pounded Advani, clubbing the post-demolition riots with the murder of Sorens secretary. In the eye of law, both killings are similar whether you kill an individual or many people in a movement, said parliamentary affairs minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi.

 Advani pointed out that there was a difference between casualties in a political movement and a murder. He, however, added that it was customary for authorities to frame charges against the leaders of a political a movement who happen to become assertive. 

 The Left parties should be aware of this, Advani said.

 The remark prompted the CPMs Basudev Acharia and Gurudas Dasgupta to chorus: The devil should not quote from scriptures.

 A similar ruckus was witnessed in the Rajya Sabha, where the BJP members kept demanding that the Prime Minister explain to the House the circumstances under which Soren was re-inducted into the cabinet despite being chargesheeted for murder.

 As soon as the upper House met, leader of Opposition Jaswant Singh stood up and said: An unusual situation has arisen due to the conviction of a serving member of the Union cabinet for murder.

 Congress members protested, leading to slogan shouting from both sides.

 After 20 minutes of pandemonium, chairman Bhairon Singh Shekhawat ruled that the leader of the Opposition should be allowed to make his point and question hour would begin after that.

 Jaswant said the CBI, which prosecuted Soren, was directly under the Prime Minister and he should tell the nation whether he was not aware of the chargesheet against the former coal minister. Did he not know that a case was pending against Soren? the BJP leader asked.

 According to the CBI chargesheet, Jaswant reminded the House, the murder was a result of a dispute over the division of bribe received from a former Prime Minister. It is a very serious matter.

 Home minister Shivraj Patil got up from his seat to speak, but the BJPs insistence on a statement from the Prime Minister drowned him out.

 When Shekhawat directed that Patil be heard first, the home minister said Soren had given his resignation, which has been accepted, and the government was willing to debate on the issue. However, Patil made it clear that the debate should not just focus on Soren but also on previous such instances.

 The Opposition was not satisfied with the explanation, and the uproar that followed led to two disruptions and finally the adjournment of the Rajya Sabha for the day.

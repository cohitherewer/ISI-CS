 Study tracks mobile bacteria

 - Cellphones can be germ conduits

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Apr 12: Mobile phones might sometimes carry more than just conversation and messages. A new study suggests that mobile phones used by doctors and hospital workers could sometimes carry bacteria from hospitals out into the community.

 In a preliminary study, microbiologists at the Kasturba Medical College in Mangalore detected the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus on the hands of hospital staff and on the surfaces of a few randomly screened mobile phones brought inside the hospital.

 The researchers used sterile cotton swabs to sample mobile phones and the hands of healthcare professionals and were able to isolate the bacteria from 12 out of 30 mobile phones and 12 out of 30 hands they examined.

 Staphylococcus aureus is known to cause pneumonia and infections in the urinary tract and surgical wounds.

 Mobile phones may get contaminated through hands, said the study published in the latest issue of the journal Current Science. If used carelessly, contaminated hands or mobile phones might transmit the bacteria to vulnerable patients in the intensive care units or in surgical wards or carry them out into the community, it said.

 They are hardy bacteria and can survive up to 48 hours outside the human body, said Biranthabail Dhanashree, a microbiologist and the studys lead investigator. Regular hand washing by doctors and health staff after attending to patients could prevent this.

 Genetic analysis revealed a distinct relatedness among the bacteria isolated from the mobile phones and the hands of health professionals. The genetic profile of the bacteria isolated from patients was, however, totally different from that found on mobile phones and on the hands. This shows that despite contamination of hands and mobile phones, the bacteria were not transmitted to patients, Dhanashree said.

 She said there is no evidence yet that mobile phones are indeed carrying bacteria from hospitals into the community. To investigate that we need to examine the bacteria from the families of doctors and nurses.

 The study has attributed this to stringent hand-washing procedures before and after examination of patients. 

 The researchers said they had not found any study in India on the role of mobile phones in the transmission of hospital infections. Three years ago, a study in Israel had found that 12 per cent of mobile phones used by doctors or nurses carried a drug-resistant version of a species of bacteria that is known to be lethal to critically ill patients.

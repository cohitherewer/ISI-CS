 Farmers loot, cops look away

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Bhopal, Dec. 17: Farmers across Madhya Pradesh are rubbing their eyes in disbelief as police and the administration turn a blind eye to their urea looting spree.

 On Thursday, hundreds of farmers ran away with around 300 bags of urea in Ikara village of Datia district, which borders Uttar Pradesh, right under the nose of a handful of policemen.

 No FIR was lodged against the daylight robbery. Officials said their political masters have directed them against taking any action. 

 At least two dozen such cases have gone unnoticed.

 Madhya Pradesh is suffering from an acute urea shortage, but the ruling BJP is refusing to acknowledge it. The government seems to have discovered a way of avoiding a backlash from farmers by letting them have a free run.

 Last week, farmers in Ratlam, over 800 km south-west of Datia, had stopped a goods train and made away with urea bags. The Railway Protection Force (RPF) made a feeble attempt at law-keeping by booking eight farmers, when the actual number of culprits was said to be over 500. 

 The RPF had initially claimed a loss of 50-odd bags, but the Ratlam district administration put the figure to over 2,000.

 On Thursday, at Chepaner village in Harda district, farmers stormed a godown storing 3,000 bags of urea. Harda police said they have registered a case of theft against unnamed persons.

 State agriculture minister Chandrabhan Singh blamed the Centre for the urea scarcity and accused the Manmohan Singh regime of step-motherly treatment. We have sent several SOS but the central government is indifferent. Now we are told that some 45,000 metric tonnes of urea will arrive by nest week, Singh said.

 The urea crisis couldnt have come at a worse time for the BJP. On December 1, the state government had set kisan raths rolling. But the raths, carrying facilities ranging from crop insurance to seeds to farmers in far-flung areas, have run into rough weather. Farmers in Chinndwara district, for instance, boycotted them, saying they need fertilisers more than such facilities.

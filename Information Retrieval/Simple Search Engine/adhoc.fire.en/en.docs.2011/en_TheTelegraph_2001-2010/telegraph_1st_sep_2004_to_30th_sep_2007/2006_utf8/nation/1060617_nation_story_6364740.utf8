 Coke, heroin on Rahul

 New 

 Delhi, June 16: The Central Forensic Science Laboratory 

 today confirmed that heroin and cocaine was found on the 

 clothes of Rahul Mahajan and Bibek Moitra, validating what 

 the police have been saying for the past 10 days.

 There were traces of heroin and cocaine on the clothes of both Rahul and the deceased person (Bibek), a CFSL official said. 

 The official also confirmed that forensic tests on the residue from the stomach wash conducted by Apollo Hospital on Rahul (picture above) and Bibek had revealed the presence of cocaine, heroin (diacetylmorphine), codeine and alcohol (ethyl alcohol).

 The son and secretary of the late BJP leader Pramod Mahajan were rushed to Apollo on the night of June 1, but Bibek was dead before they reached. Bibeks viscera report had earlier revealed the presence of morphine, heroin, cocaine and alcohol, apart from caffeine. 

 The police had at that point charged Rahul and Sahil Zaroo, who was with them on June 1, under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act.

 Earlier in the day, Sahil dramatically broke down during his bail hearing, and accused the police of threatening his family to extract the statement they wanted from him. They threatened to kill my family and blow up my house if I didnt sign on the statement they wanted, he told additional sessions judge S.N. Gupta, before breaking into tears.

 Sahil said he had never confessed to having bought heroin and accused the police of falsely trying to implicate him by labelling him a drug peddler. He reminded the judge that the police had changed the drug quantity from 5 grams to 7 grams overnight.

 I was forced by the threats against my family to sign whatever papers they wanted me to sign.

 But the police produced cellphone records to show that Sahil had spoken 18 times in the week preceding June 1 to Abdulla, a Nigerian who is accused of supplying the drugs. They also pointed out that Sahil had fled Delhi the day after the incident. 

 The judge has reserved his ruling on the bail plea till Monday.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Sibal bats for varsities

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Kanpur, June 5: Higher education institutes unhappy at the new caste quota being imposed on them had some reason for cheer today with the Union science and technology minister advocating more freedom for universities.

 Speaking at the 38th convocation of IIT Kanpur, Kapil Sibal stressed that autonomy alone could guarantee excellence and innovation on campuses.

 The minister, who had burnt his fingers by speaking of a dilution of excellence in the first days of the current quota controversy, avoided any mention of reservations. But the issue was never far away.

 Outside the auditorium, students formed a human chain carrying placards criticising the Other Backward Classes quota and its architect, Union human resource development minister Arjun Singh. Inside, many wore badges carrying anti-reservation messages.

 If a nation wants to move ahead, the cradle for innovation has to be universities only, Sibal said.

 Young talents are the ones who drive faculty towards innovative brilliance. The more we allow freedom to the university system, the more autonomy is given to universities, we will have more innovations.

 He spoke of how the rapid growth in information technology had changed Indias image of the land of snake-charmers and elephants to one of a knowledge powerhouse. 

 But he also spoke of slipping standards.

 Technical education in India has expanded at a rate higher than anywhere else in the world, the minister said. As a result of this unbridled growth, the quality of education in many of these institutions has suffered.

 For instance, he said, engineering graduates from most of these institutes end up joining call centres, which is a loss of young talent.

 His comments came at a time when faculty in the countrys premier education institutions have expressed fears that the governments plan to increase seats to offset the loss to general category students would hit the quality of education.

 Sibal, though, stressed that there was wide scope for the young and talented in the country. More than 25,000 Indians from abroad have returned in the past three years to set up their own ventures here and they have been doing well, he said.

 Sibal had raised Arjuns hackles in April with his comments about dilution of excellence. As controversy broke out, he had quickly explained that he hadnt been referring to the OBC quota at all.

 The minister today dedicated to the nation a prototype development unit for cutting-edge Organic Display Technology at the Samtel Centre at IIT Kanpur.

 Earlier, institute director Sanjay G. Dhande awarded degrees to 936 students. The Presidents gold medal was awarded to two students, Abhinav Agrawal and Subodhjoy Gupta.

 PM not isolated, claims Cong

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 New Delhi, July 9: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is not as isolated in the Congress as some have made him out to be, party insiders said.

 Party leaders, who would not be quoted on the highly sensitive issue, underlined that the Singh-Sonia Gandhi equation remains as trusting and firm as it was in May 2004 when she chose him to be Prime Minister.

 Yes, Mrs Gandhi is unhappy with some policies and moves and, conversely, the PM may be unhappy with some of the partys responses. But the occasional mutual misgivings will not enlarge into a crisis because the Congress president cannot afford to create one, said a minister close to 10 Janpath. 

 If Sonia is consulted by Singh on policies, she makes it a point to brief him on organisational matters, including the recent changes in the partys media department. 

 The decision to put all divestments on hold was taken jointly by them once it looked like the DMK-controlled union in Nevyeli Lignite Corporation was spinning out of control and creating a serious power crisis for Tamil Nadu.

 Neither approved of the way some members of the media cell jumped the gun on the oil price rise and food imports and virtually pitted the party against the government. One reportedly lost his job. 

 Secondly, the sources said, there is no alternative to Singh. There is no way Sonia would want to step into his shoes, not after the Congress and she herself harped on tyaag (sacrifice). Nor will she want to rush her sons career, despite the occasional chorus of Rahul lao, desh bachao.

 So, if events reach a flashpoint and Singh wishes to quit or is compelled to, a mid-term election would be the only option. 

 The sources said if the Congress appears lackadaisical in putting its weight behind the Prime Minister and the government, it has more to do with the complex manner in which it functions than anyone wanting to score a point against Singh. Unless theres a nod or a word from 10 Janpath, nobody will utter anything, a source said. 

 Also, there is the growing feeling that unless there is a mid-course correction of the overt pro-reforms agenda, the Congress would go the NDAs India Shining way sooner rather than later. 

 So Arjun Singh demanding a quota for OBCs, Sonias interventions on price rise, the protest against Nalco divestment and even the murmurs against the nuclear deal echo the sense of urgency to bring the Congress back on the aam admi track.

 Some of the flag-waving results from personal agendas, the sources admitted. For instance, social justice minister Meira Kumars call for job reservation in the private sector is linked to her aspiration to reclaim the Dalit turf in Bihar. But because of the pro-people nature of such demands, it is tough for Sonia to junk them.

 Indian medicos to sue Blair govt for jobs

 London, May 30: Junior Indian doctors in Britain are to take the department of health and the home office to court because they say the rules have been changed retrospectively making it almost impossible to get jobs they believe were promised to them. 

 We have consulted a counsel who has told us we have a strong case, said Dr Ramesh Mehta, the president of the British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin (Bapio). 

 The two government departments, who were served legal notices on May 23, have 15 days to respond, after which Bapio can proceed with court action. In general, English law takes a dim view of the retrospective consequences of a change in the law. 

 Mehta said he hoped that thousands of junior doctors, who are in danger of finding themselves stranded in Britain, will be backed by the Indian government. 

 We hope the Government of India will take a keen interest, he said. 

 The Tony Blair government changed the rules on March 7, making it mandatory for overseas doctors to possess work permits before applying for jobs in the National Health Service (NHS). Such permits are not necessary for applicants from within the European Union, where there is free movement of labour. 

 The UK is still part of the Commonwealth but giving preference to the EU, thus treating people from the Commonwealth as second class citizens, complained Mehta. 

 Five hundred Indian doctors demonstrated in London on April 21, something that doctors do not do but the department of health and the home office are playing with peoples lives. 

 There have been stories about impoverished Indian doctors having to throw themselves at the mercy of Hindu temples in order to get a daily meal. Many are also reported to be living in very poor accommodation. 

 Mehta, who is himself a consultant based in Bedford, said the problem began four or five years ago when the health department appealed for doctors and nurses all over the world, without making it clear that the requirement was only for senior doctors. 

 Young doctors flooded in from India, taking out large loans or selling their property, to pay a minimum of ?5,000-?7,000 to finance their first years stay in the UK. 

 Having passed Part I of a test set by Plab (Professional and Linguistic Assessment Board) in India, they had to come to Britain to take its Part II. This was to demonstrate that not only were they medically qualified but that their accents would be intelligible to patients. 

 There are now an estimated 15,000 overseas medical graduates, mostly from India, working in part-time jobs in the NHS. There are another 5,000 who do not even have part-time jobs, said Mehta. 

 When those who have completed Part II of Plab apply for jobs, their applications go into a second pile, while preference is given to the first pile of applications from within the EU. If the jobs are filled, even if there are more meritorious candidates from among Indians, the second pile is tossed into the bin.

 The dilemma for the British government is that it has increased the number of students in its medical schools ? between 30 and 40 per cent of the intake is of British pupils of Indian origin ? so that it is feared that by 2009, there will be many more home-grown doctors than jobs. 

 Bapio has also sought to involve the Commission for Racial Equality as the Indian doctors feel they are victims of discrimination on grounds of colour, race and nationality. 

 Mehta accepts that the British government has the right to change the rules. But it did that without following the right procedure, he said. 

 The sudden implementation of this unjust ruling with no prior warning is causing immense distress to thousands of doctors and disrupting their careers, he pointed out. 

 Dr R. Lakshman, who advises Bapio, said: The NHS needs to recruit professional staff based on merit and not nationality to provide best service to the patients. 

 The new ruling undervalues the contribution made by doctors from the Commonwealth for decades and this has a demoralising effect on the workforce. There has been an outcry from all sectors of the medical establishment including the BMA (British Medical Association), the Royal Colleges and senior and junior members of the profession. 

 We are left with no option but to challenge it legally, commented Dr Satheesh Mathew, consultant paediatrician and secretary of the Bapios London division.

 Mumbai, April 5: Celebs will have a greater choice now.

 It looks like the White House done in shades of grey. Or more like the sprawling haveli in the film Mohabbatein, the school run by Amitabh Bachchan where the soul of Aishwarya Rai is afloat. But this grand building is called the Sharad Pawar International School, Pune.

 The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief and the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has lent his name to an upcoming school in Pune that has been built on 100 acres and on a corpus of Rs 70 crore.

 The school will cater to those who can afford to pay from Rs 1.5 lakh to Rs 3 lakh per year for a child.

 Mumbais millionaires and celebs, most of whom have sent their children to the Dhirubhai Ambani school, now have another address.

 The students will begin their day with the school anthem recorded by pop singer Shaan ? circulating as a snazzy CD ? based on a shloka from the Gita that establishes the primacy of knowledge, in designer uniforms created by Shaina N.C. There will be four sets of uniforms for different seasons, all having a sporty, international look, says the designer.

 The chemistry labs come with showers outside, just in case the students want to take it. The labs are situated on the third floor, with an inbuilt chimney, so that noxious fumes get lost immediately.

 Even the labs have LCD projection systems ? experiments can take place simultaneously while the lessons are being taught in class.

 The school has a nature park, a botanical garden and a water recycling plant. Classes start in June. Enrolment has begun.

 The school is a venture of the D.Y. Patil group, which explains what brings Pawar, the Union agriculture minister who draws his power from the sugar lobby in western Maharashtra, to a school.

 Pawar and D.Y. Patil, whose group owns about 140 institutions in the state, are close friends. The school dedicates a whole page in its brochure to Saheb, the name Pawar is addressed to by his followers. It is a privilege to name our school after such a legend, the tribute concludes.

 The Patil group says, with this project it is going for a full-fledged international venture for the first time, because the future is global. Pawar, who also knows the value of the future, has invested his blessings in it.

 It is also a growing market. The idea is to build a world citizen, says Ajeenkya Patil, managing director of the group. Students of Std XII will have to appear at the examination of the International Baccalaureate (IB) board, headquartered in Geneva.

 Taking the IB is becoming more common in India, with students having this certificate finding it easier to get admission in institutions abroad.

 About 20-odd institutions, some of which are new, including the Dhirubhai Ambani school, come under the IB board.

 Students will be taught in English. For second language, they can choose from Spanish, French, German, Hindi and Marathi.

 The school is not looking only at rich kids from the country. Many NRIs and foreigners are expected to send their children here, says Ajeenkya Patil. The number of foreign students in Indian schools is increasing.

 Countries like Malaysia send a lot of students here, he says.

 A significant section of the faculty, including the principal, has been recruited from Australia, which the group claims offers the best school teaching talent.

 Projects like his, says Ajeenkya Patil, will help Indian students to seamlessly become a part of the international culture once they graduate, unlike their several predecessors, who were bright and qualified, but had to take special training or undergo painful culture shocks before integrating with the environment abroad.

 Theres one fear. In its rush into the future, lets hope that the school doesnt always eliminate punctuation marks and case-sensitivity, as it does in the brochure. Sharad Pawar International School, Pune (sic) offers students superior opportunities in all fields of academic, sporting and co-curricular endeavour. Our International (sic) focus is a fine preparation for life in the 21st century.

 Jawans strip man on train

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, July 5: A passenger on the Guwahati-New Delhi Northeast Express was paraded naked by nine army jawans after he refused to vacate his seat for one of them on Monday night.

 As the train stopped at Barauni around 10.30, Parmatma Yadav, 35, a resident of Balia in Uttar Pradesh, ran out naked in fear of the jawans, who were trying to force him and other passengers out of the compartment.

 The jawans, who boarded the train at Katihar, 120 km from Barauni, and were on their way to New Delhi, asked passengers to vacate the compartment. When the passengers protested, the jawans, allegedly drunk, threatened to force all of them out when the train reached Barauni. Yadav, the most vocal among the protesters, bore the brunt of their anger.

 At Barauni, about 20 passengers complained to railway police that the jawans had also abused and thrashed some of them. Later, the nine ? Navraj Sharma, Rajendra Singh, Digvijay Singh, Mohd Imtiyaz Khan, Mandeep Singh, Hira Singh, Vijaypal Sant, Ram Singh and Shashipal ? were arrested and sent to a division jail at Begusarai.

 We will soon submit a detailed report to the railway ministry for further action against the jawans, Hajipur division public relations officer U.K. Jha said.

 Deputy inspector-general, railways, Ajay Kumar Verma said: We are gathering information on which units the jawans belong to. We will write to their units, which can decide if they will take disciplinary action against them.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Experts replay N-deal warning

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Aug. 14: On the eve of Independence Day, Indias top nuclear scientists have cautioned parliamentarians on the Indo-US nuclear deal, urging them not to compromise the nations right to exercise the nuclear option or allow any infringement on research in the nuclear field.

 In a statement issued just three days before Parliament is likely to discuss the nuclear deal, some of the biggest architects of Indias nuclear programme have also asked members of Parliament to protect indigenously built nuclear facilities and materials from external controls.

 They include three former chairmen of the Atomic Energy Commission Dr Homi Sethna, Dr M.R. Srinivasan, and Dr P.K. Iyengar former director of the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre Dr A.N. Prasad, former chairman of the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board Dr A. Gopalakrishnan, former managing directors of Nuclear Power Corporation Dr S.L. Kati and Dr Y.S.R. Prasad and former director of Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research Dr Placid Rodriguez.

 The scientists have described the July 18, 2005, agreement between Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and US President George W. Bush as a historic document, but said lawmakers in the US Congress have modified, both in letter and spirit, the implementation of such an agreement.

 India should continue to be able to hold on to her nuclear option as a strategic requirement in the real world that we live in, and in the ever changing complexity of the international political system. This means we cannot accede to any restraint in perpetuity on our freedom of action, they said.

 We have not done this for the last 40 years after the non-proliferation treaty came into being, and there is no reason why we should succumb to this now. While universal nuclear disarmament must be our ultimate aim, until we see the light at the end of the tunnel... we cannot accept any agreement in perpetuity, the scientists said.

 Their statement comes just over a fortnight after Singh assured in a statement in the Lok Sabha that the nuclear deal was in line with the Indo-US joint statement signed in July 2005. A day after his assurance, the US House of Representatives passed the US and India Nuclear Cooperation Promotion Act of 2006 with an overwhelming majority.

 of 359-68 votes.

 If the US Congress, in its wisdom, passed the bill in its present form, the product will become unacceptable to India, and diplomatically, it will be very difficult to change it later, the statement said, adding that Prime Minister had opened a dialogue with President Bush on the new clauses recommended by the US House of Representatives.

 The scientists have objected to the possibility of external control over indigenously built nuclear facilities and materials used in sensitive technological areas, and suggested that external control should be restricted only to facilities and materials imported from other countries.

 After 1974, when the major powers discontinued cooperation with us, we built our capability in many sensitive technological areas, which need not and should not now be subjected to external control. Safeguards are understandable where external assistance for nuclear materials or technologies are involved. We have agreed to this before and we can continue to agree to this in future too, but strictly restricted to those facilities and materials imported from external sources, the two-page statement said.

 The scientists also objected to Indias acceptance of any restrictions of its ability to conduct research and development in nuclear science and technology. 

 Stating that the Indo-US deal, as approved by the US House of Representatives, infringes on Indias freedom to carry out indigenous research and development, they said, our R amp;D should not be hampered by external supervision or by the need to satisfy any international body.

 Research and technology development are the sovereign rights of any nation. This is especially true when they concern strategic national defence and energy self-sufficiency, they said.

 They urged the parliamentarians to deliberate on these ground rules for the nuclear deal before the US Congress gives its assent, and the US President signs the bill, signifying a formal US consent to amend its laws to permit civil nuclear cooperation between the two countries.

 The scientists underlined the importance of the role of Parliament stating that though the sequence of actions to implement the deal could be left to the two governments, the parliamentarians had the right to set the basic principles of nuclear cooperation.

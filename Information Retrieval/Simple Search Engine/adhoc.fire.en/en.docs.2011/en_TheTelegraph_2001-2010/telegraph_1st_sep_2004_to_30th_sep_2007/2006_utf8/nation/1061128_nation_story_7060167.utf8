 Hostel suicides spook varsity

 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY

 Aligarh Muslim University

 Lucknow, Nov. 27: Campus suicides, common over the past few months in professional institutes like the IITs, have come to haunt Aligarh Muslim University (AMU), too.

 Three attempts, including two that resulted in deaths in the hostels of the university within a month, have rattled university authorities.

 Shahida Parveen gulped down mosquito repellents on November 20, less than an hour after meeting her brother. Luckily, her roommates raised an alarm and wheeled her into a private hospital nearby. She survived.

 Professors said she had been suffering bouts of depression. Psychiatrists are now counselling the 19-year-old second-year BA student from Sasaram in Bihar. 

 Unlike Shahida, death could not be averted for Ghanim Khan once hed called it. The first-year BSc student hanged himself from the ceiling of his hostel on November 15.

 No one understood why Ghanim, who classmates said had shown no signs of abnormal behaviour until that fateful evening, took the dire step. No suicide note was found.

 You can only guess why he did this. He wasnt a person who kept to himself. His friends praise his academic abilities, said Rahat Abrar, the university spokesperson.

 Ghanims father, a medical practitioner, reached Aligarh from the family home in Mau, but offered no clues as to the circumstances that could have driven his son to suicide.

 In the last week of October, a law student ended his life. University authorities blamed it on personal reasons.

 Students complain teaching standards at the university have made it tough for students from rural areas to cope with their studies. 

 We have found that these students, most of them from rural areas, are finding it difficult to adjust to the teaching standards, said Nafiz Ahmed, president of the AMU students union.

 Attendance norms, Ahmed claimed, have also led to anxiety. He says students are often unnecessarily penalised and barred from exams if they fall short on attendance.

 We are surprised at the sudden spurt of suicides and suicide bids. But the students explanation that strict attendance norms and high standards of teaching cause suicides cannot be the reasons, said Asmar Beg, in charge of students affairs at AMU

 Unlike IIT-Kanpur, the stress level among students is not uniform here. We run 92 departments, in which there are ordinary BA courses as well as professional programmes.

 However, if the suicides continue, the university might have to start counselling on a regular basis, he said.

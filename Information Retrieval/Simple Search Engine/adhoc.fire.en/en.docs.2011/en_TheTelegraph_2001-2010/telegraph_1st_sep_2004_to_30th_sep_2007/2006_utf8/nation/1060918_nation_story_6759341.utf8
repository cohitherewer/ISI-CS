 Stockpile in Chanderi

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Bhopal, Sept. 17: Police have recovered a huge cache of explosives from the sleepy Ashok Nagar district, otherwise famous for its exquisite Chanderi muslin industry.

 Senior officers at the Bhopal police headquarters, however, clarified that the explosives were meant for illegal mining and did not appear to have any link with terrorism.

 Ashok Nagar superintendent of police Ashok Gupta said: We got a tip-off that a huge cache of explosives has been stored. We raided the premises and recovered 17 boxes of gelatin sticks, 330 capsules of explosives, 4,000 detonators and 25 boxes of another type of explosives weighing 25 kg each.

 Gupta said Jitender Singh Chauhan was arrested while his accomplice Rajendra Singh Chauhan was absconding. The explosives were reportedly obtained from a factory in Ganj Basoda, near Bhopal.

 A case under the explosives act has been registered, he said.

 Ashok Nagar is located in the northeastern part of the Malwa plateau and shares its border with Uttar Pradesh. The police said illegal mining was rampant on both sides of border and enjoyed political patronage. The rocky area offers mining as a major source of employment.

 In Bhopal, police circles were intrigued how such a huge quantity of explosives could have been amassed in a seemingly obscure place like Ashok Nagar.

 A senior officer said according to rules, a permit was required to carry explosives for mining purposes. 

 But traders tended to avoid going to the district administration as permits were not generally given because of guidelines on not using explosives in densely populated areas.

 This January, two persons were arrested with 550 kg of explosives and 44 electronic detonators near Bhadon village of Ashok Nagar district.

 The police had chanced upon them during a routine check of vehicles. When a policeman tried to stop a Mahindra jeep, the driver attempted to flee. Sub-inspector Manoj Jha chased the jeep and stopped it after 200 metres. 

 The explosive nyojn 90 gel, used in stone mines, was neatly packed in 22 boxes with tags of a company from Royalgaon in Maharashtra. 

 Uranium scare

 Police seized a kilo of yellowish crystalline material, suspected to be uranium, in Berhampur on Thursday. 

 Tests have, however, revealed no traces of radioactivity in the substance, identified as resin by the Indian Rare Earth Laboratory. 

 Further tests are being done.

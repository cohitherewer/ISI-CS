 Call for joint study on India break-away 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 2: A team of French, Indian and Japanese scientists has proposed joint research to understand better how and when India broke away from Gondwanaland, the ancient supercontinent of the southern hemisphere.

 The proposal calls for joint studies of oceanic rocks in the Enderby Basin off Antarctica and will also draw significantly on data generated earlier by Indian scientists from the Bay of Bengal.

 The rocks beneath the Enderby Basin off the coast of Antarctica and the Bay of Bengal are believed to have been together before the breakup and scientists hope to combine studies of rocks from both basins to reconstruct their past.

 Several previous international studies have suggested that the breakup occurred between 120 million years and 135 million years ago. However, a 15-year-long research effort to study rocks in the Bay of Bengal by scientists at the National Institute of Oceanography (NIO) in Goa has been able to date the breakup to about 133.5 million years ago.

 Now, scientists from the Laboratory for Marine Geosciences in Paris, the NIO, the National Institute of Polar Research and Kobe University want to conduct similar geophysical studies in the Enderby Basin.

 The scientists want to conduct the studies during the International Polar Year 2007-08, using either French, Indian or Japanese research vessels. The polar year will be a global programme aimed at research on aspects of polar science sponsored by the International Council for Science.

 We expect to decipher the plate tectonic evolution of the Antarctica-India plate boundary... and improve significantly our knowledge of the structure and age of the Enderby Basin and the Bay of Bengal, they have said in their project proposal.

 The previous studies by NIO researchers initiated during the early 1990s had involved studying magnetic signatures in oceanic rocks in the Bay of Bengal. As the Earths magnetic field flip-flops every few million years, magnetic data gets recorded in rocks.

 The NIO data based on the magnetic signatures has indicated that India separated from the joint Antarctica and Australia about 133.5 million years ago. Australia separated much later ? about 95 million years ago.

 However, the existing data by itself is not sufficient. New studies in the Enderby Basin will allow us to complement the data from the Bay of Bengal and arrive at more precise models, said an Indian scientist.

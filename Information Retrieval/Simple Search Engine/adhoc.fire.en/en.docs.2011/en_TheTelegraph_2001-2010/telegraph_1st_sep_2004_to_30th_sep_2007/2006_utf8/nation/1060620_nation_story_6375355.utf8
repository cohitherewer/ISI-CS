 Investors first for friendly Buddha

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, June 19: The Bengal chief minister today said he had no choice but to offer land to investors where they want.

 The government, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee asserted in the Assembly, cannot dictate terms to entrepreneurs on where they should set up shop. 

 Can I tell them that I would not be able to give land at places where they would like to establish their units. I cannot do that. Investors coming to our state cannot be treated like that. Why do you think investors will go by my wishes? he asked.

 The Trinamul Congress had yesterday threatened a violent agitation to resist the takeover of farmland to make room for the Tatas small-car unit at Singur in Hooghly, about 40 km from Calcutta.

 Even a section of the CPM, state party secretary Biman Bose had hinted last evening, was not sure whether private companies should be allowed to hold large tracts of land. 

 We are still discussing various aspects of the issue that I cannot divulge now, Bose had said.

 Bhattacharjee today said: Our investor-friendly attitude has led to more than Rs 6,000 crore of investments in the current year.

 He added that he could not turn down Ratan Tatas request for a plot closer to Calcutta, though the government had initially chosen Kharagpur. After finalisation of the site at Kharagpur, Ratan Tata told me that he wanted the site to be close to Calcutta and requested if anything could be done. Can I tell Ratan Tata that I cannot accede to your request? Is this possible?

 The IT companies keen to set up units in the state, for example, consider Rajarhat an ideal destination. Can I tell them that it would not be possible to give land at Rajarhat? the chief minister asked.

 The transition from agri- culture to industry is an irre-versible process in keeping with the progress of civilisation, the chief minister said. We have ensured food security and we are not going to crush agriculture, but we need 40,000 acres and theyll be acquired safeguarding the interests of those being displaced.

 To the Opposition, Bhattacharjee said: Please dont oppose for the sake of opposing. If you want to know what sort of land is being offered to investors and the nature of projects that would come up, come to me and I will brief you.

 The social and economic condition of the people being evicted would be taken into consideration while finalising the compensation to be offered, he assured. 

 We will find out whether land belongs to below-poverty-line families, the extent of compensation they require, the prevailing price and whether jobs should be offered to the affected families.

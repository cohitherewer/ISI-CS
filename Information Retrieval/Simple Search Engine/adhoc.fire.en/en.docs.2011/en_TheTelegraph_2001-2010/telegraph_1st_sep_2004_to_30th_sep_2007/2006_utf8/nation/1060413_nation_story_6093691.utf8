 Man locks mother in kennel

 Thiruvananthapuram, April 12 (PTI): An old woman, allegedly locked in a kennel, was rescued by police, after neighbours heard her high-pitched wailing. 

 Sarada, a 68-year-old widow, was confined to the dog house yesterday by her son and daughter-in-law when they left for Attingal near here.

 The neighbours came to know of her condition around noon. Seeing her cooped up in the brick-and-concrete kennel, they informed the police, who broke open the gate to rescue her. She was taken to an old age home, the police said.

 The son and the daughter-in-law said she was put in the kennel to ensure that she did not venture out of the house. They claimed Sarada was mentally unsound and had tried to commit suicide earlier.

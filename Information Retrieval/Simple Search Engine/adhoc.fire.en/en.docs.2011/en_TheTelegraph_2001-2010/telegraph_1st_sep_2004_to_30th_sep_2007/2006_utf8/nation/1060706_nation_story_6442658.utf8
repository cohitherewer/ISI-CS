 Outraged BJP sees hand of Singh

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 5: The BJP today termed P. Venugopals ouster as undemocratic, illegal and unconstitutional and held the Prime Minister directly responsible for the tug-of-war between health minister Anbumani Ramadoss and the AIIMS director. 

 BJP deputy leader in the Lok Sabha V.K. Malhotra said his party would raise the issue in Parliament. Malhotra, also a member of the AIIMS governing body, was one of the three members who voted against Ramadosss proposal to oust Venugopal at the general body meeting (GBM) today.

 It is a black day in the history of the countrys premier medical institution, Malhotra said. It is not just the fact that a highly respected cardiologist was sacked without citing proper reasons, it is the way the health minister humiliated him out of spite that sends warning signals.

 According to him, the totally illegal proposal to sack Venugopal was not part of the agenda for the meeting. He claimed most participants were absolutely against the proposal and voiced dissent.

 It came as a bolt from the blue, he said.

 Malhotra, however, refused to name the members who spoke against the proposal. He alleged that despite the majority being against the proposal, only three chose to vote against it because Ramadoss bullied them.

 He bullied them by mentioning that his proposal had been cleared by the highest authority, which I took to mean that the Prime Minister himself had cleared it. But what happens to the autonomy of the institute if the PMs name is taken to bulldoze a proposal through? asked Malhotra. 

 HC notice to Centre

 Delhi High Court issued a notice to the Centre on a petition seeking dissolution of the governing body headed by Ramadoss. The matter will be heard again on August 24.

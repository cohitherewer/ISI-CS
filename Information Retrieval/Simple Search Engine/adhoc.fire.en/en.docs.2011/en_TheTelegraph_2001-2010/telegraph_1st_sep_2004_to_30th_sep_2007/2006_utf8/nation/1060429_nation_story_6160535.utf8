 Cong in spot on Natwar 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Natwar

 New Delhi, April 28: The Congress is mulling over the continuous outbursts of K. Natwar Singh, undecided on whether the former minister should be reined in through disciplinary action or mollified in some way as the oil-for-food scam noose tightens around his neck.

 Well-placed sources said Congress president Sonia Gandhi is likely to call a meeting of some senior leaders to take a call.

 Sending an emissary to try and placate Natwar seems the most preferred strategy as of now. 

 Yesterday, in a television interview, Natwar described himself as a victim of the Volcker controversy ? it claimed his external affairs ministers chair and his position in the Congress organisation. He said it was up to the Congress to make it clear that they are not involved.

 Asked why the leaks on the Volcker report referred only to him and not to the Congress, which was also named as a non-contractual beneficiary, he replied: It is extraordinary... there were two contracts... on the one side its me and the other is the Congress. The Congress party can make it clear that they are not involved. It is up to them. 

 Natwars veiled warning was construed by a section of the Congress as an indication he has evidence against the party and could speak out at a suitable time. 

 He was reportedly miffed with the cabinets decision to extend the tenure of the Pathak committee, which is probing the scam, by six months. 

 Sources said he had bargained for an early disposal of the case, perhaps even a clean chit for himself and his reinstatement in the government. None of that has happened.

 However, sources maintained that the former Union minister was not on firm ground if he wanted to implicate the Congress. 

 Sonia Gandhi would never have spoken out against him but for the fact that she had information of how he used the partys name to get his work done. She felt betrayed, the sources said.

 But there was a perception that he would be of nuisance value on which the Opposition would cash in during next months Parliament session. 

 The Samajwadi Party had sent feelers to him now that Natwar is out in the cold. But around that time, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh despatched a minister to suss up Natwars mood, after which he reportedly rebuffed the Samajwadi offer to come on board.

 Yesterday, in another interview, Natwar criticised the Indo-US nuclear deal as well as the governments policies on Iran and Nepal. 

 The Congress officially distanced itself from his statements, but given the mood of disquiet against the nuclear deal and Iran in the party, sources fear Natwar may become part of an anti-Manmohan nucleus.

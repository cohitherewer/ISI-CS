The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Green signal to blasts film

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 29: Saptami turned out to be a good Friday for Black Friday, with the Supreme Court ordering the commercial release of the Anurag Kashyap film based on the 1993 Bombay blasts.

 Mohammad Mushtaq Musa Tarani, an aide of key accused Tiger Memon, had successfully moved Bombay High Court and then the apex court seeking a stay on the release of the film, saying it would prejudice the public against the accused. The Tada courts verdict on Wednesday convicting Tarani gave some hope to the makers of Black Friday,which has been lying in the cans for the better part of two years.

 The verdict came in officially this afternoon. We are all very relieved and upbeat about the release now, Black Friday producer Arindam Mitra told The Telegraph. We will still have to wait till the judgment on the bomb blasts is over. That should take a month and we want to use that time to do all the groundwork required to release the movie. The film should hopefully hit theatres by the end of the year.

 Black Friday, featuring Kay Kay Menon and Pavan Malhotra among others, is based on a book by journalist S. Hussain Zaidi, narrating the sequence of events of the 1993 blasts, starting three days before the black Friday and finishing with the police cracking the case. 

 While the film by Anurag Kashyap whose first film Paanch, too, couldnt make it to the theatres didnt release in India, it got a great response at international film festivals like the ones in Locarno, Pusan and Hamburg.

 Mitra is convinced that rather than looking dated the film was completed in May 2004 Black Friday will be very topical. It is a modern day epic, he said. And as the market forces will agree, the next few months will be a good time to release the movie.

 Mumbai, July 6: A mob seething with anger burnt down a police station as more violence rocked Bhiwandi, a day after five people died in clashes between policemen and members of a community.

 Two of the five are policemen believed to have been lynched last night. Their bodies were found this morning.

 The rest died when police opened fire yesterday on demonstrators protesting against the construction of a police station next to a mosque in the Islampur area of the Thane textile town, 70 km from Mumbai.

 The government plot, set aside for the police, was being used as a cemetery.

 Residents say the mobs attack was in retaliation to the unprovoked police firing on peaceful protesters. The police say the assault was pre-planned and that local maulanas instigated the mob to march towards the construction site.

 They were equipped with iron rods and sticks, and began demolishing the only plinth on the site. Officers from Nizampura and Bhiwandi police stations rushed to the spot. The discussions between leaders and senior officials failed, and some people began pelting the officers with stones, said Ashok Dejbrata, DCP, Thane, who was hurt in the clashes.

 Another officer, DCP R.D. Shinde, lost his teeth and suffered severe facial injuries. He has been admitted to Mumbais Hinduja Hospital.

 The violence erupted when nearly 1,000 people had gathered for afternoon prayers at the Quadra Gate Masjid. The Rapid Action Force had to be called in to control the situation.

 The police say on June 23, members of the Bhiwandi Public Action Committee and the Raza Akadami, a socio-religious body working for welfare of minorities, led a rally to the municipal corporation to demand a stay order on the construction.

 But when the plea was rejected on July 4, the mob decided to take matters into their own hands. When we first decided to construct a police station there, we called members of all religious communities in the area, and discussed the issue with them. There was no dissent at the time, Dejbrata said.

 Thane police chief D. Sivandandan said the land was allotted to the police in 1920. In 1965, permission was given to build a police colony. But weve decided to build a police station, as the rains submerge the Nizampura police station every year.

 The state government has stalled the construction of the police station for the time being.

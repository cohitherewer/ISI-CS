The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 More trickle out of Sena

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Jan. 6: Rocked by rebellion and its morale at an all-time low, the Shiv Sena today suffered another setback after two more MLAs quit the party. 

 The Senas strength in Assembly has now been snipped to just three more than the BJPs, its alliance partner.

 The resignations come exactly three weeks after Bal Thackerays nephew Raj bade goodbye to the party, delivering the mightiest blow to the Sena in its 39-year-old history.

 The move, orchestrated by Narayan Rane who was the first to rock the Sena boat, was timed to perfection. Rane wants a slow death for mentor Bal Thackerays party and is making sure the shadow of gloom and uncertainty hanging over his Sainiks never shifts.

 Kalidas Kolambkar, the MLA from Naigaum constituency in central Mumbai, and Shyam Sawant from Shreevardhan in Raigad district put in their papers as the Sena is struggling to get back to its feet for a fresh round of bypolls on January 21. 

 Elections will be held to the three Assembly constituencies vacated by Ranes supporters who had resigned earlier. The trio ? Ganpatrao Kadam, Subhash Bane and Shankar Kambli ? are set to contest as Congress candidates.

 Rane had promised to increase the Congress strength by 10 when he joined the party with his loyalists.

 After submitting their resignations to Speaker Babasaheb Kupekar today, the duo joined the Congress as primary members in the presence of Rane and state party chief Prabha Rau. 

 The resignations have given Rane ? in high spirits since he got re-elected from the Malwan constituency in November 19 after beating Bal Thackerays son Uddhav ? another reason to cheer.

 He is confident that more Sena leaders would join the Congress in the days to come. Some MPs are also in touch with me, Rane said.

 The Sena tried to put up a brave front. The resignations have not surprised us. We knew that they were inevitable, its spokesperson and senior leader Subhash Desai said.

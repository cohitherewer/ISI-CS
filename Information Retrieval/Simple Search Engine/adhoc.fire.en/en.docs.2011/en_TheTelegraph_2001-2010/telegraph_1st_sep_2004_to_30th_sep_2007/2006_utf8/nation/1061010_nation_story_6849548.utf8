 A still from Lage Raho Munnabhai: Too tapori

 New Delhi, Oct. 9: As the nation is on a Gandhigiri trip, the Congress seems determined to purge the word from its lexicon. 

 The party purists are insistent that it should be replaced with Gandhiwaad (Gandhis philosophy), which sounds serious and authentic. 

 They made it clear that the centenary celebrations of the Mahatmas satyagraha would be bereft of any reference to the blockbuster Lage Raho Munnabhai, which spawned Gandhigiri, even if it sounded orthodox and boring. 

 Congress general secretary and Rajya Sabha MP Mohsina Kidwai was privately criticised in the party for advocating the tapori language used in the Sanjay Dutt-starrer at a meeting of the Congress Working Committee on September 10. She had reportedly said it was the right way of taking Gandhism to the next generation.

 Kidwai is also believed to have said that Gandhigiri encapsulated Gandhis thoughts, inspiring youngsters to read books by and on him, and that Lage Raho was a clean film that CWC members should watch. 

 Either we are Hindi illiterates or else its fashionable to praise tapori. But those who are doing the latter should listen very carefully to the dialogues again because they are full of filthy abuses, said a Congress general secretary. 

 In the heartland, he added, a campaign was on among youths to cleanse Hindi and purify it of the Bombayya slang. The projection of Gandhijis views in this tapori language has not gone down well in the Hindi-speaking states. 

 The general secretary also objected to the depiction of violence in Lage Raho. For instance, he said, in one scene the protagonist holds professors at gunpoint for answers in a radio quiz on Gandhi. 

 The film is a Mumbai dons version of Gandhi. The hero starts as a don and ends as one, was a Congress functionarys pronouncement.

 Leaders believe that the Mahatmas legacy as inherited by the Congress should not be sullied or trifled with by pop clones, sources said. 

 To restore the authentic spirit of Gandhism, the party will kickstart its satyagraha centenary celebrations with a conference in Gujarat and a cycle yatra from the Sabarmati ashram in Ahmedabad to Porbander, the Mahatmas birthplace. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Congress president Sonia Gandhi will launch the yatra.

 The Congress has also planned to set up camps to propagate the Gandhian ideals of panchayati raj and clean environment and to drive home the importance of khadi and village industries. 

 Gujarat will be the nucleus of the programme. The sources said the choice was dictated as much by political considerations as by the fact that Gandhi was born in the state. Gujarat goes to polls in November 2007 and the Congress believes the renewed interest in the Father of the Nation might yield a campaign and a counter to Narendra Modis politics of hate and divisiveness. 

 But it will be on our terms and not the film, a source said.

 New Delhi, July 22: Risks to lives of Indian soldiers on the Israel-Lebanon border are so high that India ? and/or the UN ? has to take a call immediately on whether to continue with the current deployment of the blue-helmets or pull out, a highly-placed defence source in New Delhi said today.

 There are 673 Indian soldiers on duty with the UN Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), part of a 1,900-troop-strong deployment that includes a battalion from Ghana. One Indian soldier was injured in Israeli shelling earlier this week.

 From the 121-km thin Blue Line on the Israel-Lebanon border, the deputy force commander of UNIFIL told The Telegraph on Friday night that there are risks of collateral damage because the Hizbollah fire from close to our (UNIFIL) positions at Israel and then there is retaliatory fire from the IDF (Israeli defence forces).

 An artillery shell landed close to the UNIFIL forward headquarters at Naqoura on the Mediterranean coast ? from where Brigadier Jai Prakash Nehra was speaking ? yesterday. 

 In the last 48 hours, at least three UN positions have been hit, either by the IDF or the Hizbollah.

 (PTI has reported from New York that Indias permanent representative to the UN, Nirupam Sen, said yesterday that as a major contributor to peacekeeping missions in the region, including the UNIFIL, India is concerned about the conditions under which peacekeepers in the conflict zone are required to perform their duties.)

 A UNIFIL source said the supply lines to troops manning the posts along the Blue Line ? so called to demarcate the border from which the Israelis withdrew in 2000 ? were now strained. But we have adequate stocks for several days, the source said.

 Brigadier Nehra said troops have been instructed not to venture out and to remain in bomb shelters. As of now, they are fine. Every soldier is also able to communicate home through our established communication lines. 

 He said the Indian soldiers of the 5 Sikh battalion group were battle-hardened from the many counter-insurgency assignments they have been on in the country.

 Typically, the IDF blames the Hizbollah for targeting UN positions and the Hizbollah blames the IDF. The fact is that soldiers from India are caught in the crossfire. And despite keeping their heads down in bunkers, they are running the risk to their lives.

 The troops of the Indian Army and the Ghana battalion man about 45 posts on the Israel-Lebanon border. Most Israeli incursions so far have been through the Ghanaian sector, including a firefight at Maroun Al Ras, the settlement that is also the battalion headquarters. 

 On July 12, the Hizbollah had made a foray into Israel and taken two Israeli soldiers hostage through this sector.

 India is usually reluctant to pull out of UN duties ? the exception in recent years has been from the UNAMSIL in Sierra Leone in 2002 ? but the risks are now getting closer to the unacceptably high category, the defence source in New Delhi said, particularly since Israeli defence forces began deploying troops on the border for what is looking like an imminent invasion of southern Lebanon.

 Another indication of the threat perception going up because of the imminence of the ground war is that most foreign navies engaged in evacuating their nationals from Beirut are trying to wind up and get out of the 60-nautical-mile by 60-nautical-mile war zone by Tuesday evening.

 The rush and the congestion has meant that the INS Brahmaputra has had to delay its entry into Beirut port because there was no berth available. Navy sources said they expect one of the ships from the Indian flotilla to find space tomorrow and leave by the evening.

 Israel has asked for all sailing in the war zone to be closed by 7.30 pm Beirut time.

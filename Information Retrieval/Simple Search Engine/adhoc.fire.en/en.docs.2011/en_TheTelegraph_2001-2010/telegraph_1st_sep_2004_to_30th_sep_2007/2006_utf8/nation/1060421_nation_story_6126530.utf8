 Probationers, laze at your peril

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 20: The Supreme Court has held that an employee on probation can be removed without any inquiry or procedure if he fails to improve despite his shortcomings being brought to his notice.

 The court said inquiry or procedure, as provided in service rules, is to be followed in cases of dismissal for misconduct and not on the ground of unsuitability.

 In January last year, the apex court had upheld the dismissal of an employee for sleeping during office hours.

 An in-house inquiry at the Pune-based Bharat Forge, where Uttam Manohar Nakate used to work as a helper, suggested that he was often found in a drunken state.

 A bench of Justices B.N. Srikrishna and L.S. Panta today clarified that merely writing down the charges in a letter of termination would not mean that the probationer has been removed for misconduct and, hence, an inquiry is mandatory.

 The court, however, agreed with an earlier judgment that it would be arbitrary to remove an employee on probation on the ground of unsuitability without giving him a chance to improve by making him aware of deficiencies in his work.

 Upholding the removal of an employee at a government research institute, the judges said the proba- tioner, who was working as an administrative officer, had been repeatedly told that his services were unsatisfactory in the areas of drive, initiative, promptness and leadership before being removed.

 The employee had challenged his removal, saying his termination was a stigmatic dismissal as serious misconduct had been alleged against him without carrying out any inquiry or following procedure.

 The apex court dismissed the employees petition challenging a high court order and said a termination order would not become stigmatic if it explicitly stated what was implicit in every order of termination of a probationer.

 Chandigarh, Feb. 21: An archaeological team in Haryana has stumbled upon a site in Rohtak which could turn out to be an urban settlement dating back to the Harrappan age.

 The discovery of the site happened by accident when a team of archaeologists from the Haryana Archaeology and Museums Department went to the village of Bedwa in Rohtak to examine a skeleton found there. 

 The skeleton could not be dated but seemed old. So the team, led by department assistant director J.S. Khatri, chose a few spots at Bedwa and its adjoining village of Farmana Khas, some 60-70 km from New Delhi, to do some digging. At one of the spots in Farmana Khas pieces of broken pottery were found. 

 The director of the Haryana Archaeology and Museums Department, S.N. Roy, was elated. He termed the discovery at Farmana Khas very significant. It was evident from the richness of the articles found at the spot that the settlement dated back to the civilisation that flourished in the Indus Valley around 2500 BC, he said. 

 But official confirmation is pending as the Archaeological Survey of India is yet to give its nod for excavations.

 The area where the settlement was discovered is popularly known as Daksh Khera. The site is spread over 32 ac- res and the ruins were bur- ied under a three-metre-high hillock.

 We have also stumbled upon another ancient city in Fatehabad, Roy said.

 The team of experts was led by department assistant director J.S. Khatri and included numismatic officer Madhav Acharya, assistant archaeologist Rajinder Singh Dahiya, chief draftsman Kali Ram and photographer Darbar Singh.

 The newly-discovered site is on land under cultivation. 

 The excavated city, Roy said, could have been located on the banks of the Yamuna. The river once flowed through Karnal and Indri in Haryana. Ancient ruins have also been found along the earlier course of the Yamuna at Sanoli in Uttar Pradesh. 

 To date, about 1,500 sites have been excavated in India and Pakistan that date back to the Harrappan civilisation. More than 500 such spots have been found along the rivers Indus, Jhelum, Ravi, Chenab, Beas and Sutlej and over 900 spots were excavated along the now non-existent river Saraswati and Drishadvati, its tributary. 

 It is the first city of the Harrappan civilisation found buried in Haryana. We will try to excavate the entire area if possible, Roy said. 

 A letter has been sent to the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) for permission to go on with the excavation. 

 It is a virgin site and needs to be preserved at the moment. And its best preservation is to let it remain buried till the experts arrive, he said. 

 It is not an easy job. Moreover, we do not have the expertise in carbon-dating methods. Only the ASI possesses this expertise, Roy said.

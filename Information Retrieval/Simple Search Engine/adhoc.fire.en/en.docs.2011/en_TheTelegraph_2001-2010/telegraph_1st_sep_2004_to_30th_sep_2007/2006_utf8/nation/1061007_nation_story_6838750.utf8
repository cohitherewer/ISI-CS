The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 20 lives, for powerless poles

 SANTOSH SINGH

 Koyli/Khutaha (Bhagalpur), 

 Oct. 6: The twin villages fight to get electricity 

 had quickly turned into a clash over who gets it first. 

 After 15 years, all that Koyli and Khutaha have to show 

 for their efforts are 25 poles without wires and 20 murders.

 The first killing happened soon after the administration decided to electrify the two Yadav-dominated villages, 7 km from Bhagalpur railway station and 225 km from Patna.

 The first set of poles were put up at Koyli in 1991. But in the dead of night, a group of youths from Khutaha crossed the nullah that separates the villages, uprooted the poles and carried them to their village.

 Koylis 2,500 people couldnt let the insult from 10,000-strong Khutaha pass. Ranjit Yadav, 25, of Koyli was the first victim of the gunfights that followed.

 Koyli got its revenge four years later: three from Khutaha were shot dead in August 1995.

 Since then, 16 more have been killed, said Khutaha headman Ravindra Yadav.

 As the battles raged, the electricity department kept away. So did the politicians.

 Although a police superintendent would arrive after every murder, no district magistrate or politician ever tried to bring peace. The Bhagalpur MLA and excise and prohibition minister, Sudha Srivastava, would not come even to ask for votes, said government engineer Subhash Yadav, whose family is among at least 50 that have shifted from the two villages to Bhagalpur to escape the violence.

 His 17-year-old son Alok, who has secured 76 per cent in his Class X exams, said: I feel embarrassed when people talk about my village with contempt.

 Manager Yadav of Khutaha said it was strange that the villagers, 70 per cent of whom are educated and many are soldiers, policemen, doctors or engineers are considered goondas and ruffians.

 The Khutaha headman, though, said an end to the wait for power was in sight: electrical wires would be installed from next month.

 Youths from both villages had together requested the authorities to set up the connections. 

 The peaceful panchayat elections (held three months ago) showed they are trying to forget their bloody past, said Bhagalpur district magistrate Vipin Kumar.

 Yet the truce forged for the sake of electricity barely hides the rancour. Ramesh Yadav of Koyli said: Hamare bich uthne baithne aur khanpan ka koi sambandh nahi hai (the residents of the two villages dont mix or dine with each other).

 He wasnt sure the fighting wouldnt resume once the power connections were set up.

 Koyli has lost 13 people while Khutaha has lost just seven. All but one of the 27 given life terms in 2001 for Ranjits murder are out on bail. There are still many scores to settle.

 Panel eye on ragging

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 27: The Supreme Court today asked the government to immediately form a committee, headed by former CBI director R.K. Raghavan, to suggest measures to tackle ragging in educational institutions in the country.

 A bench headed by Justice Arijit Pasayat asked the committee, which would also comprise three educationists, to submit its report in four months.

 Raghavan would be assisted by the director of IIT Kanpur, the director of Delhis Maulana Azad Medical College and the principal of Ramjas College, under Delhi University. The bench said the committee would also nominate two persons as members from Mumbai and Chennai.

 It was on directions issued by the same bench that a committee headed by former chief election commissioner J.M. Lyngdoh had come up with suggestions to cleanse students union elections by banning interference of political parties.

 The court noted that ragging had to be dealt with urgently as guidelines framed by it in an earlier judgment were not being followed. 

 Several students had lost their lives because of torture and harassment by seniors during ragging.

 The committee would not only focus on modalities to prevent ragging but also suggest stern action against guilty students and educational institutions where such incidents are reported.

 On a PIL by Vishwa Jagriti Mission in 2001, the Supreme Court had ordered that a varsity could consider disaffiliating a college or an institution if it failed to curb ragging. It also allowed the UGC to stop providing financial assistance to such institutions.

 Laying down a set of guidelines, the court had directed institutions to mention in the prospectus that ragging was banned and could be punished with expulsion, suspension or fine. Students and parents should also be made to sign an undertaking in this regard.

 The court had also ordered constitution of a committee of senior faculty members and hostel authorities to keep a watch on such activities and to promptly deal with violators.

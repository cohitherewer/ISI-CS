 Delhi for CBMs, Pak for solutions

 GAUTAM DATT

 New Delhi, Jan. 18: As the Indian and Pakistani foreign secretaries wound up their two-day talks, it was apparent at their separate news conferences what they had been grappling over.

 Shyam Saran spoke of new cross-border truck and bus services while Riaz Mohammad Khan harped on troop cuts, self-rule and definite solutions.

 Delhi said last years confidence-building measures (CBMs) and those in the pipeline were crucial to the larger search for peace and tranquillity in bilateral relations. It argued that political limitations on both sides prohibit redrawing of boundaries or territorial adjustments.

 Islamabad said CBMs were fine but what about a solution to Kashmir? Khan declared the peace process was entering a challenging phase as we should not learn to live with a problem but learn to resolve it.

 He indicated that the next round of talks would focus on finding definite solutions. The peace measures, he said, do not by themselves assure a rosy future. We have to do a lot more.

 Islamabad proposed troop reductions in Jammu and Kashmir. Saran said that if peace was maintained, the forces would automatically be pulled back. He also rejected the demand for self-rule, saying the Pakistani side must evolve a credible, electorally representative institution.

 Saran said Delhi wanted the international border and the Line of Control to become a frontier of peace and friendship; but for this to happen, cross-border terrorism and violence must end.

 The two sides agreed to an early start for the Poonch-Rawalkot bus and Muzaffarabad-Srinagar truck service, and hoped to repair the quake-ravaged Aman Setu by March. Delhi also recommended additional bus routes between Kargil and Skardu and between Jammu and Sialkot.

 Khan called on Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who made it clear that terrorism was a very critical issue for India.

 Singh said he was very keen to visit Pakistan when khan renewed President Pervez Musharrafs invitation. The Prime Minister said an appropriate occasion would be found for the visit but stressed that it should be substantive ? an oblique reference to the reason why India turned down an informal invite to Singh to be in Pakistan during the ongoing cricket series.

 At the media conference, Khan insisted that demilitarisation was needed for a final solution to the Kashmir issue, saying such a measure could be undertaken on both sides and the entire area be brought under a new dispensation.

 Khan also took the opportunity to allege that a coercive environment existed in Kashmir because of which militancy was taking place there and suggested reduction of troops in the state. 

 Demilitarisation can be on both sides and the entire area could be demilitarised in order to have a new dispensation which takes into account your (Indian) sensitivities, he said.

 Noting Indias assertion that there could be no redrawing of borders, Khan said Pakistan felt that there could be no solution based on the Line of Control. We have to take these things as a whole and then see what kind of an arrangement we can look into which are acceptable to all parties, he said.

 Pranab calms China jitters 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Pranab

 New Delhi, June 13: In the first official acknowledgement that India was lowering its threat perception from China, defence minister Pranab Mukherjee today said relations with Beijing were firmly on the peace path despite border disputes.

 Nobody is thinking in terms of an armed conflict, Mukherjee said at a briefing on his visit to China. 

 Asked specifically if he would agree with a statement that the threat perception from China is at its lowest, Mukherjee replied: Neither we are a threat to them nor are they a threat to us. Both countries think of living in peace. You can draw your own conclusion.

 Such an assessment in Delhi, if shared across the security establishment, can lead to a gradual but certain re-orientation of military priorities. 

 Indias strategic consciousness has through the decades been shaped by a threat perception from two fronts ? Pakistan and China. But it would be premature to expect Delhi to jettison its military programmes such as the strategic Agni III missile that is currently on hold.

 Mukherjees observation today is in dramatic contrast to the assessment of his predecessor, George Fernandes. As defence minister during the NDA regime, Fernandes observed shortly after the 1998 nuclear tests that India considers China its biggest threat. The remark led to a diplomatic row, though Fernandes subsequently diluted his opinion.

 Mukherjee visited Japan, China and Singapore from May 24 to June 4 but it was his engagements in Beijing that gave institutional shape to proposed military-to-military relations. 

 He said a memorandum of understanding that he has signed with his Chinese counterpart will lead to institutionalised military and defence exchanges, visits, training and exercises and an annual defence dialogue.

 Indias growing defence relationship with China is expected to contribute significantly to the maintenance of peace and tranquillity in the region and the world at large.

 India and China have been engaged in military confidence-building measures that have involved redeployment of heavy artillery from border areas for the last four years.

 Mukherjee said the dispute on Sikkims status was resolved last year and that trade through Nathu-la in Sikkim that was slated to begin by the end of this month was a certainty. The date would be fixed after technicalities such as establishment of customs posts are completed, he said.

 The defence minister said the border disagreements were still being debated but the talks at the level of special representatives were moving forward. It is not that we have been able to resolve all issues but there is substantial mutual understanding, he said.

 Quota row first round to IIMs

 ANIL BUDUR LULLA

 Bangalore, July 17: All the six Indian Institutes of Management, seeking more time to implement the reservation for Other Backward Class students, may finally have their way.

 Professor Samuel Paul, heading the core group on management of the Centre-appointed oversight committee, today made it clear that IIMs would not be able to implement the 27 per cent quota from the 2007-08 academic year as oversight committee chairman M. Veerappa Moily wants.

 Coming out after meeting IIM directors at IIM Bangalore, Paul said he was convinced that the institutes would not be able to implement the governments decision immediately because of severe faculty and infrastructure problems.

 They have asked for three to four years time to implement OBC quotas. I feel they have genuine problems, which cannot be set right overnight.

 This was the position taken by IIM directors earlier as well. The directors of the Bangalore and Indore institutes, seen as more vocal and critical of the reservation, were not invited to give their opinion before the core group at an earlier meeting, also held at IIM Bangalore, last month.

 Prof P.G. Apte, the director of IIM Bangalore, had told The Telegraph that merit would suffer if the B-schools had to implement the quota first mooted by HRD minister Arjun Singh.

 As the total number of seats could not be increased to offset the rise in intake of quota students, the number of merit seats would have to be slashed, the IIM director had said.

 Currently, there is a 22.5 per cent reservation in IIMs ? 15 per cent for Scheduled Castes and 7.5 per cent for Scheduled Tribes.

 Apte had also pointed out that IIMs, including Bangalore, did not have enough faculty and infrastructure. The quotas can only be implemented in a phased manner.

 Paul, a former IIM, Ahmedabad director, echoed him today. 

 I will take forward their view to the oversight committee, he said.

 All the six IIM directors attended todays meeting, sources said.

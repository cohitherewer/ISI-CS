 TEN in feed fight

 SUBHAJIT BANERJEE

 Calcutta, Jan. 7: With less than a week to go for the Lahore Test, TEN Sports is looking for a way out of the clause that makes it mandatory for broadcasters to share with Doordarshan cricket feed of all matches featuring India.

 The Dubai-based channel, which holds exclusive rights to the Pakistan series, has sent a proposal to the information and broadcasting ministry, offering different distribution models for cable and non-cable markets to protect its exclusivity and revenues.

 Our channel reaches almost 90 per cent of the cable and satellite market in the country. In these areas, viewers can watch the matches on TEN Sports. For those places where cable penetration is low, we can provide a separate feed to Doordarshan, an official said. 

 The ministry is likely to decide on the proposal by Monday.

 According to TEN, Doordarshans 300-400 low-power transmitters (LPT) serve remote and non-cable areas. We are willing to provide an encrypted signal to these LPTs and other non-cable markets that Doordarshan specifies, the TEN Sports official added.

 TEN has also informed the I amp;B ministry that it has put in place a team of 50 technicians and a set of decoder boxes for this purpose.

 I am not aware of this development but TEN had made a similar proposal before Bombay High Court. We are not willing to accept this offer because we think it is not technically feasible, said K.S. Sarma, CEO of Prasar Bharati, which runs Doordarshan.

 TEN had moved Bombay High Court against the must-share clause of the downlink guidelines issued last November. After the high court refused to stay the guidelines, TEN had approached the Supreme Court, where the matter is scheduled to come up for hearing on Monday.

 Another broadcaster, ESPN STAR Sports, has also moved court. It has approached Delhi High Court against the Centre on the issue.

 Brides family lynches groom

 ASHISH SINHA

Patna, Feb. 3: A Brahmin family today meted 

out medieval justice to their daughter and son-in-law for getting married despite 

belonging to the same gotra, or lineage, a union considered as sacrilegious 

as incest.

 Shailendra Mishra was stoned to death while wife Pushpanjali, who tried to come to his rescue, was beaten up. Unconscious, she is in critical condition at Patna Medical College and Hospital.

 Shailendra, in his thirties, used to frequent the house of Umesh Mishra to pick up lessons in astrology. He fell in love with Umeshs daughter Pushpanjali, in her early twenties, and a few days ago, the duo eloped and got married in Hajipur across the Ganga. Weddings in the same gotra, considered incest, are forbidden here.

 Umesh lodged a report with the local police that his daughter was missing. He gave her age as 16, aware that Shailendra could be framed for marrying an underage girl in case the need arose, a neighbour said.

 Their houses are a few hundred metres apart in the congested Khajkalan locality of Patna city. Shailendra, a graduate, taught in a school run by his elder brother. His father, a police inspector, died a few years ago. 

 When the girls family came to know about the couples whereabouts, Umesh sent a message to them, saying the situation at home was normal and they should come back. The unsuspecting couple returned to Patna last night. Both of them went to stay at their respective houses. But all hell broke loose in the morning, another neighbour said.

 Umesh, with his two sons, some relatives and friends, went to Shailendras house and called him. As soon as he stepped out, they started beating him with stones and sticks, while raining blows on him. They kept pushing him in the narrow lane while throwing stones at him. Hearing his cries, Pushpanjali came out of her house to save him, a witness said.

 But the mob did not stop thrashing Shailendra and targeted the girl as well. The man was finally pushed against a pole and hit by a huge stone.

 In the meantime, someone informed police. The duo was taken to hospital, where doctors declared Shailendra dead, the witness said.

 The police said the girls father has been arrested.

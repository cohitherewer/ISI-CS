over 30 trees uprooted

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta, April 24: A fierce Norwester lashed the city and its adjoining areas this evening, claiming eight lives and disrupting flights and suburban trains.

 Over 30 trees were uprooted in various parts of the city, including Beadon Street, Alipore Body Guard Lines, Hastings House, S.P. Mukherjee Road and Tollygunge, leaving home-bound traffic stranded. 

 Director of the weather section at the Alipore Regional Meteorological Centre G.C. Basu said the storm struck with a wind-speed of 109 km per hour in Alipore. At Dum Dum, the wind-speed was 76 kph.

 Along with the storm came rain a little before 7 pm. Till 8.30 pm, the Met office had recorded 19.9 mm of rain while Dum Dum recorded 26.2 mm.

 This is the first time a Norwester has struck with such velocity this season. The conditions are favourable. A thunderstorm is also possible tomorrow, Basu said.

 The storm gave the city relief from the scorching heat, though, bringing down the temperature by 9 degrees Celsius. In Dum Dum, the mercury dropped by 13 degrees.

 Two persons were killed when a tree collapsed on their Sumo near the district magistrates bungalow in Barasat in North 24-Parganas. The impact of the tree falling virtually flattened the car. The police had to extricate the mangled bodies from the car with great difficulty, said superintendent of police Praveen Kumar.

 In Behala, one person was electrocuted when an overhead electricity cable snapped and fell on him. 

 Lightning claimed the lives of two brothers in Durgapur. Milan Bouri (15) and Bodhan Bouri (16) were electrocuted, while five other members of their family were injured. 

 Another teenager, 17-year-old Manju Jadav, was electrocuted when lightning struck in Asansol. 

 Two middle-aged men were returning from work when a tree fell on them in Howrah. They died on the spot.

 While people were killed, air and rail traffic was crippled in the sudden storm. 

 Several domestic flights to and from the city were delayed, while some others were diverted. An Indian Airlines flight from Chennai was caught mid-air and had to go back. An airline spokesperson said the flight flew to Calcutta later. A Jet Airways flight from Mumbai, which was diverted to Nagpur, also returned later.

 Trains in the Sealdah-Dankuni, Barasat-Bongaon and the Howrah main line sections were the hardest hit.

 An official of Eastern Railways said train services from platforms six and seven of Howrah station went out of operation at 6.40 pm after a bamboo pole fell on an overhead wire and got entangled with the pantograph of the Serampore-Howrah local near the over-bridge just outside station.

 There was a power cut in Eastern Railways Sealdah division between 6.30 and 7.40 pm when trees fell on overhead wires. Overhead wires also snapped at BBD Bag and Bagbazar stations, stalling circular railway services.

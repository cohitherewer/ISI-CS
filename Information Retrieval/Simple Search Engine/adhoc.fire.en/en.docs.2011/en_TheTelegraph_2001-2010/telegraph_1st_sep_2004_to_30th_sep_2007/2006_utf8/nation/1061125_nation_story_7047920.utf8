 Heat amp; dust on Arunachal

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 24: Amid skirmishes in Parliament between the BJP and the Left over the Chinese ambassadors remark on Arunachal Pradesh, the government said the status of the state is not a debatable issue at all.

 By this it also meant there is no point bringing a resolution in Parliament as the BJP had demanded to affirm the status. 

 Let us not create a situation which will unnecessarily heighten the tension, external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee said, responding to the zero hour discussion in the Lok Sabha.

 Chinese ambassador Sun Yuxi had kicked off a controversy just ahead of President Hu Jintaos visit by reiterating in a media interview his countrys claim on the state. Although the government and all parties affirmed that the northeastern state is an integral part of India, the issue triggered sharp exchanges in both Houses.

 In the Rajya Sabha, when the government rejected the demand for a resolution on Arunachal, BJP MPs walked into the well accusing the UPA of mortgaging its foreign policy to the Left. 

 Leader of the Opposition L.K. Advani told the Lok Sabha that on the governments insistence he had delayed raising the matter in Parliament while Hu was in India. But that was on the condition that the House would affirm that Arunachal is a part of the country.

 Mukherjee said a similar Parliament resolution exists perhaps in a reference to the one adopted at the time of the 1962 war when Chinese troops had advanced into Arunachal territory.

 It is not necessary to raise the Arunachal issue in this format because it had already been dealt with at the highest level in the foreign ministry, he said, pointing out that he had countered the remark the day after it was made. Indias ambassador to Beijing has lodged a protest with China. It (Arunachal) is an integral part of India and continues to be so, he said.

 Mukherjee said he would make a statement on Hus visit in Parliament on Monday or Tuesday.

 In the Rajya Sabha, Suresh Pachouri, a minister of state for parliamentary affairs, took a similar line while tackling a strident Opposition led by former foreign minister Jaswant Singh. 

 Like all other parties, the CPI and the CPM condemned the Chinese ambassadors remarks but still managed to rub the BJP the wrong way.

 One such uproar took place in the Lok Sabha when the CPIs Gurudas Dasgupta said he did not take the ambassadors remarks as the opinion of the Chinese government. Dasgupta also cautioned against creating discord between India and China at a time when their friendship was growing.

 CPMs Mohammed Salim sparked another clash when he defended the use of the term dispute for the differences in the stand of the two countries. It was his partys stand, he said, that disputes had to be settled across the table.

 Advani said when the term disputed territory was not condoned while talking of Jammu and Kashmir, it was objectionable to use it for Arunachal.

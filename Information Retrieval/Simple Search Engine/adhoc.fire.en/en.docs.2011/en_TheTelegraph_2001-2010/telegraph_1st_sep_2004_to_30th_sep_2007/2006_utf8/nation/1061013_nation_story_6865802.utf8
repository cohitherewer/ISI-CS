The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Two Bookers, one Godwin

 AMIT ROY

 Roy, Desai: Common 

 agent 

 London, Oct. 12: After Kiran Desai and her mother, Anita, the person who will be happiest at the authors Booker win for The Inheritance of Loss will be her UK agent, David Godwin. 

 Can it be just a coincidence that Godwin, who happens to be in Mumbai today he is looking for Indian woman number three, joked his office - is also Arundhati Roys agent.

 We are delighted, said a girl at his London Office, David Godwin Associates. He is also the agent for the youngest Booker winner, Ben Okri (who won in 1991 with The Famished Road).

 From Mumbai, Godwin told The Telegraph, only half jokingly: I am looking for number three. Indias on a roll just now. If its not Amartya Sen, then its something else. I am here to spend some time with Brian Lara as we are publishing his autobiography.

 He said he had heard good things about the book from William Dalrymple and David Davidar. By the time the book came to me, Kiran already had an American agent. She lives in America. The book was apparently a lot longer but had been cut. I read the book and thought it was wonderful. You have to believe in a book.

 After Mumbai, Godwin intends to travel to Delhi to meet Roy.

 It has entered legend how back in 1996, Godwin, then struggling to set up an independent agency after leaving the employment of Gillon Aitken (who represents V.S. Naipaul), read Roys manuscript which had been sent to him by Pankaj Mishra and Tarun Tejpal, her friends in Delhi.

 Recognising he was on to a winner, he caught a plane the very next day to Delhi, banged on her door and demanded to represent her. Roy agreed, the manuscript was put up for auction in London, attracted a million pounds in rights and the rest is history. The night she won the Booker in 1997 changed Roys life and the literary landscape of India.

 Since then Godwin has been inundated with unsolicited manuscripts from India, many of them from women.

 One source said: David Godwin is a literary agent based in London, with a keen eye for quality and commonwealth literature - whatever these things are.

 He himself projects his firm thus: David Godwin Associates is a small literary agency representing around 100 authors of literary fiction and non-fiction, including Arundhati Roy, Jim Crace, Simon Armitage, William Dalrymple, Claire Tomalin, Ben Rice and Alan Warner. We offer a comprehensive service to our clients, selling UK, US, film and television, and translation rights across the world. DGA are now accepting postal submissions.

 He adds: Please note that we do not accept proposals for childrens books, science fiction, autobiographies, graphic and illustrated novels and we do not accept new submissions by email. Please assume that it will take at least three weeks for you to receive a response as we do not have a fulltime member of staff dealing with submissions.

 Meanwhile, Hamish Hamilton, which has published The Inheritance of Loss is coping with a flood of demands for interviews with Londons latest literary sensation.

 She is in Germany doing a tour but we would like her back in London, said a spokeswoman for Hamish Hamilton. Today we received 25 requests for interviews.

 Desai has given an interview to the Guardian, to be published tomorrow, in which she reveals that on the day that the Booker shortlist of six was announced, she left her apartment in Brooklyn and headed to the largest bookshop she knew. To the big Barnes and Noble (this stocks Musharrafs In the Line of Fire, however). And none of the books were there. Including my own.

 When her name was announced as the winner on Tuesday evening, she was shocked. I drank lots of champagne and then tried to sleep for three or four hours and didnt manage to.

 Her phone, she says, is full of messages from three continents and she has yet to even speak to her parents.

 She has not been able to contact her mother. I hope she has heard, says Desai. But shes living in a house without a phone.

 Desai, who is 35, lived in India until she was 14, when she and her mother left first for the UK and then for the US, where she has lived ever since. However, she still holds on to her Indian passport. Now I could become an American citizen, but then George Bush won and Ive just been unable to bring myself to do so, she explains. But again thats silly because of course I pay taxes there and dont vote, so its hypocritical in a way, but it held me back.

 Increasingly, too, she is unsure that she would really want to surrender her Indian citizenship. I feel less like doing it every year because I realise that I see everything through the lens of being Indian. Its not something that has gone away its something that has become stronger. As Ive got older, I have realised that I cant really write without that perspective.

 It was only when she began writing about the immigrant experience in New York that she realised she would have to return to India. And then, of course, I find myself at a disadvantage because India has changed, moved on. I go every year, yet it belongs to Indian authors living in India. The subject belongs to them. So the only way I could put this book together was to go back to the India of the 1980s, when I left.

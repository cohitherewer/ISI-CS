 Minority focus on progress, power

 New Delhi: Backed by the Sachar committee findings that Muslims in India lag on every economic and social index, Muslim activists feel it is time for the community to shift the terms of discourse from communalism and security to development and empowerment.

 With this in mind, the Delhi-based Movement for the Empowerment of Muslim India has convened a two-day seminar of Muslim NGOs from all over the country from Saturday.

 The seminar, to be attended by NGOs from different states, will discuss how Muslims can use enabling mechanisms like the RTI act, the Prime Ministers 15-point charter of action for minorities and the various welfare programmes sanctioned by the government.

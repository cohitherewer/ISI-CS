 At Cambridge, straight talk on G-word

 - Inclusive alma mater emboldens Singh to speak up for the poor

 Cambridge, Oct. 11: Displaying analytical depth, sensitivity and thoughtfulness, an elderly statesman returning to his alma mater looked back at achievements of the world economy since he had come for his Economics Tripos here 50 years ago and warned of the anxieties linked to the future.

 If ones eyes were shut, one could be forgiven for thinking that this was a Left-wing professor exploring the underbelly of economic globalisation.

 Globalisation, he pointed out, had failed to remove personal and regional disparities, increased the rural-urban divide as growth bypassed rural areas, increased insecurities about open markets among industrial workers as their real wages stagnated and increased the gap between the rich and the poor.

 This is nurturing divisive forces and putting pressure on the practice of democracy, he warned. This man was talking the language of the poor.

 His conclusion, perhaps no different from Prakash Karats and Sitaram Yechurys, was that there was no option but to make the process of globalisation inclusive.

 Could this person pointing to the downside of globalisation be the much-maligned Manmohan Singh, the father of globalisation in India and the preferred target of the CPM? His favourite light blue turban and gentle professorial air suggested that there was no mistaking the Prime Minister of India.

 It was befitting that the leader of a country that stands at the forefront of tomorrows technologies but perhaps also has the largest number of the worlds poor, marginalised by the march of globalisation, should talk the language of those he represents.

 The burden of Singhs address at St. Johns College, where he was conferred an LLD (Doctorate in Law honoris causa) in a colourful ceremony, was that there was an urgent need to remedy the new anxieties that globalisation has brought in its wake or else, the global system could be rendered ineffectual.

 Prosperity, ladies and gentlemen, is not divisible. Neither is global peace possible without the eradication of poverty, he declared.

 Why had he chosen to argue for inclusive globalisation at Cambridge? He had a disarming explanation.

 Before the First World War, a young man from Allahabad came up to Trinity via Harrow. After the Second War, a simple young Indian came to St. Johns from an obscure university in Punjab. Cambridge University embraced them both. This inclusive character of my alma mater emboldened me to speak to this august gathering about inclusive globalisation, he said.

 Singh, reviled in India for his advocacy of globalisation, suggested that the choice was no longer whether to be a part of the global economic system or not, but how to manage and distribute its gains equitably. 

 This inclusive vision of globalisation, he argued, must ensure that the gains of globalisation are more widely shared especially with the rural populations of the developing countries.

 This, Singh suggested, could be done by the developed world lowering trade barriers to export of agricultural goods from these countries. 

 The prosperity of so many cannot be sacrificed for protecting the interests of so few. The price of myopia is heavy on the exchequers of the developed world, he declared. 

 Trade, the Prime Minister said, should be seen not only as a means to prosperity, but also as peace building.

 He acknowledged the influence of Cambridge on him, naming the virtual pantheon of great twentieth century economists who influenced him Nicholas Caldor, Joan Robinson, Maurice Dobb, R.C.. Mathews and Piero Sraffa. 

 If Cambridge indeed taught him to be open to argument and fearless in expressing ones opinion, then indeed Manmohan Singh demonstrated that he had been a good student.

 It was fitting then for the university to refer to him, in the citation address conferring the honorary doctorate on him, in the words of the Greek poet Simonides as cool and calm, well aware of the justice that serves the state, and a man of healing virtue.

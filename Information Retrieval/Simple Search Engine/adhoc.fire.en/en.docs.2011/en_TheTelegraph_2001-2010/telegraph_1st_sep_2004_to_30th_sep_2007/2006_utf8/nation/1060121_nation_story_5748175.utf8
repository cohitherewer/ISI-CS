 Medicos, professor suspended in UP

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, Jan. 20: The Uttar Pradesh government has suspended 25 medicos and arrested an assistant professor for their alleged involvement in provoking medical students to stay away from work and indulging in violence in medical colleges.

 Dr Shafi Ahmed, the registrar of King George Medical College and Hospital (KGMCH), said Dr Anubhav Gupta was suspended for instigating medicos for rioting and holding demonstration. The other 24 doctors were placed under suspension for bad track records in their career.

 The governments action came after the strike in medical colleges across the state from January 16 following a clash between medicos and jawans of the Provincial Armed Constabulary (PAC) travelling on the Nauchandi Express in Moradabad the previous night.

 The government had yesterday invoked the Essential Services Maintenance Act (ESMA) and warned that if the medicos failed to return to duty by 10 am today, they would face legal action. The doctors, by and large, have given in. Some, however, were provoking (the others), said a senior professor of the medical college.

 The doctors have returned to duty. We are happy about their response to the decision of invoking ESMA, said the principal secretary, home, Aloke Sinha.

 Police had yesterday arrested Dr K.K. Singh, an assistant professor of the medical college, for alleged involvement in arson, making provocative speeches during a medical strike and another incident in which official records were destroyed by the medicos.

 Classes in the medical college have been suspended for a week. The college authorities have directed all medical students to vacate the college hostel and announced that allotment of accommodation would be done afresh to weed out unauthorised occupants.

 Dr Ahmed said the college administration would keep a strict watch on the students behaviour and, if needed, more medicos would be suspended.

 After 145 years, the friendly policeman

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 22: The Supreme Court today moved to reform Indias 145-year-old, Raj-created policing system to free it from political control and make it answerable to the public.

 The court ordered a police complaints authority set up in every district to probe complaints against officers and a watchdog called state security commission in every state to ensure governments didnt influence or pressure the force.

 The Centre must establish its own watchdog, a national security commission, for paramilitary forces like the CRPF, CISF and BSF.

 To curb politicians power to transfer upright officers, the court ordered a police establishment board set up to decide transfers, postings and promotions for officers below deputy superintendent. It fixed a minimum tenure of two years for station house officers and their juniors.

 Petitioner and former BSF chief Prakash Singh, who had fought for these changes for a decade, said the judgment is bound to change the working philosophy of Indian police who first served their colonial masters and later the political bosses.

 The order, setting up the first major reform of the force since the Indian Police Act was passed in 1861, will make the police people-friendly. Good and honest officers wont fear getting thrown out if they dont bend before political bosses, Singh said.

 To celebrity policewoman Kiran Bedi, the day is historic not only for police but also citizens of India.

 The Centre, states and Union territories must file compliance reports by January 3 next year. The order will stay in force even after the Centre frames a model police code on the recommendations of various committees. 

 The Centres code on a state subject like law and order can only be optional, but the states must obey the courts directives.

 Sharad jab at Nepal role

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 20: After the CPMs Sitaram Yechury, it is the turn of Janata Dal (United) president Sharad Yadav to play mediator in Nepal.

 Yadav feels he is the right person to correct Indias mistakes in Nepal as he shares a rapport with both the Maoists and the leaders of the Seven-Party Alliance (SPA). Babu Ram (Bhattarai) lived with me while he was studying. I know these people for very long, he said.

 The veteran socialists radical sympathies seemed to have suffered temporary damage when he was a minister in the NDA government.

 A number of Maoists in Delhi were held and handed over to the Nepalese Army while Yadav was in the cabinet. A virtual witch-hunt was launched and even Indian Maoist sympathisers Gautam Navlakha, an assistant editor with the Economic and Political Weekly, and senior journalist Anand Swarup Verma to name a few were arrested in the capital.

 However, he now seems keen to claim his past political leanings and reach out to his former friends. The Dal (U) president has just returned from Kathmandu, where he met almost all prominent leaders of the SPA and Maoists Prachanda and Bhattarai. 

 The ostensible purpose of the visit was a two-day conference on September 16 and 17 organised by the Mahendra Nidhi Memorial Foundation to celebrate the centenary of Mahatma Gandhis satyagraha.

 Besides Yadav, Dal (U) general secretary K.C. Tyagi, JNU professor Anand Kumar and former student-activist and general secretary of the South Asian Forum for Peoples Initiatives Sudheendra Bhadhoria attended the conference.

 But the more important deliberations took place on the sidelines.

 Yadav discussed the roadmap to peace and democracy with his old friends the Maoists, Nepal Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala, Madhav Nepal of the Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist Leninist) and former Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba.

 The Dal (U) chief expressed concern at New Delhis deliberate misunderstanding of its role in Kathmandu.

 Left pushes, Cong parries on nuke deal

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 31: The Centre and the Left are locked in a tug-of-war over the form in which Parliament should express its sense on the civil nuclear energy deal with Washington.

 Senior Congress leaders today said the government would not accept either a resolution or a substantive motion. What it may accept is a short discussion followed by a reply from the Prime Minister.

 The Left parties had originally demanded a House resolution laying down the parameters on the deal, thus tying the governments hands lest it buckle under US pressure and give away too much.

 The government, however, has virtually stymied the move by suggesting a resolution would destabilise it ? a possibility the Left is anxious to avoid.

 Yesterday, CPM general secretary Prakash Karat reiterated that Parliament must spell out how much room the Centre can have in negotiating the deal. The form in which the House will speak its mind, he said, will be decided by the Congress and the Left.

 Congress leaders say members of both Houses can seek clarifications on the Prime Ministers reply. Usually, clarifications are allowed only in the Rajya Sabha but as an exception, the Speaker can allow them in the Lok Sabha, too.

 In his reply, the Prime Minister will have to take care of the Lefts objections. The CPM has cited nine points in the US bill as a departure from the July 2005 agreement, and expects Manmohan Singh to spell out the parameters so that the deviations are corrected.

 The Prime Minister has twice assured Parliament that the government would not stray from the July accord. But the Left wants him to be more categorical, especially because the US Senate and Congress bills contain provisions it finds unacceptable.

 The Left wants the matter threshed out in the monsoon session, which ends on August 28, but the government prefers waiting for the final product (the final bill passed by the US Senate) to emerge.

 The Congress leadership, therefore, is in no hurry. It wants to talk to ruling alliance partners first.

 The Left and the government are also locked in battle over economic reforms, especially on the pension bill and the banking regulation bill.

 Left leaders today discussed the banking bill with defence minister Pranab Mukherjee, the leader of the Lok Sabha. The pension bill is slated for discussion on Wednesday.

 The government is keen to hurry the bills through but the Left has objections to both. The deadlock is likely to continue unless the Centre accepts the Lefts amendments to the pension bill and jettisons the move to privatise the pension fund.

 The Left also opposes the proposal in the banking bill to raise the cap on foreign banks shareholdings. Reform in the financial sector is a key issue on the governments agenda.

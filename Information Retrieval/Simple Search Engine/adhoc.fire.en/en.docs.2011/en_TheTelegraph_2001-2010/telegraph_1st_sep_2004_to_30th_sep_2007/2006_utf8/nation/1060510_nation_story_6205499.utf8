 Munda unfazed by cloud on MLAs

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Ranchi, May 9: Jharkhand chief minister Arjun Munda, who took the service flight to New Delhi today, will not hesitate to recommend dissolution of the Assembly, if necessary.

 Why should I be scared? asked Munda. Even if there is a fresh election, the BJP will return to power.

 Party sources claimed Munda does not yet feel any threat to the government, though the Supreme Courts dismissal yesterday of Jaya Bachchans petition, has cast a cloud on the fate of NDA legislators from the state, who have already been served notices by the Election Commission.

 The Supreme Court held that it is immaterial whether an MP or MLA actually draws any salary or perks from such offices. It is enough to disqualify them if the offices happen to be offices of profit.

 Apart from Munda, other BJP legislators like Sarayu Roy and Karia Munda and JD (U) MLA Kheeru Mahto are likely to be disqualified if it is proved that they hold offices of profit after their election to the Jharkhand Assembly.

 But Munda, whose official reason for visiting Delhi is to attend a condolence meeting in Pramod Mahajans memory, is said to be confident that all political parties will come together to make amendments in the law. 

 The Assembly has already passed such an amendment and forwarded it to Governor Syed Sibtey Razi.

 It would be difficult for the governor to return it to the Assembly, feel local BJP leaders, or even to sit over it, if Parliament passes similar amendments in the next few days.

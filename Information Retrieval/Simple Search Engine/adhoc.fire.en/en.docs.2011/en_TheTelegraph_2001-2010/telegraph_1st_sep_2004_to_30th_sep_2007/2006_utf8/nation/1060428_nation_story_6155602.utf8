 Indian denies Net threat to Bush

Washington (PTI): An Indian student in the 

US accused of posting violent messages on the Internet urging readers to kill 

President George W. Bush and his family has pleaded not guilty before a federal 

court but continues to be held in detention.

Vikram Buddhi, a 34-year-old graduate student of industrial 

engineering and a teaching assistant at Purdue University, has been arraigned 

on 11 criminal counts of threatening the President, the Vice-President, members 

of their families and defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld.

 Buddhi, who came to America from Mumbai on a student visa in 1996, entered a not guilty plea on all of the charges in the federal court in Hammond on Wednesday.

 According to local reports quoting his attorney John Martin, Buddhi tried to speak to the judge about his being held without bond but the judge would not allow him to speak. A trial date has been set for June 26.

 Riot cop gets Gujarat top job

Ahmedabad: Four years after his controversial 

role in the Gujarat riots as Ahmedabad police chief, P.C. Pande has been appointed 

the states director-general of police, reports our correspondent.

Pande, who was the police commissioner of Ahmedabad 

in 2002, were blamed for allowing the massacre of over 120 people at Gulbarg Society 

and Naroda-Patia. 

 His appointment has angered people like Tanvir Jafri, the son of Congress leader Ehsaan Jafri who was burnt alive along with 38 residents of Gulbarg Society. 

 Tanvir will move court as the appointment is like threatening riot victims. It is really ironical that the police officer responsible for the massacre is today the top cop in the state, Tanvir said. 

Rights activist Cedric Prakash said: It is a big let-down 

for those fighting for justice.

before handing him over to the police.

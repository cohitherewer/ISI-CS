 Shield for Bharti

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 14: Bharti Yadav, the key witness in the Nitish Katara murder case, will not be given a passport before she returns to India but she has been offered protection from detention and harassment.

 Sister of key accused Vikas and Vishal Yadav, Bharti is now in Britain but her passport is with the court. Police believe that Bharti, who was in a relationship with Nitish, was pressured by her influential family to flee the country.

 Bharti has been asked to appear in court by November 25 or be declared a proclaimed absconder. If she misses the deadline, the Interpol is likely to be approached.

 The court restrained investigating agencies from detaining or subjecting Bharti to any harassment. She will be in peace for the rest of her life if she speaks the truth, the court said, directing the foreign ministry to issue emergency travel documents.

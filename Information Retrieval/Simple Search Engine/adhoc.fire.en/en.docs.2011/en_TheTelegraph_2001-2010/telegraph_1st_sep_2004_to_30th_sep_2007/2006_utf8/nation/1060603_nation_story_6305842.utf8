 Scanner on masked calls to Bibek cell 

 VIVEK NAIR 

 Mumbai, 

 June 2: Bibek Moitra, the late Pramod Mahajans 

 secretary, is believed to have received several calls from 

 unidentified numbers yesterday and police investigations 

 are expected to focus on who these callers were.

 Calls from masked numbers or numbers that dont show up on cellphones despite the call line identification service either display a tag that reads private number or show a blank screen. 

 Telecom industry sources say the masking facility is extended to VIPs and this usually comprises politicians and celebrities. But they arent the only ones who get this privileged service. It is also extended to those who face a security threat. 

 So, what is the criteria that telecom companies adopt for extending such a facility? Some of the leading telecom service providers in the country indicate that it is almost impossible for ordinary persons to get this facility.

 We have laid out stringent criteria for giving this facility. Only VVIPs, celebrities or those facing a security threat can qualify. It is not given to anybody who wants it, says a spokesperson of one of the leading service providers.

 While some of the countrys leading politicians may not find it too difficult to get the facility, sources say, celebrities have to make a written application to the service provider stating why he or she needs the special service. 

 It may take around a month for the service to get activated. The customer is charged Rs 150 to Rs 200 extra, the spokesperson adds. 

 People who face a threat to their lives have to get a letter from a high-ranking police officer endorsing such a request.

 T.V. Ramachandran, director general of the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), says the facility isnt extended to many people in India unlike in the developed countries where anyone can ask for it. 

 Over there, revealing ones number could be seen as an invasion of ones privacy, he says. 

 Telecom industry mavens say the facility is restricted in India as they want to prevent its misuse. Proponents of the masked number facility argue that most fixed line telephones do not have a calling line identification and that it should be extended to all those who want it. 

 But the masked number facility doesnt mean that there is no record of the call. 

 All telecom service providers are required to maintain a record of all calls on their network for a period of about a month and are required to hand over these records to the police and other investigating authorities whenever required.

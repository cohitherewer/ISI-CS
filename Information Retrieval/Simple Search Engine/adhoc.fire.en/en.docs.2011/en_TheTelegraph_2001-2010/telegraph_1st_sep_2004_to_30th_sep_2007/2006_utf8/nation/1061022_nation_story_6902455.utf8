The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Rein-in plea to Lanka

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 21: India has advised the Sri Lankan government to exercise restraint in its offensive against Tamil rebels as it feels a surge in violence can jeopardise the peace talks scheduled to be held in Geneva next week.

 Delhi feels the LTTE has agreed to take part in the talks under international pressure, but Colombo should be careful not to escalate violence. Norwegian peace broker Jon Hanssen-Bauer flew to Delhi recently to apprise officials about the efforts to bring the two sides back to the negotiating table.

 India has been in touch with international players, who have intensified efforts to stop the island nation from slipping into chaos. US assistant secretary of state for South Asia Richard Boucher is in Colombo holding talks with authorities after a fresh wave of violence there. 

 Officials said India wants an immediate end to violence and resumption of talks. Concerns have been expressed at the recent attacks in which close to 100 Sri Lankan sailors were killed. The situation deteriorated after retaliatory action by Sri Lankan forces, Indian officials had said, advising Colombo to adopt a cautious approach.

 The officials were satisfied with the efforts made by the Sri Lankan government despite grave provocation by the Tamil Tigers. But at the same time, it wanted Colombo not to resort to retaliatory tactics that would push the Tamil Tigers to the wall. Delhi has feedback that talks will take place as scheduled. 

 India still has reservations about playing a proactive role in Sri Lankan affairs. Instead, it has thrown its weight behind Norwegian peace efforts. 

 Norwegian officials agree India is a key player in the region and it would play a major role in finding a solution to the ethnic problem. They said India might not have taken a proactive approach, but it was at the centre of international activities aimed at preventing escalation of violence. India is also in touch with the negotiators, with whom it shares feedback and suggestions. 

 Delhi is, however, not yet prepared to move away from its policy of cautious involvement in Lankan affairs, the officials said.

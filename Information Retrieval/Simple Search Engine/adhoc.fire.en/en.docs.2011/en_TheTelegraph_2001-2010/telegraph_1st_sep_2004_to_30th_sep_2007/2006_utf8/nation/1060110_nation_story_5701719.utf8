 Bachchan tax claim contested

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 9: The government today denied reports that actor Amitabh Bachchan was forced to clear tax dues while he was being taken to hospital.

 A finance ministry release said the Central Board of Direct Taxes had not issued instructions to any officer to collect the dues from Bachchan.

 The notices sent by the Mumbai income-tax department were issued on November 17 and 25. Bachchan was hospitalised on November 28.

 Officials said the notices were sent by speed mail and no officer tried to coerce him into paying up.

 Samajwadi Party leader Mulayam Singh Yadav had taken up the case with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, alleging that Bachchan was harassed by the tax officials while he was being hospitalised. During a recent interview, Bachchan quoted tax officials as telling him that they have orders from Delhi.

 Finance ministry officials said the proceedings for recovery had commenced in August 2005 and Bachchan had over three months (from the date of issue of the notice) to make the payments.

 The assessment years in question are 2001-02 and 2002-03. In 2001-02, after giving effect to the order of an income-tax appellate tribunal and credit for payments already made, the demand was reduced to Rs 2.80 crore. For 2002-03, against a total demand of Rs 18.15 crore, which is disputed before the tribunal, the demand was recalculated at Rs 4.12 crore, an official said.

 Cracker ban

 Mumbai, Oct. 5 (PTI): Bombay High Court today imposed a ban on the use of noise-making crackers after 10 pm while celebrating Diwali.

 According to Supreme Court rules, the state governments could relax the 10 pm limit for loudspeakers for a total of 15 days in a year. 

 But the high court today refused to grant the relaxation in case of crackers even during Diwali.

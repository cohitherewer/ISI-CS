 Cartoon minister to lead front

 New Delhi: The Uttar Pradesh minister who proposed a reward of Rs 51 crore for killing a Danish cartoonist caricaturing Prophet Mohammad is set to lead the Shahi Imams Muslim front in the state.

 As Haji Yaqoob Qureshi awaits an opportunity to quit the Mulayam ministry, his brother Yusuf Qureshi would be made president of the UP United Democratic Front (UPUDF), sources said on Saturday. 

 Yaqoob would take over command of the outfit a few months later.

 Yusuf would be formally declared the president at a public meeting organised by the front on July 5 at Lucknow, sources said.

 This was decided at a meeting the Qureshi brothers had with the Shahi Imam of Jama Masjid, Maulana Ahmad Bukhari, last week.

 The UPUDF, born out of some Muslim organisations efforts to replicate the Assam experiment in Uttar Pradesh, claims to provide a political platform to the community for next years Assembly polls.

 Kalpakkam aflutter over kite spy

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chennai, Sept. 17: Security 

 personnel at Kalpakkam went into a tizzy this evening when 

 they spotted a strange-looking kite fitted with a camera 

 bobbing in the skies a few km from the nuclear facility.

 Assuming that a spy of sorts was trying to click forbidden pictures of the facility from above, flying in a balloon, the securitymen immediately tipped off police, who set out to track the kite flier.

 The mystery man was soon found to be a French photographer, Nicholas, who was remotely operating a digital camera attached to the kite from atop the Old Light House in the tourist town of Mamallapuram, about 55 km from here.

 The kite-camera was in the skies above Mamallapuram and was trying to take sharp pictures of ancient monuments there. But it created an impression of drifting towards Kalpakkam (7 km away). This alerted the police and security personnel there, a police source in Kancheepuram said over phone.

 The police team that went to the tourist town seized the kite and the camera. They checked all frames but no pictures of the nuke facility were found, the source said.

 After enquiries, the police found that Nicholas was taking pictures for a tourism magazine and had the requisite permission from the Union tourism ministry.

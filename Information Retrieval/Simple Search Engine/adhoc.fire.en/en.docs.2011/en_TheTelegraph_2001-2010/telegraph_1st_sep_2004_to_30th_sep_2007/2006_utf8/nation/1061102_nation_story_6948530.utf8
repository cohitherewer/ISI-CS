 Rajnath set to keep crown

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Rajnath

 New Delhi, Nov. 1: Rajnath Singh is poised to continue as the BJP president but with a few variations in his current team of office-bearers, as the organisational elections in the party come to an end this month.

 Senior party leaders discussed the polls at Atal Bihari Vajpayees residence this morning. Almost everyone, except Jaswant Singh and M. Venkaiah Naidu, attended the core group meeting. L. K. Advani made up for his absence at the office-bearers meeting last week. Rajnath was there, as were Sanjay Joshi, Sushma Swaraj and others.

 The process of electing state presidents and members of the national council is over in 10 state units. The national council, with its 542 members excluding special invitees forms the electoral college that chooses the party president. The drill for Rajnaths election will begin only after 50 per cent of the national council polls are over.

 Party spokesperson Prakash Javdekar said 20 state units will elect their presidents in the next one week. After that, around November 10, the schedule for the party chiefs election will be announced. 

 The national council will then be convened for the poll that, by all indications, will allow Rajnath to stay on. The RSS wants him to continue, at least till the Uttar Pradesh elections early next year. 

 As is the case with Rajnath, the Sangh will dictate who occupies important positions in his new team. The most talked about changes will be made in the group of seven general secretaries, the partys think tank and, perhaps, its most-important office-bearers.

 The late Pramod Mahajan, Arun Jaitley, Ananth Kumar, Om Prakash Mathur, Thawar Chand Gehlot, Vinay Katiyar and Sanjay Joshi formed the general secretaries club among the outgoing office-bearers.

 Former Maharashtra chief minister Gopinath Munde is likely to fill in the slot vacated by Mahajan. Another new entrant could be L. Ganeshan from Tamil Nadu. 

 There is no question of Jaitley or Joshi being removed. However, the fates of Gehlot, Mathur and Kumar are less certain.

 The party has asked its senior leaders to talk to the state units where a new president is to be elected. In Madhya Pradesh, Satya Narain Jatiya was appointed president earlier this year. But the state leadership has been pushing for a change. Joshi has been deputed to consult state leaders on the matter.

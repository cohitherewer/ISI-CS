 Saas-bahus retreat before Beautiful Game

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Calcutta, June 19: Fifa is doing well on Indian television with its first matches. 

 TAM, the television rating agency, has come up with figures that show World Cup 2006 beat World Cup 2002 in India by a margin of millions on the opening day. 

 On June 9, the Beautiful Game on telly had 4.4 million watchers in the six metros ? New Delhi, Chennai, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Bangalore and Calcutta across all age groups as opposed to 2.4 million Indians in the six metros in 2002. 

 One of the reasons for this almost 83 per cent increase in reach could be the different viewing times, says TAM. Fifa 2006 is being aired during Indian primetime, which results in an increased audience base watching television, said the agency.

 The TAM figures, which are for the opening ceremony and first five matches, say that the Germany-Costa Rica match on the first day got the highest Indian viewership this time. 

 The match earned a TRP of almost 3.5, while the opening match during the last World Cup between France and Senegal had notched up 2.5. 

 The match between Trinidad and Sweden this tournament received the second viewership rank. But out of the first five matches in the two World Cups, three matches from Fifa 2002 received higher viewership. 

 The World Cup took its toll on the saas bahus. While sports channels increased their viewership from 2 per cent on June 8, one day before the World Cup, to 19 per cent on the opening day, Hindi general entertainment channels saw an 11 per cent decrease in their viewership. 

 ESPN, which is airing the game, saw a 33 per cent jump in unique viewers ? those who have never visited the channel before ? during the first two days of the World Cup. It meant an actual increase of 2.4 million viewers. 

 But TAM adds that there was 10 per cent less advertising in the first seven days compared to 2002, though ad volumes were higher on the first two days this time. Two more categories are being advertised now, but there are no common brands between 2002 and 2006.

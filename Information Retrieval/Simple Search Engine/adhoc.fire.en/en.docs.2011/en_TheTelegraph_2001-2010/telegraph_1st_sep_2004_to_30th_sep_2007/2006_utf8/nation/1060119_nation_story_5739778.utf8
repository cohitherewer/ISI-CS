 Out of dad shadow but a cloud hangs

 Bangalore, Jan. 18: H.D. Kumaraswamy, Deve Gowdas son now at the centre of the high-voltage power play in Karnataka, is an unlikely heir apparent.

 The 47-year-old has never held a ministerial position unlike his brother Revanna, the power and public works department minister in the Congress-led coalition.

 But neither inexperience nor reticence has prevented Kumaraswamys supporters from projecting him as the next chief minister.

 Kumaraswamy has seen at close quarters his fathers performance as Prime Minister and Gowdas humiliation at the hands of the Congress that ousted him from the helm of the United Front government. 

 Kumaraswamy was an MP representing Kanakapura in the same Lok Sabha when his father was Prime Minister.

 The sons move to publicly defy his father ? though not all are buying the feud theory in its entirety ? and ally with sworn-enemy BJP is being mainly seen in the context of both the parties not wanting an early election.

 Kumaraswamy, an MLA, also dabbles in films and is the president of the film producers body in the state. He is said to be a powerful player who calls the shots in the industry.

 Observers feel that Gowda let his son do the talking as the former Prime Minister still fancies himself as a secular third front leader and is reluctant to openly ally with the BJP.

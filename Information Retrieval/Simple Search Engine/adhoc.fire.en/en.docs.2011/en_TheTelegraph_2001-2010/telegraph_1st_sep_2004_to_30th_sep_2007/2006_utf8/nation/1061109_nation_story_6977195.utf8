 Delhi sees no threat in win of Democrats

 New Delhi, Nov. 8: Even after the Democrat victory in the US Congressional elections, there is strong confidence in the Indian government that the nuclear deal will go through by November 17.

 Democrats have traditionally been non-proliferation purists and many of them were extremely critical of the deal. With less than two weeks left of the lame-duck session of the US Congress, some would claim it is highly unlikely that a major decision will be taken before the new House meets in January. 

 But sections of the Indian government insisted the deal would go through, maintaining that the governments prime concern was not whether but when it would be passed. The governments confidence stems from two sources: one, the Democrats Prime Minister Manmohan Singh met in the recent past supported the deal and, two, the Senate verdict is too close to call, which means the Democrats would not enjoy free run of both the chambers.

 They have, of course, snatched the House of Representatives. 

 Sources said the three senior Democrats the Prime Minister met Madeleine Albright, the former secretary of state, Hillary Clinton and John Kerry expressed support. 

 Albright, who they pointed out, had opposed the Pokhran nuclear tests, went out of her way to praise the deal at a function organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry in September. She said the deal was an important sign of the new Indo-US relationship.

 There were no such public affirmations from Hillary.

 This morning, as the results were coming in, William S. Cohen, who served as secretary of defence under Bill Clinton from 1997 to 2001, met Singh and said it was critical for the US to back the deal. The Prime Minister has put his political reputation on the line and so has the President. Yes, we can survive without the deal but it will not go down well in the short term.

 I will tell my former colleagues (the Democrats) how the deal is important for the overall relationship, said Cohen, addressing a CII gathering today.

 Yesterday, US ambassador David Mulford called on foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee. Ministry sources said Mulford assured him there would be no problem with the passage of the deal because of the near consensus that was achieved in the existing Congress. 

 Sources said, ideally, India would like the deal to be passed in November because of Chinese President Hu Jintaos visit beginning November 20.

 They said if on November 17, the deal sails through, India could prove to China it has the US political establishments bipartisan support and, therefore, deal with it from a position of greater strength.

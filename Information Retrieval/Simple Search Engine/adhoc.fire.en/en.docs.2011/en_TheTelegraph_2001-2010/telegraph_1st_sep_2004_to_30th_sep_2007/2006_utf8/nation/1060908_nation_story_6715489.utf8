The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 DA boost for central staff

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Sept. 7: The 

 cabinet committee on economic affairs today showered a pre-Puja 

 bonanza on central government employees, doling out a 5 

 per cent hike in dearness allowance and unlocking wage arrears 

 of Rs 124.37 crore to employees of 15 sick state-run firms, 

 four of them from Calcutta.

 The salary dues from January 1 to June 30 this year will be fully paid, heavy industries minister Santosh Mohan Dev said after the committees meeting this evening.

 In Calcutta, the largesse will reach 15,902 employees of Andrew Yule, 1556 of Burn Standard, 3,178 of Hindustan Cables and 70 of National Instruments.

 Other PSUs where wage arrears will be cleared include Bharat Wagon Engineering in Patna, HMT (Machinery Tools) in Bangalore, HMT (Watches) in Bangalore, Hindustan Photo Films in Ooty, Instrumentation Limited in Kota, Nepa Limited in Nepanagar (Madhya Pradesh) and Triveni Structurals in Allahabad. The minister said the release of dues would motivate employees to improve productivity and help pave the way for reviving these firms.

 Gains from the hike in DA, which will cost the Centre Rs 1,858.15 crore this financial year, will flow to over 10 million central government employees and pensioners.

 This will enable central government employees and pensioners to get higher DA and dearness relief, respectively, an official spokesperson told reporters. The rate of DA and dearness relief from July 1 will go up from 24 per cent to 29 per cent, the spokesperson said.

 However, the increase failed to bring cheer to employees unions. The secretary-general of the Federation of Central Government Gazetted Officers Organisation, Rajesh Menon, said the 5 per cent hike was not enough. 

 The 5 per cent increase in dearness allowance and dearness relief is welcome, but there has been spiralling inflation during the last few months. We feel let down by this and the only way to move on a par with private sector employees is to quicken the pace of the Sixth Pay Commission, he said.

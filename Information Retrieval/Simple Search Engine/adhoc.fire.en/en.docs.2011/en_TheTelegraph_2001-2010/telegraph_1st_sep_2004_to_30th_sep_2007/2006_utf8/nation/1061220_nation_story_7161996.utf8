 Lalus team celebrates court win in House

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Sweet as a mango

 New Delhi, Dec. 19: Lalu Prasads MPs are dying to organise a victory rally or some kind of an organised celebration for the railway minister after he and his wife, Rabri Devi, were acquitted by a CBI court in the disproportionate assets case. 

 But RJD sources said Lalu Prasad has counselled restraint. So for the moment, his restive MPs allowed their good cheer to spill over on the floor of Parliament from the word go this morning. 

 Their sentiments were laced with acrimony especially when they confronted the BJP members. The RJDs chief whip, Ram Kirpal Yadav, threw the gauntlet at the BJP.

 During question hour in the Lok Sabha, he turned to the Opposition benches and alleged: These people have been spreading rumours about tainted ministers. What do they have to say now? 

 The BJPs Harin Pathak replied: This is just one case but there are several other criminal cases against him.

 Lalu Prasads presence was the spark the RJD needed to ignite the atmosphere. When the minister of state for commerce, Jairam Ramesh, was speaking on the export of mangoes, in walked the party chief. The RJD benches clapped loudly and were joined by some Congress members. 

 Jairam initially couldnt figure out what the commotion was all about till he spotted Lalu Prasad. He then said: But I thought the applause was for the quality of the mangoes. And while the BJP and RJD MPs continued to spar, Lalu Prasad took his seat. 

 As Jairam was about to start speaking on mangoes, Speaker Somnath Chatterjee commented: Anyway, mangoes are sweet and so is Laluji.

 However, Lalu Prasads problems may not be over. The CBI has decided to appeal against the acquittal in Patna High Court. But sources said they would prepare their case only after they secured a full copy of the order.

 The investigating agency has been vulnerable to political manipulation in the past. There is no reason to believe it will not happen this time, too, particularly as the Congress-led government will be in trouble as much as Lalu Prasad himself from an adverse ruling as it requires the RJDs support.

 But since the Supreme Court is monitoring the case, the option of dilly-dallying with the appeal is limited. 

 The BJP has said it has no intention of recanting on the tainted ministers campaign whose centrepiece is Lalu Prasad. The CBI has to get the law ministrys go-ahead before going in appeal.

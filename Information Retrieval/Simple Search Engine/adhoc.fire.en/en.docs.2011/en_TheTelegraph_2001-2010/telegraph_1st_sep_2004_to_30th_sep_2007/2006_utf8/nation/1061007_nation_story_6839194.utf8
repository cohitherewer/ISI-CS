 SC jolt to job plea 

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 6: Employees of a company taken over by a statutory body or corporation do not have the right to seek continuity of employment after the company is purchased, the Supreme Court has ruled.

 In the absence of any specific provision for absorption, the natural consequence of the takeover of an undertaking was termination of employment of its staff, a bench headed by Justice B.P. Singh said. 

 Also, the public sector company taking over another company or an institution has no liability towards the previous owners employees, the court said, dismissing an appeal by some workers of Futwah Phulwarisharif Gramya Vidyut Sahakari Samiti in Patna.

 The samiti was taken over by the Bihar State Electricity Board in 1997.

 The workers sought legal recourse after the board refused to absorb them. Over 225 employees of the samiti, which was engaged in supplying electricity to rural areas around Patna, lost their jobs. 

 The apex court, however, upheld the Patna High Court order and said the staff neither had a right to claim retrenchment compensation from the board nor had they the right to ask for employment.

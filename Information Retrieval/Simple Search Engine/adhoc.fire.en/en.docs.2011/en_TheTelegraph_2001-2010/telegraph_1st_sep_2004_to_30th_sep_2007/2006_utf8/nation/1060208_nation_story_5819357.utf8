 Gutka case

 New Delhi, Feb. 7 (PTI): The CBI has approached Mumbai police for sanction to prosecute gutka baron Manikchand Dhariwal, J.M. Joshi and Dawood Ibrahim under the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act in the gutka manufacturer-underworld nexus case.

 Sanction from an official of the rank of additional director-general of police or above is mandatory for prosecution under the crime act. 

 The CBI, which recently finished the year-long probe, has written to the police commissioner. 

 Dhariwal, Joshi and others have been accused of helping Dawood to carry on his gutka business in Pakistan.

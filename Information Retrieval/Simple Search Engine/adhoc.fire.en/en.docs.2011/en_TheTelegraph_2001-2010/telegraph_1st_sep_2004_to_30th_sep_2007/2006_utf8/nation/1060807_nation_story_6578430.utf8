 Cola ban call with a TV twist 

 JOHN MARY

 Thiruvananthapuram, Aug. 6: 

 The Left Democratic Front state committee has called for 

 a blanket ban on Coke and Pepsi in Kerala.

 A meeting of the committee, which took the decision today, was attended by chief minister V.S. Achuthanandan, CPM state secretary Pinarayi Vijayan and other senior leaders.

 Since the decision has come from the highest policy-making body of the front, it is likely that the state government will implement the ban. The weekly cabinet meeting on Wednesday is expected to take the decision.

 If the cabinet implements the recommendation, Kerala is likely to be the first state to apply a blanket ban on the cola giants.

 Such a ban is also expected to have a direct impact on the revenues of the CPM-backed Kairali channel which runs a weekly music programme with advertising support from Coke.

 The CPM, which heads the LDF, had earlier drawn flak for running an anti-Coke campaign but allowing its channel to accept the ad.

 LDF convener Vaikom Viswan said the findings by the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) had exposed the claim of the cola companies about the high quality of their products. 

 Until proved otherwise, the LDF preferred to believe the CSE conclusions that the beverages posed a threat to peoples health.

 The LDF has been running a campaign against Coke following the expose by BBCs Channel 4 on the presence of toxic cadmium in the sludge stored on the Plachimada Coke bottling plant premises in Palakkad district.

 The campaign, though more intense in the case of Coke, was also against Pepsi, which has a factory in the Kanjikode industrial belt in Palakkad.

 The Plachimada Coke plant has remained closed for over two years now following an agitation spearheaded by local tribals. Achuthanandan had, as the Opposition leader, led the campaign.

 The Coke factory had challenged in the high court legal hurdles posed by the local Perumatty panchayat committee. 

 The high court had granted conditional 

 permission to the plant to resume operations. But the panchayat, 

 whose licence is required, has not budged.

 Breather for Ulhasnagar

 Mumbai: Maharashtra governor S.M. Krishna has signed an ordinance to regularise illegal constructions in Ulhasnagar despite Bombay High Courts directive to demolish them, reports our special correspondent.

 The news sparked celebrations in Ulhasnagar as the 75,000-odd residents, facing the threat of being rendered homeless, heaved a collective sigh of relief. 

 On January 10, Krishna had returned the ordinance to the states law and judiciary department, seeking clarifications. Raj Bhavan sources said the governor had apparently questioned how an ordinance regularising illegal constructions could be promulgated when the high court was yet to finish hearing a public interest litigation on it.

 The high court on January 12 had pulled up the principal secretary (urban development) and Ulhasnagar municipal commissioner D.S. Patil for not obeying its order. 

 The Vilasrao Deshmukh cabinet went into a huddle after the courts strictures and the chief minister held parleys with Krishna and senior leaders in New Delhi before persuading the governor to sign on the dotted line.

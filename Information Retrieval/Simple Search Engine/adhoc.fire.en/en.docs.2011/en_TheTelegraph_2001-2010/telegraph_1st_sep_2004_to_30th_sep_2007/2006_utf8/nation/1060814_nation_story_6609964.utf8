 Break decorum, get the boot

 New Delhi, Aug. 13 (PTI): Rank indiscipline and breaking office decorum can cost you your job.

 Delhi High Court upheld the dismissal of about 15 employees of RPG Transmission, maintaining that workmen cannot hurl filthy abuses, vandalise the office and get away scot-free.

 Justice Shiv Narayan Dhingra dismissed the writ petition filed by the sacked employees challenging the industrial dispute tribunal ruling upholding dismissal orders passed by the management under Section 33(2) of the Industrial Disputes Act.

 The management alleged the employees led by the general secretary of the companys union, Jayanto Chatterjee, gheraoed Indrish Chandra, public relations head, to lodge their protest against a dispute. The employees allegedly abused Chandra and turned violent. They also broke office furniture besides threatening the official before police intervened.

 After an inquiry, the employees were dismissed from service and the decision was upheld by the tribunal.

 The employees moved the high court on the ground that principles of natural justice were not observed and the sacking was illegal since the dismissal was done during the pendency of an industrial dispute with the management.

 While noting that the management had conducted the inquiry in a fair and transparent manner, Dhingra felt that continuing with the services of such undisciplined employees would further vitiate the atmosphere in the organisation. 

 Asserting that such employees work as a catalyst to indiscipline, Dhingra said the punishment cannot be termed disproportionate to the gravity of the misconduct.

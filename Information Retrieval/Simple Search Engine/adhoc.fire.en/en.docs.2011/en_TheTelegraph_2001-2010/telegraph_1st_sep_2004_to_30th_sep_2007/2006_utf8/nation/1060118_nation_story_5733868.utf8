 Fourth arrest in phone-tap case

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 17: Delhi police are claiming the Amar Singh phone-tapping case is as good as solved after the arrest last night of a fourth person, Vijay Dhawan.

 Dhawan was the person who drafted official letters and forged signatures of principal secretary, home, of the Delhi government and the joint commissioner of Delhi police, Ranjit Narayan, the police said.

 Dhawan himself surrendered before Delhi police on Monday night as there was a lot of pressure on him due to constant police raids, joint commissioner of police (special branch) Karnal Singh Vijay said.

 Dhawan has been sent to three days police remand by additional chief metropolitan magistrate Kanwaljeet Arora.

 Earlier, Delhi police had arrested Bhupendra, the owner of a detective agency, Kuldeep Singh, an employee of Reliance Infocomm, and Anurag Singh, another private detective.

 Delhi police sources said various missing links had now fallen into place and the case was now clear. 

 Dhawan, a freelance surveillance detective, was a friend and conduit of Bhupendra and had been working for him for some time. Bhupendra introduced him to Kuldeep and the trio hatched the plan to tap Amars phone.

 The sole motive was to blackmail him and make money, the police sources said.

 The police are, however, looking for a fifth person in Dehra Dun to whom Dhawan is believed to have delivered some documents related to the case.

 Demon in Dhruvs tail: expired adhesive

 ANIL BUDUR LULLA

 Dhruv helicopters

 Bangalore, March 27: The tail rotor blade snag of advanced light helicopter Dhruv has been traced to an imported resin and adhesive material that was used after its expiry date.

 Sources at Hindustan Aeronautics Limited, which manufactures the chopper, revealed the material had been imported from a Swiss company years ago and used by fabricators in spite of it having crossed the best-before date.

 The issue came under glare after a Dhruv crash-landed in Hyderabad three months ago because of a tail rotor blade failure. HAL had then grounded its entire fleet as a precaution.

 The sources claimed HAL had not been able to contact the Swiss company to check if the materials shelf life could be extended as it had closed down by then. But that did not stop HAL from using the material.

 Questions are being raised on why HAL slipped up despite its stringent quality control standards. It puts a question mark on the quality control on which we pride ourselves, an officer said.

 A tail rotor is integral to a copter and enables it to fly straight and manoeuvre freely. If the rotor fails, the copter will suffer severe vibrations and even crash as it did in Hyderabad.

 Apart from grounding the fleet, HAL had then recalled all tail rotor blades for thorough inspection. Those made from the defective material were destroyed.

 HAL has also begun testing a new tail rotor blade made with material sourced from a Chennai manufacturer. It has been flown for over 100 hours, but some tests remain to be done.

 Sources said once the tests ? both ground and fatigue testing (how long the blades can run continuously) ? are over, the blades would be fitted onto IAF and navy choppers.

 As of now, only army and HAL test pilots have resumed flying the choppers. The air force, navy, coast guard and the Nepal army have kept them on hold although a board of inquiry has cleared the choppers.

 As blade-making is an elaborate and delicate process, HAL makes only nine a month. There are 44 Dhruvs in service and 18 are being built this year.

 New blades will be first fitted onto those Dhruvs that are being manufactured. By May, we will have enough numbers to replace those already flying, a source said.

 We have a plan to replace all tail rotor blades of helicopters in service as the new blade has a tighter control.

 HAL has defended its decision to ground its fleet saying it was necessary in the interests of safety. The sources said the company saw the tail rotor failure as a blessing in disguise.

 Dhruvs have flown only 12,000 hours so far and have been tested extensively for over 2,500 hours. If the problem had occurred a few years down the line when hundreds of choppers would be flying, it would have been very embarrassing, a source said.

 Tail rotors of new entrants in the global aeronautical market have had similar teething problems. The Apaches flown by the Royal Air Force were grounded for many months.

 Even now, Bell 206 is not cleared to fly over two hours at a stretch and users are advised to check the tail rotor after every flight.

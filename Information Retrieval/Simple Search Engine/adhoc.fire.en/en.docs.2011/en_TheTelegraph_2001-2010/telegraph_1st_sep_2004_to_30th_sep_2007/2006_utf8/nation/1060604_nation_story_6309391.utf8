 Trio sticks to cocaine story

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 3: Rahul Mahajans medical report did not find any significant trace of cocaine and Sahil Ahmad Zaroo denied having bought the drug, but the three Delhi boys who surrendered last night are sticking to their statement before police.

 According to the sequence of events recounted by childhood friends Rahul Malhotra, Karan Ahuja and Trishay Khanna, they had gone to 7, Safdarjung Road with Sahil on Thursday night where Bibek Moitra asked them to fetch cocaine. 

 The boys said Sahil, whom Rahul Malhotra knew, procured the drug and they accompanied him to the peddler in Vasant Vihar. 

 Their lawyer Viraj Dattar said the boys were witnesses and were not responsible for what happened. They were advised to surrender as they had done no wrong, he added. 

 After buying the cocaine, Rahul was driven back to Greater Kailash, where all three live, because he was not feeling well. The others returned to Rahul Mahajans house and consumed the drug with Bibek.

 When they were driving back home, Sahil developed symptoms of distress and was rushed to Spring Meadows hospital in south Delhi where he recovered after emergency treatment.

 Sahil and Trishay drove back to Rahul Mahajans house to find him and Bibek unconscious. The lawyer said the boys alerted the servants and advised them to take the two to hospital but did not accompany them as was stated earlier.

 (The servants version is different. They have told police that they took Rahul Mahajan and Bibek to hospital long after the visitors had left.)

 The legal course the boys plan will depend on the police investigation. The FIR lodged in the case does not name them as suspects.

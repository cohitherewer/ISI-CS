 Rs 50,000 fine for Rs 34 mineral water

 New Delhi, Nov. 9 (PTI): The Delhi consumer commission has asked a restaurant to pay Rs 50,000 to a customer after finding it guilty of selling a bottle of mineral water much above its maximum retail price.

 The restaurant had charged Hemant Goel, a resident of Gagan Vihar, Rs 34 for the bottle whose MRP was Rs 12.

 The very connotation of printed price on the packaged or sealed goods, namely MRP, leaves no scope of doubt that in no circumstances, price shall be more than the maximum retail price...said Justice J.D. Kapoor, president of the commission, holding Zaika Bazar, a Delhi restaurant, guilty of unfair trade practices.

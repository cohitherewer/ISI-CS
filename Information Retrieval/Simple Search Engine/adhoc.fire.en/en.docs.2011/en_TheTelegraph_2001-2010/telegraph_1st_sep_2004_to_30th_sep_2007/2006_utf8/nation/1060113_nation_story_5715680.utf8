 Bofors booms, Left and Right

 - BJP turns gun on Singh 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 12: The Bofors demon returned to haunt the Congress today with the Left as well as the BJP asking the Centre to explain why it told British authorities that the gun kickbacks could not be linked to Ottavio Quattrocchis bank accounts.

 The CPM found the governments move questionable while the BJP linked the money to Sonia Gandhi and laid a trap for the sensitive Manmohan Singh by appearing to question his clean image.

 Adding to the governments troubles is a petition filed by an advocate, Ajay Aggarwal, in the Supreme Court challenging the Centres clean chit to Quattrocchi.

 Aggarwal wants additional solicitor-general B. Dutta asked who had instructed him to convey this to Londons Crown Prosecution Service (hired by the CBI to fight the Bofors case), which has passed it on to a British high court.

 BJP leader Arun Jaitley tried to direct suspicion towards the Congress chief. He suggested she was the eventual beneficiary of the money stashed in the Italian businessmans bank accounts, and that this was why the government wanted it defreezed.

 Jaitley also tried to bait the Prime Minister by asking him if the request was made with his knowledge and agreement. Does this decision have the approval of the Prime Minister, or are we going to hear later from the PMO that he was hurt by the whole scandal? Jaitley asked.

 So we should get it cleared right from the start ? does this tinkering with the judicial process to help a man who caused losses to the government have the PMOs nod?

 Jaitley alleged the Centres unseemly haste in ensuring that Quattrocchi gets access to his accounts ? reportedly containing 3 million euros and $1 million ? had only one explanation. The money was ultimately going to be passed on to somebody else.

 Who is this person for whom the Government of India is willing to commit political suicide? Jaitley asked. This persons association with the Gandhi family is not a state secret.

 Officially, the Congress kept mum with its leaders trying to dismiss the scandal as old hat, but there seemed to be a nagging worry: how would Manmohan Singh react? 

 The Prime Minister is not comfortable dealing with political scandals, a party leader said.

 For the Congress, its the Lefts reaction that could be more important. The CPM politburo was quick to issue a statement demanding an explanation.

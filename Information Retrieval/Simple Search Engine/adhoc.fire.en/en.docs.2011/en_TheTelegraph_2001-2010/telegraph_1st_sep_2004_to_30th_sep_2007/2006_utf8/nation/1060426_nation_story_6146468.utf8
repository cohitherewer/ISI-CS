Kathmandu, April 25: The reinstated parliament in Nepal is likely to withdraw on the first day itself the red-corner notices against Maoists, remove the epithet terrorist used against them and withdraw the dreaded Tado, the Terrorist and Destructive Activities (Control and Punishment) Ordinance.

 The announcement of a Constituent Assembly should be the first step of the reconstituted Parliament, said Madhav Nepal of the Nepal Communist Party ? United Marxist Leninist.

 Would there be a place for the king in a new Nepal? Madhav Nepal only said: That would be decided by the Constituent Assembly. The question really is: to what extent can the king still win the confidence of the people of Nepal?

 The district administration of Kathmandu and Lalitpur has ordered the release of hundreds of political detainees taken into custody during the democracy movement.

 Those who were released today included former Supreme Court judge Laxman Aryal, former Speaker of Parliament Daman Nath Dhungana, a facilitator for talks with the Maoists Padmaratan Tuladhar, human rights activists Devendra Raj Pandey, Chaman Parsain and Krishna Pahadi and journalists Shyam Shreshtha, Kanak Mani Dixit and his wife.

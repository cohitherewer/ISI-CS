 Deccan cookies for fog, not rooms

 New Delhi, Dec. 12 (PTI): Taking exception to the norms by the directorate general of civil aviation (DGCA) on measures to overcome fog- related problems, low-cost carrier Air Deccan today said it would only partially follow the instructions.

 We will provide cookies and water if a flight is delayed by four hours. We do not intend to provide accommodation to passengers of cancelled flights if they have not taken off, Air Deccan chief operating officer Warwick Brady said.

 Announcing plans for overcoming fog-related problems, he said Air Deccan has increased staff at Delhi airport for customer support and also tied up with Cafe Coffee Day to provide beverages.

 Recently, the DGCA had issued guidelines to all airlines to provide food and beverages to delayed passengers and accommodation in case of cancelled flights, and also asked them to consider rescheduling of flights.

 Brady said it was not possible for a low-cost carrier like Air Deccan to provide hotel accommodation and transport to all the passengers. At the most we will offer information on the availability of hotels and guesthouses.

 On rescheduling flights, he said Air Deccan would only slightly tweak existing schedules by advancing departures from fog-prone airports by 15-25 minutes.

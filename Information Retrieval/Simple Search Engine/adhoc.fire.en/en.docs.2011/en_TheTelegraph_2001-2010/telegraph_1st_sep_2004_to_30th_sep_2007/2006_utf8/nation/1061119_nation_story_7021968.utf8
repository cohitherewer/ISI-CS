 The king will have to live like a commoner - Prachanda

 New Delhi, Nov. 18: Prachanda, the chief of the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist), is willing to be President of the Himalayan nation. He will take up the presidency, he said here today, of a democratic and republican Nepal if his party and the people so wish.

 But he would take up the presidency only after the monarchy is abolished. The king will have to live like a commoner, he said, but there is a high-level inquiry that has found him guilty of anti-people measures during the democratic movement. He may even have to face trial. 

 Prachandas idea of government is an executive presidency in a socialist multi-party set-up.

 The Maoist leader and his deputy Baburam Bhattarai were in Delhi today on a private visit that could scarcely be more public. Through the day, they addressed two news conferences and a high-profile conference that was addressed by Sonia Gandhi, Manmohan Singh and Afghanistans President Hamid Karzai among others.

 The Maoist leaders emphasised at every forum that they were indebted to the support they got from India from the government for being able to work out their 12-point agreement with political parties and from intellectuals who engaged in discussions and alerted them to possibilities.

 But the scoop of the Hindustan Times Leadership Summit was the address by Pushpa Kamal Dahal alias Prachanda who, in the words of presenter Karan Thapar, made his debut on an international stage.

 Prachanda said at the news conferences later that he, Bhattarai and Badal, chief of the Maoist Peoples Liberation Army, would not join the interim government in Nepal but their party would. 

 A comprehensive peace agreement between the Maoists and the Nepalese parliamentary parties has been reached and, Bhattarai said, would be signed soon after they return to Kathmandu tomorrow.

 Prachanda said there were two main reasons the core leadership of the Maoists will stay out of an interim government: First, they wanted to be free to mobilise public opinion ahead of the Constituent Assembly elections. 

 Second, the core leadership was still uncomfortable about sitting in the same ministry with some politicians the Maoists consider reactionary.

 Bhattacharjee and Yechury in New Delhi on Saturday. The Bengal chief minister dismissed the buzz that Sourav Ganguly would campaign for the CPM in the coming Bengal elections and put in a word of praise for the poll panel for doing their job. (PTI)

 New Delhi, March 11: As a duet it was perfect. And if there was no soul-stirring music, the harmony lay in the words.

 Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and Sitaram Yechury played a flawless jugalbandi at the Press Club of India this evening. If the Bengal chief minister said two lines, the CPM politburo member chipped in with an endorsement ? not a word out of sync at their date with the national media.

 They had their plate full ? a dollop of Bengal politics, a scoop of UPA-Left relations mixed with a slice of anti-US rhetoric and a chunk of economic reforms ? and answered in tandem.

 Both stressed that the CPM did not have different economic policies for the state and the Centre. Neither did they say that the Bengal CEO is at odds with a section of the party, particularly its trade union wing, on economic reforms.

 Last year, Bhattacharjee had run into trouble with some party leaders and Citu over the infotech sector, foreign investment in airports and the pension bill, which he is keen on getting passed. Today he shrugged off any suggestion of a row. Our party members and Citu are not opposing reforms. Sometimes we differ but we come to a consensus after a discussion, he said.

 In our party, Yechury said, leadership is not provided by an individual but by the party.

 Bhattacharjee was the perfect diplomat. There is nothing like my policy of industrialisation. The party is leading the government, he said.

 The chief minister added that he was trying his best to attract FDI for Bengal. I have visited all foreign countries ? Japan, Indonesia and recently Vietnam, he said. If necessary, I will go to the US for further investment.

 Yechury was quick to assert that the chief minister, in his zeal for foreign investment, was not transgressing the partys code on reforms. Our party document has laid down guidelines for FDI investment and West Bengal is getting foreign investment within these parameters, he said.

 As the evening progressed, Bhattacharjee faced a tricky one. Both the Prime Minister and the finance minister have lauded him. How does he take their praise even when they are critical of his partys opposition to reforms?

 How can I oppose something the Prime Minister is saying. It is finally the people who will decide, he replied.

 The Prime Minister does not insult me, Yechury piped up. He also praises me.

 About the US, Bhattacharjee said: I have great respect for the American people and their universities. But we hate Pentagon and the war-mongers.

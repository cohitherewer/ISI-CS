 Couple stabbed in Delhi flat

 New Delhi (PTI): An elderly woman was 

 killed and her ailing husband has been battling for life 

 after they were stabbed at their residence in a posh south 

 Delhi locality.

 Mohan Singh, 83, and his wife Surjeet Kaur, 70, were rushed to a private hospital in a critical condition on Monday night after Singh came down from their first-floor flat in Chittaranjan Park and alerted neighbours. Kaur died on Tuesday morning. 

 The couple suffered multiple wounds in their chest and abdomen inflicted by a kitchen knife. 

 Police believe the assailant was possibly known to the couple as there were no signs of any forced entry. We are looking into all angles, including a possible property dispute, a senior official said. 

 The couple has a daughter who lives in Greater Kailash.

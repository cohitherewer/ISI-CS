 Bollywood films draw Lanka tax

 Colombo, Feb. 20 (PTI): Sri Lanka is planning a controversial tax on imported films ? both Hollywood and Bollywood ? and television programmes with foreign content to fund its film industry that is in dire straits, officials said.

 Imported movies shown on television would be taxed at the rate of $750 per episode from April while television dramas and sitcoms would be taxed at the same rate for blocks of five half-hour programmes.

 The tax forms part of the islands budget this year and will be limited to imported content. Repeat broadcasts will not be taxed. Education programmes are exempt.

 We are still having discussions on how to impose the tax on exemptions and legal documentation that is needed. We hope to finalise it by the end of February and to implement by April, R.T.L. Weerasinghe, senior tax adviser at the treasury and former commissioner of inland revenue, said.

 The government has not set revenue targets yet, but the taxes will be channelled to a special fund to develop the local film industry, President Mahinda Rajapakse, who also holds the finance portfolio, said in his budget speech last November.

 Sri Lanka imports largely English language, Tamil and Hindi content for local television stations, though there are no estimates on total foreign film imports. Local television stations annually air over 1,500 movies, mainly in English, Tamil and Hindi.

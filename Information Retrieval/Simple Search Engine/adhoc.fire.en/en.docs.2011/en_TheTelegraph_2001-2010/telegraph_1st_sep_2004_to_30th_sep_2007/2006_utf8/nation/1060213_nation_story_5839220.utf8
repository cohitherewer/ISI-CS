 Flush it or flushout

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Bhopal, Feb. 12: First the sword loomed on their heads because they had more than two children. Now some 2,50,000 panchayat representatives fear they might be flushed out of their chairs.

 Their fault: they do not have water closets, or flush toilets, in their Madhya Pradesh homes.

 According to clause 36 of the MP Panchayati Raj amp; Gram Swaraj Act, 1993, if elected representatives at the grassroots level fail to install flush toilets some time after getting elected, they would be disqualified.

 State panchayati raj minister Narender Singh Tomar has instructed district collectors to slap showcause notices on 2,48,053 defaulting sarpanchs, panchs and members of zilla and block panchayats.

 Madhya Pradesh has 3,24,167 elected representatives at the panchayat level. Of them, only 76,114 have stuck by the rules.

 Tomar said money was not a constraint as the act amended in March 2005 stipulated a grant for flush toilets. Several reminders and notices were sent out, he said, but to no avail.

 The idea was to inculcate a sense of hygiene in rural areas and to abolish the unhealthy system of dry latrines, he said. It also aimed at promoting sanitation and discouraging the practice of women going out in the open. Elected representatives should be model citizens, Tomar said.

 The water closet, invented by Thomas Crapper, is said to be the symbol of modern civilisation. Many claim it has done more for public health than all the doctors since Hippocrates.

 But grassroots democrats in Madhya Pradesh beg to differ. Several defaulters condemn flush toilets as a waste of precious water.

 Tomar said a study of worldwide water usage patterns showed that household usage accounted for only 8 per cent of total water consumption. Agriculture used up 69 per cent and industry and other institutions 23 per cent, he said.

 You dont start with making the 8 per cent (household water consumption) more efficient, he said.

 Panchayati raj director Vijay Singh Niranjan said although the deadline for getting flush toilets constructed would expire later this month, elected representatives would be given a months grace.

 The power to disqualify rests with respective collectors, he said.

 Two years ago, some 839 sarpanchs, mostly women, were disqualified for not adhering to the two-child norm in the panchayati raj law.

 The defaulters had then resorted to various tricks to save their skin. A male sarpanch blamed it all on ruptured condoms and moved court, but had his plea dismissed. 

 A woman sarpanch gave out her third child for adoption.

 Another man denied he was the father of the third child his wife produced, leading to a proposal that a DNA test should be conducted to prove paternity.

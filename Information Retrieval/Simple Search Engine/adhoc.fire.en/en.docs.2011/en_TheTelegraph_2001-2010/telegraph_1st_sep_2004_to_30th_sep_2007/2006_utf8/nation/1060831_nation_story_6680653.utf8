 Law on way to make police humane

 MANAN KUMAR

 New Delhi, Aug. 30: Efforts are on to turn the police force into the public utility that it should have been in the first place, from the instrument of oppression it is now seen to be.

 A draft police bill, to replace the 1861 act, is ready and was open to public scrutiny till August 25.

 Drawn up in a little less than a year by legal luminaries such as former attorney-general Soli Sorabjee and National Law Institute director Ranbir Singh and police officials of repute, the draft attempts to make the police force humane and accountable.

 It proposes a code of social duties for police personnel and requires them to behave well with the public, especially women and children.

 The draft says it will be the duty of every policeman to guide and assist members of the public in particular women, children, the poor and the physically or mentally challenged who are either lost or find themselves helpless on the streets or other public places, or need help and protection.

 Without getting into formalities, it will also be the duty of every police official to provide all possible assistance to victims of crime and road accidents and to ensure that they are given prompt medical aid.

 Police personnel will be required to protect members of the public particularly women, children and the poor against criminal exploitation by any person or organised group. 

 They are expected to prevent harassment including stalking, making objectionable gestures, signs, sound and speech of women and children in public places and on public transport.

 The police will also be expected to arrange for legally permissible sustenance and shelter to every person in custody. It will be their duty to inform poor persons in custody of legal aid schemes and also inform the authorities concerned to provide such aid.

 All complaints handed in person or sent by post, email or other means will have to be recorded and prompt follow-up action taken. 

 Cognisable offences coming to the notice of police stations will have to be registered promptly, a copy of the first information report (FIR) handed to the complainant and investigation launched immediately. 

 To improve public-police relations, especially in rural areas and small towns, the draft proposes that the district superintendent of police shall constitute a community liaison group for each police station. 

 Respectable apolitical local residents of unimpeachable character and antecedents, including retired public servants and heads of teaching institutions, will make up the groups that will advise the police on their functioning. 

 Two representatives will be nominated by each panchayat samiti under the jurisdiction of a police station.

 The groups will identify the existing and emerging policing needs of the area, which will be taken into consideration by the station house officer while preparing an annual policing strategy and action plan. 

 The draft says the groups will meet as frequently as necessary, but at least once every quarter and the meetings will be open to the public. 

 The changes the draft proposes are long overdue. But perhaps as important as laying down these rules is the need to address the problems of low pay and lack of training, equipment and facilities that contribute to making policemen the much-maligned force that they are.

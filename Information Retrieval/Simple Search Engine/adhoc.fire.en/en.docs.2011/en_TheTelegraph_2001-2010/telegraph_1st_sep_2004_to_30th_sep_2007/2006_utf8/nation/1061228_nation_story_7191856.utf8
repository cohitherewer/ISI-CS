 Saddam shield for Iran heat

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 27: Delhi would have had an eye on domestic politics when it said yesterday that it hoped Saddam Husseins death sentence wouldnt be carried out.

 Through its stand on the former Iraqi President (in picture), the government is seeking to strike a balance in its West Asia policy, which was being seen at home as being influenced by Washington, a government official said.

 The Manmohan Singh government had drawn fire, especially from its key Left allies, after it voted with the US to refer Iran to the United Nations over its nuclear programme.

 The Centres West Asia policy could impact the Congresss fortunes in the upcoming Uttar Pradesh elections.

 Besides, Delhi felt the execution of Saddam would worsen the civil war in Iraq, causing the war-ravaged country to break up.

 A third reason could be the traditionally close ties between the Congress, which leads the ruling coalition, and Saddams Baath party.

 It is our hope that the sentence will not be carried out and the former Presidents life would be spared, foreign ministry spokesman Navtej Sarna had said after an appeals court confirmed the death sentence.

 He had added that Delhi also hopes that no steps are taken which might obstruct the process of reconciliation and delay restoration of peace in Iraq.

 A similar position to the governments but in far stronger terms was expressed by the CPM, which today described the death sentence as judicial assassination.

 The party said that no fair trial was possible for the former Iraqi ruler with his country under US occupation.

 The United States and the British government should realise that they will be responsible for the serious consequences which will result from this extra-legal step, a politburo statement said.

 Stamp on Naushad pardon

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 23: When she called on junior foreign minister E. Ahamed today, Suhaila had an inkling that her husband Abdul Latif Naushad would return home safe.

 Moments later, her long wait ? and worst nightmare ? was finally over.

 The Saudi authorities, Ahamed told her, had confirmed that Naushad has been pardoned by the man he partially blinded in a scuffle over money three years ago.

 Saudi Arabian ambassador in Delhi Saleh M. Al Ghamdi today assured the minister of state for external affairs that Naushads eye will not be gouged out, the punishment a Shariat court in Dammam had handed down to the 35-year-old former petrol station worker.

 The news that his victim had pardoned Naushad had spread yesterday. But the government confirmed it only after it got official communication from the Saudi authorities. 

 Ahamed also hoped Naushad would be released soon.

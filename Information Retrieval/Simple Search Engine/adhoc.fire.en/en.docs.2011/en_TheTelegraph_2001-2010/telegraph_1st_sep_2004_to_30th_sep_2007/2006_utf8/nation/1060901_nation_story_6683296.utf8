The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Rice farmers cheated of crores 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Aug. 31: The first shoots of a paddy-procurement scam estimated at Rs 200 crore are emerging from the silos in the Food Corporation of India (FCI) and the West Bengal State Consumers Cooperative Federation (Confed).

 The revelations have embarrassed a government already reeling under reports of starvation deaths in West Midnapore. I have heard about the alleged corruption and the enforcement branch has been asked to conduct a thorough probe, state food and civil supplies minister Paresh Adhikary said.

 Officers of Bengal polices enforcement branch have found that a few government officials colluded with rice mill owners and denied farmers the minimum price guaranteed by the state for their produce. Black-marketers also pocketed quick gains from grains meant for common people. 

 We have sealed some rice mill godowns and lodged FIRs against 12 people. Three have already been arrested and our team is raiding other godowns across the state, Bhupinder Singh, additional director of general enforcement branch told The Telegraph.

 According to him, paddy was procured at Rs 400 per quintal, instead of the Rs 590 promised by the government. Millions of farmers were denied the minimum support price the government has set. In the process, money changed hands from the top to bottom, said Singh, pointing the needle of suspicion towards FCI, Confed, officials of district cooperatives and several rice mill owners.

 Normally, Confed buys paddy from farmers at prices fixed by the government and sends it to mills where it is processed into rice. This reaches FCI warehouses before it makes its way to PDS (ration) shops.

 Preliminary investigation has revealed that Confed, the nodal agency for paddy procurement on the FCIs behalf and for its conversion into rice, also padded up figures about the paddy inventories in godowns. They claimed a stock of 32 million quintals on July 31, but thats not a reality. FCI and Confed officials minted money by illegally selling the stock when prices of paddy and rice were high in the market, an officer said.

 During recent raids on godowns and rice mills, investigators stumbled on forged documents showing higher paddy and rice stocks. 

 In some godowns, we found no rice, but the papers showed otherwise. We also came across godowns full of stock that should have reached ration shops, the officer said. The FCI is also conducting an internal inquiry. We have sent several teams to the districts to check the allegation. We are requesting district magistrates to help us, a corporation official said.

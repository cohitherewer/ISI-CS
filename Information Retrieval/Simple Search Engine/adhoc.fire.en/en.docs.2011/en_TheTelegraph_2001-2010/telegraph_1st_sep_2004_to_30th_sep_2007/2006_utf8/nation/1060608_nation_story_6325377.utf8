The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 BJP disowns Atal balm for Rahul

 POORNIMA JOSHI

 Swaraj: Firm

 New Delhi, June 7: Fearful of more revelations in the Rahul Mahajan scandal, the BJP is scrambling to distance itself from Atal Bihari Vajpayees comments offering sympathy and help to the young man.

 After the former Prime Minister described Rahuls actions as mistakes made in youth and spoke of the BJP giving him a new direction, senior spokesperson Sushma Swaraj went on air twice in 24 hours to virtually contradict him.

 Vajpayeeji is an elder statesman and he is, of course, always right. But the BJP has nothing to do with this affair, Sushma insisted.

 Vajpayee, too, had been careful to stress that the BJP wasnt involved in Rahuls actions, but his statement ? seen as virtually condoning the young mans lifestyle ? have set off a debate in the party. Most party colleagues support Sushmas stand.

 A senior leader today told The Telegraph that Vajpayee had made a terrible mistake by coming to Rahuls aid.

 Rahul Mahajan is not a teenager whose escapades can be dismissed as a mistake made in youth. He was being considered for a responsible position in the party. Vajpayeeji made a terrible mistake, he said.

 BJP leaders are convinced that the party should distance itself from the late Pramod Mahajans affairs now more than ever.

 Pramods personal life used to be discussed in hushed tones in the BJP even when he was alive. After his murder ? with mystery still surrounding the reason why brother Praveen killed him ? party colleagues are living in perpetual fear of more skeletons tumbling out of the cupboard.

 Vajpayee: Sympathetic

 This is not the end of it. We dont know what is going to come out. But whatever it is, it wont be favourable for the party, a BJP source close to the Mahajan family said.

 Many in the party feel there is more to Vajpayees defence of Rahul than mere sympathy for a family in crisis.

 Some say it was a call from Pramods wife Rekha to Vajpayee that led to his public statement in Rahuls support. Some others believe that the proximity of Vajpayees foster family to Pramod and his gang was the reason.

 Vajpayeeji is not known to (go out of his way to) protect anyones interests?. Why then did he make that statement? There is more to it than meets the eye, a senior leader said.

 Mistakes are often made in youth when you fall in bad company. Rahul has also made one, Vajpayee had told reporters in Manali on Sunday. Well try to set it right. Efforts will be made to give a new direction to Rahul.

 The veteran politician had stressed that the party has nothing to do with this episode but added that well definitely try to improve Rahul.

 Asked if the BJP might give Pramod Mahajans son a role in national politics, the former Prime Minister had left the issue open, suggesting Rahul would have to achieve this with hard work and talent.

 Mafia gets CA to wash cash

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Feb. 10: Bollywood was just for pleasure. For business, the underworld has been tapping the best money can buy: a chartered accountant.

 Mumbai police have arrested a chartered accountant, one of the most coveted professional segments in the country, on the charge of helping front companies run by gangster Chhota Rajan launder money.

 Bharat Dudani, well known in his professional circle, was picked up from his Bandra office on Thursday. The front companies, one of which has a Calcutta connection, have been accused of terrorising builders in Mumbai through extortion and land-grabbing.

 Dudani, in his forties, has said he had no idea that the clients were fronting for Rajan, now hiding abroad. Rajan is rumoured to have had contact with Indian intelligence agencies, primarily because of his running feud with Dawood Ibrahim.

 The police have invoked the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act against him ? the first time the feared anti-mafia law is being used against a professional as prized as a chartered accountant.

 Dudani was produced in a court today which sent him to police custody till February 22. Dudanis lawyer Satish Mane-Shinde told the court his client was innocent and had merely provided professional services to companies as a chartered accountant. 

 Special public prosecutor Rohini Salian said Dudani handled the financial transactions of real estate projects of Khushi Developers, a firm run by Rajans wife Sujata Nikhalje, and had helped launder an estimated Rs 1.5 crore.

 According to the prosecution, the laundered money was received by Sujata and a fugitive called Santosh alias Abu Sawant, both directors of Khushi Developers. Sujata is now under arrest. 

 Khushi Developers has among its investors five companies that have given Calcutta addresses. Police sources said they are trying to establish whether the addresses are genuine or not.

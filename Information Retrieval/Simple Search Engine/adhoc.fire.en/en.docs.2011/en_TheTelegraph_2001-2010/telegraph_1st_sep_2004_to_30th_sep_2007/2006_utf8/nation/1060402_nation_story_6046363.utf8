 Amar pleads for more time

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 1: Looking to prevent the Election Commission from taking any untoward step before Parliament takes up the question of office of profit, Samajwadi Party leader Amar Singh has sought six weeks to file a reply to the disqualification petition against him. 

 His counsel Pradeep Kumar Rai conveyed to the poll panel, which has sought Amars comments on the petition, that the Samajwadi Party leader was yet to get some relevant information from the Uttar Pradesh government and, therefore, needed time.

 The petition, filed by Congress activist Jagdish Prasad Shukla, says that as chairman of the Uttar Pradesh Development Council, Amar holds an office of profit and should be disqualified from the Rajya Sabha.

 The six-week period will end on May 12, two days after Parliament is scheduled to meet, mainly to try and resolve the office of profit tangle.

 On March 10, the Election Commission had issued a notice to Amar and asked him to file a reply by March 31. 

 In his reply, filed yesterday by his counsel, the Samajwadi Party leader said the development council chairmans post is not one of profit. The council is registered under the Societies Act and, therefore, is not a government body, he added. 

 Amar also used the opportunity to put in a word for his party colleague Jaya Bachchan, whose disqualification from the Rajya Sabha triggered the controversy. He said the poll panel had misinterpreted her case.

 According to Rai, Amars reply mentioned how the commission had failed to take into consideration several Supreme Court judgments while formulating its opinion on the allegation against Jaya.

 Amar also questioned the basis of the case against him, saying the reference made to the Election Commission should have been signed by President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam and not his secretary P.M. Nair, Rai said.

 Amar has demanded that his case be investigated by a parliamentary committee.

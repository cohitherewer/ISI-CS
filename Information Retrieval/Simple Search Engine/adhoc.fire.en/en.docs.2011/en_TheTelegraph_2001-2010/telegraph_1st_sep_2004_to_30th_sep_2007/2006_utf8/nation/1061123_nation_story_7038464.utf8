 Valley go slow on Gulmarg

 The state decided to auction around 70 acres at Gulmarg in October. The move involves leasing out the land to state subjects but allows joint ventures with private investors from outside the state for infrastructure development.

 An auction committee, headed by the Baramulla district development commissioner, was formed to expedite the process. But official sources said the committee has not made any progress.

 Infosys chief on Calcutta date

 Calcutta: Infosys chairman N.R. Narayana Murthy will be in Calcutta on Wednesday, but a meeting with the state administration doesnt seem to be on the cards, says a staff reporter.

 The Infosys mentor will deliver the keynote address at the K.C. Basu Memorial Lecture, organised by the National University of Juridical Science, on Thursday. 

 A senior Infosys official denied that Murthy was coming to town to facilitate the setting up of a proposed Rs 100-crore, 250-acre campus, which has run into a roadblock because of differences between the company and government officials on land rates. 

 Infosys has said the rates quoted by the Bengal government are prohibitive and would have to be lowered in order to be more competitive with other cities.

 Gender divide eases in army

 New Delhi (PTI): The government has issued orders to bring at par the terms and conditions for men and women officers opting for the army through the short service commission. 

 The army has now scrapped the special entry scheme for women so that they can join through the commission as short service officers for contractual service ranging from 10 to 14 years. 

 It has also raised the training period for women officers from 24 weeks to 49 weeks, the same as for male officers who join through the short service commission. 

 Under the new system, the women officers would be eligible for promotion to the rank of captain in two years, major after six and lieutenant colonel in 13 years. 

 Meteor tests

 Ahmedabad (PTI): Fragments of rocks that fell in parts of Gujarat on Monday night have been sent for chemical analysis. 

 The glowing rock shower had prompted people to make frantic calls to local officials. The tests will also determine the origin and age of the rocks that scientists believe could be meteorites.

 Mahajan case

 Mumbai (PTI): A court here rejected the bail petition of Praveen Mahajan, accused of killing his elder brother and BJP leader, Pramod Mahajan, on Tuesday. There was prima facie evidence linking Praveen to the crime, sessions judge Abhay Thipsay said. 

 Taj minarets

 Mumbai (PTI): The Taj Mahals minarets are stable, the Rajya Sabha was told on Tuesday. The study was done by the Survey of India in 2005, tourism and culture minister Ambika Soni said.

 The Indian Army has set up a 24-hour helpline for ex-servicemen at its station headquarters in Shimla to inform former defence personnel of benefits available for them.

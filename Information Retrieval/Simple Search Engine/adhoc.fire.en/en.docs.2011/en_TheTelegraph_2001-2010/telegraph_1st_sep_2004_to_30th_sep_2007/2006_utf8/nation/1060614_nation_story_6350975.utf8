 Munda feels profit pangs

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, June 13: The BJP today indicated its willingness to sacrifice the NDA government in Jharkhand on the office of profit bill, which it has decided to oppose in the monsoon session of Parliament.

 We have taken a moral stand to uphold the values that our Constitution-makers had laid down. The autonomy of the legislature has to be maintained at any cost. Holding offices of profit indebts the legislature to the executive to a large extent. We have decided to oppose the bill in Parliament, said former BJP president M. Venkaiah Naidu.

 But if the BJP opposes UPAs decision to bring the bill in Parliament, it cannot obviously justify the BJP-led government doing the same in Jharkhand. 

 Jharkhand chief minister Arjun Munda met BJP president Rajnath Singh today reportedly to sort out the issue in the light of the party taking a moral stand at the Centre.

 The Jharkhand Assembly had passed a similar bill protecting 22 categories of posts. The bill has since been returned by the Jharkhand governor and the Assembly has not yet sent it back to him a second time.

 Sources in the BJP said the party is, to a large extent, reconciled to the idea of the Jharkhand government getting de- stabilised. Babulal Marandi has gone. It is only a matter of time before he brings the government down. Why shouldnt we let the government fall on a moral issue, especially as it entails a larger game at the Centre? asked a senior leader.

 But others in the BJP appeared to have developed a face-saving plan in Jharkhand.

 You see, we have taken a moral stand. But morality should not be restricted only to the BJP. All political parties should adhere to these values. If the Left and the Congress are bent on introducing the bill, why shouldnt the Jharkhand Assembly pass it again and send it back to the governor? asked a senior leader.

 With Munda deemed to have the blessings of Rajnath, this section believes the party would risk adopting a hypocritical stand in Jharkhand and save the government. 

 On the other hand, strategists in the BJP are keeping a close watch on the Election Commission. 

 If the EC decides to act against the MPs before the monsoon session, it becomes a much more serious issue. In that case, we may have to revise our plan for Jharkhand, said sources in the party.

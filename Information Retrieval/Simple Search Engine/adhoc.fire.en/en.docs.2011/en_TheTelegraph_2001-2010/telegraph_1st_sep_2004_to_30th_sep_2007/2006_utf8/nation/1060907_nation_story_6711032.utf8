 Snub to Coke talks offer 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 6: The Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) today rejected Coca-Colas offer to discuss standards for pesticide residues in soft drinks, accusing the industry of trying to discredit its findings.

 The CSE had initially agreed to accept the offer made last month after it had released its second report on pesticide residues in soft drinks, but decided against it because the process of setting standards has been subverted, CSE officials said.

 Our initial response was in good faith, believing that the company was genuinely interested in a dialogue on how the process of regulation and standard-setting would move forward, said CSE director Sunita Narain. 

 But recent events make it clear that public policy is being compromised and we cannot see the purpose of a meeting between Coca-Cola and us.

 In response, Coca-Cola India said it remains interested in a dialogue with all stakeholders, including the CSE. 

 The company said it supports moves by the government to adopt clear criteria for pesticide residues, based on scientifically validated testing methods. 

 We would welcome it if the CSE would reconsider its position and accept to meet, the company said.

 The CSE report on pesticide residues in soft drinks has been questioned by both the industry and a government-appointed panel of experts that has picked holes in the findings and dubbed them inconclusive. 

 Industry representatives have also said there are no internationally validated testing protocols for measuring pesticide residues in soft drink samples.

 The CSE today reiterated that the soft drink industry and the expert panel had misinterpreted its scientific data and tried to discredit its findings.

 It said the Bureau of Indian Standards has already finalised pesticide residue standards and they only need to be notified. But the government and the industry have tried to delay this process and divert it to the validation of testing methods, the CSE said.

 Coca-Cola said the company is working with government bodies in India to develop and finalise the criteria for pesticide residues along with associated testing protocols. 

 Since both the CSE and we are interested in protecting the health of Indian consumers, we believe there is an opportunity for us to work together, it said.

 Atal praises, party punches

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 19: Learn from the Left, Atal Bihari Vajpayee had said.

 No way, his party bristled today, at least not from those who speak with a forked tongue.

 Addressing a news conference to expose the hypocrisy of the Left, BJP spokesman Prakash Javdekar spoke about the Lefts double standards in raising issues and accused the CPM of a tacit understanding with the CPI (Maoist), a banned rebel group.

 The comment came a day after the former Prime Ministers praise of the Left hit headlines. 

 Vajpayees sermon to his party came at the recent BJP national executive. The partys mouthpiece, BJP Today, carried the full text of the speech in its latest issue.

 It is true that the way the communist parties are moving ahead fast, we should not ape them, but we should learn the art of getting renewal of mandate for our government. It is a great test to get back in power, Vajpayee had said.

 Today, Javdekar said the Left parties speak with a forked tongue. They circulated a note just before the UPA-Left coordination meeting last week and mentioned their objections to fuel price hike, the UPA foreign policy, economic policy and agricultural prices. But when the meeting actually took place, not a word was mentioned about it. This is the hypocrisy of the Left, he said.

 Though they seemed to have forgotten about issues concerning the common man, they made a very forceful demand ? to ban the Salva Judum operation in Chhattisgarh. 

 We all know Salva Judum is a peoples movement to fight the Naxalites.... But since their communist brethren are getting damaged by this operation, the CPM wants it banned, Javdekar said.

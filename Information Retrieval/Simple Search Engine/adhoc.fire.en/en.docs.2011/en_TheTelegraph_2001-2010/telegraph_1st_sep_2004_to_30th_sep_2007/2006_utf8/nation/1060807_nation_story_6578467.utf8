 Womb death fine

 New Delhi, Aug. 6 (PTI): A city consumer court has asked a nursing home to pay Rs 75,000 as compensation to a woman whose baby died in the womb as the doctors did not opt for Caesarean delivery.

 The Delhi state consumer disputes redressal commission held Goyal Medical Centre in Vasant Nihar guilty of taking chances when they were required to resort to the safest course to save the baby of Reena whose uterus ruptured as she was not operated upon for taking out the baby alive.

 ...The safest course should have been adopted by the appellant instead of taking a chance in making the delivery normal by inducing artificial pain instead of resorting to... Caesarean section, said the bench comprising Justice J.D. Kapoor and member Rumnitta, rejecting the nursing homes appeal.

 The nursing home had appealed against the verdict of a district consumer forum which had asked it to pay Rs 2 lakh to the complainant on account of negligence that resulted in the death of the child in the womb and rupture of Reenas uterus.

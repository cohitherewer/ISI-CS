 Movie air cleared with rider

 Mumbai, Aug. 31 (PTI): Bombay High Court today directed movie channels, which are off the air in many parts of Maharashtra, to file an undertaking that they would abide by its order not to beam adult films.

 Several movie channels moved a division bench seeking a clarification that multi-system operators and cable service providers can telecast films with U and U/A certificates if movie channels provided them new decoders.

 On the courts orders, police had seized the old decoders. 

 The channels wanted an assurance that new decoders would not be impounded.

 The court said that such a clarification was not really needed. But in larger public interest, it agreed to tell the police that channels can provide new decoders. In this context, the court asked the channels to file the undertaking.

 Chandigarh, May 28: Union minister of state for finance Pawan Kumar Bansal has said farmers should get a share in industrial projects for which their land is acquired.

 Farmers should be given a share in the projects or some kind of partnership by companies. It is my personal view, he said today at a seminar, Farmer and Finance ? 2006 and Beyond, organised by an NGO, Amrik Singh Cheema Foundation Trust. Over 500 bankers and farmers from Haryana, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh and Rajasthan attended the seminar.

 Bansals remark comes close on the heels of the Haryana and Punjab governments acquiring land at cheap rates for companies to set up units.

 Land is being handed over to companies either at the rate set two decades ago by the Punjab government or between 60 and 80 per cent less than the market rates in both states. This has invited allegations of sellout by farmer bodies and the Opposition, including the Left parties.

 There is a need to look into the interests of the farmers and the UPA government led by Manmohan Singh is moving in that direction. It is a priority sector for us. This year, we expect agri-credits advanced by banks to touch Rs 1,75,000 crore as against Rs 85,000 crore when we came to power, Bansal said.

 The minister said if India has to achieve a growth rate of 10 per cent or more, progress in agriculture has to be given paramount importance.

 We have to take it to 4 per cent, he said, lamenting that farmers in several areas were still dependent on rains for irrigation. We will have to improve this sector.

 The minister said farmers were being provided loans up to Rs 3 lakh at 7 per cent interest. We have had to provide subsidy of Rs 1,700 crore to banks for the purpose.

 Bansal, however, regretted that arthiyas (private moneylenders) exploit farmers by charging interest at rates as high as 40 per cent. The Centre has written to state governments to take steps to stop such exploitation, he said.

 Bansal, who holds the banking and insurance portfolios, lamented that only 3.5 per cent of the farmers were taking the benefit of crop insurance.

 Satish C. Jha, member of the economic advisory council to the Prime Minister, expressed concern about the less than 1 per cent agricultural growth in Punjab and Haryana. It is a matter of concern that excessive mechanisation has reduced the labour absorption capacity, resulting in severe implications of poverty, he said.

 Stating that 78 per cent of all farm households were in debt in Punjab, Jha quoted a study which showed that 84 per cent of households in Patiala ? the Punjab chief ministers home district ? and 51 per cent in Amritsar were found to be borrowers.

 Non-productive loans were taken from private moneylenders. The study states that Punjab farmers are under a debt of Rs 57,000 crore and moneylenders account for 46 per cent of the loans. It is shame for the country as a whole to let Punjab and Haryana continue with deepening agricultural crisis. This trend must halt at the earliest, he said.

 Jagdeep Singh Cheema, chairman of the trust which organised the seminar, urged banks to adopt policies to protect farmers from being exploited by moneylenders. He also emphasised that the farmers should be protected so that they do not divert their farm credits to meet social needs.

 Cheema also sought policies and schemes to prevent farmers from committing suicide for failing to repay loans.

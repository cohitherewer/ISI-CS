 Medha army cries arrest, sneers at govt

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Medha: In custody?

 New Delhi, April 7: 

 Medha Patkar was not allowed to meet any visitor at AIIMS 

 today, prompting cries that she was virtually under arrest.

 Medha had summoned Shivani Chowdhry, a Narmada Bachao Andolan activist, to dictate a letter this morning. But she could not go in. She is under arrest. They refused to let me see her. She is not some criminal who should be deprived of her basic rights, Shivani said.

 NBA activists continued their campaign for the rehabilitation of those displaced by the raising of the height of the Sardar Sarovar dam, with more people joining their indefinite fast.

 Three Union ministers ? Saifuddin Soz, Meira Kumar and Prithviraj Chavan ? who are visiting the Narmada valley also came in the protesters line of fire. They dubbed the trip a farce and an exercise in futility.

 The ministers are travelling in a motorcade of about 50 vehicles. They are visiting the resettlement sites, not the villages affected by the dam height. The people, however, forced them to visit some affected villages, said NBA activist Dipti Bhatnagar.

 The NBA has sent lawyer Prashant Bhushan to keep an eye on the ministers. Bhatnagar alleged they have not followed the route that was agreed on.

 The three are slated to return tomorrow and submit their report.

 Mona Das, the president of the JNU Students Union, found it laughable that the government hoped to survey displacements forced over 20 years in just one day.

 We have decided to sit on an indefinite fast in solidarity with Medha because the issue is not just the dam and its height. It is the whole paradigm of development in our country, she said.

 Following Das to the Jantar Mantar protest site was Kamal Mitra Chenoy, the JNU Teachers Association president and a CPI activist.

 With Medha in hospital, a headless NBA is struggling to find somebody to step into her shoes. Ironically, the ones looking likely to take on the job are all from the Left ? her one-time detractors.

 When Chenoy and Das joined the fasting ranks, they were suddenly thrust into the role of advisers.

 The CPIs D. Raja and Amarjeet Kaur, too, have been permanent fixtures beside Medha in the last month, and the picture was complete with the CPMs Brinda Karat stepping into the frame.

 Left leaning womens groups and intellectuals, too, streamed into Jantar Mantar today. 

 With cries of Inquilab zindabad and Jab lal lal lehrayega, tab hosh thikane ayega (When we paint the sky with red flags, realisation will dawn on you) filling the air far too often, the Gandhian protest is clearly taking on a communist hue.

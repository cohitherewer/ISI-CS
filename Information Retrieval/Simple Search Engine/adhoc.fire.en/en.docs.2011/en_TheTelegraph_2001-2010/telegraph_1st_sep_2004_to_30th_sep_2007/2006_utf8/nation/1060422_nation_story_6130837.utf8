 Boucher clears nuclear deal air

 Washington, April 21 (PTI): The US has said Indias own moratorium on nuclear testing was one of the reasons why the civilian nuclear agreement was signed between the countries and that it looked forward to the continuance of the moratorium.

 The Indian decision to have a moratorium on nuclear testing is one of the basis on which we think we should, and can, undertake this civilian nuclear cooperation, said Richard Boucher, assistant secretary of state for South and Central Asia, yesterday.

 The senior US official said America looked forward for that (moratorium) to continue and that is why it is not surprising to find that encoded in various forms in documents we write and the statements we make.

 It was Indias decision to do that just as the major nuclear powers themselves decided not to test.

 Boucher, who is likely to appear before the US Congress after it reconvenes next week, was hopeful the nuclear deal would happen not this year but within the next few months. He said both sides would have to negotiate disregarding media reports. 

 His statement comes at a time when there have been news reports that India is about to sign an agreement with the US that would require Delhi to give up the option of testing a nuclear weapon forever.

 The US has reportedly submitted to the Indian government a 22-page draft of the agreement.

 But the Indian foreign ministry said it will not accept any proposal requiring it to give up its option for a nuclear test forever, but iterated its commitment to the unilateral moratorium on further testing.

 Boucher also said it has been the US position that all the parties in the region need to think about strategic stability, adding that Pakistan was kept well-informed on how matters were proceeding.

 He said Iran was not a major issue in the agreement.

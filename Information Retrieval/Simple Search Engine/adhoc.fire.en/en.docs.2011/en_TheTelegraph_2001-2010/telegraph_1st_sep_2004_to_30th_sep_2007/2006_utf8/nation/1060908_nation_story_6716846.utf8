 sport outfits from The Snail, Sabyasachis last 

 collection 

 Calcutta, Sept. 7: The Snail has leapfrogged to global glory. 

 The collection, which fetched Sabyasachi Mukherjee accolades at the Lakme Fashion Week in Mumbai in April and a ticket to the Olympus Fashion Week 2006 in New York, is in Vogue.

 The magazines portal, style.com, has rated him as one of the two most awaited new names on the Big Apple ramp. 

 Sabyas spring-summer 2006-07 collection, which retains influences of The Snail and draws inspiration from photographs and paintings by Egon Schiele, will be on display at the Bryant Park UPS Hub on Saturday.

 The Snail is a winner and I know it will take me very far internationally, he had told The Telegraph in March.

 Six months on, his words are coming true.

 New York Times has previewed the spring-summer collection of this young designer from Calcutta in its Thursday Style section. Leading fashion portal www.fashionwiredaily.com has featured this sensational designer from India on its homepage in the run-up to the fashion week. 

 Sabyasachi 

 There are 94 designers showing at the Olympus Fashion Week, including some of the biggest names in world fashion. And Im the only designer whose collection has been previewed by New York Times, Sabya told The Telegraph from New York.

 But thats not where the Sabya saga ends. Some of the most famous supermodels of New York who regularly model for Valentino, Versace, Prada, Armani and Jil Sander are very keen to walk the ramp for me at the fashion week. And whats more, they dont want any money, they just want me to give them one outfit each, he added.

 The fashion week to be held between September 8 and 15 will see the spring-summer lines of top-notch designers, including Oscar de la Renta, Armani, Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren, Donna Karen and Anna Sui.

 The number of new names on the fashion calendar seems to grow each season, and spring 2007 is no exception. Two arrivals were excited about are Danish-by-way-of-London import Camilla Staerk and Calcutta-based Sabyasachi Mukherjee, reads the style.com review. 

 Mukherjee is slated to receive the Indian Oscar for his work on the film Black, but dont expect Bollywood theatrics. If his last collection, The Snail, is any indication, subtle ornamentation seems to be his slow and steady yet winning approach, it adds.

 Fashionwiredaily, on the other hand, has praised his excellent mastery of style, selection of great fabrics, silhouette and color.

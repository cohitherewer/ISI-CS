 Ladakh festival renamed

 New Delhi, May 31 (PTI): The Sindhu Darshan festival, promoted by the previous NDA government, has been renamed as the Ladakh Singhey-Khabab Spring Festival by the current regime. 

 The name was changed by the Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Council at the behest of the Union tourism ministry to give the festival a local identity and delink it from Hindutva, sources said. 

 We disapprove of the change of name, Pinto Norbu, local MLA representing the Ladakh Union Territory Front, said at a news conference to announce this years programme. The Sindhu Darshan festival had gained certain popularity and momentum. The change of name, due to whatever compulsions, is going to affect its relevance. 

 The event, held from June 12 to 14 every year, aims to highlight Ladakhs history and culture and was celebrated in an informal way in 1997. After the BJP-led NDA government came to power, it adopted the festival and gave it prominence.

 The then deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani turned it into an annual event.

 Ladakh hill development council chief executive Tsering Dorjay said the council had taken the decision on its own because it wanted a local name.

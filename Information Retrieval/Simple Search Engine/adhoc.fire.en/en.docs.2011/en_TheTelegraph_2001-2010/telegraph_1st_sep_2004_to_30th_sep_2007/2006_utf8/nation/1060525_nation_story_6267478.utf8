 Bid to keep identity secret

 New Delhi, May 24 (PTI): With a debate on quotas for the socially underprivileged raging across the country, the government is considering suggestions for protecting identity of SC, ST and OBC candidates appearing for Public Service Commission exams, including UPSC.

 In a paper sent to the PMO, the Planning Commission has suggested doing away with the current practice of issuing distinct roll numbers to SC, ST and OBC candidates appearing for such exams as it exposes them to discrimination by interviewers. These numbers would be replaced with a serial number, common up to the interview level, to guard against any discrimination.

 A computerised identifiable roll number given to candidates belonging to these weaker sections is different from the ones given to general category candidates. Interviews for the SC, ST and OBC candidates are also held separately.

 Suggesting changes in the interview system for the much-sought-after administrative service offices, the paper said, ...Having full particulars of fathers name, caste, religion and place of birth etc could result in the interview board discriminating against these candidates while favouring some, therefore, the interview board should not have any particulars except the roll number.

 Personal details of the candidates could be kept with respective chairmen and the roll numbers would be decoded for the final results.

 The suggested system is already in force in Uttar Pradesh Public Service Commission, an official said. 

 Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia has discussed it with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and the paper has been sent to his office, a senior official of the commission said.

 The matter has also been discussed with home minister Shivraj Patil and agriculture minister Sharad Pawar, he said.

 Ahmedabad/Mumbai, May 26: After banning Aamir Khans Fanaa in Gujarat, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad has now called for a boycott of Kashmiri goods in retaliation for the death of four Gujarati tourists in a terrorist attack in Srinagar yesterday.

 VHP international general secretary Praveen Togadia today appealed to the people of Gujarat not to buy or sell Kashmiri apples, handicraft, carpets or shawls, and not to visit the tourist paradise.

 He argued that a boycott of Kashmiri goods and tourism in the rest of the country would break the backbone of the militants who thrive on our tourism money.

 Without local support in the Valley, the jihadis cannot survive. So boycotting the supporters goods is a peaceful answer, Togadia said.

 From Saturday, VHP activists would fan out across Gujarat asking both consumers and traders to follow the boycott call, to be broadcast through billboards, posters and pamphlets.

 A similar threat hangs over Aamir Khan, whose troubles in the state arent over with the unofficial ban on Fanaa. 

 The state BJP youth wing has said it would call for a boycott of all products endorsed by the actor, who had yesterday refused to apologise for his support to the Sardar Sarovar Dam oustees.

 If Aamir Khan doesnt retract his statements on Narmada and apologise to the people of Gujarat, we will urge all the people to ban products promoted by the actor, like Toyota Innova and Coca-Cola, BJP youth leader Amit Thakar said.

 The statement had the Mumbai corporate world in a tizzy today.

 This is ridiculous?. So much effort and money goes into the creating of a brand. How is a brand responsible for the endorsers personal opinion? said an animated Gullu Sen, executive vice-president of Dentsu Communications, which handles the Toyota Innova account.

 Adman Prahlad Kakkar felt the issue would not dent Aamirs popularity as a celeb endorser, either among the audience or among advertisers.

 The majority of the corporates will refuse to be browbeaten by this kind of blackmail. They know if they succumb to this, it will make them vulnerable to many other such blackmails in future, he said.

 Coca-Colas reactions were more restrained. No such information has come to us yet? it is against our policy to react on such issues, said Viraj Chauhan, head of integrated marketing communication, Coke.

 A source in Yashraj Films, which produced and distributed Fanaa, said chief minister Narendra Modi had promised to help get the film released in Gujarat.

 Fanaa is not being shown in any of the multiplexes or single-screen theatres in the state with the Multiplex Association and Cinemetrograph Exhibitors Association deciding against screening the film.

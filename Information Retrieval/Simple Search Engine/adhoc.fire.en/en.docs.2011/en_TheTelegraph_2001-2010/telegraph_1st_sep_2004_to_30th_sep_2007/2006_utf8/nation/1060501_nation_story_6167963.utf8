 Mystery suicide in city hotel

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, April 30: A 33-year-old man committed suicide by slitting his wrist in the room of a city hotel this afternoon. 

 Police recovered the body of Amitabha Ghosh lying in a pool of blood on the toilet floor. However, no suicide note has been found. 

 Gyanwant Singh, deputy commissioner of police, detective department, said Ghosh, who was an employee of a Delhi-based multinational company, had booked into hotel room 434. 

 Preliminary investigations suggest that Ghosh was a resident of Dum Dum though he had given a Delhi address in the hotels register. 

 He bought a brand new packet of blades and used one to cut his veins. The reason behind the suicide is not known yet, said Singh.

 The police said Ghosh went to his Tangra office on Friday but did not return home. His father then lodged a missing diary with Tangra police station. 

 According to an official of the central Calcutta hotel, Ghosh had checked in around 2 pm yesterday and was supposed to check out today around 1 in the afternoon. But he did not.

 After waiting for a couple of hours, we called him up around 3 pm through intercom but failed to get any response. 

 Our security guards went up and found the door of the room bolted from inside. They pressed the bell several times in vain. We smelt something fishy and opened the door with a duplicate key and were shocked to find Ghosh lying dead in the toilet. We immediately informed the police, the official said. 

 A couple of hours after checking in, Ghosh hired a car from a nearby travel agency and went out at 4.10 pm. He returned after three hours. 

 At 7.30 pm, he had snacks and drinks at the hotels bar and was there for almost a couple of hours. After that he went straight to his fourth-floor room and was not seen after that, an investigating officer said. 

 The body has been sent for a post-mortem.

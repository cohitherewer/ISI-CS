 Prayers for Pramod

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Bhopal, April 24: As Pramod Mahajan quietly battles for life in a Mumbai hospital, a minister in Madhya Pradesh is chanting the name of Ram for the BJP general secretarys recovery.

 At the residence of Kailash Vijayvargiya, the state minister for power, public works and information technology, over 150 sadhus have been reciting Ramcharitmanas round the clock. They have also performed a yagna.

 The sadhus from Ayodhya and Hardwar were offered a special vegetarian meal, with the minister himself taking charge of all arrangements.

 This Ramcharitmanas path will continue till tomorrow and we are hoping for the best results, Vijayvargiya said. Reciting the name of Ram has a special significance, and we are confident that the Almighty will heed our prayers.

 Mango to Japan

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 15 : Japan has agreed to lift its two-decade ban on importing Indian mangoes. 

 The commerce ministry today said Shoichi Nakagawa, Japans minister for agriculture, forestry and fisheries, announced the decision in Tokyo after a meeting with commerce minister Kamal Nath. 

 The ban is expected to be formally lifted by July.

 Nath, who had been pursuing the matter with Japan to secure market access for Indian mangoes, announced that once the embargo is lifted, the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority would hold a special mango festival in Japan.

 Japan had imposed the ban in 1986 because of suspected presence of fruit flies.

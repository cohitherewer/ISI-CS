The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Partners seek white paper

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, July 10: The CPMs allies today said the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government must earmark non-agricultural land in the backward districts for industrial use and plan development accordingly, instead of acquiring land that suits investors. 

 The CPI and the Forward Bloc also demanded a white paper on the land acquisition for Tata, Salim Group and Reliance projects. 

 Bhattacharjee and industries minister Nirupam Sen had earlier met CPI and Bloc leaders to clear their doubts about the industry policy, but today the partners said they must also discuss land acquisition with their farmer leaders.

 Why should we give away farmland only because the Tatas, the Salim Group or some other industrial group wants it? The government should set up a committee to examine project reports and offer land according to availability rather than go along with the investors. We failed to convince the Tatas to set up their small-car unit in a place like Durgapur where industrial infrastructure already exists, Bloc state secretary Asoke Ghosh said.

 For 30 years, agriculture was our foundation. We owe our achievements to farmers. But we still lack information on land, its conversion and use. Thats why the government could not tell the Tatas about the character of land in Singur, Ghosh complained. 

 Land where sick or closed mills are located and plots left unused for long by other investors can accommodate new industries, he felt. 

 The Tatas want 1,000 acres at Singur in Hooghly district, about 40 km from Calcutta. The government has said that only a quarter of the land to be acquired there is multi-crop.

 The chief minister had also said that he could not refuse Ratan Tata when he wanted a plot close to Calcutta for his small-car project.

 Probodh Panda, an MP and state secretary of the CPIs farmers wing, Pradeshik Krishak Sabha, demanded a white paper and a meeting with the chief minister. 

 Its not for the capitalists but the government to decide where industries would come up. Let them set up units in Bankura or Purulia. There must be transparency in land acquisition, he said.

 With the acquisition of around 50,000 acres on the cards, Bengal will run the risk of a food crisis, Ghosh said. CPM insiders, too, are expressing concern, he added.

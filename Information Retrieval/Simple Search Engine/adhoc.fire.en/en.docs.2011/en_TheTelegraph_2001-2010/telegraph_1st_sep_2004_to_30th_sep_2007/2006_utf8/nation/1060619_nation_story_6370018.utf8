 Surrender, then appeal

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 18: The Supreme Court has ruled that appeals in criminal cases would not be entertained until the convict surrenders according to the sentence imposed by subordinate courts.

 Even if a subordinate court suspends the sentence for enabling the convict to challenge its order, the appeal would not be posted for hearing before the apex court unless the petitioner surrenders, the bench headed by Justice Arijit Passayat clarified.

 Pointing to the Supreme Court Rules, 1966, the bench said the position was crystal clear that an appeal in a criminal case would not be entertained unless a proof of surrender is furnished by the appellant.

 The rule is mandatory and would have to be complied with unless the Supreme Court passes an order of exemption on an application by the convict, the bench added.

 The courts observation came while it refused to entertain a petition by M.S. Srinivasan, who had challenged his conviction by a Mumbai special court for trial on offences relating to transactions in securities. The court said Srinivasans petition would be posted for hearing only after he files a proof of surrender.

 Senior counsel Kamini Jaiswal argued that her client was not required to surrender as the special court had suspended the sentence under the provisions of the Special Court (Trial of Offences Relating to Transaction in Securities) Act, 1992. The Supreme Court rules had no application in this case as there was a provision in the act for suspension of sentence, she contended.

 But the apex court dismissed the argument, saying the act in no way authorised the special court to regulate proceedings before the apex court.

 When Jaiswal pointed out several cases where the apex court had directed suspension of sentence while hearing appeals, the bench observed that the rules do not appear to have been brought to the notice of the court. 

 The court pointed out that a judgment rendered without reference to statutory bars could not have any precedent value. In view of the specific statutory bar, the view, if any, expressed without analysing the statutory provision cannot in our view be treated as a binding precedent, it said.

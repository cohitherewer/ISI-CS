 New Delhi, June 26: Defence minister Pranab Mukherjee today asked the chiefs of the armed forces to undertake a feasibility study on commissioning women officers for all roles in the army, navy and the air force. 

 During his routine Monday meeting with the service chiefs, he specifically discussed the role of women in the forces and asked for the Chiefs of Staff Committee to take a view on granting permanent commission to women.

 Mukherjee held out the possibility that women may be inducted into the combat arms of the forces for permanent commission. 

 Women are recruited as officers on short-service commission only with a maximum tenure of 14 years only in non-combat units.

 Women should be part of all activities of the armed forces, including combat.... There are problems but I have posed the issue before them (the service chiefs) and asked for a feasibility study, said Mukherjee.

 The role of women in the armed forces have been in focus since Lt Susmita Chakraborthy shot herself in Udhampur recently and her father said she found her tasks in the army frustrating. 

 Since then, there have been instances of women being discriminated against even in the non-combat arms. But the debate on the role of women in the forces is unlikely to be resolved shortly because of practical, operational and cultural difficulties that the military establishment is reluctant to discuss in public platforms.

 Asked if he envisaged inducting women into combat units, the defence minister said: Women are doing a good job and we should create facilities. (It is possible) to see women in every walk of the armed forces.

 Mukherjee said the recommendations of a committee chaired by former defence secretary Ajai Vikram Singh were accepted and being implemented. Rules governing payscales and promotions would be applicable across the services for women. 

 The question was asked because of anomalies resulting in a lady officer being asked to relinquish her rank as Lt Colonel.

 Pak fighters leave sour taste

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 3: Two issues have brought a sense of uneasiness into India-Pakistan relations.

 Delhi is bitter at the US decision to arm Pakistan with a fresh fleet of F-16 fighter jets over its objections, as well as Islamabads refusal to release 240 Indian fishermen after agreeing to do so.

 In a delayed response to the F-16 deal, which was made public last week, the ministry of external affairs said it was not conducive to the improvement of ties between Delhi and Islamabad.

 India had long been trying to block any sale of advanced fighter jets to Pakistan by the US. The foreign ministry spokesperson acknowledged that when the Prime Minister met President George W. Bush in Washington last July, the issue had cropped up and Manmohan Singh had conveyed his disappointment at Americas plans.

 The same month, however, Washington approved the shipment of two F-16s to Pakistan with a promise of more.

 Last week, the Bush administration cleared the sale of 18 new F-16s and 18 used planes as part of a $5-billion weapons deal. The defence department in Washington told the US Congress that the arms requested by Pakistan for the F-16s would not reduce Indias quantitative or qualitative military advantage.

 Delhi, however, is uncomfortable with the Pakistani wish list, which also includes five advanced medium-range, air-to-air missiles, training missiles, Sidewinder missiles, 500 joint direct-attack munitions, guidance kits and 1,600 enhanced guided bomb units.

 Delhi is also annoyed by Pakistans turnaround after agreeing to release 240 Indian fishermen at a ceremony at the Wagah border on June 30.

 India kept its part of the bargain by releasing 38 civilian Pakistani prisoners, but waited in vain for the 240 fishermen to be handed over. Pakistan informed the Indian officials that the fishermen would not be released until they had completed their sentences.

 Expressing disappointment at Pakistans decision, India said it had released many Pakistani civilian prisoners who had not served out their terms. India said it had handed over the latest batch of 38 as soon as their identity was confirmed. But Pakistan maintained that establishment of identity wasnt enough; the fishermen had to serve out their sentences.

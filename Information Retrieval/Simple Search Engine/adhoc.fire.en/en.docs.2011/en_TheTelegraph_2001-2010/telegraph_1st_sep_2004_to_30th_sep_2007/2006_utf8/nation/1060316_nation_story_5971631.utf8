 Air passengers seek legal rights, put safety first

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chennai, March 15: Worried by increasing aviation near-misses and poor airline services, a consumers body is drafting legal rights for air passengers which it hopes the Centre will enact into law.

 The Air Passengers Association of India (APAI) today alleged many pilots, especially foreign pilots, and cabin crew were poorly trained and said airlines must be forced to follow global safety norms.

 The increasing number of complaints from air passengers has exposed the need for? legal rights to help them claim compensation for deficiencies, APAI president D. Sudhakara Reddy said.

 The draft guidelines, similar to European law, will be ready by April. We have given it to some aviation experts for feedback?. We will submit it to the Union consumer affairs ministry to enable it to be legislated.

 Reddy cited civil aviation minister Praful Patels recent statement in Parliament that the year 2005 had witnessed 21 near-accidents compared with 13 in 2003 and 15 in 2004. He alleged that behind most of these were badly trained foreign pilots being indiscriminately recruited by the mushrooming low-cost airlines.

 He cited Air Deccans Coimbatore-Bangalore flight that skidded after landing a few days ago because of a snagged landing gear, injuring four passengers. The pilot was foreign, and the cabin crew were not prepared to handle even minor emergencies.

 As for the retirement age for pilots having been raised to 65 years, Reddy asked if research had been done to find out whether one is physically and mentally fit to pilot a plane at that age.

 The proposed passengers rights call for a safety audit on all airlines relating to recruitment procedures for foreign pilots and training of cabin crew, because it is doubtful if even the basic stipulations are being followed. The guidelines look to ensure that only the best foreign pilots are hired and a ceiling is fixed on their recruitment.

 Reddy cited several instances of poor services. One low-cost airline, he alleged, didnt allot seat numbers, sparking a rush for the best seats on the aircraft ? a race in which the elderly, women and children lost out.

 We have also received complaints that some airlines are insisting on a fee for provision of wheelchairs, etc., and this is totally against ethical practices. Some airlines are overcharging passengers for mineral water, he added.

 He cited the Bombay High Court contempt notice to Air-India officials for violating court orders regarding training and promotion of pilots.

 Air-India was also recently pulled up for flouting International Air Transport Association safety stipulations. India must have an independent flight safety board like Americas National Transportation Safety Board that should not be under the civil aviation ministry, Reddy said. A national aviation regulatory authority, too, should be formed.

 Recent near-misses include several flights skidding off the runway after landing, and burst or deflated tyres.

 Gulmarg decks up for winter gala

 Festive fever in skiers paradise

 Srinagar, Dec. 15: Make a snowman, go skating after dusk and soak in folk music at soirees if Gulmarg is on your holiday itinerary this winter, dont put the plan on ice.

 The skiers paradise in Kashmir is dolling up for its first-ever snow festival, which is expected to feature new sporting and cultural events high on Kashmiri flavour.

 The celebrations will unfold against the backdrop of a raging controversy over the planned sale of land in Gulmarg, a process that has been put on hold because of pressure from different groups, including some militant outfits.

 The six-day event will start from December 24. It is the first festival of its kind marked by new events. We have already roped in some foreign and national coaches to identify the best skiing spots, says Farooq Ahmad Lone, the CEO of Gulmarg Development Authority.

 Winter sports festivals were organised in the past, too, but this time there is an element of novelty. They (the festivals) would start in summer and continue until winter, but this time, several events are new, Lone said. 

 Sources in the states tourism department say the controversy over the sale of land in Gulmarg and the recent attack on tourists prompted them to launch a hard sell.

 Night skating, snow-sledging race and snow scooter race are new attractions. In a snowman competition, contestants, who have usually been tourists and students, mould the best face they can in a given time. Separate events for adults and children are planned, Lone said.

 Sarmad Hafiz, joint director of Jammu and Kashmir tourism, said the night skiing events will be possible after lights are installed in all of Gulmarg. We are doing that now. The purpose is to make the place more attractive, he said. Officials have also lined up what they call a White Christmas at a historic church in the resort.

 Gourmands will not have reason to be disappointed, either. A food festival is on the cards where scrumptious Kashmiri Wazwan and Kahwa will be served.

 Cultural events will take centre-stage, too. We are roping in Kashmiri folk artists to enthral guests, Hafiz said. 

 Lone says he is confident the festival will be a big success. We are expecting a large number of domestic and foreign tourists. We are already busy with bookings now.

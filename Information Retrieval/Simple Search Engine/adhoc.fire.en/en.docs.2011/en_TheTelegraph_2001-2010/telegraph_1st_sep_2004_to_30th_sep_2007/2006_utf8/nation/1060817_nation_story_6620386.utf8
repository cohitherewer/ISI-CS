The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Tough talk for Pak

 New Delhi, Aug. 16: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has warned Pakistan that unless it takes concrete steps to check cross-border terrorism, public opinion in India, which has supported the peace process, will be undermined.

 While he did not name the other neighbours, Singh underlined that they, too, must recognise that terrorism anywhere is a threat to peace and prosperity everywhere and must be confronted with our united efforts.

 Addressing the nation from the ramparts of Red Fort on Independence Day, Singh stressed that South Asia was a common cultural and economic unit, whose past and destinies are inter-linked.

 As the regions largest country, India, he said, was ready to give our neighbours a stake in our own prosperity and share the fruits of growth with them. 

 But he added that the dream of a South Asian community, unshackled by borders that allowed for an unhindered flow of goods and peoples, culture and ideas, could not be realised as long as terrorist violence and the politics of hate and confrontation cast their shadows.

 We are prepared to work together with all our neighbours to usher in an era of peace and prosperity for our peoples. We have taken several initiatives in this regard, in particular with Pakistan. To be successful, these initiatives need an atmosphere of peace, Singh said.

 For the Naxalites, Singhs message was: Power will never flow from the barrel of a gun. Real power flows from the ballot box.

 L.K. Advani, the leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, said the speech barely touched on the two crucial issues of the time terrorism and corruption.

 We in the Opposition have this complaint. In the two subjects the present government has lost its credibility. And the way the policies are going on, it will be difficult to win over the two, Advani told reporters yesterday.

 US locks up Lashkar aide

 K.P. NAYAR 

 Washington, Aug. 26: Even 

 as Islamabad continues to turn a blind eye to cross-border 

 terrorism on its soil, the Americans are tightening the 

 screws on Pakistani outfits engaging in anti-Indian activity.

 Lahore-born Ali Asad Chandia, a teacher at a Muslim school in Maryland, was yesterday sentenced to 15 years in prison for helping Mohammed Ajmal Khan, a military procurer for the Lashkar-e-Toiba, during his visits to the US and for helping him acquire equipment for possible use against India.

 Khan is currently serving a nine-year sentence in Britain for an unrelated terrorist offence.

 Chandia, 29, who migrated to the US in 1994 and acquired a degree in information systems before starting a teaching career, is one of 11 members of an American-Muslim terrorist cell which has come to be known here as the Virginia jihad network.

 The men, according to their indictment, are alleged to have used war-like paintball games to train in military tactics in Virginia and practised shooting in the Washington capital area and in nearby Pennsylvania.

 Their indictment also alleged that some of the defendants fired weapons at Indian positions in Kashmir, according to a statement by the US justice department.

 The arrest and prosecution of the gang followed intense pressure on America to act against Pakistani terror outfits during a visit by then deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani in June 2003.

 Advanis aides, then intelligence bureau director K.P. Singh and then home secretary K. Gopalaswami, had given unprecedented briefings to the then US attorney-general, John Ashcroft, and the then homeland security secretary, Tom Ridge, on Pakistans terror network.

 Within weeks, the Americans arrested members of the Virginia jihad network and the law has been taking its course since then.

 Chandia, according to the prosecution, travelled to Pakistan five years ago, attended Lashkar training camps and stayed in Pakistan for three months to work out arrangements for Khans subsequent visits to the US.

 Some members of the Virginia jihad network are alleged to have attempted to go to Afghanistan to join the Taliban in its fight against American troops. 

 The jury did not punish Chandia for attending the Lashkar camps but found him guilty of providing material support to Khan.

 Lashkar has been a US government-designated terrorist organisation since December 2001.

 SEZ consensus eludes Left

 BISWAJIT ROY

 Calcutta, Sept. 27: The CPM central committee has failed to finalise a policy on special economic zones (SEZ) that it was to suggest to the Centre following divisions within the ranks, mainly between the Bengal leadership and the partys trade union wing.

 The committees three-day deliberations that ended yesterday were also indecisive on jobs, compensation and rehabilitation of farmers displaced by the industrial drive.

 Leaders of the partys labour arm Citu, supported by some committee members from Kerala, opposed promoting the Bengal model as a national policy for SEZs as they found the state formula too compromising.

 But Bengal leaders made it clear they could not afford a policy that could scare away investors.

 Citu general secretary Chittabrata Majumdar said several opinions were expressed on the pros and cons of the partys SEZ policy. The final decision, he added, would be taken at the next meeting of the politburo, the partys highest decision-making body. 

 The politburo member said Bengals land-use plan for SEZs 50 per cent for industry, 25 per cent for related infrastructure, and the rest for commercial purposes that chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee articulated did not mention real estates, but other purposes. This means it (the remaining one-fourth) can be used for rehabilitating land-losers by setting up training centres, shops and markets for them, he said.

 Promoters cannot be allowed to use a single yard of farmland acquired by the government for real estate business.

 CPM state secretariat member Benoy Konar opposed him. We cannot accept whatever Citu says. We have to make compromises in view of the ground reality, he argued. Otherwise Bengal will not get investment.

 On jobs and compensation, Konar said there could be no precondition. Displaced people will get manual jobs and those who are eligible for training for industrial jobs will get that chance. Bengal industries minister Nirupam Sen also ruled out direct employment to land-losers. 

 But Majumdar said the party is yet to take a decision on the demand for jobs for land-losers. We have to consider many aspects before we reach a conclusion.

 There were also differences on enforcing labour laws in SEZs. While Citu is not ready to compromise on this, Konar said Bengal alone cannot enforce them. Otherwise we will lose capital inflow. quot;

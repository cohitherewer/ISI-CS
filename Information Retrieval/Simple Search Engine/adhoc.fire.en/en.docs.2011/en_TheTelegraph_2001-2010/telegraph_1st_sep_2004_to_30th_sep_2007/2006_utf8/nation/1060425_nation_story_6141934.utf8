 Panel picks holes in vaccine import

New Delhi (PTI): The genetic engineering approval 

committee has found that the drug controller general of India had permitted import 

of Chinese encephalitis vaccine without conducting necessary clinical trials.

The committee has said the Chinese vaccine could 

multiply in vector mosquitoes and recombine with local viruses, resulting 

in creation of recombinant viruses with unknown characteristics. As 

such, the drug controller general should have referred the matter to the committee 

in view of the associated environmental risks, the committee said in a statement 

on its website.

 The committee, which comes under the ministry of environment and forests, pointed out that the Environmental Protection Act covers not only recombinant products but also hazardous micro-organisms for which the committees clearance should be taken before import.

 Siblings reunite after 1947

Islamabad (PTI): Two Sikhs who fled to India 

during Partition were reunited with their sister living in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.

Jogindar Singh and Kesar Singh met sister Rabia in 

a village near Mirpur town of Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, thanks to the recent 

thaw in Indo-Pak relations.

 Rabia and her sister, Razia, were separated from their family during Partition in 1947. They later converted to Islam and settled down in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. Razia died a few years ago.

 Its a dream come true. We dont have words to express the bliss we feel today, Jogindar, 76, told Pakistani daily Dawn. It was my strongest desire to see her before I breathe my last, said 72-year-old Kesar Singh.

 Flag warrant

Indore (PTI): A local court has issued a non-bailable 

warrant against film producer J.P. Dutta for wrongly displaying the national flag 

over coffins in the film LoC Kargil.

The warrant was issued on a petition by Ravi Atrolia, 

the convener of Tiranga Abhiyan.

Ex-jawan shot

Varanasi (PTI): A retired army jawan was shot 

dead while he was taking a morning walk near his house on Monday. Ramchandra Yadav 

was 

fired from point-blank range by two motorcycle-borne assailants and died on way 

to hospital, police said.

Cows seized

Sonepat (PTI): Police intercepted a mini-truck 

carrying 16 cows to 

Uttar Pradesh for slaughter and arrested two persons in this connection. A case 

under the Cow Protection Act has been registered and further investigations are 

on.

 The Kashmir valley will be on the railway map by the end of the year with trains running from Anantnag to Rajvansher. Work on the Qazigund-Baramulla line is going on at a fast pace.

 Kidnap scent leads to Chambal ravines

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Anant

 Lucknow, Nov. 16: Three days after the son of Adobe India CEO Naresh Gupta was kidnapped yards from his home, the trail has led police from upscale Noida to the harsh ravines of Chambal.

 Three-year-old Anant may have been passed on for safekeeping to Jagjivan Ram Parihar, a Thakur dacoit carrying Rs 5.25 lakh on his head, the police of two states believe.

 A team of 22 policemen from Bhind-Morena in Madhya Pradesh and Etawah in Uttar Pradesh is scouring the ravines for Parihar and his gang of 32, accused of dozens of murders and armed robberies.

 Chambals bandit gangs, which keep themselves constantly on the move, are known to hold kidnapped minors in their custody for a share of the ransom. On the suspicion that Anant Gupta might be held hostage by Parihars gang, Noida and Etawah police contacted us, Chambal DIG D.C. Sagar said.

 Officers believe that the motorbike-borne kidnappers, who whisked Anant away as he waited for his school bus, are from a Ghaziabad gang that has links with Chambals dacoits. 

 We have recharged our intelligence network in the ravines. We are raiding all possible hideouts, including the dacoits dens in far-flung villages, said inspector-general of police, Kanpur, Rizwan Ahmed.

 Sources said Uttar Pradesh polices special task force had unearthed the first leads in the case yesterday. The STFs special superintendent, S.K. Bhagat, had then contacted the police chiefs of Etawah and Bhind.

 We have some vital clues but we cannot reveal them for the sake of the boys safety, Bhagat said.

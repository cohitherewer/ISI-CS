 Bapu hug lifts Uma

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Uma, Gandhi: Dream touch 

 Bhopal, June 21: So what if she is thoroughly isolated from her party and parivar, Uma Bharti has been keeping really good company.

 Over the past two years, the sadhvi has been talking to Mahatma Gandhi ? no less ? and has even managed a hug from him. All in her dreams, though.

 I said, Bapu, I would finish what you left unfinished but they would try to kill me. How can I save myself?

 Then I could see him hugging me with his frail hands.

 For Uma, who has floated the breakaway Bharatiya Janshakti Party since her expulsion from the BJP, the dreams are no joke. Lesser mortals can think otherwise, for her they are deeply significant.

 When I asked for its interpretation from an eminent priest of Kedarnath, he asked me what I was thinking about before going off to sleep. I told him I was thinking about the poor.

 Uma made another disclosure, too: she rated Gandhi higher than her ideological icons Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya and Shyama Prasad Mookerjee.

 That was not to say no one else influenced her. Lord Rama did, so did Lord Hanuman, Che Guevara and L.K. Advani, in that order.

 The fairytale touch in her dreams apart, Uma has not been having a great time. Not a single BJP MLA has joined her party ? her BJP, she likes to call it ? although she has been claiming as many as 173 are with her.

 Nor has her brother Swami Prasad Lodhi, who recently sent her a court notice announcing he would not sign up.

 Lodhi, now out on bail in a dacoity case in hometown Tikamgarh, said he and his family would soon vacate the house allotted to Uma as former chief minister.

 She may be my sister but I do not subscribe to her politics. I will live and die for the BJP, he said.

 Uma and her brother, 12 years older, have all along shared a blow-hot-blow-cool kind of relationship. Some of her well-wishers feel he was a key factor in her political downfall.

 When Uma was Madhya Pradesh chief minister, Lodhi was a constant source of embarrassment to her. She overruled then Prime Minister A.B. Vajpayees decision to appoint him head of a state-run corporation. Uma had to sack him for alleged financial irregularities and nepotism within a few months.

 Lodhi then turned hostile, claiming some of Umas ministers and advisers were taking hefty bribes for bureaucratic transfers and postings.

 Three years ago, Lodhi even toyed with the idea of joining the Congress and visited the state party office. But he patched up with Uma before the 2003 Assembly polls.

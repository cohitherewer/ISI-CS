 Karat cites Bengal as SEZ model 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Sept. 13: The Centre should follow the model of special economic zones (SEZ) adopted by Bengal, which has reserved 75 per cent of the area in these hubs for industrial and infrastructure firms, CPM general secretary Prakash Karat said here today. 

 The Union government, he said, favours setting aside 75 per cent of space in SEZs for commercial projects like malls, cinemas and housing.

 The CPM leader was speaking at the end of the partys politburo meeting, where the SEZ policy was among the issues discussed. There was concern, however, at the way huge chunks of land were being given away to promoters of SEZs elsewhere in the country. It was also felt that tax exemptions to these zones would result in a huge loss of revenues.

 The politburo has decided to take up this issue with the Centre so that changes can be made in the SEZ act, the CPM general secretary said.

 What the Bengal government is doing is correct. This should be the ideal model, he added. 

 Karat dismissed suggestions that the CPMs talk about farmland protection and acquisition of agricultural land for the Tata small car project in Bengal showed double standards. You cannot mix up two issues. I am told that 60 per cent of the farmers in Singur have voluntarily given their land and we need manufacturing units in Bengal, he said. 

 The plot set aside for an SEZ in Haldia by the Bengal government was low-lying and had saline soil not suitable for agriculture, Karat said.

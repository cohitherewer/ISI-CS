 Bengal to oppose SEZ farmland cap

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Nov. 16: The Bengal government today opposed the Centres 10 per cent ceiling on farmland within a proposed special economic zone, citing the scarcity of fallow land in the state.

 The Centre has hinted that it wouldnt allow agricultural land to make up more than 10 per cent of the area under a multi-product SEZs area.

 We will oppose this clause. In Bengal, most of the land is agricultural and less than 0.5 per cent is barren. Its not possible to have a large SEZ with only 10 per cent agricultural land in our state, commerce and industries secretary Sabyasachi Sen said.

 The statement comes at a time when the CPMs central leadership has set itself against the acquisition of multi-crop land for industry. Politburo member Sitaram Yechury had, however, said last week the party would work out an SEZ policy based on the national scenario leaving it to Bengal to deal with its unique situation.

 Wiser after the opposition it faced while acquiring 993 acres of farmland at Singur, the state government has decided against allowing multi-product SEZs near Calcutta.

 Land is scarce in districts near Calcutta which are also densely populated. So, they will be kept out of the (list of possible sites for) SEZs requiring big areas, Sen said.

 The West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation is struggling to find 4,500 acres for the Dankuni township project.

 WBIDC could not find the required land in Hooghly. There is an acute scarcity of land in these districts. Whatever little we are getting are scattered plots, which will not serve our purpose, Sen said.

 The state will now look to develop infrastructure in districts like Bankura, Purulia and Burdwan, and the whole of north Bengal. But small SEZs, especially IT-oriented ones, are not ruled out near the city. The government is worried about water scarcity, though.

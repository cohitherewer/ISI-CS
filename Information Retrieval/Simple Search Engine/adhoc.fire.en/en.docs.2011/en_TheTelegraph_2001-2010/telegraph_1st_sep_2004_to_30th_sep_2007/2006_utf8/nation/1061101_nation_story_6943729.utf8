 Legal boost to divestment

 Green signal

 New Delhi, Oct. 31: Upholding the sale of an ITDC-run hotel by the NDA government, the Supreme Court today said it found nothing wrong with the divestment policy.

 The court also rejected the demand of employees for a voluntary retirement scheme (VRS) in companies being sold off.

 In our view, the decision of the government to divest was a policy decision, which was not, in any manner, contrary to the law of the land, the bench of Justices A. R. Lakshmanan and A. K. Mathur said.

 The ruling came on a petition filed by the workers union and employees of Hotel Agra Ashok questioning its sale to Mohan Singh and Yamuna View Private Ltd.

 The government has ensured that it has got the best price for its shares. It is also pertinent to notice that it has not received any other higher offer, the judges said.

 The then government, they said, had followed all procedures: it accepted the recommendations of the Disinvestment Commission, which said it could sell 74 per cent or more of its shares in units of ITDC, a non-core area. 

 The government constituted the commission and accepted its recommendations. A decision was taken by an inter-ministerial group and the cabinet committee on disinvestment to divest each property individually rather than altogether or in groups, Justice Lakshmanan, who wrote the judgment for the bench, said.

 On VRS, the bench said safeguards on service conditions should be provided in the share-purchase agreement, adding that it is for the buyer to float such plans.

 It is clearly stated that the schemes do not confer any right whatsoever on any employee to have his request for voluntary retirement accepted, the judges said, citing a government circular on introduction of VRS.

 The Centre has ensured that the interests of the workmen in this particular hotel and in Balco whose divestment had been upheld by the apex court earlier have been fully protected, the judges said.

 PMO cites national interest 

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 New Delhi, Feb. 6: Slipping into damage-control mode on the Iran vote, the Prime Ministers Office (PMO) has maintained that the Left was fully apprised of Indias position before the Vienna meeting.

 Far from ignoring the allies, their view was factored in when India voted in favour of the resolution to report Irans controversial nuclear programme to the UN Security Council, sources said.

 In deference to the Lefts demand for a discussion in Parliament, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is expected to make a detailed statement on the first or second day of Parliament, which starts the budget session on February 16. A discussion in both Houses will follow soon thereafter.

 The Lefts view, as conveyed to the Prime Minister, was that India should go along with the stream of opinion emerging among the Non-Aligned Movement (Nam) members if voting became inevitable.

 Since the Nam block was split, the government went with the majority view expressed by six of the 16 member countries and voted in favour of the resolution. 

 The sources emphasised that these countries included Egypt, a founder of the Nam, Indonesia and Yemen.

 Left sources contested the Nam defence, saying the government was told that unless a consensus ? as different from a majority viewpoint ? evolved among the Nam countries, India should not do anything. 

 We made it clear (to the Prime Minister) that if the Nam comes up with a common resolution, we will not stand in the way. But there was no consensus, said a Left leader.

 Briefing a group of journalists, a government spokesperson referred to Singhs meeting with Left leaders Prakash Karat and D. Raja on January 30, where they were told that Indias position was dictated solely by national interest.

 By citing national interest, the government was referring to the need for safeguards against clandestine nuclear weapons programmes in the neighbourhood, which was aided and abetted, or at the least selectively ignored, by some signatories (like Iran) to the Non-Proliferation Treaty.

 The allusion was to the A.Q. Khan network, an euphemism for the nuclear black market allegedly run by the founder of Pakistans nuclear programme.

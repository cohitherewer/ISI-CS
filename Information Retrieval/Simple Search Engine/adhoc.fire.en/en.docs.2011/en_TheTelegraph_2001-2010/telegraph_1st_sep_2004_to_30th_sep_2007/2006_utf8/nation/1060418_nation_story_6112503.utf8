The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Richer than rival by Rs 2 crore

 Chennai, April 17: Karunanidhi may have lost several party members to the ADMK, but the DMK boss is still richer than Jayalalithaa, as far as his assets are concerned.

 A yellow shawl draped over his spotless white shirt and dhoti, DMK chief M. Karunanidhi filed his nomination for Chepauk Assembly constituency today.

 The details of his assets show that he is wealthier by about Rs 2 crore than his rival. The total moveable assets ? owned by him and his wives Dayalu Ammal and Rajathi Ammal ? are worth Rs 26.53 crore, marginally higher than the Rs 24.65 crore declared by ADMK chief Jayalalithaa. 

 On Karunanidhis assets list are fixed deposits worth Rs 5 crore in Indian Bank, Rs 2.50 lakh with the Tamil Nadu Industrial Development Corporation and Rs 2.71 lakh with the Tamil Nadu Power Finance and Infrastructure Development Corporation. 

 Karunanidhis wives assets include a deposit of Rs 12.50 crore in Dayalus name and a Rs 5 crore deposit in Rajathis name.

 However, the day did not begin on a bright note for the 82-year-old DMK boss, who has never lost an Assembly election in the 11 times he has contested since 1957. Sarath Kumar and Radhika, the actor couple who quit the DMK last week, formally joined ADMK this morning.

 God alone knows the reason, Karunanidhi quipped when asked about the stars switchover. I nonetheless wish Sarath and Radhika a prosperous future there (in the ADMK).

 Karunanidhis son M.K. Stalin, the DMKs youth wing leader, filed his nomination for the Thousand Lights constituency and separately declared his assets, which are valued at over Rs 1 crore.

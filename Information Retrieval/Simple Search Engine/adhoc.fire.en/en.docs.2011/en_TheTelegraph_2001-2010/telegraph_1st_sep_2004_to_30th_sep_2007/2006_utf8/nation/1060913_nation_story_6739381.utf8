 Politburo refuses talks on Basu

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Sept. 12: The CPM politburo today refused to discuss Jyoti Basus wish to step down from the partys highest policy-making body on the ground of advanced age. 

 Basu, in his nineties, attended both the morning and afternoon sessions of the politburo meeting but would not comment on the subject, apparently at the request of party top guns. 

 He had earlier told the media that he would like to step down as it was becoming increasingly difficult for him to attend politburo meetings, usually held at the CPM headquarters in Delhi, or to share its responsibilities. 

 Basu had said he would raise the issue at the meeting. He also wanted to discuss the induction of a new member from Bengal in place of the late Anil Biswas although this was not on the official agenda.

 Other members ruled out the possibility of Basu retiring but would not say if the partys seniormost leader had brought up the subject today. We did not discuss Basus retirement from the politburo. Neither are we going to discuss it as the party has already ruled it out, Citu president and politburo member M.K. Pandhe said. 

 Kerala chief minister V.S. Achuthanandan and his Tripura counterpart Manik Sarkar spoke in the same vein. As did Brinda Karat, the only woman in the politburo, and Bengal party secretary Biman Bose. 

 Senior leaders pointed to general secretary Prakash Karats description of predecessor Harkishen Singh Surjeet and Basu as living legends who would continue to be the partys guiding spirit.

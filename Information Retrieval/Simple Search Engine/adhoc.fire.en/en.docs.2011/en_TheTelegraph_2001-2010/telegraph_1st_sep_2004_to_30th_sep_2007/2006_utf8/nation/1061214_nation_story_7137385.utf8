 Heat on AIIMS selection system

 New Delhi (PTI): Questioning the selection 

 procedure of faculty members at AIIMS, a committee has said 

 senior doctors treating politicians and bureaucrats take 

 advantage of their contacts to get promotions.

 The four-member committee was formed after the AIIMS apex body recommended dismissal of its director P. Venugopal last July.

 Instances have been brought to our notice when legislators and influential persons in the government contact senior faculty members for health problems, and the faculty members, in turn, take advantage of their contact to influence their own selections and promotions, it said.

 The appropriateness of MPs taking part in the selection of faculty members needs reappraisal as such a practice is unheard of in any institution of national importance in India, said the committee. 

 Cover for unorganised sector 

 New Delhi (PTI): The government 

 plans to bring in a central legislation for providing social 

 security to workers in the unorganised sector during the 

 next session of Parliament.

 Labour and employment minister Oscar Fernandes said the Centre had set up 15 welfare funds for workers in unorganised sectors such as mines, iron ore and mica ore, but it did not cover the entire sector.

 Only 45 million workers are covered in this scheme, he said.

 The minister said the Centre had already upgraded 200 Indian Technical Institutes to international standards and was planning to upgrade another 300.

 This would help workers from the unorganised sectors get jobs not only in the country but also abroad, Fernandes said. 

 Anganwadi 

 New Delhi: The Supreme Court 

 has directed the Centre to sanction at least 14 lakh anganwadi 

 centres by 2008. 

 Directing sanction of an additional 3.5 lakh centres in the next two years, it said rural communities and slum clusters having 40 children under six should be entitled to an anganwadi on demand.

 Maoist attack 

 Raipur: Four security personnel 

 were killed when a group of around 250 Maoist rebels attacked 

 a relief camp in Chhattisgarhs Dantewada district 

 on Wednesday morning. The four were cooped up in a safety 

 bunker. 

 Girl death probe

 Thiruvananthapuram (PTI): 

 The Kerala government will probe the death of a teenaged 

 girl who reportedly died after being vaccinated at a Kozhikode 

 hospital on Tuesday. Roobishas death sparked protests 

 in the area. 

 Leopards at Mumbais Sanjay Gandhi National Park will be shifted

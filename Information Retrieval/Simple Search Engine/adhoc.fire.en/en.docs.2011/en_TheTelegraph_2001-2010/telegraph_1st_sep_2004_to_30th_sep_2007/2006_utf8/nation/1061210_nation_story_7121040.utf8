 Jakhar shoots off mouth

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Bhopal, Dec. 9: Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan must be a deeply worried man. After all, the governor has just threatened to shoot him.

 While nobody really knows if Balram Jakhar is a crack shot, the Congress veteran seems to have developed the habit of stunning his audience.

 Just a few days ago, he had invited the wrath of doctors for saying that those who amassed wealth through dishonest means would die of cancer. Today, the Madhya Pradesh governor regretted the Union governments approach towards farmers.

 Jakhar told a gathering in Bhopal that he was not at all happy with the report submitted by National Commission for Farmers chairman M.S. Swaminathan and had conveyed his unhappiness to the Prime Minister.

 But it was Jakhars remarks at a function yesterday that rattled the ruling BJP.

 The governor said he had asked the chief minister to set time-bound targets. I have made it clear to Shivraj that it is time to work. Fix a target for every task. If you need 10 days, I will give 15, but after that I will not ask you why it was not done. I will shoot you. By shooting I mean I will sack you.

 Chauhan was on tour abroad, probably why he didnt return the fire, but power minister Kailash Vijayvargya did. It is unbecoming of such a person, Vijayvargya said. Achchha nahin lagta (it doesnt look good).

 Jakhar today tried to make amends, saying he did not mean to literally shoot the chief minister. In his clarification, the former Lok Sabha Speaker said he might be rustic but not silly. The governor explained that what he meant was he would fix responsibility and would like the chief minister to fire officials who obstruct development work.

 The Congress is not amused. Senior state leaders said Jakhar was unnecessarily raking up controversy. A former Union minister said Jakhar should avoid commenting on an eminent agricultural economist like Swaminathan.

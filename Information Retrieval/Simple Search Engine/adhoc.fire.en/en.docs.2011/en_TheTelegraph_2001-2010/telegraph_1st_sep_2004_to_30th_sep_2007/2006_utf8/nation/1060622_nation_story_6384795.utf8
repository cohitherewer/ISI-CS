 HPCL hope for gas corp

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, June 21: Public sector oil company Hindustan Petroleum Corporation may take over the ailing Greater Calcutta Gas Supply Corporation, Bengal commerce and industries secretary Sabyasachi Sen said today.

 We have been talking to them for the last few months. HPCL has carried out a due diligence on the company. They will submit a report to us shortly, Sen added.

 Greater Calcutta Gas Supply Corporation was earlier called Oriental Gas Company Undertakings, the first company to illuminate the streets of Calcutta in 1857.

 It now procures gas from Coal Indias Dankuni coal complex to serve small industrial units in parts of Calcutta and Howrah and a handful of domestic consumers.

 Availability of gas has been a problem, which has resulted in the company incurring losses. A large pool of workers has not helped its cause either.

 The Bengal government, which owns the company, has been trying to sell it off for some time. 

 It held talks with another public sector unit, GAIL, to hand over the loss-making unit but the negotiations fell through.

 Sen said the company would be viable if the gas supply could be ensured.

 There are three proposals on bringing natural gas into Bengal. 

 GAIL plans to lay a pipeline from Jagdishpur in Uttar Pradesh to Haldia and Calcutta. Along with ONGC, it is also planning to bring offshore gas from Myanmar through an overland pipeline to the state.

 Reliance is setting up a pipeline to fetch gas from the Mahanadi basin off the Orissa coast.

 Once natural gas is adequately available, Greater Calcutta Gas Supply Corporation can build a modern network in the city in line with Mumbai and Delhi, which have elaborate compressed natural gas networks for automobile and piped natural gas for domestic, commercial and industrial users.

 Pak sets term on Indian TV ban

 Islamabad, Jan 21: Overriding protests from thousands of cable operators and viewers countrywide, the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (Pemra) says it will not lift the ban on popular Indian channels till the cable industry has been brought under its regulatory regime.

 We will not allow cable operators to show Indian channels before they accept Pemras regulatory regime, the authoritys spokesman, Muhammad Saleem, said in Islamabad. His comments came in the backdrop of a transmission shutdown by most cable operators in Karachi in protest against what they called Pemras obduracy.

 The Cable Operators Association of Pakistan had on Thursday issued an ultimatum to the government that transmissions would be stopped across southern Sindh province from Monday if the ban on Indian and other channels was not withdrawn.

 Pemra had last month banned some 35 Indian and South African channels and asked cable operators to bring themselves into the regulatory regime, which will generate additional revenues and curb piracy. Pemra has so far declared 64 foreign channels eligible for public viewing.

 The Indian channels banned by Pemra include the most popular ones, such as STAR Plus, STAR Utsav, B4U Movies, Zee Music, Zee Cinema and Sony Max.

 Most viewers are annoyed by the governments ban, which has denied them the pleasure of watching their favourite serials, such as Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi, Shano Ki Shaadi, Kumkum, Baa Bahoo Aur Beti and Kahaani Ghar Ghar Kii.

 Before the ban, almost all the cable operators were beaming Indian channels on their subscribers demand. 

 There are about 4,000 registered cable operators in the country. The business had earlier hit a slump in 2003, when the government had banned Indian channels to counter Indian propaganda.

 Pemra, however, is unable to take action against the large number of cable operators illegally airing Indian channels because of a staff shortage.

 We cannot take action against all the cable operators as our resources are limited, Pemra secretary Mukhtar Ahmad admitted in Islamabad.

 Ahmad said many cable operators were also violating rules by broadcasting Indian movies on their own CD channels.

 The authority will take action against them once it has proof, he added.

 A cable operator in Islamabad said: The Pemra authorities gave us 48 hours last month to stop (airing) the Indian channels until further directives from the government, and confiscated our equipment after 24 hours on allegations of broadcasting Indian channels.

 He added that cable operators who had stopped broadcasting Indian channels were worried because they were losing clients.

 We are under tremendous public pressure to relay Indian channels, and we receive hundreds of calls every day, he said.

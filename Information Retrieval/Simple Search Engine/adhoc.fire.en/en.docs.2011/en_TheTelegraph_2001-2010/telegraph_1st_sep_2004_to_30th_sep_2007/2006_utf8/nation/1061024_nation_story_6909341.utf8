 Salem posters sprout in UP

 Lucknow, Oct. 23: Hes all over town, kurta-clad and wishing them happy Diwali and Id. The political statement is hard to miss, as is the buzz that the don is getting ready for a shot at elections.

 Abu Salem has sneaked into Mubarakpur through 50,000 posters that have sprouted in this eastern Uttar Pradesh weaver-town not far from his home in Azamgarh.

 Temple visits and piety might be Sanjay Dutts way to beat the blues ahead of judgment day. Salem, accused in the same Bombay blasts that snared the Munnabhai do-gooder, prefers to chart life beyond his Arthur Road cell.

 Mubarakpur, famous for its exquisite Benarasi sarees, might just help Salem weave his political dream. The posters, at least, are leaving nothing to chance even a possible conviction by the anti-terror court in Mumbai.

 Hum ahale Hind hai, seene me sher ka dil rakhe hai, agar saath mila apka, to rukh toofan ka mor sakte hai, vatan ki abru bachayenge, hum ek khushaal Bharat banayenge (I am a true Indian, I have the heart of a lion, if I get your support I can change the path of a hurricane, will save the countrys dignity and turn it into a happy India), he holds forth in his posters.

 He wanted to go there himself, but could not make it as hes in jail. So he sent posters on his behalf, Harjot Singh, Salems lawyer, said.

 The dons name is missing from Mubarakpur electoral rolls, though a battery of lawyers is trying to find ways to put him on the list. The sword of conviction hangs, too.

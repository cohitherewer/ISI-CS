 Friday prayer cloud on Bhojshala

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Bhopal, Jan. 22: The Bhojshala shrine in Dhar has become the centre of a fresh dispute.

 This time, the tussle is over which of the two communities ? Hindus or Muslims ? should have the permission to pray on Friday February 3. It is Basant Panchami on that day, but also the jumma prayer day for Muslims. 

 According to the present arrangement, the Archaeological Survey of India, which looks after the monument, permits Hindus to perform yagnas on Basant Panchami and Muslims the right to hold Friday prayers. Hindus are also permitted to visit the shrine on Tuesdays. On other days, an entry fee of Re 1 has to be paid by all visitors. 

 Muslims believe that the 11th century shrine is a mosque while Hindus believe it to be an ancient temple of Goddess Saraswati. The shrine has been witness to communal clashes in recent years. 

 These days, beneath a semblance of calm, some community leaders are itching to get even. The Muslim leaders feel that they alone should have free access to the shrine on February 3. But the belligerent Hindu Jagran Manch wants the Muslims to give way as Basant Panchami falls only once a year. 

 Also, the timing for the proposed yagna is close to the afternoon prayer time for Muslims. The local administration is trying to prevail upon the minority community to pray at another mosque about a kilometre from the disputed site on Basant Panchami, but the communitys leaders are unwilling to make any concession. 

 Director-general of police Swaraj Puri said: All efforts will be made to maintain peace. We are holding a composite dialogue with local leaders to avoid any confrontation.

 So far it was hunger

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Feb. 18: Nandurbar, the district in Maharashtra which has reported the first suspected case of bird flu in the country, is otherwise infamous for malnutrition deaths of hundreds of children every year. 

 The states northern-most district, bordering Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh, Nandurbar has a 67 per cent tribal population.

 Nandurbar city and Navapur taluka are the only developed blocks in the neglected district carved out in July 1998. Spread across 5,035 sq km, it has one big industry and 344 small-scale units. 

 Navapur, 60 km from the district headquarters, where the bird flu has been reported, owes its development to more than 55 poultry farms. About 15 are big farms with over one lakh birds each. Navapur supplies chicken to Mumbai and Surat.

 Local sources said that in the past few days, over one lakh birds have died. But Nandurbar collector Jayant Gaikwad maintained that only 27,000 birds had died in the past 10 days after coming down with RD Virus, also called the Ranikhet virus. Migratory birds are suspected to have brought the virus.

 This is the first time bird deaths have been reported on such a large scale here, but Nandurbar hits the headlines each year for deaths of malnourished children.

 A three-month survey by the Punarvasan Sangharsh Samiti in the backward Akkalkuwa taluka found that 98 children had died between April and June 2005, 71 of them of malnutrition. It recorded 188 severely malnourished children in April. Of 349 mothers surveyed, 233 were malnourished.

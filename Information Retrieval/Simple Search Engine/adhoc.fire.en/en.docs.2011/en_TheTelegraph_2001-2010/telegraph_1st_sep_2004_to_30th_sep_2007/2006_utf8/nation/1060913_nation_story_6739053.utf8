 For healers, wounds are still raw

 ANANYA SENGUPTA

 Mumbai, Sept. 12: The healers of the 1993 blasts physical wounds still carry the mental scars of that terrible Friday when wailing victims and maimed bodies overran wards in gut-wrenching scenes of death and devastation.

 One of those for whom the line where job ended and duty began got blurred was Surekha Paralkar, a KEM Hospital nurse who did not go home for 10 days.

 I was on the way to my Elphinstone home when I heard about the blasts. I rushed to the hospital and saw bodies everywhere, she sighs, her eyes welling up at the horrifying memories of that day.

 Paralkar remembers senior colleagues and doctors telling her to keep all operation theatres open as dazed, blood-smeared people were wheeled in, crying and screaming.

 It cannot be described in words. It was so sad and gruesome. Bodies lay everywhere and I was just thankful that our staff, including the sweepers and the other hands, did their job to perfection. That made our task as doctors much easier, says Nirmala P. Barse, deputy dean of Sion Hospital.

 Although Barse was much junior then, the day is still fresh in her mind. I was on a long leave. But since I live nearby, I was called to duty. As I rushed to the hospital, I could only assume what happened. Reality hit me when I saw the bodies being brought in.

 For a majority of Mumbais doctors and healthcare workers, nothing has ever challenged them professionally and emotionally the way the March 12 mayhem did.

 People who were brought in didnt understand why it had happened to them. Many thought they would be attacked inside the hospital. Most Muslim victims were so insecure! We tried telling them we were there to help, but the fear did not die, recalls nurse Anuradha Parade.

 Barse says hospitals are almost always equipped to handle over 100 emergency patients at a time, but can never be prepared emotionally for a tragedy like that. The suffering of the common man was beyond anything I have seen. I dont remember what I did on the spot, because at that time you dont stop to think.

 Parade agrees. Treatment is more important. I blocked out everything else. There were people we had discharged who came back wounded in the riots outside, she recalls.

 Few remember individual cases but most of those who had helped the victims complain that justice has come too late for those who lost their loved ones in the blasts.

 There were so many unknown bodies that I brought in. I dont know what happened to them. I can only imagine the condition of their relatives: they must still be thinking that one day theyll come back, says Karim, an ambulance driver.

 The only case I can recollect is of this cash-clutching, wounded young girl. We helped her and after her treatment, we tried to locate her family. I remember thinking, what has this girl done to deserve this, says Paralkar.

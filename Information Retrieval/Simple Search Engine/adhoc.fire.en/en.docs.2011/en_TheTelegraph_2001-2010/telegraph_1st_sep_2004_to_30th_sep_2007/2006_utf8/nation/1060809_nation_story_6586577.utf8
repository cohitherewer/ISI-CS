 Hoax call triggers Bangla plane scan

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Aug. 8: A hoax 

 call warning of RDX on board two planes from Dhaka sent 

 airport authorities into a tizzy and prompted emergency-like 

 searches on other aircraft from Bangladesh this evening.

 The 1.45 pm call was received by an assistant commissioner of customs, who was told that there was RDX on two flights from Dhaka BG 091 and BG 093. 

 But the first had already arrived and left Calcutta airport safely in the morning before the call came. The second had been cancelled, an airport official said. 

 Soon after the call, the airports bomb-threat committee held a two-hour emergency meeting. It was decided that though one of the planes had left and another was cancelled, the exercises would be carried out on two other flights from Bangladesh, said an official who attended the meeting. 

 When Bimans BG 697 from Chittagong landed amid full-emergency drill at 4.15 pm, officials from the bomb detection and disposal squad, Central Industrial Security Force and the fire brigade ringed the Fokker Friendship 28. It was ordered to an isolated bay on the tarmac, its passengers were evacuated and their luggage checked with the help of sniffer dogs. Some were also questioned.

 Clearance for the return flight was given around 7 pm after nothing suspicious was discovered. 

 Another plane from Bangladesh that arrived late in the night was also checked but allowed to go back after nothing was found to be amiss, officials said. 

 Efforts to trace the hoax call are under way.

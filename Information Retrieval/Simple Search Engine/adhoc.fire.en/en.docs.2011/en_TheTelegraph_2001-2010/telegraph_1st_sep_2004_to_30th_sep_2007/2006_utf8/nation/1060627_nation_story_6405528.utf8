 Peace talks push travel across Pak border

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 26: The governments of India and Pakistan may continue to bicker during meetings to settle contentious issues but people are enjoying the fruits of the peace process ? as many as 1.7 lakh citizens from both sides have travelled across the border by bus, train and air this year.

 Figures issued by the ministry of external affairs show that air travel is most preferred. Indian Airlines and Pakistan International Airways together ferried 83,994 passengers. The two airlines have regular flights linking Delhi and Mumbai with Lahore and Karachi. 

 Train travel came next, with officials saying that Thar Express, which runs weekly between Munabao in Rajasthan and Khokrapar in Pakistan, is becoming popular by the day. When it was started in March this year, there would be only 200 passengers on a train. The figure has now jumped to 700-800. 

 The bi-weekly Samjhauta Express between Lahore and Amritsar, which has been running for long, continues to take much of the train load. Between them, the two trains carried 47,697 passengers. Once the consulates in Mumbai and Karachi are opened, Thar Express could get more passengers, officials said. 

 Bus services that have opened recently on various routes across the Line of Control and the international border ferried 8,013 people. 

 The number of people who crossed the border on foot was as high as 28,425, most of whom went through Wagah, with only 903 using posts created at locations on the LoC. 

 The review of travellers was conducted at the end of the third round of the composite dialogue, in the wake of criticism from across the border that the talks have achieved little.

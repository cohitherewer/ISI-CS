 Octopussy hotel in feud tentacles

 The Shiv Niwas palace

 New Delhi, Nov. 12 (PTI): 

 The opulent Shiv Niwas palace that once hosted Queen Elizabeth 

 II and featured in a James Bond film is at the centre of 

 a family row over valuation of the property, now a luxury 

 hotel.

 Yogeshwari Kumari, the daughter of the last king of Mewar Bhagwat Singh, has filed a petition before the Company Law Board accusing her brother Arvind Singh Mewar and top management officials of undervaluing the hotel and mismanaging the company.

 The matter has been posted for hearing in the last week of November.

 Located near Lake Pichola in Udaipur, the hotel figured in the film Octopussy. It has also played host to several celebrity weddings.

 When hotelier Sant Chatwal invited everyone from Bill Clinton to Naomi Campbell for his sons lavish wedding last February, Shiv Niwas hosted some of the ceremonies.

 The pool deck at the hotel had earlier been the site of the mehndi ritual when actress Raveena Tandon married film distributor Anil Thadani in royal Rajasthani style.

 Yogeshwari said her father had willed the property to the Maharana Mewar Institutional Trust and appointed Arvind as the executor of his will. She said she was given 25 per cent stake in the property and her brother 10 per cent, but he was attempting to take over the management of the company. Arvind has denied the charge.

 Appealing to the Company Law Board to quash the valuation, Yogeshwaris counsel has made Arvind, the chairman and MD of Lake Shore Palace Ltd that administers the hotel, one of the respondents.

 With this amount (Rs 12 crore), we cannot even buy a flat in the golf links area of Delhi, Yogeshwaris counsel said, adding that she has no faith in the auditor.

 The valuation was undertaken as part of an agreement between the brother and sister, under which Yogeshwari was to dispose of her shares in Lake Shore Palace. 

 She alleged that the company was now effectively under her brothers control and that she had not interfered in its affairs since 1999. Arvind was using his position as executor of their fathers will to increase his stake (in the company), the counsel said.

 Arvind has leased out some of his personal property to the company and now the funds are flowing down the line... instead of going back to the trust, the complaint said.

 The dispute first came to a boil in 1989 when Arvind allotted additional shares of the company to himself while giving nothing to the trust, which originally had 50 per cent shares, and his sister.

 Bardhan missive to PM on docs

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 30: In a letter to the Prime Minister, CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhan has said Indian doctors in the UK and Europe were being made victims of racial and geographical preferences by implementing new rules that can stop them from practising their profession. 

 The CPI has requested Manmohan Singh to take up the issue with the British government as the career of about 7,000 doctors was at stake.

 Bardhan said the British governments insistence on work permits for the doctors went against the British home office order issued in March. He said it was acknowledged that Indian doctors were invaluable to the UKs National Health Service (NHS).

 The CPI leader has suggested that the new terms should not be put into force for another five years so that medical practitioners in postgraduate courses can complete their studies. It should also apply only to doctors who seek registration with the UK Medical Council fully knowing about the new conditions, he said.

 Bardhan has urged Singh and the ministries of external affairs and health to seek restoration of the Permit Free Training visa. The Blair government has been proposing to cancel it from July without notice or information to the doctors concerned, he said.

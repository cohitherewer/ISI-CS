 Rape U-turn on MPs

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 22: A woman who had accused two MPs, including Sonia Gandhis political secretary, of sexually assaulting her with the connivance of a member of the National Commission for Women today withdrew her petition before the Supreme Court.

 The woman, who had sought a CBI probe to verify her allegations against Ahmed Patel, Shahid Akhlaq and womens commission member Yasmin Abrar, told the court she didnt want to pursue her case because of changed circumstances.

 The writ petition was dismissed as withdrawn by a vacation bench headed by Justice A.R. Lakshmanan.

 The application for withdrawal of the petition, however, did not mention how the circumstances had changed. Though the petition had been numbered by the apex court registry, it was yet to be listed for hearing.

 The petitioner had alleged that she was kept confined in Yasmins official residence in Delhi, where she was sexually assaulted by several persons, including Patel and Meerut MP Akhlaq.

 She said Yasmin had brought her and a minor girl to Yasmins residence last December from Snehalaya, a home for women. The petitioner had earlier approached the womens commission as her sepoy husband had left her and remarried.

 She alleged she was repeatedly raped at Yasmins home. The minor girl was exhibited before several people, but wasnt sexually exploited.

 The petition said she managed to escape with the girl in March this year but was arrested and charged with kidnapping, allegedly at Yasmins behest. Delhi High Court granted her bail in the kidnapping case in May.

 The petitioner had also sought a directive from the apex court to the Centre and the womens commission to protect the dignity of women seeking asylum in protected homes like Snehalaya.

 She had sought protection for herself, saying there was a danger to my life and liberty from Yasmin, the police and local politicians involved in the alleged sex racket.

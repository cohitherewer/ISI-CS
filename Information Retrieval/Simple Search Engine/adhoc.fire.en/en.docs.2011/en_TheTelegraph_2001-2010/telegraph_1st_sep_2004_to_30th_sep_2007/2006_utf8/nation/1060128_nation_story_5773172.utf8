 Hollywood? Hells better

 Shahrukh: No place like home

 New Delhi, Jan. 27 (PTI): Actor Shahrukh Khan would prefer to rule in Bollywood than serve in Hollywood. 

 It is better to rule in hell than to serve in heaven, even if that (Hollywood) is considered heaven. I think they also make films as we do. I think I dont pertain to that. I would rather make a good film here than go to Hollywood, the actor said in an interview with Aaj Taks Seedhi Baat. 

 Asked why Indian films fail to win Oscars and Golden Globes, Khan, whose film Paheli is the Indian entry for the Academy Awards, said: The jury there has a mindset and we need to understand that if we want to win awards. It is high time we win awards there. Like we get foreign coaches to train Indian players, we should get some consultants who can share their thoughts on what kind of movies can win awards. 

 Khan believes better stars will follow once we decide to take a backseat. An Aaj Tak release quoted him as saying: If I try to work for so long as Amitabh Bachchan has done, how will these new kids get a chance to take centre-stage? 

 The actor believes knowledge can help the new generation of actors to do better. I think for the new stars who want to do well in the long run education is a must. One should have the knowledge, which helps one grow, he said. 

 Asked about his relationship with the Gandhi family, the self-confessed admirer of Congress chief Sonia Gandhi said: I am an apolitical person and my every relationship is personal and not political.

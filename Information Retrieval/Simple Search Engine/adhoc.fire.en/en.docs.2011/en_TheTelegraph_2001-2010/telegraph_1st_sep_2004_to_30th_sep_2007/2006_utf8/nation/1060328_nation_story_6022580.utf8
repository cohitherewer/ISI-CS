 Bharti bristles for fight with Sonia

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 27: The mere mention of Sonia Gandhis name is enough to unite even the bitterest enemies in the Sangh parivar. 

 While the RSS and the BJP today distanced themselves from Sangh ideologue M.G. Vaidyas praise of Sonia in a signed editorial yesterday, expelled BJP leader Uma Bharti (in picture) temporarily halted her hysterical tirade against the BJP in a bid to attack the Congress president.

 The decision, taken in the wake of the controversy on office of profit, is a clever move and reflects her (Sonias) maturity in politics, Vaidya had written.

 RSS sources said Sangh sarkaryavah Mohanrao Bhagwat has conveyed his displeasure to Vaidya about his article. BJP spokesperson Prakash Javdekar also reiterated that the article did not reflect the BJPs official stand on Sonias resignation from the Lok Sabha and the National Advisory Council.

 But Uma went to the extent of demanding support from the BJP in her crusade against Sonia. She wrote to BJP president Rajnath Singh urging him to support her candidate against Sonia in Rae Bareli.

 Uma is to float a political party on April 30. She has been expelled from the BJP.

 The byelection in Rae Bareli is expected to take place only after Uma has formally launched her party. In that event, I would certainly put up a candidate against Sonia. The candidate would most likely be a woman. I expect the BJP to support me in this endeavour, said Uma.

 Along with Sushma Swaraj, Uma was the original Sonia-baiter in the BJP. 

 Before Sonia abdicated the Prime Ministers chair, Uma and Sushma spearheaded the BJPs campaign against the Congress chief. 

 Sushma threatened to shave her head and sleep on the floor wearing sack cloth if Sonia became the Prime Minister. 

 Uma pledged to go on a swabhiman yatra, probably because she had already shaved her head in Tirupati prior to the Lok Sabha election results. 

 Her fellow travellers on this proposed yatra were K.N. Govindacharya, Subramaniam Swamy and George Fernandes.

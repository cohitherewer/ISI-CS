 Finally, gloves off on Left

 Kozhikode, April 24: In the political heartland of Kerala, theres no time for niceties.

 With the Congress fighting with its back to the wall, Sonia Gandhi today slipped off the velvet gloves and tore into the Left, though not forgetting to label them our friends.

 Our Left friends practise the politics of confrontation, obstruction and violence in Kerala, Sonia told an election rally as she breezed through the northern districts where the second phase of polling will be held on April 29.

 Sonia called the Left our political opponents who have a negative agenda. They say one thing in power and do another when out of power? they have double standards.

 The Congress central leaders, including Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, had so far been reluctant to launch a frontal assault on the Left, the Congresss principal opponent in Kerala.

 Singh went so far as to describe the Left as our valuable allies at a media conference soon after a round of campaigning. Sonia, too, had proceeded with caution when she campaigned in the Left-ruled Bengal, targeting the quality of governance but scrupulously avoiding naming the CPM or any other Left party.

 However, with exit polls painting a grim picture for the ruling Congress-led United Democratic Front alliance in Kerala, the local leadership seemed to have convinced Sonia on the need to change the strategy.

 Besides, the districts she toured today are politically polarised. Any perceived softness on the leaderships part towards the Left would have confused the Congresss supporters here and helped the Left tighten the screws.

 If thin crowds had greeted her in the southern districts last week, people in north Kerala turned out in good numbers, cheering her as she went hammer and tongs at her Communist allies.

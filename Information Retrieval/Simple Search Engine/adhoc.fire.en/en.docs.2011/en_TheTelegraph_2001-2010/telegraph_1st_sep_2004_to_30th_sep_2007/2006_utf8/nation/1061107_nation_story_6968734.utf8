 Cops crow, gang kills

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Bhopal, Nov. 6: Dreaded dacoit Rambabu Gadaria killed five Gujjars last night at Karyara village in Shivpuri district. The attack came even as various units of Madhya Pradesh police were squabbling to claim credit for having felled Dayaram Gadaria, the gangs chief.

 A note from Rambabu taking responsibility for the murder of Ashok Gujjar (22), Ramraj Gujjar (17), Suresh Gujjar (23), Bunty (17) and Bunty (18) was found on their bodies. The gang claimed they were police informers.

 The note raised a question mark on the polices claim that they had eliminated mastermind Dayaram. On August 5, they had said the bandit, carrying a reward of Rs 500,000, was killed. Though his body hasnt been found, the special task force, police officials of Shivpuri and Gwalior and informers say they deserve the reward.

 But last nights killings may halt the flood of claims. Minister of state for home Nagender Singh said action would be taken against police officials responsible for yesterdays lapse.

 Singh today said the police would have to explain how the incident took place in spite of the retaliation that had been expected after reports of Dayarams death. Were supposed to be on high alert. Now we need to find out how such a dastardly act could take place.

 Gwalior range inspector-general of police, Sarabhjeet Singh, said Dayarams name figured on top of the note in which the Gadaria gang claimed responsibility for the killings. However, Singh believed that this could be Rambabus ploy to hoodwink the police.

 Gadarias have a history of getting killed in encounters only to rise from the dead with more killings and destruction. In 1999, Ashok Bhadoria, a sub-inspector in Shivpuri, claimed to have killed Rambabu and Dayaram. That earned him a promotion and a cash reward, but he got a demotion the next year when the men claimed to have been felled were arrested in Gwalior. 

 Police said the Gadaria gang specialises in pakad, the word used in the ravines of Chambal to describe a type of abduction.

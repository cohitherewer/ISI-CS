 Panel asked not to add defence count

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mukherjee: On guard

 New Delhi, Feb. 21: The government today defended setting up the Justice Rajinder Sachar committee to find out the social status of Muslims in the country, but clarified that a headcount in the defence forces would not be part of the exercise.

 The government has told the committee that it wants to keep the armed forces out of the survey, defence minister Pranab Mukherjee told the Rajya Sabha today.

 The armed forces are professional, apolitical, secular and the most disciplined force the country has today.... We would not like to include (them) in such a type of survey, (but) in the case of other departments and ministries, such a study will continue, he said

 The UPA government has been facing a lot of flak from the Opposition, which feels the survey would threaten the secular nature of the forces. The minister said the navy has given information about its civilian personnel and the air force, too, had provided some data to the committee, but the army did not respond.

 The defence secretary has told the panel that recruitment in the armed forces is based on merit and is open to every Indian citizen, he said. 

 Mukherjee pointed to a plaque in his South Block office that bears the words of a soldier. It says I have no religion, no caste and even when I pray to God, it is for asking for strength to discharge my duty for the nation.

 Responding to criticism that the UPA was trying to drive a wedge between communities, the minister said the Centre wants to know why Muslims are socially backward and if there is any need for state intervention. 

 Seeking a clarification on the statement, BJP leader Sushma Swaraj said the Centre had appointed the committee only for Muslims though other minority groups and weaker sections were also suffering.

 The minister replied that the Mandal Commission and the SC/ST Commissions had been constituted specifically to address problems faced by disadvantaged groups.

 The UPA, however, got vociferous support from the Left. CPMs Brinda Karat said the communal forces were scared to see the true picture of Muslim representation as it would dent their hate campaigns.

 No early hearing

 The Supreme Court today turned down a request for an early hearing of the petition filed by former deputy army chief Lt Gen. R.S. Kadyan, seeking a directive to the government to stop the survey.

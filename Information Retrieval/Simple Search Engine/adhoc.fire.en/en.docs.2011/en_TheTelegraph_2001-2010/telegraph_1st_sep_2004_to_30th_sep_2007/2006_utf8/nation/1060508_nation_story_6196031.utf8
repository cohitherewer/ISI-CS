 Bengal on special list 

 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY

New Delhi, May 7: The Centre is toying with 

a proposal to move on from special economic zones towards China-type special investment 

regions, and Bengal is one of the states shortlisted for the trial run.

 A special investment region (SIR) will essentially be a special economic zone (SEZ) covering a much larger area, having all incentives ? relaxed labour and financial laws and tax holidays ? given to the zones plus more. A special economic zone usually confines itself to around 200 acres but a special investment region will be spread over at least 2,500 acres. 

 In China, entire provinces are designated investment regions but in India, the pilot projects will focus on specific districts.

 The first SIRs are proposed in petrochemicals and polymers. The region around the Haldia SEZ in Bengal, where a petrochemical plant exists, will be among the first to be developed if the proposal is green-lighted.

 Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh are the other states where the experiment will be tried out. The Haldia SIR will extend over large parts of Midnapore district and will ultimately include the Haldia SEZ.

 The Prime Ministers Office has asked the Planning Commission to work out the final draft of the proposal, which is likely to be ready soon after the Assembly polls are over.

 Officials connected with the shortlisting process said the states had been picked based on their potential to become global business hubs. Each of them had made a presentation.

 Sources said the SIR proposal was first placed before Prime Minister Manmohan Singh by a group of NRI CEOs a year ago. They suggested that India follow the Chinese model of huge SIRs instead of small SEZs.

 Land acquisition rules for SIRs will be simpler, unlike in the case of SEZs where all the land has to be acquired by the state government. The state will merely notify a particular region as an SIR and leave it to private parties to buy land within the zone directly from the owners.

This can be done through special purpose vehicles 

(a shell company that can borrow money cheap from the government).

 Once the petrochem and polymers region is through, we will replicate this example by merging the numerous SEZs in larger specialist SIRs with better and more liberal rules and regulations governing them, an official said. The idea is to learn from the drawbacks of the small special zones and create a better deal for industry.

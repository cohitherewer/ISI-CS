 Net wedding stops at LoC

 Jammu, May 14 (PTI): A Mumbai girl who tried to cross into Pakistan to be with her husband has found to her dismay that love does have boundaries after all.

 Asha Patel, 24, and her friend Asha Sharma, 22, who is from Haldwani in Uttaranchal, were detained while attempting to cross the Line of Control at Chakan-da-Bagh in Poonch district of Jammu and Kashmir yesterday, army spokesman Col D.K. Badola said today.

 The two girls were taken into custody and handed over to police at Poonch, he said.

 Asked why they were moving around suspiciously in the restricted area, Patel said she wanted to meet her husband Mumtaz Khalid of Lahore.

 Patel told army officials that she met Khalid in an Internet chatroom in 2003. The two began talking over the phone and decided to become life partners, oblivious of the fact that the boundaries between India and Pakistan could become an obstacle to their plan, Badola said. The cyber courtship ended in an exchange of wedding vows on the Web.

 Last year, Patel along with her friend Sharma approached the Pakistan embassy in New Delhi for a visa but met with disappointment.

 She then decided to meet Khalid at the Wagah border in Amritsar district of Punjab and worked out a plan to cross into Pakistan, Badola said.

 After cajoling the personnel of Border Security Force and Pakistani Rangers, the couple managed to meet for a few minutes. 

 Last month, during one of their cyber conversations, Khalid told Patel she could cross the LoC at Chakan-da-Bagh and he would be waiting on the other side.

 According to the plan, Sharma would have to return after her friend crossed over.

 Badola said Poonch senior superintendent of police S.D. Jawmal had got in touch with Patels family in Mumbai. Her family has confirmed that she had been missing for the last four days, he said.

 The SSP has asked the family to take the two girls back as they had no intention to detain them. 

 The two have been provided accommodation in a local hotel where their statement was recorded by army and police officials.

 Patels family is expected to reach here soon.

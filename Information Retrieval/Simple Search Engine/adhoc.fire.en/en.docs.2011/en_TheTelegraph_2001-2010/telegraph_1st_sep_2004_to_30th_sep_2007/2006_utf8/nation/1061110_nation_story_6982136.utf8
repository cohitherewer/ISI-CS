 Indian envoys scare Pak

 Islamabad, Nov. 9 (PTI): Pakistan has reportedly asked Washington and London to avoid appointing Indian-origin diplomats at their embassies in Islamabad.

 There is concern in official quarters over the appointment of a growing number of diplomats of Indian origin to sensitive positions at the US embassy and to a lesser degree at the British High Commission in Islamabad, a Pakistani official was quoted as saying by the Dawn. 

 Other officials, the newspaper said, acknowledged that the issue had emerged as an irritant. 

 Foreign minister Khursheed Mehmood Kasuri had raised the issue with the two missions a few months ago, the daily said, adding that discussions have been held in Washington and London, too.

 Five diplomats of Indian origin are in the US embassy, some of them in key positions, the Dawn said, adding that a couple of such officials were posted at the UK mission. 

 Some African embassies and the Mauritian mission also had such diplomats in Islamabad. The Pakistani government had resisted some of these appointments. In some cases, the missions had to review their decisions. 

 Pakistan is worried that the Indian-origin diplomats could get access to places and documents not open to Indians, the Dawn said. It fears they could exchange classified information on the war on terrorism, security and defence ties with the Indian embassy.

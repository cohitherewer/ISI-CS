 Hitch in quotas at one go

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 7: The Centre may not be able to push the IITs and IIMs to introduce a 27 per cent quota for Other Backward Class (OBC) students from the next academic session.

 IIT and IIM heads believe it will be difficult for them to put in place additional infrastructure, like more teachers and hostels, and increase student intake by March 2007 when the new quota guidelines are to come into effect.

 The UPA-Left coordination committee has mandated the government to implement the policy by the next session.

 An oversight committee headed by Veerappa Moily, set up to monitor implementation of the quota, is expected to submit a report to the government by August 31. This will be based on the recommendations of five sub-committees headed by academic experts and institute heads.

 The human resource development (HRD) ministry accepts that the concerns raised by the IITs and IIMs are not invalid, but says it can take a decision only after the Moily committee submits its report. A staggered expansion is not ruled out.

 The Centre can sanction the money required for additional infrastructure only after the Moily committee hands in its report, which means it will not be before September. This leaves the institutes with just a few months to put in place the hostels and other facilities required.

 Officials point out that construction cannot start at once after the funds are released because the institutions will have to go through government procedures like putting out tenders.

 Moily agrees there are bottlenecks in the expansion plan, but said these can be surmounted with innovative measures.

 A theme paper put up by the committee on its website for national consultation says: The important thing is that the existing infrastructure has to be used innovatively. This would call for out-of-the-box ideas to see how this can possibly be done.

 It makes the same suggestion for expansion for faculty. We have to think imaginatively in terms of personnel recruitment, remuneration and conditions of service in case of faculty. In any case, a great deal of flexibility regarding non-monetary and monetary incentives will be required.

 The IIMs have been facing an exodus of faculty members to private institutions that offer better pay.

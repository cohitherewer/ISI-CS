 BJP crown for Rajnath

 POORNIMA JOSHI

 Mumbai, Dec. 31: L.K. Advani today kept his promise to quit the hot seat after the silver jubilee celebrations, officially presenting Rajnath Singh as the new BJP chief.

 I have submitted my resignation to party vice-president M. Venkaiah Naidu. In Chennai, I had said that I would resign after the silver jubilee celebrations in Mumbai and a new president will take over.

 I present to you Shri Rajnath Singhji, the new president of the BJP, Advani announced at a news conference a day after the celebrations.

 Advani stubbed out whispers that A.B. Vajpayee had thrown up Pramod Mahajan as Rajnaths challenger through the Ram-Lakshman analogy he drew on Thursday.

 Vajpayee had termed Advani and Mahajan the Ram and Lakshman of the BJP while announcing his decision to quit electoral politics.

 Advani said Vajpayee had only meant to convey that he was too ill to continue in politics and there were able hands to take charge of the party. 

 He mentioned mine and Pramods name because we were sitting next to him on the dais. I think he expressed his own inability to continue because of illness. I dont think anything more should be read into it, he said.

 Rajnath and Mahajan were sitting next to each other on the dais while Advani spoke.

 Rajnath touched Advanis feet before listing the basics of his tenure in words the RSS is likely to appreciate.

 Suraj, shuchita and suraksha (good governance, moral probity and security) are the basics of good governance, he said.

 But he made a small faux pas as he promised scribes a longer interaction on Monday, the day he will formally take charge at a ceremony in Delhi.

 I will speak to you at length in Lucknow on January 2, he said, his obsession with Uttar Pradesh ? reviving the BJP there will be the litmus test he faces ? coming through in a slip of the tongue.

 Gujarat terror law blocked

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 30: The Centre has blocked the Gujarat governments move to enact a new anti-terror law on the lines of Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) on the ground that existing statutes are adequate.

 Union home minister Shivraj Patil said in the Rajya Sabha today the Centre would not allow the state an MCOCA-like legislation as such stringent laws were prone to misuse. 

 The Narendra Modi government had sought the permission on the ground that Gujarat, a border state, was fast becoming a hub of terrorist activity. Patil said the planned law was not in line with the Centres policy against stringent measures to fight terror. The move was part of a plan by the BJP-ruled states to come up with their own anti-terror laws after the Prevention of Terrorism Acts repeal. 

 Arguing that the law and order situation in the country had improved, Patil called for better implementation of the existing laws instead of drafting new ones. There has not been any major communal riot, the minister said, wrapping up a discussion on the internal security situation.

 The police have been asked to handle terrorism cases with sensitivity and not target a particular community, Patil said. He hinted the Malegaon blasts probe would be given to the CBI, saying the state feels it would instil confidence among the people.

 PM gets pat, price punch

 - Mixed day for Singh on Japan visit-eve

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Sonia Gandhi

 New Delhi, Dec. 12: On the eve of his departure for Tokyo, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh won the Congress Working Committees (CWC) approval for the governments foreign policy, including the Indo-US nuclear deal.

 But the committee, chaired by party president Sonia Gandhi, took the Centre to task for failing to check the unabated rise in prices, especially that of essential commodities.

 The Congresss highest policy-making body stopped short of adopting a formal resolution on the issue.

 On Pakistan, the CWC welcomed the resumption of composite dialogue in November, general secretary and spokesman Janardhan Dwivedi said.

 Foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee briefed members on the visit of Chinese President Hu Jintao and the nuclear deal. The Prime Minister also spoke on the pact, but mostly repeated points made by Mukherjee in Parliament today. 

 The panel felt that party members should not voice reservations over the deal in public since one of the main objectives of Singhs visit was to get Japans support for lifting restrictions on India by the Nuclear Suppliers Group, sources said. Japan is a key NSG member.

 The committee, sources said, was more concerned over the price rise, though the issue wasnt on the agenda initially. The CWC urged the government to take appropriate steps to control prices. The Prime Minister informed us that the government was taking necessary steps, but we said more needs to be done, said Dwivedi.

 Members of the committee said the claim of 9 to 10 per cent growth was meaningless, unless it translated into tangible benefits for the aam admi (the common man). 

 If the aam admi has to shell out Rs 70 and 80 for a kg of dal, what does the growth rate mean to him? asked a member. They stressed that unless something was done, the price rise would impact the Congresss prospects badly and the party may lose power in Uttaranchal and Punjab. Around six months ago, the CWC had met especially to discuss price rise. The issue also came up in a meeting of Congress chief ministers in September. 

 There was no mention of the Sachar committee report or the controversy set off by the Prime Ministers reported statement on more resources for minorities at a meeting of the National Development Council last Saturday. When the party and the government have clarified, there is no need to raise it again, said Dwivedi.

 UP rivals march to Kalam

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 8: Heartland rival camps, the Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party, took separate delegations to the President today. 

 The ruling Samajwadis demanded that Uttar Pradesh governor T.V. Rajeswar be recalled, while the BSP wanted Presidents rule in the state. 

 The march to Rashtrapati Bhavan by the two parties comes close on the heels of the governors meeting with President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, where he is said to have recommended the dismissal of the Mulayam Singh Yadav-led government.

 The developments stoked speculation that the Samajwadi regime in the state is facing the threat of dismissal ahead of Assembly elections due early next year. 

 Samajwadi Party general secretary Amar Singh today said: Shri T.V. Rajeswar has lost his credibility to continue in the honourable position of a governor. He should, therefore, be called back immediately to protect the federal element of the Constitution of the country. 

 He added that the governor has converted the Raj Bhavan into the Congress headquarters in the state.

 Earlier in the day, BSP chief Mayavati, who led her partys delegation to the President, said: Without dismissing the SP government, a free and fair election is not pos-sible in the state. The BJP is also indulging in silent support to the ongoing anarchy in the state.

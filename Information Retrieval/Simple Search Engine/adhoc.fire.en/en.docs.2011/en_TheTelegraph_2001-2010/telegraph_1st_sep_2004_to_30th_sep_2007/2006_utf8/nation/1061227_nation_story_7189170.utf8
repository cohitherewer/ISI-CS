 Hindu school, UK-run

 London, Dec. 26 (AP): Britains first state-funded school for Hindus is on course to open in September 2008, one of the schools directors said today.

 The Krishna-Avanti school, which will be advised by Iskcon the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, better known as the Hare Krishna movement has been earmarked to receive 10 million from the British government, director Nitesh Gor said.

 The money has been earmarked by the government, Gor said. The Krishna-Avanti primary school aims to give Hindu parents a choice of school that is consistent with their faith.

 The school for children aged between three and 12 will be built in Harrow, north-west London, a stronghold for Britains 600,000-strong Hindu community.

 Hindus in Britain have long campaigned for state-funded schools for followers of the faith. State-backed schools for Christians, Muslims and Jews already exist. There are two private Hindu schools in the country.

 With around 40,000 Hindus living in the town of Harrow, the highest concentration of Hindus in the country, the schools backers are confident that pupils will flock to the new school. 

 A register of interest for prospective parents has already been opened.

 The school plans to have the capacity to teach 240 pupils with a nursery providing space for a further 26 children. Pupils will study the national curriculum in line with all schools around the country but Hinduisms ethos will be the focus of the schools day-to-day activities.

 The department of education was not immediately available to comment on the report.

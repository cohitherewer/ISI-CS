 Love story to end 40 barren years 

 Jammu, May 10 (PTI): After nearly forty years, Kashmiris will get to see a film they can call their own.

 Filmed amid the coniferous woods, picturesque meadows and scenic water bodies of Jammu and Kashmir, Akh Daleel Lolich is set to become the first Kashmiri movie to be released in 39 years, the films maker, Parvez Mustaq, said today.

 The film, a love story, will be screened first in Srinagar on May 20 and then in halls across the state.

 At the premiere, audio and video CDs of the films songs will be released, Mustaq said.

 The 100-minute movie is a love story set in the Dogra Raj era of the 18th century. 

 It depicts the love between Sara, a landlords daughter and Gul, a villagers son, said Mustaq.

 Gul is played by Kashmiri newcomer Sarwar while Madhay stars as the heroine Sara.

 It is full of drama, pathos and commotion against the backdrop of melodious Kashmiri music. The film has five romantic songs, Mustaq said.

 As many as 60 people acted in the film and 55 are totally new faces, all of them Kashmiris.

 This has given Kashmiri actors a new platform to display their talent.

 Several top Kashmiri actors also worked in the film, including Tariq Javed, Kazi Sayeed, Yousef Sahabnaz and Shahida.

 For Mustaq, the film is just the beginning. He dreams of setting up a facility to produce more films in Kashmiri. This is the first step towards giving physical shape to my dreams, the filmmaker said.

 The last two Kashmiri films to be released some 39 years ago were Akhnundun and Habba Khatoon.

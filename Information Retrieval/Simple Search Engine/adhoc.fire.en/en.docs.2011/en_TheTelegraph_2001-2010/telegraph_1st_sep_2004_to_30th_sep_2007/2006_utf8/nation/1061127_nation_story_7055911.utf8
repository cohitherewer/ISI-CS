New Delhi, Nov. 26 (PTI): A college that sacked a lecturer for requesting extension of maternity leave was ordered by Delhi High Court to reinstate her and pay full arrears of salary.

 In spite of protective provisions on maternity and request for extended leave, which was permissible, the employer, in disdain of those norms, terminated her service, Justice Ravindra Bhat, who heard the case, said.

 Petitioner Seema Gupta had joined Guru Nanak Institute of Management here in May 2001 as a commerce lecturer. She was allowed maternity leave for six months in December 2003. But she sought a five-month extension on medical grounds. She quoted Rule 43 (4) (b) of the Central Civil Service Rules, which allows initial maternity leave of up to a year. 

 But the college sacked her on the ground of habitual absenteeism.

 Rule 43 is an instance of application of gender protective rights to the public. The rule has to be understood as a larger social concern for extending special care to employees who are given maternity benefits, the court said.

 The bench added that the importance of treating female employees who avail of maternity leave and who might face problems in raising infants was foreseen by the lawmakers. That is why the employee is absolved of even the normal requirement of having to produce a medical certificate.

 The law aimed to promote non-discriminatory practices the court said, while dismissing the colleges argument that Gupta was not a regular employee but appointed on an ad-hoc basis.

 The bench said the college had played truant in terminating Guptas job despite knowing that her request for leave extension was only due to her poor health and that of the child. It also told the college to pay Rs 15,000 to the petitioner within six weeks of the order.

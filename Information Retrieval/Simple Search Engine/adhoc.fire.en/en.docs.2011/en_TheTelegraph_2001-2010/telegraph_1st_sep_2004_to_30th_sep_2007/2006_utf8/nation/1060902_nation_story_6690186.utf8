 Citu to Buddha: we will strike in IT

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Sector V in Salt Lake, which is Bengals IT hub

 Calcutta, Sept. 1: Citu today set up a face-off with the Bengal CPM by saying it would try our best to ensure the Left trade unions December 14 general strike is extended to the IT and IT-enabled services sector in Bengal.

 Just two weeks ago, mindful of chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees opposition to any cease-work in these sectors, Citus Bengal wing had said a decision on whether to exempt them would be taken 48 hours before the strike.

 The CPM labour arms fresh stand, articulated by its national president M.K. Pandhe, is likely to create a storm at the next CPM politburo meeting, scheduled in the city on September 12 and 13.

 We cannot exempt the IT and ITES sectors from the strike since employees there are subjected to the worst kind of exploitation, said Pandhe, who is also a CPM politburo member, at a Citu literacy programme.

 People are forced to work for 12 hours or on multiple shifts virtually without any rest. A hire-and-fire policy has become the norm for many IT companies. Employees there have every right to do collective bargaining and form unions as well as to call strikes if their legitimate demands are not met.

 We will try our best to organise strike in all industries, including the IT sector, in Bengal this time.

 Pandhe had earlier locked horns with fellow politburo members from Bengal, particularly Bhattacharjee, after Citu tried to enforce strikes in the infotech hub at Salt Lake during the general strike on September 29 last year.

 An angry Bhattacharjee had then assured an alarmed industry that it was the last bandh in the sector in Bengal. But the chief minister had to climb down after Pandhe and other Citu leaders insisted on IT employees right to form unions and call strikes.

 After Pandhes statement today, CPM state secretariat member Benoy Konar cautioned Citu against enforcing the December 14 strike called across the country against the Centres anti-labour policies in IT and ITES.

 Expressing the Bhattacharjee line, he said any such move would be suicidal for the state as well as the workers in these sectors.

 The issue will be discussed in the coming meeting of the party politburo. The strike has been called to protect workers rights. But if we endanger their livelihood by enforcing it on industries that need 24x7 operations, we have to think twice, Konar said.

 We know that foreign companies are outsourcing IT jobs to get them done at a much lower cost here. But if we enforce the strike in IT and ITES in Bengal, the units will leave the state and our boys and girls would lose jobs.

 Pandhe said he also wanted Bhattacharjee to ensure labour rights in the upcoming special economic zones in the state in the light of the CPM central leaderships criticism of the Manmohan Singh governments SEZ policies.

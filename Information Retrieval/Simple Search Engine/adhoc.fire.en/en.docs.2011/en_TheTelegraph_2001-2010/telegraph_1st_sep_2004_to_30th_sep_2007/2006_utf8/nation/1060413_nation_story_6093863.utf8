 Poll convoy crushes boy

 OUR BUREAU

 April 12: Around 450 paramilitary vehicles from lower Assam trooped to south Bengal today, leaving thousands of commuters in the north stranded and a seven-year-old boy dead.

 The massive logistic exercise is being undertaken on the orders of the Election Commission of India to maintain peace during polling in the five-phase Assembly elections beginning April 17. 

 All vehicles engaged in the task have been requisitioned from north Bengal, including around 200 buses of the North Bengal State Transport Corporation (NBSTC). Despite our best efforts, withdrawing such a large number of vehicles from their regular routes caused inconvenience to commuters, said Gedion Namchu, managing director, NBSTC.

 That a few of the vehicles in the convoy were travelling at a breakneck speed was evident from the incident that occurred a little after 11 am on NH 31, 2 km from Panjipara in North Dinajpur. 

 A tribal boy, Shom Tudu, 7, had crossed the two north-bound lanes of the four-lane highway and had come in front of a Tata Sumo, carrying CISF personnel. 

 The vehicle braked hard, turned twice on its side and landed in a ditch. 

 Tudu, however, could not be saved. Injured on the head, he died while being taken to the hospital. The driver of the vehicle, Sonam Subba, also died on the spot. 

 The injured three occupants of the vehicle ? CISF assistant commander Rao, subinspector Raj Singh and a constable ? were first taken to the Panjipara health centre and later to the Islampur subdivisional hospital. 

 Following the accident, a flare-up by residents was avoided because of the large deployment of police there. Our forces brought the situation under control within minutes, said North Dinajpur superintendent of police P.K. Sanyal.

 He however, said that he would inquire into how the boy could have rushed onto the road when we had deployed extra police personnel along the route so that the convoy would not be disturbed. 

 The district magistrate, too, called it said it was an unfortunate incident, especially when special arrangements had been made.

 Besides the reduced number of vehicles, the regular commuters especially those travelling from one town to another, had to bear the brunt of traffic hold-ups as the convoys of security personnel were given the right of way. 

 I missed an important meeting in Siliguri because the bus I was travelling in was stuck for nearly an hour near Islampur, said Partho Das, an executive of a private company.

 New Delhi, Nov. 22: With a verve not seen since the May 2004 defeat, the BJP leadership hit the streets today. As a mammoth crowd of supporters shouted slogans, Atal Bihari Vajpayee gave a call for a change of government.

 L.K. Advani and Rajnath Singh marched across the capital demanding death for Parliament attack accused Mohammad Afzal and denouncing the governments mishandling of internal security.

 All the top leaders Vajpayee, Advani, M.M. Joshi, Sushma Swaraj, Venkaiah Naidu, Jaswant Singh and V.K. Malhotra gathered on Parliament Street to condemn the ruling alliances destructive drift, total directionlessness and vote bank-dictated policy of compromise against Pak-sponsored terrorism.

 Two rallies, led by Advani and Rajnath, converged on Parliament Street. A mishap at the start failed to dampen the crowds enthusiasm. The stage erected opposite Rajghat for Advani collapsed sideways minutes before he was to climb onto it. Vijay Goel, Arjun Munda and the others on the dais were hurt.

 The crowd, spilling over to Connaught Place from Parliament Street, roared when Vajpayee rose to speak. He didnt disappoint.

 What are they (the Centre) doing? Pakistan is refusing to accept evidence of their involvement in terror here and they want to continue dialogue. For what purpose? Vajpayee asked.

 Advani and Rajnath, too, were visibly excited at the size of the crowds. Advani warned that the Prime Minister and Sonia Gandhi should see that the decision to hang Afzal is taken immediately.

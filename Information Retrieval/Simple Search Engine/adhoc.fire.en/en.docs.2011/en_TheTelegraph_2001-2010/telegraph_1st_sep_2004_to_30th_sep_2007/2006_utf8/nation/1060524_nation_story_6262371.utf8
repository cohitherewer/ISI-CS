 Denied lead role, Cong finds fault in job scheme

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Sonia: Job pressure

 Bhopal, May 23: Congress president Sonia Gandhi is expected to face stiff opposition from within on the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme that is close to her heart and which the Centre shows off as proof of its commitment to the common man. 

 Sonia has called a meeting of 200 district party chiefs on May 26 in Delhi to discuss implementation of the scheme that provides for wage employment to every rural household in which an adult member volunteers to do unskilled manual work. Through the scheme, launched earlier this year, the government aims to remove poverty by assuring at least 100 days employment.

 At a preparatory meeting in Bhopal, Congress presidents of 18 districts unanimously opposed the scheme on the grounds that it was being politicised, the poor were not getting benefits, it was spawning corruption and was not monitored properly. 

 Madhya Pradesh Congress chief Subhash Yadav said he had received feedback that the BJP-ruled state was projecting it as its own scheme instead of giving credit to the Congress-led government at the Centre. The Union government sees the job scheme as one of its big successes, along with the right to information law.

 In many cases, we have come to know that people are getting daily wage of Rs 22 instead of Rs 61. In Chattarpur district, for instance, we have reports that village sarpanchs are pocketing the money. There is a great fraud on and people are being hoodwinked, he said. 

 Yadav, who said he had received similar feedback from other non-Congress-ruled states like Jharkhand, Orissa and Rajasthan, will submit a detailed report to Sonia Gandhi on Friday. 

 We are now realising that the BJP is using the scheme to fund its cadre and deny deserving persons. Also there is no acknowledgement of the fact that it is a brainchild of the UPA regime, he said. 

 A source close to Union commerce minister Kamal Nath also said the scheme was being grossly misused on his home turf Chhindwara. The poor and needy are not getting any benefit from it. We are almost tempted to halt it and ask for its scrapping, a close aide of the minister said. 

 The gram panchayats have been handed the bulk of responsibility for implementing the scheme, assisted by a number of officers, from a programme officer at the panchayat level to a programme co-ordinator at the block level. 

 According to Yadav, in states not ruled by the Congress ? and there are many, like Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Rajasthan, Orissa, Bihar, Gujarat, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Bengal ? this provision has led to conflict between the panchayat and the programme officers.

 Given the political affiliation of members of gram panchayat and the ground reality of caste predilections, we feel it is difficult to ensure that the implementation will be carried out smoothly, efficiently and uninfluenced by extraneous considerations, he said, stressing the need for an all-party monitoring panel in every district. 

 Yadav said while the aim of the scheme was to put pressure on the states to create and offer jobs to the poor, he had found that the unemployment allowance included in the central funds was giving rise to litigation and avoidable administrative work.

 Raising another problem, state Congress unit spokesperson Manak Aggarwal said Rs 61 per day for a guaranteed 100 days translates to only Rs 500 a month, which is not sufficient to run a family. 

 Also, in many cases, the scheme was leading to friction within a family over selection of the member to be given the job. We have information that women and physically challenged are being left out, Aggarwal said.

 Mumbai breathes easy, Delhi sees scuffle

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi/Mumbai, Feb. 3: For the first time since he took charge as Mumbai airport director, R.J. Treasurywala looked at ease.

 Our contingency plan to counter the AAI strike has worked well. We have 500 officers and they managed to keep the airport running. Except housekeeping, all other key departments are unaffected, said Treasurywala, who had his baptism by fire.

 He took over on the first day of the ceasework.

 Garbage had piled up inside and outside the airport, but flights were operating. As they did in Delhi.

 Unlike in Mumbai, Delhi was not entirely peaceful, though. A scuffle broke out between angry AAI employees and police.

 The agitating staff claimed that buses ferrying their colleagues were being diverted elsewhere by security personnel.

 They staged a sit-in, blocking traffic leading up to the airport for a few minutes, despite the Delhi High Court order yesterday not to disrupt normal activities at the airport.

 AAI spokesperson Prem Nath said the situation was quickly brought under control. He added that the court order restraining the protesters from coming within 500 metres of the terminal building was being enforced and vehicles were moving undeterred into the airport.

 The employees, however, demonstrated right across the arrival terminal and refused to shift to a place beyond 500 metres.

 We are yet to receive a copy of the high court order, said S.R. Santhanam of the employees union.

 Basic passenger amenities, such as water supply and sanitation, were unavailable and passengers continued to pull their luggage into and out of the airport on their own in the absence of trolleys.

 It is very dirty and unhygienic. The dustbins are full and nobody dares go near the washrooms, said an employee of a private airline.

 In Mumbai, Treasurywala claimed that cargo movement had improved. On Day I, we could not clear more than 30 per cent cargo. Yesterday, we managed more than 90 per cent clearance, he said.

 BJP strains but misses protest bus 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 21: The absence of a credible face in the BJPs Delhi unit has taken the edge out of the partys drive to claim credit for the traders protest yesterday against the crackdown on their business premises.

 The partys lone ranger in Delhi, city unit chief Dr Harsh Vardhan, however, said his party was not out to claim any credit for anything.

 I am not telling you how many of our workers are in jail for the protests yesterday, he said, asked if the BJP was leading the movement or whether it was a spontaneous outburst of anger. We are only protecting the rights of lakhs of traders in Delhi, whose only fault is that they are trying to make an honest living.

 Harsh Vardhan is the BJPs replacement for M.L. Khurana, who quit the party last year. But unlike Khurana, he is a quiet worker whose public engagements mostly escape the attention of his superiors. So, while he spent yesterday shouting slogans on Delhis streets, none of the central leaders were by his side.

 By afternoon, three people had died in police firing but the partys central unit did not make any statement supporting the traders. In fact, it was not clear till late in the evening that the BJP had initiated the protests.

 Of course we had called for a bandh. The BJP is leading the protests, insisted spokesperson Prakash Javadekar late in the evening. Who is saying no central leader is involved?

 Today, Harsh Vardhan and Javadekar were the only leaders present at a news conference to condemn chief minister Sheila Dikshit and the Centre for the traders plight.

 Other prominent Delhi leaders, like the partys deputy leader in the Lok Sabha V.K. Malhotra and Arun Jaitley, had either gone out of town or, like former minister Vijay Goel, charted their separate agenda for the day.

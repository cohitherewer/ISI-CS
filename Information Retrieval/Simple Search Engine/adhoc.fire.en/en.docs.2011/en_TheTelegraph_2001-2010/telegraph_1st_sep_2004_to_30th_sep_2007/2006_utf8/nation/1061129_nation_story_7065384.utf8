 No mercy this time, PM wields broom

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 Singh: Stern

 New Delhi, Nov. 28: When Prime Minister Manmohan Singh came under pressure to reinduct Shibu Soren into the cabinet, there was a view in the government and the Congress that he should not be touched for fear of what nasty surprise the JMM leader may spring at what point.

 Sorens detractors argued that if the JMM had to be represented, there were four other MPs to pick from. Soren was described as the UPAs proverbial bad apple because he would always give the BJP a stick with which to beat the government, they said.

 Neither Singh nor the Congress had much of a leeway. Soren was brought back into the cabinet for a third time, after having resigned twice before in a blaze of controversy.

 No wonder once the news of his conviction and arrest began to flash on TV screens, a senior Congress minister said: In the morning some of us were celebrating Sanjay Dutts partial acquittal. After all, his father was dear to us and we didnt want the worst for the son. By evening, Soren killed our happiness.

 Before the BJP could raise the tainted ministers issue again, the Prime Minister took the matter in his hands and sought Sorens resignation. There was no dilly- dallying, no consultations or meetings.

 By then, BJP general secretary Arun Jaitley warned: The conviction will bring back the tainted ministers issue back in focus in Parliament, if Soren doesnt quit.

 A minister conceded that if Soren didnt resign, Parliament could not have carried on and he could be sacrificed because he had only five Lok Sabha members.

 The Congress and the government had come in for flak in July 2004 when a Jharkhand court issued a non-bailable warrant against Soren for his alleged involvement in a mob carnage decades ago.

 Soren refused to surrender immediately and took his time to put in his papers. He spent a month in judicial custody and secured a bail. Against the Prime Ministers wishes, he was taken back into the cabinet in November 2004.

 He resigned in March 2005 to become the Jharkhand chief minister. But he was in office for nine days and quit after failing to get a vote of confidence.

 In the events that followed, the Centre and the Raj Bhavan got a black eye from the Supreme Court but Soren returned to the Centre.

 Congress sources said the Soren affair could re-ignite a debate within the party about the long-term wisdom of doing business and striking alliances with all kinds of outfits for immediate gains. But for the moment, they conceded that the party had no option but to put up with the JMM.

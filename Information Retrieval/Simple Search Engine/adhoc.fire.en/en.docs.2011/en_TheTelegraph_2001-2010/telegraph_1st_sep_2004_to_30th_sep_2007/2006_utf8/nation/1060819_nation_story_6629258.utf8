 Uphaar check minus accused

 New Delhi (PTI): A sessions 

 court has refused to allow six persons accused in the 1997 

 Uphaar theatre fire tragedy to be present at the site when 

 its officials inspect the cinema hall.

 Fifty-nine people had been suffocated to death in the fire that broke out in the theatre on July 13, 1997.

 The court said it would conduct the inspection scheduled for Saturday alone. 

 In a 2003 directive, Delhi High Court had asked officials of the sessions court to visit the site.

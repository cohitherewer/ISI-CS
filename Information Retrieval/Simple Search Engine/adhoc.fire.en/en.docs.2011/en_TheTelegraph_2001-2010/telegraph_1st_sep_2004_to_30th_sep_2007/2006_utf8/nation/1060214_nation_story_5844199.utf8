 Third front: Cloud in distant sky

 THE BIG PICTURE - MAHESH RANGARAJAN

 The blue skies across north India 

 have sent temperatures soaring in New Delhi. There were 

 no winter showers this time and the mercury is already rising 

 above 30 degrees Celsius.

 As it turns out, the political 

 scene is also hotting up, with rumblings of a third front 

 for the first time since May 2004. Close on the heels of 

 the initiative by Mulayam Singh Yadav, the chief minister 

 of Uttar Pradesh, comes a thinly- veiled warning from the 

 soft-spoken CPM general secretary Prakash Karat.

 The Samajwadi Party has been feeling 

 the Centres heat for some time now. There is little 

 doubt that Congress managers are waiting for the right time 

 to unleash Rahul Gandhi on the state to question Mulayams 

 secular credentials and recapture the traditional support 

 bases of the Gandhi family. 

 Given the sorry state of the Congress 

 in the state, this may be a pipe dream, but the chief minister 

 is taking no chances.

 The pressure on the Samajwadi 

 Party chief has come from different directions. The Centre 

 has bent over backwards to help his bete noire Mayavati 

 in the Taj corridor case, only acting after being prodded 

 by the Supreme Court. 

 Most recently, Congress spokespersons 

 have publicly welcomed the rebellion by Lok Sabha MP for 

 Agra Raj Babbar. 

 Mulayam has hit back in a way 

 he knows best, by politically taking on the UPA. Interestingly, 

 he has chosen Indias stance on Iran as a test case. 

 This is clearly a bid to appeal to anti-American sentiments 

 as well as reassure minorities that he is not drifting towards 

 the Sangh parivar.

 The choice of N. Chandrababu Naidu 

 is significant for he was the convener of the United Front 

 for two years before deserting it in 1998 to extend outside 

 support to the second Vajpayee government.

 Naidu, like Mulayam, knows the 

 way ahead is to combine forces and take on the ruling combine 

 in New Delhi. To do so effectively, they need to puncture 

 its claim of protecting minority interests.

 Few have grasped that the move 

 for a debate in Parliament comes on the eve of the visit 

 of President George W. Bush to India. There is little doubt 

 that his actions in Iraq and in the war on terror 

 in general make him unpopular among large sections of Muslims 

 worldwide. 

 The Congresss anxiety on 

 this score is evident in the Prime Ministers appeal 

 not to view foreign policy via prisms of community identities. 

 Yet, this is no exception. The late Indira Gandhi was hailed 

 as Durga after the Bangladesh war. Vajpayee gained from 

 saffron overtones of Pokhran and Kargil.

 The Congresss worry is less 

 about ethics in the political sphere and more about self-interest. 

 It can ill afford a strong Opposition combine that reaches 

 out to minorities and farmers, two groups which played a 

 key role in voting it back into power, albeit at the head 

 of a coalition.

 No such formation can succeed 

 without a strong base in Uttar Pradesh in the north and 

 Andhra Pradesh in the south. The Congress re-established 

 its dominance in the latter two years ago and is hoping 

 to rebuild its base in the Hindi-belt state in the near 

 future.

 There is a second dimension to 

 the Mulayam-Naidu combine. In April 1999, it was the socialist 

 strongman who blocked the emergence of a Congress-led coalition 

 after Vajpayees defeat on the floor of the House. 

 It is only logical he should seek to revive an anti-Congress 

 platform. Naidu was the prop that held up three successive 

 non-Congress ministries from 1996 right through till 2004. 

 He now realises he needs to move beyond his dalliance with 

 saffron.

 There, the similarities end. Mulayam 

 is sitting pretty as the single-largest party from Uttar 

 Pradesh in the Lok Sabha. The Telugu Desam Party is yet 

 to recover from the drubbing it got in May 2004 and has 

 not recovered ground in subsequent by-elections. 

 The real test will be whether 

 they can reach out with a broadly secular platform to constituents 

 of both the NDA and the UPA. This will be the real litmus 

 test.

 The CPM and its allies have reason 

 to adopt a more confrontational stance. The defeat of the 

 airport employees strike marked a new low in its relations 

 with the Manmohan Singh ministry. Not only was there no 

 rollback on the bids for the Delhi and Mumbai airports, 

 the victory may well embolden the government to press ahead 

 with other reforms unpalatable to the Left.

 The timing of the Assembly elections 

 due in May in Kerala and Bengal adds to but does not entirely 

 account for the chill in ties between the Marxists and the 

 Congress. The larger factor surely is the marginalisation 

 of the Lefts influence on economic and foreign policy-making.

 No third front is possible without 

 the Left but the latter is not yet ready to take the plunge. 

 The larger strategic goal of keeping the BJP out of power 

 seems less urgent but has not disappeared from its calculations. 

 The problem is that the Congress is slowly inching its way 

 to a more dominant role, and hemming in the CPM.

 Yet, the third front has only 

 become attractive in the past when there has been a complete 

 collapse of the Congresss plans. This was the situation 

 in 1989 and again in 1996. Today, the Congress, though depleted, 

 is in no mood to retreat.

 More seriously, the ties forged 

 with the Left in the NDA regime are still intact. They are 

 fraying at the edges but are yet to unravel. 

 Till that happens, the third front 

 will be like the clouds in the skies over New Delhi, visible 

 but quite a distance away.

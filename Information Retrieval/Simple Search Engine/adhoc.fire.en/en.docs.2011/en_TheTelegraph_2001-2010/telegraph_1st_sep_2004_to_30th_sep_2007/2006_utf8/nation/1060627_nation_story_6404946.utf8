 Lanka row

 New Delhi, June 26: Taking note of the killing of Sri Lankan army vice-chief major general Parami Kulatunga, Delhi today made an urgent appeal to start the political process to resolve the ethnic problem and offered its constitutional expertise in finding a solution to the Tamil tangle, reports our special correspondent.

 Terming the attack as an act of terrorism, Delhi advised Colombo to immediately activate serious dialogue to resolve the crisis. 

 Despite shying away from a direct intervention in the matter, Delhi said it welcomed Sri Lankan governments move to evolve a political consensus and was ready to share its constitutional experience.

 The news of the attack was received with shock in the foreign office as it confirmed the worst fears of war returning to the island nation.

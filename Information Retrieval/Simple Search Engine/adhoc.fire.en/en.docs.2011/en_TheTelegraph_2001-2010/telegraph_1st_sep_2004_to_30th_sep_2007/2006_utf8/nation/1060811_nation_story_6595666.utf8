 Japan irked by Bengal bridge shift 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Aug. 10: Japan is upset about Bengals decision to give the Raichak-Kukrahati bridge project to the Salim Group without consulting it.

 Its a pity. Without giving us any explanation, the Bengal government has on its own decided to give the project to Salim Group of Indonesia, Yoshikazu Takeuchi, the consul-general of Japan, said.

 Representatives of the Japan International Cooperation Agency (Jica), which was conducting a feasibility study for the project, and Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC), the funding agency, will meet Bengal chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb tomorrow. The cloud will clear only after that, a Jica official said. 

 The government had said on Tuesday that the Salim Group wanted to start the project at the earliest and the Japanese would be told that the Rs 2-crore assistance for the study was not needed. 

 We understand the enthusiasm of the Bengal government for quick development of the state... but the feasibility study mission had been set up and they had started working on the project from June, Takeuchi said.

 The move will not go down well with the Japanese government and might affect Tokyos development assistance programme for the state. I hope this doesnt happen, Takeuchi said.

 He added that the since the Centre had forwarded the project to the Japan government, the Union finance ministry has been informed.

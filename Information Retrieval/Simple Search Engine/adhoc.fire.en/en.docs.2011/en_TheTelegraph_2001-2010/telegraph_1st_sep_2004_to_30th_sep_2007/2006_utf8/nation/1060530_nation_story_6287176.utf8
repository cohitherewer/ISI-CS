 Sonia son keeps up suspense

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 29: It was supposed to happen today ? Rahul Gandhis induction in the All India Congress Committee. 

 As the buzz grows about his namesake from the BJP ? Pramod Mahajans son ? readying to take the political plunge, Sonia Gandhis son (in picture) is yet to make up his mind on whether he wants to accept formal organisational responsibility or just remain a Lok Sabha MP, Congress sources said.

 The organisational shuffle, which was supposed to take place after the Parliament session, hangs in balance, thanks to Rahul. The Congress sources said a worried Sonia has asked some functionaries close to her son to persuade him to take on some responsibility. 

 The party fears if the suspense over Rahul lingers, it could dampen the workers morale.

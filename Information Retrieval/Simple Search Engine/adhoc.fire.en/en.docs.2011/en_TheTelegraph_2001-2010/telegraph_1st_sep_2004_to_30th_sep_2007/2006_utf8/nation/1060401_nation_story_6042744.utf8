The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 One for Sonia, one against

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, March 31: Uma Bharti, searching aggressively for a new political identity, is spoiling for a scrap with Sonia Gandhi. But Mayavati, a wealth case hanging over her head, sees no profit in rubbing the Congress president the wrong way.

 A day after the expelled BJP leader promised to field a woman candidate from Rae Bareli and spearhead the campaign herself as a shadow candidate, the Bahujan Samaj Party chief announced her party would not contest the Lok Sabha bypoll.

 Lest the move be seen as an overture for a tie-up, Mayavati went out of her way to rule out an adjustment with the Congress during the 2007 Assembly elections. But party sources suggested she was open to a post-poll alliance.

 Mayavatis decision would allow Sonia to tap into a large chunk of Dalit and backward votes that would otherwise have gone to the BSP.

 BSP sources said the former chief minister is worried over the disproportionate assets case against her and wants to convince the Congress that compared with the Samajwadi Party, the BJP and Uma, she is rather soft on Sonia.

 Uma said she wanted to bust Sonias image of a self-sacrificing leader. I have decided to field my (yet-to-be-announced) partys woman candidate from Rae Bareli but you may call me the shadow candidate, she told reporters.

 The sadhvi wouldnt reveal who the candidate might be, but warned: Dont think she would be a weak candidate, especially when I plan to spend sufficient time to campaign.

 Mayavati, however, has no wish to tangle with Sonia; but she insisted she wasnt ready for a tango either.

 There is no such possibility (of a tie-up with the Congress). A poll adjustment with any mainstream party has never benefited the BSP, her statement said. BSP sources, however, underscored that the statement was silent on a post-poll alliance.

 The BJP, which had been hoping Uma would jump into the fray herself, hasnt revealed if it would renominate Ramvilas Vedanti, who had won around 1 lakh votes against Sonia in 2004.

 Ambedkar statue row

 Kanpur/Mumbai, Nov. 29 (PTI): The alleged vandalisation of a statue of B.R. Ambedkar in Kanpur today sparked protests across Maharashtra. 

 Some passers-by noticed the damaged statue this morning and raised an alarm. A crowd gathered and they began throwing stones at vehicles and held up traffic. 

 Soon, the news spread and Dalit groups and factions of the Republican Party of India took to the streets at various places. Twenty-five vehicles were damaged across the state, 10 of them in Mumbai, police said.

 A bus was set on fire in Nashik, where additional police forces were deployed. In Malegaon, unidentified people hurled stones at three temples.

 Jaswant jumps to Ayodhya book

 Jaswant: Hooked to books

 New Delhi, July 26: Jaswant Singh is probably enjoying his new-found fame as a writer. So he is penning another.

 The BJP is still reeling from the after-effects of his book, A Call To Honour ? In Service of Emergent India, but Singh has already embarked on another, this time on Ayodhya.

 Going by the controversy A Call To Honour has stoked, the Sangh parivar had better gird up for the one on the temple controversy ? the mother of all tangles.

 A Call To Honour, the first of a series of five books for which Singh has signed a contract with Rupa, is a big success. Though the publishers refused to say how many copies have sold, sources said 4,000 copies were initially printed. The second reprint was ordered soon and what is available in the market now is the fourth reprint. The book, the sources added, has already sold over 12,000 copies.

 But BJP leaders, including Atal Bihari Vajpayee, are reportedly upset about Singhs revelations in the book on the Kandahar hijack, the Gujarat riots and the American mole in former Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Raos office.

 Party leaders today refused to even acknowledge the news about Singhs plans to write a book on Ayodhya. We have had enough controversy for the time being. Please dont start a fresh one, said a leader.

 A senior BJP leader said politicians should turn to writing only after they retire. Narasimha Rao came out with his revelations only after he was convinced he had no political future. Practising politicians should desist from writing memoirs. It only complicates things, he said.

 Going by the barely suppressed anger in the party ranks over his recent book, Singh is sure to invite more trouble with his book on Ayodhya. But he does not seem unduly worried.

 After all, his first book has been a success and theres no reason why the one on Ayodhya shouldnt be. Or, for that matter, the others ? Travels in Transoxiana, Rahim Khan and Martyrs of the Indian Army.

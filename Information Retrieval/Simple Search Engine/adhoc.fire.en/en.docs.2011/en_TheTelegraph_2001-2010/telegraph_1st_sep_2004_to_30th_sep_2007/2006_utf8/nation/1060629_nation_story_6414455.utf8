 BPO rogue faces heat

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, June 28: Bangalore police have nabbed Nadeem Kashmiri, the rogue BPO employee, who filched details pertaining to 20 British customers of HSBCs credit card division last week and passed them on to a crime syndicate that ripped off almost Rs 2 crore from these accounts.

 Kashmiri, 24, was produced before a Bangalore court today and has been remanded in police custody till July 4.

 Sanjay Vir Singh, DIG (economic offences wing), told The Telegraph over phone from Bangalore that compact disks, hard disks and other records seized from Kashmiri were being scrutinised.

 Singh said Kashmiri had earlier worked with Accenture ? a fact that he had concealed in the CV he submitted to HSBC, which he joined last December. It could not be ascertained why he concealed his earlier employment with Accenture and whether he had been sacked or committed any fraud at Accenture. 

 The police stumbled on the Accenture connection quite by accident. Kashmiri had not only given false information in his CV to HSBC but had also given fake addresses. While following the trail, the police spoke to a few acquaintances and discovered he had worked with one of the biggest BPO operators in the country.

 HSBC issued a statement saying it had begun legal action against Nadeem Kashmiri, who until earlier this month was an employee at its Bangalore global service centre.

 HSBC has operated in India for over 150 years, and employs some 20,000 staff in the country. Just under 6,000 are involved in UK customer-related work. All our overseas staff are carefully selected, extensively trained and receive very favourable terms of employment by local market standards.

 It is obviously disappointing for HSBC and our staff that one individual has fallen short of the high standards that we set, but this is a very rare incident.

 The bank said the fraud had been uncovered by HSBCs own security teams and Kashmiri had been suspended in April pending HSBCs investigations, indicating that the matter had been kept under wraps for almost two months.

 Delhi-based cyber law expert Pavan Duggal said: Kashmiri should thank his stars that there is no data protection law in India. If such a legislation had existed, he might have faced very stringent penalties.

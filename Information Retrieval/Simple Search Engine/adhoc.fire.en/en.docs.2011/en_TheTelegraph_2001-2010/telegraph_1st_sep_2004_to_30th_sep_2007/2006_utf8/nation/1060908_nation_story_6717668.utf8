 Sniggers at Rajnath test-case illness

 POORNIMA JOSHI

 Rajnath: Losing ground?

 Dehra Dun, Sept. 7: BJP president Rajnath Singhs prolonged illness is the most talked about issue among delegates in the partys national executive that started here with his address today.

 As a still convalescent Rajnath went through the motions of delivering his second presidential speech, those from his home state confided that the affliction is expected to last at least till the Uttar Pradesh elections are over.

 It is a test case where failure is predetermined. Either he is ill by the prospect of near certain defeat or making ground for an explanation afterwards, smirked a former state colleague.

 Such speculation may well be the product of envy that Rajnaths sudden rise in stature has inspired among his former colleagues in Uttar Pradesh but the fact is he is neither the chosen candidate either to lead the poll campaign nor are the party workers enthused by his presence. 

 Veteran Uttar Pradesh leader Kalraj Mishra today said the most-favoured campaigners for the Assembly polls are Sushma Swaraj and Narendra Modi.

 Unlike Bihar, where the very mention of Modis name was anathema to the BJP and its alliance partner Janata Dal (United), the party is making a strong pitch for Modi to campaign furiously in Uttar Pradesh. 

 Kalraj, however, refused to be drawn into a conversation on why Rajnath is unable to attract even the Thakurs in Uttar Pradesh. Why are you dragging the party president into this? There has never been any Thakur consolidation in UP, he said.

 Rajnath is reportedly busy consulting astrologers who have recently scanned his horoscope. 

 The buzz is that they have assured the BJP president that the cloud would lift by November-end, just when the organisational elections would be coming to a close in the BJP.

 Rajnath is hopeful of bagging a second, fuller term of three years in office by then.

 However, the prospect does not daunt his immediate colleagues, none of whom has shown even a semblance of regard for his statements on policy or strategy. 

 For example, just days after the BJP had been part of a parliamentary resolution condemning Israel for attacking Lebanon, Rajnath lavished praise on Israel for its handling of terrorist strikes, going so far as to condone its recent attack. 

 The party, however, did not ratify its stand following his statement. 

 Last month, Rajnath made a public appeal in Panjim for attacking terrorist camps in Pakistan and Bangladesh.

 Sushma said today that attacking terrorist camps in Pakistan and Bangladesh or the BJP reiterating Rajnaths demand for hot pursuit is not part of the agenda. That issue is not going to be discussed, she said.

 Despite such clear indifference to the party presidents utterances on foreign policy issues, the buzz here is that his astrologers are partly correct. The round-up of the organisational elections by end-November is likely to result in Rajnath being re-appointed as party president.

 After all, he is the ideal candidate to suffer working in the shadow of L.K. Advani and Atal Bihari Vajpayee on one hand and bear routine flouting of authority by his immediate colleagues (on the other), said a party insider.

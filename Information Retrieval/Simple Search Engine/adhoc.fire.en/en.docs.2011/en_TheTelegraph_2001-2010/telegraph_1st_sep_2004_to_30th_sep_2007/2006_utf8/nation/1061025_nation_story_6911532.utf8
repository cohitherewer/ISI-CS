 Teenager stands by lover in Salt Lake

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, Oct. 24: A teenager, who had eloped with her boyfriend and had been living in a Salt Lake flat for the past six months, refused to return home today when police rescued her and handcuffed her husband.

 Reema Chowdhury (name changed), a Class IX student and daughter of a well-to-do farmer, had eloped with 20-year-old Subrata Mondal on her way home from school six months ago.

 After his daughter disappeared from Krishangunj in Nadia, about 100 km from Calcutta, Ranjit accused Subrata, his parents and some of his friends of kidnapping her.

 Police did not pay heed, apparently because they realised that the girl had fled on her own accord. But when Ranjit approached Nadia superintendent of police Ajay Nand, he ordered action to bring home the minor.

 Scared, Subratas father Sukhdeb fled with his wife, son and daughter-in-law Reema to Calcutta, where they rented the house in Salt Lake. 

 Over the past month, the police arrested Subratas brother Priyabrata from Durgapur, where he works, and friends Pradip Biswas and Sudip Biswas. His uncles Akhil Roy and Kalicharan Mondal and his wife Lata were rounded up from Howrah. However, none of them disclosed the whereabouts of Reema, Subrata or his parents.

 In Salt Lake, Subrata took up the job of a consumer goods company salesman.

 The police closed in on their Salt Lake house last night. Subrata and his father were arrested. His mother Karuna was spared as she was not at home.

 Her husband in handcuffs, Reema said: I will not go home with my father. I want to stay with Subrata. 

 The 16-year-old had to be sent to a home for destitutes in Krishnagar.

 We arrested the accused. But the girl says she was not kidnapped and does not want to return to her father. She is a minor, we cant accept her marriage. So she had to be sent to the home. Now it is up to the court to decide, the district police chief said.

 The father and son have been remanded in jail custody by a Krishnagar court.

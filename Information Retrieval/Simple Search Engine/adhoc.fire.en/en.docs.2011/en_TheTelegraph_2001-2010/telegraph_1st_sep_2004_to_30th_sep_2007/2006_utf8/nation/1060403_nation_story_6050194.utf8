 Fire at port trust

 Mumbai, April 2 (PTI): A fire broke out at the Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT) in Navi Mumbai early this morning, police said. No one was injured. 

 The third floor of a building where shippers keep documents, including records of customs clearance, caught fire at 4.20 am, sources at JNPT said. 

 At least seven fire tenders were rushed to the spot, the police said, adding that the operations were still on. 

 Fire brigade personnel rescued 12 people from the building.

 The cause of the blaze was yet to be ascertained, the sources said.

 Several documents were damaged in the fire and will result in delay in clearing cargo to be shipped out, the sources said.

 The port handles about 56 per cent of the total container traffic in the country.

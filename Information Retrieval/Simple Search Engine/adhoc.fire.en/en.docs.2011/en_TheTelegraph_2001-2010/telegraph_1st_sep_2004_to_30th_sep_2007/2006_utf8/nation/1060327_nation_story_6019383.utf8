 Damages for flat handover delay

 new Delhi (PTI): A consumer court has directed the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) to pay a compensation of Rs 50,000 to an allottee who was deprived of possession of her flat for nine years after depositing the initial cost.

 Holding that the act of DDA amounts to deficiency of service, the consumer forum directed it to hand over the flat to Kamala Devi within 30 days. 

 The balance amount of around Rs 2.35 lakh would be realised in instalments only a month after the allottee gets possession of the flat, the forum said.

 The forum asked the DDA to pay Rs 5,000 as cost of litigation to her. It is regretted that the complainant, who had deposited the initial cost of Rs 1.18 lakh from her hard earned money, was deprived of the physical possession of the flat due to high-handedness, insensitiveness, malicious and arbitrary act of the officials, the forum said.

 Lashkar hit on army convoy

 Later, the Lashkar claimed responsibility for the attack by informing a local news agency.

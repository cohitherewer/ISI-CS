 Mulayam banks on Bachchan magic

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 16: If Mayavati wins the Brahmin votes, Mulayam Singh Yadav is counting on the Bachchans to deliver Kayastha votes to him in the Assembly elections due early next year.

 The Kayasthas, who constitute around seven per cent of Uttar Pradeshs population, do not have a leader or party of their own in the state where caste dominates politics. 

 The Samajwadis, therefore, are trying to persuade Amitabh to campaign for them. The superstar, who is a Kayastha with roots in the state, is a close friend of party general secretary Amar Singh. 

 Wife Jaya Bachchans proposed tour across the state is also aimed at wooing Kayasthas for chief minister Mulayam. Jaya is a Rajya Sabha member of the party.

 The Samajwadis have been anxiously watching the growing tilt of Brahmins, who make up around nine per cent of the population, towards the Bahujan Samaj Party. This, they believe, could create an upheaval in the caste equations if there is no commensurate shift in favour of Mulayam.

 In Jaya they have a representative of perhaps the states most famous Kayastha family, and this, the Samajwadis believe, makes them better placed to win over the caste than any other party. 

 Even if Amitabh refuses to go all out to campaign he has in the past expressed his distaste for politics the party has requested the star to be present at some of the crucial rallies Jaya addresses.

 A gain of Kayastha votes would not only neutralise any shift of Brahmin votes to Mayavati, but also the possible loss of some of its own Kshatriya votes to the BJP which is led by a man from the caste, Rajnath Singh, sources said.

 New Delhi, Oct. 25: The Congress today rubbished the speculation that Pranab Mukherjees shift from defence to external affairs was a put-down by Sonia Gandhi and welcomed his appointment.

 He is weighty, experienced and has gravitas and authority, which are required in todays global politics. His statements will be taken seriously by the party, the country and the world community, said party general secretary Janardhan Dwivedi.

 Mukherjee was the Prime Ministers best bet for the job, sources said, adding that external affairs was one ministry the Congress has always treated with utmost seriousness since Independence. 

 The post was held by Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi and P.V. Narasimha Rao, said another general secretary, B.K. Hari Prasad. We could not have picked any (other) name for it. 

 The Congresss biggest hope from Mukherjee is that he will correct the overt pro-US tilt in Indias foreign policy. We were not hundred per cent comfortable with the way our government was cosying up to the US, a source said.

 The sources recalled how in the NDA regime, when Yashwant Sinha was moved out of finance to foreign, one of his first acts was to befriend smaller countries in Africa and Latin America ostensibly to show that India had not identified itself completely with the US. This impression gained ground when Jaswant Singh was external affairs minister.

 While nobody in the Congress puts the Prime Minister on a par with Jaswant, the sources admit that after three comprehensive statements on the Indo-US nuclear deal in Parliament and several explanations outside, sections of the Congress are still not convinced about how the pact would help India in the long run. 

 Niggling doubts remain on what the US expects from us in its share of the bargain, a source pointed out. 

 The Congresss other expectation from Mukherjee is that he will restore the morale of the foreign service after the controversial appointment of Shiv Shankar Menon as foreign secretary by superseding several contemporaries. At least two of them put in their papers in protest while others threatened to go on long leave. 

 Nobody disputes Menons credentials and capability. But it seemed as though the whole thing was done ham-handedly. We hope the new minister will do some damage-containment, said a source. 

 Salvo at Singh

 Describing the cabinet expansion as yet another illustration of Manmohan Singhs diminishing political authority, the BJP today cited nine instances f conflicting statements on national security by the Prime Minister and other key authorities in the UPA.

 The party attacked Singh for re-inducting RJD leader Jai Prakash Narayan Yadav as a minister of state. Yadav had resigned from the cabinet after a non-bailable warrant was issued against him.

 The BJP also expressed concern 

 about the conflicting views in the higher 

 quarters of the government about the role of Pakistan in 

 the Mumbai blasts. 

Munnabhai moves PM

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh 

 was captivated by Lage Raho Munnabhai long before he watched 

 it. 

 In South Africa last month, he 

 reportedly read reviews of the Sanjay Dutt-starrer with 

 great interest and told accompanying journalists that it 

 was a film about a young mans discovery of 

 the universal and timeless relevance of the Mahatmas 

 message.

 Today, when he watched the lovable 

 don and his sidekick Circuit (Arshad Warsi in the film), 

 he was so moved that he told his media adviser Sanjaya Baru 

 during the interval that Munnabhai really captured 

 the power of truth. 

 Singh saw the film with his family 

 and some PMO officials at the auditorium at his residence.

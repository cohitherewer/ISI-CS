 The incident comes close on the heels of reports of two teachers raping and molesting 17 schoolgirls in Jind district for over eight months. Ram Kumar Punia and Rameshwar were arrested on Thursday. 

 Subhash, a Sanskrit teacher at a government school in Sadewala village in Sirsa, had lured the girl with the promise of helping her participate in the Special Olympics, a district officer said.

 The teacher was placed under suspension and transferred to Chaharwala village, district officials said.

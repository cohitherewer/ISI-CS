 New Delhi, Nov. 23: The Chinese Hanuman is happy with the new bonhomie between Delhi and Beijing and wants it to get better.

 Further growth in people -to-people relations and cultural relations are the key to a strong relationship between the two countries, says Zhang Jinlai, better known by his stage name Liu Xiao Ling Tong.

 Liu should know.

 One of Chinas best known actors, Liu is famous in Malaysia, Singapore and China not so much for his roles as Zhou Enlai as his impersonation of Sun Wukong, which translates to monkey king of the south.

 Its a role Lius family has played in operas and films for four generations, earning them much fame and half-a-dozen postage stamps all, says Liu, thanks to Hanuman. 

 Sixth century traveller Hiuen Tsang known to the Chinese as Xuanzang carried back tales from Indian mythology with him, and the monkey king finds extensive mention in his travelogue Journey to the West.

 Experts in Chinese history say Sun Wukong is adapted from Hanuman in Hiuen Tsangs travelogue.

 Few know this in India, but the monkey king is one of the most revered characters in Chinese folklore, with dozens of books and several movies created out of the Chinese fascination of Hanuman, said professor Yukhteshwar Kumar of the Department of Chinese Studies, Delhi University.

 Liu now wants to change that, prompting him to visit India as part of a 70-member Chinese delegation that retraced the path taken by Hiuen Tsang on the eve of Chinese President Hu Jintaos visit.

 Through six countries China, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan and India the delegation used Land Rovers instead of Hiuen Tsangs mules to pass the sites where the traveller is believed to have stopped for rest. But it was their final stop, Nalanda, that Liu was most interested in.

 I have distributed many copies of Hiuen Tsangs classic to my Indian friends there, he says. Hiuen Tsang studied and taught at Nalanda, and a memorial is being built by a joint team of Indian and Chinese architects and designers there.

 The trip to Nalanda from October 15 to 27 was broadcast live on the state-owned China Central TV.

 Liu says he wants India and China to televise movies and serials that bring out the cultural and historical ties the two countries share. 

 Not that it will be easy, he admits.

 But then, both countries have the blessings of no less than the Chinese Hanuman.

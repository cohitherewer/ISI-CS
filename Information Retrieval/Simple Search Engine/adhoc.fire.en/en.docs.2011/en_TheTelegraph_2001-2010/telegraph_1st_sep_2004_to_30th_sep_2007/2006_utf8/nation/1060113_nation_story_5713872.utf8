 Kashmir infiltration worries JJ

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Singh: Mixed bag

 Calcutta, Jan. 12: Confidence-building measures with Pakistan at the highest level notwithstanding, terrorists continue to enjoy infrastructural support across the border from Jammu and Kashmir.

 Infiltration from across the border will continue as long as the infrastructure for terrorists remains intact across the border and we, therefore, cannot say when infiltration will eventually end in this region, General J.J. Singh, the chief of army staff, said today.

 He was in the city on the invitation of the Bengal Initiative for a face-to-face with Bengals leading businessmen and intellectuals.

 Although infiltration across the Line of Control is 30 per cent less than last year, terrorists are entering through other ways and other routes, the general said. We are, however, with the people and have gained the moral ascendancy in Kashmir because we know that 90 per cent of the people in every terrorist-infested place are innocent.

 The chief of army staff also dismissed allegations of human rights violations in Kashmir and other militancy-hit states in the country.

 The Indian Army, he said, is not only the second largest but also one of the best in the world when it comes to respecting human rights. We are going out of the way to ensure this aspect and not a single human rights violation case has been reported recently.

 General Singh expressed satisfaction over the latest developments in the Northeast and on the India-China border.

 He dismissed reports of Chinese troop movement along the border. There are no abnormal movement of Chinese troops and all movements are routine, similar to movement of our troops, Singh said.

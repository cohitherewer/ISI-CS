 Shuffle may spare big guns

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 7: The working committee revamp over, the long-awaited cabinet shuffle might take place before the AICC session later this month.

 Sources in the Congress and the government said it would probably happen after Makar Sankranti on January 14 in deference to the astrological beliefs of ministerial aspirants. The period after the sankranti is believed to be auspicious.

 Sources said Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is ready with the changes. A meeting between him and Congress chief Sonia Gandhi is expected on January 10 to give finishing touches to the exercise.

 The shuffle is not expected to involve large-scale changes at the top. The earlier proposal of bringing in C. Rangarajan, the chairman of the Prime Ministers economic advisory council, as finance minister has reportedly been set aside. The current finance minister, P. Chidambaram, was to have replaced Shivraj Patil as home minister; Patil was to go to defence and the incumbent defence minister, Pranab Mukherjee, to external affairs ? a portfolio held by the Prime Minister since K. Natwar Singhs resignation.

 It was felt that replacing Chidambaram before the February budget was unwise. Patil and Mukherjee will remain where they are and, the sources said, the search is on for a low-key person for external affairs. Till last week, it was speculated that Karan Singh would get the job. However, his appointment as chairman of the Congresss foreign affairs cell yesterday quashed the rumour. 

 The only significant feature of the revamp will be the induction of a Muslim representative as there is none at the moment. Ghulam Nabi Azad is now Kashmir chief minister and P.M. Sayeed has died. Rajya Sabha MP Mohsina Kidwais induction is a strong possibility, the sources said.

 Ram Vilas Paswan may lose one of the portfolios ? chemicals, fertilisers and steel ? because of the perception that with Bihar polls over, his utility has diminished.

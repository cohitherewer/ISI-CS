 Jessica quiz for former top cop

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 7: Delhi police will soon quiz their former commissioner Ajai Raj Sharma in the Jessica Lal murder case.

 A special probe team, headed by special commissioner U.C. Katna, has already questioned Amod Kanth, the Arunachal Pradesh director-general of police. Kanth was the joint commissioner of police (southern range) in 1999 when Jessica was shot dead in socialite Bina Ramanis restaurant in south Delhi.

 Sharma, in his capacity as commissioner of Delhi police from 1999 to 2002, is being considered accountable for the alleged lapses in the murder case probe. He is also likely to be quizzed by the special investigation team. 

 After serving as Delhi police commissioner, Sharma was the director-general of the BSF till his retirement in December 2004.

 Sources in Delhi police said Kanth and Sudhir Yadav, the then DCP (south) and now additional commissioner (Prime Ministers security), have told Katna that they had informed Sharma immediately about the controversial two-gun theory. They had got the report on November 19, 1999, from the forensic lab. 

 The sources also said both Kanth and Yadav during their interrogation accused Sharma of not acting on the report of then joint commissioner (crime) K.K. Paul. In his report, Paul, who is now the commissioner of Delhi police, had urged Sharma to start a fresh case on Jessicas murder. 

 Sharma is likely to be asked why he did not lodge a fresh case straight away to probe the alleged fudging of evidence after getting Pauls report. He will also be quizzed on his contention that he was unaware of the controversial forensic lab report on the two-gun theory eight months after it reached the police.

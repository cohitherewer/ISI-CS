 Calcutta, Nov. 30: If Mamata Banerjees bandh tomorrow isnt all that successful, one man who might not be too unhappy is the US ambassador to India.

 David Mulford, who spent an hour closeted with Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today, wasnt taking sides in Bengal politics, though.

 The American visitor was worried what the snap bandh might do to his schedule in the city and was seeking the chief ministers help.

 I hope my programmes are possible tomorrow. Well have to see what happens, Mulford said after the meeting.

 Bhattacharjee assured him that the utmost care would be taken to ensure he has a hassle-free working day.

 Weve spoken to the police commissioner. Mulford will be provided full security wherever he goes by city and district police, an official in the chief ministers office said.

 Mulfords engagements start at 10.30 am when he flags off an AIDS awareness march from Subodh Mullick Square. He will then drive down to an NGOs home for children before visiting the Frito Lay factory in Dankuni in the afternoon. He leaves for the airport at 6 pm after a news conference to catch his flight back to Delhi.

 The ambassador today invited Bhattacharjee to America. The chief minister told him he didnt want to go on a mere lecture tour and would rather come back with something concrete.

 The meeting, scheduled for half an hour, ran on for over one hour with the chief minister and the diplomat discussing thorny issues like foreign direct investment (FDI) in retail and the agricultural marketing sector.

 They also discussed investments in the chemical, automobile and IT sectors as well as collaborations on education.

 At a news conference, Mulford argued for FDI in retail, to which the Left is opposed. He said even local investment in retail can create problems, for the development of a modern retail sector may harm the small players.

 Asked about the letter he had written to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh earlier this year condemning Bhattacharjees anti-Bush remarks, the ambassador brushed it off as ancient history.

 The Left had reacted strongly to Mulfords letter and demanded that Washington be asked to recall him.

 Mulford today labelled Bhattacharjee an impressive man and an impressive chief minister.

 Earlier in the evening, the ambassador chaired a round-table discussion with academics and officials from major universities in Bengal. He said he was impressed by the flow of Indian students to the US.

 But American students dont get the opportunity to come to India with the ease that they go to other European counties or even to countries like China, he said.

 He cited the instance of the Fulbright scholarship programme. We are having a great deal of trouble with the Fulbright scholarship programme since students from the US face unusual difficulty in getting projects cleared on time. Also, there is an increase in the rejection of projects.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Bare-all candidate lands in lock-up

 M.R. VENKATESH

 Chennai, April 18: Reveal your assets, is the Election Commissions message for vote-seekers. But when prospective Independent candidate Thangavel bared all of his, poll officials thought he was overdoing it.

 The farmer was dragged to a police lock-up from the gates of the Erode collectors office, where he had arrived on a bullock cart yesterday, hands folded, looking to file his nomination from Modakuruchi Assembly constituency for the May 8 polls.

 He was wearing nothing other than the smile on his face and the loincloth around his waist, having stripped off his dhoti and shirt on the way to the utter astonishment of passers-by.

 You cannot come naked into a district collectors office, an election official said over the phone from Erode. He added rather strangely: This is not America.

 Or Italy, where porn star Ilona Staller alias La Cicciolina won a Parliament seat after doing strip-teases at her election campaigns.

 Indian election laws dont lay down a dress code for filing nomination. But a poll official in Erode said: Candidates are expected to observe certain basic norms of decency when they come to file their nomination papers. We will allow him to file his papers if he comes properly dressed.

 The state election department in Chennai, however, is not so sure. Suppose a Nari Kurava (member of a tribe of nomads who wear almost nothing) wants to file his nomination, he should be allowed to do it that way, an official said, promising to look into what had happened at Erode.

 Local officials have wide powers to detain a person in the interest of public order, especially during elections. The likeliest section of the Indian Penal Code under which a scantily dressed person could be arrested is the one dealing with causing annoyance to the public.

 Its not clear if Thangavel, who was freed on bail last night, would come back to file his papers ? and in what sort of dress if he does. He didnt turn up today but has two more days before nominations close.

 The law says that if a person repeats or continues a public nuisance even after being warned by a public servant who has lawful authority to issue such injunction, the offender can be jailed for up to six months or fined or both.

 Sources said Thangavel had shouted something about leading a protest march of bare-bodied farmers in Erode.

 The would-be candidate had told the media in Erode that his act was meant to highlight how politicians have used farmers as a vote bank but done nothing to help them out of poverty, leaving us with only our loincloth.

 Thangavels protest came amid a rice war between Jayalalithaa and DMK chief M. Karunanidhi. The chief minister last night offered ration card holders 10 kg of free rice ? which is half their monthly quota of 20 kg ? to counter the DMKs promise of the cereal at Rs 2 a kg.

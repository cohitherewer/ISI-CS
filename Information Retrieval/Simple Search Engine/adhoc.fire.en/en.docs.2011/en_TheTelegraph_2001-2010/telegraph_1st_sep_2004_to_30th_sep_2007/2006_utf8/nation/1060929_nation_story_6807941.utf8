 Abusive mum gets back kid

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Hyderabad, Sept. 28: When Nazia Bano won custody of her two-year-old daughter from the childs foster mother for the first time, she dumped her on the pavement moments later.

 Two months on, the state womens commission has again handed the child over to Nazia, and this time a weeping Nikita had to part with foster mother Swaroopa Rani.

 After the first verdict in July, Nikita had begun wailing, refusing to go back to the biological mother who would leave her in the bathtub for hours or pour hot milk down her throat.

 In her fury, Nazia, just back from hospital after psychiatric treatment, left the child outside the commission and went home.

 It was reason enough for the commission to reverse its decision and hand the child back to Swaroopa and her businessman husband Venkat Rao.

 Back after a second stint in hospital, Nazia yesterday claimed and got back custody of Nikita.

 Minutes after commission chief Mary Ravindranath announced the verdict, Nikita bit Nazia as the mother tried to take her away. Immediately, a scuffle broke out between Swaroopa and Nazia. 

 Like the legal battle, Nazia, who at 34 is a decade younger than Swaroopa, won the fisticuffs, too.

 Nazia was burning with fury last evening at the influence Swaroopa wielded over her child. Char mahine bhi nahin rakha, kya jadu kari hai meri bacchi par (She cared for my daughter for hardly four months she must have done voodoo on her), the mother said.

 After Nazia was taken away to hospital for the first time, her husband Mohammed Kadir Khan, a mechanic, had travelled around his neighbourhood in Borabanda colony to see if anyone would take care of his daughter. Swaroopa and Venkat, a childless couple, volunteered readily.

 When Nazia returned home in July, she demanded Nikita back and the case came up before the womens commission, which decided in the mothers favour even over Kadirs protests.

 Although the commission changed its mind, it ruled that Swaroopa must bring Nikita over to Nazias home whenever the mother demanded to see her child.

 With the help of Gamana, an NGO that helps psychiatric treatment and rehabilitation of women, Nazia moved the commission again. Gamana stood guarantee for her good conduct.

 It took Nikitas foster parents and father Kadir two hours of cajoling yesterday to persuade the child to go with her biological mother.

 Kadir asked Swaroopa and Venkat to forgive him. Nazia is crazy; what can I do? he said.

 The commission has said if theres further violence on the child, she would be given back to Swaroopa.

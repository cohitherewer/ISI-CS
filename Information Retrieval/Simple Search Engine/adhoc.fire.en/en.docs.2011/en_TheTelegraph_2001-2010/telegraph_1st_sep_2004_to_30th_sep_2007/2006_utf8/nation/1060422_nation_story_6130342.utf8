 Door to hope, uncertainty

 Sahagunj, April 21: As a boy, Biswajit Sil would watch his father and grandfather walk into Dunlops sprawling Sahagunj factory with proud steps. Two decades ago, he had little choice but to join the tyre-maker himself.

 As the 51-year-old returned to work today after a painful wait of five years, his face shone with hope and joy. 

 If the management and workers come together, Dunlop can be revived. Its a big name, after all, he said.

 Sil was among the lucky 44 called by the new management, led by Pawan K. Ruia, to kick off maintenance work as the unit reopened today.

 He came in sharp at 7 in the morning, dressed in a short-sleeve shirt and trousers, signed his name on the new logbook and walked over to the small coconut-breaking ceremony.

 Anxious faces, however, peered from outside the smaller eastern gate ? the main gate on the west has been walled up, apparently in deference to vaastu shastra.

 A group of some 50 workers were huddled together. Will I be called, was the question on everyones mind.

 They knew only 1,189 workers would be retained from among the 2,700 on the rolls. I dont know how they will decide. Only the management and union leaders know, said Amiya Ghosh, who had joined as a contract labourer in 1984. Later in the day, 12 out of 700-odd aspirants were taken in.

 Although few were satisfied with the compensation, there were no slogans. No worker wants to annoy the management before the selection takes place.

 New unit head Samar Saha tried some pep talk: Pawan Ruia (who didnt turn up today) is committed to the company. With your support, Dunlop will turn around.

 But there was no comforting those who would lose their job and the roof over their head, too ? they have to vacate the quarters soon.

 For these people, Dunlop will only remain part of a history they want to forget as soon as they can.

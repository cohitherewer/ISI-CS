 Mulayam target for Sonia amp; son

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 30: When Sonia and Rahul Gandhi kick off the Congresss Uttar Pradesh election campaign this week with a public meeting in Kanpur, they are expected to focus their speeches almost entirely on the Samajwadi Party and its leader Mulayam Singh Yadav. 

 That is not because the Congress thinks it is a serious rival to the ruling party. At best, we can hope to win 50 seats and play a role in the post-poll scenario in case of a hung House, party sources said. 

 But the Congress is thinking about the impact on its government at the Centre if the Samajwadis return to power in Lucknow.

 The immediate fallout, sources said, would be a fillip to the CPMs enterprise to put in place a third front and use it as a weapon to keep the Congress president and the Prime Minister on their toes.

 Despite pressure from CPM general secretary Prakash Karat on moving a parliamentary resolution on the Indo-US nuclear deal, when push comes to shove, the Congress believes the government will not be affected.

 One of the reasons is that none of the third front votaries is expected to act because of Mulayam Singh Yadavs preoccupation with Uttar Pradesh elections. The chief minister is viewed as the nucleus of the enterprise because, after the Left, he has the largest number of MPs. 

 Congress strategists believe that if Mulayam loses, he will push for a third front with greater vigour to save his skin in Lucknow. He knows what it means to have a Mayavati-led government. All the cases against him and the deals done by his government will be under the scanner. On top of it, he has already antagonised the Congress in Delhi. His only salvation will lie in teaming up with Karat and trying for a third front, a source said.

 If he wins, he will be over the moon and so will the CPM. The Congress believes the Left would leverage Mulayams return to get its way with the Centre. Foreign policy, the economy, the sky is the limit for the Left, a source said.

 An added worry for the Congress is that it is badly placed in the two other states that go to the polls with Uttar Pradesh ? Uttaranchal and Punjab. The party is in power in both states but has feedback that infighting and anti-incumbency because of price rise would cost it dear. Already, we can visualise the Left and our allies having the upper hand from then on, a source admitted.

 To shore up its defence against the prospective Left- Mulayam onslaught, the Congress stressed it needs to keep the Rashtriya Janata Dal and the BSP on its side. RJD president and railway minister Lalu Prasad has told his party colleagues he will not be part of the third front and rejected overtures by the V.P. Singh-led Jan Morcha to join him. 

 Congress sources also stressed on the importance of keeping the other UPA constituents, notably the Tamil Nadu block, in humour because of the spectre of the third front and the DMKs good relations with the Left. 

 If things worsen and pressure from the Left and other UPA allies is unbearable, a mid-term poll would be inevitable, the sources said.

 Seats for women

 The Congress has decided to reserve 33 per cent party tickets for women candidates in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections due early next year, state Congress womens wing president Sudha Rai said today.

 The Congress, which is supporting the Mulayam Singh Yadav-led government from outside, would have a decisive stake in the next government after the fresh elections, she claimed.

 Rai alleged that the inefficiency of the Samajwadi Party government was responsible for the increasing atrocities against women in the state.

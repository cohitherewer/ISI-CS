 Omkara puzzle here, prize there

 Marrakech, Dec. 5: Vishal 

 Bharadwaj, whose Omkara baffled Moroccan audiences 

 last night when it was screened quot;out of competition quot; 

 at the 6th Marrakech Film Festival, was buoyed today by 

 the news that he has been named best director at the Cairo 

 Film Festival where his Bollywood adaptation of Shakespeares 

 Othello was included quot;in competition quot;. 

 The Telegraph 

 was present in the packed 1,500-seat main theatre in the 

 Palais des Congress in Marrakech when Omkara was 

 screened. At the end, only a handful of people clapped for 

 a few seconds before the applause died away and the audience 

 filed out silently. 

 Although this was just one reaction, 

 a young security guard who watched the film told The 

 Telegraph, quot;I didnt understand the movie. 

 Anyway, I didnt like the lead actor - I prefer Shah 

 Rukh Khan or Aamir Khan. quot; 

 Perhaps Omkara is an 

 acquired taste, especially for Moroccan audiences who are 

 genuinely passionate about Bollywood cinema but probably 

 still prefer traditional fare. 

 In London, too, Indian audiences 

 in the Gujarati parts of London have left the cinema after 

 watching Omkara not entirely sure what they felt. 

 But Londoners who are quot;educated quot; about Indian 

 cinema believe that the director has done something different 

 and praiseworthy, though they also add that his Maqbool, 

 an adaptation of Macbeth, is a better film. 

 How to get Indian films into competition at prestigious festivals is something that the industry in India has not quite figured out - or even whether it matters that most movies do not make the cut. 

 It was a considered decision of 

 those who select films for entry to the Marrakech Film Festival 

 not to show Omkara in competition but include it 

 for official screening out of competition - as happened 

 with Devdas at Cannes in 2002. 

 Perhaps the audience in Marrakech 

 last night would have felt more sympathetically disposed 

 towards Ajay Devgan, Omkaras lead actor, 

 and his actress wife, Kajol, had they turned up for the 

 elaborate quot;homage quot; that had been organised to 

 honour them, Bollywood cinema, and, indirectly, India. 

 Although Bharadwaj as well as 

 Omkaras scriptwriter, Robin Bhatt, and producer, 

 Kumar Mangat, all critical to the artistic success of the 

 film, came to Marrakech and took a bow on stage, for the 

 audience this was just not the same. 

 For some reason, Kajol appears 

 to have quite a following among young Moroccan women, some 

 of whom made the effort to turn up at the Omkara 

 screening last night elegantly dressed in saris. Others 

 sang Hindi songs or spoke remarkably good Hindi learnt from 

 Bollywood movies. 

 The Telegraph 

 was constantly accosted by young women, one of whom asked: 

 quot;Dont you think I look like Kajol? quot; She 

 went away happy after being assured she looked a lot prettier. 

 It fell to the lone Indian member 

 of the Marrakech jury, the Paris-based Pan Nalin, who has 

 won fame and fortune after directing Samsara, to introduce 

 the Omkara team on the large stage in the absence 

 of Mr and Mrs Devgan. 

 A message from Ajay Devgan expressing regret at his and Kajols absence was read out but no reason was given. 

 Devgan sent his thanks for quot;the honour you have bestowed on us. We regret not being able to be present tonight. Please accept my apologies. We hope to see you soon quot;. 

 In a private aside, Nalin told 

 The Telegraph that he had been quizzed by all and 

 sundry about when the Devgans would arrive in Marrakech. 

 quot;I was even asked this at a party by the Prince (Moulay 

 Rachid, brother of King Mohammed VI) who said the royal 

 family had sent a personal invitation. quot; 

 The problem is that the homage to Ajay Devgan and Kajol had been heavily promoted all over Marrakech in posters and official literature. In some ways, the tribute to the golden couple of Bollywood was the highlight of the festival for many Moroccans. 

 It seems that Bollywood stars are getting a reputation for not turning up at festival functions after agreeing to do so. 

 quot;This is not the first time, quot; commented Nalin. quot;It happened at the Singapore Festival as well. At the last moment, some stars cancelled and they (the authorities) had big billboards that you see, when you enter Singapore on the main highway, for the Indian stars that we are welcoming you. And they never showed up. quot; 

 The authorities were kind enough to fix it for a 14-year-old disabled girl, Iman Jenbari - she had come with her proud parents and put on glittering clothes - to present a bouquet to the visitors from India. The snatches of Hindi songs she sang would not have disgraced a talented teenager from India.

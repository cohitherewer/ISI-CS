 Threat twist to Pataudi poach case 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Pataudi: More trouble?

 Chandigarh, Aug. 26: More trouble could be brewing for former cricket captain Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi in the Kildodh black buck poaching case.

 Madan Singh, a co-accused who had said it was Pataudi who fired the shots that killed the animal, has complained to Jhajjar police that the former cricketer has threatened to kill him if he fails to change his testimony.

 Pataudi and seven others were booked under the wildlife act on June 3 last year after Jhajjar police, during a routine highway check near Dadanpur village, seized a bullet-ridden carcass of a black buck from one of two vehicles they had stopped. Two guns, ammunition and searchlights were also seized.

 Pataudi surrendered before the Jhajjar chief judicial magistrates court on June 18 after failing to secure bail from Punjab and Haryana High Court. 

 He had to spend two nights in a lock-up before he was granted bail.

 Pataudi had called Singh to his New Delhi house on August 20 and asked him to change his statement. When Singh did not oblige, he was threatened, said Naresh Kadyan, president of the Haryana unit of People For Animals (PFA).

 A complaint has been registered with Jhajjar police against Pataudi for the alleged threat.

 We will also be registering a complaint today at (Delhis) Vasant Kunj police station, Kadyan said.

 Singh, a resident of Aurungpur village, was to record his statement against Pataudi in court today but the magistrate was on leave. The hearing has been put off till August 29.

 The PFA will also file an application in court to confiscate Pataudis passport. He had recently travelled abroad. He should not be allowed to go out of the country till the case is settled, Kadyan said.

 Jhajjar police did not comment on Singhs allegation. Everything will be clear during the next hearing. We would not like to comment further, an officer said.

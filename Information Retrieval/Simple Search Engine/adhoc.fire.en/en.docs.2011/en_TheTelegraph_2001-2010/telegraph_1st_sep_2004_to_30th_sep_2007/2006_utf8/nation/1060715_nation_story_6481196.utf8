 Some clues on calls, but RDX a riddle

 New Delhi/ Mumbai, July 14: Security agencies investigating the Mumbai train blasts suggested today that they were close to a breakthrough, and the home ministry is expected to make an announcement soon.

 Thirty-five cellphone calls made from Mumbai and Aurangabad in Maharashtra to Srinagar, Sopore and Baramulla in Kashmir within an hour of the seven blasts on Tuesday have been traced. 

 A call was made from Malad in Mumbai to Afghanistan 25 minutes after the last explosion, between Mira Road and Bhayander at 7.09 pm. Calls from Mumbai have also been traced to Iran, Bangladesh and Dubai. 

 Believed to be equipped to get details of conversations in certain strategic areas, the security agencies are trying to find out if the Lashkar-e-Toiba played a role. Sources said they have some clues pointing to links between senior Lashkar operatives in Kashmir and those behind the blasts on Mumbais lifeline that have killed 200.

 Mumbai police have also come across two email accounts in which operational details of the train blasts were stored in the draft messages box. Since draft mail can be checked by anyone anywhere so long as they have the password, the militants used this method of communication. By sending the mail, they would have risked detection. 

 However, there is no agreement yet on the explosive used ? while Mumbai police have ruled out RDX, the Central Forensic Science Laboratory is not ready to do so yet.

 Sources in the Anti-Terrorist Squad (ATS) of Maharashtra police said either dynamite or ammonium nitrate could have been used, not RDX as was being thought earlier.

 We will be able to tell for sure by Saturday. In all likelihood, it is ammonium nitrate. But one thing is certain, this again proves what we have been suspecting: the strong presence of a local hand, said a top official of the squad which is probing the blasts. 

 Both dynamite and ammonium nitrate are crude chemical explosives. 

 Investigators have been insisting on the basis of available leads that the explosions may have been planned by a larger outfit like the Laskhar but were carried out by local agencies which are part of the terror network in South Asia. The Students Islamic Movement in India (Simi) is yet again at the centre of suspicion.

 The blast carried out by Simi aboard a train at Mumbais Mulund station in 2003 is an exact copy of what we saw on Tuesday, the official said. Then, an explosion had ripped the first class ladies compartment of a local train as it was entering Mulund station. 

 Ammonium nitrate was used in that blast as well and the explosion had ripped off the entire roof of the coach. Metal parts in the compartment were twisted out of shape and the seats were wrecked. The effect of the 7/11 blasts was exactly the same.

 The same explosive was used in the Varanasi blasts in March, in which Simis involvement was alleged again. 

 Meanwhile, television channels showed interviews with a woman who claimed she had seen four men carrying identical briefcases board a train at Jogeshwari and identified two of them as Syed Zabiruddin Ansari and Faiyyaz Kazi, whose pictures were released by police yesterday.

 The woman said she had contacted the police but did not get a response. ATS chief K.P. Raghuvanshi said: We are getting thousands of leads and it is impossible to pursue all of them.

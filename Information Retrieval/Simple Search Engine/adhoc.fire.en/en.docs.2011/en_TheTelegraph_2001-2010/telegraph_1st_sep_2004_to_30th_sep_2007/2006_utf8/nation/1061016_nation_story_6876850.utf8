 Afzal shadow falls on Kashmir table

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mohammad Afzal 

 New Delhi, Oct. 15: The controversy over death row convict Mohammad Afzal has put a question mark on Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs pet initiative of involving Kashmiris, including separatist leaders, in the dialogue process.

 After managing to hold the second round table conference in Srinagar this May, the Centre was hopeful of a third one in October. However, with the entire Valley uniting to back Afzal, guilty of plotting the Parliament attack, and the Sangh parivar demanding he be hanged immediately, the government is on a sticky wicket.

 Before starting final preparations for the third round table, the Centre first wants to present a picture of normality. For this, it wants to engage separatist leaders in talks with the Prime Minister.

 Senior home ministry sources said efforts are on to begin the round of meetings with moderate Hurriyat leader Mirwaiz Umer Farooq, followed by Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front chief Yasin Malik and head of Peoples Conference Sajjad Lone after Id.

 During the meetings, the government will also try and get the separatists to agree to join the third round table. 

 Despite serious efforts by the government, including back-channel diplomacy, none of the separatist leaders took part in the earlier round tables.

 Another important issue before the government is to get reports from all the five working groups on Jammu and Kashmir, whose formation was announced by the Prime Minister in Srinagar in May. The reports are to be tabled in the third round table. 

 However, only two groups convened by N.C. Saxena and Hamid Ansari have submitted their reports. They deal with good governance and strengthening relations across the Line of Control and have to recommend measures to simplify procedures to facilitate travel across the LoC. None of these subjects is considered very crucial.

 The government is yet to get a convener for Group V, which has to deal with the most contentious issue of strengthening relations between the state and the Centre. It has to deliberate on matters relating to the special status of Jammu and Kashmir within the Indian Union and suggest methods of strengthening democracy, secularism and the rule of law.

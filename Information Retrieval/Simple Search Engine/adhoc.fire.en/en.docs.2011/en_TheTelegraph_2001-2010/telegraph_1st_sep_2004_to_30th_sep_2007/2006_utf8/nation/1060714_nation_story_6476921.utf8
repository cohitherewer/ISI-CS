 New Delhi, July 13: Air marshals were deployed on select flights within India as well as those headed abroad in the wake of the Mumbai train blasts.

 We have deployed air marshals today. Some more security systems are already in place, civil aviation secretary Ajay Prasad said. 

 As a result of tighter security measures ? passengers and baggage had to go through a second security check ? flights were held up. Passengers were subjected to the second check at the ladder point or on the aerobridge.

 The delays were maximum at Terminal 1B, where repairs and construction are on as part of the airport modernisation being undertaken by a joint venture led by the GMR group. To make matters worse, some X-ray machines were not functioning. Jet Airways, Air Sahara, Spicejet and Air Deccan, which use this terminal, were the hardest hit. At least one Jet flight to Mumbai was late by four hours.

 Indian and Kingfisher flights from Terminal 1A were delayed by about 30 minutes on average.

 Long queues at the security check counters were seen at airports around the country. Officials asked passengers to bear with the delays because it was for their own safety.

 Thursday was the first day of the new procedures. Delays will be reduced soon, Prasad said. Instructions have been issued and we hope the kind of queues witnessed this morning will not be repeated.

 He is meeting representatives of Airports Authority of India and the GMR group.

 Officials said flights would be selected at random for marshals to be deployed but certain sectors considered sensitive would have permanent marshals on board.

 There would be significant changes in security measures at airports. We have deployed dog and bomb disposal squads. Emphasis will be on using more equipment and technology rather than manual searching, Prasad said.

 The measures are being taken up because some reports have been received by the security agencies that some important airports and tourist destinations in the country are under threat. 

 Airports in the country have been on high alert since Tuesday night.

 For some time, visitors to airports will not be allowed into the terminal buildings. All sensitive airports, like Srinagar, Mumbai, Delhi and Hyderabad, are being equipped with anti-explosive devices.

 An intelligence committee is believed to have considered the possible scenario of terrorists wrapped in plastic explosives taking over aircraft or blowing up installations. 

 The use of body scanners, which can see through clothing to detect suspicious objects, could be considered but the government has to clear it first.

 The civil aviation secretary said airport and airline employees were already being vetted by security agencies before they were given entry permit. This system would be further strengthened.

 Officials said they are trying to beef up other security systems by streamlining airport access through smart cards, introducing passenger profiling and strengthening cockpit doors of aircraft owned by state-run airlines.

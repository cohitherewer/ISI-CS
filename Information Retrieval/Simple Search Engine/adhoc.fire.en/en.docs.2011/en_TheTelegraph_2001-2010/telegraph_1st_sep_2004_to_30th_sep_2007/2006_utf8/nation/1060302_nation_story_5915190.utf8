 Cong murmur on US slant

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 1: The Congress has put on a brave demeanour in the face of growing protests against US President George W. Bush and the anxiety expressed by its members, especially Muslims, at the pro-US tilt in the UPAs foreign policy.

 At a news conference today, party spokesperson Jayanthi Natarajan said: We stand firmly behind the government, let there be no mistake.

 Regarding the protests, she said: It is everybodys democratic right to organise protests, but we will treat our visitors with the hospitality and honour that is required.

 However, privately, the questions members asked were:

 Why did the government fail to de-link the proposed nuclear pact from the Iran vote? If it was just the nuclear deal, perhaps nobody would have got so worked up. But in peoples perception and particularly that of the minorities, the two have got mixed up, said a Muslim MP.

 It was pointed out that the Prime Minister, in an interview during his US visit in July 2005, had placed the Iran issue in the context that India had a large number of Shia Muslims and old civilisational links with the country. When the government voted against Iran, did Singh disown his remarks? Or was it sheer expediency? asked a member of a minorities cell.

 Senior leaders were rattled that on economic and foreign policies, the UPA government was following the NDAs course after going hammer and tongs at the Vajpayee government.

 Congress sources said while the Vajpayee government had taken India decisively closer to the US, there was a difference between then and now. That is the war on Iraq and the threat to attack Iran. Day after day, we are bombarded with news of mosques being bombed and civilians being killed. Can we ignore these?

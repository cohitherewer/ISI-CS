The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 A health minister, but no doctors

 NARESH JANA

 Mishra: Advising patience 

 Ranisarai, April 16: No X-ray machine, no telephone, surgery at night by lantern. But what about the doctors?

 Ask Muchiram Singh of Ranisarai ? a village about 170 km from Calcutta ? in the Belda area of West Midnapore.

 Petey majhey majhey jantrana hoy kintu bar bar esheo phire jete hoy, saradin apekkha koreo daktarke paoa jai na.? Jakhoni ashi, kajer kamai hoy tai ar ashbo na bhabchhi (I often have stomach pain, but you dont get to meet the doctor even after waiting the whole day.... Whenever I come here I have to be absent from work, so I dont think I shall come any more).

 Singh is just one among the hundreds who come to the block primary health centre at Deuli in Narayangarh block ? the biggest block in Bengal ? and return without treatment every day. Ranisarai is about 15 km from his home.

 The usual story about healthcare in Bengal? Yes ? only Narayangarh happens to be the constituency of the states health minister, Surjya Kanta Mishra. Himself a physician, the minister had won by over 26,000 votes in 2001.

 The 15-bed health centre is always crammed with at least 30 patients. It has no generator, and power supply is erratic. Every month, it refers about 50 patients to Kharagpur State General Hospital, 40 km away, for X-rays.

 Our MLA is the health minister, but looking at us you wont know it. He granted Rs 2 crore so that the Rajgram primary health centre in Danton (a neighbouring constituency) could be upgraded. But we need to go all the way to Kharagpur to save a near ones life, said Kalpana Dolai of Saluka, about 22 km from Deuli.

 Block medical officer Asish Kumar Mondal said nothing can be done for the patients unless the health centre is upgraded. We get patients from all corners of this huge block. So, its very difficult to treat everyone. That explains the rising number of private nursing homes and pathology units in Narayangarh.

 The nursing homes, however, make the villagers pay through their nose for emergency treatment.

 Earlier, we would coax the man at the pharmacy to prescribe medicines but they fear these nursing home owners. However, they save us a lot of hassle during minor ailments, Narayan Roy of Kutki said.

 People have to be patient, the minister said. Is it possible to improve the conditions at every health centre overnight? We have already upgraded 70 block primary health centres across Bengal. Work is on at another 70. We plan to upgrade the rest, too.

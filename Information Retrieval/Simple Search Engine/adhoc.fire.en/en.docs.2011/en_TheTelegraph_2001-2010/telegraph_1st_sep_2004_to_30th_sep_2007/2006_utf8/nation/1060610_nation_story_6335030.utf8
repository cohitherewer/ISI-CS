 Blast in Guwahati market

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Guwahati, June 9: Peace looked like a mirage and Ulfas professed desire to start a dialogue a mere ploy as militants suspected to be from the banned group triggered a blast in a crowded Guwahati market today, killing five persons and wounding at least 20.

 The explosion at Machkhowa market followed a series of four blasts yesterday, two of them in Dhubri district, one in Nagaon and another in Mangoldoi.

 The Machkhowa blast occurred despite security forces being on high alert since last evening. The administration almost saw it coming with arrested Ulfa leader Mrinal Hazarika telling interrogators that the outfit had planned subversive operations across the state on June 10 and 11.

 Additional superintendent of police 

 (city) Rajen Singh said the IED had been planted in the 

 wholesale vegetable market on Tarun Ram Phookan Road around 

 4.15 pm. He said the IED may have been hidden in a basket 

 of vegetables.

 Sardar scramble

 New Delhi, Oct. 31: BJP 

 leaders today made a fresh grab for the legacy of Sardar 

 Vallabhbhai Patel, vying with each other to be seen remembering 

 the Iron Man on his birth anniversary.

 L.K. Advani, once referred to as Loh Purush himself, released a book on Patel and spoke of his admiration for the original Iron Man. 

 Patel, he said, had been denied his rightful place in history so that Jawaharlal Nehrus contribution could be overstated.

 Party chief Rajnath Singh led a group of colleagues to laud Patels achievements, but Chhote Sardar Narendra Modi was away in Singapore.

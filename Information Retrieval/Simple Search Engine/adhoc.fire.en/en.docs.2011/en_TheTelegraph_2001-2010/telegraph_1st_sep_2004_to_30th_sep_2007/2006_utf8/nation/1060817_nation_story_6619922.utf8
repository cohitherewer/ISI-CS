 Rookie guard to killer, in 15 days

 ANANYA SENGUPTA

 Shah Rukh: Anxious 

 Mumbai, Aug. 16: Yatendra Singh Chauhan, the private security guard at Shah Rukh Khans bungalow who shot dead a colleague on Monday night, had started work only on July 30.

 Police say the 28-year-old from Mainpuri in Uttar Pradesh arrived in Mumbai two days before he was assigned to the bungalow Mannat by the security agency Tops, a claim the agency refuses to confirm. 

 We hired him only when he had his clearance, said Rahul Nanda, the Tops CMD. The agency had given him 15 days for police clearance, he added.

 But Tops admits Chauhan was directly assigned to the seaside house of the star who is said to be on the hit list of militant groups. Following intelligence reports that he could be a target of militants, Shah Rukh was given Y-category security at a meeting of top police officials on July 29. 

 All our men have security clearance. Something like this cannot be safeguarded against. How can you hold a company responsible for such an act? How would we know whats going on in a persons mind? asked Nanda, showing copies of the police verification papers.

 In the same breath, he said: The guards did not fight amongst themselves, it was a clear accident.

 But he does not have an answer to the question the police are asking how could Tops send a rookie to guard Indias biggest film star, that too when he is on militants hit lists?

 Chandrapratap Singh, the colleague Chauhan shot dead with his six-chambered revolver, was 22.

 Chauhan has been booked for murder and remanded in police custody till August 22. His wife Nisha, 25, who was at Bandra police station today, could only say: This cant be possible. She has a six-year-old son and an ailing mother-in-law to look after.

 Lakhan, another Tops employee posted at Mannat who was witness to the incident, has said in his statement that it was an accident, sources said. 

 But the police are not convinced. It was not an accident for sure. Chandrapratap was shot at point blank range! How can it be an accident? He also was definitely unstable, otherwise how do you explain the fact that he fired at such little provocation, said ACP (western region) Bipin Behari. 

 Shah Rukh, who had called up Nanda to express anxiety, has discontinued the services of the agency that he had hired two years ago after he was offered police cover. Policemen will be posted outside Mannat while an officer will accompany the actor in Mumbai and outside, sources said.

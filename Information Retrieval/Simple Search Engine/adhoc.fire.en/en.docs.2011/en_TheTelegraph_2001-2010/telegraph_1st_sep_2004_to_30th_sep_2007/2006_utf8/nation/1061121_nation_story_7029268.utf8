 Suicide glare on TN school

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chennai, Nov. 20: A missionary school near Salem has been sucked into a storm after the body of a Plus Two student was found floating in the well on its premises on Saturday.

 Sukhanya, a student of Fathima Girls Higher Secondary School in Omalur, had gone missing a few days ago from the hostel of the 40-year-old institution known for its high standards, strict discipline and good results.

 Local people today erupted in anger against the suspected suicide of the girl, breaking windows and damaging property on the school premises.

 They claimed that there was something suspicious about the death as students were being constantly pushed to produce exceptional results.

 Police sources said Sukhanya may have been driven to suicide by her poor showing in the internal exams. She had reportedly been depressed since the results were announced, more so because her board exams were due next March.

 There may be other reasons for the girls death, which we are investigating, Salem district superintendent of police Bhaskaran said over the phone. 

 The school has been closed down from today.

 Sukhanyas parents, who stay in a village in adjoining Dharmapuri district, have refused to buy the suicide theory. I wanted my daughter to get good higher education and that is why we sent her to this reputable school near Salem, her father, Shanmugham, said.

 Sixteen persons, including the watchman and those who vandalised the premises, have been arrested. Tamil Nadu agriculture minister V.S. Arumugam visited the school today.

 He is believed to have asked the school authorities to consider disciplinary action against the teachers and other staff members on duty on Saturday.

 The DMK government had so far stayed away from the row for fear that its actions would be construed as interference in a minority-run institution.

 Sources alleged that a rival school, which was not performing very well, had been trying to use the suicide to tarnish Fathima Girls image. 

 The state government has ordered a probe into Sukhanyas death. Chief minister M. Karunanidhi has announced a solatium of Rs 50,000 for her family.

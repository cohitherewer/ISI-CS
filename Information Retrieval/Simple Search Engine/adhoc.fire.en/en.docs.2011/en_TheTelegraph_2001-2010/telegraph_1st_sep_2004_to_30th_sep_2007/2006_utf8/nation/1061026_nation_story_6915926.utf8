 Mum on Mamata

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Oct. 25: The Congress high command has given its Bengal unit the go- ahead on protests against farmland acquisition together with Mamata Banerjee but not on other issues.

 As far as the land issue is concerned, we have got the right signals from Delhi. But we havent received any positive response to whether the Congress can forge an unofficial alliance with the Trinamul Congress, state party working president Pradip Bhattacharya said today.

 Restrained by the leadership, the Congress leader said: Having a talk with Mamata Banerjee will be of little help now.

 Trinamul, officially still an ally of the BJP-led NDA, had been hoping for positive vibes from the Congress brass to extend the joint agitation against the Left Front government beyond land acquisition.

 During a meeting with AICC leaders on Sunday, state Congress functionaries argued in favour of a sustained agitation with Trinamul on Singur and the state governments move to acquire thousands of acres of farmland for setting up industrial units. 

 The leadership saw reason in the argument but refused to make it clear whether the Bengal Congress should have an unofficial political tie-up with Mamata.

 However, during the September bypolls to three Lok Sabha and one Assembly constituency, the Congress and Trinamul helped each other out by ensuring that only one Opposition candidate contested for a seat.

 Bhattacharya, who met AICC general secretary Margaret Alva on Sunday, sought her comments on Mamatas proposal that the two parties come together to take on the CPM. However, Alva spoke only about the Congresss reservations on acquisition of agricultural land. 

 Our high commands stand is that fertile agricultural land should not be used for setting up industry, Bhattacharya said.

 A state Congress leader who was present during the Sunday meeting, said the leadership is still fussy about Mamatas association with the BJP and does not want to attach much importance to her theory of a joint agitation on all issues.

 A section of the state Congress led by former MLAs Subrata Mukherjee, Shankar Singh and Abdul Mannan tried to impress upon Alva that closer ties with Trinamul were the need of the hour. They even pointed out Mamatas bid to gradually distance herself from the BJP. 

 But their arguments did not cut much ice, said a PCC leader close to external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee, the partys Bengal president.

 Mamata said: This is an internal affair of the Congress and I cannot dictate the partys policies. Alva had apparently reacted positively when she suggested the joint movement to her.

 If the two parties work together, the CPM will feel the heat, Mamata added.

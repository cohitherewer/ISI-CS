 Priya briefs Sonia on CM Singur stand

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 13: Priya Ranjan Das Munshi today appealed to Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee to suspend the Singur operation for a fortnight and create an appropriate ambience to speak to parties opposing the handover of land to the Tatas.

 The parliamentary affairs and information and broadcasting minister also asked Bengal chief minister Bhattacharjee to revoke section 144 from the area and withdraw police cases against protesters.

 According to Das Munshi, Bhattacharjee told him: I have acquired the land. How can I roll back (the decision)?

 The minister reported his conversation to Congress chief Sonia Gandhi. Sources said she is closely watching how things are unfolding but has not yet spoken her mind.

 Das Munshi said: It wont be good if any political leader creates an extreme situation by sitting on such a long fast.

 He also shared his concern about Mamata Banerjees health with Trinamul MP Dinesh Trivedi and stressed the importance of finding a solution in the given circumstances.

 Pension bill delay

 Das Munshi said the pension regulatory authority and the banking regulation bills would not come up in this session because talks between the government and the Left parties were inconclusive.

 Nor would the communal violence bill, though the standing committee had presented its report.

 But the bills on OBC quota in government institutes and rights of tribals and certain non-tribals over forest land would be introduced. Das Munshi was confident both would be passed in this session.

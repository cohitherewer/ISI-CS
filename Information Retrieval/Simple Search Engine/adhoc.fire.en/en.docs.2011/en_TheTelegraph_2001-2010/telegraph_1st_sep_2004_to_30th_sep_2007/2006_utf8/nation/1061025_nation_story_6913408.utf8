 Punishment plea on Tagore poem

 Puducherry (PTI): 

 A rights organisation here has appealed to the government 

 of the Union territory to initiate action against B.V. Selvaraj, 

 the secretary with the department of art and culture, for 

 alleged distortion of a poem by Rabindranath Tagore.

 An adaptation of the poem Where 

 the mind is without fear was published under the title, 

 Tagore on Pondicherry, in a publication, A 

 glimpse of our own Pondicherry, brought out by the department 

 recently, the secretary of the Federation of Peoples 

 Rights, K. Sukumaran, said in his appeal.

 Sukumaran said Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had expressed resentment over the distortion of the poem and the release of the publication at a festival of Pondicherry held in Paris recently. In a letter to chief minister N. Rangasamy, Bhattacharjee had sought withdrawal of the publication, Sukumaran said.

 The poem has projected a negative image of Puducherry till recently known as Pondicherry by distorting the verses of Tagore, Sukumaran alleged.

 Militant bail after 16 years

 Jammu (PTI): 

 JKLF militant Farooq Ahmed Dar alias Bitta Karate, an accused 

 in 19 cases who has been in jail for over a decade and a

 The anti-terror court had ordered 

 his immediate release for four months if he furnished a 

 bail bond and personal surety of Rs 1 lakh each.

 The court pointed out on Tuesday that Dars co-accused had already been granted bail. 

 The militant, believed to be instrumental in the exodus of Kashmiri Pandits from the Valley, faces several murder charges.

 Cop in bribe net

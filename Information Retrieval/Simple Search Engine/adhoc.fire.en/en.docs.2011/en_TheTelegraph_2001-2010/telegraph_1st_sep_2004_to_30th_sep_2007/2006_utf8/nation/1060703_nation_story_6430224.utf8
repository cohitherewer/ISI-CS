 Buddha launches clear-air mission

 - Bengal govt to publish road map on industry to placate partners

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, July 2: Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today agreed to circulate among Left Front partners a note on projects to be undertaken by the Salim Group and the Tatas and the land to be acquired for them.

 Likely to be a road map on industrialisation without losing focus on agriculture, the document will also elaborate on investment offers made by agri-business companies like Reliance and the governments efforts to safeguard farmers interests, an official said. 

 The decision to prepare the note was taken at talks Bhattacharjee had with Forward Bloc and RSP leaders this morning at the CPMs Alimuddin Street headquarters. 

 Besides Bhattacharjee, commerce and industries minister Nirupam Sen briefed the leaders about the governments industry drive and the CPMs stand on it in the wake of complaints that the partners were being kept in the dark about new projects.

 It is difficult to articulate a stand in a half-an-hour meeting. That is why we asked for the note from the chief minister. We also want to know about the perspective plan for industry and urbanisation and a land use map for a clear idea about the governments moves, RSP state secretary Debabrata Bandopadhyay said after the meeting.

 PWD minister Kshiti Goswami of the RSP said Sen would prepare a draft. After being ratified by the front, it will be published in the form of a booklet for public consumption. 

 The RSP has already submitted a note to the CPM brass asking for the land use map and expressing reservations about handing over vast tracts of land to the Salim Group. 

 The Indonesia-based con- glomerate has asked for around 37,000 acres across south Bengal. 

 The chief minister assured us that the group would not be given all 37,000 acres. Only land for the Barasat-Raichak road and the Raichak-Kukrahati bridge would be acquired at this stage, Goswami said.

 But the chief minister also told the RSP leaders that the Salims will be given land to develop a satellite township at Baruipur, 26 km from Calcutta, where the new South 24-Parganas district headquarters will be located. 

 The special economic zone that the Salim Group will build at Hadia would not disturb farmland, Bhattacharjee said. 

 Agriculture minister Naren De, who was part of the Bloc team that met the chief minister today, said: The cabinet core committee comprising ministers from all key front constituents will discuss threadbare all projects to be undertaken in Bengal. 

 At an earlier front meeting, the allies submitted questionnaires to the CPM leadership seeking information about projects for which agricultural land had to be acquired immediately.

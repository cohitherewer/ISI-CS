 Dogfight for plane pie

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 20: The US, Russia and Sweden will vie for a share of Indias growing military aircraft market at Februarys Aero India show in Bangalore.

 The fair, where top aviation companies of the world are keen to showcase their planes, has now surpassed similar events hosted by Singapore, Malaysia and Dubai.

 Over 450 companies, including 30 from the US, will participate.

 Bangalores Yelahanka airstrip will be filled with the roar of the F-16s and F-18s the two aircraft competing with each other with the US hoping to land orders for 126 combat aircraft from the Indian Air Force. Jets made by the Europeans will be around, too. 

 The Russians will try to persuade IAF bigwigs about their MiG-29m. The Swedes will pitch their Grippen multi-role fighters. Canadas Bombardier will be part of the show. Falcon jets and the F series aircraft from the US will be there, too. 

 Officials said the air displays might involve over 100 jets.

 The IAF, keen to expand its fleet, would like to finalise orders soon. And the show would provide a perfect setting to check out everything on offer, says an official.

 The helicopter market is also whirring with activity. Companies are eyeing the navys planned order of 60 and the armys proposal to buy 200 of them. There is also a buzz that a dozen choppers could be needed for VVIP travel.

 This will be the sixth Aero India show, which is held every two years. International bids have been called for professionals to organise the February event. 

 The contract went to the UKs Farnborough International, known for hosting the Farnborough Air Show, the worlds biggest.

 Organisers want to strike a balance between military and civil aviation. Past events, organised by the ministry of defence, had a predominance of military planes. The change has helped draw many first-time participants.

 Sonia quits Rajiv chair

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Sonia Gandhi

 New Delhi, April 8: After quitting as Lok Sabha MP and chairperson of the National Advisory Council, Sonia Gandhi has now quit as chairperson of the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation.

 A PTI report said she has also stepped down as head of the Indira Gandhi Memorial Trust and the Jawahar Bhavan Trust, but there was no official word.

 Although the Rajiv foundation does not enjoy the clout of the NAC ? which gave her the rank of a cabinet minister and the authority to keep tabs on the governments performance ? it has a fairly high profile, and Sonia is not taking any chances.

 The Congress chiefs serial resignations came after the controversy sparked by the unseating of Jaya Bachchan as Rajya Sabha MP. The Opposition had then petitioned the President, arguing Sonia could be similarly disqualified because she was an MP and headed the NAC simultaneously.

 The resignation from the government-aided foundation set up in the memory of her husband comes days before Sonia files her nomination for the Rae Bareli bypoll.

 Earlier this week, she had quit as chairperson of the Amritsar-based Jallianwala Bagh National Trust.

 There is no official word yet on whether she would quit as the head of other organisations that could be seen as offices of profit. She heads the Jawaharlal Nehru Memorial Fund, Indian Council for Child Welfare and Kamla Nehru Memorial Hospital Society. She is also the patron of the Nehru Trust for Cambridge University.

 When Parliament reconvenes next month, it is expected to bring in a bill clarifying the law that bans MPs from holding certain offices under the government.

 The Rajiv foundation was set up in June 1991, weeks after the assassination of the former Prime Minister. Its mandate is to work towards his vision for India. The foundation collaborates with NGOs in primary education, empowerment of women and healthcare in backward areas. 

 EC query

 The Election Commission today asked the Haryana government for details of newspaper advertisements it had brought out on April 5. The BJP had complained the advertisements, which carried pictures of Sonia, violated the poll code.

 ...Govt goes IT courting

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Oct. 17: The Bengal government has requested IIT Kharagpur to prepare a concept note on how to attract high-end IT firms.

 State IT minister Debesh Das revealed this at the inaugural session of IT East, the annual show organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry. 

 We have a reasonable number of IT and ITES companies in the state. Now, we want companies that design and manufacture chips. We have requested the IIT to tell us how to get the big corporations, Das said, adding that the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government would like companies such as Intel and Texas Instruments to set up here. 

 He said the government would earmark a special zone either in Sector V in Salt Lake or in Newtown for the high-end IT companies. 

 Regarding the states request for the concept paper, IIT Kharagpur dean of sponsored research and industrial consultancy, Partha Pratim Cha- krabarti, said: The government has told us what they want.We have started working on the concept note and we expect to submit it in two to three months. 

 Das said the state government is trying to expand the knowledge pool in Bengal. Last month, our chief minister wrote a letter to the Union human resource development minister and requested the Centre to consider Bengal for setting up an Indian Institute of Information Technology.

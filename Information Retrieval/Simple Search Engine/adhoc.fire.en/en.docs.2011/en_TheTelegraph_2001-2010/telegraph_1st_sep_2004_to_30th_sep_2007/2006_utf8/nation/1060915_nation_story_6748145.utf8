The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Development vs Dalu, under Ghani shadow

 INDRANIL GHOSH AND DEBARATI AGARWALA

 The rivals: Abu Hasem 

 Khan and Sailen Sarkar 

 Malda, Sept. 14: Not long ago, Malda was as famous for Abu Barkat Ataur Ghani Khan Chowdhury as for its mango.

 Last Sunday, election observer Upendra Kishore Chauhan did what many in Malda would consider unthinkable. He stopped his car at Jhaljhalia near the railway station, stepped out and, pointing at the billboard a short distance away, said: Thats not on. Get it removed.

 By dusk, that and several other billboards had been wiped clean. The slogan pay homage one last time ran under Khan Chowdhurys face on the billboards put up by the Congress, which has fielded his brother Abu Hasem Khan for Saturdays bypoll. 

 No party or candidate will be allowed to exploit the memories of a dead person to influence ballots, Chauhan said.

 The seat fell vacant in April after the death of Khan Chowdhury, who had held it for 26 years. Abu Hasem, aka Dalu, is a former MLA and has the support of Mamata Banerjees Trinamul Congress.

 It is nothing sort of blasphemy, muttered the local Congress leadership. 

 Rules are rules, said the CPM, conscious that the face of the late Anil Biswas adorns acres of walls in the district. 

 The Malda election is expected to be a cliff-hanger. Five candidates are in the fray, including one from the BJP, but the battle will be confined to Dalu and Sailen Sarkar, an MLA for 25 years and a minister for over 10. 

 The alliance between the Congress and the Trinamul, the two main Opposition parties, will face the toughest test here. Also, the outcome will determine the fate of Priya Ranjan Das Munshis plans. 

 The information and broadcasting minister, who does not get along with state unit president Pranab Mukherjee, is in charge of the Malda election. A setback here will spell doom for Das Munshis efforts to stitch up a coalition in north Bengal with himself at the helm.

 Guided by Das Munshi, Dalu is trying to charm voters with a cocktail of legacy, emotions, promises and a dash of religion. I think Malda will continue to support us, says Dalu, 59. Many voters have begun to point out how I resemble my brother whom they cannot forget. 

 Sarkar, who is playing the development card, counters: Since the Congress leaders are invoking Ghani Khan so much, they should explain why he had been kept outside the government since 1986.

 Part-rural, part-urban, Malda is home to 12 lakh Hindu and Muslim voters spread across seven Assembly segments, four of which are held by the CPM.

 The numbers appear to give the CPM a small edge. But whether the Congress-Trinamul alliance clicks, how far the BJP can make an impact and how the voters react to Dalu not even a pale version of the brother who won by 111,000 votes in 2004 will decide this election.

 Exit poll on SC radar

 SINGH GYANANT KUMAR

 New Delhi, Feb. 20: The Supreme Court today asked for the response of political parties and media organisations on a public interest litigation that sought a ban on the publication or dissemination of opinion and exit polls during elections.

 The Centre, the Election Commission and the Press Council of India, to whom notices had been issued, have filed their responses before the court.

 A bench of Justices A.R. Lakshmanan and Dalveer Bhandari issued notices to the Congress, the BJP and the Telugu Desam Party, besides media organisations, while allowing an application by advocate D.K. Thakur to include more respondents to his PIL filed last year.

 Thakur has sought the ban on the ground that publication of such polls affected election results.

 The Centre has submitted that it is against amending the Representation of the People Act, 1951, to prohibit publication or dissemination of results of opinion or exit polls as it would clash with the fundamental right to speech and expression.

 The Union law ministry tossed the ball into the poll panels court and asked it to frame guidelines for the government and also asked the media to take due care and caution.

 The ministry said in its affidavit that information from divergent and antagonistic sources should be available to citizens to help them make an informed choice.

 The commission, on the other hand, said it had repeatedly asked the government to insert a new section in the Representation of the People Act to prohibit publication of results of such polls from the date of notification till the conclusion of all phases of elections.

 The panel pointed out in its affidavit that it had to recall guidelines it had framed after they were challenged in court.

 The press council said it, too, had framed guidelines but they were merely declaratory with moral force.

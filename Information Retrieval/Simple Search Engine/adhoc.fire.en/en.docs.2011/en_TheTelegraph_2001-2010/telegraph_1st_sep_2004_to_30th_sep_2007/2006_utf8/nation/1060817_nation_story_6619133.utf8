 Selloff next on Singh table

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 New Delhi, Aug. 16: The government will speak to Left and DMK leaders to break the impasse over its divestment proposals once the monsoon session of Parliament ends, sources said.

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had put all such proposals on hold after the DMK raised a furore over the cabinets decision to offload 10 per cent of government shares in Neyveli Lignite Corporation in June. 

 Around that time, the Congress had opposed the plan to divest the same percentage of shares in another public sector corporation, the Orissa-based Nalco. 

 The Prime Minister is likely to host a dinner for the leaders of UPA parties and the Left on August 22 and he may gently try and suss out their minds on divestment, the sources said. 

 Before that, he is expected to meet the Congresss senior functionaries, including general secretary and Rajya Sabha MP V. Narayanaswamy who spearheaded the opposition to Nalcos divestment, and understand their objections.

 Narayanaswamy, who is in charge of Orissa, and state leaders had told party president Sonia Gandhi the ruling Biju Janata Dal had turned the Nalco divestment plan into a plank for the Orissa panchayat elections.

 But the feeling at the Congress headquarters was that the state leaders had blown the issue out of proportion. The governments assessment was that Orissa chief minister Naveen Patnaik is investor-friendly.

 The Prime Ministers unilateral announcement putting divestment plans on hold was seen by the Congress and a section of the government as a manifestation of his sense of peeve at not being able to do what he wanted. Sources said his message to the Left and the UPA would be that if they wanted money for social sector initiatives, hard measures like PSU divestment and petro price hike were necessary.

 Singh wants the divestment dispute resolved before he leaves for the Non-Aligned Movement summit in early September. 

 Hopefully, he will tide over the crisis that arose over the nuclear deal by the end of this week. Then he will prepare to handle the next big problem, a source said.

 The government continues to be anxious about the office-of-profit bill, which has not yet been signed by President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam after it was passed in the first week of the monsoon session. The fate of nearly 40 MPs is linked to the bill, sources said.

 The Prime Minister had an unscheduled one-to-one 15-minute meeting with the President on the sidelines of the Independence Day at home hosted at Rashtrapati Bhavan last night. Singh had sought the meeting to discuss issues of national importance.

 Although Rashtrapati Bhavan sources said the meeting was to brief Kalam on the Prime Ministers forthcoming visits to Brazil and Cuba, there was speculation that Singh could have brought up the bill and the nuclear deal on which he will make a statement in the Rajya Sabha tomorrow.

 Kalam not signing the bill so far is unprecedented, a source said. Once a bill is sent back for his assent, the President has to stamp his approval in a reasonable period of time.

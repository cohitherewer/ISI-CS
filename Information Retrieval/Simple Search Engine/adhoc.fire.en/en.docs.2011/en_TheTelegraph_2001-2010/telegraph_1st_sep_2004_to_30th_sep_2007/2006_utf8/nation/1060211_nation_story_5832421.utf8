 Wanted sadhu shot dead

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, Feb. 10: An aging spiritual leader and seven of his disciples were killed in an attack on his convoy near Allahabad tonight. Twelve disciples were wounded.

 Baba Ganeswar of Barabanki was on his way from Allahabad to Varanasi after attending Magh Mela at Sangam when his convoy of six cars came under attack.

 Witnesses said when the cars reached Handia, about 10 km from Allahabad town, around 9 pm and slowed down near a petrol pump, some miscreants in a Bolero van began firing at the convoy.

 It appeared the spiritual leader was the target. The attackers fired from sophisticated weapons, maybe AK-47. After firing a volley of shots, they sped off, said a witness, Pankaj Singh.

 The injured, mostly women, have been admitted to hospitals in Allahabad. Hospital sources said the death toll may go up. 

 Police said Baba Ganeswar, who hailed from Barabankis Sidhaur Peeth, had criminal cases against him. He was wanted in a number of cases, including an attempt to kill a Sultanpur MLA in 1983, police sources said.

 The attack could be because of an old enmity between the baba and a rival sadhu gang, Allahabad inspector-general of police A.K. Sharma said, adding that security forces have been put on alert.

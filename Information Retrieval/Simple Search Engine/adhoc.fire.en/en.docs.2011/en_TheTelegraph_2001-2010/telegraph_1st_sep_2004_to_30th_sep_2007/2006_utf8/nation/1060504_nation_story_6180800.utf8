 Centre finds fault with state officials

 New 

 Delhi, May 3: A central report on the Vadodara 

 flare-up is learnt to have found fault with the way administrative 

 and police officials have handled the situation.

 Union minister of state for home Sriprakash Jaiswal, who reached Vadodara on Monday, has prepared the report that will be submitted to the home minister.

 The ministry is also examining whether the 300-year-old dargah that was demolished enjoyed a special status under the Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991, that ensures status quo to religious places pre-dating August 15, 1947.

 Quoting information available with the Centre, sources in Delhi said that despite the fear of a communal backlash, top administrative officials of Vadodara carried out the demolition as they feared action against them from the state capital if they dithered.

 Home ministry sources said some officials felt that failure to raze the dargah would be construed as dereliction of duty, leading to their transfer from the prosperous commissionary of Vadodara. The status of Vadodara as a police commissionary could also have prompted the police to make up their mind fast on opening fire on the protesters. 

 In a police commissonary, the use of force can be ordered straightaway by the police in-charge. In other places, such decisions are taken by the administrative head, usually the district magistrate, considered to be more seasoned in dealing with sensitive situations. 

 A senior home ministry official said the Centre would also look into the reason behind extending the demolition drive to May 1 ? the day the dargah was brought down ? from the original deadline of April 30.

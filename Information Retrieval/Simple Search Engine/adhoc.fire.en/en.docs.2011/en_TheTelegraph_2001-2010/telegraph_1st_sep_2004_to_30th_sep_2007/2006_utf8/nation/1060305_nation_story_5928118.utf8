 CPM to put deal to four tests

 OUR BUREAU

 Yechury: Shifting stance

 New Delhi/Bangalore, March 4: The CPM will not object to the nuclear deal if it takes care of its four basic concerns, so that the partys not seen as opposing national interest.

 But worried about the deals potential for making India susceptible to US pressures, the CPM will oppose the Centre if it votes against Iran at Mondays International Atomic Energy Agency conference. The party wants the government to abstain.

 The nuclear deal is not going to rock the government, CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury said. The Left is waiting for the Prime Minister to spell out the agreements details in Parliament.

 We will have to rework our response if the agreement does not address the four concerns, Yechury said. The four issues are:

 Deal shouldnt erode Indias sovereignty

 Decision on separating civilian and military facilities should remain with India

 India should not start implementing the deal before the US Congress amends its laws

 There cant be any India-specific safeguard agreement with the IAEA.

 The latest issue of Peoples Democracy ? the CPM mouthpiece ? warns that the US could use the deal as a lucrative bargain to get India to buy nuclear reactors from it.

 The CPM also described as unfair the Election Commissions move to hold the Bengal polls in five phases. If it (the commission) can accept Tamil Nadus plea for a one-day schedule, why did it not accept the same for Bengal? Yechury asked.

 Protest greets Chandra at UNI

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 3: UNI employees raised slogans and staged a sit-in for several hours to protest a takeover plan by Zees Subhash Chandra when he visited the news agencys office today.

 After spending nearly five hours with United News of India general manager M.K. Laul, Chandra left the premises.

 The bid by the Essel Group, promoted by Chandra, for a majority stake in UNI has met with resistance from the news agencys employees union and some members of its board of directors.

 The employees union fears that the move would change the agencys basic character and there could be large-scale retrenchment.

 Last week, Chandra and three associates were inducted into the UNIs board.

 Later, acting on a petition from a Bhopal newspaper, Delhi High Court ordered that status quo be maintained. The next hearing in the case is on October 5.

 This afternoon, Chandra visited the UNI complex, triggering slogan-shouting by the employees. As he entered the UNI general managers office, several employees squatted outside.

 Chandra was apparently visiting to study the operations of the news agency.

 The restructured UNI board with Chandra on it has assured that the basic character of the company would be maintained. But the employees union has said it would intensify the protest.

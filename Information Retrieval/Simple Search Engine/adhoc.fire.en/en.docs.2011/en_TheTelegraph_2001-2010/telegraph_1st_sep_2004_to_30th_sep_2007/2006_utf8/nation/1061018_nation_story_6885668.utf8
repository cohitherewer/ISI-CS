 Clock restarts, with guilty

 New Delhi, Oct. 17: The clock started ticking again for Chamanlal Mattoo around 2.30 pm today, when a single word brought back his faith in a system he had been a part of for over 40 years.

 When he received a call from Indu Jalani, a close friend of Priyadarshini Mattoo, from Delhi High Court today, he had a simple query. 

 I simply asked whether the high court had decided in favour of justice, he says.

 He was found guilty, came the reply.

 That one word guilty says the 70-year-old retired Jammu and Kashmir chief engineer, restored his faith in the rule of law, and in governance in India. 

 The clock had stopped for me that evening on January 23rd, 1996, when my daughter was so brutally raped and murdered.

 He had just retired then, and having been a government servant for decades, had confidence in the system. 

 The horror was to start soon, though. Police, and then the CBI, he says, deliberately botched up the investigations, making sure that the case against Santosh was hollow despite a mountain of evidence.

 As the case against Santosh Kumar Singh was made weaker, culminating in the December 3, 1999, acquittal, Chamanlal also grew increasingly frail, says his son Hemant.

 Not so his resolve, as he almost single-handedly fought on for justice, appealing before the high court.

 He doesnt credit himself much for todays verdict instead he thanks the media, and a group called United for Justice, which has been campaigning against the acquittal of the accused in the case.

 I dont know what I would have done without the media, he says. He admits the media only took up his daughters case as an afterthought following the acquittals in the Jessica Lal murder case earlier this year, but that doesnt stop him from being grateful.

 But the person who gave me the most strength was Priya herself, he says, his voice breaking with emotion.

 She would finally be happy, and would be smiling down on the world from up there tonight.

 PM calls Koirala 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 28: India today offered support to Nepals new government and promised to help revive its economy, crippled by months of pro-democracy agitation.

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh rang up Prime Minister-designate Girija Prasad Koirla and conveyed the best wishes of the people of India to the people of Nepal, Singhs media adviser said.

 Delhi had recently annoyed Nepals pro-democracy protesters by jumping the gun and welcoming King Gyanendras initial peace overtures, which the strikers found inadequate.

 Singh, who was on a tour of Germany and Uzbekistan when King Gyanendra gave in to the protesters, reviewed the Nepal situation at yesterdays meeting of the cabinet committee on security.

 Delhi is planning an aid package that, officials said, might include concessions and loan waivers to help Nepal rebuild its economy. The pro-democracy agitation has led to a severe shortage of essentials in the country.

 A large number of trucks are stuck at the Indo-Nepal border because of the strike.

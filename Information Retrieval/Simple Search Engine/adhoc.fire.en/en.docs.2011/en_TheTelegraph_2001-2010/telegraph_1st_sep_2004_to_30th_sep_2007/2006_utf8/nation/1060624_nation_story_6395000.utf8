 Push to tea and jute

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, June 23: Bengals two traditional yet ailing industries, tea and jute, have been provided some relief in the budget presented today.

 Finance minister Asim Dasgupta said the tea industry would be exempted from agricultural income tax for three years from April 1, 2006. In any case, tea estates have hardly been paying this tax. He proposed a scheme of settlement of dues up to March 31, 2006.

 Dasgupta withdrew purchase tax on raw jute and set up a special fund of Rs 20 crore for jute mills and diversification of jute products.

 S.K. Bangur, the president of the Indian Chamber of Commerce, said the withdrawal of purchase tax would simplify procedures. It will also sober down raw jute prices, industry observers said.

 Plan outlay for the commerce and industry department has been hiked from Rs 68.53 crore in 2005-06 to Rs 175.81 crore this year to promote industrial resurgence. The budget allocates an additional Rs 12 crore for a venture capital fund for information technology.

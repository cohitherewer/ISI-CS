 Non-violence on trial in fast

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 3: Non-violent protest does not work in the country where it was born, Narmada Bachao Andolan activists are realising.

 Their leader, Medha Patkar, has been fasting on a sidewalk in Delhi for five days, demanding rehabilitation of families displaced by raising the height of the Sardar Sarovar dam, but it is only today that Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has been described to be personally concerned.

 Seeing the lack of response from the authorities, writer-activist Arundhati Roy had raised the question: have non-violent movements ceased to be an effective political weapon in India?

 As Patkars condition deteriorated, Singh held a meeting at his residence tonight with ministers who had visited her earlier in the day. Saifuddin Soz, Meira Kumar and Prithviraj Chavan tried unsuccessfully to persuade Patkar to end her fast.

 Some 30,000 families are affected by what the Narmada movement leaders say is a unilateral decision to raise the dams height in Gujarat.

 We are not a bunch of beggars. We are not here to plead for favours. These are people of India who have been pushed out of their homes by the state. They deserve to be heard, said Himanshu, an activist.

 The activists are getting increasingly frustrated that this voice, as expressed by Patkar and her followers, is not getting a response from the government that is led by the party which claims to have an ear cocked towards underprivileged India.

 It is also the party of Mahatma Gandhi, under whose leadership non-violent protest became a potent political weapon. 

 If the government continues to ignore such protests, the feeling that non-violent struggles no longer have any space in the democratic set-up would gain ground, said V.P. Singh, former Prime Minister and once a Congressman.

 He cited the instance how the government deals with Naxalites because they represent a law and order problem, meaning they shed blood.

 The continued neglect of the poor can have dangerous repercussions, Singh said.

 Consequences are already evident in many places, Orissa being one where tribals are opposing steel projects because they are displaced from their lands. Development is coming into conflict with people.

 Medha has been fasting with two others since March 29 and tomorrow activists across the country will stage similar protests.

 Our homes have been taken away by the state. Are we going to be happy with their (ministers) visits and kind words? After 20 long years, we need some concrete action, said Bhanabhai, who started an indefinite fast today.

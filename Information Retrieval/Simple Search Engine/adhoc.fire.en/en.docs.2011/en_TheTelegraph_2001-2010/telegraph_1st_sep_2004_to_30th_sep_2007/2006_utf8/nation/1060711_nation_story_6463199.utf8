The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Cup without football 

 Some nations had so little ambition they did not even think beyond the first round ? notably Switzerland and Ukraine as their horrendous second-round tie demonstrated.

 Germany 2006 was an enjoyable tournament for those involved but the significance of its legacy will probably rather concern how Germany looks at itself than with the football.

 Great matches? None. Outstanding performances? Argentina against Serbia but that was compromised because Serbia was so poor. Maybe Italy against Germany in the semi-finals but by then the snap had gone out of Germanys legs as the emotional weight of domestic expectation took its toll.

 Disappointments? The Czech Republic, who ran out of strikers which was more bad luck than bad planning. And awful England, an embarrassment whose displays should prompt a realistic reassessment of what is supposed to pass for quality in the Premier League.

 Then again, what sort of World Cup is it when a team ? Italy ? need perform properly only once to reach the final and with no individual player having aggregated more than two goals?

 Fifa, for all Blatters self-congratulatory tone, has problems with discipline and the structure of the tournament.

 Fans pay huge sums to see players not referees but the suggestion of going to three, rather than two, yellow cards for suspension could prove a dangerous downgrading of the disciplinary alert.

 Refereeing common sense would appear to be the answer but, as we have seen before at World Cups, an Argentine referee and an Armenian referee may not judge common sense in the same context.

 As for structure, the 32-strong field means some countries are strictly there for the first-round party and nothing more, which compromises the events competitiveness. It did show up, however, a disturbing lack of progress within Asian football.

 No change is sensibly possible with the structured, seeded draw. But this contributed ?Ghana excepted ? a marginally disappointing predictability about the top two in most groups. On the other hand, the World Cup, as the overarching yardstick of global football power, needs the top nations to progress and prove their worth.

 What does need changing is running straight from the groups into the second round. The end of the first round is a decisive stage, a natural break and the progressing teams deserve the opportunity to catch a little extra breath. The semi-finals should also be staged on the same day so both winners enjoy the same preparation time ahead of the final.

 The climactic stage of the competition demands players be given due respect. They are, after all, the ones sporting history will remember long after all the sponsors, partners, associates, etc have gone bust.

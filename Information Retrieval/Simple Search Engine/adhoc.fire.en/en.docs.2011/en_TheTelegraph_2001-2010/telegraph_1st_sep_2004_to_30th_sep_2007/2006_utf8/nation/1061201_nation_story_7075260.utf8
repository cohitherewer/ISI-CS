 Bread in Sanjays mercy plea 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Sanjay Dutt arrives in court on Thursday. (AP) 

 Mumbai, Nov. 30: Sanjay Dutt said today he was the sole breadwinner in his family and the future of his teenaged daughter depended on him, as he pleaded for mercy in court.

 The 47-year-old actor, convicted under the arms act for possessing an AK-56 rifle and a 9 mm pistol, was recording his statement on the quantum of sentence before Judge Pramod Kode.

 He reminded the anti-terror court of his familys social and philanthropic activities. I love my country. I love the people of my country, Sanjay said, standing in the dock. I would request the honourable court to please show mercy and leniency.

 On bail since 1994, the star has been granted an extension till December 18.

 He told the judge that since the death of his father, the late Sunil Dutt, in May last year, the entire burden of his family has been on his shoulders. I have a young daughter aged 18, studying in New York in a college. I am supporting her. She lives with her grandparents and they are old. She depends on me. Her future depends on me.

 Trishala is Sanjays only daughter from his marriage to actress Richa Sharma, who died of brain tumour a few months after Trishala was born.

 Sanjay also told the court that his father had started a cancer foundation 23 years ago when his mother Nargis died of the disease. He said he had been looking after the foundations activities after his fathers death. The foundation is based in the US, Canada and Europe, and it purchases equipment and sends them to cancer patients in India who cannot afford the treatment. 

 The Lage Raho Munnabhai star who triggered the Gandhigiri wave added that he was also involved in other charity work and had raised funds for the Prime Ministers relief fund for tsunami survivors.

 Sanjay then cited his good conduct during the 11 years he has been on bail. I have never given any cause for complaint when I travelled in India and abroad. I have abided by all rules and regulations. I have no other case pending against me, and I have no prior convictions, he said.

 The court also recorded statements of the actors friends and co-accused. Abu Salems associate Manzoor Ahmed, convicted for transporting two AK-56 rifles from Sanjays house to the residence of another accused, Zaibunissa Kazi, told the judge that he had no connection with the 1993 blasts conspiracy, and had merely accompanied Salem to catch a glimpse of the film star. I am innocent. I accompanied Abu Salem to Sanjays house because I wanted to see him, he said. 

 Ahmed added that he had already served nine years in prison and repented his actions. He said his family 75-year-old mother, wife and a daughter survived on the income from a phone booth.

 Zaibunissa wept as she stood in the witness box. Convicted on terror charges for storing the rifles in her Bandra house, the 64-year-old pleaded for leniency, saying she was a widow and had two unmarried daughters.

 Sanjays friend Yusuf Nullwala urged the court for a lesser sentence on the grounds that he was the only earning member in his family and had never misused his bail conditions. He said he had to look after his old mother and that his brother had severed relations with him after his arrest. 

 Citing his age, the actors 70-year-old Parsi friend, Kersi Adajania, pleaded for a lesser sentence. He said he had to look after his wife who suffers from heart disease.

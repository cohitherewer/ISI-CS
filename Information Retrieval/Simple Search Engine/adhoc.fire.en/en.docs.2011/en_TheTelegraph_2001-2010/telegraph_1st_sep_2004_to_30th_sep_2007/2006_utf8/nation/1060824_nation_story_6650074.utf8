The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Paris

 The information and broadcasting ministry released a notification early this month that requires all songs Indian or international to be certified by the CBFC before they can be telecast on any channel on television.

 Till now, the music channels had their own teams that would vet the content. We used to follow the guidelines set by STAR TV. So a video like Vengaboyss Brazil, which went over the top, would never get airplay and only be played on radio and in the disco, said Amar K. Deb, the chief of Channel V.

 Paris too is headed for the radio waves. We have to now promote the album on FM channels, added the EMI spokesperson. However, we are playing the Stars are blind video on our website because there is no such regulation on the Net yet.

 But will Indian videos which have recently shown everything from G-strings (Kaanta laaga) to bodies only covered by flowers (Kaliyon ka chaman) escape the scissors? I would not like to take names but some of the recent remix videos have not been given U certificates, Channel Vs Deb said. With this CBFC certification becoming a must, its going to be really difficult for these songs to make their way on to the small screen.

 So are the Rakhi Sawants and Mumait Khans finally history? We are all running family channels and a policy like this will surely help clean out the trash, Ashish Patil, vice-president and general manager, creative and content of MTV India, said.

 Not just the raunchy videos, if a film gets an A certificate, we cant run its songs on our channel. Take Omkara for example. The film got an A billing and we could not play the Beedi song till it was specially cleaned for TV.

 Even the re-runs of all those raunchy videos that were made before the new policy are going to be under the scanner. We have already initiated the process to get our (video) library certified by the CBFC, Vh1 Indias Adyanthaya said.

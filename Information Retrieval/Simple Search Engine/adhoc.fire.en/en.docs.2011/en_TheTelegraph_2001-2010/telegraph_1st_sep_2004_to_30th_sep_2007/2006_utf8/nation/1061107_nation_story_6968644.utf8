 New Delhi, Nov. 6: The Supreme Court today reminded the worlds biggest democracy that it should not be held to ransom by dagger-wielding mobs bent on enforcing street justice.

 The blunt advice came in response to the governments customary plea that potential law-and-order problems are standing in the way of implementing an order to seal illegal shops in residential areas of the capital.

 The court told the Centre, the Delhi government and the Municipal Corporation of Delhi to maintain the sanctity of the Constitution of India by rendering full assistance in implementing its order on sealing the commercial establishments. 

 Rejecting applications seeking a stay on the operation in view of law and order problems, a bench headed by Chief Justice Y.K. Sabharwal said a handful of law violators could not put a dagger on the throat of the government and hold the life and liberty of citizens to ransom.

 I am upset not for anything else, Im upset for the institution of this court. My worry is that if this is the stand of anyone in the Supreme Court, what will be the position of the high court and other courts which issue injunctions.... Such things would then have to be decided on the streets, the chief justice said.

 The observation came while the bench rejected four applications by the Centre, Delhi government and the MCD seeking to temporarily suspend the sealing drive keeping the sensitive and volatile situation in the capital in mind. The judge said it was a political move.

 (An) institution is more important than any number of people. They (traders) must be told about the importance of law. There will be no democracy if there is no rule of law, Sabharwal said, while directing the resumption of the sealing drive. 

 When senior counsel for MCD Abhishek Singhvi cited law and order problems, the court shot back that the same argument was used to justify the governments failure to contain the 1984 anti-Sikh riots in Delhi and those in Gujarat and Mumbai. 

 The governments stand in all such situations was that because of the public reaction, we are unable to take action, the chief justice said. Can the government say that we were unable to handle (violence) because of public reaction? 

 The bench said law and order problems had cropped up because of hopes generated by the government. The authorities, instead of moving applications, should have asked the traders to comply with the orders.

 The government had also said policemen deputed during festivals would lead to a shortage of manpower to carry out the sealing. The court countered that the sealing is to be done area-wise and not at one go. It directed the Centre and the Delhi government to provide the force necessary for the operation.

 The court turned down the Centres appeal for temporary relief for 25,000 traders who had filed affidavits promising to close down their shops.

 The court clarified that it had 

 not ordered demolition and only wanted traders to close 

 their shops till there was a law to protect them. An act 

 exempting the traders is under a judicial review. The authorities 

 will resort to sealing only if shutters are not down, the 

 court said.

 SEAL Q amp;A

 How did the sealing drive start?

 Residents Welfare Associations were the original 

 petitioners to the Supreme Court. The Municipal 

 Corporation of Delhi (MCD) then supported the plea.

 What did the court do?

 The court ordered that illegal shops (dealing in non-essential 

 activities) in residential areas be sealed. Such shops number 

 over 2 lakh. (The earlier demolition drive in Delhi was 

 unrelated and covered illegal construction.) 

 Why has the MCD changed its stand now?

 The Congress-dominated MCD was forced to alter its stand 

 after over 2 lakh traders took to the streets and the BJP 

 joined hands with them.

 What did the Centre do?

 The Centre passed a bill for a one-year moratorium on 

 the sealing.

 What happened to the bill?

 Still under judicial review. But the court has criticised 

 the act and has told the government to resume sealing.

 Who are the 25,000 traders that the government 

 wants exemption for?

 The court had earlier assured traders that those who voluntarily 

 confessed to illegal shops and subsequently shut them down 

 would be exempt from sealing. As many as 25,000 traders 

 the government had initially said 42,000 

 filed affidavits, thinking this was the only option before 

 them. Then came the act, which exempted all traders from 

 sealing. The court said that until the validity of the act 

 was decided, traders would be exempt from sealing. But since 

 the 25,000 traders had kept the shops open despite agreeing 

 to shut them, the court said the sealing drive should start 

 with them.

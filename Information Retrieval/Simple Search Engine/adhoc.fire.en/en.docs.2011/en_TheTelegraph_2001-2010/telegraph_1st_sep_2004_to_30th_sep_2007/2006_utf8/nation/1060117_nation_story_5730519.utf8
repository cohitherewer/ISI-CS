The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Petitioner rapped, govt quizzed

New Delhi, Jan. 16 (PTI): Amid reports that Ottavio Quattrocchis accounts in London have been defrozen, the Supreme Court today directed the Centre and the CBI to ensure he is not allowed access to the money.

 The court said steps should be taken to maintain status quo on the accounts so that the freeze ? it came into effect in 2003 on the NDA governments request ? cannot be lifted. If the defreezing of accounts has already taken place, it (money) should not be allowed to be withdrawn, the judges said.

 The bench issued notices to the Centre and the CBI and posted the matter for further hearing on January 23.

 The Telegraph had reported yesterday that the Italian businessman ? accused of being a middleman in the Bofors deal ? might have already withdrawn money from two accounts in the Swiss bank, BSI AG, in London that hold $1 million and Euro 3 million. The accounts were defrozen after Delhi told the Crown Prosecution Service in London it had no evidence to link the money to the Bofors case.

 Before issuing the directive, a bench of Chief Justice Y.K. Sabharwal and Justices C.K. Thakker and R.V. Raveendran pulled up advocate Ajay Agarwal who had filed the petition against the government. Agarwal, who had earlier filed a PIL challenging the Centres clean chit to the Italian businessman, moved a fresh petition this morning quoting newspaper reports.

 The bench reminded him that his petition was based on media reports and asked why he had unnecessarily named law minister H.R. Bhardwaj and additional solicitor general (ASG) B. Dutta.

 It is for the government to come and satisfy the court, the bench said, adding that Agarwal was trying to politicise the issue by making law minister and ASG unnecessary respondents.

 The bench directed ASG Gopal Subaramanian to clarify the governments stand on the Bofors case. We would like to know whether any steps have been taken on the defreezing of Quattrocchis bank account by the Union of India and the CBI.

 The judges also told him that the court was trying to find out whether the Centre and CBI wanted Quattrocchis accounts to be defrozen. If yes, at whose instance was the freeze being lifted?

 The court rapped Agarwal for not serving a copy of the petition and an application to the Centre and other respondents in advance. 

 When Agarwal replied the entire nation knows about the controversy and he was spending money on coming to court, the bench said: We are not concerned with whether you are spending or somebody else.

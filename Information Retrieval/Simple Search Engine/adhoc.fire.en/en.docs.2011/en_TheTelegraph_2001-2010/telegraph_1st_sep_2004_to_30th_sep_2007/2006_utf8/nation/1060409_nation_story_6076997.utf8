 School proof of birth date

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 8: A school register is admissible as evidence to prove a persons date of birth, the Supreme Court has ruled.

 It may be true that an entry in the school register is not conclusive but it has an evidentiary value, a bench of Justices S.B. Sinha and P.P. Naolekar said.

 If an entry is corroborated by oral evidence, it has to be taken into account, the bench added while setting aside the order of a high court.

 The high court, in its ruling, had absolved a rape accused on the ground that the prosecution had failed to conclusively prove that the victim was a minor on the date of the assault. Under the law, sexual intercourse with a minor even with her consent is rape.

 The high court had also ignored statements by the schools authorities and parents who corroborated the entry in the government schools register and set aside the order of a Chhattisgarh trial court, which held the accused guilty of kidnapping and rape.

 According to the prosecution, the girl, who was born in 1970, was enticed by a domestic help to flee with him in 1986.

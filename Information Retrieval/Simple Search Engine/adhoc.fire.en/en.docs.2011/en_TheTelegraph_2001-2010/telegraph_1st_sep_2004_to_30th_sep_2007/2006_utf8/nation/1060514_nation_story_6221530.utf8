 Balanced balm to Palestine

 Israeli Premier Ehud Olmert (top) and Hamas 

leader Khaled Meshaal: Call for one, cash for another 

 New Delhi, May 13: India today announced medical assistance worth Rs 10 crore to aid-starved Palestine in a humanitarian move laden with diplomatic overtones.

 At a time Palestine is groaning under an economic blockade by the West, Delhi expressed concern for the sufferings of its people and reminded them of Indias long-standing support. But, as before, it avoided overt backing of the territorys hardline rulers who deny Israels right to exist.

 After Hamas came to power in January, an uncomfortable Delhi had maintained silence on the formation of the new government, restricting itself to welcoming the fair elections.

 The aid announcement, coming a day after Prime Minister Manmohan Singh spoke to Israeli Premier Ehud Olmert and congratulated him on his swearing-in last week, was therefore very much a balancing act.

 As it sympathised with the Palestinians, Delhi guardedly added that it hoped the government representing the will of the people would continue to pursue peaceful negotiations leading to a viable, united and sovereign state of Palestine living in peaceful co-existence with Israel.

 But Hamas is firm on its stand on Israel. Hamas maintains a red line ? that we do not recognise and will not recognise the Zionist entity, an aide of the partys politburo chief, Khaled Meshaal, said recently.

 The West had cut aid in March to try and get the Hamas government to recognise Israels right to exist, renounce violence and accept past peace accords. Reports say a humanitarian catastrophe is inevitable if the state is not bailed out by the global community.

 Several Indian officials visited Palestine in the past couple of months after the formation of the new government. 

 The assistance will be primarily in the form of medicines and medical supplies as requested by the Palestinian authorities, the foreign ministry said.

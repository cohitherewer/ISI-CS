 Cellphone slap

 Chandigarh, Aug. 28 (PTI): Students of a local college today staged a protest after a teacher allegedly slapped a girl and warned her against using a mobile phone on the premises.

 A group of students from the MCM Dav Girls College created ruckus demanding action against the teacher who had hit Shivani, a first-year student, on Saturday. 

 I was slapped by a teacher and another teacher accompanying her also thrashed me, Shivani said.

 Principal Puneet Bedi said the teachers had only told the girl to stop talking over the phone as it was not allowed on the campus. There is no question of the teachers thrashing the girl, she said.

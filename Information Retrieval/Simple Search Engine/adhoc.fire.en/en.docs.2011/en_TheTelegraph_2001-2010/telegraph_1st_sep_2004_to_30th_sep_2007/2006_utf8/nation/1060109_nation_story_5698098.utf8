 Jan. 8: The harshest winter in living memory numbed the northern belt with several towns in Rajasthan clocking sub-zero temperatures.

 Thirteen more people died due to the cold in the past 24 hours, pushing the toll up to 135 since the onset of winter.

 The cold wave claimed a victim in Bengal, too, with a 45-year-old woman dying in Murshidabad. 

 In Delhi, the minimum temperature at 0.2 degrees was 7 degrees below normal, the Met office spokesperson said. 

 The maximum yesterday at 18.7 degrees was 2 degrees below normal. The fluctuation between the maximum and the minimum is big and quite unexpected. There is the likelihood of snow and rain in Himachal Pradesh for the next three or four days. That means Delhi can get colder.

 The National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting in Thiruvananthapuram has forecast more ground frost and cold conditions over the next week.

 A western disturbance over northern Pakistan made the winter in Kashmir harsh.

 I have got my cousins from the UK living with me and even they complain that Delhi is colder. Really, they are used to central heating and indoor comforts, which our houses are not equipped with. I actually woke up because I had gone cold and was shivering, said Rupamala Ghosh Dastidar, an advertising professional who lives in Safdarjung Enclave, south Delhi.

 Many thought the BBC was off the mark when its weather website forecast that the temperature in Delhi could drop to minus 2 and 3 over the weekend. It is not quite there but the forecasting will be taken more seriously after today. 

 Luckily for fliers, visibility was good. Sunshine bathed the city in the morning and early afternoon and its gardens and lawns were full of people.

 Airport sources said all flights landed and took off in time, a rarity almost during winters in Delhi.

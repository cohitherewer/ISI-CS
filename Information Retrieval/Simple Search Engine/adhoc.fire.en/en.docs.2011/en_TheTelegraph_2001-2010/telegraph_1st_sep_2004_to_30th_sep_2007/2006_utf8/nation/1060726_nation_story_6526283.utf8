 Chinese lady spy held in Dalai yard

 Dharamsala/Shimla, July 25: Himachal police are probing whether a Chinese woman, arrested in Dharamsala last week for not having valid papers, sneaked into the headquarters of the Tibetan government-in-exile to spy on the Dalai Lama.

 Police officials said the 63-year-old Kunchok Chamo, who claimed she was a Tibetan refugee, had been in India once before ? in 2004 ? but was deported to China.

 This time, they added, she entered India in January via Nepal before reaching Dharamsala in Kangra district.

 We have registered a case against her under the foreigners act for not having requisite documents. She was deported to China in 2004 on the same ground. 

 She claims to be a spiritual visitor but were questioning her, said Kangra police superintendent Ajay Yadav. We minutely verify documents of foreign nationals. 

 Sources said Chamo, who has a Chinese passport but not a visa, was keen to meet the Tibetan spiritual leader and the 17th Karmapa, Ogyen Trinley Dorje, the next in line to be the Dalai Lama, but failed to get an audience with either.

 She was staying in Dolma Ling monastery and cannot speak English. Were taking the services of an interpreter, Yadav said, but added that preliminary interrogation has not found her to be a spy.

 Police sources said they stumbled upon Chamo after a routine check, necessary because a sizeable chunk of the nearly 3,000 people who enter India as Tibetan refugees every year are of dubious nature.

 Tibetan officials here said foreigners can sneak into India and then Dharamsala by paying a bribe of just a few thousand rupees. 

 Jamjung and Londul Sangpo, political prisoners who reached Dharamsala recently, paid Rs 24,000 each to Nepalese immigration officials for crossing the Nepal border, said Dorje, the director of the Tibetan Reception Centre.

 One cannot guess the motive of a particular refugee who has reached here. In such a situation, there is every reason to believe that some refugees or tourists could be Chinese spies, Dorje added.

 Officials said there have been several instances when Chinese spies have been caught in Dharamsala. 

 One Chinese army-trained spy even managed to get a job in the Tibetan library. It was after the arrest of these spies that the ministry of external affairs beefed up the Dalai Lamas security, said a source.

 Unconfirmed reports said the official residence of the Dalai Lama in Mcleodganj has become a favourite hunting ground for Chinese spies.

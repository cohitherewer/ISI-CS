 Push for minister call probe

 New Delhi: An all-party meeting has suggested 

 a probe into the alleged link between minister of state 

 for home Manikrao Gavit and mafia don Sundar Bhati. This 

 is exactly what the minister had wanted, reports our special 

 correspondent.

 Zee TV had on Sunday played a tapped telephone conversation, purportedly between the Congress minister and Bhati, who is lodged in a jail in Bulandshahr. Gavit was supposed to be seeking his help to settle a land dispute involving his son-in-law. 

 Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party members have demanded that the media should be reined in from making baseless allegations.

 This inquiry should take place as soon as possible and completed before the end of this session, Gavit said. Till the inquiry is completed, I shall not participate in any official or parliamentary work. 

 Dual citizenship issue notice

 New Delhi: The Supreme Court 

 has issued a notice to the Centre after a Pakistani challenged 

 the Centres decision to exclude Indian migrants to 

 Pakistan and Bangladesh from availing the benefits of the 

 dual citizenship, reports our legal correspondent.

 K.N.A. Farooqi said the decision not to issue the PIO (Persons of Indian Origin) card to people who migrated to Pakistan after choosing to be Indian citizens was discriminatory and violative of Article 14.

 Those who chose to be an Indian citizen on January 26, 1950, could not be treated at par with those who chose to be Pakistani, said Farooqi, who migrated to Chittagong in 1952 and shifted to Karachi in 1971. 

 Tricolour plea

 New Delhi: (PTI): A man has 

 requested a Delhi court to hoist the national flag permanently 

 on its rooftop.

 It is a matter of surprise that there is no national flag on the top of the court building, lawyer Suman Sagar Bhalla said in his petition. 

 Kargil cases

 New Delhi (PTI): The Supreme 

 Court has directed the CBI to file within four weeks a status 

 report on 15 cases of defence deals relating to the Kargil 

 conflict which allegedly had caused a loss of Rs 2,000 crore. 

 The defence ministry has been asked to submit what action 

 has been taken against erring officials. 

 MLAs daughter

 Kannur (PTI): The daughter 

 of local CPM legislator M. Prakashan has committed suicide 

 by setting herself on fire at her home. Vandana, 17, killed 

 herself on Monday noon. The motive behind the suicide is 

 not known.

 A group of teachers from John Scottus School 

 of Dublin, Ireland, have volunteered to teach English language 

 to school-teachers of Uttaranchal in Dehra Dun.

 Uneasy calm in clash village

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Hyderabad, March 28: The fishing hamlet of Gangavaram, where a clash between villagers and police over a port project has claimed one life, was subdued today but tension ruled the air.

 Except for knots of people sitting by the roads and the shrill noise of police vehicles, there was no sign of life in the village, 45 km from Visakhapatnam, where fishermen have for the past six months been resisting attempts to evict them to make way for a port. 

 All shops, even the tea stalls, were closed. Most residents had spent last night with relatives in neighbouring villages. We were scared that police might bomb our houses at night, said Ammaji, who runs a tea stall in the village chowk.

 Yesterday, one person died in police firing on protesters who had attacked officials who came to flatten their homes and take away their fishing boats to facilitate the building of a deep-water port by a private consortium.

 Give us our water. We are not interested in your sops, said Potharaju, a fisherman, who said all he wanted was proximity to the sea so that he could go fishing daily.

 A peaceful bandh was observed in Visakhapatnam as well as towns closer to Gangavaram, with buses off the roads and shops and schools closed. We only allowed students to attend their Standard X exams, CPI activist Satyanarayanamurthy said.

 The Left and the Telugu Desam Party have been leading a campaign against the project, which involves a Dubai-based group that was recently forced to abandon projects in the US following concerns that the deal posed a threat to American national security, demanding more compensation for the fishermen. 

 Desam president N. Chandrababu Naidu visited the village this afternoon. 

 Anticipating trouble during the funeral of the victim, all the roads leading to Gangavaram were sealed today. The police put up barricades and checkposts all along the seven-km approach road to the village from the highway and allowed entry only to Gangavaram residents.

 Over 200 policemen were camping in the village throughout the night to ensure that outsiders do not infiltrate and cause trouble during the funeral procession, said V. Ravinder, deputy commissioner of police, Visakhapatnam.

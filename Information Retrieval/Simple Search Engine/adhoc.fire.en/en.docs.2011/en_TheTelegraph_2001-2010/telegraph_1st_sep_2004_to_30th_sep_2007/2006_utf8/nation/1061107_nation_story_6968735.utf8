 Govt picks holes in quota-cut logic

 MONOBINA GUPTA

 Arjun Singh: Seat poser

 New Delhi, Nov. 6: The government will not reduce the other backward classes quota from 27 per cent in the light of findings that the group makes up 36 per cent of the population and not 52 per cent as earlier believed.

 The new figure has been thrown up by the National Sample Survey. But the human resource development ministry, the driving force behind the OBC quota in institutions of higher education, has a counter-argument.

 Ministry officials say scheduled castes and scheduled tribes were 15 and 7.5 per cent of the population at the time of Independence, but their number has risen since then. The NSS puts their combined share in the population at 28.3 per cent, and the National Family Health Survey at 27.9 per cent.

 So, if the OBC quota is to be reduced, by the same logic the SC/ST quota should be increased. SCs are now entitled to 15 per cent and STs to 7.5 per cent of seats.

 The NSS figures have triggered a debate on the quantum of reservation at a time when the OBC quota bill lies before a parliamentary standing committee.

 The HRD ministry and pro-quota lobbies want the bill passed in Parliaments winter session, which begins on November 22.

 The ministry is already grappling with a series of hitches on the bill, the latest being a Supreme Court judgment that says the creamy layer (the well-off) among the SCs and STs must be excluded from reservation. Many political parties have protested the judgment and the subject is likely to come up in the winter session.

 The Centre is also under pressure from the Left and several other groups to exclude the creamy layer among the OBCs from the 27 per cent quota. The CPM, which opposes the exclusion of the creamy layer among the SC/STs, also wants affirmative action for Muslims, including reservation.

 Even some of the OBC quota advocates have questioned the figure of 52 per cent, used by the Mandal Commission, which brought into effect the original 27 per cent OBC quota in jobs. Most politicians now cite this figure while seeking OBC quotas in other sectors like education.

 Yogendra Yadav of the Centre for Study of Developing Societies, who supports the OBC quota, says the figure of 52 per cent is a mythical construct, arrived at after leaving out the percentages of other communities like SC/STs and Muslims.

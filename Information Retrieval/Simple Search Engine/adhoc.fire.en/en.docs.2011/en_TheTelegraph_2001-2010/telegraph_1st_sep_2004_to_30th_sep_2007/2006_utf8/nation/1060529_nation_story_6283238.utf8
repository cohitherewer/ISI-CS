 Warriors warm up for battle to be President

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 V.P. Singh, Arjun Singh: Will luck shine 

on them? 

 New Delhi, May 28: Jockeying has begun for the Presidents office falling vacant next year.

 Some of the presidential hopefuls have themselves prepared a little list of probables, going by the general assumption that the time has come for a Kshatriya to take the chair.

 In the picture gallery of 10 former Presidents, there are four Brahmins, two Muslims, two OBCs, one Kayastha and a Dalit but not a single face from the warrior tribe. 

 Any shortlist, therefore, created on that expectation would contain the must-have names of V.P. Singh, Arjun Singh, Karan Singh and Bhairon Singh Shekhawat.

 Its not polite to say I want to be President, but the political chessboard moves of some of the principal characters are a dead give-away. 

 Leading the pack is Mandal messiah VP, who has revived the Jan Morcha, his old party, and is dropping nice words about Sonia Gandhi here and there. Her word, everyone knows, will carry some weight in choosing the next inhabitant of Rashtrapati Bhawan. 

 VPs aides are circulating stories of how their leader is trying to mend fences with the widow of Rajiv Gandhi ? the man he was close to but fell out with in the wake of the Bofors controversy.

 Bofors cost Rajiv his job as Prime Minister. More important, as a consequence of VPs Mandal politics, the Congress lost its traditional bastion Uttar Pradesh. 

 Ask not if an ex-actor and Samajwadi Party malcontent and the retired father of Mandal politics ? though that brand is in circulation again with the OBC quota in education ? make a winning combination, but VPs plan is to team up with Raj Babbar to help the Congress out in Uttar Pradesh.

 His camp followers believe they have Left support.

 Arjun Singh, the human resource development minister who has ? by default or otherwise ? fathered Mandal II with the 27 per cent OBC quota in higher educational institutions, hopes to hitch a ride in the backward class chariot to the top of Raisina Hill.

 Arjun has been with Sonia through thick and thin. Hes ailing, as is VP. And his supporters have this theory that the air of Rashtrapati Bhavan will be good for his health, going by the general theory that where ginseng doesnt work, power will.

 Karan Singh, the son of the last royal ruler of Kashmir, is the third candidate, enjoying support from not just the Congress, but also from other parties. 

 Unlike VP and Arjun, both controversial figures, Karan can emerge as a consensus choice, his backers feel. He heads the AICCs foreign affairs department and is frequently at the centre of rumours about an empty external affairs ministrys office.

 Recently, he was sent to Nepal to negotiate with the king as a special envoy of the Prime Minister, showing he has the support of the Congress establishment. Opinion on his performance in Nepal has, however, been conflicting.

 Karan, Arjun and VP make a trio that is on one side of the political divide, the side that is ruling.

 Bhairon Singh Shekhawat, the vice-president, belongs to the BJP but his supporters believe if Karan can lay claim to a potential consensus, so can he. His current status does give some strength to his case, but is certainly no guarantee, as many former vice-presidents who couldnt shed the prefix vice would vouch.

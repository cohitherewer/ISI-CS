 Attack on engineers 

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Guwahati, Dec. 7: Two Bengali engineers employed by construction company Gammon India and their colleague from Dibrugarh were critically wounded today in firing by militants in the troubled North Cachar Hills of Assam.

 Militants suspected to be from the anti-talks Jewel Gorlosa faction of the Dima Halam Daogah (DHD) attacked assistant engineer Ajay Banerjee, junior engineer Debdoot Sen and supervisor Manoj Bhuyan at Manigiripur, where their company is laying a stretch of road as part of the east-west corridor.

 Banerjee is from Bankura in Bengal and Sen hails from Dhubri in Assam. 

 Both the engineers took bullets in their stomachs, while Bhuyan suffered injuries on his hands and chest. A source at Maibong Civil Hospital, where they were first admitted, described Sens condition as very critical.

 The trio was shifted to Lumding Railway Hospital a couple of hours later. They may be brought to Guwahati, 383 km from the district headquarters, tomorrow.

 Additional superintendent of police N.C. Ghosh said from Haflong town that three assailants in fatigues barged into the Gammon India camp for executives at Manigiripur, less than a km from an Assam Rifles base, and opened fire on the employees. 

 Gammon India, which is building the Lumding-Maibong stretch of the East West Corridor, had received a note from the DHD (Jewel) group seeking 10 per cent of the project cost as tax. The companys refusal to pay is believed to be the reason behind the attack.

 Superintendent of police Bhakta Bahadur Chetry said last week that government employees have been receiving threats from the same militant outfit over telephone to pay up. They (the rebels) have apparently modified their modus operandi by demanding money over the phone instead of issuing extortion notices. The demands range between Rs 1 lakh and Rs 3 lakh. 

 The main DHD faction, headed by Dilip Nunisa, has a ceasefire agreement with Delhi and is awaiting an invitation to a dialogue with the government on its demand for an autonomous state for the Dimasa community.

 Bangalore, Oct. 27: After broken glass, its time for a compromise. 

 Bangalore police, who were to hold an impartial probe into the incident where the chief ministers son was involved in a drunken brawl with hotel workers for refusing to serve them food past closing hours, did a quick U-turn. They are now involved in a compromise and are trying to mollify both parties.

 According to their formula, both Nikhil and the Empire Hotel management would withdraw their respective complaints with the police and not press charges.

 As a first step, sources told The Telegraph, interested parties had already erased the CCTV image, the only evidence showing Nikhil and his friends Syed and Manjunath arguing and later indulging in fisticuffs with the hotel staff around 4 am yesterday.

 A hotel employee, on condition of anonymity, said the image did not show anyone throwing a stone or a bottle. As the lights were already off at the entrance (signifying a closed restaurant), the image captured was vague of people walking towards or away from the main entrance. There is no indication of any fight. There is only one shot where something hits the glass and a hole appears. We have not been able to identify any person who caused the damage.

 Chief minister H.D. Kumaraswamy set the tone this noon when he said he was not at all embarrassed by Thursdays episode. Without naming Nikhil, he said such things happen in Bangalore because of the high lifestyle and friends circle one cultivates. The law will take its own course, the chief minister added.

 Nikhils grandfather, former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda, told reporters that he did not believe in politicising such personal issues. Without elaborating on his grandsons lifestyle, he said there were hundreds of cases where politicians relatives get into trouble, but felt the law should take its own course.

 Gowda accused some Congress leaders of lending political colour to the episode. They were in such a hurry that they released another grandsons photo to the media. Prajwal (whose photo was published in some newspapers) was very upset and I had to console him, he said.

 Nikhil was driving a Hummer, which was bought from a Dubai source when the family was vacationing there.

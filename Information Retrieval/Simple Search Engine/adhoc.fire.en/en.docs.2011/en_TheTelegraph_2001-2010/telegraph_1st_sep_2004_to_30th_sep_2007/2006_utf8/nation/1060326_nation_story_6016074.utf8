The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Now, BJP member under glare

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 25: The Election Commission today received a complaint seeking the disqualification of BJP Rajya Sabha MP Balbir Punj for allegedly holding an office of profit. 

 Poll panel sources confirmed they had received the reference from President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam in this regard. 

 According to the petition, the BJPs Upper House member was the chairman of the National Commission for Youth from March 2002 to July 2004. 

 A source said the petition has alleged that the post was equivalent to the office of a minister of state and Punj had enjoyed the perks and privileges attached to it.

 Today, the commission also received a reference from Jharkhand governor Syed Sibtey Razi against nine MLAs for allegedly holding offices of profit.

 They are Neelkanth Munda, Ashok Kumar, Loknath Mahto, Upendra Nath Das, Radhakrishna Kishore, Putkar Hembram, Joba Manjhi, Tala Marandi and Chandreshwar Oraon.

 Yesterday, the commission had received petitions against four Jharkhand MLAs ? Khiru Mahato, Karia Munda, Chatru Ram Mahato and Sarayu Roy ? seeking their disqualification for holding offices of profit.

 Poll panel hint

 The Election Commission has hinted that it would not decide whether the post of chairperson of the National Advisory Council, which Sonia Gandhi held, is an office of profit.

 Chief election commissioner B.B. Tandon said as a general principle, courts look into live issues between parties and do not undertake to decide an issue that is purely academic or has become infructuous on account of any supervening event like the resignation of a member from the House concerned.

 Tandon said whenever any question of disqualification of an MP is raised by the President, the commissions opinion is to be sought by him.

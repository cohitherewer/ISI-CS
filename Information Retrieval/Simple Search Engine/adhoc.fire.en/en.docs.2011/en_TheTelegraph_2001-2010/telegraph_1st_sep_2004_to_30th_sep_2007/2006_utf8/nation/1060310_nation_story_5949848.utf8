 Ministers don links on tape

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, March 9: A mobile phone conversation between Chhota Rajan and his associate D.K. Rao taped by Mumbai police allegedly exposes minister of state for home Siddharam Mhetres links with the don.

 The tape transcript is believed to be part of the chargesheet filed by the crime branch against Rao before the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act court last month. 

 Rao, who is serving a 10-year sentence on a murder charge, spoke to Rajan on a cellphone from the high-security Arthur Road jail.

 In the conversation recorded on September 26, 2005, Rao allegedly tells the don he had paid Mhetre Rs 5 lakh to appoint police officers friendly with Rajans gang at the Nashik and Arthur Road jails. Rao says this would allow him and other gang members to operate freely.

 Mhetre, however, said he had no connection whatsoever with the appointments.

 The conversation also reportedly mentions Daya, raising the question whether the reference is to Daya Nayak, the encounter specialist arrested recently on graft charges.

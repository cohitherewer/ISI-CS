 US drums up nuke support

 K.P. NAYAR

 Washington, March 7: Americas top nuclear negotiator with India asserted here yesterday that Delhi will have the freedom in future to build nuclear reactors that are exclusively for military purposes.

 Making two public appearances here, within 24 hours of his return from South Asia, Nicholas Burns, the under-secretary of state for political affairs, said it was Indias sovereign right to do so, but added that the US will not in any way assist in such construction.

 If India builds reactors that will service its military programme, India will have to do it on its own and will not get any help from the international community, he said.

 Burns pointed out that Indias military programme was a reality, but assured critics of the Indo-US nuclear deal that Washington will not support that programme or recognise India as a nuclear weapons state.

 At the same time, he said the aim of the civilian nuclear agreement finalised between US President George W. Bush and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh last week was not to roll back or to cap Indias nuclear weapons programme.

 The public appearances by Burns yesterday was part of a series that he plans to undertake in the next few days to drum up support among the American public and on Capitol Hill for legislation to amend the US Atomic Energy Act.

 If the nuclear deal is to go into operation, the legislation must be amended to enable American companies to sell civilian nuclear equipment to India, which is not a signatory to the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty.

 Burns will be joined in this effort by other officials of the Bush administration. Foreign secretary Shyam Saran is also expected here in the next few days to review progress on the deal and to work out steps to be taken jointly by both sides to take the agreement forward.

 Burns said Bush administration officials will meet key senators and members of the House of Representatives this week to find out how they want to proceed with the proposed legislation.

 Scotland Yard offers help

 London, July 12: India must install closed-circuit television cameras at all railway stations and other vulnerable targets, Tarique Ghaffur, one of Britains most senior anti-terrorist officers told The Telegraph today in the wake of the Mumbai explosions.

 Ghaffur, who is an assistant commissioner at the Metropolitan police, said he was getting in touch with the Indian high commissioner in London and offering to fly down Scotland Yards top forensic specialists to help their counterparts in Mumbai conduct a crime scene reconstruction.

 In a matter-of-fact tone, he made it clear that Scotland Yards ability to build a detailed picture of precisely what happens at the scene of a crime, especially a terrorist outrage, is the best in the world. 

 Scotland Yards technical ability is cutting edge but if the Met are to help their colleagues in Mumbai, the job needs to be done quickly before the clues disappear.

 Scotland Yard, which had to deal with the London bombs on July 7 last year in which three Underground trains and a bus were attacked, has had to learn the hard way.

 On DNA reconstruction, scene of crime reconstruction, the Americans do it, but no one does it like us, said Ghaffur, who added that for crime prevention and detection CCTV was now a must.

 So far as extending the help of Scotland Yard, he emphasised: Id be delighted.

 Although there are obvious similarities between the London and Mumbai bombings, there are also major differences. 

 Since home-grown British Muslims were responsible for the former, both the government and the police went out of their way to prevent a possible backlash of which there was a risk, especially when there was an attempt to repeat the outrages on July 27.

 Ghaffur, who also happens to be Britains most senior Asian policeman, developed a strategy of increasing links with the ethnic minorities, while at the same time issuing a warning that the police would take a tough line with anyone caught engaging against revenge attacks, particularly against Muslims, mosques and other Islamic targets.

 However, the police know that the fight against Islamic terrorism in Britain is unlikely to succeed without good intelligence from within the UK Muslim community. That is why one of Ghaffurs priorities is to retain the confidence of British Muslims.

 Without good intelligence from the community, you aint going to do it, he said.

 Since the Mumbai bombings have happened ? yet again ? that will be interpreted as a failure of intelligence on the part of the police. But the assumption will be made that the bombers have come from outside or are sleepers who have been infiltrated into local communities to wait for instructions from their controllers outside. Simultaneous bombings are normally seen as the fingerprint of al Qaida or its associated groups.

 In Britain, where the first anniversary of July 7, 2005, was marked with dignified ceremonies throughout the country, Sir Ian Blair, the Metropolitan police commissioner, made a chilling prediction.

 He said the public was not fully aware of other terrorist outrages that had been forestalled by good police intelligence but it was inevitable they would happen again.

 He said: We have already interdicted three further conspiracies since July 21. And that means were succeeding, but the fact is the threat is very real. There are, as I speak now, people in the United Kingdom, planning atrocities in the United Kingdom.

 There is no reason to think that it will be any different in Mumbai, where intelligence gathering is a less refined skill and where police effort is expended on crime solving after the event.

 Apart from the death and destruction caused by bombs ? 52 people were killed in London and 700 injured ? the British economy also took a big hit. Tourism, especially from America, was down and West End theatres and restaurants suffered (the musical, The Far Pavilions, closed as a result).

 It is now likely that the British, who advised foreigners not to be put off by the London bombs, will urge their own nationals to be wary of going to Mumbai in the next few weeks.

 After the London bombs, there was heavy police presence at many stations but although commuters were nervous for a few weeks, they really had no alternative but to return to using the Underground and buses.

 Tony Blair realised the parallel with India when he issued a strong denunciation last night of the outrages in Mumbai: I condemn utterly these brutal and shameful attacks. There can never be any justification for terrorism. Our thoughts are with the victims and their families.

 He added: We stand united with India as the worlds largest democracy, through our shared values and our shared determination to defeat terrorism in all its forms.

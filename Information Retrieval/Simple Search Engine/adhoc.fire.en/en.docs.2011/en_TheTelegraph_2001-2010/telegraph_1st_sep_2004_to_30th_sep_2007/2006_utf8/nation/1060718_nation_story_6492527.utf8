 Yadavs son Vikas and nephew Vishal are facing trial for the murder of Bhartis friend Nitish, the son of a senior IAS officer, in February 2002.

 Under secretary in the union home ministry ramesh kumar also appeared before the court and submitted his report regarding the nbws issued against bharti.

 The report had a fax message from the indian high commission in london saying there are no laws in the united kingdom (uk) to compel bharti to attend the court.

 The fax message further said though the high commission had arranged for the papers to be served on bharti, summons from overseas have no legal authority in uk. Whether she complies with them or not is her prerogative. The court also posted the prosecutions plea for proclamation for appearance of bharti to july 19 and directed the public prosecutor to show the law under which proclamation can be issued against a witness. The prosecution has moved the application consequent to failure of bharti yadav, sister of the main accused vikas

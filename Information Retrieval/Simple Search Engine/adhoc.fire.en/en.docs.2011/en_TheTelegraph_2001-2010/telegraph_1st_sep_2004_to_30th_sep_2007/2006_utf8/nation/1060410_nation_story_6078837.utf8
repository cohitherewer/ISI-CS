 Biker John in cycle crash

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, April 9: Actor John Abrahams Yamaha crashed into a cyclist on Carter Road in the small hours of Sunday when he was returning from the Gladrags Mega Model and Manhunt Contest 2006.

 The actor, who has often said he tries to go speeding on his bike (HR 29 N 5009) at least twice a week after midnight, lost control when he swerved to dodge a cyclist who came in his way. He then rammed into a second cyclist who had a person riding pillion, injuring both of them. They were admitted to Bandras Baba Hospital by Johns friends.

 The actor suffered knee and ankle injuries and has been admitted to Mumbais high-profile Lilavati Hospital. Actress-girlfriend Bipasha Basu is by his side, hospital sources said.

 A case of negligent and rash driving (under IPC 279 and IPC 337) has been registered against the actor. He could be arrested for rash and negligent driving if the injured press charges.

 John Abraham was supposed to be released from hospital this afternoon. But it seems he is taking his time as he may face arrest on release, a doctor said.

 There have been no grave injuries. The left ankle and knee are hurt. We have done x-rays and an MRI. There is no fracture. We are monitoring him. His condition is stable.

 Although some reports said a pedestrian came in Johns way, police confirmed his bike had skidded while trying to avoid a cycle and crashed into another one. The incident happened in suburban Khar, close to Johns Bandra West home.

 Two people were injured when at the turn of a road, a cyclist cut his way off. As a result, Abraham lost control and rammed into the cycle which had two passengers, said ASI Kadam of Khar police station who went to the spot.

 This is Johns second minor bike accident since he joined Bollywood. Earlier, while shooting for Karan Johars Kaal in Jim Corbett National Park, he had been injured.

 This is also the second time he is being hospitalised in the last three months. In December, he had a bronchitis attack while shooting in Afghanistan and had to rush back home.

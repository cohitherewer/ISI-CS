 The great kidnap divide

 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY

 Lucknow, Dec. 12: R.K. Viswakarma is no CEO of a money-spinning multinational, nor does he have connections in high places. Kidnap his son and ask for a ransom of Rs 5 lakh and he wouldnt be able to pay up.

 He couldnt, so the body of his 13-year son Ankit neck strangled with a computer chord, head and hands chopped off was today found along the Dewa-Lucknow road near Muradabad village, about 52 km from here.

 Ankit was abducted last Friday while playing cricket at a ground close to his home. Two motorcycle-borne youths whisked him off around 6.30 pm after an older student of Ankits school, Kendriya Vidyalaya, tricked him into meeting them.

 The ransom calls started around 9.30 the same night, Viswakarma said. Another came a while later, and five more the day after. Then they stopped, because the kidnappers got whiff that a caller-line identification device had been installed and police tipped off.

 Today, the hapless Viswakarma heard about the body. His sons kidnap was uncannily like that of three-year Anant Gupta, son of Adobe India CEO Naresh Gupta, in Noida on the eve of Childrens Day. The difference was he hadnt had the means to buy back his son.

 A laboratory assistant at the Sanjay Gandhi Post-Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, the tears wouldnt stop streaming as Viswakarma again and again wiped the smiling picture hanging in the drawing room of his Eldeco Udyan Colony home.

 Over and over again, he chided himself for not reminding Ankit to return home before dark. How would I know that was the last time he would go to the field with his cricket bat? he sobbed.

 Ankits kidnappers have been arrested and were paraded at a news conference by the police today. Vishal Mishra, Satyendra Gupta and Gaurav Singh are believed to have confessed killing Ankit in a car last Friday.

 Lucknow SP (rural) Rajiv Malhotra said what was unnerving was that all three had links with Lucknow University.

 One of the youths is a student of computer science at Lucknow University and stays in the hostel. The other two are graduates from the same university. One runs a fitness centre and wanted money for his wedding, he said.

 The police claimed the boy had been murdered even before they were informed. Why the kidnappers who took questions from the media asked for ransom after killing the boy is not clear. Had we not killed him, he would have identified us and there was no chance of getting the money, a confused Gaurav said.

 The SP said Chhotu, the boy who led Ankit to the kidnappers, was on the run.

 Although Ankits family has a house in Lucknow, they are not too well off. His father is a lab assistant and his mother a nurse. His uncle works in a private firm. The three apparently pooled in their savings to build the house, which could have misled the kidnappers into thinking they could cough up ransom.

 Police sources said there had been 749 abductions in Uttar Pradesh this year, of which 300 victims could not be traced. The western district of Etah recorded 400 abductions, the highest this year. Kanpur logged 240 cases, Allahabad 12 and Barabanki 20.

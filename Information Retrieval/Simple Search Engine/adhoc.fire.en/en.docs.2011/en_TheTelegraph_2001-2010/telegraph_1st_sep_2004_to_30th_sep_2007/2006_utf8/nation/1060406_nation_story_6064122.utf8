 SC blow to tenants

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, April 5: Accepting rent after serving eviction notice does not mean that a landlord has decided against terminating the lease, the Supreme Court held today. 

 A division bench headed by Justice B.P. Singh said mere acceptance of rent was not enough to prove that the landlord had waived the notice. 

 Besides submitting the proof of the landlord accepting the rent, the tenant has to show some act that expresses or implies the landlords intention to treat the lease as subsisting, the court said. 

 The ruling came during dismissal of an appeal against a Delhi High Court order, which said acceptance of rent did not mean waiver of notice. 

 Jadish Singh, a landlord, had issued two notices to his tenant Kesar Singh in February and March 1979 before filing an eviction suit in June the same year. Jadish, however, kept on accepting the rent even after serving the notices. 

 The tenant contended in the court that acceptance of rent meant an intention to continue with the lease. 

 However, the apex court said the fact that even after accepting the rent, the landlord did file a suit for eviction made his intention clear. 

 It could not be ignored that in any event, even if the rent was neither tendered nor accepted, the landlord, in the event of success would be entitled to the payment of the arrears of the rent, the court said.

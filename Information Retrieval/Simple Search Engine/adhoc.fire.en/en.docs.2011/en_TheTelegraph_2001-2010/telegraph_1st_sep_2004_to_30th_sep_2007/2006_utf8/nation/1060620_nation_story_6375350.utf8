 Plan to call back retired lecturers

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Calcutta, June 19: In the grip of a shortage of college teachers, the Bengal government has decided to draft retired lecturers.

 About 20 per cent of the posts are now vacant, primarily because the state had failed to fill those reserved for SC/ST and physically challenged candidates, higher education minister Sudarshan Roy Choudury told the Assembly today. 

 Of the 2,166 vacant posts, nearly 1,585 are under the reserved categories. The vacancies under the reserved categories are accumulating every year because of non-availability of suitable candidates. 

 So, the move to re-employ college teachers after their retirement at 60. 

 The decision comes in the wake of a University Grants Commission (UGC) and Union human resource development ministry directive to state governments asking them to draw up independent schemes to tackle the teacher shortage.

 Roy Choudhury announced the governments plan while replying to a question tabled by Trinamul Congresss Ashoke Deb, who wanted to know what steps were being taken by the government to fill the vacant posts in the 340 state-aided colleges across Bengal.

 Some 88 posts of principals are also lying vacant.

 Roy Choudhury said: The human resource development ministry has recently written to us (the state government) giving two short-term options to deal with the crisis. One, to draw up an independent scheme to utilise the services of retired teachers and, two, to offer re-employment to retired teachers till the age of 65.

 The government is working on both the proposals, the minister said. We are trying to finalise our opinion after discussing the issue with teachers bodies and senior officials of the department.

 The state government, Roy Choudhury said, was bound to follow the reservation policy for college teacher recruitment in conformity with the Centres model. 

 Our hands are tied. The reservation policy is such that we cannot help keeping the posts vacant if we do not get suitable candidates.

 Explaining how the vacancies under the reserved categories were increasing annually, the minister said, for the 1,585 vacancies in reserved posts, the government this year has been able to prepare a panel of only 340 deserving candidates.

 Nearly 3.3 lakh teaching posts are lying vacant in colleges all over the country. A letter suggesting the same options has been sent to all state governments, the Bengal higher education minister said.

 The dearth of teachers has become even more noticeable because, Roy Choudhury added, many colleges have opened new honours courses, which demand good teachers.

 NET-SLET must

 Bengal has urged the Centre to reconsider its proposal to allow candidates with PhD or MPhil degrees to become university or college teachers without qualifying through the national or state-level eligibility tests ? NET and SLET.

 Roy Choudhury said these candidates could be given pre-ference during recruitment but they should qualify through NET or SLET. We are waiting for its (the Centres) reply. 

 The minister also questioned the real value of PhD and MPhil degrees offered by many Indian universities.

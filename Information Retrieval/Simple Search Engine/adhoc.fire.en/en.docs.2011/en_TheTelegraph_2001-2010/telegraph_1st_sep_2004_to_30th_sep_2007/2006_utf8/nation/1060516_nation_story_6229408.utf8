 Recurring arms nightmare in west

 SATISH NANDGAONKAR

 Mumbai, May 15: An arms haul a day in Maharashtras hinterland is making Mumbai recall the nightmare of the Bombay blasts.

 On Sunday night, the anti-terrorist squad of state police seized a consignment of arms and explosives from an electrical shop in Malegaon, a communally sensitive town 60 km from Nashik.

 This was the third seizure within a week from the Marathawada region in central Maharashtra and was part of the cache linked to three militants on May 9 near Ellora caves in Aurangabad. 

 So far, the police have seized 43 kg of high-grade RDX, 16 AK-47 rifles, 3,200 rounds of ammunition, 60 magazines, and 50 Chinese-made hand grenades. (See chart)

 According to intelligence reports, we have recovered what we were looking for. Investigations are at a crucial stage, and hence we would not be able to share all details, but we suspect a foreign hand, state director-general of police P.S. Pasricha said, hinting at the involvement of Pakistan.

 Thirteen years ago, Pakistans Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) was suspected to have used the underworlds coastal smuggling network to ferry arms and explosives for the Bombay blasts.

 This time, security agencies feel, the ISI is using the well-entrenched network of an outlawed students organisation to bring in lethal consignments. 

 The police have so far arrested nine suspects, including a homeopath, with links to the students outfit and are hunting for a suspected Lashkar-e-Toiba operative, Zaimuddin Ansari, the alleged brain behind the arms operation. 

 A graduate who worked an electrician, Ansari is believed to have received training for subversive activities.

 The police did not rule out the possibility that the consignment could have been meant for Gujarat, which recently witnessed riots in Vadodara, or Hyderabad.

 Half of the 16 AK-47 rifles bore signs of extensive use and were repainted in black. The police suspect that they were used in Afghanistan.

 The suspects had used innovative methods like hiding RDX inside the central processing units of computers. The hand-grenades were hidden inside a wooden crate used for storing mangoes, Pasricha said.

 He refused to confirm or deny reports that a state legislator could be involved. An accused could be saying he stayed at the MLA hostel for two days to throw the probe off track. We have to verify the statements before commenting on it, Pasricha said.

 Abdul Azim, the driver of the Sumo, had said the group had stayed for a brief period at the MLA hostel in South Mumbai. An MLA has to give consent in writing for a visitor to be accommodated there.

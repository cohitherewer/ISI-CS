 US bomb hoax to trap sister

 New York (AP): Two brothers called in an airport bomb threat in a failed attempt to keep their sister from leaving town to get out of an arranged marriage in India, authorities said.

 Amandeep Singh, 24, and Gurpreet Singh, 26, were held on Thursday on charges that they phoned Macarthur airport in Islip, east of New York, on January 17 and gave a bogus tip that terrorists were planning to bomb a plane.

 Suffolk county police said they were trying to stop their sister from flying to Atlanta to be with her boyfriend, ruining plans the family had made for her to marry a doctor in India.

 Security at the airport was beefed up, but authorities never considered the terror tip genuine and no flights were disrupted, said police spokesman Tim Motz.

 Investigators later traced the call to the brothers. The men are charged with a misdemeanor: filing a false police report. They could face up to a year in prison, or an even longer sentence if the federal government files additional charges.

 Their 30-year-old sister cancelled her trip after learning what her brothers had done, but has since married the boyfriend, the owner of a gas station in Long Island City, the police said.

 Amandeep told the New York Post: Its all a misunderstanding.

 Naushad 

 Dubai (PTI): A 34-year-old Indian, who escaped an eye-for-eye punishment in Saudi Arabia after the victim of his attack pardoned him, is expected to be out of prison early next week.

 Paperwork relating to the release of Puthen Veetil Abdul Latheef Naushad, a Keralite, is in the final stages, sources said.

 Jawan suicide

 Jammu (PTI): An army jawan, Sunil Chowdhary, allegedly shot himself dead with his service weapon in the Karaka area of Jammu division on Wednesday. Police have registered a case of suicide.

 Petrol pump loot

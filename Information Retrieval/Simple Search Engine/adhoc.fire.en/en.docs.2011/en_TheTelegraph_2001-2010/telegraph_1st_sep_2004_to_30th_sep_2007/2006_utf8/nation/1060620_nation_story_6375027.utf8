 Kalam plotter seeks bail

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 19: A man facing trial for allegedly conspiring to kill President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam and cricketers Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly in 2002 has approached the Supreme Court for bail on the ground that the government had failed to conclude the trial even four years after his arrest.

 Gulam Mohammad Dar has alleged that his trial was delayed as the government was not punctual in constituting designated courts to hear cases under the anti-terror law.

 Taking note of his allegations, a vacation bench of Justices A.R. Lakshmanan and Altamas Kabir today issued a notice to the Delhi government, which has to file its response on the matter. 

 Dar, who moved a special leave petition against Delhi High Courts rejection of his bail plea, pointed out that at least four judges had heard his case. He also said the government had taken time to provide replacements when there was a vacancy due to elevation or superannuation of a judge. 

 He also alleged that one of the judges on the high court bench had heard the case even before being elevated to the high court. This was against the law on the subject, Dar contended. The Srinagar resident has been in Tihar jail since August 7, 2002.

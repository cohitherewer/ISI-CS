 Maoists killed

 Raipur, June 8: Security forces in Chhattisgarh gunned down 13 Maoists in separate encounters in two extreme corners of the state today, reports our correspondent. 

 Acting on a tip-off that Maoist leaders were camping in Devarpalli village in Dantewada district, the security forces mounted a raid this morning. The village is around 350 km from Raipur, the state capital. 

 More than 50 Maoists were present in the village for an emergency meeting when the area was cordoned off. Asked to surrender, the extremists opened fire, triggering a gun battle that lasted for more than three hours. 

 Ten rebels were killed. Five Maoists were captured but most leaders escaped.

 In the other encounter in Sarguja district, 450 km from Raipur, this afternoon, three Maoists were gunned down. 

 The militants had laid an ambush and attacked a patrolling party, sparking the encounter that went on for two hours. 

 One of the Maoists killed in Sarguja has been identified as Manas, a zonal commander from Jharkhand. Arms and ammunition have been seized from the rebels.

 Sources said the Devarpalli meeting could have been convened to organise an attack on a relief camp nearby. The camp houses more than 500 villagers who had left their houses. 

 Police claimed that they foiled an attempt to abduct 40 villagers, who would probably have been taken away as hostages after the planned attack.

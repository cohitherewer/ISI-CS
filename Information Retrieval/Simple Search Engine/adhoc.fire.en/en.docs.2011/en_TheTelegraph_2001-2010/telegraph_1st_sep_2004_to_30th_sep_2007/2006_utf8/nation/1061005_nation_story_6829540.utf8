 Mumbai, Oct. 4: The goddess has been the favourite flavour across India over the past few days but only at puja pandals and on websites, not in movie halls and multiplexes.

 A remake of the 1975 blockbuster Jai Santoshi Ma and the animated Krishna released during the festive season have opened to shockingly low collections of 5-10 per cent at almost all centres.

 In contrast, regular masala movies like Lage Raho Munnabhai (comedy with a message), Pyar Ke Side Effects (a romantic comedy) and even the starless Khosla Ka Ghosla have fared well.

 Krishna has failed to draw even the kids to the theatres, unlike Hanuman that was an instant hit not so long ago. But then Hanuman had its plus points in the cute and chubby baby hero and the films superior animation.

 The failure of the two devotional films is all the more glaring as religious websites have been recording several thousand more hits from overseas in the run-up to Diwali.

 Indians living in the US, UK and Canada have been logging on to sites offering services like online praying and blessings. For anything between $8 and $15, the portals have been selling DVDs of prayer sessions and things like dried flowers and vermilion blessed by purohits.

 (The number of) people registering online for puja during this festival season has surged almost three to four times from the normal days, Mervyn Jose of Saranam, an Indian site, said.

 Trade analysts are attributing the failure of the devotional films not so much to their content as to the proliferation of religious channels on TV.

 I attribute the failure of Jai Santoshi Ma not to its content, but to the clutter of devotional subjects on the tube. In 1975, there was no TV, not many devotionals were made then either. So, coupled with the merit of the film, it had a dream run at the box office, competing with Sholay almost everywhere, analyst Taran Adarsh said. 

 Jai Santoshi Ma director Ahmad Siddique has, however, blamed the flop on the school and college exams.

 The target audience of the film was the 30-plus married women. Due to exams, these women could not make it to the theatres as they preferred to stay home with their kids, he said.

 Also, I think during Navratri people would rather play dandiya. I dont think this is the end of devotional films in Bollywood.

 Going by Siddiques dandiya logic, even Khosla and Woh Lamhe shouldnt have done well. Khosla opened to collections of 30-45 per cent at multiplexes, which went up to 75 per cent for evening shows. Woh Lamhe had a 30-50 per cent opening at multiplexes.

 Besides, if the religious-minded can flock to Mahim late at night to partake of the sweet sea water miracle, why shouldnt they be able to make time for devotional films?

 I was at Mahim during the sweet water phenomena, but why should I spend so much on a movie ticket when I can watch the channels sitting at home? advertising executive Nandini Singh asked.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Seat rain at IIT Kharagpur

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, July 13: In about three years, the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, is likely to offer an extra 3,600 seats and add another 1,900 in the following four years or so.

 The institute today said it planned to raise student intake at its Kharagpur campus from the current 7,000 to 10,000 and also hoped to open its Calcutta campus at Rajarhat, offering more seats, by 2008.

 IIT Kharagpur plans to take in 10,000 students by 2009-10. In fact, we would like to achieve this figure even earlier, said Sanjeev Goenka, chairman of the institutes board of governors.

 The Calcutta campus will be on 10 acres of land and will accommodate 600 students to begin with. We plan to ramp up this figure to 2,500 in the following four years.

 Goenka added that land had already been bought at Rajarhat and the foundation stone-laying ceremony will take place shortly.

 There is an increasing demand for technocrats in India today, and we are going to try our best to meet it.

 The Centre recently asked the IITs (as well as the Indian Institutes of Management and other central institutions) to increase seats so that general category students dont lose out when the 27 per cent Other Backward Classes quota is introduced.

 To offset the loss due to the quota, institutions must increase student intake by about 54 per cent ? a task many of them have balked at citing inadequate infrastructure and a crisis of qualified faculty.

 Bengal, EC in fresh fight

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 21: The Election Commission today set up a showdown with the Bengal government by rapping it for refusing information that will decide if seven CPM members should lose their Parliament seats.

 The commission has given the state time till July 31 to furnish the details it sought last month on the alleged offices of profit held by these MPs.

 The state government had virtually snubbed the commission by sending, instead, the state advocate-generals opinion that the panels enquiries were totally irrelevant and without jurisdiction.

 The AGs report said the picture wasnt at all clear on offices of profit and so, no such information could be given. He also suggested the offices held by the seven MPs didnt attract disqualification from Parliament.

 The state governments communique, to which the AGs report was attached, told the commission it completely endorsed the officials opinion.

 An angry commission has thrown the AGs words back at him, dismissing his opinion on the merits of the individual cases as totally irrelevant and being without jurisdiction.

 The poll panel has cited the Representation of Peoples Act, 1951, to argue that it has the authority to ask for such information, and quoted a Supreme Court observation that it is the EC and EC alone which is competent to tender opinion to the President or to the governor.

 The Election Commission has rejected the stand taken by the government of West Bengal in the matter of providing information related to office of profit issue, the commission said.

 Asked about the standoff, state chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb said: Im not authorised to speak about this. This is a matter between us and the EC.

 The tussle comes within months of the state government and the commission locking horns during the Assembly elections over rolls revision and the staggered polling.

 Ten CPM MPs, including Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee, have been accused of holding offices of profit in a petition by Trinamul Congress leader Mukul Roy.

 The poll panel has sought a response from two of the MPs ? Bansagopal Chowdhury and Lakshman Seth ? by July 31. The case relating to Nilotpal Basu is likely to be closed since his term in the Rajya Sabha has expired.

 The commission had sought information from the state on the other seven, who are: Chatterjee, Mohammed Salim, Hannan Mollah, Amitava Nandi, Sudhanshu Sil, Tarit Baran Topdar and Sujan Chakraborty.

 Ad heat on channels 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 11: The information and broadcasting ministry has cracked the whip on television channels that carry ads in which whisky masquerades as bottled water 

 Forty-three channels have been asked to apologise by running a scroll across the screen round the clock, for three days in a row. 

 The warnings, issued today, reprimand the channels for carrying thinly-disguised surrogate commercials that promote the consumption of products like liquor and tobacco, by proxy.

 Advertisements for these are banned under the Cable Television Networks Rules. No advertisement which promotes directly or indirectly, production, sale or consumption of cigarettes, tobaccos products, wine, alcohol, liquor or other intoxicants, shall be carried, the act states.

 But some advertisers have got around the rules by showing products that are legal. These could be mineral water bottles that share a brand-name and logo with a whisky. Viewers get the message.

 Sometimes, the ministry swings into action. But rarely have so many channels been warned in a single instance. This is seen as a sign that the ministry, which is in the process of re-drafting a comprehensive Broadcast Bill, means business.

 Unless the channels disobey the directive and are ready to face the consequences an apology-scroll will run across your television screens for three consecutive days, from August 18 and 21.

 Even the apology has been spelt out. The ministry of information amp; broadcasting issues a warning to our channel for beaming surrogate advertisements of liquor/tobacco products in violation of the advertising code. We regret this and apologise for it. We assure to be more careful in future.

 Their only consolation is that almost all big names are on the list.

 A warning has also been issued on indecent, vulgar and suggestive commercials. Such advertisements continue to be aired despite notices issued earlier to various channels, the ministry said.

 Lalu s rail to roll into IIM

 NISHIT DHOLABHAI

 Lalu Prasad

 New Delhi, Sept. 17: One of the countrys premier B-schools will tomorrow learn the secret of business success, dished out in the idioms of the bullock-cart economy.

 Lalu Prasad will explain to future CEOs at the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, how he took the bull by the horns as railway minister to script one of the present governments success stories.

 Hum Bharatiya rail ko vishwa ki number one rail banana chahte hain, he may brag in Hindi, wearing those extra-long kurta sleeves and pyjama.

 Or he might choose poetry over prose, as he had done in Parliament, hoping that mere junoon ka natija zaroor niklega, isi siaah samandar se noor niklega (my passion will definitely bear fruit, from this dark ocean a light will emerge).

 That would please the institute. It believes that it was Lalu Prasads personality that had worked the miracle, turning the railways around after it was virtually written off by the Rakesh Mohan committee in 2001. For the IIM, the man is the message.

 The ministers two-hour lecture is titled Changes and transformation in the railways but Lalu Prasad has his own name for it: Kal aaj aur kal ki rail (Yesterday, today and tomorrow of the railways). He will talk about the railways past and present, and his vision for 2015, backed by investment plans.

 Invitations had been coming the ministers way from several business schools, but the IIM Ahmedabad plan was finalised about a week ago, sources said. Just before that, he had been handed a case-study report on the railways, done by an institute professor, G. Raghuraman.

 It was after this that we finalised the visit to IIM Ahmedabad. Before that, too, the minister had been in constant touch with Professor Raghuraman, a source said.

 The case study will be part of the institutes curriculum.

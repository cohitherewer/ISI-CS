 Water cripples crucial airbase

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 28: A major forward airbase of the Indian Air Force at Uttarlai in Rajasthans Barmer district has become non-functional for fighter aircraft after floods raged through the establishment. 

 More than half the runway was under water, making it impossible for a squadron of MiG 21 interceptor aircraft stationed in the base to operate.

 About 150 people are reported to have died in flash floods in Barmer.

 But a squadron of multi-utility Mi-8 helicopters, also based in Uttarlai, that take off and land vertically were still able to fly and were being used for relief, air force sources said here today. With the Uttarlai airbase less than four minutes flying-time from the Pakistan border for the MiG 21 aircraft non-functional, aircraft in three other forward bases have been tasked to share Uttarlais area of responsibility.

 Even in times of peace, the forward bases have to maintain a high level of alert. Only last week, MiG 21 interceptors from Suratgarh in Rajasthan were scrambled after Indian Air Force radar detected a blip that came into the no-fly zone over the border before returning to its base in Pakistan. 

 Uttarlai, in the South Western Air Command, went under water about four days back. Air Force sources said water had begun to recede by this evening. 

 Since the runway is inclined, about half of it was not waterlogged. But water had entered the parking area for aircraft and parts of the airbase were said to be under five to seven feet of water. 

 An assessment on when the runway can be used for planes will be possible after the water recedes fully.

 Army sources in Delhi said engineer task forces with boats and life jackets had been deployed in Uttarlai-Kawas, Malwa and near National Highway 15. Roads between Barmer and Jaisalmer were badly damaged.

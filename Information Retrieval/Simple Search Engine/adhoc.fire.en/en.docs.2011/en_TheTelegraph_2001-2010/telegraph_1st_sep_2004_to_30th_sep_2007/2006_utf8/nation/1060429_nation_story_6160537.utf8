 Sharad quota jab at BJP

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 28: The Janata Dal (United) today sought to distance itself from the BJP, charging its NDA ally with doublespeak on reservation for OBC students in central educational institutions.

 Throwing his lot behind HRD minister Arjun Singh, Dal (United) president Sharad Yadav said: The BJP is indulging in double-speak. While it supported the 93rd Amendment Act (that provided for reservation in central educational institutions), it is now demanding a fresh debate on the issue.

 Yadav not only lashed out at the shilly-shallying attitude of the BJP, but also at Singhs detractor in the UPA government ? science and technology minister Kapil Sibal ? for speaking against the proposed reservation.

 The Prime Minister should dismiss him from his cabinet because Sibal has violated the principle of collective responsibility. Sibal was present in the cabinet meeting which approved the draft constitutional amendment bill. By talking against the reservation to OBCs in central government educational institutions, he has talked against the same Constitution, Yadav said.

 While Sibal had recently expressed apprehension that the proposed reservation could have a negative impact on Indias ability to compete in the world, the BJP had attacked the central government for taking a hasty decision without having adequate debate.

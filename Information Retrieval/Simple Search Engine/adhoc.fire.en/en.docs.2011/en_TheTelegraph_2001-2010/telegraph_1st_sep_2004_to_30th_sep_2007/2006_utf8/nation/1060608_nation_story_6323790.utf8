The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Left drops strike plan

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, June 7: The Left 

 Front in Bengal has decided not to call a strike against 

 the petroleum price hike as it might send a wrong message 

 to potential investors.

 Instead, it will hold statewide demonstrations and rallies to protest against the hike, keeping in mind the image of Bengal.

 Although the issue came up at todays front meeting, chairman Biman Bose denied that the option of strike was discussed.

 When some front partners wanted to know whether calling a strike would be feasible and prudent, Bose said it might send wrong signals to investors and there was not enough time to prepare for such an agitation.

 There is hardly any time to call a strike and one has to keep in mind that it may send wrong signals to captains of industry, Bose told a front leader during the meeting.

 However, the front chairman later said the option of strike had not been discussed. There was no discussion on whether to call a strike.

 Besides organising protest meetings in the next few days, the Left Front will stage sit-ins in front of regional offices of oil companies on June 13.

 When told that the Union petroleum minister had announced there would be no rollback, Bose said: I do not attach much importance to what the petroleum minister is saying. If the Prime Minister says something, things will take a different shape.

 NDA agitation

 The NDA will hold demonstrations, including satyagraha, and top leaders will court arrest on June 12 to protest against the petrol price hike. The Opposition alliance also announced plans for protests at all district headquarters on June 19.

 Cheque relief for company officers

 New Delhi The director 

 or any other official of a company cannot be summoned by 

 a court in a cheque bounce case unless the complainant states 

 in a sworn statement that he was in charge of the companys 

 affairs at that time, the Supreme Court has ruled.

 Merely being a director of a company is not sufficient to make a person liable under Section 141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, the court said.

 Under Section 200 of the CrPC, it is mandatory for a complainant to make statements on oath as to how the offence has been committed and how the accused are responsible, the court said. 

 In a case where the court is required to issue summons, which would put the accused to some sort of harassment, the court should insist on strict compliance of the statutory requirements, the court said, while quashing summons issued to two directors of a Bangalore-based firm.

 The director and other top officials of a company are usually made parties in cheque bounce cases, and, in most of them, the court summons all those named by the complainant.

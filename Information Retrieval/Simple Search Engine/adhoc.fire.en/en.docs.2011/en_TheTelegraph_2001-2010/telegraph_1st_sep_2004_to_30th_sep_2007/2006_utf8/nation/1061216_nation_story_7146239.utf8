 Train blast 11 confirm Pak hand

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Dec. 15: The confessions of 11 accused in the July 11 train blasts have reaffirmed Mumbai polices claim that the ISI and the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Toiba were involved in the attack.

 Last evening, designated judge Mridula Bhatkar unveiled their confessions recorded before a magistrate. 

 Although all the 11 have retracted their statements, they can be put before a court if supplemented with corroborative evidence under the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act, legal sources said.

 Much of the information in the confessions has already been revealed by the police.

 A fact not known earlier was that the plot to attack the disputed site in Ayodhya in 2005 was hatched by a Lashkar module in Mumbai. Faisal Sheikh, the prime accused, who made the confession, said he went to Pakistan in 2002 to attend an ISI-run training camp near Muzaffarabad. The atrocities on Muslims during the Gujarat riots had made him head to Pakistan, he added. 

 Mohammed Kamaluddin Ansari, who had assembled the pressure-cooker bombs, said he was angered by deputy chief minister R.R. Patils comment after a mob lynched two policemen in Bhiwandi.

 Eent ka jawab golise denge (we will respond with bullets), Patil was quoted as saying. My associate Ehtesham said in another two days, we will reply to the bullets with bombs, Ansari said.

 Congress MP arrested 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Behrampore, May 5: Congress MP Mannan Hossain was arrested today in connection with a 17-year-old case.

 The MP from Murshidabad was on his way to the assistant chief judicial magistrates court in Lalbag to surrender. But he was handcuffed before that.

 Hossain has been remanded in two weeks jail custody.

 Police said an FIR lodged in July 1989 accused Hossain of leading a mob of 50 to ransack the office of the sub-divisional officer (SDO) of Lalbag, about 230 km from Calcutta, during a demonstration for a college. Hossain was then an MLA from Lalbag.

 The Congress leader and his aides were also charged with clashing with the police and the security personnel of the SDO. However, later all those involved in the case applied for and were granted interim bail from the court except Hossain. The MP did not get bail from any court due to some unknown reason, a police officer of Lalbag said. 

 The case resurfaced after the Election Commission asked the government to arrest all those against whom non-bailable warrants were pending. Murshidabad police brought out a fresh court warrant three months ago and asked Hossain to either surrender or face arrest. 

 The MP moved Calcutta High Court on April 17, the first day of polling in Bengal. But Hossains petition was quashed and he was asked to surrender in the Lalbag court by today. 

 Hossain today said he was not aware of the case till the fresh warrant appeared. The police or the general administration never reminded me in all these years that a criminal case is pending against me.

 The arrest had Hossains party crying foul. The ruling CPM has asked police to arrest Hossain fearing reverses in the just concluded elections. We shall launch a state-wide movement to malign the party, said Pradip Bhattacharya, the state Congress working president.

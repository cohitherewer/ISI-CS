 Kannada void fills up with violence

 Bangalore, April 13: Young Edison Raj stood outside Kanteerava stadium, waving a Rajkumar poster and singing.

 Huttidare Kannada nadalli huttabeku (If youre born, you should be born in Kannada land)?, he sang, trying to impress the policemen guarding the VIP entrance into letting him enter.

 The young man with a pronounced limp told the policemen: You name the movie and I will sing any song. In exchange, a burly lawkeeper gave him a friendly shove. 

 Edison was among the tens of thousands who had turned up to have a last look at their icon Rajkumar ? a film star who was much more than a film star.

 Amid the violence that rocked Bangalore today, sullying its name as the countrys IT capital as rampaging mobs of Rajkumar fans set alight buses and police vehicles and stoned company offices, many in the city and in the rest of India wondered why.

 It is a natural death. Why are the fans getting violent? Reuters quoted a street vendor as saying.

 There were certain provocations for mob fury today as mourners could not catch a last glimpse of their hero with the police stepping in to control the huge crowds at the stadium and on the 12-km route to the burial place at Kanteerava Studios. But the violence had started inexplicably soon after 77-year-old Rajkumars death yesterday.

 Rajkumar had been championing the cause of the Kannada language and the now-languishing film industry. A quarter century ago, he had joined the leaders of the agitation that sought use of Kannada in official communication and as the medium of education in primary schools.

 The demand had its root in the recommendations of a committee headed by renowned Kannada litterateur the late V.K. Gokak.

 Kannada is the language of official communication ? in government, the police force and the lower courts ? but the battle still rages to make it the medium of education. Fully government-run schools use Kannada but those that only take monetary assistance have refused and taken their opposition to court. There is also a government order that no new English medium schools will be allowed to come up with official assistance.

 In highly cosmopolitan Bangalore, which in recent years have been swamped by people from other states, English billboards get periodically tarred by language crusaders. The Rajkumar fans association, headed by his brother-in-law S.R. Govindaraju, is linked to an organisation called Kannada Rakshana Vedike whose members perform this ritual once a year.

 It has led even global brands to use Kannada in small print next to huge English letters in Bangalores swank shopping districts.

 Although the extent of violence has taken the administration by surprise, this is not the first time Rajkumar fans have behaved thus. Trouble had broken out once in the eighties after a rumour that he had died, forcing Rajkumar to come on TV and reassure his admirers. 

 Some years later, as a result of a misunderstanding that the then chief minister, J.H. Patel, had insulted their idol, the fans attacked government cars parked in front of the secretariat. On a third occasion in 2000, they damaged some 100 buses in Bangalore alone after Rajkumar was kidnapped by Veerappan.

 There isnt another local icon like Rajkumar, who chose to act only in Kannada films. He was part of the opposition to the telecast of Sanjay Khans The Sword of Tipu Sultan in the early 1990s dubbed in Kannada. Bowing to pressure, the then Congress government banned the serial.

 According to a PTI report, Rajkumar had said: The Kannada film industry offers a vast pool of talent. We are capable of producing such serials on our own.

 More recently, the Kannada film industry launched an agitation demanding that movies in the local language be given a run in theatres for a specific number of days every year. Although an ailing Rajkumar did not quite hit the streets, he was assumed to be the leader of the movement.

 His three sons are also actors but they are only actors.

 To see their father kept for public viewing at the stadium, Kaverappa and Kaveramma, an elderly couple, started from their home at Channapatna, 70 km from Bangalore, last night. We hoped to make it to the stadium by morning. I did not know there would be such a huge crowd, said 70-year-old Kaverappa who had been there from 5 am.

 Shield for tigers

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Watch out poachers 

 New Delhi, June 19: The Indian Army may be deployed to protect the tiger. 

 Soldiers in designated areas can shoot and kill poachers and army formation commanders will have the powers of the chief conservator of forests if a move to amend relevant laws goes through.

 Army chief General Joginder Jaswant Singh was briefed at a meeting at the ministry of environment and forests today about a new role that the army may have to take on. The meeting was attended by representatives of the Worldwide Fund for Nature and conservationists.

 Much of the armys deployment is in or close to forests and jungles over which conservationists have voiced concern. 

 Last year, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh personally took an interest in conserving the Indian tiger and visited Ranthambore in Rajasthan. 

 The number of Indian tigers is estimated to have dwindled sharply to about 3,700.

 Amendments to the Wildlife Act to empower the army for conservation may be moved in the monsoon session of Parliament.

 The army is engaged in conservation mostly in its own establishments that cover huge areas. But todays proposal made to the army chief would institutionalise its role. 

 Crime bureau

 The government has decided to set up a wildlife crime control bureau to protect animals and check smuggling of their skin and body parts.

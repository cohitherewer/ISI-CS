 Isro plan for TV in car

 Bangalore, Jan. 8 (PTI): The Indian Space Research Organisation has embarked on a project which will enable it to extend televisions reach to mobile platforms such as cars and feed the demand in the direct-to-home (DTH) segment.

 Once the Isro project is in place, people can watch their favourite channels even in jungles and remote regions.

 If you can reach television signals to mobile platforms like cars and trucks, its going to be a big boon. So, we have embarked on a project of that kind, said Isro chairman G. Madhavan Nair.

 Isro, Nair added, should be able to put the project into operation in less than three years.

 Nair said Isro would make KU band transponders more powerful, increase the size of antenna deployed in space and compress bandwidth required for transmission to take TV pictures right into automobiles.

 If you want to go for mobile applications, you require very high power and, secondly, it should be concentrated so that at the receiving end, the antenna on the rooftop of a car will be able to pick up (TV) signals, Nair said.

 Besides, the power has to be three to four times more than what is now being used. We also have to compress the bandwidth.? Bring down 2 mhz per second to 500 khz per second, the Isro chairman said.

 Once Isro achieves these, Nair expects a huge global market for this technology. Especially for the African region and developing countries, this becomes a unique resource, he said.

 Isro is also not losing sight of the home segment. It has planned to deploy 24 additional KU band transponders ? that enable transmission of an estimated 288 DTH channels ? by the end of this year to meet the requirements of various broadcasting companies.

 Insat-4c that Isro plans to launch in April or May is a dedicated satellite for DTH applications with 12 KU band transponders. 

 Insat-4b, slated to be launched sometime in the middle of this year, is also equipped with 12 KU band transponders.

 Today, for DTH transmission, demand is going up. We already have about 17 KU band transponders, including 12 recently launched (Insat-4a). We need another 24. With that, we will be just meeting the total requirement of the country, Nair said.

 The Isro chairman rejected criticism from some quarters on the way the 12 KU band transponders in Insat-4a were leased to Tata-Sky, the DTH joint venture of the Tatas and the STAR group.

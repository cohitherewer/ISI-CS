 Mumbai, July 16: Prateek Sawant desperately wants to talk to his elder brother Parag, but cant. He hasnt been able to since Tuesday when Parag slipped into a coma after being caught in the deadly train blasts.

 An employee of Akruti Nirman, a construction firm in Andheri, 25-year-old Parag was returning to his Bhayander home from office that evening. The train crossed Mira Road but before it could enter Bhayander station, a bomb exploded, seriously injuring him in the head.

 Parag was rushed to Bhakti Vedant Hospital on Mira Road for an emergency surgery. We didnt know his whereabouts till nearly 9 pm because of the mobile network congestion. He was shifted to Hinduja hospital later, where a second surgery has begun at 12 noon, said Prateek, who has been praying for his brothers survival.

 Prateek is worried about the stiff medical bill that awaits his family. The hospital has asked us to pay. I am not sure about the amount but it is in the range of Rs 1.5 lakh. We reminded them about the chief ministers announcement that the state would foot the bill for hospitalisation. The hospital insists we pay first, and claim the amount later from the government, he said.

 Like Parag, many others continue to battle for life even five days after death struck Mumbais lifeline. Theres Sanjay Shirke at KEM hospital, with a fractured cervical vertebra. There are also two homoeopathy students at Nanavati hospital who are not in a good way.

 Sanjay suffered multiple fractures and lost a huge amount of blood. We had to give him five units. We sincerely hope he recovers. Our doctors are working hard, said Neelima Kshirsagar, KEM dean who showed the Prime Minister around the hospital on Thursday.

 KEM admitted over 72 patients within 15 minutes of the blasts at Matunga and Mahim, of whom five are still critical.

 Of the five, we have one who had a metal piece lodged inside his chest. He was operated on within 30 minutes of arrival, and he has shown good progress. The rest are still critical, she said.

 At Nanavati hospital, homoeopathy student Aparna Salvi has constantly been talking to her classmate Ishan Thakkar in the ICU to bolster his will to fight and recover. The duo had finished classes at their medical college in Vile Parle and had been on their way home together when the blast near Jogeshwari happened.

 Though both were admitted to Cooper, neither knew the other was in the same hospital. Both met here at Nanavati. Aparna goes and speaks to Ishan, whose condition has improved, Aparnas father Vivek Salvi said over the phone from the hospital.

 Aparnas little finger on the left hand had to be amputated and her hearing has been affected. Doctors said it would take five to seven weeks before her hearing improves.

 Aparna is a brave girl. She told herself that she would live, and she would not die. I am just happy my child is with me, Vivek said.

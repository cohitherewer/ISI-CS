The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Pakistan role in 7/11 placed before Bush

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mulford

 New Delhi, Oct. 6: Before confronting Pakistan with evidence of the Inter-Services Intelligences involvement in the Mumbai train blasts, Delhi has shared the case dossier with Washington.

 The US ambassador to India, David Mulford, today said the two governments had discussed the evidence, whose nature he did not reveal.

 The discussions were held after September 30, when Mumbai police made public their findings about Pakistans alleged role in the July 11 blasts, Mulford said.

 He added that India and the US were working together to fight terrorism, and Washington had offered forensic assistance in crime investigation.

 But the ambassador had bad news for backers of the Indo-US nuclear deal. Not only is the bill unlikely to be taken up during the lame duck Senate session after the November 7 congressional elections, he suggested, but even the House of Representatives nod may not count any more.

 The bill, if and when it is passed by the Senate, is required to go to a joint conference of both Houses to reconcile their considerable differences. Only then can the bill that is, its final version be placed before the President.

 Mulford said if the bill is not ready for the Presidents signature by the end of this year as is likely the entire legislative process must begin afresh when the new Congress meets in January.

 It will be a setback, for the Bush administration will have to place the bill again before Congress, which must repeat the painstaking legislative procedure all over again. Mulford regretted that the Senate could not take the bill up because of an overcrowded agenda and pre-election emotions.

 He said there would be no weakening of the Bush administrations resolve to place the bill before the new Congress.

 Meetings with the Nuclear Suppliers Group would, however, continue; so would the discussions on the bilateral 123 agreement, which details the modus operandi for implementing the deal, he said.

 The ambassador rejected speculation that the deal could run into rough weather if the Democrats, who have criticised aspects of the pact, win majority in both chambers of Congress. He said there has been strong support for the deal on both sides of the aisle.

 He argued that the deal was the best that could have been struck and said there would not be any changes at the end.

 Mulford also ruled out re-negotiation of the deal after the formation of the new Congress. Some of the key issues, such as the fissile material cut-off pact and the moratorium on nuclear testing by India, could be dealt with in the bilateral 123 agreement, which has not been finalised yet.

 Set-top boxes cheaper

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Feb. 28: Announcements in the Union budget on set-top box duties have been greeted by the cable fraternity as a positive step towards achieving Indias digitisation target by 2010.

 Finance minister P. Chidambaram declared that customs duty on set-top boxes ? required to view digital transmissions of TV channels ? has been slashed from 15 per cent to nil while excise duty of 16 per cent has been imposed. He said the change will equalise the duty rates on various types of set-top boxes.

 Multi-system operators (MSO) in India had procured large consignments of set-top boxes in 2003 when the earlier government was trying to implement the conditional access system (CAS). With CAS failing to take off, most MSOs have been stuck with the boxes, often several lakhs of them.

 The announcement will not affect those of us who have existing inventories but will benefit our second-round orders and other MSOs planning a foray into digital transmission, said K. Jayaraman, managing director of Hathway Datacom, one of the largest MSOs in the country.

 With the Telecom Regulatory Authority announcing a 2010 deadline for all cable networks in India to provide digital services, MSOs are now upgrading their networks from analogue to digital. Digital transmission is the way ahead for a better viewer experience. The slash in customs duty is a right step in that direction, said an MSO official here. 

 Doing away with customs duty and introduction of excise duty will restrict imports to high-end components and prevent whole-scale import of the boxes, thereby encouraging local manufacturing.

 However, even if assembling (is done) and some smaller components are made in India, it would still be sometime before set-top boxes are fully manufactured here, said Jayaraman.

 The move is likely to benefit the direct-to-home segment as well. But, the rise in service tax from 10 to 12 per cent means that cable subscriptions will go up.

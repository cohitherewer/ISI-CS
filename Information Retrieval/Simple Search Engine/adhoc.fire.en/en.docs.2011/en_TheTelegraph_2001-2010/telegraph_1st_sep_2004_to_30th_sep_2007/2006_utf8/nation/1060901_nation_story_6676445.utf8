 Citu preaches safe sex, door to door

 BISWAJIT ROY

 Calcutta, Aug. 31: Discussing sex is no longer taboo for Bengal communists. The CPMs labour arm will be travelling door-to-door to peddle safe sex among comrades.

 Citu workers will fan out to workers mohallas (neighbourhoods) and union offices to explain how people get AIDS and the benefits of using condoms.

 To impress on them the need for precaution against sexually transmitted diseases, well be using slide shows along with posters and pamphlets, said Citu state secretary Kali Ghosh. We will also encourage the women in our ranks to interact with and educate the women in workers families.

 Workers, particularly the migrants among them who miss out on regular family life, form one of the largest groups of AIDS carriers in India.

 We cannot advise them against having sex; so we are urging them to have safe sex, Citu president Shyamal Chakraborty said.

 Citu-affiliated unions would organise medical camps and bring healthcare to workers who have AIDS.

 The unions of construction and transport workers and seamen have been asked to focus on the campaign as these workers are often forced to stay away from home for long periods. Unions of electricity workers have also been given the same instruction.

 Integrated Child Development Scheme employees have been drafted in the effort because of their reach among target families.

 Citu activists from these unions will undergo training and evolve effective campaign programmes. We want to reach out to 100,000 workers in 2006, Chakraborty said.

 For greater impact, the Citu brass might even turn to Tollywood. Celebrities will be drafted in to popularise the message, Chakraborty said.

 The awareness programme will teach workers and their families when to be afraid of AIDS and when not.

 The fear of infection, though often misplaced, is so great that its difficult to convince workers against abandoning an HIV-positive colleague. We succeeded in getting a seaman reinstated after he was sacked for being HIV-positive. But the other crew members left the ship, Chakraborty said.

 The World Bank and Britains department for international development will provide Bengal with Rs 72.5 crore in 2006-07 towards AIDS control.

 The Centre has also decided to engage trade unions in AIDS awareness campaigns among workers, said Niharendu Deb, deputy director of the state AIDS Prevention and Control Society.

 But the Citu secretary couldnt help a parting sting.

 Government-run campaigns appear to be only encouraging masti (fun) by emphasising the use of condom and safe sex. I cant support an approach that ignores the question of sexual morality. We will also focus on moral values in our campaign, Ghosh said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 BJP wakes up to bug bite

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 9: Yesterday, it was N. Chandrababu Naidu. Today, it is L.K. Advani. 

 The BJP has joined the phone-tapping chorus, alleging that former chief L.K. Advanis phone was tapped during the Volcker controversy. Party president Rajnath Singh has demanded an all-party meeting to discuss the issue.

 Advani said his phone was tapped during the time the Volcker issue was being debated. I was told that my phone was being tapped during the time we were discussing the Volcker issue in Parliament. But I was not aware of it. It should be investigated, he said after returning here from Rajasthan today.

 He said the earlier NDA government had scrupulously followed the Supreme Court guidelines in this regard. There was not a single case of violation of the Supreme Court guidelines, he added.

 Although the BJP is keen to embarrass the Congress-led government by demanding the all-party meeting, senior leaders do not want to link the larger issues of political surveillance and privacy to Samajwadi Party leader Amar Singhs individual grievance.

 This is a serious issue. It should be investigated. All political parties should sit together and decide on the format of the probe in which all parties have faith, Rajnath said. Asked what kind of probe the BJP wanted, he said any probe which has the trust of all political parties.

 But Rajnath mentioned neither the Samajwadi Party nor Amars allegations against the UPA government, though the BJP joined the chorus only after Amar had broadbased his campaign to involve Tamil Nadu chief minister Jayalalithaa and Telugu Desam Party chief Naidu.

 The Samajwadi Party leader has been trying to involve the BJP in his campaign. I have spoken to senior BJP leaders. I have spoken to L.K. Advani. It is an issue that should concern every political party, Amar said.

 But the BJP took care to avoid getting involved. Even when the party took up the issue today, Swami Chinmayanand, a senior BJP leader, mocked Amar in Jaunpur, wondering aloud why the Samajwadi Party leader was so perturbed by the phone-tapping.

 BJP spokesperson Prakash Javadekar said senior party leaders had received credible information four days ago that Advanis phone was being tapped. In the light of the fact that other senior leaders ? Jayalalithaa and Naidu ? are saying their phones are being tapped, it has become a very serious issue, he added. 

 Mamata cry

 In Calcutta, Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee alleged that her telephone and that of other party leaders were being tapped at the behest of the Left Front government in Bengal.

 But she added that this had nothing to do with the alleged tapping of Amar Singhs phone.

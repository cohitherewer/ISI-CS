The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Hop into a houseboat, off Goa

 SUDESHNA BANERJEE

 Calcutta, June 11: For those bidding goodbye to a dream shikara date on the Dal Lake after the recent attack on tourists, all is not lost. Houseboats beckon from another corner of the country ? Maharashtra.

 Come October and the Maharashtra Tourism Development Corporation will put out its fleet in the backwaters of Konkan.

 The coast has numerous creeks not far away from the sea. We want to exploit the area to promote tourism. This will be a pioneering initiative in the state, said Abhay Yawalkar, MTDC joint managing director, over the phone from Mumbai.

 The chosen routes are Tarkarli-Nerur Par and Aronda Creek, not far from Goa. The nearest airport, Yawalkar said, is at Panaji at a dis- tance of 90 km while Kudal, 30 km away, is the closest rail station.

 Tarkarli boasts a carpet of sparkling sand, balmy breeze and clear water, through which the seabed can be seen up to a depth of 20 feet. Aronda Creek is an equally picturesque route.

 The 80-foot-long houseboats of wood and fibre are equipped with central air-conditioning. They have furnished bedrooms, a sun deck, living rooms, dining area and spacious kitchens fitted out with fire extinguishers. A professional crew takes care of the housekeeping and other services.

 For the adventurous, a small boat will be attached with the houseboat so that they can go on explorations. A jetty would be available for boarding the houseboat with ease.

 There will be two kinds of boats to choose from ? luxury and standard. Both will offer two-bedroom accommodation and a restaurant, the sun deck being the add-on for the luxury boat.

 The houseboats will navigate the wide network of lagoons spread across rice fields, coconut groves and temples.

 We are starting with three boats ? two standard and one luxury. The boats are coming in end-September from Kerala, which is possibly the only state other than Kashmir to offer this facility, the MTDC official said.

 The charges havent been worked out yet. We might offer packages inclusive of meals, the official said.

 The season for embarking is October to May, avoiding the rough seas.

 Now that MTDC is setting off on its maiden voyage, it hopes to have private operators following suit, exploiting the other creeks, too.

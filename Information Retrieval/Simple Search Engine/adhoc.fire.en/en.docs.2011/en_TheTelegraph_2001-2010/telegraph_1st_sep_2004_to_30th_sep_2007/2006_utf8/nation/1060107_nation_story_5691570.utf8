 First UAV squadron over seas

New Delhi, Jan. 6: The navy today bolstered its policing role in the Arabian Sea and Indian Ocean region by commissioning its first squadron of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) at its base in Kochi, Kerala.

 Indian Naval Air Squadron (Inas) 342 comprises six Israel-supplied medium-altitude Heron and high-altitude searcher Mark II UAVs. 

 Defence sources here said the navy was in the process of setting up more squadrons of UAVs along the west coast and some of them will be tasked to carry out surveillance in the north Arabian Sea.

 The squadron in Kochi was commissioned by navy chief Admiral Arun Prakash. 

 The induction of the UAV platforms will add to our capability as these would serve as force multipliers in support of fleet operations, a navy spokesperson said in New Delhi.

 The commissioning of the UAV squadron still does not fulfil the navys need for maritime surveillance aircraft. It is seeking to replace its depleted surveillance fleet with long-range Tupolev 142 aircraft from Russia and is also in talks with the US to acquire the P3C Orion aircraft.

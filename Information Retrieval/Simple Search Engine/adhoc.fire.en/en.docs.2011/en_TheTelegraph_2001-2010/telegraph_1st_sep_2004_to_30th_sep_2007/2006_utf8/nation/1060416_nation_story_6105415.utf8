 Ahmedabad, April 15: BJP workers today ransacked the Vadodara office of Narmada Bachao Andolan, which is campaigning against the increase in the height of Sardar Sarovar dam, and stalled the screening of Aamir Khan-starrer Rang De Basanti at several theatres.

 The office at Ellora Park was locked when the mob descended on it in the evening, Vadodara police chief Deepak Swaroop said. Its occupants were luckily not there.

 The BJP workers ? angry that the Centre has proposed suspending work on the dam ? broke open the lock and ransacked the office.

 Earlier in the day, party activists had stalled the screening of Rang De Basanti in Vadodara and Ahmedabad. 

 Aamir has come out in support of Medha and, accompanied by some members of the Rang De cast, yesterday joined NBA activists protesting at Jantar Mantar in New Delhi.

 The attack on Aamir started yesterday, when some Congress workers ? all parties in Gujarat agree on the dam ? stalled the screening of Rang De in a Vadodara theatre. Reports have come from Rajkot that Congress, BJP and NCP activists forced the owner of a theatre to stop showing the film. 

 Not to be outdone by chief minister Narendra Modi, who has announced a 51-hour fast in favour of the dam, the Congress has called a Gujarat bandh tomorrow. 

 But while Modi declared that his fast is against the anti-Narmada, anti-Gujarat and anti-development stand of the UPA government, the Congress unit spokesman, Hasmukh Patel, claimed that the bandh was not against the Centre. 

 We want to put our point of view so that the Prime Minister understands the pulse of the state. We do not want the construction work to raise the height of dam to be stopped at any cost, he said. 

 Gujarat unit chief Bharat Solanki will meet the Prime Minister tomorrow, along with a team of MPs and NGO representatives.

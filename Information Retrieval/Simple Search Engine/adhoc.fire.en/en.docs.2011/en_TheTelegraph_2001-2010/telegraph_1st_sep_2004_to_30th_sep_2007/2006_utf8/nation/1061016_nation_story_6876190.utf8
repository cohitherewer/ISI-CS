 Fresh viral siege in child-killer zone

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, Oct. 15: After 

 encephalitis and polio, the Coxsackie B virus has joined 

 the microbial siege of children in impoverished eastern 

 Uttar Pradesh, killing 150 in the past two months.

 An encephalitis epidemic had killed over 1,800 children in the region last year. A spurt in polio this year caused a global study to dub India the worlds lone polio exporter, prompting United Nations chief Kofi Annan to prod Delhi to act.

 And now, when the state is battling dengue which has killed 20-odd people and infected 300 more, news comes of Coxsackie B posing a threat of an epidemic.

 Doctors say the abysmal public hygiene in eastern Uttar Pradesh districts like Gorakhpur and Basti has helped the virus spread fast. All the victims are children.

 The disease has been seen earlier, too, in eastern Uttar Pradesh. This time, after we managed to control the mosquito menace and the spread of encephalitis, we are facing a new challenge: the Coxsackie B, a senior doctor in Gorakhpur said.

 Named after Coxsackie, New York, where it was discovered in 1948, the virus belongs to the enterovirus family that includes echoviruses, polio and Hepatitis A. It lives in the digestive tract.

 It spreads through food and water contaminated with faeces, where it can survive for days. It can spread from humans to humans through contact with unwashed hands, or through mucosal secretions such as cough or sputum.

 Good sanitation and clean drinking water can prevent the spread of the virus, said T.N. Dhole, microbiology professor at a state-run medical institute here. Both are rare in rural Uttar Pradesh.

 In the tropics, the virus can infect people the year round, but in cooler climates, outbreaks happen usually in summer or autumn.

 The symptoms were first reported from some villages near Gorakhpur in August, said A.K. Mishra, principal secretary, health. Blood tests found 61 positive cases. We have been receiving news of high fever among the children from the districts. A drive to get blood samples has been launched, he said.

 The infected children develop fever with temperatures of 101 to 104 degrees Fahrenheit (38.3 to 40 degrees Celsius), headache and muscle ache. Some also have mild sore throat and abdominal discomfort or nausea.

 In some, the fever lasts about three days and then disappears for good. In others, it appears for one day before subsiding, but returns after two to three days and lasts another two to four days. Long-term effects range from gastrointestinal upsets to paralysis or multi-organ failure.

 Health workers said that once the fever ebbs the first time, the children are taken home and when it returns, families are unwilling to travel the long distance to hospital again from their villages. The children are treated by village quacks and often die of inadequate treatment.

 Uttar Pradesh is also fighting a chikungunya outbreak. Some 15 cases have been reported, mostly from villages in Jhansi and Lalitpur areas of Bundelkhand bordering Madhya Pradesh.

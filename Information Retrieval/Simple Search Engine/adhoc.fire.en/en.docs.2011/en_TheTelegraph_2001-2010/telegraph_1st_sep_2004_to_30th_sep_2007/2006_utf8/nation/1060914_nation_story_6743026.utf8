The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Welfare quota on drawing board

 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY

 New Delhi, Sept. 13: The Centre is planning to invest Rs 10,000 crore in 39,000 scheduled caste-majority villages across the country, without taking a single extra penny out of its coffers.

 A committee of ministers headed by defence minister Pranab Mukherjee is set to clear a plan this week to transform the villages into the Prime Ministers model villages with better housing, drinking water, boarding schools and entrepreneurial loans for residents.

 About Rs 2,000 crore is likely to be spent from this year onwards for five years, though officials who are working on the fine print say this could go up to Rs 3,500 crore. But the beauty of the scheme is that no new budgetary allocations will need to be made.

 We will tie up this scheme with the Bharat Nirman programme as well as several centrally-sponsored schemes like the Indira Awas Yojana for better rural housing, the slum improvement scheme, the drinking water mission, etc. and concentrate their funds on these villages, an official said. 

 Ministries and states implementing these schemes for which funds have already been allocated will simply be asked to concentrate on villages where 50 per cent or more of the population is Dalit.

 The development quota system for Dalit villages follows the 27 per cent reservation for Other Backward Classes another big vote bank in higher education. 

 Politically, it will be difficult for any minister or state government to oppose the plan because the scheduled castes make up a 14-crore-strong vote bank. The meeting this week should get commitments from some 10 ministries overseeing the schemes that they will concentrate their funds on the chosen villages.

 Most politicians privy to the scheme see it as the Congresss attempt to win back the huge Dalit vote bank it has lost to the caste-based parties. 

 Backward caste votes are crucial 

 in Uttar Pradesh, which goes to polls next year. The state 

 also has the largest number of villages identified for the 

 scheme and the most Dalits covered. 

 But even if the motive is political, the economic logic of targeting scheduled caste-majority villages for development cannot be faulted. While 27 per cent of rural India is living below the poverty line, the percentage of Dalits under the poverty line is 36.25. 

 Besides, it is our empirical analysis that Dalit-majority villages where other castes co-reside are the poorest in any given block, an official said.

 Other than Mukherjee, home minister Shivraj Patil and human resource development minister Arjun Singh, the committee also includes Meira Kumar the Congresss Dalit face and its chief Dalit ally Ram Vilas Paswan, who is also minister for steel. Paswan, however, will not be at the meeting as he is in Europe.

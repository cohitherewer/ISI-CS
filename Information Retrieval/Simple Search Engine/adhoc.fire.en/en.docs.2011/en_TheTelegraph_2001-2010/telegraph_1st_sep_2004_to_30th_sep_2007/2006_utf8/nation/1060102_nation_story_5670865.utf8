 Ulfa gets safe-passage carrot

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Gogoi: New Year gift

 Guwahati, Jan. 1: Encouraged by peace feelers from the outlawed Ulfa for the first time in 27 years of insurgency in Assam, chief minister Tarun Gogoi today came up with another festival safe-passage offer for members of the outfit and hoped that the gesture would not only be accepted but also reciprocated.

 To be valid for a fortnight, beginning January 7, the offer is meant to enable the militants to reunite with their families for Magh Bihu on January 13-14. The Ulfa had rejected all previous offers of safe passage, but Dispur believes the outfit would appreciate its gesture this time round.

 The next round of talks between the Ulfa-constituted Peoples Consultative Group, a team of handpicked mediators from various fields, and Delhi is expected to begin in a few days. Delhi has already expressed its willingness to call a truce with the militant group if it continues to maintain its commitment to the nascent peace process.

 Gogoi told the media at his official residence that only unarmed militants could avail of the safe-passage offer. To avoid arrest, Ulfa members are required to inform the government when they will visit their homes so that the information can be passed to all police stations.

 Listing his governments achievements of the past year, the chief minister said there had been a paradigm shift in the governments approach towards the problem of militancy. We have changed the governments way of dealing with militancy. The shift has been from confrontation to negotiation, and this has helped restore a semblance of normality in Assam.

 The chief minister met Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Friday to push for the New Year truce with the Ulfa. We want direct talks (between Delhi and the Ulfa leadership) soon, he said in the capital. Only direct talks can give results.

 Gogois hour-long meeting with the Prime Minister on the issue came more than two months after Delhi indicated its willingness to start negotiations with the militant group.

 The chief minister is understood to have extracted an assurance from Singh that the peace process would be expedited to give the ruling party enough ammunition for its election campaign. Assembly elections are due in Assam in April.

 A few days before Gogoi met the Prime Minister, Dispur had made a case for diplomatic pressure on Thimphu to provide information on four of the militant leaders missing since Operation All Clear by the Royal Bhutan Army two years ago.

 A highly-placed source in Dispur said the chief minister was taking a personal interest in resolving the issue because the Ulfa has been asking for information on the fate of these leaders.

 The Peoples Consultative Group, which met in Guwahati recently to fix the agenda for the next round of talks with Delhi, is planning to seek a white paper from Delhi on the fate of the leaders. 

 Holding out hope for the success of the peace process, the chief minister said the improvement in law and order had enabled his government to focus on development and social welfare. 

 Gogoi said Dispur would build flats for third and fourth-grade government employees in Guwahati and other district headquarters. He also announced Rs 500 each as festival allowance for Id and Magh Bihu for fourth-grade staff.

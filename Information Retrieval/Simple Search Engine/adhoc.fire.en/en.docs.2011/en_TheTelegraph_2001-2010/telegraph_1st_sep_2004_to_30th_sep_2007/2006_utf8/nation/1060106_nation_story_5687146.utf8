 Cigar pose notice to Bachchan 

 Panaji, Jan. 5 (PTI): An anti-tobacco group has accused Amitabh Bachchan of violating the Cigarettes and other Tobacco Products Act, 2003, by appearing in an ad that shows the superstar smoking a cigar.

 The National Organisation for Tobacco Eradication (Note) has also served a legal notice on him. The notice, Note secretary Shekhar Salkar said, has given the actor eight days to reply.

 Salkar said Note has taken strong objection to a hoarding, displayed along the national highway near Panaji, which advertises the yet-to-be released movie Family. Bachchan is shown putting a cigar in his mouth, the secretary added.

 The hoarding, noticed on December 25, was taken off on January 1 following Notes advertisements in local newspapers that it violated the Cigarettes and other Tobacco Products Act, Salkar said. 

 He also said such hoardings are banned under the Goa Prohibition of Smoking and Spitting Act, 1997. 

 I know Amitabh as a non-smoker and his act of posing with a cigar in hand will influence a lot of people who will opt for smoking, the Note secretary added.

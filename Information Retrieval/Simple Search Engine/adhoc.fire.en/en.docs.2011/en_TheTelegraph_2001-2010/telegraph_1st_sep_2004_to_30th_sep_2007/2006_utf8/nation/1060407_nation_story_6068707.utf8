 Doordarshan nets Cup goal 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, April 6: ESPN-STAR Sports, which bagged the exclusive rights to telecast Fifa World Cup Football from Germany, has now agreed to let the semi-final and the final be shown on Doordarshan as well.

 A Prasar Bharati spokesman confirmed that it had reached an agreement with the private channel. 

 For most of the World Cup month, beginning June 9, viewers in India will get to see the matches only if their television set gets ESPN-Star Sports. But for the semi-finals and the final match of the event, Doordarshan will share the live footage with ESPN-STAR Sports. 

 The money which Doordarshan makes from advertisements sold on these days will be shared with ESPN. The private channel will get 75 per cent of that revenue, and Doordarshan 25. Doordarshan will decide how it markets the limited footage it broadcasts.

 The agreement comes after reports that ESPN-STAR Sports was being arm-twisted into the deal. The sports channel had won the World Cup telecast rights for India and other South Asian countries.

 The reports suggested that the information and broadcasting ministry was all set to invoke a clause under which a private channel has to share live footage with Doordarshan of any sporting event which is of national importance.

 Cricket matches in which India plays fall under this category, but the ministry is yet to finalise the list of such events.

 According to some reports, Prasar Bharati had earlier been pressing ESPN-STAR Sports to let the public broadcaster telecast all quarter final matches as well. But both Prasar Bharati and ESPN have chosen not to comment on the issue.

 Apart from raking in huge revenue the World Cup telecast will bring, ESPN hopes to build up its viewership in the region through the event. It says up to 100 million Indians could watch this World Cup. 

 ESPN has already announced a panel of commentators, including former Irish international Gerry Armstrong, Steve McMohan who played for England.

 Cong looks for Nagma touch 

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Nagma

Bhopal, Oct. 7: If its not Varun, it might be Nagma Vidisha could yet get its brush with glamour.

 Ending much speculation, the BJP has decided not to field its own Gandhi scion from the Lok Sabha seat the party has lost only once since 1971 in 1984, when Indira Gandhis assassination caused a sympathy wave for the Congress. 

 But if Madhya Pradesh Congress unit chief Subhash Yadav has his way, actress Nagma could be his partys surprise nominee. 

 I am going to Delhi tomorrow to meet her, Yadav said. Nagma had approached him, he said. I have sent her name to Sonia Gandhi in the list of probables.

 If she does get the ticket, the southern star could find herself pitted against the sadhvi expelled BJP leader Uma Bharti is said to be thinking of joining the fray.

 Yadav is going gaga about the Tamil-Hindi-Bhojpuri heroine who has a knack for being in the news for the wrong reasons. First, it was her association with Sourav Ganguly that was talked about. Then the allegation of her connection with the underworld caused acute embarrassment to her well-wishers in the Congress Ghulam Nabi Azad and Ambika Soni. The charge, however, remains unsubstantiated. 

 The Madhya Pradesh Congress chief sees Nagma as a godsend after at least a dozen senior and local leaders declined his offer to contest the Vidisha bypoll this month. Former chief minister Digvijay Singh, Union minister of state Suresh Pachauri and Madhviraje, the widow of Madhavrao Scindia, are among them. 

 Born on Christmas day, Namratha Sadhana rechristened herself Nagma before making her debut in Baaghi opposite Salman Khan. The film was a hit but Nagma later moved south to establish herself as a star. Of late, she has been seen in Bhojpuri cinema. 

 In between running around trees, Nagma says she manages to take time off to work with Child Relief and You (CRY) and handicapped children. This has really discovered a different side to me which I did not know existed. If I have a good name, I should put it to good use. Each of us has been gifted uniquely by God, and should use it to good capacity, she said in a recent interview. 

 The sultry star has also turned to spirituality, offering Art of Living courses.

 Between 2003 and 2005, Nagma was frequently spotted at the Congress headquarters at 24 Akbar Road and has often said she would like to contest the Lok Sabha election. She is not interested in a Rajya Sabha seat though, saying: I am too young for it. 

 A political novice, Nagma is all praise for party chief Sonia Gandhi

 Last year, Nagma had even approached a film director offering to play the role of Sonia. The amused director advised her to check out a good gym in Mumbai or Chennai.

 Cong slams BJP on blasts

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 11: The Congress has gone on the offensive against the BJP for communalising the Varanasi blasts and appealed to all progressive, secular and nationalist forces to rise against this crude and vulgar attempt.

 A meeting of the Congress Working Committee this evening, presided over by Sonia Gandhi, also stamped its approval on the US nuclear deal. 

 The CWC expressed the fear that the BJPs twin yatras could lead to communal frenzy, going by past record. The Opposition party had announced after Tuesdays blasts that L.K. Advani and Rajnath Singh will lead yatras to highlight the UPA governments minorityism.

 There was no reason for the BJP to make this terrorist attack a plea to communalise the whole issue, the CWC statement said, pointing out that when the A.B. Vajpayee government was in power, militants had struck at the Akshardham and Raghunath temples. 

 Neither the Congress nor its allies had then tried to politicise the incidents, it said. But the BJP has a different standard of public behaviour.

 The Prime Minister today briefed the CWC on the nuclear agreement, announced during his visit to the US in July 2005 and sealed during President George W. Bushs trip to India this month. 

 The Manmohan Singh government is thought to have, by and large, carried the political establishment with it on the deal ? barring perhaps the Left, which has voiced misgivings. But without the formal endorsement of the apex decision making body of the Congress, the consensus-building exercise would have been seen as incomplete.

 Union minister Arjun Singh was present at the meeting although he is unwell and has not been attending office or Parliament. 

 Party sources said his presence was significant because when the agreement was announced, he was the first to question it in a CWC meeting held a day before the Prime Minister made his statement in the House. Other members joined in, turning the meeting into a dress rehearsal for the next days House proceedings.

 Today, too, members sought clarifications, vis-?-vis misgivings of the minorities who had protested against Bushs visit and slammed the deal as a quid pro quo for backing the US on Iran. 

 But every Congress MP who spoke on the Bush visit today during discussions in Parliament, hailed the agreement as historic.

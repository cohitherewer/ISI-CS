 Sole power

 New Delhi, Oct.10: The Indian armed forces are evolving a common defence doctrine that acknowledges that the US is the sole super power. 

 Without being explicit, the armed forces also envisage scenarios in which Indias security interests are dovetailed into the US-led global war on terrorism.

 The chief of naval staff, Admiral Arun Prakash, said there is no common doctrine yet on out of area operations because there is a hesitation to put beliefs down in writing. 

 However, the government has made it clear that strategic meaning long-reach capabilities capacity building is a priority area for the military.

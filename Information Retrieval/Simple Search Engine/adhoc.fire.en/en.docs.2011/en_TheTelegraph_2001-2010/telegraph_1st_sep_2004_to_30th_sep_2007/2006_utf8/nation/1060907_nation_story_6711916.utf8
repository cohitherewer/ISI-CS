 Jharkhand or Joshi, BJP jinx stays

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 6: The BJP has been left with a feeling of dj vu as the prospect of losing Jharkhand threatens to cast a shadow over its national executive meeting, which starts tomorrow.

 A senior leader was vexed that the convention, where the BJP is supposed to discuss and spell out its vision and strategy, was again likely to be dominated by an unforeseen event.

 Serious discussions always get overshadowed by extraneous factors, he grumbled. Last time it was the Sanjay Joshi CD that hijacked our agenda. This time its Arjun Mundas fate.

 No wonder that senior BJP leaders looked downcast as they sat huddled at A.B. Vajpayees home last evening.

 Adding to the setback in Ranchi, the partys most faithful allies the Akalis have begun flexing their muscle ahead of the Punjab polls. An unexpected blow from the Akali-dominated Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee has taken the bottom out of the partys Vande Mataram campaign.

 There wasnt even Pramod Mahajans bustle and hearty chatter to lift the gloom as party leaders met yesterday to discuss the convention.

 The Vande Mataram campaign has been derailed by yesterdays SGPC declaration that the song would not be sung at its schools in Punjab tomorrow. The BJP got the Sikh body to rethink today, but the damage has been done.

 The national executive will not pass a resolution on the song. Party chief Rajnath Singh will merely refer to it in his inaugural speech. There will be no separate political resolution either, with the BJP adopting Rajnaths speech as its political agenda.

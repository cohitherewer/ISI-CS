 Rail network for Northeast

 NISHIT DHOLABHAI

 New Delhi, Oct. 27: Just as South Asia will be connected to the subcontinent and the Pacific, the Northeast will be connected with the rest of the country through the Trans-Asian Railway Network that will be part-reality next month when an agreement will be signed among member countries.

 India will be represented by a delegation led by road and surface transport minister T.R. Baalu at a meeting in Busan, South Korea, where many of the 28 countries that are part of the network, will participate.

 Indian Railways has fulfilled its commitment of connecting the Northeast, the missing link, with the rest of Southeast Asia through a 180-km network connecting Jiribam-Imphal-Moreh in Manipur. Work on 97 km has begun in some stretches. The cost is Rs 2,900 crore.

 India is now pushing Myanmar to speed up work on its missing link on Tamu (Moreh)-Kalay-Segyi stretch. Bangladesh is being convinced by India to go ahead with granting trade access. 

 Work on a rail track has begun from Dhaka towards Bengal, sources said. There is a rail network from Assam till Dharamnagar in Tripura and there will be a double line network from Delhi to Guwahati soon.

 We will soon have railway network on both sides of the river Brahmaputra, said Shri Prakash, advisor (infrastructure) to the Railway Board.

 Prakash said with a rail network in place and a Trans-Asia road network agreement already signed, Northeast could become a corridor for container traffic. Sea routes may then be limited to being sea bridges only. 

 Under the framework of the Asian Land Transport Infrastructure Development project adopted by the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP) in 1992, the commission, in collaboration with its member countries, identified the railway network through a series of corridor studies carried out over 1996-2001. 

 The network now comprises about 81,000 km of rail routes of international importance serving 28 UNESCAP members over four corridors.

 India is part of the 22,600 km South Asia, plus Islamic Republic of Iran and Turkey corridor along with Bangladesh, Iran, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Turkey. 

 The South-East Asia stretch will include Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

 While the railways is the technical body involved in execution of the plan in India and perhaps help neighbours, the ministry of commerce and industry is the coordinator between the railways, neighbouring countries and the UNESCAP. Minister of state for commerce Jairam Ramesh has been holding talks with Bangladesh for granting of trade access corridor for connectivity to the Northeast.

 That done, the dependence on Chickens Neck, the thin strip of land connecting the subcontinent with the Northeast, will decrease.

 There are, however, a word of caution on what pace and how seriously, the country follows this plan.

 India needs to hurry up as China has on the one side come till Tibet and elsewhere it will soon connect Europe through Russia also, said a senior official. In that case, trade might be diverted through the northern corridor which has China, South Korea and North Korea, Mongolia and the Russian Federation.

 If Southeast Asia-China link is put in place faster by countries in those corridors, trade from Southeast Asia may divert through the northern corridor instead of taking the pain to pass through India.

 Mumbai, May 31: Civic officials face fell today as they learnt the monsoon was expected to arrive in Mumbai on Thursday, six days ahead of schedule.

 We were told the monsoon wouldnt be here before June 8 and we had set a June 5 deadline for ourselves, said a worried municipal official as he and his colleagues scrambled to put in place a raft of anti-flood measures. But now this news has got us all tensed up.

 Mumbai has been scarred by the horror of last July 26 when a cloudburst triggered a deluge that claimed about 500 lives in the city and left millions marooned. The state government and municipal corporation have promised better drainage this time but the weather office announcement left them alarmed.

 It seems now that the monsoon will be here earlier than we predicted, the director of the meteorological department, Mumbai, Sati Devi, said. It has been nearly two days since the southwest monsoon clouds reached the Konkan coast. They will reach Mumbai within the next 48 hours.

 Till then, the city will be pounded by pre-monsoon rain, the weather office has already forecast.

 Heavy showers continued intermittently through the day today, flooding streets and disrupting rush-hour traffic. Three persons were injured by lightning and another three in a wall collapse as strong winds uprooted trees and knocked out power at many places.

 Municipal commissioner Johnny Joseph said pumps were being provided to all localities. The distribution of pumps will be completed soon, so we can handle water-logging better, he said.

 This news of an early arrival of monsoon has put some added pressure on us, but we will work on a war-footing and complete all targeted work within the next 48 hours.

 Devi didnt hazard a guess on whether the rain this season would be heavy.

 However, the monsoon, which arrived in Kerala on May 26 ? again six days earlier than predicted ? has left a trail of devastation in the southwestern state, damaging houses and crops, flooding large areas and killing 11 people. Twenty-two fishermen are missing at sea.

 Heavy rain has forced flooding and large-scale evacuations in Goa and hit train services in Maharashtras Konkan coast.

 In Mumbai, high sea waves claimed an employee of the Royal Bombay Ad Club near the Gateway of India today.

 Three of our waiters had gone to swim after duty hours. One decided against it because it was high tide but the other two went ahead, said club secretary Brigadier A. Bose. Both were swept away by the waves.

 Vishal Thambe, 25, was rescued but Mohan Yadhav, 22, wasnt so lucky.

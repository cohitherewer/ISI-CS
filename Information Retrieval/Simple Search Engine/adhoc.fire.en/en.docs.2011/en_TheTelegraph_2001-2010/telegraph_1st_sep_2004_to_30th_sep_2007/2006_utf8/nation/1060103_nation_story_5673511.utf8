 Human face gets Singh touch-up

 Singh: Striking a balance

 New Delhi, Jan. 2: The Prime Minister today declared the election year of 2006 as the year of implementation, pledging to make the pro-poor programmes launched so far count on the ground.

 Hinting at largescale investments in rural India, he spelt out the slogans for his government this year: Bharat Nirman (nation-building) and rozgar badhao (raise earnings).

 Powerful lobbies in the Congress believe that the government has failed to strike the desired balance between pursuing economic reforms and pushing the partys social agenda. This is why, they feel, the Left so often goes on the offensive ? a luxury they themselves cant afford as they are members of a coalition that runs the government.

 But with a slew of state elections coming up, in which the Congress and its alliance have huge stakes, the government needs to correct its image right away, party sources said.

 They felt that by the time the Congress plenary meeting gets under way in Hyderabad on January 21, the Centre should already have projected its human face more strongly than its market-friendly one.

 Manmohan Singh today met senior officials of the Prime Ministers Office to check out how well the promises made in the common minimum programme had been put into effect and to outline the priorities for 2006.

 The meeting divided the governments social sector projects under two broad headings ? Bharat Nirman and rozgar badhao ? and put others like the Sarva Siksha Abhiyan and mid-day meals under their ambit.

 While these will take care of the human face bit, the second part of Singhs agenda for the year will focus on investment and infrastructure.

 The meeting decided that infrastructure ? especially power, coal, roads, railways and airports ? should be a thrust area, the Prime Ministers media adviser, Sanjaya Baru, said in a press release.

 The government will also pursue new initiatives to increase investments, especially labour intensive investments. Three areas have been identified for this: agriculture, manufacturing and the services sector.

 Every three months, the Centre will assess how each project was progressing. 

 Among the key programmes to be watched closely will be Bharat Nirman, the rural job guarantee act, the national rural health mission and the urban renewal mission.

 Now, a life-saving walking stick 

 ANIL BUDUR LULLA

 The stick can identify life underneath rubble

 Bangalore, March 8: Its a walking stick which can hear ? and it can save lives, too.

 The Naval Physical and Oceanographic Laboratory, a wing of the Defence Research and Development Organisation, has come out with a Sonar-based stick that can pick up sounds and help rescue earthquake victims trapped under tonnes of debris.

 Shaped like an inverted walking stick, it can differentiate sounds that are generally too faint for the human ear or might elude sniffer dogs. 

 When probed into a mound of rubble, the stick can pick up faint sounds like moaning and identify life underneath the concrete, V. Chander, the director of the lab in Kochi, Kerala, told The Telegraph.

 This is a very cheap technology that any district magistrates office can stock. It can help save lives, especially within an hour or so of a quake.

 Called Sanjivini, the stick had a test run after the recent Kashmir quake and helped save many lives, Chander added.

 The sticks have at their base a hydrophone, a device to detect sound waves in water. Persons handling the sticks can pick up sounds from underneath the rubble through a wire connected to an electronic kit around their waist.

 The stick is also portable in the sense that all its working parts can be detached or assembled within a few minutes. It is also self-powered and requires just two batteries which are sold in any petty shop, Chander said.

 The Sonar ? sound navigation and ranging ? based device is a direct spin-off of years of research at the lab which helps ships far out at sea to listen and detect the movement of other vessels, though it is the fish shoal finder that is among the labs more successful inventions.

 The Kerala Electronics Corporation Limited is now manufacturing the shoal finder under licence.

 The lab, which has so far produced 100 pieces of the Sonar-based stick, is looking for a private manufacturer. It is yet to fix the price, but says it is a cheap solution.

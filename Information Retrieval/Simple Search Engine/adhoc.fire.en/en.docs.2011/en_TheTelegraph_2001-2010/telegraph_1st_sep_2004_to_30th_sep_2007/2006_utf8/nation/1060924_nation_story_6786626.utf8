 Mumbai, Sept. 23: Congress MP and actor Govindas nephew Janvendra Ahuja was today arrested with three friends for allegedly molesting the wife of a ministers personal secretary on a Mumbai street.

 Janvendra was expected to direct Jaan-e-Jigar, a film produced by actor-politician Shatrughan Sinhas brother Lakhan. One of the others, Bilal Khan, is an ad film-maker.

 Seema Chincholikar had told Juhu police that four youths moving in a Chevrolet had molested her and beaten up her husband Dayanand, who works for state food minister Sunil Tatkare of the Nationalist Congress Party.

 She said the couple and their friends Rahul and Ela Patil had been at JW Mariott hotel on Wednesday night to celebrate her birthday. They later decided to eat pav bhaji for dinner at Amar Juice Centre in Juhu but found it closed. They were asking passers-by where they could find another fast food stall when the Chevrolet pulled up near them.

 A plumpish man came towards me and began misbehaving. He asked, Do you know who I am? When my husband intervened, they started beating him. He was bleeding badly. I took him to Nanavati hospital, Seema said. Dayanand suffered minor injuries to his ear, face and eyes.

 Seema did not know who the plumpish man was but remembered the cars number: MH-01-MA-1881. 

 The police traced it to the house of Govindas brother Kirti Kumar and arrested Janvendra. He, Bilal, electronics shop-owner Purab Mehta and trader Gaurav Bhagal have been remanded in police custody till September 27.

 Asked if they had been drunk, senior inspector P.D. Shinde said: We dont know because we arrested them 24 hours after the incident.

 Govinda, reported to be in Bangkok for a film shoot, was not available for comment. 

 But Kirti claimed it was a conspiracy to malign the family and told a channel he would seek Congress chief Sonia Gandhis intervention. Later, however, he clammed up on the subject of contacting Sonia.

 Our family has been in the film industry for 20 years, but no one ever pointed a finger at us. All this is happening because of politics, he said.

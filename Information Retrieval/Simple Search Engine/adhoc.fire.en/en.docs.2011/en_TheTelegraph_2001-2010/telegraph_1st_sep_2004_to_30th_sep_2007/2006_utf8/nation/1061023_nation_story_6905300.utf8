The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Bells, yes, but marriage...

 OUR BUREAU

 Oct. 22: Its that 

 time of the year again when Liz Hurley and Arun Nayar (in 

 picture) have Udaipur and elephants and camels on 

 their mind. And possibly marriage, too.

 The British actress-turned-beachwear designer will marry the NRI textiles scion in February at the 18th-century Devigarh Fort Palace in Udaipur, British newspaper The Observer claimed today.

 Rumours of an imminent wedding had kept the media agog last November, too, when the couple landed up at Udaipur with friends and relatives amid indications that a huge celebration was in the offing.

 In the end, the big party turned out to be just a birthday bash for Nayar.

 This time, from the looks of it, the wedding could really happen. The lady herself has sought to make it official.

 I cannot reveal to you the exact date but it is very close. We are even thinking of having a child, Hurley, 41, has been quoted as saying by Vanity Fair magazines Italian edition.

 As a quick warm-up, a pre-wedding jamboree is scheduled for November 9 at Devigarh, one of the worlds leading boutique hotels. It was at the palaces poolside that Arun had proposed to Liz on November 4 last year, The Observer said.

 But the Indian wedding will be preceded by a civil marriage in England. The small family affair is set to take place soon at Gloucestershires Barnsley Hotel near Hurleys London home.

 The bride has ordered 13 designer gowns for the two weddings, the second of which will be a traditional Punjabi affair with the turbaned groom arriving on a white horse with other male members of his family on camels and elephants.

 The guest list includes Sir Elton John and his partner David Furnish, David Beckham and wife Victoria, Pamela Anderson as well as Hurleys ex-boyfriend Hugh Grant and his partner Jemima Khan, the newspaper said. They will check into the nearby Udaipur Lake Palace, the setting for the James Bond movie Octopussy.

 Loan rap on bank 

 New Delhi, Aug. 20 (PTI): A consumer court has ruled that finance companies cannot recover an entire loan amount from defaulters after forcibly taking possession of their vehicles.

 The loan-advancing bank cannot be allowed to take undue advantage and eat both ends of the cake by retaining the amount paid by consumers towards the cost of their cars, as well as seek recovery of unpaid instalments by taking back the vehicle, said the Delhi state consumer disputes redressal commission.

 Sureka Coated Tubes and Sheets Limited alleged that its car was forcibly taken away by an agent of Citibank. 

 Acting on its complaint, the commission bench headed by Justice J.D. Kapoor and member Rumnitta Mittal asked the bank to adjust the unpaid amount as it had already sold the vehicle.

 It also asked the bank to return to the complainant all the cheques issued subsequent to repossession of the vehicle, against which the loan was taken.

 The company had applied for a loan on October 5, 1990, with Citibank for purchasing a premier Padmini car and was sanctioned Rs 97,243. It paid 46 EMIS before defaulting. 

 Almost four years after the purchase, the bank, with the help of its agent Northern India Credit Factor Limited, took away the car and demanded that the balance amount be settled, forcing SCTSL to seek redressal in the commission.

 The court held the bank and its agent guilty of deficiency in services.

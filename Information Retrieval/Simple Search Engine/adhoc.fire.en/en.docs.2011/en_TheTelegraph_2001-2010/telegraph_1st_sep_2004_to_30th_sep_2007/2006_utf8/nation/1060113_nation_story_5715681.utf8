 Heat loss in tapping row

 New Delhi (PTI): After the sound and 

 fury over phone tapping, the Samajwadi Party seems to have 

 softened towards the Centre.

 The sweetener was administered not by Mulayam Singh Yadav or Amar Singh but Janeshwar Mishra, a Lohiaite and veteran Rajya Sabha MP who was brought in to control the damage done by the two-week campaign against the government and Congress chief Sonia Gandhi.

 Mishra, who addressed a news conference on , said the Samajwadi Party is not withdrawing support to the UPA government. He also refused to blame Sonia and the Prime Minister for the alleged phone tapping. I will not blame Sonia Gandhi or the PM until I have concrete proof against them. But I would like to tell them to stop this, or else it will have far-reaching consequences. 

 Sources said the reasons for the climbdown in 

 the anti-Congress offensive were:

 Indications from the Left that it would not back any move to withdraw support on a personal issue 

 No assurance of support from ally Ajit Singh 

 Churning within the party. Mulayams family is against going the whole hog to bail out Amar in the tapping case With a year left for the Uttar Pradesh elections, the party also feels it is time Mulayam goes back to his roots as a Lohiaite. The attempt to reach out to Mishra is in keeping with this strategy 

 The realisation that there is little point battling the Centre when Mulayam and his family are facing a disproportionate wealth case and have to reply to a Supreme Court notice.

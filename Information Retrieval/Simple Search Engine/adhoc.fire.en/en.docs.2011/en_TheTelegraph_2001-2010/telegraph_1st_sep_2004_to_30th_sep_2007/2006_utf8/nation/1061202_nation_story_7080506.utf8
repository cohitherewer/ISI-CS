 Black law hope rides on PM trip

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi, Dec. 1: During his daylong tour of Manipur tomorrow, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh may announce changes to a black law that most people in the state see as a symbol of oppression.

 The Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, in force only in certain northeastern states, gives troops extraordinary powers to detain, question and even shoot at anyone they suspect to be a militant.

 A highly placed source in Delhi 

 said the Prime Minister might even offer to drop the act 

 from the statute book if peace returns to the 

 Northeast.

 A central panel headed by a judge is believed to have recommended scrapping the law, introduced to fight militancy but blamed for most rights abuses in Manipur, Nagaland and parts of some other northeastern states.

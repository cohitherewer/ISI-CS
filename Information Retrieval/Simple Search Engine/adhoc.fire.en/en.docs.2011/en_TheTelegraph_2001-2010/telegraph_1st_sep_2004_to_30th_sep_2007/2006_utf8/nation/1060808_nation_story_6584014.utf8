 Kurien friend at IRMA helm

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Ahmedabad, Aug. 7: Economist and former Jawaharlal Nehru University vice-chancellor Y.K. Alagh has been named the new chairman of the Institute of Rural Management in Anand.

 The institutes board of governors today unanimously selected Alagh after a three-member search committee, headed by Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, director Bakul Dholakia, recommended three names for the post, held by Verghese Kurien since IRMA was set up in 1979.

 Alagh was a unanimous choice, said IRMA acting director Neelima Khetan.

 Amrita Patel, Kuriens protg-turned-rival, had been interim chairperson since the June change of guard that saw Kuriens exit from IRMA.

 Alaghs choice has surprised even Kurien loyalists, some of whom have been shown the door since the milkman of India was forced to step down. Alagh is believed to have an excellent rapport with Kurien.

 Khetan said Alagh is a very good replacement for Kurien, though the two cannot be compared. The new chairman, she added, is experienced, has been a minister for planning and programme implementation and is likely to bring value to the institute.

 The board also accepted the resignations of two senior professors from the governing body. The two, who had been nominated by Kurien, have already resigned from IRMA along with three others believed to be Kurien loyalists.

 The five professors put in their papers after one of the board members called them to say they should leave the institute. Those who resigned are Vishwa Ballabh, H. Panda, Smitha Panda, L.K. Vaswani and S.B. Biswas.

 The acting director claimed the resignations would not affect the institutes academic programme as they have been on notice period for three months. Their resignations will not create a vacuum of experienced faculty, Khetan said.

 She expressed hope that the institute will be able to fill the vacancies within three months. If not, it would hire visiting teachers.

 Khetan, who was appointed acting director after Vaswani was sacked, also made it clear that she is not interested to continue in the post.

 She said applications have been invited and a new director is expected to be appointed soon.

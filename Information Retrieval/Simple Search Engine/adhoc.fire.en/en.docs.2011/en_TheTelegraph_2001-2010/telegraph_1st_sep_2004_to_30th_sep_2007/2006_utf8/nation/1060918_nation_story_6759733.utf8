 Fish that killed Irwin is Mumbai staple

 - Demand for stingray shoots up in Colaba

 SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI

 Mumbai, Sept. 17: At Colabas famous wholesale fish market, no one has heard of Steve Irwin, televisions favourite Crocodile Hunter who was killed by a stingray.

 The local fisherfolk, Kolis, would have said a silent prayer for the pop-environmentalist had they known he died after being pierced by the poison barb on a stingrays tail.

 All they know is that suddenly, there is an unusual demand for the once-popular but now rarely available fish, which is a part of the traditional Koli fare so popular at Mumbais street seafood joints.

 A medium-sized to large fresh fish usually sells at around Rs 250 to Rs 300, but for the last few days the price has been hovering around Rs 450 to Rs 500. Lots of customers have been asking for it and we have had to disappoint most because its not so easily available these days, says Saraswati Worlikar, a fish-seller who stocks stingrays.

 The supply is better during the monsoon, she adds.

 The fish is locally known as pakhad or kite fish because of its shape.

 As a large fish is tough to keep for a long time, it is generally available in a dried form. If you want the fresh fish, you must place your order well in advance. A large fish stays with us for at least a couple of months, says Bhawani Pendelnath at Mahim fish market at the other end of the city. We dry it out by rubbing it with salt and it keeps for four to five months. A customer usually wants half a big fish.

 Earlier, it used to be a delicacy for special occasions. Its certainly not daily fare. Besides, cooking the pakhad is quite an effort. But local people still come looking for it at times, says Raman, an 82-year-old seller in Colaba.

 Originally a fishermens village, Colaba has many street seafood joints with the pakhad on the menu.

 It is only the elderly who ask for pakhad. Sometimes, they bring foreign guests. Its a connoisseurs choice, says Arjun Kainke, whose eatery, Public Hotel, in the Fort area has been serving the fish for the last 34 years.

 A dish of rice or chapati with grated pakhad will cost you Rs 50. The eatery, a favourite with Marathi stage artistes, has two more pakhad dishes on the menu.

 We have been selling a lot of pakhad of late, says Kainke.

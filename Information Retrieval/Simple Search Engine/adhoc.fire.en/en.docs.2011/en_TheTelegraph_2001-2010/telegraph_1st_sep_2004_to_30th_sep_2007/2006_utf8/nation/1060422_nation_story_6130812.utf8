 Oops! Ash falls again

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Bangalore, April 21: Aishwarya Rai fell off a bicycle this morning but was quickly up on her feet, helped by Abhishek Bachchan.

 Rehearsing for a shot for Mani Ratnams Guru, the actress in a ghagra crashed into a no-parking sign and onto the ground, bruising her pretty hands and scraping a leg ? it wasnt known if it was the same one that had Vivek Oberoi spend a sleepless night three years ago.

 Then, Vivek had rushed to Mumbai airport to receive Aishwarya (in picture) as she was brought by helicopter after hurting the small toe on her left foot during shooting. He spent the night in hospital.

 Vivek could have been at her side in the historical town of Badami, too ? he was part of the initial cast of Guru. His exit from the film came amid talk of his break-up with the beauty queen ? though the relationship was never acknowledged ? and of her link-up with Abhishek. The junior Bachchan, her love interest in Guru, is said to have danced only with Aishwarya on his 30th birthday recently.

 Shooting for the song stopped as Aishwarya went to see a doctor in the town 550 km from Bangalore that is famous for its rock-cut cave temples, but resumed a few hours later.

 Even before the song and dance today, the shooting of the film set against the first war of independence was a big draw with residents and visitors to the town that was once the capital of the Chalukyas. 

 Wedding scenes were shot on Tuesday and Wednesday, and yesterday, Aishwarya was cycling between takes, to the delight of stargazers. 

 They might have more to see once Mani Ratnams wish for a steam engine and five freight cars is granted. Railway officials said steam engine will have to travel all the way from the National Rail Museum, New Delhi.

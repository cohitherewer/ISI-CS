 Janata cousins close ranks

 DHIRENDRA K. JHA

 New Delhi, June 19: The three Janata Dals ? leading coalition governments with the BJP in three states ? want to be one, or at least coordinate among themselves away from their ally so that they can play a bigger role at the national level.

 The Janata Dal (United), Janata Dal (Secular) and Biju Janata Dal (BJD) ? in power in Bihar, Karnataka and Orissa, respectively ? have begun their unity meetings. 

 They JD (U) and the JD (S) have held two rounds of talks at the top-level in the past one month. The BJD joined them at the table recently and is yet to involve senior leaders.

 A merger ? or even a close coordination ? of the Janata Dals not only threatens the BJPs grip over regional allies, it could also throw up a separate political grouping.

 The JD (S) had split from the JD (U) in 2003 after the latter decided to join hands with the Samata Party and become a part of the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance. 

 Samata president George Fernandes became the JD (U) head and his predecessor Sharad Yadav was made the leader of the partys parliamentary board.

 Sources said soon after he got back the crown, Sharad put forward the unity proposal and started sending feelers to his counterpart in the JD (S), H.D. Deve Gowda. The two met on May 23 and on June 11.

 Although the meetings did not take the proposal much further, the sources said they helped build a rapport between the two leaders, who resolved to work for a Janata parivar.

 The JD (U) leadership had been toying with the idea of starting a unity dialogue in Karnataka after a majority of JD (S) MLAs decided to shed their communal inhibitions and tie up with the BJP to form a government in the state.

 Leaders of the BJD, which has only recently entered the loop, are meeting their JD (U) counterparts, the sources said, adding that three-way talks would begin after the ongoing dialogue between Sharad and Gowda moves forward.

 Trai watch on CAS roll-out progress

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 30: The telecom regulator will now breathe down the necks of major cable operators, to make sure they comply with the year-end deadline to implement CAS.

 The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai), which also doubles as the broadcast regulator, has ordered multi-system operators (MSOs) to file a report every fortnight on the progress on the roll-out of the conditional access system (CAS).

 CAS has to be implemented in notified areas of Delhi, Calcutta and Mumbai by December 31. The system, under which households get their TV signal through a set-top box, is already there in Chennai.

 Trais latest order said the MSOs the larger cable companies that in turn distribute the TV signal to neighbourhood cable operators must file the first of their progress reports for the fortnight ending October 15.

 After a Delhi High Court order specifying December 31 as the CAS-implementation deadline, Trai has been nudging the operators on.

 It has already come out with a maximum retail price which viewers will pay per channel in CAS areas. Another notification mandated that the big cable operators must begin a month-long awareness campaign on CAS.

 But there can still be hitches that delay implementation. For example, the MSOs have to sign interconnection agreements with smaller cable operators on sharing revenues.

 A fortnightly progress report will help keep tabs, ensuring that the CAS roll-out is on course.

 Trai has come out with a standard interconnection agreement on how the revenue should be shared between broadcasters, MSOs and cable operators. This is to ensure that the implementation of CAS does not get delayed if negotiations fail.

 BJP throws Havana barbs

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 23: The BJP today accused the Prime Minister of signing the Havana joint statement with Pakistan without consulting the security agencies and demanded he explain the shift in Delhis approach towards Islamabad and terrorism.

 There is tremendous unease in the security establishment at the joint statement and the proposed joint mechanism on terrorism between India and Pakistan, BJP spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad claimed.

 We wish to know whether the PM consulted the security and intelligence agencies before signing the joint statement, he said.

 The BJP has termed Manmohan Singhs recent assertion that Pakistan, too, is a victim of terror as a para- digm shift in India-Pakistan relations.

 What has changed so drastically in recent months that India has decided to not make (a clampdown on) cross-border terrorism a prerequisite for peace talks, and the state that has been harbouring terrorism is now a partner in tackling the problem with India?

 He mentioned the Pakistan link in all the major terrorist strikes across the world in New York, London and Spain and demanded that Pakistans secret service, the ISI, be investigated for terror links. It is high time the ISI is put under serious international scrutiny. They have a vice-like grip on terror groups operating from Pakistan, Prasad said.

 The BJP leader demanded that Delhi make public the non-paper (unofficial proposals) it has allegedly handed to Islamabad, offering to scale down its control over Jammu and Kashmir.

 The contents of the non-paper have been reported widely in the Pakistani media. The BJP is particularly disturbed by the alleged mention in the paper of restoring Kashmir to its pre-1953 status, whi- ch could mean handing over all subjects except defence, foreign affairs and communications to the state government.

 Pakistan foreign minister Khursheed Mehmood Kasuri has acknowledged the non-papers existence. It has been reported that the paper could become the basis for formal discussions on Kashmir when the peace process resumes.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Faulty kit haul

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Oct. 20: Police today seized around 17,000 expired and faulty HIV, Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C test kits, which were supplied by arrested businessman Govind Sarda.

 These kits were seized from the regional blood transfusion centres in Bankura, Burdwan and Siliguri. Raids will be carried out in other districts as well, said Gyanwant Singh, the deputy commissioner of Calcutta polices detective department. 

 Sarda, who has been remanded in jail custody till October 27, had supplied thousands of such expired kits to the West Bengal AIDS Prevention and Control Society, which were later sent to blood banks and other distribution centres across Bengal. 

 The racket came to light last month when two employees of Sardas company, Monozyme India Ltd, lodged a police complaint pointing out the malpractice.

 The police had earlier raided four state-run hospitals in Calcutta and the Central Blood Bank and seized around 140,000 expired kits. The kits we have seized from the three districts are similar to those seized from the city. They have either passed their use-by dates or have been tampered with, Singh said.

 Investigations revealed that Sarda had supplied faulty kits to private blood banks and hospitals as well.

 We have got the names of some of these private hospitals and raids will be carried out soon, an officer said. 

 Thousands of people could have been affected after transfusion of blood tested with these faulty kits. Over 20,000 units of contaminated blood are believed to have escaped surveillance and have been used.

 The Telegraph had reported three cases in which patients who underwent transfusion when the city hospitals were swamped by Sardas faulty kits were infected with HIV or hepatitis viruses. 

 Considering the gravity of the case, we had been contacting all blood banks to ascertain how many people received blood tested with these kits, Singh added. 

 The police today raided Sardas Theatre Road office and seized papers relating to Monozyme India. A register, with a record of the quantity of kits the company supplied this year till August, has also been seized.

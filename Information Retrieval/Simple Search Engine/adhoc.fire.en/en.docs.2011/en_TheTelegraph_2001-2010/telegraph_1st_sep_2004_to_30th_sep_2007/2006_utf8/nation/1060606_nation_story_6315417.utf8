 Bhatt passes ball

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 4: Mahesh Bhatt today said the Supreme Courts ruling on Fanaa is not disappointing and saw it as a moral victory, but passed the baton to the films producer and star to take the battle ahead. 

 Bhatt said Yash Chopra and Aamir Khan should now urge Gujarats exhibitors to seek police protection and screen Fanaa.

 According to the filmmaker (in picture), if the two can persuade one, solitary exhibitor? then you will have a moral victory.

 Bhatt said he spoke to Aamir over phone after the court ruling and told him: It is for you guys to kick it into the goal, or stay quiet.

 This is an opportunity to take the issue to its logical conclusion and break the back of fascist forces, the filmmaker said.

 He added that it is up to the people to judge if Fanaas boycott by theatre owners is by choice, that businessmen who fight for every rupee are now willing to forgo crores of rupees just to teach Aamir a lesson.

 Cartoon minister on counter-BJP yatra

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 27: Haji Yaqoob Qureshi, the Uttar Pradesh minister who announced Rs 51 crore on the head of the Danish cartoonist for caricaturing the Prophet, has said he would lead a parallel yatra in the state to counter the twin yatras of the BJP.

 Although Qureshi, the minister for minority welfare and Haj in the Mulayam Singh Yadav government, asserted on Saturday that his roadshow would be a non-political one, sources in the Samajwadi Party claimed their outfit was very much behind the move to keep its minority votes intact till next years Assembly polls.

 Qureshis announcement has come at a time when the BJP is making final preparations for its twin yatras ? one by leader of Opposition L.K. Advani and the other by BJP president Rajnath Singh. The yatras will be flagged off on April 6 from Dwarka and Puri and will criss-cross the country with Uttar Pradesh as the focus.

 After the Varanasi blasts, observers say, the Samajwadi leaders decision to jump into yatra politics would mean difficult days ahead for the state.

 The BJPs twin shows already have the UPA in Delhi worried about law and order maintenance.

 While the BJPs National Integration Yatras are aimed at mobilising the Hindu vote bank against the alleged minority appeasement policies, Qureshis Insaniyat Yatra would keep ulemas in the forefront.

 The yatra will be non-political and be attended by a number of prominent ulemas, Muslim leaders and Islamic scholars, said Qureshi, whose sole claim to fame is his Rs 51 crore offer on the head of the Danish cartoonist.

 But he added that political leaders would not be barred from joining us.

 The Uttar Pradesh ministers march will start from Lucknow some time in April-end and pass through various parts of the state. The minister said the exact date would be finalised later.

 The stated purpose of the yatra is to spread the message of humanity and secularism. We have always been divided into religions and castes. This yatra will send the message of humanity to the common man, Qureshi said, adding that it would also counter the BJPs initiative.

 When asked whether his statement to offer Rs 51 crore on the head of the Danish cartoonist was not in contrast with the purpose of his yatra, he said: It is not. We are going to spread the message of humanity. He made it clear that he still stood by his statement on the cartoonist as he was a firm believer in Islam.

 15-day custody for rape accused 

 Bhubaneswar: Bitrihotra Mohanti, the son of a top Orissa police officer, has been remanded in 15 days judicial custody in connection with the rape of a German tourist in Alwar, reports our correspondent.

 Acquaintances of the 22-year-old management student, who was arrested on Tuesday and is said to have confessed to having sex with the woman, said they knew him to be sober, disciplined and well-behaved. 

 The victim returned to Delhi on Wednesday, accompanied by a compatriot. Alwar additional superintendent of police Ramdeo Singh said a German man had requested the police to allow him to escort her. Singh added that they would file the chargesheet after the forensic science laboratorys report is received.

 Bitrihotras father Bidya Bhusan Mohanti, who is Orissas additional director-general of police, insisted that his son was not guilty. Forget the charges of drinking liquor, he has never touched it in his life. He never even had a girlfriend, he said over phone. 

 The Institute for Integrated Learning in Management in New Delhi, where Bitrihotra is a first-year student, stonewalled questions. But the staff at Bhubaneswars Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology, from where he graduated in 2005 with a B.Tech degree in computer science, expressed shock. 

 enkat Sastry, the dean of students welfare, said: I have known him for four years and can say that he was a good boy. He was a member of the colleges disciplinary committee and even helped out during the campus placements last year. I am at a loss to understand his change in behaviour in just one year. Its a bolt from the blue.

 Administrative officials at the institute described Bitrihotra as everyones favourite. He won the best volunteer award last year, one said.

 DD lunch spread scuttled

 SINGH GYANANT KUMAR

 New Delhi, Feb. 8: The Supreme Court today barred Doordarshan from interrupting the live feed of the India-Pakistan one-dayers, provided by TEN Sports, by airing during the lunch break its own programme, Fourth Umpire.

 The court ruled that according to its January 30 order ? which elucidates the deal between the two broadcasters ? Doordarshan (DD) is bound to beam uninterrupted feed of the five matches from the beginning till the end.

 TEN officials said this meant from the toss to the match (awards) presentation.

 The apex court had earlier asked Prasar Bharti, which runs DD, to pay Rs 15 crore for the feed from the Dubai-based TEN Sports, which holds exclusive telecast rights for the current one-day series in Pakistan.

 The public broadcaster was also told not to interrupt the signals provided by TEN by inserting its own advertisements.

 TEN moved the court after DD aired Fourth Umpire during the lunch break of the first one-dayer on February 6.

 Solicitor-general G.E. Vahanvati, appearing for Prasar, told the court that the public broadcaster had not interrupted the live feed during the match but only during the lunch break.

 But the two-judge bench clarified that uninterrupted means from the beginning till the end and asked DD not to show any of its programmes till the match was over.

 Prasar CEO K.S. Sarma said: If the Supreme Court has passed the order we have to abide by it; theres no other way.

 He described the volume of ads shown by DD during the lunch break as nothing worth mentioning.

 TEN Sports managing director Sharmista Rijhwani denied that the private channel had tried to reach an out-of-court settlement yesterday. DD had violated the agreement and we had to move Supreme Court to set that right.

 Prasar officials claimed that TEN had initially had no objection to Fourth Umpire being beamed during the lunch break, but later changed its mind. But Rijhwani said TEN had only allowed DD to do away with the private sports channels Straight Drive programme, aired before and after the match.

 DD could not beam the Test matches in Pakistan live as it had failed to reach an agreement with TEN, which held exclusive telecast rights for that series, too.

 To do away with such problems, the Centre has laid down that all private sports channels holding telecast rights for any cricket match featuring India must share the live feed with Prasar. Three-fourths of the revenue Prasar generates from the event would go to the rights holder. TENs legal challenge to the provision is pending in court.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Centres turn to take next step, says Muivah

 BHARAT BHUSHAN

 Bangkok, April 8: Dont put the cart before the horse if you want to move forward, Thuingaleng Muivah, general secretary of the National Socialist Council of Nagalim (Isak-Muivah) has advised Indian political leaders dealing with the Naga issue. 

 In an interview with The Telegraph, he claimed that this was what some Indian leaders were doing by asking the Nagas to accept the Indian Constitution and the Indian Union as pre-conditions for a settlement. 

 Nearly a decade after he began peace negotiations with Delhi, the Naga leader is still waiting in the Thai capital for new initiatives from India. 

 While extending the eight-and-a-half-year-long ceasefire for another six months on January 31 this year, the two sides had recognised in a joint statement that there has been insufficient progress in the talks. They had, therefore, decided to carry the political negotiations expeditiously forward taking new initiatives. But no such thing has happened.

 All initiatives to carry the talks forward have come from us. If Indians do not honour what they say, then we will stop listening to them and walk away, the Naga leader warned. 

 Muivah said that insisting on accepting the Indian Constitution and the Indian Union was the wrong way to begin talks. He argued that after a negotiated settlement with the Nagas, both the Indian Constitution and the Indian Union would emerge stronger. 

 We do not consider ourselves a part of the Indian Union because we are not in it. We also do not accept the Indian Constitution. But once an agreement with the Nagas is incorporated in the Indian Constitution, we believe that both the Constitution and the Indian Union will emerge stronger. The Indian leaders should understand this. We dont have to explain it to them, he said with exasperation. 

 Muivah claimed that as long as India talked of the Nagas accepting the Indian Constitution before a settlement, the Nagas would never accept it. We rejected the Indian Constitution way back in 1950. Despite an invitation, the Nagas did not attend the Constituent Assembly, stating clearly that they were not a part of India, he recalled.

 Yet, he said, India must recognise that since 1950 we have taken several steps forward to come closer to it. They are bold steps and sensible Indians should be able to see that. If the Indian political leadership does not appreciate them then how can we say that it wants a solution through negotiations? he asked. 

 Having travelled a long distance from complete Independence, the NSCN (I-M) is now proposing a federal relationship with New Delhi. It will be a federation of India and Nagaland to be bound together by an agreement which would elaborate the interdependence between the two. We say interdependence because we realise that we cannot be totally on our own, Muivah explained. 

 Did this route not lead to being a part of Union of India, which allows for asymmetrical federal relationships within it (Article 370 for Jammu and Kashmir, for example, and autonomy of various kinds for special areas)? Muivah replied that he preferred to use the term federation in preference to the Union of India as the latter described the relationship between the Centre and the states of India. The background and history of these states are different from ours, he said.

 Once the terms of the negotiated settlement are incorporated in the Indian Constitution as well as in the Constitution that the Nagas will give themselves, we will recognise the Indian Constitution and India would recognise our Constitution. No unilateral changes would be permitted in the terms of the settlement either through Ordinances or Constitutional amendments, the Naga leader said.

 Muivah said: We think that this is a reasonable approach. Both sides would end up recognising each others constitutions as well as the close links binding the two documents. Indians and Nagas would become inseparable. What more could India want?

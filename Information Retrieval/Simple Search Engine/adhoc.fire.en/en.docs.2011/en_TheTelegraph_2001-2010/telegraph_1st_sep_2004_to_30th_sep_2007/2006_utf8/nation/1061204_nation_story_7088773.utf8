The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Patna professor stabbed to death

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, 

 Dec. 3: A senior teacher of Patna Womens 

 College and her domestic help were found murdered in the 

 Patliputra Colony locality of the Bihar capital today.

 Papiya Ghosh, who was a professor in the colleges postgraduate history department, and her help Malti Devi were found lying in a pool of blood when another maid, who used to work in a neighbouring house, came to Ghoshs residence for chores.

 Senior superintendent of police Kundan Krishnan told The Telegraph that no signs of forced entry were found at the spot and somebody known to the unmarried professor seemed to be part of the group that entered the house late last night.

 Robbery appears to be the motive because electronic gadgets like a television, computer, music system and jewellery are missing. The intruders drove away in a Maruti Alto that was parked at the house, Krishnan said.

 The wounds the two women bore on their bodies suggested that they were stabbed to death. 

 The second maid used to come to the professors house every morning to wash utensils. When she rang the bell today, no one responded. She informed the neighbours, who found the two women lying in a pool of blood, the police official said.

 Ghosh was in her early 50s and a known figure in academic circles. Her maid was an elderly woman. Ghoshs body was cremated after a post-mortem.

 Krishnan, who is supervising the investigation, said the intruders made use of the cover of night and relative isolation of the house.

 Ghosh was the daughter of U.K. Ghosh, a former home secretary of Bihar. Her sister Tuktuk is a Bengal cadre IAS officer. 

 Patna University teachers will go on mass casual leave tomorrow and observe a silent protest.

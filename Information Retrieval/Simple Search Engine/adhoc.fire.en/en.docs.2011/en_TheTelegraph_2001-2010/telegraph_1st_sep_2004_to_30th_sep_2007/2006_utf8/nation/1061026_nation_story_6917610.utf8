 Offshore heat on Indians in Australia

 Job war 

 Melbourne, Oct. 25 

 (PTI): Indians working in Australia-based call centres are 

 facing a tough time following adverse publicity about Australian 

 companies plans to offshore jobs to India.

 Australian customers get very angry the moment they hear an Indian accent without knowing the origin of the call, said Harmeet, a call centre employee in Melbourne. 

 They sometimes hang up saying we dont want to talk to someone from India. They abuse us and tell us we have eaten up their jobs.

 They dont believe that we are based in Australia, said another call centre employee, adding that a customer once quizzed her on local issues when she informed him she was calling from Melbourne.

 National vice-chairman of Australia-India Business Council Harish Rao admitted that Indians working in Australia-based call centres were facing a tough time. 

 I cant understand what is the issue if jobs are going to India. Its a part of globalisation and it should be accepted. Australia benefits in the two-way trade as it exports more to India he said. 

 Comparatively, China, which has most of its activity in the manufacturing arena, attracts less publicity, Rao said. 

 He said that by offshoring jobs Australian companies could get over 30 per cent cheaper labour in India. In addition, companies were unable to fill up positions, especially in the IT sector. 

 Rao said none of the Australian banks were running call centres in India and most of the jobs transferred were IT-related. 

 The debate is not so mature in the US, where there is still a lot of knee-jerk reaction to offshoring of jobs. Some states are even legislating against it for government work.

 But in the US, the IT industry supports offshoring because of increased efficiency and lower costs, he said.

 A recent media report has said that while ANZ planned to retain all its Australian call centres amid public concern about banks sending operations offshore, Qantas axed 300 IT posts in Australia and offshored them to India.

 The airline said it was impossible to find enough high-tech expertise in Australia to carry out computer systems maintenance and shortlisted two Indian companies to take over the work.

 Other banks, including St George, Westpac and National Australia Bank, are also shifting many Australian jobs overseas.

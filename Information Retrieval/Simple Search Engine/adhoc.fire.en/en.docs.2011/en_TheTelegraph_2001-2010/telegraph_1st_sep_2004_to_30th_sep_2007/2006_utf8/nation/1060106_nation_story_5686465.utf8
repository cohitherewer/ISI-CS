 Smooth start for BJP boss

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 5: The BJPs new president is settling into his chair cautiously but with a distinct show of authority.

 Talking to reporters three days after formally taking over, Rajnath Singh today discussed several crucial issues ? the situation in Uttar Pradesh, the constitution of his team of office-bearers and the possibility of alliances with Assembly polls knocking on the doors of many states, particularly Bengal and Assam.

 He hinted that there was a possibility of the BJP contesting the Assam elections in alliance with a regional party. Although sources said the party in question is Asom Gana Parishad, Rajnath refused to elaborate. He, however, stressed that the BJPs tie-up with Mamata Banerjees Trinamul Congress was as firm as ever.

 The BJP chief said he would announce the new team of office-bearers only after the national council formally endorses his appointment at a special session in Delhi on January 20. 

 Rajnath spent the last two days meeting all the senior and second-rung leaders. Hectic consultations are still on regarding new office-bearers. Party vice-president Bal Apte met senior leader Arun Jaitley late in the afternoon for almost an hour, but they refused to reveal any details.

 The BJP president met RSS joint general secretary Suresh Soni and is believed to have discussed, among other things, the appointment of new office-bearers and the BJPs national executive. 

 Rajnath also reportedly sought a whole-timer pracharak from the Sangh to replace Sanjay Joshi who quit as general secretary (organisation) after a CD showing him allegedly having sex was circulated. 

 The team of office-bearers would come into being after the inauspicious period of kharmas gets over on Makar Sankranti, which falls on January 14, Rajnath said.

 He denied that senior leaders like M. Venkaiah Naidu had opted out of the team. All this is baseless speculation.

 The new BJP boss showered praises on former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Kalyan Singh. He was one of the best chief ministers in the country. Kalyan Singhji is a popular leader with a mass base, Rajnath said. I have a very good relationship with Kalyan Singhji.

 Rajnath has asked Kalyan to take over the reins of the Nyay Yatra he had started in Uttar Pradesh to protest criminalisation of politics in the state. The BJP has also been mollycoddling Kalyan by saying he would be the partys chief ministerial candidate when Uttar Pradesh goes to polls in 2007.

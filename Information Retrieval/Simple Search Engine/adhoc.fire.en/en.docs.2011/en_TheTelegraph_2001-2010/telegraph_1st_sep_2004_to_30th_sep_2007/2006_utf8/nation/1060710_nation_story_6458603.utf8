 Land cronyism cry

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, July 9: His wealth is under the Supreme Courts scanner and his vaunted development projects have proved non-starters. Yesterdays rioting on farmland acquired for a Reliance project is just the latest in a series of political and personal blows Mulayam Singh Yadav has suffered in a pre-election year.

 The Opposition BJP as well as the Congress today blamed the flare-up on the government, accusing it of selling land cheap to industrialists close to Mulayam and his Samajwadi Party colleague Amar Singh.

 It was their anger at allegedly being short-changed that had prompted some 2,000 farmers at Dadri yesterday to try and get their plots back by tilling them. The protest resulted in injuries to at least 20 villagers as police baton-charged them and fired in the air.

 State Congress chief Salman Khursheed has appealed to governor T.V. Rajeswar for a judicial probe into the land scam in Dadri, where a power plant is to come up on 2,500 acres. The government had paid Rs 1.5 lakh an acre to the farmers, who insist that the market price should be at least Rs 3.5 lakh an acre.

 Samajwadi state secretary Ram Saran Das said: This (providing land at a subsidy) is standard practice everywhere to attract investors. We are being criticised because the state is facing a poll next year.

 Mulayams problem, however, is that his showcase projects have proved damp squibs. The Anpara-C power project in eastern Uttar Pradesh is stuck; the Roza power project in Shahjehanpur is hobbled by payment problems, and plans for power plants in Bulandshahr and Allahabad by the Tatas are stalled. 

 The three proposed special economic zones have been a let-down. The government has notified land acquisition for the Purva zone in Varanasi and the Taj zone in Agra, and has already acquired 2,700 acres for the 45,000-acre Kanpur zone. Yet, hardly any investor has approached it with proposals.

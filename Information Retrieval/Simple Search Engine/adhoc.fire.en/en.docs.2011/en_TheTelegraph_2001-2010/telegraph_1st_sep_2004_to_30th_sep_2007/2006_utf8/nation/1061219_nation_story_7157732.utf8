 Washington, Dec. 18: A new milestone in the history of global nuclear non-proliferation was laid here today when US President George W. Bush signed legislation ending a three-decade-old ban on selling nuclear reactors, nuclear fuel and nuclear technology to India.

 The bill will help keep America safe by paving the way for India to join the global effort to stop the spread of nuclear weapons, Bush said in remarks in the East Room of the White House before signing the bill into law.

 Surrounded by a phalanx of Senators, members of the House of Representatives and leaders of the Indian American community, Bush referred to India as a natural partner of the US and called Prime Minister Manmohan Singh a trustworthy man and a friend.

 Bushs enthusiasm and the celebratory mood at the White House contrasted sharply with the atmospherics in New Delhi, where proceedings in Parliament were dominated by expressions of concern about the nature of the US legislation.

 Bush outlined four key goals for America in agreeing to change the rules of nuclear commerce with India. 

 First, the bill will help us strengthen cooperation between India and the US on one of the most important challenges in the 21st century, and that is energy.... By helping India expand its use of safe nuclear energy, this bill lays the foundation for a new strategic partnership between our two nations, Bush said. 

 Second, the bill... helps open a new important market for American businesses by paving the way for investment in Indias civilian nuclear industry for the first time ever. This new trade will help American companies gain new customers abroad and create new jobs here at home.

 The President said the change in rules will make it possible for India to reduce emissions and improve its environment.

 Bush said that after 30 years outside the system, India will now operate its civilian nuclear energy programme under internationally accepted guidelines and the world is going to be safer as a result.

 The signing of the legislation caps nearly one and a half years of intense diplomatic activity not only in Washington and New Delhi, but also in key global centres of non-proliferation such as Vienna.

 At times, it appeared on several occasions that the US initiative to make an exception for India in nuclear commerce would fall through.

 In fact, there is still no agreement in India and the US on what the new act is about. 

 India insists it is about civilian nuclear energy, the US has repeatedly said it is about non-proliferation, mainly to pacify those here who are opposed to the legislation.

 The new act is no guarantee that India will be able to buy nuclear plants any time soon. New Delhi has to sign an agreement with the US detailing its nuclear ties before the new legislation can take effect. 

 Negotiations on this agreement are proving to be tough.

 India also has to sign an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency on international safeguards for several of its nuclear installations. Then the 45-member Nuclear Suppliers Group has to accept the new US act and agree to making an exception for selling technology and equipment to India, which remains outside the current global non-proliferation regime.

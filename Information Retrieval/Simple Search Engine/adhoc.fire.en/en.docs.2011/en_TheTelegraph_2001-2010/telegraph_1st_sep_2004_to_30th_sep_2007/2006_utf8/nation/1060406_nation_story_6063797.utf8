Scriptwriter asks Smriti to say sorry

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, April 5: Balaji Telefilms scriptwriter Rekha Modi has demanded an apology from Smriti Iraani, a year after her arrest for allegedly threatening the television star.

 Modis move comes after a State Human Rights Commission probe report questioned the intention and role of police officers in executing the arrest.

 Modi and a Balaji Telefilms actor were arrested by Oshiwara police on charges of making threatening phone calls to Smriti (in PTI picture) and her family in March 2005.

 For nine months, Modi has been fighting a legal battle against the police investigation and the manner in which the arrest was executed.

 She filed a complaint with the state rights panel in June 2005 against Oshiwara police officers, making the police commissioner a respondent.

 Modi alleged the officers violated her rights by not following proper procedures while lodging the FIR and preparing the arrest memo, and not granting her bail despite her alleged offence being a bailable one.

 After conducting a probe, the rights panel observed that the police had violated Supreme Court directives by not preparing an arrest memo, not informing Modis family of her arrest and not taking signatures of witnesses on the panchnama.

 The order said the police had violated the right of the accused to be given bail at the police station in a bailable offence, and observed that escorting Modi to court and exposing her to the media amounted to tarnishing her image and dignity.

 The intention and role of the police in not sending the FIR next day to the magistrate is very doubtful. They sent the FIR after 15 days of registration (of the offence) which shows malafide intention of the police officers? it said.

 Modi, who wrote some episodes of teleserial Kyunki Saans Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi in which Iraani plays a major role, said: The commissions order shows that the investigation done against me had no basis. I am happy that I have won this battle.

 Modis counsel Y.P. Singh said: After the commissions order, we expect Iraani to accept moral responsibility for Modis arrest, and tender an apology. Iraani refused comment.

 Family pardons Pak killer

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Thiruvananthapuram, Feb. 12: A 70-year-old Pakistani, who killed an Indian teashop employee 25 years ago in the UAE, may soon walk free because relatives of the slain P.T. Murrath in Kerala have pardoned him.

 Akhtar Hussain has been languishing in the Abu Dhabi central jail after a UAE court sentenced him to death soon after the murder. 

 According to P.T. Khalid, Murraths brother and schoolteacher at Perithalmanna in the northern Malappuram district, the murder took place during a robbery bid at the teashop at Al Ain where his brother was employed.

 Hussain, then 45, and fellow Pakistani, Mustaq Sardar Khan, 17, were caught by Murrath while trying to escape with stolen items. But Murrath, 21, suffered fatal stab wounds in the chase.

 Khans palms were amputated and he was deported to Pakistan.

 P.T. Abdurazzak, another brother of Murrath, working with customs in Abu Dhabi, said on phone he had no idea what prevented the execution. 

 We had taken him for gone. I happened to hear a casual conversation between two Keralites about Hussains case. Once I confirmed he was in jail, I broached the idea of pardon with the rest of the family. They all agreed, he said.

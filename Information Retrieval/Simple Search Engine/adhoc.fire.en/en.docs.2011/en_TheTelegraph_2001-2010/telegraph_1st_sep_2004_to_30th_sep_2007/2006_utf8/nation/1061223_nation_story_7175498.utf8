The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Back to mutiny town, after 150 years

 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY

 Bithoor (Uttar Pradesh), Dec. 22: The Rani of Jhansi fought here. So did Nana Saheb and Tantya Tope. But when the countrys first cry for freedom fell silent in these dusty plains, the vengeance that followed buried Bithoor.

 Lost under the weight of one and a half centuries, historys forgotten footnote is now riding back to reclaim its place.

 As the Uttar Pradesh government and the Centre prepare to celebrate 150 years of the Sepoy Mutiny, Bithoor about 130 km from Lucknow and 30 km from Kanpur has rocked back into reckoning.

 Officials from the Archaeological Survey of India visited the ruins of the old town for a quick mapping of the monuments, while the states tourism department has begun constructing a history complex near the remains of a fort of Baji Rao II, the last peshwa.

 A museum, a canopy, a lotus pond and a statue of Baji Rao will come up in the complex, said tourism minister Kokab Hamid.

 The museum, Hamid added, would preserve documents, historical materials and relics.

 All the structures in the complex are modelled on 19th century architecture.

 The tourism department is also planning a Bithoor history festival in May 2007.

 In 1857, as the murmurs of discontent gathered into a storm, Bithoor became the epicentre of the countrys first war of independence as Nana Saheb, Tantya Tope and Rani Laxmi Bai launched their struggle against the British from here.

 Nana Saheb, the adopted son of Baji Rao who had been banished to Bithoor early in the 19th century, made the town his headquarters.

 But the war ended in defeat and Bithoor was captured on July 19. As the British soldiers marched through the town, its monuments were virtually destroyed. Nana Sahebs palace and the forts and temples he had built were razed to the ground.

 Some of the old monuments of Baji Raos time are now being protected, said ASI deputy superintending archaeologist, Lucknow circle, R. Pathak.

 The tourism department, which is planning to rebuild some of the demolished forts, had to rummage through old records to trace their locations. The main fort of Baji Rao, finally found in a jungle, lies in ruins. But the government has a battle on its hands one person has claimed the land as his own.

 Bithoor did not find much mention in historical texts. Overtaken by cities like Kanpur, Fatehpur and Kannauj as they developed into important centres of business, Bithoor lapsed into anonymity.

 Existing records testify that in the 18th century, when Nawab Shuja-ud-daula ruled from 1753 to 1775, the towns administration was handed over to Almas Ali Khan who built a mosque near Lakshman Ghat on the right bank of the Ganga.

 The mosque still exists. Now, a bridge is being built over the river.

 In the 19th century, Baji Rao built the famous Valmiki temple, which is now being done up by the Uttar Pradesh archaeology department for the coming festivities.

 For residents of Bithoor, the sudden flurry of activity is a welcome change from the neglect of all these years.

 From Pakistan, a novel Afghan signal

 BHARAT BHUSHAN

 New Delhi, May 16: In a remarkable offer, Maulana Fazlur Rehman, the chief of Pakistans Jamiat Ulema-e-Islami (JUI) and leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly, has invited India to help his country stabilise its border with Afghanistan.

 Rehman, the secretary general of the Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal (MMA), is currently in India on the invitation of the Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind.

 The maulana is not considered to be anti-India and is a votary of resolving all issues between the two countries ? including Kashmir ? bilaterally. He is expected to meet Indian leaders while in Delhi and also visit the Islamic seminary at Deoband in Uttar Pradesh from which he draws inspiration.

 I want peace on both the western and the eastern frontiers of Pakistan. India and Pakistan have to collectively and co-operatively evolve joint mechanisms to ensure peace on both these fronts, he said.

 Ensuring peace along the eastern border, especially in relation to Jammu and Kashmir, one could understand, but did he really mean that India should help Pakistan in ensuring peace along its Afghan border? 

 Yes, because India has influence in Afghanistan and if Pakistan has some issues there, then even those should be addressed by India, the maulana argued.

 Although Rehman glossed over the past crimes of the Taliban in Afghanistan, he argued that they must be provided a way to join the democratic process.

 I am in favour of a democratic Afghanistan and the involvement of all political parties in the electoral process. For this to happen, one must give an opening to the jihadi forces and those fighting for Independence to come into the democratic process, he argued.

 Rehman, who is considered close to the Taliban and opposed to the US role in Afghan affairs, said: Afghanistan would not be stable till the foreign forces leave and the people have the right to decide their future. 

 Describing the brutal killing by the Taliban of Indian engineer K. Suryanarayana last month as a distasteful incident, he asked: How can anyone justify killing someone who is unarmed and has not raised his hand to fight you? I condemn the incident. 

 However, he refused to comment on the Taliban claim that Pakistans Inter-Services Intelligence had ordered the killing.

 The maulana was also reluctant to comment on the emerging internal situation in Pakistan. However, he did make a case in favour of a constitutional system: If the constitutional provisions are followed, the people will be happy.

 But surely there were concerns about the role that the army had assumed in Pakistans polity. In a veiled criticism of General Pervez Musharraf, he said: Both the army and Parliament have constitutionally defined spheres of activity. They should limit themselves to their respective constitutional roles. This is necessary and this is what people want.

 The maulana welcomed the dialogue in London between Benazir Bhutto, the leader of the Pakistan Peoples Party, and Nawaz Sharif, the exiled chief of the Pakistan Muslim League. 

 It is good for politicians to even just sit together. If they talk, that is even better. This is a political process. We commend this process. If they come to Pakistan, we will welcome them, he said.

 About India-Pakistan relations, the JUI leader felt that a clean heart and strong resolve were needed to improve ties. Rehman, who had first visited India during the Vajpayee era in 2003, however, felt that while formal talks were going on and confidence-building measures had been put in place, a chill has entered the relationship and the earlier warmth is missing.

 He argued: India needs to show some enthusiasm for finding a Kashmir solution and respond to Pakistans proposals. For this, either the Kashmiris should be included in the talks or they should be kept as near as possible to the bilateral dialogue table. Taking them into confidence alone would ensure that they support an amicable solution.

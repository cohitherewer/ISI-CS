 In consensus hunt lies ordinance trap

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 25: A section of the BJP was initially keen on an ordinance to redefine what constitutes an office of profit as its own members have come under the glare of the law.

 Until L.K. Advani clarified the partys position at a late-evening meeting with parliamentary affairs minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, the BJP was not willing to go on record what its stand will be.

 When the BJPs chief whip in the Rajya Sabha, S.S. Ahluwalia, met Das Munshi, he said he would wait for the governments proposal rather than reveal our cards.

 The BJP, which had been opposing an ordinance in public on the ground that it was originally meant to save Sonia Gandhi, started having second thoughts when trouble erupted in Jharkhand, a state ruled by a party-led coalition. 

 The Jharkhand Assembly has already passed an amendment to exempt many offices that otherwise may land many legislators in trouble and threaten the majority of the government. But the governor is yet to give assent to the amendment.

 The BJP felt that a central ordinance would not only help the party justify the amendment in Ranchi but also force the governor to endorse it.

 Playing on the BJPs fears, the Centre made sure that one question it asked political parties was whether the option of an ordinance should be explored.

 The ploy seems to have had an immediate impact with the BJP unable to make up its mind till late in the evening. 

 An ordinance was a tempting option but had the BJP bitten the juicy bait, it would have given the government a chance to pounce on the party with the charge of double standards. 

 Even now, the government feels that there is no need to rush. The Election Commission had asked the complainants to furnish specific details and spell out the reasons why they have sought the disqualification. It has given them three weeks time. So why should the government act in haste? Let the affected parties face the music after what they did to Sonia Gandhi, said the leader of a UPA constituent.

 Although Ahluwalia would not say so, it is believed he went as far as telling Das Munshi that the amendments should be legislated without a discussion. Some Congress members said Advani should give the dates, instead of the government.

 Government sources said the earliest date for a Parliament session would be in May after the elections. Even if an all-party meeting reached a consensus on the amendments, these would have to be drafted and fine-tuned by the law ministry and ratified by the cabinet.

 Abani Roy of the RSP proposed that once the draft bill was ready, it should be circulated among the parties and another all-party meeting should be called to avoid glitches in Parliament.

 Among the proposals that emerged today were one from the Left, saying the list of the offices of profit should not be too long. Roy asked for private professions, such as law and medical practice, to be brought within the law.

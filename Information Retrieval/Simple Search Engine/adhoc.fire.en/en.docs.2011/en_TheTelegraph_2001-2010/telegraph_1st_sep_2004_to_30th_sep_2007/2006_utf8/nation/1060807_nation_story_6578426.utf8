 TV babus pull plug on Sarabhai

 BASANT RAWAT

 Series scrapped 

 Ahmedabad, Aug. 6: Mallika Sarabhais plans for making a docu-series on Gujarat for Doordarshan have crashed with the Centre pulling the project without a word of explanation.

 Officials in Narendra Modis office, Prasar Bharati and Ahmedabad Doordarshan are believed to have been up in arms after the Planning Commission granted her Rs 10 crore for the pilot project of SAT a week ago.

 The danseuse today said she had no inkling the project would be pulled. 

 I just got information that the Centre has unilaterally decided to cancel the project without giving an explanation.

 Sarabhai had last Tuesday announced SAT as her second experiment with television after the failure of the Gujarati Tara channel. She said she wanted to use TV for change, and had set October 2 as the tentative launch of her docu-series.

 Sources said officials in Prasar and Ahmedabad Doordarshan had protested against outside interference in their functioning after Sarabhai got the grant. They had reportedly resisted the Centres move for long and held several stormy meetings to scuttle her project.

 Ahmedabad Doordarshan director Laxman Madarwal, however, claimed nothing of the kind had happened. Whatever has happened has happened in Delhi. We have played no role in cancelling her project.

 A senior official in the chief ministers office is also believed to have written two letters to the Centre, questioning the legality and propriety of the decision to award her the contract.

 Some state government officials reportedly wrote to the Planning Commission that she intended to distort the image of Gujarat through her docu-series.

 Sarabhais relations with chief minister Modi have been strained since she moved the Supreme Court for a CBI probe into the 2002 Gujarat riots. She had also gone public that she was being harassed for panning Modis handling of the riots.

 The danseuse, who has been talking with the Planning Commission for a year about her project, termed the Centres decision a tragedy. She claimed she had already spent Rs 40 lakh on the project.

 Although she tried to downplay her differences with the Modi regime, she told a friend: ASAT (dishonesty) has won and SAT (honesty) has lost at the altar of politics.

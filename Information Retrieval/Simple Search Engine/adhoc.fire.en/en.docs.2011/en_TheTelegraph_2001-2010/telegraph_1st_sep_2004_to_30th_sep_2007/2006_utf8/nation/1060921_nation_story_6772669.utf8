 Institutes fumble over quotas

 MONOBINA GUPTA

 New Delhi, Sept. 20: The implementation of the 27 per cent quota for other backward classes is getting sticky with many higher education institutions not handing in roadmaps on how they propose to kick in the system.

 Only five of 18 central universities have submitted their roadmaps to Veerappa Moilys oversight committee in keeping with the deadline. The delay by the others is likely to create confusion over the new quota regime that is to take effect from the 2007 academic year.

 Sensing trouble, the oversight committee has sought Arjun Singhs intervention to speed up matters. The human resource development ministry has sent a letter to the defaulting universities to submit their proposals fast.

 Sources, however, said the delay by the institutions was not deliberate. It was more a case of lacking the knowhow to draw up a micro-level report with all the nuts and bolts in place.

 This is the first time that the Moily committee has sought the help of the HRD ministry. So far, it has directly communicated with the five sub-committees for each category of institution.

 The committee submitted an interim report last month and was to have handed in the final one by August 31. Since then, it has postponed its meetings twice. The next meeting is scheduled for next week.

 The anti-reservation lobby had pointed out that sudden introduction of 27 per cent quotas an increase of almost 50 per cent seats in each institution was bound to create problems. This is evident in the institutions delay in submitting roadmaps.

 The higher education institutions have six months to put in place the new system with the extra seats, facilities and the infrastructure.

 The Moily committees interim report has underlined the daunting task ahead of the institutions. Not just IITs and IIMs, every other category of institution central universities, agricultural universities and medical colleges had recommended staggered implementation of quotas to the committee. But the HRD ministry was in favour of a one-time introduction.

 However, faced with an overwhelming no, the ministry has agreed to a stagger the implementation over three years. The institutions will now have to work out the percentage of quota they want to implement each year.

 The quota bill introduced in the last session of Parliament is now before a standing committee. The bill has outlined the broad parameters of implementation and cleared the confusion in two critical areas the pace of implementation and the inclusion of the creamy layer among the OBCs.

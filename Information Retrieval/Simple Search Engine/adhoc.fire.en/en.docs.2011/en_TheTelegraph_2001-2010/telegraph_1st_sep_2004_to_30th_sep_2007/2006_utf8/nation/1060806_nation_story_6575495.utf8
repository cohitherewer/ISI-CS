 Pathak not sure about letter

 PTI AND OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 Justice Pathak

 New Delhi, Aug. 5: Justice R.S. Pathak, who probed the oil-for-food scandal, today said he cant be sure whether he had given a letter to help Natwar Singhs son Jagat get admission in a British law college many years ago.

 Asked about reports quoting Natwar that the former Chief Justice of India had given a letter of recommendation to Jagat, Pathak told PTI: I dont recall. It was so long ago.

 On whether he remembered having given any letter of introduction to anyone during that period, he said: Generally, I dont give such letters. But I cant be sure.

 Asked if he saw anything wrong in such letters being given, Pathak replied: Unless you know somebody, it cannot be given. I dont give letters left and right.

 Pressed further whether he knew Natwar or his family, the retired judge said: I knew Natwar Singh. But I did not know his son.

 On the possibility of Natwar requesting him for a note of introduction, Pathak said: He may have asked for the letter. But it is such a long time back. It must have been 20 years ago. I cant recall.

 Pathak brushed aside the Opposition allegation that Natwar was made a scapegoat and the Congress exonerated without being heard by him.

 Please read the report. You will understand everything. I dont want to make any comment now, said Pathak, who was Chief Justice of India from December 1986 to June 1989.

 After Pathak filed his report, Natwar had said there was nothing wrong in writing letters of recommendation. 

 The former foreign minister was quoted as saying even Pathak, when he was Chief Justice, had written a letter of recommendation introducing his son to his counterpart in the UK.

 Natwar said the letter by him merely introduced a person and said he would be grateful if he was helped in doing business in Iraq.

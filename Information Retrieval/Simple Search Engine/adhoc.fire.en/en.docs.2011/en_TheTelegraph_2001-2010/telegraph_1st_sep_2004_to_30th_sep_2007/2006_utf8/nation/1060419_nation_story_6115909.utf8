 Rebel swoop on editors

 Imphal, April 18: Media freedom in Manipur was reduced to a joke by a militant faction that held six Imphal-based newspaper editors hostage throughout Sunday night and forced them to publish a statement which they had previously ignored.

 Journalists today went on a strike and organised a rally in protest against the incident, which is the first of its kind even in a state where militant groups routinely intimidate people into submission.

 The Kangleipak Communist Party (KCP) faction, headed by a militant City Meitei, had summoned the six editors to Imphal West district on Sunday on the pretext of holding a news conference. 

 The editors were held captive at the same place till Monday morning, when their newspapers published the statement about the outfits raising day celebrations in the form their captors wanted. 

 Before freeing the editors, the militants told them that they had clamped a ban on the Imphal Free Press, an English daily, for three months for misquoting a previous statement.

 We went there because the group had invited us for a media meet. But once we met them, the group made its intention very clear. They held us captive and freed us only after they saw the statement published in yesterdays editions, one of the hostages said.

 A spokesman for the Editors Forum said journalists in the state would not succumb to pressure from militants any longer, but most admitted in private that it was easier said than done. 

 Functionaries of the All Manipur Working Journalists Union and the Editors Forum decided last night to jointly protest intimidation by militant groups. They also decided to reject the ban on the Imphal Free Press. The daily published todays edition.

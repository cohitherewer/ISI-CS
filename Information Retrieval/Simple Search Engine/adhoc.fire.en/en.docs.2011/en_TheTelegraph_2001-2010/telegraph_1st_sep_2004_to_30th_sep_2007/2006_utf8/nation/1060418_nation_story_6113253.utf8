 Soz not govts voice

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 17: The Congress today attempted to distance itself from water resources minister Saifuddin Sozs comment on the Sardar Sarovar dam.

 Party spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi said Sozs statement of intent ? to suspend work on the dam till rehabilitation is over ? was made as a member of the Narmada Control Authority review committee and not as a government representative. Soz is not the voice of the government but a member of a committee which had different inputs. This committee had not taken a final decision.

 The statement had landed the Congress in a spot with Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi going on a hunger strike and the partys state leaders threatening a bandh.

 Caught between the compulsion of backing the UPA governments position on Narmada and yielding to the pressure of its state units, the Congress today seemed at a loss when asked whether it had not risked being perceived as anti-poor at the cost of projecting itself as pro-development in the dam versus resettlement polemics.

 Singhvi made it clear that his party supported the Centres stand that was conveyed to the Supreme Court today by its standing counsel. The Prime Minister has taken a decision keeping all the inputs in mind and the Congress supports his stand.

 The Congress spokesperson said the Prime Minister has clarified that while work on the dam will not stop, resettlement and relief operations will be carried out by end-August. That is when the question of raising the height of the dam would arise, he added.

 Singhvi accused Modi of playing politics with Narmada. It is all histrionics, drama, and the political activities (of Modi) are with an eye on the forthcoming Gujarat elections, he said.

 However, Congress sources admitted in private that Soz had jumped the gun with his statement, which came after he chaired a meeting of the chief ministers of Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Maharashtra and environment minister A. Raja.

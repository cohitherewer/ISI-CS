 Visas for Pak fans

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 20: The Union home ministry has decided to issue 1,000 visas to Pakistani fans who want to watch their team take on New Zealand and South Africa on October 25 and 27 in Mohali during the Champions Trophy. 

 The figure 500 for each match is over three times the 300 visas that central security agencies had suggested.

 Sources said the Prime Ministers Office had asked the home ministry to increase the number after a special request from the BCCI to take a liberal view. 

 For the India-Pakistan Test last year, 10,000 visas had been sanctioned, but only 3,000 were eventually used. However, wary of the 54 fans who went missing 11 are suspected of having terrorist links the Centre is taking special precautions this time round. Union home secretary V.K. Duggal held a special meeting with top Punjab police officials and senior BCCI member Rajeev Shukla. 

 A large number of officials from the Intelligence Bureau and Punjab police will keep an eye on Pakistani spectators during their Mohali stay, which will not be extended beyond four days. 

 Unlike last year, visas this time will be granted only by the Islamabad-based Indian high commission, which is better equipped to deal with security-related issues. They will be granted only to those who have valid tickets for the matches to be played by the Pakistani team at Mohali. The high commission will also decide which spectators would have to report to the police at Mohali or Chandigarh, said a senior home ministry official.

 Shukla, the chairman of BCCIs media committee, said government accommodation has been arranged for the Pakistani spectators. All hotels in Mohali are full. If Pakistan secures a semi-final birth, we will go for fresh arrangements to grant them visas, he added.

 Special booths are being set at prominent places and at key points around the stadium to help the fans, said Chandrashekhar, additional director-general of Punjab police.

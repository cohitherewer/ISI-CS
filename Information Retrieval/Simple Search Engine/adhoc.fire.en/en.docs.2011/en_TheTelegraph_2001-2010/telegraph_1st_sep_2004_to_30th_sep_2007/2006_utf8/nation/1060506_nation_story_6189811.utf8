 Cricket rights battle

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 5: Ten Sports, which holds exclusive telecast rights for Indias cricket tour of West Indies, today moved the Supreme Court seeking to restrain Doordarshan from downlinking live feed of the matches.

 India will play five one-day matches and four Tests during its May 18-July 4 tour of West Indies.

 The Supreme Court will hear the matter on Tuesday.

 The sports channel, which moved the apex court in anticipation of Doordarshans demand, has also sought a stay on the operation of a provision in the 2005 downlinking guidelines.

 The provision makes it mandatory for all private channels to share feed of events of national importance with Prasar Bharati, which runs Doordarshan. Ten Sports pointed out that a petition challenging the constitutional validity of the provision was pending before court and if a stay was not granted, the petition would become infructuous as the matches would be over before the matter is decided, the channels plea said.

 It added that the channel had acquired telecast rights for matches in Pakistan, Sri Lanka and West Indies for over $100 million and it would be unfair to force it to share the feed with Doordarshan. The plea also stated that Ten Sports has sold the distribution right to Set Discovery Pvt Ltd, which will have the right to license in the country.

 The Centre today offered to telecast the matches without deleting the advertisements booked by the sports channel, but Ten Sports also wants a payment for the live feed. So, solicitor-general G.E. Vahanvati has sought time to seeking instructions.

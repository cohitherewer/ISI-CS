 Raipur, May 22: After nearly a century and a half, Kediama village in Raipur district will see children running in the lanes and the elders gossiping at the choupal (square). 

 The village, deserted 145 years ago, will be rehabilitated and rebuilt, thanks to an initiative of the Chhattisgarh government. Chief minister Raman Singh laid the foundation stone for the Rs 88.55-lakh project a few days ago.

 Tucked away in the serene hills of Chura development block, around 150 km south of the state capital, Kediama had around 65 tribal families before the exodus triggered by mystery fires and superstition. Agriculture was the main source of livelihood for the villagers.

 Ramdayal Thakur (76), who is now settled in neighbouring Junwani village, recalled the story his grandfather had told him. 

 During summer every year, fires were common in the village and at least one house was certain to be reduced to ashes.

 With history repeating itself every year, the people started to believe that the village deities ? Ghatrani and Jatmai Devi ? were angry with them and the annual fires were the punishment. 

 Unable to find a solution, the villagers deserted Kediama and settled in nearby hamlets like Junwani, Kanesar and Gaydabri. 

 Years later in March 2006, Aghan Singh ? whose ancestors hailed from Kediama ? approached former Raipur MP and Gandhian leader Keyoor Bhushan with a proposal to rebuild the village.

 A month ago, the villagers led by Bhushan called on the chief minister to brief him on the proposal. Singh was quick to act and the project was finalised within a month.

 Around 400 people, including children and senior citizens, have expressed their eagerness to return to the village where their ancestors used to live. The village continues to exist in the revenue records of the Raipur district administration but without any population. 

 Under the project, 77 houses would be constructed in the village in addition to 4 km of approach road, hand pumps, community hall, primary school and an Anganwadi centre. Also, the electricity line would be extended and ponds revived. 

 Flow irrigation facility will be provided to 300 acres of farmland. The construction work is likely to be completed within 16 months. 

 The chief minister said the landscape, climate and surroundings of the village impressed him so much that he wished to settle down there. He announced that Kediama would be developed as a model village.

 Train return tickets to cost more

 New Delhi, May 18 (PTI): The railways have increased reservation charges for return tickets with effect from April 1, the Rajya Sabha was informed today.

 The reservation fee for tickets booked for journeys originating from (locations) other than the ticket booking station have been increased, minister of state for railways R. Velu said.

 While the rise is Rs 10 for second and sleeper classes of passenger, mail and express trains, it is Rs 15 for other classes. For the Rajdhani and Shatabdi Express, the increase is Rs 20 for all classes. Passengers travelling by the Jan Shatabdi Express will have to pay Rs 15 and Rs 20 more for second class and AC chair-car, respectively.

 The hike is expected to earn an additional Rs 80 crore every year for the railways, Velu said, adding that the move is aimed at recovering the additional expenditure involved in maintaining and upgrading the network.

 He also ruled out withdrawal of the move, saying the basic fare has not been raised.

 Velu said the railways are levying service tax on mobile catering services according to the directives of the finance ministry and the rate it prescribed. 

 He said the Indian Railways Catering and Tourism Corporation and its licensees have been instructed to pass the entire collection to the authorities concerned under the finance ministry. 

 Tenders for 82 railway stations where cyber cafes are to be set up have been issued, the minister added. So far, only one cyber cafe has been set up at New Delhi railway station.

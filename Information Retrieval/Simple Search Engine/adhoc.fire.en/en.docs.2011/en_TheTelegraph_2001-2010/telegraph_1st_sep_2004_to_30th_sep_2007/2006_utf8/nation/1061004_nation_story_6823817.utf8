 1993 verdict

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Oct. 3: The anti-terror court trying the 1993 blasts case today decided the fate of accused number 98 Niyaz Ahmed Sheikh and number 103 Rukhsana Mohammed Shafi Zariwala. 

 Judge P.D. Kode announced a guilty verdict on Niyaz, who had been charged with conspiracy, abetting terrorist activities and undergoing arms training in Pakistan. 

 Niyaz went there in 1992 to meet prime accused Tiger Memon. Later, he was given training in the use of arms, including handling of explosives and ammunition.

 Niyaz had also been entrusted with the job of making preliminary appraisals about potential targets.

 Rukhsana was the third woman to be tried after the two sisters-in-law of Tiger Memon. She was charged with abetment of terrorist activity. 

 The judge discarded the evidence given by the prosecution that Rukhsana had transported arms in a taxi from suburban Jogeshwari to Musafirkhana along with her husband Mohammad Shafi and another co-accused, Pervez Shaikh.

 Kode declared her not guilty saying that confessions of the two co-accused implicating Rukhsana were not properly recorded, so he would not accept them.

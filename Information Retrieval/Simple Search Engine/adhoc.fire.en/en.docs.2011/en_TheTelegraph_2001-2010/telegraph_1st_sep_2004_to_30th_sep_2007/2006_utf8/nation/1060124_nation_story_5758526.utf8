 US detains ship with Indians

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 23: The US Navy has detained a ship with 16 Indians on board in the Gulf after an alert that pirates may have boarded the vessel.

 The ship flew the Indian flag and had 26 on board, including 10 Somalians.

 The vessel, a dhow called Safina Al Bisarat, was said to be carrying coal from Mogadishu, the Somalian capital, to Dubai.

 It was chased and captured by a missile destroyer of the US Navy on Sunday after another vessel, the Delta Ranger, a Bahamian-flagged bulk carrier, reported to the International Maritime Bureau that it was fired at from the dhow.

 The crew of the dhow is being interrogated and it is yet to be determined if they are legitimate sailors.

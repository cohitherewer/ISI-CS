 Moms to get school voting rights

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Nov. 27: The Bengal government is planning to amend rules concerning election of guardians representatives on school managing committees to ensure that students mothers can choose them.

 In the present system, mothers can vote only in the absence of fathers. It is going to be the reverse once the bill becomes a law fathers will have a vote in the absence of mothers.

 The managing committees of over 13,000 state-aided secondary and higher secondary institutions have a major say in the overall functioning of their administration.

 We will examine the existing rules concerning the election of guardians representatives of schools so that mothers can be given the first option to participate in the voting process, school education minister Partha De told the Assembly during question hour.

 Jane Alam Mian of the RSP had asked the minister whether the government had a plan to offer voting rights to both the father and mother in the constitution of school managing committees.

 De said two votes for every student was not acceptable. We must ensure that a single vote is cast for every child. It is impossible to allow two persons the father and mother to cast votes together. But we are definitely examining whether mothers can be allowed to vote instead of fathers.

 Leaders across political lines voiced support for the mothers voting rights. 

 According to rules, there should be at least two mothers in the managing committees of girls schools. Fathers, it is believed, are less inclined to elect women to represent them. 

 Mothers must be get the right to vote. Otherwise, how can the government ensure fairness in the election process? Mian said.

 The legislators also called upon the minister to frame a policy on children of divorced parents. There is no mention of them in the existing rules.

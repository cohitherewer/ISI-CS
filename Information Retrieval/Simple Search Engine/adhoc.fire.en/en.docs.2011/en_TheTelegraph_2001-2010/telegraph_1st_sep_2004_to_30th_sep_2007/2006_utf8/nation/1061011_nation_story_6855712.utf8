 Real estate monitor on way

New Delhi, Oct. 10 (PTI): The government is likely to introduce a bill in Parliament next year to set up a real estate regulator to protect the interest of customers and other stakeholders.

 The government will also pursue the repeal of the urban land ceiling act and reduction of stamp duty with the states by making them one of the conditions for release of grants totalling Rs 50,000 crore in the next six years under the Jawaharlal Nehru Urban Renewal Mission.

 The bill would be given final shape next year and brought in Parliament, urban development minister S. Jaipal Reddy said on the sidelines of a seminar on real estate here last night.

 Reddy pointed out that the urban land ceiling act and stamp duties, which drew flak from speakers at the seminar, are state subjects. 

 But, he said, the Centre would add conditions for the abolition of the urban land ceiling act and curtailment of stamp duties while entering into a memorandum of agreements with state governments for release of grants under the urban renewal mission.

 The matching contribution under the mission will be provided by the states, he added.

 Revealing that several states have agreed to do away with the urban land ceiling act, Reddy said Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has decided to set up a cabinet committee to consider the issue. 

 The Bengal government, he said, has already brought down the stamp duty to 6 per cent. Fear of loss of revenue due to the cut stems from an old mindset, the minister added.

 Reddy also opposed rent control acts in various parts of the country, saying they have not only outlived their utility but are also a stumbling block in providing housing facilities in urban areas.

 Referring to Delhi, he said the problem of land paucity would be much more acute here than in Mumbai in the days to come and vertical growth in buildings will be encouraged here.

 A new policy to encourage vertical growth will begin with Delhi, Reddy said.

 Zee boss in UNI offer

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 20: Caught in a controversy over his takeover of United News of India (UNI), Essel Group chairman Subhash Chandra today said he would pull out of the news agency if anyone else was willing to revive it.

 Chandra offered to hand over the 51 per cent stake he has acquired in UNI to the government if it wanted to step in. Let them run it.

 Still later in his news briefing, Chandra said that if a group of newspaper owners was ready to invest money in the agency, I would tell them, take it back, revive it.

 Essel, which owns Zee Television and has a stake in the DNA newspaper, plans to invest up to Rs 100 crore in UNI over the next two years. There would be no retrenchment of staff, Chandra said, but did not rule out a voluntary retirement scheme.

 The groups recent purchase of unsubscribed UNI shares has made it the principal shareholder Chandra disputed the term takeover in the agency and brought in four of its representatives on the 12-member board of directors. 

 The move triggered a huge controversy with some board members complaining that the deal was negotiated and executed on the sly. The UNI employees union, fearing retrenchment and a change in the basic character of the agency, is up in arms. The Left parties, too, have expressed apprehension.

 Although Chandra maintains that the deal was transparent and that Essel was the highest bidder, he faces a legal challenge in Delhi High Court. 

 A Bhopal-based newspaper has said it offered the UNI board more money than the Rs 32 crore Chandra has spent, but was turned down. The court has ordered status quo till the next hearing on December 18.

 I expected some resistance, but I didnt expect this kind of reaction, Chandra said, insisting that profit was not the motive for the deal. 

 The ABP Group, the publishers of The Telegraph, is among the newspaper groups that hold shares in UNI.

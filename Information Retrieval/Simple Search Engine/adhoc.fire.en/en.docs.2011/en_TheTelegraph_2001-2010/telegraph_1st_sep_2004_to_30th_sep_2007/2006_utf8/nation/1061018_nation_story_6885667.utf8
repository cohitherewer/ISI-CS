 Jessica gets Priya justice 

 SINGH GYANANT KUMAR 

 New Delhi, Oct. 17: It was the mass acquittals in the Jessica Lal murder that did it for Santosh Kumar Singh.

 Over seven years, as the Priyadarshini Mattoo case files gathered dust in Delhi High Court, the law graduate had slowly settled into normal life.

 He had started his legal practice after his acquittal on December 3, 1999, married just over a year later and become the father of a girl. 

 The country seemed to have forgotten all about how a senior police officers son, accused of raping and killing a student, had walked away free from court with the judge accusing the prosecution of hiding evidence.

 Public memory was stirred by the Jessica verdict of February 21, which cleared all nine defendants, including main accused Manu Sharma, a former ministers son. As the street protests and candle marches began, Priyadarshini Mattoo was suddenly back in the headlines.

 The CBI was in the dock, the higher judiciary was embarrassed and a question was raised in Parliament.

 As the outcry led to the Jessica case being reopened, Delhi High Court on August 31 ordered daily hearings of the appeal against Santoshs acquittal.

 Priyadarshinis father Chamanlal thanked the media after the verdict.

 The judgment would hold out hope for Jessicas sister Sabrina Lal and Neelam Katara, another woman fighting against a family with political clout.

 Neelams son Nitish was murdered in 2002 allegedly at the behest of the son and nephew of former MP and Uttar Pradesh strongman D.P. Yadav. A listless prosecution had allowed the case to drag on and fade out till the Jessica verdict yanked it back into the spotlight.

 A fourth case showing the same features a well-connected defendant and a prosecution that seems hard to tell apart from the defence was the BMW hit-and-run that killed six people in 1999. The prime accused is Sanjeev Nanda, son of a former navy chief.

 The Jessica and Mattoo cases have another link Santoshs lawyer Mohammed Naseem also represents Manu.

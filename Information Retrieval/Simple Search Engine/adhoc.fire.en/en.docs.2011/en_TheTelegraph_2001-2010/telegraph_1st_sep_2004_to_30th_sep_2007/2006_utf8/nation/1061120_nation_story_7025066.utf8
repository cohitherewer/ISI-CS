 Ad riders for radio

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 19: The governments new policy on community radio stations not only allows them to run commercials but also seek foreign funds. There are strings attached, of course.

 The policy grants non-profit organisations the right to apply for licences to run such radio stations. Earlier, only academic institutions could set up their own low-power stations.

 One contentious issue was whether to allow advertisements. The argument against running advertisements was this would make community radio stations commercial ventures. Instead, the government wanted them to focus on issues like agriculture, health and education.

 The policy announcement didnt mention advertisements or foreign aid. However, an official said the entire draft policy had been cleared, which means the clauses on commercials and foreign aid got the nod as well.

 So community radio stations can now show up to five minutes of commercials every hour. They have to be local in nature. 

 Donors have to be multilateral aid agencies like a UN body and not a foreign government or an organisation.

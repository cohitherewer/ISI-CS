 BJP letter brigade sets the pace

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Uma Bharti

 New Delhi, May 21: The BJP, it appears, has its fair share of men of letters.

 A closer look would, however, suggest they really do not have much to do with matters cerebral. They are, literally, men who have taken to writing letters with a vengeance.

 Ironically, the trend was set by a woman ? the irrepressible and now-expelled Uma Bharti.

 Uma paved the way for her ouster by her now famous letter to Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh chief K.S. Sudarshan last October. In that letter, she cribbed about the RSS heavyweight Suresh Soni and subsequently leaked the communication to the media.

 Much before that incident pushed her out of the BJP, Uma was obsessed with writing letters at the least provocation. Her latest is a long rant from Madurai on May 18 to President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam about the Sethusamudram ship canal project, which would save 30 hours of sailing time between the east and the west coasts.

 Others have been quick to follow her example. The newest addition to the long list of letter writers was Babulal Marandi. The tribal leader wrote a letter to BJP president Rajnath Singh, levelling wild allegations at several senior leaders, including L.K. Advani, before he resigned from the party.

 Before Marandi had sent in his resignation, former Gujarat chief minister Keshubhai Patel jumped into the fray by dashing off a letter to Rajnath. The party has not been fair to Marandi, Keshubhai reportedly told the BJP president.

 Advani led the pack of compulsive letter writers with as many as five in the last one month, all addressed to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.

 Advani has rendered advice, mostly unsolicited, on matters as diverse as observing the 150th anniversary of the 1857 mutiny to farmers suicide and communications minister Dayanidhi Marans alleged threats to industrialist Ratan Tata.

 The BJP chief, too, is trying to keep pace with his predecessor by shooting off frequent letters to all and sundry. Rajnath also wrote to Nepal Prime Minister G.P. Koirala the day he was appointed.

 Other regular letter writers in the BJP are Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Jaswant Singh who mostly focus on international relations. Jaswant also corresponded frequently with defence minister Pranab Mukherjee on the office-of-profit issue.

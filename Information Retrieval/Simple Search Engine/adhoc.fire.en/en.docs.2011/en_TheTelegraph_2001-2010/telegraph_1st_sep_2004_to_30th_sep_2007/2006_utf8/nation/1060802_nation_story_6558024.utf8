 Sceptical India puts Pak to test

 Dhaka, Aug. 1 (PTI): Apparently unsatisfied by verbal assurances from Pakistan that it was controlling cross-border terrorism, India tonight said it would assess the ground situation and draw its own conclusion if Islamabads action did not match words.

 If Pakistan has said we are in the frontline in the fight against terrorism and we are doing everything possible to control whichever group or individuals are engaged in such activities (terrorism), the best way to judge if it is being done is to judge what is being done on the ground, foreign secretary Shyam Saran told reporters here.

 If it is not being done on the ground, if evidence is pointing to the opposite direction, then we will have to draw the necessary conclusions, he said on the sidelines of a Saarc meeting.

 Sarans comments came after Pakistan foreign secretary Riyaz Mohammad Khan said Islamabad has banned the Lashkar-e-Toiba and the outfit was not operating under any other name. Dawood Ibrahim is also not in Pakistan, Khan added.

 Asked about Indias assertion that the Jamat-ud-Dawa is a front for Lashkar, Khan said it was a charity organisation. Lashkar has been banned in Pakistan and all steps are being taken to freeze their offices and other assets.

 Rakhi for Pervez

 The sister of Sarabjit Singh said in Chandigarh that she has sent rakhis to Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf and her brother, who is on death row there.

 I have sent the rakhis by post and appealed to the Pakistan President to pardon my brother as he is innocent and was not involved in bomb blasts in Lahore, Dalbir Kaur said.

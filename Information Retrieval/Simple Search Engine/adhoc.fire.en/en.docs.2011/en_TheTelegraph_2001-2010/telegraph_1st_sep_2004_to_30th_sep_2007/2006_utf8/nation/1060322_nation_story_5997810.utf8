 RS stick for stung elder

 New Delhi, March 21 (PTI): The Rajya Sabha today expelled its member Sakshi Maharaj, who was caught on camera while demanding money to sanction funds under the MP local area development scheme.

 The Samajwadi Party members term in the House was to have ended tomorrow.

 The House accepted the report of the committee on ethics, headed by senior member Karan Singh, which recommended expulsion of Maharaj for compromising the dignity of the House and for inappropriate conduct. 

 The committee exonerated BSP member Isam Singh. The recommendations were approved by a voice vote.

 Yesterday, the Lok Sabha suspended four MPs who were exposed in the same sting operation conducted by a TV channel.

 Bhojshala on prayer alert

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Dhar, Feb. 2: The fear of turning into another Ayodhya has put Dhar on edge.

 The Madhya Pradesh government and police are busy trying to ensure that Bhojshala does not become a site of communal violence tomorrow, when Hindus gather there to observe Basant Panchami and Muslims for their Juma namaz.

 The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), local authorities and leaders of both communities have agreed that the Bhojshala would remain open for Hindus from sunrise to 12.30 pm and again from 3.30 pm till sunset.

 The district administration has plastered the town with banners and posters, informing residents of the decision.

 The Muslim community has promised not to forcibly enter the premises of the 11th century monument till it is completely vacated by Hindu worshippers. 

 Khalid Nisar, a Dhar-based lawyer and community leader, said: We have also unilaterally decided to prune the size of namazis to 35. Earlier, over 2,000 Muslims were expected to offer prayers.

 The task at hand for the administration and the police is to ensure that the Bhojshala is emptied for three hours for the namaz.

 The Hindu Jagran Manch believes the administration would face problems in emptying the premises in the afternoon without using force. 

 Governor Balram Jakhar, however, has made it clear to chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan that negligence would not be tolerated.

 The governors tough posture seems to be making some impact, as in the last 24 hours, over 300 people have been arrested and the states Manch convener, Radheshayam Yadav, who has been making several provocative statements, has gone underground.

 Earlier, Dhar was agog with whispers that the state administration had decided to turn a blind eye to the simmering communal tension.

 The ASI, which looks after the monument, has decided to send its observers to the town tomorrow. Senior officers S.S. Gupta, Mohammad K.K. and N.K. Richarya would be present at the monument throughout the day.

 For most part of today, Dhar wore a deserted look, save the police and paramilitary forces posted at almost every street.

 Several residents such as government servants, teachers and traders have left the town fearing communal violence, while weddings scheduled for today and tomorrow are being held in neighbouring Indore.

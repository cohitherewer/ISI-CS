 Nation at a Glance

 Hotel promise to pacify CPM

New Delhi (PTI): The Leela Group on Monday promised CPM chief 

Prakash Karat investments of Rs 500 crore each in Kerala and Bengal.

 The move comes amid a stand-off between Kerala chief minister V.S. Achuthanandan and the group over possession of Halycon Palace, a hearitage site near Kovalam beach.

 The meeting between Leela chairman Krishnan Nair and Karat at the CPM headquarters is being seen as an effort on the part of the hotel baron to mollify Achuthanandan, who has publicly stated that he would take every step to recover the palace from the group.

 Apart from the palace, the group had bought ITDCs Asoka Hotel for Rs 50 crore. Trouble broke out after it claimed that the palace and a 4.13-hectare plot near the hotel were part of the deal.

 Achuthanandan had earlier demanded that Nair be arrested for trying to take possession of the heritage site. 

 Goa scanner on foreigners

Panaji (PTI): The Goa government is trying to identify foreigners 

owning properties in the state in violation of the Foreign Exchange Management 

Act (Fema), 1999. 

 We have initiated a process of acquiring data about such foreigners and they have been instructed to furnish information as soon as possible, chief secretary J.P. Singh said.

 These foreigners get all kinds of protection. They run plush business houses in connivance with the locals. They own properties here and stay here. They have greater pulls in the administration and police compared to locals, said social activist Sachin Kurtikar.

 Political parties, too, have voiced concern. The Nationalist Congress Party held a daylong sit-in at Panaji and the BJP has also expressed resentment.

 Blast in train

 Lucknow (PTI): A crude bomb went off and three explosive 

devices were found on the Mathura Express at the Main Charbagh station in Lucknow 

on Sunday night.

 There are no reports of any casualty. The bomb was planted in the toilet of the S4 compartment of the train, police said. 

 Indian sentenced

 Dubai (PTI): An Indian in Kuwait has been sentenced to death 

for killing his paramour and later trying to commit suicide. Smokat S. allegedly 

murdered Jamona in her employers home in December 2005. 

 Zahira shifted

imprisonment for contempt of court, has been brought here and kept in a womens 

cell of the Nashik Road central jail. The prime witness in the Best Bakery case 

has also been sentenced to three months in jail for perjury.

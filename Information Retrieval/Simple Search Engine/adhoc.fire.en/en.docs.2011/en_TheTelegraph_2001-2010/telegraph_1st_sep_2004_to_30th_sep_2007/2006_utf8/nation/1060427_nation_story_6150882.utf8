 Fire! But security comes first

 Help! The Prime Ministers house is on fire.

 Halt! No one, not even a fire tender, goes past us without a check.

 Commuters in the capital were intrigued this afternoon by the sight of five fire tenders lined up at the mouth of one of the roads to Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs house on Racecourse Road.

 It must be a fire, everyone thought, but few could guess why the fire-fighting machines were standing immobile outside the most important address in the country.

 As it turned out, the fire was in a public works storeroom of 7 Racecourse Road and it was described as minor. But the drill that played itself out on Tughlaq Road, one of the four roads that lead to the Prime Ministers house, was by no means minor.

 The Special Protection Group (SPG), the elite force tasked with guarding the Prime Minister, cannot let any vehicle ? no matter whether it is a fire engine and a May Day call has gone out ? enter without the mandatory security check. That was why the five fire engines were told to wait patiently on the road.

 The entire complex is under the direct charge of the SPG and regulations specify that no external element is allowed in without being sanitised ? the walkie-talkie jargon for security check and clearance.

 Not that the fire tenders were needed that badly. Although not as elaborate as the White House that has a separate fire department set up in 1886, 7 Racecourse Road is equipped with a fire extinguishing system. The fire tenders were probably called as a back-up, sources said.

 The fire, noticed by ? who else but the SPG? ? was reported at 1.35 pm. It had broken out in a public works department storeroom. This is located away from the main building of the PMs residence. Some pieces of furniture and other items were kept in that shed, a source said.

 The fire, suspected to have been caused by a short circuit, was put out in 30 minutes.

 By the way, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh missed all the excitement. He is away on an official visit to Germany and Uzbekistan.

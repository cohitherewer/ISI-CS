 Sonia calms funds jitters

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 1: UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi today promised that lack of funds would not come in the way of the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme and the Bharat Nirman programme.

 The UPA government has taken up the task of transforming rural areas through the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act and Bharat Nirman. The task will not be allowed to suffer because of the paucity of funds, Sonia said. 

 The Congress president was addressing the national workshop of state rural development secretaries and programme coordinators of 200-odd districts where the employment scheme is being implemented.

 She told the state officials responsible for the implementation of the scheme that proper utilisation of central funds for rural development would change the lives of villagers.

 Sonias assurance and appreciation of the rural development ministrys work with regard to what is being treated as the governments flagship programme comes two days after she announced that more districts would soon be brought into the ambit of the job scheme. 

 This is the first time Sonia has addressed state officials related to the implementation of the scheme since she launched it with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh at Anantpur in Andhra Pradesh in February this year.

 The move is being seen as the Congress presidents bid to ensure that her party remains the sole claimant to the programme that, many feel, is impregnated with enormous political consequences.

 The Congress has taken the sole credit for providing 100 days of guaranteed employment to the rural populace at a time when the Uttar Pradesh elections are round the corner. 

 From the Congresss point of view, this is all the more significant as various constituents of the UPA as also the Left parties are scrambling to take credit for the programme.

 While there have been reports that some non-Congress state governments are trying to implement the job scheme under their banner, the Left has left no stone unturned to send out the message that its forceful demand prompted the Centre to get it rolling.

 Sonia, who as chairperson of the National Advisory Council was one of the driving forces behind the passage of the employment guarantee act, now seems to be eager to take over the programme to project her partys pro-poor image before the Left hijacks it.

 The job scheme gives a legal guarantee of 100 days employment in a financial year to a rural household willing to do unskilled manual labour. The programme is currently being implemented in 200 districts across 27 states, and the government has already asked the Planning Commission to identify more districts where it can be taken in the second phase of the programme.

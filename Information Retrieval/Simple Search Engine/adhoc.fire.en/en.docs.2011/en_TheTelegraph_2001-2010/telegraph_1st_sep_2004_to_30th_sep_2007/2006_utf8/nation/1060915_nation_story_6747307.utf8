 Comrade Subhas offers puja

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Sept. 14: Marxist sports minister Subhas Chakraborty today performed a puja at Birbhums Tarapith Kali temple, accepted prasad and left chanting Jai Tara (victory to Goddess Tara).

 Chakraborty, a maverick and an old hand in sparking controversies, drove to the temple from a poll rally in Malda. He made an offering of Rs 501, two hibiscus flowers and a zari-embroidered sari.

 Lakhs offer puja at Tarapith and bow their heads in this sacred place for blessings. I, too, did. Whats wrong with that? the minister said when asked if he had party sanction for the puja.

 The visit had been planned in advance and the temple authorities were informed yesterday. The minister arrived and stayed for 45 minutes, causing a pretty big crowd to gather around him, a priest said.

 The CPM, which has no official ban on religious practices but expects members to steer clear of them, avoided comment. The chief minister passed the ball to state secretary Biman Bose, who said he hadnt heard anything.

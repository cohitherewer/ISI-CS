 Demolition gets a push from court

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 9: The Supreme Court has said that granting a temporary injunction against demolition of unauthorised structures amounted to encouraging and perpetuating illegality.

 This court in numerous decisions has held that no consideration should be shown to the builder or any other person where construction is unauthorised, a bench headed by Justice S.B. Sinha said while rejecting a batch of appeals by unauthorised occupants in Mumbai.

 The court, however, noted that a stay on demolitions should not be vacated without giving the building owner an opportunity to establish by evidence that the structure was authorised and not illegal.

 In cases where prima facie case is made out, the balance of convenience automatically tilts in favour of plaintiff and a temporary injunction should be issued to preserve status quo, the court said.

 But where the owners do not make out a prima facie case for grant of an injunction and the documents produced clearly show that the structures are unauthorised, the court may not grant a temporary injunction merely on the ground of sympathy or hardship, the court said.

 Turning down the appeal against a Bombay High Court order, the apex court noted that the high court, in its appellate jurisdiction, was justified in vacating the temporary injunction granted by the trial court.

 Sonias bills of discontent

New Delhi, Aug. 25: Upstaged by the Left on a pet legislation and let down by her own government on two others, the monsoon session of Parliament has almost been a washout for Sonia Gandhi.

 The three legislations at the root of her discontent are the wildlife (protection) amendment bill that was passed today, the office-of-profit law and the right to information amendment bill that was shelved following wide protests.

 Congress sources said Sonia was unhappy at the way the CPM managed to push through 13 amendments to the wildlife bill, restoring tribals rights over forest land.

 The Congress chief had hoped to corner glory by doing just this through her pet project, the Scheduled Tribes (Regulation of Forest Rights) Bill, which is to be tabled in the winter session.

 The wildlife bill has taken the shine off the tribal bill. It has partially achieved what the latter set out to do, a Congress minister rued.

 Sonia had banked on the tribal bill to regain the ground lost to the BJP in the tribal belt, covering parts of Gujarat, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand and Orissa.

 The unending row over the profit law has been another bother. Government sources say the law is most likely to be struck down by the Supreme Court on the ground that it shouldnt have been passed in such a hurry when a joint House committee was considering the Presidents earlier queries on it. This will virtually end any chances of Sonia returning as National Advisory Council chief sometime soon.

 She is also bothered by reports of the governments fresh moves to dilute the provisions of the information act. The personnel and public grievances ministry is believed to be locked in battle with the central information commission on whether the act allows bureaucrats file notings to be made public.

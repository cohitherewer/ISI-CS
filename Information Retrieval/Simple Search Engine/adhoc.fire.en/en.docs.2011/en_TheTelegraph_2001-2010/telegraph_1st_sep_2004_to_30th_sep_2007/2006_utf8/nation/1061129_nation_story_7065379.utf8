 Widow of Hizb leader shot at 

 Srinagar, Nov. 28: Dr Shameema Badroo, the widow of former Hizb-ul Mujahideen chief commander Abdul Majid Dar, was shot at by a suspected militant inside her house in Lal Nagar on Tuesday night.

 DIG Farooq Ahmed said Badroo was hit by four bullets and is in a critical condition. 

 Dar had announced a unilateral ceasefire in 2001 which was well received by New Delhi. However, the ceasefire lasted only a month as the supreme commander of the outfit, Syed Salahuddin, opposed it. Dar was killed two years later.

 After her husbands death, Badroo floated an NGO, the Dar Foundation, to take care of orphans and widows.

 Militant boss killed

 The Hizb-ul Mujahideens topmost militant commander for south Kashmir and an army major were killed in a gun battle at an Anantnag village.

 Militants also targeted a group of tourists from Kerala at Tangmarg, injuring five of them and six local residents.

 A militant lobbed a grenade at the tourists at 3.15 pm at Tangmarg while they were returning from Gulmarg.

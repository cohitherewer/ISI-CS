 3 airports on Bengal radar

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, July 3: When investors are queuing up to put their money in the state, the Bengal government is planning three small airports to take travel facilities into the jet league. 

 Transport minister Subhas Chakraborty told the Assembly today that a plot in Dan-kuni on the Howrah-Hooghly border has been identified as one of the sites. 

 Close to the Bombay Road-Delhi Road junction, it measures around 330 acres. 

 The other two airports will be built by reviving defunct facilities at Chharra in Purulia district and Ambari in Jalpaiguri, Chakraborty said. 

 The project ? if it materialises ? would be a joint venture with the government having sufficient control. 

 Bengal now has only two airports ? at Calcutta and on the outskirts of Siliguri.

 The railway ministry owns the plot near Dankuni. Chak- raborty said transport department officials have already submitted the proposal with the railway brass in Delhi.

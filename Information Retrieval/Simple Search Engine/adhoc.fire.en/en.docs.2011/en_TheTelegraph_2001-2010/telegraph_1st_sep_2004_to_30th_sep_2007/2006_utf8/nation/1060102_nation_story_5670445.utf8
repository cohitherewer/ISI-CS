 Bus tax on schools

 GAJINDER SINGH

 Chandigarh, Jan. 1: The Haryana government has decided to tax school bus travel.

 Educational institutions will be levied an annual cess of Rs 60 for each seat. However, the institutions are expected to pass on the burden to students. 

 The government has also rescinded a 1970 order exempting educational institutions from paying passenger tax.

 The Haryana cabinet, which approved the decision after deferring a proposal to hike bus fares in the state, is also toying with the idea of allowing advertisements on school buses.

 We have found that schools have been charging nearly Rs 400 a month from each student availing the service and paying nothing to the government. The institutions were also indirectly getting enriched by enjoying exemption from payment of passenger tax. There are over 5,000 educational institutions that run school buses in the state. It will bring in some revenue. Some schools in the US have allowed advertisements on their buses, a minister said.

 Sources said the Bhupinder Singh Hooda-led Congress government, which came to power after a clean sweep earlier this year, is thinking of allowing school buses to carry advertisements by providing a yearly fee to the government.

 We have to look at newer avenues to generate funds and if buses can sport advertisements, there is no harm in allowing advertisements on school buses. We are looking at the proposal, a senior officer said.

 Commercial sponsors for school events like Founders Day and Sports Day and companies manufacturing sports goods are likely to be allowed to advertise their products on the buses.

 It is a very good idea. There are already too many hoardings in and around schools. Schools can benefit monetarily by allowing advertisements on buses ferrying students. But this is an idea that will raise the hackles of many academicians and even politicians. But it is a good idea, said Narinder Sikka, the owner of an advertising agency.

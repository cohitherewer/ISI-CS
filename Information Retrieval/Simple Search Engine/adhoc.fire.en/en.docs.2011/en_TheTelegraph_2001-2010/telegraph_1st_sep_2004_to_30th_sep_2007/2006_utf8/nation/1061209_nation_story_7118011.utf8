 Fury over boys body

 Lucknow, Dec. 8: A mob today burnt down Soro police station in Etah district of Uttar Pradesh and indulged in brickbatting after residents found the body of a four-year-old boy abducted last month.

 Police had to fire in the air to disperse the mob after at least five policemen were beaten up. The irate crowd also set afire two vehicles of the police station and blocked the Etah-Badaun highway after the incident.

 Etah district magistrate Ram Kumar said tension prevailed in the area and additional forces were being rushed to control the situation.

 Madhav, the son of Kamal Kishore Gupta, a doctor, was kidnapped from the Bandaria locality of the city on November 27. His body was found in a sack this morning. The abductors had demanded Rs 15 lakh from Gupta, which he had refused to pay.

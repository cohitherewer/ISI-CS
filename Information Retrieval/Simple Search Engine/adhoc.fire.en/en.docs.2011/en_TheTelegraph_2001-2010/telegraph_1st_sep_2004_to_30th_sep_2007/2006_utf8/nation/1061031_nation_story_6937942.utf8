 No funds, no seat increase, says IIM

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Bangalore, Oct. 30: The Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore, today lobbed the quota ball back to the Centres court and refused to increase seats till the ministry approves its proposals.

 Briefing reporters after the IIMB board headed by industrialist Mukesh Ambani met, institute director Prakash G. Apte said the IIMB has asked for Rs 130 crore over the next three years to enable it to increase its capacity by more than 50 per cent. 

 The cost includes acquisition of land for expanding the institute, he said, adding that not only buildings, more teaching aids were also needed.

 The oversight committee on reservation headed by Veerappa Moily had recommended that the IIMs increase the number of seats from the next academic year to fulfil the governments proposal of providing 27 per cent quota to OBC students in higher education.

 There was an acute shortage of quality teachers in the institute, Apte said, and the poor compensation made it difficult to fill the gap. 

 Last year, we offered positions to 12 candidates out of 15 interviewed, but only two joined us. The rest were wooed by the corporate sector and other business schools with better remuneration, he added.

 With the government refusing to revise the compensation package, the board decided on its own to increase compensation as suggested by a faculty committee.

 Apte said the revised package includes enhancement of incentive to teachers of executive programmes by 30 to 40 per cent and a modification of the compensation in consultancy projects.

 On IIMBs foray into Singapore, Apte said the institutes campus there is expected to be ready by next October.

 Cold start, quick thrust

 New Delhi, May 16: A strike corps of the Indian Army is now conducting war games in Punjab to validate a new doctrine of assault by land forces.

 The cold start doctrine, which envisages an assault on enemy territory without large-scale mobilisation, is being tested by a strike corps for the first time since it was adopted by the army last year.

 Codenamed Sanghe Shakti (unity in strength), the war games are being conducted by the Ambala-headquartered 2 Kharga Corps. In Hindu mythology, kharga is believed to be the weapon by which Durga slayed the demons. This is the first corps-level exercise since 2003.

 Sanghe-Shakti is a sequel to Vajra Shakti, held in May 2005, by the 11 Corps. Vajra Shakti tested select ways to convert holding or defensive formations (like the 11 Corps) into pivot formations, capable of causing quick damage to enemy defences with multiple thrusts. Basically, it meant that these select defensive formations are being equipped for an offensive role.

 Sanghe Shakti is designed to test techniques by which the strike corps can be put at the cutting edge of an offensive during which opening may have been created by the pivot formations.

 The exercise and the adoption of the new doctrine by the army is fairly transparent even if the tactical-level processes are not being put out for public knowledge. Military attach?s with about 25 foreign missions in New Delhi will be taken to the exercise area from the air force base at Halwara near Ludhiana tomorrow. Although the Chinese defence attach? is expected to be part of the team flown there, it is unlikely that the Pakistani military representative will be taken to the zone.

 Army sources said here today that as per confidence building measures that have been agreed between India and Pakistan, Islamabad has been kept informed. Besides, elements of the 2 Corps were unlikely to venture within 100 km of the border with Pakistan in accordance with the agreed norms. Unlike Vajra Shakti, there will be no live firing demonstrations this time.

 The series of exercises to validate the new army doctrine began in 2004 with Divya Astra that envisaged military operation in an NBC (nuclear-biological chemical warfare) threat environment. In the current exercise, too, the army will be using NBC protection equipment and processes to decontaminate personnel and equipment.

 Sanghe Shakti will be a demonstration of integrated air and ground operations. Mechanised forces, and T-90 tanks of an armoured division are likely to demonstrate offensive day and night operations, such as crossing waterbodies and canals. The strike corps drill will also involve networked systems with a tactical command headquarters using newly acquired information technology equipment to transmit images to combat forces and test battlefield-transparency techniques for precision strikes and minimal civilian casualties (collateral damage).

 It is expected that some of the tactics tested by the 2 Corps will also be tried out by other strike formations ? the 1 Corps and the 21 Corps ? in later war games.

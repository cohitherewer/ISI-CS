 Slap probe

 Calcutta, June 19: On Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees instructions, police today began a probe into a policeman slapping author Sunil Gangopadhyays driver.

 When the car stopped at a railway crossing at Barasat in North 24-Parganas on Friday, a policeman asked the driver to roll down the windowpane and slapped him as he did so.

 We are in the middle of an image-building exercise. This is a very serious matter, inspector-general, law and order, Raj Kanojia said.

 Muslims question PM inaction

 Aug. 22: Muslim leaders 

 who heard Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs speech yesterday 

 are asking why he has been unable to act on his good 

 intentions.

 At a meeting of community leaders 

 on terrorism, Singh had told them he understands 

 their suffering. Drawing a parallel with what Sikhs went 

 through during the Punjab militancy, he said there was no 

 need to equate terrorism with any community.

 But scholars and ulemas are pointing 

 to the UPA regimes inattentiveness towards core 

 issues concerning the Muslim community.

 Drawing a long list of areas of 

 neglect, the leaders, including some from the ruling Congress, 

 said it was still not too late to act. Some of the key demands 

 are:

 Replace NDA appointees as heads of the central Haj committee 

 and the Rs 1,000-crore minorities financial development 

 corporation

 Bring in a central act to streamline management of waqf 

 properties across the country worth thousands of crores

 Amend law to ensure that Muslim women get inheritance 

 share from agriculture

 Ensure representation of minorities in appointment committees 

 at all levels

 Speed up the CBI case against Babri demolition accused 

 like L.K. Advani, M.M. Joshi and Uma Bharti

 Ensure proper legal handling of the AMU minority status 

 case and the Andhra Pradesh governments move to 

 reserve jobs for Muslims.

 The leaders also had a list of grouses:

 The newly-created ministry for minorities affairs 

 is almost defunct

 Paradigm shift in Congresss foreign policy vis--vis 

 West Asia

 Announcement of 20,000 scholarships to minorities remains 

 on paper

 Poor representation of Muslims in sensitive bodies like 

 RAW, IB and SPG.

 Some speakers asked why the central 

 agencies were going slow against Narendra Modis handling 

 of the Gujarat riots. They asked home minister Shivraj Patil 

 to check if private religious institutions in Gujarat had 

 sought specialised services of Israel-based security agencies. 

 Patil was told that while madarsas 

 are constantly coming under scrutiny, the government was 

 paying no attention to the facts and figures 

 of Muslim socio-economic and educational indicators that 

 pointed to a high rate of dropouts, unemployment and other 

 social ills.

 Some leaders accused the Congress 

 of going back on time-tested policies like standing by Palestine. 

 They said it was ironic that when Israel was indulging in 

 aggression, some policy-makers here were talking about emulating 

 the country to deal with terrorism.

 A speaker recalled how Singh had 

 been happy to hear US President George W. Bush introduce 

 him to wife Laura as the Prime Minister of a country that 

 has a population of 120 million Muslims without a single 

 al Qaida member. 

 He wondered how things have changed 

 so much that senior government functionaries were now openly 

 talking about Qaida networks and operatives.

 With the Uttar Pradesh elections, 

 in which minority votes will play a crucial role, inching 

 closer, Singh and the Sonia Gandhi-led Congress have the 

 task cut out for them.

 Assault on dean

 Ahmedabad, Jan. 29: The dean of the Institute of Plasma Research in Gandhinagar and his family were attacked by two unidentified men who broke into their home today, reports our correspondent.

 Abhijeet Sen, 60, his wife Minal, 59, and daughter Ami, 30, who live behind Karnavati Club off the Sarkhej-Gandhinagar highway, were woken up by a noise around 2 am.

 When they tried to stop the intruders, the assailants pulled out a knife and slashed Sen and his wife in the face and hit them on their heads. Ami was also wounded.

 Police said the duo took away Rs 10,000, a mobile phone and some pieces of diamond-studded gold jewellery.

 After the burglars left, Sen contacted his neighbours, who took him and his wife to a nearby hospital. The couple, who had sustained serious injuries, are believed to be out of danger.

 The family had asked the two to take away whatever they wanted, but they attacked them with a sharp-edged weapon, Minals brother Ananth Seth said.

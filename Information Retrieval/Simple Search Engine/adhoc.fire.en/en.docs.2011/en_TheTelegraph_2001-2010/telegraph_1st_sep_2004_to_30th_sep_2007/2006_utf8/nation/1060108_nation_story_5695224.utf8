 VHP asks for Brinda apology

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 7: The Vishwa Hindu Parishad today called the CPM a party of traitors and anti-nationals and demanded an unconditional apology from senior leader Brinda Karat for her attack on yoga guru Ramdev.

 The CPM is a training ground for traitors and anti-nationals, the outfits chief, Ashok Singhal, said, as he launched an all-out attack against the party. That is why they are attacking two integral parts of Hindu culture ? Ayurveda and yoga.

 Singhal also demanded an explanation from Karat for her motivated campaign against the television guru whom she has accused of selling medicines with animal parts.

 The VHP, with its penchant for labelling most political opponents anti-national, had recently included L.K. Advani, too, in its list. Its star campaigner, Praveen Togadia, had jeered at Advani after the former BJP chiefs remarks praising Pakistans founder Mohammed Ali Jinnah and even called him a traitor on television.

 Singhal, while denying that the VHP ever used such strong words, could not contain his glee at Advanis recent ouster from the BJP chiefs post. Despite his colleagues efforts to focus the on the CPM, he showered praises on Advanis successor Rajnath Singh.

 The media exaggerated our differences (with Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Advani), said a VHP leader. But we are a happy joint family. Rajnath will prove that he has the ability to carry everyone along.

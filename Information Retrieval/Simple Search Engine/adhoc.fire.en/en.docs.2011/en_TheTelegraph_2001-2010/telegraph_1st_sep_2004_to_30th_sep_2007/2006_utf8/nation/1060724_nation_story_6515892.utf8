 Coimbatore attack claim

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chennai, July 23: The five suspected terrorists held in Coimbatore yesterday planned to blow up the railway station, a hospital and the offices of the district collector as well as the district and city police chiefs, investigators claimed today.

 A rough map seized from an accused and subsequent interrogation have revealed a plan to trigger blasts at eight places, police sources said. These include the Life Insurance Corporations zonal office and two busy commercial streets.

 Monday being public grievances hearing day at the collectors office, a blast would have caused heavy casualties. The textile city of Coimbatore suffered serial blasts in 1998.

 Police commissioner Karan Singha, however, admitted only to some truth in the claim about the eight blast targets. None of the five, held with bomb-making material, has been linked with Simi or Lashkar-e-Toiba. They were put in judicial remand today.

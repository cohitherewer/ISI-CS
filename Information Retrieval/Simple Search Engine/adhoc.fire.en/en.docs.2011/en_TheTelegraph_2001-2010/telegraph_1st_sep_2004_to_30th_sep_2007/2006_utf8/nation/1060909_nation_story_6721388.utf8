 New Delhi, Sept. 8: Amid fears that the Malegaon blasts might trigger sectarian clashes, the Centre today asked the states to tighten vigil and take religious leaders into confidence to maintain peace.

 President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh joined Congress chief Sonia Gandhi and BJP veteran A.B. Vajpayee in condemning the carnage and asking people to stay calm.

 Kalam wrote to Maharashtra chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh urging help for victims families and praying for early recovery of the injured.

 Asked whether the blasts implied an intelligence failure, especially after the Prime Minister had on Tuesday warned of such attacks, Union home minister Shivraj Patil said: Such incidents are unfortunate and we should concentrate on relief to people.

 Nobody so far has taken responsibility, but it seems that the blasts were triggered to fan communal tension, home secretary V.K. Duggal said.

 There is no expert information available right now about what kind of explosive was used. We have despatched a bomb-detection squad to find out the nature of the blasts.

 He said there had been intelligence about possible terrorist violence, and the states police and administration had been advised to watch out during festivals like Shab-e-Barat.

 Sources in the intelligence agencies suggested that the terrorists may have chosen to target Muslims this time because their earlier attacks in Ayodhya, Varanasi and Mumbai had failed to trigger a communal backlash.

 Officials in the home ministry and intelligence agencies refused to speculate which group may have been behind the blasts, but suggested that the terror modules involved in the July 11 Mumbai blasts and the March 7 strike on Varanasis Sankat Mochan temple may have had a hand.

 Both the Prime Ministers Office and Union home ministry have been receiving hourly updates from Maharashtra, senior officials said. The Centre has sent 20 companies of the Central Reserve Police Force and six companies of the Rapid Action Force to help the state government.

 If any incident of such nature is committed, their main aim is not only to target innocents but the bigger design is to ensure a clash between different sections of the society and a bloody situation, said Patil.

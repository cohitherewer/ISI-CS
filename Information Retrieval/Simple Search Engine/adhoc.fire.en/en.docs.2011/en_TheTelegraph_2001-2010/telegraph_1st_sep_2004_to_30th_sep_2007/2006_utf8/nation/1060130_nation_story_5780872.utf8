 Split prayers in peace plan

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Bhopal, Jan. 29: A formula has been put in place to avert a communal clash at Bhojshala on February 3 when Hindus and Muslims will gather at the disputed 11th-century monument in Madhya Pradesh for the Basant Panchami yagna and Friday namaz.

 The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), local authorities and leaders of both communities have agreed that the Hindus will mark Saraswati Janmotsava from sunrise till 12.30 pm, while the Jumma namaz will be offered between 1 pm and 3 pm. From 3 pm, the Hindus will again be allowed to have darshan and offer worship.

 The BJP and a radical group, the Hindu Jagran Manch, insist that the Bhojshala-Kamal Maula mosque was originally a Saraswati temple, built by Raja Bhoj several hundred years ago.

 Bhojshala, in Dhar district, has witnessed several violent clashes since 1952 when Hindus first celebrated Bhoj Divas at the structure. This prompted Muslims to hold an urs (religious congregation) there in November 1953. 

 By 1995, Muslims were being allowed to offer Friday prayers at the monument while Hindus were congregating there on Basant Panchami. They are also allowed to pray on Tuesdays.

 This year, communal tension has heightened with Basant Panchami falling on a Friday.

 State minister Kailash Vijayvargiya visited Dhar yesterday to hold talks with community leaders. He assured the Muslims they would be allowed to hold their Friday prayers at the structure on February 3. But the Manch is still insisting that Muslims make way for Saraswati puja through the day.

 They (the Muslims) pray there every week whereas Basant Panchami falls once in a year. Why can they not make a concession and create an atmosphere of goodwill? asked Manch leader Radhey Shyam Yadav.

 The Manchs stand has alarmed local Muslim leaders. Waqar Qureshi, a resident, said: There is considerable build-up by the Manch. They plan to gather over one lakh people. How will 1,000-odd namazis gain access to the mosque?

 Our experience is that police do not act swiftly in emergencies. We are keeping our fingers crossed.

 The state director-general of police, Swaraj Puri, promised the day would pass peacefully. The rule of law will prevail, he said.

 For all the Manchs insistence that the Bhojshala complex is a Saraswati temple, when its activists gather there each year during Basant Panchami, they sing praises to Ram without mentioning Saraswati in their prayers.

 ASI records say the factual identity of the present structure is not definitely known, nor can it be ascertained from the study of the structure itself. In its records, the ASI maintains that the structure is neither a mosque nor a temple but a protected monument of national importance.

 Historically, a Parmar king named Bhoj ruled from a place called Dharnagri. He was a patron of literature, music and the fine arts. The ASI says Bhojs Dharnagri could be the present-day Dhar on the Malwa plateau.

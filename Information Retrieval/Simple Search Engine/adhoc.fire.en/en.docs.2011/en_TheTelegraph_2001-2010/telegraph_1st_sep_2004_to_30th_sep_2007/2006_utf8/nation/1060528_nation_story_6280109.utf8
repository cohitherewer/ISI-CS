 Amitabh for Aamir

 New Delhi, May 27 (PTI): Amitabh Bachchan today said Aamir Khan has every right to express his opinion as long as he stays within the purview of the Constitution.

 Every person has the right to express his views... Our country is a democratic republic and every person enjoys the freedom to say whatever he wants and express his opposition, he said. Khans detractors also have the same right, the actor added. 

 BJP raises pitch

 The BJP today accused Aamir Khan of defaming it and demanded an apology for his comments against the party in TV interviews.

 He called the BJP a party of rioters. He defamed the party and we demand an apology from him, BJP cultural cell co-convener Gajendra Chauhan said.

 D-link net cast for politician

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Jan. 16: Mumbai police are likely to arrest more suspects, including a prominent south Mumbai politician said to be associated with Dawood Ibrahim, in connection with a terror plot, sources said.

 Officials of the anti-terrorist squad were tight-lipped, but sources said police commissioner Anami Roy held a meeting with senior officers at the ATS headquarters this evening. 

 The south Mumbai politician, who owns a travel agency and a popular nightspot, has been under the scanner for suspected links with Dawoods gang. 

 The police are also probing a recent visit by Dawoods Mumbai-based sister Hasina Parkar to Jammu and Kashmir. The sources said the police were investigating how over Rs 20 lakh was funnelled into Jammu and Kashmir from Mumbai. 

 Maulana Ghulam Yahya Allah Baksh, the 42-year-old imam from Bengal arrested on Saturday, was interrogated for the second consecutive day for suspected role as the financial conduit.

 A police team today visited Bakshs village in North 24-Parganas, ATS sources said.

 Baksh had moved to Mumbai in 1994 and worked as the imam of the mosque on the third floor of Haj House in south Mumbai.

 He is suspected to have given shelter to Mohammed Ramzan Qazi, a suspected Lashkar operative arrested earlier this month.

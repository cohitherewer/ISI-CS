 Partners spar over nuke goalpost

 OUR BUREAU

 Manmohan Singh

 New Delhi, July 26: Congress leaders today tried to dissuade Left parties from insisting on a Parliament resolution on the US nuclear deal, but the allies remained firm on a tangible assurance that the government wont shift the goalposts.

 The sense of the House must be expressed, CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury said after parliamentary affairs minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi asked the Rajya Sabha MP not to press for the resolution.

 While the Left was adamant, hectic efforts were on by defence minister Pranab Mukherjee and Das Munshi as well as Sonia Gandhis political secretary Ahmed Patel to settle for a discussion based on a statement Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is expected to make in Parliament next week.

 Congress sources said while they saw some merit in the Lefts argument for a resolution that would reflect the collective sense of Parliament on the milestone deal and set the parameters of Indias position on it, the document might get bogged down in semantics.

 The Lefts contention is while the July 18, 2005 statement, inked by Singh and President George W. Bush, was subject to scrutiny and voting by US legislative bodies, why should the Indian Parliament remain a mute spectator?

 The Congresss point is the Left should first hear out the Prime Minister and seek clarifications and, if still unconvinced, move a resolution.

 Mukherjee met Left parliamentary leaders this morning and assured them the government had nothing to conceal. He then briefed party chief Sonia.

 The Congress parliamentary committee met in the evening. The Prime Minister was not present but was expected to confer with Mukherjee and home minister Shivraj Patil tonight on the ramifications of the proposed resolution.

 Congress sources said they were concerned about a meeting senior Rajya Sabha members had on the resolution with House chairperson Bhairon Singh Shekhawat. They included K. Natwar Singh, who was replaced as foreign minister, Jaswant Singh, Digvijay Singh (Janata Dal-United), Amar Singh and Yashwant Sinha.

 The hectic parleys came on a day the Prime Minister told the Lok Sabha his government would not accept any new US condition for the deal.

 I wish to assure the House that we will never compromise in a manner which is inconsistent with the provisions of the joint statement of July 18, he said.

 Singh intervened briefly during question hour while junior foreign minister Anand Sharma answered queries on the deal.

 In the 25-minute discussion, neither the government nor the MPs went into specifics. But Delhis concerns seem to centre on issues like the provision requiring annual certification by the US President on Indias nuclear programme, and the possibility of future restrictions on fuel supplies for reactors.

 Left sources said the resolution they had in mind would state Indias position on precisely these concerns. So why should the government worry? asked an MP.

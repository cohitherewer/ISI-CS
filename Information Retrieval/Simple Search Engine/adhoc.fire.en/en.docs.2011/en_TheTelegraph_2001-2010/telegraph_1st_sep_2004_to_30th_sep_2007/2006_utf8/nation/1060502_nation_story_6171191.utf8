 Powerless Delhi sweats

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 1: A power cut left over 30 lakh people in south and east Delhi sweltering for several hours today as the Badarpur power plant was shut down while the peak demand shot up to 3,200 mw, leaving a shortfall of 478 mw.

 The Badarpur power plant had to be shut down as the Ballabgarh-Badarpur line tripped following a fault in the 400 kv sub-station in Ballabgarh, an official said.

 While there was a shortfall of 172 mw in the supply from the Dadri power plant, the Singrauli power project supplied 49 mw less, Rehand 60 mw less and Nathpa Jakhri 49 mw less.

 Delhis Indraprastha and Rajghat power plants also supplied 42 mw and 57.5 mw less than their capacities, the official said.

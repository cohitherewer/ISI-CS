 President hoax arrest

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chennai, Sept. 6: A 21-year-old jewellery shop salesman was arrested this evening for allegedly making the bomb-hoax call that delayed President A.P.J. Abdul Kalams flight by over three hours late on Monday. 

 Cyber crime sleuths picked up Perinbaraj, a salesman with well-known jeweller GRT Thanga Maligai in T. Nagar, after they traced the call to a PCO box in the jewellery shop. 

 Since the caller ID in the police control room did not display the full number, the sleuths relied on closed-circuit TVs in the shop and tracked down the culprit on the basis of the call time, sources said.

 The call was made to the control room in Chennai police commissioners office around 10.35 pm on Monday, saying a bomb had been kept in the governors aircraft. Police scanned the special IAF jet that was to fly the President to Delhi and the plane took off around 2 am on Tuesday.

 The hoax left security forces, including Chennai police which had thrown a five-tier shield around Kalam, reeling.

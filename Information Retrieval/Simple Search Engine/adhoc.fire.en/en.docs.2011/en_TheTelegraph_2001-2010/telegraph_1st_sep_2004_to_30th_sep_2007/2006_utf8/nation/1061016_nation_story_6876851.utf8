 Thane sets a sunny example

 - Solar 

 power warms 7000 homes in Mumbai suburb 

 ANANYA SENGUPTA

 Mumbai, Oct. 15: The sun never sets in Thane.

 As evening falls and shadows lengthen, the good old ball of fire, now hidden somewhere in the darkening sky, shines down from the street lamps.

 Cosmic magic?

 Not really. Its solar power.

 At a time when an energy crisis looms on the country, Thane has saved up to Rs 3.9 crore in electricity bills in the last five years by tapping solar energy and other unconventional energy sources like waste.

 That is not all. Up to 7,000 households have been convinced to use solar heating systems while about 25 big commercial establishments are already using them.

 We have made it mandatory for hotels and other commercial establishments to use solar heating systems. Also, all new buildings in Thane will get a no-objection certificate only when they install solar heating apparatus. We have educated the main stakeholders involved in the procedure like builders, architects, solar heater manufacturers and plumbers, says Thane municipal commissioner Sanjay Sethi.

 Even old buildings that want to go for solar heating will get a 10 per cent rebate on property tax.

 Two years ago, the corporation introduced solar panels at Rajiv Gandhi Medical College. The system could heat 19,050 litres of water everyday and the electricity bill dropped by Rs 9 lakh. Buoyed by the success, the technology was soon adopted in other hospitals run by the civic body.

 This shows that solar water heating is not something thats only on paper. It can be commercially viable through this project, says Sethi, the man behind the conservation drive.

 Sethi and deputy city engineer S.D. Pote agree that the initial investment for a household, which comes to about Rs 15,000, is a little high. But the payback, they say, is quick.

 You get back your investment in two-three years. In fact, you end up saving about Rs 5,000 every year. But again, this depends on the amount of consumption. Even banks have come forward with interest-free loans, says Pote.

 The corporation has been conducting workshops for housing societies, builders, developers and architects and distributing pamphlets to popularise the drive.

 Sethi says the move to tap unconventional sources of energy has not only brought down electricity bills but has also cut down on emission of gases like carbon dioxide.

 The ministry of non-conventional energy resources has lauded the efforts and circulated the Thane model. It should interest other cities because the only way so far to deal with power shortage is power cuts.

 With solar energy, theres no such danger of shortage. Unless, of course, the sun one day decides it wouldnt rise again.

 But then, if that day ever comes, its doubtful if anybody would be left on this earth to wonder why the streetlights arent coming on.

 Priyanka picks lucky 20

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 21: After an excruciating wait, a lucky 20 have been granted passport and a one-day visa to cross the Lucknow border.

 With Congress eager beavers moving heaven and earth to work for Sonia Gandhis election in Rae Bareli, the Gandhi family has shed its reluctance to allow outsiders on the hallowed turf.

 Priyanka Vadra, who will help brother Rahul manage the campaign, has picked the 20 who will have the privilege of setting foot in Rae Bareli and moving around in the heat and dust for one day each.

 The list includes state Congress chief Salman Khursheed, central ministers Mahavir Prasad and Sriprakash Jaiswal, Sachin Pilot and Jitin Prasada ? who are members of Rahuls youth brigade ? Motilal Vora, Pramod Tiwari, Rita Bahuguna, Mohsina Kidwai, Rashid Alvi, Ashok Gehlot and R.P.N. Singh.

 The briefs of the chosen ones, who have been asked to come after April 25, are different. If Pilot is asked to campaign in backward caste pockets (he is a Gujjar), Singh, a legislator from Padrauna in eastern Uttar Pradesh, will help with scrutiny of the voter list, booth management and voter mobilisation.

 Initially, the Gandhis had planned to manage Rae Bareli with the crack team of Rahul, Priyanka and family loyalist Satish Sharma. The rest, including the state party chief and the central general secretary in charge of the state, were politely told to keep away.

 Our Delhi visa office will not issue visas to any outsider. Nobody will be allowed to cross the Lucknow border, a Congress veteran had joked.

 But later, it was felt that more hands would mean better management of the nitty-gritty. Besides, sources claimed, the Gandhi family was keen to bust the myth that they saw Amethi and Rae Bareli as their fiefs ? so the break with tradition to engage the rest of the party.

 Although the Congress expects a hands-down victory, sources said the party would have made a political point only if Sonia improves considerably on her 2004 margin of 2.5 lakh votes. The target, therefore, is between 3 lakh and 4 lakh.

 Voter complacency and the summer heat are the two worries. If a voter thinks Sonias victory is certain, he or she may not bother to turn up. If the turnout falls, so may her margin, said a source.

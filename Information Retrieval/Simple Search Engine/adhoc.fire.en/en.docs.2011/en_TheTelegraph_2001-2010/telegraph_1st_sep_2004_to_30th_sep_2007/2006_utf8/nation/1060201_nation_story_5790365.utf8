 Officers hostage

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Jamshedpur, Jan. 31: Three unsuspecting executives of Jindal Steel today paid the price for venturing into Asanboni, 15 km from here, without the permission of local villagers. 

 A violent and abusive mob kept them hostage for nearly two hours before the police rushed to rescue them. A few months ago, officials of Bhushan Steel, too, had to face hostile villagers, who held them captive.

 A director of Jindal Steel amp; Power Limited, B. Goyal, chief executive officer B.M. Gujral and senior general manager Avijit Ghosh were scouting the area where Jindal plans to invest Rs 11,000 crore for a steel factory and a captive power plant. A circle officer and a villager were with them. The circle officer said the villagers threatened us with dire consequences if we visited again.

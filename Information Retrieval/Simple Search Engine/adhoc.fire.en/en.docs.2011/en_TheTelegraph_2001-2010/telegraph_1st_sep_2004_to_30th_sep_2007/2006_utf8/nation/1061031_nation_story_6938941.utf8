 Fine for gas burst death

 Up in flames 

 New Delhi, Oct. 30 (PTI): Oil major Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) and one of its Delhi-based gas agencies have been directed to pay Rs 10.08 lakh as compensation to the family of a person who died in a fire caused by a defective cylinder 11 years ago.

 Suresh Kumar Govilkar, an engineer, was fitting the regulator on the defective cylinder when it caught fire. His wife Madhuri Govilkar, along with her two children, had sought compensation from HPCL and Pelicon Gas Agency after he died. 

 The National Consumer Commission held that HPCL and the agency were liable for deficiency of service as they had supplied a defective cylinder.

 There is apparent deficiency in the manufacturing of the LPG cylinder, which was found burning all around the periphery of the bottom lip of the regulator with dense yellow flames, the commission bench headed by Justice M.B. Shah said.

 Directing the oil major and the agency to pay the compensation to Govilkars family within eight weeks with interest of 9 per cent per annum, the bench said the gas agency could recover its share from National Insurance Company Ltd.

 Earlier, the commission rejected the HPCL and its agencys contention that when Govilkar had tried to replace the regulator on August 26, 1995, there was an unusual sound.

 There is nothing on record to suggest that the so-called unusual sound was (so) alarming... that the deceased would think of calling a person from the office of the dealer for fixing the regulator of the gas cylinder, the commission observed.

 The apex consumer body also noted a typical negative approach by officers of National Insurance Company Ltd, who had advised the gas agency not to make any admission of compensation without prior consent.

 Such type of preparation of false defence increases the litigation in this country. In any case, such defence on the part of the nationalised insurance company is totally unjustifiable, it said.

 The gas agency had informed the insurance company within four days of the accident.

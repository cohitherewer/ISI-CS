 Bush prod 

 Washington, Feb. 4 (PTI): For the third time in four days, President George W. Bush has acknowledged that economic competition from India and China was giving rise to some uncertainty among Americans. But he again cautioned his countrymen against turning protectionist.

 Yes, weve got a lot of competition, and people begin to see an emerging China, and India, and that makes people uncertain, Bush said.

 But the President, who was speaking in New Mexico, warned Americans against turning inward or protectionist, saying these were not prescriptions for competition.

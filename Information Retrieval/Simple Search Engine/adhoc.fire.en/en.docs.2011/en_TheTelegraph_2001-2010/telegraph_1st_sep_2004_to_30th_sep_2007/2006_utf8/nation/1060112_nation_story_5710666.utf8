 Ottavio gets Bofors breather

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 11: India has told British authorities that it has no evidence linking Ottavio Quattrocchis frozen bank accounts in London with the Bofors payoffs. Therefore, the Italian businessmans two accounts with the BSI AG bank, holding 3 million euros and $1 million, may be defreezed.

 Under the law ministrys instructions, additional solicitor-general B. Datta conveyed this to the Crown Prosecutor Service on December 22 during a visit to Britain.

 The Crown Prosecutor Service, which had been hired by the CBI to fight the Bofors case, has passed the information on to the British high court dealing with the case.

 In July 2003, a British court had ordered that the two bank accounts ? 5a51 516L and 5a51 516M ? would continue to remain frozen.

 Quattrocchi (in picture above) had appealed against this in various courts but failed to secure reprieve. The Court of Appeal in the UK, which is part of the Supreme Court of Judicature, had upheld the dismissal of Quattrocchis petition.

 The CBI had contended in its petition to the British authorities in 2003 that Quattrocchi, one of the main accused in the Rs 64-crore Bofors scam, in a deceitful manner... had been transferring the funds from one account to another to evade detection by the law.

 The agency had also claimed that the amount of ?3 million stashed in the accounts was part of $73.43 lakh paid to him (Quattrocchi) by AB Bofors through AE Services.

 Quattrocchi says he was not involved in the Bofors payoffs and had been targeted for political reasons.

 Action to shift to Calcutta 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Dalmiya: No relief yet

 Mumbai, March 31: A Mumbai police team will travel to Calcutta next week to question former BCCI chief Jagmohan Dalmiyas employee K.M. Choudhary on some transactions he carried out in the boards Indian Overseas Bank account.

 Mumbai police today grilled Dalmiya along with his associates ? former board secretary S.K. Nair and former treasurers Jyoti Bajpai and Kishore Rungta ? for the fourth day today in connection with the alleged embezzlement of BCCI funds to the tune of Rs 21.74 lakh in Indian Overseas Banks Bhowanipore branch in Calcutta.

 The investigation is now poised to shift to Calcutta.

 Dalmiya, who went to Calcutta on Wednesday evening, returned to Mumbai this morning. Bombay High Court had earlier directed him and his aides to be present for inquiries on March 27, 28, 29, and 31 in Mumbai and on April 3 to 5 in Calcutta.

 The former BCCI chief refused to speak on the interrogation, saying his anticipatory bail plea was pending before the high court. The petition will be heard on April 10 after the police submit a formal report on its seven-day investigation. We have no statement to make, Dalmiyas lawyer Satish Maneshinde said. 

 The focus of the investigation will now shift to the cricket boards Indian Overseas Bank account. As the convener-secretary of Pilcom, the joint organiser of the 1996 World Cup, Dalmiya operated account no. 1223 till February 4 this year. He closed it after losing the annual board elections to the Sharad Pawar-led panel. 

 An FIR filed by present BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah alleged that Choudhary had carried out certain transactions on behalf of Dalmiya without being authorised by the board. Payments were made to firms like SG Traders and Voyage, the FIR said. 

 In his complaint, Shah has also alleged collusion between officials of the Indian Overseas Bank and Dalmiya. It said bank officers refused to allow BCCI officials to enter its premises or access any details pertaining to account no. 1223. 

 The Mumbai police team, which will quiz Choudhary, will also meet the banks officials for detailed information on the account. The team will take the help of Calcutta police if necessary, sources said.

 Dalmiya and his associates were scheduled to leave for Calcutta tonight to be present for the Monday inquiry. The Calcutta inquiry is largely about the bank accounts and Choudhary, but Nair, Rungta, and Bajpai have also been asked to be present though they have no role to play, an aide of Dalmiya said.

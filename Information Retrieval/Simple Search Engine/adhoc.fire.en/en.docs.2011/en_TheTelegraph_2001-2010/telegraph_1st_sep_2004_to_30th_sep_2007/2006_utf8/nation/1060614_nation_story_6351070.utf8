 New Delhi, June 13: Top Left leaders hit the streets of the capital and courted arrest today as the communists, who shore up the Congress-led central coalition, renewed their public protest against the recent increase in petrol and diesel prices.

 The protests came on a day political activists stopped trains and buses across India and truckers kept off the roads as a one-day strike against the hike took hold.

 CPM general secretary Prakash Karat said the UPA government ignored the Lefts suggestions to slash excise and customs duties on crude oil, which could have prevented the price rise.

 He was equally critical of the Centres efforts to get the states to slash state-level taxes on petrol and diesel. The Centre should reduce the taxes instead of passing the burden on to the states, the CPM leader told a public meeting.

 (Prime Minister) Manmohan Singh should realise that the prices of essential commodities are going up and the latest increase will further raise the price of basic foods for ordinary people, Karat said.

 The CPM chief courted arrest with fellow comrades Sitaram Yechury (CPM), A.B. Bardhan (CPI), Abani Roy (RSP) and the Forward Blocs Debabrata Biswas and G. Devarajan as they launched a nationwide agitation against the hike.

 The protest began two days before the UPA-Left coordination committee is scheduled to meet in Delhi after three months. Top leaders of the four Left parties met this morning to decide Thursdays agenda.

 Although the leaders talked tough, sources said they are unlikely to take any hard political decision that could destabilise the government, which they support. We are going to give a note to the government underlining our areas of concern, said a leader. We want an agenda-based discussion.

 In Delhi, over one thousand communist supporters shouted slogans and burnt effigies of the Prime Minister before being detained by police.

 Fruit and vegetable markets in the financial hub of Mumbai were also hit as hundreds of trucks stopped plying. In Kerala, the strike was total in all parts of the state.

BJP gears up

 The BJP will intensify its anti-price rise agitation with all central leaders fanning out in the remotest districts to address rallies on June 19.

 Pranab No. 2 crown intact

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 Pranab Mukherjee

 New Delhi, Nov. 27: Pranab Mukherjees status as No. 2 in Manmohan Singhs cabinet will remain undisturbed despite the heavy travel schedule his assignment as foreign minister entails.

 When the matter of moving Mukherjee from the defence to the foreign ministry was discussed, one of the points involving protocol that arose was what would happen if a particular trip abroad requires his and the Prime Ministers presence simultaneously.

 Who would preside over an emergency cabinet meeting in Manmohans absence and respond to unexpected contingencies, triggered by internal or external circumstances?

 The question of choosing a No. 2 in such a situation was a bit tricky as, according to the official pecking order, it would have to be human resource development minister Arjun Singh.

 Congress sources said the odds were stacked against Arjun as he did not enjoy the 100 per cent confidence of either Manmohan or UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi. Besides, he was not a member of the cabinet committee on security affairs.

 The number two status impinges on strategic issues, especially after India and Pakistan have become nuclear, said a source.

 Defence minister A.K. Antony could have been a choice but he is too new in the cabinet.

 Home minister Shivraj Patil is number six in the hierarchy, after Sharad Pawar and Lalu Prasad. Although Manmohan and Sonia trust him fully, it was felt that anointing him No. 2 might ruffle the feathers of key allies like the Nationalist Congress Party and the Rashtriya Janata Dal.

 The first test case would have arisen in December when Manmohan will travel to Cebu (in the Philippines) and Japan from December 10-16.

 But it was decided that Mukherjee would not accompany him. Instead, he will be off to Cebu to attend the East Asia summit foreign ministers meeting on December 9-10.

 Manmohans flight is expected to take off from Delhi on December 10, a little after Mukherjees touches down so that there is no vacuum at the top.

 Congress sources said there was perfect coordination between the working of the No. 1 and the No. 2 even after Mukherjee moved into the foreign ministry. In future, too, efforts would be made to ensure they were not out of the country simultaneously.

 Varsity in Pawar award spot

 Nagpur (PTI): Union agriculture minister Sharad Pawar and Maharashtra governor S.M. Krishna have cancelled their proposed visit to a university for its convocation on Sunday following controversy over an award that was to be conferred on Pawar.

 The Maharashtra Animal and Fishery Sciences University in Nagpur had decided to confer its highest award ? the Gopal Ratna ? on the agriculture minister. But the decision has come in for sharp criticism from a section of academicians and politicians in the region, who questioned Pawars contribution to Vidarbha in the field of agriculture and animal husbandry, sources said.

 A section of the students, under the banner of Maharashtra Rajya Pashuvydhika Vidyarthi Sangathana, has decided to boycott the convocation in protest against 797 posts of livestock development officers lying vacant.

 Crash heat on NRI student

 Both friends were enrolled in the Running Start programme at Bellevue Community College. They were racing south along Coal Creek parkway at speeds estimated at 70 to 90 mph when Rishi lost control of his BMW and crashed into oncoming traffic.

 Srinagar, Oct. 23: People across Kashmir went on a shopping spree today, flocking markets and roadside stalls ahead of Id-ul-Fitr.

 The festival marks the end of Ramazan, the month of fasting in the Islamic calendar. Id will be celebrated on Wednesday in the state.

 Roads in Srinagar were choked with traffic and shoppers busy buying mutton, chicken, sweets and clothes.

 The sales have brought cheer for the business community. We have no time to rest. For the last three days, there has been an unending stream of people visiting our shop, said Masood Ahmad, who works at Shakti Sweets, a confectionery shop.

 Khursheed Ahmad Shah, secretary-general of the Kashmir Traders and Manufacturers Federation, said the markets have been doing very well over the last two days. Three days ago, our sales were grim because of the fear that Mohammad Afzal will be hanged, he said. But after the news (that the hanging has been deferred) we are doing brisk sales.

 The heavy traffic plunged the roads in chaos. Manzoor Ahmad Lone, a schoolteacher, said it took him over an hour to cover a 1-km stretch in his vehicle on Srinagars Residency Road. 

 A string of beauty parlours at Bund, on the bank of the Jhelum in the city, also attracted a large number of women.

 A few days before Id, the state government announced payment of dearness allowance to its staff. We will pay dearness allowance that will cost us Rs 200 crore, said finance minister Tariq Qarra. We have already released Rs 55 crore.

 Despite militancy claiming a heavy toll over the last 16 years, the markets except for some years after violence broke out were never robbed of sheen during Id-ul-Fitr and Id-ul-Zuha celebrations.

 Mudassir Hussain, a student at Sri Pratab College, said there are only a few occasions to celebrate in Kashmir. This is the best catharsis available for us and we pray there are no attacks on these days.

 Security forces are keeping a continuous vigil to prevent any untoward incident. Police sources said patrols have been increased and security forces directed to be friendly with the people. 

 The month of Ramazan has seen no let-up in violence as militants continued attacks on the forces. A Ramazan ceasefire proposed by chief minister Ghulam Nabi Azad did not materialise, reportedly because of the Centres reluctance.

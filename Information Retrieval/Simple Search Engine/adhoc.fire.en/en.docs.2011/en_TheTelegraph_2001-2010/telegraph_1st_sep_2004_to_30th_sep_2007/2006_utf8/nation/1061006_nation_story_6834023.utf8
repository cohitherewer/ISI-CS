 Pay panel formed

 New Delhi, Oct. 5 (PTI): 

 The Centre today set up the sixth pay commission, headed 

 by Justice B.N. Srikrishna, to review the wages of its nearly 

 33 lakh employees, whose salaries were last reworked a decade 

 ago.

 The four-member panel, with a term of 18 months, will also examine the desirability of interim relief for employees till the final salary structure is announced, an official notification said.

 Besides central government employees, it will also recommend a new pay structure for armed forces personnel and the staff of regulatory bodies. An additional annual burden of Rs 20,000 crore on the central exchequer is expected as a result.

 Commission chairman Justice Srikrishna is a retired Supreme Court judge. The other members are Ravindra Dholakia, a senior faculty member at IIM Ahmedabad, J.S. Mathur, a former secretary of the expenditure reforms commission, and Sushma Nath, former additional secretary in the department of agriculture. Nath is the member-secretary.

 The commission will also make recommendations on pension and gratuity for employees appointed before January 1, 2004. Employees recruited after this date are under the defined contributory pension scheme instead of the defined benefit scheme.

 Recommendations on bonus payment and the feasibility of a productivity-linked incentive scheme are also expected.

 The commission will suggest ways to transform central government organisations into modern, professional and citizen-friendly entities.

 The recommendations of the fifth pay panel were implemented in 1996-97. The economic survey for 2005-06 had pointed out that after the implementation, the general fiscal deficit increased every year to reach a peak of 9.9 per cent in 2001-02. 

 The government has said that this time all efforts would be made to ensure that the Centre and states are not put to any financial difficulty.

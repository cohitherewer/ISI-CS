 Bus blast

 Chandigarh, April 28: At least 17 persons were injured in a blast in a Punjab Roadways bus in Jalandhar today.

 The blast occurred when the bus, on its way to Nangal from Amritsar, was heading towards the exit of a bus bay around 3.30 pm. It had about 45 people on board, including the conductor and the driver.

 I heard a loud bang and saw flames emanating from the front windows. The flames engulfed the bus within moments, said an eyewitness, Dalbir Singh. Many with burn injuries ran out shrieking for help.

 Fourteen injured were rushed to the civil hospital. Most of them had suffered 40 to 60 per cent burns.

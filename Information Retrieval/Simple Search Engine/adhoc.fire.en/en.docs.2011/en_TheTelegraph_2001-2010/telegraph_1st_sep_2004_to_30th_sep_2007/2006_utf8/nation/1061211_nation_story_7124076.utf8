 J amp;K plans second ski resort

 Srinagar (PTI): The Jammu and 

 Kashmir government has decided to open a resort for winter 

 sports at Yusmarg, the second in the state after Gulmarg, 

 early next year.

 Yusmarg, which has remained a favourite trekking and picnic spot, has tremendous potential as a ski-destination owing to its slopes. We will organise training camps and a one-day ski competition there in February, tourism director Farooq Ahmed Shah said. 

 The opening of Yusmarg to winter sports will definitely help boost tourism and winter sports, he added. The development of infrastructure will help it become a top-notch ski-resort. 

 Yusmarg, at an altitude of 7,500 ft, is second only to Gulmarg in terms of skiing potential. Situated in the south-east of the Kashmir valley, Yusmarg has a number of valleys that make it very suitable for ski-touring. 

 AIIMS tussle

 New Delhi (PTI): Health minister 

 Anbumani Ramadoss has scrapped the decision to transfer 

 the AIIMS registrar to a rural centre.

 Moon committee

 New Delhi (PTI): Muslim clerics 

 have gathered at the Jama Masjid to discuss the formation 

 of a central moon sighting committee that will be the final 

 authority on deciding festival dates.

 Eve tease case

 Ahmedabad (PTI): Police have registered a complaint against VHP leader Babu Bajrangi and some Bajrang Dal and Durgavahini activists for allegedly beating up eve-teasers near two colleges. As no one came to file a complaint against them, the police decided to register it.

 Migratory flamingoes, which have 

 been visiting Mumbai every winter since 1994, have been 

 sighted for the first time this year. Scientists have spotted 

 about 40 of them in the city.

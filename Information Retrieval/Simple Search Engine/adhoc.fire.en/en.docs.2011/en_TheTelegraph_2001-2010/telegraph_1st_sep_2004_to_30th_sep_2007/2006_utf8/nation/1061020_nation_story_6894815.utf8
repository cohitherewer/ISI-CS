 Remake, why not?

 Zeenat Aman on Don, old and new

 I remember Don as a wonderful experience. (Director) Chandra Barot, Amitabh Bachchan, (producer-cameraman) Nariman Irani we had all already worked in Manoj Kumars Roti Kapada Aur Makaan.

 So, we just progressed from there on to Don. It was a lot of fun during the making of the film even though it took some time. 

 But we were all so sad when Narimanji passed away six months before the release of the film. We tried to do our best for his family. I dont know about others but I didnt take my money, my fee for Don.

 Then Don released and went on to be such a big hit. The songs, the scenes, the characters they all became very popular and it has grown over the years. 

 I cant myself talk about my chemistry with Amitji but people did like it whenever we came together on screen. Besides Don, we have other hit films like Lawaaris and Great Gambler.

 Its wonderful that Don is being remade. I ask why not? Its like old wine in new bottle. Devdas was remade in such a huge way. So, why not? 

 Absolutely! Indian cinema has progressed so much technologically in these 28 years. So why not make the film again for new audiences in a new way? Dont know about others but Im looking forward to watch the film.

 I am happy that Priyanka Chopra is doing my role. Shes doing so well for herself and I am sure she will do a great Roma. Her character will have a great impact on the film. 

 And what do I say about Shah Rukh? Shah Rukh is Shah Rukh. Who else can play Don today?

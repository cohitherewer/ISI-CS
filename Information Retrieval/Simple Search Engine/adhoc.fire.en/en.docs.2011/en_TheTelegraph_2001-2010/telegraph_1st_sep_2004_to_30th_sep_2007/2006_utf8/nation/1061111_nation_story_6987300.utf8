 Delhi mass-killer hangs himself

 New Delhi: A man accused of having killed 

 seven members of a family in Delhi in one of the most chilling 

 mass-murders in recent times hanged himself to death in 

 his Tihar jail cell, police said.

 Sanjay Rathore, who is alleged to have killed his uncle, aunt and their five children in Inderlok on the night of July 30-31, was found hanging from a pipe running above his cell on Friday, the police said.

 Sanjay is believed to have killed the family of seven with a weapon akin to a butchers knife, after his uncle Om Prakash humiliated him.

 According to the police, Sanjay was courting one of Oms daughters and his cousin Preeti, when he stayed with the family till earlier this year. When Om found out, he apparently threw Sanjay out, and the murders were a form of revenge, according to the police. 

 Delay damages on hospital

 New Delhi (PTI): A Delhi consumer forum 

 has held Safdarjung Hospital guilty of negligence and asked 

 it to pay a compensation of over Rs 2 lakh to the family 

 of a patient who died because of delay in treatment. 

 A delay of over five hours to attend to the patient who required emergency treatment undoubtedly amounts to medical negligence, it said. 

 Swaran Lata, who was taken to the hospital with severe headache and vomiting, was not attended to for five-and-a-half hours and had to be moved to another hospital where she died of brain haemorrhage. 

 The forum rejected Safdarjung Hospitals contention that no liability could be imposed on it as the complainant could not name the attending doctor. The overall responsibility is that of the hospital, it said. 

 PoK resident

 Jammu (PTI): A man from Pakistan-occupied 

 Kashmir who lost his way and entered India about a month 

 ago has been handed back to Pakistani officials.

 Bahadur Khan, who said he had crossed the Line of Control inadvertently, was sent back through the Chakan-da-Bagh crossing point in Poonch.

 Landslide death

 Jammu (PTI): A 15-year-old 

 girl was killed in a landslide at a village in Udhampur 

 on Friday. Kanta and her brother had gone to collect wood 

 with their father when the landslide took place. While Kanta 

 died on the spot, her brother has been injured. 

 Temple theft

 Kasargod (PTI): Unspecified 

 quantity of gold jewellery and cash were stolen from the 

 Madhur Siddhi Vinayaka temple near Kasargod in Kerala on 

 Friday. The thieves are believed to have entered the temple 

 by removing roof tiles.

 A 16-year-old Indore girl sang for 61 hours non-stop to enter 

 the Guinness World Records. Akansha Jachak, who sang 

 725 songs, has also been chosen for the Rashtriya Bal Purashkar.

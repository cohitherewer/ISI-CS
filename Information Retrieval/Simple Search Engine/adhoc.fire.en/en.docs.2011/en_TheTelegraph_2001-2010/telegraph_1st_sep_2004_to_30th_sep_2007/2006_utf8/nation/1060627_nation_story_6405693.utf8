 Call to lift Leh curbs on foreign tourists

 ASHWANI TALWAR

 New Delhi, June 26: The tourism and culture ministry is asking the home ministry to go easy on its inner line permit restrictions in Ladakh, saying the curbs were putting foreign tourists off.

 As with some states in the Northeast, visitors to Ladakh face the hassle of applying for an inner line permit when visiting specified remote areas. The permits are usually given by district magistrates.

 Tourism and culture minister Ambika Soni asked officials to take up the issue with the home ministry soon after her return from Leh, where she had gone last fortnight to attend the annual Sindhu Darshan festival.

 The matter came up when Soni met local tour operators, who often arrange permits for the tourists.

 More than the permit system, the travel agents opposed regulations that do not allow the permits to be given to individual foreign travellers: for some areas, only groups of four or more get permission. 

 Over the years, more areas like Nubra, Changthang, Nyomo and Dha-Hanu have been opened to foreign tourists in Ladakh. But for some of these newly-opened areas, foreigners are allowed in only if they follow certain conditions.

 Typically, the conditions involve travelling along identified tourist circuits: for example, only specified Drokpa villages in the Dha-Hanu areas can be visited. Foreign visitors have to make travel arrangements through registered travel agencies and there is a limit on the number of days they can spend in these areas.

 Tour operators say that the permits should be given to individual travellers as well.

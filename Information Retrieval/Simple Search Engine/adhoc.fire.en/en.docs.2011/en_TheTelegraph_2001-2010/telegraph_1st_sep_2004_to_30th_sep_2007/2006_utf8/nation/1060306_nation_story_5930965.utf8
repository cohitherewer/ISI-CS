 Howards not here for deal

 John Howard: No lsquo;N rsquo; word

Sydney, March 5 (PTI): Australian Prime Minister John Howard today ruled out any uranium deal with Delhi during his visit to India in the wake of the Indo-US nuclear deal.

 Were certainly not going to suddenly change our policy just because the Indians and the Americans have reached an agreement, Howard said as he left for a four-day visit to India.

 His visit follows the high-profile visit of President George W. Bush, which was marked by the signing of the Indo-US nuclear pact.

 Howard, who last visited India in 2000, will be accompanied by a 20-strong business team, including leaders from Australias top companies. 

 He will meet President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and several cabinet ministers.

 Howard said the main focus of his trip would be to build trade ties, business links and deepen the strategic relationship between the two countries. 

 India is an increasingly influential global and regional player whose interests converge with Australias. The discussions I will have while in India will add impetus to our growing strategic relationship, Howard was quoted as saying by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. 

 During my visit, it is anticipated that a number of agreements will be signed in various fields, including trade, defence, science and air services. Howard will also attempt to attract more Indian students to Australian universities. 

 NSG meeting

 The Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) comprising top providers of atomic technology will discuss nuclear cooperation with India at a meeting in Vienna at the end of this month following the Indo-US nuclear deal, an official of the Russian atomic energy agency said in Moscow.

 The accord still remains a declaration and lot of diplomatic efforts would be needed to lift NSG restrictions to allow the supplies of civilian nuclear technology and fuel to India, the official told the Russian news agency Itar-Tass.

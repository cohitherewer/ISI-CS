 HC strikes down molest truce

 New Delhi (PTI): Delhi High Court has 

 refused to recognise a compromise between a man accused 

 of molestation and the complainant, holding that it was 

 not a voluntary decision by the victim as she was fed up 

 with a trial courts delay in disposing of the case.

 urning down their plea to quash the FIR, Justice A.K. Sikri said: It was thus not a case where compromise is the result of free consent of the complainant. On my pertinent query that if the trial is expedited, would she still pursue this joint petition, she immediately responded by saying that in that eventuality, she would like to continue the proceedings.

 Instructing the trial court to conclude the trial within four months and fixing November 4 for recording the victims evidence and cross-examination, Sikri said the offence was non-compoundable and the court had to keep in mind that a crime is essentially a wrong against society.

 Fardeen detoxification plea

 Mumbai (PTI): Actor Fardeen Khan has 

 moved Bombay High Court for permission to undergo detoxification 

 at a de-addiction centre to attract lesser penalty in a 

 drugs seizure case. 

 The narcotics control bureau arrested Fardeen from suburban Juhu in May 2001 when he was about to buy a gram of cocaine from a drug peddler.

 If the court allows it and Fardeen comes out clean after detoxification, the case against him for possessing drugs could be withdrawn, his lawyer Ayaz Khan said. 

 Under Section 64 a of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, an accused can apply for detoxification if he is found in possession of a small quantity of drugs for personal consumption. On successfully undergone detoxification, the prosecution may withdraw charges. 

 Criminals shot

 Bangalore (PTI): Two criminals who had 

 kidnapped a real estate agent were killed in a shootout 

 with police on Wednesday. 

 The police lay a trap for Gaffoor and Goru after two of their associates were arrested on Tuesday. The agent was rescued from a room where he had been chained.

 Dealer dead

 Gurgaon (PTI): A property dealer was 

 gunned down on Wednesday near the Gurgaon-Sohna Road in 

 what police suspect to be a case of professional rivalry. 

 Gajraj, 35, had gone to visit the site of his farmhouse 

 when some men came in a car and fired at him, the police 

 said.

 PoK family

 Jammu (PTI): A family from Pakistan-occupied 

 Kashmir has been picked up by police for overstaying illegally 

 in Jammu and Kashmir. Gulam Ahmed Khan and his family were 

 held in Poonch district.

 One of five gold-plated bulbs of the kalash of Kedarnath

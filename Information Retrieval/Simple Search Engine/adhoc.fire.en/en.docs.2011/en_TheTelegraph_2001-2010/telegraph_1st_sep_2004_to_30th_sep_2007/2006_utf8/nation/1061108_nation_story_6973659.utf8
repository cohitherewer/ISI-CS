The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Trade and border on Hu plate

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 7: The Chinese Presidents subcontinent trip later this month will focus on economic cooperation, but Delhi will be pushing also for an early settlement of border issues.

 Delhi and Beijing today announced that Hu Jintao (in picture above) would begin his India tour on November 20 and leave for Islamabad on November 23. Between the political talks in Delhi and the business meetings in Mumbai, he will be squeezing in a visit to Agra.

 India has proposed that the two countries special representatives working on a framework agreement on the border issue hold talks before Hus visit.

 The dates for the dialogue are yet to be worked out, but officials have hinted it might happen before Hu touches down.

 The Chinese, however, have already set the tone for the presidential visit by making a strong pitch for a free-trade agreement. It is still some time, though, before the two nations can actually ink the pact.

 Forced retirement for illegal marriage

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 18: The Supreme Court has ruled that an employees illegal second marriage can be a ground for imposing compulsory retirement.

 Upholding the removal of a store attendant in the Bank Note Press at Dewas in Uttar Pradesh, a bench of Justices Arijit Pasayat and L.S. Panta noted that imposing compulsory retirement was not disproportionate to the alleged misconduct.

 Departmental proceedings were initiated against K.G. Soni after his first wife, who married him in 1973, lodged a complaint about his second marriage. The disciplinary authority ordered Sonis removal on the ground that he had concealed his first marriage while filling up a form before getting married the second time in 1974.

 The removal order was challenged before the appellate authority which converted it into compulsory retirement. With the central administrative tribunal refusing to interfere, Soni approached the high court.

 The high court held that the punishment of compulsory retirement was disproportionate and ordered a reconsideration. 

 It noted that the complaint made by the first wife about the alleged second marriage was belated and this was not a misconduct which warrants compulsory retirement.

 Setting aside the high court order, the Supreme Court said it had not indicated as to why the punishment was considered disproportionate and why it considered the misconduct to be not so serious.

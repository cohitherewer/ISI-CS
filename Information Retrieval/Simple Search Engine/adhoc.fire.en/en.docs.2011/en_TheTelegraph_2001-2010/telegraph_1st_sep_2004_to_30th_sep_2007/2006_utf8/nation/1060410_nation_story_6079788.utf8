 Rebel bandh delays trains

 OUR BUREAU

 April 9: Several long-distance trains to Calcutta, Delhi and other parts of northern India were delayed after they were diverted because of a Maoist bandh in Bihar during which tracks were blown up.

 The rebels, who had called a Magadh bandh against arrest of their leaders, stormed the Bansi Nala halt on the Dhanbad-Gaya section around 2 am and abducted four railway staff before blowing up the tracks. The employees were later released unharmed.

 All the trains to and from Calcutta which use the Grand Chord are being diverted through the main line, an Eastern Railway spokesman said in Calcutta today.

 Instead of taking the Grand Chord route via Gaya, the trains were diverted to Patna on the main-line route to reach Mughalsarai. Rajdhani trains would take an extra three hours to cover the detour while other trains would need four.

 The extra traffic on the Patna route aggravated the situation. The Patna route is saturated with 20 pairs of additional trains, eight of which are from Eastern Railway. There is an acute congestion, leading to late running of trains throughout the day, a railway official said.

 The New Delhi-Howrah and New Delhi-Sealdah Rajdhani trains reached their destinations five hours late. Other trains arriving late were the Kalka Mail Doon Express and Shipra Express.

 The railways have diverted the routes of many trains and rescheduled the timing of others. The up trains whose routes were diverted are the 3151 Sealdah-Jammu Tawi Express, 2381 Poorva Express, 2311 Kalka Mail and 1159 Chambal Express, which will take the Asansol-Jhajha-Patna-Mughalsarai route.

 East Central Railway decided to divert trains from the Grand Chord last evening following the bandh call. Movement of passenger trains in the Gaya-Dhanbad, Gaya-Patna and Gaya-Mughalsarai and Gaya-Kiul sections had also been stopped.

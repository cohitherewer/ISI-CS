 Nation at a Glance

 Death sentence in a month

 Moga (PTI): Within only a month of her daughter-in-laws death, Harbans Kaur was on Wednesday convicted of murder and sentenced to death by a local court.

 Based on the victims dying declaration, additional sessions judge Sukhdev Singh convicted Kaur, a resident of Kotisekhan in Punjab, of burning Harpreet Kaur to death.

 Harpreet was rushed to a local hospital with over 90 per cent burns on March 4 and then referred to a hospital in Ferozepur.

 An assistant sub-inspector of police and a judicial magistrate recorded Harpreets statement in the Ferozepur hospital. She said she had objected to outsiders visiting their house to meet her mother-in-law.

 Enraged by doubts being cast on her reputation, Harbans had poured kerosene on her daughter-in-law and burnt her, the prosecution said.

 Emergency landing, all safe

New Delhi (PTI): A Qatar Airways aircraft carrying 236 people, 

developed engine trouble but landed safely at the Indira Gandhi International 

Airport on Wednesday.

 All 221 passengers and 15 crew members of the Airbus A-330 aircraft were safe. The plane was on its way to Delhi from Doha.

 After the pilot informed air traffic control about a shutdown in one of its engines, an emergency was declared at the airport and all incoming and outgoing traffic was stopped for about 45 minutes, airport sources said. 

 Before landing, the aircraft dumped its excess fuel.

 Sonia letter blows lid off scam

 Sonia: Graft check

 Lucknow, Sept. 27: Sonia Gandhi as a political adversary is one thing. But as a sleuth?

 The Congress chiefs nose for scams has led to the arrest of nine engineers and cases against dozens accused of pocketing money meant for road repair after the ruling Samajwadi Party in Uttar Pradesh acted on a letter alleging corruption in the project.

 We have drawn up FIRs against 71 people, including engineers and contractors. Nine of them have been arrested so far, said S.R. Saraswat, chief engineer in the public works department.

 The money had been sanctioned to repair a 75-km stretch from Rae Bareli to Maharajganj. Two other roads one 35 km long and the other 27 km which were repaired recently have gone back to their old state: potholed, without tar and large tracts with no brick and stone left. But the money allotted was shown as officially spent.

 Complaints about the condition of several roads in Rae Bareli have been reaching Sonia for sometime. But earlier, when she had asked if the roads had been done up, the state government had said the repair work was complete.

 On September 18 during her visit to Rae Bareli, she decided to see the roads herself. Before leaving, she wrote to the district administration expressing her suspicion about irregularities in the project.

 A copy of the letter was sent to the chief minister.

 Two days later, she told a Congress rally in Bareilly, more than 350 km away, that crores of rupees allocated for development were being siphoned off to line the pockets of officers, politicians and contractors.

 The Congress chief urged her party workers to launch an agitation against the jeb bharos, or those who line their pockets illegally.

 The state government, which had so long seen her complaints as political moves, could no longer ignore them.

 It ordered a probe by Saraswat and superintending engineer Ataar Singh.

 A week later, confirmation of what Sonia had hinted at came from her parliamentary constituency, Rae Bareli, when the state government was forced to register the criminal cases. Among the 71 accused of siphoning off money from road-repair funds are 30 engineers.

 These officers prima facie have been accused of a conspiracy to defraud money from the project and under-utilising funds to carry out the repair work, Saraswat said.

 The nine arrested engineers were produced before a Rae Bareli court today. Police have also begun raiding the houses of the accused engineers and contractors.

 Congress workers in Rae Bareli say the scam could not have happened without the consent of political bosses.

 The public works department is headed by Shivpal Singh Yadav, the chief ministers brother and a senior minister.

 Samajwadi sources hold up the probe as their counter. They say the scam was unearthed because the state government is serious about fighting corruption.

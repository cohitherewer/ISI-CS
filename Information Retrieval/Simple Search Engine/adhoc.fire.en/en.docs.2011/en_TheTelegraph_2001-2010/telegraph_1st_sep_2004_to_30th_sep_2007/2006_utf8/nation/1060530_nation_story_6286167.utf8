 Mahajan son surprises

 - Tale 

of two rahuls 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 29: The BJP already has a Gandhi to pit against the Congresss first family scion. It could be looking for a Rahul as well.

 Rahul Mahajan set off a buzz today when he walked into the BJPs national executive meeting during the lunch break.

 The surprise appearance of the late Pramod Mahajans son (in picture) caused a stir in the otherwise dull proceedings and set off a scramble among the photographers.

 Rahul spoke briefly to the waiting reporters and walked off to have lunch with senior party leaders. As Atal Bihari Vajpayee was leaving, he rushed to touch the former Prime Ministers feet.

 The Mahajan scion met all the senior leaders ? L.K. Advani and party chief Rajnath Singh, chief ministers Narendra Modi, Shivraj Singh Chauhan and Vasundhara Raje, all the general secretaries as well as Bihar leader Sushil Modi.

 Although his close friends denied any possibility of Rahul entering politics, his comments to the media at the executive had enough grist to continue to feed speculation.

 Asked if he planned to take the plunge, Rahul said: It can be given a thought. Everything in this world can be looked into and thought about.

 He added, though, that there were no immediate plans for a political debut.

 Was there an offer from Rajnath? Rahul said: The party president will answer this question. I will do whatever the party president asks me to do.

 Mahajan family sources, however, brushed away the speculations. He is just not the type. Of course, we cant predict the future but Rahul, as we know him, is a most unlikely candidate for a politicians role, said a BJP leader close to the family.

 The young man is known to be fond of partying ? not a trait his fathers party would appreciate. But neither was Pramod, ever ready to flaunt his love of the good life, a typical Sangh-BJP functionary.

 Asked why he had turned up at a political event as crucial as the national executive, Rahul said he had been invited by the BJP president. I had invited Rahul over for lunch. It gave him a chance to meet party leaders, Rajnath said.

 Rahul said he was using the opportunity to thank the BJP leaders for supporting the family when his father was fighting for his life in hospital. It was an emotional experience? meeting all the senior leaders who miss my dad.

 Asked if he would try and fulfil his fathers dreams, Rahul replied: Whatever a son can do to fulfil his fathers dreams, I will do.

 He quickly added that his fathers dreams didnt concern politics alone. He later left for Assam carrying the urn containing Pramods ashes.

 The two-day BJP national executive unanimously adopted a resolution recalling Pramods contributions to the party over the years.

 Recently, Rajnath had tried to secure for either Rahul or his mother Rekha a Rajya Sabha nomination from Maharashtra in place of Pramod. The Congress had rejected the proposal.

 Rajnath, who described Rahul as a very good boy, said: The BJP wants Rahul Mahajan to work for the party.

 But he parried other questions, saying: Whenever it is decided, the media will be informed.

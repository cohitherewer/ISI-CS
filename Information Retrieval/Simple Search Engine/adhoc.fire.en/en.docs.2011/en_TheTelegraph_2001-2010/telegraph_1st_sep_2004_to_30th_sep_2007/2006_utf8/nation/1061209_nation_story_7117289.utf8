The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Rival begins to whet knives

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 8: The BJP today sniffed departures in the nuclear bills final text from Indias stated position and declared it would not allow a situation where India would be subservient to the US.

 The main Opposition party said it would ensure the government stays within the substance of Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs August 17 statement in Parliament on the Indo-US nuclear deal.

 BJP spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad said that at first glance, part of the text of the Waiver Authority Bill appears at odds with the August 17 statement.

 He added that the party would come out with a more structured response after Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Jaswant Singh and L.K. Advani have had time to discuss the bill at length.

 Jaswant has already made this allegation.

 We are not against a strategic partnership with the US. However, the government must understand that a partnership (can obtain) between two equal and sovereign nations; not an India that is subservient in decision-making or has a subsidiary role to the US, or any other country for that matter, the former foreign minister said.

 The PMs August 17 statement is the governments final and formal position on the issue. These commitments, made in Parliament, were policy pronouncements. They superseded the earlier July 18, 2005, and March 26, 2006, announcements.

 He said the Prime Minister must clarify if these parliamentary commitments had been abandoned.

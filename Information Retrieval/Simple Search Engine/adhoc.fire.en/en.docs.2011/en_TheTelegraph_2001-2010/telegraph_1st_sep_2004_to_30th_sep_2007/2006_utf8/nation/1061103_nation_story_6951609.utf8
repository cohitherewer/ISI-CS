 TV fee tonic for bars

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 2: If TV-watching families need protection from arbitrary cable charges, so do the smaller hotels and bars. At least, thats what broadcast regulator Trai reckons.

 The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India has come up with the draft of a tariff order for commercial subscribers of cable TV. It divides these businesses into two categories and places the smaller ones on a par with ordinary subscribers.

 The first group is made up of hotels with three-star rating or above, heritage hotels and commercial establishments providing boarding and lodging and with at least 50 rooms. The other includes establishments like the smaller hotels and guesthouses, restaurants and bars.

 Trai argues the first category has the wherewithal to negotiate terms with the broadcasters on equal footing, so it needs no tariff protection.

 As for the second category, Trai proposes that an existing freeze of pay channel prices at the December 26, 2003, level should apply to them. 

 In CAS areas, the tariff for this group would be the same as that for homes but theyll end up paying more. Under CAS, you pay for every TV set installed with a set-top box.

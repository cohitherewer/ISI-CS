 PM car rap for cops

 Thiruvananthapuram, Nov. 11 (PTI): Days after submission of an inquiry report on the goof-up in the Prime Ministers convoy recently, the Kerala government today shifted an inspector-general in charge of security and the city police commissioner.

 The action, based on the chief secretarys inquiry report, was announced by chief minister V.S. Achuthanandan in the presence of home minister Kodiyeri Balakrishnan at a news conference.

 Police commissioner Manoj Abraham was moved as superintendent of police (crime branch). The posting for inspector-general P. Chandrasekharan will be decided later.

 The government considered a deviation from the route by a pilot vehicle in the Prime Ministers motorcade during his visit on October 31 as a serious error and steps have been taken to ensure that it does not happen in future, Achuthanandan said.

 Jaya sop for road workers

 Chennai, Feb. 3: On the eve of Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs visit to Tamil Nadu, chief minister Jayalalithaa has unwrapped a gift for road labourers, reports our special correspondent.

 As many as 9,813 workers of the state highways department have been reinstated.

 The workers were all appointed during the DMK regime ? from 1996 to 2001 ? and summarily dismissed within months after Jayalalithaas ADMK came to power. 

 With Assembly elections round the corner in Tamil Nadu, the move ? perhaps the last of the chief ministers several unpopular measures that she has reversed ? deprives the DMK and its allies, including the Congress, of yet another poll plank.

 Once they start work, the labourers will each get three months pay as ex-gratia, Jayalalithaa said.

 Gowda back 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 18: Eager to retrieve the secular tag and make peace with the Left and the UPA, H.D. Deve Gowda today withdrew his resignation as Janata Dal (Secular) president and suspended his son and the other 39 rebels.

 The rebels ? who last month brought Karnatakas Congress-Dal (S) government down and formed a coalition ministry with the BJP, with Gowdas son H.D. Kumaraswamy as chief minister ? have been accused of violating the partys accepted principles. 

 The announcement was made by party spokesman Kunwar Danish Ali at a news conference here. Asked why Delhi and not Bangalore was chosen for the announcement, Ali said: Our central office is here and I, Danish Ali, the secretary general, am based here.

 Party sources said the well-choreographed move had several objectives, one being the need to avoid a split.

 The three-week gap between Gowdas resignation and its withdrawal also gave Kumaraswamy enough time to form a government, win a floor test and expand his cabinet.

 Bush tugs at visa leash

 Bush: Is Congress listening?

 Washington, Feb. 3 (PTI): In the face of competition from emerging economies like India and China, President George W. Bush has urged US Congress to raise the number of H-1b visas that allow companies to hire foreign workers for scientific and high-tech jobs.

 Congress needs to understand that nations like China and India and Japan and Korea and Canada all offer tax incentives that are permanent. In other words, we live in a competitive world. We want to be the leader in this world, Bush said in Minnesota yesterday.

 Congress had in 2005 capped the number of H-1b visas at 65,000, a third of the 195,000 allowed during the technology boom, which drew foreigners in hordes, many of them Indians.

 I think its a mistake not to encourage more really bright folks who can fill the jobs that are having trouble being filled here in America?. So I call upon Congress to be realistic and reasonable and raise that cap, the President said. 

 He did not mention by how much he wants the limit to be raised.

 Bush said one part of the agenda to stay competitive was to study math and science, a theme he had touched upon during his State of the Union address on Tuesday. 

 Its one thing to research... but if you dont have somebody in that lab.? And so I got some ideas for the Congress to consider. The first is to emphasise math and science early and to make sure that the courses are rigorous enough that our children can compete globally.

 He said there are more high-tech jobs in America today than people available to do them. So what do we do about that? And the reason its important ? and the American citizen has got to understand its important ? is if we dont do something about how to fill those high-tech jobs here, theyll go somewhere else.

 Stressing again on the increasing global competition, the President said: There are some who say we cant worry about competition. It doesnt matter, its here.... Its a real aspect of the world in which we live.

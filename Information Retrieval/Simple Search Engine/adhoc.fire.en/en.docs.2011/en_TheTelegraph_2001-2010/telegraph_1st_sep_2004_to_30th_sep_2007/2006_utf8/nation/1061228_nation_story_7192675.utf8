 Taiwan sways, tech city stirs

 ANIL BUDUR LULLA

 Bangalore, Dec. 27: The tremors that shook Taiwan yesterday have rattled techies in faraway Bangalore.

 The men who never sleep went into a flurry after the quake damaged an undersea telecom cable that serves as a vital highway for BPO businesses in the city.

 It takes us three to five minutes to switch over to another operator or route. If it is a planned decision, we can do it seamlessly. But in an emergency, when the networks are down, it takes you some time to figure out and take an immediate decision to re-route operations on a different link, R. Jacob, a systems administrator heading the morning shift at a leading 24/7 unit, said.

 The BPO, which has a huge US operation, had to shift to the transatlantic undersea cable from the Asia-Pacific (Apac) link that was rendered inoperable after the tremors.

 The strong aftershocks prevented crews from doing any immediate repairs. We were advised that the Apac route would not be available for the next few days, Jacob said.

 The undersea cables are built and maintained by a consortium of nationally operated communication companies. They are the main highways on which BPO businesses ride as satellite networks cannot transfer large volumes of data.

 The BPO business needs huge bandwidth which satellite communications cannot offer, said Infosys BPO (formerly Progeon) vice-president Vijay Menon.

 SINGTEL, or Singapore Telecom, which owns the Apac network, has promised additional capacity to its customers soon. But we have already switched over to contingency mode and used other operators to keep the business going, Menon said.

 The quakes have prompted a review of emergency responses. If a manmade disaster like a bandh happens, we have learnt to shift the business seamlessly. But in case of natural disasters, it takes a few minutes to figure out what happened and take a decision to shift the process via other routes, said another systems manager.

 Many BPOs, however, functioned without much disruption, or at least they would not admit it. This incident has not affected our operations. Our IT team is working closely with the service providers to ensure that our operations continue to function seamlessly, said Pradeep Narayanan, the chief delivery officer of 24/7 Customer.

 Eat the junk, then pop a dream pill

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 1: Imagine a pill that allows you to eat junk food to your hearts content without worrying about diabetes. It is still a dream, but scientists might have inched closer to such a drug by unravelling how high-fat diets trigger diabetes.

 Researchers at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute in the US have discovered the molecular connection between high-fat diets and the onset of type-2 diabetes, the type that accounts for 95 per cent of diabetes in the world.

 In a study set to appear in the journal Cell on Thursday, the scientists have reported that a high-fat diet suppresses the activity of an enzyme called GnT-4a and leads to type-2 diabetes through a failure of the insulin-secreting beta cells in the pancreas. The study also shows that knocking out a single gene that makes the enzyme GnT-4a in mice disrupts insulin production in the pancreas.

 Investigator Jamey Marth said it was really astounding to find that normal mice fed with high-fat diets also displayed lowered activity of the GnT-4a enzyme and a similar disruption in insulin production. 

 If our findings can be applied to humans, they should give us important insights into how type-2 diabetes may be prevented or treated, said Marth, a researcher at the University of California, San Diego.

 The earliest phases of type 2 diabetes are marked by the failure of insulin-secreting beta cells in the pancreas. As the disease advances, the insulin-secreting beta cells overcompensate for increased blood sugar levels, leading to too much insulin and insulin-resistance. The new study has shown that the absence of GnT-4a impairs insulin secretion and leads to type-2 diabetes in mice.

 If you could somehow stimulate the production of this enzyme, you might be able to render animals, and perhaps humans, resistant to high-fat diet-induced diabetes, said Marth who is now engaged in a fresh set of experiments to find out whether mice that are genetically engineered to produce high levels of the GnT-4a enzyme are resistant to type-2 diabetes caused by high-fat diet.

 Insights into the molecular mechanisms of diabetes could be a first step towards possible new drugs, said Dr V. Mohan, director of the Madras Diabetes Research Foundation in Chennai. But scientists would still need to establish that this enzyme mechanism is applicable in humans and also find a molecule to function as a safe and effective drug. The drug might not be useful to every patient, Mohan said.

 But researchers caution that the GnT-4a enzyme might not give the complete picture. There are several other enzymes and numerous proteins that also influence insulin secretion, said Anoop Misra, professor of medicine at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in New Delhi. There might actually be multiple mechanisms in the connection between high fat and diabetes.

 Studies in India and elsewhere, for instance, have shown that high fat in the abdomen leads to free fatty acids circulating in the blood that obstruct the action of insulin and lead to type-2 diabetes.

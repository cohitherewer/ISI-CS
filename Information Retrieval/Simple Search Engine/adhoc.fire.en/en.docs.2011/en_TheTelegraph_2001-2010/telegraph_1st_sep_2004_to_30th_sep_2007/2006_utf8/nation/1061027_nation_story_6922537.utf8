 Abuser dad

 Indore, Oct. 26 (PTI): Enraged over alleged sexual advances and constant demand for money for liquor, a woman has killed her father. 

 Mahzabi attacked Saifuddin Bohra with a kitchen knife yesterday, police said.

 When she told her husband about the incident, he rushed home along with a doctor. But Bohra died before they reached there. The couple then informed the police and was taken into custody. 

 Mahzabi reportedly told the police her father had wrong intentions towards her and she had been facing abuse for quite some time.

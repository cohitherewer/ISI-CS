 Land grab gun on Jaya

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Jayalalithaa: Under cloud

 Chennai, July 26: Prompted by the CPM, the M. Karunanidhi government in Tamil Nadu has ordered a judicial inquiry into charges of land grab against Jayalalithaa and her friend Sassikala.

 A farmhouse at Sirudhavur, 30 km from here in neighbouring Kancheepuram district on the way to the tourist resort of Mamallapuram, is at the centre of the controversy. The 53-acre property is located on Panchami land or land that originally belonged to Dalits.

 Former CPM state secretary N.Varadarajan and the partys kisan sabha secretary, K. Balakrishnan, today led a protest march along with members of affected Dalit families to the secretariat. 

 Varadarajan presented a memorandum to the chief minister on how the Dalits had been illegally deprived of their agricultural lands by persons closely related to Sassikala. A luxury bungalow, complete with a swimming pool, for Jayalalithaa had come up on the land, it said.

 The CPM demanded that the government institute an inquiry, restore the land to the Dalits and punish those responsible for the fraud.

 Barely 30 minutes after the CPM team had met him, Karunanidhi announced in the Assembly that a retired Madras High Court judge, Justice K.P. Sivasubramaniam, will head a one-man panel to investigate the charges and submit a report in two months. 

 The government will take further action on the basis of the report, he added, taking the House by surprise.

 Karunanidhi said the 53 acres where the farmhouse now stands had been distributed to landless Dalits for cultivation in 1967. The probe would cover whether the land had been grabbed from the Dalits without their knowledge, alleged abuse of power (during the earlier ADMK regime), manipulation or any irregularities in the transfer of title deeds.

 In his suo motu statement, Karunanidhi did not name Jayalalithaa or Sassikala but made it clear the probe was being ordered on the basis of the CPMs memorandum.

 For five minutes afterwards, the ADMK members were on their feet, but they were protesting not so much against the probe as the statements of DMK allies ? the Congress, PMK, CPI and the CPM ? lauding Karunanidhi for ordering one.

 There can be no debate on a suo motu statement made in the House and how is this allowed? they protested, led by their deputy leader . Pannerselvam. But Speaker Avudaiappan replied that the floor leaders of other parties were only thanking the chief minister, not debating the issue.

 The CPM alleged in its memorandum that since Jayalalithaa and her friend came to stay at Sirudhavur several years ago, the Dalits concerned were forcibly evicted from the place, false land records created and transferred in the names of several others related to Sassikala.

 New Delhi, Jan. 25: President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam today said political parties should leave behind them the politics of power after an election and come together to pursue the objective of development.

 In politics, there are two dimensions, the first one is political politics and the other is developmental politics. Political politics is required during election process, Kalam said in his Republic Day address.

 Immediately after the election, all parties must converge on developmental politics with a common mission. Translating this into action, all parties have to work with zeal to uplift 260 million people living below the poverty line and remove illiteracy and unemployment.

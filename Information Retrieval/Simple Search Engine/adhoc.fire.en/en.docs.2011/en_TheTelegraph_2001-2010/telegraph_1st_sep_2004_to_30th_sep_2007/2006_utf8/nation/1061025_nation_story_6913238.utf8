 India chases Cheney to save nuclear deal

 Washington, Oct. 24: India has launched an all-out effort here to salvage the nuclear deal with the US.

 For the second time since the deal was announced on July 18, 2005, US Vice-President Dick Cheney is being drafted to see it through before a new US Congress takes over in January.

 Cheney, who is often called the real President of the US, is ex-officio president of the Senate, which is yet to pass legislation enabling implementation of the nuclear deal.

 The Indian effort to draft Cheney became apparent after S. Jaishankar, joint secretary in charge of the Americas in the ministry of external affairs, yesterday met Samantha Ravich, Cheneys deputy national security adviser.

 The urgency of roping in Cheney to salvage the deal was obvious from the fact that Ravich was the first official to meet Jaishankar.

 Usually, a visiting joint secretary from South Block begins his trip to Washington by meeting his counterparts in the state department before other engagements here.

 Earlier this year, when the fate of the nuclear deal in the House of Representatives appeared to be uncertain, Cheney was invited to deliver the keynote address at the annual meeting of the US-India Business Council (USIBC), which has created a well organised Coalition for Partnership with India to see through the deal.

 Cheneys strong support for the nuclear deal at the USIBC meeting galvanised Republicans on Capitol Hill and pushed fence-sitters in the Congress into supporting legislation, which was subsequently passed by the House of Representatives, for implementing the deal.

 Cheney could once again contribute to the nuclear deal if he uses his considerable clout on Capitol Hill to ensure that the Senate approves the deal when it meets in a lame duck session from November 13 to 17.

 It is called lame duck because it will be held after elections to a new Congress, which will take power only in January.

 This week, finance minister P. Chidambaram, commerce minister Kamal Nath and the deputy chairman of the Planning Commission, Montek Singh Ahluwalia, are all in the US drumming up support for the nuclear deal.

 Tomorrow, they will be joined by Ratan Tata and a host of other Indian corporate leaders in New York for a meeting, whose focus will be the nuclear deal.

 The captains of US business, including the influential CEOs of Boeing, Citigroup, Dow Chemicals and Honeywell have confirmed that they would attend the meeting.

 It is being held under the umbrella of the Indo-US CEOs Forum, which was created during the Prime Ministers visit to the White House last year.

 Lords back Mittal, bow to market

 AMIT ROY

 Mittal

 London, March 15: Members of the House of Lords, both from the ruling Labour Party and from the Tory and Liberal Democrat Opposition, have warned the French, Luxembourg and other European governments that they must not interfere in the proposed bid by steel tycoon Lakshmi Mittal for Arcelor.

 Strong support for Mittal was expressed by Lord Lamont, the former Tory chancellor (finance minister) in John Majors cabinet, who asked the government if representations had been made to its European counterparts over Mittal Steels bid for rival Arcelor.

 When the government whip in the Lords, Lord McKenzie, said no representations had been made, Lamont said: Does he agree that the remarks of the President of France (Jacques Chirac) and the Prime Minister of Luxembourg (Jean-Claude Juncker) about the undesirability of the Mittal bid for Arcelor are wholly inappropriate interference in a matter that should be left to markets?

 Displaying remarkable agreement with the Tory Opposition, McKenzie said: I agree with the thrust of what the noble Lord has said.

 He made it clear that the Blair government was against protectionism. It seems to me that the paradox of protectionism is that it destroys that which it seeks to protect because it acts against innovation and investment. Government policy is that mergers are the responsibility of the relevant independent competition authority.

 In the mid of this support for Mittal, a jarring note was struck by Lord Brookman, who, as David Keith Brookman, was a trade union leader.

 He disagreed with Lamont and complained: I declare an interest as an ex-general secretary of the steelworkers union, the Iron and Steel Trades Confederation, now renamed Community. We are talking here about peoples jobs in Europe, and I do not necessarily disagree with countries that have a degree of concern about this hostile takeover bid.

 He posed the question: What would we do in similar circumstances? Would we raise the roof if our people were likely to lose jobs?

 Brookman provided the answer himself: Mr Mittal has a bit of a track record. Some of us remember what happened to Irish Steel. He bought it for one punt and walked away and left the Irish government to deal with the losses suffered by the people in Ireland. What would our government do in similar circumstances?

 McKenzie responded: If such a bid were made for a UK company, it would be the responsibility of the relevant competition authority to consider the effects on competition. 

 Jobs could well be protected in the short term but, in the long term, companies will not survive in the global environment if they put up barriers that are not sustainable.

 An Independent member and former senior diplomat, Lord Hannay, asked McKenzie to confirm that there is no basis in European Union law for a member-state government to intervene in a takeover bid such as Mittal has launched for Arcelor unless they are a shareholder ? and then only to the extent of their shareholding ? and that the French government, which is not a shareholder, therefore, has no locus in the business?

 A Liberal Democrat, Baroness Miller, went further. Assuming that the Mittal organisation is properly described as a British steel producer, will the government cooperate with the Indian government, to whom Mittal originally appealed for help?

 A feature of debates in the Lords is that scalpels are used with excessive politeness but surgical precision.

 Lord Stoddart, an Independent Labour peer, took a swipeat President Chirac. Does the minister (reference to McKenzie who as chief whip has ministerial rank) not think it rather quaint for Mr Chirac to be complaining about a bid when the French have taken over so many industries in this country?

 The Tory, Baroness Rawlings, also spoke out against the French. I agree with the minister on competition, she said. Will he, therefore, agree that there is deep concern regarding an increasing trend towards intervention by various governments in ongoing European cross-border takeover bid situations? 

 McKenzie once again laid out the Blair doctrine: I do not believe that it (government) should play a part in an emerging global economy.

 Mittal is not a member of the House of Lords ? not yet, anyway (though he has donated ?2 million to Labour) ? but the richest man in Britain clearly has friends in high places.

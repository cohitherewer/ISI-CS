 Goodies flow with crown

 Karunanidhi waves at the people after he was sworn in as Tamil Nadu chief minister on Saturday. (PTI)

 Chennai, May 13: ?And in the kingdom of Karunanidhi, the hungry shall not go without rice, the tillers of the earth will be liberated from their debt and the tender can have one more egg.

 Thus spake Muthuvel Karunanidhi, Tamil Nadus new ruler who doesnt wear a crown but always has his dark glasses on.

 The 82-year-old might well have been in his durbar. He wasnt. He had just been given the charge of running the state for the next five years. But, then, he had to keep his word to the people. And what better place than right before them?

 So the sops flowed, not from behind closed doors but before thousands who had packed the Jawaharlal Nehru Indoor Stadium to see the DMK leader take oath as chief minister for the fifth time.

 The stunning departure from protocol came just as everyone thought the swearing-in had ended after governor S.S. Barnala administered the oath of office and secrecy to Karunanidhi and 30 other ministers. But chief secretary N. Narayanan urged the crowd over the public address system to stay on as Karunanidhi, after the governor leaves, would make three important announcements.

 That took everyone by surprise, including the Congress contingent from Delhi, among them Union ministers Pranab Mukherjee, Praful Patel, P. Chidambaram, Mani Shankar Aiyar and Jaipal Reddy, and leaders of other allies like the CPM, CPI and the PMK.

 Karunanidhi, dressed in a white dhoti and shirt with his yellow shawl round his neck, then took the microphone to announce that his partys pre-poll promise to provide quality cheap rice at Rs 2 a kg to all ration card holders will be implemented from June 3.

 It will be a birthday gift ? but from the birthday boy. Karunanidhi will turn 83 that day.

 We have decided to implement this in fulfilment of our election promise, Karunanidhi said to a thunderous roar of approval. The burden of the price cut ? from the Rs 3.50 a kg now ? on the states exchequer will be Rs 550 crore.

 Then came the second announcement, this time for farmers. The government, Karunanidhi said, would write off all their loans due to cooperatives till March 31 this year.

 The sop, greeted with relief by debt-ridden farmers, will cost the exchequer Rs 6,866 crore. The state itself will meet this commitment from its own funds, Karunanidhi said.

 The third announcement said eggs for schoolchildren under the Nutritious Noon Meal Programme will be increased from one to two per child every week. The scheme, Karunanidhi said, will come into force from July 15, the birth anniversary of former chief minister Kamaraj.

 But the drama was not over yet.

 After announcing the sops, Karunanidhi told the huge gathering he would sign the orders to give effect to the three decisions right now in front of you all. He then took out his black ink and signed the orders.

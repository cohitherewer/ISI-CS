 Bounty for DMK allies 

 Chennai, March 9: The Congress in Tamil Nadu let out a whoop of delight today as it got 48 seats from the DMKs pre-poll bonanza bag, reports our special correspondent.

 Smarting under Vaikos walkout, DMK chief M. Karunanidhi made sure his seat-sharing arrangements left most of his partners in the Democratic Progressive Alliance smiling.

 The Congress has got the lions share of the 234 Assembly seats for the May 8 polls. We are extremely happy, said M. Krishnasamy, the state Congress chief, after signing the deal with Karunanidhi.

 The CPM clinched a good deal with 13 of the 25 Assembly seats it had identified as winnable. The CPI got 10 seats. The Indian Union Muslim League was allotted three seats.

 The DMK is yet to finalise a deal with the OBC-dominated Pattali Makkal Katchi.

 Intuc shocker

 The Congresss trade union affiliate, Intuc, sprang a surprise by signing a seat-sharing deal with the DMKs rival, the ADMK. It was given two seats.

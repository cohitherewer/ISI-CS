 AMU to approach apex court for lost status

 Aligarh Muslim University: Simmering within

 Jan. 8: Aligarh Muslim University today said it would appeal against the judgment of Allahabad High Court scrapping its minority status even as several social organisations said they favoured a political solution to the issue.

 The university said human resource development minister Arjun Singhs assurance that fresh efforts would be made to accord minority status to the institution was a positive sign.

 Admitting that the judgment was a setback, vice-chancellor Naseem Ahmed said AMU would appeal to the Supreme Court after receiving a copy of the verdict.

 Ahmed did not spell out any specific course of action apart from exploring the legal option against the high court verdict that struck down the 1981 amendment providing minority status to AMU.

 Last weeks judgment, therefore, meant that the new 50 per cent quota for minority students in the universitys postgraduate medical course was illegal.

 A spectre of unrest and disruption of academic activities loomed large on the campus yesterday following a strike and a threat by students and minority bodies to intensify their agitation for minority status for the university.

 Shouting slogans, students and teachers took out processions in small groups and staged sit-ins.

 (It is) time now to fight till a solution to the crisis over the loss of minority status is found, said a student.

 Left leaders at the campus appeared indifferent as they are opposed to religion-based reservation, but several Muslim organisations ? whose leaders are alumni of the university ? and students decided to intensify their campaign and hold a conference to find out if the community had a united stand on the issue.

 In a joint memorandum to President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, six associations connected with AMU employees have asked him to take necessary steps for preserving the universitys autonomy and minority status.

 A meeting of current and former students of the university was also held in Lucknow.

 Yesterdays strike was called by the AMU Teachers Association, non-teaching associations and the students union to demand a constitutional amendment for restoration of the minority status.

 The campus looked forlorn with students and teachers staying away from their departments. Everything was closed except emergency services at the Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College. Even the Junior Doctors Organisation supported the strike, said the vice-president of the AMU students union, Malik Fazle Rab.

 The current and former students have come up with a three-point charter of demands ? an appeal to the Supreme Court be made immediately; stem loopholes, if any, in the AMU Act; and hold a national convention on the issue.

 We are in favour of forming an Aligarh Muslim University action committee to start pressuring the government, said Zafaryab Jilani, an AMU alumnus and convener of the Babri Masjid Action Committee.

 If the problem persists, the students and teachers would be left with no other option but to hit the street, said Farrukh Khan, the general secretary of the students union.

 The Left camp in the AMU is not supporting the university administration.

 Scholars and intellectuals from Left groups decried the university administrations lack of vision. This, they felt, is why they (AMU) found it easier to appeal to communal sentiments than to think of the students careers.

 Job-seeker raped in moving car

 Lucknow: A woman in search of a baby-sitting job abroad was gangraped in a moving car in the Sahibabad area, about 25 km from Delhi, reports our special correspondent.

 The 32-year-old from Kerala filed an FIR on Monday night, alleging that five persons had raped her in a car. The lady was staying with her sister in Noida. On Saturday night, when she was waiting for a bus at the Mohan Nagar stand, two persons in a car stopped and offered her a lift, senior superintendent of police Piyush Mordia said.

 She was allegedly dragged inside the vehicle and gagged. Three others joined them as they drove through Sahibabad, Vaishali and Vasundhara for three hours. 

 The woman managed to flee when the car slowed down near Vasundhara. She was waiting for her relatives to arrive from Kerala, after which she filed the FIR. 

 The car has been found to belong to one B.L. Bakshi, who runs a placement agency.

 Jail for lemon molester

Singapore (AFP): An Indian who pretended to be a fortune-teller 

and rubbed lemon on a woman to rid her of a demon has been sentenced to nine months 

in jail and three strokes of the cane.

 Singarahalli Chinnaswamy Manjaiah, who came here with a short-term visa, had approached a 33-year-old housewife on March 2 and told her that he was a fortune-teller. Manjaiah convinced her she was possessed by a kutty-satan (little demon) and that she would die soon or become a prostitute if it was not removed by his prayer ritual at a cost of $166.

 The woman met Manjaiah two days later and he took her to a quiet spot at a public housing complex to perform the ritual. There he molested her.

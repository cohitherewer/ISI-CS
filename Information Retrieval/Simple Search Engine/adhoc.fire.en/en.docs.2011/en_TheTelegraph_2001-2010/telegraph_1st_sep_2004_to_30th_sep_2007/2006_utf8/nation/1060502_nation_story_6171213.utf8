New Delhi, May 1: When the body of K. Suryanarayana, 

the engineer who was kidnapped and killed by the Taliban, arrived in Delhi today, 

there were no family members to receive it.

 Nor did anyone from the Prime Ministers Office or the foreign ministry turn up at the airport when the mortal remains of the 41-year-old engineer were flown in.

 For them, the story seems to be over even as the news has just begun to sink in for Suryanarayanas family at his Malkajgiris home.

 Deputy resident commissioner of Andhra Pradesh K. Chiranjivi was projected as the PMOs representative. 

 Suryanarayana, who made news when he was abducted on Saturday and beheaded yesterday, has become one more statistic in the great diplomatic games that nations play.

 An Indian aircraft carrying Suryanarayanas body landed around 4.30 pm. The coffin was then taken to Hyderabad and handed over to his family.

 The body was accompanied from Afghanistan by Manish Aggarwal, Suryanarayanas colleague at Al Moayed, which is engaged in a project for Afghan mobile service provider Roshan Telecom.

 According to officials, a Hanuman locket, a golden bracelet and a watch were found on the engineers body.

 Draped in the Tricolour and strewn with flowers, the coffin was placed at Shraddhanjali Sthan.

 Chiranjivi placed a wreath on behalf of the PMO. Manjira Khurana, the regional director of Indian, and J.B. Kaushik, the senior commander of the CISF, also laid wreaths on the body.

 Suryanarayana, who was killed before the expiry of the 24-hour deadline set by the Taliban, is survived by his wife and three children.

 In a strange twist to the tragic tale, another woman with a baby has claimed to be his second wife.

 This is the second incident of abduction of an Indian that has resulted in his death. Last November, Maniappan Raman Kutty, a Border Roads Organisation driver from Allaphuza district in Kerala, was kidnapped and killed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. 

 The government, unlike the US and UK that keep a close check on all their citizens in Afghanistan, seems to have tied itself in knots over how to protect Indians working for foreign firms in the trouble-torn country. Those employed in Indian establishments are provided security by Indo-Tibetan Border Police contingents posted in Afghanistan.

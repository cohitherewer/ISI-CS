 Dalit rally snub to govt, cops

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Dec. 2: Dalit organisations will go ahead with their December 4 protest rally in Nagpur despite government opposition and polices refusal of permission.

 The state government today argued that the rally, planned to highlight atrocities on Dalits, might worsen the tensions generated by Thursdays state-wide riots following the desecration of an Ambedkar statue in Kanpur.

 But emerging from an all-party meeting called to calm tempers, Dalit leaders Ramdas Athavale, Jogendra Kawade and Sulekha Kumbhare slammed the government and announced the rally was on.

 Yesterday, Nagpur police chief S.P.S. Yadav had refused permission for the rally, timed two days ahead of Babasaheb Ambedkars 50th death anniversary and coinciding with the opening of the Assemblys winter session in Nagpur.

 Asked if the rally might not stoke violence, Athavale, leader of one of the Republican Party of India factions, said: Our agitation will be peaceful. So, we have decided to go ahead although the police have refused permission.

 The attack today on the government and police for apathy to Dalit sentiments was led by the RPIs Athavale and R.S. Gavai factions, both part of the states ruling coalition, headed by the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party.

 The more moderate faction of Prakash Ambedkar, which snapped ties with the Congress before the May 2004 polls, skipped the all-party meeting.

 The December 4 rally will focus on the massacre of four members of a Dalit family, the Bhotmanges, at Khairlanji village in Bhandara district in September. Last month, Nagpur saw protests by Dalit groups turn violent.

 Dalit leaders have accused the police of tampering with the evidence and the first information report. Today, they demanded that deputy chief minister R.R. Patil, who holds the home portfolio, be named as a co-accused in the killings. BJP leader Gopinath Munde was quick to back the demand.

 The Dalit leaders asked why the case hadnt yet been handed over to the CBI even though the government has announced a probe by the agency.

 Mumbai police have tightened security to prevent any flare-up because of the Nagpur rally.

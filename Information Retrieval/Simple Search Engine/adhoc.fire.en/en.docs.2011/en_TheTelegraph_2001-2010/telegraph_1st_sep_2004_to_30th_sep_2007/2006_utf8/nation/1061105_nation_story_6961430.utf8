 Summons for Apollo docs

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Nov. 4: Rahul Mahajan may be happily married and seeking an entry into the BJP, but six doctors and two of his fathers aides, accused of concealing evidence, misleading and lying in the drug overdose case, are to be questioned by a city court on January 12. 

 A trial court in Delhi today summoned 14 people, including the doctors at Apollo who treated Rahul after Delhi police filed a chargesheet against them on Wednesday. 

 Additional chief metropolitan magistrate Kamini Lau also directed Pramod Mahajans close aides Sudhanshu Mittal and Harish Sharma also named in the chargesheet to appear on January 12. 

 Apart from the doctors Anupam Sibal, Prasad Rao, Avdesh Bansal, Mukund Pandey, Ali Mohammed Ganai and Abha Gupta six other Apollo employees have been charged with destroying evidence.

 All 14 are charged under Sections 193 and 177 of the IPC fabrication of evidence and giving false information to a public servant, respectively.

 The police believe the Apollo doctors and staff, at the behest of Mittal and Sharma, lied about the health of Rahul, declaring him unwell when he was actually fit, and, thereby, delayed his interrogation. 

 They are also accused of destroying or tampering with his blood and urine samples and of fabricating tests that declared the levels of illegal drugs in his body as within permissible limits.

 Apollo Hospitals tonight said it had done no wrong and welcomed the opportunity to bring forth the facts.

 Mittal and Sharma face stronger charges. Not only are they accused of having bribed the Apollo officials into misleading and lying, they are also accused of destroying evidence at the Mahajan residence at 7 Safdarjung Road.

 CA exam burden eases

 New Delhi, June 22 (PTI): The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India today announced a nearly-one-year cut in course duration and decided to reduce the number of papers, incorporating theoretical lessons within practical training.

 The institute, the apex governing body for chartered accountants in India, said it was going in for the changes ? cutting down the course period to around four years ? to make the syllabus more competitive and comparable to international standards and blend theoretical education with practical training.

 We have undertaken this initiative with a view to meeting challenges posed by information revolution, economic reforms and globalisation combined with international development, its president T.N. Manoharan said.

 The recommendations, which have been sent to the government, means a person can now become a CA at the age of 21 against the earlier threshold level of around 23. 

 The institute, which is facing a shortage of professionals, expects to introduce the new curriculum this November. Under the new system, two professional exams (PE-I and PE-II) ? which require at least two years ? will be substituted with a common proficiency test, which one can write after Class XII.

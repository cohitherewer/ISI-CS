 Third burst in flu belt, sneak-in to MP

 OUR BUREAU

 Mumbai/Bhopal, March 28: Bird flu has surfaced again in Maharashtra ? this time in a much larger area of Jalgaon, which reported the second outbreak ? and has also found its way to neighbouring Madhya Pradesh.

 The Bhopal High Security Animal Disease Laboratory today confirmed that eight samples sent on March 18 had tested positive for avian influenza strains. Seven are from Jalgaon and one from Madhya Pradeshs Icchapur village, just over 3 km away, a Union animal husbandry department statement said.

 The lab said they had confirmed H5 strains, and are trying to confirm the N1 strains. The seven positive samples come from six villages in Jalgaon ? two are located in talukas that were infected before and the rest are in the neighbourhood.

 We have to repeat the bird flu control drill. Culling operations of an estimated 2.5 lakh birds would begin from Wednesday, Maharashtra animal husbandry commissioner Bijay Kumar said from Pune. 

 Of the 2.5 lakh birds, 75,000 come from organised poultry and the rest from backyard poultries, he said. 

 Maharashtra, which reported the countrys first outbreak in Navapur and then another in Jalgaon, has completed two bird flu control operations according to World Health Organisations specifications. The latest outbreak poses tougher challenges since it involves culling more birds over a larger area ? 288 villages as compared to 175 the last time.

 Over the past week when bird flu seemed to be on the decline, scientists at the Bhopal lab ? the only one in the country equipped to test for H5N1 ? had expressed concern over the presence of a live chain of the disease for such a long period in spite of largescale culling and cordoning of affected zones. 

 On condition of anonymity, a scientist said: It is quite certain that the virus (H5NI) is still in the environment and a direct link exists, as H5N1 cannot transmit without a live carrier. This live chain has to be broken as the disease is transmitted from bird to bird and not through air.

 A fortnight ago, a truck carrying birds from Maharashtra was detained but later let off in Burhanpur, where Ichhapur is located. On the following day, over 400 chickens died. Burhanpur poultry merchants are now blaming the mysterious truck. 

 Rajesh Rajora, the Madhya Pradesh animal husbandry commissioner, refused to confirm or deny the possibility of unauthorised chicken making its way into the state but ordered culling of over 8,000 birds in Ichhapur and surrounding areas. 

 We have set up 28 emergency teams of cullers and vaccinators, which are working round the clock, he said.

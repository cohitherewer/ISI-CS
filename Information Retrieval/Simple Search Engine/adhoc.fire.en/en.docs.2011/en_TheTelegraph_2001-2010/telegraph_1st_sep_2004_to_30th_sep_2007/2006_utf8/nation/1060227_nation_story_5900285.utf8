 Mumbai power punch

 Mumbai, Feb. 26 (PTI): The states power regulator has asked BEST, the citys electricity supplier, to slap a 100 per cent fine on people using more than 300 units of power a month.

 The directive by the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (Merc), which comes after a tariff revision proposal submitted by BEST (Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport) Undertaking, was released yesterday.

 It says all residential and commercial consumers using more than 300 units a month and all industrial consumers will have to reduce consumption to 80 per cent of their average corresponding monthly consumption in the past year (January to December 2005).

 According to BEST CEO Swadhin Kshatriya, the move will hit the rich the hardest. With their multiple air-conditioners and fancy gadgets that guzzle power, they crowd the list of people who cross the 300-unit line.

 Merc has said if consumers do not follow the order, they would have to pay double the highest tariff chargeable for the category. 

 Not just consumers, the order could have serious implications for BEST as well, which uses power generation to cross-subsidise its fleet of buses. The order makes a veiled suggestion of stopping the subsidy. Kshatriya said if the subsidy is disturbed, it could impact public transport. 

 If flouters will be made to pay heavily, followers of the Merc directive will get a sop. For every reduction in monthly consumption below the 80 per cent limit, there will be a relief of 50 per cent of the normal chargeable rate in the monthly bill. 

 Maharashtra is reeling under an average shortage of 3,500-4,000 mw of power every day, which has plunged several parts into darkness for at least four-six hours daily.

 Pockets of Mumbai, where electricity is supplied by Reliance Energy and Tata, are facing a power shortage of 400-450 mw. 

 The state government had earlier appealed to Mumbais residents to restrict their power consumption as it would not be able to supply additional power to the city this summer.

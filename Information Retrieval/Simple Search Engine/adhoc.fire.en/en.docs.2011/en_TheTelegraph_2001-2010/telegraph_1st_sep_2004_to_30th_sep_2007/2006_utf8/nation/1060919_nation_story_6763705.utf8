 Finer points missing from terror plan

 K.P. NAYAR 

 Washington, Sept. 18: The 

 idea of a joint mechanism for counter-terrorism, including 

 investigation of terrorist acts, has been accepted by India 

 and Pakistan at their Havana summit meeting without much 

 thought being given to how this initiative will be implemented.

 The Intelligence Bureau (IB), the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), the external spy agency, and others involved in gathering intelligence on Pakistan are expected to fiercely resist any idea of joining Pakistanis on counter-terrorism by sharing any worthwhile intelligence.

 These agencies believe Pakistan is the problem, not the solution to terrorism. 

 Other sections in the government, including those in the ministry of external affairs, are willing to separate Pervez Musharraf from Pakistans overall terrorist infrastructure. 

 They blame cross-border terrorism on forces Musharraf is unable to control.

 For the first time in the history of India-Pakistan dialogue, a bilateral initiative has been launched without agreeing on any of its details.

 Since 1947, every institutional arrangement between the two governments has been made public after the two sides flushed out every thorny detail, lest they came up with problems of implementation because of a yawning deficit of trust between the two sides.

 Not this time. The incoming foreign secretary, Shiv Shankar Menon, admitted as much during his briefing in Havana when he said: Who will compose it and how it will be implemented is something we will see.

 Conventional wisdom dictates that this initiative could go the way of the ill-considered, ill-fated Gujral doctrine, which was announced by Delhi a decade ago amid grand publicity without any thought about its fallout.

 The implementation of the joint counter-terrorism mechanism will be a major challenge for Menon. He may rely on his exceptionally good working relationship through the years with the IB and the RAW for its smooth sailing.

 The challenge is equally daunting for Islamabad: Musharraf knows that huge sections of the Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) still write their own rules although Pakistans ruler has changed course on terrorism.

 The new mechanism provides an insight into the worldview of the foreign secretary-designate, whose perceptions on terrorism have been shaped by his postings in three countries torn apart by terror: Israel, Sri Lanka and Pakistan.

 A posting in Pakistan also exposes the high commissioner to the problems of violence in Afghanistan and the network that makes it possible.

 The decision to create the new India-Pakistan framework on counter-terrorism reflects Delhis new position that little more can be achieved on cross-border terrorism by relying on the US, where the Bush administration will be a lame duck after the November elections to the Congress.

 For more than a decade, India has relied on the US to put pressure on Islamabad to control the forces, which export terror to India: until well after September 11, 2001, these forces were part of the Pakistan government.

 According to those who have heard Menons views during internal government discussions, he believes that the Bush administrations attack on Iraq and its subsequent helplessness in controlling violence there has emboldened terrorists worldwide.

 In South Asia, it is reflected in the recent ascendancy of the Tamil Tigers in Sri Lanka, the Maoists in Nepal, the resurgence of the Talibaan in Afghanistan and the growth of fringe terror outfits elsewhere in India.

 With his experience in Tel Aviv, Menon believes that the Hizbollahs ability to proclaim its recent conflict with Israel as a victory with reasonable justification will further fuel terrorism in South Asia and elsewhere.

 Such an assessment is shared by national security adviser M.K. Narayanan. 

 Hence, the latest effort to largely give up relying on the US to control cross-border terrorism and deal directly with Pakistan in this regard.

 Ex-minister held for molesting

 Murshidabad: Former minister of state for civil defence Wahed Reja was arrested from his Kandi residence, nearly 235 km from Calcutta, on Tuesday on charges of molesting a woman and cheating her of Rs 30,000. 

 He has been remanded in judicial custody for 14 days by a Kandi court.

 District superintendent Niraj Kumar Singh said Reja had promised Manera Bibi of Hatpara, Kandi, a job eight years back against a payment of Rs 30,000 but soon after he went into hiding. 

 On April 3, Manera came to know that Reja has returned home. So she went and demanded her money. Reja asked her to meet him on Tuesday morning. When she arrived at his residence he denied her money and molested her. Her shouts drew attention of residents who informed the police, Singh said.

 Indian in jail for missile plot

Washington (PTI): A man of Indian origin has been sent to 

five years in jail for his involvement in a plot to sell Stinger anti-aircraft 

missiles to al Qaida.

 Ilyas Ali, a naturalised US citizen, and two Pakistanis pleaded guilty to providing material support to terrorists and a conspiracy to distribute heroin and hashish.

 San Diego district judge James Lorenz sentenced Ali to 57 months in prison on Monday.

 In 2002, Ali, along with Pakistanis Syed Mustajab Shah and Muhammed Abid Afridi, met US undercover officers in Hong Kong and agreed to sell them 5 metric tonnes of hashish and 600 kg of heroin for the cost of four Stinger missiles, the indictment said. 

 The three said they planned to sell the missiles to the Taliban, which, they indicated, was the same as al Qaida. They were arrested in Hong Kong in September 2002. While Afridi also got the same punishment in the same court a week ago, Shah will be sentenced on June 19.

 Clash curfew

 Jaipur (PTI): An indefinite curfew was imposed on Tuesday 

after a clash over a Mahavir Jayanti procession in the walled city of Pali.

 Tension erupted as some people of a minority community objected to the procession passing through their area and threw stones at it, superintendent of police Vinay Kumar said.

 Sarabjit meeting

New Delhi (PTI): The family of Sarabjit Singh, the Indian 

prisoner facing execution in Pakistan for spying, will meet President 

A.P.J. Abdul Kalam on Wednesday. Sarabjits sister Dalbir Kaur said they 

will appeal for a written communication from Delhi to Islamabad to free him.

 Mansarovar yatra

Pithoragarh (PTI): The annual Kailash-Mansarovar yatra will 

begin from June 1. With any increase in the number of pilgrims being ruled out, 

16 batches will be allowed to travel to the Tibetan lake.

 Tata, L amp;T in artillery race

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 30: The Tatas and Larsen amp; Toubro are in the race for a first Indian military order for the private sector since the defence production policy was liberalised. 

 The two companies are looking to win the order to manufacture multiple barrel rocket launchers called Pinaka, after having been associated with its development for the past decade with the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO).

 The order could be valued at about Rs 1,400 crore in the first phase to equip eight (artillery) regiments with the system. 

 The development of the Pinaka is behind schedule and the Indian Army was looking to fill in the gap by contracting 24 Smerch MRLS from Russia. The two companies have also been associated with the Akash missile ? it was test-fired today near Balasore in Orissa ? and claim to integrate commonalities of the two weapon systems.

 While L amp;T contributed to the making of a two-axis DC servo drive for the Pinaka, Tata Advanced Materials Limited have developed the containers and tubes.

 The Pinaka, a multiple barrelled rocket launcher with 12 tubes, is capable of firing a salvo of 12 rockets at a maximum distance of 40 km in the plains with a 100 kg warhead.

 The Tatas are also competing for an order to upgrade the Bofors Howitzers with the Indian Army as also for the up-gunning of 130 mm guns to 155 mm/52 cal, for which the Israeli company Soltam has bagged a partial order. 

 M.N. Bhagwat, chairman (strategic council) of Tata Power Strategic Electronics Division, said here today that the company was waiting for the tenders. The Tatas were also in talks with western arms majors to forge joint ventures in defence manufacture.

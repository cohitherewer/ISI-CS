 Jaswant sorry for spy story

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 27: The BJP bigwigs today gave a miss to the official release of Jaswant Singhs controversial book A Call To Honour: In Service of Emergent India.

 But that wouldnt be the only talking point of the evening. After almost a fortnight of being at the receiving end of a raging controversy, Singh confessed that he regretted writing the book.

 The confession came in the course of a conversation. 

 The function was to start with a panel discussion on A Call to Honour: Are we up to it? Mark Tully, one of the panelists, asked Singh before the discussion whether it would have been better for him to not write the book. The reference clearly was to the controversy regarding the CIA mole in Narasimha Raos PMO.

 Singh said: ? I thought for a while. I agree with Mark.

 Let me say this once and for all that I never had any intention to cause any sensations. Everything that is there in the book comes from the very innards of my heart.

 The former foreign ministers family and friends were there in the packed audience, but neither Atal Bihari Vajpayee nor L.K. Advani.

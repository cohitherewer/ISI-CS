 Mumbai eyes NY-style cabs

 - Taxi union protests fleet plan 

 Days numbered? Taxi drivers at a protest. 

File picture 

 Come Diwali, and Mumbaikars could be zip, zap, zooming around town in New York-style taxicabs. And paying in plastic, if they were to be short of cash.

 If the states proposal for swank fleet taxis does see the light of day, the smoke-spewing Premier Padminis could be replaced by bigger fuel-efficient cars that would give passengers printed receipts for every payment made.

 Which car would replace the ubiquitous Premier Padmini is not known, but it would have a minimum 1000cc capacity and a global positioning system that would help track it anywhere in the city. 

 The whole point is to have fewer taxis on our traffic-choked streets while making the quality of service international, state principal secretary, transport, G.S. Gill said. As of now, there are 55,000 taxis in Mumbai. We are proposing bigger but fewer taxis. The credit card facility is an added USP of the fleet taxi. 

 Gill said the point of the scheme, modelled on the taxi services of New York and Singapore, was to cut down the number of cabs on the streets. Even New York, one of the biggest cities in the world, has just 26,000 taxis. What are we doing with such a large number?

 He said the government proposed to do this by not issuing new permits for fleet taxis. Any person proposing to run a fleet ? 5,000-10,000 taxis ? would have to buy permits from existing taxi owners and employ the driver. 

 We will not give any new permits. The fleet operator will have to buy the permits from those taxi owners who currently have them, said Gill.

 Each fleet operator would be given an operating licence and have a control room. The proposal was to have four or five such operators, each of whose taxis would have a different colour band for easy identification. 

 We have already received proposals from two firms for participating in the fleet taxi scheme, he said.

 How the government plans to phase out the existing taxis is not clear, but Gill confirmed that was the ultimate objective. The scheme is expected to roll in four months.

 But taxi drivers are already up in arms. Not so fast, Bombay Taxi Union president Alex Quadros said, threatening to stall the proposed kick-off. 

 This credit card thing and international standard service drone is all hogwash. We will go all out and oppose this fleet taxi scheme because it will turn owner-drivers into slaves of large organisations, he said.

 Quadros also questioned if the powers-that-be had thought about what would happen to drivers who did not own taxis. They will be on the streets because they will have no permits to sell to fleet taxi companies. They will be completely at their mercy for their jobs, he said.

 Although Gill has said the concerns of the taxi unions would be looked into, Quadros said: We will not let this scheme take off.

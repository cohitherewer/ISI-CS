 Left swivels SEZ scanner on Mukesh

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mukesh: Note poser

 Calcutta, Oct. 20: The Left wants changes to the Centres special economic zones act that could hurt Mukesh Ambanis plans in Maharashtra and Haryana.

 In a note sent to Sonia Gandhi yesterday, the Left parties have opposed the allotment of huge tracts of land to private companies, mentioning this has in some instances exceeded 10,000 hectares.

 If private entities are allowed to own such huge tracts of land, it would amount to the re-establishment of the zamindari system 60 years after Independence. This is totally unacceptable, the note says.

 Reliance has been given tracts larger than 10,000 hectares to set up special economic zones in Maha Mumbai and Haryana.

 The note, drafted by the CPM and finalised with inputs from other Left parties, wants a ceiling on SEZ land that can be developed by a private company. It is also opposed to private developers getting to own the land.

 There should be no transfer of land ownership to the private developer. Private developers should only be allowed to take land on lease or build the infrastructure on a BOT (build-operate-transfer) basis, says the note, which will be taken up at the next United Progressive Alliance-Left coordination committee meeting.

 The Left wants the land of closed industrial units made available for SEZs. Its wish list includes a national rehabilitation policy for displaced farmers.

 A fast-track mechanism should be set up, by changing existing statutes if necessary, for unlocking the land of the closed units so that they can be made available for building SEZs or other industries, the note suggests.

 It seeks caps on the various categories of the special zones, citing that China has only six of them. Initially, the Centre had decided to cap the number of special zones in the country to 150, but later changed its mind.

 There should be separate caps for the total number of multi-product and sector-specific SEZs, the note says.

 The Left wants state governments to have a say in the matter of SEZs being set up, and has suggested that the Bengal model of land use half the land reserved for industry and another fourth for related infrastructure be followed across the country.

 One of the Lefts biggest concerns is the revenue implication of the tax holidays being given under the SEZ policy.

 According to media reports, internal estimates of the finance ministry suggest a revenue loss of Rs 1,75,487 crore against an estimated investment of Rs 3,60,000 crore. The issue cannot be brushed aside by saying that these revenue losses are notional, the note argues.

 Soccer leash on cable operators

 Calcutta: Delhi High Court has restrained 92 cable operators, including 30 to 35 networks in Bengal, from unauthorisedly broadcasting the Fifa World Cup on a petition by ESPN-STAR Sports, says a staff reporter.

 The broadcaster holds the official rights to the tournament for India.

 Vacation judge Justice P.K. Bhasin asked the channel to take police help to ensure compliance of the order.

 The injunction will apply to cable operators in Bengal, Assam, Tripura, Bihar, Jharkhand, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka, Kerala and Punjab.

 The World Cup matches are also available on free-to-air channels from Russia, China and Cambodia. But it is illegal to show the tournament on any other channel... in India since we have the exclusive rights, said Rajesh Kaul, associate vice-president, affiliate sales, for ESPN Software India.

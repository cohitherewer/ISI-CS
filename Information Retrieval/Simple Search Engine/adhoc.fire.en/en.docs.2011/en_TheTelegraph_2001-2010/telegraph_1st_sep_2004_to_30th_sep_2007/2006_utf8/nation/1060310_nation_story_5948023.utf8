 Debt alert in Bengal token budget

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, March 9: With no new announcements of taxes or concessions because of elections and the revelation that Bengal is reeling under a staggering debt of Rs 1.25 lakh crore, finance minister Asim Dasgupta presented the 2006-07 budget in the Bengal Assembly today.

 The budget size is about Rs 42,000 crore and its deficit has been estimated at Rs 2 crore, with promises of more production, employment and investment in the next fiscal.

 The finance minister did not announce any new projects because of the model code of conduct, but hinted that he might come up with a supplementary budget for raising revenue after the polls.

 The government has the option to go in for additional resource mobilisation, the finance minister said, asked whether he would make a move to raise taxes. In the 2005-06 budget, Dasgupta had sought to raise additional resources of Rs 100 crore.

 According to the minister, 5.25 lakh employment opportunities had been generated in the ongoing fiscal year and allocations for almost all sectors have been increased in this years budget.

 There has been a hike in plan outlay for industry, power, urban development, health, education, public health engineering and irrigation.

 In the absence of taxes and concessions, this years budget turned out to be a tame one, but for the increase in the plan size by 19 per cent, pegged at Rs 8,024 crore.

 The non-plan expenditure works out to about Rs 34,000 crore, which, according to Dasgupta, is a mere 1 per cent increase and hence good.

 Of the Rs 42,000-crore budget, Rs 26,000 crore will be spent on salary, wages, pension and interest payments, which means more than 61 per cent of the budget will not be used for asset creation.

 On the revenue front, the state government has been able to exceed its tax and non-tax revenue targets, the total amount collected being Rs 12,314 crore.

 As for 2006-07, the budget aims to double the earnings from service tax from Rs 372 crore to Rs 734 crore.

 However, the revenue deficit has crossed Rs 8,000 crore, throwing up questions on the health of the states economy.

 The 2005-06 budget had talked about a revenue deficit of about Rs 7,000 crore, but it exceeded the figure, according to the revised estimates. This years budget has projected a Rs 8,000-crore-plus revenue deficit.

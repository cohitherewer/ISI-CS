 PM regrets Asma search

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Asma Jehangir

 New Delhi, Aug. 3: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has apologised to Pakistani human rights activist Asma Jehangir after her hotel room was searched by Delhi police last night without a warrant and apparently without any reason. 

 Asma, who is based in Lahore, was here with four other delegates to discuss human rights violations in South Asian countries.

 Singh, who knows Asma for some time, phoned her and apologised for the inconvenience caused, a PMO official said. He explained there was heightened security at the moment as a result of which the police was on high alert. Asma, who left for Lahore this evening, was asked by Singh to return to India soon. She thanked him for his call. 

 Asma and the other delegates, who included Justice Fakhruddin G. Ibrahim, a Pakistan High Court judge, I.B.N. Abdur Rehman, an activist from Nepal, Mohammadi Siddiqui and Shiranthi Jayatilake from Sri Lanka, had checked into a hotel in Sunder Nagar in South Delhi on Monday. 

 Minutes later, two policemen reportedly barged into their rooms and began checking their baggage. There was no woman constable despite the presence of two women, Asma and Mohammadi. The delegates were told the search was part of the security arrangements before Independence Day. But the delegates wondered why they were subjected to it, as they were highly respected citizens in their countries.

 Asma, for instance, is a familiar face and voice on every serious Indo-Pak friendship forum in India. She is known as an outspoken critic of civil rights abuses in Pakistan and, through the years she has visited India, never faced any humiliation inflicted by the state.

 Following the Prime Ministers call, Delhi police ordered a high-level probe into the searches. Earlier, a police official, Anil Shukla, maintained that the rooms were searched after the hotel owner informed the police that foreigners had checked in.

 Congress party-pooper for PM 

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 New Delhi, May 5: The United Progressive Alliance government will complete its second year in office this month, but Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Congress president Sonia Gandhi have little reason for cheer.

 The source of their problems is, however, not the Left or other UPA constituents ? its the Congress itself.

 The party is worried that a poor showing in the Assembly elections could raise serious questions about the governments performance and embolden those speaking out against Singh, covertly and openly.

 Party sources specifically referred to human resource development minister Arjun Singh, the man behind the OBC quota, former external affairs minister K. Natwar Singh, who attacked the nuclear deal with the US, and panchayati raj minister Mani Shankar Aiyar.

 Aiyar reportedly suggested that he was shunted out of petroleum and natural gas for advocating the Iran gas pipeline and running foul of the US.

 While the sources said there was no germ of rebellion or dissidence against the Prime Minister in their moves and statements, ministers speaking out against collective cabinet decisions was bad news. 

 The reference was to science and technology minister Kapil Sibals objections to the OBC quota. We are supplying issues on a platter to the BJP. They are bound to play up the contradictions when Parliament meets (from May 10), said a source.

 The Congresss OBC MPs were clear that they would back Arjun the whole hog ? despite an indication from Sonia that the party should not recreate a Mandal-like polarised ambience.

 Amethi MP Rahul Gandhi echoed his mothers view when he called the OBC reservation issue very complex. In Rae Bareli, Rahul said recently: Both sides (the proponents and the opponents) have valid points.

 It did not deter the Congresss OBC MPs from saying that the law on the OBC quota should be pushed through.

 V. Hanumantha Rao, a Rajya Sabha MP from Andhra Pradesh and convener of the parliamentary forum of backward-caste MPs, said there were at least 50 backward-caste MPs in the Congress, or roughly one-third of the partys strength. Therefore, there was no way they could take a wishy-washy stand.

 The backward castes are 60 per cent of the population and when someone takes the argument of merit, is he suggesting that every member of these castes is unintelligent and unfit? Rao asked.

 The forum, he added, would meet before the Parliament session begins to formalise its position.

 On the other hand, a younger MP like the Wharton-educated Sachin Pilot argued that merit could not be overlooked. Pilot, who also attends the OBC forum meetings regularly, said: My sense is that large sections of our society need support and we have to give it. But we cant compromise on merit. Meritorious students from the forward castes shouldnt feel deprived but backward-caste students shouldnt feel neglected at the same time.

 Like Rahul, Sachin feels social tensions should be kept at bay.

 However, sections of the Congress seemed convinced that Arjun was out to score brownie points over the Prime Minister while Sibal was speaking on Singhs behalf, and the political dichotomy could undermine the governments and the partys image without any political dividend.

 Singh has also been criticised for his obsession with growth figures. Some party leaders said it was time the government focused on projecting its pro-people initiatives.

 Whether the Prime Minister is meeting a delegation of Muslims from Jama Masjid or the German Chancellor, his pet statement is India must achieve a 12 per cent growth rate, said a functionary.

 How will this obsession translate into political benefits when inflation is on a high and the government shows no sign of controlling it?

 New Delhi, Sept. 3: The Centre has decided to strengthen the Border Roads Organisation (BRO), the military outfit that builds and maintains frontier roads, reinforcing a policy decision taken in June to strengthen communications along the frontage with China.

 The cabinet committee on security (CCS) yesterday accepted a proposal from the defence ministry to restructure the BRO and lifted a ceiling on recruitment into the service imposed in 2002. The BRO will recruit 5,071 personnel in two years, finance minister P. Chidambaram announced after the meeting.

 The BRO currently has about 36,000 personnel on its rolls but relies on casual paid labour for its projects. About 70,000 labourers are engaged in construction for the BRO.

 The decision to strengthen the BRO comes after the CCS reversed a policy of not upgrading physical communication links in sensitive zones close to the China border. It approved Rs 992 crore to build and upgrade 608 km of roads and also three abandoned airfields. Many of these roads are in the Northeast.

 In the BROs estimate, the average road density in border regions is a poor 16 km per 100 sq km. The national average is 80 km per 100 sq km.

 Chidambaram also announced that the CCS has approved the design and development of a light combat helicopter (LCH) by the defence public sector company Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) for Rs 340 crore. The LCH project is already running behind schedule.

 In 2001, HAL had showcased the concept for the LCH and was expecting to have it ready by 2005. In 2003, the then air force chief, Air Chief Marshal S. Krishnaswamy, also committed Rs 300 crore for the project. But HAL and the defence production wing have not been able to get cracking on the project so far.

 The LCH is proposed to be a combat and gunship version of the Dhruv advanced light helicopter. It is being made specifically for counter-insurgency operations by the army and the air force in high-altitude areas. 

 The need for an LCH was projected after the Indian Air Forces Soviet-origin gunships, Mi-25 and Mi-35, were found to be inadequate for the task in Kargil.

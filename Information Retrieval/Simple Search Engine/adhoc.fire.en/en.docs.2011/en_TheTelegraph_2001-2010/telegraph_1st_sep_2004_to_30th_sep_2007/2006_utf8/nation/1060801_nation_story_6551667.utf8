 Buddha build-up and the burst

 - from chief minister to state CPM chief, bad hair day in office

 Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee: I want him (Dalmiya) to leave this organisation

 Calcutta, July 31: The morning after the loss of face in the CAB elections, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee seemed in no mood to talk.

 At a ceremony where the Salim Group signed an investment agreement with the state government, he sat grimly. Asked for a comment, he waved it away, saying: I will speak on this. But this is not the right time.

 When he arrived at Writers Buildings in the afternoon, the chief minister was bombarded with questions about Jagmohan Dalmiyas victory against his candidate Prasun Mukherjee. Again, he refused to speak.

 I wont comment now, Bhattacharjee said twice, walking past the podium towards his chamber.

 But the questions didnt stop and suddenly, the dam burst. He turned around and walked back to the podium. 

 What followed was a no-holds-barred attack on the CAB president.

 It is a victory of evil over good, over right-thinking people. This happens at times, Bhattacharjee began. 

 The chief minister usually refrains from commenting on unpleasant issues but is also known for his emotional outbursts.

 Todays explosion was his first public attack against Dalmiya since Bhattacharjee declared a month ago that he didnt want him to contest and had asked sports minister Subhas Chakraborty to dissuade him.

 Asked why he had got himself publicly embroiled in the CAB polls, he shot back: I do not believe in secret conspiracy. Whatever I do, I do openly and shall continue to do in the future. I have a clear mind? and a clear conscience. 

 So preoccupied was Bhattacharjee that he walked back to the podium twice ? to answer more queries ? after he had appeared to finish speaking.

 Our future is doomed, he barked, when asked if Dalmiyas presence would hurt Bengal cricket. I can never compromise with such persons. I want him to leave this organisation, he said with a wave of his hand.

 No question went unanswered as the chief minister even fielded a teaser on whether this was the equivalent of a jihad being declared on Dalmiya.

 If thats what you think, you can go ahead and write that. Do you think this victory bodes well? he asked. 

 On receiving no reply, he bristled: So do you have an axe to grind in this matter? If youre close to him (Dalmiya), youll obviously support this victory.

 Having let out the steam, Bhattacharjee looked a much more relaxed man when he left office at the end of the day.

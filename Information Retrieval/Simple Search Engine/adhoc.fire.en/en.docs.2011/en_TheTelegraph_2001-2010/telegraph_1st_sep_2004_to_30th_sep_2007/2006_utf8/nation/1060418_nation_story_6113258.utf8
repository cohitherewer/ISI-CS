 Booth-jam, EC style

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Keshpur (West Midnapore), April 17: The Election Commission wanted a rigging-free poll in Keshpur. Its efforts led to booth-jamming of another kind.

 At 9 pm today, several hundred people still stood in queues at several booths, with the poll percentage having already reached 80.

 The constituency in West Midnapore had been under the commissions scanner because the turnout in 2001 had been an astounding 85.53 per cent, and CPM candidate Nandarani Dals victory margin the highest at 1.08 lakh.

 This time, the commission had instructed its officials, the details of every photo-identity card should be jotted down to prevent any possibility of rigging.

 The poll panel also had in mind the bloody clashes in Keshpur from 1998 to 2001 between CPM and Trinamul Congress supporters that killed 120 people and forced 10,000 to flee their homes.

 As polling officers meticulously took down the details of every photo-identity card in sight, the voting hit a bottleneck.

 With just about 40 votes being polled in an hour, people had to wait for hours before they could punch in their preference.

 Polling continued till late in the night at Chhutorgeria. At Neradeul, about 100 voters stood in front of the Konai High School at 9 pm.

 Yet the turnout continued to be high with three booths, including Dhalhara and Damodarchak, registering 95 per cent.

 I have been standing in queue since 4.30 pm. But I shall cast my vote even if I have to wait till midnight, said Mantu Chakraborty at a booth in Singagai.

 The observer for Keshpur, Manmohan Singh, kept travelling from booth to booth in a cream-coloured Sumo since 7 am.

 Deputy election commissioner Anand Kumar, overseeing the days polling in West Midnapore, Purulia and Bankura, arrived at Keshpur around 6 pm. He visited several booths and spoke to presiding officers. Everything is fine, he told reporters.

 The huge turnout impressed Kumar. So many people have turned out to vote that double lines had to be formed at some booths, he said. Had the voters stood in a single queue, it would have stretched out of the polling premises.

 The turnout of securitymen was no less impressive. Every booth was manned by about a dozen paramilitary jawans with automatic weapons. Jawans also stood on rooftops with light machine guns.

 On polling day in 2001, the whole of Keshpur had been draped in red flags. There were none today following the poll panels curbs.

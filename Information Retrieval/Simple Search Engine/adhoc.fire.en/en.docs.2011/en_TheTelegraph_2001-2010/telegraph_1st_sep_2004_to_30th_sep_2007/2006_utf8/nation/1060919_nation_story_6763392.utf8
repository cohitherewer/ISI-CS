 Breather on Haj but test ahead

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Sept. 18: The Supreme Court today allowed the government to subsidise Haj travel this year, lifting a cloud of uncertainty that crept in after an Uttar Pradesh court ruled against state funding of any pilgrimage.

 However, a decision whether the subsidy would continue after this year would be taken by Allahabad High Court, where a petition against the financial aid is pending.

 The high court had ordered an interim stay on the subsidy, which was challenged by the Centre in the Supreme Court.

 The apex court granted temporary relief to the Centre today, while asking the high court to dispose of the case before the 2007 pilgrimage begins.

 The Supreme Court also issued notices to all parties concerned, including the petitioner who had challenged the subsidy before the high court. 

 The court said there should be no objection to the government making arrangements for pilgrimage but a direct financial subsidy was prima facie not permissible. 

 The court sought to know from solicitor-general G.E. Vahanvati whether such a subsidy was provided by the government for any other pilgrimage. 

 When Vahanvati referred to the government expense on the Kailash Mansarovar yatra, the court said it was not a subsidy but expenditure incurred by the government for making arrangements. 

 The interim relief to the government came after the Centre submitted that the high court order was likely to derail this years Haj, the arrangements for which were being put in place since May.

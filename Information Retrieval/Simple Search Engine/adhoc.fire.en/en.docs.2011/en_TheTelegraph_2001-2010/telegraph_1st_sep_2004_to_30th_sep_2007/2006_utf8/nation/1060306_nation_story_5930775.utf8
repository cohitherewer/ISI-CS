 Rape victims catch apex courts ear

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 5: A rape victims testimony should be given greater importance than any other assault victim as a woman would be extremely reluctant even to admit that any incident which is likely to reflect on her chastity had ever occurred, the Supreme Court has said.

 In the Indian setting, refusal to act on the testimony of a victim of sexual assault in the absence of corroboration as a rule is adding insult to injury, the bench of Justices Arijit Passayat and S.H. Kapadia said.

 However, if a court found it difficult to accept the victims version on its face value, it may search for evidence, direct or circumstantial, to lend assurance to her testimony.

 A rape victim runs the risk of being ostracised by society, so her testimony is an in-built assurance that the charge is genuine rather than fabricated, the court pointed out, while partly allowing an appeal against a Rajasthan High Court judgment.

 Calling upon judges to deal with such cases with sensitivity, the court cited a 2003 Supreme Court order against mentioning the name of rape victims in judgments.

 A socially sensitised judge, in our opinion, is a better statutory armour in cases of crime against women than long clauses of penal provisions containing complex exceptions and provisos, Justice Passayat wrote in the judgment.

 Rape is not only a crime against the person of a woman, it is a crime against the entire society and such cases need to be dealt with sternly and severely, the bench said.

 The observations came while the apex court was reducing the sentence of Dinesh alias Buddha who had raped an eight-year-old scheduled caste girl. Dineshs term was reduced from life imprisonment to 10 years.

 The court noted that there was nothing to prove that the girl was raped and hence life term could not be imposed under the provisions of the SC and the ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. 

 Under the Indian Penal Code, a man convicted of raping a girl below 12 years could be imprisoned for a term ranging from 10 years to life. A jail term of less than 10 years could be imposed by the courts only for adequate and special reasons mentioned in the judgment.

 The court also said the socio-economic status, religion, race, caste or creed of the accused or the victim are irrelevant considerations in the sentencing policy, which must depend on the conduct of the accused, the state and age of the victim and the gravity of the criminal act.

 Refusing to further reduce Dineshs jail term to below the minimum 10 years, the court noted that public abhorrence of the crime needs reflection through imposition of appropriate sentence by the court.

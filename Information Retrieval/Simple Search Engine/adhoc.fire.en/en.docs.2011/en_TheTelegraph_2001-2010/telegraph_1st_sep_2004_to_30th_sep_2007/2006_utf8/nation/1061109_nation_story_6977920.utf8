 Dibrugarh, Nov. 8: Bullets allegedly fired by soldiers at fleeing Ulfa militants killed a five-year-old boy and wounded his teenaged sister in an Upper Assam village today.

 Debojit Moran was playing with his sister Dipanjali, 14, near their home at Number 1 Mohong village of Tinsukia district when they saw two youths running past them and an army team in hot pursuit. Before the children realised what was happening, bullets struck Debojit in the hand and stomach. 

 My brother died instantly. I realised that something had hit me, too, and blood was gushing out of my stomach, Dipanjali said from her bed at the Assam Medical College and Hospital, grimacing as she struggled for words to describe the experience.

 The All Assam Moran Students Union and the All Assam Muttock Yuba Chatra Sanmelan announced a 24-hour Tinsukia district bandh on Friday. Both organisations were at the vanguard of the anti-army campaign in the wake of the custody death of Ajit Mahanta in the same district in February.

 The incident occurred around 9.30 am when troops from the 19 Kumaon Regiment were in the middle of of an operation in the village after receiving information about the presence of Ulfa militants in the area. The army issued an unsigned statement claiming that Debojit was killed in firing by the fleeing militants.

 A witness contradicted the armys version and corroborated what Dipanjali told the media. He said the bullets missed the fleeing youths and hit the siblings.

 Asked repeatedly who fired the bullets, Dipanjali, too, said the soldiers did.

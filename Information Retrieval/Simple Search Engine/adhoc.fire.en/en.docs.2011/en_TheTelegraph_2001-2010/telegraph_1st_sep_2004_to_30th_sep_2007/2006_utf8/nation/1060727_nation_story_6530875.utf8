The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Same IIM cut-off for all

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, July 26: The 

 Indian institutes of management have decided that the 50 

 per cent cut-off for general category admissions will also 

 apply to other backward class students.

 We have kept it at 50 per cent because of the lack of reliable data or research to decide what the acceptable norm should be. The government, too, hasnt come out with any proposal or recommendation on this issue as yet, said Asish Bhattacharyya, chairman, admissions, IIM Calcutta.

 IIMs do not maintain caste-related records of students appearing for the entrance test. But with reservation inevitable, the common admissions test (CAT) application has now been structured to track the necessary information.

 The six-member CAT group, with representatives from all the six IIMs, met here to discuss issues related to the November 19 all-India entrance test. Around 1,75,000 students are expected to sit for CAT this year.

 While OBC students will have to meet the same criteria as general category students in the first stage, the CAT group is yet to decide on the norms for the later stages. There may be some relaxation (for OBCs) during group discussions and personal interviews, said Bhattacharyya.

 During the two-day meeting on the Joka campus, the CAT group also addressed the confusion over cut-off marks for students from universities that offer both honours and pass degrees in graduation. 

 According to the guidelines, to be eligible for admission to postgraduate programmes in management, a candidate must hold a bachelors degree with at least 50 per cent marks.

 This may lead to some confusion among students from Calcutta University or other universities that offer honours degree. We want to make it clear that students have to get 50 per cent in honours papers. However, pass course candidates can also sit for CAT if their aggregate is 50 per cent or above, Bhattacharyya explained.

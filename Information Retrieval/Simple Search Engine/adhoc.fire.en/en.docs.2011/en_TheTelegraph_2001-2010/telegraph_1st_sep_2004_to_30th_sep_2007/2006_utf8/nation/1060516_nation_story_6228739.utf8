 Track trains as you wait

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Kanpur, May 15: The public address system is incomprehensible and the monitor displaying the status of trains clueless. The wait for trains could soon be a little less tiresome, thanks to an IIT Kanpur innovation.

 A team of scientists from the institute has devised a system to track the movement of trains every 20 seconds and relay the images on plasma screens installed on railway platforms.

 The system was put on trial yesterday evening at the Kanpur Central Station.

 Prof N.S. Vyas, coordinator of the Satellite Imaging for Railway Navigation Project in which IIT Kanpurs mechanical engineering and computer science departments were involved, said the germ of the idea lay in a husband and wife talking on a mobile phone. 

 Like the cellphone, a device, much more sophisticated and sensitive, has been developed, which we have named Global Positioning System, a mechanism that functions on the basic principles of a mobile phone.

 The IIT team, in collaboration with the Research and Development of System Operation, installed the gadget on Lal Quila Express that runs between Sealdah and Delhi when the train pulled into Allahabad station at 5 pm.

 As the train headed towards Kanpur, its image flashed on a plasma screen. The scientists and students who had gathered there cheered and curious passengers flooded them with questions. 

 Once the GPS is installed in the engine, it starts communicating with the satellite imaging system and gives information on its location. The data and images are conveyed to the mother computer at the monitoring office at the railway station. The computer stores the images and relays them to the plasma screens installed at various points of the station, Vyas said.

 The GPS will be set up at five stations between Allahabad and Kanpur for more elaborate field-testing. It will later be extended to 15 other stations close to Delhi. The next round of field-testing will take place in Chennai, may be sometime next month, the scientists said.

 According to Vyas, the system took shape because of the innovative thinking of Prof B.N. Shukla of the department of computer science at IIT Kanpur.

 The system has the potential to develop further. In the next phase, we are going to make it much more sophisticated so that the movement of more trains can be recorded. And we hope to contribute to the research that may reduce the number of train accidents, Shukla said.

 Sunil Jha and Ashish Agarwal, students of mechanical engineering and computer science who were part of the research team, claimed the device is more sophisticated that the train-tracking system used in European countries.

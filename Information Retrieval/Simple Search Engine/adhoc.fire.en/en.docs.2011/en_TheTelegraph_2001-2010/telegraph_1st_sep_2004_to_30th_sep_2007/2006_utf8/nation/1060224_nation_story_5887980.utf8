 Visa protest

 Paris, Feb. 23 (Reuters): A leading world science body today denounced tougher US visa policies after its Indian-born president said he failed to get permission to enter the country on the charge that he was hiding information that could be used for chemical weapons.

 Goverdhan Mehta, 62, an internationally recognised organic chemist, said he was denied the visa as he could not recall details of research he did 40 years ago.

 The protest from the International Council for Science Unions, Paris, has come a week before President George W. Bush is due to visit India.

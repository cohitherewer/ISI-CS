 Nalco protesters land at Sonia door

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 1: Opponents of the proposed divestment from Nalco, the Orissa-based aluminium company, are lobbying at the highest level of the government and the Congress party against the move.

 Unconfirmed reports today suggested that a group of union leaders met Sonia Gandhi.

 Tom Vaddakan, the Congress secretary in charge of the media cell, said: I have information some national union leaders sought an appointment and did meet her. But I have no details about which union they represented and whether they were affiliated to Nalco.

 An agency report from Bhubaneswar said the Nalco Coordination Committee, an umbrella body of employees, has written to the Congress chief to stop the 10 per cent divestment. 

 Nalco is a profit-making public sector unit.... Kindly prevail upon the decision of the cabinet committee and save Nalco from the attempt to privatise it gradually, B.C. Ray, convener of the committee, says in the letter.

 Travelling in Orissa, minister of state for commerce Jairam Ramesh dropped a hint that the government was reviewing the decision.

 He said the Rs 1,400 crore the government wanted to raise through the divestment for social sector spending could be taken from the companys reserve fund. It has reserves of Rs 4,500 crore and no debt.

 Or Nalco could be asked to raise its dividend payoff to the government, Ramesh said.

 The intention was not privatisation.... In Nalcos case we have to be sensitive. We have to allay the fears that divestment will lead to privatisation, he added.

 Pressure has been building up on Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, already frazzled over rising food prices, from the party to overturn the Nalco decision.

 Well-placed Congress sources said at the working committee meeting last Thursday, V. Narayanaswamy, the AICC general secretary in charge of Orissa, asked Singh and finance minister P. Chidambaram to explain why the decision was taken in such haste.

 Narayanaswamy, the sources said, raised the issue after a go-ahead from Sonia. It now appears the Congress chief is unhappy with the move and more so after protests in Orissa and outside.

 The sources, however, said the issue gathered momentum after Narayanaswamy, Orissa Congress president Jayadev Jena and some state leaders met the Prime Minister on June 27.

 They impressed on him two points. One, panchayat polls were ahead and the ruling Biju Janata Dal had made Nalco a major plank. They also referred to the fact that Sonia herself had spoken out against the NDA governments proposal for a strategic sale of the public sector unit and the BJD had mentioned this in its campaign.

 It seems the leaders urged Singh to rescind the cabinet decision. But the Prime Minister apparently stood his ground, saying divestment was the only way the government could mobilise resources to fund its social sector programmes and cited the example of Kalahandi.

 After Singhs rebuff, the delegation called on Sonia on the morning of June 29. It is believed she sounded more positive.

 Simi activist in blasts net

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Aug. 12: Ehtashan Siddiqui was today arrested for alleged involvement in the July train blasts in what is being seen as a step forward in unravelling the conspiracy.

 The Maharashtra anti-terrorist squad is officially playing down the arrest of the 36-year-old Students Islamic Movement of India activist, but privately officials have hinted otherwise.

 He is connected with the July 11 blasts. We cannot give out any more details at this stage, ATS chief K.P. Raghuvanshi said.

 Siddiqui was earlier arrested for links with the banned Simi and charged under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act.

 ATS sources said he was again arrested today. He has been remanded in police custody till August 14.

 We have firm proof that he was also involved in the train blasts conspiracy and is directly linked to the conspirators, an ATS source said.

 Although quite a few have been picked up in connection with the blasts, there have been no concrete results yet. The hunt for the masterminds is continuing amid rising scepticism.

 One person arrested from Nagpada, Tanvir, is being linked to the Matunga blasts and Kamal Ansari, arrested from Bihar, with the Jogeshwari blast.

 The biggest catch so far is Faizal Sheikh, believed to be a recruiting agent for the Lashkar-e-Toiba in Mumbai.

 ATS sources said Faizal and his absconding accomplice Rahil were tasked with recruiting youths from Maharashtra and sending them for training to Pakistan so they could become Lashkar sleeper cell operatives.

 Though we are yet to get the real masterminds of the July 11 blasts, those we have arrested have links with terror groups. We are investigating their role in the blasts. The media should have some patience instead of jumping to conclusions so fast, Raghuvanshi said.

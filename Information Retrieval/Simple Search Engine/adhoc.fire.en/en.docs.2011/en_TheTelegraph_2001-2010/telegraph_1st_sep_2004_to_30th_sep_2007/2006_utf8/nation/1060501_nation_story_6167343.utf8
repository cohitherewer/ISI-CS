 Indo-Pak border talks on Tuesday

 Islamabad (PTI): India and Pakistan will hold talks about opening four points along the Line of Control to help divided families to meet. A truck service on the Muzaffarabad-Srinagar route and a new bus between Poonch and Rawalkot in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir will also be discussed.

 Pakistani officials, led by Syed Ibne Abbas, director-general (South Asia division) with the foreign ministry, will leave for New Delhi to attend the two-day talks that start on Tuesday, officials here said.

 The proposals were agreed in principle at earlier talks and the modalities are expected to be finalised this time.

 The two sides will discuss a list of items to be imported and exported. The trade between the two Kashmirs will be strictly confined to local products.

 Dubai workers back at work

Dubai (PTI): Most of the Indian and other workers of a contracting 

firm who went on a strike earlier this week to protest ill treatment 

by their employer have returned to work.

 Workers and safety officers at the site in Dubai Marina said most of the 2,000 labourers returned to work on Saturday after the protest, during which they allegedly smashed company property, triggering a four-hour standoff with police, Gulf News reported on Sunday. However, no agreement had been reached with the workers, company officials said. The men worked with the Al Ahmadiah contracting and trading firm.

 A meeting scheduled on Saturday between labour ministry officials, the permanent committee on labour affairs in Dubai, Al Ahmadiah and the Indian consulate was postponed but no reason was given, sources said.

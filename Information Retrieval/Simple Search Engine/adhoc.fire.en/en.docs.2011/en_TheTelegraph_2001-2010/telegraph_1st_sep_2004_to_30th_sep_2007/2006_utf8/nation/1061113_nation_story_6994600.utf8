 Sympathy does not melt apex court

 New Delhi, Nov. 12 (PTI): The Supreme Court has ruled that sympathy cannot be a ground for reinstating casual workers whose appointments are temporary in nature.

 The verdict came on an appeal by the State Bank of India, which had challenged an Allahabad High Court order directing reinstatement with full back wages of a messenger whose temporary employment was terminated after 88 days.

 The apex court bench of Justices S.B. Sinha and Markandey Katju said: The high court committed a serious error in passing an order only on the basis of sympathy, although it was held that the workman was not entitled to any relief.

 Reinstatement in service can be directed, provided the termination is illegal, the bench observed. As there was no evidence to suggest that the termination of service in this case was unlawful, the question of directing an award reinstating him did not and could not arise.

 Even in cases where service of the employee is terminated in violation of provisions of the industrial disputes act, he would not be entitled to a permanent status, the bench said.

 The court added: It was not a case where the worker was employed for a number of years with artificial breaks.

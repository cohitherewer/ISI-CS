 8 die in twin Maoist raids

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Raipur, March 6: Red fury continued to rage in Chhattisgarhs Bastar region, where Maoists killed eight persons and left several injured in twin raids.

 The strikes, both of which took place in the violence-hit Dantewada district, saw the rebels raid a village and blow up a bus near Awapalli on the Andhra Pradesh border, about 550 km south of the capital. They also took some villagers hostage in the first incident.

 Police said hundreds of armed Maoists raided Basaguda village, about 70 km from Bijapur, past midnight and assembled over 50 villagers after calling them out of their homes.

 The rebels then held a meeting and asked the villagers not to get involved in Salwa Judum, an anti-Maoist mission backed by the government. Suddenly, they opened indiscriminate fire on the crowd, killing six on the spot. The police feared that the toll could rise.

 Sources said over 20 villagers were injured, of whom 14 were in critical condition. An Indian Air Force helicopter airlifted the injured to Apollo Hospital in Bacheli, also in Dantewada.

 Hours later, the rebels struck again, this time targeting a 25-seater bus plying on the Jagdalpur-Basaguda route. The attack took place around 11 am today near Timarpur, 7 km from the scene of the first raid.

 The bus was reportedly full when the rebels blew it up, killing two persons. The 10 passengers who received injuries were also taken to the Bacheli hospital, sources said.

 The casualty list could have been longer if the rebels had detonated the landmine a second later, they added.

 Chief minister Raman Singh told reporters that the government would give arms and training to the village youths as the Maoists have started attacking civilians. He reiterated that there was no question of stopping Salwa Judum. 

 Last Tuesday, the Naxalites had blown up a truck in the Konta region, killing 32 villagers returning from a Salwa Judum meeting. They struck again yesterday by targeting a railway station and a train engine in Dantewada.

 Budget meet

 New Delhi, Feb. 11: Finance minister P. Chidambaram will meet senior Congress leaders and functionaries at the party headquarters on February 14 for pre-budget consultations, reports our special correspondent.

 Congress president Sonia Gandhi will be present in this interaction with members of the Congress Working Committee, the general secretaries and secretaries and the chiefs of the frontal organisations.

 Congress sources said the wish list was largely expected to incorporate the suggestions and proposals contai- ned in the economic resolution that was adopted by the AICC plenary last month in Hyderabad.

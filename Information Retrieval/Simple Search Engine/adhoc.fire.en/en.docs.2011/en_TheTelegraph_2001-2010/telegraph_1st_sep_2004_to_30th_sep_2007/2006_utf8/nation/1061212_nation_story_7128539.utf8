 Convicted MP law challenged

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chandigarh, Dec. 11: Punjab and Haryana High Court today sent notices to the Union law ministry and the Election Commission on a public interest litigation challenging a law that allows a convicted legislator to remain in the elected post for three months.

 The challenged law Section 8 (4) of the Representation of the People Act deals with the disqualification of legislators. It states that an MP can be disqualified only after three months from the date of conviction. If within that period an appeal or application for revision is admitted, the person can be a representative until the plea is disposed of or the term of the House is over.

 The notices were sent on a petition filed an advocate, H.C. Arora. The law ministry and the poll panel have been asked to reply by February 20.

 The advocate said he approached the court following the conviction of Navjot Singh Sidhu and Shibu Soren. Sidhu has resigned as Amritsar MP but Soren has quit from only the cabinet.

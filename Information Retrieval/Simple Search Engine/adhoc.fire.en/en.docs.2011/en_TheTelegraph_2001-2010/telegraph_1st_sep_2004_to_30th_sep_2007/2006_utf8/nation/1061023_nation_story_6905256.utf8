 Cong sharpens ticket knives

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN 

 New Delhi, Oct. 22: The Congress is likely to deny tickets to the majority at least 75 per cent of its sitting MLAs in Punjab and Uttaranchal in next years Assembly elections, a senior office-bearer has said.

 According to him, if the Congress is serious about retaining power in these states or at least putting up a good fight, it will have to follow the Digvijay Singh formula of 1998. 

 In the Assembly elections that year, the former Madhya Pradesh chief minister had concluded that if he had to secure a second term in office, the only way to battle anti-incumbency was by dropping most of the sitting MLAs. He took the gamble and it paid off.

 Sources conceded that the risk inherent in emulating Digvijay is that it would fuel factionalism.

 But its a question of drawing up a proper balance sheet. If the legislator in question is very powerful and has a loyal following, theres no question of not giving him a ticket as he, anyway, has a good chance of keeping his seat. But if hes thoroughly discredited, why give him a second chance? His damage potential will be small, so its more expedient to put up a new face, a source explained.

 The exercise of identifying candidates will begin in a couple of weeks. 

 The Punjab and Uttaranchal chief ministers have been told to work in tandem with the state Congress presidents and not fritter away their energy in lobbying for their nominees. 

 The feedback for the Congress in both the states, slated to go to the polls in February, is that the anti-incumbency sentiment is strong. 

 But in Uttaranchal, sources claimed, there is no alternative to chief minister N.D. Tiwari in personality ranking. 

 Despite his age and seniority, he remains the only acceptable leader, cutting across the regions there. The BJP has not thrown up a challenge, the sources said.

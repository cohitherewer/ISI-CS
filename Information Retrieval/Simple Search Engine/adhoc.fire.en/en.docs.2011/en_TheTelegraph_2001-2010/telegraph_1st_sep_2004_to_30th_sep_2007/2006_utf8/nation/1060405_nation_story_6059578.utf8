 Praise amp; offer surprise

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 4: In a move that may surprise the Congress, L.K. Advani today heaped praise on Sonia Gandhi and claimed that the BJP can make common cause with her party if it shuns minority appeasement.

 Advani quoted the Congress chiefs signed editorial in the party organ where she reportedly attacked the Left for communalising foreign policy. I completely agree with her, Advani said.

 I think she did the right thing by criticising attempts to communalise foreign policy. But, I ask her, is it right to communalise domestic politics?

 He then counted instances of the UPAs minority appeasement: reservation for Muslims in Andhra Pradesh; reservation in Aligarh Muslim University; amendment in the foreigners act to make it difficult to deport illegal Bangladeshi immigrants; and setting up the Rajinder Sachar committee to assess the extent of Muslim representation in government institutions.

 If the Congress shuns such dishonest means of attracting minority vote, we can lay a firm foundation for the two principal political parties in Indias bipolar polity ? the BJP and the Congress ? to make common cause in a very wide area of politics and governance, Advani said.

 Pointing out that economist Lord Meghnad Desai had touched on the possibility of such an alliance in various lectures, Advani said there was a credible expectation about it.

 We share a common perspective on several issues ? foreign policy, economic issues etc. The only bone of contention is their unabashed minority appeasement purely for the purpose of attracting minority votes.

 Besides making unusual remarks on the Congress, Advani summed up the purpose and aims of the BJPs twin yatras, slammed the UPA for failing on all fronts and totally overshadowed party president Rajnath Singh.

 The two leaders were addressing a joint press conference to explain the purpose and aims of the yatras. Rajnath, however, found it difficult to make himself heard over Advanis far superior articulation of the partys agenda.

 Despite Advanis creditable performance, the schisms in the BJP were difficult to hide with news of A.B. Vajpayees opposition to the yatras making headlines this morning.

 Advani, however, denied he had been told to call off the yatra. I am astounded by such reports. Vajpayeeji has been very enthusiastic right from the beginning. In fact, I had met him some time back and he was very supportive.

 The party also launched a damage-control exercise to dilute the impact of Vajpayees widely believed disapproval. Its media cell circulated a message around 4.30 pm that Vajpayee would be flagging off the two yatras tomorrow morning.

 Shri Vajpayeeji would bless the Bharat Suraksha Yatra and see off Shri Advaniji and Shri Rajnathji tomorrow morning, read the BJP message.

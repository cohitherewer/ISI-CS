 Natwar 

 New Delhi, Feb. 18: Top Enforcement Directorate officials interrogated former external affairs minister Natwar Singh for more than two hours in the Iraqi oil-for-food scam for the second day today. He was questioned for two-and-a-half hours yesterday.

 Sources said the questions were preliminary and revolved around the purpose of Natwars visit to Iraq in 2001, who he met there, why he took son Jagat along and why Jagats friend Andaleeb Sehgal joined them.

 Natwar was named a non-contractual beneficiary in the report of the UN-appointed Volcker committee that went into the scam. 

 The interrogators sought clarifications from him on the Volcker report and some other documents, including bank papers and receipts that the directorate has obtained from Jordan and Iraq.

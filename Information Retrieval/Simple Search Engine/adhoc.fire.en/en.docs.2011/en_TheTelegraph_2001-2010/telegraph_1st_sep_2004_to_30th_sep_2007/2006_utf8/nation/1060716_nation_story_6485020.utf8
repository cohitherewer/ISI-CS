 Broadcast bill

 New Delhi, July 15: Information and broadcasting minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi today ruled out any dilution in the provisions of the proposed broadcast bill.

 But he said the bill would be media-friendly and more progressive than anywhere else in the world.

 Among the clauses of the draft bill is one that is meant to curb media monopoly. It proposes a cap on cross-media holdings. For example, TV channels would not be allowed to hold more than 20 per cent of a radio network. The provision allows similar restrictions in future on the print media.

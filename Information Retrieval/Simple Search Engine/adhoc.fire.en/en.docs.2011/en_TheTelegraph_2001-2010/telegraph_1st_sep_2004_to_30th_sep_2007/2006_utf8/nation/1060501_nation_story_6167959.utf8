 Rebel fear

 Dantewada, April 30: The sleepy village in Dantewada, 550 km south of the Chhattisgarh capital, is silent because there is nobody in its huts. 

 After losing 15 fellow-villagers to Maoists for supporting the governments Salwa Judum campaign, its residents do not want to stay in Manikonta for fear of more rebel raids. 

 The return of 35 villagers after their abduction on Tuesday did little to lift the spirits; their recollections have only added to the fears of the villagers.

 The villagers said their captors selected 13 hostages, tied their hands from behind and blindfolded them. Then, the rebels stabbed them repeatedly before slitting their throats. The other villagers could only watch in horror.

 The Maoists then allowed 35 villagers, all of whom had been staying in the Errabore relief camp, to go. 

 The freed tribals told police that the Maoists did not give them food or even water. 

 The bodies were buried near Errabore today as the victims relatives refused to take them back to their village.

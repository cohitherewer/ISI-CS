 Jilted lover behind PM killer mail

 - Youth disturbed, but no terror links

 JOHN MARY

 Thiruvananthapuram, Oct. 29: A jilted lover sent threatening emails against the Pri-me Minister and President to teach the girl a lesson by falsely attributing the messages to her, Kerala police said today.

 Director-general of police Ramon Srivastava said Akbar Raj, 26, a hardware instructor at a private firm in Kochi, was picked up last night from the central district of Alappuzha.

 Apparently, he had no extremist links but showed signs of being mentally disturbed, the police said.

 Home minister Kodiyeri Balakrishnan patted the police for busting the case in 48 hours of the emails reaching 40 police officers. The mails came a few days ahead of the Prime Ministers scheduled visit to the state.

 Akbar, who sent the mails between 3.15 pm and 3.30 pm on October 26 from a cyber caf in Kochi, was today taken to the outlet for the staff to identify him. The police planned to conduct an identification parade after producing him before a magistrate.

 The police had initially planned to book the youth under charges of sedition and other grave offences.

 What led to his arrest were a pin code, a date of birth and the name of a private college at Trikkakara, on the suburbs of Kochi, found at the bottom of the email message. All three pieces of information were related to the girl who had spurned him.

 The pin code took the police to Mevallore in Kottayam district and it was found that only one girl from the locality had studied in the college mentioned in the mail in the last five years.

 The pieces of the jigsaw fell in place when the police traced the girl and found she had complained against the youth for stalking her.

 Akbar, who met her in a chat room, had persuaded her to lend him Rs 50,000 when his share business crashed. She soon realised that he was in deep financial crisis and drifted away from him.

 Akbars parents Syed Alavi and Sainaba, who repaid the amount, said their son was being counselled at a private hospital. He was madly in love with the girl (from the same community) and was furious with her for deserting him, they said.

 The police said Akbar had confessed to posting mischievous mails in the past, too.

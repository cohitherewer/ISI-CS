 Damper on Lefts Bengal clamour

 New Delhi, April 3: Left Front leaders today met chief election commissioner B.B. Tandon to air their grievances over some of the poll panels initiatives for the Bengal polls, but the panel appears to have rejected the complaints.

 We met the commissioner and raised some of the issues which could have implications beyond the current Assembly elections, CPM general secretary Prakash Karat told a news conference.

 The Left delegation sub-mitted a memorandum to Tandon. The rebuff is believed to have come hours later.

 The commission has clarified the issues to the CPM leaders, deputy election commissioner R. Balakrishnan said.

 On the Lefts claim that two poll panel observers had misbehaved in Bengal, Balakrishnan said: We have heard them. We will have to talk to the observers, too.

 The Left is particularly unhappy about the extension of jurisdiction of the West Bengal Prevention of Defacement of Property Act, 1976, beyond Calcutta. This act has now been applied to the whole of West Bengal. A similar approach, however, has not been taken in case of Tamil Nadu, Karat said.

 The CPM is walking a tightrope on its conflicts with the commission. Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, who has promised full cooperation to the poll panel, has left it to the central leadership to make the larger political point. 

 The CPM believes the spate of rules and regulations imposed by the commission is undercutting the democratic spirit of elections. 

 You will agree that peoples participation in the election process is the essential core of our democratic system. Political parties play a crucial role in ensuring peoples participation, the Left memorandum said.

 The Left has the cheapest mode of campaign in the country. But the commissions order prevents someone from using flags and banners at his own house. We do not have the money to put out advertisements in newspapers or on the television, said Karat. What the commission is doing is encouraging expensive poll campaigns.

 The leaders welcomed the panels effort to introduce flawless electoral rolls. But the commission has received a number of motivated complaints, which have led to the deletion of the names of two of our MPs and a former three-time MP, Karat said.

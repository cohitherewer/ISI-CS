 Degrees to determine pay scale, says SC

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 24: The Supreme Court has held that employees doing similar work could be placed on different pay scales on the basis of educational qualification.

 A bench headed by Justice S.B. Sinha said the ruling would apply even if no qualification was prescribed at the time of recruitment.

 Equal pay would depend upon not only the nature or the volume of work, but also on the qualitative difference as regards reliability and responsibility?. Though the functions may be the same, the responsibilities do make a real and substantial difference, the court said.

 Some employees of the Uttar Pradesh State Sugar Corporation Limited had challenged the decision of the public sector enterprise to classify laboratory in-charges according to their educational qualifications.

 The corporation had said the pay scale of Rs 900-Rs 1,770 would be available only to those laboratory in-charges who possess a BSc degree with a post-graduate diploma in sugar technology. The others would be on the Rs 770-Rs 1,600 pay scale.

 The employees moved Uttaranchal High Court, saying when they joined the service, no qualification was prescribed, and as the laboratory in-charges did the same kind of work, their educational qualification was immaterial. 

 With the court ruling in favour of the employees, the corporation moved the Supreme Court against the order.

 The apex bench today admitted the appeal and said the high court ruling cannot be sustained.

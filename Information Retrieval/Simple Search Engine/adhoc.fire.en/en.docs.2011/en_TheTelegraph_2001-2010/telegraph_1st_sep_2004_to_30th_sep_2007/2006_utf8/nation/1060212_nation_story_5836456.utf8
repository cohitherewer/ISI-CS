 BISWARUP GOOPTU

 Calcutta, Feb. 11: IIM Calcutta has signed a memorandum of understanding for academic collaboration with Cardiff University of the UK. 

 The pact will facilitate the exchange of faculty members as well as postgraduate students and academic information and material.

 The two institutes will also organise joint management training programmes, research projects and conferences.

 Shekhar Chowdhury, the director of IIM Calcutta, said: This partnership will help us provide students with world-class international inputs, which will be of immense benefits to both parties, especially the students who are the future torchbearers of business.

 The joint initiative is expected to commence within weeks. IIM Calcutta is the first business school with which the UK university has tied up in Asia. 

 Speaking after signing the memorandum of understanding today, Brian Smith, the international ambassador and former vice-chancellor of Cardiff University, said: The reputation of IIM Calcutta is enormous in the UK, and Cardiff is privileged to have this association with them.

 The two institutes will set up a joint research project on the manufacturing industry that, they feel, has been losing out to the services and financial sectors is recent times. 

 Robert McNabb, the dean of Cardiff Business School, said: The popularity of manufacturing has gone down. We have to get this sector back on its feet. Business schools have to play a major role in initiating and developing leaders in this sector.

 Emphasis on research projects will dominate the collaborative efforts. 

 Cardiff is a research-oriented institution, and we believe that there is an extremely fertile ground for path-breaking research opportunities with IIM Calcutta, said McNabb.

 Punjab awakes to 40000 suicides

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Chandigarh, April 23: Thousands of deaths and nearly a decade later, the Punjab government has woken up to farmer suicides in the state.

 Reeling under harassment from moneylenders and commission agents, 40,000 farmers have taken their lives from 1997 to 2005, according to a suicide census.

 Two farmer deaths in three days ? the latest in the string of suicides ? had the state government pressing the panic button at last.

 We have asked the Prime Minister to evolve a strategy to stop farmers from killing themselves, said a senior officer in the chief ministers secretariat, which is working on a mechanism to free farmers from the clutches of moneylenders.

 Among the strategies being considered is the 1936 formula floated by farmers leader Sir Chottu Ram. It envisages waiver of loans if farmers have paid as much interest as the principal amount. The formula, which became an act, is not applied any more.

 Moneylenders charge farmers 36 per cent interest per annum. In many cases, the interest rate is as high as 40-60 per cent.

 We want to revive some of the clauses of the act. It also provides for the setting up of debt conciliation boards in each district to resolve disputes between borrowers and lenders. We are also toying with the idea of making registration of moneylenders mandatory to check interest rates, the officer said.

 Chief minister Amarinder Singh had met Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Friday and proposed that the Centre take over or at least share the financial burden of waiving loans to farmers.

 Shocking figures on farmers suicides in the state continue to trickle in. The suicide census conducted by Movement Against State Repression, a voluntary organisation, found that over 1,300 farmers spread over 91 villages in just two blocks of Andana in Sangrur have killed themselves. The deaths occurred between 1988 and 2005.

 In most cases, farmers who had to dispose of their lands to repay debts committed suicides to escape social stigma, as they had no option but to work as labourers in others fields, said Inderjit Jaijee, who heads the organisation.

 The study refutes a status report the state government had submitted to the Centre last year, where it had mentioned that 2,116 villagers committed suicide between 1988 and 2004. According to the NGO, it was a gross under-reporting of the problem.

 The Punjabi farmer leads the country in rural indebtedness. The total annual rural debt of the state ? it was Rs 24,000 crore in 2003-04 ? is more than its gross annual earnings from agriculture.

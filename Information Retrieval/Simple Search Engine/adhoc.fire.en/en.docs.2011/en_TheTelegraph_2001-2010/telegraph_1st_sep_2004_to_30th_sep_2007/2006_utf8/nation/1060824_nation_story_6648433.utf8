 New Delhi, Aug. 23: Prodded by a message from director P. Venugopal, AIIMS doctors protesting against the 27 per cent quota for OBCs today confirmed they would not strike work till the bill is placed in Parliament.

 Contrary to rumours, we are not calling any strike at the moment. But we will be forced to, as a last option, if the government introduces the bill, said Vinod Patro, the president of the AIIMS resident doctors association.

 The controversial director, who had been sacked by the health ministry for his open support to the anti-quota doctors in May but was reinstated by a court order, is believed to have conveyed to the doctors that they should keep the strike option on hold.

 We will not be supported by the administration if we go on strike right now, said a senior resident doctor.

 The protesters have also been told that, unlike the last round, they will not be allowed to use the AIIMS campus. It is not possible to meet at Jantar Mantar everyday. No other college is willing to entertain us either, Kaushik Mondol, from IIT Delhi, said.

 Two other reasons the doctors could be temporarily holding back are the Supreme Courts May 31 verdict asking them not to suspend medical services and the perception that ordinary people would not be pleased with a second round of strikes.

 Doctors at AIIMS and four other medical colleges and hospitals will, however, go on mass casual leave tomorrow as scheduled. But resident doctors said they will not let emergency or OPD services be affected.

 Although the tussle between Venugopal and health minister Anbumani Ramadoss for control of AIIMS is not yet over, a faculty member close to the director said he wanted to go it easy at the moment.

 Venugopal does not want to aggravate matters with the minister at the moment, the faculty member said.

 Although the quota protesters appear to have been reined in for now, they are exploring other ways of making their case heard. We are trying to prepare alternative plans in case we cannot strike, said Amit Kumar of the Youth for Equality.

 Calcutta roadblock

 The Youth for Equality set up a roadblock in front of Calcutta National Medical College and Hospital this evening. 

 A meeting will be held at the Calcutta Medical College and Hospital tomorrow. We will then bring out a protest rally and submit a deputation to the chief minister, a member said. A roadblock will be put up tomorrow, too, at a very crucial spot.

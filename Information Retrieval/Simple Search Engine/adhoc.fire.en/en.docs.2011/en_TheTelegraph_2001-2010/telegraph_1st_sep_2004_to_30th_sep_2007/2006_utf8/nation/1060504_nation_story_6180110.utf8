 Hurriyat iffy on Srinagar meeting

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, May 3: The talks between the Prime Minister and the moderate Hurriyat faction today failed to achieve any progress, with the Kashmiri grouping still uncertain about attending the Srinagar round-table on May 25.

 After more than two hours of discussion, the Prime Ministers Office spokesperson mouthed the usual line that the talks were fruitful. The PM said it was a meeting of minds that augers well for Jammu and Kashmir, for the country and the entire region, Sanjaya Baru said.

 Hurriyat chairman Mirwaiz Omar Farooq side-stepped questions on whether his group would attend the Prime Ministers second round-table conference in Srinagar, saying many issues needed to be considered before a decision could be taken.

 Describing the meeting as cordial, the Mirwaiz said: We have decided to evolve a mechanism for holding dialogues in the future as there are many issues which need to be discussed. We today discussed several things that include? human rights, (the) black laws prevalent in Kashmir and freeing political prisoners.

 He said the next time the Hurriyat would come with a mechanism that could pave the way for decisions.

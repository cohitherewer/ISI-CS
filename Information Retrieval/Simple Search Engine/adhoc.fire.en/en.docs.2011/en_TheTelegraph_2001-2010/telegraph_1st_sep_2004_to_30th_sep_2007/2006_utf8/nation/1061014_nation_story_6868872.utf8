 Bachchan caught in land row

 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY

 Barabanki (Uttar Pradesh), Oct. 13: Amitabh Bachchan apparently never came to Daulatpur. Living in this cluster of mud-huts along a rivulet would not have been an option either, but a plot the superstar fancied here is turning into a legal battleground.

 Last week, Allahabad High Court asked the state government to explain how the 2.5 bighas were handed to him after farmers upset at being ignored in the allotment filed a petition accusing local authorities of allegedly signing away the Gram Samaj property.

 Satya Narayan Shukla, one of the petitioners claiming to be a farmer from the district, said the allotment flouted laws and rules of PARTI (village welfare) land belonging to Gram Sabha of Panchayat. He argued that the interest of the deserving landless farmers living below poverty line have been ignored.

 Villagers said the Bachchans have never visited Daulatpur, 22 km from the district headquarters and home mostly to Dalits. But the land at the centre of the row is on the list of immovable properties that Jaya Bachchan has provided in the affidavit before her June 1 re-election to the Rajya Sabha.

 The document said the land at village Daulatpur, tehsil Fatehpur, district Barabanki, Uttar Pradesh is owned by her husband. 

 The value mentioned is Rs 5 lakh.

 Mahfooz Alam, the farmers lawyer, challenged the April 26 order of Barabanki collector R.S. Sahu in which Bachchan is registered as transferable bhumidhar (a land owned by one after it is transferred from someone else). 

 Alam alleged that the status of the plot as PARTI Land of Gram Samaj was altered. This kind of land can only be allotted to landless farmers of the same village, he argued.

 The farmers have said in their petition that Sahus predecessor and previous collector, Ashis Goel, ordered corrections in land records on March 24 after he found irregularities in mutation. A land record officer was suspended for tampering with papers. Alam said the land was certified afresh as PARTI on April 16.

 Bachchans office offered no reactions, but Jayas New Delhi office said they were in touch with the government in sorting out the legal issues.

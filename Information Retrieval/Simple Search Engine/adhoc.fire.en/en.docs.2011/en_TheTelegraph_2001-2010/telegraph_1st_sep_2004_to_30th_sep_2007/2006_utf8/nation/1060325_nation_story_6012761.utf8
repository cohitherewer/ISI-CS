 New Delhi, March 24: Somnath Chatterjee appears displeased that Rashtrapati Bhavan forwarded a flawed complaint to the Election Commission on an office of profit he allegedly holds.

 I am not aware whether, if at all, any formal petition was submitted by the complainant before the respected Rashtrapatiji before the complaint was sent to the Election Commission, he said in a statement today.

 The Lok Sabha Speakers name was on a list of 10 CPM MPs against whose offices of profit Trinamul Congress leader Mamata Banerjee had complained to the President.

 In her complaint, Mamata had claimed Chatterjee was president of the Asiatic Society, Calcutta, and the chairperson of the Sriniketan-Santiniketan Development Authority (SSDA).

 Chatterjee is, however, only a member of the Asiatic Society.

 I have never been nor am I the president of Asiatic Society, Calcutta, an institute of national importance. Such a casual reference to the society only shows colossal ignorance on the part of the complainant. Also, it shows how motivated the complaint is, he said.

 The Speaker said Rashtrapati Bhavan should have verified the complaint before forwarding it to the Election Commission.

 The commission today sought more documents on the MPs Mamata had named, saying she had not submitted enough documents to substantiate her allegations.

 I shall not refuse to discharge any obligation as a member of Parliament, for which my voters have sent me, on the basis of baseless allegations, insinuations and reckless tantrums of some disgruntled persons, Chatterjee said.

 As for being SSDA chairman, he said he had been in that chair since 1989. This is the first time that somebody has irresponsibly alleged that I am holding an office of profit even though all through this period I have been a member of Parliament, he said.

 The CPM politburo rooted for Chatterjee. The demand for his resignation for SSDA is baseless since it cannot be termed as an office of profit, it said.

 The politburo also rose to Congress chief Sonia Gandhis defence. The post of NAC (National Advisory Council) cannot be termed as an office of profit, it said.

 But the CPM is not happy with the way the Congress has handled the offices of profit controversy. Party leaders said the Congress should have started the process of bringing in legislation after Jaya Bachchans disqualification.

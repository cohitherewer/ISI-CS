 Landmark seal on N-deal

 Sonia: Clearing air

 New Delhi, March 27: Congress president Sonia Gandhi today put an end to speculation about her partys unease with the Indo-US nuclear pact by describing it as a landmark agreement.

 In her customary letter in the latest issue of party mouthpiece Congress Sandesh, Sonia criticised some parties for trying to communalise Indias foreign policy for short-term electoral gains. This is above all an insult to our minorities and something that the Congress will never do, she said.

 Sonia stressed that her party has never considered religious minorities any less nationalist than the majority community. 

 All communities had fought for Indias Independence, the Congress chief said. And like earlier, our minorities will continue to support the Congresss desire to create an open and plural society where our democracy gives everyone the right to articulate their difference of opinion. 

 Sonia clarified that Indias independent foreign policy is in place. Those who accuse the Manmohan Singh government of discarding Indias independent policy need to look carefully at the enormous gains our new and equal relationship with America will bring (to) our scientific, technical, agricultural and trade sectors, she said.

 Among the other positive spin-offs Sonia listed were:

 Better integration with the growing sectors of the world economy so that India can meet the need to create jobs and infrastructure.

 Meeting future energy needs and gaining access to high-end technology, which has been denied for 20 years.

 Sonia praised the Prime Minister and his team for creating a positive atmosphere to work with George W. Bush and simultaneously ensuring that India did not barter away its national interest while signing the nuclear deal. 

 She also had a word of praise for atomic energy scientists who, she said, have persevered to maintain Indias nuclear programme despite facing great odds. 

 As Sonia sang paeans to the deal, she criticised the Left obliquely. The Congress has always stood at the forefront of the fight against communalism. Even the Left has aligned with the BJP in the past but the Congress has always maintained its principled distance. It is, therefore, ironic that those very parties that did not support Indias own indigenous nuclear programme are today the champions of a nuclear Iran. These principled flip-flops reveal the reality behind their vociferous anti-US cries, she said.

 Dalmiya aides get relief

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, March 22: Bombay High Court today granted interim protection to three associates of Jagmohan Dalmiya after they sought anticipatory bail in the criminal case alleging misappropriation of Rs 21.74 lakh of BCCI funds.

 Justice V.M. Kanade directed Mumbai police not to arrest former BCCI secretary S.K. Nair and former treasurers Kishore Rungta and Jyoti Bajpai till tomorrow.

 Dalmiya, a former BCCI president, was granted interim protection from arrest in the same case yesterday and the matter was posted for hearing tomorrow.

 Nair, Rungta and Bajpai have been named along with Dalmiya, his office assistant K.M. Choudhary and officials of the Bhowanipore branch of the Indian Overseas Bank (IOB) in the FIR filed by present BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah at a Mumbai police station on March 16. The FIR accuses them of siphoning off the amount from BCCI funds linked to the 1996 World Cup.

 The case was yesterday transferred to the economic offences wing, the specialised wing of the crime branch investigating financial frauds, which is yet to begin a formal probe.

 Chief public prosecutor Satish Borulkar said: We have received the case on March 21, and we were in court the same day. How will we start investigations unless we are given time to do so? 

 The 200-page petition filed by Dalmiya in court yesterday contains 17 exhibits, including the FIR filed by Shah.

 Shahs FIR says Dalmiya had opened an IOB account in Calcutta to handle Indian receipts of the World Cup jointly hosted by India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Crores of rupees were deposited in this account and it was operated single-handedly by Dalmiya, the authorised signatory, till it was closed on February 4, 2006.

 Heavy financial transactions were carried out, which were never placed before either the working committee or the general body of the BCCI, the FIR says. The FIR adds that Dalmiya closed the IOB account on February 4 despite being removed as authorised signatory on January 23, alleging that he had committed a fraud.

 Dalmiyas lawyers said yesterday that all except the 2005-2006 transactions were audited and approved by the BCCI.

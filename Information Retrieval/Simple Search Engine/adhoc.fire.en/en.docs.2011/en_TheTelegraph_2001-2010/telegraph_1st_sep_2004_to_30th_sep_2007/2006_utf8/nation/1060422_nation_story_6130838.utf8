 Singh nudges babus awake

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 21: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has urged civil servants to reorient and sensitise themselves to the exigencies and challenges of a market-driven order.

 Speaking at the Civil Services Day today, Singh said as the economy evolved and society and the polity changed, it was incumbent on the civil services to ensure that growth was equitable, inclusive and not unduly harsh.

 Markets will increasingly become the arbitrators of resource allocation in many cases. At the same time, it is necessary to realise that markets can at times lead to marginalisation of the poor and the vulnerable.

 When millions of people are living on the edge of subsistence, with little in the form of assets and skills to be active participants in the evolving market economy, market signals cannot have significance for them, he said.

 The Prime Minister, who was criticised both in the Congress and outside for his apparent obsession with growth figures and his ambivalence on pro-people issues, used the occasion to correct his image.

 While markets can facilitate higher growth, the government must ensure that growth is equitable, inclusive and not unduly harsh on those not equipped to manage change, he said.

 Singh called on the civil servants to grapple with the phenomenal expansion of knowledge and the publics right to seek information to induce more accountability.

 They will have to learn to seek the right information and utilise it for public good. Another aspect of the government that is going to change is in the area of accountability, he added and warned, thanks to the Right to Information Act, that the average citizen is likely to demand his due and is not going to be patient about it.

 Singh asked civil servants to change their mindset of viewing citizens as the outside beneficiaries of governmental action and see themselves as the administrators of public delivery systems.

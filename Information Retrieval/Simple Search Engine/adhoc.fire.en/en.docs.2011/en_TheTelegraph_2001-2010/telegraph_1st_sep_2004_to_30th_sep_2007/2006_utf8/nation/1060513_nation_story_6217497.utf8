 Part-time lady cop stabbed

 London, May 12 (Reuters): A part-time policewoman has been stabbed to death outside her home in northwest London. Police named her today as special police constable Nisha Patel-Nasri (in AFP picture), 29, who was off duty when she was killed late last night.

 Neighbours called the police after they heard her scream and a man wearing a hooded top was seen running away from the scene.

 The police said Patel-Nasri, a hairdresser, had been alone in the Wembley house she shared with her husband Fadi and had gone outside in her night clothes following a disturbance. A neighbour administered first aid but Patel-Nasri died later in hospital from stab wounds in her leg.

 The police said as one line of inquiry, they were looking into an attempted burglary at Patel-Nasris home on May 6 in which three men tried to get into the house through the front door. The men were challenged by her and fled.

 Detective superintendent Julian Worker said: What we believe has happened is that she had come out of her house in her nightdress and dealt with something in the street. Two cars belonging to her husbands limousine hire business were parked outside and may have had something to do with the murder, Worker said.

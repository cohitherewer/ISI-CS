The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Property tax cut for IT 

 OUR BUREAU 

 Calcutta, June 29: The Bengal government today announced a plan to slash property tax by half for infotech companies, handing the crucial industry a long overdue incentive.

 A bill would be tabled in the current Assembly session to legislate the cut, urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya said.

 Property tax in Calcutta is 52 per cent of the total rental one receives. For the IT sector, this should now come down to 26 per cent, which is still far higher than the national average of 5 to 15 per cent.

 This is a very positive sign and perhaps can be seen as a reversal of trends, with costs actually coming down instead of going up. The state needs to offer incentives like these, especially to the IT companies, said Sanjoy Sen, partner, PricewaterhouseCoopers Ltd.

 This should encourage an increasing number of companies to start offshoring to Bengal as well.

 Its a welcome move. It has been our long-standing demand, said Pradip Chopra of Credai, a real estate developers body. 

 Till recently, we couldnt have any IT parks in Calcutta because the tax was so high. This should now change, Chopra added.

 Industry has long been asking the state government to reduce the property tax rates, which are among the highest in the country.

 Siddharth Mukherjee, vice-president of Asia Pacific operations, Cognizant Technology Solutions, said that while any tax concession was good, this one would benefit the companies that were not located in software technology parks or special economic zones.

 To effect this cut, the West Bengal Municipal Act will have to be amended, officials said.

 Ravindra Chamaria, chairman, Infinity Infotech Park, said, Its a major relief for us and suddenly, the state has become more attractive for investment. But compared with other cities like Bangalore, Pune and Hyderabad, property tax in Bengal is still very high.

 Bikram Dasgupta, chairman and CEO, Globsyn Technologies, introduced a note of caution.

 The proposed cut in property tax will be far more reasonable now, but we have to see whether it is cosmetic or whether it will actually turn out to be quite a lot.

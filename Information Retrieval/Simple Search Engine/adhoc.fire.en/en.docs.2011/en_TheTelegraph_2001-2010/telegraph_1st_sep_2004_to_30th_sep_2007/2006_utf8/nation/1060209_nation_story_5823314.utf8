 Maoist victims kin cry foul

 NISHIT DHOLABHAI

 Chumukedima (Dimapur), Feb. 8: A volcano of emotions burst forth at a funeral service for the nine Naga India Reserve Battalion personnel who died in a landmine blast in Chattisgarh two days ago, sending chief minister Neiphiu Rio scurrying for cover.

 Mourners refused to allow the coffins to be taken for burial and shouted slogans demanding that all policemen on deputation to Maoist-infested Chattisgarh be withdrawn. 

 Paisa nalage (we do not want the money), we want them alive, withdraw the battalion immediately, cried about 500 cried women in unison as Rio, home minister Thenucho and Lok Sabha member Wangyuh Konyak looked on.

 Anticipating trouble, the chief ministers security retinue promptly whisked him away. Thenucho and Konyak followed suit, but the women ran after the convoy as it sped out of the Chumukedima Police Training Centre, where the service was organised.

 This time, we will show them the power of women. We will go to these ministers residences in Kohima, shouted one of the women.

 Thousands of people had gathered at the training centre for the arrival of the bodies, which were brought by the BSF on a special plane from Raipur. 

 What made it worse for the families of the victims was the information that some of them had been sanctioned leave to return home for a few days later this week.

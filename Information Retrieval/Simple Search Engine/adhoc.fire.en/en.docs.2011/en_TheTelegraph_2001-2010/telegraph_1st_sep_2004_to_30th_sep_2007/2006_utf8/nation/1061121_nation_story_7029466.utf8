 Convicted aide in Dawood deport cry

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Nov. 20: A special anti-terror court today convicted Ejaz Pathan, a former associate of key conspirator Dawood Ibrahim, and his aide Mohammed Dawood Khan for their complicity in the 1993 blasts case, taking the number of convictions to 79.

 Judge Pramod Kode found Pathan guilty of aiding and abetting the blast conspiracy and possessing three AK-56 rifles and nine magazines which were part of the arms cache offloaded on the Raigad coast.

 According to the Central Bureau of Investigation, Pathan had attended a conspiracy meeting called by Dawood Ibrahim and Tiger Memon in Dubai in 1993, which discussed the plot to trigger the blasts.

 Pathans men helped carry out the arms landing at Shekhadi on the Raigad coast in February 1993. 

 But the prosecution failed to prove that Pathan had sent his men to be trained in Pakistan, and he was acquitted of this charge.

 Upset at the verdict, Pathan demanded why Dawood Ibrahim and Memon had not been extradited so far. The court, however, did not put his statement on record.

 Pathan evaded Indian law for 10 years before the authorities in Dubai deported him to Mumbai in 2003. He was the last accused to be included in the main trial. 

 The court has separated the trials of Mustafa Dossa, deported from Dubai in 2003, and Abu Salem, extradited from Portugal last year, from the main trial.

 Pathans associate Dawood Khan, too, was convicted of possessing three AK-56 rifles and nine magazines. The court did not find the evidence adequate to nail him in the conspiracy charge.

 Both Pathan and Khan face anything between a five-year term or a life sentence.

 The court has now completed the verdict on 100 of the 123 facing trial. Twenty-one accused have been acquitted so far, including three members of the Memon family.

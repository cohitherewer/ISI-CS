 Sealing order before Pujas 

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 25: The Supreme Court today reserved its order on the constitutional validity of a government notification that allowed mixed land use in some areas of the capital.

 Residents had challenged the validity of the notification on the ground that it was aimed at circumventing the order of the court, which had given the go-ahead to seal illegal commercial establishments in residential areas.

 A bench headed by Chief Justice Y.K. Sabharwal said it would pass its order before the Puja vacations. The fate of several commercial properties in residential areas is, therefore, likely to be decided by Friday.

 However, authorities have suspended the sealing drive because of the notification.

 During hearings today, the bench expressed displeasure over the way the government has come in the way of court orders. The bench said every time the court passed an order, whether it was on shifting of hazardous industries, introduction of clean fuel or encroachment and unauthorised construction utmost resistance has come from those who are supposed to implement the orders.

 When solicitor-general G.E. Vahanvati submitted that there was no attempt to change the Delhi master plan, the court said you have done something in a manner which is not legal.

 The Centre defended the notification, saying the court had not restrained it from revising the master plan for the city in accordance with the Delhi Development Act 1957.

 The urban development ministry further said the notification was in consonance with the Delhi Laws (Special Provisions) Act, 2006.

 Both the notification and the 2006 law, enforced after the apex courts directive regarding the sealing drive, have been challenged 

 The government also said it has to ensure a judicious balance between the interest of residents and traders operating in residential areas. But the bench warned that its orders would not be modified by government notifications.

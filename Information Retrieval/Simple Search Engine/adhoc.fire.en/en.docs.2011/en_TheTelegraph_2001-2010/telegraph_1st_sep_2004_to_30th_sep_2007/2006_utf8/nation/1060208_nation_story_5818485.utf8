 SC panel hands split verdict on toxic ship

 New Delhi, Feb. 7 (Reuters): The panel which was tasked to prepare a report on whether the French warship Clemenceau should be broken down in India is divided in its opinion. 

 A member of the Supreme Courts Monitoring Committee on Hazardous Wastes revealed today that the panel has not made a firm recommendation to the court. It is split into two camps, each of which has submitted its own report to the court this week.

 The apex court will take a decision on February 13 on whether to allow the decommissioned aircraft carrier to be broken down at the Alang shipyard in Gujarat.

 There are two reports. One says we have no objection but attaches stringent conditions, the panelist, who did not want to be named, said. The other report says no. But both are safeguarding the countrys interests and not that of France, he added.

 Seven members had no objection to the ship being scrapped in Alang as long as it was done under strict supervision, while three were opposed to it. One member did not vote at the final meeting yesterday.

 Last month, the Supreme Court barred the 27,000-tonne ship from entering Indias territorial waters until it studied the panels recommendations and delivered a final verdict.

 The carrier, which had served in the 1991 Gulf War, left France in December, sparking protests from environmental groups like Greenpeace. The group says the vessel is laden with tonnes of hazardous materials, including 500 tonnes of toxic asbestos that poses a risk to workers at Alang.

 But the French authorities said the most dangerous work of removing 115 tonnes of brittle asbestos was done in France. The remaining 45 tonnes cannot be removed until the ship was broken up, they said.

 Greenpeace says the ship also contains polychlorinated biphenyls that are more difficult to remove and India has no facility to handle the cancer-causing chemicals.

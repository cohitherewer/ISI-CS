 Train runs over rail workers

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Siliguri, Oct. 29: Two employees of the Northeast Frontier Railway and three casual workers were run over by the Capital Express around 3 pm today between Dhoomdangi Halt and Teen Mile Haat Halt in North Dinajpur district. 

 The dead have been identified as track inspector Sudip Gayen (32), railway superviser Amarnath Singh (35), gangman Kamrul Sahani (40), and trackmen Chikku (45) and Abdul Gaffar (58). The last three were casual workers.

 The divisional commercial manager of NFR and public relations officer, New Jalpaiguri station, Taraknath Bhattacharya, said: The Danapur-bound train (3245 Dn) originated from NJP station at 2.30 pm. 

 It accidentally ran over the five persons. We received the information around 3.30 pm and immediately sent a medical team to the spot, about 25 km from NJP station. 

 GRP officials said all five of them were working on the up line when they heard the whistle of a goods train moving towards them on that track at 70 km per hour. They moved to the down track running parallel. 

 Unfortunately, the Capital Express was also hurtling towards the spot at 100 km per hour. It had also sounded its horn, but at the same time as the goods train.

 By the time the workers noticed the train, it was too late, and at 100 km per hour, the train, too, could not apply the brakes effectively, a GRP officer said after preliminary investigations.

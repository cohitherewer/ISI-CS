 Lefts Nalco grumble 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 22: This is creeping privatisation, CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury said after the government today announced 10 per cent divestment of Nalco shares.

 Barely two weeks ago, the Left had submitted a note to the government protesting its economic policies.

 Yechury said the Left parties will chalk out a plan of protest after they meet later this month and dismissed the governments claim that it will raise resources from divestment.

 There are alternative sources of resource mobilisation. The government can mop up Rs 117,000 crore from the outstanding corporate dues, he said.

 The Left maintains that divestment of profit-making public sector undertakings goes against the grain of the common minimum programme. 

 The CPM-backed Centre of Indian Trade Unions (Citu) attacked Union finance minister P. Chidambaram and attributed the Nalco divestment decision to his relationship with the Vedanta group. 

 The finance minister was on the board of Vedanta. The divestment of Nalco will benefit the Vedanta groups aluminium company Balco, a Citu leader said. 

 Yechury pointed out that an earlier divestment of 12.85 per cent of Nalco had resulted in Hindalco ? its competitor ? grabbing 1.15 per cent shares and foreign institutional investors taking over 2.19 per cent of the shares.

 In the past, the Left has forced the government to scrap its decision to divest 10 per cent of Bhel shares. It had suspended participation in the UPA-Left coordination committee meeting, protesting the governments decision. It returned to the committee after more than two months.

 The Left parties will raise the Nalco divestment issue in the monsoon session of Parliament which begins on July 24. But the protests will not lead to any political action that could unsettle the UPA government.

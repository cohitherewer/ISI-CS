 Information drive rides on three Rs

 New Delhi, Aug. 23: Rickshaw, referendum and rath: activists protesting against the proposed changes to the Right to Information Act banked on these three Rs to spice up their dharnas and fasts.

 Two hundred auto-rickshaws have been plying all over Delhi carrying large banners exhorting political leaders, particularly Sonia Gandhi, to not allow the changes to be carried out.

 Sonia Gandhi open your voice and stop the changes to the RTI. MPs do your duty. Save the sovereignty of those who elected you, goes a banner, written in blue on white cloth.

 Attached to the back of the auto-rickshaws, the banners attract attention as they flap in the wind. Activists said they had drawn hundreds of youth to RTI dharnas.

 A large number of youths has joined us after seeing the message, Magsaysay award winner Arvind Kejriwal said.

 Although the plan was to increase the number of auto-rickshaws to 1,000 this weekend, it has been kept on hold with the Centre shelving the changes for now.

 We have kept the increase of rickshaws with the message on hold, following the governments decision to not bring the amendments for now, he said.

 Another ploy that seems to have worked is a referendum of sorts. Activists armed with ballot boxes and ballot papers have been travelling across the country to gauge public sentiment on file notings being withdrawn from the purview of the act.

 The act was brought about because of public pressure. The proposal to change the act was dropped on us as a surprise, Aruna Roy, another Magsaysay award winner, said.

 The ballot boxes, taken to schools and colleges, have logged 26,000 votes, of which 98 per cent has asked the Centre to abstain from bringing in the changes, Roy said.

 Each and every person has signed and written their addresses and phone numbers. The Speakers of both Houses have been given the results last Friday. The government is welcome to call up these people and verify, she said.

 A third ploy that was used was a ghotala (scam) rath that was taken out from Jantar Mantar to different markets and localities every day during the fortnight-long RTI dharna. The rath had an umbrella on it with all the major scams listed and a person dressed as a politician called Janvani accompanied it.

 The biggest surprise for the activists, however, came by way of the huge support from NRIs.

 A large number of NRIs called up at Sonia Gandhis residence, and also at the PMs. The pressure they exerted really helped, Kejriwal said.

 Several former and current bureaucrats have also written to the Prime Minister asking him to not bring the amendments.

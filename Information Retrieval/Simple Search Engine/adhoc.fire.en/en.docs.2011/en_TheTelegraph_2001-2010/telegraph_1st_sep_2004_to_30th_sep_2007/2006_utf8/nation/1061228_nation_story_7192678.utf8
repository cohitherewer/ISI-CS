 Farmers carry on urea loot spree

 Bhopal: Faced with an acute fertiliser shortage in Madhya Pradesh, angry farmers looted over 100 sacks of urea from a truck in the Jaura area of Morena district. 

 When police tried to take back the urea bags, they were greeted with stones, forcing them to lathicharge. 

 In the violence and looting across 18 more districts of the state, farmers have taken government employees hostage, blocked traffic and attacked state-run urea distribution centres. 

 In Ratlam, where a goods train carrying urea was looted a fortnight ago, farmers stepped up protest taking four government employees hostages. 

 The employees of a urea distribution centre were released after the district administration convinced farmers that the supply of urea was adequate. 

 Incidents of looting have also been reported from Sabalganj, Datia, Vidisha, Sehore, Budhini, Harda, Hoshangabad and other parts of the state.

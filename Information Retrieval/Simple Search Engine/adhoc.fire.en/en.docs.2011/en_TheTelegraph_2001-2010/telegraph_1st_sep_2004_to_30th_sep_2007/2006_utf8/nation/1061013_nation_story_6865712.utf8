 Scotland Yard date after blast probe blow

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Oct. 12: Senior Scotland Yard officials held talks with Mumbai police top guns today in a meeting that came a day after an investigation was launched into allegations of torture and brutality by anti-terrorist squad probing the July 11 train blasts.

 It was a good interaction. We shared information. The British team will be back in November for more discussions and sharing of information, said commissioner A. N. Roy after talks with Stuart Harrison, deputy chief of the anti-terrorist branch of Metropolitan Police of London, better known as Scotland Yard. Anti-terrorist squad chief K. P. Raghuvanshi was also present.

 A team of the elite UK police has been in the city for the past week. In fact, the two sides have been sharing information ever since it came to light that some of the accused in Mumbai had information about bombings in London.

 Chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh asked director-general of police P.S. Pasricha to look into torture charges after blast suspects filed affidavits with the Prime Ministers Office. 

 Seven of the 16 accused told the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act court on Monday they were tortured into giving confessional statements to the squad.

 These kind of retractions are routine. Professional investigators understand the complexity of such a case. And thats why we had such a good meeting with our British counterparts. The retraction of statements by the accused is not a setback. We have strong and adequate material evidence against them, Raghuvanshi said after the meeting.

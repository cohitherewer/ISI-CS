 Amit ads stay

 Karachi, Aug. 12 (PTI): Amitabh Bachchan continued to dominate the streets of Karachi today despite the city governments orders for removal of billboards showing the actor in front of a Pakistani flag.

 The publicity wing of Telefun, a private call-in entertainment company, while complying with the governments instructions, has placed new billboards and posters on all major city streets showing Bachchan (in picture) against a green background.

 Telefun is using Bachchans image as part of their efforts to promote their call-in programmes and quizzes. But authorities here took objection to posters showing Bachchan in front of a Pakistani flag and ordered their removal.

 The city governments objection was justified and we understand their position. Now we have replaced the Pakistani flag with a green background to which the local administration should not have any objections, a spokesman of Telefun said today.

 Bachchan, who is immensely popular in Pakistan, has not been signed by Telefun. Nor will he make any guest appearance in any of its shows.

 More than 2,500 billboards and banners of all sizes have been put up on all the major roads of the city to promote Telefuns new show that will be launched on August 14 Pakistans independence day.

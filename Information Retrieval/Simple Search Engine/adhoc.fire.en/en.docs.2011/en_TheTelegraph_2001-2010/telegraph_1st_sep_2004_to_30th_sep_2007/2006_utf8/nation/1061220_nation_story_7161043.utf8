 2007 target for quota in private colleges

 PC: Saying his piece

 New Delhi, Dec. 19: The Centre wants private institutions of higher education to introduce quotas before their next academic year commences in March 2007.

 The human resource development (HRD) ministry has already begun speeding up the bill that will introduce quotas in private unaided deemed universities and private institutions affiliated to central universities. 

 The difficulty before the government is how to bring the bill quickly to Parliament, whose winter session has ended. It is now scheduled to meet only in February. Since the next academic session begins in March-April, there is hardly any time left to move and get the bill passed.

 An ordinance bringing the bill into effect before February is an option, but the Centre fears opposition to the move not only from the BJP but also from the Left parties.

 The process of speeding up the bill has started in right earnest. Finance minister P. Chidambaram, part of the three-minister group examining the bill, today offered his opinion in meetings with HRD ministry officials. Once he, along with Pranab Mukherjee and Arjun Singh, finalise the bill, it can be sent to the cabinet.

 The HRD ministry is worried that private institutions including 63 deemed universities may escape the quota net in their next session. Sources say their admission notices usually appear in December-January. If the bill isnt introduced soon, reservations could be delayed.

 The Parliament has just passed the bill introducing 27 per cent quota for OBC students in government-managed and aided higher educational institutions. 

 Initially, the ministry wanted to bring a single bill, covering both government and private institutions, but was forced by a section of the Cabinet to frame separate laws.

 At the last Cabinet meeting, where OBC quotas in government institutions were cleared, Lok Janshakti Party leader and Union chemicals minister Ram Vilas Paswan had raised the issue of private institutions. 

 He had said the real objective of the legislation introducing reservations in private institutions had still not been achieved. The Left parties had echoed the same sentiment, but did so in their interactions with the media.

 Leaders of the UPAs Southern allies, the DMK and the PMK, have also said in Parliament that the Centre shouldnt delay the bill on private institutions. 

 Once the bill is passed, these institutions, which have never had quotas, will have to reserve 27 per cent of their seats for OBCs, 15 per cent for scheduled castes and 7.5 per cent for scheduled tribes.

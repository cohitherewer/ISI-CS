 Ranchi trio plots revolt

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Ranchi, Sept. 3: Amid speculation that three Independent ministers are ready to switch sides in Jharkhand, Speaker Inder Singh Namdhari today decided to cut short his foreign visit and return to the state capital tomorrow.

 Sources said Namdhari, who was to have travelled to Nigeria, was asked to fly back to help in the trouble-shooting that the state government has launched following murmurs that the three ministers Madhu Koda, Anosh Ekka and Harinarayan Rai could dump the NDA and cross over to the UPA.

 Namdhari, however, told The Telegraph over phone from London that he was cutting short his visit on the advice of doctors. Both he and his wife are indisposed, he said. 

 Namdhari was supposed to attend a meeting of parliamentarians in Nigeria and return to Ranchi on September 12.

 A senior RJD leader said the UPA has decided to accept Koda as chief minister. The three ministers will submit their resignations in a day or two, he claimed, adding the nitty-gritty of the cabinet was being finalised.

 A meeting of the UPA was scheduled to be held in Delhi later in the evening. 

 The RJD leader said the operation to oust the Arjun Munda government was launched four months ago, when the first major cracks appeared in the group of five Independent ministers.

 Sources said parleys to form an alternative government were on at the Delhi farmhouse of former Congress MP R.K. Anand. Under the formula, seven Independent and five RJD legislators will form the government. The JMM and the Congress will extend support from outside, an RJD source said.

 Anand, however, denied hosting any such meeting. Let us see how confident they are about quitting the Munda cabinet, he said.

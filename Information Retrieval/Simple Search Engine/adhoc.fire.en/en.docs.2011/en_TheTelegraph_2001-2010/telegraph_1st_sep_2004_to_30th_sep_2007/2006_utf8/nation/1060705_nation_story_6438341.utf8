 Radio ropes in Rahman 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, July 4: WorldSpace satellite radio, which is yet to catch on in India six years after it was launched, is going from coffee shops to colleges to woo listeners.

 Its our vision to offer Indians a truly global radio experience ? giving them the variety, quality and the ability to choose what they want to listen to, said Tedros Lemma, corporate vice-president of the company which could find competition getting tougher under the new licence regime which will see 300 new FM stations come up. 

 WorldSpace radio has grown from 21,000 subscribers in March 2005 to more than 110,000 subscribers in 2006. But its not nearly enough.

 Yesterday, it signed up music maestro A.R. Rahman to get itself heard. Rahman has composed the signature tune for WorldSpace ? which weaves in sounds of the sea and fishermen with birdcalls and other everywhere sounds ? and will also endorse the brand. 

 The company has tied up with youth hangouts such as Barista, Cafe Coffee Day and Music World and also set up its own outlets called WorldSpace Lounges to reach out to prospective consumers. 

 Recently, it came out with a Try and Buy offer, installing WorldSpace in peoples homes on a seven-day trial. A radio receiver, which can offer 40 channels, including music and current affairs,is available for less than Rs 2,000. 

 WorldSpace is also trying to reach out through events in various colleges. 

 The new communications campaign, of which Rahman is an integral part, is based on extensive studies with existing as well as potential customers across India. 

 Chief marketing officer Arti Mehta said: We will leverage this imposing persona, and his undoubted association with quality music, to build awareness for our brand and connect with music lovers across India. 

 We have developed an aggressive integrated campaign that involves a refreshing new series of TV commercials and on-ground events, including concerts, contests and awards.

 Assault probe after rights rap

 Krishnagar: A visually-challenged man, 

 who was beaten up by local toughs in Bengals Nadia 

 district, had to petition the human rights commission to 

 get police to begin a probe over three months after the 

 incident. 

 An officer from the same police station that had earlier turned away 55-year-old Bhagirath Haldar knocked at his door to record his statement on Wednesday.

 The rights panel wrote to the Nadia superintendent of police, asking him to ensure that Bhagirath got justice. Prodded by their boss, the police got cracking. 

 On July 8, Bhagiraths son Ramprasad, a mason, asked neighbour Saumitra Sarkar to pay him for the repairs he had carried out on his house. 

 When Ramprasad saw him (Sarkar) at a tea stall that evening, he demanded his dues. But he beat up my son, said Bhagirath.

 An angry Bhagirath then confronted Sarkar. But he had not bargained for what happened to him next. 

 Sarkar and some of his associates attacked me. They kicked me and slapped me at the same place where they beat up my son, Bhagirath said.

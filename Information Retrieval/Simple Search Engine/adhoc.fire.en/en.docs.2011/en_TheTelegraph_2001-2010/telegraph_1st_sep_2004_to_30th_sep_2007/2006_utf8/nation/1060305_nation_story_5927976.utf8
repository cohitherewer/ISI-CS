 Goa clash over prayer hall

 OUR CORRESPONDENT AND AGENCIES

 Panaji, March 4: The communal clash virus appears to have struck in twin towns in interior Goa with mobs going on a serial rampage since the attack on a prayer hall this week.

 A group of people had on Wednesday damaged the hall in Guddamol locality of the dusty mining town of Sanvordem, sparking protests and counter-protests that have now spread to the twin town of Curchorem.

 Sanvordem and Curchorem lie along the rail tracks connecting Vasco Da Gama port with Hubli in north Karnataka. They are about 50 km from Panaji.

 Angry groups protesting the arrest of colleagues during a clash last night attacked a police station in Sanvordem today, leading to a lathicharge and clamping of prohibitory orders.

 Yesterday, trouble had erupted in the afternoon after the minority community staged a protest rally ? with permission from the Quepem deputy collector ? to condemn the damage to the hall.

 As word spread, a rival group organised a counter-rally in the same locality in Sanvordem. By sundown, the group had swelled to a few thousands.

 Sniffing a clash brewing, police stepped in, urging the protesters to disperse. The mob then began pelting the police with stones and bottles, forcing them to use canes and fire a few shots in the air.

 There was no stopping the mob after that. They began burning down shops belonging to the minority communities, torched five vehicles and targeted two fuel stations. Some were reported to have rushed to the damaged prayer hall and razed it to the ground. Five people were injured in the clashes.

 As the violence swung out of control, the police began rounding up the mischief-makers. Around 100 people were held, sparking the retaliatory attack on the police station.

 This is probably the first instance in recent times that a communal conflict has broken out in Goa.

 DIG Ujwal Mishra said additional police forces had been deployed and the situation was now under control. 

 Minority community members have been evacuated from sensitive areas to prevent further clashes.

 Congress chief minister Pratapsinh Rane and governor S.C. Jamir visited the area today and appealed for peace. But small groups of people were seen pelting stones.

 Opposition leader Manohar Parrikar, who stays in Sanvordem, blamed the clashes on the failure of the district administration. 

 Some people from the minority community had come with choppers and other weapons, which made the people retaliate, he alleged.

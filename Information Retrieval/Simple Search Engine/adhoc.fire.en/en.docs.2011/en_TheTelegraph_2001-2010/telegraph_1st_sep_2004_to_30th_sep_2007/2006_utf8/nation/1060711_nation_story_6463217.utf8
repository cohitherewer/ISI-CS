The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Pass rate under probe 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, July 10: Bengal school education minister Partha De told the Assembly today that lenient marking of answer scripts in school selection tests had led to the unusual drop in the success rate in this years secondary examinations. 

 There could be multiple factors responsible for the (5 per cent) dip in the success rate. But preliminary reports have revealed that there was a higher number of failures this time because of the schools decision to detain a minimum number of students in the Madhyamik selection tests, De said. 

 The government has asked the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education, which conducts the exam, to probe whether there were other factors responsible for the decline in the pass percentage, the minister said while responding to a question by the Trinamul Congresss Partha Chatterjee.

 The pass percentage, which had hovered around 70 per cent for the past six years, dropped to 64.95 per cent this year, the lowest since 1999, when it was 58.26 per cent.

 A record 7,51,459 examinees had taken the examination this year, 1.4 lakh more than in 2005. 

 De explained that many weak students were allowed to appear for Madhyamik because this years examination was the last to be held on the old syllabus. 

 The minister said that students of the 2006 batch, once they were stopped from sitting this years examination, would have had to face the new syllabus next year. In that case, they would have been inconvenienced, De said.

 Only failed students would be allowed to take the test on the old syllabus in 2007. 

 But leniency shown by schools need not be the only cause of the drop in success rate, De reminded the House. 

 The standard of questions, evaluation strategy and the number of students enrolled for the exam could have also had a bearing.

 The number of Madhyamik candidates rose by 22 per cent (in 2006). Till last year, the increase had never been over 13 per cent in a year. It could be that the success rate has dropped because of the sudden rise in the number of examinees. We are examining this aspect, De said.

 Chatterjee blamed the school education department for compromising the standard of the examination while trying to protect the students from facing a new syllabus.

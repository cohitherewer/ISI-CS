 Atal talks of leash on Pak

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Dehra Dun, Sept. 8: Atal Bihari Vajpayee blamed the UPA governments soft anti-terror policies for the blasts in Malegaon today, saying such terrorist strikes could not be prevented unless Pakistan was contained.

 He urged the Centre to adopt a carrot-and-stick policy towards the neighbour.

 Murderous attacks have happened in Malegaon time and again. The government has been able to prevent such incidents. You cannot stop terror attacks till you contain Pakistan. I am in favour of the dialogue continuing with our neighbour but, at the same time, we should adopt a more stringent attitude towards terrorist activities. Atankwad ke khilaf do-took jawab dena chahiye (Our response to terrorism should be swift and stringent), the former Prime Minister said at the BJPs national executive session.

 He said the January 2004 joint statement he signed with President Pervez Musharraf had laid the basis for preventing Pakistan from supporting the infrastructure of terror. 

 Musharraf had assured India that he would not permit territory under Pakistans control to be used to support terrorism in any manner, Vajpayee said. We had made a beginning. But our government collapsed. After that, everything has gone astray, Vajpayee added.

 Pointing out that the Mumbai train blast case has not been cracked yet, he said efforts to curb terrorism must be stepped up. Our intelligence-gathering has to be more effective. A number of facts have been ignored in the Mumbai blast case. It is most unfortunate.

 Earlier at the session, leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha L.K. Advani described the Malegaon attacks as a very serious incident. 

 Coming as it did in the aftermath of the Mumbai blasts, it is a very serious incident. The government should handle it in a much better way, he said.

 BJP president Rajnath Singh demanded that the government force Pakistan to destroy the terror infrastructure on its soil. 

 We can assist the Pakistan government in ensuring that terror infrastructure is dismantled. The NDA had been able to act decisively in dismantling terror camps in Bhutan and Myanmar. The government should be more attentive, he added.

 Rajnath said scrapping the Prevention of Terrorism Act was a grave mistake and called for a stringent law to counter terror.

 China claims Arunachal 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 13: China has staked claim on Arunachal Pradesh, a television channel quoted Chinese ambassador to Delhi Sun Yuxi as saying.

 In our position, the whole of what you call the state of Arunachal Pradesh is Chinese territory and Tawang is only one place in it and we are claiming all of that, thats our position, Yuxi said in the television interview.

 The Chinese ambassador has gone public about the glitch in resolving the border dispute ahead of President Hu Jintaos visit to Delhi starting November 20.

 Delhi and Beijing have appointed special representatives Indian national security adviser M.K. Narayanan and Chinese vice-foreign minister Dai Binguo to deal with the border issue. It was expected that the next round of special representative-level talks would be held either before Hus visit or immediately afterwards.

 It is learnt that Delhi had sought border talks ahead of the presidential visit but it was cancelled after Beijing showed reluctance to go ahead with it. India was hoping that any progress in the border talks would have helped in building confidence during Hus visit.

 China has discounted that its claim is not restricted just for Tawang district but the entire region. The hardline position has blocked progress in the boundary talks. Delhi has tried in vain to make Beijing show flexibility.

 Delhi refrained from officially commenting on the Chinese ambassadors remark and preferred to wait. Beijings stake over Tawang and other areas like Longjou, Asafica and Kingzemange had prompted the Indian government to strengthen its position in the border state by developing crucial infrastructure like a comprehensive road network.

 This will mean building around 3,000 km of roads in Arunachal Pradesh.

 If Chinas claim is on Arunachal Pradesh in the eastern sector, India says Aksai Chin in north-west Kashmir belongs to it. There have also been talks on a trade-off between the two sides on concessions to each other in Aksai Chin and Arunachal Pradesh.

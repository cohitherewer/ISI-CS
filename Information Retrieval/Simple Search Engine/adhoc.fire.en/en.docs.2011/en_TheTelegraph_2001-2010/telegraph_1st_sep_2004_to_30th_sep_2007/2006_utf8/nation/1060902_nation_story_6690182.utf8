 Party quizzes PM on farmers

 New Delhi, Sept. 1: Four 

 state-unit presidents and two general secretaries of the 

 Congress today asked Prime Minister Manmohan Singh what 

 the government was doing to help distressed and suicide-prone 

 farmers outside Vidarbha.

 He was asked when relief packages 

 for 30 other districts in Maharashtra, Kerala, Karnataka 

 and Andhra Pradesh would be announced. The leaders also 

 wanted to know when details of the Vidarbha bailout would 

 be spelt out.

 Singh told the delegation he was 

 on the job and that the Prime Ministers 

 Office (PMO) would get the ministries concerned on board 

 before going ahead with announcements.

 The team comprised Congress general 

 secretaries Digvijay Singh and Margaret Alva, besides presidents 

 of the partys units in Kerala, Karnataka, Maharashtra 

 and Andhra Pradesh.

 They were told that agriculture 

 minister Sharad Pawar would soon visit Kerala, where farmer 

 suicides were on the rise. The minister of state in the 

 PMO, Prithviraj Chauhan, will oversee the implementation 

 of packages.

 According to Digvijay, the meeting 

 was called to tell the Prime Minister that the Centres 

 promises in Vidarbha and elsewhere must be reflected 

 on the ground. Everywhere we go, we are asked 

 what is the PMs package? The details should be spelt 

 out, Alva said.

 With the new sowing season close, 

 farmers direly need seeds, but those in suicide-prone areas 

 have no money to buy them, Alva said.

 The delegation raised crop-loan 

 problems too, telling the Prime Minister that while interest 

 was waived in 31 districts, the loans were not rescheduled. 

 The result was that farmers were declared defaulters 

 and got no further credit. There should be differential 

 interest rates for distressed farmers, said Alva.

 The party chief in Andhra, Keshav 

 Rao, explained how in the past two years, suicide rates 

 had dropped from 150 per month to five because of easy credit, 

 subsidy on interest rates and timely availability of fertilisers, 

 pesticides and seeds. 

 He said he had taken the issue 

 of farmers being overcharged for genetically modified cotton 

 seeds (a key cash crop) to the Monopolies and Restrictive 

 Trade Practices Commission, which ordered a price cut from 

 Rs 1100 per kg to Rs 400.

 These were the other points raised 

 at the meeting:

 The Centre had promised one job per family of the farmers 

 who had killed themselves. The policy was in place in 

 only five districts of Maharashtra but there was no one 

 to ensure this was being implemented

 In Karnataka, the BJP-JD (S) government practised very 

 careful discrimination in the areas that picked 

 Congress legislators. Nothing was done about this

 Two more districts of Kerala, Alleppey and Idduki should 

 be included in the suicide-prone list of Wyanad, 

 Palakkad and Ottapalam

 In Kerala, the crop insurance scheme should cover spices, 

 rubber and other cash crops

 Centre cracks whip on IFS duo

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 14: Two erring senior foreign service officials have fallen in line after a stern warning from the government.

 Special secretary (economic relations) Rakesh Kumar ? he had been evading interrogation after being booked by the CBI in a human trafficking case ? returned home today. 

 The Indian high commissioner in New Zealand, Harish Kumar Dogra, who defied his recall order and even sent a stinker to foreign secretary Shyam Saran, will be back tomorrow.

 Kumar had got himself admitted in a hospital in Munich on his way back from Brazil to avoid questioning by the CBI. Having waited 15 days for him, the investigative agency served the officer a summons yesterday.

 Official sources said the CBI would wait for Kumar to turn up voluntarily for questioning. He can be arrested only if he does not cooperate in the investigation.

 A source said the IFS officer had indicated that he would not defy the summons and is ready to be quizzed.

 Kumar has been accused of illegally sending a dance troupe, Mehak Punjab Di, to Germany last year. Nine members of the troupe had disappeared after landing in Berlin. 

 Kumar, who was then director-general of the Indian Council of Cultural Relations (ICCR), has been charged with conspiracy as he empanelled the bhangra group.

 The officer will be questioned to verify the claims made by others arrested in the case, including Ludhiana resident Shiv Kumar Sharma, and Kumars colleague in the ICCR, Kehkashan Tyagi. Sharma is accused of arranging the trip for the bhangra group.

 The CBI had recovered Rs 4 lakh from Kumars house during raids and found several documents linking him with the racket.

 While Kumar was asked to return following complaints by members of the Indian community in Germany, Dogra not only refused to come back, he also fired a salvo at Saran asking him to resign.

 The move invited tough action from the government, which issued him an ultimatum to return at the earliest. The diplomat will face the music when he lands from Wellington tomorrow ? action will be taken against him for insubordination and defying government orders.

 Dogra had written a letter to the foreign secretary, accusing him of nepotism and tarnishing the image of the country in New Zealand. He alleged that he was sacked without any explanation.

 After the contents of the letter were leaked to newspapers in New Zealand, the external affairs ministry reacted angrily saying the diplomats conduct was not in line with his position.

 Dogras letter described his recall order as ill-advised and illegal and accused the foreign secretary of violating the basic principles of natural justice in decision-making in such a serious matter.

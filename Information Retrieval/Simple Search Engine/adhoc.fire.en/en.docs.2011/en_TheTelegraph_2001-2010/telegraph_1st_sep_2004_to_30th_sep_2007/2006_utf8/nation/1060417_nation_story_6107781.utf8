 Agartala, April 16: Head held high, the young man strode up to the governor, shook hands with him, received the gold medal and calmly returned to his seat in the auditorium. 

 This scene from the Tripura University convocation last week would have been just another photo-op but for the fact that the recipient of the medal was Damodar Tripura. 

 The son of a jhum cultivator from one of the remotest areas of the state, Damodar is the first tribal ever to win a gold medal for academic excellence in Tripura University.

 I find it hard to believe that I have come this far; it has been very difficult, Damodar said after the function, his voice cracking.

 Life has indeed been tough for Damodar, who topped the BA merit list in 2004 with honours in political science and is awaiting the results of the MA exam.

 In the first three years since leaving my village for further studies, I went home only once because I had no money to travel. I would stay back in the hostel even during holidays and survive on a diet of boiled potato and papaya, he recalled.

 Damodar hails from Raisyabari, a militant-infested village in south Tripura where, till 2001, even police had to pay money to the gun-toting guerrillas. 

 Raisyabari High School did not have regular teachers then and the tribal lad passed the 1999 matric examination in the first division without any guidance. The academic achievement was, however, marred by a personal loss. 

 Damodars father, Sandhyamoni, a jhumia (shifting cultivator), died that very year, leaving the family without any source of income. 

 I thought my career had ended, too, but my family (his mother, sisters and a younger brother) stood by me and here I am, he said.

 Apart from his familys support, Damodar received help from a resident of Karbook, in Amarpur subdivision. His mentor arranged for free boarding and lodging in a government-run tribal students hostel in the small town and another phase of the youths life began. The rest, as they say, is history.

 Damodar now earns some money giving private tuitions in Raisyabari. God and my family have been kind to me, but I regret that my father is not alive to see what I have done, he said.

 His one remaining aim in life is to teach in a college. 

 I may have got the gold medal but I unless I do well in MA, I cannot be a college teacher, Damodar said, feet firmly planted on the ground.

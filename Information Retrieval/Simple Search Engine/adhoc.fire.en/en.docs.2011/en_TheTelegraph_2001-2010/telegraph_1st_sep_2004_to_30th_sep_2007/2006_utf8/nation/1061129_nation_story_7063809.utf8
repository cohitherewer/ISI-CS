 Amnesia hits Khadim case 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Roy Burman 

 Calcutta, Nov. 28: Investigators probing the July 2001 abduction of footwear baron Partha Pratim Roy Burman suffered a setback today after the Khadim co-owner, the main witness and victim, refused to identify any of the accused.

 It prompted the Bengal government to declare him a hostile witness and request the judge to allow his cross-examination tomorrow.

 Earlier in the day, Roy Burman told the special court, set up inside Alipore Central Jail, how he was confined in a dark and dingy room for nearly a fortnight after his July 21 abduction. He also recalled how he returned to his Salt Lake home on August 2.

 But when all the accused were lined up in front of Roy Burman, he refused to identify them. He said it is not possible for him to identify the abductors because he could not recognise them, said public prosecutor Naba Kumar Ghosh. He even failed to identify those who kept him confined and dropped him at Dum Dum on the day of his release.

 The kidnappers had approached Roy Burmans family shortly after the abduction. His family members had demanded proof. The abductors had then asked the family to draw up a list of questions that only Roy Burman would know the answers to. Today, Roy Burman told the court he could not recall his answers being taped.

 Roy Burman also skirted the issue of ransom, though in the statement he gave investigators after his release, he had said the kidnappers told him he was being freed because his family had paid up.

 The prosecution refused to accept todays developments as a setback. If he refuses to identify the accused or denies the ransom amount he had paid for his release, it will not go against our findings. Along with general investigations, we had conducted a high-tech probe that is enough to prove the accused guilty, Ghosh said.

 New Delhi, Feb. 1 (PTI): The upmarket MG Road, the hub of fashion in the capital, was targeted by the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) today following the high courts orders that unauthorised shopping complexes in the Lal Dora areas should be demolished.

 Some portions of the shopping complex on MG-1 Road, housing outlets of some of the biggest names in Indian fashion, was demolished today, MCD officials said.

 Parts of the ground floor and first floor of the imposing 55-shop complex were demolished, they said, adding that the action will continue tomorrow.

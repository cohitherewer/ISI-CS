 Osama letter for blast judge

 OUR BUREAU AMP; AGENCIES

 Mumbai, Oct. 17: A person calling himself Osama sahab has written to the anti-terror court trying the 1993 blasts case saying Islamic Shariat laws are supreme and that the accused be acquitted.

 The postcard, received by the court a few days ago, has been sent to Mumbai police commissioner A.N. Roy and other authorities for necessary action, sources said here today. It is addressed to judge P. D. Kode, who has received such letters in the past, too, some warning him not to be strict with the accused and to show mercy.

 The mystery message came on a day suspicion fell on underworld don Chhota Rajan in the daring daylight shooting of Amjad Hussain Khan, 36, and Himanshu Chaudhary, 32, at Kala Ghoda, just outside the sessions court where they would have attended a crucial hearing.

 Sources said Amjad, arrested in a mandrax seizure case, turned informer after his release on bail. His tip-offs, sources said, had helped unearth a gun-running operation by the Rajan gang on May 21 this year. Police suspect the don ordered Amjads killing to avenge the bust-up.

 Srinagar, June 24: Firing by security forces killed a Class XII student near north Kashmirs Pattan town today, prompting a mob to torch a police station and block the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad highway.

 Teenager Tariq Ahmad Sofi got caught in the crossfire when militants attacked a Central Reserve Police Force convoy on the highway at Palhalan near Pattan, 35 km from Srinagar, police said.

 Local villagers alleged that Sofi was killed in the return fire by the guards of the CRPF deputy inspector-general. A woman and a man were critically injured in the incident and have been admitted to hospital.

 Immediately after the shooting, a mob of over 5,000 blocked the highway demanding punishment for those responsible for Sofis death, a police officer said.

 The mob later attacked the local police station with stones and, braving tear gas and a baton-charge, managed to set it ablaze. The police replied by firing in the air.

 A portion of the building has been reduced to ashes, destroying all the records stored there.

 Senior police officers have rushed to Pattan, where small groups of protesters kept attacking the police with stones through the evening. Traffic has been suspended on the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad highway.

 In Kupwara, another civilian was injured in a gun battle between security forces and guerrillas.

 A grenade hurled by militants on a security picket in Srinagars Badshah Chowk killed one person and injured 10, including a jawan. The picket was guarding a building housing the holy mace of Shiva.

 Elsewhere in the state, two Hizb-ul Mujahideen militants were killed in a joint operation by the army and police. The rebels were hiding in the house of Mohammad Shafi Indrabi at Mirbagh-Ratnipora in Pulwama, south Kashmir. An officer, Captain S.B. Singh, died in the gunfight and a jawan was injured.

 In Doda district of Jammu, five persons were arrested after an improvised explosive device fitted to a pressure cooker was found under the seat of their Matador van, the police said.

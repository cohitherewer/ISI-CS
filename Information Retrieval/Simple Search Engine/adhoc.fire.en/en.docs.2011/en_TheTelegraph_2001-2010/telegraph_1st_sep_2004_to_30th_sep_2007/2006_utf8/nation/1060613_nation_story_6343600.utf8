 CPM between allies amp; bandh

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, June 12: The Left Front partners want a bandh in Bengal to press Delhi for a rollback of the fuel price hike, but not the CPM. 

 Unhappy with the Big Brothers reluctance to shut down Bengal just a month after returning to power with the promise of industrialisation, its allies met today with the option of the strike topping their agenda.

 CPM leaders, however, only promised sit-ins in front of central government offices tomorrow to protest against the hike. 

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today remained non-committal on slashing the sales tax or cess on fuel. Delhi has created the mess. Let the Centre lower taxes first, he said at Writers Buildings. 

 Asked if the decision of some Congress-ruled states to lower taxes was a move to create pressure on other governments, he shot back: Who is pressuring whom? 

 However, the front partners are still keen on a strike, a tradition Bengal is slowly leaving behind. A meeting to discuss the bandh will be held in Delhi on Thursday, said Abani Roy of the RSP. 

 We should go for a bigger movement, a strike, to pressure the UPA government at the Centre to lower the sales tax. A lukewarm protest will not serve the purpose, CPI state secretary Manju Kumar Majumdar told front chairman Biman Bose during a meeting with him this morning.

 Forward Bloc leader Hafiz Alam Sairani called upon Bose to follow the example of DMK-ruled Tamil Nadu. If the Tamil Nadu government can slash the cess, we can follow suit, Sairani said. 

 RSP state secretary Debabrata Bandopadhyay, too, asked Bose to consider the bandh option. Earlier, too, we had called Bharat bandhs to protest against the Congress-led central government, he reminded the CPM state secretary. 

 At a front meeting last week, Bose, however, had discouraged the allies to think about a bandh keeping in mind the chief ministers dislike for it. When we are wooing investors from across the world, we should not do anything that might send a wrong signal to them, he had told the front leaders. 

 It is apparently quite a change of tack. The CPM had called a nationwide strike on September 29, 2005, to protest against the Centres decision to disinvest Bhels shares. 

 On February 24, 2004, the party had called a bandh to protest against the NDAs anti-people policies, including a fuel price hike.

 Salem plea to Lisbon

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, June 6: Gangster Abu Salem plans to move a Lisbon court for his recall to Portugal and has alleged that Indian authorities have violated the terms under which he was allowed to be extradited from the European country.

 Salems defence team led by Ashok Sarogi will fly to Lisbon on Wednesday to file an application pointing out the alleged violations of the extradition clauses.

 Salem and his companion Monica Bedi were extradited from Portugal last year after a long legal battle.

 Salems defence team said the Indian authorities had agreed to the extradition terms which said the gangster would be allowed to travel to India for trials in connection with eight criminal cases but no further investigations would be carried out in these cases.

 They said chargesheets had been filed against Salem in the murder cases of builder Pradeep Jain and Manisha Koiralas secretary Ajit Dewani apart from the 1993 Mumbai blasts case, indicating that Salem was subject to investigations.

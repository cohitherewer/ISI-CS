 Blasts trail to Valley

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Jammu, Aug. 4: Abdul Hameed of Poonch district has been arrested after Mumbai police wanted to interrogate him in connection with the July 11 blasts.

 He will be flown to Mumbai tomorrow.

 Hameed was traced through his ID card found at Matunga railway station, one of the blast sites. Investigators then discovered that he had left the city after the bombings.

 He was arrested yesterday from his home at Sania village in the militancy-hit Surankote area. Agency reports said Hameed is a Lashkar-e-Toiba militant who was entrusted with the task of establishing a terror network in Mumbai.

 However, Jammu and Kashmir police said they have found evidence of hardly any involvement of Hameed in the blasts. Nor do they have any record of his alleged links with Lashkar.

 At the moment, Hameed is a suspect, inspector-general of police S.P. Vaid said.

 Hameed was handed over to a Mumbai police team after the chief judicial magistrate of Poonch allowed his transit remand. 

 Since Mumbai police wanted him, he will be flown to Mumbai on Saturday, and his fate will be decided there, a senior police officer said.

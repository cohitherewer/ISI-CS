 US grants visa, but scientist drops visit

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Bangalore, Feb. 25: Govardhan Mehta was busy at his office on Saturday evening, instead of packing his bags to travel to a conference at the University of Florida.

 The scientist was granted a visa by the US yesterday after initial refusal sparked an uproar. 

 But Mehta had made up his mind. I cancelled my tickets on February 10 itself, a day after I was humiliated by the US consulate in Chennai, the organic chemist said.

 The Paris-based International Council for Science Unions, of which Mehta is the president, had protested after he was denied a visa and asked to fill up a supplementary questionnaire on his research and reapply. The consulate accused him of hiding information that could possibly be used for chemical weapons.

 Chemistry has produced life-saving drugs and it is one of the sources for life. I felt insulted and this kind of questioning is absurd, he said today. 

 I had not imagined in my wildest dreams that this could happen to me. I have been to the US dozens of times on teaching assignments as well as been invited for presenting papers, added Mehta, who is also a former head of the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore.

 Embarrassed by the uproar just ahead of George W. Bushs visit to India, the US claimed the visa had not been refused, merely delayed, and granted it yesterday. 

 Mehta said the US consulate sent someone to his office to pick up his passport and got it visa-stamped. But since I had already decided not to go, that is why I am here.

 The scientist, who has taught in the US, Britain, France, Germany and Japan, said: I received hundreds of mails, particularly from youngsters, in which people reacted with anger. To me, cancelling this visit has been of no consequence. I did not lose anything by not going.

 But if this had happened to youngsters, they would have lost a chance to learn and spread ideas. Such a thing should not happen to the scientific community anywhere. Our dignity should be respected and governments should help in free movement.

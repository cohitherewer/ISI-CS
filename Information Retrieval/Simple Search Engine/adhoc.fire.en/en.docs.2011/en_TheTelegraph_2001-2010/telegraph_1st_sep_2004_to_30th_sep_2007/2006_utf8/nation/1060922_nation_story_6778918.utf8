The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Nation at a Glance

 Coke commercial under WHO glare

 New Delhi: Coca-Cola India has informed 

 the World Health Organisation that it had not referred to 

 the world health body in its advertisement to promote a 

 product or make a commercial gain but only to share objective 

 information to educate the public. 

 Responding to a letter sent by the WHO on a safety communication issued by Coca-Cola, the company said it had stopped using the communication long before the issue was raised by the world body. 

 We had stopped using the safety communication on August 18, long prior to the receipt of your letter. It has not been issued in print or other media since that date, the company said. 

 A WHO spokesperson told The Telegraph that as a rule the WHO name cannot be used to endorse any commercial product. 

 General in liquor theft net

 New Belhi: A major general has been cashiered 

 and sentenced to three years rigorous imprisonment 

 by an army court that found him guilty of smuggling liquor 

 and misappropriating money. 

 A court of inquiry had earlier established that G.I. Singh, who was the commander of a mountain division, was involved in certain illegal activities pertaining to misuse of funds and canteen stores, a source said. 

 After this, Singh was tried and sentenced by a general court martial. The army courts sentence is subject to confirmation by the army chief. 

 Singh had allegedly sent four truckloads of liquor to Sangrur in Punjab. The liquor, provided at subsidised prices to soldiers, was to be sold in the open market.

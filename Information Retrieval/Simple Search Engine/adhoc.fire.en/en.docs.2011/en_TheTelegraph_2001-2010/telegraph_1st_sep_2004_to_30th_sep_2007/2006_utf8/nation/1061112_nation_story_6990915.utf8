 Hazratbal gets set for a facelift

 MUZAFFAR RAINA

 The Hazratbal shrine, which is being revamped after the 1993 siege

 Srinagar, Nov. 11: Exactly 13 years back, when Hazratbal, Kashmirs most sacred shrine, was under a month-long siege, the Valley was simmering with resentment. Today, the people have something to celebrate. 

 This world-famous shrine, which houses Moi-e-Muqaddas or the relic of Prophet Mohammed, is getting a makeover to enhance its panoramic view and increase its capacity for devotees almost three fold, to seven lakh. 

 The alignment of its surroundings should be such that the shrine appears in the centre as one of the magnificent and grand structures, said chief minister Ghulam Nabi Azad, the brain behind the plan. 

 The shrine is located on the banks of the Dal Lake. To its north is the Kashmir University; it is flanked by the National Institute of Technology and the Naseem Bagh garden. 

 A large number of people live around it. But we now have instructions from the chief minister that it (the shrine) should be seen from all sides from a distance, said Kashmirs divisional commissioner Basharat Ahmad Dar.

 Around 100 residential houses and shops that will have to make way to ensure a better view of Hazratbal have been earmarked. 

 The revamp will create more room for devotees, too. Its capacity will be increased to seven lakh. The area around will be developed into bigger lawns, he said. Around 2.5 lakh can now pray together. 

 Shaheer Hussain, one of those who live near the shrine, said it is painful for the locals. We have great faith in this place and we have been living here for generations. Also since it is a religious centre, many people earn their livelihood. They will be rendered jobless. 

 However, Mubashir Hussain, residing in the same area, described shifting structures as a good decision. Lakhs of people come here and we need to create more space. 

 The all-marble Hazratbal was built by the Muslim Waqf Board in the 1960s but the history of the shrine goes back to 1699, when the relic of the Prophet was brought here. 

 The religious and political significance of the shrine is enormous. It was at the centre of the campaign against the Dogra monarchy launched by Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah. 

 In 1963, the Prophets relic disappeared, setting off a storm across the state that eventually blew over only when the ancient artefact was traced. 

 On October 15, 1993, militants took refuge inside Hazratbal, leading to the siege that triggered protests and shutdowns during its month-long duration.

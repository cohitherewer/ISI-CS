 Test in US, tutor in Bangalore

 - Education 

joins outsource list 

 Anytime tutorial: A call centre in Bangalore

 It was almost 3 am, and Alex Del Monte was cramming like crazy. But the George Washington University sophomore knew he would flunk his statistics exam later that day if he didnt call his tutor for help.

 But so late at night? Not a problem if your tutor works 8,500 miles away and nine-and-half hours ahead in Bangalore.

 In an hour-long session that cost just $18, the Indian tutor, who said his name was Mike, spent an hour walking Del Monte through such esoteric concepts as confidence intervals and alpha divisions. He got an A.

 Mike helped me unscramble everything in my mind, the 20-year-old said.

 Thousands of US students such as Del Monte are increasingly relying on overseas tutors to boost their grades. The tutors, who communicate over the Internet, are inexpensive and available round the clock, making education the newest industry to be outsourced to other countries.

 But it has sparked a fierce response from teachers and other critics, who argue that some companies are using unqualified overseas tutors to increase their profit margins. We dont believe that education should become a business of outsourcing, said Rob Weil, deputy director of educational issues at the American Federation of Teachers. 

 To 15-year-old Amita Achutuni, though, tutoring on the Net just makes sense. On a recent Monday afternoon, the Potomac resident logged into her home computer.

 Hi, Amita! a woman with an Indian accent said cheerfully.

 The voice belonged to Lekha Kamalasan, a $20-an-hour tutor who helps Amita with her geometry homework during twice-a-week, one-hour sessions, using an electronic white board and a copy of Amitas textbook.

 Amita is one of 400 students enrolled with Growing Stars, a California-based company whose 50 tutors, most of them with masters degrees, work in an office in Kochi. 

 The overseas tutors work hard to seem as American as possible. Kamalasan, who has masters degrees in business administration and mathematics, went through two weeks of accent reduction and cultural training. She learned for the first time about baseball and ice skating and had to memorise strange-sounding American holidays. 

 But Kamalasan, 33, doesnt mind because she makes $300 a month, double what she made as a high school teacher. This is a very good salary, she said.

 The US demand for overseas tutors is creating a thriving industry in Asia. When Studyloft.com, a Chicago-based tutoring company with over 6,000 clients, advertised in Bangalore, more than 500 people applied for 38 spots, according to Bikram Roy, the firms chief executive. There is just a huge hotbed of talent there in math and science, he said. India has the best tutors ? the best teachers ? in the world.

 But some tutoring companies worry that outsourcing could be bad for business. Its used as a pejorative weapon by our competitors, said Francesco Lecciso, a director of New York-based Brainfuse Online Tutoring. It is such a hot-button political issue.

 Weil said after-school tutors should be required to pass the same rigorous certification process as public school teachers. Quality control doesnt end at 3 clock when the school bell rings. But, Smith argues: This is no different than what happens in any industry. Labour gets stratified. And that leads to the democratisation of education, as the lower prices mean the rich and poor can access the same services.

 But when Alex Del Monte called up his Studyloft.com tutor, he didnt ponder any grand theories about outsourcing. He just wanted help. All I know is that the tutors name is Mike and that he helped me ace my test, he said.

 Actually, the tutors name is Mahakali Murthy. 

 Del Monte has used the service about every other week this semester and he vowed that he would finish his studying well before finals this month.

 But realistically, he laughed, Ill most likely be up again at 2 am, calling my Indian tutor for help.

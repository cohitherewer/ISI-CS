 Medha squirms at Uma visit

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 9: Medha Patkar had an unexpected visitor today ? Uma Bharti landed at the fasting social activists bedside late in the afternoon.

 However, the Narmada Bachao Andolan was none-too impressed; neither was Medha, who chose to make her statement of the day by demanding to be released from custody, which is how she chose to describe her enforced hospitalisation.

 The NBA leader, who was on indefinite fast to campaign for rehabilitating those displaced by the increase in the Sardar Sarovar dams height, was taken to hospital by police after doctors warned about her health.

 Uma said she had gone to enquire about Medhas well-being. I was there as a friend and a well-wisher, she said. The NBA accuses the former Madhya Pradesh chief minister of being callous to the dam-oustees demand.

 Medha was, in fact, hesitant to meet the sadhvi. Why are you here? Medha reportedly asked Uma. I dont agree with your communal politics.

 Uma insisted that she had not come to discuss politics. I have come only as a friend. Uma has publicly admired the NBA leader several times. Regardless of Umas views on the dam, she has always named Medha as a big political icon.

 But, Umas list of ideologues also fluctuates from time to time. During the run-up to the last Madhya Pradesh Assembly elections, Uma had listed Che Guevara, Hanumanji and Deen Dayal Upadhyay as her main inspirations, strictly in that order.

 France helping hand

 Vasco (Goa), April 3 (PTI): As India prepares to hold talks with the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), key member France today said it would help generate consensus for the Indo-US nuclear deal.

 French ambassador to India Dominique Girard, however, ruled out providing uranium till the 45-nation group flashes the green signal.

 He said his country was looking forward to industrial cooperation in the nuclear field with India in the backdrop of a recent joint statement issued by the two countries during President Jacques Chiracs visit.

 This (Indo-US nuclear agreement) is an excellent deal. We are quite happy with it, the envoy said.

 Girard is here to witness the week-long Indo-French naval exercises, called Varuna 6, off the Goa coast.

 Consensus in the NSG and its endorsement of the Indo-US deal is crucial for allowing key countries to resume nuclear trade with India. We will help in that as much as we can, the envoy promised.

 Girard noted that France has always advocated the need for civilian nuclear cooperation with India. 

 We feel India should have better access to civilian nuclear technology and materials because of its behaviour, because of its non-proliferation record and because it is a democracy.

 Tease protester dies

 New Delhi, March 25 (PTI): Meher Bhargava, shot at by four persons in Lucknow while trying to prevent a relative from being teased, died today.

 Bhargava, 50, the wife of senior Congress leader Luv Bhargava, died at 6.15 pm at Apollo hospital where she was admitted on February 28, a hospital spokesman said.

 She was shot at on February 20 outside Dalipur Towers, barely 100 metres from the Lucknow police superintendents office. She had reportedly protested when the four made lewd comments at her daughter-in-law. The accused were staying in an apartment belonging to K.D. Singh, a block pramukh of the Samajwadi Party.

 Kalam concern

 President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam has expressed concern over the practice of giving the benefit of doubt to accused on technical reasons of law.

 Inaugurating a regional seminar on narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, he said judges should take responsibility to ensure that both law and justice become convergent and point in the same direction.

 Although the President was talking specifically about drug-related cases under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, the statement is significant in the backdrop of a public outcry over accused persons getting the benefit of doubt and being absolved of charges.

 Kalam said statistics of drug-related cases showed there was a mismatch between arrests, prosecution and conviction with only 2,300 of the 19,000 people arrested in 2003 getting convicted.

 The President, however, made it clear it was not only the benefit of doubt that lowered the conviction rate. It could also be a result of wrong arrests or not having adequate evidence to establish guilt.

 To speed up the justice delivery system, Kalam suggested a study of 100 cases to find out the number of adjournments and the average time it has taken to settle the cases.

 This study may also throw light on how to speed up the judicial process, the President said, while addressing judges at the seminar organised by Delhi High Court and the Delhi government.

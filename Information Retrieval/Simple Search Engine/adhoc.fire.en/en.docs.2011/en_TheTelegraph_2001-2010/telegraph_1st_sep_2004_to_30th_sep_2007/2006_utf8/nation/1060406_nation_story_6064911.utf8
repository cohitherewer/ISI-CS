 Night swoop on Medha

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 5: Hundreds of policemen descended on the site of Medha Patkars fast late tonight, arrested her and stretchered her into an ambulance.

 Medha, whose condition had been rapidly deteriorating through the day, was taken to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, where she is expected to be force-fed. PTI quoted Delhi police sources as saying that Patkar has been held on the charge of attempt to commit suicide.

 Some of the protesters were dragged to the Parliament Street police station nearby amid chaos and slogan-shouting.

 Earlier, doctors had warned of kidney failure if Medha did not eat within 48 hours.

 The cabinet urged the ailing Narmada Bachao Andolan (NBA) leader to end her fast and told her that all-round efforts were on to reach an understanding on the rehabilitation of families displaced after the height of the Sardar Sarovar dam was raised.

 Around 30,000 families became homeless after Gujarats Narendra Modi government decided to raise the height of the dam. Some of the displaced villages are in Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra.

 Medha has alleged that the move was in violation of a Supreme Court ruling that no construction can take place on the dam till the government ensures a home for each displaced family.

 She said the Supreme Courts orders that rehabilitation efforts must start a year before construction and the government has to cross-check for six months if there are any displaced families left in the area have also been flouted.

 A delegation met Congress president Sonia Gandhi today. She was concerned about Medhas health. She said she would request the authorities concerned to take appropriate steps. But there has been no concrete assurance, lawyer Prashant Bhushan said.

 Government sources said Medha had agreed to break her fast after water resources minister Saifuddin Soz, social welfare minister Meira Kumar and minister of state in the Prime Ministers office Prithviraj Chavan promised to survey the area. 

 We had decided to halt the construction forthwith if there was even one family left to be rehabilitated, said a source.

 Medha has accused the Centre of lacking the courage to confront Modi. The Left has been piling pressure on the Centre to address her concerns. CPI leaders A.B. Bardhan, D. Raja and Amarjeet Kaur today joined Medhas sit-in.

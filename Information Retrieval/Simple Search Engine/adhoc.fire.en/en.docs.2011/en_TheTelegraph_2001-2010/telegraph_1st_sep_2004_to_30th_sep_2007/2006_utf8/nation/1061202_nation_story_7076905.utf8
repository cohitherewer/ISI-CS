 Rail men spy crack, run to stop train 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Durgapur 

 Dec. 1: Railway employees ran for about half a 

 kilometre to stop the Howrah-bound Doon Express waving red 

 flags this morning after having spotted a one-foot crack 

 on the tracks near here.

 A railway official said there could have been a major mishap had the train not been stopped.

 While approaching Mankar station, 135 km from Howrah, the Doon Express driver saw two gangmen who inspect railway tracks running towards the speeding train, and slammed the brakes. 

 The express had just left Panagarh around eight in the morning when the gangmen working on the Panagarh-Mankar stretch near Chandipur village noticed the crack. 

 They informed the Panagarh station manager and started running in the direction of the approaching train. It was stopped about half a kilometre from the crack. 

 Such a big crack can easily derail trains, said Anil Kumar, the additional divisional manager of the Eastern Railways Asansol division.

 The Howrah-bound Delhi-Kalka Mail, which was approaching Panagarh, was also stopped on its way after the Doon Express came to a halt. 

 Panagarh station manager M.L. Das said: Cracks are common during winter mornings. A big crack can be dangerous.

 Permanent way inspectors, who oversee railway tracks, and other officials rushed to the spot and the damaged track was replaced. Trains that were held up were allowed to pass through another line. 

 On Monday, a crack was detected on the Panagarh-Rajbandh stretch after the Howrah-Ranchi Satabdi Express had passed through it. 

 Kumar said: We are stepping up inspection of tracks. Gangmen will start checking the tracks in their areas from 10 pm every day and continue till 10 the following morning through the winter.

 Faster trains

 The Indian Railways may soon lose its slow tag with a new timetable coming into effect from today. 

 The zero-based time table will show reduced travel time after over 100 years.

 The railway board had decided that all trains will run on the new timetable, saving at least an hour for every passenger train.

 New Delhi, Nov. 18: After star Tibetan activist Tenzin Tsundue, its the turn of his fellow refugees in Delhi to be warned against protesting the visit of Chinese President Hu Jintao.

 Police notifications have told Tibetan exiles to maintain peace and behave themselves in the run-up to and during the November 21-23 trip.

 A few days ago, Tsundue, a protester with whom Indian authorities have had frequent run-ins during earlier visits by Chinese dignitaries, was banned from leaving his base in Dharamsala till Hu had taken a flight out of India.

 At Delhis Kamla Nagar police station, additional commissioner S.N. Tyagi confirmed the notifications but called them preventive action and in no way a threat.

 Our purpose is to maintain law and order during the dignitarys visit. We do that during the visit of any foreign head of state. Its nothing more.

 Tyagi conceded, though, that the police were being more cautious than usual.

 Tibetans blame Hu for several instances of human rights violations and disappearances during his tenure as the Communist Partys chief in the Tibet Autonomous Region between 1989 and 1993.

 The notifications, received by refugees in Majnu ka Tilla, Kamala Nagar and parts of Azadpur, mention no punishment for protesters, but the refugees have a different version.

 In Majnu ka Tilla, the largest refugee camp in the capital, residents said they had been warned of preventive detentions on the eve of Hus visit.

 We were told that any protester, not only those the police see as troublemakers, would be arrested. There must be no protests, said 58-year-old Norzing Thimbu.

 Tea stall owner Tenzin Chenmui wiped his brow with his Free Tibet T-shirt and asked, We are used by India and the West to pressure China on human rights violations. So why are we not allowed to protest against the Presidents visit?

 Even the most persistent protesters, such as Tsundue, seem to have reconciled themselves to the ban.

 Ive heard of the ban in Delhi, and I fail to understand what we Tibetans are supposed to do. Why cant we protest peacefully? he said over the phone from Dharamsala.

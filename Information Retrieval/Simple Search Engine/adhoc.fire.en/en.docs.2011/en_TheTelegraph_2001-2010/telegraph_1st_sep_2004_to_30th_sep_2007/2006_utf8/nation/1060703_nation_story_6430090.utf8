 Medical paper leak in Punjab 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Chandigarh, July 2: The Punjab pre-medical entrance test paper was found to have been leaked as Delhi and Punjab police detained 18 persons after raids. 

 The test, conducted by the Faridkot-based Baba Farid University of Health Sciences for admission to medical colleges in the state, was held today as scheduled after the questions were changed. 

 About 10,000 candidates appeared for the test.

 Five persons have been arrested, chief minister Amarinder Singh told reporters in Jalandhar. The police are probing the matter and more arrests are expected.

 Last night, assisted by their Delhi counterparts, Punjab police raided a place in Rohini where some students had gathered to memorise the leaked paper before leaving for Chandigarh to appear for the test. 

 Eighteen persons, including the middlemen, were detained. The students were let off after questioning.

 Last year, too, the paper had got leaked. 

 The vice-chancellor of Baba Farid University, Ravinder Singh, denied the leak last night, saying there was no question of a lapse. 

 Students who took the test today said they had not been informed of the leak. The raids took place in Delhi late last night and we received information only after reading the papers. Nobody from the varsity has informed us, Rajesh Gupta, a candidate, said.

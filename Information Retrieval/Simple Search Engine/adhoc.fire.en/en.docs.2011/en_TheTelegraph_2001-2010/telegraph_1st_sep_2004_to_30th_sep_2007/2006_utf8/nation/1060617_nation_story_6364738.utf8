 Bengal IT secy shifted

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, June 16: The Bengal government today effected a slew of changes in the ranks of its IAS officers. 

 The biggest among them was information technology secretary G.D. Gautamas transfer to cottage and small-scale industries and tourism, both ministries held by his former boss, Manab Mukherjee.

 Siddharth, who was on an assignment in Berlin, will replace Gautama.

 The information technology secretary had worked with Mukherjee for over three years. When Mukherjee took charge of both environment and IT before the Assembly polls, he brought Gautama in as environment secretary after Asim Burman went on deputation to the Damodar Velley Corporation (DVC). 

 After assuming his new charge, Mukherjee reportedly sought Gautama as his principal secretary again. 

 Among the others who were transferred are urban development secretary Nandita Chatterjee, who has been moved to the school education department. Chatterjee will replace Debaditya Chakraborty, who has gone on compulsory waiting. 

 P.K. Pradhan, who has returned from a central government deputation, will assume charge of the municipal affairs and urban development departments. Labour secretary Ashok Mohan Chakraborty has been shifted to higher education. Animal resources secretary Subesh Das will take his place. Das will be replaced by Meera Pande, who held charge of cottage and small-scale industries. 

 M.L. Meena has been posted as environment secretary, while C.R. Das, the district election officer in charge of Calcutta North, will become the Malda district magistrate.

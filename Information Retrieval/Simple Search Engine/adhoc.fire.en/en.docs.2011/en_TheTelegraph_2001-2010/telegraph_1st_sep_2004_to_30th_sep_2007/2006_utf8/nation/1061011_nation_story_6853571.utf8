 Nepal rebel on road to Bengal

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chennai, Oct. 10: The decks were today cleared for Nepalese Maoist leader Chandra Prakash Gajurels passage to Bengal after a three-week legal tussle.

 Gajurel is likely to be taken to Calcutta tomorrow on way to Jalpaiguri to face charges of waging an armed struggle against the Government of India and the Bengal government.

 He was arrested by a north Bengal police team in the case registered at Bhakti Nagar police station in Siliguri in May 2004 minutes after he walked out of a Chennai jail on September 18 after serving two years in a fake passport case.

 The re-arrest set off a chain of petitions and counter-petitions that have confined Gajurel to the same jail so far. Yesterday, a court had issued a prisoner-on-transit warrant allowing him to be taken to Bengal.

 Madras High Court today set the ball rolling when it dismissed Gajurels revision petition saying there were no grounds to issue a transit warrant against him and that he should not be kept in further confinement without a valid remand order.

 I do not find any merit to set aside the order passed by the chief metropolitan magistrate, Justice R. Raghupathy of Madras High Court ruled today, adding Bengal police were at liberty to execute their warrant.

 Gajurels transit warrant was issued 10 days after a high court division bench closed a habeas corpus petition challenging Bengal polices action of re-arresting him and dismissed a 2003 petition against his deportation to Nepal.

 The division bench reverted the transit warrant issue to the chief metropolitan magistrates court and directed it to depute an officer of DSP rank to escort Gajurel as he feared serious danger to his life.

 Accordingly, the DSP of Tamil Nadu Q Branch police, S. Maheswaran, was today asked to accompany Gajurel to Bengal.

 The court also dismissed Gajurels petition seeking a writ of mandamus to prevent his deportation to Nepal without following procedures under the extradition act. If Gajurel had any grievance about his re-arrest, he could move a Bengal court, the bench said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Superpower? Oh no, were Indians

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 No illusions, please: Sonia Gandhi at the leadership 

 summit in New Delhi. (PTI)

 New Delhi, Nov. 17: When 

 the countrys two most powerful persons sit together 

 to chart Indias future, one vision never crosses their 

 mind.

 Neither Sonia Gandhi nor Manmohan Singh wish to see India become a superpower.

 The very word makes her somewhat uneasy, evoking as it does images of hegemony, of aggression, of power politics, of military might, of division and conflict, Sonia today told the Hindustan Times Leadership Summit on India: the next global superpower?

 Instead, the Congress pre-sident spoke of how, during long periods in the past, India had exercised a profound influence on the course of world history without any kind of overt power.

 We Indians have always known our place in the world even when the world was treating us lightly. Consider how Gandhiji, mocked as a half-naked fakir by the British, took on the superpower of the day through the mere force of his values and ideas, Sonia said.

 My mother-in-law Indira Gandhi was once amused by an episode in a Peter Sellers comedy, The Party, in which he plays the part of an Indian. Ticked off by his hostess with Who do you think you are, Mr Bakshi? Seller responds: Madam, in India we dont think who we are; we know who we are.

 To Prime Minister Singh, the concept superpower will grow irrelevant as prosperity spreads, as people and communities get increasingly empowered to manage the affairs of their nations, as the economic and technological gap between nations narrows as nations become more interdependent.

 When this happens, we would have to move to a world where nations act together, in concert to address the major concerns of the times.

 In this rule-based world... power as traditionally understood may become less relevant in international affairs and the concept of a superpower, as we generally understand it, even less so.

 Sonias message was that rather than think of itself as a global superpower, the nation must work to become a global force for peace, progress and prosperity.

 She said pre-eminence will not come from a higher GDP alone.

 It will depend crucially on how fast we expand productive employment opportunities, achieve universal literacy and improve the quality of primary health care.

 For Sonia, the remarkable success stories in urban and rural India Indian companies holding their own against competition, womens self-help groups and the lakhs of educated youths from the weaker sections ought not to conjure up false illusions of grandeur and power.

 They should not wrap us in a cocoon of self-satisfaction, a mayajaal which cuts us off from the day-to-day lives of the vast majority.

 That led to the punch line: it wasnt just equality that counted but what mattered more was equality at home.

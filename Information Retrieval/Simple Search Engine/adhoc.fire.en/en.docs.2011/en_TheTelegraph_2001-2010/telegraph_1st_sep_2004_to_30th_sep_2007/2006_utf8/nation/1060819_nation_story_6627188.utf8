 Tax noose hangs over handis heavy with cash

 SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI

 Mumbai, Aug. 18: The innocuous dahi handi (pot of curd), thousands of which are broken by human pyramids on Janmashtami every year, has come under the taxmans glare.

 The test of machismo for Mumbais youngsters has turned into a show of money power, with wads of notes, given as prizes to groups who break the handis, stuffed in the pots.

 Suspended from a height of 40 to 50 feet with ropes hung between buildings, handis are an integral part of Janmashtami Krishnas birthday. Boys climb on each other to form a pyramid, and the one who reaches the pinnacle smashes the handi.

 Politicians have been using the ritual to court young supporters with cash. With only a few months to go for the Mumbai and Pune municipal elections, all parties lapped up the opportunity on Janmashtami this year on Wednesday raising the income-tax departments suspicions.

 Sponsors of dahi handis in Pune, Mumbai, Nagpur and Kolhapur who offered a prize of over Rs 50,000 will come under the scanner. 

 The decision has been taken by the department as part of our move to crack down on unaccounted assets. This is the first time such an exercise is being carried out by the income-tax department, said the chief commissioner of income-tax, Pune, S.K. Sharma.

 It is tough to know how much money is there in these handis for sure. We do, however, know that in most cases, they are a neat sum that has in some way evaded the tax net. But because of religious sentiments involved, we are instructed to go easy on such inquiries, said a senior official of the Income Tax Commission, Mumbai.

 This year, the prize money stashed in the 5,000 handis dotting Mumbai, broke all records with over Rs 10 crore at stake, according to unconfirmed reports.

 Sources in tax offices across Maharashtra confirmed that discreet inquiries have already begun. 

 IT investigators across the state are currently in the process of collecting information, which will be used to verify the source of earnings of the funders. They will also check whether the recipients of the cash prize, which is equally distributed among the participating youths, also fall in the tax net, said A.J. Khan, the director (investigations) of the tax commission, Pune.

 The groups that participate in the ritual are crying foul. They alleged that politicians sponsoring dahi handis often do not give the full prize money. 

 Ganesh Talwalkar of the Mazgaon Mandal, which broke the Sanjay Nirupam-sponsored Rs 8-lakh handi, says he and his group members got only Rs 2 lakh.

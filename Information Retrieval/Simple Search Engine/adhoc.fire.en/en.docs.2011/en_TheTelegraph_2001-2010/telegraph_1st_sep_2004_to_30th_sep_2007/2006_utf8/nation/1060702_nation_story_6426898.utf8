 Cash, but no loan waiver

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Nagpur, July 1: The Prime Ministers healing touch for Vidarbhas crisis-ridden farmers translated into some hard cash today, but it didnt meet their chief demands ? a waiver of all loans and an increased minimum support price for cotton.

 Left with a deep impression at the end of his two-day visit to the farmer suicide zone, Manmohan Singh announced a Rs 3,750-crore package for the regions six districts, including a Rs 2,177-crore aid for irrigation.

 The farmers have got a waiver of all outstanding interest till June 30, 2006 ? which comes to Rs 712 crore ? and the option of staggered loan repayment.

 I had an opportunity to interact with families and widows of farmers who had committed suicides and also heard many farmers who were in acute distress. The interaction has left a deep impression on my mind, the Prime Minister, who met over 100 farmers in three districts, said.

 He promised steps to ensure that farmers dont fall into the clutches of moneylenders and their extortionary interest rates anywhere in India. 

 As immediate aid for the suicide-hit families ? over 600 farmers have killed themselves in the past one year ? he announced a Rs 50-lakh grant from the Prime Ministers National Relief Fund.

 The immediate priority must be to restart the process of credit flow so that farmers can resume normal agricultural activities and obtain regular livelihood, Singh said, flanked by Union agriculture minister Sharad Pawar and chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh.

 He said special teams from Nabard and other leading banks would ensure an additional credit flow of Rs 1,275 crore to the six districts in 2006-07.

 The interest waiver, which makes the farmers eligible for fresh bank loans, will be borne equally by the Centre and the state. 

 The farmers can repay their current loans over a three-to-five-year period with a one-year moratorium. The total repayment will amount to Rs 1,300 crore. 

 Pawar said a similar package would be awarded to farmers in 18 districts of Andhra Pradesh, six of Karnataka and three of Kerala.

 Singh promised to set up an expert group to study how farmers were being crushed under their debts across the country, and ask it to come up with suggestions within three months. We need to treat this as a national problem, and address it on a war footing.

 Singh promised to personally monitor how the package was being put into effect, and to set up a cell in the PMO to cut through red tape.

 As for the demand to raise the minimum support price for cotton from Rs 1,740 per quintal to Rs 3,000 or more, he said he would discuss it with the government commission that fixes the price.

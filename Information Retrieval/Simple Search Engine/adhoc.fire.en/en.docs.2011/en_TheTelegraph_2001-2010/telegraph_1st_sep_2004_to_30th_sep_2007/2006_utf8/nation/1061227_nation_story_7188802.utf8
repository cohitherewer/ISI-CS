 Navy help

 New Delhi, Dec. 26: Russian arms company Rosoboronexport has offered post-guarantee service facilities for the Indian Navys three Talwar- class frigates, the most sophisticated warships in the force.

 The Russians built the frigates for the navy but their guarantee has expired. 

 Last week, a delegation of Russian defence equipment manufacturers was in Delhi to discuss the issue.

 Rosoboronexport will provide the servicing facilities at Baltitsky shipyard in St Petersburg, where the frigates were built. 

 India will depend on the Russian facilities to service its ships as there is no such facility available at home.

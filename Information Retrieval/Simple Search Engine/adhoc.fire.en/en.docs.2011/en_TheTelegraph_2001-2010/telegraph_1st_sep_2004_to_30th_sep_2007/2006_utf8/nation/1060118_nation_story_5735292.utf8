 Dilemmas on Cong agenda

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 New Delhi, Jan. 17: The resolutions the Congress will debate and adopt at the Hyderabad plenary are expected to reflect the dilemmas it faces in coalition politics and unveil its mandate for the government.

 The political resolution, drafted by a sub-committee headed by HRD minister Arjun Singh, would articulate Congress concerns about its gradually shrinking base in former strongholds like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, sources said.

 It would then question if this was because of the ascendancy of casteist and communal forces, both regional and national, and the Congress compulsion to strike alliances with regional parties.

 The sources, however, clarified the resolution would not criticise coalition politics or even suggest the Congress could shake off its allies.

 The thrust will be on looking at the long-term goal of returning to power on our own but that does not imply we will turn our back on coalition politics, a senior official said.

 The political resolution is likely to do a tightrope walk between having alliances and going solo and juxtapose the example of Kerala ? where the coalition has worked to the Congresss advantage ? with Bihar, where it was reduced to a minor partner in the Assembly poll.

 The economic resolution, prepared by a sub-committee headed by Veerappa Moily, would iterate the slogan of reforms with a human face.

 We will elaborate on it and ensure it does not remain rhetorical, a source said.

 The Congress recognised that since the government was led by Manmohan Singh ? credited as the harbinger of liberalisation ? it could not, like the Left, allow its criticism to overshadow economic achievements in the forex and infrastructure sectors.

 The sources said the resolution would unveil an economic mandate for the Centre and sharpen the focus of tricky areas like reforms and public sector divestment.

 Money? Not for me, honey 

 - Ash and cash in cover

 Aishwarya: Playing safe

 Money isnt always welcome, Aishwarya Rai will tell you. Especially when it comes in the mail, and customs sniffs it out first.

 The actress has been sent a parcel containing 23,000 euros by someone in the Netherlands. It arrived in Mumbai last month but Ash is not even looking.

 The package was received nearly a month ago. We sent her a notice, but Rai did not respond. This week, we have sent a second notice, and hope to record her statement, A.K. Prasad, commissioner of customs (import), said.

 Receiving more than Rs 5,000 in cash is an offence under the law with a maximum punishment of three years in prison. What the parcel from the mystery sender contains is considerably more around Rs 13 lakh. No surprise then that Aishwarya, who at Rs 2 crore a film is Bollywoods highest paid actress, is keeping safe distance. 

 Her lawyer Girish Kulkarni said: My client has no connection with this parcel. We have not received a notice from customs. We will cooperate with them whenever asked to.

 No case for foreign exchange violations has been lodged yet, Prasad said. We have been investigating the case, but I cannot disclose what the probe has shown. We need to record Rais statement before we lodge any case.

 But Aishwarya who has survived Salman Khan and other controversies without breaking her silence is not talking. Nor is her secretary.

 Customs officials said the first notice had been sent to secretary Hari Singh, but he claimed ignorance. Singh later refused to answer calls.

 Soon, he might have to squeeze out time from Ashs busy schedule shes shooting in Jaipur with Hrithik Roshan now for Ashutosh Gowarikers Jodha Akbar for an interview with the customs department.

 Customs officials said it is possible that a fan sent her the cash to attract attention or that the money posted to the Khar address where her parents live not the new Bandra residence where she has Sachin Tendulkar as neighbour is legitimate payment for a show. But she needs to come and answer their questions.

 Ash, who plays a petty thief in Dhoom-2, might find it easier to dodge the cops on screen than customs officials determined to get her to speak. 

 The one time that Aishwarya has broken her silence was when she refused to pay the newly-imposed 0.25 per cent stamp duty on brand endorsement and film agreements, sources in the Collectorate of Stamps said. 

 When we sent her a notice to pay the stamp duty, she wrote back saying we should approach the respective companies who signed her, a senior stamps official said.

 She might not want to pay duty, but Ash is among Bollywoods top tax-payers, alongside Shah Rukh Khan and Amitabh Bachchan. In 2005, she is said to have paid Rs 4 crore in income-tax.

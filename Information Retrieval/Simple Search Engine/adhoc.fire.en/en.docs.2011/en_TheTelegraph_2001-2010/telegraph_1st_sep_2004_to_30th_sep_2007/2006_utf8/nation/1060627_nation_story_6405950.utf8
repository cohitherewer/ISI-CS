 Delhi seeks SC role in UP tussle

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 26: The Centre today moved the Supreme Court to bring an end to the confrontation between Allahabad High Court and Uttar Pradesh governor T.V. Rajeshwar over transfer of the Raj Bhavan additional legal adviser.

 While the high court has ordered the transfer of Pradeep Dubey, Raj Bhavan is refusing to comply on the ground that the concurrence of the governor in such matters was mandatory.

 The Centre today sought an urgent hearing of its petition. 

 It seems to be a clash of egos, the apex courts vacation bench headed by Justice A.R. Lakshmanan said, while directing the registry to list the petition for hearing tomorrow if there were no defects.

 After the governor ignored Dubeys transfer order, the high court suspended him. But Dubey ? who has been additional legal adviser for the past 12 years ? continued to hold the office as the Raj Bhavan cancelled the suspension order.

 The Mulayam Singh government had appointed Vijay Verma to replace Dubey but he could not take charge. 

 On Friday, Allahabad High Court reiterated its directive on Dubeys transfer and declared as inoperative all orders by the Raj Bhavan secretariat pertaining to the cancellation of the legal officers suspension.

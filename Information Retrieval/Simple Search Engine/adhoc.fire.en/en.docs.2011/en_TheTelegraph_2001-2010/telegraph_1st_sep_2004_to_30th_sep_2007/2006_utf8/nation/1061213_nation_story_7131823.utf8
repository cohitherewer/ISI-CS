 Single window for Tata approvals

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta, Dec. 12: The Bengal government today opened a single window for Tata Motors to handle issues such as supply of water and power and environmental clearance to the proposed small-car unit in Singur.

 Officials of the departments concerned the electricity board, the Calcutta Metropolitan Water and Sanitation Authority and the state pollution control board met Tata Motors representatives at the office of the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation (WBIDC) near BBD Bag so that they did not have to visit the respective offices before starting work on the factory.

 Two teams from Tata Motors are expected to visit Singur this week for the first time after the government acquired and fenced the land. An engineering team will survey the land while a community development group is expected to meet villagers there.

 The meeting at the WBIDC was attended by commerce and industries secretary Sabyasachi Sen and the corporations managing director Debashish Som.

 The WBIDC made this arrangement solely to avoid any inconvenience to Tata officials. At the meeting, issues like availability of water and power for the project were discussed threadbare. The representatives were also briefed about environment-related clearances which are mandatory for setting up a factory, Sen said.

 The Tata representatives had gone to Belur Math yesterday where a community-training programme is being carried out by the Belur Math Shilpa Mandir, a centre for vocational training. 

 Sen said the government would maintain absolute transparency on the incentive package that would be offered to the Tatas.

 The government said it would make sure that the land acquired in Singur is used only for the Tata project. The government will follow this policy for other new units, too.

 Under the lease agreement, besides the factory, the Tatas can construct an administrative building and a guesthouse. But quarters or residential complexes cannot be built on the allotted land.

 The government will now meet around 10 ancillary units to discuss their requirements.

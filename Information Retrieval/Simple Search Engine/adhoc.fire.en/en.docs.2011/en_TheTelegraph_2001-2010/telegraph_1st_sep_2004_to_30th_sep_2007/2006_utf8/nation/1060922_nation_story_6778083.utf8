 Revenge for riots, says convict

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Sept. 21: The anti-terror court trying the 1993 blasts case today convicted accused no. 12 Pervez Nazir Ahmed Shaikh on charges of planting bombs in Katha Bazaar in south-central Mumbai and Hotel Sea Rock in Bandra in the western suburbs.

 Judge Pramod Kode found Shaikh, the ninth person to be convicted so far, guilty on 17 counts, including planting bombs and landing explosives, under various sections of the Indian Penal Code, the anti-terror act (Tada), Explosives Act and the Explosives Substances Act.

 Shaikh was accused of riding an RDX-packed scooter and parking it near a building in Katha Bazaar. The explosion killed four, injured 21 and destroyed property worth Rs 37 crore.

 He was also accused of planting a suitcase filled with RDX in Room No. 1840 of Hotel Sea Rock. The blast here did not kill anyone but destroyed property worth Rs 9 crore.

 Arrested on March 20 eight days after the serial blasts that killed 257 people the Andheri cloth hawker had said in his confession that he suffered huge losses during the Mumbai riots that preceded the blasts and took part in the conspiracy for revenge.

 He also said he first travelled to Sea Rock to plant the suitcase and returned with the room keys to Al-Hussaini, the residence of the Memon family, four of whom have been convicted. He was then sent to Katha Bazaar with the RDX-filled scooter.

 The scooter exploded at 2.15 pm, 45 minutes after the first blast at the Bombay Stock Exchange. In Sea Rock, the suitcase went off at 3.10.

 The judge said the charge that Shaikh underwent arms training in Raigad district could not be established. He also found him not guilty of the charge of transporting weapons before the March 12 bombings.

 But Shaikhs conviction under Section 3 (2) (i)(ii) of Tada means he faces the maximum punishment death.

 Kode later recorded the statement of Abdul Gani Ismail Turk, who was convicted on Tuesday for the Century Bazaar bombing.

 The 48-year-old pleaded for a lenient sentence, saying he needed to support his 80-year-old mother and two unmarried daughters. I am not a terrorist. I was dragged into this, the former driver of prime accused Tiger Memon said.

 Turk also questioned why those found guilty by the Srikrishna commission, which probed the Mumbai riots of 1992-93, have not been brought to book.

 Those found guilty by the commission should be punished, he said, recalling the horror of the communal carnage that followed the demolition of the Babri Masjid in Ayodhya.

 No one listened to our pleas. We were helpless, he added.

 Turk tried to justify the blasts by saying they were a reaction to the mosques demolition and the riots that killed 900 people.

 Last week, Yakub Memon, one of the convicted Memon brothers, had called for breaking the cycle of violence, and demanded that those found guilty by the Srikrishna panel be punished first.

 Two others, Asghar Mukadam and Shahnawaz Qureshi, also blamed the Mumbai riots for their involvement in the blast conspiracy.

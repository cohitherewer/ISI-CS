 Out of prison, heroin king rebuilds empire

 Lucknow, Dec. 10: When the gates of Presidency Jail opened on a cloudy morning three years ago to let out a man in his early forties, no one would have paid much attention. It was just another convict stepping out to freedom after serving his term.

 Except that Triveni Singh was not just another convict.

 The release of north Indias narcotics king from the Calcutta jail has revived trafficking in indigenous heroin from the heartland to Bengal and the rest of eastern India.

 While smuggled heroin from Afghanistan feeds the party drugs set in the big cities, Triveni and his tribe rule the narcotics scene in the small towns.

 In their makeshift laboratories in Madhya Pradeshs Neemuch and the Uttar Pradesh districts of Barabanki and Lucknow, they turn Indian-grown opium into heroin and channel it through a route that extends to Nepal.

 The illegal business had suffered setbacks in the years after Trivenis arrest in Asansol in 1992 that led to a 10-year jail term the following year. By 1999, officials say, the trade had almost died down.

 But the scene changed after Triveni took a train from Calcutta to Lucknow in August 2003 and built his new laboratory at his home in the towns Nai Basti area.

 It seems the old Lucknow-Ghazipur-Varanasi-Kolkata smuggling route is being revived by the old operators from Uttar Pradesh. The route has links with Nepal and Pakistan, said Utkarsh Tiwari, deputy narcotic commissioner, Lucknow.

 Tiwaris office has recorded 30 narcotics seizures and 34 arrests in the past one year. Triveni himself was arrested again last October, but the trade continues.

 When they picked Triveni up from his home, Narcotics Control Bureau officials were struck by his laboratory.

 The officials seized 2.6 kg of morphine along with bottles of acetic chloride, sodium carbonate and acetic anhydride, a tub and lengths of filter cloth known as chhanana that are used to manufacture heroin from morphine.

 The morphine was kept in a briefcase with a false bottom, which came in handy while transporting drugs, possibly on trains, Tiwari said.

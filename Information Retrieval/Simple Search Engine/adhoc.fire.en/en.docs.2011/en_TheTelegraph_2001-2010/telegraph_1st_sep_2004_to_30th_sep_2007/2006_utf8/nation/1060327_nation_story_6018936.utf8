 CPMs dilemma: party grows, not new leaders

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, March 26: Even as Anil Biswas was struggling for his life in hospital, the CPM decided that Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and Biman Bose would steer the party in the run-up to the elections. 

 The decision was predictable and caused no surprise to either party supporters or the people at large. 

 General secretary Prakash Karats announcement of the decision within a couple of days of Biswas falling critically ill was meant to do two things. It aimed at reassuring the shocked cadre that there was no cause for confusion, let alone alarm, over a smooth leadership transition. There would be no surprises, no need for speculation about out-of-turn promotions for any particular leader or group. 

 Bose, the Left Front chairman and the senior-most leader (if one leaves out ageing or ailing leaders like Jyoti Basu, Benoy Konar and Chittabrata Majumdar), was the obvious choice as Biswass successor, at least for now. 

 Bhattacharjees induction in party work was meant to carry two messages ? one for the cadre and the other for the people. The chief minister remains the partys ? and the fronts ? USP for the polls. So, his partnership with Bose in running the party was a signal that the government and the party would work in tandem. 

 Such messages were meant to clear the air before the polls. However, the big challenge for the CPM may come after the elections. 

 An earlier generation of CPM leaders groomed a younger lot to whom the baton was to be passed. Thus, while Promode Dasgupta and Basu worked as the twin pillars of the party in the sixties and the seventies, a younger team, comprising Biswas, Bhattacharjee, Bose and Shyamal Chakraborty, now president of the Citus Bengal unit, was learning the ropes under the watchful eyes of the older leaders. 

 But, once these Young Turks took over, they do not seem to have been as careful in building the next generation of leaders. 

 Ironically, there was some greening of the CPM at the level of central leadership, as was evident in Karat, his wife Brinda and Sitaram Yechury becoming the most prominent politburo members. In Bengal, though, a new crop of leaders does not seem to be in place.

 Left leaders have an explanation for this. They say the earlier leaders were products of the mass movements of the sixties and the seventies, just as the generation of Basu and Dasgupta was the product of two preceding decades of popular politics. The young leaders of the CPM are handicapped in so far as they grew up only seeing the party in power. 

 The other aspect of the problem is that the growth of the party makes it a different organisation from what it was during Dasguptas time. 

 As the party grew in size (its present membership in Bengal is more than 700,000 and its mass organisations have nearly 4 million members), it faced the need for decentralisation as never before. New leaders would have to deal with this problem, too.

 But then, the dearth of new leadership is a problem that all the major parties in Bengal face in varying degrees. The Congress has not had a new generation of leaders since the rise of Priya Ranjan Das Munshi and Subrata Mukherjee. Somen Mitra, too, belongs to an earlier generation. 

 The Trinamul Congress, of course, is all Mamata Banerjee and she has little interest in anyone elses leadership abilities. 

 That really is the big challenge for the CPM hereafter. Before Biswas fell ill, the partys poll machinery was more or less in place. And, all these years have made the electoral organisation familiar stuff for the party. Building and managing the party is a more complicated affair that new leaders have to be trained for. 

 Biswass death could be a signal that the CPM cannot delay the task of leader-building any further.

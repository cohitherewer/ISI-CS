 Arjun thorn in Cong flesh

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 New Delhi, May 26: Arjun Singh has turned a gale ki haddi for the government and the Congress, a bone they can neither spit out nor swallow. So claim the partys upper caste members.

 Not exactly, say those from the backward classes as well as the Dalits.

 But with neither the Prime Minister nor Sonia Gandhi having expressed a definite position on reservation, both camps are confused.

 Congress headquarters is abuzz with speculation whether the human resource development ministers project had Sonias support, or if it was a solo act meant to embarrass her and the Prime Minister.

 Or, perhaps, it was part of a larger game plan to engineer a show of dissidence against the Prime Minister and force Sonia to consider a change of guard?

 With Sonia keeping mum and Manmohan trying hard to stick to the middle ground and retain the goodwill he is said to enjoy among the upper and middle classes, Arjun has been persisting with his one-point mission. Namely, to prove he wasnt alone in the quota initiative.

 Both the Prime Minister and Sonia Gandhi have contributed significantly to this issue, he said yesterday.

 The Congresss upper-caste lobby would love to see Arjun booted out of the cabinet.

 We have a new slogan, Congress ka haath, walking stick ke saath (the Congresss hand is guided by a walking stick), a senior leader quipped, in a cruel reference to the support the HRD minister uses.

 Amid a ripple of speculation that he would be punished ? packed off as a governor or, at least, stripped of the higher education portfolio in the next reshuffle ? Arjun sympathisers claimed he was stronger than ever.

 They believe he has finally succeeded in what he had been trying to do for two years: chip away at Manmohans image.

 The Congress hasnt worked out its gains and losses fully yet but there is agreement that Manmohan and his government have lost some of the credibility and goodwill they had acquired among urban opinion-makers.

 Yet, a source conceded, it wasnt easy to wish away Arjun. He recalled that in 1985, at a time Arjun seemed invincible as Madhya Pradesh chief minister, he was suddenly packed off to Punjab as governor. Rajiv Gandhis move was seen as comeuppance for Arjun, who had a habit of encouraging factionalism.

 History judged otherwise. He was picked by Rajiv to sign the historic Longowal peace accord and was rewarded with a Union cabinet post, becoming the first governor to return as a minister, the source said.

 But Arjuns sympathisers dismiss the theory that he had plotted to dislodge the Prime Minister and install himself with the help of the pro-backward allies and the Congresss OBC members. At best, they say, he would stay on as HRD minister till he pulls out his next card.

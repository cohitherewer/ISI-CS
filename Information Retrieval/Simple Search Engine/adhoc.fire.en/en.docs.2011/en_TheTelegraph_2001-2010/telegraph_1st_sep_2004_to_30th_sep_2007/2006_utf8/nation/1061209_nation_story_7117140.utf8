 Lucknow varsity shut

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, 

 Dec. 8: Lucknow University has been closed indefinitely 

 following campus violence yesterday over implementation 

 of the Lyngdoh Committee recommendations for union elections.

 The university authorities have also decided not to hold the elections this year after student leaders affiliated to the Samajwadi Party refused to accept the code of conduct drawn up on the basis of the Lyngdoh report. 

 A delegation of teachers led by vice-chancellor R.P. Singh met governor T.V. Rajeswar today. We will remain closed indefinitely in view of the recurring violence on campus. The poll has been put off too. In fact, this year there will be no poll at all, Singh said after the meeting. 

 The students had not only gone on a rampage on the university campus, but had looted shops outside in the Hazratganj area. They also staged protests, prompting a police lathi-charge. 

 The vice-chancellor said the state government is not helping maintain law and order on campus. Unless that is done, nothing can be done not even academic activities on campus.

 The new code bars students with a criminal record from contesting elections. If it is implemented, at least 80 student leaders would be disqualified, most of them affiliated to the Samajwadis. 

 Pawan Pandey, a student leader, is one of them. With criminal cases against him, Pandey has been granted police protection by the Mulayam Singh government and stalks the campus with his bodyguard.

 Challenging the vice-chancellors decision to implement the Lyngdoh recommendations and describing him as a tyrant and an autocrat, he asks: Why does the V-C need 50 PACs and five gunners, I want to know. 

 Government has given gunners to many students. This is wrong as they use it for extortion and threat. Its difficult to maintain peace if students with gunmen strut around the campus intimidating others, Singh said. 

 The teachers said the governor had recently expressed concern over this issue. 

 DGP Bua Singhs office said bodyguards were assigned to people who had filed applications to the home department. The students who were allowed gunners got them on the basis of threats perceived by them. They are all private gunners for which the students have to pay, the office said.

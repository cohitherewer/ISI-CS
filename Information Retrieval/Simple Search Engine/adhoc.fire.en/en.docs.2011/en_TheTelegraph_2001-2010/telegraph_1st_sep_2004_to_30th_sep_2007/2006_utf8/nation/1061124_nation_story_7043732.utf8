The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Step forward on border

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 23: Chinese President Hu Jintao may have talked about turning the India-China boundary into a bond of good neighbourliness, but Delhi has not lost sight of the reality that the dispute is nowhere near being resolved.

 India is satisfied, though, that Beijing has made resolution of the boundary dispute a strategic objective and sees this as a movement forward.

 Describing Hus visit as an important step in India-China relations, officials said the ties are still difficult and complex but there cannot be progress if one is stuck in complexities.

 The special representatives national security adviser M.K. Narayanan and Chinese vice-foreign minister Dai Binggou have started the process of working out dates for their next meeting. 

 The two officials were asked by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and the Chinese President to meet as early as possible. Both sides have exchanged dates. 

 In the joint declaration, both leaders had sought the revival of the joint working group to expedite the work on clarification and confirmation of the Line of Actual Control. 

 The group has not met after the two sides failed to exchange maps on all the three sectors of the boundary. Now, the joint working group has been asked to complete exchanging maps indicating their respective perceptions of the alignment of the LAC on the basis of agreed parameters. The maps exchanged so far by the two sides have serious differences.

 The Chinese delegation also made a strong pitch for improving trade ties and called for market economy status for Beijing. But Delhi said this would not be possible at the moment. 

 Hu, who reached Pakistan today in a visit expected to cement ties with Beijings long-time ally, also indirectly raised the question of removing impediments in foreign direct investment.

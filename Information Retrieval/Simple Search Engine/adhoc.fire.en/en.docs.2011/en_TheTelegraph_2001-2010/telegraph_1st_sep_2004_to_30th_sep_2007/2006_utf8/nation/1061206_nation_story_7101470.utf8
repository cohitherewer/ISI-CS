 Agra, Dec. 5: The Taj Mahals appeal and symbolism of love could put it on a new list of the seven wonders of the world, an organisation involved in promotion of monuments said today.

 Bernard Weber, founder of New7Wonders, and five of his team were in Agra today, trying to whip up enthusiasm for the new list to be announced by the Swiss organisation next year. Their plans had included floating a big balloon over the city, but weather conditions didnt quite permit that.

 The Taj was not around when the list of the original seven wonders of the ancient world was drawn up. Also, the compilers had a very narrow worldview everything worth seeing was around the Mediterranean.

 Moreover, the ancients didnt have the Internet. The new list will be based on votes monuments get from all over the world through the Internet, phone calls and SMSes.

 Over the last five years, some 23 million people have cast their vote for their favourite monuments out of the 200 put up on new7wondersoftheworld.com.

 Experts roped in by the Geneva-based non-profit organisation then reviewed 77 top cited sites and came up with a shortlist of 21 which includes the Acropolis in Athens, Angkor Wat in Cambodia, the Statue of Liberty off New York, the Great Wall of China, the Eiffel Tower in Paris, the Timbuktu monuments in Mali, the Kremlin in Moscow, the Stonehenge in England and the Sydney Opera House.

 Going by the fresh round of voting, which began at the beginning of this year, the Taj Mahal ranks among the top seven. Taj-lovers hope the trend will hold till July 7, 2007, when the new list is announced in Lisbon. 

 The Taj has a very good chance because of its universal appeal and symbolism of love, Weber says.

 So is it a fair way of putting together a list which just might get into school textbooks?

 After all the organisation, which specialises in the preservation, restoration and promotion of monuments, is private it has just the goodwill of Unesco and gets its money through donations and promotional deals with companies.

 And should SMS messages determine what is be classified among the top man-made structures in the world? Wont a lot of people be voting out of patriotism? Dont countries with more Internet connections have an advantage?

 It is not perfect, I am willing to say that, admits spokesperson Tia B. Viering. But then, it is about a good cause making people take pride in their global heritage.

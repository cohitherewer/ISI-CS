The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Nation at a Glance

 Impaired topper awaits IAS call

 New Delhi (PTI): 

 Mani Ram Sharma was the topper in the hearing impaired category 

 of those selected for civil services in 2005 but was disappointed 

 when he was relegated to the Post and Telegraph Finance 

 Accounts Service.

 Sharma qualified in the exams 

 with a rank of 378. A few other hearing impaired candidates 

 who had lower ranks have been absorbed in the IAS and the 

 IFS, claims the Disability Rights Group, an advocacy organisation 

 working for the rights of the disabled.

 By not giving Mani Ram Sharma his rightful due, for which he has qualified on merit, the department of personnel and training is obviously passing a judgement on the capacity and the capability of a deaf person, said the groups convener Javed Abidi.

 The saddest part is that he had qualified in 2004 as well but was turned down on the ground that he is not physically fit for any service, he added.

 Chinkara hunter shot dead

 Jaipur (PTI): 

 A hunter was killed and another 

 injured as police chased them after they shot chinkaras 

 in a village in Bikaner district of Rajasthan on Saturday.

 Seven chinkaras were found dead 

 near the place where the hunter was killed, district police 

 chief Ashok Rathore said. 

 Four others fled before the police reached the spot.

 Blow to Salem

 Azamgarh (PTI): In a jolt to Abu 

 Salems dreams of representing the Uttar Pradesh Assembly, 

 his application to enroll as a voter has been rejected on 

 the grounds that he has not lived here since the last 14 

 years nor did he appear in person for the plea.

 Salems lawyer said he would 

 appeal against the order.

 Cops killed

 Jammu (PTI): 

 Two constables were killed and three other police personnel 

 injured when a truck they were travelling in rolled down 

 into a gorge in Doda district on Friday. The truck belonging 

 to the home guards and civil defence organisation was on 

 its way from Jammu to Dodam, sources said.

 Heroin haul

 Lucknow (PTI): 

 The narcotics department seized 5 kg of heroin and arrested 

 one person in this connection on Friday. The contraband 

 is valued around Rs 5 crore, police said.

 A bird flu research centre will be set up in Tamil Nadu. The centre will come up in Namakkal, one of the biggest poultry production centres in the country, at a cost of Rs 48 lakh.

 Dinner, more digestible

 Amar, Sonia: Polls 

 on plate 

 New Delhi, Aug. 23: The last time Amar Singh stepped into 10 Janpath, it was as an unwanted and uninvited guest.

 Along with the dinner, the Samajwadi Party leader had to swallow the ignominy of being ignored by hostess Sonia Gandhi and her loyalists.

 This one episode soured the Congress-Samajwadi equation more than the public spat between Congress leader Rajiv Shukla and Samajwadi chief Mulayam Singh Yadav did.

 Yesterday, when Amars black Bentley rolled into 7 Race Course Road, the Prime Ministers residence, Shukla was heard saying: Socialist party, zindabad. 

 Even if the chill between the Samajwadi general secretary and Sonia did not exactly thaw, most in the Congress heaved a sigh of relief that the untouchability tag on Amar had been discarded at last.

 Amar and Ram Gopal Yadav, the Samajwadi leader in the Lok Sabha, had been invited to a dinner hosted by Manmohan Singh last night. So was Mulayams son Akhilesh.

 Akhilesh, an MP from Kannauj, made it a point to greet the Prime Minister and Sonia. They were all smiles, said a guest.

 The dinner would have passed off as a ritualistic show by the government when a Parliament session draws to a close. Usually, the guest list is confined to UPA and Left MPs. But this time, Manmohan and Sonia decided that other parties supporting the government from outside principally the Samajwadi Party, Rashtriya Lok Dal and the Bahujan Samaj Party must be invited.

 Does the decision have something to do with the Uttar Pradesh elections being just six months away? Of course, said a Congress minister, adding that there are leaders who feel that the party must reach out to the Samajwadis. Nobody spoke of an alliance or a covert understanding but the unstated feeling was that the secular votes must not be split.

 However, a section of the Congress argued that unless Amar and Mulayam were banished from the heartland, politically that is, there was no way of wooing Muslim voters.

 At the dinner, the organisers were faced with a dilemma of another kind where to seat Amar?

 The three main tables were headed by the Prime Minister, Sonia and home minister Shivraj Patil. A seat on Sonias table was out of the question, and one on Manmohans would be giving him too much importance. So, Patil had to give him company.

 But Amars date this time, too, turned sour, thanks to a food goof-up. The chefs were not to blame, though. The culprits were the waiters, who brought the wrong dishes at the wrong time. When starters were to be served, the main course showed up, and when stomachs were rumbling for the main course, tiny bowls of chaat were passed around.

 But no one complained. The unwritten rule was that those on the VVIP tables couldnt leave and go for the buffet. So while the hoi polloi stuffed themselves, the elites had to nibble at chaat, Amar included.

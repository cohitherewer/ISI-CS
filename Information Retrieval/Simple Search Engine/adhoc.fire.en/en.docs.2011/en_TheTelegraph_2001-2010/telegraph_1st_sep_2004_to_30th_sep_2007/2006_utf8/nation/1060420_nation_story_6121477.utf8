 Man missing after shot at suicide

 New Delhi: A 38-year-old man who allegedly tried to commit suicide in the Supreme Court on Wednesday went missing from Ram Manohar Lohia hospital, reports our legal correspondent.

 Doctors had referred him to a particular ward (room number 4) for treatment for suspected unknown poisoning but the police did not find him there.

 The man, believed to be a harassed litigant, had identified himself as Rajesh Gupta and said he was a resident of Ghaziabad.

 The police said they received a call around 3 pm but when they reached the court, he had already been taken to hospital. He probably ran away as he feared he would be prosecuted for attempt to commit suicide, the police added.

 Threat over peacock replica

Dhaka (PTI): The Institute of Fine Arts here received a bomb 

threat for making paper replicas of the peacock, Indias national bird, and 

displaying them during Bangladeshs new year celebrations.

 Prior to the April 14 celebrations this year, the institute received an unsigned letter warning that it risked getting blown up if it displayed replicas of the peacock like previous years, a media report said.

 If a bird is essential for the celebration, why the peacock and not Bangladeshs national bird doel? the Daily Star said quoting the letter.

 Debojit

 Mumbai, Feb. 24: Debojit Saha from Assam was tonight voted Indias Voice on Zee TVs music talent hunt Sa-Re-Ga-Ma-Pa Challenge 2005, triggering paroxysms of delight in a state that saw the contest as a prestige clash between the geographically distant Northeast and the rest of India.

 The three crore SMS and telephone votes from East Zone tilted the scales for the Silchar lad in the eight-month contests grand finale, organised at the sprawling Andheri Sports Complex. 

 Overall, it was a close affair with Debojit garnering 50.42 per cent of the 5.5 crore votes from across the country over the past three weeks. His rival, Vinit Singh from Lucknow, was leading midway through the final spurt of voting.

 Debojit won a handsome contract with HMV Saregama and a flat in Mumbai for winning the contest. The affable young man, speaking exclusively to The Telegraph, said he was overwhelmed by the support he received from Assam but would like to be recognised as a talent worthy of the entire nations adulation.

 On life after the contest, Debojit said: I will of course sing in Hindi but I would love to playback in Bengali films, too. Offers are pouring in already. 

 Parallel to the main contest was a match-up between the music directors who tutored the contestants. Debojits triumph was also a victory for his mentor Ismail Darbar, who had once even walked out of the television programme after a spat with the other music directors over which of the contestants was the best.

 Prodded to say something about Debojit, Darbar said: Debu har waqt ek lamba race ka ghora tha (He was always a winning horse).

 Vinits guru, Himesh Reshammiya, was also his usual combative self. Doesnt matter, I have made Vinit a star.

 New Delhi, Sept. 8: There were red faces in theUPA government and the Congress as blasts rocked Malegaon today.

 Its a terrible precursor of things to come in the festive season, said a member of the Congress minority cell. He wondered why Maharashtra and the Centre hadnt taken into account Malegaons reputation of being prone to communal backlashes.

 Today is Shabe-e-Barat; and Mumbai had seen blasts earlier. Didnt the government have information that Malegaon could be a target? a party official asked.

 Just two days ago, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had asked chief ministers to tone up their intelligence network and be sensitive to religious sentiments. Many were asking why things had still gone wrong. Was the Centre to blame or Maharashtra?

 The PM publicly stated he had spoken to the chief minister several times about being sensitive to minorities while enforcing law and order. Sonia Gandhi spoke to (Vilasrao) Deshmukh as well. Then why was he lackadaisical? a functionary asked.

 Singh and Sonia today appealed for communal harmony. The Prime Minister has condemned these attacks on the lives of innocent citizens, his office said.

 The partys top leaders went into a huddle at Singhs residence. Besides Singh and Sonia, Union ministers Pranab Mukherjee, Arjun Singh and Shivraj Patil and the Congress chiefs political secretary Ahmed Patel attended the meeting. 

 Congress sources said Sonia may accompany Patil, the Union home minister, to Malegaon tomorrow.

 Yet, many felt the Congress was in a no-win situation. In the Uttar Pradesh elections, Mulayam Singh Yadav will exploit such developments to project himself as the only Muslim messiah. And if the BJP demands a white paper on internal security, it will have to be all black from the government, a functionary said.

 The embattled Patil is likely to face a volley of questions at the party chief ministers conclave on September 23-24.

 The sources wondered why every time he was asked an uncomfortable question on the communal situation, he harped on the government having thwarted a major terrorist attack on the RSS headquarters. What message does he want to send that this government exists only to protect the swayamsevaks?

 Government sources said the Prime Minister had left it to Patil to handle the situation.

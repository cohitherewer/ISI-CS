 Naxalite war

 New Delhi, Feb. 9: A 10-member delegation of Rajya Sabha MPs from the Naxalite-affected states of Bihar, Orissa, Chhattisgarh and Andhra Pradesh met home minister Shivraj Patil yesterday and demanded effective implementation of land reforms along with strengthening of the intelligence network in these areas.

 Patil, however, told them Maoists could be tackled only through development of the tribal areas in these states. 

 Expressing the Centres displeasure over the states failure to utilise central funds for development, home secretary V.K. Duggal said some of the states had not even spent a single penny.

 Debt trap fells more farmers

 - Four commit suicide in 

Vidarbha on Diwali eve

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Oct. 21: Tiny oil lamps flickered in Vasudeo Tumaskars mud hut, but they could not light up his dark Diwali.

 The cotton farmer from Mirzapur in Wardha district was one of the four farmers who ended their lives on the eve of the festival as Vidarbha continued to reel under an agrarian crisis triggered by the collapse of the rural credit mechanism.

 Farmers in the region, where the toll since June 2005 touched 1,000 this week, have decided to mark a black Diwali. 

 According to the Vidarbha Jan Andolan Samiti, which maintains a daily log of the suicides, the four deaths on Diwali-eve came as the toughest time for cotton farmers the spraying season was about to set in. 

 Apart from Tumaskar, the others who chose death were Tejrao Patil from Hingne in Buldhana, Rajaram Badhe from Wagoda in Buldhana and Vijay Kalbudhe from Majgaon, Yavatmal.

 Kishore Tiwari, who heads the Samiti, pointed out that there has been a spurt in the number of suicides every month after the Prime Ministers two-day healing touch visit in June this year. 

 Manmohan Singh had announced a Rs 3,750-crore package for six affected districts of Vidarbha, which included an interest waiver worth Rs 712 crore on all overdue loans and a Rs 2,255-crore assistance for irrigation facilities. But the key demands of the farmers a complete loan waiver on current loans and an assured minimum support price of Rs 3,000 per quintal of cotton were not met.

 Since the Prime Ministers visit, the rate of suicides has climbed from 69 in June to 90 in July, 111 in August, 125 in September, and more than 50 already in October, Tiwari said.

 However, in an interview today, Maharashtra chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh denied that mounting debts had caused the suicides in Vidarbha. He added that the rate of suicides had declined from 55 per cent last month to 40 per cent. 

 Accusing Deshmukh of providing misleading information, Tiwari said: The chief minister did not say what other reasons triggered these deaths. I think there is a need to look at the whole issue as an agrarian crisis since all secondary systems of support have also failed. July to October is usually a busy time for farmers here, but they are ending their lives everyday. And the government is not willing to even accept responsibility.

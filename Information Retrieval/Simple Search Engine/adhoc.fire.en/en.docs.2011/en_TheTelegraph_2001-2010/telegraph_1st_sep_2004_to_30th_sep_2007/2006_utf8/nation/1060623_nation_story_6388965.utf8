 Spurned Delhi cop rapes Calcutta woman, gets axe

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 22: A 23-year-old from Jadavpur in Calcutta was allegedly raped in the dead of night in her house in Delhi by a drunk policeman, who had been harassing her for some time.

 Sub-inspector K.B. Jha of the crime branch was sacked with immediate effect, following a call from the victim, and arrested from her house where he was lying unconscious. A Delhi court remanded him to 14 days judicial custody.

 The victim, who had been working in Mumbai for a few years before moving to Delhi, lived in Rohini in the capitals north-west with a man called Rajkumar, with whom she is believed to have been in a relationship. She worked as a household help.

 Deputy commissioner of police Tejinder Luthra said, in the FIR, the woman has complained that a drunk Jha turned up at her house at 2.30 am today. Rajkumar, a tempo driver, was away at work. The policeman raped her before falling unconscious, she said.

 The girl, at this point, contacted the police. The police arrived at her Sector-16 house around 3.30 am and arrested Jha, Luthra said.

 Jha had been making passes at her for over a month, the victim said. Turned down, he started harassing Rajkumar and her, threatening them with dire consequences if they did not pay him money. The police are not clear whether the sub-inspector was blackmailing the couple.

 Neighbours said the policeman had a reputation in the area. This is not the first time he has made obscene passes at women. We were scared of him. After all, he is a sub-inspector, Ramandeep Kaur, a neighbour, said.

 The victim, according to Ramandeep, had recently started work. She used to look after children in a house in Pitampura (the colony next to Rohini) during the day.

 She was said to be upset as she used to have better work in Mumbai, which she had left to live with Rajkumar. Ramandeep said she does not know what the better work was. 

 The police are investigating the womans background.

 Jhas prompt dismissal from service was meant to send the right message, after several similar incidents in Mumbai. While in some cases in Mumbai, a departmental investigation had been ordered, Luthra said it was not necessary here.

 Citing Article 311(b) of the Constitution, he said: There is no need for an internal investigation in such cases before dismissing the officer in question. This is the only correct step to take.

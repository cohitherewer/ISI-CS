 A year on, peace bus has few takers

 Srinagar, April 7: A year after it rolled out on its maiden journey amid fanfare, the Karvan-e-Aman does not seem to be getting enough passengers. 

 The bus service was flagged off on April 7 last year and has since been flaunted as a successful confidence-building measure between India and Pakistan. 

 The service was started to bring together broken families on both sides of the Line of Control (LoC). But the State Road Transport Corporation (SRTC), which has exclusive rights to run the service, is feeling the pocket pinch.

 There are nine buses that the corporation runs from Srinagar to Aman Setu. 

 All these buses are luxury buses fitted with stereo systems, air-conditioners, plush upholstery and other modern trappings. Naturally, their maintenance costs are also higher than any normal fleet. The expected number of passengers has still not come forward, said a senior SRTC official.

 We are running the bus fleet despite losses because it brings together members of broken families. We are trying to augment the fleets income by using these buses to ferry tourists to various places in the Valley, said Nazir Ahmad, joint managing director of the transport corporation. 

 Separatist leaders are blaming the cumbersome procedures laid down by authorities here for the lack of passengers. 

 The procedures that one needs to go through to travel on this bus are so tedious and difficult that most people prefer to go to the other side of divided Kashmir through the Wagah border, said Mirwaiz Omar Farooq, chairman of the separatist All Parties Hurriyat Conference.

 Just before the October 8 quake in Pakistan, the bus carried less than five passengers to Aman Setu ? the last point on the Indian side ? when the number of passengers permitted is 30.

 The general refrain among the people in the Valley is that restricting travel only to the divided families has not served the purpose of enhancing people-to-people contact.

 So far, 710 passengers have travelled by the peace bus. Of them, 365 Kashmiris were from the Indian side while 345 came here from Muzaffarabad and elsewhere in PoK.

 Jamia reopens for admission

 New Delhi (PTI): The Jamia Milia Islamia 

 University, shut down last week after violence on its premises, 

 will reopen on Monday for completing the admission process, 

 authorities said on Sunday.

 An emergency meeting of the deans of faculties, senior members of the administration and the heads of departments, however, decided against resuming classes.

 The university is also in no mood to spare the students involved in the violence and has refused to re-admit rusticated students. Only democratic means of expression shall be tolerated. All those who indulge in acts of violence and destruction of property shall be dealt with severely, a statement released after the meeting said.

 Jamia witnessed largescale violence on Tuesday after the outgoing chairman of the students union, Shams Pervez, tried to meet vice-chancellor Mushirul Hasan for admission of some people who, the authorities claim, are known trouble-makers.

 First plea bargain case 

 New Delhi (PTI): A case will be 

 heard for the first time in the country under the new plea 

 bargaining provision on Monday. 

 Under this provision, the accused are pardoned by the victims in a criminal case if they are willing to compensate them monetarily or offer any other relief that satisfies the victims. 

 The case that is due for hearing in Delhi High Court on Monday involves an incident in 1992 in which the victims were dragged out of their houses and assaulted by the accused with lethal weapons. The four victims have reportedly granted their consent to their counsel to pardon the five accused men.

 Trishul tested

 Balasore (PTI): The countrys most 

 sophisticated short-range surface-to-air missile, Trishul, 

 was test-fired from Chandipur on Sunday, defence sources 

 said. 

 The missile, fired from a mobile launcher at about 11.50 am, was targeted at a micro-light aircraft.

 Bear attack

 Jammu (PTI): Two girls were mauled by 

 a bear in the forest belt of Poonch district of Jammu and 

 Kashmir early on Sunday. The girls had gone to the forest 

 with their cattle, officials said. Hearing the cries of 

 the girls, local residents reached the spot and chased the 

 bear away, they added. The girls were admitted to a hospital. 

 Blast kills one

 Srinagar (PTI): One person was killed 

 and two others were injured in an explosion near a scrap-dealers 

 shop at Handwara in Kupwara district of Jammu and Kashmir 

 on Sunday. 

 Schools in Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand 

 top the list of over two lakh Government Schools in the 

 country that lack basic facilities like water and toilets, 

 a government survey has found.

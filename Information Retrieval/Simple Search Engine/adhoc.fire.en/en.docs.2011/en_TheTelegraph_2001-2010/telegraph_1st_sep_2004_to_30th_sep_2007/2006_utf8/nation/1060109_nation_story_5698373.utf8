 Navy chief steps back from brink

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 8: Navy chief Admiral Arun Prakash had considered quitting after a relative of his was alleged to be involved in the leak of commercial information from the navy war room in defence headquarters.

 Admiral Prakash told a television channel today that he had since decided against it. Naval intelligence had cleared him of possible involvement in the leakage of information on patrol boats and surveillance equipment that the navy was planning to buy.

 Three officers, including the Director of Naval Operations, were summarily dismissed from service last October after news of the leak broke.

 Defence minister Pranab Mukherjee said in Guwahati that the government was not doubting Admiral Prakashs integrity. We have no doubt about his integrity. He is very competent, Mukherjee said.

 Admiral Prakashs nephew, Ravi Shankaran, was suspected to have been the conduit for the naval officers who leaked intelligence from the war room. Even when the court of inquiry was instituted last year, Admiral Prakash informed the defence minister that Shankaran was a relative.

 The navy chief was asked on TV about phone calls from his house to an arms dealer. He said it was not possible to monitor each call. I dont know who calls, who replies to them. But drawing any inference from certain telephone calls is certainly incorrect.

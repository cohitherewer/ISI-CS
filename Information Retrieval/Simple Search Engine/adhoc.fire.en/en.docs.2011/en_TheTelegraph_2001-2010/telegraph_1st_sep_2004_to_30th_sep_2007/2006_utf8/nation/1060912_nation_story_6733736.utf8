 Mercy plea

 Meerut/New Delhi, Sept. 11 (PTI): The execution of a youth convicted for raping and killing a four-year-old girl in Bulandshahr has been put off as Meerut district authorities claimed his mercy plea was pending with the President.

 Rashtrapati Bhavan and the ministry of home affairs, however, denied having received any clemency petition.

 Sanjay was to be hanged in Meerut district jail today but he is still in Agra central jail, district magistrate Mukesh Meshram said.

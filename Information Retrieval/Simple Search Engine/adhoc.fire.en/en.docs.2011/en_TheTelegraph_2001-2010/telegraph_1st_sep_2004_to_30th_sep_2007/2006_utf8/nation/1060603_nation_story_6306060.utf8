 Minister let off, father jailed

 Jabalpur, June 2 (PTI): A special court today acquitted Uttar Pradesh food and civil supplies minister Raghuraj Pratap Singh alias Raja Bhaiyya in a case under the anti-terror law but sentenced his father Uday Pratap Singh to five years of imprisonment.

 The court also acquitted Raja Bhaiyyas cousin Akshay Pratap Singh.

 The court found Uday Pratap Singh guilty of keeping in his possession prohibited weapons and upheld the Uttar Pradesh governments decision to frame a case under the anti-terror law against him.

 The court also slapped a fine of Rs 25,000 on him. The term of imprisonment may be extended by two months in case of non-payment of fine, the judge said.

 Raja Bhaiyya and his cousin were acquitted on the basis of lack of evidence.

 Uday Pratap Singh will be lodged in Jabalpur Central jail till further orders.

 The case against Raja Bhaiyya and the two others was transferred here from Uttar Pradesh following the Supreme Courts directives in November last year.

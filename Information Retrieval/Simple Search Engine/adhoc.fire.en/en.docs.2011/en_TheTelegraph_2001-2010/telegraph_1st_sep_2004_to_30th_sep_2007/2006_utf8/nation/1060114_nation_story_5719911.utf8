 Siachens not hurting any more

 SUJAN DUTTA

 New Delhi, Jan. 13: The war in Siachen has been well and truly frozen.

 For the first time since Indian troops occupied critical heights flanking the Siachen glacier 22 years ago, the army has not had a single casualty for a year. Siachen is not hurting us any more, the army chief, General Joginder Jaswant Singh, said here today.

 On April 13, 1984, the army in a move ? codenamed Operation Meghdoot ? occupied the Saltoro ridge and denied the Pakistan Army access to the glacier by occupying positions at heights ranging from 16,000 feet to 20,000 feet.

 Since that military operation, the coldest war has endured, taking a toll on both Pakistani and Indian troops but more on the Indian side as it occupies the strategic heights.

 There have been more casualties in Siachen because of the weather and avalanches than due to actual fighting. But, Singh said, in 2005, there has not been a single casualty due to extreme cold. Siachen is not hurting us at all.

 The army chiefs statement can be interpreted as meaning that India is not under any compulsion to withdraw from the heights because, over the decades, it has built up the infrastructure to maintain the positions. On the other hand, it can be argued that since the militarisation of Siachen is not hurting anybody, there is little logic in sustaining the military deployment.

 Since 2003, a ceasefire has been in operation along the Actual Ground Position Line along the Saltoro ridge as also along the Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir. General Singh said the army will continue to respect it and expects Pakistan to reciprocate.

 On Pakistans proposal to demilitarise certain regions of Kashmir, he said the threat of infiltration is still real and terrorist infrastructure in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir intact.

 Singh said the ceasefire has meant that there is peace along the border for the villagers and that the casualty rate in the army has come down drastically. 

 It was down by over 50 per cent since 2003, when 207 soldiers were killed, he said. In 2005, the number was 115.

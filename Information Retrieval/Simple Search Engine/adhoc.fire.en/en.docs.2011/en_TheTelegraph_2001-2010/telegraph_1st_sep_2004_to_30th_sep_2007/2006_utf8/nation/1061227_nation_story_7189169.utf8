 Canal ripples in refugee belt

 Rameshwaram, Dec. 26: Dredging for the Sethusamudram Ship Canal (SSC) project has been able to do what has otherwise not been easy to achieve on this pilgrim island reduce the number of Lankan refugees.

 The exercise that began around two weeks ago in the Adams Bridge area, near Rameshwaram, is being carried out by the Dredging Corporation of India (DCI) under the shipping ministry headed by DMK leader T.R. Baalu.

 There is a heavy security blanket over the island for the dredging. As a result, boats carrying Tamil refugees from northern Sri Lanka have been fewer in recent weeks. The navy has also opened a check-post at Moondram Chatram, on way to Dhanushkodi, the lands end here. 

 The drop is also because of two refugee camps that a United Nations body has opened in northern Sri Lanka.

 There is another side of the picture, too. The surveillance which makes it tough for Tamil refugees from Mannar in northern Sri Lanka to reach Indian shores around Dhanushkodi by a fast boat within an hour has also been prompted by fears of increased smuggling, particularly explosives and medicines to the LTTE. Refugee boats are often used to ferry smuggled items.

 Security officials deny the smuggling link, saying the increased vigil is part of an enhanced coastal security plan. They insist it has nothing to do with protecting the Dredging Corps vessels.

 But other sources say occasional shipments of bandages, essential medicines, beedis and lungis do make their way clandestinely across the Palk Strait. However, much of this is sent from points on the Ramanathapuram mainland, which has a long, porous coastline.

 But there are other ways in which supplies can reach Tamil Tigers. Local fishermen straying into Lankan waters in the hope of a good catch say they are threatened by either the LTTE or by other extortionists in the high seas to part with their diesel stockpiles.

 We are forced to give it away to save our lives, boats and catch, confided Sourirajan, a fisherman from Pamban area. 

 Some officials say fishermen sell diesel provided at subsidised rates by the state government to mid-sea extortionists at a much higher price, adding the fishermen were themselves to blame for becoming targets of the Sri Lankan Navy or the alleged hirelings of the LTTE. 

 But, after dredging for the Sethusamudram canal started, Lankan authorities have used the extra security on the Indian side to beat back local fishermen, asking them not to venture beyond Dhanushkodi. 

 While the tide of refugees has ebbed of late, the larger problem of how to deal with the swelling numbers hasnt. 

 The Mandapam refugee camp, near Rameshwaram, still looks crammed. The largest camp for Lankan Tamils in the state, it has registered more than 17,260 refugees since January this year. Of these, 12,185 have been sent to 103 other camps in the state.

 The DMK government has hiked monthly doles to these families and allowed those who entered the state in the late 80s and early 90s but left the camps to register afresh.

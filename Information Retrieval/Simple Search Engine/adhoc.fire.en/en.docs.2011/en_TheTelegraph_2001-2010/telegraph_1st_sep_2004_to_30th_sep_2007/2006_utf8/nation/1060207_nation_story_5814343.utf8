 CBSE scraps exam till VIII

 NILANJANA GHOSH CHOUDHURY

 Jamshedpur, Feb. 6: The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has decided to do away with terminal examinations till Class VIII. 

 It will instead follow the continuous assessment system that is in place till Class V.

 The board has taken the decision to reduce the pressure on students. The system not only encourages monthly tests instead of terminal examinations but also has provisions for evaluating students with grades rather than marks. 

 We have decided to implement the assessment system till Class VIII from April 2006 onwards, said G. Balasubramanian, director (academics) and chief vigilance officer, CBSE, during an interactive session with city school principals and teachers.

 The board has also decided to incorporate a seven-point grading system as compared to the existing five-point system. The curriculum giving complete details of the new assessment system would soon be sent to all CBSE-affiliated schools, he said.

 Principals were not sure if the no-exam policy would benefit students. Its good till Class V, but students need to be exposed to marking and examination at least in Class VII, otherwise it would become difficult for them to cope with the pressure of board examinations, said Vipin Sharma, principal of Vidya Bharti Chinmaya Vidyalaya. 

 The board will also lay stress on practical knowledge. The Class X science paper at the board examination would be bifurcated in a 60-40 ratio from the existing 75-25. While 60 marks have been allotted for the theory paper, the remaining 40 would be for practicals.

 Balasubramanian said that from 2007, the council has decided to introduce an adolescence education programme to instil life-skill education among students. 

 The programme would be implemented for students from Classes VI to X and it would be part of the co-curricular activities and no marks will be allotted for this paper, said Balasubramanian.

 This adolescence education programme has a tie-up with the Government of India with technical support from the Vidyasagar Institute of Mental Health and Neuro-sciences, he said. 

 Introduced with an aim to create awareness on issues like HIV/AIDS, the session will begin with programmes conducted by VIMHANS for principals and teachers. Every school will select two teachers, who, in turn, would receive the required training conducted by VIMHANS in various parts of the country and would go back to implement the same in their respective schools, said Balasubramanian.

 Deity debate rocks House

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 25: Angry exchanges during a debate on derogatory references to Hindu deities in a post-graduate history course forced two adjournments in the Lok Sabha today.

 Speaker Somnath Chatterjee had to stop discussions on a calling-attention motion when a BJP member made a reference to Congress chief Sonia Gandhi, setting off an uproar from the treasury benches.

 In an unusual turn of events, the government agreed with the BJP that there were objectionable portions in the study material provided for two courses in the Indira Gandhi National Open University (Ignou). I am equally hurt, said human resources development minister Arjun Singh.

 The English version was printed in October 2003 and sent to students in August 2004. The Hindi version came later but students pointed out the derogatory language only this year. Arjun said the university had withdrawn the material, which is now being examined by a panel of experts. 

 Deputy leader of the Opposition V. K. Malhotra said the objection was over the manner in which the deities were described in the Ignou text. He also listed school textbooks that apparently referred to freedom fighters as terrorists and made pejorative references against the Sikhs and the Jats. These books, he insisted, were in use even now. 

 When the Speaker urged him to stick to the Ignou study matter, it led to sharp exchanges between BJP and Congress MPs. The situation worsened when leader of the House Pranab Mukherjee said one text talked of Goddess Durga sipping alcohol. Protests from the BJP, which had picked this among the offensive portions, first forced a 15-minute adjournment. After the House reassembled, the reference to Sonia ignited a Congress backlash, prompting the second postponement.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Protest with red rose, a la Munna

 - Gandhigiri 

 latest craze among agitators 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 A still from Lage Raho Munnabhai

 Lucknow, Sept. 25: Judges are red-faced. Magistrates are ducking for cover. The police are as flummoxed as their Raj-era forbears had been.

 If its an epidemic, maybe the whole town should be quarantined.

 Gandhigiri is breaking out everywhere in Lucknow. Its invaded homes and government offices, taken over the streets and sneaked into courtrooms.

 When the first symptoms appeared on September 20, most adults would have dismissed it as one of those fevers with rashes youngsters are always catching.

 Two dozen young men had put on Gandhi caps and marched silently to the high court with flowers in hand, demanding a liquor shop-cum-bar be moved from a residential area in Rana Pratap Marg.

 It did seem more than a bit odd, though, that they would hand the red roses to the liquor shop owner, the advocates fighting their case against him, the judges and whoever else was in sight.

 But the adults gave each other knowing smiles. Must be something the kids had caught in the cinemas. Some flick called Lage Raho Munnabhai was showing a gangster get all uptight and switch from dadagiri to Gandhigiri to bully people with bouquets rather than bullets. Not like real life, though you know what Hindi films are like.

 Matters turned more serious this morning when some 50 adults, mostly women, walked into the additional district magistrates home at 8 carrying packets of flowers and singing Raghupati Raghava Raja Ram.

 They explained to security that the flowers were for the ADM. Just a peaceful way of telling him that the liquor shop in R.P. Marg should go.

 The ADM, of course, locked the doors and windows and barricaded himself in. Its not known if he sprayed disinfectants or called up doctors.

 Doctors? Students from King George Medical College were by then planting trees on the streets and offering flowers to the aged, singing Raghupati Raghava and demanding yes, the liquor shop should shift.

 Their leader Vikram Singh explained: Lucknow is steeped in a culture of violence. It should now be a laboratory for the application of Gandhism.

 In the afternoon, Lucknow University students were showing symptoms.

 For now, Gandhigiri seems difficult to contain. When the high court on September 20 dismissed the youngsters petition, they handed the judges flowers. They then made it to the local excise office, pleading the shop be asked to shift while burying officials under flowers.

 - Former 

 BPL boss set to join Mallya, Ambani 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chandrasekhar 

 Bangalore, March 16: After Vijay Mallya and Anil Ambani, former BPL Communications chief Rajeev Chandrasekhar is set to join Parliaments club of rich businessmen fond of the high life.

 The 53-year-old Chandrasekhar, known for his love of high-end cars and motorbikes, today filed his nomination for the Rajya Sabha as an Independent. He has the backing of the Janata Dal (Secular) and the BJP.

 Whats opened the door for him is that no party in Karnataka ? the Dal (S), BJP or the Congress ? is assured a second seat despite having surplus votes. None, therefore, has fielded a second candidate. So Chandrasekhar, the unopposed fourth candidate, is set to win.

 The Congress is slightly upset with the entry in the race of the man who can be seen zipping across Bangalores Ring Road at the wheel of his Lamborghini or on his Harley Davidson every weekend. But Chandrasekhar has no qualms. The son of a distinguished air force officer ? and nephew of national security adviser M.K. Narayanan ? is looking at a smooth landing in Delhi in his Cessna 172 sometime soon.

 While the public may not know much about him, the man himself has been rubbing shoulders with politicians for years. He has attended A.B. Vajpayees quiet birthdays and has been flitting in and out of the inner circle of various political parties in Delhi.

 Years ago, he was part of the original Intel Pentium team and has his initials etched on all 486s ? computer processors developed by Intel before the Pentium era ? to mark his contribution.

 I am aware that there are many industrialists/businessmen in the Rajya Sabha and I seek to make a distinction in that, the man who sold BPL Telecom to Hutch for Rs 4,400 crore said in a statement. I see the Rajya Sabha as an opportunity for public service.

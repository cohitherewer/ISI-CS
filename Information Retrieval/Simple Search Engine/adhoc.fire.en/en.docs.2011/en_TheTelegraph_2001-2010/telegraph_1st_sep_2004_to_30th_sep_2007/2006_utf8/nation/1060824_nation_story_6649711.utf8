 SC notice to govt on profit law

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi, Aug. 23: The Supreme Court today issued a notice to the Centre on a petition challenging the constitutional validity of the amendment to the office of profit law. 

 A three-judge bench headed by K.G. Balakrishnan asked the government to respond to a plea filed by Trinamul Congress MP Dinesh Trivedi. The Rajya Sabha member from Bengal alleged that the Parliament (Prevention of Disqualification) Amendment Act was passed without addressing President A.P.J. Abdul Kalams concerns.

 The judges refused to accept the request of Trivedis lawyer, Harish Salve, to restrain the Election Commission from disposing of petitions seeking disqualification till a ruling on the Trinamul leaders petition came through. But the bench did ask the Centre to respond to the points raised in the suit.

 Trivedi contended that a sizeable number of the 45 offices exempted with retrospective effect did not even exist when the original 1959 act came into force. 

 He said the amendment was introduced without consulting the joint parliamentary committee on offices of profit whose views have usually been taken since the Bhargava Committee recommended the practice in 1955.

 The offices were being exempted, Trivedi argued, without a common denominator. 

 Trivedi pointed out in his petition that Union law minister H.R. Bhardwaj had admitted in Parliament that the amendment to the law, passed with retrospective effect, was indeed aimed at protecting some members from possible disqualification. 

 He said the President had returned a bill for reconsideration, with a message, for the first time in 56 years. 

 Kalam wanted clear rules for such exemptions and the propriety of introducing the change with retrospective effect.

 The bill was first sent to the President on May 25, but he returned it on May 30. After it was passed again without modifications and sent back, Kalam signed it on August 18. It was notified and made effective the same day.

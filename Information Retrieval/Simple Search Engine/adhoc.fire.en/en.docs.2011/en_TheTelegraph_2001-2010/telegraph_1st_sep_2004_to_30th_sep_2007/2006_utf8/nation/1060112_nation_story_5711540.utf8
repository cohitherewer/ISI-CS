 Ramayan: The trendsetter

 New Delhi, Jan. 11: After Lord Ram hit bullseye, Cartoon Network is looking at six more Indian animation characters drawn from folklore and mythological parables to court kids.

 Akbar and Birbal, a 13-episode 2D animation series, a 60-minute feature titled The Legend of Buddha and Son of Aladdin, a 3D adventure series, are on the channels menu this year.

 We are looking at acquiring between six to eight Indian properties in the near future, of which at least three of them will be launched this year, said Vishnu Athreya, the senior programming manager of Cartoon Network India.

 The network now has nine Indian animation series on air.

 Akbar and Birbal? traces some of the stories and anecdotes of one of the greatest Mughal emperors and one of his most renowned navaratnas ? Birbal. While the series will serve as an appealing introduction to the historical royal pair for children, for adults, the series will also bring to life the tale that they would have read as kids, Athreya said.

 While Indian legends will be at the epicentre of the localisation drive, the network is looking at anything that would be appealing for kids.

 We are also open to the idea of adventure thrillers. The scope is very large in India and in terms of viewership, the country contributes a lot, more so because of the sheer size of the population, he said.

 Launched in India in 1995, Cartoon Network is a division of global media conglomerate Turner Broadcasting System Inc.

 Available in English and Hindi, the network has acquired and aired locally-produced programmes like Pandavas ? The Five Warriors, Sinbad ? Beyond the Veil of Mists, Ramayan ? The Legend of Prince Ram, The Adventures of Tenali Ram and Vikram Betal.

 The Legend of Buddha and Son of Aladdin will follow Akbar and Birbal. The former traces the life of Lord Buddha from his childhood through enlightenment and seeks to popularise his teachings. Son of Aladdin is a 3D adventure animation based on the Arabian Nights character, said Athreya.

 The channel is also trying to woo children with merchandise. Its global branding and merchandising arm, Cartoon Network Enterprises, is working out licensee partnerships for apparel, accessories, toys and games, stationery, sporting goods, home d?cor and linen.

 The company has already launched consumer products featuring popular stars like Powerpuff Girls, Dexter and Johnny Bravo.

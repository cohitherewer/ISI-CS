 Delhi in nuke fight

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 16: India will join a Russian-sponsored international convention against nuclear terrorism, aimed at fighting the threat of nuclear arsenals falling into terrorists hands.

 Already signed by over 50 countries, the treaty offers safeguards against home-made nuclear devices and provides for international cooperation towards investigation, prosecution and extradition of individuals or groups that carry out nuclear attacks.

 Its the first UN anti-terrorist convention adopted after the September 11 attacks in the US. The convention, however, allows civilian and military application of nuclear materials.

 After the Union cabinet approved the decision to join the convention today, defence minister Pranab Mukherjee said the move would strengthen Indias credentials as a responsible partner in the fight against terrorism. Some 60 countries are in line to sign the treaty.

 The US and Russian Presidents had issued a joint statement on nuclear security co-operation earlier this year, calling for early adoption of the convention. UN secretary-general Kofi Annan, who has tabled a report, titled In Larger Freedom, on the convention, made a separate call.

 When the treaty was opened for signing last September, Russia and the US were the first to join. Several others, such as France, Britain, Canada, Australia, Romania and Austria, followed.

 The convention can be signed till the UN General Assembly meets later this year.

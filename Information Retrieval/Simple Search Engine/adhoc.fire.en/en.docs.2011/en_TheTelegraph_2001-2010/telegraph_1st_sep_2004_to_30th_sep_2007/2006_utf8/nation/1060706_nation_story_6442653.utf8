 New Delhi, July 5: A fissure appeared to split the countrys medical community today, with the Indian Medical Association condemning the sacking of AIIMS director P. Venugopal, but some doctors saying it was overdue.

 In a statement, the IMA said it was extremely distressed that one of Indias most renowned cardiac surgeons had been treated in this manner.

 Such an act has brought down the morale of medical professionals, the IMA said. The health minister has tried to kill the autonomy of the institute? tried to settle his personal scores with Venugopal by encouraging his ouster, it said. The IMA also said it would not tolerate any such misdemeanour to spoil the autonomy and working of the institute.

 This is a wound on the institute. It will take a long time to heal, P.K. Dave, a former AIIMS director, told The Telegraph. I think this should have been handled better.

 However, some doctors have questioned the authority of the IMA in claiming that it represents the medical community. How many doctors in the country does the IMA represent when it issues such a statement? a doctor asked.

 Senior faculty at AIIMS alleged that Venugopal pursued an autocratic method of administration. For many faculty members, he had be come inaccessible, a doctor said.

 A senior cardiothoracic surgeon recalled that a fellow doctor once told him he had not spoken to Venugopal for years.

 The government has full authority to question a director about the institutes administrative affairs, a top doctor said. While AIIMS has intellectual and academic freedom, it is fully financed by the government and the administration is entirely accountable to the government.

 The question we should be asking the ministry is why it took so long to act against Venugopal, said a staff member who has spent over two decades at the institute.

 Health minister Anbumani Ramadoss had a few weeks ago said there were complaints against Venugopals administration and other problems about which he could not provide details.

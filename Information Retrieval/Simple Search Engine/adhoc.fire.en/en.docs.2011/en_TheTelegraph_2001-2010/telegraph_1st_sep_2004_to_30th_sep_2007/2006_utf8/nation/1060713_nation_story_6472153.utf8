 Militant denial

 Srinagar, July 12 (Reuters): Leading militant groups operating in Kashmir today denied any role in the bomb blasts in Mumbai and described the attacks as barbaric and outrageous.

 Security sources were quoted as naming the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Toiba as the prime suspect for the seven bomb blasts on Mumbais rail network yesterday. 

 But the Lashkar denied any role. These are inhuman and barbaric acts. Islam does not permit the killing of innocent people, a man who identified himself as Dr Ghaznavi, a spokesman said.

 The Hizb-ul Mujahideen, has denounced the bomb attacks as outrageous. Attacks on civilians are not part of our manifesto. We never carried out such attacks nor will allow anyone to do so, spokesman Ehsan Elahi said in Islamabad.

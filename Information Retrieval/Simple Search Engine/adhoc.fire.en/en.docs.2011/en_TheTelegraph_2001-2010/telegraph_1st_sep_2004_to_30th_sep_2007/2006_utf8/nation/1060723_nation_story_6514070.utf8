 Nitish Katara case

 New Delhi, July 22: The Nitish Katara murder case has taken a new twist with additional sessions judge Ravinder Kaur receiving a fax, purportedly from key witness Bharti Yadav, saying she was now willing to testify in the case via video-conferencing.

 The fax has been traced to a Middlesex, UK, number but the prosecution said it is not yet sure it is from Bharti. Police said Bharti usually signs her full name but the fax is signed as B. Yadav. Her brother, Vikas Yadav, is an accused in the murder of Katara with whom Bharti was alleged to be in a relationship.

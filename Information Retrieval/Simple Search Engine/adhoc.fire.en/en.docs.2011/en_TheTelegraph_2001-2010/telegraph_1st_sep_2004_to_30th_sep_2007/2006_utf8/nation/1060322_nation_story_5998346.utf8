 Govt cautious on milk row

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 21: The government has taken note of the circumstances that led to the resignation of Verghese Kurien as chairman of the Gujarat Cooperation Milk Marketing Federation but it is unlikely to order a probe immediately.

 Kurien, the father of Indias modern dairy industry, resigned yesterday, alleging that vested interests were out to capture the milk federation.

 The immediate provocation for the resignation was an impending no-confidence motion against Kurien, who has been locked in a running battle with Amrita Patel, his one-time prot?g? and the current chairperson of the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB).

 Kurien had written letters to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi, seeking a high-level inquiry into the working of the NDDB.

 In his letters ? sent much before he announced his resignation ? Kurien had said Patel should be sacked for violating provisions of the NDDB Act. Kurien has been in conflict with Patel for proposing corporatisation of the milk cooperative.

 Kurien also met finance minister P. Chidambaram on February 6. A finance ministry spokesperson said the matter is being processed. The spokesperson indicated that no probe was being considered as of now.

 Animal husbandry secretary P.M.A. Hakeem also ruled out an inquiry. No probe is being considered, Hakeem told The Telegraph.

 Hakeem said the governments role in the matter was limited. Sources indicated that any probe, if at all undertaken, would have to be carried out by the Registrar of Cooperative Societies, which falls under the domain of states.

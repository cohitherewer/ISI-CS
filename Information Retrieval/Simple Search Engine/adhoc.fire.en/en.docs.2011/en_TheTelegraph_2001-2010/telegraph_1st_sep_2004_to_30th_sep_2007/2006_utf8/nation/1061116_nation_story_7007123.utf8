 Defence buying flaws in glare

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 15: The comptroller and auditor-general (CAG), V.N. Kaul, today laid bare the Indian defence establishments poor procurement process and told a gathering of international arms transfer experts that it was riddled with flaws. However, he hoped new defence acquisition policies would be more accountable.

 My cursory review of audit findings indicates the need for a serious re-examination of our approach to defence planning, budgeting and particularly acquisition. While there have been many attempts at the reform of the system, our system is still not ideal for the rapid modernisation of men and machines in our defence forces, Kaul said.

 In 2006-2007, a budgeted Rs 30,000 crore is to be spent on capital acquisitions for the armed forces. Another Rs 18,000 crore is to be spent on running costs.

 Despite intensive and repeated efforts at reform, the problems in defence procurement persist, the CAG said. He was particularly scathing on the Defence Research and Development Organisation.

 Defence R amp;D, with an outlay of about Rs 5,000 crore, is an area where accountability often takes shelter under the policy of self-reliance and indigenisation becomes a reason for delay, he said in his keynote address. The CAG was speaking at a session on Audit and Accountability in Defence Expenditure and Procurement on the last day of an international seminar on defence finance and economics.

 The CAG enumerated the flaws:

 Long delays in the procurement system meant the technology was often outdated when it was delivered. This is true with almost every major defence acquisition

 Funds allotted remain unutilised

 Poor project and contract management

 Quality assurance systems are not modern.

 Each of the problems feeds into the next and worsens a bad situation, the CAG said. He said the ministry needed to fix responsibility on acquisition authorities to make them more accountable.

 The comfort of a blanket government approval or ministerial sanction in acquisition matters sometimes tends to dilute the oversight role of the ministry, he said.

 He said the reforms in defence policy should focus on issues of organisational and personal conflicts of interest and the development of a code of conduct for acquisition professionals.

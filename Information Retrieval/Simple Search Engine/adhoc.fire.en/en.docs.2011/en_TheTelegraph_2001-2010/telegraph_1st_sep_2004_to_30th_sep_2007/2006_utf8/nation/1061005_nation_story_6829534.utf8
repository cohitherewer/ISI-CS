 Srinagar, Oct. 4: After a five-month lull, a suicide squad today attacked a CRPF camp in the heart of Srinagar, leaving three policemen and a civilian dead.

 At 8.30 pm, the militants were holed up in an adjoining hotel.

 Three policemen and four civilians were injured. Security forces escorted over a hundred civilians out of nearby shops and buildings.

 The Al Mansoorian militant outfit has claimed responsibility for the attack.

 Three members of our suicide squad have attacked a security camp, a man claiming to be a spokesman for the organisation said in telephone calls made to local newspaper offices.

 After the attack on the camp housed in a building in Lal Chowk was foiled, the militants took shelter inside the nearby Standard hotel. Apart from the camp, the Akhara building houses the office of the custodian of the holy mace of Lord Shiva. The annual Amarnath yatra to the cave shrine starts from here with the mace.

 The morning attack on the CRPF camp began at 11.15 when the three militants lobbed grenades and opened fire on a picket guarding the entrance of the Akhara building. When the guards retaliated, the militants fled into the hotel.

 The militants shot at and seriously injured assistant sub-inspector Muhammad Yousuf and a constable.

 The militants appeared suddenly and fired at the policemen, said Abdul Rashid Bhat, the hotels manager. I pleaded that I am a civilian and they let me go.

 The hotel was soon besieged and a rescue operation was launched for the civilians trapped inside it and adjoining buildings.

 The militants continued firing in bursts to prevent security forces from entering the hotel. Two of our men were killed after we launched an assault, Kashmir DIG Farooq Ahmad said. We are going slow to avoid collateral damage.

 The two policemen killed are Raj Pal and Showkat Ahmad, while the third one has not been identified yet. One shopkeeper also died in the exchange of fire.

 The attack created panic in the city. Pedestrians ran for cover and markets emptied within minutes as shopkeepers downed shutters.

 Todays attack was the second in five months. On May 21, two Lashkar-e-Toiba militants attacked a Congress rally at the Sher-e-Kashmir Park here, leaving seven party activists dead. The target was Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Ghulam Nabi Azad, who was not present when the militants struck. Both the attackers were later killed.

 The rally, organised for the death anniversary of Rajiv Gandhi, was abandoned.

 50 feared dead in accident

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Jammu, April 7: More than 50 passengers were feared killed when the bus in which they were travelling skidded off the road in Doda district and fell into the Chenab river today.

 Of the 55 passengers in the bus that began its journey from the mountainous town of Atholi at 7 in the morning, only three could be rescued in an injured condition. Two bodies were also recovered.

 There is little hope of rescuing more survivors from the icy waters of the Chenab.

 We are hoping against hope, said senior superintendent of police Prithiraj Manhas. The difficulty in carrying out rescue operations is that even choppers cannot enter the river route as the bus is trapped between rocks and the waters have covered the whole body of the vehicle.

 Even as an inquiry has been ordered into the mishap, initial reports suggested that the driver lost control of the overcrowded bus while negotiating a sharp curve on a narrow stretch of the mountainous road.

 The three passengers rescued had jumped out instinctively as the bus started rolling down and clung to trees.

 Chief minister Ghulam Nabi Azad has expressed grief and said rescue operations should not be stopped.

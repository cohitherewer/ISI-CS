 Sugar link to stroke deaths

 G.S. MUDUR

 New Delhi, Nov. 12: High blood sugar levels, even when lower than the standard cut-off points for diabetes, might be causing 2.2 million deaths from heart disease and stroke each year, the largest chunk clustered in south Asia, a new study said.

 The study, to be published this week in the medical journal Lancet, suggests that higher-than-optimum blood glucose concentrations might lie below the standard values for the diagnosis of diabetes and yet increase the risk of heart disease and stroke.

 Majiz Ezzati at the Harvard School of Public Health and his colleagues pooled results of previous studies from different parts of the world, including south Asia, and found that higher-than-optimum blood glucose accounts for one in five deaths from heart disease, and one in eight deaths from stroke worldwide.

 The study showed that in 2001, 960,000 deaths were directly attributed to diabetes and its complications. But it also found another 1.5 million deaths from heart disease and 700,000 deaths from stroke were caused by blood glucose levels that were high, but lower than the traditional definition of diabetes.

 Diabetologists in India said they are not surprised by the findings.

 Theres nothing magical about the standard limits for diabetes, said Anoop Misra, a diabetes specialist formerly at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in New Delhi.

 At present, a person with blood glucose concentration higher than 126 mg per dl is said to have diabetes. A blood glucose level of 100 mg per dl is considered normal. But people with blood glucose levels in the 90s may also be at some risk, Misra said.

 An earlier study had revealed a risk of heart disease among urban Indians even at glucose levels between 90 and 100, said Dr Vishwanathan Mohan, director of the Diabetes Research Centre, Chennai.

 The Harvard researchers cited previous studies from the Asia-Pacific region that revealed a continuous association between blood glucose and the risk of heart disease and stroke at levels above 88 mg per dl. Earlier studies indicated that the risk of cardiovascular disease is lowest when fasting blood glucose is between 79 and 88.

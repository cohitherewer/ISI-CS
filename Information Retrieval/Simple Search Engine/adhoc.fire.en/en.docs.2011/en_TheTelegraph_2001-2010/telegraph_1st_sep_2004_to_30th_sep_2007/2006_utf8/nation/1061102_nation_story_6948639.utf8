The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Phew! PM survives coconut amp; cabbie

 Officials remove empty chairs in haste after few people turned up for the Prime Ministers morning meeting in Thiruvananthapuram on Wednesday. The attendance was better at a party meeting in the afternoon. Telegraph picture 

 Thiruvananthapuram, Nov. 1: 

 Coconut palms were tonsured, lest dry nuts land on 

 the Prime Ministers audience.

 Traffic was fenced off hundreds 

 of metres from the venue, scaring away common people from 

 Manmohan Singhs meeting on the beach. 

 The resultant empty chairs 

 presented an unseemly sight so officials went to work 

 with clockwork precision to remove many of them.

 Every detail was taken care of but for one: the Kerala government could find only a tourist taxi driver to pilot the Prime Minister from the airport to Raj Bhavan.

 Perhaps overwhelmed by the thought of leading the way for the most secured person in the country, Shiju, the hapless driver, took the wrong turn at 10.05 pm last night.

 Down an underpass went as many as seven vehicles of the Prime Ministers motorcade, faithfully following the pilot car that missed the left turn to the Raj Bhavan.

 Nonplussed security officers recovered fast enough to prevent Singhs car from entering the underpass but not before Special Protection Group agents jumped out and took position across the road in the heart of capital Thiruvananthapuram. 

 An annoyed SPG director, P.V. Wanchoo, was seen gesticulating, too. 

 At 60 km an hour, the runaway vanguard had already gone 100 metres into the underpass, holding up the entire convoy for five minutes a big security risk. 

 The SPG then detained a shaken Shiju, who kept mumbling that he had acted on the orders of a reserve inspector. Shiju was freed this afternoon, but he had to be hospitalised after he complained of unease.

 The nerves of the CPM-led government, too, remained taut with the goof-up coming despite live-wire preparations for the visit that came four days after an email assassination threat to the Prime Minister from the same state.

 The Union home ministry has sought a report from the state government on the security breach, prompting an embarrassed Kerala home minister, Kodiyeri Balakrishnan, to called off his Delhi trip at Chennai and fly back.

 From the airport he drove straight to Raj Bhavan to offer his apologies to the Prime Minister.

 It is a serious lapse. It looks like a typical case of carelessness, but strong action will be taken against those who have erred, Balakrishnan said.

 Reserve inspector R. Balachandran, who was in the pilot vehicle, has been suspended but theres already widespread criticism that the state government was making scapegoats of low-ranking officers.

 Besides, the government had no answer to persistent questions on why a private tourist taxi driver was roped in. The pilot vehicle had taken part in several rehearsals on the 10-km stretch from the airport to the Raj Bhavan.

 As many senior officials woke up with red faces today, others worked overtime to ensure that as few people as possible attended Singhs meeting on the beach to kick off the expansion project of the Thiruvananthapuram airport.

 Footnote: The Prime Minister did take off for Delhi in the evening without any other untoward incident.

 Strike massage amp; motivation

 JEENA SARAH JACOB

 New Delhi, May 15: Medicos on strike against quotas had no dearth of either motivation or support, though political parties kept a safe distance.

 Senior residents in the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) have thrown their weight behind the medicos on hunger strike. The AIIMS doctors will observe Thursday as Black Day but will not go on strike. 

 A number of senior doctors stopped work indefinitely in support of the striking students. Barring intensive care units and emergency services, all other medical services were hit.

 The medical students were also joined by students from Delhi University and private institutions. Doctors in some private hospitals, too, supported the medical bandh called today in protest against the reservation in education. 

 The medicos were also lectured by Shiv Khera, motivational guru. Khera has been spending time with the protesting doctors intermittently since yesterday.

 He arrived to motivate the protesters this afternoon, gave a short lecture followed by an interview to a television channel and left.

 They are ready to do away with the caste system socially, but not politically, Khera said to thunderous applause from the doctors. I call upon all concerned citizens, parents and children to come forward and court arrest on the reservation issue. The police would not have the guts to arrest them, he said.

 Despite the swelling protests, political parties chose to keep their distance. The BJP today expressed concern on the limited issue of police action but carefully avoided any expression of solidarity with the students on quotas.

 The doctors ? about a 100 are on the indefinite hunger strike ? wielded placards and banners targeting human resource development minister Arjun Singh. The students also rejected talks with him and some said the Prime Minister should hold a dialogue with them.

 Sporting black head-bands and ribbons, the students sat together, fanning those who were fasting and boosting one anothers morale. Late tonight, PTI reported that seven students have collapsed.

 We are stuck between the devil and the deep sea, said a student of Lady Hardinge Medical College. The patients are suffering because of the strike. We dont want that but we also need to protect our interests, she added.

 Patients are our first priority. At most hospitals, students have voluntarily opened parallel outpatient departments, said another student.

 The government has threatened to recruit new faces.

 On whether they are inconveniencing patients, a junior doctor said: My life is at stake here. I have to act to protect my own dignity. The doctors feel that the quotas would affect the prospects of admission to higher education courses.

 Cop suspended

 Mumbai police today sought to pacify the students by suspending an officer who ordered a lathi-charge on Saturday.

 Deputy chief minister R.R. Patil, after meeting an Indian Medical association delegation, said police inspector Madhukar Sankhe of the Malabar Hill police station had been suspended for giving false information to his superiors that there was no lathi-charge.

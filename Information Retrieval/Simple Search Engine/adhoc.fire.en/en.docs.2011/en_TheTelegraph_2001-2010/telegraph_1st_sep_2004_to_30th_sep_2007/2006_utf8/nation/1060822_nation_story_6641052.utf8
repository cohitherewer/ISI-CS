 Judge case relief for Lalu

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 21: Lalu Prasad, accused of interfering in the appointment of a judge hearing a disproportionate assets case against him and his wife Rabri Devi, got a breather today when the Supreme Court dismissed petitions seeking cancellation of bail granted to the couple.

 The judges said the petitioners were waging a political battle against Lalu Prasad and Rabri Devi in the courtroom. 

 The assets case is an offshoot of the fodder scam cases involving the RJD chief and his wife, in which Muni Lal Paswan had replaced special judge Yogendra Prasad allegedly at the behest of the couple.

 However, one of the three judges said the PILs were maintainable and that the time had come for high courts to lay down rules for appointing judges to hear important cases.

 The other two judges on the bench Justices K.G. Balakrishnan and A.R. Lakshmanan said the PILs filed by BJPs Sushil Kumar Modi and Janata Dal (United) leader Rajeev Ranjan Singh did not have any merit. The petitioners had challenged the grant of bail to the couple, change of the special judge hearing the fodder scam cases and the quashing of income-tax cases against them.

 But Justice S.H. Kapadia differed. He said the selection of Paswan as special judge had to be seen in the light of the fodder scam in which crores of rupees were siphoned out of the state treasury.

 The registrar-general of Patna High Court had clearly stated that there was neither an annual confidential report on Paswan nor a report by the inspecting judge, unlike two other judges appointed on the same day, Justice Kapadia pointed out.

 Justices Balakrishnan and Lakshmanan countered saying there was absolutely no adverse entry against Muni Lal Paswan.

 Rejecting the plea for cancellation of bail, they said: We are of the opinion that PIL is totally foreign to pending criminal proceedings.

 The judges added: In our opinion, the liberty of an accused cannot be taken away except in accordance with the established procedure of law under the Constitution, criminal procedure and other cognate statutes.

 On the plea for monitoring of trial, the court said it is subversion of criminal law as it stands to mean that the court behind the back of the accused is entering into a dialogue with the investigating agency.

 Noting that the petitioners had also challenged the appointment of the public prosecutor, the judge said they were trying to find fault with every step taken. (In) cases like this, delay is inevitable.

 Taking into consideration a counter-affidavit by the UPA government on not filing an appeal against an income-tax appellate tribunal order in the couples favour, the court said it had been clearly stated that there was no substantial question of law for filing appeals.

 Close shave for plane 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Srinagar, Jan. 29: Passengers of an Air Sahara flight had a narrow escape this afternoon when the right wing of the jet grazed the nose of a parked Air-India plane at Srinagar airport.

 Both aircraft shook briefly because of the impact, damaging the right wing of the Delhi-Srinagar Air Sahara plane. But no one was injured.

 The incident occurred as the 180-seater Boeing, which was almost full, was taxiing in. The Air-India plane, whose nose it hit, had brought Haj pilgrims home.

 The damaged wing of the Air Sahara plane is being repaired. It is clearly a pilots parking error and that of the directing ground staff, said an airport official. 

 Sources said the departure of the flight back has been delayed. 

 We are trying to ensure the fault is rectified before the flight is cleared for take-off, said the official.

 However, a senior airport officer said late tonight that the flight had been grounded at Srinagar airport and its status would be decided tomorrow.

 It was a busy day at the airport today as four Haj flights along with half-a-dozen other planes, including those cancelled yesterday because of bad weather, landed here.

 Parking space at the airport, where renovation and construction are underway to upgrade it to international status, is not adequate, the sources said.

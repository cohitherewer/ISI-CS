 Yechury: Lapping up limelight

 New Delhi, April 27: CPM leader Sitaram Yechury is soaking in all the attention being showered on him courtesy the Nepal turmoil.

 On the eve of his departure for Kathmandu, the Rajya Sabha MP addressed a packed news conference in Delhi and made it evident that he was enjoying being courted by the high and mighty and the limelight that accompanied it. 

 While Prime Minister Manmohan Singh feted his efforts to untangle the knots in the neighbouring kingdom ? Yechury also had a discussion with the group of ministers set up by Singh ? defence minister Pranab Mukherjee discussed the evolving situation with him.

 Not just at home, the CPM politburo member is being given pride of place at the scene of action as well. Girija Prasad Koirala, the man set to run Nepal, has invited Yechury to take an initiative in hammering out a final formula that would be acceptable to all.

 India is not playing the role of an elder brother in Nepal, the CPM leader clarified. It is the sovereign right of the Nepali people to make a political choice. It is with this spirit that I will go there tomorrow, he said.

 The participation by Maoists in the democratic process in Nepal may have an impact on South Asia, Yechury said. 

 Referring to the Naxalite trouble dogging India, including CPM-run Bengal, he said: There are lots of ultra Left groups in India. Participation by Nepals Maoists can have a salutary effect on them.

 The CPMs relations with Maoists have from the beginning been hostile. Now, Yechury is penning a new script for Indias neighbour ? doing his bit to build a bridge between the same radical Left groups and mainstream parties in Nepal.

 There is a huge amount of celebration in what has happened in Nepal. But there is also a lot of apprehension, Yechury said. If the present roadmap is disturbed, then there will be deeper anarchy and civil war. 

 The CPM MP had some nuggets of advice for the Indian government as well. Nepal has witnessed a new peoples awakening. India will have to find its equation with the new set-up, he said. 

 Basking in the limelight, he could not resist making a dig at the UPA government. Many even in our own country prefer the king to the Maoists. But Nepal can no longer be fitted into a jigsaw puzzle. It is essential to understand the growing sentiment among the people, he said.

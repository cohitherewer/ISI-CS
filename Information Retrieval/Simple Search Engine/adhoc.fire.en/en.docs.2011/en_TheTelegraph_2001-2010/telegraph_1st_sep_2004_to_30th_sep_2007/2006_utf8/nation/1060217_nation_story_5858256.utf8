 Shops in houses face closure

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 16: The Supreme Court today set a 40-day deadline for putting an end to commercial use of residential premises in the capital in an order that could affect popular shopping destinations like South Extension and Lajpat Nagar.

 The Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) has been asked to publish within 10 days a list of premises being used in violation of rules and the violators have been directed to stop such misuse within 30 days thereafter.

 The directives came on a PIL by environmentalist M.C. Mehta and are likely to affect some big shops and showrooms in posh residential areas.

 Greater Kailash, Kailash Colony, Green Park, Lajpat Nagar, Defence Colony, Hauz Khas, South Extension, Malviya Nagar, Munirka, Patel Nagar, Tilak Nagar, Kingsway Camp, Model Town, Laxmi Nagar, Patparganj and Shahdara are among the areas where the MCD had detected violations.

 The court said after the publication of the list in newspapers, the owners should file affidavits before MCD commissioner stating that the misuse of their premises had been stopped. The court said the properties would be sealed if affidavits were not filed in 30 days of the publication of the list.

 The directives are limited to violations of the master plan in residential areas and would not apply to unauthorised constructions that are being dealt with by the high court.

 Small shops catering to daily needs should be spared for the time being, the court said.

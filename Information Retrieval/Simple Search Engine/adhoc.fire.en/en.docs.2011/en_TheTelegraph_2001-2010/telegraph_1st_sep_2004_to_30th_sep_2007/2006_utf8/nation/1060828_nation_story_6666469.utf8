 Rules prod for bungee jumping

 New Delhi, Aug. 27 (PTI): A consumer court that received a complaint from a man who lost an eye during a bungee jumping event has asked the Centre to frame rules for the adventure sport. 

 The Delhi State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission issued notices to the tou- rism and culture ministry, the Haryana state, the Suraj Kund mela authorities and five others who were associated with the Suraj Kund mela bungee jumping event in 2004 in which victim Vikas Chaudhary was severely injured. 

 The commission asked the Centre to frame rules of bungee jumping on the lines of those in the state of Georgia in the US.

 Till then, the state government shall ensure that the department concerned has inspected and examined and certified that all necessary safety measures and norms are in order before permitting an organiser to have such an event, said the commission bench comprising Justice J.D. Kapoor and member Rumnita Mittal.

 Chaudhary, a Delhi-based software engineer, had approached the commission to seek a compensation of Rs 95 lakh for professional stagnation that was allegedly caused by physical and social harassment and disability, and for medical expenses that resulted from his bungee jump.

 He alleged that he was made to jump from a platform by the melas bungee jumping organiser. His rope snapped and caused multiple injuries, including the loss of an eye. He claimed that he was pushed by the instructor as there were many others waiting to take the plunge. 

 He said that he had brought the poor condition of his rope to the notice of the instructor but the latter was extremely callous and negligent. 

 It is unfortunate that the authorities concerned do not pay requisite attention or heed to such events and allow them without adhering to the safety norms for such an event, which involves great risk to the life and limb of the participants, the commission said.

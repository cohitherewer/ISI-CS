 Music suit costs Akhtar 1 lakh

 New Delhi, Dec. 3 (PTI): Lyricist Javed Akhtar has been fined Rs 1 lakh by Delhi High Court for withdrawing a copyright violation case against a film production house and putting unnecessary financial burden on it to defend itself. 

 Observing that defendant Magic Mantra Vision was put under unnecessary hardship as it had to visit Delhi time and again to defend the case, the court said: In view of the denial of the letter written by him (Akhtar) on January 10, 2001, transferring the copyright .... the suit is dismissed as withdrawn. 

 But this is subject to the condition that the lyricist pays Rs 1 lakh to the production houses proprietor, Samarjit Gupta, Justice A.K. Sikri said. 

 The order followed Akhtars failure to appear after he was summoned by the high court.

 However, Akhtars lawyer said his client wanted to withdraw the case against the company as he recognised his signature on the letter through which he had transferred the copyright to the company in 2001.

 Earlier, the companys counsel had claimed that the production house, being the producer of the film Pyar ki Dhun, had copyright over the songs in the film as Akhtar had transferred his copyright to it. The counsel also produced the original letter purportedly written by Akhtar to transfer the copyright to the company in 2001.

 In December last year, Akhtar had filed a suit against the film production house alleging infringement of his copyright in certain songs Gum-sum si ho, Meri in aankhon mein and Hum hain titliyan which he had written for the film Pyar ki Dhun. 

 He had alleged that he was the sole owner of rights over the lyrics except the right to make a film on his work. The company had licensed rights over the lyrical works in favour of Sa Re Ga Ma Indian Ltd (previously HMV). 

 The company had deprived him of financial benefit by selling CD and cassette recordings of the songs, although Akhtar had a right to receive royalty, he had alleged.

 Iran prof in custody for Delhi contacts

 CHARU SUDAN KASTURI

 New Delhi, June 13: An Iranian professor, till recently teaching philosophy in India, is being kept in police detention in Iran at an undisclosed location for building contacts with foreigners during his nearly year-long stay here.

 Professor Ramin Jehanbegloo was arrested from his house in Tehran on April 28, hours after arriving from New Delhi, where he was teaching at the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies since June last year. 

 According to his wife Azin, who teaches in Tehran, Jehanbegloo is being kept at an undisclosed detention centre for the past 10 days.

 Azin told The Telegraph on phone from Tehran that she had last been allowed to speak to her husband 10 days ago. She added that she hasnt seen him for the past three weeks and is worried about his future.

 We are just waiting helplessly. We have no idea when we will get to see him again, Azin said. 

 The Jehanbegloos have a nine-month-old girl, Afarin. He was so excited about spending time with his daughter, the professors wife said.

 The police, Azin said, gave no reason for why they were arresting her husband. All they said was that they were aware of his foreign contacts, built during his stay in India. 

 For the past 10 days, Azin has been desperately trying to speak to her husband, only to have her request turned down each time by the Iranian authorities.

 Under Iranian law, it is illegal to hire a lawyer till the accused is produced in court by the prosecuting agency. As the police have given no indication of when they intend to produce Jehanbegloo in court, Azin has been helplessly seeking unofficial legal advice from several quarters. It isnt safe to go back to the same legal expert for advice. So I have had to seek advice from several experts unofficially, she said.

 Azin believes the police may have misinterpreted some of the essays her husband had written and lectures Jehanbegloo had delivered during his tenure at the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies.

 He is an academic; a philosopher. It is possible his writings, or what he said, may have offended some people, particularly the religious clergy. However, I know my husband loves his country and would do nothing to harm it, Azin said.

 Her opinion was echoed by Jehanbegloos colleagues at the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies. They have written to Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad pleading for Jehanbegloos release.

 He is a very decent man, incapable of espionage. His case should be considered on humanitarian grounds, the letter, which was submitted yesterday to the Iranian ambassador, said.

 IAFs elephant tied to ground

 New Delhi, Aug. 11: The Indian Air Force has grounded more than half of the King Elephants the Ilyushin-76 heavy lift transport aircraft christened Gajraj in its fleet, throwing schedules for both military and disaster relief operations into a tizzy.

 The chronic shortage of the wide-bodied Ilyushin-76 compelled the air force to give up the idea of sending the aircraft to Cyprus to fly back Indian evacuees from Lebanon, a task that was afterwards entrusted to Air-India.

 Serviceability of the aircraft is low, air force sources confirmed. But we are trying to ensure that our tasks do not suffer. The IL-78s (refueller aircraft on the IL-76 platform) have been used as freighters and the AN-32 aircraft are taking on additional tasks.

 There are 12 IL-76 aircraft that are in the fleet of the air force. Maintenance schedules are designed to keep 10 operational at all times. But lack of spares, end of the 20-year lifecycle term for the aircrafts engines and dismantling of the Soviet Union have combined to ground more than half the fleet of the aircraft which were inducted from 1985 when Moscow was still the capital of the USSR and not Russia alone.

 When it became important for the IL-76 to be deployed alongside the navy to evacuate Indians from Lebanon last month, Israels restrictions on flying military aircraft in the region came in handy for air headquarters. That allowed the IAF to make a case to despatch civilian aircraft from Air-India. 

 The IAF is now hard put to find an aircraft in which to send Rs 10 crore worth of relief material that Prime Minister Manmohan Singh promised for war victims of Lebanon in Parliament this week a job that would normally have been tasked to an IL-76 as was done after Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans last year and after the quake in Indonesia earlier this year.

 More than 50 per cent of the IL-76s, the biggest aircraft in the IAF, have been officially designated AOG aircraft on ground. Each IL-76 has a crew of seven. Several of the crew in the two squadrons of the aircraft are now chronically underemployed for no fault of theirs.

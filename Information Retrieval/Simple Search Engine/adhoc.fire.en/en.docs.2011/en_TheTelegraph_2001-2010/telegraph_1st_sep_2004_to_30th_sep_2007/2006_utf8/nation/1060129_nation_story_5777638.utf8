 Arjun may pick Joshis brains

 - Earlier era report could figure at IIM meet

 MONOBINA GUPTA

 New Delhi, Jan. 28: Human resource development minister Arjun Singh may fall back on a report authored by V.K. Shunglu, former comptroller and auditor general, during the tenure of his BJP predecessor Murli Manohar Joshi when he meets IIM directors on Wednesday.

 Singh has scheduled the meeting to clear the air after the ministry barred IIM Bangalore from setting up a campus in Singapore.

 Two issues are on the agenda ? how to strengthen the autonomy of the institutes and improve their functioning.

 Joshi had authorised Shunglu in 2004 to look into the financial and academic issues of the IIMs when he was neck deep in battle with the B-schools for ordering an almost 50 per cent fee cut. The Shunglu report honed many of Joshis arguments.

 Singh had reversed Joshis fee-cut decision after the Congress-led government came to power in 2004. 

 Refusing permission for the Singapore campus recently, he said the institutes should first meet the internal demands and help build more campuses in India. There are six IIMs now ? in Ahmedabad, Calcutta, Bangalore, Lucknow, Kozhikode and Indore. 

 The Shunglu report had underlined the need to increase student intake. It said IIM Ahmedabad in 2003 had 464 students, Bangalore 576, Calcutta 548, Lucknow 469, Indore 122 and Kozhikode 125.

 Countering IIM Ahmedabads argument that a fee cut would hit the quality of education, Shunglu said: Staff costs in all the IIMs are high because none of the IIMs, in respect of postgraduate management programmes, are working to a recognised capacity. For example, IIM Ahmedabad has a recognised capacity of 254 or 508 students for two-year programmes. 

 Singh has also said IIMs should increase their student intake, but has left the decision to them. 

 An issue likely to come up at the meeting is the shortage of teachers. There is a perception among the IIMs that they are losing faculty members to private business schools who are willing to pay much more. The IIM salary structure is decided by the government. 

 Singh has argued that the IIMs were created out of government money and cannot function as floating corporate bodies. Shunglu made the same point: IIMs fixed assets were financed almost wholly from Government of India grants.

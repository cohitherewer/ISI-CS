 Shuffle in TV groups on table

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 27: If the current draft of the broadcast bill is passed, foreign channels would be compelled to carry some India-made content and Indian television companies made to part with stakes they hold in other media ventures.

 The bill seeks to set up a regulatory authority for television, on the lines of telecom regulator Trai. Apart from dealing with issues like obscenity, the proposed law could force big broadcasters like Zee to restructure their businesses.

 The information and broadcasting ministry has indicated it is keen to introduce the Broadcast Content Regulation Authority Bill in the monsoon session of Parliament.

 The draft is, however, still doing the rounds among ministries and will next be put up for cabinet approval.

 Sources said the proposed law would put a 20 per cent cap on cross-media holdings. This means that a television company would not be able to hold more than 20 per cent equity in another TV company, a radio station or a cable company.

 The idea seems to be to prevent any broadcast company from exercising editorial or managerial control over another electronic media business.

 In another clause meant to discourage television monopolies, no company would own more than 15 per cent of television channels seen in the country. The draft is also understood to contain a ceiling on the percentage of cable TV subscribers a big cable firm can sign up in a city.

 The bill stipulates that at least 15 per cent of content must be produced in India. 

 It is not immediately clear if this would apply to all foreign channels: existing downlinking guidelines insist that foreign news channels like BBC World Service should beam their standard, and not India-specific, version to this country.

 Till this aspect is clarified, observers assume the clause would be so drafted to ensure that Indian production talent is encouraged in the non-news category. It could mean foreign channels like Discovery would be compelled to carry some India-made programmes every week.

 The broadcasters will also be asked to take up some of the burden of the public broadcaster, Doordarshan.

 Every week, at least 10 per cent of all air time on a channel should be related to socially relevant themes. Similarly, 10 per cent of commercials would have to be public service messages.

 It is not yet clear if this would also apply to foreign entertainment channels.

 The Zee Group is reported to be re-structuring ahead of the anticipated law. Some other groups might have to shed equity in cable companies, if the present draft is accepted.

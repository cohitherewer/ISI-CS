 Karzais new chemistry

 New Delhi, April 11: After the ouster of the Taliban, Afghan leaders have often used Indian soil to distance themselves from Pakistan, a ritual that used to go down well with the hosts.

 For the first time now, Afghanistan President Hamid Karzai has turned this strategy upside down.

 Karzai, in what can only be a carefully crafted strategy, has used his second state visit to India to send conciliatory messages to President Pervez Musharraf as well as Pakistan. This, despite the fact that Musharraf recently rebuked Karzai after he accused the general of inciting the Taliban.

 Yesterday, Karzai referred to Musharraf as brother. Today, at a breakfast meeting with some journalists, he said Musharraf was a friend. 

 President Musharraf and I have a very close relationship. We are friends. Between friends, at times, there are moments when frank words are exchanged and that is all right.

 Sending the right signals to end hostility with the Pakistani leader seems to have the approval of India and, more important, the US. 

 Therefore, Karzai tried to emphasise commonalities, rather than differences, not only between Afghanistan and Pakistan but also between the latter and India. He proposed tri-polar cooperation between India, Pakistan and Afghanistan.

 This, he said, was very close to his heart and it had the support of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.

 His message for promoting such cooperation seemed to be to get politics out of the way as this was a peoples issue.

 Pakistans intelligentsia and its business community understand the need for this (tri-polar cooperation). But politics comes in the way, he said. 

 Stressing that the region should come closer together, Karzai called for easier transit trade, better economic cooperation and a higher degree of cultural exchanges.

 The Afghan President was not deterred by the fact that Pakistan allowed only one-way transit of goods ? from Afghanistan to India ? and not the other way around. There are one-off instances of transit from India to Afghanistan also. The important point to note is that a few years ago even this was not possible, he said.

 It is the desire of the Afghan people that India and Pakistan get over their problems or get around them so that the region can benefit, Karzai said. Politics and politicians must allow Track-II efforts in this direction.

 Karzai also defended Pakistans role in fighting terrorism. Yesterday, he said our brothers in Pakistan were also the victims of terrorism and, today, Karzai was even more sympathetic. The Afghan President said Pakistan was doing enough against the Taliban and has also lost soldiers in the fight.

 It was on the issue of Taliban that Musharraf had lashed out at Karzai recently after the Afghan leader claimed that Pakistan was providing logistics to the militia and organising their training.

 Despite reaching out to Pakistan, Delhi seemed happy with Karzais visit and decided to pump in more dollars for reconstruction in the war-ravaged country. India raised financial assistance by $50 million, taking it to $650 million.

 Delhi also welcomed Afghanistans entry into Saarc. Karzai said Afghanistan was part of central and South Asia, perhaps closer to South Asia. Kabul will be formally included in the group at the India summit early next year.

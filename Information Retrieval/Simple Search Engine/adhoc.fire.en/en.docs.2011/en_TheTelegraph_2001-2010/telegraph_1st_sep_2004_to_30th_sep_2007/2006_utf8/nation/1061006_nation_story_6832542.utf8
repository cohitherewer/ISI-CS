 Patch-up signal from BJP, Sena

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 5: BJP central leaders struck a conciliatory note today in the seat spat with the Shiv Sena as leaders of both parties indicated that their alliance was intact in Maharashtra.

 L.K. Advani and Rajnath Singh joined Sena veteran Manohar Joshi to emphasise that they were natural allies and old friends not likely to part easily. The local unit in Maharashtra is dealing with the Chimur Vidhan Sabha seat issue. We have full confidence that it will be sorted out soon, Rajnath said.

 Under the formula worked out during the last Assembly polls, Chimur should have gone the Senas way. But party MLA Vijay Wadettivar resigned the seat when he followed Narayan Rane to the Congress.The BJP weaned away Ramesh Gajbe, an Independent who had joined the Sena and was being projected as an alternative to Wadettivar. The Sena lost Wadettivar to Rane and Gajbe to us. They should step aside, said a BJP leader.

 BSP basks in poll stunner

 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY

 Mayavati

 Lucknow, Nov. 8: She didnt contest the local body polls, but Mayavati is gleefully watching the success of Independents in the results coming in since yesterday. 

 Her Bahujan Samaj Party, believed to have backed many of these candidates, is keeping a low profile on the results. The party is not claiming a swing in its favour. But the cautious line hasnt held back its temptation to declare that at least 130 of the 167 Independents who won the nagar panchayat race belonged to the party. For municipalities, its touting a figure of 20 out of 48.

 The numbers are a huge leap over the last polls when it won 10 seats in municipalities and 56 in nagar panchayats despite fielding candidates officially.

 They belong to us. The presence of such a huge number of Independents showed that they could win by cashing in on the name of Kanshi Ram (who recently passed away) and Mayavati, though we did not officially declare them to be our candidates, said BSP legislative party chief S.P. Maurya.

 The party is now taking stock of the growth in its vote-share in the local body polls, Maurya said, but added that the BSP wouldnt do anything to alert its political adversaries by making public announcements on the issue. We know people are smarter than propaganda.

 That the BSP the Independents it backed made a dent in urban pockets shows that it was able to harness the upper castes longing in favour of the party, Maurya said. He also defended the decision not to give tickets for the civic polls, saying the move would have unnecessarily created bad blood among ourselves.

 Yesterday, BSP general secretary S.C. Mishra had said: Many of these Independents actually belonged to the BSP as we decided not to give them tickets officially, he said.

 The success of Independents brought more parties rushing to own them today. The BJP claimed a share of these winners, as did the ruling Samajwadi Party, which said at least 10 per cent of them were its rebel candidates.

 We dont agree that most of them (Independents) belonged to the BSP. We dont see our strength weakening , said Samajwadi Party leader Shivpal Singh Yadav.

 So far, 167 Independents have won the polls for nagar panchayats, which have 417 seats. The figure is 48 in municipalities, where a total of 194 seats were up for grabs. Of the 12 municipal corporations in Uttar Pradesh, the BJP won eight, the Congress three and the Samajwadi Party one.

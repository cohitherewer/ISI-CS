 Budget boost to literacy

 MONOBINA GUPTA

 New Delhi, Feb. 10: The Union budget is set to give a huge boost to elementary education, particularly the Sarva Siksha Abhiyan ? a key project for universalisation of primary education.

 Launched in 2002, the scheme aims to ensure that all children in the 6-14 age group complete five years of primary school by 2007.

 The allocation for the Abhiyan is likely to go up from Rs 7,156 crore to Rs 11,000 crore, and for elementary education from Rs 11,219.79 crore to Rs 1,600 crore. Allocation for mid-day meals will increase from Rs 3,010 crore to Rs 4,345 crore.

 The UPAs common minimum programme underlines the importance of universalisation of elementary education. An increased allocation in this sector will also keep the Left, its key ally, happy.

 A high-level of state utilisation of funds for the scheme has also prompted the Centre to increase its share of money. In the past, more often than not, the Centre would put the state governments on the mat for not utilising resources allocated to them. It became a convenient alibi for Delhi to keep the allocations low.

 The programme stipulates a 75:25 ratio for distribution of money by the Centre and the states. Experts, however, maintain that an increased allocation like higher enrolment and retention rate ? though necessary inputs for the success of any project ? does not guarantee quality education.

 A recent national survey of rural households by a cluster of NGOs showed that although 93 per cent of children are enrolled, 41 per cent are unable to do a two-digit subtraction and 35 per cent in the 7-14 age group cannot read a simple paragraph. The report adds that 66 per cent of children cannot do division sums and 36 per cent can do neither subtraction nor division.

 Their ability to read or solve sums has not improved although teacher attendance has gone up. On an average, 75 per cent of teachers were found in schools on the days random checks were conducted.

 There is, however, a significant change in the states utilisation of funds. The government says the figures are positive. The states have used 64 per cent of funds given to them.

 But there are variations in state-level performances. The bad states have utilised less ? an indication of their indifference to education. On the other side there are good states like Jharkhand and Karnataka that have utilised 74 per cent and 79 per cent of funds, respectively. The list of good states also include Uttaranchal with a 64 per cent utilisation, Tamil Nadu 65 per cent, Sikkim 92 per cent, Chhattisgarh 82 per cent and Rajasthan 61 per cent.

 On the list of bad states are Delhi, Kerala and Maharashtra. Delhi has utilised 44 per cent of the funds, Kerala a little over 52 per cent and Maharashtra 50 per cent. Bihar has utilised only 43.5 per cent of its Rs 600-crore fund. Bengal with a 59 per cent utilisation comes in the not so bad category.

 Bihars overall performance in the Abhiyan, however, has been positive. Enrolment of children has increased and the retention rate has gone up. Ministry officials have an explanation for the states non-utilisation of funds. They have had two elections spanning three to four months when a model code of conduct was in effect. During this period, panchayat accounts get frozen, an official said.

 But the poor standard of education puts a question mark over how funds are being utilised in a state that has a 65 per cent high utilisation rate.

 Bhutan king on trade trip

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 24: India and Bhutan are likely to sign a trade and commerce agreement, which expired in 2005, when King Jigme Singye Wangchuk visits Delhi on Wednesday.

 The trade agreement is the lifeline for the landlocked Himalayan kingdom that thrives on trading ties with India. 

 After the agreement expired last year, Delhi and Thimpu extended it temporarily. Discussions were then held to sign a new pact that would be valid for another 10 years. 

 Officials hinted that much of the talks were over and they were ready to ink the document during Wangchuks visit.

 The king (in picture) would also sign two other agreements. 

 One would be for a new hydroelectric project under which India would generate 5 million units of power by the first half of next year.

 The other agreement would be a protocol on the Tala power agreement. India is constructing the 1,020-MW Tala project on the Wangchu river, which would be ready for commissioning after the protocol is signed.

 Crown prince Trongsa Penlog Dasho Jigme and trade minister Lyonpo Yeshey Zimba will accompany the king. 

 The king is expected to call on President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi.

 India will also talk about security concerns regarding Bhutan. The growing influence of Left wing extremism has been a cause for bother in Delhi. 

 India wants to strengthen its border infrastructure in Bhutan. 

 This will require building a road network and establishing better communication links.

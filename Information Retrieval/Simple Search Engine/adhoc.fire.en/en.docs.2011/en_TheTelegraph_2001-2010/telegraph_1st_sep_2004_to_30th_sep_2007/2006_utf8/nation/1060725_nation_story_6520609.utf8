 New Delhi, July 24: Parched and shell-shocked on the Blue Line between Israel and Lebanon, Indian and Ghanaian soldiers with a UN mission in the warzone are pleading with Tel Aviv for water to slake their thirst because there have been no supplies in the semi-desert terrain for six days now, according to information reaching Indian Army headquarters.

 The United Nations Interim Force in Israel and Lebanon (UNIFIL) has a UN chapter VI mandate to observe, monitor and patrol the Blue Line which marks the points till which the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) withdrew after their occupation of South Lebanon from 1982 to 2000. 

 The UNIFIL does not have a mandate to intervene or to render humanitarian assistance. But it has been active in aid work.

 Now, the UNIFILs troops are in need of humanitarian assistance themselves.

 Lets hope the hostilities cease, as the devastation of Lebanon is to be seen to be believed. It will take years and tons of money to rebuild and rehabilitate, the UNIFILs deputy force commander Brigadier Jai Prakash Nehra, told The Telegraph in a conversation.

 There are 673 Indian soldiers of the armys 5 Sikh battalion group manning posts on the Blue Line that demarcates the border between the two countries. But firing from Israeli gunboats in the Mediterranean, air strikes and attack by the artillery have damaged supply lines to such an extent that convoys that carry life-giving water and fuel to the outposts have not been able to make it to the camps since July 15.

 Some 1,900 troops of the UNIFIL are now preparing to pull back to safer locations and are just waiting for a word from headquarters. 

 Brigadier Nehra said from Naqoura, just about two km north of the frontage with Israel, that if and when UNIFILs posts become dangerous, appropriate action will be taken by us.

 The Indian soldiers are still marginally better off than their colleagues from Ghana because the frontage of their sector covers not only the border with Israel but also that of Syria. The Ghanaian soldiers are in the thick of the shelling and the air strikes.

 Brigadier Nehra said that on the 13th day of the conflict there is a perceptible decrease in the intensity of shelling by both sides. The IDF were apparently focusing on small-scale, localised ground actions in the vicinity of three villages ? Marwahin, Maround Al Ras and Bint Jubayl ? the last one is allegedly a stronghold of the Hizbollah. The villages are in the sector overseen by the Ghana battalion.

 Israel has amassed troops on its side of the border that seem to be waiting for order to go across but this was likely to be a costly venture both in terms of men and material.

Victory rally at kings doorstep

 Kathmandu, Nov. 10: Maoists took control of Nepals capital today to celebrate yet again the peoples victory. For many of the rebel cadre, it was also a time of changeover from guns to government and power games. 

 Ten days from now, the rebels, who have held and fought with guns for 11 years will lay them down and leave their base areas and command zones for life in UN-monitored temporary cantonments. 

 Another 10 days and some of their leaders will join the interim government and sit in the ministers chambers at the Singha Durbar secretariat. It is a change whose meaning has not quite sunk in among the rebels who had known only guns, fights and a hard life in jungles and mountains. I have been told that well surrender arms, but I dont know what follows next, said a young rebel from Lalitpur district. 

 Maoist chief Prachanda wasnt at the rally nor were any other of the top leaders who were all busy in parleys with the Girija Prasad Koirala government or with UN mediators. It was a much smaller rally than the one the Maoists held on the same ground in June to celebrate the victory of the jan andolan (peoples movement) of May, which forced King Gyanendra to reinstate the Koirala government he had sacked. That victory began the peace process that culminated in the historic agreement signed by the Seven-Party Alliance and the Maoists last Tuesday midnight. 

 But the absence of the top leaders did little to dampen the spirit of the thousands of people, the majority of them young boys and girls, who were there at the rally at Ratna Park, only a short distance from the royal palace. 

 That short distance symbolised what the Maoist leaders called the core of their victory. As Comrade Pravakar, one of the deputy commanders of the Maoist Peoples Liberation Army, said to long and loud cheers from the crowd it was a peoples victory over the feudal forces represented by the king. 

 But why did the Maoists agree with the other parties to wait till the elections of the constituent assembly in order to ensure the end of the monarchy? The leaders talked of imperialist plans to retain the monarchy but vowed to end it through democratic means. The king doesnt matter in Nepal any more; no one does except the people, said a top leader of the Kathmandu district committee of the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist). 

 While the Maoists celebrated, others resented their claim to the victory. It is untrue for anyone to claim the sole credit for the victory, said Ram Chandra Poudyal, senior leader of Prime Minister Koiralas Nepali Congress party. All sides have contributed in equal measure to the peace agreement. 

 Poudyal pointed out that the Nepali Congress, too, was planning to organise victory rallies and inform the masses all over the country of the peace agreement. It was natural for Poudyal to say that his leader, the Prime Minister, showed real statesmanship in steering the agreement through. But, large sections of the people here felt that Koirala, at 86, had once again become the hero of the people of Nepal, just as Prachanda was to his followers. 

 There was nothing heroic, though, about the feelings in the other major political camp. The Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist), the second largest democratic party in the country, is clearly sulking. That was evident from the note of dissent given by Madhav Kumar Nepal, secretary-general of the party, to the peace agreement. 

 The feeling in the UML, as the party is popularly known, is that, while Koirala and Prachanda stole the limelight, it was left out in the cold. The party is also sceptical of the Maoists promise of allowing a fear-free election to the constituent assembly. That is why the Maoists declined to join the 10-party peace committee, a party leader said.

 Inside a twisted train coach

 Jagged edges of twisted metal today, the first class coaches through which the blasts tore through last evening, have now been pulled to Kandivli carshed. The bloodstains have been washed away as much by water and brooms wielded by human hands as by the overnight rain.

 Coaches 628A and 864A were just a 100 feet ahead of Matunga station on track No. 3 last evening when the explosive ? most probably RDX ? blew a wall clean off the floor and shredded limbs from torsos. The VR 645 local had left Churchgate at 17.57.

 Shards of glass and pieces of metal were still being removed from patients in KEM hospital this evening who were commuters in the coaches mostly headed home. 

 We have not lost any forensic evidence, Mumbai police sources claimed as they began piecing together the murderous conspiracy.

 The VR 645 Fast was not supposed to stop at Matunga. It was whizzing past the stations platform No. 3 and was just under a foot overbridge when the explosion engulfed coach 864A in smoke. That was close to 18.30.

 The right wall of the car was lifted clean off the floor and if it were not for the markings, it might well be mistaken for a part of the roof. The seats are ripped apart. 

 Some of the backrests are still erect and leaning against what were the wooden and iron partitions inside the compartment.

 One rack running the length of the wall that is still intact on the far side has caved in at two places. Another has been pushed out of its angles and is dipping to the floor like a horizontal U. An iron grille has been blown off and was lying on track No. 4. On it was somebodys ankle-high black boot from the right foot.

 Overhead wires were dangling and lengths of cable are on the floor. The plywood pasted on iron walls has ripped apart. Two ceiling fans were on the floor. On track No. 4 bloodstain and rust have meshed. A white garment ? part of a kameez or a kurta ? is a washed pink from the rain.

 Just behind the first class car was the ladies car. Nothing has happened to it. But a panel of the coach 864As sliding doors is suspended from the wall that has gone to the ceiling.

 The inside of 864A is not like the burnt carcass and inside of the S-6 Sabarmati Express through which a fireball rolled in Godhra, Gujarat, in February 2002. The S-6 was charred and blackened with soot. Here, the insides have not been discoloured, They are just mutilated, twisted out of shape, blown, broken and battered.

 The KEM Hospitals records show 35 patients were taken to the hospital from this train by 19.30 last evening.

 Mumbai, Aug. 12: Jet Airways has confirmed that Amin Asmin Tariq, one of the suspects held in the plot to blow up planes, was an employee with the airline since March 2006. 

 Jet Airways said Tariq, who holds a British passport, was transferred to the airline from G4S, earlier known as Securicor. 

 The airline said that it has suspended Tariq, who has not reported for duty for the past few days, pending a full investigation.

 Tariq was a passenger relations executive who helped passengers with check-in formalities. 

 G4S is an agency that provides services to airlines such as British Airways, Singapore Airlines and Thai Airways.

 The airline had a contract with G4S for passenger service representatives and absorbed Tariq when it ended the contract with this agency. 

 Under British employment legislation, TUPEE (Transfer of Undertakings Protection of Employment Regulations) was applicable, which meant that Jet had to absorb those employees who had been employed by G4S before terminating the contract.

 As per UK employment guidelines, once the contract was terminated with G4S, Jet Airways had to compulsorily absorb nine people from the agency and Tariq was among them, a company official said. All G4S employees had been cleared by the UK governments security agency to work at the airport.

 It can take up to 12 weeks for an individual to obtain security clearance to work in Heathrow following references from five different sources. 

 A few months ago, the US had asked for a complete dossier on Jet Airways following allegations of its involvement with Dawood Ibrahim who has been declared a terrorist by the Amercian government.

 The Indian government had given a security clean chit to Jet.

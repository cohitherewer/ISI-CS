 Omkara clicks in US, not India

 ANANYA SENGUPTA

 Mumbai, Aug. 7: Omkara the much-awaited film based on Shakespeares Othello has not impressed at the box office in India, but is in the US top 20.

 Analysts said the film was expected to get a 90 per cent-plus start but the opening day figures were dismal: between 25 and 65 per cent.

 In the US, however, it collected $427,000 in three days and found a place in Varietys Top 20 US Box Office charts.

 But this again is not comparable to figures of earlier films like Krrish and Fanaa. (See chart) Frankly, it hasnt done too well, says analyst Taran Adarsh.

 Word spreads faster than fire these days and the mouthful of expletives and cuss words proved a major deterrent, keeping the family audiences at bay. As for the masses, Omkara is not the kind of cinema theyd take to instantly. Agreed, the film appealed to the elite, but thats definitely not enough for a film that carries an expensive price tag. You ought to have the active participation of the masses to qualify for the hit status, adds Adarsh.

 But the director himself is happy with the box office results in the US. This just goes to show you dont require family audiences to make a film hit. Audiences have really moved on. Omkara has set a precedent. It has proved that a film of this genre can earn and recover money, says Vishal Bharadwaj, who had won acclaim with Maqbool, based on another Shakespeare play, Macbeth.

 Adarsh says: Ideally, with a cast like the one in Omkara and the tremendous hype surrounding the film, the film shouldve fetched 150,000-plus in its opening weekend in the UK and 60,000-plus Australian dollars in its opening weekend in Australia.

 Ajay Devgan, Kareena Kapoor, Saif Ali Khan and Viveik Oberoi are part of the films star line-up.

 In the UK, it managed a box office collection of 91,294 in the opening weekend. Gross collections in Australia for the same weekend were 34,571 Australian dollars.

 See, a film like Mann that hasnt done too well in India, did well in the UK. Ditto for Dil Se. So I cant tell you why and how the film did well in the US as compared to India, says Adarsh.

 But Bharadwaj has an answer. Shakespeares work is beyond time. It will always be contemporary. Thats why it has clicked. It will take some time to catch on, but this is a different kind of cinema and it will be appreciated.

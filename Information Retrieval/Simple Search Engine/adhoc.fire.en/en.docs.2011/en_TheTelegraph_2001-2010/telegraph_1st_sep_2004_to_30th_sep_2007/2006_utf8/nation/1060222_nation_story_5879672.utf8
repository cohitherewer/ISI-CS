 Refusal cloud on round table

 MANAN KUMAR

 New Delhi, Feb. 21: A flood of refusals is threatening to swallow the PMOs plan to hold a round table on Kashmir.

 The latest to spurn the invite from the Prime Ministers Office was the moderate faction of the Hurriyat Conference, a conglomerate of 23 parties led by Mirwaiz Umer Farooq. 

 Hardline Hurriyat leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani, Sajjad Lone of the Peoples Conference, Shabir Ahmad Shah of the Democratic Freedom Party and the JKLFs Yasin Malik had earlier refused to attend the conference, scheduled for February 25, on different grounds. 

 With the National Conference and the Peoples Democratic Party also showing reluctance, the PMO is in a bind now.

 While announcing the round table with Kashmiri mainstream leaders as well as separatist leaders in a fresh bid to resolve the Kashmir issue on February 15, the PMO had asked the home ministry to organise the meeting.

 A senior official involved in the negotiations confided that with so many organisations spurning the offer, the bigger problem before the PMO is to find a face-saver.

 It is very difficult to put off the conference now. But at the same time, it is all the more difficult to go ahead. In the absence of those out of the electoral process, it will be a mockery of the whole idea, which was to bring people having divergent views to the same table, the official said.

 Sources in the home ministry said though they were expecting a negative response from the hawks, they were surprised by the rush of refusals.

 The sources said the PMO misread the feedback from security agencies and should have proceeded with more caution.

 ISI moles in Assam 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Guwahati, Sept. 6: Waving copies of a purportedly confidential report of the vigilance and anti-corruption department as proof, the AGP today said suspected ISI agents were given employment in the social welfare department along with scores of other undeserving job aspirants during the Congresss previous term in Dispur.

 Quoting from the report, AGP general secretary Dilip Kumar Saikia said over 300 people bribed their way to jobs in the department when excise minister Gautam Roy headed it as part of the first Tarun Gogoi ministry.

 An indignant Roy said the AGP manufactured the vigilance report. The report is a fake one and the allegations are all baseless. I will reveal all tomorrow. 

 The report flung by the AGP at the Congress states that as many as 250 of the 300-odd beneficiaries of illegal appointments during Roys tenure as the social welfare minister are from a particular community. Deputy superintendent of police (vigilance) Harmohan Kakati conducted the inquiry and submitted the report in July 2005.

 The AGP distributed copies of the report at the news conference. It is learnt from my secret source that of the 250 candidates, some suspected ISI agents are (sic) also appointed, the report says.

 As if fearing that the allegation wont be taken seriously, the report actually mentions that the presence of ISI agents in a government department is very dangerous for the security of the state. 

 The report claims that no departmental procedure was followed during the recruitment process. It names C.R. Kalita, the then director of the social welfare department, and a lower-ranked official, I. Alam, as the kingpins of the scam.

 The posts were allegedly not advertised in any newspaper, nor did the department interview any candidate from the list of job aspirants registered with the employment exchange.

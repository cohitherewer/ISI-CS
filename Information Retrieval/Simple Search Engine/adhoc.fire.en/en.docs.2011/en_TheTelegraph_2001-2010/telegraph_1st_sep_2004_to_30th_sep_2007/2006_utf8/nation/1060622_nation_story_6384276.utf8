 SC orders fresh counselling for MBBS

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 21: The Supreme Court has directed fresh counselling for admission to the MBBS course under the all-India quota as some students did not find a place on the merit list because of faulty tabulation of marks by the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE).

 A vacation bench headed by Justice A.R. Lakshmanan asked the CBSE, which conducts an all-India test to fill 15 per cent seats in government medical colleges, to start a fresh counselling session from Monday on the basis of a revised merit list.

 The directive came after a student pointed out that about 25 names had been left out of the merit list because of the CBSEs mistake.

 The board, which has already conducted the counselling of about 500 students, admitted to the error and said it has prepared a revised merit list.

 The placement on the merit list is important as students higher up get a preference in the choice of medical colleges. The students who have already appeared for counselling and given their choices would have to go through the process again according to their fresh positions on the merit list.

 The court asked the CBSE to inform the students about the revised list and also publish it on its website. The board has been told to place advertisements in the media about cancellation of the first counselling session.

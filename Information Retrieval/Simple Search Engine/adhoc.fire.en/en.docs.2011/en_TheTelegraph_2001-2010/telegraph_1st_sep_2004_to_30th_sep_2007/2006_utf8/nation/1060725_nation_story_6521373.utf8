 Profit bill parade to Presidents door

 New Delhi, July 24: The battle over the office-of-profit bill bristled with bile today after the Opposition marched to Rashtrapati Bhavan and urged the President to sound the Supreme Court on the issue.

 The Congress blasted the unprecedented move by the BJPs narrow and frustrated minds, saying it betrayed an utter disregard of the principles of parliamentary democracy.

 BJP leader Sushma Swaraj hit back by pointing to the Centres unacceptable plan of sending the bill back to Kalam in its original form, ignoring his reservations.

 The bill seeks to exempt certain posts from the office of profit tag, thus pre-empting MPs being disqualified for holding them. Kalam had returned it to Parliament after it was passed the first time, questioning ? among other things ? the bid to apply it with retrospective effect.

 The government, however, has decided to get the bill passed without changes, thus presenting Kalam with no choice but to sign it.

 Yet, embarrassed by the Presidents note, the Centre has been desperately working for a consensus before tabling the bill again ? a move scuppered by the Oppositions memorandum to Kalam.

 We urge you to seriously consider referring the factum of the constitutional validity of this bill to the Supreme Court, the memorandum said. In case the government contends that the President can only seek advisory opinion on the aid and advice of the council of ministers, this question itself could be referred to the Supreme Court.

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and the minister of state in the PMO, Prithviraj Chavan, met cabinet ministers P.R. Das Munshi, Pranab Mukherjee and Suresh Pachauri to discuss the fate of the bill this afternoon. Das Munshi told reporters the bill would be tabled in the Rajya Sabha as it is.

 He added, It looks like they (Opposition) are now searching for a forum other than Parliament?. We treat their strategy with the contempt it deserves.

 The government should consider our proposals before advising us, Swaraj retorted.

 House stalled

 The first day of the monsoon session of Parliament was adjourned today over rising prices and terror attacks. Speaker Somnath Chatterjee gave up after holding out for 40 minutes as the Opposition stalled proceedings demanding suspension of question hour to discuss inflation.

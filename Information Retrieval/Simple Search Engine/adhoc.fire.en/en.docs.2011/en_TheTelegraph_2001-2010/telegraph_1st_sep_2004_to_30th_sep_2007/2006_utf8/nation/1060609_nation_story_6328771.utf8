The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Dabba XI vs Brazil

 SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI

 Mumbai, June 8: Having charmed Prince Charles, the dabbawallahs of Mumbai are setting their sights on the kings of soccer.

 Tomorrow, as the World Cup kicks off in Germany, a team of street football players from Brazil will meet the dabbawallahs for a game of Futsal in Mumbai. 

 Futsal is an indoor version of football sanctioned by Fifa. The name is derived from the Portuguese phrase futebol de sal?, which means football for a large room.

 The tournament ? titled Defend Your Turf ? will be played in a five-a-side street football format in Delhi, Bangalore and Mumbai. The Indian team that scores the maximum goals gets to play the finals in Calcutta on June 17.

 The boys from Brazil ? handpicked by Futebol Profissional, the premier football association of Rio de Janeiro ? are the best in the freestyle street football category.

 The Dabbawallah XI, which got the green signal from their association president Raghunath Medge to play tomorrows match, have been selected with the same military precision that marks their delivery of homemade lunch boxes to millions of office- and school-goers across Mumbai and its suburbs.

 Forbes magazine has given a 6-sigma rating to the dabbawallah association, which means that only one among 6 million dabbas fail to arrive.

 Our boys are practising hard across the town and though we know that Brazilians are great footballers, we will show them that we dabbawallahs, too, are pretty focused on our job at hand, Medge said. 

 The task of picking the players has been onerous, given that the association has nearly 4,000 dabbawallahs on its roles.

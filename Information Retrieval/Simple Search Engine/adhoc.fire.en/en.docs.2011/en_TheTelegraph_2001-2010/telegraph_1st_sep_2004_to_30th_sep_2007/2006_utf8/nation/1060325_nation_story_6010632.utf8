 Tainted ministers

 New Delhi, March 24: The Supreme Court today referred to a Constitution bench the question whether a person with a criminal background can be appointed a minister .

 The court issued notices to the Centre and states on a PIL challenging the appointments of railway minister Lalu Prasad, coal minister Shibu Soren and some others.

 Having regard to the magnitude of the problem besides its vital importance, it is proper that the writ petition be heard by a Constitution bench, a division bench headed by chief justice Y.K. Sabharwal said.

 It directed listing of the matter for hearing after the summer vacation but asked the Centre and states to file their responses in four weeks.

 Would you appoint a person a judge or a member of Election Commission if any charge is pending against him? Sabharwal asked the Centre, which is opposing the petition.

 Human bomb in net

 New Delhi, May 28 (PTI): Police today arrested a man who had allegedly looted Rs 40 lakh from a bank by posing as a human bomb earlier this month.

 Sandeep Bhatnagar, a travel agent, had apparently thought up the ruse to pay off his debts. He was under a lot of debt and therefore, he looted the bank, deputy commissioner of police (west district) Robin Hibu said.

 After clearing his debts, he went on a vacation to Thailand with a girl. We are trying get more details about the trip, Hibu said.

 Bhatnagar, with two others, had robbed the Unit Trust of India Bank in Vikaspuri, west Delhi, on May 8. 

 The accomplices are absconding.

 The police said Rs 10 lakh and 600 euros were found on Bhatnagar. The rest of the money had been distributed among the other two, whose identities have not been disclosed.

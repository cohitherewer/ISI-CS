 Star notes in RBI kitty

 New Delhi, May 9 (PTI): The Reserve Bank of India has introduced a new series of star banknotes, which will be issued in Rs 10, Rs 20 and Rs 50 denominations to replace defective notes.

 The new series of notes would look like the existing ones in the Mahatma Gandhi series but would have an additional character ? a *(star) in the number panel, an RBI release said today.

 These notes have been issued as part of efforts to benchmark the RBIs procedures with international best practices.

 The RBI has proposed to adopt the star series numbering system for replacement of defectively printed banknotes, the release said.

 Packets with star series notes will have 100 pieces as usual but not in serial order.

 The series would be legal tender and members of the public may freely accept and use these notes, the release added.

 To identify the note packets containing star series notes, the bands on such packets would clearly indicate the presence of these notes in the packet, it added.

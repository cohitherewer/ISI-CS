 Bangalore, Oct. 4: As pro-Kannadiga agitators forced it shut for the second time in six months, Bangalores infotech industry today found a new reason to speak of shifting from the countrys IT hub.

 The industry, already frustrated with successive state governments lack of interest in improving infrastructure, was upset at the ruling coalitions tacit support to todays bandh over the Belgaum issue.

 We are upset with the government for encouraging bandhs. Lack of infrastructure is a major concern and the government should focus on this instead of adding to the chaos and creating losses, an IT executive said.

 The state-wide general strike shut down the ITeS industry except for a handful of BPOs where employees worked non-stop from last night till the bandh ended at 6 pm and a fresh shift could be brought in.

 The two-day shutdown in April, after Kannada film icon Rajkumars death, triggered vandalism at offices, street riots and police firing, causing five deaths.

 The fear of violence had loomed large today, too, as the bandh was called on a pro-Kannadiga issue that of Belgaum and several other Marathi-speaking areas continuing to be a part of Karnataka.

 Glass-fronted office buildings shielded themselves with nets to block any brickbats that protesters might throw. 

 But the state stayed peaceful with police detaining several thousand activists.

 All offices, hotels and cinemas stayed closed and public transport kept off the streets. Sitting at home wasnt pleasant either as the cable TV association joined the 12-hour bandh and aired only Kannada channels.

 To the IT industry, the forced shutdowns, coming on top of the poor infrastructure, were the last straw.

 The roads are still not motorable and promised works havent been taken up, a tech majors president said on the condition of anonymity. With Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Bengal inviting us, it is little surprise that new BPOs and IT units are being set up outside Bangalore.

 There have been reports about tech workers in Bangalore spending more time travelling to and from work. There have been many forced holidays, too. We are looking at productivity levels and man-hours lost very closely, another IT executive said. Once other states start bridging the gap, it would be very unwise for any company to invest further in brand Bangalore.

 Expatriates working in IT said Bangalore had only two pluses its excellent weather and cosmopolitan culture. The second can be threatened if pro-Kannadiga agitations continue to hold the city hostage.

 The bandh had been called in protest against the Centres withdrawal of its affidavit telling the Supreme Court that Maharashtras petition seeking the transfer of Marathi-speaking areas from Karnataka was not maintainable.

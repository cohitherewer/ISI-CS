 New Delhi, July 5: The Supreme Court has pulled up the Centre for not releasing the salary of doctors who went on strike against reservations, pointing out that it had promised no action would be taken if they returned to work.

 What is this Mr Vahanvati? The government says something at one point in time and.? when the government came on May 29, you were on your knees. After the strike is over, you say no work no pay, a bench headed by Justice Arijit Pasayat told the solicitor-general.

 Please ask your government to be a model employer.

 On the health and family welfare ministry refusing to release the salaries on the ground that no work meant no pay, the court asked: Was this concept of (no work) no pay not known to the government (at the time of making the commitment)?

 Additional solicitor-general Gopal Subramaniam had told the court no punitive action would be taken against the doctors if they called off the strike, the bench observed.

 The court had recorded Subramaniams submission in its May 31 order, noting that the government shall not take any punitive action for whatever has been done till the strikes etc are called off. 

 Apart from this order, the doctors are also banking on a statement by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh that no action would be taken against them.

 Subramaniam did not argue the case today and solicitor-general G.E. Vahanvati came instead. After he sought time to seek instructions from the government, the court posted the matter for hearing on July 17. 

 The court, however, directed that internship of medicos on strike for over 15 days should not be deemed to be extended so as to make them ineligible for admission to post-graduate courses. 

 The strike was on from May 14 to June 3.

 Resident doctors at AIIMS and Maulana Azad Medical College had moved court on June 30 against the government, pointing out that it was not sparing them, though the court had directed it not to take punitive action if they called off their strike.

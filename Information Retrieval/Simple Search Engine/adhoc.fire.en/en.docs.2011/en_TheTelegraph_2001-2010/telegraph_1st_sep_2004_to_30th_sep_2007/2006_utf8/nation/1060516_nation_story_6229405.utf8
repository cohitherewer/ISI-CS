 Free study hits numbers wall

 New Delhi, May 15: A high enrolment rate in schools appears to have come in the way of the Centres plans to spend more on elementary education.

 The finance ministry and the Planning Commission are reportedly trying to stall the free and compulsory education bill on the plea that 93 per cent children are already enrolled in schools.

 Both the finance ministry and the Planning Commission are resisting the bill on the grounds that 93 per cent children in the country are already enrolled in schools, said Anita Rampal of the Central Advisory Board of Education.

 This is not true. A large number of children may be enrolled but they are not in school.

 The lobby pushing the bill has alleged that Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia was behind the efforts to derail the bill.

 He is throttling the human resource development ministry, Rampal claimed. The real issue is financial. But how can education policies get counterposed by financial consideration?

 The cost of implementing the bill will range between Rs 54,000 crore and Rs 73,000 crore. This will be in addition to the current expenditure of Rs 47,000 crore on the Sarva Siksha Abhiyan.

 In its last budget, the UPA government had introduced a 2 per cent education cess. The common minimum programme promises to allocate 6 per cent of GDP on primary education.

 Three years ago, the NDA government had passed the 86th constitution amendment bill to ensure every child in the 6-14 age group has the right to free education.

 But this can take effect only after the government passes the free and compulsory education bill currently under discussion.

 Ahluwalias argument hinges on a survey done by Pratham and a host of other organisations claiming a 93 per cent enrolment in schools.

 I have just visited Rajasthan where in village after village children are missing from schools, Rampal said.

 It is not just the Centre, even states are not too keen on the bill as it will bind them to spend more on education.

 The bill lays down rules for appointment of teachers and their salaries. The bill rules against the appointment of para teachers, Rampal said.

 Last September, the HRD ministry had held talks with state education secretaries on the bill. But they said they needed more time for discussion.

 At present, the cost of the Sarva Siksha Abhiyan is borne by the Centre and states in the ratio 75:25. The Centre plans to make it 50:50 from the 11th plan that will come into effect from 2007.

 Many states that have a funds crunch want the Centre to bear the entire cost of implementing the bill.

 Chennai/New Delhi, July 31: The CBI today filed a charge-sheet against Jayalalithaa in a decade-old case, accusing her of accepting money to hand out plum government posts.

 The ADMK chief allegedly received over Rs 2 core in demand drafts and cash on her birthday in 1992, during her first term as chief minister, from MLAs and other party leaders appointed heads of government corporations and other official bodies.

 The CBI filed the 2,000-page charge-sheet in the court of the principal sessions judge, citing 149 witnesses.

 Jayalalithaa is accused of receiving 89 demand drafts and Rs 15 lakh in cash, which were credited to her savings accounts with Canara Bank, Mylapore branch, Chennai. She had claimed them as gifts in her income-tax returns.

 Jayalalithaa has been charged under the Prevention of Corruption Act for receiving valuables from persons with whom she had official dealings when she was chief minister. Two of her party colleagues, former ministers K.A. Sengottaiyan and Alagu Thirunavukkarasu, have been charged for abetting the offence.

 CBI sources said that of the 57 names under which the 89 demand drafts were bought, 12 turned out to be fictitious. Another 12 persons denied buying the drafts, and only 33 confirmed they had bought and presented the drafts to Jayalalithaa.

 Of them, 21 were heads of government bodies, doing official business with chief minister Jayalalithaa.

 The case was registered in 1996 on the complaint of the director-general (income-tax) and was handed over to the CBI by the previous DMK regime. The Tamil Nadu Speaker had yesterday granted the agency permission to prosecute Jayalalithaa, an MLA.

 At todays budget debate in the Assembly, ADMK members raised an uproar and had to be evicted after the state finance minister accused Jayalalithaa of having run away from the House at the end of her speech.

 Jayalalithaa had accused the DMK of rigging the May election and asked chief minister Karunanidhi if he planned to go away to America to hide after having made unimplementable promises to win the polls. The two-hour harangue over, she walked out of the House, drawing the barb from the DMK minister.

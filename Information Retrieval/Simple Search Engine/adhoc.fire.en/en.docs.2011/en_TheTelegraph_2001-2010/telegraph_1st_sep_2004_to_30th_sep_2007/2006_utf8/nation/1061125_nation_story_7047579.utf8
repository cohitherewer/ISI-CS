 Menon hint at Lanka hiccup

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chennai, Nov. 24: Foreign secretary Shiv Shankar Menon today hinted he was not happy with the outcome of his trip to Sri Lanka yesterday to convey Indias deep concern and anguish at the recent spurt in violence against the islands Tamils.

 Let Colombo speak for itself, he said sharply when asked how Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapakse had reacted to Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs message.

 Menon made a stopover in Chennai this morning on his way back to Delhi and drove straight to the secretariat to brief chief minister M. Karunanidhi.

 National security adviser M.K. Narayanan flew in from Delhi for the meeting, also attended by Union IT minister Dayanidhi Maran.

 Narayanan later told reporters the one-hour meeting was part of the normal process of consultation between the Prime Minister and the chief minister. We will continue this exercise, he said.

 Menon said India wants a solution that addresses the concerns of all groups on the island, where renewed fighting between Tamil rebels and the military has left thousands dead in the past year. Our goal is to arrive at a solution that meets the aspirations of all the people of Sri Lanka.

 How the goal is to be achieved is an evolving process which we are discussing among ourselves and that is why we have come here, he added.

 Asked if the food supplies offered by India to the islands Tamils might be routed through the Red Cross instead of the Lankan government, Narayanan said that would be decided when the need to send humanitarian aid arose.

 Whether sending food is necessary at all would become clear during Rajapakses visit to Delhi next week, he added.

 The Prime Minister had recently mentioned the 7,000-tonne food offer in a letter written to Karunanidhi.

 Asked if the chief minister had suggested any fresh proposal to Singh that he wants taken up with Rajapakse, Menon said, Nothing at all. The Government of India and Government of Tamil Nadu hold identical views (on Lanka) and there is no particular necessity for any new issue to be raised.

 Earlier, Menon and Narayanan discussed the refugee influx from Lanka with chief secretary L.K. Tripathy.

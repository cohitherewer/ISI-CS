 Puja attack rerun 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, Oct. 22: Hours after the death of Bikram Jha, a 20-year-old beaten up by Kali Puja organisers in Calcutta for not paying the subscription they demanded, five members of a Nadia family, including two children, were attacked for the same reason.

 Joydeb Ghosh, 35, and his brother Ranjit, 30, are now in Chakdah State General Hospital. They were beaten up with rods and a revolver butt and kicked and punched. Joydebs wife Sudipta and their children Amita, 13, and Subhajit, 11 were released this morning.

 Police said members of Padma Villa Club had asked for Rs 500 from the milk trader. Around 11 last night, his brother went to the club with Rs 150.

 Ten youths, who were drunk and dancing to the tunes of Hindi songs in front of the pandal, beat him up and dragged Ranjit home, said an officer of Chakdah police station, about 200 km from Calcutta.

 A week ago, Sudipta had told them that they could not afford Rs 500. She was threatened with dire consequences.

 Joydeb became nervous as the organisers did not approach him a second time for the subscription. So, he sent Ranjit with the money last night. 

 Outside his house, Ranjit was beaten up again. One of the youths whipped out a one-shot pistol from his hip and used the butt as a club. Joydeb and Sudipta, who rushed to his rescue, were also beaten up. 

 Some of them held me while the others hit me with rods. They slapped and kicked me, Sudipta said. Her children were not spared. The goons left around midnight, but one of them left his gun behind. 

 They returned to retrieve the pistol an hour later and broke open the Ghoshes main door. Joydeb, Ranjit and Sudipta were applying first aid when they were attacked again.

 The police today said all the club members are absconding. We will arrest them soon, promised Nadia superintendent of police Ajay Nand.

 Jha, an agent of a multinational bank living in Kidderpore, was attacked even though a premonition had made him file a police complaint. 

 Some members of the local Kali Puja committee had been picked up by the police only to be released the following day, allegedly following political intervention.

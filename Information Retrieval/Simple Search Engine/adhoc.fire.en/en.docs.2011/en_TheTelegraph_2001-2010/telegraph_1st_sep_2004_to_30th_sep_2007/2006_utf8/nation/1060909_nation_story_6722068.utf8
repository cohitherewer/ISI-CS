 Dhanbad, Sept. 8: Rescue workers today fished out charred bodies of 45 miners who died after explosions in a Bharat Coking Coal Limited (BCCL) mine on Wednesday evening.

 A search is on for five more bodies at the 17th level of the Bhatdih mine in West Jharia. Fifty miners were inside the mine when the blasts occurred.

 Soon after the bodies were taken out, the BCCL management gave appointment letters to family members of the deceased, besides announcing compensation of Rs 3 lakh each.

 Coal India Limited (CIL) chairman Shashi Kumar has set up a three-member panel comprising company director (personnel) Mohammad Salimuddin, director (technical) Laxman Jha and managing director of the Central Mine Planning and Design Institute S. Choudhary, to inquire into the mishap.

 The panel would submit its report within a fortnight, BCCL chairman-cum-managing director Partho Bhattacharya told The Telegraph.

 Official sources said 57 miners had turned up for work on the second shift, which started at 4 pm, but four did not enter the mine and left without informing anybody. Three miners managed to escape.

 CIL officials said there were two explosions in the space of five minutes, followed by a blaze in the depths of the mine. The blasts, which led to the formation of carbon monoxide, were heard 3 km from the mine. The coal roofs caved in and those who survived the collapse were killed by carbon monoxide.

 No stone barrier to contain coal dust explosions a must in such a mine or other safety measures had been provided because of the ignorance of safety officers, said an official.

 Bhatdih is a third-degree mine, which has the highest concentration of methane.

 The president of the Indian Mines Officers Association, A.K. Chowdhary, said necessary safety measures were not adopted at Bhatdih. As a result, it caused a devastating explosion which led to the death of 50 workers.

 Prosecution rests with burst on Manu

 Jessica: New hope

 New Delhi, Oct. 31 (PTI): Delhi police today told the high court that there was sufficient circumstantial evidence to establish Manu Sharma had killed Jessica Lal.

 Concluding arguments for the prosecution a day after Priyadarshini Mattoos murderer was handed death seven years after his acquittal, additional solicitor-general Gopal Subramanium told the court evidence showed Jessicas killer was fair in complexion and short in height. He was wearing a white T-shirt and blue jeans on that night.

 Besides, he told a division bench of Justices R.S. Sodhi and P.K. Bhasin, the testimonies of Bina Ramani, her husband George Mailhot and daughter Malini and the statement of witness Shayan Munshi had corroborated the description of the accused.

 Bina had chased Manu till the main gate of Qutub Colonade after Munshi complained about Manu after the incident, the counsel added.

 There was evidence that the Tata Safari with broken glass pieces, which was recovered from Noida, belonged to Piccadilly Agro Industries and Manu was driving it, the counsel said. He added Manu had bought a .22 bore pistol from a Karnal-based gun house. 

 Subramanium said the conduct of the accused after the incident showed that they were guilty as they had fled from the spot and had absconded for the next five days. The manner in which they had surrendered before the courts in different places after media reports and police action to trace them also gave away their involvement, he added.

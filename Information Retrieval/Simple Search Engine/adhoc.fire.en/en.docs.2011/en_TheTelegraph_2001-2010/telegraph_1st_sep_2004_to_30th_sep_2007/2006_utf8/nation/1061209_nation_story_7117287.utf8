 Cable TV debuts in Indian skies

 Mumbai (PTI): Passengers onboard can watch live television on a flight for the first time in Indian skies after Kingfisher Airlines and the Zee group-owned Dish TV announced a tie-up on Friday.

 Passengers would be able to choose live feed from as many as 15 channels while flying, Kingfisher Airlines chairman Vijay Mallya and Zee group chief Subhash Chandra said.

 We will be fitting a satellite dish in each of our airplanes which will capture live feeds from the satellite and transmit it to each of the TV screens. Within two years, all of our aircraft would have satellite TV connection, Mallya said.

 Suicide bid at YSR door

 Hyderabad: After several thousand 

 farm suicides had reduced tragedy to statistics in Andhra 

 Pradesh, 35-year-old Balaswamy on Friday decided on something 

 a little different.

 He took the swig from his bottle of pesticide in front of the chief ministers block at the state secretariat. He had just been told he could not meet Y.S.R. Reddy as he was to leave for Delhi.

 The farmer from Chennopally village, Mahboobnagar, is out of danger, doctors at Osmania General Hospital said.

 Balaswamy had once before failed to meet Reddy when he came to Hyderabad a few months ago with the Assembly in session.

 Police said the farmer, who owns three acres, suffered crop losses for more than two years running and owed about Rs 55,000 to debtors. He was denied easy bank credit.

 Goa Net alert

 Panaji (PTI): The Goa government 

 has asked cyber cafe owners to maintain detailed records 

 of customers to track possible terrorist activity.

 Customers should be asked to write their names and other details in their own handwriting. If they refuse, they shall not be allowed to surf the Internet, the order reads.

 House hoax

 New Delhi (PTI): An anonymous 

 call by a woman about a bomb in the Parliament complex had 

 the fire department on tenterhooks on Friday. Five fire 

 tenders rushed to the complex. There was a phone call 

 about a bomb, but it turned out to be a hoax, chief 

 fire officer R.S. Sharma said. 

 Shrine arrest

 Jammu (PTI): Police have arrested 

 a private security guard for molesting a teenager at the 

 Vaishno Devi shrine, sources said. The accused, Vinod Kumar, 

 was on duty when the incident occurred.

 President A.P.J. Abdul Kalams fans have launched an online campaign to support the extension of his tenure. They have asserted that all of us need somebody like him to guide us.

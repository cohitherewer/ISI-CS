 Cops thwart terror plot

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, May 10: The Anti-Terrorist Squad of Mumbai police have foiled a plot to carry out a series of explosions in Maharashtras hinterland and arrested three suspected Lashkar-e-Toiba militants with a large cache of arms and explosives, including over 30 kg of suspected RDX.

 The police have stepped up security at the Unesco heritage sites of Ajanta and Ellora caves which could have been the possible targets. The arrests came a day after Delhi police busted a suspected Lashkar cell which had reportedly planned to target Bollywood events in Mumbai. 

 State director-general of police P.S. Pasricha, however, remained non-committal when asked if todays arrests had any link with the Delhi terror cell.

 After a four-day vigil, squad officials assisted by the Aurangabad rural police arrested three youths travelling in a Tata Sumo on the Manmad-Aurangabad road yesterday. They were identified as Mohammed Amir Shakeel Ahmed Shaikh, 30, Sayyed Zuber Sayyed Anwar, 26, and Mohammad Muzaffar Tanvir, 24.

 According to the police, the team spotted a Tata Sumo moving in a suspicious manner. When asked to stop, the driver accelerated. The team chased the vehicle for one-and-a-half hours and intercepted it on the Kannad road off the highway. 

 The trio abandoned the vehicle and tried to escape.

 Local villagers caught one of the suspected militants, while the other two were nabbed with the help of the rural police.

 Pasricha said the police seized 10 AK-47 assault rifles, 2,000 live rounds of ammunition, 40 magazines and 30 kg of black powder suspected to be RDX, along with six magazine pouches and computer server cabinets. 

 The suspected RDX was hidden inside the 10 computer central processing units, the police said. The quantities of suspected RDX seized are the largest since the serial Mumbai explosions of March 1993.

 The trio was brought to Mumbai amid tight security and produced before the additional chief metropolitan magistrate A.M. Garde of the Mazgaon court on Wednesday afternoon. They were remanded in police custody till May 24.

 The police were tight-lipped about the possible motive of the group. State home minister R.R. Patil said: Investigations are still on. One thing is certain that Mumbai was not their only target. 

 Patil added that because of a spurt in terrorist activities in Marathawada and Vidarbha regions, the home ministry would set up separate anti-terror units in Aurangabad and Nagpur. 

 He lauded the police efforts and announced a reward of Rs 5 lakh to the anti-terror team for the successful operation.

 Son a traitor

 The father of slain militant Zubair, one of the main conspirators of the March 7 Varanasi blasts, has refused to bring back his sons body, says a PTI report.

 He is no longer my son as he has proved to be a traitor... He has also brought dishonour to our religion, Mohammad Yusuf said.

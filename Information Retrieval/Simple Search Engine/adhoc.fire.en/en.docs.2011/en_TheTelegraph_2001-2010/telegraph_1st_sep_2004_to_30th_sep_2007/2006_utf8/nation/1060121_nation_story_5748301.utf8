 Biryani on dinner table

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Hyderabad, Jan. 20: YSR is taking no chances: Madam has decreed there should be no food poisoning during the Congress plenary and hes making sure shell have no reason to complain.

 The GMC Balayogi Stadium at Gacchi Bowli has turned into a virtual food mart ? name what you want and the goodies land on your plate.

 Six kitchens ? three veg and three non-veg ? have been rigged up at the venue and proposed items cooked and sent to food connoisseurs for tasting. Andhra Pradesh chief minister Y.S.R. Reddy is believed to be one of them.

 The best possible hygiene has been maintained during the trial run underway since the second week of January. 

 We have involved scientists from the National Institute of Nutrition and dieticians from the university of agriculture to ensure quality and hygiene and a well-balanced meal for all delegates, said state Congress chief K. Keshav Rao.

 The best cook in business of Hyderabadi biryani, Kurshid Bux and his five-man team, has been given charge of rustling up a feast for the non-vegans among the 12,000 delegates who are expected to turn up for the plenary.

 The biryani will be cooked in a special way to give it the unique Hyderabadi flavour. We will not use gas stoves or steel containers to cook biryani. We will use copper handis and cook it on a small fire, Bux, who is employed with the guesthouse department of the state government, said.

 Apart from the biryani, kebabs, dal makhni (dal and sliced meat sambar) and palakura pappu (a dal preparation) are on the menu. Twenty-five types of spicy Deccani dishes of chicken, prawn, fish and mutton will also be served, besides Hyderabadi sweetmeats, ice-creams, fruit salads and fresh fruit.

 Although we expect 12,000 delegates, the kitchens will serve 28,000 meals a day, besides 15,000 breakfasts. The king of Hyderabadi food ? biryani ? will be served to around 6,000 delegates every day, said state agriculture minister N. Raghuveera Reddy, who is heading the plenarys food committee. 

 Bux plans to prepare something special for Sonia Gandhi. It appears that Bux has got in touch with someone in Mrs Gandhis office. Her choicest lamb dishes will be served, said Anjan Kumar Yadav, a Congress MP and member of the food committee.

 A senior manager of the department, Gopalakrishna, said: Bux is an authority on mutton biryani and mirchi ka salan, besides kebabs.

 With 500 lambs and 2,500 birds destined for the slaughter house, Reddy said precautions are being taken to ensure there is no cruelty to animals.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

Why? 93 to 06, no answers

- One Mumbaikar raises battle cry, another tries to make sense of the madness 

of terror 

KIRAN NAGARKAR

Someone must have switched on the TV in the next room. 

Thats odd. Watching TV is usually limited to the evening hours here, never 

in the mornings, certainly not as early as 8.30. I drift into the other room. 

Nobody notices my entry, they are mesmerised by the images on the TV screen.

I seem to be suffering from an acute attack of jetlag. 

I am disoriented and find myself in some other time frame. I seem to be back in 

1993 during the bomb explosions. 

A full flank of a compartment from a Mumbai local 

train has been pried open like the lid of an Amul cheese tin can. The camera is 

playing coy and shying away every time it comes close to dead bodies. The editor 

at the studio keeps cutting back to a wet window pane thats been pulled 

down all the way and has two red blood stains at the bottom, then to people walking 

on the rail tracks lifting hastily-covered bodies. Two drenched men gesture angrily 

at the camera as they escort a baffled friend away from the scene.

Now the camera cuts to the reporter who has miraculously 

escaped the bomb blast in another compartment and is about to tell of the impact 

of the explosion and how for a few stunned moments everybody sat uncertain and 

paralysed and then suddenly the train emptied out. But before he launches excitedly, 

perhaps for the 7th or 9th time, on a paean to the unconquerable spirit of Mumbai 

and how the commuters of the train got down to help the wounded even before the 

police or the ambulances turned up, he makes certain that his channel gets a plug 

by telling us that as usual, his channel will be on the scene 24x7.

President Pervez Musharraf, we are told, has condemned 

the terrorist attacks. Soon, very soon, railway minister Lalu Prasad and Sonia 

Gandhi herself will give us their insights on who was responsible for the terrible 

events of Bloody Tuesday. 

By now I am beginning to perceive that I have not 

segued into the past but am watching that awful, mind-numbing thing called Breaking 

News, the fresh, piping hot, make-my-day, instant transmission of current in-the-thick-of-disaster 

TV coverage.

I am close to 9,000 miles away from the seven simultaneous 

blasts that have shaken Mumbai once again to the roots but even that vast distance 

will not safeguard me from what I would rather not know. I am regressing rapidly 

and asking inane questions: Why this constant need to kill? Will this slaughter 

of innocents never end? Is it mankind which is bloodthirsty? Or is it their God? 

Who, in Gods name, is doing this? Was it Pakistan? The ISI? Was it SIMI, 

the Islamic students body? What was the trigger this time? Is it what we 

did in Gujarat? Is it because Kashmiri young people have no jobs and no future? 

Is it because the militants in Kashmir do not want a rapprochement between Pakistan 

and India? Is it because Musharraf thinks we are pussyfooting the talks on Kashmir? 

Or is it but one more stopover in the series of explosions that have shattered 

Madrid, London and now Mumbai?

I want to go lie down. Will someone please shut off 

the world? I rouse myself from my stupor and try to call a friend who commutes 

daily from Bandra into town and back again in the evenings. Is he okay? I cant 

get through. The voice of MTNL tells me: All lines on this route are busy. 

I try for another half-an-hour and then give up. Is Naresh all right? Or has the 

terrorist RDX got him?

I should know a thing or two about terrorism, after 

all I am the author of the book called Gods Little Soldier. I spent 

close to eight years studying the extremist mind and came to the conclusion that 

clarity and understanding would come, not from a linear, straightforward approach, 

but through ambiguity alone. It was important to grasp that in the new arithmetic, 

right could be both right and wrong, and wrong could also be right.

I learnt that the definition of the enemy had remained 

the same since the time man began to live in tribes or perhaps even earlier. The 

identity of the enemy was always clear: he was the other, the one 

who was either a threat of annihilation for the group that called itself us 

or who had already subjugated us. It was obviously implicit that the 

opposite side could also view us as the other. When the 

Muslim invaders arrived in India, they were the other for the Hindu 

us. Clearly, there was no mistaking the Christian Crusaders. They 

were the villains and the other in Muslim eyes. 

But the notion of the enemy changed for the first 

time in history in the last couple of decades of the 20th century. The enemy no 

longer had a sharp, unmistakable profile. The enemy was one or hundreds of innocent 

bystanders in Baghdad, Kabul or Tel Aviv who had never done the us 

group any harm or were in any way connected to the perceived grievance.

In the transactions of terrorism, the bystanders became 

nothing more than victims or collateral damage. They are the instruments by which 

the militants in Iraq, for instance, think they are getting back at President 

George W. Bush and the so-called coalition headed by America.

At its core, the act of terrorism is a negation of 

all things that stand for life. 

And yet of what use was all this knowledge now? How 

could I make sense of the madness I was witnessing on the TV screen and the chaos 

in my mind? The individual tragedies of the seven coordinated blasts had emasculated 

all the wisdom of my insights, not to mention the fine theories of the great thinkers 

and scholars. I had no answer to the woman on the screen whose eyes looked uncomprehendingly 

at the corpse of her dead husband as she aimlessly flipped a corner of the white 

sheet covering him back and forth. 

Mahim, Bandra, Khar?. Seven blasts, seven stations 

in Mumbai alone. Another seven or 10 stations in Baghdad, and four in Jerusalem 

tomorrow or the day after. The agony of Christ ends with 14 stations. Obviously 

mankind is not satisfied with 14 or 14,000. Nothing, it would seem, will quench 

mans thirst for blood and murder.

Little Soldier in which he explores the terrorist mind, wrote this article

Stock markets take note, soccer has a bear hug

 Whats the score?

 New Delhi, June 12: A loss in a football or a cricket match can lead to a fall in the losing countrys stock exchange, says a study that analysed sports and stock exchange behaviour over three decades.

 The study by financial analysts in Norway and the US examined how results in soccer and other nationally popular sports such as cricket, rugby or basketball affect peoples mood and impact the stock exchange.

 The researchers studied international football results from 1973 through 2004, examining qualifiers, group matches and final rounds of the FIFA World Cup played in Europe, Asia and South America. The study revealed what they describe as a strong negative stock market reaction to losses by national soccer teams.

 However, the study has also shown that when a countrys team won a match ? whether soccer or cricket or any other sport ? the stock market did not rise. These findings will appear in a forthcoming issue of the Journal of Finance.

 We found a dramatic fall in the share market after an important football match was lost, said Oyvind Norli, an associate professor in the department of financial economics at the Norwegian School of Business.

 The size of the loss effect is economically significant. In monthly terms, the excess returns associated with a soccer loss is 7 per cent, Norli and his colleagues wrote in their research paper. We find a statistically significant but smaller loss effect for international cricket, rugby, and basketball games, they said.

 The economists believe this effect emerges from the impact of sports results on investor moods. Losing an important international football match creates a general feeling of pessimism among the inhabitants of a country and naturally a pessimistic investor will revise his view of what companies quotes on the stock market are worth, Norli said.

 In their analysis of cricket, the researchers included results of one-day international cricket matches played through eight world championships between 1975 and 2003 with Australia, England, India, New Zealand, Pakistan, South Africa and Sri Lanka as the seven cricket nations.

 Studies in the past have suggested that sports results can influence human behaviour and health. One study showed that admissions following heart attacks increased by 25 per cent in a three-day period in the 1998 World Cup after England lost to Argentina in a penalty shootout.

 Losing in the final round of the World Cup causes an average loss of 0.38 per cent in the main share index of the country in question. The researchers took into account patterns in the international share markets and only measured abnormal changes after the game.

 A loss of 0.38 per cent may not sound a lot, but when compared with positive average daily returns of about 0.06 per cent, the football-related fall in the share market is substantial both statistically and financially, the Norwegian School of Management said.

 Norli and his colleagues say the asymmetric effect of sports on the stock exchange ? losing causes it to drop, while winning does not cause a rise ? may be connected to the asymmetric format of most competitions. Winning a match merely allows a nation to move to the next level of competition, while losing it ejects it from the competition.

 Shadow on Sonia party

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 New Delhi, May 19: The issues of reservation, wheat import, the impending oil price hike and its inflationary impact could mar what was supposed to be a self-congratulatory meeting of the Congress Working Committee here tomorrow.

 In its original form, the meeting was supposed to pass a resolution congratulating Congress president Sonia Gandhi for her record win from Rae Bareli and another urging her to induct Rahul Gandhi in the party organisation for his successful management of her campaign.

 CWC sources said while the two resolutions, particularly the one on Rahul, were on the cards, some members felt it was time the Congress took the political and policy controversies by the horns instead of pretending they did not exist.

 Just as Sonias formal induction into the party was facilitated by a CWC resolution, sources said a similar document on Rahul would be the final seal of ratification on the creation of a larger and a more meaningful role for him.

 It was the quota dispute that worried the party greatly. Sources said that though the Congress would officially support Arjun Singhs education quota googly, discussions in the CWC could be frank and perhaps stormy.

 This time, the apprehension was that with Arjun going on the front foot, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Pranab Mukherjee pussyfooting, the Congress would lose the forward, backward and Dalit votes.

 We have to spell out our stand clearly, he said.

 The consensus was it was time the party asserted its pro-reservation stand unequivocally, while the government worked out the package of palliatives and stopped Arjun from converting it into a personal agenda.

 Senior officials who met Manmohan lately advised him to work along these lines. Sources said he had partially neutralised the Arjun factor by inducting P. Chidambaram in the group of ministers on quota and engaging Sharad Pawar and Anbumani Ramadoss. All three are champions of reservation and, as a CWC member said, carry more credibility than Arjun.

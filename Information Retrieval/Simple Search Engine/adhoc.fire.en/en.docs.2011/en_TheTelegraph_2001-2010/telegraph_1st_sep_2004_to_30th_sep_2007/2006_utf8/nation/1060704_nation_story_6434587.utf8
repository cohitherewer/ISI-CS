 CMs called to price battle

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 3: Doubt persists over her return as chairperson of the National Advisory Council, but Sonia Gandhis campaign for the aam admi hasnt slackened.

 After nudging the Centre to try and check the spiralling prices of essentials, she has now signalled that Congress-ruled states must follow suit.

 The Congress chief has summoned her partys chief ministers to a meeting on price rise on Wednesday. Lest they paint an overly optimistic picture, she will meet her general secretaries tomorrow for a reality check, party sources said.

 Since the general secretaries are in charge of party affairs in the various states, Congress and non-Congress, Sonia believes they can give her the true picture.

 Party sources said two factors behind the price rise worried Sonia and her advisers the most: hoarding and forward-trading. The Centres advice to the Congress-ruled states to crack down on hoarders ? even invoking the Essential Services Maintenance Act against them if needed ? is apparently being ignored.

 The compulsion is political. We need the traders support, a senior party leader explained.

 We have managed to win them over to our side from the BJPs with some difficulty. If Esma is used, the food inspectors will lord it over the system and abuse it. This will evoke memories of the inspector raj and the pre-liberalisation era, and give the Congress a bad name among opinion-makers.

 The party has chosen the softer option of trying to persuade the traders not to hoard essential commodities or carry out forward-trading. If this doesnt work within, say, two weeks, the party and the government would put their heads together to see what more they can do. 

 Party sources said the most damaging feedback had come from three Congress-ruled states: Himachal Pradesh, Punjab and Haryana.

 The governments reported decision to put onions on the list of commodities that can be traded at the exchange from July 7 has angered party units. 

 At a time when pulses are going out of the common mans reach, does the government plan to snatch away even the onion, the only other food he could have with his rotis, local Congressmen are asking.

 Delhi Congress MP Sajjan Kumar, who ran a campaign against online commodity trading, has been quoted as saying, The online trading of onions would snatch the bulb of the onion from the aam admi. I fail to understand if the Congresss manifesto makes sense to this government or not.

 In Opposition-ruled states, the Congress will ask its leaders to keep a sharp eye out on price movements, hoarding and the governments willingness ? or lack of it ? towards corruption.

 An erring government will be put on the ropes because this is the only way the Congress can hope to deflect criticism of the Centre for the price rise and food imports.

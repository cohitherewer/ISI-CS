 UK caution on visa agents

 Chennai (PTI): The British 

 deputy high commissioner for south India, Mike Connor, on 

 Thursday cautioned visa applicants against being exploited 

 by unscrupulous agents. 

 He said the British government has launched a new points system to enable the UK to handle the demand for visas effectively and speedily.

 Connor said 15 per cent of visa applications were turned down in 2005 for various reasons, including submission of false documents. Visa-seekers could make an online self-appraisal of their standing vis-a-vis the points system, he added. 

 The new system, based on objectivity and qualifications, is aimed at tackling abuse and identifying the most talented workers, Connor said.

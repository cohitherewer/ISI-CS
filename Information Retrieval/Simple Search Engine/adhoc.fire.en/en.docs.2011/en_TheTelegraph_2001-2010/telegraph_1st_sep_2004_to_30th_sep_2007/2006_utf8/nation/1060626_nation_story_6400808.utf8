 Advani reloads sub gun

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 25: L.K. Advani today again raised the Scorpene controversy, asking the Prime Minister to explain if the recent CBI raids on defence personnel had found any link between the submarine deal and the navy war-room leak.

 The CBI has confirmed that the leak is part of a much larger conspiracy impinging on vital aspects of Indias national security, the BJP leader said.

 What is this larger conspiracy, he asked, and will the Centre accept that the twin scams of the leak and the Scorpene deal are connected?

 Advani has already been slapped with a defamation suit by one of the defence leak suspects, businessman Abhishek Verma, whom he had accused of being a middleman in the Rs 18,000-crore submarine deal. The businessman recently made news again when he and his chartered accountant were raided by the CBI in the probe.

 At a function this morning to mark the 31st year since the Emergency was clamped, Advani raised the issue again. The BJP had earlier hinted that the case against Advani was a Congress ploy to stop him from exposing corruption in high places.

 Advani today also alleged that the UPA governments attempts to stifle the Opposition reflected the dictatorial attitude the Congress had shown in 1975.

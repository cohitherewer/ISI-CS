 Mumbai, March 2: The flu fright has blown over, if chicken sales in Mumbai are an indication.

 Two weeks after avian influenza struck in poultries in Navapur, Maharashtra, and lakhs of birds were culled, chicken is back on the Mumbaikars menu.

 Sales of both packaged chicken and live birds have reported a brisk rise over the past few days.

 Our sales had dropped to about 30 per cent of what we generally sell. And we did feel the pinch for about 10 days after the bird flu news broke. But things have improved quickly in the last two to three days and we are currently doing 60 to 70 per cent of our usual business, said Balram Yadav of Real Good Chicken, a Godrej brand. We are hopeful that by this weekend we would be back to our pre-bird flu figures. 

 Chicken supply to Mumbai crossed the 1-lakh mark on Tuesday. When flu fear was at its peak, the number of chickens supplied had dropped to as low as 13,000. Mumbaikars on an average consume 1 lakh-1.2 lakh chickens on weekdays and around 1.5 lakh on weekends. The figure excludes packaged chicken.

 Arshad Ali of Danish Poultry in Crawford Market is overjoyed. Sales have doubled since this weekend. Before the flu, we would sell around 50 chickens a day. This had gone down to zero at one point. Since Monday, we are back to 40 birds a day?.

 Though some retailers slashed prices to Rs 20, others, especially those selling dressed chicken, did not do so. Many thought the birds were being sold cheap because they were infected, said Jatin Bhalla of Megha Agro, a retailer at Napean Sea Road that is selling chicken at Rs 72 a kg.

 Chickens and eggs were back on the menu from Sunday. More and more customers were insisting on omelettes and other egg products at our Sunday brunch, said Prakash Parmar of Out of the Blue, a restaurant and celeb haunt.

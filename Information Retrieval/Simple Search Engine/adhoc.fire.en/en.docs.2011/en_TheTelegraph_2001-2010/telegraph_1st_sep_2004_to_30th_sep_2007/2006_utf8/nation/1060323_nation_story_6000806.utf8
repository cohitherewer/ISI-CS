 Sodomy scandal in Raj Bhavan

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Mumbai, March 22: The brother of a Raj Bhavan 

employee has been accused of sexual assault on a 12-year-old boy.

 Pramod Jadhav, a 42-year-old fisherman who lives with his brother at the employees quarters near Raj Bhavan in Malabar Hill, allegedly lured the boy to his house with chocolates on March 10, police said.

 The incident, which comes close on the heels of a Bombay High Court order sentencing two British paedophiles to six years imprisonment, came to light on Tuesday when the boy complained of abdominal pain and his mother found scars on his private parts.

 The boys family reported the matter to the police and a medical examination confirmed that he had been sodomised.

 The family caught hold of Jadhav and handed him over to security personnel posted at the front gate of Raj Bhavan. But the father of two gave the guards, who are attached to the Malabar Hill police station, the slip.

 We are trying to locate Pramod Jadhav, the accused. He is absconding at present, but we will get him soon. We have registered a case of sodomy (Section 377 of the IPC) against Jadhav. But what worries us is how the victim, who lives in a chawl in Malabar Hill, entered the Raj Bhavan premises in the first place. We are trying to see if there was a security breach, said DCP Ashok Dighavkar, who is handling the case. 

 The boys family, however, said the 12-year-old would visit the Raj Bhavan employees quarters regularly to meet a friend.

 On March 10, Jadhav lured him with chocolates and molested him. He then threatened my son and told him to keep quiet about the whole incident, said the boys mother in her police statement recorded on Tuesday.

 The boys family has said the incident occurred on the premises of the governors house, but the police and Raj Bhavan have denied it.

 Pramod Jadhav? is not an employee of Raj Bhavan, although his brother works in Raj Bhavan. The office of the governor categorically denies reports by a section of the media, which stated that Pramod Jadhav is an employee of Raj Bhavan, said a press release from the governors house.

 Technically, the police are correct. The crime did not occur on the Raj Bhavan premises. But that does not absolve the governors house of its responsibility. The incident occurred inside its staff quarters and so questions may be raised about security. 

 That apart, it is insensitive to get into these nitty-gritties at a time when a dastardly act has been committed against a child, said Steven Coelho, a Mumbai-based child rights activist.

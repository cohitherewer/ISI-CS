 Break from past and protocol

 PEMA LEYDA SHANGDERPA 

 Nathu-la, June 20: Weather played god as the first Indian delegation crossed Nathu-la after 44 years today.

 It was a day of firsts and broken protocol. For the first time, motor vehicles were used till the army outposts on both sides.

 Another first: customs and immigration started operation by stamping the passports of the team. From July 6, when Nathu-la will be formally reopened, travel passes will be used instead of passports.

 Before 1962, when trade through the Silk Route was carried out on mules and Sikkim was a kingdom under the Chogyals, travel passes were the only documents needed. 

 As for protocol, the vice-chairman of Tibet Autonomous Region Hao Peng broke it today when he escorted the Indians and saw them off at a sun-kissed Nathu-la. 

 It is a small beginning for trade but a great opportunity for economic development and people-to-people contact between the two great countries, Christy Fernandez, the additional secretary to the commerce ministry, said on his arrival at Nathu-la. 

 Fernandez, who led a six-member team to Lhasa, the Tibetan capital, to assess the Chinese preparedness for resumption of trade, returned to Sikkim this afternoon.

 The two sides, according to Fernandez, have arrived at several agreements (see chart) on trade through the pass located at 14,400 ft.

 About the preparedness on the other side, Fernandez said: The people and authorities appeared to be pro-active, enthusiastic and supportive. He, however, said that while the road on the Indian side of the border was superb, the Chinese route was still under construction.

 Bengal seeks role

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today sought a role for the Bengal government in the reopening of Nathu-la, adds our Calcutta bureau.

 The chief minister wanted Bengal to be included in our negotiations with the Chinese government. I have promised him that Bengal will have a role in the negotiations, Union minister of state for commerce Jairam Ramesh said in Calcutta.

 Sources said the state government has told the Centre that once the Silk Route is opened, Bengal, and not Sikkim, would be the major trading partner of China.

 He (Bhattacharjee) said a majority of the exports to China would go from Bengal, and Siliguri would be the trade hub in North Bengal, Ramesh said. 

 The Union minister agreed to Bhattacharjees request for central assistance to develop a fishing harbour in the state and to better market Bengals marine produce.

 The Marine Product Export Development Authority will be asked to help market Bengals produce. The Centre will set up testing centres for hilsa on the Petrapole border.

 Ramesh said he would look into Bhattacharjees concern over the duty-free import of vanaspati from Sri Lanka and Nepal. 

 Ramesh made a pitch for allowing foreign direct investment on a case to case basis from Bangladesh. Such investments are now not allowed from Bangladesh and Pakistan.

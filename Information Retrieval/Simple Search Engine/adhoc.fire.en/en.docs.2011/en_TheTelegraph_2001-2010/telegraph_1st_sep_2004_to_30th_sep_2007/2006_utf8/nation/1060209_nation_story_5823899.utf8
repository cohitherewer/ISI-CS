 Couriers face letter leash 

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi, Feb. 8: The government has revived a proposal to ensure that private courier companies do not carry letters weighing below 500 gm and make the segment an exclusive domain of the postal department, which has been losing business to the new players.

 The present Indian Postal Act exclusively gives the right to the department of posts to carry letters. It does not allow private couriers to carry letters, it only allows them to carry documents. But private companies are carrying letters in the name of documents which is in anyway a violation of the act, Shakeel Ahmad, the minister of state for communications and information technology, said.

 So we are trying to plug the loopholes by proposing changes in the act, he said.

 The proposed changes in the act will allow private players to carry letters above 500 gm. The existing act totally bars them from carrying any letters, he added.

 The final draft will be prepared soon in consultation with law ministry. We will very soon send it for cabinet approval and, if all goes well, it will be preferably introduced in the budget session, Ahmad added. 

 The proposed amendment will also differentiate a letter and a document even for below 500 gm so that the private sector does not take advantage of the lack of it, he said.

 An amendment was mooted earlier when the fleet-footed courier business began to eat into the tardy postal departments share but it was shelved soon after.

 If the government pressed ahead with the renewed bid, it will have adverse ramifications for the Rs 3,000-crore private courier industry.

 Industry sources, who have been taken aback by the ministers statement, said close to 40 per cent or Rs 720 crore of the domestic market is accounted by documents. Of this Rs 720 crore, nearly 50 per cent comes from packets of 500 gm or less.

 A senior official of a leading private sector courier company said the big players would not be hit significantly since they have brought down their dependence on documents.

 However, the unorganised sector will be hit hard as they deal mostly in the documents business, where margins are low.

 Around 2,000 express companies ? that is how the courier companies call themselves ? are estimated to be in the country. A bulk is accounted for by the unorganised sector that largely operates within a particular city. 

 Some of the major centres for intra-city business include Mumbai, Delhi, Calcutta, Bangalore, Chennai and Indore.

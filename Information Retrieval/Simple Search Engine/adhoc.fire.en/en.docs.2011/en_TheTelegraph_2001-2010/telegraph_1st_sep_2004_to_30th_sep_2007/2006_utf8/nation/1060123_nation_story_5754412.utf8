 Warts at workplace

 New Delhi, Jan. 22 (PTI): Nine years after the Supreme Court laid down guidelines to deal with sexual harassment at the workplace, justice remains a far cry for victims.

 A survey carried out by the National Commission for Women has revealed there is very poor compliance with the apex courts order passed in 1997.

 The survey, which covered 799 organisations including government departments, found that most lacked awareness about the guidelines prescribed in the Vishakha judgment.

 Of the organisations surveyed, 664 had set up complaint committees in accordance with the guidelines, but as many as 61 had committees headed by men, not women. Nearly 414 of the complaint committees did not have a non-government organisation or third-party participation.

 The panel observed that the Supreme Court guidelines had not been properly followed both by government departments and private parties.

 The worst compliance with the judgment was seen in non-government organisations, with only nine of the 22 surveyed having set up complaint committees.

 News organisations were only slightly better, with seven of the 14 agencies that were part of the study having complaint committees.

 The report stated that even where these committees existed, they did not have 50 per cent reservation for women. Also, in many cases, lack of awareness among the committee members was noticed.

 While there was lack of awareness about the guidelines in several organisations, especially in the unorganised sector, there were problems with the constitution and functioning of the complaint committees, the report added.

 There were other problems such as lack of seriousness, political and managerial interference, stigmatisation and pressure on victims to withdraw complaints, the creation of an even more hostile environment for complainants, threats to end employment and the filing of counter-charges of defamation by the accused.

 Mumbai, July 12: Had Tuesday not been his birthday, Praveen Verma would not be lying at KEM Hospitals casualty ward.

 The 36-year-old graphic designer had spent most of the day waiting impatiently for office to close so he could be at home in Borivli to party with friends and family.

 He had broken with routine to board the 6.15 pm Churchgate-Virar fast train at Dadar to save a precious 20 minutes. He hadnt been 10 minutes on the train when the explosion hurled him out of the compartment.

 When he came to his senses after a few minutes, Verma found himself lying on platform No. 2 of Mahim station, his head bathed in blood.

 He called office from his mobile. We informed his family, said colleague Anirudh Badhe. Praveen has suffered head injuries; his right hand is badly fractured. Verma, who has had surgery on his wrist, is out of danger.

 With his mind on the party, Verma may not have noticed police constable Santosh Patil who was in the same first class compartment but, like policemen usually do, was standing at the door. Today they lay side by side on adjacent beds.

 Patil grimaced in pain as he sat up to talk. He spoke with great difficulty because of a brace round his neck. The 26-year-old had finished his days duty and had boarded the train at Dadar.

 The blast happened when the train entered Mahim station where it doesnt have a scheduled halt. I was flung off the moving train, he said.

 Unlike Verma, Patil didnt blackout. After fellow passengers brought him to the platform, he told them what to do next. A police van arrived soon to take him to hospital.

 He has severe back and neck injuries. And a lot of stitches all over my body, Patil tried to grin through the pain.

 Dr Pankaj Chaudhary, the houseman of the 4/A ward, had reported for duty at 2 pm. By evening, the womens ward had transformed into an emergency ward.

 We suddenly got more than 20 patients within minutes. One had burns, three had glass shards in their body, at least five had limb fractures, some had head injuries. One patient had an unidentified foreign body in his chest, and was moved to the cardio-thoracic department, said Chaudhary, still manning the ward this afternoon.

 Most of KEMs medical staff ? nurses, doctors, anaesthetists, surgeons and ward boys ? worked overnight. 

 Hundreds of people and relatives queued up to donate blood, Chaudhary said. There were 900 on Tuesday evening and 300 more queued up today. The hospital this evening had more blood than it needed.

 Accountant Ganesh Kadam, 36, was standing on the footboard of the Virar local when he felt something like an electric shock from the mobile phone in his trouser pocket, said friend Vijay Janawalikar. He took it out and threw it out of the train. A second later, he discovered his face was burning and his right hand was badly injured. Kadam was in no condition to speak.

 Mannan Ali Dharwala, 38, was breathing with an oxygen mask. The LIC agent had jumped off his train seconds after the blast at Matunga Road.

 The plunge fractured his ribs and cut a vein in his right hand. He was unconscious till 3 am and had emergency surgery on his hand.

 Like other hospitals across the city, KEM had hundreds of visitors who came to help in whatever way they could. 

 A group of young Muslim girls wearing black shrouds came to find out if they could do anything. 

 So did several womens groups.

 Hundreds of local youths manned the help desks at the hospital with patient lists.

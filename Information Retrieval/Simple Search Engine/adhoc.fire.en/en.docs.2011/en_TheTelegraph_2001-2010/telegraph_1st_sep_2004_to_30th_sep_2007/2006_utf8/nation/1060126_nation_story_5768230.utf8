 Chhappan cop pulls court stunt

 Nayak: Bail relief

 Mumbai, Jan. 25: Just over three years ago, they were Mumbai polices poster boys, working as a team to gun down at least 80 gangsters in encounters.

 The celebrated pair of Daya Nayak and mentor-turned-rival Pradeep Sharma found themselves in the dock today as they tried to prevent their imminent arrest in separate cases.

 Sub-inspector Nayak, who inspired the Bollywod flicks Ab Tak Chhappan and Kagaar, today made a surprise appearance before the sessions court for the hearing of his anticipatory bail plea. Wanted in a disproportionate assets case, he had gone underground after raids last week.

 Senior inspector Sharma, Nayaks colleague in the crime branch special squad, also rushed to the sessions court seeking anticipatory bail in connection with the custody death of Ghatkopar blast accused Khwaja Yunus in 2003.

 Both got interim relief from their respective courts till January 27.

 Nayak and his wife Komal face arrest by the polices anti-corruption bureau, which has lodged a case against them for allegedly possessing assets disproportionate to their known sources of income.

 The bureau says Nayak owns assets worth Rs 41.75 lakh when his known income is merely Rs 9,000 per month. It alleges he dabbled in film financing and travel and hotel businesses, floating 15 companies to amass about Rs 100 crore.

 Appearing with his wife before judge S.P. Mahajan, Nayak denied the allegations and claimed he was not absconding. Defence counsel Shirish Gupte said his client was being victimised.

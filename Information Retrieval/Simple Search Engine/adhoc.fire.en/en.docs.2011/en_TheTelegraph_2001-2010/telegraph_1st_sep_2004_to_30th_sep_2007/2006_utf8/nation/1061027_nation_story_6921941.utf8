 Rich quota plea for poor quota

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 26: Unaided deemed universities have agreed to reserve seats for students from the weaker sections, taking the government a step closer to clinching the debate on a quota bill for private institutions. 

 Representatives of eight deemed universities out of 63 who attended todays meeting with human resource development minister Arjun Singh also want a quota for foreign students to subsidise the disadvantaged pupils. The government has not given its opinion.

 Reservation for foreign students could, however, be nothing but wishful thinking on the part of the deemed universities because it will take the total quota beyond 50 per cent. 

 The Supreme Court has directed states not to cross 50 per cent in reservation, though southern states like Karnataka and Tamil Nadu have transgressed the line. 

 The quota structure from the next academic session will be 27 per cent for other backward classes (OBCs), 15 per cent for scheduled castes and 7.5 per cent for scheduled tribes, adding up to 49.5 per cent.

 Unaided deemed universities currently have a 15 per cent quota for NRI students. The Supreme Court has struck down all categories of quotas (beyond SC/ST and OBCs) other than the NRI quota.

 The Centre has also drawn up a bill regulating the fee structure and admission policy of private higher education institutions. The government believes private institutions are charging too much and commercialising education. 

 In the last session of Parliament, a bill was introduced to bring into effect the OBC quota in government and government-aided higher education institutions. The bill is pending before a parliamentary committee. 

 The argument offered by the heads of the unaided deemed universities for a quota for foreign students is it will help them raise the money to subsidise the weaker sections. 

 Some point out that the 15 per cent NRI quota is supposed to fulfil that purpose, so why another quota?

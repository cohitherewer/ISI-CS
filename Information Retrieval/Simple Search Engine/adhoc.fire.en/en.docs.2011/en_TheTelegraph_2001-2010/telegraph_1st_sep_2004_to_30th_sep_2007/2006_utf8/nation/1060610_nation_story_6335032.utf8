 Fresh blow to Zahira

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, June 9: The noose seems to be tightening around Zahira Sheikh.

 Zahira, a prime witness in the Best Bakery massacre during the post-Godhra riots, had her property attached by the income-tax department of Vadodara from where she hails.

 The blow came a day after a Mumbai sessions court sent Zahiras sister to jail on perjury charges. Zahiras trial for perjury concluded today, and the court has reserved its order till Monday.

 Zahira, whose numerous flip-flops in court saw the bakery case shift from Gujarat to Mumbai for retrial, is serving a one-year sentence in Byculla jail for contempt of court. 

 Eight assets owned by Zahira and her family have been attached. They include four bank accounts in Mumbai, a house in Vadodara, another flat in Mumbai and two 450 sq ft plots in the name of her brother Nasibullah.

 Zahiras lawyer Umesh Deshpande said the income-tax departments move has nothing to do with the bakery case. The properties have been attached for not filing returns for the last three years.... Contrary to what many believe, their financial condition is not good. Besides, they were not given enough time.

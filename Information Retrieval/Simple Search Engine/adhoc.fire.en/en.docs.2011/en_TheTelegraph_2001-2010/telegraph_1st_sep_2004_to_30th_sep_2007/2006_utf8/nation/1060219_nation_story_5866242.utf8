 Thackeray sorry for V-Day ire

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Feb. 18: Barely a few days after he urged party cadre to oppose Valentines Day celebrations, Bal Thackeray today apologised for the misbehaviour of a group of Shiv Sena workers at a private gathering in the western suburbs.

 The group had gatecrashed into a hotel in Nallasopara on the night of February 14 and driven out men, women and children from the party. Three TV crews had accompanied the group and filmed the attack which showed Sena workers misbehaving and assaulting women guests. One channel aired the footage, sparking outrage in Mumbai.

 What these people did was uncalled for and condemnable. I am ashamed to call as Shiv Sainiks the perpetrators of this act, Thackeray said in an article in the party mouthpiece, Saamna, titled Mahilano Mala Maaf Kara! (womenfolk, please forgive me).

 I have always instructed Shiv Sainiks that women should never be humiliated and harassed in any situation. Have they forgotten our history when Raja Shivaji sent back with honour the daughter-in-law of (the) Kalyan Fort subedar, he said, citing an incident from Maratha history.

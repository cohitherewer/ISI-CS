 Heist on Calcutta bank doorstep

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Dec. 30: A trading firm employee was hit on the head on a banks doorstep by goons who slashed his throat when he tried to stop them from snatching money and drafts worth over Rs 5 lakh.

 Laxmi Kumar Gupta was accosted on the stairs leading to the bank on Jatindra Mohan Avenue off Shyambazar. The bank had opened minutes before and there was nobody on the stairs when the 24-year-old went to deposit Rs 3.6 lakh, bank drafts worth Rs 2 lakh and some account payee cheques.

 Guptas condition is said to be critical. Bank employees alerted by his screams took him to hospital.

 The incident took place around 10.10 in the morning. It is likely that the goons knew Gupta would be coming with a large amount, a senior officer of Burtolla police station said. 

 Sleuths collected blood samples and shoe prints from the staircase. It was probably a gang of three, they said.

 Gupta works for a wholesaler of pulses in Ultadanga.

 The wholesaler, Rajesh Jaiswal, told the police that he has been in the business for over a decade. Gupta, he added, used to look after the accounts and handle bank transactions. 

 An officer working on the case said the police are looking into the backgrounds of those with whom Jaiswal had traded recently.

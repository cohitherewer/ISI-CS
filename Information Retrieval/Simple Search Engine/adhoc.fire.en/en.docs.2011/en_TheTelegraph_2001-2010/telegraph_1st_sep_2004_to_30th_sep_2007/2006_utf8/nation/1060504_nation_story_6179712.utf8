 Swapna meets CM

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Hyderabad, May 3: As the widow of telecom engineer K. Suryanarayana battled for life, second wife Gogula Swapna Reddy went to meet the chief minister and governor with her wailing baby in her arms.

 Swapna, who claims Suryanarayana married her in 2002, has got an assurance of help from both Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy and Rameswar Thakur.

 The engineers widow Manjula, who attempted suicide on Monday by pouring acid down her throat, has little chance of survival, doctors attending on her said. The damage is more severe than expected, Dr Nageswar Reddy said. 

 At the funeral of the engineer killed by the Taliban, his father K. Chandrasekhar had screamed at Swapna: Go away and leave us to cry in peace. These children who lost their father are on verge of losing their mother as well.

 Imphal, Aug. 18: Manipur police today announced a cash reward of Rs 1 lakh for information leading to the identification and arrest of those who bombed the Iskcon temple here on Wednesday night.

 The announcement came a few hours after the toll in the terror attack increased to five. A 24-year-old woman, Th. Ranjita Devi, succumbed to her injuries at a private hospital at 2 am. Ranjita, who was a resident of Langjing Achouba in Imphal West, had been battling for life in the intensive care unit of Shija Hospitals.

 Nearly 20 of the 50 injured, including foreigners, are still in hospital.

 Iskcon officials are trying to make arrangements to shift an injured American devotee, 52-year-old Bhojdev, to a super-speciality hospital outside the state. However, Iskcon officials scotched rumours about the organisation planning to airlift all foreign devotees out of the state. Imphal West superintendent of police Clay Khongsai, too, clarified that the government had not received any intimation from any quarter to airlift the foreigners to a destination of their choice.

 Born Brian Nash, Bhojdev is among four foreigners wounded in the grenade attack on the temple during a Ras Lila performance on Janmashtami. He has been in the intensive care unit of the Regional Institute of Medical Sciences since that night. 

 Ajit Das, president of the Iskcon temple, said Bhojdevs condition turned more critical today. We are awaiting advice from a neurosurgeon so that we can shift him to a hospital outside the state, he said.

 Of the three other injured foreigners, one Swiss national Kirtida Sundari Devi Dasi left Imphal for home yesterday. The remaining two, Luxmipriya Devi Dasi from Pennsylvania and Iranian Radhika Priya Devi Dasi, are camping on the temple premises.

 Announcing the cash reward for information leading to any arrest, police public relations officer Vandana Karki said vigorous efforts were being made to arrest those behind the grenade attack. The officer said the informers identity would be kept a secret. Telephone numbers of five police officers have been notified. Anybody having information relevant to the investigation can dial these numbers.

 Director-general of police Anup Parashar admitted yesterday that there was no concrete evidence to establish the identity of the group behind the attack. Four of the major militant groups operating in Manipur have issued statements to end speculation about their involvement in the incident. 

 Residents of Langjing Achouba, the locality where the fifth blast victim used to stay, and those of some neighbouring villages today blocked the Imphal-Jiribam highway in protest against Wednesdays attack. A group of students staged a sit-in demonstration at Kwakeithel, near the Iskcon temple.

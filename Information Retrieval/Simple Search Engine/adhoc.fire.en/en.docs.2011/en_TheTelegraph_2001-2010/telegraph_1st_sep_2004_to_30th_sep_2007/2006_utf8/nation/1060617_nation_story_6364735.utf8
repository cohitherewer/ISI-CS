 Bangalore, June 16: Amid raging controversy, the company building the Bangalore-Mysore expressway opened a 9-km peripheral road today, reports our special correspondent. 

 Nandi Infrastructure Corridor Enterprises got children from nearby villages and two old women, who it said voluntarily gave up their land, to open the dual carriageway. 

 Chief minister H.D. Kumaraswamy has threatened to take over the project. Local people dug up a portion of the road last week.

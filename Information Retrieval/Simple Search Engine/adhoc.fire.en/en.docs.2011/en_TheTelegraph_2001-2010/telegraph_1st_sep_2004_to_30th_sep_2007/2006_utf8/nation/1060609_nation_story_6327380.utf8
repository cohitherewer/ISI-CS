 Kill a rebel, win 1 lakh from BJP

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Jammu, June 8: The BJP would turn Kashmir into the Wild West of Hollywood, with ordinary men and women hunting down and killing militants cowboy style.

 The party today announced a reward of Rs 1 lakh for any civilian slaying a rebel in Jammu and Kashmir, and a compensation of Rs 2 lakh for the families of those who lose their lives in the pursuit.

 This reward money is for all those nationalists willing to fight terror, be they Hindus or Muslims, be they men from the National Conference or Congress or BJP, party leader Vinay Katiyar told BJP activists here.

 The announcement comes on a day the US military announced the killing of one of the worlds most wanted terrorists. Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, al Qaidas chief in Iraq, however, was slain not by civilians but in an air strike by US forces.

 Katiyar said the party would pay Rs 1 lakh to a civilian killing one militant. The reward money will multiply in equal denomination for the number of militants killed.

 Such an incentive for ordinary people to kill ? echoing the wanted, dead or alive posters in cowboy movies is a first by an Indian political party.

 Pitch wrecker switches sides

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Jan. 28: Senior Shiv Sena leader Shishir Shinde, better known as the man who took Bal Thackerays opposition to Indo-Pak cricket diplomacy to the Wankhede stadium pitch, has quit the party and decided to join his bosss rebel nephew Raj.

 Shinde, who in 1991 led a group of Sena workers and damaged the pitch using shovels, sent his resignation letter to Thackeray yesterday, hurt by the Sena chiefs criticism.

 There are still many double dholkis (double-faceted dholaks) floating around. We dont know whether they are with us or whether they are not with us, Thackeray had said on Monday.

 The Sena chief also compared Shinde to Congress MLA Kripa Shankar Singh whom he lampooned as a compulsive hanger-on to the Congress power centre.

 Known to be close to Raj, and sidelined in the party after Thackerays son Uddhav took over as executive president in 2002, Shindes exit has not surprised many.

 Shinde said the references as a sycophant hurt. I have mentioned it in my letter. Such references to people who have worked for the party for 25 years is an insult to not just me but hundreds of grassroots workers, he said. 

 Shinde also expressed unhappiness with Uddhavs style of leadership.

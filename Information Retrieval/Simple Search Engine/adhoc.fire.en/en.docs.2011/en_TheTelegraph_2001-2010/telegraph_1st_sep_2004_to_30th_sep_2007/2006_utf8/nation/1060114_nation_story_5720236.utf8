 BJP booms at hypocrite 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 13: The BJP today accused the Prime Minister of hypocrisy and demanded law minister H.R. Bhardwajs resignation over the Centres move to get Ottavio Quattrocchis London bank accounts de-frozen.

 But the party shied away from explaining why the erstwhile Vajpayee regime had failed to challenge the Delhi High Court order on which the United Progressive Alliances move was based.

 The high court had dismissed the Bofors case for want of evidence when the National Democratic Alliance was still in power. Bhardwaj has cited this order to explain why the British authorities were told last month that the CBI lacked evidence to link Quattrocchis two London bank accounts with the Bofors payoffs.

 BJP general secretary Arun Jaitley said the CBIs failure to appeal against the high court order was the result of pressure from 10 Janpath. But he wouldnt discuss why the Vajpayee government had not filed an appeal.

 NDA partner Janata Dal (United), at odds with the BJP on the expulsion of the cash-for-questions MPs, joined the chorus for Bhardwajs resignation. But it regretted that the Vajpayee regime had not challenged the high court order.

 That is one of the biggest regrets, Dal (U) chief George Fernandes said. 

 Jaitley focused on the roles Sonia Gandhi and Manmohan Singh might have played in the reprieve of Quattrocchi, insisting it was a complete violation of the law. The law minister should be dismissed forthwith. So far as the Prime Minister is concerned, the whole affair has put a question mark on his credentials. 

 Since neither he nor any official in the PMO has bothered to explain whether or not he was aware of the decision, we presume he is as culpable as the law minister, Jaitley said.

 This unusual step has been taken to help Quattrocchi because of his proximity to Sonia Gandhi. Do we assume that Indian law is going to be different for Italian accused henceforth? he asked.

 The PMs proclamations about zero tolerance for corruption have proved to be totally false. His assertions on probity and transparency in public life have been established to be hypocritical. His credentials as a decent politician are now suspect.

 The strong language could be a ploy to get under the skin of the Prime Minister, who is extremely sensitive about his clean image.

 Fernandes echoed Jaitley on the reprieve, but said his partys stand on the expulsion of MPs would be different. 

 While the BJP has declared Speaker Somnath Chatterjees decision to hold an all-party meeting on the subject as inappropriate, Fernandes declared his party would attend it.

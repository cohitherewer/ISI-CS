 Hush-hush Maoist talks near Delhi draw blank

 BHARAT BHUSHAN

 New Delhi, March 16: The secret talks between the Nepalese Maoists and the seven-party alliance for democracy in the neighbourhood of Delhi have failed.

 The Maoists have accused the parties of having fallen victim to King Gyanendras machinations. Last-ditch efforts were on till late tonight to save the talks. 

 The Maoist endorsement of non-violence would have been a significant step forward in a society marred by violence for more than decade.

 This may not have resulted in the Maoists themselves joining peaceful agitation. It would have opened the way for their sympathisers to join a non-violent movement under the communist flag (although there are several communist parties in Nepal, their flag is the same). 

 They had also agreed to withdraw the blockade of the Kathmandu Valley, after the joint appeal. The blockade in the last three days has already led to soaring prices in the valley. 

 But this was not to be.

 The Maoists have now charged the seven-party alliance ? especially the Nepali Congress, led by Girija Prasad Koirala, and its breakaway faction, the Nepali Congress-Democratic of Sher Bahadur Deuba ? of playing into the hands of the monarchy. 

 For once, the fault does not seem to lie with the Maoists. It is Koirala and Deuba who have refrained from making the joint appeal. They seem hesitant to appear on the same political platform with the Maoists.

 The sticking point was whether there should be a joint appeal for peaceful agitation or whether it should be in the nature of an understanding, with the political parties and the Maoists making the same appeal separately. 

 The negotiators for the seven-party alliance had given an assurance to the Maoists that there would be joint appeal to the Nepalese people for non-violent agitation to restore democracy. Now, Koirala and Deuba have gone back on this assurance. 

 The draft joint appeal for non-violent and peaceful agitation was the result of talks held between the representatives of the seven-party alliance and the Maoists at an undisclosed location in the neighbourhood of Delhi over the last 10 days.

 The Maoists were represented in the talks by their ideologue Baburam Bhattarai and central committee member Krishna Bahadur Mahara.

 The negotiators from the political parties included Krishna Sitaula (Nepali Congress), Jhalanath Khanal and Bamdev Gautam (Communist Party of Nepal-United Marxist Leninist), Amik Sherchan (Jan Morcha) and Narayan Kajishreshtha (Ekta Kendra-Masal).

 The negotiators from Deubas Nepali Congress (Democratic) ? Bimlendra Nidhi and Pradeep Giri ? had been jailed by the King and could not participate in the talks. This initially created problems with Deuba refusing to endorse the understanding reached. He said his party had not been taken into confidence. 

 This was attributed by some to his being under the undue influence of the US, which does not want any political understanding between the parties and the Maoists. 

 The US prefers reconciliation between the monarchy and the political parties instead. US ambassador James F. Moriarty was the first foreign diplomat to meet Deuba after his release from jail. This was sufficient in Kathmandus conspiratorial society to suggest that Deuba was amenable to doing American bidding. 

 But the fear of political isolation and the prospect of a split in his own party forced Deuba to fall in line today. 

 However, he insisted that no joint appeal be made with the Maoists. 

 Deuba was not alone. Girija Prasad Koirala was also not in favour of a joint appeal. This had partly to do with some royalist sympathisers in his organisation and partly because he claimed he wanted to take India into confidence.

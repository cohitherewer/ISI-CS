 Gag on Team India, rivals and seniors make hay 

 SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI

Mumbai, Jan. 29: Pakistani players and Indian ex-cricketers are raking in the cash thanks to the Indian boards gag order to Rahul Dravids boys.

 Clamping down on a years-old practice, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) had banned the Indian players from getting into exclusive contracts with the media. The new rules said only the captain, coach and manager could address the media.

 So its goodbye to all those exclusive/first person quotes and comments from the Indian stars.

 This will not affect them financially in a big way, because earnings from the media form a very small part of the cricketers incomes, said Lokesh Sharma of 21st Century Media, which manages Dravid among others.

 But the ban has opened a window of opportunity for many others. Pakistans pin-up boy Shoaib Akhtar, for instance.

 Akhtar has firmed up a deal with a news channel for an undisclosed amount. Shahid Afridi had bargained hard with other channels to cover the series. At one point, the two Pakistanis demanded between $500 and $1,000 per day.

 The Pakistan board does not bar its players from providing media commentaries.

 They just need to take the boards permission. Its a procedure followed by cricket boards across the world, said Sandeep Gulrejani, India representative of London-based sports management company Athletes One, among whose clients is Anil Kumble.

 We hope the BCCI will take a less hardened stand on this issue once all the ongoing controversies fizzle out.

 I get the sense that the BCCI will allow the players to make media commentaries sometime later, but the whole process will be overseen and vetted by the media manager, said Jeet Banerjee, managing director, Gameplan Sports, which manages M.S. Dhoni.

 In the absence of the current Indian players, former cricketers like Kapil Dev, Chetan Chauhan and Saba Karim ? not to mention Navjot Singh Sidhu ? are much in demand.

 The ex-cricketers have overnight jacked up their prices and are demanding anywhere between Rs 50,000 and Rs 2 lakh per episode, depending on their star value. Even a few months ago, the prices had ranged between Rs 25,000 and Rs 1 lakh, depending on the duration of the appearance and the brand value of the ex-cricketer, a senior administrative official of an English news channel said.

 Even those who have long snapped ties with the game and have moved into showbiz are queuing up to deliver sound bites. TV actor Salil Ankola is now a regular on Zee News.

 In the future, news channels will tie up with players of countries with which India plays series. In the process, the Indian view would be obscured, limited as it would be to news conferences, Gulrejani said.

 The vice-president and managing director of the recently launched Janmat channel, too, feels that viewer interest would dip if the BCCI ban stays. 

 It is an undemocratic order by the BCCI. It will certainly bring down the brand value of cricket specials if Indian players are not allowed to give their point of view, Markand Adhikari said.

 A senior Janmat source said the channel was keen to have Kumble as a commentator for the Indo-Pak series, but the gag order came in the way.

 Kumble had a big contract with a channel and is trying to get Pawars permission, which in the current scheme of things seems unlikely, confirmed a top BCCI source.

 The hero of Lahore, Virender Sehwag, has received a letter from the board for violating the gag order. Sehwag had written a column in an English daily a couple of days ago.

 Celebrity endorsement companies handling cricketers, however, say the board order will not affect their business.

 We are talking to the BCCI?. It is possible that endorsement companies and media agents will work together with the BCCI in future, said a top official from Percept Dmark.

 Board vice-president Lalit Modi declined to comment.

 The board has decided not to punish the players who have already violated the norms; but future violators will be disciplined.

 Infosys Kerala signal

 Bangalore, Jan. 14: A few days after Infosys announced that it was looking outside Bangalore for its future growth, Karnataka chief minister N. Dharam Singh has promised to develop infrastructure in Bangalore city, reports our special correspondent.

 But his promise came the same day that Infosys announced it was allotted 50 acres in Kerala. 

 Infosys said it has expanded its presence in Kerala by signing an agreement to set up a facility in a special economic zone in capital Thiruvananthapuram.

 The company had said it was looking outside Bangalore for future projects owing to non-availability of land and poor infrastructure. Singh today sought to allay such fears and promised to develop infrastructure, saying: We have plans for good roads, better traffic management and air-conditioned city buses.

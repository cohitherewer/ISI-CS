 Salary damper for pvt teachers

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 24: Teachers in unaided private schools cannot claim salaries on a par with their counterparts in government schools, the Supreme Court has ruled.

 The unaided schools were not bound to pay the amount of money that teachers in aided and government schools receive in the absence of a statutory rule or government order, Justice H. K. Sema said last week while upholding a Calcutta High Court verdict. 

 On a petition from some teachers of a Calcutta school, a single-judge bench of the high court had directed the director of school education in the Bengal government to enforce parity and remove the discrimination in pay scales and dearness allowances. The school management contested the order, which was set aside by a division bench of the same court. The teachers then approached the apex court. 

 Decades of worker-friendly governments in Bengal have not ensured a legal provision that entitles teachers in a recognised private school to claim salary and other benefits equivalent to that of government schoolteachers.

 In contrast, the Delhi School Education Act 1973 makes it mandatory for recognised schools to maintain pay and allowances including medical facilities, pension, gratuity, provident fund and other benefits available to government school employees. The Delhi government can withdraw recognition of those found to be in breach of the law. 

 The Supreme Court said there was no ground to interfere with the order of Calcutta High Courts division bench that had rightly set aside the single judges directive. 

 Dismissing the appeal by teachers seeking to invoke the equal pay for equal work principle, the apex court said if such demands were conceded, private schools would pass on the burden to students, whose parents would have to pay higher fees. This would put education beyond the reach of poor children.

 The court urged the Calcutta teachers to make a little sacrifice in the interest of the nation, saying their profession is a noble one.

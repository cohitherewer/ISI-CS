The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Parting at party, patch-up on telly

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Rakhi (top) and Mika 

 New Delhi, June 13: A melodramatic Rakhi Sawant comes on television to demand an apology from Mika Singh for kissing her forcibly; Mika tells the news anchor he plans to go and meet her the following day; the anchor tries his best to bring about a rapprochement. 

 This could well be a pointer of things to come, with news channels increasingly playing peace broker between public figures in the middle of a private spat.

 According to television bosses, there has always been an audience for soap operas on news channels but it is rapidly growing now.

 There is a definite niche in news reporting for such dramas to be played out on television. More and more people are watching episodes like this one concerning Rakhi Sawant, said Rajdeep Sardesai, editor-in-chief of CNN-IBN. 

 The niche has largely been restricted to serious public interest events in the past.

 In April 2002, for instance, the BBC had organised a rendezvous for divided Korean families. Nearly a hundred elderly South Koreans travelled by boat to the meeting point, the remote North Korean resort of Diamond Mountain. 

 This was while the two governments were still officially at war.

 The emotional scenes, telecast live, moved public sentiment and the two governments soon had to officially start the process of reunification of divided families.

 Following last years earthquake in Kashmir, an Indian channel had helped divided families get in touch.

 Be it Korea, or be it Rakhi Sawant, it is the human interest which makes people watch it, said Sardesai.

 Uday Shankar of Star News, however, believes news channels end up as mediators between warring celebrities by accident. 

 News reporters have a responsibility only to bring out news, clarify doubts in any issue, he said. If in the process, an understanding between sparring celebrities is brought about, this would be welcome.

 Shankar feels the Rakhi Sawant issue has been blown out of proportion. By spending hours on an issue like this, TV news loses credibility, he said.

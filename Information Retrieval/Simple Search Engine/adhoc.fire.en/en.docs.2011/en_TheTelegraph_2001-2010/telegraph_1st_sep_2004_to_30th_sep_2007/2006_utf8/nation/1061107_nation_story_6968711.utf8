 Private land tonic for job scheme

 DHIRENDRA K. JHA

 New Delhi, Nov. 6: The Centre is planning a series of amendments to guidelines and provisions in the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act to remove the roadblocks to the implementation of the scheme. 

 The need for the changes was felt in the wake of continuing poor performance of the UPA governments flagship programme even 10 months after it was launched.

 According to official sources, the ministry of rural development is seriously thinking of bringing horticultural activities on private land belonging to scheduled caste and scheduled tribe families within the ambit of the job scheme.

 The guidelines in the act do not allow taking up work on private land. If they are changed, labourers belonging to SC/ST families would get wages even for working on their own fields. The government would also provide seeds, fertilisers and other horticultural inputs for these families along with extra working hands, if required, the sources said.

 Another proposed change is allowing payment of daily wages to labourers for working on barren plots belonging to SC/ST families to turn them into cultivable land.

 Ministry officials feel these amendments would not only attract more labourers from SC/ST families but also help provide them sustainable sources of income.

 Another hurdle identified by the ministry is the acts provision that a minimum of 50 labourers must demand employment at a particular place to undertake work under the scheme, a senior official said, adding that the number often proves too big in tribal and hilly areas. The ministry is, therefore, planning to reduce it to 10.

 As this provision of a mandatory 50 labourers is part of the act, and not that of the guidelines, the NREGA has to be amended in Parliament. The ministry is considering getting the amendment done during the winter session, the official said. 

 Another change in the guidelines the ministry is contemplating is making the transfer of wages to labourers more transparent.

 Most states pay wages in cash, which leaves enough scope for cuts and other forms of malpractice. The ministry, therefore, wants a provision that payment of wages must be made to accounts in banks and post offices.

 Across the Karnataka rural belt, wages are paid to accounts in banks and post offices. 

 The ministry expects after some teething problems, labourers most of whom are not familiar with bank transactions would get used to the practice.

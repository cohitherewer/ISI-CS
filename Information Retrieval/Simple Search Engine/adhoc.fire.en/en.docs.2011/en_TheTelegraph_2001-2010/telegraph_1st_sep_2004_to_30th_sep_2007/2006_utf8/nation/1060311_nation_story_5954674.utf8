 Centre rapped with Iran stick

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 10: The CPM politburo has rapped the UPA government for not playing its due role on the Iran issue at the International Atomic Energy Agency session in February.

 We have discussed the fallout of the Iran issue. We believe the UPA government has not played its due role at the IAEA session, politburo member Sitaram Yechury said after the politburo meeting today. 

 The meeting will be followed by a two-day central committee meeting over the weekend. 

 The meeting began on a sombre note but speculation about Sourav Ganguly campaigning for the CPM in the Bengal Assembly polls brought some humour. Asked if the former Indian captain would campaign for the CPM, Yechury joked: He may bat for us but we have no bowlers.

 The CPM has a running battle with the Centre on two fronts ? economic and foreign policies. If the party is unhappy with the Manmohan Singh government for wooing foreign direct investment, it is equally, if not more, miffed with the Centre cosying up to the George W. Bush regime.

 In many ways, the UPA governments foreign policy seems to hurt the CPM more than its economic reforms. 

 In a hard-hitting statement, the politburo said: It is unfortunate and regrettable that the UPA government by voting with the US, EU-3 and others in the February board meeting has been party to the Iran issue going to the UN Security Council.

 It is thanks to the UPA governments capitulation to US pressure that India stands with the bellicose, illegal stand of the Bush administration. This is against our vital interests. 

 CPM general secretary Prakash Karat has said his partys differences with the government on foreign policy are growing wider by the day. 

 In fact, soon after India voted with the US against Iran at the IAEA session in Vienna, the Left parties had considered quitting the UPA-Left coordination committee on the grounds that they are not being able to influence government policies.

 Later, they changed their minds and instead focused on two strategies: to highlight the Iran issue more in Parliament and to coordinate with like-minded parties like the Samajwadi Party. 

 In todays statement, the politburo said: The US has made it clear that it expects a quick decision in the Security Council on how to proceed against Iran. The US was instrumental in rejecting a Russian proposal which would have resolved the issue by allowing a small amount of enrichment of fuel for research purposes under IAEA safeguards.

 BJP balm for Varun

 Varun: Sulking in silence

 New Delhi, Oct. 9: The BJP is trying to make it up to Varun Gandhi after the Vidisha fiasco. The question is have the party bosses gone too far in humiliating Sanjay Gandhis son?

 Varun has clammed up, refusing to meet reporters or BJP leaders eager to placate him. More than the denial of the Vidisha ticket, what the youngster reportedly resents is the betrayal that the party first made him a promise, let it be publicised and then dumped him.

 Following the central election committee meeting last Friday when the BJP decided to field local aspirant Ram Pal Singh as the partys official candidate from Vidisha, all the top BJP and RSS leaders have tried to pacify Varun with various promises.

 According to sources, BJP chief Rajnath Singh has told Varun he will be made a party secretary and given charge of two states. The BJP is holding its internal elections. By December, Rajnath is likely to be re-elected party president for a fresh term of three years. He will then select his team of party office-bearers.

 Varun has been told he could be awarded the post of BJP spokesperson along with being a secretary. He knows the party will need him to campaign during the run-up to the Uttar Pradesh elections in May next year.

 Despite the offers pouring in, Varun has been absolutely quiet. While he had earlier told L.K. Advani that he wanted to be a general secretary, he has not repeated the demand in the last four days. This has led to concern in some quarters that Varuns association with the BJP may be under threat.

 However, most top leaders feel Varun will sulk for a while and then come around. What are his political options? asked a senior leader. He cant possibly join the Congress, given the equation between his mother (Maneka Gandhi) and aunt (Sonia Gandhi).

 However, it is largely not known that despite the hostility between his mother and aunt, Varun has a good relationship with his cousins, particularly Priyanka Gandhi.

 A source said: After all, Maneka has nursed the Pilibhit seat for so long for her son. There is a possibility of him contesting it on a Congress ticket. Anything is possible. There is a very big chance of Varun joining the Congress. 

 Whether he joins the Congress or not, Varun is definitely going to use the Vidisha episode to drive a hard bargain with the BJP. Unless the party awards him the general secretarys post, he is likely to keep his adopted party guessing about his future plans.

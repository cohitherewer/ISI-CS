 Mufti clears air on self-rule

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Srinagar, Oct. 28: Under pressure from ally Congress and Opposition National Conference to explain the contours of its self-rule proposal, the Peoples Democratic Party today said it sought a solution to the Kashmir conflict within the Indian Constitution.

 This is the first comprehensive explanation given by the PDP since it openly lent support to the idea floated by Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf.

 Our self-rule seeks a solution to the Kashmir issue within the Constitution of India and it is a first step towards that, PDP leader Mufti Mohammad Sayeed said to a gathering of thousands. It will restore the dignity of the people of Jammu and Kashmir.

 The statement, which comes a day before Mufti is scheduled to visit New York to address the UN General Assembly as the head of an unofficial Indian delegation, was aimed at shoring up support for his proposal.

 By self-rule, Mufti said, he meant that Article 356 which allows dismissal of state governments by the President would not be applicable to Jammu and Kashmir. We also should have an elected governor who should be a citizen of J amp;K.

 The former chief minister said the three main regions of the state Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh should have separate provincial assemblies, which would ensure equal development.

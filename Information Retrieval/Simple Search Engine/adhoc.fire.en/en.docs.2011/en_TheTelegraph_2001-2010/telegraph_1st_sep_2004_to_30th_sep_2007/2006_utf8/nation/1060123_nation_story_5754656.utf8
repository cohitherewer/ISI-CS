 Stamp on Bush N-deal

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Hyderabad, Jan. 22: The Congress plenary today endorsed the UPA governments nuclear energy deal with America as well as its Iran policy, setting aside whatever uneasiness it had felt on these issues.

 The resolution on external security and international affairs also backed the peace initiatives with Pakistan while praising the governments efforts at defence preparedness.

 Some of those who drafted the resolution apparently had doubts over some of the Indo-US nuclear pacts features, but the Prime Minister is said to have brushed their misgivings aside.

 Manmohan Singh reportedly argued that if the GDP has to grow at over 8 per cent, India needs Americas cooperation in the nuclear fuel sector.

 The party eventually described the July 2005 agreement as a diplomatic achievement and underlined that it was based on the principle of reciprocity. It felt the countrys future strategies in the sector would be guided by its ability to take advantage of emerging opportunities.

 The resolution noted that the Centres principled stand on nuclear proliferation and its September 2005 vote against Iran at the International Atomic Energy Agency had caused some disquiet.

 The Congress notes that the matter came to vote despite strenuous efforts by India to avoid that eventuality, the resolution, moved by former foreign minister Karan Singh, said.

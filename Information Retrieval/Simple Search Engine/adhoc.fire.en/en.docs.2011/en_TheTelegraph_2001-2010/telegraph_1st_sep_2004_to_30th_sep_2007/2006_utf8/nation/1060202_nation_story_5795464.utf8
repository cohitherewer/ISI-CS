The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Between glib amp; grave

 SUJAN DUTTA

 New Delhi, Feb. 1: The grey moustache and beard barely conceal the twitch of the smiling lips. Manmohan Singh sells an everyday, everyman ordinary Prime Minister. That he is not. He is now jockeying the buckling horse called governance and between his September 2004 press conference and todays media anchoring, he has begun to enjoy the ride.

 Neither his predecessor Atal Bihari Vajpayee, nor his mentor Narasimha Rao would dare perform in the main hall of Vigyan Bhavan the way he has. Verbosity has replaced pregnant silences; twitching lips the pout. For all of 90 minutes, Singh kept finding the golden mean between the glib and the grave. 

 How boring!

 But thats the message. Judge me not by what others say of me, but what my government does?. Proof of the pudding is in the eating.? Rome was not built in a day ? Cliches that would not find their way into the modern speechwriters text but, hell, real life is boring.

 The keyword in Singhs message today is harmonise. He believes, he can harmonise differences between the Left and the UPA on economic policy, between the party and the government, between himself and Musharraf, between India and the US on Iran and between India and the US on civilian nuclear technology.

 His media adviser Sanjay Baru described the event as a national press conference. Between September 2004 and today, Singh has met the press at least 20 times ? mostly during official tours.

 Its the equivalent of his State of the Union address, was the immediate response of Moroccan journalist Mohammad Kamal who represented the Moroccan Press Agency. Putin did it day before, Bush yesterday and it is the Indian Prime Minister today. 

 And, hell do it again next year, Baru has promised.

 Its great actually, says John Eliot of Fortune magazine. Here is a man who has fielded questions on every subject for all of 90 minutes. It was a Prime Minister who was well prepared.

 Tutored, more likely. Like a professor prepares for his classes.

 In September 2004 he was more natural, ruffled the Lefts feathers a bit, was unsure whether he would invite unnecessary vitriol from the BJP. But 17 months down the line, and convinced that the Left will be the Left and the BJP the BJP, he can risk a little more with his politics. 

 His answers to questions on economic and fiscal policy are much more substantial than his answers to the more difficult (mostly political) questions. So short, in fact, that it can make the questioner look silly. It is another matter that journalists are paid to ask silly questions.

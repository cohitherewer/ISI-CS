 VP Singh (top) and Vajpayee: Memoir missile 

 New Delhi, June 26: V.P. Singh has shaken up the BJP by claiming that Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Jaswant Singh had planned to quit the party and float a new one with him 18 years ago.

 BJP spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad today dubbed the former Prime Minister a master of doublespeak while Jaswant dismissed his contention as fiction.

 VP makes the claim in his memoirs, recorded by journalist Ram Bahadur Rai in a book titled Manzil Se Zyada Safar (Journey Beyond the Destination) and published by Rajkamal Prakashan.

 In the chapter Morcha Dar Morcha (From One Forum to Another), VP talks about his discussions with senior BJP leaders before the birth of the Janata Dal on October 11, 1988. The party was formed by merging the Jan Morcha, Janata Party, Lok Dal and Congress (S) to bring together all centrist groups opposed to the Rajiv Gandhi government.

 Jaswant Singh was of the view that instead of such a merger, we should try and collect leaders with a clean image and high credibility from all political parties. Such people together should float their own political party. This was a serious proposal, VP says.

 Jaswant denied the claim. Such suggestions are better known as fiction, not memoirs, he said.

 BJP leaders dont need a certificate of loyalty from V.P. Singh, who is known for switching sides and betraying friends and allies, said Prasad.

 The BJP has reason to be worried. The book contains significant details about Jaswants alleged efforts to pressure Vajpayee into quitting the party and forming a new one.

 Atal Bihari Vajpayee was very unhappy with the BJP at the time. He backed the proposal to wean away select leaders from all political formations and float a new party. Bhairon Singh Shekhawat, too, supported the venture, VP says.

 Once he (Vajpayee) came to my house. He told me to go ahead with selecting leaders from different parties. I assumed that if all such select leaders together formed a new party, Vajpayee was not going to stay in the BJP. It was not possible for him to come with us and be with the BJP at the same time.

 VP claims that soon after he had resigned from the Congress, Jaswant came to his house.

 He encouraged me? said I had taken the right decision. He was constantly in touch with me, advised me on a number of occasions. He was of the view that I should get all the good leaders together on one platform. I respect him a lot. He helped me during a very difficult period.

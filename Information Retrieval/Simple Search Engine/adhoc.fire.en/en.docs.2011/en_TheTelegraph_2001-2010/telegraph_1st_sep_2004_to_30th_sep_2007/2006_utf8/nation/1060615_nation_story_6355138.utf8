The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Vajpayee in line of fire

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 14: The BJP is in danger of being haunted by the irrepressible Pramod Mahajan for a long while after his death.

 The harassed party brass had not even recovered from his son Rahul getting caught in a narcotics abuse case when brother Praveen, who stunned the nation when he opened fire on Pramod in April, launched an attack on Atal Bihari Vajpayee.

 This has been happening for the past five-six years?. Did the former Prime Minister know about it? If he did, what did he do? If he did not know, what was he doing in six years of rule? Praveen asked, referring to the bash that left Pramods secretary Bibek Moitra dead and Rahul in hospital.

 The party on June 1 at which drugs are suspected to have been consumed was held at 7, Safdarjung Road, Mahajans official residence.

 Before he became Prime Minister in 1999, Vajpayee had been the occupant of the house, which the BJP considers so lucky it released its 2004 election manifesto from there. 

 Vajpayee was silent even as his junior colleagues groped for a suitable response to Praveens dramatic statements, made to the media in Mumbai outside court. Praveen is facing trial for the murder of his brother.

 The day had started on an unpleasant note for the party with reports of expelled leader Madan Lal Khuranas wild charges against the top brass and Pramod. 

 BJP spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad summoned the media this afternoon to respond to Khuranas charges. Madan Lal Khurana is angry and frustrated. He has been levelling ridiculous and frivolous charges against our leaders and Pramod Mahajan who is no more, he said.

 Just as he had finished denying Khuranas charges, Prasad was hounded for comments on Praveens revelations that were aired on television through the day. Praveen Mahajan is the principal accused in killing his brother and a prominent leader of the BJP. We will not take cognizance of his utterances, he said. 

 Praveen had also alleged the Mahajan family was being held hostage by tentwallahs, a reference to Sudhanshu Mittal, who was at Apollo Hospital when Rahul and Bibek were rushed there from the party. Mittals father ran the biggest tenthouse business in Delhi.

 An associate of Pramod and a BJP insider, Mittal is close to Rajnath Singh. I have known Rajnath Singhji since he was in the BJPs youth wing, he had said recently.

 The BJP was not too pleased about Mittals name being mentioned in the same breath as Vajpayees. Despite his proximity to Rajnath, he carries a somewhat unsavoury reputation. 

 Mittal took his cue from the BJP spokesperson and refused comment on Praveens charges. I am not going to sanctify the statement of a criminal, he said.

 Sadly for the party, this is not the end of the Mahajan saga. Praveen has promised more revelations and Rahuls case is a long way from coming to trial.

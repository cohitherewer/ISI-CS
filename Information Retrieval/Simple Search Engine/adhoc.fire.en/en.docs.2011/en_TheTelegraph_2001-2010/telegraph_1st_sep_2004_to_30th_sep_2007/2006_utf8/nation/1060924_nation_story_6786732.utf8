 Fernandes hints at Dal exit

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 23: Former Janata Dal (United) president George Fernandes has said he does not care if his relationship with party colleagues Nitish Kumar and Sharad Yadav as well as the BJP falls apart because of his growing proximity to Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav.

 He said: None of them (Nitish, Sharad or the BJP) wants me and I dont think they will miss me. 

 The once-firebrand socialist has been feeling marginalised after losing the election for the partys top post to Sharad Yadav early this year

 Talking to a news channel, the leader said his decision to attend next months gathering of socialists in Lucknow along with Mulayam is irreversible. The conference is scheduled for October 12 to mark the death anniversary of Ram Manohar Lohia. 

 The National Democratic Alliance convener admitted that his invitation to Mulayam to the function would create a rift between him and the BJP. Yes, of course, the BJP does want to defeat Mulayam but I have always stood by him and will do so in the meeting, too.

 When asked if he was thinking of resigning from the Dal (U) and quitting his Lok Sabha seat, Fernandes quipped: So be it.

 Fernandes maintained he and Mulayam had been together for almost 40 years, recalling their days in the Socialist Party. He also said Mulayam was the only man who understood what the Tehelka incident was and stood by me.

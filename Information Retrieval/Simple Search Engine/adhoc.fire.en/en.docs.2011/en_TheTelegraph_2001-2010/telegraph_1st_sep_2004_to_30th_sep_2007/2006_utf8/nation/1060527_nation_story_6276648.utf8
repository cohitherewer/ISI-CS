 NRIs fight for marriage rights

 Durban (PTI): 

 Two South African women of Indian origin have charged that 

 their constitutional rights have been violated by the failure 

 of the law to recognise their religious marriages.

 Nazeema Du Toit of Cape Town and 

 Suchitra Singh of Durban said they have been married for 

 28 years and 19 years, respectively, according to Muslim 

 and Hindu rites but the marriage act did not recognise their 

 religious marriages.

 Du Toit, who was divorced by her husband in 2002, has alleged that he denied her a share of the assets.

 She said her application to the high court for recognition of the marriage was turned down. 

 I had then appealed to the appellate division but this was also turned down. Then I took the matter to the constitutional court and this week, the court ruled that my marriage was not recognised as it was not registered according to the South African marriage act, a media report quoted her as saying.

 Singh, who was married according to Hindu religious rites in 1987, did not want any monetary benefits from her estranged husband, Jailall Rampersad, but a legal divorce so that she could get on with my life.

 50 injured in cylinder blast

 Mumbai (PTI): 

 At least 50 people were injured when an LPG cylinder exploded 

 in central Mumbai.

 The injured, residents of Shiv 

 Nagar chawl, were rushed to hospital, where the condition 

 of some of them is reported to be serious, police said.

 Police and fire brigade personnel have rushed to the spot and the fire, caused by the explosion, has been controlled.

 Ayodhya date

 Faizabad (PTI): 

 A district court has extended the judicial remand of five 

 accused in the terrorist attack in Ayodhya on July 5, 2005, 

 and fixed June 9 for the next hearing.

 The accused had sought more time 

 as they had found a lawyer to defend them. The bar association 

 had appealed to advocates not to take up their case.

 Spring in throat

 Madurai (PTI): 

 A minute spring stuck in the throat of an 

 11-year-old boy has been removed in a one-hour endoscopic 

 surgery at a hospital here. The boy is on the way to recovery 

 and is eating food without any difficulty. If the spring 

 had slid into the windpipe, the boy would have died, a doctor 

 said 

 Mild tremor

 Jammu (PTI): 

 An earthquake of 4.7 magnitude was felt along the Jammu 

 and Kashmir-Himachal Pradesh border at 6.12 am on Friday, 

 the Met department said.

 The National Federation for the Blind will bring out a Tamil fortnightly magazine in Braille. This will be the first Braille magazine in an Indian language.

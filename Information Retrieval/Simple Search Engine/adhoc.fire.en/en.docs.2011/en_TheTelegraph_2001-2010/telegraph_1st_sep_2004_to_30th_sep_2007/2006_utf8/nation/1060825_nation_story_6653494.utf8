 Ruia pushes shipyard plan

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Aug. 24: Jessop chairman Pawan Ruia today said his proposed shipyard in Haldia would be one of Asias biggest.

 Accompanied by officials from Jessop, Ruia met Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee this evening and made a power-point presentation on the project.

 Representatives from Ruias Singapore-based consultant Langbridge Associates PTE also accompanied him to the meeting.

 The company plans to build a yard in Jellingham Canal at Haldia. While the first phase would involve an investment of Rs 2,200 crore, another Rs 1,000 crore would be pumped into the second phase that involves shipbreaking, a mini steel plant, a rolling mill and a captive power plant.

 Oder shonge onek alochona hoyechhe (weve had long discussions with them), the chief minister said.

 We need around 1,500 acres of land for the project. We want the state governments intervention in securing it from Calcutta Port Trust, Ruia said after the meeting.

 The land belongs to the port trust but is leased out to Burn Standard.

 Ruia has reportedly requested Bhattacharjee to write to the ministry of surface transport for handing over the land to Jessop.

 The yard will have a capacity to build 12 ships annually, including Panamax ships, and will repair around 20 vessels. Once we get the land approval, we will take 24 months to begin production, Ruia said.

 The company will raise an equity of around Rs 440 crore, which will be partly funded by an Initial Public Offer, while foreign banks and financial institutions will provide loans, he said. The West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation will have a 2.5 per cent stake in the project.

 According to Ruia, the project would provide to around 16,000 people. This will be one of the biggest shipyards in Asia and the largest employment generating project in recent times.

 The Jessop boss also plans to take over the state-owned Shalimar Works and get part of the initial construction of the shipyard project done by it.

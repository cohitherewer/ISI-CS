 Stung 5 ask for proof of shame

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 4: The five Lok Sabha MPs, who were caught on camera in the cash-for-works scam, have pleaded not guilty and asked to see the unedited tapes of the sting operation.

 In similar replies to the notice the Lok Sabha secretariat served on them earlier this week, the five alleged they were framed and the images were doctored. They also sought time to give their version to the seven-member P.K. Bansal panel, which is probing the scandal.

 The ethics committee of the Rajya Sabha and the Bansal panel of the Lok Sabha are probing the conduct of the seven MPs ? two are from the upper House ? who were shown accepting or demanding bribes to sanction projects under the member of Parliament local area development (MPLAD) scheme. They are expected to submit their reports by the end of this month.

 One of the MPs, C.P. Singh of the BJP, has already been expelled from the Lok Sabha for his involvement in the cash-for-questions scam, which broke days before the second scandal.

 The Bansal panel is likely to meet next week and decide when the members should be asked to depose before it. Sources said the panels term is unlikely to be extended beyond January.

 Three of the six BJP MPs who were expelled in the cash-for-posers scam today moved Delhi High Court for restoration of their memberships. Yesterday, two other expelled MPs ? Narendra Kumar Kushwaha of the BSP and Manoj Kumar of the RJD ? had filed similar applications.

 The petitioners also urged the court to restrain the Election Commission from issuing a notification for byelections to fill up the vacancies caused by their expulsion.

 In separate applications filed by their lawyers, the three expelled BJP members ? Suresh Chandel, C.P. Singh and Y.G. Mahajan ? said their expulsion was illegal and unconstitutional.

 SC rebuff

 The Supreme Court today refused to allow urgent hearing to expelled Lok Sabha MP Raja Ram Pal of the BSP who was caught accepting money in the cash-for-question scam. 

 Chief Justice Y.K. Sabharwal said there was no urgency in the matter and it will be heard on January 16 as fixed by the registry.

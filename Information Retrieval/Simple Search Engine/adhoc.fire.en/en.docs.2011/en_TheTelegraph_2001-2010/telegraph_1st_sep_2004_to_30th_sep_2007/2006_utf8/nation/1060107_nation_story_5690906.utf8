 Jaya jolt to DMK chief

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chennai, Jan. 6: Jayalalithaa has forced a court case on M. Karunanidhi just when he was preparing for the big fight at the booths three months away.

 The case lodged by the state police relates to a bridge on the Amarvathi in Karur, built when the DMK boss was chief minister, part of whose approach road caved in recently.

 Karunanidhi has accused Jayalalithaa of political vendetta, saying it was a private firm (Chennai-based East Coast Consultants and Infrastructures Ltd) that had built the Rs 13-crore bridge on a build-operate-transfer basis.

 The firm was to build the bridge, collect a toll till it recovered its costs, and only then hand the bridge over.

 Two others have been named as accused: K.A. Nambiar, who was chief secretary when the bridge came up, and Malathi, who was secretary, municipal administration and water supply.

 Soon after Jayalalithaa ousted Karunanidhi from power in the previous election in 2001, she had got him (then 77) arrested from his home at midnight.

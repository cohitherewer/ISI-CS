 Congress puts price on party office

 RASHEED KIDWAI

Bhopal, June 19: In Madhya Pradesh, the cash-starved 

Congress is taxing its speakers to pay its bills.

 The party office is rented out to leaders for Rs 1,000 a session, with even the official spokesman not spared.

 Every time he decides to take on the states ruling BJP or praise the Manmohan Singh government at the Centre, he has to cough up Rs 1,000. If he were to do his job on all working days, the spokesman would be paying around Rs 25,000 a month out of his own pocket.

 A brainchild of the state unit chief, Subhash Yadav, the offending circular issued by accountant Shavan has almost made the office defunct, with senior leaders staying away.

 Leader of the Opposition Jamuna Devi, a vocal critic of chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan, prefers to operate from home instead of paying to hold a news conference.

 The fourth-floor office at Jawahar Bhavan looks stark and deserted, minus the bustle associated with a political party.

 Yadav declined to comment, saying this was an internal matter of the party.

 General secretary Manak Aggrawal, who doubles as spokesman, admitted that the Rs 1,000-a-day fee was hurting the partys interests but blamed running costs and lack of resources for it.

 The Congresss only source of income is sale of donation coupons, priced at Rs 100, Rs 500 and Rs 1,000. But since its government was voted out of power in December 2003, there are few takers for the coupons.

 The All-India Congress Committee sends Rs 2,00,000 a month, which is inadequate for paying the salary of 25 employees, the electricity and telephone bills and other expenses, he said.

 There are over 200 state committee officials, who have to make do with two telephones that offer only local call facilities. Visitors are turned away without the customary cup of tea. For months, the lift was not working till AICC treasurer Motilal Vora sent a separate cheque for its maintenance.

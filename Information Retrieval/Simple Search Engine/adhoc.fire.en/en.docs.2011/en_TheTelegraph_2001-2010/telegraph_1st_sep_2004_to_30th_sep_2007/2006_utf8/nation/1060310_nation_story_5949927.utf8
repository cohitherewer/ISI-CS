 Mulayam holds fire

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 9: The Samajwadi Party has decided to keep its pledge of pressing for a no-confidence motion against Centre in abeyance.

 Sources said the decision was taken to deprive the BJP of taking advantage of the rift among secular parties.

 The Samajwadi Party had said it would carry out the threat if India votes against Iran at the IAEA board meeting slated to be held from March 6. But the party decided to blink to cosy up to the Congress.

 This comes in the wake of Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav finding the Congress leaderships attitude positive after the Varanasi blasts.

 Less than a month ago, the party had sung a different tune. 

 The Congress-led UPA government has twice voted against Iran, reversing the established foreign policies of the country. There will be another IAEA meeting on March 6 and we warn the government that we will bring a no-confidence motion if this time, too, India votes against Iran, the partys general secretary, Ram Gopal Yadav, had said on February 15.

 Samajwadi Party sources said the warning was meant to send a message to the Muslim electorate in Uttar Pradesh.

 Anyway, we do not have the adequate number on our own in Parliament. Also, if the BJP supports our no-confidence motion, it will send a wrong signal to the masses, Samajwadi MP Mohan Singh said.

 The blasts in Varanasi and the BJPs bid to use them as a tool to revive its fortunes seem to have triggered a change in the Samajwadi heart. If Lalu (Prasad Yadav) can work so closely with the Congress, why not Mulayam? Singh asked.

 Bhagalpur probe

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, Feb. 24: The Nitish Kumar government today announced that a new single-member judicial commission will probe the 1989 Bhagalpur communal riots and its aftermath.

 The commission, which will submit its final report in six months, overrides all earlier investigation, prosecution and rehabilitation attempts made by the government.

 The state cabinet approved the setting up of the new commission and the chief minister made a request to the Patna High Court chief justice to suggest the name of a judge ? sitting or retired ? to head the same.

 Previous Rashtriya Janata Dal governments headed by Lalu Prasad and Rabri Devi have faced constant criticism for adopting a lackadaisical approach towards investigation, prosecution and rehabilitation of the pogrom victims.

 Victims of the Bhagalpur riots did not get justice and the matter needs to be revisited. Despite evidence, 27 riot cases were closed and final report submitted by the earlier governments. These cases will be reopened. Those guilty of hushing up the cases will also be identified by the commission, Nitish said after the cabinet meeting.

 The probe panel will find out if the investigating agencies (police) did their work properly. It will also identify the factors due to which investigation was not completed and many of the convicted were set free.

 The quantum of loss of property and restoration of the same will be fixed by the commission. It will also suggest concrete measures for rehabilitation of the victims, cabinet secretary Shashi Shekhar Sharma said.

 The government also announced measures for the rehabilitation of weavers affected by the riots. The government will reimburse to the banks the principal amount of loans advanced to the riot-affected. It has also made a request to the banks to waive the interest that had accrued on these loans, the cabinet secretary said.

 The government will ensure that electricity disputes of the weavers and other entrepreneurs were settled without delay. A reassessment of all electricity disputes in Bhagalpur till December 2005 will also be done. New meters will be installed so that power supply to the weavers and others is smoothly restored. 

 Cop test

 In another decision, the government today ordered a re-examination for the recruitment of nearly 10,000 constables and 1,535 assistant police sub-inspectors. 

 There were serious irregularities in the selections. All candidates who had applied in response to the 2004 advertisement will get a chance to appear in a re-test. The procedure will be totally transparent, the chief minister said.

 Partys over in public places

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 13: The capitals parks and streets are off-limits for weddings and other parties, Delhi High Court ruled today.

 The court also warned that it would take serious measures if the authorities failed to stop the use of loudspeakers or other public address systems in these places.

 The interim order was issued on a PIL filed by a voluntary organisation, Patanjali Shiksha Sanstha, which said people, especially students preparing for examinations, were being harassed because of noisy programmes held in public places.

 Weddings and festivities in public places are common in the capital and often result in traffic snarls and noise pollution. 

 Counsel Y.K. Kapoor argued that the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) and the government departments concerned had failed to take any action against the organisers of such programmes.

 However, the ruling got a mixed response from residents welfare associations.

 K.N. Gujral, the president of one of the largest associations in the city at Rohini, said it would hit the poor the hardest as they would not be able to afford the luxury of banquet halls. Marriage halls will end up being the beneficiaries. The government should immediately initiate steps to provide something for the poor. 

 He added that the nuisance could have been checked had the MCD been responsible in carrying out its duties.

 Gujrals views, however, had few takers in north Delhi, which has borne the brunt of many a boisterous celebration. An elderly resident of Mukherjee Nagar said the high courts ruling should have come years ago.

 The court posted the matter for further hearing on February 27 and issued notices to the Delhi government, the MCD, the Delhi Development Authority, the Union ministry of urban development and the commissioner of Delhi police.

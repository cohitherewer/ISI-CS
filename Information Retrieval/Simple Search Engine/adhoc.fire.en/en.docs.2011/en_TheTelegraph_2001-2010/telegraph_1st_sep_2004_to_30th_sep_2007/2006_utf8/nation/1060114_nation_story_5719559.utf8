 Ex-CM homes

 New Delhi, Jan. 13 (PTI): The Supreme Court today decided to examine whether ex-chief ministers could be provided with government accommodation on the lines of former Presidents and Prime Ministers.

 A bench of Chief Justice Y.K. Sabharwal and Justices C.K. Thakker and R.V. Raveendran issued notices to the Centre and all states on a PIL alleging that large-scale violation of rules has been taking place relating to allocation of government bungalows to former chief ministers.

 The petition, filed by NGO Lok Prahari, pointed put that despite an Allahabad High Court directive, the Uttar Pradesh government has framed the Ex-Chief Ministers Residence Allotment Rules, 1997 (non-statutory), for allotting bungalows to successive former chief ministers.

 The NGO said the beneficiaries of the rule belonged to all parties. The names that figured during the hearing were N.D. Tiwari, Ram Naresh Yadav, Kalyan Singh, Rajnath Singh, Mayavati and V.P. Singh.

 According to the petition, the rule is unconstitutional and those occupying the bungalows were unauthorised occupants under the UP Public Premises (eviction of unauthorised occupants) Act. Moreover, the retention of government accommodation after demitting office was against the provisions of the UP Ministers (salaries/allowances and other facilities) Act.

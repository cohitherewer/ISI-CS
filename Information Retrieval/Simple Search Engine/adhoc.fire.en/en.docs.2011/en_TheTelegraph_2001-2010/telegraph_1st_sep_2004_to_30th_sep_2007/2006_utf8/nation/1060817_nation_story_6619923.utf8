 Lalu lecture for IIM pupils

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Lalu Prasad

Ahmedabad, Aug. 16: Lalu Prasad Yadav has been invited to IIM Ahmedabad to share tips with students who know him more for rustic repartees than for putting the railways back on the right financial track.

 Mavens at the B-school are not flinching because Lalu Prasad (in picture) presided over a 15-year growth debacle in Bihar. His mantras as the minister who changed the railways destination in a little over two years will feature in slide-show presentations on how feeble organisations can be nursed back to health.

 Professor G. Raghuram, who presented a case study on the changing face of the railways after Lalu Prasad took over, said: We have invited him and he has agreed to be present when this exercise is carried out here. 

 No date has been fixed but Lalu Prasad will visit the IIM when he can make time.

 The railways story under Lalu Prasad has generated curiosity among IIM students, and faculty members are keen to hear the mantra of his success --- especially his style of management.

 His feat involves steering the railways to a point where it had cash reserves of Rs 13,000 crore in 2005-06, a leap from Rs 240 crore in 2001-02. 

 Many at the IIM are, however, tempted to ask if Lalu Prasad will also throw some light on the fodder scam.

 Perhaps, something went wrong, which he seems to have realised and rectified as a railway minister, said Raghuram, called Rail Raghu for having tracked the railways for 30 years. It was also the subject of his PhD. 

 Students say they are interested only in the money-spinning plans Lalu Prasad pushed through in the railways. Rahul Roushan, who is from Bihar, said. We will listen to him to find out about his claim of turning the railways around.

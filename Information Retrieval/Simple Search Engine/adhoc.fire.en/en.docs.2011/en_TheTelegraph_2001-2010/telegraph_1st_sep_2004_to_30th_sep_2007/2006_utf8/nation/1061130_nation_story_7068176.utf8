 glare on defence officers 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 29: Six generals have been named in a list of 21 armed forces officers against whom corruption charges are either being investigated or have been framed.

 Service headquarters has also directed punishment against three of the generals but action has been withheld because of court proceedings.

 Two of the top officers are lieutenant generals and four are major generals. The list also includes nine brigadiers.

 The list was tabled in the Rajya Sabha today by defence minister A.K. Antony in answer to a question from Samajwadi Party leader Amar Singh.

 The senior-most officers named are Lieutenant General S.K. Sahni and Lieutenant General S.K. Dahiya. Sahni, who retired in October, has got a court order restraining the government from taking action against him.

 An army court of inquiry conducted by the Western Command chief found Sahni, Major General B.P.S. Mander, Brigadier S.K. Handa, Brigadier P.S. Gill and six junior officers guilty of lapses in procurement of dry rations.

 The Western Command chief has directed disciplinary action against the lieutenant general and two brigadiers and administrative action against Mander.

 The other lieutenant general facing corruption charges is Dahiya. A court of inquiry indicted the officer of irregularities in a frozen meat contract for soldiers in the Ladakh sector of the Northern Command when he was a major general.

 Dahiya, Brigadier D.V.S. Bishnoi and three other officers were found to be at fault. Dahiya has also appealed against action in Delhi High Court.

 Another court of inquiry indicted Major General Gur Iqbal Singh Multani, brigadiers D.S. Grewal, G. Ilangovan, Rajeev Devikar and R.S. Rana and seven other officers of selling army supply liquor in the open market.

 The Central Command chief has asked for disciplinary action against the general and administrative action against the other 10 officers.

 Army headquarters is also likely to punish Major General K.T.G. Nambiar, Major General Rana Goswami and two other officers. A court of inquiry found Nambiar guilty of financial irregularities when he was a brigadier.

 In the Eastern Command, Brigadier S.S. Rao was found to be guilty of staging a fake encounter by the commanding officer of his unit. The Eastern Command chief has asked for action against the brigadier.

 Brigadier Iqbal Singh was cashiered from service and sentenced to two years rigorous imprisonment after a court martial following his naming in the Tehelka expos. Singh was alleged to have accepted bribes and offered to swing a contract for reporters posing as arms dealers.

 In other cases, Commander C.S. Singh of the navy has been given six months rigorous imprisonment for abusing his position as a public servant.

 Commodore N.M.M. Pandit has been dismissed from the navy and sentenced to a year and a half in jail.

 Lt Commander M.P. Verma was charged with cruelty, conduct unbecoming of an officer and accused of acquiring wealth from unknown sources. He has also been dismissed from service and given a year in jail. Commander A.G. Gandhi, accused of un-officer like conduct, was dismissed and had to forfeit seniority.

 In the air force, Group Captain Shamsher Singh has been tried by a court martial on a corruption charge. He has had to forfeit seven years of service for promotion, five years of service for increased pay and given a severe reprimand.

 A Coast Guard officer, Deputy Inspector General S.K. Dey has got an interim stay order from Madras High Court after investigations were ordered into charges of financial irregularities.

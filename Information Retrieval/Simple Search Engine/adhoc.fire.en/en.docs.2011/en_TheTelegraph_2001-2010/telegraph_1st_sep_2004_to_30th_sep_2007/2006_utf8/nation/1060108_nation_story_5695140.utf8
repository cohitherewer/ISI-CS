 Orissa shrugs off bandh

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, Jan. 7: The dawn-to-dusk bandh called by Opposition parties in Orissa to protest Mondays police firing in Kalinga Nagar had little impact on the streets.

 Home secretary Santosh Kumar said no cases of violence were reported from any part of the state against the police action that left a dozen tribals dead.

 One constable also died in the clash after hundreds of tribals, driven by fears of displacement, had gathered to resist a move to erect the compound wall of an upcoming Tata Steel plant.

 A few protesters stormed the official residence of finance minister Prafulla Ghadei, who represents the Sukinda Assembly segment that includes Kalinga Nagar.

 Ghadei was not present when the protesters entered his house and smashed window-panes and flowerpots. A few others stoned the state office of the Biju Janata Dal. Bandh supporters also burnt effigies of chief minister Naveen Patnaik.

 Although train and bus services were affected, there was little sign of the bandh on the streets as commercial establishments did brisk business after noon.

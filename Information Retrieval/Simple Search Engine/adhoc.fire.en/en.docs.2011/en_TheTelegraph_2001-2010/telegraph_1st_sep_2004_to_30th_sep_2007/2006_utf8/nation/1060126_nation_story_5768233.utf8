 Back to roots signal in hot post for Modi

 Modi: On a new turf

 New Delhi, Jan. 25: One is hailed as the monarch of the Hindu heart, the other used his not-so-well-known rhyming powers for a call to erase Baburs name from history.

 Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi and Ram temple-era poster boy Vinay Katiyar are in BJP president Rajnath Singhs new team of office-bearers, in the clearest indication that the party would revert to its ideological roots, though with checks and balances.

 Modi is on the partys parliamentary board, its highest decision-making body, for the first time.

 Katiyar, who once said tel lagao Dabur kaa, naam mitao Babur ka (use oil made by Dabur, erase Baburs name from history), has been named a general secretary.

 Rajnath unveiled his team today after a meeting of BJP and RSS leaders in Jaipur. Although it was thought the exercise would carry the Sanghs stamp, Modis induction and the presence of Atal Bihari Vajpayee, L.K. Advani and Jaswant Singh in the board belied the view.

 Modi, who took on the VHP in his state, is not a Sangh favourite. But for political purposes, he is the BJPs Hindu hriday ka samrat.

 As for the presence of the liberal, middle-of-the-road triumvirate, sources said it would ensure that the political scale does not tilt entirely towards Hindutva.

 Far from being marginalised, the changes showed former chief Advani has retained his clout because his favourites kept their jobs. M. Venkaiah Naidu has been retained on the parliamentary board, despite the RSS and Rajnaths express wishes, while Ananth Kumar will continue as a general secretary.

 Rajnath also sent a pro-Vajpayee signal by making his favourite, Vijay Goel, a secretary.

 Another pointer to the Sanghs inability to have its way was Bal Aptes retention as a vice-president. The Sangh was reportedly keen he be made a general secretary, the most important post after the presidents in the organisational hierarchy. 

 The only major concession Rajnath seems to have made was keeping the post of the general secretary (organisation) vacant. Sanjay Joshi held the post until the sleaze CD caught up with him. But there is a belief that if the investigation exonerates Joshi, he would be reinstated.

 Katiyars induction, the sources said, is meant to send the right signal to the pro-Hindutva constituency in the run-up to the Uttar Pradesh elections in 2007.

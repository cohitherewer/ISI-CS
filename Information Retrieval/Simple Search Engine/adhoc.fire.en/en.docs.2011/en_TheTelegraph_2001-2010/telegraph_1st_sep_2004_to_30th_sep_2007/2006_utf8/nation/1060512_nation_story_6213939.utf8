 Rae Bareli, May 11: Gulal-smeared siblings Priyanka and Rahul hit the streets of Rae Bareli, clapping and waving, in an impromptu victory march after their mother Sonia Gandhi was declared winner by a huge margin. 

 A little after 1.30 pm, Priyanka received the certificate of victory from the district magistrate showing the Congress president had won by 4,17,888 votes, well above her 2.5-lakh margin in 2004. 

 I am just really, really happy. I thank the people of Rae Bareli. I have always had faith in them, she said, after her brother nudged her to speak. 

 Rahul, who had run the campaign, also thanked Rae Bareli. I did not focus on what the margin would be. My mother had given me a job and my only focus was to get the job done, he added as party workers shouted slogans like Sonia zindabad, Rahul-Priyanka zindabad. We depended on party workers and the people of Rae Bareli and we came through. It is victory for the people of Rae Bareli. 

 Half and hour later, the brother and sister were out in a black Honda CRV along with Priyankas husband Robert Vadra. People joined them along the way in cars, on bicycles and on foot. By the time the procession reached Rae Bareli Club from the ITI counting centre, a distance of 2 km, there were at least 5,000 marching.

 As people came out of their houses to line the streets under the scorching sun, the trio got out of the car and sat on its roof. Soon, petals rained down on them amid the sound of bursting crackers. Once in a while, Rahul stepped down to walk, and his sister and brother-in-law joined him.

 People in Rae Bareli have proved they are smarter than propaganda, said schoolteacher Samrat Srivastava, following the convoy.

 The people of Rae Bareli have voted for the ideology of Sonia Gandhi, said Sunetra Bhagat, a Congress worker, breaking into a dance.

 The Samajwadi Party, which had deployed an army of ministers and MPs for the campaign, including chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadavs son Akhilesh and brother Shivpal, finished a poor second with 57,003 votes, less than half of what it had won in 2004. 

 The BJPs Vinay Katiyar came in third with 19,657 votes, about half its last tally. 

 Priyanka, her mothers election agent, was at the counting station all through the morning till it was declared that Sonia, who was seeking re-election after stepping down on the office of profit row, had got 474,891 of the 590,026 votes polled. The low voter turnout of 43 per cent had raised fears of a reduced margin. 

 Priyanka stepped out at 1.34 pm with the certificate and was joined by Rahul. Turning towards him, she said her brother had worked very hard and done a great job, and fed him a laddoo.

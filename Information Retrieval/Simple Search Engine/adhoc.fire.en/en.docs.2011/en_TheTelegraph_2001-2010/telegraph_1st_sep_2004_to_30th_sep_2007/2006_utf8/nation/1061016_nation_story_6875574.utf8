 A bathroom for a cool crore

 Hyderabad, Oct. 15: Its 1,044 square feet, is fitted with a gym, provides a study in privacy and comfort, and is almost cheap at Rs 1 crore.

 A compact, two-bedroom luxury villa? No, silly, its just the bathroom.

 If you have difficulty imagining a Rs 1-crore loo, throw your mind back to the James Bond films you have watched, suggests architect Sharad Maithel helpfully.

 The super-bathroom beats the one at your home as decisively as 007s car beats your family four-wheeler.

 These bathrooms are designed for the occupants every need and every mood. There are custom- made private bathing corners for husband and wife, complete with mens and womens wardrobes, Maithel says. 

 Such a bathroom is an exotic combination of luxury, privacy and utility.

 Exotic is right. The super-bathroom is a feature of the most opulent among 44 Spanish-style villas coming up at suburban Medchal, a half-hour drive from the airport.

 Spanish architect Alfonso Peralta from Malaga helped the Jaipur-based Maithel design the Rs 220-crore project, Casa Estebana, that could teach the Nizams of old a thing or two about the art of fine living.

 One feature, though, seems to have sprung right out of the nawabs luxury manual. Its the mood room.

 The old palaces had special chambers where an angry and sulking queen would shut herself up, waiting for a contrite prince to cajole her back to a happy mood.

 Some of the new villas will have similar rooms, decked out with plants and flowers, where an agitated occupant can soothe her nerves. 

 Presumably, there will be no expensive vases to hurl in anger though the houses high price tags suggest the owners can well afford that, too.

 The villas come in five sizes, the smallest being 7,650 square feet, and cost between Rs 4.5 crore and Rs 14 crore. Eight of them will be ready within a year, said the builder, M.P. Agrawal of Omega Shelters.

 He explained that the Casa Estebana was a response to newly rich IT czars clamour for more posh living. 

 Omega, a part of the Ambience Properties Group, had started out by constructing Rs 3-crore mansions, but they were not classy enough for some.

 If a man with a Rs 10-lakh car has a flat worth Rs 70 lakh, then naturally a person with a Rs 80-lakh car will want to live in a house that costs at least Rs 15 crore, Agrawal reasoned.

 The villas, built on half-an-acre to 1.25-acre plots, will each have a green forest barrier and individual entry and exit routes on a four-lane driveway. 

 The landscape has been designed by Rajesh Shukla of Amby Valley fame.

 All that Maithel or Agrawal will reveal about the buyers identity is that they are all NRI investors high-fliers who do not get privacy anywhere and come home to relax and live like royalty.

 These creations will put the palaces and villas of the erstwhile nawabs to shame, said Rajeev Reddy, a leading builder.

 Most of the old havelis have been converted into government offices, hospitals, libraries or auditoriums. 

 One is set to house the US consulate.

 But thanks to the IT boom, Hyderabad will stay a city of palaces.

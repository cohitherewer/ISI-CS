 Biggest polluters pitch in for clean climate

 - India part of fund to push green technologies in mining and power industries

 Sydney, Jan. 11 (Reuters): Six of the worlds biggest polluters, led by the US, will create a multi-million-dollar fund to encourage mining and power industries to develop and use cleaner energy technologies to combat climate change.

 The Asia Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate between the US, Australia, Japan, China, South Korea and India will also form eight working groups with business and industry to develop clean-energy projects for the fund.

 Combined, the six countries account for half the worlds greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels such as coal and oil and their Sydney meeting is the first for their clean-energy partnership.

 Australian foreign minister Alexander Downer today said Australia and the US would announce a financial contribution to get the fund started. India, South Korea, Japan, and China would also contribute. 

 The private sector as well as governments are going to sit down together and try to work out solutions to some of these problems, said Downer. As they work out some of these solutions then they will come back to governments with those recommendations and we will have to have a look and see what needs to be funded.

 Green groups said the two-day talks in Sydney were a facade and were aimed at subverting the Kyoto Protocol, which the US and Australia refuse to sign claiming its mandatory greenhouse gas cuts would threaten economic growth.

 They said without binding targets, which the Sydney climate pact will not propose, it was doomed to fail.

 Protesters in front of the conference venue today buried a large replica of Australian Prime Minister John Howards head in coal to symbolise what they said was his commitment to industry profits over climate-change solutions.

 Talk is cheap and the price of inaction is expensive, Greenpeace spokeswoman Catherine Fitzpatrick said. The dirty, black fingerprints of the coal industry are all over it. 

 About 80 executives from global mining and energy firms, including BHP Billiton, Exxon Mobil and Rio Tinto, attended the talks. 

 We will expect to challenge the private sector to do more... as this matter of greenhouse gas control is one that we all share, US energy secretary Sam Bodman told a joint news conference with Australian industry minister Ian Macfarlane.

 The pacts eight clean-energy working groups will be based on the industry sectors of mining, renewable energy, aluminium, cement, distributed energy, power generation, building and appliance efficiency and transportation.

 Industry leaders leaving the first days talks backed the creation of a technology fund and task forces.

 Weve made a tremendous amount of progress under a voluntary framework here today and theres absolutely no question that businesses are prepared to back this with funding, said Michael Morris, chief executive of American Electric Power.

 But the six nations did not reveal how much funding would be made available for new energy technology development. Australia is expected to contribute $75 million.

 The US already spends more than any other country on developing new energy technologies, with $3 billion invested annually in areas like hydrogen fuel, carbon sequestration and renewable fuels. It has committed to cut air pollution from its power plants by nearly 70 per cent, but has said it will cost $50 billion to install new technologies to achieve it.

 Governments and taxpayers simply wont be able to afford the sorts of measures that need to be put in place over the next three to five decades, Australias Macfarlane said.

 Scientists say global warming is melting glaciers, raising sea levels and will cause more intense storms, droughts and floods.

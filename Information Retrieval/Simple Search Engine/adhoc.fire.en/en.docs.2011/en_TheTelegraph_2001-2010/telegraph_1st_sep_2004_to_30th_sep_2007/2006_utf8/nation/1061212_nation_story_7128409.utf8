 CPM wants brake on nuke deal

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 11: The CPM today asked the Centre not to proceed with negotiations on the Indo-US nuclear deal as there were provisions in the framework that it found objectionable.

 We do not want the negotiations to proceed. The present framework of the proposed bilateral agreement is not acceptable to us, general secretary Prakash Karat said, urging Manmohan Singh to re- negotiate the deal.

 The CPM fears the Bush regime may have arm-twisted the UPA government into agreeing to terms that are detrimental to Indias sovereignty. It wants fresh bilateral talks that will ensure there is no deviation from the July Indo-US nuclear pact.

 The politburo, which has studied the bill over two days, also reminded Singh of the assurances he made to Parliament that he would not brook any deviation from the script of the July agreement.

 This (bilateral agreement) cannot be accepted by India as it negates the most significant, if not all, assurances made by the Prime Minister to Indian Parliament, a statement said.

 Dropping hints that it was headed for a fresh confrontation with the government, the CPM demanded that Singh go back to Parliament for a fresh mandate on the deal.

 We want a full-fledged debate on the deal. Nothing short of the assurances made by the Prime Minister on August 17 can be acceptable, Karat said at the news conference.

 But he dodged a reply to whether his party wanted the government to reject the deal. All we are saying is that the present framework of the bill is not acceptable. There must be a debate in Parliament.

 But Karat was clear that the final legislation runs contrary to most of the assurances given by the Prime Minister.

 Among the provisions that the CPM finds objectionable are some restrictions and the trade regime that bars access to dual use of nuclear technology which would deny India its full nuclear fuel cycle.

 There are no references to Indias role being one of support and complicity with the US designs on Iran. The act talks of Indias foreign policy being congruent to that of United States, the politburo statement said. 

 It also pointed out that the bill retained the annual certification by the US President.

 Like its economic polices, the 

 UPAs foreign policy has been a contentious issue between 

 the Left and the Centre.

 New Delhi, Dec. 11: The 

 Congress Working Committee will meet at Sonia Gandhis 

 residence tomorrow.

 Prime Minister Manmohan 

 Singh will attend the meeting.

 Following objections by the Left, party members have sought 

 clarification on the Indo-US nuclear deal and its implications 

 on the pursuit of a sovereign policy by India.

 External affairs minister 

 Pranab Mukherjee is expected to brief the CWC members.

 Chinkara call after Fanaa fury

 - Gujarat 

 summons Aamir to explain Lagaan sequence 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Aamir Khan

 Ahmedabad, Oct. 29: His 

 film Fanaa already under an unofficial ban in Gujarat, 

 its Aamir Khans turn now to face official heat 

 from the Narendra Modi government.

 The actor may have to visit Kutch next week to try and explain to forest officials why he shouldnt be prosecuted for illegally filming a chinkara during the shooting of Lagaan.

 Seven years after the alleged offence and six months after he annoyed the Modi government on the Narmada dam issue the actor has been summoned to district headquarters Bhuj on November 6 to face charges of violating wildlife laws. Forest minister Magu Patel has confirmed the summons.

 In a scene in the Oscar-nominated Lagaan, a British official tries to shoot a chinkara but Aamir, who plays a villager, helps the antelope escape into the forest.

 The film was shot in 1999, but a complaint was lodged with the forest department only in June this year. Aamirs support to dam oustees had by then turned him into a pariah for the states BJP establishment, and mobs were preventing theatres from screening Fanaa.

 The complaint came from a wildlife activist, Amit Jethwa, who alleged that Aamir had filmed the chinkara, an endangered species, without the forest departments permission.

 The chief conservator of forests (Kutch), R.L. Meena, said a probe had revealed the animal was injured during the shoot and died a few weeks later apparently of injuries.

 Officials said a forest guard named Amritlal Modi and a resident of Kunaria village, where the scene was shot, had confirmed that a chinkara had been taken to sets of Lagaan. If proved guilty, Aamir could be jailed for up to six years, they added.

 Jethwa said he would be in Bhuj on November 6. If the forest officials do not lodge an FIR against Aamir, I will.

 Jethwa had earlier complained against actor Salman Khan for allegedly killing chinkaras in Kutch during the filming of Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam. It hasnt been followed up.

 Pension talks on Sonia plate

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi, Nov. 8: The Centre is likely to sound the Left parties on its intention to unroll the next phase of pension reforms at the next meeting of the UPA-Left coordination committee.

 The committee will meet soon after Congress president Sonia Gandhi returns from her trip to Belgium.

 Government sources admitted that given the Lefts opposition particularly that of the CPI and the affiliated trade unions to the bill, an effective compromise would have to be worked out. The only trade-off they spoke of was giving in to the Lefts demand to restore the interest rate on the Employees Provident Fund to 9.5 per cent.

 The sources claimed that at the last meeting the Prime Minister had with Left leaders in October, they seemed willing to negotiate some of the amendments they had proposed to the bill. 

 The governments understanding was that while the CPM was open to revisiting its position because of the stand taken by Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, it was unsure of the other constituents and whether the Bengal chief minister could prevail on Citu, the CPMs labour arm. The Prime Minister may speak with Bhattacharjee before the meeting.

 Senior CPI leader D. Raja rejected the idea of a compromise. Neither the political parties nor the trade unions would agree to such a proposal. The EPF interest rate is different from pension. The amendments (to the pension bill) strike at the core of the proposed legislation, he said.

 The Left parties primary objection to the bill was it would change the nature of pension as a social security benefit by making available pension funds for investment in the equity market. The bill must have provisions to disallow investments in stock markets and entrust the fund management with public sector enterprises and not private agencies. 

 In its existing form, the new pension system outlined in the bill seeks to provide old-age income security for all individuals, including those in the unorganised sector. The system will be implemented through a combination of retailers, pension fund and record-keepers.

 The standing committee on finance, which presented its report on the bill to the Lok Sabha in July 2005, proposed that at least one scheme should be fully invested in government securities. The subscriber could divide his contributions between these schemes and have the option of changing his contributions any time.

 BSc for village doctors 

 G.S. MUDUR

 New Delhi, Dec. 1: A government task force has proposed a three-year BSc degree course in health sciences to create a new cadre of medical workers to combat the severe shortage of doctors across rural India.

 The course is expected to teach human anatomy and physiology, clinical diagnosis and treatment and will include a six-month internship in community health practice.

 Were worried that we just wont be able to get MBBS doctors to work in villages, said K. Shyamprasad, a member of the task force aimed at improving medical education. A mandatory rural stint is not a long-term solution. Given their aversion to work in rural areas, doctors pushed there may not have real commitment to people, he said.

 Earlier government proposals to make a short rural practice mandatory for MBBS doctors before they get their permanent licence to practice medicine have not been implemented because of widespread opposition.

 The BSc health sciences course will qualify students to become community health practitioners in rural areas devoid of MBBS doctors, the task force has said.

 However, the proposal has angered medical associations.

 This is wrong, said Narender Saini, assistant secretary with the Indian Medical Association. Its like quackery. How can we have half-trained medical practitioners? Would you accept half-trained pilots?

 Sources in the task force told The Telegraph that both the Indian Medical Association and the Medical Council of India have opposed the BSc health sciences proposal.

 Under existing laws, health workers cannot prescribe medicines. Theyll have to work under the supervision of doctors, K.K. Agarwal, chairman of the academic wing of the Indian Medical Association, said.

 Saini said doctors do not have any aversion to rural areas, but find themselves handicapped there in the absence of adequate facilities. Doctors will go if there are facilities, he said. Today, a doctor in a rural clinic sits on a chair with no drugs, no diagnostic facilities and no infrastructure for even minor surgery.

 A member of the task force said the reaction of the medical association was not surprising. They are worried about the few rural patients who will not have to visit city doctors any more. 

 Community health professionals have welcomed the proposal, but added that infrastructure for education and training needs to be established. 

 Shyamprasad said Assam, Meghalaya and Uttaranchal have shown interest in the proposal.

 Bedside learning is crucial in medicine, said Thelma Narayan with the Community Health Cell in Bangalore. Such a course will require trained teaching staff and facilities for field practice and bedside learning.

 Shyamprasad said Assam, Meghalaya and Uttaranchal have shown interest in the proposal. Were hoping state medical councils will provide licenses to these practitioners, he said.

 Several countries, including the US, have allowed cadres of health workers to address health care needs in areas where the density of doctors is low, a task force member said. If the US can allow nurse-practitioners to diagnose and treat patients, why cant we introduce a similar system here?

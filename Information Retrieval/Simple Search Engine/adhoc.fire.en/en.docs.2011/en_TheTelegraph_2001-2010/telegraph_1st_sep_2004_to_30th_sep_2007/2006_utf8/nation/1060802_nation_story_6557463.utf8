 Tansi clean chit but lock on cash

 M.R. VENKATESH

 Jayalalithaa

 Chennai, Aug. 1: The Tansi land case in which Jayalalithaa and her friend Sassikala were acquitted is far from over after the Tamil Nadu government decided the two will not yet get back the money they paid for the properties which they later returned.

 The former chief minister and Sassikala, partners in Jaya Publications and Sasi Enterprises which purchased the properties from the Tamil Nadu Small Industries Corporation (Tansi) in 1992 when the ADMK was in power had been acquitted in the case by the Supreme Court in 2003.

 But the Tamil Nadu government has decided to keep Rs 1.87 crore described as the original sales consideration in the two properties in its kitty until a special courts verdict in the Rs 66-crore disproportionate assets case against the ADMK chief, her friend and others. 

 The Supreme Court, while acquitting Jayalalithaa and Sassikala in the Tansi case, had asked Jayalalithaa to return the properties to the corporation. 

 Her counsel K.K. Venugopal then told the court she had already returned the properties.

 The corporations annual report for the financial year ending March 31, 2005 recently tabled in the Assembly has acknowledged that its latest fixed assets include the value of the lands and buildings re-conveyed to Tansi by Jaya Publications and Sasi Enterprises.

 But the report said the corporation is yet to receive their title deeds from the registration department because the district revenue officer, Chennai, has made a claim of Rs 2.80 crore on the corporation as differential stamp duty and registration charges.

 The revenue office cited soaring land prices in 2002-end when the properties were returned as the reason for demanding the additional charges. The properties were sold in 1992.

 The corporation has disputed this claim and the case is pending before the district revenue officer (stamps), Chennai.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Oct. 26: Mohammed Majid Ansari, the Calcuttan arrested in connection with the 7/11 Mumbai blasts, had helped six Pakistani bombers carrying RDX enter from Bangladesh through the North 24-Parganas border near Basirhat, a Mumbai court was told today.

 Police added that Asif Khan alias Junaid, arrested from Belgaum, co-ordinated the logistics of the operation.

 The police also officially named the nine surviving (and absconding) Pakistani nationals out of the 11 they say were involved in the operation. Two days ago, the Prime Minister had clarified that India had credible evidence of Pakistani involvement in the blasts.

 The polices remand plea names the nine as Lashkar-e-Toiba commander Azam Cheema, Aslam, Sabir, Abu Baqar, Kasam Ali, Ammu Jaan, Abdul Razak, Sohail Shaikh and Ehsanullah.

 Among the other wanted are Pune-born and UAE-based hawala operator Rizwan Daware, Raheel Sheikh, Nepal-based operative Hafiz Zubair and Abdul Rehman.

 The police said four accused including Majid had confessed their roles, after seven others had retracted their confessions in court.

 The judge remanded five accused Majid, Shaikh Mohammed Ali Alam Shaikh, Mohammed Sajid Ansari, Abdul Wahid Shaikh and Naved Hussain Khan in judicial custody till November 9. Junaid was remanded in police custody till November 1 and will be sent to Bangalore tomorrow for narco-analysis.

 The police said Sajid, who owned a mobile repair shop, attended meetings at mastermind Faisal Sheikhs Perry Cross Road home in Bandra, where the roles of all the accused were finalised. He had helped assemble the bombs and made the quartz timers.

 Naved, held from Hyderabad, allegedly drove the Pakistanis in Faisals car to Mohammed Alis Govandi house where the pressure-cooker bombs were prepared. He drove the car back to Faisals home with the bombs before they were taken to Churchgate to be planted in trains.

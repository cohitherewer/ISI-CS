 Final act in family drama

 Gowda, Kumaraswamy: 

 Deal in sight 

 New Delhi, Feb. 12: The stage is set for the final scene of the Janata Dal (Secular) drama that began with the majority of party MLAs in Karnataka deciding to align with the BJP to form a coalition government led by H.D. Kumaraswamy.

 Sources said Kumaraswamy and his father, Dal (S) president H.D. Deve Gowda, have arrived at an arrangement that would seal the estrangement and also allow the two sides to exist independently, at least for the time being.

 According to the arrangement, the final scene is likely to be enacted during or just before the Dal (S) national executive meeting scheduled in Delhi on February 20.

 Sources said the final act would begin with the expulsion of the 41 MLAs who walked away with Kumaraswamy to form the government in Karnataka. This would culminate ? after a small gap? in the announcement of a regional party by the chief minister.

 The script has, therefore, ensured that the February 20 meeting ends in a whimper rather than with a bang.

 Dal (S) spokesperson Danish Ali said: We have not sent an invitation to Kumaraswamy and state party president N. Tipanna. Of the 41 rebels, only these two are the members of the national executive.

 On or before the February 20 national executive meeting, we will take disciplinary action against all those who have indulged in anti-party activities, he added.

 Sources said following the expulsion, the rebels would not claim themselves as the main party, which they can do legally as they comprise a large section of the Dal (S) in Karnataka. Instead, Kumaraswamy would announce the formation of his regional party, the sources added.

 Thus, both father and son would win ? or so they can claim ? and the victories would mark the end of almost a month-long drama in the Dal (S).

 Sources said the arrangement would suit both Gowda and Kumaraswamy, neither of whom wanted a confrontation on the issue. Also, the arrangement would allow a smooth parting of ways and protect the secular credentials of the Dal (S), sources said.

 The remaining nine Dal (S) MLAs with Deve Gowda would, in that case, sit in the Opposition in the Karnataka Assembly, they added.

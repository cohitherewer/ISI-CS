 Prabhunath back

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 25: Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee announced today that he had rejected the resignation of Janata Dal (United) member Prabhunath Singh.

 The Dal (U) leader was called back to the House and he later attended proceedings.

 Singh had handed his resignation to Chatterjee when the House met in the afternoon yesterday, a couple of hours after the fracas in which Rashtriya Janata Dal member Sadhu Yadav lunged at him with a clenched fist.

 RJD leader Lalu Prasad had apologised in the House over the behaviour of his party MPs in reaction to a remark by Singh.

 Singh, however, maintained he had said nothing objectionable and gave a resignation note. The Speaker had then told the House that he would bring the MP back.

 Earlier in the day, Chatterjee referred again to yesterdays incident which took place when he had adjourned the House and left the chamber. He said it had affected the image of Parliament.

 Hackles up over false hijack alarm

 SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI

 Mumbai, Feb. 1: An Indian Airlines technician who set off a hijack alarm during a routine pre-flight check at Mumbai airport last Friday has raised the hackles of several airline operators.

 The Airline Operators Committee (AOC) is demanding that IA (now renamed Indian) pay it damages for huge monetary losses run up by flights held up for nearly three hours.

 IA technician Kailash Pavitrikar had triggered the alarm ? a switch in the cockpit that is usually wire-locked and not to be touched by inspecting engineers ? at the domestic wing of Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport.

 All the operators lost money because of the alarm that delayed flights by up to three hours, said an official of AOC, a body of airlines, aviation and security agencies.

 The AOC is likely to call for stern action against IA at its February 18 meeting in which the total losses incurred by the operators will be calculated.

 We are in no position to penalise Indian Airlines ourselves. We can only make a recommendation to the Airports Authority of India (AAI) and the Directorate General of Civil Aviation, a committee member from a private airline said.

 But the general feeling is that operators should get monetary compensation from IA.

 A section among the operators is, however, undecided on the course of action to be taken. We are all airline operators and tomorrow any of us could be in a similar situation, said Gerry DLima, AOC chairman and station manager of Delta Airlines.

 There are various thoughts on the issue, but we will go by majority opinion when we meet to discuss this later this month.

 The Indian Aircraft Technicians Association refused comment on the incident. I dont have anything to say. Make what you want out of it, general secretary Chitrav said.

 IA said an inquiry was being conducted. We will be able to comment only after the report is submitted, spokesman K. Swaminathan said.

 Both IA and Air-India had installed hijack alarms in their planes after the IC-814 hijack in December 1999.

 An AAI official said about 30 aircraft had been in line for take-off when the alarm was set off. The departure terminal was crammed and airlines staff had difficulty explaining the cause of the delay as it could have caused widespread panic, he said.

 A senior AOC official said some kind of punishment was called for as airlines and passengers had been affected by someones mistake.

 The Airports Authority of India should be initiating action against IA in this case. But as far as I know, no action has been initiated, he said.

 This is not the first time IA has sent Mumbai airport into a tizzy over nothing. A similar false hijack alarm had been raised last November. The AOC had then let off IA with a reprimand.

 An official from Jet Airways, worst hit by Fridays alarm with 15 delayed departures, said the AOC had decided in November security officials and air traffic control would have to be notified as soon as possible in such cases.

 It was also decided that an emergency committee comprising airline staff, security agencies and the air traffic controller would be formed to tackle such emergencies. Unfortunately, no system was put in place, he said.

 Mumbai airport outgoing director Sudhir Kumar said: We have already warned Indian Airlines. The issue will be discussed at the AOC meeting and appropriate action taken.

 No action has yet been taken against Air Sahara after its flight from Calcutta overshot the landing threshold in Mumbai last October and got stuck in soft ground, hitting airport operations for 72 hours.

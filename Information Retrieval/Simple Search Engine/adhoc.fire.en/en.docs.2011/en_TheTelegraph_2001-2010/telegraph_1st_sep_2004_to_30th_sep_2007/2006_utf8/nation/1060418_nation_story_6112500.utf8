 Bharti adds zing to Chauhan bypoll 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Budhini (Madhya Pradesh), April 17: These days Shivraj Singh Chauhan might find it easier to hold a cabinet meeting at Budhini rather than in Bhopal with more than 20 of his 32 ministers camping here.

 But what the BJP chief minister immediately needs from his colleagues isnt advice for executive decisions but help to ensure he retains the power to take them.

 A bypoll to put the stamp of legitimacy on Chauhans chair, which had seemed a cakewalk a couple of weeks ago, has suddenly turned tricky thanks to Uma Bharti propping up a candidate expected to eat heavily into BJP votes.

 Chauhans ministers are criss-crossing Budhini, 70 km from Bhopal, with a sense of urgency, asking voters to punch in their support for the chief minister on April 24.

 Barely a fortnight ago, the chief minister had told his party colleagues not to bother about the campaign. He had also asked Sushma Swaraj and Varun Gandhi not to come as the bypoll was too small a matter for the partys central leaders. Sushma will now be visiting the constituency in the last leg of electioneering.

 Uma has staked her reputation on the contest and is spending considerable time in Budhini, garnering support for the regional Gondwana Gantantra Partys nominee, Gulzar Singh Markam.

 Despite Umas problems mobilising both Hindutva hardliners and the tribals, Markam seems likely to cut a large slice off the BJPs traditional vote bank.

 The Congress has fielded local leader and two-time MLA Rajkumar Patel, who has a team of committed party workers. His campaign is being supervised by state Congress chief Subhash Yadav, the AICC general secretary in charge of the state, Narayanswami, as well as Union ministers of state Suresh Pachauri and Kantilal Bhuria. 

 The Chauhan camp fears that a three-way split in votes would make it a close race. The chief minister and his colleagues are therefore promising the moon, saying Budhini would get everything it needs, from factories to schools to 24-hour power supply. 

 Uma said Madhya Pradesh has a history of defeating chief ministers. In 1962, the incumbent, Kailash Nath Katju, lost from the Javra Assembly segment near Bhopal though his party, the Congress, won the state polls.

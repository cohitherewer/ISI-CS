 Apollo stands by negative tests

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 7: Apollo Hospital, where Rahul Mahajan was treated for alleged drug overdose, today reiterated its stand that the values of illicit drugs in his first urine sample were negative.

 In a statement, the hospital said subsequent urine samples have shown higher values because Rahul had by then received standard medication that began to show up in the tests.

 Apollo doctors had on Saturday said the test results had revealed levels that were within the permissible limits.

 This claim surprised pharmacology and medical experts who say residues of opiate or cocaine should not be present in the urine of people who have not ingested these drugs.

 I can understand permissible limits for residues of certain drugs or insecticides or other toxic substances found in the environment. But I dont understand the concept of a normal range for illicit drugs, said an internal medicine specialist.

 The first urine sample from Rahul taken at 6 am had revealed an opiate level of 8.5 and a cocaine level of 3.9. Both values are far below the reference level of 300, shared by both substances.

 An Apollo Hospital spokesperson today declined to respond to questions on the conflicting medical interpretation about the significance of the values detected in the first urine sample.

 An official in the private laboratory where these tests were conducted had told The Telegraph that the reference range represents clinically significant or toxic levels.

 On Saturday, Apollo doctors had asserted that the test results do not point to illicit drugs as the cause of Rahuls acute illness. But they had also added that it was for the investigating agencies to determine whether he had consumed drugs.

 In its statement, the hospital said it voluntarily sent samples to another laboratory. This demonstrated that we had no malafide intentions.

 No action: Police

 Delhi police today said they would not take action against Apollo Hospital to avoid diluting the high-profile case.

 The police had been interrogating the doctors for the last two days after contradictory reports emerged from the hospital about the presence of drugs in Rahuls urine sample.

 A day after Apollo doctors gave a clean chit to Rahul stating that he had tested negative for all 14 identifiable drugs, they did an about-turn and talked about the presence of a cocktail of drugs.

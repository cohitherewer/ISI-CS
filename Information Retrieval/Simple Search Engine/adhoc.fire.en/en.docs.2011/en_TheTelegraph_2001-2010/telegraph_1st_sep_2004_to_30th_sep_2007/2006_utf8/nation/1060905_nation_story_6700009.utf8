 Molest probe grounds minister

 JOHN MARY

 Thiruvananthapuram, Sept. 4: Kerala public works minister P.J. Josephs (in picture below) alleged mid-air molestation of a co-passenger grounded him today after a police officer refused to give him a clean chit.

 The 65-year-old father of four resigned from the Left-led government but not before he had slammed the inquiry as incomplete and imperfect.

 Inspector-general G.B. Sandhya, who probed the allegation that Joseph grabbed at former Surya TV newsreader Lekshmi Gopakumar on the Kingfisher Chennai-Kochi flight on August 3, said in her report she found no reason to disbelieve the charge.

 Sandhya said she found compelling corroboration of the allegation in statements given by other passengers on the flight.

 Chief minister V.S. Achuthanandan told reporters he was inclined to order another (judicial) inquiry as Joseph has demanded to give him an opportunity to prove he is innocent.

 Achuthanandan said the Kerala Congress (J), which Joseph heads, could suggest another name to fill the vacancy created by the resignation.

 Late in the evening, a PTI report said T.U. Kuruvila, the MLA from Kothamangalam, will replace Joseph, who was his partys sole representative in the LDF ministry.

 Josephs 110-day tenure is, perhaps, his shortest since he became a minister in the A.K. Antony-led Congress government in 1978. He later switched camps to join the Left front.

 The resignation came after a day of high drama. In the morning, Joseph drove to Cliff House, the official residence of the chief minister, and pleaded innocence. But Achuthanandan, according to sources, suggested stepping down was the best political option.

 Joseph emerged from the meeting and said the police officer had failed to verify the allegation and give a conclusive report to the government.

 Im not satisfied with the report, he said as he left for a closed-door meeting with his party legislators and other leaders.

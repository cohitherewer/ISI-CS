 Data theft in West common

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 3 : British 

 media may have turned all the data theft glare on Indian 

 call centres but stealing vital information to make a fast 

 buck is common in the West.

 Channel 4s The Data Theft Scandal, in which Indian middlemen will be shown selling credit card and passport details, has raised dust even before its scheduled telecast this Friday.

 But there is little noise about 20 cyber frauds in the US in less than three months. Between July 5 and September 25, the US department of justice has listed 20 cases of people being indicted for cyber crime and violation of intellectual property rights.

 The most glaring is the case of Anne Lockwood, a senior vice-president of leading US auto components company Metaldyne, and her husband who was a senior engineer in the same firm.

 The engineer copied on to compact discs hundreds of confidential files on Metaldynes secret process for manufacturing auto parts from powdered metal. His wife then passed on the CDs to the companys Chinese competitors.

 Michigan-based Metaldyne is one of two auto parts manufacturers in the world to have developed a process to fabricate powdered metal into automotive components such as connecting rods. 

 Another case is of three Coca-Cola executives who stole secret information on new products and tried to sell it to rival PepsiCo. Pepsi refused to play ball and alerted Coke. The FBI then trapped Edmund Duhaney, Ibrahim Dimson and Joya Williams.

 The UK is not much different. A study by KPMG, called the Forensics Fraud Barometer, has said that in the UK the surge in fraud recorded in the second half of 2005 has continued unabated into 2006, with more fraud (653 million) in six months than in the whole of most recent years.

 There has been a rise in insider fraud cases in British banks, the most notable being of a manager in Scotland who created 21 million in false loans over five years.

 Indian IT and BPO officials questioned the modus operandi of foreign TV channels, which are guided by public disaffection in their countries at job losses to India.

 We are concerned about the verifiability of such stories. These operations sometimes go beyond uncovering wrongdoing and actually induce criminal activity, Nasscom president Kiran Karnik said.

 Cross voting in UP House

 OUR BUREAU AND PTI

 Former BPL Telecom chief Rajeev Chandrasekhar sailed through to bag a Rajya Sabha seat from Karnataka, defeating Jnanpith winner U.R. Ananthamurthy. Chandrasekhar, who got 53 votes, had the backing of the BJP and the Janata Dal (Secular)

 New Delhi/Lucknow March 28: The Rajya Sabha biennial elections held today in Uttar Pradesh anticipated the trends in the Assembly polls scheduled for next year. 

 Virtually every camp, including the ruling Samajwadi Party, BJP and the Congress, had members who blithely cross-voted, mostly for the Bahujan Samaj Party nominees. 

 The BSP alone held its own against the combination of money, muscle power and administrative blandishments allegedly doled out by the Samajwadis.

 However, all six nominees of the Samajwadi Party-Rashtriya Lok Dal alliance won as did the two candidates from the BJP and the BSP. 

 The Samajwadi Partys Janeshwar Mishra, Virendra Bhatia, Mahendra Mohan, Banwari Lal Kanchal, Virpal Yadav and the RLDs Mehmood Madni came out winners.

 Vinay Katiyar and Kalraj Mishra were elected from the BJP while Balihari and Munkad Ali were the BSP candidates who won.

 Political sources in Lucknow said seven of the BJP MLAs voted for the BSP nominees, one for the Samajwadi Party and one of the 16 Congress MLAs voted for the Samajwadis. 

 That was not all. More than half of the 40 breakaway BSP MLAs ? who were recognised as a separate entity by the Uttar Pradesh Assembly Speaker after Allahabad High Court had pronounced a split verdict on their legislative status ? plumped for the BSP nominees.

 The BJP MLAs who cross-voted have started feeling the heat. The party has suspended the seven legislators and expelled Sandeep Agarwal, its MLA from Moradabad.

 The seven are Gangabux Singh, Fagu Chauhan, Amarjeet Singh Jansevak, Ram Prasad Chaudhary, Chotey Lal Verma, Badshah Singh and Puran Singh Bundela. 

 The sources said those who opted for the BSP had been assured of tickets for the Assembly polls by party chief Mayavati. 

 Despite an identical offer from Mulayam, they went for the BSP.

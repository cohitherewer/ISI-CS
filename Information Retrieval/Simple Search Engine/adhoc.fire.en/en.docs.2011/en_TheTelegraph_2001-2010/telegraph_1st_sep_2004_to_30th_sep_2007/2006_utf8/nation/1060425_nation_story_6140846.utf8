 Dia backs Aamir in dam fight, faces Gujarat fury

 BASANT RAWAT 

 Dia: In a fix

 Ahmedabad, April 24: Bollywood actress Dia Mirza had to virtually flee Rajkot yesterday after her expression of support for Aamir Khans stand on the Narmada controversy sparked fury in the state.

 Her statement at a news conference, held just before the Filmstar Night where she was to perform, immediately put her in the league of NBA leader Medha Patkar and Aamir, hate figures in Gujarat.

 She faced hostility even from the journalists at the interaction, where she had said to a question: I fully support Aamir Khans views on the issue of rehabilitation. All the displaced people should be rehabilitated before raising the height of the dam.

 She angered them more by praising Patkar as a dedicated activist who had made huge sacrifices for the cause of the Narmada displaced.

 She was asked if she knew how many people in Gujarat were suffering because of water shortage.

 Sensing she had touched a raw nerve, the actress clarified she wasnt against the dam ? she only wanted the oustees properly rehabilitated. She later issued a written statement making the same point.

 But this failed to pacify the BJP, which had already announced a protest.

 Fearing trouble, her performance was advanced and as soon as it was over, she was driven to Ahmedabad with police escort, though she was supposed to stay the night.

 The function was organised by Rajkot police, whose chief denied there was any trouble. Asked why Mirza had to be escorted to Ahmedabad then, K. Nityanandam said: This is normal. Whenever stars end their performance, they leave immediately, else they can be mobbed.

Coke ad

 Coca-Cola has announced that its Thande Ka Tadka ad campaign, featuring Aamir, would be aired on TV from Wednesday.

 The actor had said last week he might stop endorsing Coke if he found the company in the wrong in Keralas Plachimada, where its bottling plant has been accused of causing water shortage and water pollution.

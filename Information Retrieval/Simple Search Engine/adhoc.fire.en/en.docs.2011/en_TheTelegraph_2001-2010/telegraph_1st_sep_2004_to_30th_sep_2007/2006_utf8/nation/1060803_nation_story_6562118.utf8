 Alms haul: Rs 180 crore

 - Beg amp; take home up to Rs 80 a day

 Money matters

 Mumbai, Aug. 2: We have families to support and begging helps us do that, says Nabi, one of around 3 lakh beggars in Mumbai, dismissive of the hue and cry over their earnings. 

 The minister of state for women and child welfare, Dharamraobaba Atram, announced recently that beggars here make Rs 180 crore a year. 

 According to official figures, the daily earnings range between Rs 20 and Rs 60-80 depending on the area they operate in, which is more than what many Indians earn. 

 The World Bank says that over a third of the countrys population of 1.2 billion lives on less than $1 (Rs 46) a day. 

 I earn about Rs 70 and take it home to my parents and two siblings. My elder brother works in a garage and when I grow up, I am going to do the same, says 7-year-old Lakhan, who idolises Shah Rukh Khan and has posters of him in his shanty at Borivli.

 Like Lakhan, there are about 50,000 children between five and 13 begging on the citys streets they can be seen hanging around at stations and at traffic signals. Often, the older child carries a sibling around.

 The women and child welfare minister, Harshvardhan Patil, claims that about 47 per cent of the beggars are physically fit and 90 per cent are from outside the city. 

 Everybody wants to come to Mumbai and earn money. Be it through trafficking or through dance bars or by begging. This has to be stopped. It will take some time, but at least the government is taking notice of these people. 

 Many NGOs have supplied us with the information, our officials have done sample surveys and we have also conducted raids, which have yielded a lot of information about the earnings of these people. The labour department, BMC, the home department, the women and child development department will work together and work out a policy to solve this menace, the minister said. 

 But police and social welfare organisations say this is easier said than done.

 We pick them up from various areas and put them in homes but in 1-2 months, they are back on the streets, a senior police official said.

 Its difficult to keep them in homes. They are addicted to begging... they want raw cash in their hands, immediate cash, and they dont get it here, so they leave, echoed Atul Haksar of Karuna Welfare, an organisation working for their rehabilitation. 

 The police and the NGOs insist that not all beggars are poor. They are not really destitute. Sometimes they are construction workers who send their kids to beg while they work, some have land and property in the village and come to Mumbai in the off season to beg and collect money to take home, Haksar said. 

 Karuna Welfare has taken steps to ensure that children who are brought in do not go back to the streets, he added.

 We make it very clear that once they go out, they will not be taken in again. Perhaps what they need most is genuine love and affection and unless thats given to them, they will not give up the ready cash.

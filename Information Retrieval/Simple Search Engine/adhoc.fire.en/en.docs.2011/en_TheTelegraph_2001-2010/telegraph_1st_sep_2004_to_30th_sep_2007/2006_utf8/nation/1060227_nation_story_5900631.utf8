 Feast on flu, Rs 40 a plate

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Shimla, Feb. 26: The avian flu scare has come as a bonus for the states large labourer community which is making the most of the fall in chicken prices.

 While the regular buyers have switched to fish and mutton, the labourers ? Nepalese in particular ? are feasting on chicken two times a day.

 Earlier, a plate of chicken would cost Rs 110. We couldnt afford it. Now its available for Rs 40. One plate is enough for two people, and were enjoying ourselves, said Ram Bahadur, one of the states over 13,000 Nepalese labourers, in Shimla.

 Sellers at the state capitals deserted chicken shops ? which used to sell 3,000 to 5,000 birds everyday ? are dejected.

 The bird flu scare has broken the backbone of the poultry industry. Were just selling 10 per cent of our chicken stock now. Chicken prices have fallen by over 50 per cent while the prices of mutton and fish have shot up, said Suresh Goyal, a chicken seller in Shimla.

 The avian influenza scare has intensified since three peacocks died within hours of each other on Wednesday in Kandaghat, 30 km from here.

 Were waiting for the blood test reports of these birds from a laboratory in Jalandhar (in Punjab), said Rajinder Singh Chauhan, divisional forest officer, at Kandaghat forest range. 

 The possible reason for the death of these peacocks is poisoning, but we cannot rule out bird flu till the reports reach us.

 After the outbreak in Maharashtra, the northern states of Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Uttar Pradesh and Uttaranchal are being considered risk areas because they attract a large population of migratory birds every winter. 

 Himachal Pradesh hosts the highest number of bar-headed geese, a known carrier of the H5N1 virus.

 Although the birds have begun returning to their homelands with the rise in mercury, the danger hasnt passed, officials said.

 The blood samples taken from some migratory birds last November tested negative. Samples from government hatcheries and poultry farms, too, have tested negative. But we cannot rule out bird flu in the state, said V.K. Singh, a wildlife conservator in Kangra.

 The state government has sounded an alert and set up a bird flu monitoring cell in Shimla.

 Doctors are regularly taking samples from government hatcheries and poultry farms, said state animal husbandry minister Hursh Mahajan.

 Our hatcheries, though, supply just 10 per cent of the chickens sold in the market. The rest come from private farms in Punjab and Haryana. The chickens are being inspected on the inter-state borders and the dead birds are being destroyed. The state government is prepared to deal with the threat.

 Time to call hike doctor 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 14: Three decades ago, economist Manmohan Singh had impressed Indira Gandhi with his ability to find a remedy for inflation.

 Now, when his government has made fuel costlier at a time prices of foodstuff were already rising, the Prime Minister is looking to rediscover that magic touch.

 Government sources said the increased prices of cereals, pulses, vegetables and fruits are a seasonal occurrence and there is no cause for alarm. The trend has been evident over the last two months and is, therefore, not an offshoot of the hike in fuel prices.

 They added that the crucial factor now was the monsoon ? a good one might immediately improve the situation and a failed one would worsen it.

 While the government has stocked up on wheat through imports, the sources said it might do the same if there was a shortfall of pulses such as moong, whose price has gone through the roof.

 The sources stressed that reining in inflation was the Prime Ministers first priority and that he had acted fast as soon as the first warning signals were visible. The cabinet committee on prices had met two weeks ago, and a meeting of the economic advisory council was called last week to which the governor of the Reserve Bank was summoned.

 Singh had earned the sobriquet inflation fighter in 1974 when India experienced its worst inflation after Independence. As the chief economic adviser to the finance ministry, he had devised a package to rein in inflation, which had caught the attention of the then Prime Minister, Indira Gandhi. Singh was soon made a secretary in the economic affairs ministry.

 The sources said there were several aspects to the current inflation. One, the prices of commodities such as fuel, steel, cement and food have risen internationally.

 Two, before the impact of the rains is known every year, there is a tendency to hoard which leads to inflation. Three, the fuel price hike could impact consumer durables prices in another two weeks.

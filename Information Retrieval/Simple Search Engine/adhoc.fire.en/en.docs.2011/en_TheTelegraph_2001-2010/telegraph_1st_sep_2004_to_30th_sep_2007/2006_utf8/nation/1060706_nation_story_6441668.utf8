 Actress eludes temple duo

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Bangalore, July 5: Kannada actress Jayamala today did not meet a team from the Travancore Devaswom Board probing her claim of visiting the Sabarimala hill shrine, off limits to women between 10 and 60 years.

 The boards vigilance superintendent of police, Ashok Kumar, and a temple official, Balachandran, visited the Bangalore police commissioners office this morning seeking help to record Jayamalas statement as the temple board ? due to meet on July 7 ? has to decide the kind of probe to order on the alleged defilement. 

 The duo met additional commissioner Bipin Gopalakrishna.

 An astrologer recently revealed that Jayamala, then 27, was pushed by the crowd and managed to touch the feet of the presiding deity, Lord Ayappa.

 As the crowd was huge, people in my group, including myself, were pushed into the sanctum sanctorum. I happened to touch the feet of the Lord. It was a very beautiful experience, she had said.

 Today Jayamala said the two-member team had not contacted her. The additional commissioner spoke to me over phone and told me they had come, she said.

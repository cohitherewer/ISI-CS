The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Time plea for CAS 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 17: The government has sought up to eight more months to implement the conditional access system in Delhi, Calcutta and Mumbai.

 Information and broadcasting ministry officials said a petition was filed in Delhi High Court on Saturday seeking more time to introduce the system in the three metros. 

 The petition is in response to a high court directive on March 10 asking the government to implement the system in four weeks.

 The ruling came after cable operators moved court saying they had already made huge investments for the system before the government abandoned the idea in 2003.

 As of now, only Chennai has implemented the system, in which consumers can choose which channel they want to watch and pay only for them. But for that they need a set-top box.

 In the petition the I amp;B ministry said it had not been possible to implement the system in four weeks as it is a complex matter. 

 The ministry also said that the cable operators and broadcasters with whom it discussed the issue, had asked for six to eight months time. The ministry is now awaiting the courts ruling on its petition.

 There were several rounds of meetings between the ministry and cable operators in the four weeks given by the court. The cable operators have agreed to the six-to-eight-month time frame to introduce the system in the three metros.

 The broadcasters, however, seem reluctant. They did not specify the price they would charge for individual channels brought to home through the system. 

 The broadcasters prefer bundling the channels, which could mean that viewers may be forced to pay for an entire bunch of channels offered by a broadcaster.

 Ministry officials have hinted that if the court does not agree to the time frame when the matter is heard again, the ministry might suggest involving the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India to sort out the issue.

 The telecom regulator, which is also the broadcast regulator, may be asked to fix the prices for individual channels. The idea is to ensure that an average households cable bill does not go up significantly with the introduction of the system.

 Toyota tiff raises Honda ghost

 Bangalore, Jan. 7: Around 300 angry workers of Toyota Kirloskar Motors have locked themselves inside their factory complex in a standoff with management and police, reviving memories of last Julys Gurgaon clash.

 Production has come to a halt at the unit on Bidadi industrial estate, 35 km from Bangalore, which makes Prado, Corolla and Camry cars and Innova SUVs.

 The strikers, protesting since Friday against the sacking of three colleagues, have threatened to blow up two gas tanks at the factory if these workers are not reinstated.

 Outside the gates, as a strong posse of policemen watched, trade union members told journalists the management was forcing upon them a Gurgaon-Honda type situation and that things could spiral out of control.

 On July 25 at Gurgaon, a large police force mercilessly beat agitating employees of Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India, a subsidiary of Japans Honda Motor, injuring hundreds. Many went missing, with fellow workers claiming they had been killed. The Honda workers, too, had been agitating to get suspended and sacked colleagues reinstated.

 The Toyota Kirloskar workers began their strike on Friday afternoon. On Saturday morning, the situation turned ugly with about 1,000 strikers walking in and asking some who had reported for duty to stop work.

 The management called in the police, who are camping outside the gates. On Saturday night, a company spokesperson told The Telegraph there were at least 300 workers still inside the factory.

 They are roaming around the complex. While production has stopped fully, there is also no food left in the canteen. The stocks we had would have lasted only till the afternoon. They must be hungry and we are appealing to them to come out, the spokesperson said.

 The roots of the unrest lie in 2004 when the company suspended 15 employees on the charge of misbehaving with and roughing up supervisors and ordered an independent inquiry.

 The probe found three of the workers guilty and recommended their dismissal, and reinstated one. This left 11, of whom one has resigned while the rest still awaits a verdict.

 The unions are asking why the inquiry took almost two years when it should have been completed within three months.

 Fridays action against the three prompted a lightning strike. The management asked the state government to intervene. The labour department started peace moves on Friday but put off Saturdays hearing till Monday, further angering the workers who accused the government of colluding with the management.

 The company had earlier faced labour trouble in 2002 when a strike prompted it to declare a lockout. Of its 2,378 employees, about 1,500 are union members.

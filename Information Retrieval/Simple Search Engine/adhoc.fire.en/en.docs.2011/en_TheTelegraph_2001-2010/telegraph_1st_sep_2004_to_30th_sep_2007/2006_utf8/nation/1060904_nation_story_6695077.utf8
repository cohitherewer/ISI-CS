 Thank don, crusaders are in the spotlight

 Lucknow, Sept. 3: Oil executive B. Manjunathan was shot dead because he took on the states fuel adulteration mafia. Road engineer Satyendra Dubeys body was found on a Gaya street after he refused to keep quiet about corruption.

 But Raj Kumar Sharma wouldnt learn.

 When a gangster threatened him over the phone because he wouldnt sign a fake bill, the 32-year-old irrigation department engineer decided this was a challenge. He issued a stern warning to juniors: they mustnt pay the sum to the contractor the gangster had named.

 That was sometime in April. On May 9, as Sharma stepped out of his home in Basti in eastern Uttar Pradesh, four men were waiting for him. The spray of bullets killed him instantly.

 Unlike the Indian Oil Corporations star manager, or the IIT engineer who had complained directly to the Prime Minister, the slain state government employee remained in oblivion in a region hardened to gangster killings.

 The spotlight turned on him only after police gunned down the gang leader who had ordered his murder, Ramesh Pandey, at the Faizabad cantonment area this morning.

 The success spurred the state administration to admit the danger courageous officials face in the badlands of eastern Uttar Pradesh.

 Engineers and development officers of the irrigation and public works departments work under a grave risk to their lives, said principal secretary, home, S.K. Agarwal.

 Although only one engineer was killed, many more are under threat from criminal gangs, agreed state police chief Bua Singh.

 Officials admitted that the gangs virtually lord it over eastern Uttar Pradeshs backward districts of Mirzapur, Jaunpur, Ghazipur and Bhadohi, hobbling development projects.

 Bolstered by their links with Mumbais mafia dons, they have built around them a network of contractors. The gangs make sure that these contractors bag most government jobs in return for a cut.

 Its not just the crimes they commit. These gangs are deterring the development of the region, Agarwal said. 

 The gangs are known to be patronised by politicians. But the police chief refused to acknowledge the political link. 

 In the past five months, 210 members of various criminal gangs were gunned down across the state. Had there been much of political patronage, could we have done this, Singh said.

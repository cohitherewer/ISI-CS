 Summons to stars

 Jodhpur, May 8 (PTI): A local court today ordered actors Salman Khan, Saif Ali Khan, Neelam, Tabu and Sonali Bendre to appear before it in person on May 19 in the black buck poaching case.

 The district judicial magistrate directed to reframe the charges against them in connection with the poaching of two endangered black bucks in Rajasthans Kankani village in 1998.

 An additional district and session judge had recently ordered to drop some of the charges framed by the lower court against the actors and partially allowed revision petitions filed by them.

 Counsels for Salman and other 

 celebrities urged the court to fix the date of reframing 

 the charges after May 14 as the actor is touring abroad.

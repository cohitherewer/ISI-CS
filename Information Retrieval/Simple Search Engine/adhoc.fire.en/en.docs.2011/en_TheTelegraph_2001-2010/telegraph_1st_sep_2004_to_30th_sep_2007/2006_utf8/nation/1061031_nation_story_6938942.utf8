 Pak anti-terror concern

 Islamabad, Oct. 30 (PTI): Pakistan wants the joint anti-terror mechanism agreed with India to be headed by top foreign ministry officials of both sides and hopes that differences over its set-up would be resolved at the upcoming foreign secretary-level talks.

 Pakistan is suggesting a mechanism headed by the additional foreign secretary as the foreign ministry is the focal point in dealing with any country whether on agriculture, defence or weather, Pakistan foreign minister Khursheed Mehmood Kasuri said. It is basically the ministry of foreign affairs that deals with other countries on all issues relating to that particular country.

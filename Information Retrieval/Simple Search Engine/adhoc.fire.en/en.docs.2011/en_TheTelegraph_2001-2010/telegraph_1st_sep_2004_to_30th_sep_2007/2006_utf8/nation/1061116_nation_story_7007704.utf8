 Baiters spill Iran secret to wreck nuke deal

 Washington, Nov. 15: In a last-ditch attempt to prevent the Senate from favourably considering the Indo-US nuclear deal, opponents of the agreement have leaked a request from Congressional leaders for a secret intelligence assessment of Indias ties to Iran.

 The leak, published in The Washington Post today, also charges that 10 months after a request from both parties on Capitol Hill for a secret assessment of Indias nuclear capabilities, their request has been ignored by the Bush administration.

 The office of John Negroponte, director of national intelligence, refused to comment on the Congressional request or its status to The Washington Post or to anyone else, but the report is certain to stir anger on Capitol Hill that the administration, which is under attack after the Republican reversals in the recent elections, is ignoring and bypassing the Congress on the nuclear deal.

 The Congressional request also seeks secret information on Indias non-proliferation commitments, its export controls and the security of Indian material to produce weapons of mass destruction.

 To make matters difficult for India, the Congressional Research Service (CRS) yesterday released a report underlining significant differences between the positions of Washington and New Delhi on Tehrans nuclear programme.

 Such a view is bound to sway some senators away from supporting the deal as it comes up any time now before the Senate.

 Simultaneously, 18 prominent advocates of non-proliferation here, in a joint letter to all 100 senators, said that unless there are sweeping amendments, the proposed legislation in the Senate on the deal would have far-reaching and adverse effects on US non-proliferation and security objectives.

 At a well-attended gathering here yesterday, opponents of the deal urged changes in the agreement and some called for ending nuclear cooperation with India.

 Supporters of the deal are to put up a show of strength today and map their strategy at a high profile working lunch. 

 The CRS report alleged that India and Iran traded in very limited nuclear, chemical and missile-related equipment in the past, pointing out that between 1998 and 2003, the US sanctioned Indian entities for chemical and biological-related exports to Iraq.

 These sanctions have, however, been questioned by India as they were announced.

 According to aides to key senators, the legislation enabling implementation of the deal was to have come up before the chamber today, but at the time of writing a number of differences over the text of the legislation and amendments thereto have yet to be resolved between the Republicans and the Democrats.

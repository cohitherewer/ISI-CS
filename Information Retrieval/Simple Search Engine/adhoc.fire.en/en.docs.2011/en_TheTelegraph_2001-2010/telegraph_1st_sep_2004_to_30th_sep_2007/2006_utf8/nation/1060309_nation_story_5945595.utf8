 UK permit

 London, March 8 (PTI): Non-European Union doctors wishing to work in the UK, including those from India, will require a work permit from July, Britains health minister Lord Warner announced today. 

 This means any National Health Service trust wishing to employ a non-EU doctor will have to prove that a home-grown doctor cannot fill the post, ending the permit-free training arrangement for international doctors.

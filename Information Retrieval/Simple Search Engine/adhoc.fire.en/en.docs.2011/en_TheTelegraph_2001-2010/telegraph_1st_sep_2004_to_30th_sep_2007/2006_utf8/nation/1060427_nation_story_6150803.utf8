 Free Pakistan captives: HC

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Chandigarh, April 26: Punjab and Haryana High Court today ordered the release of Pakistani prisoners who had completed their terms and asked the government to send them back.

 The division bench of the high court, comprising Justice H.S. Bedi and Justice R.S. Randhawastan, has ordered the release of 45 Pakistani prisoners in Punjab jails who had completed their terms ranging from three to six months. 

 They had either strayed into Indian territory or had overstayed their visa period, said lawyer Ranjan Lakhanpal, who had filed a petition seeking their release last year.

 In his petition, Lakhanpal said 89 Pakistani prisoners were languishing in Punjab jails ? some for over five years after their term had ended.

 The court also ordered compensation of Rs 10,000 to each prisoner for every year spent in prison after the completion of sentence and an extra Rs 100 per day from today till they are repatriated to Pakistan. The court hoped that Pakistan, too, would release Indian prisoners who have served their terms but remain in jail.

 Lakhanpal, who started taking up the cases of Pakistanis languishing in Indian jails a decade ago as there was nobody to take up their cause, has been instrumental in sending back several Pakistanis. Two years ago, he secured the release of six children aged between 10 and 17 from Faridkot jail. 

 He continues to scan newspapers for more information on such prisoners and file petitions on their behalf. Most of the time, the prisoners do not even know him.

 A senior intelligence officer said it would not be easy to send the prisoners back. 

 Islamabad takes a long time to verify the nationality of Pakistanis who have been jailed in India. We dont want to keep them here for ever. The Pakistani government should act quickly to take back its own citizens who have been jailed in India for either overstaying or straying. Jailing them is easy. But sending them back is very difficult, he said.

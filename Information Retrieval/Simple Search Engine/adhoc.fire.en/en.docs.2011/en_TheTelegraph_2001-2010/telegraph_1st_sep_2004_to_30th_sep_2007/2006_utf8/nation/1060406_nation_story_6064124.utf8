 Indian offloaded for songs

 London, April 5 (AFP): Harraj Manns choice of music led the India-born Briton to be hauled off a London-bound plane last week.

 The 23-year-old played Londons Calling by The Clash and Led Zeppelins Immigrant Song on the stereo of a taxi he had taken to Durham Tees Valley airport in northern England.

 Mann soon began singing along and the taxi driver grew suspicious when he heard the lyrics carefully ? one of them declared Now war is declared and battle come down. He alerted police as soon as they reached the airport.

 Two officers boarded Manns flight shortly before take-off on Thursday.

 I got frog-marched off the plane in front of everyone, got my bags searched, (was) asked every question you can think of, Mann, a mobile phone salesman, told the local daily Hartlepool Mail on Monday. I was being held for questioning under the terrorism act.

 By the time Mann was set free, his plane had left.

 He (the driver) didnt like Led Zeppelin or The Clash, but I dont think there was any need to tell the police, a stung Mann told the Daily Mirror.

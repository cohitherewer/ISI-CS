 You can lecture, minus NET

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 16: The University Grants Commission plans to relax the norms for appointing lecturers in colleges and universities at the undergraduate and postgraduate levels.

 The National Eligibility Test (NET), now mandatory for such appointments, may be scrapped for MPhils and PhDs, with only those with a masters having to take the examination. This means MPhils and PhDs will be eligible to teach without having taken the NET ? or having failed it earlier.

 This will make it easier for would-be academics, for there is now no guarantee that a candidate with an MPhil or PhD will pass the NET.

 At a news conference today, UGC chairperson Sukhdeo Thorat said: The UGC in principle approves these recommendations, which were suggested by the Mungekar Committee.

 A NET applicant has to secure a masters in any of 77 select subjects with at least 55 per cent marks. Visually challenged applicants, or those from the Scheduled Castes or Scheduled Tribes, have to secure 50 per cent.

 Many academics say the exam, started with the objective of raising teaching standards, does not measure a candidates aptitude to teach. The question papers, the critics suggest, must be restructured. They also cite that regular appointments in colleges and universities have fallen.

 Faced with the criticism and a plummeting pass percentage in the NET, the UGC set up a committee headed by former Planning Commission member Balchandra Mungekar. States like Maharashtra demanded scrapping of the exam altogether.

 Its possible that the UGC may overhaul the examination. The emergence of non-conventional PG courses in universities has sparked a huge demand for eligible teachers in those areas. Broad-basing the NET in a way that provides for trans-discipline eligibility can help answer this demand.

 This may mean that a candidate who is qualified to teach English language and literature will also be able to teach a range of subjects ?communicative English, journalism, linguistics and so on ? in colleges and universities. This may mean changes in the way questions are framed in the NET.

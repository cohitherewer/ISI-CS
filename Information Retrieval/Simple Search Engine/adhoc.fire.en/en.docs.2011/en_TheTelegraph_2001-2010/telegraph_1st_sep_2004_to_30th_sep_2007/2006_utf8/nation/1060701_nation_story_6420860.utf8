 Mistakes possible: Apollo

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Hyderabad, June 30: The chairman of the Apollo group of hospitals today admitted to the possibility of slight mistakes in the records relating to Rahul Mahajans treatment but denied police allegations of fudging.

 I checked up all the records. There may be slight mistakes but I definitely rule out any fudging of documents? the books are very clean and clear to me, Dr Pratap C. Reddy said.

 Under a courts orders, police registered an FIR against Apollo Hospital in Delhi on June 9, accusing doctors and the management of misleading them with false information on Rahul.

 Reddy said any legal step necessary would be taken to protect the integrity of the hospital and its personnel.

 Rahul and his late father Pramods secretary Bibek Moitra were brought to the hospital in the small hours of June 2 after alleged drug overdose. Moitra was declared dead on arrival but the events in the run-up to Rahuls recovery hung a cloud over the hospital.

 The police said the hospital had delayed informing them of developments in Rahuls condition, tampered with evidence, overwritten entries and given false information on the toxicity suffered by the patient.

 Reddy said, The patients safety came first and that of reporting his arrival and condition to police later. They have done the right thing and I fully stand by them.

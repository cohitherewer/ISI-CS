 Brand Sachin slips a notch

 SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI

 Mumbai, Nov. 24: He is eyeing a global presence, signing one endorsement contract after another. But is Sachin Tendulkar as big a brand in India as his Rs 180-crore contract with Iconix the largest ever for an Indian sportsperson makes him out to be?

 Earlier this month, Sachin reportedly notched up the value of his three-year contract with Iconix to nearly Rs 240 crore by signing a tripartite deal with World Sports Group (WSG), a Singapore-based sports and celebrity management company.

 WSG wants to promote him as a global sporting icon like David Beckham and announced the association through a three-year contract between Sachin and Canon.

 We are tying up with at least 10 brands across Asia and Europe. Our first attempt will be to promote Tendulkar as a brand in Asia, and then move to the European and US markets, said Venu Nair, WSGs South Asia CEO.

 Many in the industry feel it would be a tall order, because cricket is not as popular globally as football. Besides, Sachins brand value is under some threat on home turf.

 The end of his five-year contract with WorldTel last year, and his injuries and poor form have seen his brand take a beating. In the interim, a new bunch of camera-savvy, talented sportspersons have occupied large chunks of the highly competitive space of sports endorsements.

 A recent study by AdEx India, a division of TAM Media Research, estimates that the monthly TV adspend on Sachin stood at Rs 0.62 crore in the first four months of 2006. It was Rahul Dravid who topped the charts.

 While the adspend on Dravid was estimated at Rs 1.32 crore a month, Irfan Pathan followed (among cricketers) with Rs 1.06 crore. Dhoni was third with 0.93 crore, said Siddhartha Mukherjee, director, communications, TAM Media Research.

 Sachin is fourth with Virender Sehwag breathing down his neck at Rs 0.59 crore. But Sachin is fifth on the list of all Indian sports stars, with tennis player Sania Mirza second after Dravid at Rs 1.10 crore.

 Sachins brand managers are working overtime to change the figures.

 But it looks a tough call, though things may get brighter by the end of the year. Sachin himself is extremely savvy in these matters and he had a big role in the ITC-Sunfeast deal signed recently, said a top Iconix source.

 The Sunfeast account, brought to Sachins kitty by Iconix, promotes him as a co-creator of a product rather than a brand ambassador. ITC will launch a new health food line called Sachin Fit Kit, for which the cricketer will provide his inputs.

 Sachin is also to appear in an animation series, and his career highlights will be captured in a coffee table book.

 There is also a project to market Sachin memorabilia, the Iconix source said.

 Two Sachin video games are to be launched in India and abroad in the next six months.

 Adspend on television does not completely reflect a celebritys brand value. But yes, it is indicative, said Jeet Banerji, president of sports management firm Gameplan.

 Sachins brand managers feel foraying into virgin territories and mediums may help turn things around.

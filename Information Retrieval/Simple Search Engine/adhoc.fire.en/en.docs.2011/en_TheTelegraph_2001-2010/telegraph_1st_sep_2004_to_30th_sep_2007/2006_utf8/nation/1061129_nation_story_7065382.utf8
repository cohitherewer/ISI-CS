 Man Friday who got to know too many secrets

 RANJAN DASGUPTA 

 Shashinath Jha 

 Ranchi, Nov. 28: Shashinath Jha was the model Man Friday, taking care of his masters every need, from buying the vegetables he ate for lunch to looking after his personal papers.

 In the end, this access to secrets might have been the undoing of the shadowy man from Santhal Parganas who had turned himself into Shibu Sorens shadow in Delhi.

 Many believe the private secretary whom Soren affectionately called terha he couldnt walk straight because of a hip injury was done away with because he had got a little too greedy and begun blackmailing his boss.

 The buzz is that Jha would threaten to expose Soren in the JMM bribery case in which party MPs had been accused of selling their votes to the Narasimha Rao government unless the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha chief shut his mouth with money.

 Soren initially paid up but the 45-year-old Jha apparently didnt know when to stop.

 Jha had accompanied Soren to Delhi when the JMM leader became an MP for the first time in 1980. 

 He was a very nice man and of great help to Guruji (Soren), says former Morcha MP Suraj Mandal.

 Jha had wonderful organising capacity and was a very good coordinator, another former Soren aide said.

 But the 14 years in the capital seemed to change Jha.

 He was initially a teetotaller but gradually became addicted to liquor. In the party, he was known for his drinking abilities, a former JMM leader recalled.

 Jha gradually earned Sorens confidence and began dealing with his mentors financial matters.

 The CBI chargesheet mentions that Soren had lavished financial favours on Jha between 1993 and 1994. He had floated a company, Simex International, and made Jha a partner. It was shut down immediately after Jha disappeared in May 1994.

 Three days before his disappearance, the CBI claimed, Jha had told some people he had sodomised a close relative of Soren. This appears to have sealed his fate.

 His killers are believed to have brought Jha from Delhi to Dhanbad on the Rajdhani Express and then to Ranchi by road. They allegedly dined with their victim on the night of May 22, 1994, and then killed him and buried the body near Piska in Ranchi district.

 Soren was in Orissa to campaign for a party candidate when he received a phone call from Delhi that said Jha had been missing for several days, a former colleague said.

 He rebuked the caller and asked him to seek every possible help to trace Jha. He was visibly worried.

 The agencys chargesheet had said that days before his murder, Jha had told his mother Priyambada Devi and brother Vijay Nath Jha that he feared physical harm.

 In 1996, Priyambada and Jharkhand Peoples Party president Mukesh Baba petitioned Delhi High Court for Jha to be traced and produced in court. Three years later, the CBI exhumed the body. Two DNA tests were needed to identify it.

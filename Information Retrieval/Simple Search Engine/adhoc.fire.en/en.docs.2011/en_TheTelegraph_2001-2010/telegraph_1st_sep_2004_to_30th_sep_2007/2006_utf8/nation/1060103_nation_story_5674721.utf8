 Upset for Lakshman

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 2: Just when Pramod Mahajan had started enjoying his new tag of Lakshman in the BJP, a Supreme Court notice has spoilt his party.

 The apex court has issued notices to the Centre, the CBI and the Central Vigilance Commission on a PIL seeking a probe into whether Reliance Infocomm was allowed to launch WLL as a full mobility service without paying the required licence fee when Mahajan was the telecom minister in the NDA government.

 The petitioner, Citizens Forum against Corruption, alleged that Reliance Infocomm had allotted shares worth Rs 1 crore to three front companies at Re 1 each as against the Rs 55 each paid by Reliance Industries itself for the same share at the same time. 

 The circumstances surrounding the allotment of the shares raise a strong suspicion that the real beneficiary of these shares was Mahajan and his family, argued Prashant Bhushan, the counsel for the NGO.

 The timing of the PIL could not have been worse for Mahajan. He had just been bestowed the honour of being Lakshman to the BJPs Ram ? which is L.K. Advani ? by none other than Atal Bihari Vajpayee when news of the PIL started like whispers in party circles.

 Mahajan reacted almost immediately by calling a press conference. The BJP promptly sent mobile text messages to the media saying Mahajan would meet the press at 4 pm today. But it was cancelled and the party sent word that he would release a statement.

 I have come to know from the media that a PIL has been filed in the Supreme Court against some decision of mine as a minister for communication and information technology. Neither have I received any notice from the apex court nor has the copy of the PIL been marked to me. Therefore, it is difficult for me to comment on the details, said Mahajan.

 I wish to state, unequivocally and emphatically, that I have not taken any decision which has favoured any particular company during my tenure as the minister for communications and IT. All the files are open with the department, Mahajan added.

 The Congress has refused to comment on the matter.

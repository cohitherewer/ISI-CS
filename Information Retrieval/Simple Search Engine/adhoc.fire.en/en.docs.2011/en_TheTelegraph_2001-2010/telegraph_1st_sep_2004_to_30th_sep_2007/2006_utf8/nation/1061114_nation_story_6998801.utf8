 N.D. Tiwari: Not in control

Lucknow, Nov. 13: Back-to-back murders of a leading scientist and a mahant, coming a month after an acid attack on an actresss sister, have given the Opposition in Uttaranchal a poll plank months before the state elections.

 A day after Anil Kumar Tiwari, director of the Uttaranchal Space Application Centre, died of bullet injuries in Dehra Dun, a mahant was gunned down before his temple in Hardwar this morning.

 Chief minister N.D. Tiwari has clearly lost control. The crime surge will be a major issue against the states Congress government in the next election, Romesh Pokerwal of the BJP said.

 The Samajwadi Party, under fire over law and order in poll-bound Uttar Pradesh which it rules, is citing Uttaranchal to hit back at the Congress.

 The chief minister, busy inaugurating development projects, has dismissed the charges.

 The Congress seeks re-election on strength of the development work it has done in the state. The Opposition is raising law and order as an issue. But its no better in BJP-ruled states, Tiwari told a farmers rally yesterday after unveiling projects worth Rs 118 crore at Udham Singh Nagar.

 Police are groping for clues in the murder of the space scientist in his mid-30s, who was shot at his doorstep before his wife and two children as the family returned home after dining out on Saturday evening.

 City superintendent M.S. Nepayth said the killers, who came on a motorbike and seemed to be waiting for the victim, are likely to be professionals.

 So are apparently the gang of four who pumped bullets into Hardwar mahant Ram Niwas Acharya as he stepped out of his temple after the morning worship. Officers say rival sadhus may have had a hand in the murder.

 The man who attacked Rangoli Ranaut, sister of actress Kangana Ranaut, was given bail today. He had entered the victims rented home in Dehra Dun and hurled acid on her face and body. One of her friends, Vijaya Chublani, too, suffered minor burns.

 Congress leaders in Uttar Pradesh admit that Uttaranchal has dampened their campaign against chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadavs alleged failure to tackle crime.

 Our campaign here has lost some sting after the recent happenings in Uttaranchal, a senior Congress leader said in Lucknow.

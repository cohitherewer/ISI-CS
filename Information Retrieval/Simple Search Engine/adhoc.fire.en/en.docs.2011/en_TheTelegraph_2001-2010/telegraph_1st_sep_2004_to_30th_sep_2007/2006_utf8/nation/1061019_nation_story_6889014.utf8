The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Caste heat on AIIMS head

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 18: A high 

 court injunction against his dismissal brought little respite 

 for AIIMS director P. Venugopal, with the institutes 

 governing body alleging caste discrimination under his watch 

 and a dwindling support base among AIIMS students becoming 

 apparent.

 At a high-octane meeting of the governing body, caste-based ghettoisation in the countrys premier medical institute first revealed by The Telegraph was brought up by as many as 10 out of the 14 members who attended.

 Venugopal (in picture) was repeatedly asked to explain why the large number of complaints from SC/ST students alleging discrimination were not investigated, a member said. 

 BJP leader V.K. Malhotra walked out of the meeting almost immediately after it began, calling the attempt unconstitutional and illegal.

 The BJP has supported Venugopal in his tussle with health minister Anbumani Ramadoss, which came into the open during the anti-quota agitation.

 The volley of accusations came barely a couple of hours after the high court reiterated that Venugopal couldnt be dismissed from the post of director.

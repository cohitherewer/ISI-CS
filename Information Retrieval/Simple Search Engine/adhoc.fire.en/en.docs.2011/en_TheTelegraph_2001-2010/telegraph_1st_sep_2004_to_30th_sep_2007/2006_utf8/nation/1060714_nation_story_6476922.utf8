The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Afraid of being looked at in a certain way

 - How does it feel to be a muslim in Mumbai?

 Huma Khan, a victim of the 1993 

 riots in Mumbai, recounts the hours following the blasts 

 on Tuesday. She works for the Urdu section of Voice of America.

 Around 6.30 on Tuesday evening, I was in Dongri, interviewing someone. I got an SMS that said: Bomb blasts in Mumbai.

 I rushed out. I walked through Dongri to Mohammad Ali Road, both Muslim areas. Traffic was not moving. 

 The rows of shops on Mohammad Ali Road were still open, but everyone looked disoriented. The air was tense. Bahut lafda ho gaya (there has been big trouble), I heard being said.

 From Victoria Terminus, I took a taxi to go to nearby Charni Road, where my relatives stay. The driver asked me what the matter was ? he didnt know about the blasts. When I told him, he asked if there were any blasts on the Harbour line.

 We went past Fashion Street and turned right towards Churchgate station ? and saw the crowd. Thousands and thousands of people ? train commuters who couldnt go home ? were walking towards the station. Traffic was at a standstill.

 Suddenly, a crowd of about 20 to 30 people came charging at our taxi. They were demanding to be taken in. After I got down at Charni Road, they would take the taxi to Andheri, Borivli.

 But the driver refused. I started to fight with him. I told him that he should try to help people at such times. What was stopping him?

 Hamarey jaan ko khatra hai (My life is in danger), he said. For the first time I really looked at him. I saw he had a beard. I realised he was a Muslim.

 Aap bhi utar jaaiye (You also get down), he said. I will go back. I got down and started to walk.

 I remembered that when I was inside the taxi, my mother called and we had a strange conversation. She insisted that I take off a tabeez (amulet) around my neck that she had given, as it would mark me out as a Muslim. I had fought so much with her, refusing to wear the tabeez, till I had given in.

 But now she was asking me to take it off and I was refusing. Finally, this time too, I had to give in. I had put it away in my handbag. The taxi driver must have heard the conversation.

 I started to walk with the crowd. Past buses and trucks, overrun with people who had just managed a toehold. 

 I fell into a conversation with a woman from Virar. She was not a Muslim. She said she wanted to stay the night at Grant Road, a little ahead, but was not sure she would even reach there. Kuchh bhi ho sakta hai (Anything can happen now), she said.

 If she was tense, parts of the crowd were erupting into fury. In logone yeh sab kiya hai. In miya logone. (These people have done it. These Muslims), I heard people muttering.

 I remembered 1993. My house in Charni Road was burnt to ashes by a mob. We had run out of our house, my home since childhood, barefoot. 

 Fourteen of us were packed into a car and driven to a family friends house, as we saw the mob storming in and setting fire. When we returned, there was nothing that remained of our past. I can never forget it. 

 I know how much it takes to bounce back. It takes the life out of you.

 This time, as I entered the lane where my old house stood, I saw a police van and two constables. It was d?j? vu. During the riots, too, it would be exactly this ? a police van and two constables posted here.

 The worst seems to be over for now. That is because Mumbai understands that the blasts are the work of miscreants ? they have nothing to do with common people. The city has not been provoked by communal talk from politicians.

 Muslims in the city are scared, though. They are afraid of the raids on their homes, which have already started. But I feel guilty in a way. I am afraid of people looking at me in a certain way. For somehow, somewhere, they will link me with Simi or other terrorist outfits because they belong to my community. I suffer because of them.

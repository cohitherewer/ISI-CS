 Mole brings Yashwant to BJP front

 New Delhi, Aug. 6: Yashwant Sinha has emerged as the face of the BJP in the Rajya Sabha with Jaswant Singh keeping a low profile in the wake of the mole controversy.

 Sinha, who was Jaswants successor as foreign minister, has been the partys most visible leader in the run-up to finalising the sense of the House on the Indo-US nuclear deal.

 Although Atal Bihari Vajpayee and former national security adviser Brajesh Mishra are reportedly active behind the scenes, it is to Sinha that the former Prime Minister seems to have entrusted the task of articulating the partys line. 

 Jaswant, who is the leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha, has been under attack since he alleged that there was a mole in P.V. Narasimha Raos PMO who leaked nuclear secrets to the US, but failed to come out with the name.

 Sinha was the BJPs representative in what came to be known as the group of four. Other members of the group were Rajya Sabha MPs Sitaram Yechury of the CPM, Amar Singh of the Samajwadi Party and Digvijay Singh of the Janata Dal (United). 

 The agenda was to work out a sense of the House against what the Left and the BJP have described as attempts by the US to shift the goalposts on the nuclear deal.

 While there were murmurs in the BJP circles about Sinhas sudden burst of enthusiasm, that the top leadership was backing him became clear at the BJP parliamentary party meeting on August 1. In the afternoon, it was neither Jaswant Singh nor Murli Manohar Joshi but Sinha, seen as a dissident not very long ago, who addressed the news conference.

 Sinha met Yechury the same afternoon, and later said he was hopeful of a positive result. The sense I get from the Left is that they are still keen on a resolution. Even the Congress MPs have expressed their consent. Let us see what comes out of it.

 The former foreign minister even managed to create a rift within the Left Front, with the CPI announcing that it would have no understanding with the BJP but the CPM appearing to do business with the saffron party.

 In the end, it all augurs well for the veteran from Jharkhand.

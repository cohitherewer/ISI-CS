 Nuclear deal rescued from brink of collapse

 Washington, March 3: In the end, the Indo-US nuclear agreement was an exercise in numbers.

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh made a commitment to Parliament on Monday that roughly 65 per cent of the total installed thermal nuclear power capacity of the country would be classified as civilian facilities by the end of the separation plan.

 The task before negotiators on both sides even as Singh was meeting President George W. Bush was to match this figure of 65 per cent with the number of nuclear facilities which will come under full-scope safeguards.

 The Americans wanted 18 of Indias 22 nuclear reactors ? including the seven under construction ? to be open for inspections. India offered 10. The deal nearly fell through because the gap of eight facilities, which the two sides could not agree on, was too large to bridge.

 Singh had set up two working groups to push through the separation plan: these groups were made up of officials in the department of atomic energy, the ministry of external affairs, the armed forces and own advisers in the Prime Ministers office.

 One group prepared several scenarios as part of the prospective separation effort. If one plan was unacceptable to US negotiators to the point of being a deal-breaker, there would be an alternative to negotiate over.

 The other group provided steady inputs to foreign secretary Shyam Saran and Indian ambassador to the US, Ronen Sen, who were at the centre of talks with the US under-secretary of state for political affairs, Nicholas Burns, and Bushs national security adviser Steve Hadley on the opposite side.

 After negotiating through half the night and again from early morning until 10.30 am on Thursday, the two sides settled for a middle figure. Both India and the US gave in on four facilities and settled for 14. But that does not tell the whole story. The working group set up to detail several separation scenarios was adamant that certain reactors should be kept out of full-scope safeguards and remain in the military sphere.

 Tarapur IV, for instance. It is Indias largest atomic power plant, which was built ahead of schedule, braving severe international constraints and uses natural uranium as fuel. Tarapur IV went critical only last year.

 The nuclear scientists also wanted to keep Tarapur III, which was delayed in its construction, out of the civilian scope. 

 In the end, keeping some of the larger plants out of the civilian sphere was a plan that found acceptance, matching Singhs commitment to Parliament of 65 per cent with a figure of 14 facilities the US agreed to.

 Meanwhile, Bush took a political decision to exempt Indias existing fast breeder reactors ? one prototype fast breeder reactor and one test fast breeder reactor ? from safeguards.

 In return, Singh took a similar decision that any future fast breeders to be built by India will be classified as civilian facilities. The two leaders also agreed that India would continue to produce fissile material even as America looked the other way.

 This places India in the same category as China. Of the five declared nuclear powers, the US, UK, France and Russia have all agreed to a voluntary moratorium on production of new fissile material.

 An unstated clause in the agreement is that India can build new nuclear facilities for military purposes, but these will have to be adjuncts to the existing ones in this category.

 This has been made possible because Singh and Bush agreed that India would not share any information with the US or with the international community about its military programme.

 Having got formal acknowledgement of the existence of a military programme, that leaves India pretty much free to do what it wants with its military nuclear facilities.

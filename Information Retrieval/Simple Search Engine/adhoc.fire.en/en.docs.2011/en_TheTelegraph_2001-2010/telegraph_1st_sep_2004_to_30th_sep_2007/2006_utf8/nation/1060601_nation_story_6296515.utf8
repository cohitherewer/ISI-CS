 Pawar team pitch 

for 3-year term

 Sharad Pawar: Long innings

 Mumbai/Calcutta, May 31: The cricket boards special general meeting takes place tomorrow to pass controversial amendments to rules to allow the president, other office-bearers and national selectors to enjoy a three-year term.

 Sources told The Telegraph that a dispute has arisen over whether the far-reaching amendments need a two-thirds or a three-fourths majority. While the BCCIs constitution talks of two-thirds, the Societies Act of Tamil Nadu (under which the board is registered) demands three-fourths. 

 The Pawar group is scared of another election and wants to ensure that it gets a longer mandate. But we have asked for a secret ballot tomorrow. We hope to defeat it if a secret ballot is allowed, a BCCI member of the rival camp said.

 Shashank Manohar, the BCCI vice-president who chaired the constitution review committee that suggested the amendments, said: We felt that since elections are annual, a board president gets just six to seven months to implement programmes. A three-year term will give him time to do work.

 If the current set of office-bearers is re-elected at the next annual general meeting in September, they will have two more years without having to face the electorate. 

 The three-year term is one of the amendments to 12 clauses in the memorandum and rules regulations of the board.

 Clause 20 (iii) of the amended rules states: The president shall be elected on the principle of zonal rotation of one term of three years.

 The zonal rotation would work as follows: west, central, south, east and north. 

 Defining the eligibility of a president, the amendments say he should be either the past or present office-bearer or vice-president of the board, and must have represented a member from the same zone at three annual general meetings.

 It is recommended that the candidate for the president and the vice-presidents should be proposed and seconded by representatives of a full member from the same zone from which they are seeking election.

 Another inclusion in the amendments is Clause 20 (v) which says: In case of a vacancy occurring in the office of president by reason of death or by his being convicted in a criminal case by a competent court or by resignation or otherwise, the secretary shall within 15 days convene a special general meeting to elect the president who shall be from the same zone and he shall hold the office till the next election.

 Critics of the Pawar regime place this amendment in the context of the criminal case lodged against former board chief Jagmohan Dalmiya who stands accused of misappropriation of funds.

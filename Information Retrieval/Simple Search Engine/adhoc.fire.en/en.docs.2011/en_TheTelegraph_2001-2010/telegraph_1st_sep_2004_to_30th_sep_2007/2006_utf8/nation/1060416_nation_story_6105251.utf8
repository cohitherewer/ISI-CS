 Diamond haul

 Ludhiana, April 15 (PTI): Diamond jewellery worth Rs 5.5 crore, being illegally imported into India, was seized from a passenger at the Amritsar airport today.

 Acting on a tip-off, sleuths of the directorate of revenue intelligence seized the jewellery from a man, travelling by Uzbekistan Airlines, on the ground of non-compliance with the Customs Act which resulted in duty evasion of over Rs 2 crore.

 We had information that a passenger of Uzbekistan Airlines was carrying diamond jewellery without declaring the item as per the foreign trade policy norms. When we searched his bag, we found jewellery worth Rs 5.5 crore, a directorate official said.

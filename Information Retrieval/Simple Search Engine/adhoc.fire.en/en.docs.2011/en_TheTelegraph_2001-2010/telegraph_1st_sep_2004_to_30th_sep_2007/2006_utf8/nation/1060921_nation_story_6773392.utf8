 Parliament can axe MP, court told

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 20: Attorney-general Milon K. Banerjee today said despite the absence of a law, Parliament has the power to expel its members.

 In the absence of a positive law, powers and privileges would be sufficiently available (to the House) as a constitutional authority, additional solicitor-general Gopal Subramaniam told a Constitution bench while making submissions on behalf of the attorney-general.

 Banerjee is assisting the Supreme Court in deciding whether Parliament has the power to expel its members.

 In view of the nature of constitutional immunity, it is essential to have a privilege, which is capable of being treated as an in-built safeguard against the abuse of free speech, Subramaniam said.

 That safeguard can be done only by Parliament either in exercise of its powers and privileges or by codified statute law, he told the bench examining the expulsion of 11 MPs accused in the cash-for-questions scam.

 Subramaniam said the Constitution has a provision for termination of membership by operation of law and not by an act of Parliament. Expulsion was different from disqualification, which was not the only way an MP could lose membership, he pointed out.

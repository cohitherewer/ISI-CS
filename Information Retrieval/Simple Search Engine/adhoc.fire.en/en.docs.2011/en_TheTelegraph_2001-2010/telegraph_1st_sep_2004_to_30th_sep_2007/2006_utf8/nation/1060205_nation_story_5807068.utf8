 PM prize for brainy babus

 New Delhi, Feb. 4 (PTI): The government today decided to introduce Prime Ministers awards for excellence in public administration to recognise extraordinary and innovative work done by central and state government officers.

 The contribution of officers to implementation of schemes, efficiency in public delivery system, tackling corruption and strengthening institutions would be taken into account while deciding the awards.

 Innovation in dealing with crisis, setting high standards of service and showing leadership qualities would also be assessed while selecting the winners, a PMO spokesman said.

 An expert committee chaired by the secretary (personnel) and five other members, including eminent persons from outside the government, will scrutinise applications and recommend at least 25 names to an empowered committee.

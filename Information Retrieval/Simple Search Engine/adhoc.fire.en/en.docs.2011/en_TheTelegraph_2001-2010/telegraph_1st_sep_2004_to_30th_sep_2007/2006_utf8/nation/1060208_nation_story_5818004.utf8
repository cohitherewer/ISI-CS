 Poetic licence costs teacher his job

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Hyderabad, Feb. 7: English teacher Rajeswar Rao was prepared to go to any length to see his students on top.

 Penning that to a girl student has cost him his job.

 That the 35-year-old teacher had addressed a poem to Sumalatha ? a first-year student at the engineering college where Rao taught English as a soft skill ? wasnt the problem.

 After all, Rao had been writing verses to his students, both male and female, for years. It was his way of encouraging them to strive harder for success, he said.

 So nobody thought much of it when he handed his latest offerings to class topper Prakash and Sumalatha, who had stood first among the girls, on Saturday.

 He gifted Prakash an expensive pen and a sheet of paper with two couplets written on it. To Sumalatha, he presented a diary with four couplets written inside.

 Within hours, the Vatsalya Engineering College at Nalgondas Antaram village had erupted. The students smashed furniture in the classrooms and vandalised the principals chambers, demanding Rao be sacked.

 The 800 students continued their agitation, boycotting classes and staging dharnas, till the authorities dismissed Rao on Tuesday evening.

 So what had the young teacher written?

 K. Narendra Reddy, a student leader, said the couplets were obscene and full of double entendre. It depicted the lust of the lecturer towards his wards, he said.

 The couplets, which spoke of the power of the heart, roses, fire and friendship, were replete with wordplay. It was, however, the line I want to see you at higher places?. that sealed the teachers fate.

 Principal V. Prabhakar said he had read the poems but found nothing vulgar in them. However, the management has decided to get rid of the English lecturer, who was too young to be in the profession anyway, he said.

 College chairman T. Anantharamulu was harsher: he said the management had warned the lecturer to stop writing poems to students as it could get him into trouble some day. He didnt listen to us and you have seen the results.

 Raos sack notice says his non-core activities had triggered indiscipline among the students.

 Rao, a married man with two children, alleged a conspiracy between the students and management to oust him. I dont know what got into the students this year. They wanted to get rid of me before the final exams, and they have succeeded.

 Nalgonda, an agrarian district about 100 km from Hyderabad, has a history of teacher-student romance. Several college lecturers have married their girl students in the past five years, residents said.

 We can count at least five such cases in the recent past. The romance must have begun in the classrooms, a police officer said.

 Manama, April 1 (Agencies): The number of Indians who died in Thursdays boat tragedy off the Bahrain coast has risen to 21.

 Seven of them are from Kerala, three from Tamil Nadu, two each from Andhra Pradesh, Delhi, Goa and Karnataka and one each from Bihar and Maharashtra. 

 Details about one victim were not known yet, a spokesman of the Indian embassy here said, adding that arrangements were being made to send the bodies home.

 Fifty-seven expats ? on a dinner cruise aboard the overloaded traditional wooden boat ? were killed when it capsized about a kilometre from a causeway connecting two islands. 

 Thirty Indians were among the 67 survivors who were fished out of the water as the rescue operation continued through the night. Two people are still missing.

 A group of Indians gathered at Salmaniya Hospital today, looking for the body of a relative, Abdul Wahab, a 26-year-old waiter.

 We must take him to India as soon as possible. His mother is ill and will not eat or drink before seeing the body, Mohammed Mahin, 36, said.

 Outside Bahrains intelligence office, Frank Morais waited to pay his last respects to his friends Nagbhushan Pillay, 31, and his wife Shashi Kala.

 I came to identify the bodies and pay my last respects before they are sent to India. We are surprised because if it was such a big occasion, why werent there any precautionary measures taken? Morais asked.

 The condition of three injured Indians, being treated in a government hospital here, was said to be satisfactory.

 Police are interrogating the boats Indian captain and his assistant. The captain was only a sailor and not qualified to operate the ship, prosecutor Nawaf Hamza told a news conference.

 However, Al-Wasat, a local daily, published an interview with the captain of the banoosh, naming him Captain R, in which he blamed the tour operators. He alleged that they had insisted on loading too much drinks and equipment for the corporate party being held on the boat.

 N-power tag still elusive

 New Delhi, Dec. 9: Even while offering civilian nuclear cooperation to India, the US will not recognise it as a nuclear weapons power and will keep an intrusive eye on its weapons programme. 

 Eventual limiting of Indias nuclear weapons programme is the price to be paid for securing civilian nuclear cooperation. 

 Despite the language of the Waiver Authority legislation, America may not want to eliminate Indias nuclear weapons it needs them to balance Chinas.

 The real issue is whether for a prosperous and developed India, the Indian political leadership is willing to pay the price of intrusiveness into the countrys strategic sphere.

 This is the break in strategic thinking that the Manmohan Singh government is making even if it means being less than a nuclear weapons power.

 The presidential reporting requirements to the Congress in the Waiver Authority legislation are about material non-compliance on the part of Government of India against a series of markers.

 How will the US know of the material non-compliance? Clearly through keeping an overt and covert eye on Indias activities and through end-use monitoring.

 Such monitoring and reporting include: the construction of any new nuclear facility after the date of the enactment of US legislation on cooperation; significant changes in production by India or nuclear weapons or in the types or amounts of fissile material produced changes in the purpose or operational status of any un-safeguarded (ie military) nuclear fuel cycle activities in India; and an estimate of share of electricity generated by civilian as well as military reactors.

 The aim is clear to restrict the weapons programme through close surveillance and monitoring. It is also clear that for Washington there is no nuclear weapons power outside the NPT. India will never be a nuclear weapons power on a par with the Nuclear Five.

 In its Statement of Policy, the Waiver Authority legislation states that the US will oppose the development of nuclear weapons production capability by any non-nuclear weapon state, within or outside the NPT.

 There are only four countries outside the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty India, Pakistan, Israel and North Korea. Except Israel which is believed to be an undeclared nuclear weapons power, others have declared their nuclear weapons. Clearly, it is not US policy to recognise any of them outside the NPT, including India, as nuclear weapons powers.

 India falls within a larger picture that underlies the US legislation for Asia and South Asia where it wants to achieve at the earliest possible date, a moratorium on the production of fissile material for nuclear explosive purposes by India, Pakistan and the Peoples Republic of China.

 As far as India and Pakistan are concerned, the aim is to halt the increase of nuclear weapon arsenals in South Asia and to promote their reduction and eventual elimination. 

 Eventual elimination is a goal that sounds good but no one wants to implement. For India specifically, till such time that a multilateral moratorium or a treaty on the production of fissile material is reached, the US wants it not to increase its production of fissile material at un-safeguarded (read, military) nuclear facilities.

 India would be encouraged to unilaterally identify and declare a date by which it would be willing to stop production of fissile material for nuclear weapons. 

 It is clear that this is a very different perception from the Indian governments which suggests that its military programme would be its own business. 

 In the explanatory note attached, the US Congressmen have made it clear that they see the India-US nuclear cooperation as inducing India to restrain its nuclear weapons programme.

 The US administration is expected by the Congress to encourage India to exercise utmost restraint with respect to its nuclear weapons programme, including with respect to any new reactor that would increase Indias plutonium production capability. This is as clear a statement of intent as one can get on a desire to cap Indias strategic capability.

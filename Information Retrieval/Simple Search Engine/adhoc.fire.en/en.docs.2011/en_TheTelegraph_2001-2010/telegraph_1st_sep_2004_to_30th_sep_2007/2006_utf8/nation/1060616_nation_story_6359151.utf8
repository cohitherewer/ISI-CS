The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Unity tune after 9-page rap

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 15: The Left parties yesterday sent a nine-page note to the Prime Minister, outlining their differences with the government over a range of policies.

 Today, however, when they met the UPA leadership at 7 Race Course Road, there were no signs of acrimony. The government shared the Lefts concern over the violence in Jammu and Kashmir and Assam and the spiralling prices that have hit the common man.

 Communal tension was another subject on the agenda. The Left asked the UPA to despatch a team to communally sensitive places and send a correct political message. 

 The Congress said the Left and the UPA would present a united face to combat communalism.

 The united face was, however, completely missing in the nine-page note authored by the Left. Assessing the performance of the UPA government in the last two years, the Left rapped it for not doing enough to promote communal harmony, for failing to control price rise and address serious economic problems ? issues that were discussed today.

 The Left parties have some areas of concern regarding the policies pursued by the UPA government. There are instances where the government has moved in the right direction but half-heartedly and has, therefore, fallen short of fulfilling the commitments made in the national common minimum programme, the note says.

 The Left parties had made a series of proposals for resource mobilisation but the government has not acted on them, it adds. The Left parties therefore urge the UPA government to consider resource mobilisation proposals more seriously. 

 The Left has also expressed unhappiness over the governments agrarian policy and its failure to make the public distribution system work. The note criticises the governments privatisation policies and liberalisation of the financial sector.

 The hardest punch has landed on foreign policy. The UPA governments foreign policy faces serious distortions because of the governments obsessive drive to harmonise its positions with the USs global strategies.

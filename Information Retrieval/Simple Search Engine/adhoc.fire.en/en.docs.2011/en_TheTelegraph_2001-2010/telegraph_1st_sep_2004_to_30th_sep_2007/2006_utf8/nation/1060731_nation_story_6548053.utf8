 Colombo, July 30: Sri Lanka is keen on evolving collaborative tourism packages with India for high-end tourists from the West as well as attracting more long-duration tourists from India. It also wants to refashion its image from being another sun-sea-sand destination to an island rich in heritage sites and nature and culture adventure.

 While the joint tourism package the Sri Lanka Tourist Board has in mind will include Goa and Kerala, it has not yet thought of tapping the Buddhist circuit, spanning India and Nepal, as part of an offer for culture and religious aficionados. It proposes to tap the private sector to develop the Goa-Kerala-Sri Lanka sector.

 Briefing a group of visiting Indian journalists, Udaya Namayakkara, the board chairman, said: There are large parts of our country which go beyond beaches to nature and culture adventures. Our catchline will be something like this: this is a land like no other because within a small land area, you get every kind of experience. There is the Colombo experience which we want to package and hardsell ?the concept of Colombo as the most happening city in South Asia. 

 The Sri Lankan capital has a vibrant nightlife with discos, pubs and casinos. Virtually untouched by the two-decade ethnic conflict, Colombos streets and sea-face are safe for women even after sundown.

 Namayakkara said for the last three or four years, Indians top the list of international tourists. The liberalised foreign exchange and dependence on each other is the order of the day. Sri Lanka has liberalised its aviation policy. Our airline has been encouraged to operate liberally in India. Goa is going to be added to the ports of destination.

 The only problem was, on an average, Indian tourists stayed for four or five days as compared to the 10-odd days spent by those from the West. While those from Tamil Nadu came to visit relatives and friends, the largest number of serious tourists were from Hyderabad and Bangalore ? those who chilled out over the weekend.

 But now the board is seriously thinking of drawing the obsessive travellers from two states ? Bengal and Gujarat. It plans to train its chefs to rustle up vegetarian meals sans onions and garlic for Gujarati tourists. 

 Sri Lankas tourism strategy is being recrafted to appeal to the high-end tourists as compared to the back-packers. We are positioning elements like adventure tourism, the fact that more than one-third of the island is covered with forest. Spa tourism and ayurveda are the other features we wish to sell, said Namayakkara.

 He admitted that the tsunami of 2004 impacted tourism far more devastatingly than the conflict, in excess of 60 per cent. 

 More than the collateral damage caused to the tourism infrastructure, we had to counter the perception that the whole island was submerged. Numbers reflect the fact that even in our worst years of terrorism, tourist traffic did not plummet to the extent it did post-tsunami.

 The government flew in a thousand western journalists to show the truth.

 Uma comeback on Rajnath radar

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 2: BJP president Rajnath Singh is reportedly keen to bring Uma Bharti back into the party and is working on the sadhvi through her guru, Swami Vishveshar Teertha of Udipis Pejawar Math. 

 Sources close to Rajnath said they saw more than a glimmer of hope in a recent statement from the swami in which he said Uma should rethink her decision on floating her own party. But according to PTI, Uma is meeting the Election Commission tomorrow to discuss her poll symbol because she announced she would be fielding a candidate against Sonia Gandhi from Rae Bareli.

 It is understood that rather than meet Uma himself or through an intermediary in the BJP rightaway, Rajnath is getting the spadework done by the swami and depending on her frame of mind, will engage himself later in the proposed re-induction.

 The main reason for Rajnaths overture to Uma was the BJPs poor showing in the Rajya Sabha biennial elections in Uttar Pradesh. As many as six of its MLAs cross-voted for the Bahujan Samaj Party after they were assured of safe seats in the next Assembly elections by Mayavati. These included some Rajput MLAs. 

 The question asked by the BJP was with a Rajput at the partys helm and the castes historically strong bonding with their kinsmen (Veer Bahadur Singh and V.P. Singh until Mandal happened), why did they opt for a Dalit party at the risk of being suspended or expelled from the BJP? 

 An answer that was hazarded was Rajnaths anointment made little or no difference in Uttar Pradesh, even for the Rajputs. Sources said if the Rajya Sabha polls were a barometer, the only hope the BJP had in the 2007 Assembly elections was competing for the third place with the Congress. 

 With the partys time-tested backward caste leaders such as Kalyan Singh, Om Prakash Singh and Vinay Katiyar (he just about managed to get through in the Rajya Sabha election) running out of steam, sources said Rajnath felt it was time to get Uma, a backward caste Lodh-Rajput, back and supplement its votes. Although she is not from Uttar Pradesh, her recent meetings attracted large sections of the most backward castes in Bundelkhand. 

 Sources close to Rajnath also said he was convinced that even if Uma could not pick up seats in Uttar Pradesh, she would damage the BJPs prospects like Kalyan had in the 1999 Lok Sabha elections. It was better to neutralise her, they stressed.

 However, an Uma confidant ruled out her return and maintained she would float her own outfit. He said Uma was young and had more ideological credibility than any BJP leader. This was another source of worry for Rajnath and his colleagues. BJP sources admitted there was still a lack of clarity about its political outlook after Rajnaths takeover, which was meant to signal that the RSS would have the last word on everything. 

 But the shadows of L.K. Advani and Atal Bihari Vajpayee still hovered over the BJP, the sources said. With Uma attacking these leaders and their families in a TV interview, Rajnaths blueprint to get her back may run aground, they added. Besides none of the general secretaries, including Rajnaths confidant Pramod Mahajan, had any love lost for the sadhvi.

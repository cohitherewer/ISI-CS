 Jayas out to follow politics, not pati

 Jaya, Amitabh: Different strokes

 Pratapgarh, March 5: Actor-turned-MP Jaya Bachchan today vowed never to quit politics like her superstar husband as it was destiny that has brought her this far.

 The promise came before a motley crowd in her late father-in-laws native village she was visiting for the first time, accompanied by her partys general secretary, Samajwadi Party leader Amar Singh. 

 My first experience of politics was when Amitabh contested polls from Allahabad. I had accompanied him to some of the campaigns. He quit politics later. But I can tell you now here that I wont ever do it, the Rajya Sabha MP said.

 Bachchan became an MP in 1984, winning Allahabad with a record margin, but then quit politics in the late eighties in the wake of the Bofors payoff controversy that also contributed to the fall of the Rajiv Gandhi government.

 Dressed in a pink silk sari, the bahu of Uttar Pradesh inaugurated a library in Babupatti, about 270 km from state capital Lucknow, and promised help in building a college near the village.

 The library is named after her father-in-law, the poet Harivansh Rai Bachchan who passed away three years ago.

 My father-in-law used to tell me if you think you are out to do something out of Gods will, you should not go back on that, she told the gathering, which had earlier lined up to greet her with lighted candles and blowing conch shells.

 It is God who has brought me this far, she added. Even in this village. It is destiny. And I am not going to go back.

 Five years ago, while addressing a programme organised by the Samajwadi Party in Allahabad, Bachchan had admitted that he decided to quit as he felt he was not fit to be in politics. He also apologised to the people of Allahabad for failing to keep the promises he had made.

 Today, Jaya told the villagers she had no words to express what she felt. I am feeling restless now thinking when I will be able to share this experience with Amitabh and my son Abhishek. I will tell them every bit of it when I return to Mumbai, she said.

 Jayaji is visiting the village for the first time in her life, Amar said, and then turned towards the MP. I suggest you pay another visit to the village along with Abhishek when he gets married.

 The comment sent a ripple through the crowd. So the unconfirmed reports of Abhisheks plan to marry beauty queen-turned-actor Aishwarya Rai were true?

 The question stayed in their minds, because Amar did not elaborate.

 Jaya met some distant relatives of Harivansh Rai Bachchan who still live in the village. I was searching the face of Babuji (Harivansh Rai) among the present generation of Bachchans here. It is such an emotional experience for me, she said.

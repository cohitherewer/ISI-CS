 Africa threat review

 SUJAN DUTTA

 New Delhi, Jan. 4: Army headquarters here today reviewed reports from the Ethiopia-Eritrea border in the Horn of Africa where nearly 1,600 Indian troops make up more than half the UN forces entrusted with keeping peace between the two belligerent nations.

 The review was carried out to assess threats to Indian soldiers as intrusions into a temporary security zone or no combat zone monitored by Indian troops and restrictions imposed by Eritrea threatened to wreck a fragile five-year ceasefire.

 On principle, Delhi is reluctant to pull out of UN missions not only because Indian involvement strengthens its case for a seat in the Security Council but also because assignments with the world body mean good salaries for the troops. 

 India has, however, pulled out of missions in the past ? such as in Sierra Leone in the year 2000 when 221 Indian troops and 11 military observers, who were trapped in rebel-held territory, had to be rescued.

 Sources in army headquarters said the continuance of the Indian troops in the UN mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea peacekeeping force depended on the decision of the Security Council. The decision is expected on January 6 with a possible change in its mandate and authorisation of peace enforcement.

 The headquarters of the Indian battalion group (Indbatt) is in Ethiopia but the troops are in Eritrea. One option being explored is to pull out all the troops from Eritrea and post them inside Ethiopia along the border.

 The UN force on the 1,000-km border is commanded by Major General Rajender Singh and an Indian battalion group of infantry troops (of the 13 Jammu and Kashmir Rifles), engineers and logistics personnel of 1,600 is led by Colonel S.V. Bhaskar.

 The Indbatt was rotated last month and 13 Jammu and Kashmir Rifles replaced troops from the Kumaon Regiment.

 Army sources said today that concern was expressed not only because Eritrea had imposed restrictions on the operations of the peacekeeping force but also because there were some intrusions into the no combat zone along the border by militia.

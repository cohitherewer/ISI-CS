 Delhi lines up checks on tapping

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 3: To curb illegal tapping of phones, including mobiles, the Centre plans to plug the holes in the Indian Telegraph Act.

 One of the measures could be a central agency for phone-tapping, like those in some foreign countries, Union home ministry sources said.

 The agency, if set up, will coordinate between operators and security agencies and absolute secrecy will be maintained about the numbers tapped.

 This and several other steps were discussed today at a meeting between the Union home ministry, cellular operators and senior officials from other government departments.

 The government told the private operators that they had upgraded their technology; now they must put a monitoring mechanism in place. The ministry also conveyed its concerns over broadband. The operators were asked to check the backgrounds of lower-level staff and keep records.

 Cellular Operators Association of India director-general T.V. Ramachandran said the meeting went off well.

 Ministry sources said the suggestions to fine-tune the telegraph acts provisions are almost ready and will soon be placed before the cabinet.

 The meeting was attended by home secretary V.K. Duggal, telecom secretary J.S. Sarma, IB director E.S.L. Narasimhan, Delhi police commissioner K.K. Paul and senior executives of all telecom service providers.

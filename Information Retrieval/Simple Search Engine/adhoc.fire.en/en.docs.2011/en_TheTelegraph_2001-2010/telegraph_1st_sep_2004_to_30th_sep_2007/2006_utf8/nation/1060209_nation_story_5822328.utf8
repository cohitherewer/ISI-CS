The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Abuse slur on airport senior

 SANJAY MANDAL

 Calcutta, Feb. 8: An employee at Calcutta airport has lodged a complaint of sexual harassment against a senior official of her department.

 The woman, an assistant manager with the Airports Authority of Indias (AAI) finance wing at Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport, has alleged that an additional general manager of the AAI has been harassing her since the early nineties.

 A complaint has been lodged and we are inquiring into it, said Vageesh Mishra, the inspector-general of police (south Bengal range). 

 The woman has also written to the civil aviation minister, the chairman of the AAI and the National Commission for Women in Delhi, and its Bengal counterpart in Calcutta, about her plight.

 According to her complaint, the woman had joined the airport as a junior clerk in 1988 and was transferred to the finance wing in 1990. 

 Initially, my service life was peaceful. But trouble started since 1993 when the AGM joined, she said. 

 For one year, he maintained a low profile but after that started making indecent proposals.

 The woman said that when she did not respond to his overtures, he started making use of his official power to break my mental resistance. 

 The woman alleged that the AGM had made adverse remarks in her annual confidential report without bothering to maintain official guidelines. 

 She said he did not issue written warnings, which are mandatory. 

 After his transfer to Guwahati in 1996, I became free from mental stress and frustration, she said. 

 But he came back to Calcutta in April 2001. Although aware that my marriage to a colleague had been registered in 1999, he continued his old practice of putting pressure on me.

 She alleged that he issued a memo against her as well, but it was later proved baseless. 

 Since I come from a conservative family, I did not want to go for any showdown. A deep-rooted fear of official and social humiliation? prevented me from taking any stern action, she said.

 Last year, she mustered enough courage and lodged her first complaint with the AAI and the womens commission. 

 But she was called by a senior official of the finance department and asked to withdraw the charges. 

 After her police complaint today, she alleged that she was summoned by the official again and threatened with dire consequences if she did not listen to him. 

 The AGM has dismissed the charges as false. I am being framed, he said. 

 She never did her duty properly and would come to office at will. I tried to enforce discipline, he added.

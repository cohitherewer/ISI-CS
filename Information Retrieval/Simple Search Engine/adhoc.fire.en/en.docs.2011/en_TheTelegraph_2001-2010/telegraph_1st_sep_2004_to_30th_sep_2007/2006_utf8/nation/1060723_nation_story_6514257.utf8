 Education bill buried

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 22: Four years after education was made a fundamental right, the Centre has quietly junked a planned bill aimed to make the right a reality with even key allies not aware of the move.

 CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury recently expressed surprise when he was told the government had passed the buck to the states. We dont know about this. Education is a priority area for us, Yechury said.

 The bill was to provide for free and compulsory education to all children between 6 and 14. Last month, the human resource development ministry dropped plans to table it in Parliament and, instead, sent a diluted version to the states, asking them to adopt it.

 The states are reluctant for two reasons. One, not all of them have elementary education on their main agenda. Two, unlike the junked bill that bound the Centre to foot the entire bill for implementing the provisions, the latest version provides for a 50:50 split.

 The non-government Peoples Campaign for Common School System has threatened to hit the streets in protest, hoping the political parties, too, would respond inside and outside Parliament.

 People from 12 states will hold a demonstration and a dharna on July 24, the day the monsoon session of Parliament begins, said Ambarish Rai, its convener.

 Well talk to political parties and send a letter to the Prime Minister, said another member, former foreign secretary Muchkund Dubey.

 It was the NDA government that had paved the way for the education bill by getting the 86th Constitutional Amendment Bill, which makes education a fundamental right, through Parliament.

 The HRD ministry, then headed by Murli Manohar Joshi, had drawn up an enabling bill to implement the right, but the Vajpayee government lost the May 2004 elections and the bill remained on paper.

 The UPA government set up the Central Advisory Board of Education (Cabe), which revised the bill and sent it to a committee headed by Union minister Kapil Sibal for further consideration.

 But the Planning Commission and the finance ministry dealt a death blow to the planned bill, pleading lack of funds.

 The model bill sent to the states does away with many of the stringent provisions of the Cabe version, such as punishment for those who hire child workers and prevent them from going to school. It also ignores Cabe-suggested norms for hiring of schoolteachers to improve education quality.

 Had the Centre got the bill passed in Parliament, it still could not have forced the states to adopt it since education is on the concurrent list. But it would have given the fundamental right some legal teeth.

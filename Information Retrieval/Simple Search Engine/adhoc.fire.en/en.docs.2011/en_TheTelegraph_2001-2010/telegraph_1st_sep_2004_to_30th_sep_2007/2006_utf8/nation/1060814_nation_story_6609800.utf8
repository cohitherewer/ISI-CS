 Royal battle that rivals any film plot

 CHARU SUDAN KASTURI

 (Top)Aishwarya Rai, Rajmata Gayatri Devi: Reel and real? 

 New Delhi, Aug. 13: She was once considered among the most beautiful women in the world. Today, a film is being made on her.

 At 85, Rajmata Gayatri Devi could have sat back in peace as her mind strolled down the years. Instead, she is locked in a fight that has distanced herself from her own grandchildren.

 The family of the late Maharaja Sawai Man Singh of Jaipur is now divided by a legal battle that has the veneer of a property dispute, though sources say it could just as well be about royal titles.

 The fight is over who owns the familys lavish palaces and sprawling gardens. Central to the dispute is the famous Jai Mahal Palace, said to be worth over Rs 1,000 crore. Traditionally owned by the Maharaja of Jaipur, it is now a heritage hotel.

 So even as J.P. Dutta of Border fame makes a movie on the Rajmata that reportedly stars Aishwarya Rai, she faces the charge of her former daughter-in-law, Thai Princess Rajawongse Priyanandana Rangsit.

 Priyanandana was married to Jagat Singh, the last king of Jaipur and Gayatri Devis youngest son, who died in 1997. The two had divorced in 1985 after a seven-year marriage.

 Jagat owned 99 per cent shares in Jai Mahal Pvt. Ltd. His half-brother Prithviraj (Pat to friends) owned the remaining 1 per cent.

 In an email to The Telegraph, the princess said: We learnt last year that Jagat Singhs estates shares had been diluted to 7 per cent (by issuing thousands of new shares). We had to do something to safeguard the childrens legal rights to inherit their fathers properties.

 It was then, the 51-year-old says, that she, along with her children, 25-year-old Devraj and 27-year-old Lalitya, filed a case against Pat with the company law board.

 The Rajmatas advocate, Anoop Parikh says the number of shares were increased with no other intention but to bring in funds for the hotel.

 The Rajmata, now on vacation in London, could not be contacted.

 Priyanandanas counsel Dalip Kumar Malhotra says according to the Hindu Succession Act, other property that Jagat ruled over said to be valued over Rs 5,000 crore such as Jaipurs Rambagh Palace, should also go to Devraj.

 Sources close to the Rajmatas family, however, say such battles are often fought over titles.

 Priyanandana, once a queen, would become Rajmata, a coveted title, if Devraj gets the property. The current Rajmata, they say, would then lose her title. The royalty are more concerned about their titles than property, says a source.

 In 1998, the Rajmata and Jagats two children made an admission before a Jaipur court saying the property would be divided into three parts. As Devraj and Lalitya were then minors, Prithviraj became custodian of their property. The Rajmata also asked him to take care of her share.

 The Rajmata and Prithviraj have now appealed to the court saying they want to withdraw that admission on the basis of a recently discovered will that awards the Rajmata all of Jagats property.

 A close friend of Jagat is the one who told us to search for a will in his papers, Parikh says.

 The Rajmata, her legal aides say, has also made several unsuccessful overtures to the princess (Priyanandana) to settle the matter amicably.

 Priyanandana, who believes the will is a fake, says Jagat would never have taken such a drastic step that would disinherit his children.

 The children should not be made to suffer because she (the Rajmata) dislikes the mother, she says.

 Holes in study scheme success story

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 18: Sarva Siksha Abhiyan the Centres flagship programme to universalise elementary education is not doing as well as the government would like us to believe.

 A report released by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India today picked holes in almost all the main components of the programme. The report was tabled in Parliament. 

 The main objective to have all the children in the 6-14 age group in schools, formal or informal, first by 2003 and then 2005 has failed. 

 Out of 3.4 crore children (as on April 1, 2001), 1.36 crore (40 per cent) children in the 6-14 age group remained out of school on March 2005, the report said. This is after four years of implementation of the scheme and after incurring an expenditure of Rs 11,133.57 crore.

 The report endorses the viewpoint expressed by some educationists and non-government organisations that the programme needs proper monitoring and supervision. The critics have questioned the governments claims of 93 per cent enrolment in schools.

 The human resource development ministry, the nodal implementing agency, has come in for criticism as have the state governments. The budget calendar for financial management and procurement has not been implemented by the ministry, which resulted in delay in finalisation of the annual work plan and budget of the states and release of grants, the report said.

 State governments have been found guilty of diverting funds. The audits in 11 states, including Bengal, Bihar, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh, have found they have been regularly diverting funds to activities and schemes outside the programme. The diversions have added up to a total of Rs 99.88 crore that has been spent on items not permitted under the SSA.

 Bengal has diverted Rs 18.13 crore between 2001 and 2005. It has spent the money on uniforms for girls in primary schools, purchase of crockery and utensils for mid-day meals, purchase of computers, typewriters, xerox and fax machines, mobile phones and repair of a bungalow. 

 The report quoted the HRD ministry as saying the funds were utilised for activities with the aim of universalisation of elementary education in the state. The reply is not tenable, the CAG said.

 Rural schools were suffering from want of teachers. 75,884 primary schools in 15 states and Union territories were functioning with one teacher. 6,647 schools in seven states were without a single teacher, the report added. 

 The position was alarming in the states of West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Himachal Pradesh, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh.

 Bengals record in girls education also leaves much to be desired. Rs 1.38 crore was used out of a budget provision of Rs 10.27 crore during 2002-05 for increasing enrolment and retention of girl students, the CAG report said. 

 A large number of schools in most states and Union territories are functioning without buildings. Other infrastructural facilities like drinking water, toilets separate ones for girls and electricity were not available.

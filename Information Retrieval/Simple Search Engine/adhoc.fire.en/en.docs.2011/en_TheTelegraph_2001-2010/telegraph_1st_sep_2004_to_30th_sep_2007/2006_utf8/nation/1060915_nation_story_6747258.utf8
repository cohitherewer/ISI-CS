 Sacked MPs can contest, says govt

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 14: The 11 members expelled from Parliament over the cash-for-questions scam can seek re-election, the Centre today told the Supreme Court.

 Expulsion does not bar re-election. It is merely regulatory in nature, senior counsel for the government, T.R. Andhyarujina, said. 

 Expulsions assure the public that those who have abused their office would not be tolerated and instil faith and confidence in representative legislatures, he said.

 Andhyarujina recalled how Jawaharlal Nehru had insisted on the expulsion of Congress MP H.G. Mudgal, who had been accused of receiving money in return for asking questions.

 He said no malice or motives could be attributed to Parliament. No member of either House has disputed the findings of misconduct.

 The expelled MPs had earlier argued that as decisions in Parliament were politically motivated, it could not be given the power to expel lawfully-elected members.

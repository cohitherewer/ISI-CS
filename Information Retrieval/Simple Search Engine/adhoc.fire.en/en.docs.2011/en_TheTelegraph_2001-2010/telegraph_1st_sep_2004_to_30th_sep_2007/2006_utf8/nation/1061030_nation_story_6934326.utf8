 Den of Indian super-rich

 London, Oct. 29 (PTI): All roads for Britains new class of super-rich Indians lead to Northwood, a quiet west London suburb that is being transformed into the countrys first millionaires row for a single ethnic minority Indians.

 Homes worth more than 1,000,000 on Astons Road are being snapped up and then demolished to make way for mansions worth up to 5,000,000, complete with indoor pools, sweeping marble staircases and extravagant landscaped gardens, the Sunday Times reported.

 The popularity of the Astons is such that the mention of the roads name is thought to be enough to impress both potential business partners and brides-to-be.

 According to locals, nine out of 10 new buyers on Astons Road are Indians, eager to take advantage of the areas respected private schools and some of the best golf courses along the motorway.

 Just about two decades ago, their parents were living in dilapidated flats in nearby Southall but the new generation has moved out to leafier areas such as Moor Park, the part of Northwood where Astons Road is situated, the report said.

 Keith Vaz, chairman of the national ethnic minority task force and MP for Leicester East, said: What the Moor Park community shows us is the real nature of what happens to first generation immigration.

 The stereotype view, that they are dependent on the state, is proved to be a myth because they have shown through hard work, dedication and enterprise that they are first-class contributors to our country, he said.

 The report also details some immigrants who made it rich.

 Satish Ruparelia, 54, made his fortune by importing cappuccino machines from Italy and bought a 2,000,000 home in Moor Park. His home includes a large prayer room, complete with hand-crafted marble Hindu gods imported from Jaipur in Rajasthan.

 My father came here with 50 in his pocket. He was born in India and then thrown out of Uganda during Idi Amins Africanisation programme, he said.

 In 1972, I came to England as well and got by on 29 a month that my father was sending through. I was a paying guest in Finsbury Park. I had a very basic box room.

 Kulwinder Dhadwal, 42, a management consultant and property developer, looking at homes on Astons Road, said: The Indian community is still fairly conservative about displaying their wealth, but now there is a desire more and more to show the fruits of their hard work.

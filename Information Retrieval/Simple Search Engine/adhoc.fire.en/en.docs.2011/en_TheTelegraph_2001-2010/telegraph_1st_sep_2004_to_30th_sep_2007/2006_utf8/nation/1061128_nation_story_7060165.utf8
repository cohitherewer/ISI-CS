 Rage after rally on royal turf

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Digvijay Singh, Sachin 

 Pilot 

 Bhopal, Nov. 27: Digvijay Singh and Sachin Pilot are busy trying to revive the Congress in Madhya Pradesh, but the unauthorised entry into the royal fief has invited the state party units wrath.

 The two held a rally today in Morena town, which is surrounded by the dacoit-infested Chambal ravines. Digvijay said he had come to strengthen the party and instil confidence among people living under the shadow of the dreaded bandit, Rambabu Gadaria.

 While Digvijay and Pilot addressed a substantial crowd, Congress leaders loyal to Jyotiraditya Scindia, the royal scion, squirmed.

 Sobran Singh Mawai, the vice-president of the Madhya Pradesh Congress Committee, has written to party chief Sonia Gandhi to dissuade Digvijay from holding such an improper convention as it did not have the MPCCs sanction.

 Pilots presence may have given Jyotiraditya, the MP from Guna, a headache. Digvijay had brought him along to woo the influential Gujjar community. 

 Pilot, considered a challenger to Jyotiraditya among the band of young Congress leaders, was an instant hit when he spoke about taking revenge on Gadaria. 

 Traditionally, the Scindias have considered the Gwalior-Chambal region their fief and resented any unauthorised entry of party leaders. Today, Morena was dotted with Congress flags, posters and banners, but there was not even a mention of Jyotiraditya. 

 State Congress officials complained that they were often clueless about programmes organised by regional party satraps like Digvijay and Kamal Nath. Recently, MPCC chief Subhash Yadav had written to party general secretary in charge of the state, V. Narayanswamy, to ensure that all meetings are organised under the aegis of the state Congress unit. 

 Sources close to Yadav said he was merely trying to invoke a sense of discipline instead of discouraging party stalwarts.

 Yadavs detractors countered the argument, saying senior leaders were acting on their own after the MPCC failed to chalk out effective programmes and political agitations.

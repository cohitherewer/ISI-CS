 School bags taken to court

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 HEAVY WEIGHT OF LEARNING

 New Delhi, Aug. 3: A public trust has moved the Supreme Court for a directive to the government to protect the human rights of children by reducing the weight of school bags.

 Awaz, which safeguards the rights of citizens and ventilates their grievances, said heavy school bags some weighing around 10 kg were a common phenomenon across the country and had to be done away with to check risk of injury to children.

 In a petition, it said medical findings highlighted by the media had suggested that children were growing up with a huge risk to their backs but the government was not doing anything to change things.

 Awaz said several parents had approached it to take up the cause of their children. Many said their children began having back pain from a tender age. 

 Advocate Mayur Shah, who filed the petition, said parents had complained that their children hit the bed soon after returning from school.

 The trust suggested measures to reduce the weight of school bags without compromising on educational needs. It said children could be asked to carry loose sheets of paper instead of an exercise book for each subject. A file for each subject could be maintained at home and the sheets filed daily.

 In case of voluntary subjects like drawing, computers and environment studies, books should be made available at the school itself, the petition said. Two or three students could be made to share a book.

 Told about the PIL, the principal of Sardar Patel School said children up to Class I did not carry any bag. She said the school had been working on the problem and had taken steps to ease it.

 She said every school would have to frame its own regulations and there could be some schools where the problem exists.

 But this is not a problem in our school, she said.

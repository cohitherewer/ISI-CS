 Judges gesture to acid victim

 New 

 Delhi, Nov. 12 (PTI): Shocked on seeing the disfigured 

 face of an acid attack victim, a judge has exempted the 

 girl from any further appearance in court.

 Renu, 20, had appeared before the additional sessions judge, Reena Singh Nag, to record her statement against a youth who had allegedly thrown acid on her face.

 Moments after she entered the court room, Nag asked Renu to show her injuries. When she lifted her veil, everyone was horrified the girl had been left defaced and had lost her eyes.

 Nag said Renu would not be asked to appear in court again and that all proceedings relating to her would be completed in a day. The defence would not be given another opportunity to cross-examine her.

 The court recorded Renus statement in which she said the accused, Yesh Pal, a resident of Meerut, had been living in her Ashok Nagar residence in east Delhi as a paying guest.

 She said Pal became angry after her father asked him to leave last year. The accused then poured acid on her and ran away, she said.

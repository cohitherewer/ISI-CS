 Quota rage spills over on Tata evening of honour

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Ratan Tata

 Mumbai, May 9: Angry slogans were probably the last thing Ratan Tata expected as he walked up to the stage to accept Maharashtras highest civilian award.

 But the half a dozen young men and women had been waiting for this moment.

 They were on their feet as the industrialist got up to receive the Maharashtra Bhushan award from governor S.M. Krishna this evening. Down with Tata, Go back Tata, they cried as the Tata Sons chairman looked on.

 The youths, who looked like students, were protesting against Tata for opposing reservations in the private sector and said he had refused to meet them for a discussion on the subject.

 At a seminar last month, Tata had said the governments plan to raise the overall reservation package in central educational institutions to 49.5 per cent would have a disintegrating impact on India.

 The protest, however, did not disrupt the function in central Mumbai as police whisked the youths away. Police sources later said they were from the Republican Party of India, a Dalit outfit. 

 A spokesperson for the Tata Group described the protest as a cheap stunt. His (Tatas) office has not received any kind of communication seeking an appointment from any pro-reservation group. He has not spoken about reservations in the educational sector. He has spoken in general terms about the impact of reservation in the private sector, the spokesperson added.

 The Tata Group refused to react officially to the incident. Most of the corporate world has taken a strong stand against reservations in the private sector. A CII delegation, which met the Prime Minister last month, had conveyed the resentment.

 Tata was conferred the honour in recognition of his contribution to the states development. Past recipients of the honour include singer Lata Mangeshkar and cricketers Sunil Gavaskar and Sachin Tendulkar.

 In his acceptance speech, Tata called for bridging the urban-rural divide. There are two faces of the country. One is of prosperity which is in urban areas and the other is of hardship and poverty which is seen in rural areas, he said. We have to make efforts to bring these two faces together and ensure the prosperity of the country.

 Tata lauded the social commitment of Maharashtrians. I am a Maharashtrian who does not speak Marathi, he added.

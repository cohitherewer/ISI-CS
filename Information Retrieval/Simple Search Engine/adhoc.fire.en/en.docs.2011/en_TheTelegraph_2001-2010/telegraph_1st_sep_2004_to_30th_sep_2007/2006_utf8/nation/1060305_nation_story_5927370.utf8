 Ajits minister puts in papers

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, March 4: The Mulayam Singh Yadav government today lost its fourth minister in a week, with the Rashtriya Lok Dals Munna Singh Chauhan handing in his papers to the governor in a surprise move.

 On the face of it, the irrigation ministers decision has nothing to do with the uncertainty over the status of the 40 breakaway Bahujan Samaj Party MLAs, five of whom ? including three ministers ?have returned to their old party.

 But Chauhans move has thickened the plot amid whispers that the RLD, an ally of the Samajwadi Party, has been inching closer to the Congress ever since the controversy over the 40 defectors threw state politics into a turmoil.

 Chauhan or his party gave no reasons for his resignation, but sources said he had fallen out with some of his RLD colleagues for repeatedly shooting off his mouth on the water dispute between Delhi and Uttar Pradesh.

 The irrigation minister has been publicly echoing Mulayams stand in the dispute with Delhis Congress government, apparently annoying his party boss Ajit Singh and his loyalists. Recently, RLD leader Anuradha Chaudhary, who is close to Ajit, is believed to have told Chauhan to pipe down, prompting the minister to complain to the party chief.

 With Ajit reluctant to step in on his behalf, a hurt Chauhan has stepped down, sources said.

 Raj Bhavan officials confirmed that the resignation has been accepted. RLD sources said Meerut MLA Merajuddin would replace him, but added that Ajit had got in touch with Chauhan and patch-up efforts were on.

 The three ministers who quit earlier are Jaiveer Singh, Surendra Vikram Singh and Dharam Pal Singh. Another breakaway BSP member, Ram Kishan, who was chairman of the Uttar Pradesh Development System Corporation with ministerial rank, resigned yesterday.

 New Delhi, March 21: Bangladesh Prime Minister Khaleda Zia did not face any hard questions when she met Manmohan Singh today.

 At a banquet hosted for her, Singh summarised Delhis intent by quoting Kazi Nazrul: Ushar duware hani aghat, amra anibo ranga prabhat, amra ghuchabo timiro raat, badhar bindhachal (Striking at the door of dawn, we will usher in a new morning, we will overcome the dark night and the mountains of obstacles).

 Instead of blaming each other for not doing enough, at the two-hour meeting between Singh and Khaleda, both sides recognised they were victims of terrorism and decided to join hands to tackle the spread of militant groups.

 Concerns about Bangladesh turning into a safe haven for terrorist groups were conveyed and the issue of illegal migration was taken up. They are aware of our concerns. There was a very constructive exchange of views?. India and Bangladesh are both victims of terrorism?. Terrorism by its very nature is a kind of phenomenon which can be best tackled by joint cooperation, external affairs spokesperson Navtej Sarna said. 

 Much of the talks focused on trade and economy. Delhi and Dhaka signed two pacts ? a revised trade agreement and another to check trafficking of narcotics. They also decided to open a train link between Sealdah and Joydebpur. 

 The two sides decided to hold more regular meetings to address disputes on security and water-sharing. Sources said Khaleda had sought the visit as it has political implications in an election year. She asked for trade concessions, including reducing tariff barriers to Bangladeshi products.

 Dhaka was willing to consider the Tatas $2.5-billion investment plan for Bangladesh, but sought some clarifications. Delhi was keen to increase investments in Bangladesh to correct the trade imbalance. 

 Both sides would make mutually beneficial arrangements for the use of their waterways, roadways and railways for commerce, the trade agreement said. 

 The issue of trade imbalance will be settled at the joint economic commission that would meet soon, Bangladesh foreign secretary Hemayetuddin said. 

 Our dialogue was most useful in understanding each others point of view and in making progress on various issues, Singh said.

 Khaleda added: We owe it to ourselves to do our best to narrow down? differences.

 Honda panel tenure

 Chandigarh, July 22: The term of the Justice G.C. Garg panel, set up to probe last years police lathicharge on striking workers of Honda Motorcycles and Scooters, has been extended again.

 The commission has sought extension till December this year and we have asked it to submit its report by then, Haryana chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda said.

 The panel was to file its report within three months of the July 25 incident in Gurgaon when unarmed workers protesting against the suspension of their colleagues were lathi-charged. 

 The panel, which is operating from Chandigarh, held its first three hearings with workers in January. But the workers say it is unfeasible to expect them to travel to Chandigarh for hearings.

 Apart from probing police excesses, the commission is also looking into allegations that outsiders had joined the protesting workers and incited them to turn violent.

 Fashion teacher in vulgar SMS row

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Mohali, Dec. 14: Students of the Northern India Institute for Fashion Technology took to the streets here today, demanding that a faculty member who allegedly sent some girls objectionable and vulgar text messages be sacked. 

 The scandal broke after a student showed the messages to others at the institute. Some girls in the third semester have been receiving vulgar and objectionable messages on their cellphones from K. Krishnamurthy. We ignored them initially. But he kept sending them. We informed the authorities on Monday, but no action was taken. We had no option but to stage a protest against his behaviour, said Anshu Yadav.

 Krishnamurthy was suspended after the complaints surfaced. He has also been accused of taking classes in a drunken state. The students alleged that they also faced constant physical harassment from him. 

 Krishnamurthy, however, called the allegations a conspiracy hatched by the girls who failed in their exams and had to spend an extra year. 

 He claimed he had messages that some students sent him. They are similar in nature, he said. He appeared to suggest that these were also vulgar.

 This is not true. Our exams are being held at the moment. Why should we try to jeopardise our careers at this moment? We had heard that he sent messages to a girl in the second semester. When the matter was taken up, Krishnamurthy was removed from the class, a student said. 

 The Mohali police have registered a case against Krishnamurthy and questioned some of the girls, but that has hardly cooled tempers at the institute. 

 We will not rest till Krishnamurthy is sacked. He has two daughters. He should have thought about them, a student said.

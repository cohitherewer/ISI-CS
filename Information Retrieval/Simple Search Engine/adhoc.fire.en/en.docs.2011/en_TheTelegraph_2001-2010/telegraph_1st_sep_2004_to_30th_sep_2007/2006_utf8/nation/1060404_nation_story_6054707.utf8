 Absent pontiff in court glare

Chennai (PTI): A sessions court issued a bailable warrant 

against Kanchi seer Jayendra Saraswati after he failed to appear before it on 

Monday in connection with the Radhakrishnan assault case. 

 The court, however, stayed the warrant for a day after the seers counsel, K.S. Dinakaran, sought time for the pontiff to appear before it on Tuesday. 

 The court had earlier rejected a plea to allow the seer not to appear before it on Monday on the ground that he would be performing a puja. Mutt manager Sundaresa Iyer, however, was excused because of illness. 

 Besides the seer, Iyer and nine others, including Raghu, the younger brother of junior acharya Vijayendra Saraswati, are accused in the case of alleged assault on former mutt aide Radhakrishnan, his wife and an attendant in September 2002.

 Nudge to fill up judge slots

New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Monday directed all states, 

Union territories and high courts to provide within three months a yearly time 

schedule for filling up vacancies of judges in subordinate courts, reports our 

legal correspondent.

 It is absolutely necessary to evolve a mechanism to speedily determine and fill vacancies of judges at all levels, a bench comprising Chief Justice Y.K. Sabharwal and Justice C.K. Thakker said while seeking details from state governments and high courts.

 The apex court said that the high number of vacancies in trial courts was as one of the main reasons behind huge pendency of cases in the country. Not filling up the vacancies for a long time deprives people of the services of judicial officers, the court said.

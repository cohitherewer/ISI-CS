 Bipasha bats for ambitious women

 Mumbai, June 22 (Agencies): Bipasha Basu, who plays a high-flying executive in the film Corporate, said ambitious women are often misunderstood.

 It is very sad that an ambitious woman is looked down upon, while if a man is seen to be ambitious, it is appreciated. We can never accept that a woman can come up in life purely on her talent, the actress (in picture) said.

 Susmita Chakraborthy, the Indian Army lieutenant who committed suicide last week, was one such ambitious 25-year-old. Her parents said she had been depressed about the girlie jobs allotted to her.

 I come from a family where there was no son, and all three sisters were encouraged to go out on their own. That is why I do not understand this attitude where after a girl turns 25, alarm bells start going off and she gets married and has kids, no matter how well her career is poised, Bipasha said.

 She said acting in Madhur Bhandarkars film had given her a better understanding of working women in India. 

 Bipasha, who is part of an ensemble cast of 45 characters, said it was a challenge to enact a role different from most of her other characters, but admits she did not do any research on it. I just played it according to my perception of what a woman working in the corporate world would be like, and Madhur, my designer Rocky S and I conceived the role together.

 I see some heroines, who keep saying that their roles are glamorous, and think its so cheesy. Glamour doesnt depend on what you wear or what you dont wear and how much make-up you put on. Its an attitude that you have.

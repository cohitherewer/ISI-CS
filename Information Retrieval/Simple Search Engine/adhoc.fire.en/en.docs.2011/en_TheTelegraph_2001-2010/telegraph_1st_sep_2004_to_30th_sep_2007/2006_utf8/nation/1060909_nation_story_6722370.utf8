 New Delhi, Sept. 8: The countrys largest university went to the polls today in the middle of a nation-wide debate on the need for student elections.

 The debate, fanned by recent student violence especially the death of Professor H.S. Sabharwal in Ujjain has hardly changed anything at Delhi University, though.

 For the past three weeks, campaigners have gone about their business as usual, selling candidates and flouting rules.

 The university prides itself on having an electoral code of conduct and strictures such as an age bar for candidates, both still elusive for most Indian universities.

 The authorities, however, say they are unable to check the violations of the code of conduct without help from the students themselves.

 The code says: There should be no posters (including stickers), hoardings or wall-writing. But posters continue to deface walls in many colleges and on the main university campus, apart from adorning the jeeps used for canvassing.

 We removed a few (posters) for election day from the more prominent areas. The rest are still up, admitted Aditya Sinha of the Congress-backed National Students Union of India.

 Sinha, standing at a polling booth on the main campus and urging students to vote for his candidate, was also quick to point out the posters of the BJP student wing, Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad.

 Next on the guidelines is the ban on loudspeakers on campus. For the past week, more and more vehicles with loudspeakers have been coming to the campus. Some even come at night, disturbing our sleep, said Anish Ghosh, a political science MPhil student.

 The guidelines say a candidate can use at most two vehicles for campaigning, yet some 20 ABVP jeeps were whizzing around the main campus today. Four posts are up for grabs, so each student wing shouldnt have more than eight vehicles in use.

 Why are you bringing these matters up? Go to the individual colleges (which, too, house polling booths) and you will see hundreds of such jeeps, yaar, said the ABVPs Arvind Rajpal.

 What about the limit on poll expenses Rs 10,000 per candidate? 

 With booze binges, late-night feasts and free screenings of Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna and Lagey Raho Munnabhai in return for votes, the campaigners admit the limit is unrealistic.

 Anything between Rs 2 lakh and Rs 3 lakh is spent per candidate, a candidate told The Telegraph on condition that his identity or his unions are not revealed.

 No outside student can enter the college or university campuses for electioneering, the code says.

 This hasnt stopped NSUI or ABVP leaders from other universities, such as JNU and Jamia. They came today, too.

 University authorities said they would investigate the violations but hinted they were helpless to stop them. There needs to be greater participation from the student community to check these violations, said a faxed message from the registrars office.

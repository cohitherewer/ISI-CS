 SC clears property sale air

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 16: Criminal proceedings cannot be initiated against a person going back on an oral agreement to sell his house or property, the Supreme Court has held.

 A bench of Justices Ashok Bhan and Lokeshwar Panta clarified that a dispute relating to sale or purchase of land between two parties is of civil nature and does not fall under a case of cheating or criminal breach of trust under the Indian Penal Code.

 Going back on an agreement to sell merely creates a civil liability unless it is specifically proved that the owner acted with an intention to deceive the other party.

 The order was passed by the bench while quashing criminal proceedings against a 70-year-old woman at Gaya in Bihar.

 Allowing an appeal by Ram Biraji Devi, the apex court set aside a Patna High Court order refusing to quash the order of a magistrate taking cognisance of the case.

 One Umesh Kumar Singh had alleged that he had paid Rs 80,000 to Ram Biraji who had orally agreed to sell her plot of land in the Gaya Housing Board Colony for Rs 4 lakh. Singh claimed she later refused to execute a written agreement and even denied having received Rs 80,000 from him.

 He, thereafter, filed a criminal case before the magistrate who took cognisance of the offences alleged and issued summons against the accused.

 The apex court noted that even if the allegations are accepted to be correct, no criminal case is made out against the accused. Neither could any guilty intention be attributed nor could there possibly be any intention on her part to deceive him, the court pointed out.

 The Supreme Court noted that proceedings for trial of the appellant for cheating and other offences was an abuse of the process of court and, hence, interference was expedient in the interest of justice.

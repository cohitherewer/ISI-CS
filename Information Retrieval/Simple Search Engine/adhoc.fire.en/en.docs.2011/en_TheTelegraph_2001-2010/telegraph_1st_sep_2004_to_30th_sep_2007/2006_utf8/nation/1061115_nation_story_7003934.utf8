 Creamy layer war hots up

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 14: The Centre has decided to seek the attorney-generals opinion on the Supreme Courts observation that the creamy layer concept should be applied to scheduled castes and scheduled tribes, law minister H.R. Bhardwaj said today.

 The court had recently said the creamy layer among Dalits should be excluded while implementing reservation for scheduled castes and tribes in government jobs.

 The decision to take the attorney-generals opinion came at a meeting of the group of ministers (GoM) on Dalit affairs, of which Bhardwaj is a member.

 Earlier, a bill on reservation for SC/STs and OBCs in government jobs was sent to a standing committee of Parliament. The committee said there should be no creamy layer concept for Dalits and tribals.

 There is a lot of difference between a creamy layer for the OBCs and one for the SC/STs. For the latter, reservations and other rights have been given purely on a social basis and not in economic terms. It is a constitutional requirement, said Union minister P.R. Kyndiah, a member of the committee.

 The GoM will meet again this week after the attorney-general gives his opinion.

 While political wisdom goes against the introduction of a creamy layer for Dalits and tribals, sources said the Centre must be careful to ensure that whatever bill is codified stands to legal scrutiny.

 The government is under pressure from OBC MPs across party lines not to exclude the creamy layer among OBCs during recruitment and promotions.

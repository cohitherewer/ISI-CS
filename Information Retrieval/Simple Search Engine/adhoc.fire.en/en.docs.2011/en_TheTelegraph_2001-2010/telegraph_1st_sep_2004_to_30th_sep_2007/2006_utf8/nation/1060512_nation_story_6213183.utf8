The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Buddha has muscle, wont flex it

In an exclusive interview to STAR Ananda after 

the results, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee says the people have voted 

for development. Excerpts:

STAR Ananda: Is this a mandate for development?

Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee: Yes, of course. People of 

the state want development in industry and agriculture. There is a feeling among 

the general public that the Left Front is working for development of the state, 

and that is precisely what we wanted to achieve. Now that we have got the mandate, 

we are not going to let the people down.

S A: Do you think 

that this landslide victory has put the Left Front under tremendous pressure because 

of the expectation of the general people?

BB: Yes, I agree 

with you. At this stage, people want results. They want to see development and 

they want employment opportunities being generated.

S A: Do you see 

the victory as a clear mandate for development?

BB: Yes. Development has emerged as the broad consensus 

but there are various other issues also. A state comprises a cross-section of 

people with different needs and demands. Development is topmost on my agenda but 

not at the cost of agriculture and farmers.

S A: But there 

seems to be disagreement within your own party. How do you plan to tackle that?

BB: (Laughs) Why are you so bothered about it when 

I am not? It is not that serious a matter. A little bit of dissidence is very 

obvious and healthy. I am confident that I will be able to take my party people 

into confidence. A party is made up of many people and they have different outlooks 

to different situations. We will have to find a middle path and move forward together.

S A: After the 

results came in today, Jyoti Basu said that the Left now has a bigger say and 

the victory will help put pressure on the Centre. What do you say to that?

BB: After todays victories (Bengal and Kerala), 

we are in a very good position but that does not at all mean that we are going 

to flex our muscles unnecessarily. I do not want to create disturbance. Instead, 

I want a good working relation with the Prime Minister, finance minister, home 

minister, etc. But that does not mean that we are going to compromise on the common 

minimum programme or issues which work against the common people. We will work 

as a watchdog.

S A: But do you 

think that you have emerged more powerful?

BB: Yes. We have emerged more powerful and acceptable.

S A: Will you 

follow the economic model formulated by Manmohan Singh at the Centre or will you 

continue with your own model?

BB: National politics is different from that in a 

state. The Centre has to keep the broader picture in mind when it comes to financial 

policies, plans and attracting investments. I will try to take whatever is good 

for the state and leave the rest. For example, I think foreign retail at this 

stage is not good for agriculture. I met the Wal-Mart people after the Prime Minister 

asked me to? but I will not go ahead with it.

S A: During your 

campaign, you laid maximum emphasis on health and education. What do you plan 

to do with these two sectors?

BB: No, there are many other sectors as well but these 

two are major and critical in todays time. What I want is more commitment 

and discipline in these sectors. 

S A: You have 

been campaigning non-stop for the past few weeks. Now that the verdict is out, 

why dont you take some rest?

BB: (Laughs) No. This is not the time to rest. Certain 

issues have to be sorted out. I would be meeting Biman (Bose) in a little while 

from now.

S A: What will 

your cabinet look like?

BB: We are working on it. 

S A: But we have 

been hearing a lot of things of late. Are there chances of a few reshuffles?

BB: (Laughs) You keep hearing all these things. A 

clear picture will emerge very soon. 

S A: Do you think 

that a victory of such magnitude might make the party complacent and arrogant?

BB: We have to be very alert. We cannot afford to 

let complacence and arrogance slip in. That is why I always maintain that no matter 

how small the Opposition is, listen to them and take note.

S A: Everybody 

is saying that you were the biggest factor in this election victory. What do you 

have to say to that?

BB: No, I do not agree at all. One person cannot make 

such a big difference. The credit goes to the entire party and the organisation 

that worked round the clock. One individual cannot win you the election.

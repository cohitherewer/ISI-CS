 Wedding gift

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Rahul and Shweta

 New Delhi, Aug. 28: A day before his wedding in Mumbai, Rahul Mahajan has another reason to celebrate.

 A Delhi court today allowed the late Pramod Mahajans son, charged under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act to leave the country for his honeymoon.

 Rahul is facing charges of drug procurement and trafficking after a near-death experience of alleged drug overdose on the night of June 1-2. His fathers close aide Bibek Moitra died that night of overdose. 

 Rahul has been allowed by the court to travel outside the country between August 31 and September 11 for his honeymoon. 

 The accused (Rahul), however, has to keep the investigating officer informed of his schedule during the trip, said additional sessions judge S.N. Gupta. He will have to appear before the court on September 14.

 Rahul is marrying Shweta Singh, a pilot first introduced to him by his father. The couple reportedly plans to honeymoon in Seychelles.

 Delhi police have been contending before the court that allowing Rahul to leave the country would hurt investigations. We believe it is possible that there may be some evidence related to the case abroad. We do not want it to be tampered with, said B.S. Joon, chief public prosecutor in the case.

 Rahuls passport has been with the court, though he was granted bail over two months ago.

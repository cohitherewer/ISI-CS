 Bush card: outsource

 K.P. NAYAR

 Washington, Feb. 22: In a thinly-veiled effort to play to the gallery in India and raise his popularity among the Indian public ahead of his visit, President George W. Bush today unexpectedly tackled the issue of outsourcing of American jobs to India in his speech to Asia Society.

 The area of Americas relationship with India that seems to receive the most attention (here) is outsourcing. It is true that a number of Americans have lost jobs because companies have shifted operations to India, he said. 

 And losing a job is traumatic, it is difficult. It puts a strain on our families. But rather than respond with protectionist policies, I believe it makes sense to respond with educational policies to make sure that our workers are skilled for the jobs of the 21st century.

 The White House is acutely aware that Bush is disliked all over the world and that his visit to India will lack the sparkle of his predecessor Bill Clintons trip in 2000. 

 White House spin doctors hope that open support for outsourcing will partly make up for it by wooing the Indian on the street.

 Bush said Americans must also recognise that Indias growth is creating new opportunities for US businesses and farmers and workers. 

 Indias middle class is now estimated at 300 million people. Think about that. That is greater than the entire population of the US. And this middle class is buying air-conditioners, kitchen appliances, and washing machines -- and a lot of them from American companies like GE and Whirlpool and Westinghouse.

 Bush pointed out to his people that this means Americas job base is growing. Younger Indians are acquiring a taste for pizzas from Dominos, Pizza Hut. 

 He reminded Americans who criticise his administrations much-maligned support for outsourcing that Air-Indias recent order for Boeing planes, valued at more than $11 billion, was the single-largest commercial air plane order in Indias aviation history. 

 Today, Indias consumers associate American brands with quality and value and this trade is creating opportunity here at home. Americans also benefit when US companies... tap into Indias educated workforce. This investment makes American companies more competitive globally. It lowers the cost for American consumers.

 As if to balance his defence of outsourcing with a firm demand for a greater share of the Indian pie for US businesses, Bush cautioned India that there is more work to be done.

 He gave an indication of what he will ask of Indian interlocutors next week in the area of economic co-operation.

 India needs to continue to lift its caps on foreign investment, to make its rules and regulations more transparent and to continue to lower its tariffs and open its markets to American agricultural products, industrial goods and services.

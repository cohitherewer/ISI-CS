 No quota vow, Arjun tells EC

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 18: Human resource development minister Arjun Singh, in the eye of the quota controversy, is sticking to his stand that he did not announce reservation for Other Backward Classes. 

 The Election Commission has charged Singh with violating the model code of conduct by announcing a quota policy that can have serious political implications in the season of Assembly elections. 

 The HRD minister today sent his second reply to chief election commissioner B.B. Tandon. After Singh submitted his first response to the commission, he received a second notice from it. This time, the commission pointed to discrepancies between Singhs reply and newspaper reports. 

 The ministers office yesterday sought video footage and newspaper clippings from the poll panel on the basis of which the second notice was served. Singh wanted to study them before sending his reply. 

 The Centre has already passed the 93rd Constitutional Amendment Act pledging reservation for the socially and educationally backward classes, which include the OBCs. 

 The act has mandated the HRD ministry to draw up provisions that will fulfil the commitment the government has made in Parliament.

 At the heart of the controversy is a proposal from the ministry to introduce a 27 per cent quota for OBCs in government educational institutions. 

 Asked earlier this month, Singh had said the cabinet was considering the proposal.

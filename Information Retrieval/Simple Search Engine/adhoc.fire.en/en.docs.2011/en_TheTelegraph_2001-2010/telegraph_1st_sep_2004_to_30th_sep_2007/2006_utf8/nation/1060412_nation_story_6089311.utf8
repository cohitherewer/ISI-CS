 CBI notice to ill officer

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 11: The CBI will summon senior IFS officer Rakesh Kumar, wanted in a human trafficking case, after he extended his stay in Germany on medical ground.

 Sources said Kumar had indicated three times in the past the likely date of his return but he kept postponing the journey.

 The CBI has now decided to summon the senior officer facing allegations of illegally sending a bhangra troupe, Mehak Punjab Di, to Germany last year.

 Kumar, a special secretary (economic relations), had got himself admitted in a hospital in Munich on his way back from Brazil. He was travelling with minister of state for external affairs Anand Sharma when the foreign secretary asked him to return after the CBI named him in a first information report.

 The investigative agency was waiting for the officer to return to question him on his alleged role in the case. Sources said Kumars medical reports have been checked but no history of any ailment was found.

 Officials said Kumar would be served a notice under Section 160 of the Criminal Procedure Code that allows the CBI to summon a suspect or witness for questioning. The 1972 batch IFS officer has already been sent on leave by the external affairs ministry.

 The investigative agency has received files relating to the case from the Indian mission in Berlin. Kumar, as the director-general of the Indian Council of Cultural Relations, had allegedly empanelled the 16-member bhangra troupe.

 Nine members of the troupe disappeared after landing in Berlin and sought political asylum. However, five lost their case and the German authorities are deporting them.

 Officials said the CBI is investigating charges that Kumar had taken Rs 5 to 6 lakh each from the nine persons for facilitating their travel.

 A Ludhiana-based conduit Shiv Kumar Sharma allegedly arranged the trip. He is now in CBI custody and is helping out in piecing together the operation to smuggle the nine as members of the dance troupe.

 Rape and murder in star hub

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, June 24: A man and his parents residing in the plush Lokhandwala Complex have been arrested on the charge of sexually assaulting and murdering their 10-year-old domestic help.

 Rajendra Gajaria, 38, his father Vinod, 64, and mother Madhu, 60, were remanded in police custody for 14 days.

 Sonu, who was from Bhopal, worked in the Gajarias third-floor flat in the complex that is home to many film and television stars. Her elder sister, Shanti, worked in the same building.

 On Wednesday, the Gajarias informed police that Sonu had committed suicide by hanging. But the post-mortem revealed injury marks on her neck and private parts.

 After questioning, police arrested the Gajarias last night on the suspicion that Rajendra had sexually assaulted Sonu before strangulating her.

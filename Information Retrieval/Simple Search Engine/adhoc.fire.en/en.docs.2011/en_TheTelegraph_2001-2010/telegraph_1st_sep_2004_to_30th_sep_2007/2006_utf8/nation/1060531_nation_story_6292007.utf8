 Oil letter twist

 New Delhi, May 30 (PTI): Andaleeb Sehgal, the director of Hamdaan Exports, has told the Pathak inquiry authority that he had taken two letters of introduction from former external affairs minister K. Natwar Singh to the Iraqi oil ministry, sources said.

 In an affidavit, Sehgal, a friend of Natwars son Jagat Singh, retraced the events that helped him get the introduction letters on AICC letterhead, authority sources said.

 According to Sehgal, he reached Baghdad in January 2001 and participated in the reception hosted by the Indian ambassador there. He had met Natwar at the party where he introduced himself as a food supplier.

 The Iraqi state oil marketing organisation told Sehgal that a company recognised by the UN as a dealer of oil would be registered with the ministry. If he could arrange for sale of oil, the marking firm would help him qualify for supplying food and other products.

 Sehgal said in his affidavit that he needed a credible letter of introduction or recommendation from possibly the Government of India and had expressed his wish to be associated with one of the unregistered oil companies.

 Sources said these letters were written by Natwar on AICC letter head.

 On perusal of the evidence supplied to it by the Enforcement Directorate (ED), the Pathak authority found that $7,000 was deposited on June 12, 2001, in Sehgals bank account.

 On June 25, 2001, another $40,000 was deposited in Sehgals account and on August 2, 2001, $3793.52 was put, the sources said.

 However, it was still not clear whether any of this money was traced to any of the people named in the Volcker report, the sources said.

 There are also indications that while the ED is ready with its interim reports, another set of documents will be provided to the authority by the directorate in the next few days. Besides, Jagat will soon be called for a second round of questioning.

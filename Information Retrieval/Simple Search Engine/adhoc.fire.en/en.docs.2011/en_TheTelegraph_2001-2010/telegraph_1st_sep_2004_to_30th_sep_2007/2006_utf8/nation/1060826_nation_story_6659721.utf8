New Delhi, Aug. 25: The defence and civil aviation ministries have been asked to create a joint management body within a month to coordinate between aviation authorities to allow for faster air travel and accommodate the expansion of private airlines.

 The primary objectives of the new regulatory body would be to free more airspace for commercial flights and find more land at airfields to park aircraft. The body will effectively seek to restrict the control of airspace by the Indian Air Force but keep the armed service in charge of its security.

 Officials of the two ministries were today asked to work out details for an institutional framework (that) will be evolved for tackling and resolving day-to-day issues in management and operations of the rapidly expanding aviation arena, a senior defence ministry source said.

 The decision to create the institutional framework was taken by civil aviation minister Praful Patel and minister of state for defence M.M. Pallam Raju, weeks after the government practically turned down a proposal from the chief of air staff, Air Chief Marshal S.P. Tyagi, to create an aerospace commission.

 The new agency will be a regulatory body between the Directorate-General of Civil Aviation, the two ministries, the air force, the air-traffic control and the Airports Authority of India.

 The regulatory body would be required to supervise exchange of land between civil aviation and defence authorities. But it would lead to a whittling down of the powers of the IAF in the control of airspace.

 The IAF is the custodian of Indian airspace (estimated at 4 million cubic km). The regulatory body will seek to find ways to allow faster travel through five airspace zones that are supervised by the IAF directly.

 These zones are prohibited area (example: skies over sensitive zones such as Raisina Hill housing Rashtrapati Bhavan, South Block and North Block), danger area (example: skies over military establishments such as rocket and ammunition stockyards), restricted area (example: Bharatpur, for bird activity), flying training area (example: Dundigal, north of Hyderabad, where the Air Force Academy is based) and local flying areas (example: Hindon, an air force base on the eastern outskirts of Delhi).

 The IAF will also be asked to release land that it holds in airfields such as Jaisalmer in Rajasthan and Bagdogra in Bengal. 

 Jaisalmer is close to the Pakistan border and is directly controlled by the IAF. Similarly, Bagdogra is a major base close to three international borders. But both are tourist destinations and the IAF will have to make arrangements to accommodate not only scheduled commercial aircraft but also charter flights.

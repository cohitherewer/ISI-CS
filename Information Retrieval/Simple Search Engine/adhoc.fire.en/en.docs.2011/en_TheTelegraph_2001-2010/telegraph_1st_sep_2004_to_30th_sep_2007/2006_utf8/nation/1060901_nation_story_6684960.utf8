 Assault cloud on deportee 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Hyderabad, Aug. 31: Police in the Andhra capital today claimed that Mohammed Shafiq Ahmed, who was detained at Heathrow Airport last Friday and deported to India, has a criminal background.

 Deputy commissioner Shikha Goel said the 23-year-old commerce graduate from Osmania University also visited Afghanistan and Iraq from Dubai, where he worked as a clerk in a trading firm. She did not confirm whether Ahmed had links with the banned Students Islamic Movement of India.

 Hyderabad police, who grilled him for several hours after he landed at Begumpet airport, said Ahmed is wanted in a case of assault on a Congress legislator of Malakpet in June 2004.

 Inspector Subbarami Reddy, of Begumpet police station, said Ahmed, against whom a non-bailable warrant had been issued in the assault case, left the country after the Malakpet incident and his deportation from the UK has come in handy for Hyderabad police.

 Ahmed was on his way to the US to join an MBA course when he was detained at Heathrow for not having a transit visa. Deported to India, he landed at Mumbai, from where he was brought to Hyderabad yesterday. 

 Arrested on the ground of reasonable suspicion (of terrorist links) by Hyderabad police, he was released on bail by a local magistrate last night.

 Ahmed said British police grilled him for three days. They asked me all kinds of questions on terrorism, organisations and about some top terrorist leaders.

 Acquisition dissent in CPM 

 BISWAJIT ROY

 Calcutta, Nov. 26: Bengal land minister Abdur Rezzak Mollah again expressed resentment over land acquisition at the expense of marginal farmers in a closed-door CPM meeting today. 

 The CPM-led government wants to relax the rural land ceiling law to facilitate the acquisition and transfer of farmland for industrial purposes. 

 Under pressure from Left Front partners, the bill was sent to the Assemblys select committee for an all-party scrutiny and amendments on Saturday, two days before it was to be tabled. 

 However, Mollah also said that land acquisition for giant projects such as the chemical hub to be developed by the Salim Group and SEZs would not suffer as government agencies like the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation have the right to acquire and hold land. 

 Unless the amendments are made early, the problem will crop up when the land has to be leased out to investors, a source quoted Mollah as saying. 

 Only mills, tea gardens and factories are exempt from the land ceiling law now.

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and Bengal CPM secretary Biman Bose attended todays meeting, meant to review the governments performance six months after returning to power.

 All CPM ministers were there to brief the leadership about the progress of projects and the problems they were facing. 

 Bose said: It was a routine meeting. Our ministers have been asked to speed up development work and ensure transparency. 

 Mollah, however, complained of lack of transparency in the government. He raised questions about governance of the government, said a leader.

 The barb was directed at the chief minister and commerce and industries minister Nirupam Sen, who had mulled the West Bengal Land Reforms Amendment Bill, 2006, apparently without consulting Mollahs land and land reforms department. 

 The law change allows sharecroppers the most visible beneficiaries of Bengals land reforms to surrender the right of cultivation in respect of 50 per cent of land cultivated by him to the owner of the land who wants to sell it to investors-developers or the government.

 Mollah had earlier opposed takeover of farmland for industry or infrastructure projects and warned of a food scarcity.

 The chief minister today stressed the need to increase farm production as land acquisition and industrialisation were inevitable.

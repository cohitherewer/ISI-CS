 Palaces, but for IT czars

 Hitec City in Hyderabad caters to the IT sectors real estate needs

 Hyderabad, Oct. 6: The city of nawabs is slowly turning into the city of IT czars.

 The spacious palaces whose domes and pillars used to dominate Hyderabads skyline are being overshadowed by high-rises of steel and glass.

 But its not only the office blocks, malls and multiplexes that reflect the change in landscape. Even luxury living has entered the new age, with the old-style mansions making way for strings of palatial villas sprouting on the citys outskirts.

 Take, for instance, the mansion a private builder, Omega Shelters, is constructing for an infotech baron.

 It has a built-up area of 16,000 square feet and is spread over four acres, says Mahabir Pershad Agrawal, promoter of Omega.

 The modern-day palace will have a lawn and a garden sprawling across 1.3 acres, a revolving drawing room, about a dozen garages, a swimming pool, furnished rooms and an ultramodern kitchen. 

 As a freebie from our side, we are setting up electronic and telecom systems for security and maintenance, says Agrawal.

 The mansion is part of a 60-acre project that will offer dozens of 4,000-square-foot houses built on an acre each.

 We are giving value for money. Everything, even the toilet seats, will be custom-built, says Agrawal.

 Omega is building another 12 houses, priced at Rs 3 crore each, in the same suburban locality Kompally and almost all have been booked.

 Five years ago, outsiders used to be terrified at the idea of buying land in the city.

 The paperwork was always a problem, says Sajay Daga, a real estate consultant at Gacchi Bowli, the IT corridor that houses Infosys, Wipro and Microsoft.

 But with the IT boom, begun by the Telugu Desam government of N. Chandrababu Naidu, continuing to attract multinationals to the city, the real estate scene has been transformed.

 No one bats an eyelid when asked to pay Rs 35 lakh for a flat, says Murlimohan, who owns five apartment complexes in the hi-tech city.

 Construction consultant Amit Bagaria says another string of 35 villas, priced between Rs 1.75 crore and Rs 15 crore, is coming up.

 The land and other infrastructure is already in place. The project will kick off by December. Seven of the villas have already been booked. The largest, spread over seven acres and built on the model of an Austrian villa, has received a large number of enquiries, says Bagaria.

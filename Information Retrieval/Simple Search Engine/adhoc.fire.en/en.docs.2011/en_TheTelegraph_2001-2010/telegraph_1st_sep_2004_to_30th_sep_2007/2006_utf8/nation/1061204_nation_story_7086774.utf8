 Marrakech red carpet for Ajay and Kajol

 AMIT ROY

 Sonia Rannou, the programmer at the festival

 Marrakech, Dec. 3: Actors Ajay Devgan and his wife, Kajol, have been billed as the main Bollywood attractions at the sixth Marrakech Film Festival where no fewer than 20 Indian movies are being shown, including Omkara, which will be screened tomorrow out of competition.

 After Bollywood adaptations of Macbeth (Maqbool) and Othello (Omkara), everyone here is hoping this will not turn out to be an Indian version of Hamlet, without the prince.

 The festivals homage to Devgan and Kajol is due to be held tomorrow before a packed audience at the festivals main venue, the Palais des Congress, where last night, the tribute was to Italian cinema, 24 of whose representatives turned up and stood in a line on stage to reflect all that is best about the country which gave the world Frederico Fellinis La Dolce Vita.

 Unfortunately, although the Moroccan authorities have put up posters everywhere to announce the imminent arrival of Mr and Mrs Devgan, it is by no means certain they will be able to make it because of personal reasons. 

 This will be hugely disappointing for fans of Bollywood in a country where popular Hindi cinema has a massive following.

 You are not talking about a country where people know nothing about Hindi cinema, was the understated comment from Sonia Rannou, who grew up in Jaipur but has lived in France for the last 20 years, many of them spent promoting Bollywood. Rannou is the programmer who has worked with the Marrakech Film Festival to narrow down the choice of Indian films to be shown this week to 14.

 Included in a section called Taj Mahal, are Yun Hota Toh Kya Hota; Rang De Basanti; Deepa Mehtas Fire, Earth and Water; Kandukondain Kandukondain; Dil Chahta Hai; Lakshya; Swades; Mein Meri Patni Aur Woh; Parineeta; Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna; Chokher Bali and Don.

 The Moroccans, who have grown up on a diet of Hindi cinema, wont confuse a Bollywood film with a non-Bollywood film as people in France and other countries do, explained Rannou. 

 They wont think that Monsoon Wedding or Bride and Prejudice are Bollywood films.

 Five other movies, starring Devgan Company, The Legend of Bhagat Singh, Raincoat, Yuva and Fanaa plus Omkara bring the total to 20.

 One fan from Casablanca, Rashid, who has bunked work for a whole week the Humphrey Bogart classic was shot in California, incidentally, not in the city which bears the films name spoke with great emotion of a meeting, a few years ago, with the director, Gautam Ghose, whom he held in high regard (Ah, Gautam Ghose..!)

 If Devgan and Kajol are unable to turn up, they will have to be represented at the homage meant for them by Omkaras director, Vishal Bharadwaj, and screenwriter Robin Bhatt.

 But it will not be the same, especially for a young disabled girl, who had harboured ambitions of seeing Bollywoods golden couple in real life.

 The festival authorities had planned for the girl to present a bouquet to Devgan and Kajol after receiving a touching letter from her: I am Iman Jenbari, I am 14 and am from Marrakech and wanted to tell you how much I love Ajay Devgan and Kajol, whom I dream of seeing and meeting. I am sorry to be troubling you. Thank you for making my dream come true.

 The chairman of the jury at the festival, which is also honouring Susan Sarandon, is Roman Polanski.

 New Delhi, Jan. 4: Residents of the tsunami-devastated Andaman and Nicobar Islands are looking forward to a legislative Assembly after an assurance from Prime Minister Manmohan Singh that he would take up the matter with his cabinet colleagues.

 Manoranjan Bhakta, the lone member who represents the 4.5 lakh denizens of the emerald isles in Parliament, said the assurance at a meeting with delegates of panchayati raj institutions has come as a shot in the arm for them.

 People of Andaman and Nicobar have been demanding a legislative Assembly. The Prime Minister told us that once back he would take it up and discuss the matter with the related ministries. If we are given a legislative Assembly, a lot of problems with regard to development and economy can be sorted out, Bhakta said.

 A 22-member municipal council now rules the Union territory and the Centre will have to move a constitutional amendment bill in Parliament if the islands are to get a legislative Assembly.

 Bhakta said the islands population should not come in the way as Sikkim also had a similar population but was granted the status of a state. There is no such rule in the Constitution that stops a less populated area from having a legislative Assembly. We can easily have a 30-member strong Assembly.

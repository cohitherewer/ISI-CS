 Tamil must in class

 Chennai, May 31: Every schoolchild in Tamil Nadu, except those studying in CBSE schools, must learn Tamil from now, reports our special correspondent.

 The Assembly today passed the Tamil Nadu Tamil Learning Act by voice vote, making it compulsory for all state board schools ? including Anglo-Indian and minority institutions ? to teach Tamil from Class I to Class X from this year.

 The legislation will be enforced in a phased manner, school education minister Thangam Thennarasu said.

 In the academic year 2006-07, schools must begin teaching Tamil in Class I. Gradually, the subject will be made compulsory till Class X.

 With the World Cup fever sweeping the country, the minister borrowed the language of football to emphasise the importance of the law. The chief minister has kicked the ball in the right field with the right momentum and at the right time, though it may take some time to reach the ultimate goalpost, Thennarasu said.

 English, too, will be a compulsory subject from Class I to Class X. Students whose mother tongue is neither Tamil nor English can study their mother tongue as an optional subject as a third language.

 Anti-conversion law

 The Tamil Nadu Assembly today formally lifted the ban on religious conversions brought in by the ADMK government.

 Tit-for-tat Pak curbs

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 16: Indian diplomats posted in Islamabad will no longer be able to travel to Rawalpindi or the hill station of Murree without permission.

 The tit-for-tat order of the Pakistan foreign office comes in response to New Delhi pointing out to Pakistani diplomats here that they were not allowed to visit neighbouring Gurgaon and Noida without permission.

 An official of the Pakistan High Commission in Delhi said the latest step was taken after the ministry of external affairs refused to lift restrictions imposed in October on Pakistani diplomats to cross the city limits of Delhi. 

 Terming the restrictions on visiting Noida and Gurgaon absurd, a Pakistani diplomat said it was impossible to inform the ministry in advance about a visit to the satellite towns that are almost a part of Delhi now and house many shopping malls and upscale clubs.

 Crowing that Islamabad allowed the Indian officials to visit Rawalpindi and Murree, which was 100 km away, he said: India may be a big country but it seems to have a small heart. Pakistan also seems to have had a change of heart now.

 Delhi maintains that it had not issued any new order curtailing the movement of Pakistani diplomats but had only reminded them of existing rules. The rulebook says the diplomats must seek permission seven days in advance before visiting neighbouring towns, but this has not been strictly followed over the years. 

 When a senior Pakistani diplomat visited the ministry of external affairs in August this year, he was informed of violation of the rule. This came just after the Mumbai train blasts that derailed the India-Pakistan peace process.

 Islamabads move has come soon after a successful round of talks between the foreign secretaries of the two countries. External affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee is slated to visit Pakistan in January.

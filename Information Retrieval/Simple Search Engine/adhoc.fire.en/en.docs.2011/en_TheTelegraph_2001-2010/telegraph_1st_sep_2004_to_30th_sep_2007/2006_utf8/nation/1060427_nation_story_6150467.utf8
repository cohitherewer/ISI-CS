 Beijing, April 26 (PTI): Indian airhostesses will for the first time fly on India-bound China Eastern Airlines flights, a move that would please increasing number of Indians travelling to China for business as well as tourism.

 Stewardesses from India will serve on the flights between Shanghai and New Delhi from May 1 to 7, airline sources said.

 The Shanghai-based airline has recruited 500 flight attendants from India, Japan, South Korea, France, the US, Germany and Spain since 1993, the Xinhua news agency reported.

 The foreign attendants have brought with them flight experiences, different cultures and folk customs, Xinhua quoted an airline source as saying.

 The company is planning to recruit attendants from the Philippines and Russia.

 Poverty drives siblings to suicide

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Hyderabad, Sept. 22: When 

 they lost their parents to cancer, Sujata, Dhanalakshmi 

 and Ramesh had made a promise to each other no matter 

 what, they would survive.

 Eight months later, the pact was broken when the siblings from a remote village in Srikakulam district ended their lives by pouring a bottle of pesticide down their little throats.

 Since Sriramulu and Parvati died of blood cancer early this year, life has been one of constant struggle for their children.

 The familys only asset a two-acre dry patch of land in Tarlagadur village had been sold to pay for the couples treatment. So it was left to 15-year-old Sujata, the eldest of the three children, and her 65-year-old grandmother to fend for the family.

 They even worked as farm labourers to make ends meet and send the younger children, Dhanalakshmi, 12, and Ramesh, 10, to school.

 But after her grandmothers death last week, Sujata lost her confidence and the will to live.

 Three days after the funeral, the three children decided to end their lives.

 On Wednesday, Sujata took her brother and sister out for a meal and a movie. On their way home, they bought a bottle of pesticide.

 Late in the evening, the siblings gulped down the poison and were dead within hours. 

 The next morning, neighbours found their bodies on the floor of their thatched hut.

 They had spent their last paisa to buy pesticides, said inspector S. Ramesh, who found that the children had splurged Rs 120 on the day of their death.

 The children participated in a local temple festival and ate the common meal before returning home on Wednesday, said village sarpanch A. Vallabh Rao.

 The story of Sujata and her siblings is true of hundreds of children in Andhra Pradeshs coastal and Telengana districts. 

 Orphans have either landed in brothels or have been forced to work as child labourers. To beat poverty, several youths, including women, have also joined the Maoists. 

 According to the state childrens welfare fund directorate, nearly 2,130 children were orphaned in the state in 2006, of whom only 300 have been accommodated in state shelters.

 A majority of them are eking out a living in cities and towns as menial labourers, said its spokesman.

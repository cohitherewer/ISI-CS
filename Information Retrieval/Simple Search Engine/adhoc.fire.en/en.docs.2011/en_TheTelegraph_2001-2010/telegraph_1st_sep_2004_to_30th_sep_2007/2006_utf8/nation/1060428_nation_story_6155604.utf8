 Sonia mulls middle path

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 27: Sonia Gandhi favours a balancing act on reservation for Other Backward Classes in educational institutions.

 The Congress president does not want the government to go on an overdrive and polarise the polity but would like it to recognise the reality that the backward castes are on the margins of premium educational institutions like the IIMs and IITs, and that efforts should be made to co-opt them, party sources said.

 Sonia, the sources added, is aware that adopting such a delicate stand is difficult. 

 She is aware of the fact that the backward castes form over 50 per cent of the voting population and unless and until the Congress reaches out to them in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, its revival will be impossible, a source said. 

 The Congresss biggest strength in the pre-Mandal era was its ambiguity, today thats our greatest weakness as every disadvantaged caste wants its share of the political cake.

 As human resource development minister Arjun Singh gave no assurance to quota protesters when they met him today, the mood in the Congress was he should not go back on or dilute his position.

 The sources heaped scorn on science and technology minister Kapil Sibal for speaking out against Arjun in Hanover yesterday. 

 Sibal, travelling with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, was quoted as saying: No policy should be taken which will dilute the levels of excellence in our research and development and educational institutions at a time when the western countries are looking at us for excellence. 

 It was dubbed a casteist statement. We have to fight elections and enlarge our base, said a source. 

 Sibal, who is part of the group of ministers looking into possible affirmative action in the private sector, reportedly feels reservation should not be forced on industry.

 He claims to have the backing of Sonias political secretary Ahmed Patel. But the sources said the politically astute Patel would never associate himself with a pronouncement that goes against the popular mood in the party.

 The Prime Minister is yet to speak on the issue. But Arjun ruled out any difference of opinion. Absolutely not. No comma, full stop this way or that way, he told reporters.

 The sources said Sonia would not allow Arjun to leverage his position on reservation by destabilising the Prime Minister or making things difficult for the government. He should know where to get off, a source said.

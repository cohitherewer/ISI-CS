 Politicians, reformed dons in riot dock

 Bangalore, Oct. 10: Tension has simmered in Mangalore since the BJPs rise in coastal Karnataka over the past decade coincided with a parallel growth in the number of reformed underworld dons who settled here and found patronage among political parties determined to check its influence.

 The violence that left two dead and over 100 wounded last week began when a group allegedly stopped a cattle-laden truck heading towards an abattoir. Some reports said those on the vehicle were beaten up when it knocked down motorists, but no confirmation was available.

 A bandh was called by the BJP and Hindu outfits last Thursday, but vandalism over the next few days gave the incident a communal colour. In the clashes that ensued, shops owned by both communities were damaged.

 Visiting the town yesterday, Union minister of state for home, Prakash Jaiswal, blamed the BJP-partnered state government for its inability to control the communal violence. The minister said his report to the Centre would touch upon the possible involvement of the Students Islamic Movement of India (Simi).

 I will submit a detailed report, including Simis alleged role. The local administration should have convened a peace committee meeting when the violence escalated and not waited for over two days to do it.

 Jaiswal criticised Karnataka home minister M.P. Prakash for not meeting him despite being in town. Chief minister H.D. Kumaraswamy has blamed the Congress for the escalation in violence, a charge rebuffed instantly.

 Mangalore superintendent of police B. Dayananda said a youth was assaulted when curfew was relaxed last morning, but he was out of danger. Another relaxation was made last evening in this coastal town and its neighbouring areas, where curfew has now been in force for the past three to four days. The police have detained over 200 people.

 Away from the cauldron, police officers say the BJPs growing influence has fuelled discord. Apart from politics, some organisations (are) seen as meddling with Muslims way of life, an officer said.

 Along with the BJP came Bajrang Dal and Go Raksha Samiti. This did not go down well with Muslims, who have been reduced to a minority, another officer said.

 Among the dons who came to Mangalore, apparently to make a clean break with their criminal past, was Sadhu Shetty, who was shot dead in a 2002 Mumbai encounter. Shetty and many others, from both communities, formed their own gangs and began settling real estate disputes in the region. The police failed to keep a watch on their activities.

 Until last weeks eruption, the 1993 riots in Bhatkal, a Muslim stronghold north of Mangalore where smuggling was common, was the most serious instance of conflict.

 Then, it was the Surathkal clashes a few years back.

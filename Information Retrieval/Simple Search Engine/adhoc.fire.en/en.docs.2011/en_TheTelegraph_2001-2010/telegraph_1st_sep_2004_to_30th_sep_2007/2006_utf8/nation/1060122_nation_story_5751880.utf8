 200 held for protests 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Kathmandu, Jan. 21: More than 200 activists were arrested as an ancient square of Kathmandu became the venue for a protest rally called by the seven-party alliance against the monarchy.

 Even outside the Basantapur locality around Durbar Square where the protesters converged, there were signs of dissent. Fourteen leading intellectuals and writers were picked up by the police at New Baneshwor. 

 Notables arrested at Basantapur include Mahanta Thakur and Ram Sharan Mahat of the Nepali Congress and Yubaraj Gyawali, Gopal Shakya and Kamal Koirala of the Communist Party of Nepal (UML).

 Writers arrested at New Baneshwor were at a cultural protest programme. Among them was poet Arjun Parajuli who, witnesses said, was beaten up by the police.

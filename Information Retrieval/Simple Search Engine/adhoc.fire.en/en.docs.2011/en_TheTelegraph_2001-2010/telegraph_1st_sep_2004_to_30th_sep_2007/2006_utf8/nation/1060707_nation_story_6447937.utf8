 Unable to pay bribe, woman gives birth outside hospital

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

Behrampore, July 6: A 22-year-old woman was 

forced to give birth under a banyan tree in front of the Behrampore Sadar Hospital 

this morning as her relatives could not pay Rs 500 as bribe to two general duty 

attendants.

 Fazila Bibi was later shifted to a bed in the hospital, 200 km from Calcutta, after her brother-in-law, Arjam Sheikh, paid Rs 100 to the two attendants and promised to pay another Rs 200 later.

 The attendants were suspended after Arjam lodged a complaint with hospital superintendent Indranath Chatterjee. Arjam and Fazila identified the duo.

 Around 6 am today, Fazila, accompanied by Arjam and other relatives, arrived from Beunchitala village, 20 km from Behrampore, to get admitted to the hospital. 

 Her husband, Sarjen Sheikh, a farmer, was to arrive later with her lunch.

 Seeing his sister-in-law in labour, Arjam rushed to the maternity building of the hospital but as the doctor on duty was on his rounds, the paperwork for admission was delayed.

 After about half an hour, when a bed was assigned, Arjam requested the two group D employees on duty ? Bharati Hajra and Laboni Hajra ? to carry Fazila to the building.

 When I urged them to take my sister-in-law to the hospital, they demanded Rs 500 from me. I told them I dont have so much money as we are poor farmers but they refused to listen, said Arjam.

 By then Fazila had given birth in full public view under the tree. Even as Fazila lay under the tree with the baby, the umbilical cord yet to be severed, the two group D employees haggled with Arjam. After about half an hours bargaining, they agreed to shift Fazila for Rs 300, but not before Arjam paid them Rs 100 as advance.

 What could I do? I had to shift my sister-in-law to the hospital. So I paid Rs 100 to the two women. We felt humiliated as she had to deliver the baby in full public view, said Arjam.

 When he lodged the complaint, Chatterjee asked Fazila and Arjam to identify the duo. The hospital superintendent paraded all the group D employees in front of them and they identified Bharati and Laboni.

 Chatterjee immediately suspended them.

 I have ordered an inquiry into the incident and suspended the two group D employees as the patient and her relative have identified them. It is a serious crime to ask money for such duties. Moreover, it is most inhuman to demand money when the mother and newborn are lying under a tree, said Chatterjee.

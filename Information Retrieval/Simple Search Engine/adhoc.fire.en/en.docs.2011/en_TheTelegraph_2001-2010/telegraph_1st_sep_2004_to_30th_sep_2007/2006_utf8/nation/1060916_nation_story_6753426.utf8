 Chennai, Sept. 15: Tamil Nadu police today sealed seven small factories in suburban Ambattur and arrested seven people on the charge of manufacturing the rockets and launchers seized recently in Andhra Pradesh.

 A police team has left for Nellore in search of alleged kingpin Raghu alias Srinivasa Reddy and his wife Sudharani, both part of a Naxalite group in Andhra, state police chief D. Mukherjee said.

 After the huge arms haul near Mahboobnagar, the couple had abandoned their home and workshop in Ambattur and fled on a motorcycle with just a carry bag, he said.

 The units made the components that were later assembled into the rockets and launchers, the police said, claiming they had unearthed the racket by using students as decoys.

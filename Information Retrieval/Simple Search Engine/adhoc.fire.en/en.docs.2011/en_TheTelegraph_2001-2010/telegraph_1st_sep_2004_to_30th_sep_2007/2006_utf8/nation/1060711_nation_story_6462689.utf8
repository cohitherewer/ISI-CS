 Army first step in gender equality 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 On equal terms?

New Delhi, July 10: The army will shortly expand the training period for lady cadets and bring it on a par with gentlemen cadets. 

 Women on short service commission (14 years) will also be extended the benefits given to all officers with similar conditions of service, but permanent commission is not on the agenda, army sources said here today.

 Army chief General Joginder Jaswant Singh visited the Officers Training Academy in Chennai today, where all cadets taken into the service on short service commission are trained, and inspected the arrangements being made to expand the training period for lady cadets.

 The army chiefs visit is in preparation for a government decision on a proposal to scrap the womens special entry scheme and extend to women in the army the benefits recommended by the AV Singh Committee on pay scales and time-bound promotions.

 A positive decision on the recommendation to extend all benefits to lady cadets with retrospective effect will mean that Priyamvada Mardikar, who was given the rank of lieutenant colonel on International Womens Day last year only to have it taken back, will have her prestige restored.

 Army sources had told The Telegraph that the rank was erroneously conferred on her. In the hierarchical structure of the army, it is humiliating for an officer to be stripped of his/her rank.

 The treatment meted out to Mardikar was put down to unresolved bureaucratic processes in army headquarters. But army headquarters is likely to recommend that time-bound promotions be applicable only after lady cadets are put through the same duration of training as the men in the academy.

 The army chief took time out during his visit to the academy to meet lady cadets. The chiefs visit comes within days of a furore after the suicide of a lady lieutenant, Susmita Chakraborthy. 

 The officers death led to intense focus on the discrimination that women face in the army. Even if service conditions are to be brought on a par, women will not be entitled to permanent commission and can serve a maximum of 14 years in short service commission.

 Lady cadets will be given training for 49 weeks (up from the current 24-25 weeks) before being given commissions, but unlike the men they are not likely to be asked to serve an infantry attachment after passing out from the academy. This means that the combat arms of the army will not be open to women.

 Army sources said here that Major General K.K. Kohli, commandant of the academy, briefed the army chief on the changes in the training schedule for women and the planned expansion of infrastructure for training and administration of lady cadets. 

 The army chief, who was with his wife, also interacted with gentlemen and lady cadets and expressed satisfaction on the standard of training and also on the high level of motivation displayed by the lady cadets, an army statement here said.

 Last month, defence minister Pranab Mukherjee asked the chiefs of the armed forces to study the feasibility of commissioning women officers for all roles. But at the armed forces headquarters opinion is weighed against this possibility. 

 The expansion of training means that lady cadets will be put through more arduous physical tests for a longer period and participate in nearly all drills like the men. But the army is likely to continue with different physical training standards for men and women.

 Sikh shocker in Jessica case

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Jethmalani, Jessica: 

 Twist 

 New Delhi, Nov. 8: Ram Jethmalani, defending Jessica Lal murder accused Manu Sharma, today told Delhi High Court that a Sikh gentleman had killed the model. 

 A Sikh gentleman present at the party shot and killed Jessica, he told a stunned courtroom, adding that he would soon disclose the persons identity.

 This is the first time the defence has accused someone of the crime. Jethmalani also told the court that he would prove the guilt of this person.

 The statement is the latest twist to the case, which has seen a politician resign and a judge doing a somersault.

 Manus father Vinod Sharma, a senior Congress leader, quit the party in 1999 at the time of the murder but he was taken back later. Recently, he resigned from the Haryana government, in which he was a minister.

 According to newspaper reports, Justice R.S. Sodhi, a judge hearing the case, had been approached in 1999 to ensure Manu gets bail, prompting him to opt out of adjudicating in the case. But he said he now wants to hear the case.

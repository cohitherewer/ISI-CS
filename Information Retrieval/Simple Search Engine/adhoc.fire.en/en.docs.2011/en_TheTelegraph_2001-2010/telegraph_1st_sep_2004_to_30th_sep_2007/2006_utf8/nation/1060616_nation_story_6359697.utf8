 Stamp on Tharoor

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 15: India today confirmed that it would support Shashi Tharoors candidature for the post of UN secretary-general.

 But New Delhi was at pains to stress that the endorsement of the candidacy would not dilute its bid to gain entry into the UN Security Council.

 A careful study of pros and cons led to the decision to support Tharoor ? a matter of pride for a son of India, a son of Asia, Delhi said, adding that it should not be linked with Indias long-standing desire to occupy a permanent chair in the Security Council.

 The foreign ministry was responding to fears expressed in some quarters that by canvassing for Tharoor, India might be distracted from its main goal of UN reforms.

 According to precedent, the job of UNs chief administrator is not held by any of the worlds major powers that are already permanent members of the Council. That rules out US, China, Britain, France and China. 

 Delhi said that as a consistent and significant contributor to the functioning of the UN, it continued to strive for comprehensive reforms of the world body, key to which was the expansion of the Council in both permanent and non-permanent categories. 

 The foreign office said Delhi would continue to work with G4 on pushing through the reforms. 

 India said the decision on Tharoor was based on a commitment to rotational principle under which the next secretary-general should be from Asia. 

 Tharoors internationally acclaimed stature, achievements and experience make him a strong contender, Delhi said.

 Officials said Delhi has started the process of seeking support for its nominee with instructions passed on to the missions to launch a campaign in his favour.

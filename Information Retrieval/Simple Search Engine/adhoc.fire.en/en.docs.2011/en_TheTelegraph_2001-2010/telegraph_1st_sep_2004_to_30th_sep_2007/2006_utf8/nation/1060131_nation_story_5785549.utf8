 Time for thanks in Gowda yard

 ANIL BUDUR LULLA

 Bangalore, Jan. 30: After politics, its time for pilgrimage.

 The men behind the dramatic manoeuvres that led to Congressman Dharam Singhs resignation as Karnataka chief minister have left on a different journey ? for divine blessings ? before they begin a new partnership.

 Chief minister-designate H.D. Kumaraswamy, who led the breakaway group of the Janata Dal (Secular) to stake claim to form a new government with BJP help, is off visiting a temple with family members and three other legislators. They have decided to visit a shrine dedicated to Shani in Tamil Nadu to ward off the evil influence of the god known to bring ill luck.

 Kumaraswamy, who was accused of letting down his father, Dal (S) national leader and former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda, when the political drama unfolded, met his extended family before leaving for Tirunallar and sought the blessings of the elders.

 According to popular belief, a bath in the Nala Theertam can avert misfortune. The legendary King Nala is said to have been relieved of his afflictions, due to the malefic influence of Shani, after worshipping in this temple, one of the few in the country dedicated to the god.

 Kumaraswamy is also scheduled to visit Tirupati in Andhra Pradesh and Suttur Mutt near Mysore.

 Senior Gowda and his second son, H.D. Revanna, left the state capital yesterday for a visit to Kanchi and then to Kalahasti in Andhra. They are expected to return tonight.

 BJP deputy chief minister-designate B.S. Yediyurappa also visited the Suttur Mutt and sought the blessings of the swamiji there.

 Sources here said only Kumaraswamy and Yediyurappa are likely to take oath on February 3. A senior BJP leader said a full-fledged Dal (S)-BJP ministry will be formed after the new chief minister moves the vote of confidence on February 10.

 The reason for not naming the full team on February 3 is the fear that the Congress may orchestrate a revolt by those ignored a berth, insiders said.

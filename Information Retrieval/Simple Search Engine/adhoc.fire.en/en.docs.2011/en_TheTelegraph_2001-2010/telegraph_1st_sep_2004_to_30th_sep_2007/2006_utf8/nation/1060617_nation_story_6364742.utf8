The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Do it now sermon replayed

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, June 16: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today told CPM ministers to perform and not dilly-dally with development work. 

 There cannot be any letup?. Every minister should ensure that the department is being run transparently and smoothly. Work should be done fast, he said at the state party headquarters on Alimuddin Street. 

 The open discussion was organised at the insistence of the chief minister, who had said after being sworn in six years ago that his governments motto should be do it now. 

 The need for the meeting today possibly underlined that not much has changed since then. 

 In the presence of state CPM secretary Biman Bose, Bhattacharjee told his colleagues during the two-hour meeting that performance should be the buzzword for the seventh Left Front government. 

 He also hinted at a half-yearly evaluation of their performance. 

 The CPM won 35 more seats in this years Assembly elections compared with 2001, largely riding on the chief ministers pro-development slogan. 

 He said today: quot;We should remember that the verdict demands work and good performance. Dont forget that our responsibility has increased manifold.

 Keeping in mind complaints that the ministers hardly visit their constituencies and stay put in the city, he said: We will have to go to the people repeatedly and tell them what we have done and what we havent. We must be transparent. 

 Draw up a priority list of activities to be undertaken.

 Sources said Bhattacharjee refused to accept arguments from some veteran colleagues that bureaucratic hurdles delayed work. We will have to perform on time, whatever the odds. Dont forget that you are committed to the people to deliver the goods, he said. 

 Five ministers, all holding education-related portfolios, were denied nomination for this years election by the CPM apparently because of lack of performance. 

 Information technology minister Manab Mukherjee was shifted to cottage and small-scale industries also because Bhattacharjee was not happy with his work. 

 Finance minister Asim Dasgupta, transport minister Subhas Chakraborty and health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra were also under pressure, but they managed to retain their berths, allegedly after some intense lobbying.

 Nawabs archway at mercy of autos

 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY

 Fading glory: Rumi Darwaza

 Lucknow, July 3: Once it was the proud gateway to the City of Nawabs, its recessed arches, ornate cupola and floral motifs welcoming the Awadh kings as they returned to their palaces to the sound of a hundred hoofbeats.

 Today, you can almost feel the 222-year-old Rumi Darwaza tremble when the autorickshaws and motorcycles pass under the arches. A mini-truck last year hit one of the pillars, leaving a gash on the gates eastern face.

 Late 19th-century travellers had described the stretch between the Darwaza and Chattar Manzil as one of the most beautiful and spectacular cityscapes anywhere. 

 After Independence, the gate became the poster for Lucknow tourism.

 The monument was modelled on Istanbuls Sublime Porte ? a French translation of the Turkish b?bi?li ? which led to the Ottoman sultans palace. It was built during a long period of serial famines, so that a hungry population would have employment and food.

 The famed Bara Imambara had come up a few years earlier, also during the famines, which struck soon after the nawab of Awadh, Asaf-ud-Daula, had shifted his capital from Faizabad to Lucknow in 1755. 

 In 1784, the nawab commissioned Turkish designers to embellish the western gateway to the Imambara, turning it into the spectacular Rumi Darwaza.

 Now cracks have appeared across the monument. A portion of the cupola has fallen off with the peeling plaster, and pollution has repainted the gate a dirty shade of brown.

 The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) says its efforts at repairs are being hobbled by the Hussainabad Trust, the monuments custodian, and the state government.

 We had asked the state government to divert traffic to prolong the Darwazas life. Its as unsafe for the drivers and passengers as for the monument, because the vibration caused by the traffic has been worsening the gates condition, said S.N. Keshwarwani, the ASI superintending archaeologist.

 After prolonged persuasion ? and the truck accident ? heavy vehicles have been banned but the autos and motorbikes are still being allowed in.

 Its difficult to divert every kind of vehicle; residents have been protesting against it, an official said.

 The constant traffic, other than polluting the area, is also slowing down the restoration. Also, the work is going down the drain because the vibrations are causing even the patchwork to fall off, complained another ASI official.

 Hussainabad Trust members are, however, unhappy with the ASIs work. 

 The ASI has failed to replicate some of the intricate designs where cracks have appeared. They are taking too long over the job, yet its no match for the original, a member said.

 Showcause

 The Maharashtra government has served a showcause notice on Venkateshwara Hatcheries because eight samples that tested positive from Navapur were originally sourced from the company, chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh said.

 The Pune-based plant of the firm is a leading supplier of chicks to farmers in Navapur. 

 The farmers keep the chicks with them for up to 72 weeks, during which also the birds could have contracted the disease. 

 No one from Venkateshwara Hatcheries was available for comment.

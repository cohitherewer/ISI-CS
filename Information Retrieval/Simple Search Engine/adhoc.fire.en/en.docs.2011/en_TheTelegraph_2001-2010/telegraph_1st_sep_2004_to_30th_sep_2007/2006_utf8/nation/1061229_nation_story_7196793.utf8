 Maternity bonus hike

 New Delhi, Dec. 28 (PTI): A bill to enhance the medical bonus under the maternity benefit law from Rs 250 to Rs 1,000 will be tabled in Parliament in the budget session.

 This was decided at a meeting of the Union cabinet, headed by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, here tonight.

 The cabinet approved the amendment of the Maternity Benefit Act, proposing to revise the medical bonus from Rs 250 to Rs 1,000, and decided to introduce the bill in the next Parliament session, an official spokesperson said.

 Under the proposed legislation, the Centre would have the power to revise the medical bonus from time to time under the 1961 act as the existing ceiling of Rs 250 was thought to be inadequate.

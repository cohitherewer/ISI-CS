 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 2: Attacks on Londons Underground and Mumbais local trains have prompted the security establishments of Britain and India to work together on protecting mass transit systems from terror strikes.

 Experts from the two sides will soon meet to thrash out a strategy to protect national infrastructure, external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee said after wrapping up a meeting with British foreign secretary Margaret Beckett, who is on a week-long visit to India.

 We discussed strengthening cooperation in counter-terrorism and have agreed to a meeting of our experts in the area of protection of critical national infrastructure such as the mass transit system.

 The hour-long meeting saw a comprehensive review of the situation in Indias neighbourhood, including Pakistan.

 Left family secrets, a tip for Mamata

 ANINDYA SENGUPTA

 Calcutta, Feb. 14: For secrets of seat-sharing bliss, consult Alimuddin Street.

 Such posters ? like tuition centres promising exam success ? have not appeared yet, but it might be helpful for Mamata Banerjee and the Congress, struggling to work out an electoral understanding, to know that for nearly 30 years the Left Fronts seat-sharing formula has remained stable.

 Six Assembly elections have taken place, counting 1977 when the Left started its uninterrupted reign. Except for minor adjustments, the CPM and its partners have contested the same number of seats. Its not going to be any different this time. 

 Call it subservience to Big Brother or the CPMs benevolence towards its junior partners, but the secret of the Lefts success lies in this stable relationship.

 Contrast this also with the games other parties play in Bengal and elsewhere while negotiating seat shares with partners, where the objective on either side often is to cheat the other. In the Assembly polls in Bihar, the Congress had serious problems with Lalu Prasad on seat adjustment, finally leading to defeat as Ram Vilas Paswan could not be made a part of the axis.

 In Jharkhand, the Congress and Lalu Prasad could not even agree to fight together.

 Back in Bengal, when Mamata negotiates seat allocation with the BJP, the effort always is to dump the losing constituencies on the weaker partner. In 2001, a similar tug-of-war was seen between Mamata and the Congress, with the Trinamul leader insisting on 80 per cent of the seats.

 Not so with the CPM, the stronger constituent of the front by some margin. Nor have smaller parties, like the CPI, Forward Bloc and RSP, made absurd demands, leveraging their status as crucial ? though minor ? partners.

 If anything, it is the CPMs share that has fluctuated at times. For instance, in 1977 it had contested 224 seats, but five years later in order to accommodate the CPI, which was given 12, it made the highest sacrifice.

 In 1991, it gave up some more for new allies like the Samajwadi Party and Janata Dal, its share dropping to 204.

 For the two elections that took place after 1991, the shares have stayed almost unchanged. 

 According to a junior front partner, the stability is primarily a result of the CPMs belief in a rainbow coalition Jyoti Basu first put together, realising that his party alone would not be able to win an election on its own.

 Did he have a magic touch? Basu replied: We have always stressed on unity and thats the reason. These days I hear about grumbling in the front. But thats not a problem at all. Biman (Bose, the front chairman) is there to handle such things.

 There are often differences of opinion ? at times quite strong ? among the partners, but these have never got in the way of a stable electoral relationship. The stability is quite amazing, a reason perhaps why the smaller partners have not felt dissatisfied. Between 1977 and 2001, the Forward Blocs share of seats has changed from 36 to 34 and the RSPs has remained static at 23. 

 The allies didnt ask for more seats because of their lack of strength and the CPM didnt flex its muscles despite being in a position to do so.

 Senior RSP leader and former minister Kshiti Goswami said: It is this cohesion that helped us sail through every general election. Theres no denying the fact that we couldnt have won in some constituencies without the CPMs help. Our Kerala comrades wonder how we have stuck to this arrangement since 1977.

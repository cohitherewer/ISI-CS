 1242 riot cases dug up

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Ahmedabad, Feb. 8: The Gujarat government has reopened 1,242 riot cases since September 2004.

 State police officials said the action-taken report on reopening of the cases related to the 2002 violence will be filed before the Supreme Court in a few weeks.

 Gujarat director-general of police A.K. Bhargava said his force has been reopening new cases every day since the apex court directed the state government to form a committee, headed by the police chief, to take a fresh look at those that had been closed.

 Every three months we are reporting the progress to the court, the police chief added.

 The court had directed the BJP-led government to file progress reports on the riot investigations ? which have become mired in charges of political interference and cover-ups ? every three months.

 Of the 4,200-odd riot cases in which first information reports were filed, the state police had closed over 2,000, many of them on the ground that the suspects could not be found.

 The National Human Rights Commission had challenged the move in the apex court, which directed the state government to set up the 10-member probe committee.

 During a recent hearing, the government had told the court that it has filed 13 new cases in connection with the violence that flared after a mob set fire to the Sabarmati Express on February 27, 2002, killing nearly 60 people. The bloodbath that followed claimed more than a thousand lives.

 The Gujarat administration has also initiated action against 39 police officers for mishandling the violence that flared after the Sabarmati Express incident in Godhra. 

 This is the first time we will initiate a departmental inquiry against investigating officers who failed to carry on the probe of riot cases, Bhargava said.

 The police chief said that while some officers closed cases without any investigation, others failed to record witness statements or seize important evidence.

 If found guilty, the officers could face suspension.

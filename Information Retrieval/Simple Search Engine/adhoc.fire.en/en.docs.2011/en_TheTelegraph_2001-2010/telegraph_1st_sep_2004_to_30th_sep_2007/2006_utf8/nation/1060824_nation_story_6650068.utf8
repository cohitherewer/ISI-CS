 Israel emissary with Lebanon balm 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Ben-Ami: Damage control

 New Delhi, Aug. 23: Israels former foreign minister Shlomo Ben-Ami is in the capital trying to explain his countrys position on the offensive against Lebanon.

 Relations between Tel Aviv and New Delhi were tested in the weeks since Israel launched the attack. The month-long military conflict with Hizbollah guerrillas in south Lebanon killed several hundred people.

 The Indian Parliament had passed a resolution denouncing the Israeli assault. The ministry of external affairs also made its disapproval known to the Israeli diplomats based in Delhi.

 In an effort to allay apprehensions and control the damage to the ties, Ben-Ami met Anand Sharma and E. Ahmed, the two junior external affairs ministers, to explain Israels position. He is also scheduled to deliver a lecture at the Jawaharlal Nehru University tomorrow.

 In his interactions, Ben-Ami brushed aside fears that the strong position taken by India would affect bilateral relations, which have expanded to cooperation in several strategic areas. 

 However, he suggested that there should be a better understanding of the complexities of the situation. India, he emphasised, needed to fully understand the sensibilities of Israel. 

 We understand the sensitivities of Indian public opinion, the countrys friendship with the Arab world and its commitment to the Palestinian cause. But this should be tempered by a better understanding of the realities on the ground and the complexities of the situation, said Ben-Ami, whose talks went beyond the conflict and extended to a review of the overall progress in the multi-faceted ties.

 Ben-Ami, Israels foreign minister in 2000, had participated with Prime Minister Ehud Barak in the Camp David summit. He has also led the Israeli team in almost all negotiations with the Palestinians. He was even part of the secret parleys with former Palestinian Prime Minister Ahmed Qurie, also known as Abu-Ala, in Stockholm. 

 At present, Ben-Ami is the vice-president of the Toledo International Center for Peace, a think-tank that explores methods of conflict management. 

 Israel, Ben-Ami said, would not welcome international troops to its neighbourhood, where many countries do not have diplomatic ties with Tel Aviv. It also has fears that such a force would be biased. 

 Ben-Amis visit is aimed at dealing with the barrage of criticism from political parties in India to the military operation in Lebanon.

 So far, his discussions have been largely restricted to those within the ministry of external affairs. 

 In recent weeks, the Israeli embassys attempts to reach out to political parties evoked little response. But Ben-Ami did manage to win an audience with BJP stalwarts L.K. Advani and Jaswant Singh.

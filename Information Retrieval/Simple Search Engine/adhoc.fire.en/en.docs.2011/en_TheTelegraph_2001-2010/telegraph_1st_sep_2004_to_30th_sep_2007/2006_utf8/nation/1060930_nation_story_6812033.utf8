 Blow to UNI deal

 New Delhi, Sept. 29: Delhi High Court today put on hold for the next few days any move that UNI stakeholders might consider to consolidate their hold on the news agency, reports our bureau.

 Three days back, Zees Subhash Chandra and three of his associates had joined the board of directors of the UNI. 

 The move came amid controversy with some stakeholders protesting that the transfer of shares to Essel Group Zees parent company was done without the knowledge of all board members.

 The court has now ordered status quo till October 5 when it will hear a petition filed by Bhopal-based Dainik Sandhya Prakashan.

 The newspaper had sought a permanent injunction restraining the UNI chairman from issuing the shares to any company as the deal was not transparent.

 It also wanted a directive to the registrar of companies to not register the illegally allotted shares to Mediavest India which was acquiring them for Essel Group, which also owns in part Daily News and Analysis newspaper.

 Justice Rekha Sharma has asked the UNI chairman and other respondents to file their replies to the charges by October 5.

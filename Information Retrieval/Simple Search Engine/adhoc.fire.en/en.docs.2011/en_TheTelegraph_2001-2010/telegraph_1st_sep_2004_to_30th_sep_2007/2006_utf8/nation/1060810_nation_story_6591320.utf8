 Rs 50000-rap on beauty parlour for hair-razing experience

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 IN RIGHT HANDS?

 New Delhi, Aug. 9: A beauty 

 tip.... from the court.

 Its not enough to just choose the way you want your hair to look. Its also important to choose the right beauty parlour and the beautician who attends to you.

 Or you might end up with a lot of hair out of place literally.

 It happened to a woman who went to an east Delhi beauty parlour to get her hair straightened and dyed, and lost much of her locks.

 Now, after eight years of hair splitting, a city consumer court has awarded her Rs 50,000 as compensation for the hair-razing experience.

 In its verdict, the court warned customers against going to parlours that might not have trained beauticians.

 On April 5, 1998, Kumkum, in her late 30s, had walked into a parlour near her residence. 

 I had no idea I would end up losing much of my hair, she said, finally happy after winning her eight-year battle for beauty treatment to be recognised as a consumer service.

 The court, under the Delhi state commission for consumer rights, said apart from suffering physical and mental agony, she lost half of her hair which she had painstakingly grown for the last so many years.

 For Kumkum, though, it was more painstaking to receive the adequate compensation.

 I had been awarded Rs 5,000 by a district consumer court. I was not satisfied, so I went to the state-level court, she said. 

 The erring parlour Sindoor Beauty Salon had said in the court that Kumkum alone was responsible for losing her hair. 

 Straightening and dyeing hair require unnatural practices ironing, using chemicals, etc. which can be dangerous, the parlour said. Kumkum, the parlour maintained, should have been prepared for the risk involved.

 But Justice J.D. Kapoor and commission member Rumnitta Mittal blamed the parlour. It (the parlours plea) is simply not acceptable. It is highly precarious, unacceptable and dubious, the ruling said.

 The court blasted the parlour for first having treated Kumkums hair and then claiming it was not safe to do so. It (the straightening and dyeing) should not have been done if there was a perception of risk on the part of the beautician, the court said. 

 The parlour and Dhiren, the beautician who treated Kumkums hair, have been asked to pay the compensation jointly and severally, which means either the parlour or the beautician can pay her the whole amount and settle it later with the other.

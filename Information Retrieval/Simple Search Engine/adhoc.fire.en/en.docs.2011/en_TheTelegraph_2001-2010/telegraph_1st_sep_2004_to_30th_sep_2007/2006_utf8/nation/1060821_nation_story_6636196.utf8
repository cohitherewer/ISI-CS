 Natwar flutter at Cong meet

 Chennai, Aug. 20 (PTI): Suspended Congress leader Natwar Singh today created a flutter and earned the wrath of partymen by entering the venue of a function here to mark the birth anniversary of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi.

 Noticing Natwar Singh enter the Kamaraj auditorium here, senior PMK leader G.K. Mani, who was addressing the gathering, announced that Singh had entered.

 Singh was ignored by Congressmen present but paid floral tributes to the departed leader and left.

 Addressing the gathering later, the partys observer for Tamil Nadu Veerappa Moily, without naming Singh, said some people had had the audacity to enter the function uninvited.

 Attacking Singh for levelling charges against the Prime Minister, Moily alleged that some people had exploited the partys name for personal gain.

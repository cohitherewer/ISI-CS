 We are following the developments. We are on positive path.

 I hope Germany can use its influence in support of India being given the treatment that the US has promised, Singh had told reporters before the meeting.

 If the process continues as it is doing now in the US Congress, then Germany is willing to cooperate, she added. We have not reached the end of the process.

 Citing Indias record of non-proliferation, the Singh said cooperation with New Delhi in civil nuclear energy will not run any risk of unauthorised proliferation.

 Joint ventures for revamp

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi, Jan. 31: Under the conditions of the contract awarded to the two private consortiums to modernise Delhi and Mumbai airports, the Airports Authority of India will immediately receive Rs 150 crore as deposit from each.

 GMR-Fraport, which has won the Delhi contract, and GVK-South Africa Airport, which has bagged Mumbai, will now form joint venture companies with the Airports Authority of India (AAI).

 AAI, which is owned by the government, will hold 26 per cent of the equity in the joint venture while the private partner will have 74 per cent.

 Both the winning consortiums have an Indian and a foreign element. For instance, while GMR is a south India-based company, it has a tie-up with Fraport, which runs the Frankfurt airport. Similarly, GVK is the Indian partner for South Africa Airport.

 Praful Patel, the civil aviation minister, said the money the government receives from revenue sharing with the joint venture companies for the two airports would be used to modernise airports in non-metropolitan cities.

 For Delhi, GMR has agreed to give the government 45.99 per cent of the revenue each year. GVK has offered 38.7 per cent of the revenue that is to be earned from Mumbai airport.

 The first phase of modernisation, to be completed by 2010, will cost Rs 2,800 crore in Delhi and Rs 2,400 crore in Mumbai. 

 Patel brushed aside allegations of deviation from tender conditions by some of the losing bidders, the key among them being Reliance Airport Developers of Anil Ambani. 

 The minister said after the final evaluation, GMR was the sole qualified bidder and it matched the highest bid for Delhi airport.

 If Reliance was the aggrieved loser in Delhi, Sterlite (now known as Vedanta) took the role in Mumbai.

 Company spokesperson Dhanpal Jhaveri told PTI that we are deeply disappointed that our bid for Mumbai was not opened.? We had bid substantially higher than the highest bidder (GVK).

 We fail to understand as to why only our bid was not opened, he said, keeping the legal option open.

 An ecstatic GVK said: We are awaiting word from the government. 

 The Subhash Chandra-promoted Essel Group, which had bid for both Delhi and Mumbai airports, expressed disappointment that its offers were not opened, but ruled out legal recourse.

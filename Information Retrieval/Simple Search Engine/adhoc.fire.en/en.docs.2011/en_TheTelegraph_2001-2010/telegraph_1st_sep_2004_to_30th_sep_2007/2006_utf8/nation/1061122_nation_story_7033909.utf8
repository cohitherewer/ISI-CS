 Renu eyes Rabri slot

 Ajit Jogi with his wife Renu

 New Delhi, Nov. 21: Renu Jogi would be Chhattisgarhs Rabri Devi if husband Ajit Jogi out in the cold after successive setbacks has his way, and the voters oblige.

 Jogi, a former chief minister, sees the December 4 byelection to the Kota Assembly seat, which Renu is contesting, as his biggest hope to return to active politics in Chhattisgarh.

 Confined to a wheelchair after a road accident two and a half years ago, Jogi is now only a Lok Sabha MP and a permanent invitee to the Congress Working Committee. The accident and his son Amits arrest in a murder case had cast a cloud on the bureaucrat-turned-politicians future.

 So, Renus nomination is already seen as a success for Jogi because he fought against the states powerful Brahmin lobby to secure it. The Kota seat, which is in Bilaspur district, is a Congress stronghold (the party lost here just once) and the victor has always been a Brahmin. 

 The bypoll became necessary after sitting MLA Rajendra Prasad Shukla, a former Speaker, died. 

 Congress treasurer Motilal Vora, also from Chhattisgarh, reportedly rooted for Shuklas son Sunil. It is the partys tradition to give a seat vacated because of a members death to the next of kin, a source close to Vora said.

 Vora, who is supposed to have Sonia Gandhis ears, had so far succeeded in marginalising Jogi in Chhattisgarh by getting his nominee, Charan Das Mahant, appointed as state Congress president.

 This time Madams (Sonia Gandhi) hand blessed Jogi, said a source close to him. A more realistic report is that Jogis supporters persuaded Sunil to stay put at home and not venture out into the Kota minefield. 

 Sources close to Jogi as well as those in Voras camp admitted that the Congresss strength had dwindled in Kota despite the Brahmin factor. In the last two Assembly elections, Shukla scraped through with a 1000-plus margin. In the 2004 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP had established a substantial lead over the Congress in Kota. 

 Renu, a practising ophthalmologist until recently, had conducted several eye camps in Kota when Jogi was posted as a district collector in Bilaspur. 

 Jogi Dongri, the village the Jogis come from, also falls in this constituency. It was the former chief ministers first choice for himself but Vora and others reportedly scuttled his chances of contesting from Kota, which has a tribal population of over 40 per cent.

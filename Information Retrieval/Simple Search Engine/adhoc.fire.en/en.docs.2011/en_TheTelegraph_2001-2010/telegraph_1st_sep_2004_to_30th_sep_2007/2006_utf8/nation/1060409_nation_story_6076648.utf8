 Deal eludes SBI, states tap other banks 

 OUR BUREAU

 April 8: Talks to end the State Bank of India strike hit a wall tonight, capping a flurry of action during the day that saw several state governments switching to other banks as a temporary arrangement.

 Hopes of a settlement by the evening was run- ning high earlier with the unions nudging down their demand for raising the pension ceiling.

 The bank employees, who initially wanted 50 per cent of last drawn salary as pension up to the general managers rank, were willing to limit it to the level of the assistant general manager (Scale V). 

 At present, the pension cannot exceed Rs 4,250 a month, irrespective of the rank. Unconfirmed reports said the unions were also willing to accept a ceiling of Rs 13,000 a month, instead of their original demand to raise the limit to Rs 16,000.

 The government said it was prepared to raise the pension, but only up to a reasonable limit.

 The unions held two rounds of negotiations with SBI chairman A.K. Purwar in Mumbai. 

 Our second round of talks with the management failed at the entry-level itself as the government refused to negotiate on our toned-down proposal, the All India SBI Staff Federation secretary, P.K. Patnaik, said.

 The management was very considerate. But it is the Union finance minister who rejected our proposal. He should be held responsible for the imbroglio, he said.

 Patnaik claimed that the finance ministry offered less than Rs 10,000 as pension, which was below the clerical level.

 The government said it would not accept anything that would create asymmetry in retirement benefits between SBI and other public sector banks.

 Among public sector banks, only SBI employees are eligible to triple retirement benefits ? contributory provident fund, gratuity and pension. Other bank employees get only gratuity and either pension or contributory provident fund.

 A union leader said the next option was to go on a hunger strike. More unions of other banks were already showing solidarity to the strike and expected to join us.

 The United Forum of Bank Unions has announced that it would meet in Chennai on April 11 to take a decision on going on a nationwide one-day strike in support of the SBI employees.

 Apologising for the inconvenience to the banks customers, the All India State Bank Officers Federation president, Amar Pal, said: The employees wanted to end the strike in public interest. However, the government does not seem to be interested in finding a solution.

 At least four state governments have shifted their transactions to other public sector banks. The states that have tapped other banks so far are Maharashtra, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.

 The RBI has given in-principle clearance to the Maharashtra government to transfer its treasury account to other nationalised banks. Most government transactions, including salary payments, are carried out through SBI.

 The states have said the current wave of transfers is only a temporary measure. But the trend carries an ominous portent for SBI, a big chunk of whose business comes from government accounts.

 If state governments demand a right to keep their options open to avoid a replay of the situation caused by the ongoing strike, it will hurt SBI badly.

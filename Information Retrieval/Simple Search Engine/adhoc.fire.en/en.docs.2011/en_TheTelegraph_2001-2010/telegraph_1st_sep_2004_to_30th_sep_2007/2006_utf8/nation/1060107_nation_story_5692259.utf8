 Rajnath bows to spiritual guide

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Jan. 6: Rajnath Singh, the new BJP president, said the party always looked for ideological guidance from the Sangh on a day his predecessor regretted his decision to take back his resignation over the Jinnah controversy.

 Some observers interpreted Singhs statement that the Sangh has been our spiritual and ideological guiding force as an indication of the new president ploughing a different furrow from the one cut by Lal Krishna Advani.

 There are no two views about it. I think there has been a problem in communication. Nobody in the BJP believes that we have an ideological problem with the RSS, Singh said.

 It so happened that earlier in the day it was revealed that Advani had told a magazine that he regretted withdrawing his resignation after the Jinnah controversy erupted this summer, with the Sangh baying for his blood.

 In a way, the expression of regret for having changed his mind was a re-assertion of his position on Jinnah, whom he had described as a politician who was secular to start with, and Pakistan, which he called an inevitable fact of history.

 Advani, clearly, was not ready to bow to the Sangh after having bowed out of the BJP.

 The former BJP presidents entire effort was aimed at distancing the party from the extreme position of the Sangh on Hindutva.

 He had also tried to assert that the BJP could take its decisions independently of the Sangh. 

 Advani has said: An impression has been created that the BJP cannot take an independent decision without the RSS endorsing it. We are making efforts from both sides to correct this impression.

 Rajnath did not comment on Advanis statements, but he said the BJP looked up to RSS all the time for ideological inspiration. 

 We consult the Sangh the way one consults a family member. There is no diktat or a whip. We are like-minded people who discuss issues with each other. I dont think there is a problem, he said. 

 Rajnaths statement does not constitute a contradiction of Advanis stand, but it is being seen as the new presidents first assertive step.

 School casts out HIV boy

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Hyderabad, Dec. 12: On Childrens Day, four-year-old Vamsikrishna was given a prize for being the brightest boy in his play school. Yesterday, he was asked to leave because he is HIV positive.

 Not that the school had a problem with Vamsi. But the parents of his classmates kicked up a storm and threatened to pull out their children if Vamsi wasnt thrown out.

 Yesterday, the school teacher called me and asked me to take my son elsewhere as parents of other children in the locality were objecting, Vamsis mother Jayalakshmi, 21, said today.

 The school is in Alwal, on the outskirts of Hyderabad, and is run under the aegis of the Andhra women and child welfare department. But there was little it could do, trapped as it was like the Kerala school that had to recently turn out five HIV orphans after similar protests.

 I dont mind keeping Vamsi in the school because he is the best boy of the lot. But I cannot convince the parents and other people in the locality, his teacher B. Swaroopa said.

 A routine medical check-up by a voluntary agency last week had thrown up Vamsi as HIV positive.

 Jayalakshmi did not conceal her sons condition when Swaroopa gave her the ultimatum. But she pleaded that injustice not be done to her little one. I have nowhere to go. I cannot afford the fees of other schools which are willing to accept my boy, she said.

 The teacher, however, said her hands were tied. Either send the HIV boy away or we will take our children elsewhere, B. Sudhakar, the father of Vamsis best friend Murali, is believed to have told her.

 Vamsis father Ganesh, a toddy seller, died of AIDS when the boy was barely one. The family lived in Bowenpally area till word about their ailment spread and people began ostracising them.

 Soon after, Jayalakshmi, also HIV positive, was forced to give up working as a domestic help and move to Alwal. I was not given any work by anyone after people came to know that my husband was an AIDS patient, she said.

 Since then, she has been working as a daily wager in a packaging unit in Alwal. Things had been peaceful because people had not known she and her son were HIV positive.

 Now, however, the workers community is up in arms against them. The hostility is so severe that the duo was not able to come out of their hut for a long time yesterday.

 For the moment, two NGOs Nrityanjali and Agathi have taken the duo under their wing. Vamsi has been admitted to a pre-school run by Agathi.

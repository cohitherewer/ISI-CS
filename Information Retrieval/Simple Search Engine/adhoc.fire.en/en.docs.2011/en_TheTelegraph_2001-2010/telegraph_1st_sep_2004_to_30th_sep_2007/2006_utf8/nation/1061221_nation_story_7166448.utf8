 Amritsar, Dec. 20: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today shared his vision of an India and Pakistan minus rancour or hostility, but sharing a rapport that would enable inking of a treaty of peace, friendship and security.

 Welcoming the four-point formula floated by Pervez Musharraf to resolve the Kashmir dispute last week, Singh said if both sides worked with an open and friendly mind, it would be possible to realise his vision.

 I am sure we can overcome all hurdles in our path and realise such a treaty. It will become the instrument and the basis for enduring peace and prosperity in the region, he said at a rally.

 The need of the hour was for both countries to put the past behind and think about their collective destiny that would ensure a better future for the people, he said.

 The destinies of our two nations are inter-linked. We need to think about our collective destiny where both neighbours can work jointly towards a better future. If our minds are determined and focused on this goal, I am confident this destiny can be achieved.

 In a reference to Musharrafs suggestions for demilitarisation and joint management of an undivided Kashmir, Singh said new ideas and thoughts expressed from Pakistan had been taken note of and were being worked on.

 We welcome all ideas as they contribute to the ongoing thought process. If both sides approach the issues with an open and friendly mind it will be possible for us to resolve all pending issues through a dialogue process.

 This is the third time Singh is visiting Amritsar since he became Prime Minister in 2004. Although the focus of his speech was peace in Kashmir, he did not overlook the destiny of his hometown.

 Stating that Amritsar had lost its glory after Partition, he said the city that was once a major trade point connecting India with the rest of the world was now not much more than a border town.

 I am confident that if we continue on the path of peace, Amritsar can once again regain its glory as a major centre of trade and commerce. This is not a dream. It can be a reality. 

 He said a peace treaty with Pakistan was essential to develop border regions. Residents of Amritsar, Gurdaspur and Ferozepur have been facing a lot of difficulty. If we are able to increase our trade and commercial relations with Pakistan, these deprived areas would certainly benefit.

 Singh was here for the inauguration of a water supply scheme. He also laid the foundation stone for the four-laning of the 35-km Amritsar-Wagah highway and announced the upgrade of the Wagah international checkpost and Attari railway station.

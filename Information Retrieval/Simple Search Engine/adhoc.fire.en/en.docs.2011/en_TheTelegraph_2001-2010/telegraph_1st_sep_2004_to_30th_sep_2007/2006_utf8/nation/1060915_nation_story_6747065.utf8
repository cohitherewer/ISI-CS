 Riot CD probe

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Ahmedabad, Sept. 14: Two cyber experts from the Gujarat forensic science laboratory will examine CDs that could reveal whether politicians and policemen were in touch over mobile phones with rioters during the 2002 carnage.

 G.S. Khandelwal and H.P. Singhvi will examine the CDs that reportedly contain the phone numbers of chief minister Narendra Modi and his cabinet colleagues. 

 The state government has doubts about the authenticity of the CDs, handed in by former IPS officer Rahul Sharma. The then DGP is also believed to have been named. 

 The government suggested the names of the two experts to the Nanavati Commission probing the Godhra train fire and the mayhem after it. 

 The demand to scan the CDs, which list all cellphone numbers in use in Gujarat in February-March 2002, was raised by Mukul Sinha of the Jansangharsh Manch.

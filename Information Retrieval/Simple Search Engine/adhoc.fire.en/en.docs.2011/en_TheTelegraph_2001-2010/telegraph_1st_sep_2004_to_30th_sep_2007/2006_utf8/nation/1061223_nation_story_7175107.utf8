 Blame on troop panic for 2 deaths 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Srinagar, Dec. 22: The north Kashmir town of Sopore saw massive protests today after two persons were shot dead, allegedly by soldiers who panicked at a noise from their own vehicle.

 The security forces said the slain civilians were caught in the crossfire as the army fought off militants, who had fired from automatic weapons on the convoy.

 There was no attack on the army, said Ghulam Nabi, a local vendor. While the convoy was passing, the metal cover (used as a shield) on one of the vehicles fell off near a speed-breaker with a loud clang. Immediately, soldiers from many of the vehicles opened indiscriminate fire.

 But the deputy inspector-general of police (north Kashmir range) had a different version of events.

 Militants attacked the convoy near the State Bank causing injuries to four army jawans, Mohammed Subhan Lone said. Two civilians were killed in the gunfight and seven others, including four army jawans, were injured.

 Residents, however, said Shabir Ahmad Khan and Mohammed Ashraf Bhat were killed at the busy Iqbal market, several hundred meters from the spot mentioned by the police.

 As thousands took to the streets, shouting slogans against the security forces, the police fired in the air to disperse the mob.

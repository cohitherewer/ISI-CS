The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Business lobby calls Buddha to US

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, June 12: The US-India Business Council, a sub-group of the American Chamber of Commerce, has invited chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee to the country to showcase Bengal as an investment destination.

 Why only America? I want to travel the whole world (looking for investment), Bhattacharjee said this evening, when asked whether he was going to the US.

 The groundwork for a possible trip was laid by chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb and commerce and industries secretary Sabyasachi Sen, who met representatives of several US companies and manufacturing associations in addition to the US-India Business Council and made presentations on opportunities in Bengal. 

 The chief ministers office had earlier said he wouldnt go to the US to woo investors. 

 A US business delegation is likely to visit Bengal around October.

 They wanted to know what incentives and infrastructure support the state would offer them. They were also interested in our public sector reforms. We can discuss all that in detail and tell them how we can help them once they are here, Sen said.

 The Bengal duo also spoke to mid-level Boeing officials. Boeing has a strong commitment to have a maintenance, repairing and operations base in India. Well try to get them to establish an aircraft repairing facility near the airport. If it happens near Dum Dum, well have to do it in collaboration with the Airports Authority of India, Sen said.

 Hyderabad, Bangalore and Nagpur, which are building their second airports, are also in the fray.

 The Boeing officials told us that they havent decided on their base. They are interested in doing more business in India in addition to the maintenance, repairing and operations base, Sen added.

 The officials also made a presentation on the proposed chemical hub at Haldia before 29 US petro-chemical companies. Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Orissa and Gujarat also took part in the conference.

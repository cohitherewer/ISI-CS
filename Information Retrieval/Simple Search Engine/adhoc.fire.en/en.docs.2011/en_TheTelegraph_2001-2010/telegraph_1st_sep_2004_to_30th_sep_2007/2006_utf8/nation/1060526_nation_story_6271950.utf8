 Nuke deal

 London, May 25 (PTI): Amid optimism over the passage of the civilian nuclear deal in the US Congress, India today said some work still needed to be done to ensure the approval. 

 During a meeting to review progress on the deal, foreign secretary Shyam Saran handed over a draft of the proposed bilateral agreement on civil nuclear cooperation to US under-secretary of state Nicholas Burns, highlighting Delhis commitment to unilateral moratorium on nuclear testing.

 (Burns) gave me an account of where it stands (in Congress). There is still work to be done, Saran said after the meeting. He, however, added that the outlook was positive and encouraging. 

 Saran said Burns told him that secretary of state Condoleezza Rice was trying to see the deal through Congress.

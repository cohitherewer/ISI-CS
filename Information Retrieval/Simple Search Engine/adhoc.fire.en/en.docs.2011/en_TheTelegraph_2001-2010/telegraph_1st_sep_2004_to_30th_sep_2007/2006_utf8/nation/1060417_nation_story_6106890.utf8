 Orissa works on relief package

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, April 16: Three months and a half after the Kalinga Nagar police firing, the Orissa government is set to offer villagers uprooted by industry a new relief package that it hopes will mitigate tribal anger.

 The government has announced that the revised rehabilitation policy will be in place by next week. Fifty-three tribals from the Kalinga Nagar industrial area turned up at a meeting of a committee of ministers to place their wishlist.

 The committee was formed after 13 tribals were killed in police firing on January 2 while protesting against civil construction on farmland that Tata Steel had bought from the state to build a steel mill.

 A tribal organisation, the Bisthapan Birodhi Janmanch, is still blocking the Daitari-Paradip highway connecting the iron mines to Paradip port. The government hopes the new rehabilitation package would mollify them and provide a fillip to the process of industrialisation in the state.

 The government, however, needs to negotiate a set of tricky demands placed yesterday by panchayat representatives from Sukinda and Dangadi blocks of Kalinga Nagar area. The delegation didnt include any member of the Janmanch.

 The 25-point charter of demands includes:

 10 per cent of plants profits for the displaced

 Compensation of Rs 2.5 lakh per acre of land acquired

 Job guarantee without age limit

 Two-room house with kitchen and toilet or Rs 1.5 lakh in cash

 Double the land now offered for resettlement

 Revenue minister Biswabhusan Harichandan said the committee would consider these demands as well as the views of the other stake-holders before it submits its recommendations next week.

 Jajpur collector Arabinda Padhee, who attended the meeting, said, We had requested even the Janmanch members to come and put their demands before the chief minister.

 The BJD Rajya Sabha member and key participant in the drafting of the policy, Pyarimohan Mohapatra, said the details of the relief should be left to the companies and village councils to sort out among themselves. The government should act only as an umpire.

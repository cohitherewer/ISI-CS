New Delhi, Dec. 5: The schedule of the 33rd National Games is under threat with several states reluctant to send sportspersons to Assam after the militant group Ulfa warned of disruptions.

 Although the official line is that there will be no bending down for fear of militants, sources in the ministry of youth affairs and sports do not rule out another postponement of the Games.

 It was to be held in October, now it is scheduled to be held in February. There is no constitutional binding that the National Games will have to be held in February, a senior official said. 

 The official, however, ruled out a change of venue.

 The outlawed United Liberation Front of Asom had first appealed to sportspersons across the country not to participate in the Games unless the Centre looks into its demands. It later demanded that the event be rechristened the Assam Sports Festival.

 Scheduled to begin with an inaugural programme in Guwahati on February 9, the Games are to close on February 18 in the presence of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. The Centre, therefore, is not willing to take any chances.

 New Delhi would like the Assam government and local organisations to come up with a strong statement on holding the Games on schedule. But Dispur is not yet ready preparations for the event are still on.

 Assam had earlier overshot the deadline for constructing the Games Village. Before it could finish, Ulfa had issued its threat.

 With most Indian Olympic Association (IOA) officials busy attending the Asian Games in Doha, attention is yet to focus on the National Games. IOA office-bearers said they have neither received any feedback from the state sports associations nor held any meeting on the Guwahati event.

 The official website is the only proof that the Games, at which over 8,000 sportspersons and officials are expected, are on.

 Writer Mamoni Raisom Goswami today called for the release of five jailed Ulfa leaders to negotiate a peaceful settlement of the impasse. Goswami said she was ready to stand guarantee that Ulfa would not disrupt the Games if the jailed leaders were released. 

 It is pretty disheartening for me to hear from sports enthusiasts here that sportspersons from other parts of the country are not willing to participate in the National Games following the Ulfa boycott call.

 My personal view is that the government should release the five jailed leaders in the interest of the Games. Besides, they are also ailing and need to be released on humanitarian grounds too, she said.

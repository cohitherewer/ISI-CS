 Junoon to Jolie, Pak singer looks to score

 IMTIAZ GUL

 Salman Ahmad: My constituency has no borders

 Islamabad, Oct. 24: Former Junoon band member Salman Ahmad is among the candidates being considered to do the music for A Mighty Heart, the Angelina Jolie-starrer on the life and death of US journalist Daniel Pearl.

 The Pakistani singer and musician, who is waiting for a response from Brad Pitts production company, says he wants his music to be recognised globally.

 Salman, a UN ambassador for AIDS awareness, has been a sort of cultural ambassador for his country and is becoming part of the Clinton Global Initiative.

 He had achieved stardom as a member of Junoon, which had shot up the popularity charts in India, too, before breaking up. Salman has since then been concentrating on his UN job and his own music, and has been shooting documentaries on social themes with the hope of changing the way the West perceives Pakistan.

 Salman has told the English-language newspaper, The News, that he has been in discussions with A Mighty Heart director Michael Winterbottom and Pitts production company.

 They have asked for my music and films and are short-listing their candidates for the project. A final decision will be made in January, he said.

 Naturally, Im very excited that they have considered my work among the other Hollywood music directors. Im hoping for a positive response.

 Salman, who has been involved in several events this year speaking about Islam and Pakistan, says he may not go into politics.

 I had cautioned Imran Khan some 10 years ago against going into politics because I thought he would have been far more effective pursuing social change in Pakistan through education and health reform, the singer said.

 Salman is far more comfortable representing Pakistan as an artist and activist. He says his constituency has no borders.

 I will be performing and speaking on media and culture in Pakistan in November for the international Young Presidents Organisation conference. Ill make another trip for a concert in December for UNAIDS.

 But a full-fledged Pakistan tour will not be possible before next year because of his international commitments.

 After being appointed UN ambassador, Salman had come out with a video, Alvida (goodbye), which dealt with contemporary issues. 

 He said his experience with the Clinton Global Initiative had been very inspiring and humbling.

 It was humbling because I was in the company of so many brilliant people from the world of media, art, business and politics, and inspiring because I had a chance to share my thoughts with a very powerful and influential audience.

 He said former US President Bill Clinton had invited him to be the sole artist on the members panel. President (Pervez) Musharraf and I were the only two Pakistani speakers.

 Asked how relevant CGI was to Pakistan and its development, he said some $7.3 billion had been allocated for projects around the world, and a part of it would be spent on health and poverty alleviation in Pakistan, India and Bangladesh.

 Credit card blot stays

 New Delhi, Aug. 13 (PTI): Delhi High Court has declined to modify a previous order that virtually indicted private bank ICICI for abetting the suicide of a youth who reportedly defaulted on his credit repayment.

 The court had said in its July 13 order that banks like ICICI cannot employ musclemen to recover loans.

 Now the court has also dismissed the banks application seeking the expunging of certain critical observations. Justice S.N. Agarwal, who had given the critical comments, said the observations were made consciously and there are no reasons to expunge them.

 Following a complaint by the mother of the deceased Himanshu Dev Sharma, Agarwal had observed that the proximate cause of death was on account of humiliation caused by the bank people from where loan was taken by him.

 The high court further observed that the modus operandi employed by banks like the ICICI for realisation of their loan amount and for recovering possession of the vehicle against which loan was given is extra-legal. 

 Agarwal said by no stretch of imagination can it be permitted to employ musclemen and goons for recovery of their dues even from a defaulting party.

 Stung by the observation, the ICICI bank moved an application pleading that the remarks be expunged. 

 Himanshu committed suicide on October 2005 after he was allegedly intimidated by agents employed by the bank.

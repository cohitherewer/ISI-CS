 Busted: Chautala treasure chest

 OUR BUREAU

Chandigarh/ New Delhi, May 4: The CBI has unearthed assets worth almost Rs 1,500 crore thought to be owned by Om Prakash Chautala and his family.

 Following raids on 24 places in six states today, CBI spokesperson G. Mohanty said the phenomenal extent of the wealth the accused appear to have accumulated warrants in-depth investigation.

 Raids were conducted at Palwal, Sirsa, Kurukshetra and Bhiwani in Haryana, on a 60-acre farm at Udham Singh Nagar in Uttaranchal and their Sector 9 residence in Chandigarh, apart from sites in Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Himachal Pradesh. Houses and offices of some Chautala aides were also searched. The raids were conducted to unearth Chautalas wealth, a CBI official said.

Evidence of extensive moveable assets and immoveable 

assets was found, according to the FIR which puts the value of all the properties 

at Rs 1,467 crore. 

 Chautala is in the US for treatment but a spokesman for his party, the Indian National Lok Dal, described the raids as political vendetta. (Chief minister Bhupinder Singh) Hooda is losing support very fast, he said.

 In the past, Chautala has said all the properties owned by him and his sons are disclosed in their income-tax returns and in the affidavits filed during elections. Any other properties the CBI finds in raids, it could keep, he said. 

 The CBI had registered the case against Chautala and others on April 3 on the request of the Congress government in Haryana.

 Before the February 2005 elections in the state, the Congress had brought out a 131-page chargesheet against the then chief minister alleging that he and his sons Ajay and Abhay had accumulated assets disproportionate to their income. The party promised to launch a probe if it came to power.

 The Congress chargesheet said Chautala had only 32 acres of land at Teja Khera village in Sirsa before 1977, but the list of properties swelled as he rose in politics. 

 It lists details of assets allegedly owned by the family and says money was collected in the name of donation to different trusts floated by the Chautalas, after allowing concessions to builders and individuals in places where land prices were very high.

 Although the chargesheet avoids naming the builders, the annexures are telling. They include a bank statement of the Chaudhary Devi Lal Memorial Society in which several cash transactions worth lakhs of rupees each have been shown.

 The Congress alleges that the family made money through misuse of the provision for change of land use, illegal mining, auction of liquor vends, extortion from industrialists, local area development tax and exemption from it, grant of no-objection certificates for petrol pumps, misappropriation of funds collected in the name of the former Fiji Prime Minister, government purchases and allotment of various tenders.

 The CBI says in the FIR that Chautala, his family members and other unknown persons have amassed wealth disproportionate to their known sources of income between July 1999 and March 2005, during which time the former chief minister and some of his relations were public servants. 

 Locations selected for searches today were intended mainly to collect evidence and were, therefore, restricted to residential premises, the office of a chartered accountant and a trading company run by the accused, a CBI source said. 

 The CBI has frozen Rs 1.34 crore stashed in five different bank accounts and recovered Rs 13 lakh in cash from two locations, the source added.

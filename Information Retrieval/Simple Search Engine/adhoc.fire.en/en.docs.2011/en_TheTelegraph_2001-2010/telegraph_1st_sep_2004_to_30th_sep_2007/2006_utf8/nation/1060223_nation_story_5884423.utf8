 13 lakh voters off Bengal list

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Feb. 22: In the biggest clean-up of the voters list, over three lakh more names were struck off the electoral rolls over the past 25 days, taking the number of deletions to 13 lakh. 

 This is four times the number of deletions in either of the past two years ? 3.47 lakh in 2004 and 3.39 lakh in 2005. 

 The Election Commission and its observers took a special initiative, went door to door and consulted death registers to make the final rolls as error-free as possible. The EC is taking extraordinary steps to ensure a foolproof roll. That is why there has been such a rise in deletions, said Bengals chief electoral officer Debashis Sen.

 The exercise will continue till the filing of nominations, which means there could be more deletions. 

 This is not the end to the process of updating and correcting the voters list. Nodal officers are going to be appointed and a fresh voter verification drive will be initiated in urban and municipal areas. Nodal officers will have to submit daily reports to district magistrates and action-taken reports will have to be sent to the poll panel, Sen said.

 After the commission published the final voters list today, the names of voters were hung at all the 49,000-odd polling booths across Bengal. The total voter count in the state now stands at 4.89 crore, a 1.77 per cent increase over last year. 

 On January 24, the deletion figure had stood at 9.89 lakh, shooting up to 12.98 lakh since. Some 21.5 lakh new voters have been added to the list, but this figure has not changed much from January 24. 

 South Dinajpur reported the highest number of deletions, followed by Nadia and West Midnapore.

 Apparently, the second visit by 19 commission observers early this month has played an important role in the detection of bogus, dead and shifted voters. The commission has told its Bengal point man that the final rolls should bear the stamp of the steps taken by its observers to redress complaints about bogus voters.

 The commission has also decided to introduce photo rolls ? voters picture next to the name on the list ? at polling booths in 46 constituencies.

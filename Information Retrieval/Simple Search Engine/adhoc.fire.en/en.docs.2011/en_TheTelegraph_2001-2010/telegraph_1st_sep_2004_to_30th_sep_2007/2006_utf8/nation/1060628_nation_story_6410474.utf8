 Hospital staff to pay for damage

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, June 27: The Bengal government has made hospital employees accountable for any damage to equipment.

 In a circular to the district chief medical officers, health services director K.C. Barui has said that in case it is proved that the employees were responsible for the damage of equipment, money would be deducted from their salary.

 In the event of the guilt of a retired employee being proved, his pension would be cut. 

 Barui has also issued another circular, which asks the chief medical officers not to succumb to any pressure in case they have to initiate penal action against errant hospital employees. If there is indeed such pressure, the health department has to be informed. It will then act against the errant employee. 

 The decision to act tough comes in the wake of increasing incidents where expensive medical equipment have been rendered useless because of mishandling. 

 The government, an official said, has bought equipment worth Rs 150 crore over the past two years to upgrade primary health centres and district hospitals. 

 It was found that machines in the districts, especially X-Ray machines and pathological equipment, were kept defunct on purpose so that the staff members would not have to conduct tests, the official added.

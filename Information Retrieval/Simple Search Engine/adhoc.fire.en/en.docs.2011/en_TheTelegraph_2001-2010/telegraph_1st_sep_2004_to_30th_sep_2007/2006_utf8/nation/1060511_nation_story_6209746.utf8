 Weather system in new stable

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 10: The country has set up its first-ever Earth Commission and renamed its ministry of oceans as the ministry of earth sciences to oversee both Indias weather establishment and ocean-related activities.

 But a number of institutions engaged in earth sciences and an ocean science institute will remain out of the new organisation for the moment.

 Under changes approved by the cabinet on Tuesday, a new Earth System Organisation (ESO) will include the Ocean Science and Technology Department and the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) and other weather centres.

 The IMD and other weather centres were until now part of the Department of Science and Technology. Science and technology minister Kapil Sibal said the structural changes were required to address structural faults.

 The previous system was not working?. There was a disconnect between the DST and the IMD. It was difficult to implement the vision of having a world class weather service that we want to have by 2009, Sibal said.

 Dr P.S. Goel, the ocean development secretary who will now be earth sciences secretary, said the new structure would lead to institutional mechanisms to integrate research efforts in atmospheric sciences and ocean sciences.

 Despite the tag of earth sciences, leading institutions involved in earth and ocean sciences such as the National Geophysical Research Institute, the National Institute of Oceanography and the Geological Survey of India will remain out.

 Goel said the earth sciences organisation would seek to coordinate research across different institutions, including such laboratories, the Indian Institutes of Technology and the Indian Institute of Science.

 The Earth Commission will have 12 members and function on the pattern of the atomic energy commission and space commission. Goel said the move to create a structure that couples ocean and atmospheric research is on the lines of what the US and Japan had done years ago.

 Sibal indicated that there were operational and administrative hurdles in the old structure that have stymied efforts to modernise the IMD. There was a lack of transparency in procurement, he said.

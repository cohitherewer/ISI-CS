 Recalled, Baig to step down

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Baig

 Srinagar, Sept. 2: Jammu and Kashmir deputy chief minister Muzaffar Hussain Baig today decided to quit the cabinet, ending the crisis in the Congress-Peoples Democratic Party alliance.

 Addressing a news conference, Baig said he had decided to resign from his post and also quit the council of ministers following the PDPs decision to recall him from the cabinet.

 I will meet the chief minister and request him to relieve me of my responsibilities as deputy chief minister and also from the council of ministers, Baig said this afternoon.

 He, however, did not say whether he would also quit the PDP, with whose leadership he clashed over his refusal to step down from the deputy chief ministers post following directions from the PDP high command.

 The PDP-Congress alliance was in turmoil this week when chief minister Ghulam Nabi Azad refused to accept the PDPs advice before a recent shuffle to divest Baig of some important portfolios he had been holding.

 The PDP convened an emergency meeting of its legislature party on Thursday and Baig was removed as its leader in the 87-member Assembly. He was also recalled from the state council of ministers.

 Denying that he had influenced Azads decision to retain him as deputy chief minister, Baig said: I was not a party to the chief ministers decision.

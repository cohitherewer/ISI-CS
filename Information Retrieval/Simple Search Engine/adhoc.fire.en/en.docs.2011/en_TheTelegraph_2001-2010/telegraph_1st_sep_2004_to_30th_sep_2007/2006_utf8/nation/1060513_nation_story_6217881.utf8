 SC refuses to bar entry of toxic ship 

 New Delhi, May 12 (Reuters): The Supreme Court today refused to stop a former cruise liner that environmental activists say has hundreds of tonnes of toxic material on board from entering Indian waters.

 Greenpeace and other groups say the 46,000-tonne Blue Lady contains more than 900 tonnes of asbestos and is sailing for Alang in Gujarat to be scrapped.

 The court instead referred the matter to an expert panel appointed by it earlier this year to look into the working conditions at Alang, home to scores of family-run ship-breakers. 

 We will not pass any (banning) orders without a report, a judge said after hearing a plea by the Research Foundation for Science, Technology and Environment.

 The court set the next hearing for July but environmental groups say the Blue Lady was expected to enter Indian waters in late May after setting sail from Malaysia.

 In February, the French government recalled a mothballed aircraft carrier containing tonnes of asbestos, and being readied for scrapping at the Gujarat yards, after protests and court action led by Greenpeace.

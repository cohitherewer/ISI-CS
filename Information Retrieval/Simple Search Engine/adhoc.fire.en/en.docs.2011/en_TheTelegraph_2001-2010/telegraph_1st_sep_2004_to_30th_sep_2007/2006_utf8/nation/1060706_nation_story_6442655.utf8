 Mumbai, July 5: Gravel on the runway at the countrys busiest airport peeled off in the rain today, delaying flights, as potholes on the ground slowed down road traffic and got the municipal corporation an earful from Bombay High Court.

 The main runway at Mumbai airport was shut down for two hours for repairs. Airport director R.J. Treasurywala said: Main runway 09/27 had to be shut down between 2 and 4 pm for maintenance work? Rain had caused the gravel to peel off. Alternative runway 14/32 was kept open.

 The Met office recorded 92.8 mm of rain in Colaba and 100.2 in Santacruz from 8.30 am to 5.30 pm today. Yesterday, between 8.30 am and 11.30 am, Colaba had received 101.3 mm and Santacruz 103.6 mm.

 But Central and Harbour line suburban train services were suspended for the second day because stations remained waterlogged. Although the two highways were less affected, connecting subways and arterial roads in the western suburbs were flooded.

 The forecast of heavy rain in the next 76 hours was enough to keep Mumbaikars home. Schools and colleges were shut since yesterday and less than 50 per cent reported for work today. 

 A total of 28 rain-related deaths have been reported in Maharashtra in last 48 hours including nine in Mumbai, chief secretary D.K. Sankaran said. 

 The high court pulled up the municipal corporation during a hearing on a public interest litigation filed after the July 26 deluge last year. The petition filed by social activist Sandeep Rane has demanded speedy implementation of the Brimstowad report recommending an overhaul of storm water drains.

 Justices R.M. Lodha and S.J. Vajifdar asked BMC to file an affidavit outlining the blueprint for the reports implementation. 

 Perhaps you have failed to adopt long-term planning measures. Which is why the situation was so bad yesterday.

 Taking notice of the appearance of huge potholes on major roads in just five days of rain, the court demanded to know why action cannot be taken against the contractors who repaired them. 

 Urban planner Chandrashekhar Prabhu blamed cosmetic changes for the repeated flooding. 

 Cleaning up the Mithi River is not the only solution. An overhaul of the development plan is essential. The government has given the citys open spaces to builders without realising that they work as natural dissipation spaces for rain water.

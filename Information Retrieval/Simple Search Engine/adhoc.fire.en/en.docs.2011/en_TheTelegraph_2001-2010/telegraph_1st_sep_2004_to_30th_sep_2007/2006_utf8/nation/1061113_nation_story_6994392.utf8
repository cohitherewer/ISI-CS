The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Caution: for Calcutta crippler

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Nov. 12: Biman Bose today issued an advisory for those planning to travel from the city on Thursday make sure you leave long before you would have normally.

 The reason: a grand rally to protest against Saddam Husseins death sentence.

 The march will begin at Park Circus Maidan around 1.30 pm and snake through CIT Road, Moulali, Sealdah, APC Road and Raja Dinendra Street before ending at Deshabandhu Park. I understand passengers bound for the airport and for Sealdah and Howrah stations will face trouble. So I request them to leave home much in advance, the Bengal CPM secretary said.

 Bose said police would be urged to ensure smooth traffic as much as possible by turning one-way roads into two-way streets, while rally volunteers would be told to ensure ambulances reach their destination in time.

 Arjun rules out religious quotas

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 12: Arjun Singh today said the Centre did not have plans to introduce religious quotas in higher education institutions.

 Speaking after a two-day meet of the national monitoring committee on minority education, he said: We have no plans to give reservation to any community along religious lines.

 Coming in the middle of the controversy over 27 per cent education quotas for Other Backward Classes, the statement appeared to be an attempt to stub out further trouble.

 But the HRD minister left a window for confusion open by saying: Under constitutional norms, Muslims can get reservation because of their backwardness.

 The 93rd constitutional amendment bill provides for reservation to socially and educationally backward communities, including OBCs.

 Muslims and Christians are on the list of OBCs eligible for reservation in jobs under the Mandal Commission.

 It is possible that the Centre might follow the same list for higher education institutions, which means Christians and Muslims will be eligible for these quotas. But the HRD ministry said a list would be drawn up by the ministry of social justice.

 Last year, the national monitoring committee on minority education had recommended quotas for minority students in professional institutions like IITs and IIMs and the Indian Institute of Foreign Trade.

 In its report to the HRD ministry, it said: The number of minority students is falling in prestigious institutions like IIT, IIM, IIFT, etc. The committee is of the opinion that reservations may be made for admission of minority students in such institutions.

 Singh had earlier kept options for a religious quota open. Today, he seemed to rule it out.

 The committee had also underlined the need for improving representation of minorities and backwards in the civil services. As in the case of SC/STs, a centre may be established in the existing IITs and IIMs where bright students from these communities can be identified through the qualifying examination, it said.

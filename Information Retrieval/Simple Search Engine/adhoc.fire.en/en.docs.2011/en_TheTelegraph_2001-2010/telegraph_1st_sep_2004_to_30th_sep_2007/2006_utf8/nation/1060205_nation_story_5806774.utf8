 Mumbai discs wake up to cop crackdown

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Feb. 4: Mumbai police have launched a crackdown on popular night spots, clubs and discos in the city to check out if they have necessary licences to stay in business.

 The drive was launched last month following the rape of a 27-year-old South African woman of Indian origin at Bawa International Hotel in Vile Parle in December, but police commissioner Anami Roy has denied any direct connection.

 After dance bars were closed down, the amendment in the law requires that hotels which have live entertainment should possess a performance licence. So, we have asked the places which have live music and DJs to comply, Roy said.

 Search operations have so far been conducted at over 20 popular joints. At least two ? Poison in Bandra and the newly-opened Hard Rock Caf? in Worli ? were asked to shut down after they were found without valid licences, police sources said.

 The additional commissioner of police (west zone), Bipin Behari, confirmed the ongoing drive but termed it a routine operation.

 Based on information that several popular night spots were operating without proper licences, our teams visited some short-listed ones. Those that did not have necessary licences were asked to obtain them before carrying on, he said.

 Of the short-listed places, 11 were located in the western suburbs, which come under Beharis jurisdiction. The defaulters included Squeeze, Purple, Olive, Poison and Rain in the Bandra, Khar and Juhu areas.

 The police issue separate licences for serving liquor, food, providing entertainment and running an establishment according to the category of services rendered by the restaurants, pubs, discotheques and nightclubs.

 In police parlance, they are called SL3 (for liquor), PPEL (public performance and entertainment licence), PL (premise licence) and a separate licence for running an eating house.

 Some did not have valid licences for serving liquor and food, some did not have a licence for providing live entertainment. Sometimes, all four were required. We asked them to get the valid licences, Behari said.

 Asked if Bawa International Hotel had the licences, Behari said: Yes, we checked and Bawa International possessed the necessary licences.

 Restaurateur A.D. Singh, who runs two branches of Olive in Mumbai and New Delhi, confirmed that police teams visited his restau- rant last week.

 Indian laws have not kept up with the changes in this business over the years. Today, there are bars where people dance, restaurants where DJs play and so on. Olive started with proper licences, but they say if you have a DJ playing, then you need a live performance licence. So, we will get that soon, Singh said.

 Hard Rock Caf?, which informally opened last month on the Bombay Dyeing Mills premises in Worli, was asked to shut down as it was found to be serving food and liquor without valid licences.

 The caf? also came under the scanner after a brawl between a businessman and grandsons of film producer G.P. Sippy, Shaan and Sameer Uttamsingh. Shaan and Sameer were held after they assaulted one V. Mittal, who lodged a complaint.

 Shaan had earlier been in the news when he was one of four youths arrested by UAE police on charges of possessing drugs. The others were the sons of car designer Dilip Chhabria and Samajwadi Party city chief Abu Asim Azmi.

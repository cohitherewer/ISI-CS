 Busted: Muslim birth-rate bogey

 New Delhi, Dec. 3: Narendra Modi should take note. The Sachar committee debunks the myth that Muslims have more children than other communities.

 Strictly speaking, there is no Muslim fertility as such in the sense that Muslims in general cannot be identified as having a particular level of fertility, says the panels report, tabled in Parliament on Thursday.

 Muslims have a low fertility rate in states with low fertility rates. Muslims in southern states have lower fertility than in northern and central states, says the committee, tasked to find out Indian Muslims status in all spheres of life and activity.

 A myth within the myth has been that Muslims have more children because they marry early. Data, however, show that Muslims do not have a lower age at marriage than the average, Sachar says.

 The report asserts that over a third of Muslim couples do use some form of contraception. Data in the National Family Health Survey show the use of contraception is widely prevalent among Muslims, though to a lesser degree than the average.

 The bogey of Muslims higher fertility and the demographic threat it poses to Hindus has held sway for decades. Modi, Gujarats Muslim-baiting BJP chief minister, had played on this fear a few years ago with his mock slogan hum paanch, hamara pachis (the five of us and our 25 children).

 Sachar also reveals that only 4 per cent of Muslim students go to madarsas; most of the rest go to government or government-aided schools.

 He then goes on to make a surprising revelation. For all the disadvantages Indian Muslims suffer from, the mortality rate among infants and under-fives in the community is lower than that among Hindus (excluding the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes).

 Christians and Sikhs have an even lower mortality rate.

 The scheduled castes and scheduled tribes suffer the highest infant and under-five mortality rate followed by the Hindus. Muslims have the second-lowest infant and under-five mortality rate among all socio-religious communities, the report says. This is somewhat surprising given the economically disadvantaged position of Muslims.

 One possible explanation could be the higher urbanisation of the community. Yet the finding seems to fly in the face of accepted wisdom.

 Socio-economic variables that are supposed to reduce child mortality rates include the mothers education as well as the households socio-economic status and access to safe drinking water, sanitation and electricity. 

 But Muslims in general have lower levels of income and education. The only states where child mortality among Muslims has worsened are Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, Sachar says.

 The advantage in infant and under-five mortality is not carried over to the later stages of childhood. Muslims suffer from the highest rates of stunting and the second-highest rate of underweight children among all social groups.

 But Sachar admits that the difference is negligible. Hindu children, too, are at high risk of stunted growth and malnutrition, while the SC/STs fare worse than Muslims.

 Jaya cable leash scrapped

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chennai, June 30: The state government today jettisoned a law passed by the Jayalalithaa regime to nationalise the states cable TV industry, bringing relief to the leading private service provider which is associated with the ruling DMK.

 Jayalalithaa had got a bill passed in the Assembly last January allowing the government to take over the states entire cable television distribution network. Governor S.S. Barnala, who recently received a five-year extension, had questioned the states competence to enact laws on the subject and returned the bill unsigned in April.

 Chief minister Karunanidhi today told reporters his cabinet had decided to withdraw the bill following advice from legal experts that the Centre alone can pass laws regulating the cable industry.

 While tabling the bill, the ADMK government had said the legislation would end the virtual monopoly enjoyed by big cable TV service providers such as Sumangali Cable Vision and Hathway.

 Sumangali happens to be part of the Sun TV network headed by Kalanidhi Maran, great-nephew of Karunanidhi and brother of DMK leader and Union communications minister Dayanidhi Maran.

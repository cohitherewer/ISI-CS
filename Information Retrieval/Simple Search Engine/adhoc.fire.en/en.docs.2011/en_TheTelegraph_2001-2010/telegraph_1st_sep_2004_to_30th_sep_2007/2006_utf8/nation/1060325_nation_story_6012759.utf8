 Bhopal, March 24: Spurred by the drama over offices of profit in Parliament, the Congress and Uma Bharti today demanded the resignation of Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan and 13 of his cabinet colleagues.

 The 13 ministers are accused of holding offices of profit, but the call for Chauhans head by leader of the Opposition Jamuna Devi stunned even her party members.

 The Congress leader demanded the BJP chief minister be forced to quit on the ground that he has held on to his Parliament seat.

 In the past, the Congress has had several chief ministers, such as Digvijay Singh and Arjun Singh, who assumed office while they were Lok Sabha members. However, they resigned from Parliament in keeping with the norms after getting elected to the Assembly within the stipulated six months.

 Chauhan, who became chief minister in November, will contest for an Assembly seat on April 24 from Budhini.

 But Devi had no time for such details. She alleged that Chauhan was even doling out money from his MP Local Area Development funds. 

 How can he be drawing two salaries and the perks and extending patronage? Devi demanded before the Assembly was adjourned sine die 12 days ahead of schedule.

 Uma, who is set to float her own political party, arrived in Bhopal today and headed for the Narmada, some 60 km away, for a dip. Before she could reach the Assembly, it had been adjourned. That didnt prevent her from joining Devi in calling for the disqualification of many ministers who head state-run bodies.

 The list includes transport minister Himmat Kothari, who heads the Madhya Pradesh Road Transport Corporation, industry minister Babulal Gaur, chairman of the State Industries Corporation, and tourism minister Yashodhara Raje Scindia, who chairs the Madhya Pradesh Tourism Development Corporation.

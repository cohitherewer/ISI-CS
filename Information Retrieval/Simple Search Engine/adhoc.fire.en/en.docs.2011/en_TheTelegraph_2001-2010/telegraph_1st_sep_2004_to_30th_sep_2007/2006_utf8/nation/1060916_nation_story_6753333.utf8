 Padapai (Tamil Nadu), Sept. 15: The pink veil behind the round table on the dais suddenly went up, letting in beams from every direction.

 Chief minister M. Karunanidhi was smiling at the audience from the podium and from the screens of four colour television sets.

 The crowd got up and cheered. Tamil Nadus Screen Revolution had been launched.

 The ruling DMK today took the first step towards making good its poll promise of a free colour TV set for every poor family in the state. But not before a hitch.

 The original plan was to cover the states 55 lakh below-poverty-line families over two years. Then the government realised that the BPL list was a flawed one it had been packed with ADMK supporters by the previous Jayalalithaa regime while carrying out the Centres Antodaya Anna Yojana.

 So, Karunanidhi decided the list had to be reviewed. Meanwhile, the TV scheme would kick off, the first-phase beneficiaries being the residents of select Chennai slums and the states 105 Periyar Ninaivu Samathuvapurams (state-developed complexes where the poor from all communities live together).

 Their number, however, adds up to just 30,000.

 The Opposition sneered at the number, which looked laughably small after the government had allocated Rs 750 crore for the scheme in its budget. To ensure transparency, the state had also appointed an Assembly panel headed by minister M.K. Stalin, which the Opposition ADMK and MDMK members refused to join.

 Nettled by all that scorn, Karunanidhi today announced an expansion of the scheme to include all poor and lower middle-class households who dont have a TV set.

 In the next five years well ensure there is no household in Tamil Nadu that does not have a colour TV, the chief minister asserted to thunderous applause a month before the panchayat polls. Even if we have to give free colour TV sets to one crore households, well do it in stages.

 Today, at the Samathuvapuram at Thundal Kazhani village, near Padapai in Kancheepuram district, he handed over the first four 14-inch sets, each with a yellow ribbon tied into a bow around it.

 By tomorrow, 25,245 sets will have been distributed across the state, Karunanidhi told the function.

 By the end of this financial year, another 25 lakh sets would reach beneficiaries.

 The dignitaries on the dais, including central ministers such as IT and communications minister Dayanidhi Maran, clapped with the crowd.

 If Karunanidhi can keep his promise, black-and-white TV sets wont be seen any more in the state after five years. By then, it will be time for another election.

 Temple fight over shorts 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, Sept. 19: After Krishna in denims, its devotees in shorts that has now raised the mercury.

 The temple disquiet in Uttar Pradesh shifted to Varanasi this morning over an unwritten dress code for pilgrims even as Vrindavans Banke Bihari temple, embroiled in a controversy over a Krishna idol in jeans, remained shut for an hour after a court order.

 The trouble started after some early morning visitors were allegedly turned out of the Kashi-Vishwanath temple as they were in shorts. The angry devotees, among them some sadhus, then staged a wild dance in protest.

 Police had a tough time controlling them, but insisted that the code wasnt entirely out of place. It is not meant to be a complete ban, said SP Jogesh Kishore Tiwari, who is in charge of the Gyanvapi area where the shrine, which draws about 1,200 people a day, is located.

 But we were discouraging devotees from visiting the temple in shorts following objections raised by some women.

 Tiwari added that during the Shravan mela in July-August, hundreds of devotees visited the temple in shorts, some in their underwear.

 The officer said many women objected. The temple is also for women. How can a woman stand and pray if she sees semi-naked men hovering around? he said, recalling a police complaint filed by a woman devotee.

 So we issued a directive urging the devotees to visit the temple in proper dress. They should keep in mind the women devotees who visit the temple in large numbers, Tiwari said.

 Former Varanasi mayor Sanjay Rai, however, said the administration must stop harassing the devotees immediately. If the unwritten code is not withdrawn, we will launch a more intensive stir, he said.

 It is also learnt that local RSS pracharaks, whose trademark dress is khaki half pant, are also up in arms.

 In Vrindavan, supporters of the chief priest, Jugal Kishore Goswami, and his brother Anand shut the main gate of the Banke Bihari temple after a Mathura court ordered the Goswamis not to perform puja till September 22, the next date of hearing of a petition against the brothers.

 The order, the agitated priests said, was unacceptable as the court was punishing them without completing the hearing in the case.

 The priests shut the gate for about an hour before the district administration intervened and helped the temple management open the gate to let in pilgrims who had gathered outside.

 Yesterday, a temple source had said Jugal Kishore had merely bowed to pressure from one of the sevaits, a wealthy businessman who had donated heavily for the ongoing Anand Utsav.

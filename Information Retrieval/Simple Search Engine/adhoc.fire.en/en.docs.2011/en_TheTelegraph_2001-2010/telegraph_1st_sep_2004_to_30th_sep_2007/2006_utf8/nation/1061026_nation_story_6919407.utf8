 Munnabhai moves PM 

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was captivated by Lage Raho Munnabhai long before he watched it. 

 In South Africa last month, he reportedly read reviews of the Sanjay Dutt-starrer with great interest and told accompanying journalists that it was a film about a young mans discovery of the universal and timeless relevance of the Mahatmas message.

 Today, when he watched the lovable don and his sidekick Circuit (Arshad Warsi in the film), he was so moved that he told his media adviser Sanjaya Baru during the interval that Munnabhai really captured the power of truth. 

 Singh saw the film with his family and some PMO officials at the auditorium at his residence.

 Telescopic train fares to return

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, June 1: The railway ministry has reversed its earlier decision and decided to restore the long-distance telescopic fare benefit to passengers with effect from June 15. 

 Railway minister Lalu Prasad Yadav, who had claimed he was not raising fares or freight rates and increasing revenue through movement of higher volumes, had come under criticism for withdrawing the facility. 

 Under the telescopic fares, a passenger could buy a ticket from Delhi to Madurai and travel directly from Delhi to Chennai and then board another train to Madurai with the same ticket. 

 With the withdrawal of the facility, he would have to buy a ticket to Chennai and a new ticket from Chennai to Madurai, which would cost him more as train fares per kilometre are higher over short distances. The long-distance fares work out cheaper.

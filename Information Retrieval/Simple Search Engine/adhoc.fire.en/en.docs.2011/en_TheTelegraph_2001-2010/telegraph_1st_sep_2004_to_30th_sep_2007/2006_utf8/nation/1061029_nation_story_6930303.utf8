 Atals not a ghost yet, spirit is still willing

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Vajpayee

 Lucknow, Oct. 28: Last year, Atal Bihari Vajpayee had spooked many in his party with a cryptic reference to the Ramayana and a few ambiguous words about withdrawing from the scene.

 Yesterday, at a civic poll rally here, he chose to remind colleagues he hadnt yet turned into a bhoot (ghost) but was very much on the scene, alive and kicking.

 The former Prime Minister would have known how divided the state leadership was over inviting him to what happens to be his own constituency. The thinking was that bringing him here would send out a signal that the party couldnt even get a mayor elected without Vajpayees help.

 Finally, the BJP decided not to risk a demoralising loss of a stronghold weeks before the Assembly polls, but it took a personal request from party chief Rajnath Singh to get the 80-year-old here from Delhi.

 Vajpayee left after addressing a single meeting, where he made it clear he knew that many in the party believed his time was past.

 I am very much in the present. I am standing here before you. I am challenging (the) future, he said. He paused to allow an impish smile to play about his lips for a few seconds.

 But dont call me bhutpurva (former). I am not a bhoot, he added. There is still a lot I have to do.

 Later, as reporters asked him the inevitable question whether he still saw himself as the National Democratic Alliances or the BJPs candidate for Prime Minister, Vajpayee brushed the suggestion off, saying: No, not at all.

 Vajpayee has been known to snub colleagues or express his annoyance through cryptic remarks made with a half-jocular air.

 Last December, at a time of churning for the BJP with L.K. Advani days from quitting as its president, the former Prime Minister had told a party meeting: Like Parashuram, who withdrew during the coronation of Ram after his exile, I, too, am withdrawing.

 It set off a debate whether he wanted to steal Advanis thunder, or whether it was a hint to Advani (Ram) to follow his lead and retire from electoral politics, leaving Lakshman Pramod Mahajan (and not Rajnath) to succeed him.

 After Vajpayee left, state party leaders to a man defended the invitation to him.

 He is the Lucknow MP, so he can very well participate in the municipal poll campaign, why not? asked Lalji Tandon, a close associate.

 Kalyan Singh, who looks after state party affairs, said the move was aimed at setting off a last-minute wave for the party candidate. There is nothing unusual about it.

 As he campaigned for Dinesh Sharma last evening, Vajpayee lost count of how many of the projects he had launched in the city had ground to a halt after the United Progressive Alliance came to power.

 There was the Gomti Nagar terminus, worth Rs 100 crore, the project on the circular train, the flyover on Faizabad Road in Lucknow... he went on, counting up to a dozen and then stopping.

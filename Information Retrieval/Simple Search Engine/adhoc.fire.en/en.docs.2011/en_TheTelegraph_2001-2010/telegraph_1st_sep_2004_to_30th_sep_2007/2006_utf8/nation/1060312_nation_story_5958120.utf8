 Advani woos RSS on yatra

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 11: Lal Krishna Advani today met top RSS leaders K.S. Sudarshan and Mohan Bhagwat in a last-ditch attempt to garner support for his national integration yatra that does not seem to have enthused either his party cadre or the Sangh parivar.

 Even the most strident Muslim-baiters ? the VHP and the Bajrang Dal ? have rejected the former BJP chiefs call to protest the politics of minorityism.

 VHP leader Ashok Singhal has already declared that the yatra, in the wake of the Varanasi blasts, would not elicit any response from the Hindu samaj. 

 The BJPs former Hindutva mascot, Uma Bharti, also mounted a vicious attack. Advani has no moral right to lead any agitation on the issue of terrorism. When he was the home minister, terrorists attacked Parliament followed by a series of attacks on religious and public places, she said. 

 The people will reject any attempt on the BJP and Advanis part to regain their Hindutva plank.

 Although Advani said in Nagpur today that he was hopeful of getting support from the Sangh, the RSS has not responded with equal optimism. 

 Signals from senior BJP leaders indicate that the Sangh is not particularly happy with the idea of boosting Advanis political fortunes by actively participating in the yatra.

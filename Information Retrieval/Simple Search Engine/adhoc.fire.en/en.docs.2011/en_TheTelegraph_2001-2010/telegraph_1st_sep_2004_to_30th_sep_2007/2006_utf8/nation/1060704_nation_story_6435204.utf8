 Calcutta, July 3: GNLF leader Subash Ghisingh today reached an agreement with Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees government on the extent and boundary of the area under the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council (DGHC), which is likely to get Sixth Schedule status soon.

 After signing an agreement with the state government over transferring the 18 mouzas, Ghisingh said he was happy with Bhattacharjees role in helping the DGHC.

 The land and powers for the DGHC have been finalised. There is nothing more to be sorted out with the state government. Theyve given us everything we required for getting Sixth Schedule status. Now we only have to get it passed in Parliament, the Gorkha leader said after the meeting at Writers Buildings.

 The government agreed to transfer the Nepania mouza in Naxalbari block to the DGHC and also list the Chota Changa mouza in the block officially under the council.

 The transfer of 14 mouzas was already listed in the memorandum of settlement for the Sixth Schedule, signed in Delhi last December. 

 Earlier, the government had agreed to transfer mouzas Sevoke and Kalijhora, which were listed under DGHC although they voted in the Siliguri Mahakuma Parishad polls. The two mouzas will now be transferred out of the Siliguri subdivision.

 Chota Changa mouza was already there under DGHC, but owing to an error, it didnt figure on the official list. Nepania was mentioned in the 1988 accord but we hadnt transferred it. Today, we decided to transfer it, taking the tally to 18 mouzas, CPM leader Asok Bhattacharya said.

 Bhattacharya was present at the meeting along with home secretary Prasad Ranjan Roy and chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb.

 The agreement signed today will be sent to the Union home ministry, which will draft a constitutional amendment bill. For the DGHC to get Sixth Schedule status, Parliament must pass the bill.

 When Prime Minister Manmohan Singh visits Bengal later this month, the chief minister will request him to have the proposal passed during the monsoon session of Parliament, Ghisingh said.

 Under the Sixth Schedule, the council will get its own land, excise, education, panchayat and rural development and municipal affairs departments and will be able to levy its own taxes. The Centre will transfer the control of mines and minerals to the council.

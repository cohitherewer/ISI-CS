 Advani challenge to PM

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Bhopal, July 16: L.K. Advani today turned the twin guns of terror and spiralling prices on Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, daring him to seek a fresh mandate for allegedly failing to control either.

 Using the Mumbai train blasts as ammo for his attack, he said: ? let the people decide UPAs fate if Dr Manmohan Singh feels he cannot deal with terrorism and provide security to the common man.

 The leader of the Opposition said given that the UPA government was constantly troubled by its allies like the Left threatening to bring it down, going to the people seemed a viable option.

 Speaking at a rally five days after the deadly bombings, he advised Singh to consider re-enacting the anti-terror act. When the UPA came to power, the first thing it did was scrap the Prevention of Terrorism Act. The Mumbai blasts are a direct fallout of repealing the act, which had incorporated all safeguards suggested by the Supreme Court, he said.

 We demand it be re-enacted. The government is behaving as if terrorism does not exist though it has claimed over 60,000 lives till date.

 If the government refused to bring back the bill, the BJP would raise a ruckus in Parliament from the day it opens on July 24, Advani said.

 But he had a pat reserved for Singh too, for having called off the secretary-level talks with Pakistan. Dr Singh should try to secure support during the G8 summit for Indias war on terror and exert pressure on Pakistan to prevent terrorist activities from its soil.

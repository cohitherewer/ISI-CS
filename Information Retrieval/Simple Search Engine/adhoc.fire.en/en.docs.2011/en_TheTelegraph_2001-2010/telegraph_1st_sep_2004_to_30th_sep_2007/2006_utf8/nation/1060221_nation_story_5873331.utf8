 IIM seals deal with Paris B-school

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 20: Indias top business schools are expanding their global network. 

 After IIM Bangalore, which planned to set up a campus in Singapore, IIM Ahmedabad today took a step forward in extending the scope of a partnership with the Essec School of Business in Paris. 

 IIM Ahmedabad director Bakul Dholakia signed a partnership document with Pierre Tapie, the president of the French business school, in the presence of visiting French President Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in Delhi this afternoon. 

 This alliance between two excellent institutions is part of our aim to understand our respective cultures and markets, said Tapie at a news conference. 

 He added that the partnership is particularly significant at a time when economic and political relations between India and Europe are developing at an unprecedented rate. Greater depth to inter-university relations between India and France contributes to developing mutual recognition between the two countries.

 Essec has 3,700 students and 107 permanent professors and offers a wide range of management programmes. It has a campus in Singapore, which is fast emerging as a hub for management education. Tapie, however, ruled out a campus in India at least for the next few years. 

 Singapore will remain our main partner in Asia, the Essec president said.

 The partnership between Essec and IIM Ahmedabad requires a deeper commitment, he added.

 Top management schools, both in India and abroad, want to take advantage of globalisation that has facilitated intensive collaborations between Indian and overseas institutions of higher education. 

 IIM Ahmedabad had signed the first part of a strategic partnership with Essec in November last year, putting in place a double degree programme, which will allow students to get degrees from both B-schools. 

 Today, the institutes signed the second part of the strategic partnership.

 Students and faculty members, according to the terms of the pact, will spend one year of the two-year programme on a campus outside their own country. 

 The programme today was extended to areas of research and exchange of doctoral candidates and post-doctoral fellows. Doctoral students from each institution can spend from six months to a year at the partner business school for a Euro-Asian perspective to their work. 

 Directors from each institute will be offered programmes that will be conducted by professors teaching on the three campuses of India, Singapore and France. 

 Essec specialises in hospitality, luxury brand and health management. We are the number one in social entrepreneurship and biotechnology, Tapie said. 

 He said the collaborative programme between Essec and IIM Ahmedabad goes much deeper than the exchange programmes usually conducted between institutions. But he added that the programmes are very loose in terms of requirements. They are usually for one semester. 

 IIM Bangalore, which wants to set up a campus in Singapore, is amending its Memorandum of Association for this. The human resource development ministry had refused the IIM permission to start a campus abroad on the grounds that it should first meet domestic requirements.

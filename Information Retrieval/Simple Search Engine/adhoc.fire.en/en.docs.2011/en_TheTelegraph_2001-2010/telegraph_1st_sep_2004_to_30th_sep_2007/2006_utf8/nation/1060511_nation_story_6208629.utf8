 Michelle, the India adviser, is hired 

 - 26-yr-old wins reality show amp; job with tycoon

 AMIT ROY

 Michelle Dewbury and Sir Alan Sugar

 London, May 10: A 26-year-old woman, Michelle Dewbury, who ran her own business of advising British firms on how to off-shore to India, today won a reality show called The Apprentice.

 The boss, tycoon Sir Alan Sugar, who had rudely told other contestants, Youre fired!, said the magic words to Dewbury: Michelle ? youre hired!

 She lands a ?100,000-a-year job at the electronics firm, Amstrad, with Sir Alan, who said he had difficulty in choosing between Dewbury and the last remaining contestant on the show, Ruth Badger, 28, a sales manager from Wolverhampton.

 Sir Alan, who looks the archetypal rough diamond, had to deal with a total of 11 contestants, who had to convince him of their own qualities and the shortcomings of others.

 As with all reality shows, the greater the humiliation inflicted on those taking part, the better it is said to be for ratings. If young men and women are reduced to tears, then it is so much the better.

 The Apprentice is a BBC2 reality television programme, a copycat of the US show of the same name but with Sir Alan instead of Donald Trump.

 The first series ran for 12 episodes in 2005, and the second began in February this year. The BBC has already announced a third series next year, and there will probably be a fourth one in 2008.

 Sir Alan today told Dewbury: All you have ever done in your life is work hard and you have become a great achiever.

 Dewbury left school with only two GCSEs but the death of her sister, Fiona, 19, who fell to her death from a eighth-floor window, made her determined to make something of her own life. She worked as a checkout girl and then set up her off-shoring telecom business, which, she boasted, was bringing in her ?100,000 a year.

 For someone like Sir Alan to recognise my ability is unbelievable, she commented. It wasnt until right at the very end when he said Id won that I believed it. It shows you dont need to be loud and cocky and bolshie, just work as hard as you can and hopefully you will get on in life.

 The defeated Badger said: Im genuinely, genuinely happy for Michelle but Im absolutely gutted that Im not working for Sir Alan. Ive never in my career or my life fought for something so much. Theres nobody in this country that inspires me more than Sir Alan. Even though Ive come second, I absolutely worship the man.

 Dewburys job will be to launch a new business for Sir Alan called Xenon Green, disposing of companies unwanted computer equipment.

 Some of the losers may prove to be winners, ultimately. Sir Alan is meeting Badger and may offer her a job.

 The star of the series has proved to be a young British Asian, Syed Ahmed, who began a romance with Dewbury while filming the show. He is now a celebrity in his own right, though for what reason is unclear.

 The star of the first series, although she did not win, was Saira Khan, a young Muslim woman with a big attitude and an even bigger mouth. 

 She has been much in demand for chat shows, because a pretty Muslim girl who is willing to attack Islamic fundamentalists and terrorists is not easy to find.

 Pension for fringe workers on Centre table

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Aug. 12: The Centre will introduce a pension scheme for unorganised sector workers, Union minister of state for labour, Chandrasekhar Sahoo, said here today. 

 There is a need to offer pension to these labourers. The UPA government is committed to improving their plight. A bill will be introduced in Parliament soon, he added.

 Modalities of the scheme, under which amounts up to Rs 500 could be paid per month to those above 60, are being worked out. The minister said the sector has 43 crore workers.

 The Centre is working on three bills and the final one will be introduced in Parliaments budget session. 

 The drafts have been prepared by the labour ministry, National Advisory Council and the Arjun Sengupta Committee.

 Sahoo said the scheme, which will be implemented in phases, is expected to cost Rs 25,000 crore, an amount the government is trying to arrange. Efforts are being made to cover three crore workers in the next five years, he added.

 Asked whether cash raised from selling PSU shares divestment in financial parlance will be used for the scheme, the minister said: This option hasnt been thought of. However, we are exploring other possibilities. The Prime Minister is trying to help find the funds, the minister said. Manmohan Singh is meeting unions on August 19 to discuss the pension plan. 

 On the condition of labour in Bengal, Union information and broadcasting minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, who was accompanying Sahoo during his visit to the city, said the state needs to do away with the differential minimum wages paid to men and women workers.

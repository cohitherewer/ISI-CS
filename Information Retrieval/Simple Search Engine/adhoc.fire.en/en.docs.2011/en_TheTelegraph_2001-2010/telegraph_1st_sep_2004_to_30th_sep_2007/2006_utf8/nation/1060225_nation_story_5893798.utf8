 Only Purana Qila fits Bush bill

 AYSWARIA VENUGOPAL

 New Delhi, Feb. 24: A site of Islamic importance, well-guarded against militant attacks, open and majestic. This is how the wish list of President George W. Bushs staff read, before they picked Purana Qila as the venue for his address to the world. 

 To the Indians surprise, the US security staff, scouting for a location with history and aesthetics that would make a lasting impact, rejected Humayuns Tomb, a world heritage site. The secure premises of Vigyan Bhavan were also given the thumbs down. 

 The beautiful fort whose raised ramparts and imposing gateway have survived several empires is located on a low-lying hill and is surrounded by a moat. 

 Offering a panoramic view of Delhi and majestic when lit up at night, Purana Qila was just right for Bushs audience back home. The address is to be telecast live by global networks.

 US concerns over aesthetics surfaced again when it came to deciding the venue of the joint news conference to be held by the President and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh scheduled for March 1. 

 Hyderabad House, with its imposing structure and India Gate as a backdrop, was found suitable but the Americans objected to a canopy being provided for mediapersons who would otherwise have to wait in the blistering sun during the briefing and before it, while talks are on. However, the Indian security officials decided to be practical and keep the canopy.

 In September last year, the Prime Minister had hosted a dinner for Tony and Cherie Blair at Humayuns Tomb, which has been beautifully restored by the Aga Khan trust. Since it is a mausoleum, clearance for use is required from the Archaeological Survey of India. 

 But Bushs security team was not happy with its location, with Nizamuddin Basti in the vicinity. 

 Purana Qila has so far been a popular site for fashion shows and music and dance recitals. The open space and the raised location on the banks of the Yamuna won favour with the Americans. 

 Humayun had laid the first brick of Dinapanah in 1534 and built the massive gateways and walls of Purana Quila. Sher Shah, who defeated Humayun in 1540, built a few buildings in the complex.

 Tight security measures are being put in place in New Delhi and Hyderabad for Bushs visit. 

 Maurya Sheraton, where the President will be staying, has been declared a no-fly zone and the floor cordoned off by US security. Anti-aircraft guns have been placed at strategic locations to shoot down flying objects over the hotel and other locations. 

 Bush will be guarded by US presidential guards, with two additional layers of security thrown around him by the secret service.

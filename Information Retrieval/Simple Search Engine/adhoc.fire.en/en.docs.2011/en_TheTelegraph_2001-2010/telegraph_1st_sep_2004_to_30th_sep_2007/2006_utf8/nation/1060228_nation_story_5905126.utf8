 Mumbai, Feb. 27: Reeling under repeated assaults from relatives of patients, over 2,500 doctors in the city went on a flash strike today.

 The Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors (Mard) also threatened to go on indefinite strike if the state government failed to find a permanent solution to the problem.

 There have been 18 incidents of assaults on resident doctors in the last three years. We have not received any response from the government so far, Mard spokesperson Dr Ajay Oswal told The Telegraph today.

 The need for adequate security during work hours, especially on night shifts, and rationalisation of doctor-patient ratio at public hospitals are our two key demands, he added.

 Despite chaos prevailing at eight public hospitals following the strike call, emergency services were undisturbed.

 However, if the agitation continues, basic medical services at these hospitals might be affected.

 More than 1,500 other doctors from across the state are likely to join the protest tomorrow, taking the total number of doctors on strike to 4,000.

 The senior leadership of Mard is scheduled to meet at 9 tonight to decide the future course of the agitation.

 The immediate provocation for the flash strike were two separate incidents of violence ? one at King Edward Memorial Hospital in Parel last night and the other at Bandras Bhabha Hospital.

 Sunita Walavalkar, 75, had been admitted to King Edward with respiratory and cardiac problems four days ago. Yesterday, she was shifted out of the ICU after she responded to treatment. But around 5 pm, Walavalkar developed complications and died. When resident doctor Rohit Ainchwar approached her 40-year-old daughter Chandrakala for consent to get a post-mortem done, she allegedly abused and slapped him.

 Ainchwars colleagues issued a strike notice this morning and refused to attend to the hospitals Out Patients Department. By late afternoon, doctors from JJ Hospital, Sion Hospital, Nair Hospital, the BMC-run Cama Hospital, St Georges Hospital and Cooper Hospital had lent their voice to the chorus.

 They were soon joined by Bhabha Hospital, where two doctors were reportedly assaulted this afternoon for refusing to let a pregnant womans sister step into the maternity ward with her footwear on.

 Representatives from the Association of Medical Consultants had met state home minister R.R. Patil earlier this month and expressed concern over the growing violence against doctors. 

 Patil had assured them that he would look into the matter and said the state might consider registering all assault cases as non-bailable offences to act as a deterrent.

 The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation, too, had proposed to install security equipment and closed-circuit TV cameras in hospitals.

 But none of the promised measures has been implemented yet.

 We can understand the emotional trauma that a patients relatives undergo when a death happens, but the resident doctors are working almost 24?7 without an off-day. They do their best in given circumstances. We want a lasting solution to this problem, Oswal said.

 A.M. Khan, the state secretary for medical education and drugs, admitted that the growing instances of attacks on doctors were alarming. 

 Doctors in large public hospitals work round the clock in a highly stressful environment, and patients relatives are also under emotional stress during a medical emergency. There, of course, cannot be any justification for violence.

 Nuke deal or no, US ties safe: Carter

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 27: Former US President Jimmy Carter feels relations between America and India will remain strong even if the civilian nuclear deal does not go through.

 Carter a critic of the deal reached India in the small hours today, his first visit in nearly three decades to a country he calls one of my favourite nations.

 His agenda for the visit is building homes. He will travel to Lonavala, Maharashtra, where a US-based NGO, Habitat for Humanity, is building low-cost houses with the help of volunteers, and then to tsunami-affected areas in Tamil Nadu.

 Carter said this is what he planned to talk about when he met Prime Minister Manmohan Singh later in the day. And possibly get Singhs take on the situation in West Asia, on which he has written a yet-to-be-released book.

 I am not here to influence the policy of the Indian government, he said, answering questions on the nuclear deal that faces an uncertain future in the US legislature. If the US Congress doesnt approve it in next months session, it might need to begin the legislative process on it afresh next year.

 On the possible aftermath of this happening, he said he hoped that the failure of the Congress to approve the deal would not affect other aspects of the India-US relationship. Relations between the two democracies did not depend on that one issue, Carter said.

 The former President would, of course, be happier if the deal does not go through. He has opposed the agreement, saying it encouraged nuclear proliferation. His concerns were global, Carter said.

 A few months ago, in a newspaper article, Carter had slammed the George W. Bush administration, criticising it for being just one more step in opening a Pandoras box of nuclear proliferation.

 He wrote the deal might encourage technologically capable nations to go for the nuclear option; and it would send uncertain signals to countries like Iran and North Korea.

 Carter also opposed the Bush administrations handling of the crisis over North Koreas recent nuclear test. The US should not shun direct talks with North Korea on this, he said.

 Responding to questions, he also criticised the terrible mistake Bush made in attacking Iraq. The US should pull out not immediately, but in a year or so. A US withdrawal would reduce the level of violence, he felt. 

 On Afghanistan, he supported Bush.

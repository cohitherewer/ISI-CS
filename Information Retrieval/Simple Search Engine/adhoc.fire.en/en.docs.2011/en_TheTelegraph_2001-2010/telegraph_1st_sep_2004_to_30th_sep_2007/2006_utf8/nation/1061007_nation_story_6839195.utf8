 Virus nibbles at tourism

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Bye bye India? 

 Lucknow, Oct. 6: A Briton who arrived in Varanasi on Monday in search of oriental mysticism was wheeled into a hospital with high fever, nausea and acute joint pain. He was diagnosed as suffering from dengue last evening.

 Dr Sumit Sanyal, a doctor at Heritage Hospitals emergency ward, refused to reveal the tourists identity but confirmed that his condition is stable.

 The news is sending shivers down the spine of the travel industry that had been counting on bettering last years record, when an 11.7 per cent growth in overseas tourist inflow had brought $4,789 million (Rs 22,000 crore) in foreign exchange.

 The British had accounted for the highest number 538,750 of foreign tourists in India last year followed by Americans at 521,789, Indian Tourism Authority sources said.

 With a foreign visitor down with dengue amid news that the disease might have struck the Prime Ministers family tour operators are already predicting a slump in business.

 The spread of the disease is being relayed across the world just when the foreign tourist season kicks off in October. This is a bad omen for us, said Satyaprakash Upadhyay, director of Archies Travel Services in Varanasis cantonment area.

 Tour operators based in Delhi and Agra confirmed that calls and emails are pouring in from overseas, cancelling bookings for Agra, Varanasi, Rajasthan and even Khajuraho in Madhya Pradesh.

 Things might get worse if the dengue outbreak continues for long. The foreign tourists especially from Britain, America, France and Canada are extremely scared about mosquito-borne diseases in India, said Sadat Khan, director of Eastern Voyages in Delhi. 

 One of his foreign customers has cancelled a tour of south India, where Kerala reported 700 patients.

 But the strongest fears of an epidemic relate to northern India, where Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Delhi and Punjab are in the grip of the disease.

 The Briton is among five dengue patients in Heritage Hospital. 

 His family in London has been informed and would be arriving soon to take him back.

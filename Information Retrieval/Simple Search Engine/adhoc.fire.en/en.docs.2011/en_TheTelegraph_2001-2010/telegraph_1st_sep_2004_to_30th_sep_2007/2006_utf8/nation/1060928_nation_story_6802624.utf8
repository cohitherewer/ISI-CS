 Rs 3650-cr project for Haldia

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 27: Bengal is set to play host to the largest renewable energy project in the country.

 Environment Energy Tech Services Ltd, a local company, is tying up with US merchant bank Perseus and SREI, a finance company based in Calcutta, to set up a Rs 3,650-crore poly-silicon plant at Haldia.

 Officials from Perseus and the two local companies, accompanied by Haldia MP Lakshman Seth, met chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today and made a presentation.

 Im very happy that the American investor has chosen Bengal for such a prestigious project, Bhattacharjee said after the meeting.

 Seth also revealed that ITC planned to build a hotel in Haldia and has homed in on a 17-acre riverside property. 

 But ITC officials would only say: Were looking to expand in Bengal and are checking out various sites, including Haldia. 

 Poly-silicon is the raw material for a range of products, including solar cells and pumps, and is not produced anywhere in India. Silicon wafers have to be imported from Germany and the US. 

 This will be the fifth such plant in the world after the US, Norway, Germany and Japan, said commerce and industry secretary Sabyasachi Sen.

 The promoters have sought around 600 acres in Haldia, of which the mother plan will require half and the rest will be allotted to industries based on poly-silicon. The land has already been identified. 

 Sen said, together with the downstream industries, the project would employ around 1,000 people. 

 Their target is to begin the work in two months. The company intends to start production by 2009. The plant will come up in two phases. The company will also build a captive power plant, said an official in the chief ministers secretariat.

 Officials said downstream industries could come up to make mobile chargers, night-vision goggles, solar toys, light emitting diodes, solar photo-voltaic products, electronic units, road blinkers, flashers, highway lighting as well as applications in the space sector. 

 Environment Energy has been carrying out village electrification in Bengal.

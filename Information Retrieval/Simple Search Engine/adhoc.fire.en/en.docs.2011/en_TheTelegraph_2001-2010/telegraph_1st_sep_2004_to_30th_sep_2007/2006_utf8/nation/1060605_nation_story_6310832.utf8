 Quantity crucial in Fardeen drug trial

 Mumbai, June 4 (PTI): As a controversy rages over the alleged drugs and drinks party at the Mahajan house in Delhi, a special court will tomorrow hear the plea of actor Fardeen Khan to amend the chargesheet filed against him in a cocaine seizure case.

 The actor has moved the court saying he was negotiating purchase of one gram of cocaine from a drug peddler when the narcotics control bureau arrested him in May 2001.

 This move is considered significant in legal circles as punishment varies according to the quantum of drug found on an accused.

 In case of cocaine, if the quantity found is two grams or less, punishment is six months imprisonment. The court can also let the accused off on probation. The third alternative is committing the accused to a detoxication centre, if it is a first-time offence.

 If the amount of cocaine is above two grams, the minimum punishment under the Narcotic Drug and Psychotrophic Substances Act is 10 years in jail and the maximum is 20 years of imprisonment.

 Police claimed that they had arrested the actor when he was purchasing cocaine from a peddler, Nasir Abdul Karim Khan. A total of nine grams of the narcotic was seized from them, according to the chargesheet.

 Fardeens lawyer Aiyaz Khan has approached the court, demanding that the prosecution may specify the amount of cocaine for which Fardeen will be tried, because according to the actor, he was purchasing only one gram of cocaine from Nasir. The chargesheet is also silent on this.

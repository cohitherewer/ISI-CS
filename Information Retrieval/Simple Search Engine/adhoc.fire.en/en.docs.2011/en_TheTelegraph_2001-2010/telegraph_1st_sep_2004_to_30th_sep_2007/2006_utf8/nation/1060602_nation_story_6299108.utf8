 Are 

 you okay?

 Yes.

 Hows the pain?

 I can hardly speak?.

 A few seconds conversation with his wife on the mobile was all that Sujay Datta could manage this afternoon as he lay writhing in pain on his hospital bed.

 Wednesdays grenade attack had left him separated from his wife and other family members, who have been admitted to different hospitals. The chartered accountant had a hard time trying to gather news about them from his bed at SMHS Hospital in Srinagar. 

 I was with my wife near the back of the bus, sitting next to a window. We had had a great time at Sonamarg and were on our way back to our hotel when it happened in a flash. I just blacked out, Sujay said over the phone from his hospital bed today.

 When I came to, I found myself on the road, my left leg covered in blood. An auto-rickshaw driver rushed to my help. I must say that all through, the local people have been extremely helpful.

 It was only this morning that Sujay learnt his wife Sumona had had surgery on both legs at SKIMS Hospital.

 His parents and parents-in-law, too, were travelling with the couple. My father Swaraj Datta received splinter injuries and had an operation last night. He is still in the ICU since the doctors arent willing to take chances. Ive been told that both my mother and mother-in-law are fine, Sujay said. His father-in-law had suffered minor injuries and was to be released from hospital today.

 The Dattas, who had left their home in Kasba on May 22, had planned to spend a few days in Amritsar, too. But now, its a wait for recovery. Im not sure when we can move out of this place, Sujay said.

 We visited several sites, including Vaishnodevi and Pahalgam. Things were going very well till this attack happened. Im not sure if well think of visiting Kashmir again, Sujay trailed off.

 It was the lure of the perfect honeymoon that had drawn Sisir Chakraborty, 28, and Mrinmoyee Chakraborty, 22, to Kashmir. Sisir, a high school teacher, is badly injured in his right leg and needed a major operation while Mrinmoyee has shrapnel in both legs, said Mrinmoyees father Subhash Kanti Boral, 67, of Uluberia.

 The couple, who married on May 1, had set out from their home in Panchla, Howrah, on May 27 and reached Jammu by train two days later. The Borals heard about the grenade attacks from a local boy and then saw their injured daughter on television yesterday. The elderly couple stayed glued to the box while trying frantically to reach their only daughter.

 Then, around 9.30 last night, Mrinmoyee called up from SMHS Hospital in Srinagar, Subhash said. Im too old to rush to Kashmir, the government should take the responsibility of bringing the injured back.

 Ila Debnath, 16, needed a break after her Madhyamik exams and had been looking forward to this trip. Today, lying in a bed at SMHS Hospital, she just wants to come back home. She took as many as five splinters in her right leg, said nephew Surojit Debnath at Ilas home in Belgharia. Her parents also suffered leg wounds.

 Phulu Roy, 55 (hospital records in Srinagar say she is 63), and Anuradha Sarkar, 56, neighbours in Belgharia, had headed to the mountains on their own, taking a break from family life. Their short-lived freedom turned into a nightmare on Wednesday when Phulu was riddled with splinters around her right knee.

 The hospital told us she is stable but they cant let her go yet, Phulus daughter-in-law Papiya Roy said.

 Anuradha, however, returned to her hotel yesterday with bandages on both feet. Im still scared; I want to go back home, she said from her room in Kohinoor Hotel near Dal Lake.

 My mother is in shock; she keeps saying she wants to come back, her daughter Deepali said. Weve been told the state government is making arrangements to bring the injured back in a day or two.

 CPM members of Parliament Amitava Nandi and Sudhangshu Sil, in Srinagar for a House panel meeting, have visited the injured at the hospitals and hotels.

 The seriously injured will be flown back and the rest brought in buses to New Delhi from where they will board the Rajdhani Express, Nandi said from Kashmir.

 Pratik Chakraborty of Andul has no news of his parents ? Prasanta, 75, and Geeta, 65. He had a glimpse of his injured mother on television on Wednesday. But since then Ive had no news of them, the 32-year-old said.

 Barun Mazumdar, a former AIR newscaster, had left with five members of his family for a cool vacation. The grenade attack left his wife Bandana with a head injury. Barun is unhurt, said his brother-in-law Shyamal Basu, who is also his neighbour in Sibpur.

 Basu had no news of Mazumdars 

 elder son Bibhash who works with a newspaper, daughter-in-law 

 Sushmita, grandchild Rima or younger son Swagata.

 One of the tourists injured in 

 the alleged grenade attacks on two buses in Srinagar is 

 categorised as serious. Swaraj Datta, 70, 

 has multiple perforations in his lower abdomen. He is also 

 a diabetic and has a history of hypertension. Datta is in 

 the intensive care unit of Sardar Maharaja Hari Singh (SMHS) 

 Hospital in Srinagars Karan Nagar. He is a resident 

 of N.K. Ghosal Road, Kasba. Dattas wife, Bithi, is 

 not hurt.

 have a number of doctors specialising in trauma care.

 admitted to. Some were being discharged this evening. Many 

 are in a state of shock and are incoherent.

 visits to the hospitals and also from the first reports 

 of police. Because of a language problem, the police were 

 not able to note down all names and addresses accurately.

 one with whom the patients could communicate in Bengali.

 to be out of danger. Punoo is visiting the hospitals.

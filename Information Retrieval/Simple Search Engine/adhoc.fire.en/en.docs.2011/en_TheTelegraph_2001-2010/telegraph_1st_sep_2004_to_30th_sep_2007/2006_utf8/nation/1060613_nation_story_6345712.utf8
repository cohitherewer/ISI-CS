 Scarred highway hits bill block

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Bangalore, June 12: The countrys biggest private-sector road project appeared headed for more trouble after Karnataka chief minister H.D. Kumaraswamy today said his government would pass a bill to take back excess land allotted to the company working on the expressway.

 They will have our support for construction of the expressway and nothing else. I will not allow farmers land to be gobbled in the name of development, he said, a day after local villagers dug up a 50-metre stretch of the Bangalore-Mysore expressways peripheral road, allegedly incited by the ruling party.

 The road, being constructed by Nandi Infrastructure Corridor Enterprises, was to be opened in a weeks time.

 The gash on the showpiece highway has come at a time when the Bengal government is facing the wrath of farmers who have vowed to fight the acquisition of their land for a Tata Motors project at Singur in Hooghly, 45 km from Calcutta.

 The project has run into a series of roadblocks ever since it was approved, with both Kumaraswamy and his father, former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda, opposing the expressway. Today, too, defiant locals squatted at the dug-up site with vegetable baskets to make the point that they needed access to both sides of the toll road.

 Kumaraswamy ordered a police inquiry into the night assault on the road, but added the probe would also focus on whether the company itself had dug up the stretch to create sympathy. Nandi officials tried to buy me twice earlier and I will not be surprised by their tactics, he said.

 About reports that he owned land falling under the project area and was trying to protect it, Kumaraswamy said he had already declared it in his election affidavit. The land, he added, was outside the project area.

 The issue is whether excess land should be allotted for the project. I am willing to spare an entire day for a public debate, he said, adding that a bill to acquire the excess land would be moved in the next Assembly session beginning June 19.

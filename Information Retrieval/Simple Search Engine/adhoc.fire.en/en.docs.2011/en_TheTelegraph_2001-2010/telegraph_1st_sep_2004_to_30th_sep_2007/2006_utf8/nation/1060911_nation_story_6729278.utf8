 Hyderabad, Sept. 10: The recent haul of rockets in Andhra Pradesh has exposed holes in police intelligence on Maoist activities in the state.

 Director-general Swaranjit Sen, who had claimed that the police had an upper hand in their campaign against the Maoists, is now an anxious man as his assessment appears to have been too optimistic.

 The haul included around 1,000 rockets, 120 rocket launchers, bullets for AK-47 rifles and SLRs and machines for making grenades, rockets and landmines. Literature on wireless technology, and assembly and repair of mobile phones were also part of the cache found during raids on rebel hideouts and from parcels registered with transport companies.

 It appears as if a team of management experts and explosives professionals are working for the Maoists, said a police official.

 It has also been revealed that the Maoists had plans to attack police stations in the state in the next two months and during Dussehra, when vigil is normally slack. Had there been a delay of two more days, the rockets and other explosives would have reached their destination and become untraceable, Sen said.

 The rockets, launchers, gelatine sticks, landmine spares and explosives were registered by road transport services for various locations in the state. Gelatine tubes were booked as tamarind. Rockets and landmine consignments were registered as automobile and tractor parts, said a senior police official.

 Around 300 rockets, launchers and 150 landmines have reached locations in Visakhapatnam, Kadapa, Khammam, Vijayawada and Nellore, he added.

 Through the addresses given by the transport companies, we are trying to piece together the transit of the explosives from Nallamala and Chennai, said Sen.

 Police sketch

 Chennai police have released a sketch of Srinivas Reddy, a resident of Andhras Kadapa district, who had booked a consignment of rockets from Ambathur in Tamil Nadu.

 Four parcels containing rocket shells and two launchers were booked for Kadapa through a private transport operator, Kranti Transport Corporation. 

 Andhra police have already arrested Hanumant Reddy, Srinivass accomplice and a known Maoist sympathiser, in Kadapa.

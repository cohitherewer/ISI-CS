 Arundhati rejects Akademi award

 New Delhi, Jan. 14 (PTI): Author and activist Arundhati Roy has declined this years Sahitya Akademi Award, saying she cannot accept the honour from an institution linked to the government whose policies she opposes.

 Roy, who won the 1997 Booker Prize for her first novel The God of Small Things, has rejected the award in a single-page fax message, Akademi secretary K. Sachidanandan said. 

 A leading environmental activist and opponent of big dams, Roy has slammed Indias economic policies that she says have caused unsustainable environmental damage.

 Sachidanandan said the author declined the award because she did not want to have it from an institution she believed was linked to the government.

 But we are trying to persuade her to reconsider her decision. We are telling her that the Akademi is intellectually and culturally purely autonomous although it is funded by the government, he said.

 Sachidanandan, however, added the Akademi would not replace her nomination.

 There have been many occasions when we opposed government policies ourselves. There is absolutely no question of replacing Roy with anybody else. She will remain our awardee.

 Roy was named for the award for her book The Algebra of Infinite Justice.

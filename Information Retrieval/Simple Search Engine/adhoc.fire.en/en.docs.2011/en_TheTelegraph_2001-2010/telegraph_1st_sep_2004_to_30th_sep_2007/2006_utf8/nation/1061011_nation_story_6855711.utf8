 Album row

 Mumbai, Oct. 10 (Reuters): US heavy metal band Slayers latest album has been recalled from music stores across India after the Christian community said the cover depicting Christ with amputated arms and a missing eye was insulting.

 Christian groups said the album Christ Illusion did not only have an offensive image on its cover, but some of the songs such as Skeleton Christ and Jihad hurt the sensibilities of Christians and Muslims alike.

 We took strong exception to the album which is offensive and in very bad taste, said Joseph Dias of Mumbais Catholic Secular Forum.

 The protests prompted EMI Music to pull the album from all music stores and its depots.

 Last week, we recalled all the albums and destroyed them as we did not want any community to be hurt, said T. Suresh, the companys general manager.

 Rahul: Bail blow

 New Delhi, June 9: After a rough first night in his shared prison cell, Rahul Mahajan today learnt he must spend at least another four days in Tihar jail with a magistrate deferring his bail plea till June 13.

 Rahul, who nearly fainted in court yesterday while being sent to judicial remand till June 22, needed medicines for high blood pressure this morning. He complained he couldnt sleep well last night, and sources said he was up most of the time, talking to his two cell mates in cell number 3 of ward number 4.

 Police officers claimed Rahul had confessed to taking drugs on the night he fell ill and was rushed to hospital, but one of the defence lawyers said the claim was inconsequential.

 The interrogation team were told by Rahul Mahajan that he had consumed drugs on the night of the 1st (June), said additional deputy commissioner Manish Agarwal, the chief investigating officer.

 What the police get out of him is insignificant. He hasnt said (this) before the magistrate, Rahuls lawyer Sunil Mittal argued.

 The magistrate who heard the bail plea hoped that on June 13, the prosecution would be able to take a stand? once and for all regarding the quantity of the drug involved. By then, the quantitative reports from the Central Forensic Science Laboratory are likely to be available.

 The court will hear Rahuls bail petition together with that of Sahil Zaroo, the youth accused of buying the drugs that allegedly made Rahul ill and killed his father Pramods secretary Bibek Moitra. Sahil, whose judicial remand ends on June 13, was taken to hometown Srinagar and his home was searched along with the house of a relative.

 Jail sources said no special arrangements had been made for the son of the late Pramod Mahajan. He was served ordinary jail food, starting with a breakfast of bread and vegetable curry.

 The sources said his day began with prayer at 7 am with other inmates and he participated in moral classes at 10 am.

 As a court had yesterday ordered it to do, the police today registered a first information report against Apollo Hospital, accusing doctors and management of misleading them with false information on Rahul. 

 The court had also given the police permission to seize relevant records from the hospital, including its casualty registers and pathology reports, after the investigators said these might have been tampered with.

 The hospital today denied the allegation. Apollo maintains that it has fully cooperated with the police investigations and provided all the records and information sought by the investigating agency, it said.

 Fog over appeal in weak Jessica case

 AYSWARIA VENUGOPAL

 Jessica Lal

 New Delhi, Feb. 22: The prosecution in the Jessica Lal murder today hemmed and hawed about appealing against yesterdays verdict despite widespread public disappointment at the mass acquittals of the well-connected accused.

 The defence team, on the other hand, crowed that filing an appeal would be difficult after the judgment has shown up how weak the prosecutions case was.

 All nine defendants ? who included politicians sons and senior executives ? had walked free from a Delhi court which, after a seven-year trial, ruled the evidence was insufficient. Though Jessica was shot dead at a party crowded with businessmen, socialites and other VIPs, few had come forward to testify ? and some of those who did later turned hostile.

 One prosecution witness had said prime accused Manu Sharma had fired twice (once in the air and once ? fatally ? at the victim) but forensic experts declared that the two bullets came from different guns.

 Senior police officers were today unsure about an appeal in Delhi High Court, with special prosecutor S.K. Saxena, who handled the case, offering the familiar argument that he had to see the judgment first.

 There is a chance for appeal if there are two views ? one supporting the prosecution and the other in favour of the defence. In such cases, the scales tilt in favour of the accused, was all Saxena had to say.

 Defence lawyer R.K. Naseem claimed: It will be difficult to appeal as the case was inherently weak. The case is weak even if you record the statements of the eyewitnesses one month after the incident. Also, forensic analysis weakened the prosecution story and contradicted it.

 Another advocate, Abhishek Rai, however, said that if a person is acquitted and the state is unwilling to challenge the judgment, the victims family can appeal to a higher court for a revision. That court can order a retrial if it finds too many lapses and gaps in the investigation.

 Rai backed legislation for witness protection to tackle the problem of witnesses turning hostile. There is a bill pending in Parliament?. Supreme Court judgments, particularly in the Best Bakery case, can also provide grounds for a retrial if there is apprehension of threat or allurement to eyewitnesses.

 In the Best Bakery case, the apex court had remarked on acquittals based on tainted evidence from a tailored investigation, unprincipled prosecutor and perfunctory trial and evidence of threatened/terrorised witnesses?.

 Delhi University law faculty member B.B. Pande said a conviction in cases like this can be based on circumstantial evidence, too. The case speaks volumes about our investigations, defence and prosecution.

 The Delhi governments directorate of prosecution will decide on an appeal on the advice of legal experts, the public prosecutor and the police.

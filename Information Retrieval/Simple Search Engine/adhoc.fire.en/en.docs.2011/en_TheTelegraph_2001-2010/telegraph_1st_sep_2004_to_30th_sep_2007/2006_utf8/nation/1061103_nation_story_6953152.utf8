 Uma loses all: Prayer kit and polls

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Uma: In tears

 Bhopal, Nov. 2: Uma Bharti had already shed bucketfuls of tears for the dear things she had lost since Mondays bypolls when news of her biggest loss was officially announced.

 She that is, her nominee had been trounced in the prestige battle on Umas home turf of Bada Malehra, severely denting her prospects in Madhya Pradesh politics.

 Completing the rout, the ruling BJP also retained the Vidisha Lok Sabha seat, romping home by over 85,000 votes as Umas candidate Raghunandan Sharma finished third.

 I have lost everything dear to me, the sadhvi wept this afternoon, but dwelt mainly on the personal belongings she said were snatched from her during post-poll violence.

 When I took sanyas, I was given a special mala (string of prayer beads) which I am supposed to carry with me all the time. (My) statues of Gajmani and Lord Shankar are missing, too. Is this the way to settle political scores? she asked.

 Uma was apparently robbed of her mobile phone, too.

 But it was the loss of the Bada Malehra Assembly seat where she had won by 50,000 votes in 2003 that she seemed to find hardest to stomach.

 Uma had camped in her pocket borough and campaigned at virtually every village for two weeks, seeking votes for Bundelkhand ki beti. But her nominee Rekha Yadav lost to the BJPs Kapoor Chand Guhara by 3,600 votes, with the Congresss Jagdish Shukla finishing third.

 After the results were announced, an angry Uma returned her z-category security.

 I have lost faith in my security guards. In fact, I fear that I will be eliminated by these very people as the state has turned against me, she said, adding that after polling ended on Monday, BJP goons had tried to kill her.

 Uma has been making these allegations since Tuesday, with the BJP sneering that she was trying to make up an excuse for an impending defeat.

 The stakes were high for Uma, who had been describing the BJP victory in the 2003 Assembly polls as a personal triumph.

 Her ties with the party brass had turned sour in July 2004 when a district court in Hubli, Karnataka, issued a warrant against her in connection with a political agitation in the state.

 Uma, then chief minister, resigned taking the high moral ground. Following her acquittal, she tried to get back her chair but the central BJP leadership stood in the way. In October 2005, she tried to force her way in leading to disciplinary action, after which she floated the breakaway Bhartiya Janshakti Party.

 Mondays byelections were the first major test between the BJP and the breakaway group.

 Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan crowed: I have all along maintained that the organisation is bigger than an individual.

 In Vidisha, which fell vacant after Chauhan resigned on becoming chief minister a year ago, public health engineering minister Rampal Singh routed the Congresss Rajshri Singh.

 The results have dented the state Congresss hopes of hitting the comeback trail sometime soon.

 Maoists put a prize on top Andhra heads

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA 

 Hyderabad, Aug. 11: Maoists angry at the killing of a key pointman in Andhra Pradesh have released a list that sets cash awards for those who shoot down the states top policemen, politicians and bureaucrats.

 Copies of the list of 62 individuals on whose heads there is a price were pasted on walls and passed on as handbills in Telengana. The list was also sent to some newspaper offices in other towns of the district. Madhav, a Maoist state secretary who himself had a Rs 22-lakh reward on his head, was gunned down on July 22.

 According to the list, announced by Raghu, secretary of the Maoists North Telengana region, director-general of police Swaranjit Sen has Rs 5 lakh on his head while state intelligence chief Aravinda Rao has Rs 3 lakh. Chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy and his colleagues are next in the pecking order.

 The new threat comes days after police went on high-alert in Hyderabad following tip-offs that a 25-member suicide squad was in the city targeting the state secretariat and other key government installations.

 On Wednesday, DGP Sen said three suicide squads have been moving around the state capital since the past week. 

 We have reports they conducted reconnaissance on the secretariat, police establishments, MLA quarters and the assembly building, he added. 

 Security forces and bomb squads have laid siege to the 25-acre secretariat, which has 12,000 employees, including 300 top officials, the chief minister and his colleagues, after reports that two Maoists spent nearly three hours there. 

 Legislators have been advised not leave without escort, and security at the homes of ministers both in the capital and in their native districts has been reinforced.

 The police arrested a woman Maoist commander in a private hospital in Srikakulam while another female activist, convalescing in the same hospital, escaped.

 We have beefed up our information networks also to identify the activists, said intelligence chief Rao. The Assembly session begins from August 17 and the Ganesh festival is only 15 days away events when the police believe a Maoist strike is likely.

 The Maoists have, however, trashed the theory that their groups are prowling the capital, saying the police were spreading the lie. 

 This is nothing but a campaign to turn the public against us, Raghu said.

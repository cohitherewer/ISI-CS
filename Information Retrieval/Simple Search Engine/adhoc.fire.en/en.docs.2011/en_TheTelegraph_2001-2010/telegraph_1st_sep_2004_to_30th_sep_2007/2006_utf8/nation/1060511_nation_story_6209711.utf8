 No-patent cry for HIV lifeline

 New Delhi, May 10: Networks of people living with HIV have asked Indian authorities to deny a patent on a key anti-HIV drug, warning that such a patent would pull the drug out of reach of millions worldwide.

 The Indian Network for People Living with HIV and the Delhi Network of Positive People have registered their opposition against a patent application by US-based drug company, Gilead Sciences, on a drug called tenofovir disoproxil fumarate.

 Health activists and lawyers joined them in staging a protest march near Parliament today. Granting this patent will be chopping our lifeline, said Loon Gangte, a member of the network.

 Tenofovir is emerging as an important option for patients whore about to start anti-HIV treatment as well as for patients who have already been taking other anti-HIV drugs and show resistance to those treatments.

 HIV-positive people and health activists are concerned that if a patent on tenofovir is granted, it will prevent other drug manufacturers from making cheaper generic versions of the medicine. 

 The humanitarian agency, Medicins Sans Frontieres, which provides anti-HIV treatment to 60,000 people worldwide, procures 84 per cent of its drugs from Indian generic manufacturers.

 The high cost of the drug is severely restricting access to treatment, said Hans van de Weerd, head of the agency in India. We need more manufacturers to produce generic versions of this drug. The more the suppliers, the lower the prices.

 Public interest lawyers who have provided technical support to the networks have argued that tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is a salt created from an existing compound ? tenofovir. This is a common practice in the drug industry and should not be interpreted as an innovation, said Tahir Amin, a lawyer with the Alternative Law Forum in Bangalore.

 An Indian drug manufacturer is already producing a generic version of tenofovir and selling it at a price much lower than the cost of Gileads tenofovir in the international market, said Leena Menghaney, a lawyer with MSF India.

 The cost of Gileads product in the developed countries is $5,700 per patient per year. But the Indian generic version is available at $800. We need five or six generic versions in the market to make prices fall even further, she said. 

 Anti-HIV drugs can extend the lives of HIV-infected people. The introduction of generic versions of the first-generation anti-HIV drugs by Indian drug companies helped sharply reduce treatment costs.

 I think those opposing the patent application have a strong argument, said Chandra Gulhati, editor of the Monthly Index of Medical Specialities, an independent journal of drugs. 

 It is estimated that some 500,000 HIV-infected people in India today require anti-HIV treatment.

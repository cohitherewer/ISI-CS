 Dead baby heat in Punjab police face

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Chandigarh, June 28: The cops deny they have the babys blood on their hands. Its mother says she lost her child because of the merciless police beating while she was in labour.

 Even the midwife has been dragged into the controversy.

 The alleged beating of the pregnant woman late on Monday evening in Kuttiwal, a village in Ajnala, about 35 km from Amritsar, has sent shock waves across Punjab amid cries that it is another instance of increasing police brutality in the state.

 We are probing the matter, said Gautam Cheema, the special superintendent of police in Majitha.

 Yesterday, the woman, Raj, her dead baby on her lap, had narrated her tale at a news conference in Amritsar organised by Awaz-e-Awam, an NGO.

 Raj said she was beaten because Dalbir Singh, a landlord, had filed a complaint that her brother Jaspal Masih, who worked for Dalbir, stole jewellery from his house.

 The police did not care that I was already writhing in pain before the delivery. I fell at their feet but the merciless beating did not stop, Raj, who has been living with her father Jaan Masih for the past six months, said from her bed in a hospital where she was admitted for a medical examination.

 This is a case of brutality at its best by Punjab police. The baby, which was buried yesterday, disappeared from its grave today morning. But we had got the post-mortem done. The police should have conducted it yesterday, said Awaz-e-Awam vice-president Bhupinder Singh Sandhu.

 Sandhu added local residents said the infants remains were dug up at the behest of the police and taken to an unknown destination by Rajs husband. They want to destroy all evidence. 

 Majitha police denied that their personnel were involved. They produced the midwife, Chando, and some villagers before the media who denied that the police came to Rajs house.

 Sandhu said Chando has been changing her statement every day. On Monday, she said the police entered Rajs house and that even she had pleaded with them to spare her as she was in labour. Yesterday, she said the police came but did not enter the house. Today, she claims the police never came. We want an independent probe.

 Rajs father said the trouble started on June 20 after he and his son approached the landlord for money to meet Rajs delivery expenses. Instead, he began asking us for money that we owed him. We were shocked. (Then) he accused Jaspal of stealing jewellery worth Rs 80,000 from the house.

 The Punjab Scheduled Caste Commission has sought an explanation from the police. The state human rights commission, too, has taken cognisance of the matter.

 Opposition leader Parkash Singh Badal said police excesses have reached alarming levels. Chief minister Amarinder Singh said he has sought a report on the incident.

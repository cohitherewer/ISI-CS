 Cops eyes on no. 138

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Bangalore, Oct. 27: Karnataka police have had their gaze fixed on accused number 138 in the Bombay blasts case since the anti-terror court judge started delivering verdicts.

 The man bearing the number is Mustafa Ahmed Dossa, alias Mustafa Majnu, wanted in the southern state for the murder of smuggler M.B. Moosa and his driver. The duo was bumped off 100 km from Bangalore in 1992. 

 Dossa, infamous as a Mumbai smuggler, is the prime accused in this case, but had been absconding for a long time. After the 1993 Bombay blasts, in which he and his brother have been charged, Dossa fled to Dubai. He was deported to India in March 2003.

 The detectives investigating Moosas murder have moved an application before the special judge of the anti-terror court in Mumbai seeking to question him. We were told to await the final outcome of the blasts case. Dossas case has been separated from the main trial. We are watching the proceedings closely. We have to produce him before a magistrate in our case, an officer said.

 Getting Dossa wont be easy, though. Gujarat police want him in an old smuggling case while the Enforcement Directorate seeks to record his statement in a match-fixing probe into a 1999 triangular series featuring India, Pakistan and West Indies. 

 The Karnataka case is rather sensational. According to the chargesheet, Moosa was assigned the job of landing silver and contraband for the Dossa gang. A missing silver consignment raised Dossas suspicion, though Moosa reasoned it had been loaded on a boat that had sunk off the Tamil Nadu coast.

 Hardly the sort to buy the story, Dossa flew to Mangalore along with cronies, met Moosa at his hotel and had a hearty dinner during which the Karnataka smuggler suggested they travel to Chennai to find out the truth. They were to meet a landing agent there.

 The next morning, they hit the road in two vehicles. Dossa travelled with Moosa in the latters Mercedes. A Gypsy followed the sedan. 

 Near Mulbagal, 100 km from here, the convoy veered off the highway. Dossa allegedly shot Moosa and his driver at point-blank range. 

 The driver of the Gypsy, T. Bawa, was shot at, too, but managed to flee and inform the police. The Gypsy was later found abandoned near the office of the directorate of revenue intelligence in Bangalore.

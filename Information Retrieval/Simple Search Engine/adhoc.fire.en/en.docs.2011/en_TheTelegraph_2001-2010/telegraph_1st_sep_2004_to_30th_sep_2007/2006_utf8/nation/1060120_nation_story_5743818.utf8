 Ulfa calls to remind ONGC

 OUR BUREAU

 Jan. 19: The Ulfa has followed up its letter demanding Rs 500 crore from the ONGC with a telephone call enquiring about the payment.

 Ominously, police also warned that the secessionist outfit was planning sabotage ahead of Republic Day. 

 Police sources said the ONGCs Assam asset headquarters at Nazira received an anonymous call. The caller identified himself as a senior member of the Ulfas 28 battalion two days ago, asking about the payment. 

 The call came after the expiry of the 15-day deadline the rebels had set the company for making the payment in an extortion note dated January 1. 

 Confirming this, Assam director-general of police D.N. Dutta said: A couple of days ago, after the expiry of the outfits deadline, an ONGC official at Nazira received a phone call about the payment. 

 The director-general of police, however, said the police were enquiring whether the call was indeed from the Ulfa. 

 ONGC chairman Subir Raha today said the Ulfa threat to the company was an issue that the Assam government was looking into. 

 Raha said the ONGC management had handed over the letter received by post to the local police. 

 Assam police were now investigating the letter, demanding Rs 500 crore from the ONGC as extortion money, he added. 

 He asserted that the ONGCs work schedule in Assam had not been affected in any way. 

 Senior officials added that the governments policy was not to give in to such demands. 

 They said security has been beefed up at all ONGC installations in the Northeast and safety of personnel and equipment would be accorded highest priority. 

 Inspector-general of police (special branch) Khagen Sarma said preliminary investigation into the authenticity of the demand note indicated that the letter was issued by the Ulfa. 

 But in Jorhat, Assam chief minister Tarun Gogoi said the veracity of the extortion notice was yet to be ascertained, adding that full protection has been provided to the ONGC. 

 When asked whether the Ulfa extortion demand to the ONGC could trip the ongoing peace process, Gogoi said it was very unfortunate that the outfit was still continuing with its anti-social activities at this crucial juncture, when a peace process was on. 

 In another development, Guwahati police last night arrested three Ulfa activists near Gauhati University and seized arms and ammunition from them.

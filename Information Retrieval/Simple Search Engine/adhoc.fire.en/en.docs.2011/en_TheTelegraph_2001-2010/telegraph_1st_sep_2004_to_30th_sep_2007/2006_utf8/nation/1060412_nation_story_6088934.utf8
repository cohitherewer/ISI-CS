 Kutch deer

 Ahmedabad (PTI): Salman Khan may have more trouble coming his way in connection with a similar incident in Kutch district in 1998 when he was shooting for a movie.

 The actor allegedly shot two chinkaras at Sumasara village during the shooting of Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam but investigating officials could not get any evidence against him and actress Aishwarya Rai, a senior forest department official said. 

 However, wildlife activist Amit Jethva has sought the case papers from the forest department and plans to move court after receiving the details of the probe and the case.

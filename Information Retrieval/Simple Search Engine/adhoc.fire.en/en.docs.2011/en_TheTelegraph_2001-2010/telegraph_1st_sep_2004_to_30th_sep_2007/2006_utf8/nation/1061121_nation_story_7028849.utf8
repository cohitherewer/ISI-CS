 Upgrade for Andamans airport

 SANJAY MANDAL

 Calcutta, Nov. 20: Foul weather may not be able to scare away planes from Port Blair next monsoon. 

 The Airports Authority of India (AAI) and the Andaman and Nicobar administration are working on a project to upgrade Port Blair airport. 

 An instrumental landing system (ILS) and Category-I lighting will be installed on the runway to facilitate landing even when visibility is poor, said S.P.S. Bakshi, the airports authoritys executive director for the eastern region. 

 The work will be jointly done by the Andamans administration and the AAI. Efforts will be made to complete it by next monsoon, Bakshi said.

 There are two major components of new landing system the localiser, which aligns the aircraft to the centreline of the runway, and the glide path that gives the pilot the correct angle at which to descend. Bakshi said the localiser has already been installed for a trial. 

 Parts of the surrounding hills need to be levelled for the installation of the (device to determine) glide path, said Dharam Pal, the Andamans civil aviation secretary. 

 Now, a pilot needs visibility of 3,000 m to land at Port Blair. With the installation of CAT-I, it will come down to 550 m. The revamped terminal building will be centrally air-conditioned and the number of parking bays increased from two to five. There will be an additional taxi bay. 

 Before the tsunami hit the islands in 2004, one lakh tourists used to go there every year. Last year, the number came down to around 32,000, but there has been an upswing this year.

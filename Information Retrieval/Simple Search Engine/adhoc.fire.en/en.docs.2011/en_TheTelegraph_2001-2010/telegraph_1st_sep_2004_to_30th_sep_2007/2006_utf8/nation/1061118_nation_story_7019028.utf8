 Familiar tension before trip kills hope

 JEHANGIR S. POCHA 

 Beijing, Nov. 17: In a replay of history, the Sino-Indian border dispute has escalated just ahead of Chinese President Hu Jintaos visit to India next week. 

 The fallout has analysts warning there is no chance of a breakthrough during Hus visit, ensuring India and China will continue without an agreement on a common line of control. 

 It is Chinas hope to make some progress during Hus visit, said Jin Linbo, director of Asia Pacific studies at the China Institute of Foreign Studies in Beijing. But wishing is one thing and reality is another.

 The regularity with which the border issue sours ahead of state visits is leading many to wonder if China and India are deliberately scuttling hope of a solution at least for now. 

 Privately, officials in both countries say the technical terms of a mutually agreeable border are already obvious. 

 Only some minor give and take of land is necessary to allow both parties to save face and preserve national dignity, said Sun Shihai, deputy director of the Institute of Asia Pacific Studies in Beijing. The real problem in both China and India is being able to get people to accept the solution. 

 In China, the Communist Party has based so much of its credibility and legitimacy on uniting all of mother China after 150 years of humiliation at the hand of foreigners that it is nervous about seen to be giving up even a square inch of land. 

 The ruling party in Delhi is always fearful of any compromise that will give the Opposition the chance to accuse it of selling out. 

 Some Indian analysts, such as Brahma Chellaney, professor of strategic studies at the Centre for Policy Research in New Delhi, also say China keeps the border issue burning to distract and unsettle India. 

 There is no doubt that China has geo-political interests in Indias Northeast and Bengal, as well as in Myanmar and Bangladesh. Beijing would like to connect these regions to its own landlocked western provinces. For example, it would be easier for southern Yunnan province to move its exports and imports through Chittagong or Calcutta than through Shenzhen. 

 Beijing would also like to pipe the oil in this area to its southern provinces and gain strategic access to the Bay of Bengal.

 Indian security officials say China is using its friendship with the CPM in Bengal, as well as its close ties with Bangladesh and Myanmar, to push this agenda. 

 But this does not automatically mean China has evil designs on India or is keeping the border issue simmering in bad faith, Sun said. Chinas main goal is economic development and stability, and an unresolved border undermines both these objectives, he added. 

 Part of China and Indias insecurity over the border dispute stems from the misconceptions their own propaganda has created. 

 The land in question does not belong to either China or India it is disputed. If this is understood, it will be easier for people to accept a negotiated solution.

 In Suns opinion, this would entail China getting Tawang in Arunachal Pradesh and giving India some land in the western sector. This is unacceptable to India.

 Indias own clumsy diplomacy is partly responsible for bringing things to this point. When Atal Bihari Vajpayee visited China in 2003 as Prime Minister he made a subtle but important change in Indias Tibet policy. 

 India announced, for the first time, that Tibet is part of China, said Jin. 

 Although Delhi tried to downplay the move by saying there was no change, Vajpayees statement has led the Chinese to think India now recognises all their claims on Tibet.

 Since much of Arunachal Pradesh, including Tawang, is Tibetan, the Chinese feel India should hand over the area, a claim that was expressed by the Chinese ambassador in New Delhi, Sun Yuxi, recently, kicking up a controversy. 

 A Western diplomat in Beijing said the problem is one of different mindsets. 

 The Chinese are pragmatists and result-oriented, they know how to close a deal. The Indians open issues but dont know how to close them. Breakthroughs dont come about as gentlemans agreements. They come about as outcome of tough politics.

 Return of the water tiger

 The Mahseer

 Srinagar, Sept. 13 (Reuters): A giant freshwater carp nearly extinct in Kashmir might soon swim again in the shimmering rivers of the Himalayas decades after it disappeared.

 The Mahseer, known among Kashmiri anglers as tiger in the water, all but vanished after Pakistan constructed a dam in the late 1960s that stopped the fish from migrating to India.

 Now, conservationists are breeding the Mahseer and hope to release them in rivers in Kashmir. The programme is the result of a peace process between India and Pakistan that has led to a drop in violence in the region.

 We have bred this fish nicely and reared it out, Showkat Ali, joint director of Kashmirs fisheries department, said.

 Ali said hundreds of Mahseer used to migrate to Kashmir each year until Pakistan completed the Mangla dam in 1967 across the Jhelum river, the traditional migratory route for the fish.

 The omnivorous red-finned Mahseer, scientifically known as Tor tor, is prized by anglers because of its huge size reaching up to 9 feet and weighing up to 54 kg and for its fighting spirit.

 The fish lives in clear rivers and lakes throughout India and Southeast Asia and needs fast-flowing rivers and streams in the mountains to breed.

 Finding enough of the thick-scaled carp in the area to breed at a farm in southern Kashmir proved difficult. 

 Over time, enough were collected and fisheries officials plan to introduce young Mahseers into Kashmirs rivers and lakes in the months.

 Two more breeding farms are planned in the region, including one in the Uri area, near the Line of Control.

 Local anglers hope the programme will bring back an exciting sport.

 I am sure, inshallah (god willing), the return of the fish will attract more anglers to Kashmir, Mohammad Amin, 65, said. For me, fishing for Mahseer is only a dream now, the last catch was 15 years ago.

 To fulfil the dream, militancy in Kashmir needs to remain under control. Plans to conserve the Mahseer were disrupted in 1989 after militancy erupted in Kashmir.

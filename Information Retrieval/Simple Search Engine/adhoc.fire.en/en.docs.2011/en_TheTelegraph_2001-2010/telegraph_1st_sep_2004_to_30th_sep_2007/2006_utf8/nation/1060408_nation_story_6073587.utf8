 New Delhi, April 7: Attorney-general Milon K. Banerjee is believed to have told Prime Minister Manmohan Singh that the chief election commissioner can recommend the removal of his colleague only if there is evidence of his misconduct after joining the poll panel.

 Singh had sought advice from Banerjee after the President forwarded to him an NDA memorandum seeking the removal of election commissioner Naveen Chawla for allegedly accepting funds for an NGO from members of a particular political party.

 The attorney-general cited a 1993 Supreme Court judgment to support his advice, sources said.

 Study on Bengal nuke plant

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, June 19: Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today said the Centre had greenlighted a nuclear power station at Egra in East Midnapore district. 

 The Centre has agreed in principle to the setting up of a nuclear power station in the state and we have asked CES (Consulting Engineering Services) to carry out a feasibility study, Bhattacharjee said while opening a CES office in Salt Lake.

 He added that the site in Egra, about 125 km from Calcutta, was yet to be chosen. 

 The move comes years after a proposal to evaluate the Sunderbans as a nuclear reactor site was dropped following opposition from environmental groups. 

 A Bengal power department source, however, said though the government wants a nuclear power station in the state, the Centre had yet to take a decision. The central government selects sites after their investigation and assessment. Nothing has been finalised.

 The Puja paradox

 Calcutta, July 11: A few weeks back, at a para meeting to discuss Pujas-2006 when Kaberi Ghosh Roy offered to step down from the post of secretary, little did anyone realise it was the last time she was attending the Durga Puja meeting at Dum Dum Park.

 Last year, Kaberidi was one of the joint secretaries of our puja committee and Ashishda (her husband) was the man in charge of preparing the structure of the pandal. That has been the way for years and we were all used to this set-up. This year, she suddenly decided to step down to make way for Shubranjit Das Majumdar, who too was supposed to join the group. We had made grand plans this year. But now, I think well just hold the puja for the sake of it without any frills, said Susrut Dhar, one of the members of the Puja committee.

 This afternoon, as the news of the deaths gradually sank in, many realised that they had a close shave.

 When Shubranjits father Subir Das Majumdar was chalking out the plan, some 22 members form the locality were supposed to be part of the trip. But since this time many of us had decided to share the responsibility of the puja with Shubranjit, we just opted out, said Mondip Chakrabarty.

 We can never get over the fact that so many lives from Dum Dum Park alone were snuffed out during a trip which was meant to be pure fun. Forget the pujas, the memory of the deceased will continue to haunt us for anything that we plan to do in our para, said Sanjay Banerjee.

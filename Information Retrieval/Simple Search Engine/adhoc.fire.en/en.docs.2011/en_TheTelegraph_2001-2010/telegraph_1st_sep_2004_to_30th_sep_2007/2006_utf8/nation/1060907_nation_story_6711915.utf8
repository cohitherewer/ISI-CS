The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Court threat over Mataram

 OUR BUREAU AND AGENCIES

 New Delhi, Sept. 6: As 

 the country prepared to celebrate 100 years of Vande 

 Mataram, a Muslim cleric body today threatened to move 

 court if any student from the community is forced to sing 

 the national song.

 We object to forced recitation of Vande Mataram by Muslims, Jamiat Ulema-i-Hind general secretary Maulana Mahmood Madani said a day before the 101st anniversary of the songs adoption by the Congress.

 If forced to sing, we will take this issue to court, the Rajya Sabha member added.

 Madanis threat came on a day a top leader of another minority body said he cannot prevent Sikhs from singing the song even in schools run by the Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee. 

 I, alone, am not powerful enough to direct all members of the community not to sing the national song, said SGPC chief Avtar Singh Makkar.

 Makkar had yesterday asked SGPC-run schools not to sing the song tomorrow as it does not fulfil the aspirations of minorities.

 Later in the evening, he issued an amended press statement saying the Vande Mataram could be sung in all schools.

 Most states said singing the national song in schools and colleges would not be compulsory while most of those ruled by the BJP made arrangements for its mandatory recitation.

 Madani asked Muslim children not to skip school tomorrow and urged them to resist through non-violent means any attempt to force them to sing.

 We (Muslims) are very much patriotic. We dont feel any necessity of proving our patriotism by singing Vande Mataram, which goes against our religious belief, he said.

 Vande Mataram has not been a part of the Indian Constitution; nor has it been obligatory for citizens to recite it, he said.

 We deeply love our motherland and sacrificed our lives for it. But we cannot give it the exalted status of God. We can salute our motherland, but cannot worship it, he added.

 The Jamiats threat came in the wake of BJP-ruled Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh making it mandatory for all schoolchildren to sing Vande Mataram. BJP-ruled Jharkhand, too, has made it mandatory to sing the song. So have Orissa and Karnataka, where the BJP is part of the government.

 But it is not compulsory in Bihar, where the BJP is part of the Janata Dal (United)-led ruling alliance. Gujarat, where the BJP is in power, too, has already decided to follow a central circular that stays clear of compulsion.

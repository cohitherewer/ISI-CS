 Money to save girl in womb and after

 New Delhi, Dec. 18: The Centre has proposed an insurance cover of Rs 1 lakh for every girl child to save her life from being nipped in the womb and see her through the early years.

 The suggestion has come with the increasing realisation that governments and the civil society are not being able to stop the killing of female foetuses despite tightening of laws.

 The sex ratio in Delhi, Haryana and Punjab continues to dip even after the Centre tightened the pre-natal diagnostic act to stop detection of the gender of the foetus and female foeticide.

 Under the insurance scheme, the government will provide cash to the family of a girl child, preferably the mother. But she would get the money only after she fulfils certain conditions like registering the childs birth, immunising her on time, enrolling her in school and ensuring that she does not drop out before completing Class XII.

 Last but not least is the condition that the girls marriage is delayed till she is at least 18.

 The multi-pronged strategy takes care of many of the conditions that are pulling the girl child back. Not only is it a deterrent for female foeticide, it also provides an incentive to enrol the child in school and not pull her out. Despite increasing enrolment, the dropout rate among girls is still very high.

 The scheme is also aimed at tackling the high rate of child marriages that are taking place regardless of the child marriage prevention act.

 The ministry of women and children, which has been negotiating with the Planning Commission for a separate component for women in every scheme, has suggested that the insurance proposal be included in the 11th Five Year Plan.

 The commission which is under pressure from activists like Jean Dreze, who have criticised the draft five-year plan for not allocating enough money to the Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS) has to agree to the insurance proposal for it to materialise.

 Earlier, the human resource development ministry had proposed making education free for girls from Class VI to XII. But private schools reluctant to introduce the scheme went to court.

 The Central Board of Secondary Education developed cold feet and backed out. It issued a circular making the adoption of the scheme optional.

 There are several schemes for girls. Among them are Balika Samriddha, which is aimed at helping the child with her education, and the Kasturba Gandhi scheme for tribal girls. 

 There are also schemes under the ICDS.

 Man scoots after Jessica alibi drama

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Jessica: What next?

 Chandigarh, Sept. 30: A lawyer today dashed out of a news conference, journalists hot on his heels, moments after throwing a spanner in the reopened Jessica Lal murder case by standing alibi for a hostile witness.

 Jalandhar-based Anshu Sharma had invited the reporters to the Chandigarh Press Club to reveal that the now-dead witness, Karan Rajput, couldnt have been at the scene of the crime.

 On the night of April 29, 1999, when the model was shot dead in Delhis Tamarind Court bar, Rajput was huddled in Jalandhar with him, Sharma claimed.

 But as the journalists pounced on him, firing questions on the unexplained parts in his version, Sharma hurried out of the room and ran towards his car.

 I have done my job, he told the chasing journalists, but they had by then shut the club gates.

 Forced to climb out of his car, Sharma repeated that he only wanted to help a dead man and claimed that since he was a lawyer, he could not be grilled by reporters.

 Everything is there in my press statement, he added, got into his car again and sped away, nearly running over a man on a bicycle.

 A local advocate suggested that Sharmas move could only have been an attempt to derail the fresh investigations.

 There can be no other motive. What has happened will delay the case. It has given more ammunition to the accused to defend themselves, he said.

 Sharmas media interaction was organised by an associate member of the club. A close aide of Haryana power and public works minister Venod Sharma, father of prime accused Manu Sharma, was on the club premises.

 The lawyer began by saying he had come to defend a dead man whose face he had recognised on television, which was showing tapes of a sting operation by Tehelka on hostile witnesses in the case.

 I saw a photograph of Karan Rajput on TV on September 26 and realised he had come to me to seek help in a dispute case in Dasuya on April 29, 1999, he said.

 Rajput had cancelled a deal to buy a truck from Dasuyas Vipin Gambhir, who wouldnt return the Rs 10,000 advance, Sharma said. Rajput, he said, came to him to file a case.

 The lawyer said the moment he saw Rajputs photograph on TV, he began searching for copies of the papers of the case, filed in the Dasuya sub-divisional judicial magistrates court.

 But Sharma fumbled when asked why he had chosen Chandigarh for the revelations and not Jalandhar; how he could have dug out seven-year-old court records in three days; and whether he was trying to help the prime accused.

 His press statement refers to his learning from TV that Rajput was a key witness in some Jessica Lal murder case. The obvious implication of the some is that Sharma had only his dead client on his mind and he either hadnt heard of Jessica or had forgotten about the case.

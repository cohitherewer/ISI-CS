 Fishy link to animals

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, April 7: In Canadas Arctic region, scientists have discovered the fossils of an ancient fish, a predator with sharp teeth and a crocodile-like head that they say is the elusive missing link between fish and limbed animals.

 The fish fossils, found on Ellesmere Island in Canadas Nunavut Territory, about 900 km from the North Pole, show that the evolution from life in water to life on land occurred gradually in fish living in shallow water, the researchers said.

 Scientists have known for nearly a century that lobe-finned fish evolved over millions of years into limbed animals called the tetrapods. But no one had a clear idea about what creatures existed on the evolutionary tree between finned fish and tetrapods.

 The find is a dream come true, said Ted Daeschler from the Academy of Natural Sciences in the US, a member of the team that discovered the fossils. The researchers have reported their finding in Thursdays issue of the British journal Nature.

 The scientists found the fossils in layers of rock, the deposits of streams that formed some 375 million years ago, an era when North America was part of a supercontinent close to the equator and experienced tropical weather.

 This kind of shallow stream system seems to be the place where many features of land-living animals first arose, Daeschler said. The fossil structures suggest that the ancient fish lived in shallow water and perhaps even out of water for short periods.

 The fossil fish named Tiktaalik had a skull, neck, ribs and part of a fin that have been found in the earliest limbed animals. But Tiktaalik also has fins and scales like a fish, the academy said in a press release.

 Tiktaalik blurs the boundary between fish and land animals, said Neil Shubin from the University of Chicago and another team member. The release quoted Shubin as saying: This animal is both a tetrapod and a fish. We jokingly call it a fishapod.

 The Tiktaalik skeleton indicates that it could support its body under gravity whether in very shallow water or on land, said Farish Jenkins a collaborator at Harvard University. This represents a critical phase of evolution of all limbed animals, including us.

 The academy said Tiktaalik had a flattened skull similar to the earliest tetrapods but the lower jaw and snout had features typically found in fish.

 Its wide body also resembles a tetrapod, but it had fish-like scales.

 ISI threat halts trial again 

 AMIT ROY

 London, Sept. 19: For the second day in succession, a trial at the Old Bailey in London of seven men accused of terrorism charges was halted because one of them refused to answer questions.

 It seems that Omar Khyam, 24, would much rather take his chances with the British legal system than with Pakistans ISI, which has allegedly threatened his family.

 The men are accused of planning a bombing campaign of Britain. 

 Khyam, who denies the charge, was due to answer questions on why the men had bought 600 kg of ammonium nitrate fertiliser. 

 It also seems there is not much the court can do to persuade Khyam to talk.

 The British security forces may take note of what Khyam is alleging in court but are unlikely to take any action while the trial is still continuing. Whether Khyam is a credible witness will be for the jury to decide but the British governments support for President Pervez Musharraf is unlikely to be undermined by reports of ISI double-dealing.

 The British, like the Americans, will assume that elements in the ISI remain opposed to Musharraf, who will need to be protected even more than before from traitors in his midst.

 During a five-minute hearing today, the judge, Sir Michael Astill, addressed Khyam, who stood between two prison officers, a man and a woman.

 The judge said: Mr Khyam, you are in the witness box giving evidence at the present time. Would you like to leave the dock and resume, please?

 Khyam replied: No.

 The judge asked: Is that your final decision?

 Khyam responded: Yes.

 The judge reminded Khyam of a legal warning given to him yesterday that the jury could draw inferences from his refusal.

 Khyams own counsel, Joel Bennathan, told the judge: I can simply confirm he has been advised of the possible consequences. I have done my humble best to explain the legal position.

 The judge then addressed the jury: Ladies and gentlemen, that is the end of Mr Khyams evidence. It will be a matter for you in due course.

 The trial was then adjourned until tomorrow to allow Khyams legal team to consult him about other aspects of his case.

 Khyam said in his evidence last week: The ISI was setting up training camps in what we called Free Kashmir, funding it with money and weapons, and people that would train people, and logistical supplies, everything. 

 He described how he went to a training camp in Pakistan in January 2000, staying in the country for three months. He learnt how to use an AK-47 rifle, rocket-propelled grenades and sniper rifles, studied climbing techniques and reconnaissance and underwent fitness training. At that stage, he said, he did not undergo explosives training, but learnt how to make bombs during a later visit to the country. 

 People were selected by the ISI, he said. The ISI works with Islamic groups. The group I was with, they wouldnt let us train with the local Pakistanis. There would be a separate camp for the foreigners.

 It was through the ISI working with Islamic groups that his grandfather, who had served in the military, was able to trace Khyam and bring him home to Crawley, West Sussex. 

 Khyam had already said there were questions he would refuse to answer because he did not want his evidence to lead to the arrest of people still working for the cause.

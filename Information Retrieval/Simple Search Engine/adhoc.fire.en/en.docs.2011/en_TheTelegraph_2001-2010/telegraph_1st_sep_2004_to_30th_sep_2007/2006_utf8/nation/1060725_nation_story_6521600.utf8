 Kurukshetra, July 24: Six-year-old Prince, rescued from a 60-foot-deep borewell last evening, was put under mild sedatives today after he began to cry uncontrollably in the afternoon.

 Prince had been admitted to the Lok Nayak Jaya Prakash Civil Hospital here last night soon after his 50-hour ordeal ended.

 He was feeling fine yesterday but began crying at the sight of anyone other than his parents in the afternoon, chief medical officer D.S. Saini said. Doctors have found no external or internal injuries.

 It was a miracle for him to survive at the base of the borewell for 50 hours. What is equally heartening is that he was not injured seriously in the 60-foot fall, Saini said.

 A nurse, however, said the boy had showed symptoms of pain in the stomach in the morning. 

 Perhaps the food and the medicines he is being administered dont suit him. But he is doing fine. He needs rest, she said.

 Princes refusal to talk to anyone other than his parents is natural, Saini said.

 Too much of attention in such cases can lead to adverse affects. The boy must be left alone for the next couple of days. Too much media attention is harming him.

 The media were barred from Princes room in the afternoon. Even the doctors who had been monitoring the boy in his hole and lowering food and glucose to him were kept away.

 Even with his parents at his side, Prince has been howling at the sight of strangers, with his mother struggling to control him.

 Psychologists had said yesterday that his ordeal may leave Prince with a lifelong fear of the dark and solitude. He may also have frequent nightmares ? and flashbacks while awake ? and unless treated properly might develop long-term psychological damage.

 Advice has been sought from child experts in Delhi on whether the boy needs a CT scan to detect possible brain damage. 

 We are monitoring his condition. We will take a decision on a CT scan tomorrow, a doctor said.

 The low levels of oxygen in the pit (though some was supplied down a shaft in the latter part of Princes ordeal) might have caused damage to his brain, doctors had warned yesterday.

 One of the doctors here suggested Prince wouldnt be so upset now had the first face to greet him in his hole last evening been that of his chacha (uncle) Jaswant Singh, who had gone down with other rescuers.

 Being young, he would also have been bewildered by the crowd as well as the sloganeering that started when he was lifted to the surface, he said.

 Kurukshetra deputy commissioner T.K. Sharma visited the hospital and handed a cheque for Rs 2 lakh to Princes family, as had been promised by Haryana chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda.

 NRI frauds now in Bengal marriage mart

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Chandigarh, June 21: There are about 100 young women in Bengal who married very eligible NRIs in the past few years and then realised that they were either married or simply not interested in them after returning from India.

 Duped wives are dime a dozen across Punjab, but Bengal, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat have now made it to the list.

 A member of the National Commission for Women, former MP Malini Bhattacharya, who was here for a workshop to discuss the problems of women deserted by NRI husbands, told The Telegraph that the number of such women was assuming alarming proportions in Bengal. 

 Its a new phenomenon. The grooms never come back after leaving their wives be- hind with promises of sending the necessary papers to enable them to join them. The cases of young girls being duped is growing at an alarming rate in the state.

 She put the number of such women at 100, but that is only the number of cases reported. Many go unreported for fear social stigma or sheer lack of knowledge about whom to approach for redress.

 At the workshop was 20-year-old Seema, who was married to a California resident two years ago but never saw him after that. 

 He came to Hoshiarpur earlier this year, but managed to leave the country after a police case was registered against him. The girls family didnt know what to do after that.

 Bhattacharya doesnt like the term holiday wives, used to describe the deserted women. Its demeaning, she said, but that is how the growing population of around 30,000 has come to be known as.

 The Centre had earlier mooted an agency to track trafficking of all kinds, including NRI marriages. 

 Commission chairperson Girija Vyas, too, stressed the need for a law to tackle problems related to NRI marriages and the necessity of an awareness campaign. 

 The NRI frauds cannot often be nailed in India for lack of treaties with countries like Britain, the US, Canada, Australia or New Zealand.

 The secretary of the Union ministry of overseas Indian affairs, Nirmal Singh, said centres would be set up in the US and some other countries to provide counselling for abandoned Indian wives.

 Bhattacharya attributed the growth of the problem in Bengal to the sudden boom of the middle-class. The middle-class has become upwardly mobile and is seeking greener pastures. This has made people vulnerable to the guiles of NRIs who are on the lookout for fun when they come for a holiday. 

 The majority of the grooms, she added, have been found to be already married.

 Among the suggestions made at the workshop to curb the problem were registration of the marriage at least six weeks before the social wedding, inclusion of details of the spouse in the passport of the groom and special cells in all high commissions and embassies to deal with such cases. 

 Some speakers also suggested withdrawal of the Indian citizenship of the groom and legal provisions for their extradition.

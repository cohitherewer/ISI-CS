 Athavale: Plot thickens

 Mumbai, July 1: Those who blackened a professors face at Wilson College yesterday had come from a different institution ? Bhavans College ? it emerged today as the police arrested 44 students for the assault.

 To add to the thickening plot, the girl student whom the 58-year-old Vilas Athavale is alleged to have harassed has seemingly taken admission in Bhavans, though her name continued to be on the Class XII rolls at Wilson College yesterday. Wilson remained closed today and is expected to reopen on Tuesday.

 Athavale was paraded down Marine Drive with a garland of slippers around his neck by the Congress-affiliated National Students Union of India activists for allegedly misbehaving with the girl a year ago.

 The police said the girls parents had told them she was a student of Bhavans now. Officers said they were trying to find out when she might have got admitted to Bhavans and how she could have done it if she didnt have a transfer certificate from Wilson.

 The parents have backed the charge of harassment and have said they hadnt reported the matter because they feared reprisals against their daughter from the college.

 The girls parents say they have admitted her to Bhavans College now. We are investigating whether the whole incident was pre-planned, or whether she really was a victim of year-long harassment, said police inspector S.A. Salve of Gamdevi police station, who is probing the case.

 Most Congress leaders in the state have distanced themselves from the incident while MP Gurudas Kamat criticised the students action. Most of the student unions leaders remained unreachable today.

 The police are investigating the case. The truth will be out soon and whoever is guilty will be punished, Kamat said. But whatever the provocation, there is no need to take law into ones hands. We want the law to take its own course.

 The BJP was cautious in its condemnation.

 It seems like a deliberate attempt to get political mileage. This is a one-year-old case. Why did they not do anything about it so long? state BJP spokesman Vinod Tawde said.

 The police will soon find out the truth and whoever is guilty will be punished. But we feel that under no circumstance should a professor have been assaulted.

 He should have been reported if there was a wrongdoing, but this kind of hooliganism by the NSUI is unacceptable.

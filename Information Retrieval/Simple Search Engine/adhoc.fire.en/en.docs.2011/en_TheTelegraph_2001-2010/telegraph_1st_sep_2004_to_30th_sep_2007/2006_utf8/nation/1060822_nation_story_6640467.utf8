 Vande Mataram not must: Arjun

 Arjun Singh: Barb at BJP

 New Delhi, Aug. 21: Human resource development minister Arjun Singh today said singing Vande Mataram is not mandatory and those who dont want to sing it are not unpatriotic or anti-national, but there is no need to make a song and dance about it.

 Arjun, who addressed a conference on terrorism organised by the Jamiat Ulema-i-Hind and the All-India Milli Council, responded to a query from Jamiat elder Ashad Madani whether the Centre intended to make Vande Mataram compulsory in all education institutions. 

 The minister replied: For all of us who fought for Independence, Vande Mataram has a special place in our hearts. Thousands of youths sacrificed their lives with the song on their lips. Some days ago, when the Prime Minister had an all-party meeting, it was decided we will celebrate some milestone events this year. There was the 1857 war for Independence, which was fought under Bahadur Shah Zafars leadership, the 60th year of Independence and Vande Matarams centenary.

 This is a song and we decided that the only way to celebrate the event was to sing it. But this does not mean everyone should sing, there is no compulsion. I will only say that by raising such questions, wittingly or unwittingly, you get trapped in divisive issues.

 To a question whether those who dont sing it would be branded anti-national, Arjun said: Those who are making such suggestions are also those who wanted to issue a white paper on madarsas. The country is not with them.

 The barb was directed at BJP leader L.K. Advani, who had promised to bring white papers on the state of madarsas and the ISI when he was home minister.

 But Arjun couldnt resist taking a swipe at Prime Minister Manmohan Singh either. 

 A participant asked for confirmation if the Research and Analysis Wing had set up an office in Lucknow to keep an eye on madarsas on the Uttar Pradesh-Nepal border. 

 I cannot get information on this because it is not in my jurisdiction and neither can I venture to ask anyone. However, a few days ago, a senior cleric met me and mentioned the same thing. In his presence, I called up the home minister (Shivraj Patil). He said RAW was not under him, he had no idea when the office was opened. But I think one should get to the bottom of this. Ask the PM directly, ask him this question on my behalf. Hes the best person to answer it, Arjun said.

 The Prime Minister was not present when Arjun said this and by the time he arrived, Arjun had sidled out saying he had an important cabinet meeting to attend.

 Before he went, he also urged the gathering to be alert and keep their eyes and ears open instead of depending on official sources for information.

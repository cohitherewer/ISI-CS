 BHU info rap

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 17: Banaras Hindu University denied admission to a student who annoyed it by filing an application against it under the Right to Information Act, a Central Information Commission probe has shown.

 The commission has asked the university to immediately admit Dhananjay Tripathi and warned it to never again victimise a student for seeking information.

 Tripathi, who graduated from BHU this year, had sought admission to the masters programme in physical education. 

 But he had also used the information act to seek the details of an inquiry report on the death of a fellow student under suspicious circumstances.

 The CIC inquiry report says Tripathi was penalised by the administration for embarrassing the university by seeking information under the RTI (act) which it didnt want to share. 

 The threats started almost immediately. I was told to withdraw my application or face the consequences, Tripathi said over phone from Varanasi.

 He initially shrugged the threats off but was shocked to find he had been denied admission to the course of his choice while students with lower marks had been admitted.

 The commission has asked BHU to admit Tripathi with immediate effect and to grant him a grace period up to the date of admission for the purpose of attendance.

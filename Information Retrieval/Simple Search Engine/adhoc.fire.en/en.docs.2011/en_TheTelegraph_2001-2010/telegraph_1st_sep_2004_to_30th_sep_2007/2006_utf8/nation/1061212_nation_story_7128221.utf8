 Lalus boys torment train

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Hyderabad, 

 Dec. 11: Eight hundred youths from Bihar and Jharkhand 

 took over the Howrah-bound Falaknuma Express for eight hours 

 yesterday, grabbing seats, harassing women, beating up catering 

 staff, robbing vendors and pulling the chain 22 times.

 The torment ended after a heavy police and Railway Protection Force contingent detained 500 of them at Tadepalligudem around midnight while the other 300 escaped into the town.

 Whenever we tried to stop them, the boys threatened us saying, Dont you know we are from the railway ministers state? a railway spokesman said.

 Only half of the group, returning home from a railway recruitment exam in Secunderabad, carried tickets. Some had the free coupon railway board examinees are entitled to, while the rest had neither.

 Pushpa Kumari, who was in the womens compartment, lodged a complaint at Guntur. The boys forced their way into our compartment. They sang lewd songs and danced in the corridor in an obscene way, she said.

 An aged couple from Salt Lake got off the train at Guntur after being threatened by the youths.

 At Tadepalligudem, the police registered cases against only 15. They were given tea and (apart from the 15 detainees) sent in another train to Howrah after a warning, a police officer said.

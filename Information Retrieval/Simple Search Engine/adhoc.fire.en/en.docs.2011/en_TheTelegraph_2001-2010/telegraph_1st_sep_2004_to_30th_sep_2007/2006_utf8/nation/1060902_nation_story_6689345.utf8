 Outgoing Indian consul-general Ajay Swarup handed over the equipment at a ceremony on Thursday. 

 We will now do everything in our power to ensure that the pass rate improves in our school. We are ever grateful to President Kalam and the Government of India for this wonderful gesture, said the schools principal, Felix Mshololo. 

 The relations between India and South Africa are very strong and we know that this will continue to promote the interests of our people, education minister Ina Cronje said.

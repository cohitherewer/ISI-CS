 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 14: From next year, children will get to see films produced by the Childrens Film Society, India (CFSI), for free.

 Information and broadcasting minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi announced this today at the inauguration of a five-day film festival to celebrate CFSIs golden jubilee.

 He also announced that the Centre would triple the money given to the CFSI in the next five-year plan.

 He called these two moves a gift from Sonia Gandhi, who was the chief guest at the inauguration. The UPA chairperson made a brief speech and posed for photographs with children dressed in white kurta-pyjamas and Gandhi caps.

 The event was meant to mark Childrens Day, the birth anniversary of Jawaharlal Nehru who prompted the formation of CFSI. The organisers screened a clip showing Nehru discussing childrens films with a bunch of kids, including the audience was told his grandchildren Sanjay and Rajiv Gandhi.

 Sonia said though children were usually reminded about their responsibilities, they should be made aware of their rights as well.

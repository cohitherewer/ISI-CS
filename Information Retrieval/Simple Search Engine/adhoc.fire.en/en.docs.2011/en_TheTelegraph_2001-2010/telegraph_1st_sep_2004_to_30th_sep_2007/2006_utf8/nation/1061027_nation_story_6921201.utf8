 Afzal march

 New 

 Delhi, Oct. 26: BJP leaders will march to Parliament 

 at the start of the winter session to protest against no 

 decision being taken on Mohammad Afzals mercy plea.

 We are starting the second 

 part of the campaign against the UPAs soft stand on 

 terrorism. Afzal is a symbol of the governments weak 

 policy on national security, the party said.

 Rao quits Parliament

 Hyderabad, Sept. 12: Telengana Rashtra Samiti president and former Union labour minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao has resigned from the Lok Sabha, reports our special correspondent. 

 Rao had announced at a rally in Siddipet last week that all five MPs from his party would give up their seats won in alliance with the Congress. The party last month pulled out of the Congress-led UPA government over differences on the Telengana statehood demand.

 Faxing his resignation letter to Speaker Somnath Chatterjee, Rao dared Congress legislators to do the same. Let all Congressmen who claim to have won without TRS support now enter the fray from Karimnagar and prove their mettle, he said.

 The TRS, which fought the 2004 Lok Sabha and Assembly polls in alliance with the Congress, won 26 Assembly and five Parliament seats.

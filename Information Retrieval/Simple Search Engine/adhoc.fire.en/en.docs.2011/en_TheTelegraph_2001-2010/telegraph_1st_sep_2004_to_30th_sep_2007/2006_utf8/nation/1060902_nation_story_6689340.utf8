 More textbook rows brew

New Delhi, Sept. 1: The recent row over textbooks in and outside Parliament has revealed not only the extent of confusion prevailing on the issue it has also set the stage for more review committees.

 Next in line are the controversial political science textbooks for Class XII that are yet to be written but are already making political parties uneasy about their contents.

 The textbooks are scheduled to come into circulation from the next academic year. But political parties have already started flexing muscles even when the fineprint is not ready.

 Academics say their response to books not yet written indicates another review committee may well be on the way. This time, textbooks on political science and history will be under scrutiny.

 Neither the Congress nor the BJP is comfortable with the new political science syllabus for Class XII. It makes a break from the past and includes the Emergency, Gujarat killings and the Babri Masjid demolition.

 The BJP has, in fact, already begun to protest the inclusion of the Gujarat killings. The Congress is keeping quiet but is likely to criticise the inclusion of Emergency clamped by the Indira Gandhi regime.

 The sudden protests over political science textbooks have taken the authors by surprise. We have not yet begun to write the book. The fact that Gujarat, Babri Masjid and Emergency will be part of the textbook was already known when the new syllabus was published. So what is the new controversy all about? asked an author.

 As though this were not enough, a fresh controversy has erupted over Hindi textbooks brought out by the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) for classes III, VII and IX.

 Senior BJP MPs like Sushma Swaraj, Murli Manohar Joshi and Ravi Shankar Prasad stalled proceedings in the Rajya Sabha over the textbooks. The ruckus forced the human resource development ministry to set up a committee to review them.

 It was not just the BJP but even the CPM that criticised Modern India, a textbook by Bipan Chandra. CPM MP Prashant Chatterjee and some BJP colleagues argued that the book had described Bipin Chandra Pal, Lajpat Rai and Aurobindo Ghosh as terrorists. 

 Sushma said the books were written by perverts. Joshi said the books were trying to promote smoking.

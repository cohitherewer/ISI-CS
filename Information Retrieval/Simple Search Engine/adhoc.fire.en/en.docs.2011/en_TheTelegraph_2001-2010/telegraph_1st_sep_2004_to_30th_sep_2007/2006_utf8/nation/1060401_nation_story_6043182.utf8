 Fake Pyne yanked off Christies auction

 The original Harbour

 This tempera by Ganesh Pyne, painted when he was a struggling artist living in penury, was expected to put him in the bracket of masters, who have in recent times been making waves in international sale rooms. 

 But Harbour, painted in 1971 and gifted by the artist to art historian Pranab Ranjan Ray, ultimately had to be removed, reportedly at Pynes intervention, from the Christies auction in New York on Thursday as the one put up for sale was a proven fake.

 This great fake story began last September when the owner of an Alipore gallery asked Ray to authenticate a Pyne which had a sticker behind it saying: Harbour by Ganesh Pyne, Pranab Ranjan Ray, Lalit Kala Akademi. Ray asked her to bring the work. But she came to Rays home the same evening without the work as the seller would not part with it.

 Ray took this gallery owner to his room where the original Harbour was hanging.

 In January 2006, the fake resurfaced when another gallery owner called up Ray because somebody who had bought Harbour was offering it to him. 

 The painting was brought to Ray, who after scrutinising it came to the conclusion that this fake was produced by painting over a display print brought out by the Lalit Kala Akademi when Ray was an Akademi committee member in the mid-seventies. It was the exact size of the original and had a line at the bottom saying: Courtesy Pranab Ranjan Ray. Apart from Pynes signature, there was nothing to tell it apart from the original.

 Says Ray: The buyer was astounded when he saw the original in my room. He even raised doubts about the genuineness of my painting. He called up the man who had sold it and later got back his money.

 About a month later, the painting was offered to a framer along with a letter signed by Ray to the effect that he (Ray) had sold it in 1979. This time, it was being offered at a much lower price.

 Ray had in the meantime told Pyne about the fake. The painting was seen once again in the Christies catalogue of its auction on March 30. Now Ray got in touch with Arun Vadera who represents the auction house in India.

 What transpired thereafter is not very clear. But Pyne is in America and the painting was withdrawn.

 However, Vadera said over the phone from New York that the work was withdrawn not because it was a fake but because its provenance had to be established. 

 It is normal for us to withdraw works, he said.

 Incidentally, seven other works were withdrawn from the Sothebys sale on March 29, and eight from the Christies sale.

 Rape charge on big fish

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Srinagar, June 24: The CBI today filed a chargesheet against nine accused in the sex scandal that has rocked Jammu and Kashmir, seeking punishment for rape or abetment of rape.

 This is the first chargesheet in the case, which was handed over to the CBI following a public outcry after senior local politicians, bureaucrats, police officers and businessmen were accused of abusing minor girls. 

 The 25-page chargesheet was filed in the court of the local chief judicial magistrate under Section 376 (rape) of the Ranbir Penal Code ? in force only in Jammu and Kashmir, where the Indian Penal Code does not apply ? and sections of the Prevention of Immoral Trafficking Act. 

 Anil Sethi, the former additional advocate-general of the state who surrendered early this week in Jammu, BSF deputy inspector-general K.S. Padhi, deputy superintendent of Jammu and Kashmir police Mohammad Ashraf Mir and surrendered militant Shabir Ahmad Langu were named in the chargesheet with Mehraj-ud-Din, Shabir Ahmad Kala, Maqsood Bhat and Hamid Bhalla. 

 The alleged mastermind, Sabina, was charged with abetting rape.

 The eight men have been accused by a 15-year-old victim of raping her. In her statement to the CBI, the girl had alleged that 11 men raped her while 20 others used to visit Sabinas house.

 Chief judicial magistrate M.Y. Akhoon fixed July 7 as the date for taking cognisance of the charges.

 Earlier this week, the CBI arrested two former state ministers ? Ghulam Ahmad Mir and Raman Mattoo. The agency is waiting for their interrogation to be over before filing a chargesheet against them. 

 However, if it fails to file the chargesheet before the expiry of 60 days from the date of its first arrest ? April 29 ? the duo can get bail.

 The CBI told the court today that the mobile phone and CD featuring a video clip of the victim has been sent to the forensic laboratory in Hyderabad. The discovery of a smut CD in March had blown the lid off the scandal. 

 With Sethis surrender, the CBI had indicated that it had completed its investigation.

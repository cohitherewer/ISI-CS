 Meerut, Aug. 14: Students today threatened to set parts of Chaudhary Charan Singh University on fire after a TV channel report showed children as young as 10 marking graduate and post-graduate answer scripts.

 They ransacked the house of registrar B. L. Arya, whose son is allegedly behind the racket. Police foiled an attempt to torch the house but a bus was set on fire in the central square of this restive town, a two-hour drive from Delhi. 

 Last night, a channel showed children in Agra, mostly school dropouts, marking answer scripts of graduate and post-graduate examinations of the university.

 The scam is believed to be run from a house rented by R.P. Singh, the son of Arya. Agra police have arrested Singh and five others and seized around 10,000 answer papers. A case has been registered against Arya, who is believed to have facilitated the transfer of scripts to his son. 

 Students, however, want some heads to roll. Along with Arya, the vice-chancellor, proctor and provisional vice-chancellor are also involved in the scam, said Kaisar Abbas, president of the universitys students union.

 Vice-chancellor Sant Prasad Ojha, proctor A. P. Garg and provisional vice-chancellor sit with Arya on the panel that decides where the papers go for evaluation.

 Students argue that answer scripts could not have reached the registrars son without the vice-chancellors permission and, therefore, want all four to resign and face prosecution. 

 If they do not resign and if cases are not registered against them, the campus will burn. Also, their faces will be blackened, Abbas threatened.

 It is too early to say whether cases will be lodged against the three (other than Arya) but investigations are on, ACP Rakesh Mishra said. Authorities merely said they were taking the matter seriously and meeting today and tomorrow to decide on the future course.

 The police say they are still coming to grips with the unusual nature of the scam. While some graduates were being paid Rs 12 per script, the rate for school dropouts was Rs 2, said ACP Ramsevak Singh, who has been co-ordinating with Agra police since this morning.

 The police are also investigating the possibility of similar rackets involving the universitys answer scripts elsewhere.

 The careers of seven lakh students are on the line. We hope the police investigates properly, said Sunil Rana, the general secretary of the students union.

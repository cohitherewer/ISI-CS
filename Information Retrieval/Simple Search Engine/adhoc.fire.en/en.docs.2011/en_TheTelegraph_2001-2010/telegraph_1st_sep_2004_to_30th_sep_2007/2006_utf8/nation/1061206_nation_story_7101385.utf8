 CBSE lessens students burden

 New Delhi (PTI): The CBSE has decided to give equal weightage to practicals in mathematics and science for students taking their Class X board exams in 2007. An internal evaluation system is being introduced in practical exams of both subjects, an official of the board said on Tuesday.

 The initiative is part of the boards efforts 

 to reduce the burden on students, he said. The written test 

 in maths will carry 80 marks and the one in science 60 marks 

 in board exams next year. quot;The break-up of marks in 

 theory and practical in mathematics and science will be 

 80:20 and 60:40. The marks in practicals are totally based 

 on internal assessment of schools, quot; he added

 Fewer women at workplace

 New Delhi (PTI): The proportion 

 of women in the countrys workforce has increased during 

 the last three decades, but it still stood at a poor 25.68 

 per cent in 2001. There are more women workers in rural 

 areas than in the urban centres.

 The proportion of women in the workforce in 1981 was 19.67 per cent and it rose to 22.73 per cent in 1991, further rising to 25.68 per cent in 2001, according to the statistics from the registrar-general of India.

 The work participation rate for women in rural areas was 30.98 per cent as compared to 11.55 per cent in the urban areas.

 In rural areas, women are mainly involved as cultivators and agricultural labourers, while in the urban areas, almost 80 per cent of the women workforce work in unorganised sectors like household industry, petty trades and services and construction. 

 UNI ruling

 New Delhi (PTI): The Company 

 Law Board has put a brake on the sale of a 50.05 per cent 

 stake in the UNI news agency to Subhash Chandras Essel 

 group on Tuesday. 

 The share sale violated articles of association of UNI, a non-profit sharing company set up in 1961, board chairman N. Balasubramanian said.

 Dalit rights

 Cuttack (PTI): Orissa High 

 Court has ruled that Dalits have the right to enter any 

 Hindu temple. The high court was hearing a PIL seeking protection 

 for Dalits for entry into the Jagannath temple at Keredagada 

 in Kendrapara. The ruling came in the wake of a severe caste 

 conflict brewing over the issue of entry of Dalits into 

 the 300-year-old shrine. 

 Rasam death

 Coimbatore (PTI): A two-year-old 

 boy has died after falling into a vat filled with boiling-hot 

 rasam at a wedding near here.

 species of vultures. Experts will suggest steps to raise 

 the number of vultures at a breeding centre in Pinjore.

 Govt backs Shariat courts

 New Delhi, Nov. 2: The 

 Centre has defended the establishment of Shariat courts 

 by Muslims, saying it was the fundamental right of every 

 religious denomination to manage its own affairs 

 in matters of faith.

 Responding to a PIL seeking dissolution of all Islamic and Shariat courts in the country, the Centre told the Supreme Court that the functioning of Dar-ul-Qaza was protected under the fundamental rights enshrined in Articles 25 and 26 of the Constitution.

 Rooms to relics: cases pile up in war of wills

 DEVADEEP PUROHIT AND SAMBIT SAHA

 B.K. Birla, R.S. Lodha 

 Calcutta, Dec. 21: Rented office space barely enough for a table, a few chairs and a seven-year-old desktop computer. They dont cost much, but they are now priceless trophies in the war of wills.

 As the Birlas wage a long legal battle against Rajendra Singh Lodha over the estate of Priyamvada Birla valued at more than Rs 2,500 crore the number of cases keep multiplying.

 It all started with Lodhas petition in July 2004 for legal authentication of Priyamvadas 1999 will. What has followed is a slew of cases over tables and chairs to priceless coins dating back to the Maurya and Shaka era that has often seen lawyers from both sides hopping across the countrys courts to do all they can.

 There may be hundreds of cases. I have lost count and I cannot readily recall all, said N. G. Khaitan of Khaitan amp; Co, solicitors for the Birlas.

 The most important cases, he says, are over the legal authentication of the wills in contention Priyamvadas last testament in 1999 and her mutual 1982 will with husband M.P. Birla. Others are criminal cases lodged against Lodha and his aides for dissolution of five trusts.

 The inheritance storm that barrelled out of Birla Parks imposing gates in Calcutta is now raging across the country from lower courts in Bengal and Orissa to the Supreme Court.

 These are part of the Birlas strategy to engage Lodha in a multi-pronged battle over the will of Priyamvada, said a Lodha loyalist. The Birlas have similar things to say about Lodha.

 Issues related to management, corporate governance and professional ethics are also bones of contention. The Birla family moved the Company Law Board (CLB) over alleged mismanagement in Birla Corporation, the MP Birla Group flagship. Lodha even had to secure an order from the board to preside over the firms annual meeting in the summer of 2004. 

 The CLBs Calcutta bench also had to intervene in the winter of 2004 when questions were raised over the transfer of Priyamvadas shares to Lodha.

 The battle also reached the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI), which received complaints against Lodha and his sons, Harsh and Aditya. The Lodha camp has alleged that this was the handiwork of Birla loyalists. 

 The Lodhas moved a writ petition before the high court challenging the way ICAI handled the complaint, but it was dismissed, said a Birla loyalist. 

 The battle of wills is as much, if not more, about egos as money. Evidence of this lies in defamation cases with claims of over Rs 100 crore.

 With a cobweb of cases, many are wondering when they will, if ever, be resolved. We want the matter resolved at the earliest, is the standard reply from Khaitan amp; Co and Fox amp; Mondal, which represents Lodha.

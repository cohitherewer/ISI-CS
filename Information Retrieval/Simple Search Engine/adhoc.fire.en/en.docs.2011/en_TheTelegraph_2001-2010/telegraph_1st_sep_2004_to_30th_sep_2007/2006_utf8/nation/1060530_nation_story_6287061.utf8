 Lalu war cry at 

Mulayam doorstep

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, May 29: They were the Mandal twins in the former Janata Dal, each riding the reservation wave in the early 90s to consolidate his position as chief minister of a cow-belt state.

 Yet tomorrow, railway minister Lalu Prasad will be on Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadavs turf, publicly calling for his head.

 The rally in Lucknow, where Lalu Prasad will be the star speaker, will be a reflection of the change in political realities in the 16 years between Mandal and its sequel ? the education quota storm now raging in the country.

 The rally is being organised by the Jan Morcha of former Prime Minister and Mandal messiah V.P. Singh. Sharing the stage will be several Left, Dalit, socialist and farmers leaders, looking to forge a broad front against the ruling Samajwadi Party ahead of next years Assembly polls.

 Lalu Prasads support to an alliance against Mulayam will serve many purposes. It will allow his Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) to try to gain a foothold in the crucial heartland state at a time when it has lost power in Bihar after a decade and a half.

 It will also be revenge for the Samajwadi decision to contest 40 seats in Bihar during the last election that ousted the government of Lalu Prasads wife Rabri Devi.

 Finally, it will win the railway minister brownie points from ruling alliance chief Sonia Gandhi, who has been openly critical of the Mulayam government. 

 Keeping Sonia happy may also stand VP in good stead at a time he is believed to be eyeing the Presidents post, which falls vacant next year.

 The bitterness between the Yadav stalwarts has persisted ever since Lalu Prasad allegedly prevented Mulayam from becoming Prime Minister after the 1996 general election threw up a hung House. As the two fought and the CPM decided Jyoti Basu wouldnt head the coalition government, H.D. Deve Gowda emerged the consensus candidate.

 The last meeting between the two Yadav leaders had taken place at the wedding of Lalu Prasads daughter Misa in 1999.

 The RJD chief recently accused Mulayam of being a BJP agent and alleged that the Uttar Pradesh chief minister had tried to divide the secular vote during the 2004 Lok Sabha elections.

 Sparks are expected to fly, therefore, at Lucknows Lakshman Mela ground tomorrow. Several Yadav leaders of the state, who have fallen out with Mulayam, have rallied round Lalu Prasad.

 Among the other important speakers would be senior CPI leaders led by party general secretary A.B. Bardhan, Lok Janshakti Party chief Ram Vilas Paswan, Indian Justice Party chief Udit Raj as well as VP and Raj Babbar, who recently quit the Samajwadi Party in a huff.

 At least a dozen parties are with us and will join the rally, Udit Raj told reporters.

 Our major breakthrough has been in bringing Lalu Prasad and Ram Vilas Paswan together on a common platform, VP said.

 After the rally, the former Prime Minister would launch a ghera dalo, dera dalo (demonstrate and stage a sit-in) movement. The Morcha is expected to hold a series of aggressive demonstrations in the districts to press a pro-Dalit and pro-poor agenda.

 However, the grouping isnt free from conflicts of interest. Udit Raj and Paswan are vying to provide an alternative to the caste politics of Mayavatis Bahujan Samaj Party. Raj Babbar, on the other hand, is believed to be soft towards Mayavati.

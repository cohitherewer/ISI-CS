 Profit bill timing on PMs table

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 26: Armed with a consensus on tabling a bill to redefine offices of profit, the government is trying to work out when to convene a Parliament session.

 During consultations with smaller parties on the second day of the initiative, the government has come across two suggestions: resume the budget session as early as possible or prorogue the current adjourned phase and convene the monsoon session earlier than scheduled.

 Parliamentary affairs minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, who completed the consultations with political parties this evening, is expected to present his report to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh tomorrow. 

 The Prime Minister would take a final decision on whether to hold an all-party meeting and when to convene the session. Some parties have suggested that the plan for an all-party meeting should be scrapped to save time.

 Das Munshi spoke over the phone to a number of leaders, including the Samajwadi Partys Amar Singh. 

 Das Munshi also met Janata Dal (United) leader Sharad Yadav, who said a redress mechanism should also be put in place. The Election Commission or the judiciary should not sit in judgement over legislators on this issue. There are several committees within Parliament that can be strengthened for the purpose, Sharad told The Telegraph.

 In all likelihood, Parliament will convene around May 10, when the session was supposed to resume before the government decided to adjourn both Houses.

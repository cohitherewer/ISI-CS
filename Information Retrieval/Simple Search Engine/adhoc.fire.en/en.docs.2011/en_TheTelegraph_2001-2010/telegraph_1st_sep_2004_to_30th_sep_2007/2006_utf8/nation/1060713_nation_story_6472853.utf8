 Prime-target tracks

 Mumbai, July 12: Mumbais Western line, which was targeted in the blasts yesterday, has the highest passenger density on any railway network in the world with 14 to 16 people crammed into every square metre.

 Over 62 lakh commuters use the line daily, most of them office-goers travelling from the far-flung suburbs to the heart of the citys business districts.

 During rush hour, over 5,000 people take a 10-12 coach train meant for around 1,500.

 With many information technology, animation and BPO companies setting up offices between Andheri and Malad on the Western line, the attackers might have been looking at targeting the upcoming commercial hubs.

 Significantly, the bombs were planted in first class compartments.

 If maximum impact was the intent, the target should have been second class compartments which are doubly crammed. But it seems they chose the first class because it would have been easier to plant the devices in them, said a Mumbai crime branch official. 

 Besides, generally the first class travellers are stockbrokers, small businessmen and people in the diamond trade, mostly from the affluent Gujarati community. An attack on a first-class compartment would, therefore, make a bigger statement than on a second class coach, he added. 

 The businessmen would have been easy targets as they usually take the train from Charni Road to the western suburbs around that time. Seventeen diamond merchants have been identified among the dead.

 The intent, it seems, was to spark communal riots, the official said.

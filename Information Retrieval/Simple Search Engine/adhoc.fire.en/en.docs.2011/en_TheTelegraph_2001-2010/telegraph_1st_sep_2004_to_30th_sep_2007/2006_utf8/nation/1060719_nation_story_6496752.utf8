 Assam cops claim prize catch

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Guwahati, July 18: Guwahati police claimed another prize catch in the form of a top gun of the Muslim United Liberation Tigers of Assam (Multa) ? one nicknamed Lambu and with a suitably tall list of subversive activities against his name ? within 72 hours of apprehending five tourists who may have been working for terrorists.

 The police said the six-foot-plus Nur Islam was a Multa commander who had escaped detection by masquerading as a rickshaw-puller and staying in a slum at Fatasil Ambari for several years. 

 After tailing him for sometime, a police team raided his rented shack late last night and took him into custody. 

 Although no arms and ammunition were found on him, the police said: He is believed to have strong links with fundamentalist elements in Bangladesh and also with some leaders of al Qaida in Pakistan.

 Islam, who hails from Dhubri district, joined Multa in 1998. He was a camp commander at one of the outfits hideouts in Bangladesh. 

 His brief in Guwahati was ostensibly to lure economically underprivileged Muslim youths to Multa and take them to Bangladesh for training.

 Students fume at poll fund ban

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Stuck on politics 

 New Delhi, Sept. 24: It may be back to the days of room-to-room fund-raising for student politicians after the Supreme Court endorsed recommendations banning political parties from funding student polls.

 The students arent taking it lightly. This is absurd. We are the future politicians of the country. What is wrong if present-day politicians finance our elections? asked Mohan Pratap Singh of the Congress-backed National Students Union of India (NSUI).

 While the apex court has also accepted a slew of other recommendations to make student elections cleaner, its the move to wean them away from their parent bodies that has hit the student politicians the hardest.

 We receive funding from the BJP all the time, said an office-bearer of the BJP-affiliated Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishads Bengal unit. In Bengal, since we dont even have a support base, party funding is essential for our electoral growth.

 NSUI leaders in Bengal, too, confirmed their dependence on party support. Many student leaders argued the recommendations were not based on reality.

 The truth is, we won this year in Delhi University because of the Ujjain incident. The ABVP spent as much as we did. It is not money but issues that make the difference, said Anshul Kumar, an NSUI general secretary.

 The CPM-backed Students Federation of India supports the ban, though. Its absolutely essential that money power be removed from student politics, its official statement released in Delhi said.

 The SFI, its leaders in Bengal said, does not rely on money coming from the parent party.

 Whatever their student wings might think about the ban, officially the political parties are all in favour.

 Manish Tewari, former NSUI president and now All India Congress Committee secretary, claimed his former union had already begun implementing some of the Lyngdoh committees proposals. It kept the average age of contestants at 27, had an expenditure ceiling and insisted on 75 per cent attendance.

 If students want to identify with a political grouping or if a political grouping wants to back a panel of students, how can you stop that? he said, adding his party didnt directly fund campus candidates.

 The BJP and CPM likewise welcomed the decision to regulate the process of student elections.

 Students can be guided by a particular ideology; but there should be no interference by political parties in student elections, said CPM member of Parliament Md Salim.

 Many within the ABVP and NSUI, though, said the recommendations wont make a real difference.

 Even now, there is a bar on how much a candidate can spend in a Delhi University poll. But there is no mechanism to monitor the spending. Until such a mechanism is developed, funding from all sources will continue, an ABVP leader said.

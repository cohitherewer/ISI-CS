 Couples take hostility to heart, says study

 New Delhi, March 6: Hostility at home can not only wreck the hearth, but the heart as well.

 Coronary artery disease is more likely in women when there is hostility in a marital dispute, and more common in men when there is domination by either spouse, according to a new study by US psychologists that was released on Friday.

 It has found that a low-quality marital relationship is a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. 

 Researchers watched 150 healthy and elderly couples talk to each other in an experimental situation on topics ? money, in-laws, children or household duties ? that were subjects of disagreements in their marriage.

 Psychology graduate students analysed the videotaped conversations. Some discussions were calm and peaceful, while others were hostile enough for the students to suggest counselling. Two days after the talks, each couple had a CT scan to examine the health of their arteries.

 Women who are hostile are more likely to have blocked arteries and the risk increases when the animosity is mutual, Tim Smith, a professor of psychology at the University of Utah, said in the study presented at a meeting of the American Psychosomatic Society on Friday.

 But this is a risk factor for blocked arteries in men. For them, a dominating spouse ? it could be the husbands as well ? can be dangerous.

 Disagreements are unavoidable, Smith said. But heart health may depend on how disagreements are actually discussed at home. 

 If you were concerned about mens heart health, couples could find ways to talk about disagreements without trying to control each other. If you were concerned about womens heart health, you would encourage couples to have disagreements that werent hostile, he said.

 The new findings are consistent with previous research that has hinted at a link between emotions, relationships and health. Earlier studies have shown that close relationships are good for the health of the heart.

 Whats novel about this study is taking a snapshot of how couples talk to each other and relating that to a silent, progressive, potentially deadly disease, Smith said. 

 Although the most important strategy to protect the heart would be to stop smoking, eat well and exercise regularly, somewhere on the list would also be: pay attention to your relationships, he added.

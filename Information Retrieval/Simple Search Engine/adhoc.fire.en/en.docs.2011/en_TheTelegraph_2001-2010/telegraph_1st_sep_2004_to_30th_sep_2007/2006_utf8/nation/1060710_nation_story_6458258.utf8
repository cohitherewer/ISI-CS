 Jail term for faulty TV

 New Delhi, July 9 (PTI): A consumer court has asked a television seller to repair a set he sold 13 years ago or refund its price or be prepared to undergo a three-month jail term besides paying a penalty of Rs 5,000. 

 The National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission held Kishore D. Patel guilty of deficiency in services as he had failed to repair the set despite repeated requests by the buyer, Bhausaheb Devram Patil. 

 Upholding the district forums verdict, the court set aside the Maharashtra State Consumer Commission order that had absolved Patel of charges of selling a faulty TV set. 

 The order passed by the state consumer commission allowing the revision petition (of the seller), filed against the order of the district forum, by holding that there exists no relation of consumer and vendor between the parties, is, on the face of it, without jurisdiction, said the apex consumer court bench of Justices M.B. Shah and S.N. Kapoor.

 Patil had complained that he bought a TV set from Patel in 1993, which turned out to be defective.

 As his requests for repairing the set were turned down, Patil approached the district forum for redressal. The forum, in an ex-parte decision as Patel did not appear before it, directed him either to repair the TV set or refund its price.

 Patel neither filed any appeal nor complied with the order. The forum then awarded three months imprisonment and imposed a Rs 5,000 fine.

 But the state commission reversed the forums verdict.

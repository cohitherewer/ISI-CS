 Snoop fear over nuke bill clause 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 23: Fresh text inserted by the US Senate in the bill on the civilian nuclear deal may give America a chance to snoop on Indias nuclear weapons activities, scientists who have been advocating caution over the deal claimed today.

 While debating and approving the bill on November 16, the US Senate had introduced a Section 115 that seeks a cooperative threat reduction programme under which US and Indian scientists would pursue joint research related to nuclear non-proliferation, they said.

 This joint programme is to be established through the US National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), an agency that has listed the promotion of nuclear safety and non-proliferation as one of its missions.

 Indias department of atomic energy did not ask for this research and development. It has come as a total surprise to them, said Adinarayana Gopalakrishnan, former head of the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board.

 The NNSA is programmatically and financially linked to intelligence agencies in the US. It gathers information on weapons programmes of other countries, Gopalakrishnan claimed.

 Another senior nuclear scientist said he was surprised at the absence of any reaction from the Indian government to the introduction of this text into the bill. 

 A committee of the US Congress will decide now whether to include this provision in the final piece of legislation.

 As soon as the bill was passed by the Senate, the government should have relayed its concerns about this, said Padmanabha Iyengar, former chairman of the department of atomic energy.

 This is no time to rejoice, Iyengar said.

 Sources told The Telegraph that the Indian government had no prior knowledge about the insertion of the new text in the bill.

 Gopalakrishnan and Iyengar are among eight scientists all of whom had occupied top positions in Indias nuclear programme in the past who had earlier this year urged the government not to compromise Indias right to exercise the nuclear option or allow any infringement on research in the nuclear field.

 They had also asked the government to ensure that the nations nuclear research facilities are kept out of external controls.

 According to information on the NNSA website, its non-proliferation division secures nuclear materials and nuclear weapons at potentially vulnerable sites in Russia and elsewhere, strengthens international non-proliferation and export control, bolsters border security overseas, and mitigates risks at nuclear facilities worldwide.

 The Indian scientists said they are concerned that the cooperative programme involving the NNSA would be portrayed as a route for India to gain access to expertise and technology to address non-proliferation concerns.

 But it may allow the NNSA to gain access to some of our unsafeguarded nuclear research facilites, Iyengar said. This would give it an opportunity to snoop around.

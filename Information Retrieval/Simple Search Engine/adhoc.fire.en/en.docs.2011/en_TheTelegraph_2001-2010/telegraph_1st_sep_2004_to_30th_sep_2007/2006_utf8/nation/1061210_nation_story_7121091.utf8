 Guns on campus

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, Dec. 9: The classrooms are empty, but the lawns echo with the thud of heavy boots not of students but of armed men.

 Some of them are police who, at intervals, march across the campus, their eyes alert for any sign of trouble. The others are bodyguards of student leaders.

 Its clear that a war is on and Lucknow University is the theatre of this showdown between the state and the Centre.

 A day after vice-chancellor R.P. Singh declared that the university would remain indefinitely shut following recurring violence on campus, the institute looked abandoned. At times, though, the anger burst out. 

 Hey you, roared some students from one of the hostels as a security guard tried to close the main gate of the university this morning.

 Although the campus was shut down over enforcing the Lyngdoh Committees recommendations for union elections, students say they have been caught in the crossfire between the Samajwadi Party, which rules Uttar Pradesh, and the Congress, which heads the coalition at the Centre. This, unfortunately, is an extension of the ongoing Centre-state feud, said Bhuban Pratap Singh, an Independent student leader.

 The authorities decided not to hold elections this year after student leaders affiliated to the Samajwadi Party refused to accept the code of conduct drawn up on the basis of the Lyngdoh report. The code bars students with a criminal record from contesting polls.

 Leaders of the Samajwadi Chhatra Sabha like Pawan Pandey and Ram Singh Rana, who called the vice-chancellor a stooge of the governor today trotted around the campus with their armed bodyguards. 

 The vice-chancellor is worried over the charges the student leaders face. They include attempt to murder, rioting, illegal possession of firearms and violations of the Uttar Pradesh Gangsters amp; Anti Social Elements Prevention Act.

 There are also allegations that some student groups extorted money from businessmen and doctors at gunpoint.

 This is not the first time that the university has seen violence. In 2004, two students were shot on the eve of campus elections.

 State police chief Bua Singh, however, said the vice-chancellors concern should be academic and he had no right to talk about law and order.

 Samajwadi Party minister Naresh Agarwal also turned up the heat on the VC by demanding his removal in a letter to the governor.

 But amid the stand-off, the 12 hostels on the campus still looked crowded with students refusing to leave despite the vice-chancellors order to vacate them in 24 hours. Only the girls hostel has been vacated.

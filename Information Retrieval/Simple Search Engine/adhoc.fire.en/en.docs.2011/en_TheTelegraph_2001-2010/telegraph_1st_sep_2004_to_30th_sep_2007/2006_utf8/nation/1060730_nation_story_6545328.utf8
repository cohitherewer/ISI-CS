 Girls ponder Sahara suit

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Bina Chowdhury after getting bail on Friday

 New Delhi, July 29: We wanted to fly on international flights but our future is gone now. When Air Saharas logo says emotionally yours, how can they dismiss us? Bina Chowdhury said today from her hometown Jaipur.

 I cant believe they have chucked us out when we were not at fault.

 Under media glare after the alleged security breach at the Prime Ministers residence on Thursday night, both Bina and Yogita Khatwani, the grounded airhostesses of Air Sahara, have gone back to their parents home in Jaipur.

 But the story, which began with a prank, could soon lead to a legal battle.

 I consider the news of their dismissal a rumour. But if it is confirmed, we will file a suit against Air Sahara under the labour law. Sahara simply cannot dismiss them on some flimsy ground in which the guilt has not been proved, said S.K. Mahale, Bina and Yogitas defence counsel, adding that Manmohan Singhs office has already given them a clean chit and police would eventually have to acquit his clients without filing even a chargesheet.

 Both Yogita and Bina, who got bail against a personal bond of Rs 25,000 each yesterday, would come back to Delhi in a couple of days to know where they stand with the airline, Mahale said.

 Air Sahara, however, maintained its stand. A spokesperson said the two were already under suspension for absenteeism and were dismissed because of the indiscipline they showed by deviating from normal behaviour.

 Anand Mohan, DCP (New Delhi), said the case is under scrutiny as it involved breach of security of a sensitive place.

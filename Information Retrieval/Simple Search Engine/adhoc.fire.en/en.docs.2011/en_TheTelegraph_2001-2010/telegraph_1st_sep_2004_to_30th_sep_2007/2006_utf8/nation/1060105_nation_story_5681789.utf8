 Hiccups in free study plan

 Planning hurdle

 New Delhi, Jan. 4: Differences between the human resource development ministry and the Planning Commission have raised hurdles before a proposed law to provide free and compulsory education to all children between 6 and 14.

 The commission today objected to policy aspects of the right to education bill as well as the financial estimates provided by the ministry.

 HRD officials remained tightlipped after a meeting between their minister, Arjun Singh, finance minister P. Chidambaram, Planning Commission deputy chairperson Montek Singh Ahluwalia and C. Rangarajan, economic adviser to the Prime Minister. The meeting exclusively discussed the bill, which could not be tabled during the winter session because of too many doubts over its feasibility.

 A note circulated by the Planning Commission at todays meeting made it clear that many questions needed to be answered before the bill could see the light of day.

 Due to unrealistic assumptions, the financial projection appears to be on the higher side by 25-30 per cent, the note said. The bill estimates an expenditure of between Rs 52 crore and Rs 72 crore a year.

 The commissions note said: The financial requirements have been based on certain assumptions and some of them are highly questionable, particularly the assumption that the child population in the 6-11 age group would grow between 2001 and 2011 at the same rate as it had grown during 1991 and 2001.

 The child population, the note stressed, has been declining. As for the money needed to pay the teachers, the commission argued that the figures are jacked up because of a flawed perception of the growth of the child population and their enrolment.

 The commission also criticised a basic premise of the bill, saying: The assumption that the non-formal system of education should also be brought within the formal school system seems to be somewhat irrational.

 The note underlined the success of the non-formal, elementary system of education and said, The success of Sarva Siksha Abhiyan is largely due to non-formal interventions. The present bill does not provide for a non-formal education system.

 The differences between the ministry and the commission touch other core areas in the bill, too. For instance, a sub-committee of the Central Advisory Board of Education had suggested that the Centre bear most of the cost as the states are cash-strapped.

 The commission disagreed. It argued that the bulk of the expenditure on elementary education ? approximately Rs 40,000 crore ? is now borne by the states.

 The rationale for this (the Cabe suggestion) is not clear since the Centre should step in only when the states are unable to provide the resources, the note said.

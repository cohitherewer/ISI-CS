The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Talk of money rings loud 

 SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE

 Bongaon, April 6: Rejjak Mondal seemed a broken man.

 How could his son, who taught Arabic and Urdu in a Delhi private school, be a terrorist?

 Mehboob Ali Mondals arrest in Uttar Pradesh yesterday in connection with the Varanasi blasts has come as a shock to his family back home in Bongaon, 80 km from Calcutta. His 75-year-old fathers reaction mirrored the mood.

 I cannot believe this. It is true that my fourth son told us he would like to earn a lot of money, but he can never associate himself with anti-national work, said Rejjak, an affluent farmer.

 Some of those who grew up with the 34-year-old alleged terrorist remembered him as intelligent boy.

 Mehboob studied in a local madarsa and was very intelligent. Then he went to Hooghly where he studied Arabic and Urdu. He often used to say he would earn enough money to lead a lavish lifestyle, recalled Dilawar Mondal, a former classmate who owns a garment shop near Patangi, Mehboobs native village in North 24-Parganas. 

 Rejjak said his son left home in 1996. He used to come home, stay for a few days and leave. About three years ago, he told us he needed money for a trip to Bangladesh for his studies and a good job there. We mortgaged a part of our land and handed him nearly Rs 15,000.

 About two years ago, Rejjak said, Mehboob told the family he had got a job in New Delhi. He used to send money regularly, the old man added.

 Then he clammed up, as shock gave 

 way to fear ? of police harassment.

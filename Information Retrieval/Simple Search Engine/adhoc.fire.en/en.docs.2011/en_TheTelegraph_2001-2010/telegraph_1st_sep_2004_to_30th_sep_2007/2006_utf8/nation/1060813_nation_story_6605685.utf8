 Rajnath lights hot-pursuit fire

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Rajnath Singh

 New Delhi, Aug. 12: BJP president Rajnath Singh today sought to reverse his partys carefully studied position vis--vis Pakistan and demanded that India follow a policy of hot pursuit to dismantle terror infrastructure in Pakistan and Bangladesh.

 I demand that after taking the international community into confidence, India should attack Pakistan to dismantle terrorist centres, Rajnath was quoted as saying in Panaji.

 Not only Pakistan but Bangladesh should also be attacked where terrorist centres are operating, the BJP president asserted while demanding that all confidence-building measures with Pakistan be restricted. India should seek the international communitys help to declare Pakistan as a terrorist state.

 While Rajnath was personally not available to confirm that he made such a statement, the president of the BJPs Goa unit, Rajendra Arlekar, told The Telegraph that the party chief did raise such a demand in Goa today.

 Rajnathji said that terrorist camps inside Pakistan and Bangladesh should be attacked, Arlekar said.

 At the BJP headquarters here, no one was quite certain whether it indicates a shift in the partys policy or Rajnath was just taking a posture in public to please the RSS.

 The head of the BJPs foreign affairs cell, S.K. Arora, declined to comment. Has there been a statement like that? he asked. I have not seen the party presidents interview. I would not be able to comment on that.

 But Arora clarified that the BJP had not yet changed its position towards Pakistan. There has been no discussion to this effect. The BJP does not advocate hot pursuit. Jaswant Singhji had clarified that some time back, said Arora.

 Jaswant had cleared the air only a month ago. On July 13, BJP spokesperson Prakash Javdekar said a policy of hot pursuit is needed to weed out Pakistan-based terror groups.

 However, in an interview to The Telegraph the next day, the former foreign minister had debunked this theory. I dont wish to comment on what was said. But on the limited subject of hot pursuit, it is not an option, Jaswant had said.

 The BJP had made terrorism a key campaign issue, and both L.K. Advani and Rajnath had taken out Bharat Suraksha Yatras in the country in April. However, the campaign was focused more on exposing the UPAs alleged inability to deal with terror rather than attacking Pakistan.

 Senior leaders have repeatedly emphasised that the need of the hour is to link the peace process with Pakistan with the terror attacks in India. 

 But none has uttered the word hot pursuit of late.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Married to the web and caste

 M.R. VENKATESH

 Chennai, Aug. 11: Vijaya Kabara is a happy man. He has just found the woman of his dreams.

 But thats not the only reason why he cant stop smiling. He cant get over how he met her.

 I never dreamt I would find my life partner in such a way, Kabara, who is from Ahmedabad, said as he posted his matchmaking success story on the website bharatmatrimony.com, specifically thanking one of its region-specific portals, marwadimatrimony.com.

 But did the search for the right woman carry with it an age-old Indian tag?

 Statistics available with bharatmatrimony.com, Indias largest online matrimonial website that claims to have over 75 lakh members, show that the power of the Internet is yet to break caste barriers, though there is evidence to suggest that people are getting less and less caste-minded.

 Geographical boundaries have been broken, but 70 per cent to 80 per cent of those registered with our website want to marry within the same caste, said J. Murugavel, the young CEO of the Chennai-based BharatMatrimony Enterprise.

 This does not mean that people are as caste-oriented as they were. Caste is seen more as a comfort factor, not a fetish, a safe network of relatives and friends to bet upon, he said. 

 This itself, he feels, is a positive first step towards diluting caste rigidities.

 Of course, the trend, Murugavel hastened to add, was more reflective of urban India as 70 per cent of the registered members are from growing cities like Bangalore and Hyderabad, 10 per cent from non-metro areas like Coimbatore while the rest are non-resident Indians.

 But there is a reason behind this predominantly urban customer base only 3 to 4 per cent Indians have access to the Internet, Murugavel explained.

 That might soon change. Recently, Yahoo and Canaan Venture Capital of the US together committed to invest $8.65 million (a little over Rs 40 crore) into the BharatMatrimony Group, which has created a world record of sorts by facilitating over 7,00,000 marriages among Indians across the globe. 

 It will help keep us ahead of other websites in this field, said the man who started the portal when he was in the US in 1997.

 We are the only matrimonial website in the country which can be accessed in six Indian languages Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Hindi, Marathi and Gujarati, he added. 

 Murugavel pointed out that when a boy and girl meet on the Net, with so much personal details about each other before them, the choices are more even within a particular caste group or community. So marriage within the same caste naturally becomes the first preference even as people are willing to give up on sub-castes.

 For instance, Murugavel explained, there are several sub-castes among the backward Vanniyars in Tamil Nadu. But if other things click, the sub-caste is waived as long as the boy and girl fall within the Vanniyar group. Marriage aspirants want good life partners more than anything else, he emphasised.

 Another interesting sociological trend that has emerged from online matchmaking in recent years is that the earlier age gap between men and women has come down sharply.

 According to available figures, the usual age of marriage in Tamil Nadu in the early nineties was 26.4 years for men and 20.5 for women.

 Now, men begin to look for partners even before they reach 25, thanks to the service sector boom. As for girls, the educated ones, Murugavel said, keep postponing their marriage. So eventually, men and women are getting married closer to their respective ages.

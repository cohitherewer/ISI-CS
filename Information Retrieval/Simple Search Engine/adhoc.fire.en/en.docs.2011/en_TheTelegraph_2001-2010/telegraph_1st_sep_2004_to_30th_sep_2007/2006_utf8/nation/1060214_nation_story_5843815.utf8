 Expelled MPs in 

new hands

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 13: The Supreme Court today ordered that petitions before Delhi High Court challenging the expulsion of 10 of 11 MPs in the cash-for-questions scandal be transferred to it.

 Ten MPs had challenged their expulsion before the high court and one had moved the Supreme Court.

 While ordering transfer of the petitions, the court refused to entertain a plea by the MPs to restrain the Election Commission from notifying elections to fill vacancies caused by their expulsion.

 The court noted that all applications for interim relief, including stay on elections and continuance of other facilities available to MPs, would be taken up on the first day of hearing to be fixed in the week starting February 27.

 Such applications would be considered only after receiving records from the high court, the court said.

 Senior counsel P.N. Lekhi said once the elections were notified, the court could not interfere with the poll process. 

 The poll panel has to conduct elections within six months of a vacancy.

 As the elections to the vacant seats were to be held by June, there was little possibility of the Election Commission issuing a notification before the hearing, the court noted.

 The bench, however, asked the Election Commission to inform the court if it intended to issue a notification before the hearing.

 No begging, disabled now sue for rights

 - From 

 govt to court 

 Cap-in-hand pleading is out

 Bangalore, Sept. 6 (Reuters): When disabled worshippers in Tamil Nadu were blocked from entering temples with their wheelchairs and crutches, Meenakshi Balasubramanian knew she had the law on her side.

 The disabled rights activist, who herself has polio, sued the temple authorities in the states high court, and won.

 Today, she said that temples must provide wheelchairs to disabled visitors if they ban them from bringing in their own medical equipment as the devices are ritually impure.

 I do feel its our right, a religious right, a fundamental right, Balasubramanian said. We need to be allowed to worship the way we want to.

 Tired of waiting for the government to safeguard their rights to pray, work, learn and travel, Indias 22 million disabled people are increasingly turning to the courts.

 So far, the strategy has yielded some surprising victories.

 In New Delhi, a disability activist forced Indian Airlines to provide wheelchair lifts at airports in a case that went to the Supreme Court.

 And legal action in New Delhi and Mumbai has removed barriers for wheelchair users and the blind at election polling booths across the country.

 The activism has called attention to the weak implementation of the 1995 disability act, which requires government job slots, accessibility of public places and free education.

 Many of the landmark laws provisions are not implemented. Activists blame a culture of passivity among disability organisations that survive on government handouts and charity.

 They are now demanding their rights, said Rajul Padmanabhan, the director of Vidya Sagar, a group based in Chennai.Cap-in-hand begging is now out.

 While rights groups have made some progress, the laws failings are easy to spot.

 Vasim Khan, a polio victim who lives in Bangalore, rides to school on a wooden plank with wheels that he propels by scraping his palms against the ground. 

 Once there, he crawls up 24 steps to reach his classroom.

 Vasim, the 10-year-old son of an impoverished tomato seller, has received few of the benefits of the landmark disability act.

 While he does get a free education, he has no wheelchair to get him to school or a wheelchair ramp to access the building and his teachers are not trained to teach the disabled.

 A quiet child who has difficulty reading and writing, Vasim experiences daily pain. 

 It makes my wrists hurt, he said, holding out hands swollen from the strain of pushing his wooden board to get around.

 If the disability rights movement has a founder, it may be Javed Abidi, a former journalist who now directs the National Centre for Promotion of Employment for Disabled People in New Delhi.

 Abidis late-1990s case against Indian Airlines marked a turning point for the disabled movement, touching off dozens of lawsuits across the country.

 Kochi, Oct. 29: If it was ayurveda that launched Kerala on the world tourism circuit in the 1990s, leisure boating may be the new mantra for growth in this maritime state, which has a 560-km coastline dotted with lakes and lagoons.

 The state government has been promoting the annual India International Boat Show with this in mind. It has also planned a top-class marina, estimated initially at Rs 100 crore in the port city of Kochi, fast shaping up into the third boating hub in Asia after Dubai and Singapore.

 The marina is to come up near the Kerala Tourism Development Corporations deluxe Bolghaty Palace, an island resort off Kochi. It has been conceived as a joint venture between the state government and a Malaysian firm.

 The government has also proposed Kerala as a point in the famed international Volvo Boat Rally in 2008. At the valedictory session of this years India boat show, Vice-Admiral J.S. Bedi, flag officer commanding-in-chief of the Southern Naval Command, said the leisure and water sports boating market in India was expected to grow 10 per cent to 15 per cent in the near future.

 George A. Pottamkulam, proprietor of Indmerc, regretted he had not tugged along more leisure boats to the boat show because he could have walked home with an outright sale of 10 boats, each priced at Rs 15 lakh. Virtually everyone who went past the pavilion eyed their beauty and most of them wanted to own a boat. There are enough high spenders here who can afford to buy one for a backwater cruise. The sale and queries are an indication, he added.

 For those who thought the boats were beyond them, there were smaller models, with prices as low as Rs 35,000, before tax.

 A wide range of products from LPG kits to steel snake boats and houseboats with composite material for eco-friendly cruises were also showcased.

 Sailors who arrived in the city as part of the Vasco da Gama Rally a fortuitous development for the boat show felt intertwining lakes and canals offered ample scope for turning Kerala into a key leisure-boating destination.

 Tomy J. Pulickattil, managing director of Pulickattil House Boats, says owning a houseboat has become a symbol of wealth and prominence in Allappuzha. 

 Besides, the new-found enthusiasm for houseboat cruises has saved the boat-making industry. More than 85 per cent of the tourists visiting the state are interested in cruises. Boat owners can make considerable revenue by renting them out to tourist resorts, Pulickattil said.

 Johnson Philip, senior marketing manager of Aiswarya Marine, said: There are multiple owners for houseboats. People living in apartments near lakes buy houseboats jointly.

 NRIs find houseboats a viable option, leasing out boats for amounts ranging from Rs 7,000 to Rs 20,000. A luxury houseboat will cost between Rs 50 lakh and Rs 70 lakh. Houseboats with more modest facilities come for Rs 25 lakh to Rs 35 lakh.

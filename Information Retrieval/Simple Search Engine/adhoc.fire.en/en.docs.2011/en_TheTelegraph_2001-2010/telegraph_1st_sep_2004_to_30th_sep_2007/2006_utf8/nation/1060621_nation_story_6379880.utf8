 Maoist fury fells pro-govt seven

 R. KRISHNA DAS

 Raipur, June 20: Maoists beat seven villagers to death in Chhattisgarhs Dantewada district today for participating in the state-sponsored, anti-Naxalite Salwa Judum campaign. 

 They also took 15 villagers hostage and set over a dozen houses on fire. 

 A senior police official, however, later claimed that the villagers had been released.

 Around 1 am, nearly 350 rebels raided Chikalguda, around 450 km south of state capital Raipur. They called the villagers out to attend a jan adalat (kangaroo court) to frame charges against 25 people for working against the interests of the people by participating in the Salwa Judum. 

 When the villagers trooped out, the rebels took them to the outskirts of the village and chose 10 members they thought were active in the anti-Naxalite campaign. They were assaulted with rods and seven died on the spot. The others escaped but with injuries as the rebels shot at them.

 The injured three were taken to Konta government hospital this morning from where they were referred to a Bhadrachalam hospital in Andhra.

 The Maoists spent more than two hours in the village, which is barely 2 km from Konta police station. But the police and security forces reached Chikalguda only after they had escaped into the nearby forests with the hostages. 

 However, Bastar inspector-general of police T.J. Langkumer said the rebels asked the villagers to join them in an attack on a relief camp near Konta. When the villagers refused, the rebels killed seven of them and injured three others, Langkumer claimed. 

 Sources said the village had been on the target list of the rebels as most of its residents supported the governments anti-Maoist campaign. 

 The rebels reportedly left behind pamphlets and letters, saying that none of their comrades were killed in an encounter at Dantewadas Devarpalli, as claimed by the police. 

 The police had said 10 Maoists were killed in the shootout on June 8. 

 The rebels said scores of villagers were killed by security forces that day. The CPI, too, has alleged that over 140 villagers were killed in an exchange of fire between the rebels and security forces.

 Condemning todays carnage, chief minister Raman Singh said the rebel action reflected the frustration caused by the peoples movement.

 Israeli shell hits Indian soldier

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 17: An Indian soldier was injured by Israeli shelling in southern Lebanon last night where 673 troops from the Indian Army are caught between the shells and rockets being traded by the Israeli forces and the Hizbollah for the last six days.

 The Indian embassy in Beirut is also likely to be moved to Syria as the Israeli forces continued with artillery attacks on the city. 

 An army headquarters source here said Lance Naik Rajinder Singh of the 4 Sikh battalion group was injured in his leg by splinters of an Israeli shell that landed not far from a post of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (Unifil) near Lebanons border with Israel.

 The Indian battalion group (Indbatt) is manning the eastern flank of southern Lebanon and its area of responsibility covers tracts along the Israeli and Syrian border. The Indbatt is commanded by Colonel S.C. Panwar.

 The soldier is stable and safe. The boys are secure and well. The instruction to them from the UN force commander is to stay put in their positions. There is exchange of fire along the Israel border but there is no adverse situation on the Syrian border, the source said. 

 He said the Israeli fire was not directed at the border region but inside Beirut and that the IDF were targets roads, bridges and specific buildings.

 The mandate of Unifil ends on July 31 and unless the Security Council extends it, the troops will have to return.

 Lance Naik Singh was at post numbered 8-33 near the tomb of Sheikh Abad in the border village of Hula. 

 Army sources in Delhi said there was no move to evacuate the Indian troops immediately. However, Poland and Thailand have offered to pull out their soldiers who are serving with Unifil.

 In its area of responsibility the Indbatt is primarily concerned with four hotspots of which one is the tomb of Sheikh Abad, half of which is in Israel and half in Lebanon. Another village, Rajhar, divided between the two countries is also tense. 

 An additional Indian contingent of 187 troops with the UN Disengagement Observers Force is in the Golan Heights, disputed between Israel and Syria but sources in Delhi said the situation there was peaceful for now.

 Troops under the Unifil have been deployed along the Blue Line in southern Lebanon to monitor Israeli troops withdrawal from the area since 2000. 

 Since the Unifil was given the mandate in 1978, it has recorded 249 fatalities among the peacekeepers. India and Ghana have the biggest number of troops in the Unifil but China, France, Ghana, Ireland, Italy and Poland also have troop contributions.

 Press council

 New Delhi, July 6: The Press Council of India has joined the debate over the proposed Broadcasting Services Regulation Bill, reports our special correspondent.

 In a statement, the council said the Constitution provides for unhindered freedom of speech and expression, subject only to reasonable restrictions specified under Article 19 (2).

 There are also sufficient laws that arm the civil and police authorities to take action against violation of a specific law.

 The council, however, said it supports the principle of self-regulation in the media, be it print or electronic. 

 The draft bill deals with the electronic media.

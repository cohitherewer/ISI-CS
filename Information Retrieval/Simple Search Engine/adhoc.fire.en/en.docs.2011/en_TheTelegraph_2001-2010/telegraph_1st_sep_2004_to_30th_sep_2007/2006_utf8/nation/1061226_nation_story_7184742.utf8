The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Desam divided

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Hyderabad, Dec. 25: The Telugu Desam Party is facing yet another split, this time not on the issue of inheritance but on Telengana.

 Desam chief N. Chandrababu Naidu, who broke away from his father-in-law N.T. Rama Rao when the screen icon-turned-politician tried to project his second wife Lakshmi Parvathi as his successor, has called for a review of the partys stand on the statehood demand. The TDP will work for Telugus in any region, Naidu said.

 The comment came in the wake of yesterdays conclave of the partys Telengana leaders in Yadagirigutta, 75 km from Hyderabad, where the statehood issue was discussed.

 The conclave resolved that the 

 Desam had no future in Telengana unless it supported the 

 statehood demand, but Naidu has said all issues would be 

 reviewed at the party meet scheduled during the week.

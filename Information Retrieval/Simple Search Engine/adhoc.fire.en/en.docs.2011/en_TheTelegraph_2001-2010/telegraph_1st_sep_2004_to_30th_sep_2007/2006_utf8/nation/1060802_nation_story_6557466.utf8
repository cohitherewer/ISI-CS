 Wedding soon: Liz

 London, Aug. 1 (PTI): British model and actress Liz Hurley has revealed she is planning a baby with NRI boyfriend Arun Nayar and finally admitted they are to wed.

 I cannot reveal to you the exact date but it is very close. We are even thinking of having a child, Hurley was quoted as saying by the Daily Mirror in a report today.

 The 41-year-old initially dismissed the reports as fiction, but admitted in an interview with the Italian Vanity Fair that she is to wed. 

 When asked how married life will suit her, the mother- of-one replied: Ill let you know. I was with Hollywood actor Hugh Grant for 13 years and we were like husband and wife. So I dont think there will be any great difference.

 Delhi airport to enforce bus ban

 With the help of state transport authorities, AAI/DIAL (Airports Authority of India/Delhi International Airport Ltd) will start the campaign to apprehend buses plying in the diesel mode inside the operational area of IGI airport, and will take suitable legal action against the defaulter, a letter from the airport body, a private-public consortium that has taken over operations from May, has said.

 The onus shall be on the airlines/agency for any violation of the Supreme Courts orders on the airport, it said.

 The Supreme Court had said all public transportation buses running within Delhi were to switch over to CNG by March 31, 2002.

 Stranded man on way home

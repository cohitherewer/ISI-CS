 Karat fires bias barb at EC

 Kasargod, April 30: CPM general secretary Prakash Karat has said he would raise in Parliament the Election Commissions discriminatory attitude towards Kerala and Bengal, where the elections are being held in several phases.

 At a news conference today, ahead of the last phase of elections to the Kerala Assembly on May 3, Karat said the poll panel had chosen staggered polling, in three and five phases in Kerala and Bengal, respectively, as if to indicate that fair franchise was not possible in these two states. 

 And it was not a coincidence that the Left is in a comfortable position in both these states, he said.

 His remarks came after the commissions order for repoll on Tuesday at one booth each in Nadapuram and Perinthalmanna that were part of the second phase of polling yesterday.

 At booth No. 144 in Nadapuram, polling agents had detected a black sticker on the name of the Congress candidate on the electronic voting machine. The poll officers sealed the machine and replaced it with a fresh one, though many voters had cast their votes by then.

 The poll panel also carried out verification of the polling documents at 256 booths that had recorded more than 85 per cent polling in 66 constituencies in the second phase.

 In Perinthalmanna, the repoll was ordered after a snag in one of the EVMs.

 While Karat had reservations about the commissions efforts to weed out poll frauds, Kerala Opposition leader V.S. Achuthanandan said poll panel officials were siding with the ruling United Democratic Front leaders and ordering re-poll to help improve the UDF tally.

 Achuthanandan was unhappy with the commission for having declared all 1,477 booths in Kannur and 365 booths in Kasargod that go to the final phase of polling on May 3 as sensitive or vulnerable.

 The poll panel had ordered massive police deployment in the two northern-most districts that are notorious for CPM high-handedness. 

 Kannur and Kasargod have reportedly witnessed a spate of political vendetta killings between the CPM and the BJP. The CPM has been allegedly displaying political intolerance and intimidating voters in the traditional red fortress.

 CPM state secretary Pinarayi Vijayan said the huge voter turnout was proof of the high political awareness of the voters. He urged the party rank and file not to be affected by the poll panels directives and cast their votes without fear.

 Congress candidate M. Veerankutty, the president of the party in Kozhikode district, alleged that the sticker fraud was aimed at ensuring a win through foul means for his main rival and sitting member Benoy Viswom.

 He said such instances were not limited to his constituency and the Left parties were capable of organised fraud in many constituencies. 

 According to the revised figures issued by the commission, the turnout yesterday was 73.49 per cent, not the earlier 70 per cent published by the poll panel.

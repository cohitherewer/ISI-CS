The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Sania wants to start a school

 - Tennis star seeks land

 Eyes on new turf

 Sania Mirza sure has spunk: no matter how shes been playing on court, shes set to smash an ace off it.

 So as she warms up for the Sunfeast Open starting in Calcutta on Monday no scare, she faces Martina Hingis only well into the tournament the word from Hyderabad is shes planning to set up a tennis academy there.

 On Friday, the tennis star still shining, despite the slide in world ranking from 34 to 70 or thereabouts called on chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy and sought five acres on the outskirts of Hyderabad.

 The idea was to set up a tennis academy so that aspirants do not face the kind of training problems she had before breaking into the international circuit, she is believed to have told Reddy.

 I want other youngsters not to be left out of the game for lack of training, she, accompanied by Sports Authority of India chairman M.S. Raj Thakur, said.

 Sanias not the first sportsperson to have sought government land to set up a sports academy. Badminton champ Pullela Gopichand did before her, and was given two acres in Gacchi Bowli, close to the Infosys complex.

 Also in line are Sydney Olympics weightlifting bronze medallist Karnam Malleswari, football coach Syed Nayeemuddin and chess grandmaster Lanka Ravi.

 Malleswari claims she was offered an acre, but wants more. Nayeemuddin is looking for 16 acres. Ravi wants to set up a chess academy on the lines of the Dubai chess club.

 Andhra sports authority officials said the government did not have enough land to offer for sports academies. Rather, the government was keen that existing facilities and stadia were used to train youngsters.

 We can offer the facilities free on a schedule basis, Thakur said.

 Andhra sports minister M. Satyanarayana Rao said people like Sania would have made enough money from the game and sponsorships to be able to train youngsters for free.

 They should give free training to interested youth in government stadia, he said.

 But some of Sanias colleagues on the domestic circuit would rather that she concentrates on her own game for now.

 It is time she gave more time to improve her game and also took rest for some time, a tennis player who did not wish to be named said.

 Whether or not Sania is allotted the five acres, the Andhra government has been very generous to her: it gifted her the Jubilee Hills plot on which she has built a bungalow estimated to have cost Rs 2 crore.

 Govt jury is out, CPM finds Wal-Mart guilty 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 A Wal-Mart store

 New Delhi, Nov. 28: The specifics of the deal between Wal-Mart and Bharti Group are not yet known but that has not stopped the CPM from delivering the verdict: guilty.

 This is not permissible under the existing policy on foreign investments in India. Wal-Marts franchisee agreement with Bharti enterprises is an attempt to circumvent existing policy regulations to gain a foothold in the Indian market, the CPM politburo said in a statement.

 Bharti had said yesterday that the joint venture would focus on back-end operations involving logistics and technology, which the regulations permit.

 Perhaps aware of this, the government today responded to the CPM assertion by saying that the joint venture would be allowed only if it is in accordance with the countrys rules and regulations.

 We will have a look at whether permissible limits have been adhered to, commerce and industry minister Kamal Nath told reporters.

 Asked if Wal-Mart was making a backdoor entry as the CPM has charged, Nath said: We will see whether it is as per rules and regulations.

 But the politburo has already made up its mind and asked the UPA government to block the deal. It has also called upon other parties, trade unions and mass organisations to join the CPM in a nationwide movement to prevent the entry of Wal-Mart and other multinational retailers into India.

 The CPMs objections are more ideological than legal, though it has referred to the rulebook. FDI in retail trade is not permissible under the existing policy on foreign investment in India, the politburo said.

 The existing policy, however, does allow FDI in back-end operations. 

 The CPM leaders are basing their criticism on the apprehension that it would cause massive displacement of unorganised retailers across the country, besides squeezing domestic manufacturers and farmers.

 The party believes that the UPA government made a mistake by allowing FDI in single-brand retail and warehousing and wholesale trade.

 The CPMs main objection is that Wal-Mart products can be pushed through the joint venture if Bharti buys them in bulk. Indian retail chains can sell imported products.

 Expansion of Wal-Mart chains has caused massive closure of small stores and pauperised poor communities even in the US, the politburo said. 

 It also called for a strong regulatory framework for the fast-expanding domestic organised retail sector.

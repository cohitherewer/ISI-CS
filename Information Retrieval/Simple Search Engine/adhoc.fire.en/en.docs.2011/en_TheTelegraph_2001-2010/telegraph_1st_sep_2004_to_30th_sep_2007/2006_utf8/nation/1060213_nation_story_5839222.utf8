 Meeras had a change of heart

 IMTIAZ GUL

 Islamabad, Feb. 12: Pakistani screen siren Meera thinks exchanging films with India would be a fine way to further boost mutual trust between the two neighbours. 

 At Lahore, while taking questions from the media, she said: It has become necessary to exchange Indian and Pakistani films to boost confidence building. 

 But she did not explain what led to this switch in stand, as only in October she had said: India has a different culture and mindset?. Therefore, Indian movies should not be screened in Pakistan. 

 She had even said then that her year-long stay in Mumbai was enough to convince her that Indian movies should not be shown in her home country. 

 Meera (in picture) shot 

 to fame in India after acting in Mahesh Bhatts Nazar. 

 Now in Lahore, Meera called for joint censors of Pakistani and Indian officials. This will help provide healthy entertainment to the people through movies, the actor said. I think there is no harm in showing Indian films in Pakistan.

 But what has brought about the change of heart? Is it the Pakistan Presidents appreciation for the actor as Pakistans peace ambassador to India? 

 Meera recently met Pervez Musharraf and had dinner at the Presidents house. Expressing his profound appreciation for my performance, Musharraf declared me Pakistans peace ambassador to India. 

 You are Pakistans peace ambassador and I am proud of you, she quoted Musharraf as saying. 

 She added that Musharraf wanted her to stay in Pakistan because her presence would bring respect to the country. 

 Meera said she had just completed a 10-day shoot in Mumbai for the film Akelapan, which is based on Indian actor Parveen Babis life. It is being directed by Pooja Bhatt. 

 This is Meeras second film with the Bhatts.

 I am really enjoying working in India and some of the Indian artistes, including Emran Hashmi, Anil Kapoor and Rani Mukherjee have become my close acquaintances, she claimed.

 Court breather for Husain

 Husain: Welcome relief 

 New Delhi, April 10: Even as the home ministry is thinking of nailing M.F. Husain after having put the Intelligence Bureau on him, the Supreme Court today stayed proceedings on criminal complaints filed against the painter in Indore and Rajkot for outraging religious sentiments by painting Bharat Mata in the nude.

 A bench headed by Justice K.G. Balakrishnan took the decision while issuing notices on his petition which sought transfer of the cases from Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat to Delhi in view of threats to his life.

 The stay comes as a relief for the 91-year-old painter as the Indore court had already issued bailable warrants against him and the court could have issued a non-bailable warrant in case he failed to appear on April 13.

 In his petition, Husain said it would be in the interest of justice if the cases in Indore and Rajkot were clubbed with a similar complaint in the Patiala House district courts here.

 In his petition, Husain clarified that the painting depicting the nude womans figure with names of various Indian cities across her body was painted by him in 2004. The painting was untitled and there was no public exhibition, he said, adding that it was sold to a private collector.

 The painting sparked controversy after it was titled Bharat Mata and put up for an online auction in February 2006 to help Kashmir quake victims. The title was attributed without his prior knowledge or consent, the painter said.

 One Ajay Singh Naruka had filed a complaint against the painter before an Indore court. This was followed by a complaint in Rajkot by BJP worker Ilyas Khan Pathan. Husain pointed out that a similar complaint was also pending before a Patiala House court.

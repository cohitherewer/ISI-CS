 Uproar over religion bill

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Ahmedabad, Sept. 20: Buddhists are furious, so are Dalits, though the Jains dont appear too hassled.

 A day after the Narendra Modi-led Gujarat government amended a 2003 anti-conversion law, there were mixed reactions to the bill that clubs Jains and Buddhists with Hindus.

 Opponents of the Gujarat Freedom of Religion (Amendment) Bill, 2006, say it is a political move by the BJP regime to strengthen pan-Hindu solidarity and consolidate its base with polls 18 months away.

 The bill allows conversions between different sects of the same faith and defines a convert as one who renounces his religion for another. But it does not include one who renounces his denomination and adopts another denomination of the same religion. 

 This means that with Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism put in the same group, the hardest hit would be Dalits who have either embraced Buddhism or were planning to convert. Now Dalit converts would still be called Hindus. The basic purpose, some analysts said, seems to be to discourage Dalits from converting.

 Valjibhai Patel, a Dalit activist who had converted to Buddhism, said he would challenge this legally untenable act in court.

 Under the amendment, which also clarified the meaning of forced conversion, a person need not seek permission if he or she is converting from one sect to another of the same religion. This means a Hindu can easily convert to Buddhism. But a Hindu becoming a Christian or a Muslim can do so only after getting permission from the district collector.

 The bill has, however, excluded Sikhs from its purview, though the Constitution makes it clear that reference to Hindus in laws concerning social welfare or reform or throwing open Hindu religious institutions of public character would include Sikhs, Jains and Buddhists. Also, the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, applies to Buddhists, Jains and Sikhs. 

 Buddhists say the bill, which will be sent to the governor for approval, is aimed at legally expanding Hindutva.

 The Jains, too, see the move as politically motivated but are silent on the amendment as they have not yet decided whether to accept their minority status. But there are voices of dissent from within.

 Samveg Lalbhai, a trustee of the Anandji Kalyanji Jain Trust, says: Jains are culturally like Hindus, but as a religion we would not like Jainism to be clubbed with Hinduism. Our religious ceremonies and rites are different from Vedic Hindu rituals.

 BJP MLA Bhavin Seth agrees. We are culturally like Hindus, he says, and yet different.

 But Pradeep Jain, an RSS spokesman, said though the Constitution has recognised Jains as a minority group, they have never accepted their minority status. We always consider ourselves a part of the larger Hindu community. It is the same with Buddhists. There is a very thin demarcation line between Hindus and Jains and Buddhists who have strong cultural similarities.

 High court advocate Girish Patel disagreed. Going by this new legal interpretation... even China, Japan, Bhutan and Sri Lanka are now Hindu states! he said.

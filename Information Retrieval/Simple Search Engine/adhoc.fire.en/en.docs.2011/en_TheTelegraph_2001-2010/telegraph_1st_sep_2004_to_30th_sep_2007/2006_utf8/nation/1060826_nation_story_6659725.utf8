 Mumbai, Aug. 25: Nineteen-year-old 

 Karan Singh has lost a precious day with his friends and 

 family. The Toronto student is upset at the bad start 

 to his 15-day vacation.

 I am tired and want to go home, were Karans first words as he arrived late last night in Mumbai via Singapore on a Jet Airways flight. Karan was one of the 137 passengers stranded in Amsterdam, where officials detained 12 Indian passengers from a Northwest Airlines plane (NW0042) on Wednesday.

 Jittery relatives who swarmed Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airports terminal were foxed by Northwests ever-changing schedule. 

 Sources said the US carrier had put many passengers on Air-India flights and some had arrived in Mumbai in batches, via Dubai, at 3.41 pm and 5.45 pm. But A-I officials did not confirm this. 

 However, it was on the Jet Airways flight 9W011 and Northwest Airlines NW042 that most of those held up in Amsterdam arrived.

 I am waiting for my grandparents. They are coming by Jet Airways. I hope they are all right, said Aditya Dharne, an anxious 14-year-old. They were visiting my aunt in the US. While my grandmother was there for the past five months, my grandfather spent only 20 days, sighed Aditya. Both are in their sixties.

 Among the first to arrive was Stuart Nicole, who recounted Wednesdays turn of events. Initially, we were told there was a technical problem and the flight was being diverted. It was only later that we came to know of the arrests, the Scotsman said. 

 Nicole did not feel there was anything odd about the 12 Indians arrested. 

 There was nothing suspicious about them. They were just having some fun and didnt behave badly. The air marshals asked us to bend on our seats with heads down. Then, I saw the 12 men being handcuffed and escorted out of the plane, said a cheerful-looking Nicole as he denied that his family was too worried about his safety.

 But, perhaps, the most nervous relative was the mother of Jagpal Gussain, who thought her son might be targeted as he was a Muslim. Those fears faded when the 26-year-old walked in a while later.

 The airline did not treat us badly. The problem was that despite being repeatedly told by the crew to fasten their belts, the 12 men did not pay heed and shuffled in the seats. When the alarm was raised, most of these men were sleeping and didnt even realise what awaited them, said Gussain, who was sitting close to the detained passengers in the economy class.

 Most of those who arrived said there was a lot of panic initially because the crew did not tell them what was happening. 

 Kiran Dalal saw the drama too closely for her comfort. One of the marshals was sitting beside my husband. Some passengers grew suspicious when the 12 men exchanged cellphones and alerted the marshals. Thats when I looked back. Two of them were wearing skullcaps and cloaks. Others looked ordinary enough. All were in their 30s, recalls Dalal.

 However, none saw a racist colour in the detentions. In fact, one of the airhostesses was Indian. Perhaps, the group of 12 did not understand the language very well, was how Gussain summed up the flight of fiasco.

 Pak barks at fake baritone

 IMTIAZ GUL

 Big trouble for 

 faking Big B 

 Islamabad, Sept. 13: Faking the Big Baritone has brought big trouble on a Pakistan company.

 Tele-Fun, a top telephonic entertainment service provider, is set to be showcaused by the Pakistan Telecommunications Authority for faking the voice of Bollywood actors, including Amitabh Bachchan, to sell a quiz show.

 This is gross violation of the terms of licence the company reached with the PTA, spokesman Khurram Mehran told The Telegraph today.

 He said the PTA had received complaints from many cities, especially Karachi, and leading call centres using the 0900 code that Tele-Fun was misleading people into thinking it was running a Kaun Banega Crorepati-type show by copying Bachchans voice.

 The company cannot use the name or voice of Amitabh Bachchan or any other Indian film celebrity without signing a formal contract with him, Mehran said.

 The showcause notice will be issued in two days, asking the company to immediately stop its service and submit a detailed reply in a month.

 The PTA regulates establishment, operation and maintenance of telecom systems and provision of telecom services in Pakistan. It is also responsible for promoting and protecting the interests of telecom services users and adjudicating on complaints against licensees arising out of alleged contravention of regulations.

 We have already investigated complaints about the phone-in company and found that it is misleading callers, Mehran said, adding that PTA might cancel Tele-funs licence or fine it heavily after it submits a written reply.

 A report in Pakistans English language newspaper The News today said the Call Centre Operators Association had written to PTA chairman Shehzada Alam and drawn attention to the violation of the terms of licence.

 We as a call centre promotional body, which uses 0900 for call handling and providing value-added services at premium rates for clients, fear that our business model using 0900 service for various clients is sure to get affected if a backlash from the foreign ministry or Indian government comes, the letter said.

 It added that misleading and cheating callers was sheer violation of PTA regulations.

 The number of the phone-in company is on everybodys lips, especially children, following an intensive year-long ad campaign by Tele-Fun. The ad shows a blue animated telephone-set dancing to a song that has become popular among children.

 The company also offers a wide range of services from beauty tips, concert tickets to cellular numbers of people wanting to make friends at the rate of Rs 14.04 per minute, exclusive of taxes.

 But The News quoted Hassan, an intermediate student who had registered on the available friends list, as saying he had not been able to contact a single girl.

 I tried so many numbers but succeeded in reaching only one and even she cut the call.

 He said the bill had been Rs700-800 more the month he had registered. I believe the recorded messages of these girls are fabricated, he said.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Jan. 7: The three Kashmiri men arrested yesterday, on the suspicion of being Lashkar-e-Toiba militants, were today produced in a metropolitan court in Mazgaon. 

 They have been remanded in police custody till January 16.

 Arrested under the Unlawful Action Prevention Act ? used for the first time in a city criminal case ? the three were interrogated throughout the day by the Anti-Terrorist Squad (ATS).

 According to ATS officials, Mohammed Ramzan Abdul Qazi, 52, Khurshid Ahmed Lone alias Lala, 29, and Arshad Ghulam Hussain Badru, 27 ? arrived in Mumbai after visiting Nashik two days ago. 

 The trio is said to have arrived at Mira Road, a suburb in Thane district, and stayed with a family. In the last two days, they went to many places in Mumbai, including the busy Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus, which has long been a soft target for terror groups.

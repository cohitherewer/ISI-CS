 Comeback hinges on former militant

 Guwahati, May 11: A former militant leader became an unlikely kingmaker after the elections in Assam threw up a hung Assembly.

 The ruling Congress ended up with only 53 seats in its kitty, 18 less than its 2001 tally, but still looked on course to forming the next government with the support of the Bodo Peoples Progressive Front (BPPF) of Hagrama Mohilary, who had previously led the militant Bodo Liberation Tigers. 

 The Congresss position of strength had as much to do with the Asom Gana Parishads flop show ? it did increase its seat count from 20 to 24 but that was small consolation for a party hoping to form the government ? as with the strategic pre-poll alliance with the BPPF.

 I was confident of forming the government and we will form the government now, chief minister Tarun Gogoi told the media.

 Mohilary batted for Gogoi, saying he was hoping that there would be no change in the Congress leadership. This leadership has done well for the states progress and for the Bodo areas and I hope it remains unchanged. Change could affect the process of development, he said.

 Since 1972, no party or alliance has retained power in Assam.

 All newly elected legislators of the Congress will meet on Saturday to elect the legislature party leader. The new government is likely to be sworn in by Monday.

 The Assam United Democratic Front (AUDF), a conglomerate of minorities, did well with a tally of 10 seats on its election debut. Eight of these seats were wrested from the Congress. However, the role it was exepcted to play in government formation in the event of a fractured verdict has been hijacked by the BPPF.

 For the Congress, satisfaction came not just from its unexpected situation of strength but also its performance in the tea belt. The party won in most of the constituencies dominated by the tea tribes, who were supposed to have been disenchanted with the Gogoi government for various reasons.

 The BJP improved on its 2001 performance by two seats, taking its tally to 10. One of the surprise gains for the party was debutant Prasanta Phukans victory by a slender margin in Dibrugarh, a seat that the Congress had always won. 

 Former chief minister Prafulla Kumar Mahanta retained the Barhampur seat, but his AGP (Pragatisheel) was routed. Mahanta had contested the Nagaon seat, too, but lost the race. 

 Like Mahanta, AGP president Brindaban Goswami retained Tezpur and lost Borcholla.

 As many as five ministers lost the elections, as did PCC chief Bhubaneswar Kalita.

 The Congress swept most of the Upper Assam districts and by and large held on to its position in the Barak Valley, North Cachar Hills and Karbi Anglong. The erosion of support for the party was in the minorities-dominated central Assam district of Nagaon and pockets of Lower Assam.

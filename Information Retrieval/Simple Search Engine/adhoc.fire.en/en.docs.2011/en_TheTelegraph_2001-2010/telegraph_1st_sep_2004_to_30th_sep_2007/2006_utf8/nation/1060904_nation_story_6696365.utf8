 Coke froth brims over, now in UP

Mehdiganj (Varanasi), Sept. 3: The fizz over colas has now bubbled up in the heartland.

 After Karnataka and Kerala cracked down on Coca-Cola and Pepsi, the heat is on a Coke plant in Mehdiganj, about 35 km from the pilgrim city of Varanasi.

 But the row is not over pesticide content but excessive levels of heavy metals in water samples from the area and exploitation of groundwater.

 Yesterday, the National Alliance for Peoples Movement (NAPM) backed up the findings of a Central Pollution Control Board report that blew the whistle on how the Mehdiganj plant was polluting water bodies and exploiting groundwater heavily in areas around the bottling unit.

 In 2003, the board had collected water samples from villages around the plant and found concentration of heavy metals, including chromium and cadmium, above the permissible limit of 50 mg per litre in five of the seven samples.

 The NAPM report said the concentration of heavy metals has gone up further between 65 and 75 mg in eight villages within a 3-km radius of the plant.

 The study by the NAPM, an umbrella body of activist groups, also recorded a staggering decline in the groundwater level. Ninety per cent of wells around the area have been affected. As many as 39 per cent of shallow wells and hand pumps have either dried up or are in the process of drying up, said R. Chandrika, an engineer associated with Lok Samity, an NAPM body that conducted the study.

 She added that over the last 10 years, there has been an average drop of 18 feet in the groundwater level.

 The NAPM says if the Coke plant in Palakkad, Kerala, could be closed down in 2004 because of heavy metal concentration in water and overuse of groundwater, the Mehdiganj unit should also be shut.

 But, added NAPM national coordinator Sandeep Pandey, a Magsaysay award-winning social worker, the pollution control board had merely told the plant managers to stick to pollution control norms in disposing of the bio-waste.

 Coca-Cola India senior manager, public affairs and communication, Kalyan Ranjan dismissed the NAPM-sponsored report and said Pandey has been misleading people with facts not corroborated by scientific data.

 Ranjan said the latest report by the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board has declared our effluents non-hazardous.

 On allegations of overusing groundwater, Ranjan said the Mehdiganj plant uses two borewells that draw on an average 1.5 lakh litres of water every day. But there are 532 other borewells within a 5-km radius of the plant. How can one hold the Coke plant responsible for depleting the groundwater level?

 Village leaders in Mehdiganj do not agree. Alarmed by severe water shortage in over 20 villages, they began a hunger strike on June 23 to demand the plants closure.

 Naxalite antidote:10 troopers for a rebel

 New Delhi, April 23: Maoist-hit states, including Bengal, could soon witness a sharp rise in paramilitary presence, with the central forces outnumbering the rebels 10 to one.

 The Union home ministry is also willing to set up three or four specialised anti-Maoist centres at strategic locations ? mainly at inter-state borders ? each equipped with about five helicopters. 

 The centres would be manned mainly by the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) and the pilots would be from the army or BSF.

 The states want 100 central paramilitary battalions (with over 1 lakh ready-to-fight personnel) to go after the roughly 9,000-12,000 rebels. Eight states that have seen Maoist attacks ? Bengal and Bihar included ? now have 29 such battalions between them.

 The demand came from Chhattisgarh chief minister Raman Singh at a recent meeting, chaired by the Prime Minister, of the standing committee of chief ministers of the six worst-hit states. 

 The other five chief ministers ? of Andhra Pradesh, Jharkhand, Orissa, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh ? immediately backed him, Chhattisgarh police chief .P. Rathore said.

 While accepting the demands, the Centre cautioned the states to ensure their own police forces avoided any form of brutality during anti-Maoist operations.

 The chief ministers ? particularly those of Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Orissa ? differed with the Centres stand that development should take precedence over police action in tackling the Maoists, a senior official present at the meeting said.

 The states argued that the Maoists must be contained first, because they dont allow development work to take place.

 Chhattisgarh wants at least 15 paramilitary battalions added to the eight now in the state. Raman Singh said that if Salwa Judum, the government-backed peoples anti-Maoist movement, is to be sustained, the state needed at least eight more battalions to provide security to the tribals taking part in it. Orissa wants the number of battalions raised from three to seven.

 The states also demanded helicopters so that forces could be sent faster during a Maoist attack and the injured evacuated quicker from jungles inaccessible by road.

 Home minister Shivraj Patil said a plan would be drawn up and sent to the cabinet committee on security.

 Two-fold plan

 Observing that the spread of Naxalism was a worrying factor, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has said effective arrangements are being worked out to tackle the problem.

 He said the measures to tackle the problem were two-fold ? improving policing, security and intelligence, and if there are any root causes of discontent and alienation, those also have to be addressed.

 It is a security threat, there is no doubt in it, he told journalists accompanying him on a trip to Germany yesterday, reports PTI.

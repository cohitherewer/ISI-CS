 HC flip-flop on teachers

 Calcutta, July 7: Going back on his interim order issued yesterday, a Calcutta High Court judge today said the judiciary had no authority to direct primary education councils to publish newspaper advertisements seeking applications for teachers posts. 

 Justice J.K. Biswas dismissed petitions by three persons who had applied for teachers jobs but were not called for int- erview. They complained that the councils were not advertising their recruitment drive and only allowing candidates enrolled with employment exchanges to appear for interview.

 Hearing similar petitions moved by three others yesterday, the same judge had extended an earlier high court stay on recruitment of teachers.

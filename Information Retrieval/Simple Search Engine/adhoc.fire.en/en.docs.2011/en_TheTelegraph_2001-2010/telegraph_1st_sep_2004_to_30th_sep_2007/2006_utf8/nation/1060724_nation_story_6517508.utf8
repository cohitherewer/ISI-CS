 School caught in scarf tussle 

 JOHN MARY

 Thiruvananthapuram, July 23: A Catholic school in Kerala has run into trouble with Muslim youths demanding that girls from the community should be allowed to wear headscarves on the premises. 

 On Friday, activists of the Muslim Students Federation, owing allegiance to the Indian Union Muslim League, surrounded the vice-principal of Little Flower Higher Secondary School in Nilambur, 200 km from Kochi. They warned Biju Bady that they would return on August 1 to see if headscarves have been allowed. 

 The authorities are now wondering whether the school uniform, which has been the same for 15 years, should be changed for the sake of keeping peace.

 The 25-year-old school with more than 1,000 students belongs to the Syro-Malabar Catholic church, a prominent Catholic segment in Kerala.

 Boys wear maroon trousers and white shirts with checks, a tie, belt, maroon socks and black shoes. For the girls, there are different uniforms for different age groups. Those at the higher secondary level wear grey salwars, grey striped kameezes, a grey jacket and black shoes.

 Muslim girls who wear scarves have to remove them at the school gate. If anybody is reluctant to do so, they are told by the teachers it is not an affront to religious freedom to take off the scarves but a matter of adhering to a dress code.

 A section of parents and teachers feels the Muslim Students Federation is worried about the growing clout of radical minority outfits and the scarf is a pretext to keep the organisation afloat. 

 The federations state general secretary, P. Lamrath, almost endorsed the argument when he said the Muslim community could not allow its youths to be led astray by fundamentalist forces. Its better the school authorities realised this threat and appreciated our efforts for peace, he said. 

 But he alleged that the school which claims to be secular is doing just the opposite by impinging on the religious freedom of the community. He said girls from the community were being harassed in school because of the scarves.

 They are asked to remove the scarf the moment they enter the school premises. This amounts to violation of fundamental rights. Denying the right to follow ones religion is a transgression of religious freedom, he said.

 Father George Njeralakatt, the school manager who joined two months ago, said he would discuss the matter with other school authorities. Im convinced of the sanctity of the uniform, which is absolutely secular and aesthetic. 

 He had begun the academic year by reading excerpts from the Bible, Ramayana and the Quran in the school assembly. Now, its an issue to be discussed at the higher forums as also by the PTA (parent-teacher association) and the local community, he said.

 Father Njeralakatt has sought time till August 6.

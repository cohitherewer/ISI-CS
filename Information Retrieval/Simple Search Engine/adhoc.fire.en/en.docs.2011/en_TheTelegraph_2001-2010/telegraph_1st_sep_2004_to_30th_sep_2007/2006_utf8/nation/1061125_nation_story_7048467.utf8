 Cancer curse on governor

 Bhopal: When the Madhya Pradesh governor recently put the curse of cancer on the corrupt, he may have pictured himself as bravely hitting out at politicians and bureaucrats. Instead, Balram Jakhar is being accused of insulting cancer patients.

 The 83-year-old Congress veteran had told a public meeting in Indore that those amassing wealth dishonestly would die of cancer.

 t has led to the Indore mayor, Dr Uma Shashi, and fellow doctors attacking Jakhar for being insensitive towards cancer patients. Dr Vinod Kumar of Indores Palisa area said: There is no link between a particular disease and a persons integrity.

 Jakhars defence is that he had only resorted to a manner of speaking. When I say the corrupt will die of cancer, I mean Keep away from corruption and dishonesty.

 Sources said Jakhar had been upset by a series of events, one of them being the unseemly scramble for the post of vice-chancellor for Indores Devi Ahilya Bai University.

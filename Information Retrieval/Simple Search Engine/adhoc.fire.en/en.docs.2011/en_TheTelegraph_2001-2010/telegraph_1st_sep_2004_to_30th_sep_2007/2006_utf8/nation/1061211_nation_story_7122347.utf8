 Perfumed stamp to profess your love

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 10: The dab of perfume on the love letter is pass. Heres something classier to impress your sweetheart.

 Showing a fine nose for business, the postal department is coming out with stamps that give out the fragrance of sandalwood.

 Priced at Rs 15, the perfumed stamp will be released by IT minister Dayanidhi Maran on Wednesday, giving modern-day lovers a reason to look beyond the email.

 It will not be available at all post offices but only at the major ones that have a philatelic bureau or philatelic counter to sell commemorative stamps.

 After buying the stamp, you would not only have to lick it but also rub it gently. 

 Some of the tiny globules of perfume glued to the paper then break, giving out the fragrance.

 The postal department has brought out more than 1,200 stamps since Independence. 

 It released a record 57 stamps this year on subjects ranging from the lakes of India to endangered birds.

 As sandalwood is an integral part of the Indian heritage that needs to be treasured and conserved, the DoP (department of posts) is issuing perfumed postage stamps, an official said. The stamps are of 29 x 39 mm dimensions.

 India is the fourth country after New Zealand, Thailand and Switzerland to introduce perfumed stamps.

 The fragrance, the official added, lasts more than a year. A good thing, considering the pace at which Indias snail mail moves.

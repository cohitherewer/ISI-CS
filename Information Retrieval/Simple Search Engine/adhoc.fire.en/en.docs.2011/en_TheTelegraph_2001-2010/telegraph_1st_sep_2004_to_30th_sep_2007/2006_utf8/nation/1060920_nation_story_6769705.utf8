 Crackdown in navy leak case

 New Delhi: The CBI on Tuesday attached 

 the properties and bank accounts of navy war-room leak accused 

 Ravi Shankaran, a relative of naval chief Admiral Arun Prakash. 

 Shankaran had been declared a proclaimed offender in May, reports our special correspondent.

 Following an order by a Delhi special court, CBI sleuths went to the office of Shanx Oceaneering Private Limited at S-58 Verna Industrial Estate in Salcette, south Goa, and attached the 1,100-square-metre property.

 CBI officials later went to 5/15 Rukmani Bhavan, Shanker Seth Road, Pune, to seize Shankarans Mercedes car but failed to find it. 

 His father Raju Shankaran said someone had come to him with a message from his son, (and) the car was handed over to him sometime ago, a CBI official said.

 Strike rerun at Honda unit

 New Delhi: A year after Japanese two-wheeler 

 giant Honda Motor and Scooter India (HMSI) braved violent 

 strikes, trouble has started brewing in the company once 

 again, reports our special correspondent.

 Around 200 contract workers of HMSI, a fully owned subsidiary of Japans Honda Motor Corporation, have gone on strike demanding regularisation of services. 

 Police forces have been deployed at the companys production facility at Manesar in Haryana.

 Officials said the strike was a matter between the contractors and their workers, and HMSI has nothing to do with it. Production at the factory has not been hit, they claimed. 

 HMSI produces nearly 1,400 scooters and 500 motorcycles a day.

 Wife murder

 Dharmendra Choudhry said.

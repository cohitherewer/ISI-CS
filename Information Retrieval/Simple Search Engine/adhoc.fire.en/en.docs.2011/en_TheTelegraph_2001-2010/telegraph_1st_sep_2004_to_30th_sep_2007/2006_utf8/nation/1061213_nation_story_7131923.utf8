 Pranab eases N-fears

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 12: External affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee today defended the nuclear pact passed by the US Congress last week, saying there was nothing in the document that would compromise Indias strategic programme.

 We will not allow external scrutiny of, or interference with, the strategic programme, Mukherjee said in Parliament amid calls from the BJP and the Left to scrap the agreement. 

 He said it was significant that waivers had been granted from the US Atomic Energy Act. This will enable cooperation in civilian nuclear energy trade despite Delhis refusal to accept full-scope safeguards and its resolve to maintain a strategic programme.

 Mukherjee told both Houses the US administration would fulfil all commitments made to India in the July 18 and March 2 joint statements. We fully expect the July 18 and the March 2 separation plans to be reflected in the text of the 123 agreement, he said. The two sides are still negotiating the 123 pact, a bilateral arrangement between Washington and Delhi.

 Under the separation plan, India has offered to put 14 of its 22 nuclear reactors under International Atomic Energy Agency(IAEA) safeguards. 

 The minister stressed that the opening up of nuclear trade was a multi-layered process that also involves negotiations with the IAEA and the Nuclear Suppliers Group.

 The test is to secure full civil nuclear cooperation with the international community while protecting our strategic programme, Mukherjee said. The pacts objective, he added, is to dismantle technology denial regimes that have targeted India for decades.

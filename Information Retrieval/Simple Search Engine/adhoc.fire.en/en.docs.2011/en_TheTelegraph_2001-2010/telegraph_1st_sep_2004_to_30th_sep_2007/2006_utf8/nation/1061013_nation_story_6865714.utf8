NATION BRIEFS

 Mumbai, Oct. 12: Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport is poised for a leap into the league of Londons Heathrow and Singapores Changi if a master plan for the transformation of the countrys busiest airport now handling 37 per cent of the countrys air traffic takes shape.

 The blueprint has been designed to expand and upgrade infrastructure to cater to 40 million passengers and one million tonnes of cargo per year, said G. V. Krishna Reddy, chairman of Mumbai International Airport, a venture in which GVK-SA controls 74 per cent and the Airports Authority of India 26 per cent. The expansion will be carried out in four stages by 2020.

 New Delhi (PTI): Maneka Gandhi has sought action against a Saudi diplomat from whose Delhi residence a neelgai was seized. It is appalling that a junior diplomat should break the laws of the country that he is posted in, the MP said.

 New Delhi (PTI): Apprehending arrest after deposition, Bharti Yadav, the key witness in the Nitish Katara murder case, has urged Delhi High Court to direct release of her passport so that she can go back to the UK after deposing before the trial judge on November 25. The elusive Bharti also repeated the plea that the depositions be held in-camera so that neither Nitishs mother Neelam Katara nor the media had access to her.

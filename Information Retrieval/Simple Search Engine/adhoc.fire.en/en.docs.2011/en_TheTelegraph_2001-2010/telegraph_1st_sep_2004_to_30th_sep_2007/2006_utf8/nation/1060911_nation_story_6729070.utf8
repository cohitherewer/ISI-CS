 Townships loss is gain for farmland and zoo titan

 M.R. VENKATESH

 Vandalur, Sept. 10: A farmers battle to save their land from a township project has allowed South Asias largest zoo to escape a slow death.

 Families from some 100 villages backed by the Opposition ADMK as well as the governments ally PMK have forced the chief minister to drop his plans for a township 4 km from the zoos boundary.

 The 5.1-sq-km Arignar Anna Zoological Park was set up about 35 km from Chennai near the Vandalur reserve forest in 1985 after animals in the city zoo began falling ill from smoke and noise pollution. 

 The then MGR government shifted the birds and animals to the natural surroundings of the new home and shut down the cramped city zoo, built in 1855 near the Central railway station.

 Yet 21 years later, the new zoo in Kancheepuram district suddenly faced the same threat of urbanisation and pollution last week when the M. Karunanidhi government announced the 30,000-acre Chennai Satellite City project.

 The governments argument was that Chennais population 70.4 lakh according to the 2001 census was expected to rise to 1.25 crore in the next 20 years. If the cram- ped city, its infrastructure creaking, wanted to attract investments, a satellite townsh- ip was the answer.

 The administration said only 13,000 families from 50 villages would be affected and promised them compensation at market rates which, with the planned IT corridor only 25 km away, have been shooting up in the area.

 But the villagers alleged a much larger number of families would lose their land.

 The government was going by the concept of revenue villages (which often club several small hamlets). If you count the individual hamlets, the number is over 100, said Manoharan in Oom- anancheri, 4 km from Vandalur.

 Gomathi, a farmers wife, was relieved that the project was off. If we lost our farmland, what would we have done? Even if the government paid us the market rate, we had no other trade or profession to fall back on.

 A major part of the 30,000-odd acres marked out by land survey officials falls in a natural drainage area, the villagers said. Large-scale construction would block the rainwaters escape routes, destroy the farmers age-old system of multiple-tank irrigation and cause an environmental disaster.

 As for the Vandalur zoo, it would mean a death sentence.

 The villagers got in touch with the PMK whose leader S. Ramadoss, after a party-sponsored public hearing in the area, virtually issued an ultimatum to Karunanidhi to rethink his plan. ADMK chief Jayalalithaa launched a personal attack, accusing Karunanidhis family of trying to pick up stakes in the project. She circulated a four-page pamphlet criticising the project across the villages.

 Even after the governments latest announcement scrapping the project, farmer Kamalakannan is left with a sense of betrayal.

 We voted for the DMK-led alliance in the Assembly elections, he rued. We didnt expect such a shocking land-grab attempt that threatened to uproot us.

 We still cant trust Karunanidhi he is being pressured by his family members, another villager said.

 For now, however, they are relieved that their land and the zoo have survived.

 Envoy passport revoked

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 15: The government has revoked the passport of defiant diplomat Harish Kumar Dogra who continues to stay in New Zealand even after he was sacked for indiscipline.

 The ministry of external affairs has informed the New Zealand government about the move. 

 The officials said Dogras wife Neeta and their domestic help Sah continue to hold their passports. The government is making all efforts to ensure that all of them return to Delhi. 

 After their visa expired, the Dogras were staying on a 10-day permit till May 4. The family then applied for a fresh visa and was given 40 days time, said officials. 

 Sources said the envoy and his family might seek political asylum in New Zealand and avoid returning to India. 

 The government stripped Dogra of his accreditation as high commissioner after he refused to obey his recall order. He was asked to return after the local Indian community complained against him.

 Dogra also wrote a letter accusing foreign secretary Shyam Saran of plotting against him. The letter was leaked to the media, leaving the government red-faced. 

 Another IFS officer, K.P Ernest, has taken charge as the new high commissioner.

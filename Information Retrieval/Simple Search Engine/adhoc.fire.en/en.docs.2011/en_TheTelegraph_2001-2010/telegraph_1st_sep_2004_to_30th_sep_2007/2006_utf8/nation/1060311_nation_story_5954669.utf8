 Gun sparks House uproar

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 10: The gun that made its way to Parliament yesterday has got the BJP firing on all cylinders.

 Priyanka and Robert Vadras personal security officer was found carrying the gun, raising a storm over how such a security breach could occur.

 The Opposition party, whose obsession with the Gandhi family is well-known, went ballistic today, despite Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee telling them not to overreact.

 Priyanka and her husband were seated in the Speakers gallery to hear Rahul Gandhi make his maiden speech in the House, when the officer was caught with the gun in his pocket. 

 While neither Priyanka nor Robert seemed to have noticed the lapse, security personnel in the House escorted the officer out of the gallery almost as soon as he had entered.

 In the Lok Sabha, BJP MPs today unleashed a volley of abuses at the Congresss first family. Most of them were so unparliamentary that they had to be expunged. 

 It is a major security lapse, said the BJPs deputy leader, V.K. Malhotra, who raised the matter during zero hour. He demanded to know how an armed security personnel could slip past the stringent security arrangements in the House.

 Amid the war of words, the Speaker was heard saying: I am watching you all. Dont think youll get away with it. I am wondering who my next victim will be.

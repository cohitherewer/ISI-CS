 Mumbai, Sept. 20 (PTI): 

 Canara Bank has issued a legal notice to actress Ameesha 

 Patel and her family members seeking recovery of dues amounting 

 to Rs 11.75 crore, loaned to them for their business firm.

 The notice has been sent to Ameesha, her mother Asha, father Amit, actor-brother Ashmit and their Nashik-based firm Messrs Jai Electronics, bank lawyer Nishit Dhruv said.

 The notice, issued on September 9, has asked the Patels to pay the amount within seven days, failing which the bank would be compelled to move court. We shall proceed in accordance with law and, if necessary, file a suit for recovery of dues, said Dhruv.

 Ameeshas mother said she was not aware of this. These are attempts to malign our family and some vested interests are behind this, she said.

 Other members of the family were not available for comment.

 Ameesha, Asha, Amit and Ashmit are directors of the family business firm, which had obtained overdraft and other credit facilities from Canara Banks Queens Road branch in Mumbai in 2001. Later, the credit facilities were transferred to the banks Girgaum branch.

 All members of the Patel family, including Ameesha, had guaranteed repayments to the extent of Rs 10 crore along with further costs and charges, the notice said.

 The bank had also granted the firm foreign advance payment guarantee limit of Rs 15 crore under a supplementary hypothecation agreement on August 13, 2003, for a total limit of Rs 22.23 crore. Fresh personal guarantees were given by the company directors for this facility, it said.

 The notice further said the directors were jointly and individually liable to pay the dues.

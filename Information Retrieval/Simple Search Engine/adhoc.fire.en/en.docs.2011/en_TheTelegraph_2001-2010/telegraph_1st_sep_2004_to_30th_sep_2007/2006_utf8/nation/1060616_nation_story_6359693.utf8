 Singh tells team to give juniors work

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 15: Most of the 38 junior ministers in the Manmohan Singh government are unhappy that their bosses give them little to do. 

 There are no meetings to attend, no crises to resolve, no complaints to administer and, worst of all, no files to sign.

 Why are we there at all? ask some of the ministers of state who have made their mark in their parties and outside. They include Jairam Ramesh, Ashwani Kumar, Pawan Kumar Bansal and Prithviraj Chavan.

 After months of complaints, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh stepped in. On June 9, he wrote to his 34 cabinet ministers, requesting them to allocate work to their juniors and ensure their experience and expertise were used in decision-making and improving the quality of governance.

 Rural development minister Raghuvansh Prasad Singh ? two ministers of state work under him, Suryakanta Patil and A. Narendra ? said he would reply in a couple of days. He said there was enough and more work, which he had parcelled off to the two. Its for the ministers to make what they want to of their areas of work.

 Sources in the ministry said Patil, who also holds the parliamentary affairs portfolio, appeared more interested in that ministry, and Narendra is focused on one agenda: a separate Telengana state.

 Often, the minister finds to his discomfiture that the two chairs placed next to him on the dais (at ministry functions) for his deputies lie vacant, a source said.

 Neither Patil nor Narendra was available for comment, but sources said the commonest reason for junior ministers staying idle was the cabinet ministers zeal to centralise work. 

 Commerce and industry minister Kamal Nath, for instance, has upset colleagues Jairam and Ashwani by his reluctance to give them anything other than huge rooms as offices, sources said. Jairam keeps himself busy with the handicrafts sector, which is close to Congress president Sonia Gandhis heart, and the National Advisory Council, of which he is a member.

 Communications and IT minister Dayanidhi Maran, too, has kept his deputy, Shakeel Ahmed, out of the loop. Ahmed, who once headed the Bihar unit of the Congress, cannot even complain because Maran represents one of the UPAs main pillars, the DMK.

 The defence and external affairs ministries are the exceptions, where the work is fairly well demarcated.

 Singh who holds the foreign portfolio, has kept sensitive beats like the neighbours, the US, China and Russia to himself, but the two junior ministers are busy enough. Anand Sharma has Latin America, Africa and the European Union while E. Ahmed has West Asia, Asia and passports.

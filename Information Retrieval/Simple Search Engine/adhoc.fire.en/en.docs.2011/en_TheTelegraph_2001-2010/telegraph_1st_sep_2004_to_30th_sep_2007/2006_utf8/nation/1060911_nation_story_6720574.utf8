 Modi star at BJP meet

 Modi: On a roll

 Dehra Dun, Sept. 10: At 

 the BJPs national executive meet, Narendra Modi is 

 a star and the only one.

 On the opening day, the Gujarat chief minister was the lone leader to have been received with genuine enthusiasm by the largely dispirited party cadre.

 The next day saw him mobbed by reporters. Asked when he was moving to national politics, Modi replied with an anecdote.

 There is a BJP worker in Gujarat, he said, who makes speeches that always end with: What else can Narendra Modi achieve in Gujarat?

 Modi oozed confidence. Assembly elections are due in his state by the end of 2007, and there is feverish speculation in BJP circles that Modi will be projected nationally after that. He draws crowds wherever he goes, and Uttar Pradesh, Uttaranchal and Punjab are clamouring for his presence in the run-up to polls in these states.

 In Dehra Dun, other BJP national leaders and state satraps like former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Kalyan Singh, who faces Assembly polls early next year, were ignored while the media made a beeline for Modi. And he did not disappoint.

 Modi held forth on several issues, including terrorism and internal security, and skirted topics like dissent in the Gujarat BJP and the recent resignation of important state leaders like Nalin Bhat.

 Modi rubbished the suggestion that the Gujarat riots were the trigger for the July 11 Mumbai blasts. Were there no terrorist strikes before the Gujarat riots? he countered. How far back in history can you go? Will you now blame the Partition for terrorism?

 Asked about Gujarati commuters being the target of the train attacks, he said: Forty per cent of Mumbais population is Gujarati. When Mumbai gets flooded, will we say that Gujaratis are being targeted?

 He mentioned an exhaustive exchange with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on how India should counter terrorism. The two had met during the recent chief ministers conference in Delhi.

 Modi said there should be a national consensus on terrorism and added that the President should call all former Prime Ministers and begin talks to build a consensus on internal security threats.

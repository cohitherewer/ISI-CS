 Husain sorry for nude painting

 Mumbai / New Delhi (PTI): Under attack from Hindu organisations for allegedly painting Bharatmata in an obscene manner, M.F. Husain apologised on Tuesday. The painting was withdrawn from a Delhi auction.

 The Hindu Janjagruti Samiti and the VHP had attacked him after the painting was displayed on many websites.

 Sharan Apparao, curator of Apparao Galleries in Delhi where the painting was to go under the hammer on Wednesday, said she had been receiving numerous calls demanding its withdrawal.

 There were many calls, mostly from Maharashtra. Some of them were using abusive language which I think is not acceptable. 

 But, basically some of them were saying remove the nude painting. Dont sell India, why is Mother India being shown nude? she said.

 Alert on water table decline

 Ludhiana (PTI): Water management experts 

 have forecast that the water level in the central districts 

 of Punjab will fall between 70 and 160 ft by 2023 due to 

 over-exploitation of ground waters by farmers.

 Ground water is being overdrawn by farmers especially for rice plantation. The level in the central districts comprising Moga, Sangrur, Patiala, Ludhiana, Jalandhar and Kapurthala would rapidly come down to an alarming stage by 70 and 160 ft by 2023, Punjab Agricultural Universitys additional director of research G.S. Hira said.

 The table in 95 per cent of central zone areas of Punjab has dipped to over 30 ft with a rate of 2 ft per year.

 Minister post

 New Delhi (PTI): Minister of state Dasari 

 Narayana Rao has been stripped of the mining portfolio, 

 but would retain coal.

 An official communique on Tuesday said the President, acting on the Prime Ministers advice, has made Rao the minister of state for coal.

 Bomb scare

 Mumbai (PTI): A bomb squad was called 

 in on Tuesday after an unclaimed bag created panic at Chhatrapati 

 Shivaji International Airport. However, no bomb was found, 

 an official source said, adding that there were no threatening 

 calls or messages.

 Slipper at judge

 Mumbai (PTI): An accused hurled a slipper 

 at a judge on Monday, infuriated at being awarded life term 

 for a dacoity. The fast-track court judge, however, dodged 

 Rajkumar Sharmas slipper. He was taken into custody 

 for contempt of court, but said he did not repent for his 

 action.

 Around 40 writers from Asia and Africa would 

 participate in a two-day meet ? The Africa Asia Literary 

 Conference ? at Neemrana in Rajasthan, starting next Wednesday.

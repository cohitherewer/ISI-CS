 Diamond heist in IT hub

 Hyderabad, May 16: Burglars struck in the IT hub of Hyderabad early today and escaped with a big haul of diamonds and other jewellery worth Rs 10 crore, reports our special correspondent.

 Police commissioner A.K. Mohanty, who visited the scene of the crime, said the robbers broke into the three-storey jewellery mart of the Dubai-based Joy Alukkas group using ropes kept on the terrace by advertisers to lift hoardings.

 The robbers cleaned off the diamond jewellery in the display panels on all the floors of the mart. The police said the marts management did not report the theft till afternoon, thus delaying the hunt for the burglars.

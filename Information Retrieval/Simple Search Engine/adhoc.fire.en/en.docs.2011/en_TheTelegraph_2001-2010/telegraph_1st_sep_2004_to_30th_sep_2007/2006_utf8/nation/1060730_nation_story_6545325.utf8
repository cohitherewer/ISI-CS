 RAW Director PK 

 Hormese Tharakan 

 Lucknow, July 29: The Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), the external intelligence agency, has opened its first office in Uttar Pradesh.

 Director P.K. Hormese Tharakan and other senior officers were present when the office in the Indiranagar neighbourhood of Lucknow was inaugurated late last evening. It will be run by an officer of the rank of deputy director.

 Tharakan later held a meeting with intelligence officials, including those of the Subsidiary Intelligence Bureau and the Intelligence Bureau.

 So far, RAW had been operating in the state from its Delhi office. The agency will now be able to intensify its vigil on the long and porous border that Uttar Pradesh and Uttaranchal share with Nepal. 

 Officers busy preparing the dossiers on the foreign jihadi organisations active in the state said on condition of anonymity that an office in Lucknow would help the organisation take a closer look at the newly-emerging foreign jihadi modules that have plotted a series of strikes in the recent past.

 In 2005, after the abortive attack on the makeshift temple in Ayodhya, the team investigating the case unearthed a module of the Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammad. 

 The new menace is Harkat-ul Jihadi Islami, an officer said, adding that this Bangladesh-based jihadi group is fast spreading its tentacles in Uttar Pradesh.

 The groups name surfaced in the wake of the Varanasi blasts earlier this year.

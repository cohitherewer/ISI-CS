 Shops in Delhi homes

 New Delhi, March 28 (PTI): The Centre tonight notified amendments in the capitals Master Plan, 2001, allowing commercial activities in residential areas. The decision brought relief to small shopkeepers gripped by anxiety in the wake of a Supreme Court directive.

 The court had directed the Municipal Corporation of Delhi to close down commercial establishments operating out of residential premises.

 The notification is aimed at helping small traders as the Supreme Court has also directed that major and minor violators should be segregated. The decision has been taken in that spirit, minister of state for urban development Ajay Maken said.

 The new policy would legalise commercial activities on the ground floor of residential premises on as many as 118 roads. 

 Resident welfare associations in Delhi are opposed to allowing commercial activities on residential areas as they feel this would put undue strain on the infrastructure. But Maken told them not to panic and added that the municipal commissioner has been informed of the decision.

 Ferry afire after death

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Krishnagar, June 18: A vehicle in flames after a road death is a common sight, but Bengals Nadia district today saw a ferry on fire after a passenger fell off and drowned in the Hooghly.

 Allegedly, none of the boatmen tried to save Prasenjit Debnath, who had been sitting at the edge of the mechanised boat travelling between Swarupgunj and Nabadwip before he disappeared in the waters, about 100 km from Calcutta.

 The about 120 passengers, too, just watched.

 But some people on the Swarupgunj side, who saw the 19-year-old fall into the river, launched their own rescue bid but in vain.

 Angered by the death, they attacked the ticket counter and set fire to it and the boat, tied to the harbour. The counter was reduced to ashes in minutes. Five people who were sitting inside were beaten up and the union office of the ferry employees was ransacked.

 Around 20 people were injured. Of them, six were policemen, who were greeted with brickbats. Two fire engines were prevented from making it to the harbour. More policemen moved in and lathicharged the mob. 

 We have arrested 10 people and are looking for more, Nadia superintendent of police R. Rajsekharan said. 

 The body could not be found. The police said Prasenjit was going to Nabadwip where he worked in a tailoring shop. He was the sole earner in his family, made up by a sick father, mother and a 12-year-old schoolgoing sister.

 The chief of the Nabadwip panchayat samiti, Haridas Debnath, who happened to be at the scene of violence, tried to pacify the mob but was beaten up for his efforts.

 They were furious. Everybody knew Prasenjit.? He was running the family single-handed, he said. 

 The police said the cooperative managing the ferry service did not keep a stock of life jackets and tubes, and didnt have a system to prevent overcrowding. The mismanagement, however, is not restricted to Nadia. 

 Lagandeo Singh, the head of the co-operative that manages ferry services on the Hooghly, said: Mechanised boats are very unsafe and there is no system to monitor the crowding or the stock of life jackets and tubes.

 Singh, a CPM MLA, added: We have urged the government repeatedly to introduce launches instead. But nothing has happened.

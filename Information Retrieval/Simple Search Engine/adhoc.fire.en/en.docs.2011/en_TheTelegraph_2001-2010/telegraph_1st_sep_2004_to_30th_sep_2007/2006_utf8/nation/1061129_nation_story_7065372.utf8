 300 years to clear justice backlog

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Bhardwaj: Grim picture

 New Delhi, Nov. 28: Bengals subordinate courts have a backlog of 19 lakh cases, among the countrys highest, Union law minister Hans Raj Bhardwaj told the Lok Sabha today.

 Replying to a calling-attention motion by BJP leader V. K. Malhotra, Bhardwaj said subordinate courts are the worst affected by the pile-up of 2.5 crore cases in the country, which would take 300- 400 years to be disposed of. 

 High courts have a back-log of 42 lakh and the Supreme Court 38,000.

 Uttar Pradesh tops the list, with 42 lakh cases pending in various lower courts. It is followed by Gujarat (30 lakh), Bengal (19 lakh), Bihar (12 lakh), Karnataka (10 lakh), Rajasthan (10 lakh) and Andhra Pradesh (9 lakh).

 Judges are struggling to dispose of as many cases as they can. A high court judge disposes over 2,300 cases in a year. The problem is there are not enough judges, said Bhardwaj. High courts require 350 more judges while Supreme Court has four vacancies, the minister said.

 Members werent impressed with the argument. Justice delayed is justice denied. The law minister should act instead of giving ceremonial replies, Malhotra said.

 The minister shot back, saying states, too, need to put more resources in courts. You cannot blame me for the mess. States need to respond, they are equally responsible.

 Explaining the problem, Bhardwaj said there are superior and subordinate courts. The Supreme Court and Delhi High Court are under the administrative control of the central government. The other high courts and the subordinate courts have to be funded by states.

 The states have not responded adequately because, frankly, they dont have the money. The backlog is not cleared because we dont add more judges. It isnt entirely the Centres problem. We have a law minister in every state, he added.

 When Speaker Somnath Chatterjee asked the minister if judges agreed to restrict the number of holidays and work on Saturdays in some states, Bhardwaj said: But again, we have to compensate them monetarily. 

 The minister said the Centre plans to start the Gramin Nyayalayas, which will see judges going to villages. We need at least 7,000 judges for the purpose. I have written to states. Let us see what we can do. I am not sitting idle.

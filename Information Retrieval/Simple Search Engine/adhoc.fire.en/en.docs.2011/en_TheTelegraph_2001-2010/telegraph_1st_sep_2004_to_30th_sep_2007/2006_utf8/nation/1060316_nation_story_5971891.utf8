 Confession dogs Dutt

 Mumbai, March 15: The CBI believes Sanjay Dutts retraction of his confession in the Bombay blasts case may not help the actor much in court.

 The agencys optimism stems from the alleged similarity of Dutts version with a confession ? also retracted ? by jailed gangster Abu Salem.

 The confessions made by Dutt to Mumbai police and those of Salem to the CBI match to the last word. And so, (despite the retractions) it will convince the court that Dutt and Salem are both culpable, a senior CBI officer said.

 Yesterday, Salem and Dutt appeared together at a designated Tada court hearing the case.

 The CBI says Salem supplied arms and ammunition to Dutt and 86 others on the orders of Dawood Ibrahim and his brother Anees to carry out blasts in Mumbai.

 Dutt had confessed on April 26, 1993. His statement, made before deputy commissioner of police Krishnalal Bishnoi, kept him in jail for two years.

 In the widely available transcript, the actor admits to meeting Dawood and Anees in Dubai on the sets of Yalgar. It reveals how one day in January (1993)? Hanif and Samir came to my house along with a man by name Salem. 

 Hanif and Samir Hingorani (co-owner of Magnum Video) were known to Dutt and were part of his charmed circle, the officer said.

 From here, the story is astoundingly similar to the one told by Salem to the CBI, said Dhananjay Kamlakar, deputy commissioner (crime), Mumbai police.

 Salem, Samir and Baba Musa (another Bombay blast co-accused whose confessional statement matches those of Dutt and Salem) allegedly came to deliver the weapons ? an AK-56, cartridges and some nine grenades ? at Dutts Pali Hill house on the morning of January 16, 1993.

 Salem and Musa had started from Andheri, a Mumbai suburb, at dawn in a white Maruti Omni and picked up Samir, the police said. A statement by a police constable stationed at Dutts home matches with the confessions of how firearms in a Maruti van reached the house.

 Salem confessed that he, along with Samir and Musa, delivered three AK-56 rifles, hand grenades and ammunition at Dutts Pali Hill home just before the 1993 blasts. The weapons and ammunition were brought from Gujarat.

 Salem said that a few days later, he went to Dutts house again to pick up some of the arms and ammunition.

 The confessions of Dutt and Salem reveal that the gangster and co-accused Manzoor Ahmed and Hanif Kadawala took back some weapons from the actors home and kept them with a woman, Zaibunnisa Kazi, who is in hiding.

 On Monday, the CBI proposed that charges be framed against Salem and his accomplice Riaz Siddiqui under anti-terror law Tada and other acts for their alleged complicity in the 1993 blasts. The court deferred the matter till March 18 as the duo sought time to argue.

 The draft of the charges was submitted to the designated judge, P.D. Kode, who decided to hear the arguments of the CBI and the accused before framing the charges.

 Ashok Sarogi, Salems lawyer, argues his client didnt have any idea about what he supplied to Dutt?. He did deliver a consignment but was under the impression that it contained silver bric-a-brac. My clients so-called confession was under duress.

 Sangh turns on Sangh history

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Arjun: Last laugh?

 New Delhi, May 9: This should provide HRD minister Arjun Singh the final justification for throwing out textbooks authored by pro-RSS historians ? for the Sangh now has a problem with its history written by them. 

 Makhan Lal, the historian commissioned by NCERT during Murli Manohar Joshis saffronisation of education to write history texts for Class VI and XI, is in trouble for his account of history of the RSS and Jan Sangh. Lal has written India and the World for Class VI and Ancient India for Class XI students.

 But his volume on the Sanghs history has been withdrawn by the BJP for citing wrong reasons for the creation of the RSS-Jan Sangh. 

 Lal has suggested that the RSS, and later the Jan Sangh, were created to counter the Muslims. This has made the Sangh unhappy as it claims the RSS came into being for the promotion of Hindutva, rather than to oppose minorities. 

 Sources said another reason for withdrawing the book is that it apparently contains references that are too anti-Muslim even for the RSS. 

 The third problem with the book is reportedly about references to Mahatma Gandhi. Though party insiders wonder why an exception has been taken to their genuine belief that the origin of minority-appeasement was in Gandhis attitude towards the Muslims, the BJP was obviously embarrassed enough to withdraw the volume.

 The book, titled RSS Aur Bharatiya Jana Sangh Ki Sthapana Ka Itihas (The History of Creation of the RSS and Bharatiya Jana Sangh), was a part of 16 volumes brought out by the BJP during the partys silver jubilee celebrations in December last year. The cover of the book mentions Makhan Lal and Jagdish Kishore Mathur as the authors. 

 It was withdrawn recently after objections from the Sangh. Lal was not available for comment and Mathur, though he refused to talk, is known to be unapologetic about the books contents.

 SC to review raze ban

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 1: The Supreme Court today decided to look into the constitutional validity of a central legislation declaring one years moratorium on the sealing and demolition drive in the capital.

 A bench headed by Chief Justice Y.K. Sabharwal admitted a bunch of petitions against the Delhi Laws (Special Provisions) Act, which sought to stop the demolition and sealing of unauthorised structures initiated on the orders of the apex court and Delhi High Court.

 It said the petitions raised important questions that require deeper consideration. The bench, however, refused to pass an interim order without giving the Centre an opportunity to defend the legislation. It has asked the government to respond within 10 days to the petitions, which sought an interim stay on the legislation till the matter is decided.

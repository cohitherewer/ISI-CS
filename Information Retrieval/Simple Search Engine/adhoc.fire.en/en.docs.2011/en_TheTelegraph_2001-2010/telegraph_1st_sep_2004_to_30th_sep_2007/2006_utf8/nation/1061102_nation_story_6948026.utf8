 Bengal plots growth map

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Asim Dasgupta

 Calcutta, Nov. 1: The Bengal government is drawing up a road map to achieve a 9 per cent rate of growth in the states gross domestic product (SGDP) over five years, finance minister Asim Dasgupta has said. 

 In the process, seven lakh new jobs will be created and the fraction of people below the poverty line will fall to 10 per cent from 22 per cent.

 SGDP is the value of all goods and services sold in a state within a year.

 Dasgupta, speaking at a Bengal National Chamber of Commerce and Industry seminar today, said for the pace of growth to accelerate to 9 per cent from 7.4 per cent now, agriculture must expand at more than 4 per cent annually, industry at over 7 per cent and services at 11 per cent. 

 Until the countrys first-quarter growth rate almost touched 9 per cent, Bengals gross domestic product had been increasing at a rate faster than the national average. 

 Of the 7 lakh new jobs envisaged in the blueprint over five years, 3 lakh will be in agriculture and allied sectors, 3.5 lakh in the industrial sector and 50,000 in services. 

 Businessmen at the seminar had no quarrels with the destination Dasgupta appeared to be promising them, but they wanted to know just how Bengal would get there. 

 Targets are fine, but how can these be achieved? The government doesnt have a clear-cut road map as yet. Without that, target-setting has little significance, said Santosh Saraf, president of Merchants Chamber of Commerce. 

 Saraf said there was a need for clear guidelines on land use and conversion. The conversion of agriculture land for industrial purposes takes ages and this hinders the growth of industrialisation in the state. In absence of a clear-cut policy on land use, we are bound to see Singur-like incidents more often, he added.

 Bharat Chamber of Commerces S. Rungta echoed the concern. There are bottlenecks and I dont think the government has a defined road map for the states development.

 Both industrialists put the spotlight on small and medium enterprises (SMEs), which, they said, were being treated as a step-child by a government that was only helping large companies. 

 Dasgupta promised there would be lesser problems for small units in getting land. The conversion will also be done within one month for SMEs if they have proper record of registry of the acquired land, the minister said.

 The state government, Dasgupta said, was also talking to 400 colleges in the state to offer Bachelor in Business Administration courses.

 Pat amid Blue Line dilemma

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 26: Indian soldiers on the Thin Blue Line who were caught in the middle of Israels cluster bombs and the Hizbollahs Katyusha rockets in southern Lebanon will be felicitated by the United Nations for extraordinary courage under fire.

 But the fate of Indias participation in an expanded and more powerful UN peace enforcement mission after August 31 is yet to be decided. Delhi is uncomfortable with a mandate that calls for the forcible disarming of the Hizbollah, as insisted upon by Israel.

 The force commander of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (Unifil), Maj. Gen. Alain Pellegrain, has recommended the 4 Sikh, the 4th battalion of the Indian Armys Sikh regiment, commanded by Colonel S.C. Panwar, for a unit citation. 

 The UN secretary-general, Kofi Annan, is likely to personally compliment the unit during a visit to Lebanon on August 29 and 30.

 A total of 673 soldiers from the Indian Army are in Lebanon as part of the Unifil contingent. Unifils deputy force commander, Brigadier Jai Prakash Nehra, is also from India.

 The Indian Army troops did not fire a single shot because the Unifils mandate is only to observe and report but the soldiers braved the 33-day war on the border between Lebanon and Israel, often for days without food and water, because Israeli bombardment had cut off supply lines.

 At one point, the rations of the 4 Sikh platoon in a village near the border was down to just an onion and four potatoes till trucks made their way to the position after repeated appeals to the Israeli forces to let a convoy through. 

 Israeli tanks also blasted barracks in which the Indians were staying but the soldiers had hunkered down in bomb shelters. Three Indian soldiers were injured during the war.

 The Unifil citation commends a total of 21 officers, eight junior commissioned officers and 44 other ranks from the 4 Sikh battalion group for their extraordinary performance. 

 The battalion group is now engaged in clearing unexploded ordnance from Israeli cluster bombs and distributing water to the victims of the war.

 The Indian posts on the 121-km Blue Line were situated upfront and in depth. Through the 33-day war, the Indian officers and soldiers observed and recorded battle manoeuvres of Israel and the Hizbollah. 

 The Indian battalion group was part of the original 1,900-strong contingent that is now being reinforced. The other major battalion in Unifil is from Ghana. 

 The Indbatt (Indian battalion) sector saw the heaviest fighting during the war, with the Israelis making repeated incursions into southern Lebanon led by Merkava tanks and the Hizbollah firing at the Israelis from locations close to Unifil positions and risking the lives of the peacekeepers. There was no peace to keep.

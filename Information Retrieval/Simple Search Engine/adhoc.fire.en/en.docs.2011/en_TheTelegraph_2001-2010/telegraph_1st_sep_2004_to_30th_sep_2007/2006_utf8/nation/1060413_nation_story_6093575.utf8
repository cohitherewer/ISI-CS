 Minority panel piles Aligarh heat

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 12: Close on the heels of the CPMs demand for a high-level judicial inquiry into the communal violence in Aligarh, the National Commission for Minorities has turned the heat on the Uttar Pradesh government for failing to take any preventive measures despite clear signs of tension in the city.

 A 20-page probe report submitted to the commissions chairman, Mohammad Hamid Ansari, says all the 20 people admitted to hospital after the clashes had suffered gunshot wounds from police firing, sources said.

 Of the seven persons dead, five were killed in police firing, the report said. 

 The investigation found that the Uttar Pradesh administration did not take any steps to prevent the violence, which broke out after members of a particular community decorated a makeshift temple near a mosque on Ramnavami.

 The first signs of tension were visible on April 5, a day before the clashes, when red flags were strung up at the site.

 But the administration took no immediate measures to prevent the simmering tension from exploding into full-fledged violence, the sources said.

 The CPM had yesterday expressed concern over the deteriorating law and order in the state and demanded a judicial inquiry into the role of the police during the clashes.

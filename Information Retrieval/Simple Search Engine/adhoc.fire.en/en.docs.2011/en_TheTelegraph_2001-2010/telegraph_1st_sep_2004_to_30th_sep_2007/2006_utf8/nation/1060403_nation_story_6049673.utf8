 Witnesses cant switch sides, rules SC

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 Zahira, whose numerous flip-flops earned her the courts wrath

 New Delhi, April 2: The Supreme Court has ordered perjury proceedings against two witnesses in a murder case who first testified for the prosecution but later switched to depose in defence of the accused.

 A bench headed by Justice H.K. Sema, while ordering the perjury proceedings against Mohammad Amin and Zakir Ali, noted that a prosecution witness could not be recalled as a defence witness later.

 Like Amin and Zakir, Best Bakery key witness Zahira Sheikh is fighting perjury charges. She has been slapped a years prison term for contempt of court over her flip-flops. 

 The ruling coincides with a raging debate on how to tackle witnesses who turn hostile ? an issue that came to the fore after the blanket acquittals in the Jessica Lal murder case.

 Amin and Zakir had deposed before a magistrate as eyewitnesses to a September 1989 murder. But later, they filed affidavits stating that they had deposed under police pressure and they had not been present at the scene of crime. 

 Although the trial court refused to recall them for re-examination under Section 311 of the CrPC, it allowed an application by the accused under Section 233 seeking to examine the duo as defence witnesses.

 Criticising this move, the Supreme Court said: When such frivolous and vexatious petitions are filed, a judge is not powerless.

 He should have used his discretionary power to turn down the plea on the ground that it was made for the purpose of delaying justice.

 The apex court also set aside the Madhya Pradesh High Court verdict acquitting the murder accused on the basis of statements by Amin and Zakir as defence witnesses. The high court had allowed an appeal by the accused against the trial court conviction on the basis of the duos statements as prosecution witnesses in December 1990. The lower court had ignored their testimonies as defence witnesses in February 1995.

 But the Supreme Court has said the high court was not right in reversing the conviction and has restored the life imprisonment awarded by the trial court. Once a witness is examined as a prosecution witness, he cannot be allowed to perjure himself by resiling from the testimony given in court under oath, the apex court said.

 The apex court also said that the statement in favour of the accused in 1995 seemed concocted as the defence had subjected the two witnesses ? a brother and friend of the deceased ? to a lengthy cross-examination but nothing in their new statement could discredit their testimonies in December 1990.

 No reasonable person, properly instructed in law, would have acted upon such statements, the apex court said.

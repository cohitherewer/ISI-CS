 Rabri report versus Nitish Bihar verdict

 Patna, Nov. 24: That Ram Vilas Paswan doesnt belong to the RJD is not the only reason why chief minister Nitish Kumar is impressed with him. He is fairly convinced of the Dalit leaders commitment to Bihars cause.

 Paswanji promised necessary help on the scarcity of fertilisers in Bihar when I recently met him in Delhi. I do not expect this from the Union ministers who belong to the Rashtriya Janata Dal. They are deep into politicking, whatever the cost, Nitish said at a function today to release a report card on his governments first year in office.

 It was no surprise that leader of Opposition Rabri Devi made a frontal attack on his government a few hours before the official function, with railway minister Lalu Prasad peppering her charges of dismal failure with his own details on the sidelines of the RJD show at 10 Circular Road.

 Rabri Devi in a document called Sushasan ka pol, Janata ka report (Good governance exposed, courtesy peoples report) did not spare any sector of governance her accusation of total failure.

 Nitish was not worried too much. He called the RJDs charges a bundle of lies and his own report card was presented as Development with Justice A One Year Journey.

 The official document was a sector-wise summary of all that the government has done in a year, though the chief minister did offer tidbits to keep the media interest simmering. 

 The Bihar Development and Investment Council, headed by the chief minister, will soon be set up. A Bihar Foundation for continuous interaction with the states diaspora is also in the offing. The deputy chief minister will head it, Nitish announced.

 Rabri Devi wasnt impressed. She criticised the media for not supporting the Opposition. 

 You do not highlight the inaction of the present government. But people now know that Nitish is all hot air. This government-on-contract will not survive long, the former chief minister said as she awarded a poor zero to her successor.

 Where are the roads? There has been no appointment of doctors, engineers or teachers under the NDA regime. The government had to invite fresh bids from local contractors after it found no takers for its global tenders, said state RJD chief Abdul Bari Siddiqui.

 But Nitish projected the same appointments of 2.35 lakh schoolteachers, 10,457 Urdu teachers, more than 10,000 constables, 2,300 junior engineers and 1,500 assistant sub-inspectors as achievements, though he admitted that some of the recruitments were still in the pipeline.

 The last word, perhaps, went to Nitish. We face an examination every day and people are our supreme examiner. As for the Opposition, it should come up with a report card on its own role, the chief minister said.

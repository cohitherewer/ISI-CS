 Left to protest in black amp; white

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 26: The Left is planning to raise the pitch of its protests against the UPA governments policy of divesting in profit-making public sector undertakings and its failure to control price rise.

 The parties are planning to write to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Congress president Sonia Gandhi to register their protest at being ignored. The CPIs central secretariat met today and decided to convey its protest in writing. The other Left parties will do the same.

 The Left, given its political compulsions of keeping the UPA government in power, has made petitioning the government one of its main strategies. The parties exchange with the government a series of notes and counter-notes on controversial issues such as the pension bill and 10 per cent divestment in Bhel.

 The Left parties feel let down even though the government has yielded on several occasions. It backtracked on the Bhel divestment and temporarily shelved the pension bill. But this is not enough for the Left. They (the government) are going ahead with their policies as if to heap scorn on us, said CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhan.

 The latest provocation has come with the governments decision to divest 10 per cent shares of Nalco ? a non-navratna profit-making PSU. The Left says the move has set the stage for protests throughout the country.

 In Orissa, where Nalcos plant is located, right from the state government to the trade union ? everybody is up in arms, said a Left leader. In Tamil Nadu, UPA partners DMK and the PMK are protesting, he added, referring to the proposed divestment in Neyveli Lignite Corporation. The Left trade unions are planning strikes and protests.

 On August 1, bank unions will strike work for a day to protest against the governments move to privatise banking operations. They are outsourcing banking operations to private agencies, said a Left leader. They are privatising banks through the backdoor.

 The government is planning to bring in the Pension Fund Regulatory Development Authority Bill during the monsoon session of Parliament beginning from July 24.

 While the trade unions are opposed to the bill, the Left parties have said they will consider it if the government heeds the amendments suggested by them. The amendments strike at the root of the bill, which is aimed at handing over the monitoring of the pension fund to a private agency.

 The Congress is pursuing its own agenda through a give-and-take policy. On one hand, it is giving in to the Left on issues like the Bhel divestment and the bill on tribals. On the other, it is pushing through some of its own policies ? on economic reforms ? even in the teeth of the Lefts protests.

 Just before the decision on Nalco, the government had raised petrol and diesel prices despite protests by the Left, which had hoped to get the government to reverse its stand and roll back the hike. The government refused to bend. Even as the Left was licking its wounds, the government struck once more with the decision to divest in Nalco.

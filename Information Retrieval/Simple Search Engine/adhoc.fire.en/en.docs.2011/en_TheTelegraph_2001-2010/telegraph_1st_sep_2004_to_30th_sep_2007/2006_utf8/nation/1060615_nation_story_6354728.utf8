 Hospital workers thrashed for neglect

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Behrampore, June 14: A mob beat up three employees of the general hospital in this Bengal town today after an 18-year-old who was hit by a bus died following a 40-minute wait for a surgeon.

 Relatives and friends of Rabiul Mia were joined by a group of local people in picking and punching ward master Someswar Mondal and group-D employees Gopal Mondal and Sanjoy Halder. 

 Someswar was admitted to the same hospital in the Murshidabad district town, 200 km from Calcutta, with injuries in his ears and neck. The others were released after first aid. 

 Thirteen people were arrested following a complaint lodged by hospital deputy superintendent Ananda Mondal.

 On Monday, a mob attacked Anadi Rajwar, the assistant superintendent of an ESI Hospital in Chandernagore, about 40 km from Calcutta, because another doctor did not allegedly attend to a patient, who died. Rajwar, who was taken to a Calcutta hospital in a critical state, is better now. 

 Obaidur Rahaman, the surgeon supposed to see Rabiul, said he stays 5 km away from the hospital and was late because the vehicle that goes to fetch him arrived late. 

 Rabiul, who passed HS this year, was going to a college to collect an admission form, when the bus hit him. His elder brother Asadul said: We repeatedly requested Dr Padmanava Swarnakar, who was in the emergency, to attend to my brother. He didnt. He told us that the surgeon was coming. He did not.

 Swarnakar said he had done his bit by providing the initial treatment. I gave a call to the surgeon and then went to the indoor department.

 Rajnath spits fire at PM

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 2: BJP president Rajnath Singh today attacked Prime Minister Manmohan Singh for his admission that Sonia Gandhi was the second power centre in the government. 

 Weve never had a PM like Dr Manmohan Singh. He is openly admitting that Sonia Gandhi wields immense influence on the government. It is shameful. He has lowered the dignity of the PMO, he said. 

 We pity the PMs helplessness, he added. He is writing letters to his ministers urging them not to announce policy decisions without consulting him. On top of it, he has to deal with constant interference from his party chief.

 While Rajnath targeted the Prime Minister for allowing two power centres, he was asked about the RSS influence on his party. He denied any such influence and, when pressed for comments on the way his predecessor L.K. Advani was forced to step down, said it had nothing to do with M.A. Jinnah. Advaniji had announced his decision to resign long back, he mumbled. The BJP has no two power centres.

 Advani had angered the Sangh by praising Pakistans founder during a trip to that country.

 Rajnath also denied reports that the Sangh now wanted Advani and Jaswant Singh removed as leaders of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha. Advaniji is and would remain the leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha. Same goes for Jaswant Singhji in the Rajya Sabha, he said.

 The BJP refused to confirm whether Advani would be the partys prime ministerial candidate in the next Lok Sabha elections.

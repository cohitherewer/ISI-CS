 Sexual harassment glare on army duo

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 17: A colonel and a major of the army have been relieved of their responsibilities in an air defence unit and attached for inquiry after a lady officer brought sexual harassment charges against them.

 The woman, a lieutenant, complained to superior officers in March this year against the colonel, who was her commanding officer, and the major posted at an establishment near Chandigarh. Army headquarters sources in New Delhi said a preliminary inquiry has recommended that the charges should be investigated.

 The lady has also been posted to a separate unit for the investigation. Army headquarters were awaiting a report from a senior officer who was put in charge of the investigation. Based on the report, a decision on whether there should be a court martial against the colonel and major or some other action has to be taken will be made.

 The officers involved in the case were posted at an establishment of the armys 96 Infantry Brigade.

 In February this year, the chief of the Indian Air Force diluted a harsh sentence of a court martial against a lady officer and ordered that her punishment be converted from cashiering to dismissal. 

 Anjali Gupta was dismissed from the Indian Air Force after a court martial found her guilty of charges such as pilferage and insubordination. However, she has gone to civil courts alleging that she was harassed and that she was victimised for blowing the whistle on corrupt deals.

 Cashiering would have meant going through an elaborate ritual involving stripping her of rank by tearing off her epaulettes, denial of privileges and monetary benefits, destruction of the uniform and literally slamming the doors of the IAF establishment she last served in after ejecting her from the premises.

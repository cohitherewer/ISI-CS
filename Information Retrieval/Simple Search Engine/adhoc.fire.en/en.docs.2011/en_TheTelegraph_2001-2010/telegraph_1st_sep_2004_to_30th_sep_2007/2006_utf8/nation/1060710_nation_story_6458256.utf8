 HC can order re-inquiry 

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 9: The Supreme Court has held that high courts can exercise their inherent powers to direct further investigation or pass any other order while hearing an appeal.

 Nothing bars high courts from using their extraordinary inherent jurisdiction while exercising other jurisdictions, an apex bench said while hearing an appeal against a Madras High Court order.

 Even if there was no such application, high courts could act on their own to further the interest of justice.

 Justice S.B. Sinha said inherent jurisdiction was not trammelled by procedural restrictions and could be exercised irrespective of the nature of the proceedings.

 The Criminal Procedure Code provides for a corrective mechanism to check miscarriage of justice at each stage ? investigation, trial, appeal and revision ? of proceedings, the bench said. 

 It also empowers the courts to direct investigation in cognisable cases, allows a magistrate to postpone issue of process and inquire into the case himself and permits a court to reject a chargesheet and take cognisance of the offence on the basis of the material on record.

 The CrPC permits a sessions court to proceed against a person in a case if the magistrate commits an error in not naming him as an accused and empowers a superior court to order further inquiry even during the pendency of the case, exercising its revisional jurisdiction, the bench added.

 High courts can exercise the power to deal with situations on which the law is silent, the apex court said. It can, thus, do real and substantial justice for which it alone exists.

 However, they should not interfere with the statutory power of police to investigate an offence. 

 Allowing the appeal against the Madras High Court order, the apex court said high courts could not issue directives to investigate a case from a particular angle.

 The high court, while upholding the conviction of a person in a murder case, had directed prosecution of two others and asked the investigating agency to reconsider the materials on record to connect them to the crime.

 The apex court set aside the order, noting that neither the state nor the complainant had sought inclusion of their names and that the high court had directed their prosecution 10 years after the murder.

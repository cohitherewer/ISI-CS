 Varsity seat hike damper

 New Delhi, May 22 (PTI): With the Centre mulling an increase in the number of seats in educational institutions in the wake of the anti-quota agitation, Delhi University today said such a step was not possible under the existing infrastructure and teacher-student ratio.

 At the moment we have 1.1 to 1.2 lakh students in all our colleges. Given the norms of teacher-pupil ratio and infrastructure, it is not possible to increase the number of seats, DU vice-chancellor Deepak Pental told a news conference.

 But if the seats are increased without commensurate facilities and teachers, it will lead to degradation of quality of education, he said.

 Pental said: If we enhance the infrastructure and go in for recruiting more teachers, it will take another two to three years to increase the seats. 

 He added that the varsity was yet to receive any instruction from the government to increase seats. 

 Earlier, the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, had rejected the proposal to increase the number of seats, saying its plate was full.

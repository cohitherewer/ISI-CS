 Funds for schools, women

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 28: Education, health, rural development and gender issues are priority areas for both Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi, and this was reflected in the budget.

 Allocation of funds for Sarva Siksha Abhiyan, a programme for universalisation of elementary education, has gone up from Rs 7,156 crore to Rs 10,041 crore. 

 Funds for the midday meal scheme, the largest school lunch programme in the world, are up from Rs 3,010 crore to Rs 4,813 crore. The government will also transfer Rs 8,746 crore to the Prarambhik Siksha Kosh, set up for primary education. 

 Allocations to the department of drinking water ? part of the rural development ministry ? have gone up from Rs 4,750 crore to Rs 6,000 crore. The department of rural development is richer by an additional Rs 6,000 crore. 

 Gender budgeting, introduced by the UPA government in 2005, was one of the thrust areas this time. It aims to bring gender equality in the allocation of public funds by identifying areas of importance for women. 

 This years budget widens the ambit of gender budgeting, which will now apply to all departments dealing with women and children. These departments are located in different ministries, such as health and family welfare, home affairs, non-conventional energy sources, science and technology, small-scale industries, agriculture and information and technology. 

 The allocation for gender budgeting has gone up from Rs 24,032 crore to Rs 28,736 crore. 

 Gender budgeting was so far applicable to 10 ministries, which were mandated to set up separate cells. But most did not, and the concept of women-specific allocations remained on paper.

 National Commission for Women (NCW) chairperson Girja Vyas believes this will improve now. 

 Last year was the first time that the concept was introduced. We have now demanded there should be state-level auditing of the budget and the NCW will review it every three months, said Vyas.

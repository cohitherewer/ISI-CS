 Mulford missive fire

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Feb. 10: The CPM today reiterated its demand for the recall of US ambassador David C. Mulford in the wake of his letter to Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.

 At the end of the two-day politburo meeting today, party general secretary Prakash Karat said it was unbecoming of a countrys ambassador to write to a chief minister. 

 I learnt about this after coming to Calcutta. The US ambassador is not behaving like an ambassador. I am told that Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has written a letter to the Prime Minister, strongly protesting Mulfords move. 

 He has no business writing directly to a chief minister. This only confirms our demand that the US ambassador should be recalled. He should not be here, Karat said.

 Bhattacharjee had allegedly described US President George W. Bush as the leader of an organised pack of killers, which prompted Mulford to write to the chief minister. 

 The envoy is learnt to have mentioned in his letter that Bengal is being seen as an investment destination and the chief ministers comments may harm his states prospects. 

 The CPM, which had earlier pressed for Mulfords recall after his criticism of the Left for opposing foreign direct investment in retail, plans to stage demonstrations during Bushs visit to India. 

 The party, which supports the UPA government from outside, is also unhappy about reports that the US President may be asked to address a joint session of Parliament.

 Karat said his party was waiting for Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to take action. 

 The Prime Ministers media adviser, however, said: I have nothing to say. I do not know if such a letter was received by the PM.

 A few days ago, Bengal CPM secretary Anil Biswas had said Singh should summon Mulford and restrain him from commenting on Indias internal matters.

 Babu versus jawan

 SUJAN DUTTA

 Air Chief Marshal Tyagi

 New Delhi, Nov. 13: Air Chief Marshal S.P. Tyagi today stoked a babu-versus-jawan debate at an international meet of arms transfer experts hosted by the defence ministry and advised bureaucrats who frame Indian policies to think like soldiers.

 The air chief admitted he was not adept at economics but was qualified as a military leader. But he wondered if there was a national vision that shaped allocations for military requirements.

 All I know, he said referring to former defence financial adviser A.K. Ghosh who was chairing a session and who spoke before him, is that when the government decides to build a house for you, it is planned expenditure but when it has to build a house for the air chief, it is non-plan expenditure.

 Tyagis observation on plan and non-plan funds barely masked the services distaste for repeated advisories from the government to cut down non-plan (revenue) expenditure. Revenue expenditure is more than 50 per cent of defence allocations. 

 The services say these are necessary because not only do they have to meet the rising costs of manpower but also the maintenance costs of the hardware.

 Tyagi, who is also the senior-most of the service chiefs and the chairman, chiefs of staff committee, premised his argument on the belief that Indias economic boom was not sustainable without guarantees of security that the military alone can provide.

 As the Indian economy grows, he said, Indian defence forces will have to look at providing security to energy sources, at giving security beyond borders not necessarily through war but at economic security.

 The babu-versus-jawan debate is a constant one in the Indian defence establishment but rarely does it spill out into the public realm. 

 The armed forces doubt if the bureaucrats who draw up plans and allocate funds have adequate knowledge of military affairs. Likewise, bureaucrats believe the soldiers understand little beyond sighting a target and shooting from the hip.

 Modi fishes in riot relief waters 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Narendra Modi

 Ahmedabad, Nov. 27: Narendra Modi today chose a religious gathering to attack the Centres decision to give Rs 7 lakh to each victim of the 2002 Gujarat riots, demanding the same compensation for those killed in the terrorist strike on Akshardham temple.

 Speaking at a congregation of the Swaminarayan sect in Anand district, the chief minister said the move had exposed the double standards of the Congress-led UPA government.

 The Centre had said that nearly 5,000 victims of the 2002 riots would get the same amount given to victims of the 1984 anti-Sikh riots. 

 Modi said: The intention behind (the) announcement of compensation for only (the) Gujarat riot victims seems malafide.

 If the Prime minister really has compassion for riot victims, he should extend this compensation to victims of all riots in the country since the anti-Sikh riots. Why are those people excluded from such benefits?

 The Prime Minister, Modi alleged, seems to have different yardsticks for viewing the deaths of people killed in riots in different parts.

 About a dozen people were killed in the attack on Akshardham temple in Gandhinagar in September 2002, months after the riots.

 Modi said the families of the temple victims should also be given the same amount: Rs 7 lakh.

 The UPA government was accused of trying to appease minorities. The Centre, he said, should first release a list of the riot victims because its figures were vastly different from the state governments.

 With the Assembly elections due in 2007, Delhis decision to compensate the riot victims was sure to become an issue and Modi, whose government had earlier been accused of being soft on the rioters, wasted no time in giving it a Hindutva twist.

 The Gujarat Congress leadership was clearly caught unawares. Modi has virtually pushed them to a corner, forcing them to take a stand on whether they want the Akshardham victims to be compensated.

 Congress leader Narhari Amin, who was also present at the congregation, criticised the chief minister in his speech for using a non-political stage for raking up a political controversy. He was hooted by the audience.

 Congress spokesman Shaktisinh Gohil later said: We condemn Modi for using a religious platform for making political statements.

 The chief minister should have called a political meeting and raised the issue, he added.

 The programme in Anand was supposed to be for world peace.

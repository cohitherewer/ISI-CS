 Yasin bent on voice for Valley

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 17: Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF) chief Yasin Malik today reiterated his demand to include Kashmiris in the peace process during his meeting with the Prime Minister. 

 Drawing a distinction between the dialogue and the consultation process, he said: I told the Prime Minister of India that the dialogue process is going on between India and Pakistan, whereas we, the Kashmiris, are being included only in a consultative process. It is only a photo opportunity and Kashmiris do not want it. 

 I handed him the video footage of signatures of 15 lakh Kashmiris along with their names and addresses who support the Indo-Pak peace and dialogue process but want to be included in it. Kashmiris are not optimistic about the ongoing peace process, he said after his one-hour meeting with Manmohan Singh.

 Malik said he had told Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf the same thing.

 He cited the Centres dialogue with the NSCN-IM in a third country while stressing that for a logical conclusion to the Kashmir peace process, the militant leadership should be included. 

 But Malik did not say if he would come for the round table conference on Kashmir in Delhi, put off to February 25 because of the rail budget. 

 PMO spokesperson Sanjaya Baru refused any direct comment. He (Singh) told Malik to have his assurance that the government has an open mind and wants to involve as large a section of public opinion in the dialogue, he said.

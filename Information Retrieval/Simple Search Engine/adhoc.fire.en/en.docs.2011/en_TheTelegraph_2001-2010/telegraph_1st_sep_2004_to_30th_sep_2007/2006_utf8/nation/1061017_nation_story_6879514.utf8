 New Delhi, Oct.16: Two 

 men carrying explosives enough to lift a packed bus 10 feet 

 in the air were arrested by Delhi police today in an early-morning 

 operation.

 The police claimed the men hail from Bangladesh and intended to plant bombs at religious sites, and other crowded and sensitive places in the capital, in an attempt to recreate the havoc of last years blasts on the eve of Diwali and Id.

 The two, identified as Mohammed Aslam Gir and Abdul Razzaq, belong to Lashkar-e-Toiba, the police said.

 Gir and Razzaq were apprehended at old Delhi railway station when they got off the Pooja Express from Jammu around 5 in the morning.

 The police said the duo was carrying 1.5 kg of pure RDX and road maps of Delhi, with entry and exit routes from the capital marked out.

 They were carrying identification cards that confirmed that they were from Rajshahi in Bangladesh, said deputy commissioner of police (special cell) Alok Kumar, adding that the arrests were made on a tip-off.

 Asked why the men had to carry identification, the police said they probably needed the identification cards for their local support to be able to identify them.

 Ballistics experts said 1.5 kg of RDX, if used in a bomb on a bus packed with passengers, could destroy the bus beyond recognition.

 The fact that the RDX recovered was pure makes it even more dangerous. Closely packed in a bomb, 1.5 kg would send a bus fully loaded with passengers at least 10 feet in the air, an expert at the Terminal Ballistic Research Laboratory said.

 More than 10 bombs of the kind that rocked the capital last year could have been made with 1.5 kg, he said. 

 The exact impact would, however, depend on whether the terrorists planned to use the RDX in its pure form or build many bombs of lower intensity by mixing other material, said Amol Sharma of the laboratory.

 Sharma clarified that in public places like markets, the extent of the crowd would determine the distance till which the impact of the explosions would be felt.

 This was to be a repeat of last years pre-Diwali blasts but intended to cause greater casualties and more tension, said DCP Kumar.

 Fifty-six people had died and nearly 200 were injured in three blasts on October 29 last year.

 The target this time was unlikely to be market-places, the police said. Our information suggests this time the attacks are more likely at religious places such as temples and mosques, Kumar said.

 Cell phone bill to mention credit limit

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 7: From now on, your mobile service provider must spell out the credit limit on your monthly mobile bill.

 The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) today made this mandatory for mobile companies after receiving complaints from post-paid subscribers about sudden disconnection or barring of calls when the bill they ran up crossed the credit limit decided by the operators.

 Earlier, on June 27 last year, the telecom regulator had asked service providers to disconnect a post-paid subscriber only after the bill he ran up crossed the fixed credit limit ? and that, too, only after warning him in advance.

 Services to the subscriber shall not be disrupted until and unless the credit limit fixed for a subscriber has (been) exceeded despite adequate intimation about the same, Trai had said.

 The mobile companies were told that when the bill reaches 80 per cent of the limit, they should inform the subscriber about the consequences of exceeding the limit, including the possibility of disconnection.

 New subscribers must be informed about the limit within seven days of the service being provided to them.

 Subscriber high

 The countrys mobile subscriber base crossed 10 crore in May with that of GSM-based cellular operators touching 7.53 crore and that of CDMA-based companies, 2.53 crore. While the first group added 32 lakh subscribers, the second signed up about 11 lakh, making for 43 lakh new mobile users.

 The CDMA-based Reliance added 5.21 lakh subscribers during the month, taking its mobile user base to 1.93 crore. The Tatas, with 5.79 lakh new users, touched a total customer base of 59.02 lakh.

 GSM-based Bharti remained at the top with a subscriber base of 2.18 crore, boosted by 11 lakh new users. The state-run BSNL came second with 1.8 crore users and Hutch third with 1.67 crore.

 Idea cellular took its user base to 80 lakh while Reliance, which has a minor presence in the GSM market, tallied 21.6 lakh.

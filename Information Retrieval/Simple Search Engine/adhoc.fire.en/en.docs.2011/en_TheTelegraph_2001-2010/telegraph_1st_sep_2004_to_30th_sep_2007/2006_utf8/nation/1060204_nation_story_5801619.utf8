 Sukhoi deal

 Moscow, Feb. 3 (PTI): Belarus is going to seal an estimated $300-million deal with India for 18 second-hand Sukhoi Su-30K fighters to modernise its air force.

 According to the financial daily Vedomosti, the fighters with limited capabilities were supplied to the Indian Air Force in 1997-98 at the initial stage of the $4.9-billion Sukhoi deal for the development of a multi-role Su-30 MKI, tailored for its specific requirements.

 The cash-strapped former Soviet republic would modernise the Su-30K jets to the Su-30KN at its facilities with the help of Russkaya Avionika (Russian Avionics), a subsidiary of the original manufacturer, Irkut Corporation.

 Sources in the aviation industry and the Russian Air Force have confirmed the report, said the daily.

 Belarus is likely to field the jets against F-16s received by neighbour Poland after joining the Nato, the sources said.

 Under the deal for the supply of 50 Su-30 multi-role fighters, Russia had initially supplied 18 fighters with limited capabilities, which were mainly used by the IAF as air defence platforms and were to be flown to Russia for upgradation to the MKI standard, capable of using sophisticated weapons against land and sea targets. In 2004, Irkut had completed the delivery of remaining 32 Su-30MKI fighters.

 Licensed production of 140 fighters has commenced at Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (Hal) in Bangalore.

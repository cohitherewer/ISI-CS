 Cops hunt for mall suspect

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Chandigarh, April 16: Police teams have fanned out in Chandigarh, Punjab, Haryana and Himachal Pradesh in search of Ashok Rajput, accused of pushing 22-year-old Sonish Javed to her death from the third floor of a Gurgaon mall late on Friday night.

 A murder case has been registered against Rajput, who owns pubs in Delhi and Gurgaon and is said to be politically well-connected, following a complaint by Sonishs parents. 

 The 22-year-old worked as marketing manager for Rajput and had organised several events at his pubs. 

 Sonishs viscera has been sent to the forensic laboratory at Madhuban for examination, said Baljit Singh, SHO of the DLF police station.

 Shaina, her mother, has claimed that minutes before the incident, Sonish had called up to say she would be back by 4 am, after discussing some money matter with Rajput. 

 Shaina as well as Kamran, Sonishs brother, have alleged that before she breathed her last in the hospital, Sonish uttered Rajputs name a number of times. 

 A police officer, part of the team probing the case, said: Sonishs mother has accused Rajput of killing her daughter as he did not want to part with the money he owed her. This was not the first time that the matter had led to heated arguments between the two.

 Moreover, she could not have fallen on her back had she not been pushed from the railing. If she had jumped on her own, she would have fallen face down.

 Gurgaon police sources said just days before her death, Sonish had gone to Mumbai on work. She came back on Friday evening and met Rajput at Addiction restaurant along with a friend, Gurung. Differences over money that Rajput owed her led to a squabble. 

 According to the police, as a party was going on when the incident occurred, many were present at the restaurant. 

 We have questioned some of those present at the pub and are on the lookout for others who may provide us with some vital clues, said a police officer.

 Gurdeep Singh, owner of Addiction, has been arrested and booked for serving drinks beyond the stipulated time.

 At the moment, we are working on the statements provided to us by the family members, guards and security staff of the mall, the police officer said.

 The police have ruled out sexual assault after the postmortem. There were no signs on the body that can point to a sexual assault, the officer said.

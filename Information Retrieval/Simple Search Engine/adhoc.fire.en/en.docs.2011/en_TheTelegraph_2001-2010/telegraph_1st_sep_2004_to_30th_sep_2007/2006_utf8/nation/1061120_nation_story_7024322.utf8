 Surrender scandal

 MUZAFFAR RAINA

 Srinagar, Nov. 19: Two former soldiers who allegedly asked four Kashmiri youths to fake a surrender with the promise of jobs and money were booked by Jammu and Kashmir police today for luring them into militancy.

 Last week, Altaf Ahmad Akhoon, Nadeem Bhat, Waseem Akhoon and Bashir Ahmed Mir had alleged that the former soldiers and some 14 Rajput regiment personnel lured them to stage the surrender before media crews in lieu of a government job and Rs 2 lakh each. 

 Baramulla police chief Viplaw Kumar today said an FIR has been lodged against Qadeer Khan and Ashiq Hussain for enticing the youths to join militancy. Qadeer and Ashiq, who used to work for the 161 Territorial Army Battalion, are in police custody while the youths have been freed.

 The army, the police and the youths have, however, given different versions of the story. 

 Kumar said the FIR is based on the complaint lodged by the youths. 

 Defence spokesman Lt Col A.K. Mathur said Qadeer and Ashiq had brought the youths to Captain A.K. Singh of the Rajput regiment. We were told by the two that some militants from (the) Hizb-ul Mujahideen want to surrender and to avail the surrender policy. We were naturally happy. When the captain took them to the commanding officer of the unit, they were questioned and it was found that they were not militants. They were trying to hoodwink the army and we handed them over to police.

 Mathur asserted that no army official was involved in the episode. 

 Altaf, 19, one of the youths allegedly lured into the trap, said: They (Qadeer and Ashiq) told us that we should accompany them to the army camp at Chahal (in Baramulla) and that we will be given jobs and money and we agreed. On November 7, they took us to the army captain, who again promised job and money. But we were not told what we have to do. 

 The teenager from Khanpora said they returned home that day and again accompanied the duo to the captain. This time, we were told that we have to lay down arms before the media. We refused but they threatened to kill us. Ashiq told the commanding officer that we are Hizb men and want to surrender. We remained silent, but later mustered courage to tell the truth. We were handed over to the police, Altaf added.

 The youths rebutted the polices claim that they were lured to join the ranks of militants.

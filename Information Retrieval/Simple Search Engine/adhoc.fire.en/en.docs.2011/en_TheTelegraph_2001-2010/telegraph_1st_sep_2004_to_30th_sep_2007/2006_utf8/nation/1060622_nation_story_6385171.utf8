 Airport proposal to Reliance

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, June 21: Bengal transport minister Subhas Chakraborty today requested Mukesh Ambani to build a cargo airport on the outskirts of the city.

 The Reliance Industries chief has apparently said he would consider the proposal.

 After a 15-minute meeting with him at Writers Buildings, Chakraborty said: We have around 750 acres at the junction of Delhi Road and Bombay Road, only 15 kilometres from the Calcutta Maidan.

 Ambani, Chakraborty added, has sought a detailed proposal from the state transport department. 

 If he desires, we will invite Reliance Industries officials to see the site. It is very close to the proposed small-car factory of the Tatas at Singur as well as the Mahabharat motorcycle factory in Howrah, a transport department official said.

 Ambani has sought land from the transport minister at bus and tram terminals to build shopping arcades for Reliances retail chain.

 We have agreed to the proposal in principal. In return, they will beautify the area and improve the infrastructure, said Chakraborty. 

 Transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury said the department has 20 to 25 bus and tram depots in and around Calcutta, where Reliance may be given land.

 The Reliance boss also had a 10-minute meeting with tourism and cottage and small-scale industries minister Manab Mukherjee, who described it as a courtesy call.

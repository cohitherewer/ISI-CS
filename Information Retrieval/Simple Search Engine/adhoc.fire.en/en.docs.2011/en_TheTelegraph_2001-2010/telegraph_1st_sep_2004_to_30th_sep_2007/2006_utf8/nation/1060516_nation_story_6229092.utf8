 Promise of please-all reservation

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 15: The Centre tonight said it would shortly announce a mechanism that would take care of the interests of all social sections on reservation in education.

 The cabinet committee on political affairs (CCPA) ? the governments apex decision-making apparatus ? met under the chairmanship of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to discuss ways to contain the anti-reservation protests and find a political solution.

 However, the government and the Congress are divided on the issue.

 Defence minister Pranab Mukherjee told journalists after a 90-minute meeting: We will ensure a mechanism in which the interests of all sections of society are taken care of. The details are being worked out and it will shortly be announced.

 Mukherjee indicated that there would be no rethink on the sticking point of earmarking a quota for OBC students. You are aware that the Constitution has been amended to provide reservation to the other backward classes, he said.

 The Constitution was amended in December 2005 and the Centre will have to introduce an enabling law to allow government as well as private, unaided institutions to reserve seats for the OBCs. 

 Commenting on the spiralling protests, Mukherjee said: There is no intention to harm anybody. After all, they are our children. We do hope there will be no further agitation.

 Asked whether a committee or a commission would be set up, he replied in the negative and added: We will come out with an arrangement which will be satisfying to different sections.

 Government sources said the middle-ground mechanism, which was favoured by the Prime Minister and Sonia Gandhi, would be unveiled in the ongoing session of Parliament.

 At least four notices have been given by various parties seeking a discussion on quotas. After the CCPAs decision, the business advisory committees of the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha are expected to meet tomorrow to set a date and time for the discussion.

 Sources clarified that the mechanism was unlikely to take the form of legislation. At the most, it will come as a statement from the Prime Minister. Ministers have also been advised to stop speaking in contradictory voices.

 Though the Prime Minister and the Congress have been criticised for not speaking out yet, the broadest indication that neither was for drastic action came from a party spokesperson. Rajeev Shukla said it was a Congress government (under P.V. Narasimha Rao) that had implemented the Mandal Commissions proposals, a little over a year after V.P. Singh had adopted them.

 Judging by the reactions Arjun Singhs statements have provoked, we dont want to do anything that may seem extreme and politically motivated. The backward classes are not a homogenous grouping and they dont vote for a particular party. In sum, the Congress wont gain substantively. But if we oppose Arjun, we lose the support of the backward classes as a whole, a Congress leader said.

 Government sources said the Prime Minister might either call an all-party meeting this week or speak separately to the leaders to assess their mind and mood. He is also expected to meet the representatives of OBC organisations.

 A suggestion to increase the number of seats was rejected by a section of the government and the Congress, which felt it was too overt a sop for the quota opponents.

 Poll panel in Somnath line of fire

 Somnath: Speaking out

 New Delhi, May 24: Having maintained a studied silence through the office of profit controversy, his trial by insinuation had Somnath Chatterjee firing at the Election Commission today.

 The Lok Sabha Speaker, facing a disqualification petition for holding chairmanship of the Sriniketan-Santiniketan Development Authority, clarified that he was not imputing motives to anyone, but asserted that there was not an iota of a case against him.

 It is the character assassination of not an individual but of the office of the Speaker, Chatterjee said.

 I challenge anyone.... I am holding the post for the last 17 years. I will resign from all my positions if anyone shows there is an office of profit, he said, adding that a post without any perks and salary other than compensatory allowance is no office of profit.

 Chatterjee, whose name was put on the poll panels website following the disqualification petition, said: From March 8 till today, I have got no notice (from the EC). You give me a chance... (I am being held) guilty by trial of insinuation. The constitutional authority (EC) is permitting this insinuation to continue. This is not the way.

 The Speaker said if this is the way people in responsible positions are treated, no one would accept such positions in future.

 Chatterjee, however, brushed aside questions about impeachment of the chief election commissioner, saying: I am not challenging their authority. I have not said about any motives. I am giving my humble views.

 At the same time, he said the matter should have been handled with more circumspection.

 The Speaker rubbished suggestions that he was responsible for a confrontation between the treasury benches and the Opposition. He stressed that he had given a lot of scope to Opposition leaders to have their say, given the number of adjournment motions and other such instruments allowed by him.

 On the BJPs threat to bring a no-confidence motion against him, the Speaker said: I have nothing to say. It is their right. If they want to move it, they can move it.

 Chatterjee washed his hands off the controversy surrounding former secretary-general Subash C. Kashyap who was admonished by the Lok Sabha yesterday. He said he had no hand in the question of privilege raised against Kashyap.

 Jessica cops frowned at

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 19: Delhi High Court today expressed its displeasure over the police delay in submitting probe records in the Jessica Lal murder case.

 A division bench headed by acting Chief Justice Vijender Jain had on February 24 taken suo motu cognisance of the acquittals of the nine accused by the trial court, which cited shoddy investigation and lack of evidence.

 The high court had issued a notice to Delhi police commissioner K.K. Paul directing him to file a status report.

 Jessica, a model who was working as celebrity bartender at the Tamarind Court restaurant in Delhi, was shot dead on April 30, 1999, allegedly for refusing to serve drinks around 2 am. Manu Sharma, the prime accused and son of a Congress leader, was yesterday granted bail along with seven other accused.

 Delhi police standing counsel Mukta Gupta submitted the status report in a sealed cover in court today. The report contains statements of 34 witnesses, including police officials and celebrities, who were present at the party when the murder was committed and who have been questioned. 

 Statements made after the registration of a fresh FIR, following the acquittal of the accused by the lower court, are also included. The new FIR on tampering, destruction and manipulation of evidence during the investigation was filed in February at Mehrauli police station.

 Gupta submitted these documents in a sealed cover, along with crucial evidence in the form of the disclosure statement made by prime accused Siddharth Vashisht alias Manu Sharma in May 1999. She informed the court that the disclosure material, contained in a CD, was not considered by the trial judge.

 The court was unhappy that the status report was produced directly before it during the hearing and not filed in the registry, which would have allowed time for scrutiny of the files by the judges.

 It pointed out that the case had been converted into a public interest litigation after it took suo motu cognisance of the acquittals on February 24, 2006.

 CJI snub

 New Delhi, Jan. 17 (PTI): Chief Justice of India Y.K. Sabharwal has refused to meet the striking lawyers of the Delhi Bar Association. He said strikes earn the profession a bad name and requested the silent majority of lawyers who are against it to raise their voice.

 I am not going to meet you if you are on strike, the chief justice said while delivering the annual K.N. Katju memorial lecture on the role of the bar in a democracy here last evening.

 Sabharwal requested the silent majority of lawyers who are against any strike to raise their voice as it earns the profession a bad name.

 Courts can not be closed for the interest of the lawyers, who are agitating against the move to shift certain subordinate courts to the new complex at Rohini in west Delhi, he said.

 Who has bothered about the number of cases that are adjourned or cases which could not be decided due to absence of lawyers or about how many litigants have been forced to bear the increasing costs of pending cases?

 We have to ask consumers of justice as to what they expect of us. What we have given them in return, he added, reminding the lawyers that they are in a service-oriented profession.

 Recalling how lawyers had opposed the shifting of Delhi High Court from Rajpur Road in Old Delhi to the present building in New Delhi, Chief Justice Sabharwal said: It is human tendency. We dont like change.

 Former Chief Justice J.S. Verma, who presided over the programme, urged the civil society to speak up against lawyers strikes and warned that if they (lawyers) continued like this, their services could be brought under the consumer protection act.

 Chief Justice Sabharwal also released a book on eminent lawyer and former minister in Jawaharlal Nehrus cabinet K.N. Katju.

 The book, Experiments in Advocacy ? the life and times of Dr Kailash Nath Katju, has been edited by his grandsons, Col (retd) Valmiki Katju and Delhi High Court Chief Justice Markandey Katju, and Harish Bhalla, the founder secretary general of the Dr K.N. Katju Memorial Trust.

 Former law minister Ram Jethmalani and jurist Fali S. Nariman were also present.

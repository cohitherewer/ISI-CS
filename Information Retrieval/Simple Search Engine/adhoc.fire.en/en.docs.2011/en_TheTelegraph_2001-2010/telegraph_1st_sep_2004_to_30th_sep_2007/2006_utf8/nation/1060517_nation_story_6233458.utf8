 First steps to defence deal with America

 K.P. NAYAR

 Washington, May 16: Even as the Indo-US nuclear deal languishes in the US Congress, the military establishments of the two countries have gingerly initiated negotiations on a bilateral agreement which will set out the basis for future logistics support, supplies and services between Indian and American defence forces.

 The proposed agreement builds on a 10-year framework for Indo-US defence relations, signed between defence minister Pranab Mukherjee and US secretary of defence Donald Rumsfeld in June last year.

 It is being negotiated at a time when all three branches of Indias defence forces are seriously looking at purchasing American weaponry and other military equipment for the first time.

 The Indian militarys interest in US equipment is being matched by the enthusiasm of US companies engaged in defence production to compete for New Delhis very substantial defence procurement budget. The agreement is the result of the conclusions drawn from joint Indo-US military exercises, which have intensified in recent years covering advanced weaponry on both sides and from joint efforts to tackle natural calamities.

 The latter is expected to provide a stronger foundation than any possibility of joint military action by New Delhi and Washington for future cooperation between the defence establishments on both sides.

 The primary purpose of the new agreement is to increase the interoperability of the Indian and US defence forces with each other.

 In laymans language, it involves Indias soldiers, airmen and naval personnel becoming familiar and able to operate equipment used by their US counterparts. 

 At present, there is very little US equipment in Indias arsenal, but efforts have been initiated in recent years to train Indians at US military training facilities, especially on naval aircraft.

 This handicap in increasing bilateral military cooperation is not, however, one-sided.

 For the first time in the history of the US Air Force, Indo-American air exercises recently enabled US pilots to become familiar with Russian Su-30MKI planes used by the Indian Air Force. American pilots have also tangled with Indian Mirage 2000 fighters, Jaguars and MiG-21s during these exercises.

 Significantly, the proposed Indo-US logistics support agreement excludes from its purview any transfer of weapon systems, major end-user equipment and spare parts. But it includes transportation, including airlift, medical services, base operations support, communication equipment, port services and general purpose vehicles, all of which are important in any joint effort for disaster relief.

 Such a cautious approach reflects the lingering distrust on both sides towards each other on any deep military interaction with each other and the need to proceed slowly in this regard lest it ruffled political feathers in both New Delhi and Washington.

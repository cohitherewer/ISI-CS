 Lawyer amp; insurance sops to lure rebels

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Ranchi, April 20: Every extremist who surrenders in Jharkhand will now be free to hire a lawyer of his choice at government expense and also be extended a life-insurance cover of Rs 10 lakh. 

 The insurance scheme is designed to reassure extremists that they will not be killed in custody. Touting the sops as unique in the country, the government today held out carrots in buckets to entice extremists to surrender. 

 Does it mean that an extremist can now surrender and hire Ram Jethmalani to defend him, asked reporters. Yes, replied home secretary J.B. Tubid, the state government will bear all the expenses.

 Unveiling an innovative and ambitious surrender policy, the second such plan in the past five years, home minister Sudesh Mahto claimed that Jharkhand is the first state in the country to formulate such an attractive scheme. 

 The policy, however, is yet to be approved by the Cabinet, he indicated at a news briefing but announced that it would be implemented within a week. Also present at the meet was director-general of police V.D. Ram.

 If the announcement is implemented, every extremist who surrenders will not only receive a cash compensation of Rs 25,000, to be paid in two instalments, but will also be paid a stipend of Rs 2,000 per month for the next two years. 

 If the rebel surrenders with a firearm, the minister added, valuation will be done and the cost of the firearm, too, will be reimbursed. As a further incentive, all surrendered extremists will be kept together in the state capital and the cases pending against them will be consolidated and transferred to Ranchi. 

 Special fast-track courts will be constituted to expedite trials and a review committee will monitor their conduct and recommend reduction or remission of sentences. 

 The policy promises to allot an acre of land to the family of every surrendered extremist. The family, in addition, will be entitled to free housing, free education for children and free healthcare facilities. The government, the policy declares, will evolve a special mechanism to solve land disputes involving the families. Finally, if any member of the family is killed in retaliatory attacks, the state will offer a government job to one of the surviving members.

 The policy, Mahto claimed, is the result of consultations and deliberations which have been going on for the past several months.

 This is also the first time, he claimed, that a state government has offered collective inducement to villages.

 Villagers who successfully motivate extremists to surrender, the minister said, will be paid a cash reward of Rs 25,000. But villages which succeed in motivating a group of extremists to surrender will be offered development schemes worth Rs 25 lakh. In special cases, Mahto added, the projects will be offered to villages which induce a solitary but more important extremist leaders to surrender. 

 Hoping that the policy would induce extremists in large numbers to surrender, the minister informed that till now, 174 extremists have surrendered in the state. All of them, now scattered in various jails, will be brought to Ranchi and housed in the old prison recently vacated by inmates, who have moved into the new model jail. 

 The minister also offered financial assistance to NGOs for operating rehabilitation centres for the surrendered extremists.

 Officials hailed the policy as a radical departure from the past. It seeks to involve society at large and offers a more than fair deal to the extremists, they pointed out. But they also expressed their reservation over the implementation of the policy. There was the risk of brokers and politicians trying to take advantage and take the government for a ride. But the home minister allayed such fears by claiming that the sops will be given only after an endorsement and assessment by the special branch and the Intelligence Bureau.

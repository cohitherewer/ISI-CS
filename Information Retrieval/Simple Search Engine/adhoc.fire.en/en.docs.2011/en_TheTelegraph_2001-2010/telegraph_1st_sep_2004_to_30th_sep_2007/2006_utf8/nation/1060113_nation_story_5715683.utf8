 Salem: Confession twist

 Mumbai, Jan. 12: Abu Salem today stunned a courtroom by claiming that police beat him with a belt in custody and obtained his confession in the Pradeep Jain murder through third-degree torture.

 Tada judge P.V. Bavkar, however, rejected the dons plea to be taken out of police hands and remanded him in police custody till January 17.

 Salems lawyer Harjot Singh later said his client would challenge the Tada court order in Bombay High Court through a writ petition.

 From his chair, Salem told a packed courtroom that the torture by the polices anti-terrorist squad officers had been so bad that he had passed out during a particular session. He complained he was not allowed to meet his lawyers.

 Denying the claims, special public prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam described Salem as a cunning wolf. He reminded the court that the gangster had himself declared earlier, when the judge had asked him, that he hadnt been tortured.

 Nikam alleged that Salem had suddenly changed his stance because he had realised he had revealed a lot during the lie-detector and narco-analysis tests in Bangalore.

 Defence counsel Ashok Sarogi told the court that Salem was indeed tortured and had to be admitted to hospital for a day.

 Harjot later told reporters, We always knew about the torture, but we wanted Salem to say it before the court.

 Nikam added to the courtroom drama by saying the police had been tipped off that someone would try to record Salems torture claims in the courthouse itself. He urged the court not to allow Salem to be interviewed on the premises.

 The judge asked the police to shut the courtrooms doors and carry out a check.

 Extradited from Portugal in November, Salem is being tried for the 1993 Bombay blasts and the murders of builder Pradeep Jain and an actors secretary, Ajit Dewani.

 Raids? Ha, say drug peddlers

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 11: Abdur Rehman officially calls himself a lampshade businessman. Most of the clients at his Paharganj shop, though, seek the other wares he offers ? cocaine, heroin, hashish (charas), grass (marijuana), LSD, Ecstasy and the like.

 Rehman and other peddlers in Paharganj ? the nerve centre of Delhis drug trade ? earn anywhere between Rs 5,000 and Rs 10,000 a day. Their business, they say, will remain largely unaffected by the recent police raids on suspected drug pushers in the aftermath of the Rahul Mahajan scandal.

 Im not worried at all. The police have a job to do. Theyll catch some drug pushers but here in Paharganj, nothing significant will happen, Rehman says with a wink.

 Most major drug dealers in Paharganj, anyway, receive a tip-off a few hours before any police raid.

 We clear out all the stuff. Since most of the powder is packed in cartons, they are easily shifted to a safer place.

 The market for the most popular drugs, such as grass and hashish, he says, is so huge that police raids cannot even theoretically wipe out the business.

 Its simple economics. As long as there is so much demand, even if the police catch me, someone else will take my place.

 Rehman says he normally pushes his handcart, packed with drugs, past the police checkpost outside New Delhi railway station every day on his way to his shop.

 But the police have been quite vigilant since the Mahajan episode and some drug pushers have been arrested. So, in order to not take any chances, I have been taking a different route to Paharganj these past few days, he explains. But beyond that, there is nothing at all to worry.

 The optimism is shared by other drug dealers. Ramesh, who claims to have the purest heroin in Paharganj, feels the systematic police raids wont last much longer.

 In a few days, the police will have to take care of other issues. These raids only skim the surface of drug trafficking and trade in India.

 The dealers admit, though, that the Mahajan scandal had the immediate effect of reducing cocaine sale marginally.

 Most of our clients do not consume drugs themselves but buy for others. Many of the final consumers are first-timers. The media attention on cocaine has led to some scepticism, says Sahdev, a drug dealer doubling as a second-hand bookseller.

 But this will not last. In any case, people who are scared of trying cocaine buy acid (LSD) or Ecstasy instead. Our losses on this front are minimal.

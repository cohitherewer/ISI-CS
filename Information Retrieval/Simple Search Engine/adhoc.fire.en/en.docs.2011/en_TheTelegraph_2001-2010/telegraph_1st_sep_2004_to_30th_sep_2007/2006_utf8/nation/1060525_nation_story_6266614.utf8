 Water too dear, PVR in glare

 New Delhi, May 24 (PTI): The Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Commission has slammed entertainment major PVR Cinemas and Himalayan Packaged Mineral Water for charging a premium on the price of mineral water sold inside multiplexes.

 Castigating both the companies, commission chairman Justice B.K. Rathi termed the sale of water at a higher cost as an act of thwarting competition, misleading consumers and indulging in restrictive trade practices.

 The order came on a petition filed by one Mona Rajvanshi, who during a visit to the PVR Spice multiplex found that there was no provision for drinking water in the lounge and the only source was packaged water supplied by the mineral water company.

 She also found that PVR was charging an exorbitant price of Rs 25 for a 750 ml bottle. In the open market, the price of the same brand was Rs 18 for one litre and Rs 12 for 500 ml.

 In its reply to the commission, the mineral water company said the 750 ml mineral water is packed specially for cinema halls. The company has installed special machinery for the purpose. It would take sometime to recover the cost of machines and, therefore, the prices are high, it added. 

 Opposing the contention, Rajvanshis counsel argued that PVR and the mineral water company had bypassed the Delhi State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commissions ruling.

 Earlier, the redress commission had restrained cinema halls in Delhi from selling water at more than the MRP.

 It is not only unfair but a fraud on public, particularly when the same is sold in the lounge of a picture hall by creating a monopoly by restricting other sources of drinking water and to force the viewers to purchase a particular brand of water, Rajvanshis counsel pleaded.

 Agreeing with the argument, the commission observed: How and on what consideration it has been arranged to have only a packaging of 750 ml while the same manufacturer is packaging it in different sizes even below 750 ml and also above 750 ml.

 It also noticed that PVR was indulging in unfair trade practice by keeping only the branded water of a particular company and that too of only the costlier 750 ml version.

 The commission rejected the contentions of PVR and the mineral water company and directed them not to repeat the practice in future.

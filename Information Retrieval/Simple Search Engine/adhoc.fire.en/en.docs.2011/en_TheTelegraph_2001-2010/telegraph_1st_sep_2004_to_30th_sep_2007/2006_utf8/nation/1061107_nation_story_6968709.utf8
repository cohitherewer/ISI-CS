 Crores in logjam, princess penniless

 Hyderabad, Nov. 6: A former royal cried out in open court. A teenage princess sat beside her a step away from bursting into tears.

 We are living a life of penury in spite of being born into royal families. Please help us, the divorced Turkish wife of the Nizam, Manolya Onur, begged the two high court judges last week.

 Her 14-year-old daughter had just told reporters she was penniless in Turkey, where she lived with Manolya. I want to appeal before the court to at least release the funds towards my school fees, princess Niloufer II said.

 But the division bench threw out their plea to vacate the interim stay on the Rs 10-crore-odd divorce settlement granted by a city family court last June, and had Manolyas outburst expunged.

 On that day four months ago, a judge had asked the eighth Nizam, Mukkaram Jah, to immediately pay Niloufer the $28,000 (Rs 13 lakh) she owed her boarding school in dues. That payment, too, is stayed till the high court disposes of Jahs appeal against the settlement.

 Outside the court, where a curious crowd drawn by the royals glamour had been left stunned by her cry, Manolya described to reporters how difficult her fight against the Nizams lawyers, since their separation in 1995, has been.

 I have been fighting for the last 10 years for the one mistake I made in my life that of marrying him. He has a lot of clout. I cannot afford to stay in Hyderabad nor can I come here frequently, she said.

 Both princesses left for Mumbai last week on their way to London. Sadruddin Jhaveri, the former custodian of the Nizams estate, is helping the duo.

 The family court had allowed Manolya a mehr of $700,000 (Rs 3.2 crore) and a combined monthly maintenance and rent allowance of $15,000 (Rs 6.8 lakh), half of it going to Niloufer. Jah was also to repay the $300,000 (Rs 1.4 crore) he had borrowed from Manolya before the wedding.

 Finally, mother and daughter were to get Rs 4 crore from the sale of the Nizams famed jewel collection. The entire lot came with 6 per cent yearly interest, calculated from 1995.

 The high court said it would decide on the appeal soon.

 The same bench had earlier asked the Nizam to pay Niloufer a monthly allowance of $10,000 and asked him to deposit Rs 2 crore with it. But the allowance was in force only till the family court gave its verdict.

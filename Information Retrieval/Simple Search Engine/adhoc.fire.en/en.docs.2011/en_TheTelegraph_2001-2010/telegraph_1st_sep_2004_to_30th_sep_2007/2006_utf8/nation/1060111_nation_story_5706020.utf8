 Delhi widens Valley talks 

 MANAN KUMAR 

 Lone: Positive

 New Delhi, Jan. 10: The Centre today signalled a widening of the Kashmir dialogue by inviting Peoples Conference leader Sajjad Lone for talks with the Prime Minister on January 14.

 The meeting with Lone ? whose outfit is outside the Hurriyat and who has been critical of the Hurriyat leadership ? will be three days before a meeting of the foreign secretaries of India and Pakistan in New Delhi. It will also precede a second round of talks with Mirwaiz Umer Farooqs moderate Hurriyat faction.

 Lone described the invitation as positive. He said he would tell the Prime Minister that other parties and individuals needed to be invited, too, to make the Kashmiri participation more inclusive.

 The invitation to Lone indicates that Delhi might also call other separatist leaders from outside the Hurriyat, such as Shabir Shah and Yasin Malik, to the talks table.

 The Centres Kashmir experts do not think that by inviting Lone ? younger son of assassinated Hurriyat leader Abdul Gani Lone ? Delhi is being lukewarm to the moderate Hurriyat faction.

 The Prime Minister had made it clear from the outset that his government would talk to a cross-section of separatist leaders, a PMO official said.

 Delhi is likely to invite the Mirwaiz before US President George Bushs visit to India, which could take place either in late February or early March. The Hurriyat may be invited in the second half of February, a source said.

 India has also agreed to allow Syed Ali Shah Geelani, leader of the Hurriyats hardline faction, to visit Pakistan to make the overall atmosphere more conducive to peace talks, an official said.

 Sources said the talks would not touch upon anything related to self rule ? a subject the Mirwaiz had raised after his recent visit to Pakistan, where he met President Pervez Musharraf.

 Nor is Delhi keen to discuss Musharrafs proposal to demilitarise Kashmir.

 Talks can be held on human rights and custody killings, which have fallen sharply, and issues relating to the overall betterment of Kashmiris, an official said.

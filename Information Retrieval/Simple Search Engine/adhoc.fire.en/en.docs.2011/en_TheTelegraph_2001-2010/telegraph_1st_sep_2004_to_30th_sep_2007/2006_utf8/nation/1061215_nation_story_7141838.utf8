 House stamp on quota bill, at last

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 14: The bill to reserve 27 per cent seats in higher education for the other backward classes (OBCs) including the creamy layer was finally passed in the Lok Sabha today, around six months after it was proposed.

 All parties supported the bill passed by a voice vote, without any of the amendments suggested by the parliamentary standing committee which had sparked bitter student protests around the country when it was first announced. Medicos from AIIMS had led the protests in May.

 It will next go to the Rajya Sabha, where it is expected to get all-round support, and then the President for approval to become law.

 The IITS and IIMs will have to reserve seats for OBCs from the next academic year along with other government-aided institutions. The quota will apply to certain institutions established, maintained or aided by the Centre. 

 Minority educational institutions and eight institutes of excellence, including the Homi Bhabha National Institute, have been kept out. 

 Beginning from March-April, there will be a staggered implementation of the quota over three years. 

 The Central Educational Institutions (Reservation in Admission) Bill, 2006, has taken the total quota percentage up to 49.5 per cent, just a shade below the 50 per cent ceiling set by the Supreme Court. So far, only SCs and STs had 15 per cent and 7.5 per cent seats reserved for them.

 The creamy layer or the well-off among the OBCs will also be entitled to reservation, overruling the CPMs demand that this group be excluded. The standing committee had suggested that the creamy layer be allowed to access the quota only if any seats are left vacant after taking in the poorer OBCs. The recommendation has been ignored.

 Undergraduate, postgraduate and doctoral study in agriculture and allied sciences, architecture, dentistry, engineering, medicine, nursing, pharmacy and technology, among other disciplines, will be covered.

 But the bills passage is being seen as only a half success by the Arjun Singh-led HRD ministry. The 93rd constitutional amendment bill passed a year ago, which promises affirmative action for backwards, set the stage for the quota bill. 

 A second bill for unaided deemed universities is to be placed before the cabinet. Very soon it will come to the House, Arjun told the Lok Sabha.

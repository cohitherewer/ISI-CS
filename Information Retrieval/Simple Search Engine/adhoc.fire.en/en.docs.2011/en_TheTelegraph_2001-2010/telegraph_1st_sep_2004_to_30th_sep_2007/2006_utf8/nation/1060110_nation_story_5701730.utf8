 Gowda threatens to dump Cong

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Bangalore, Jan. 9: Former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda has threatened to pull out of the alliance with the Congress in Karnataka following the coalition partners move to allow its local units to decide on tie-ups in hung zilla parishads.

 The Janata Dal (Secular) leader said his party would discuss the issue at the scheduled national executive in February.

 The Congress, which is the bigger coalition partner, is in favour of an alliance with Gowdas arch-rival Siddaramaiah, who parted ways and floated the AIPJD, making a dent in the JD (S) vote bank.

 Gowda wants the Congress to follow the coalition model adopted at the state level for the formation of the zilla parishads also ? a proposal the Congress high command has shot down.

 A peeved Gowda met former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee in Delhi yesterday. The BJP has the largest number of MLAs in the state.

 The coalition path has been full of thorns ever since Gowda teamed up with the Congress. 

 With the Congress emerging stronger in the past 18 months, a section of partymen ? who are opposed to Gowda and have been kept out of the government ? has been complaining to Sonia Gandhi about the JD (S) leader. They believe the time is ripe to either tie up with Siddaramaiah or go for fresh polls.

 Under pressure, Gowda sought a meeting with Sonia but was rebuffed.

 In the 224-member Assembly, the BJP has 79 seats, while the coalition partners, the Congress and the JD (S), have 64 and 58, respectively. Five rebels who are with the AIPJD are still part of the JD (S) as they have not been removed.

 A large section of the Congress believes that it is better to go for polls than listen to Gowda, whose stature is diminishing.

 Initially, Gowda used to call the shots in the coalition. But his fortunes began to dip after he got Siddaramaiah removed from the post of deputy chief minister following speculation that he might ditch his political godfather and join the Congress.

 Gowda also has the habit of denigrating people ? be it Infosys chief mentor N.R. Narayana Murthy or Maharashtra governor and former Karnataka chief minister S.M. Krishna. 

 When the issue of poor infrastructure in Bangalore was brought to his notice, Gowda sought to run down the IT industry and complained that it was hand in glove with Krishna to tarnish his image. 

 He also appears averse to some development projects like Metro rail and the Bangalore-Mysore expressway project.

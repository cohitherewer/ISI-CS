 Security aid for BPO night shift

 Mumbai (PTI): A few weeks after a BPO 

 staffer was raped and killed in Bangalore, a Mumbai-based 

 firm has come up with a product for providing security to 

 employees travelling late night to office or home.

 The product works on a combination of radio frequency identification and GSM communication technology. As any passenger presses a specific button on the key, the vehicle would be stalled. Immediately, SMSes requesting help would be sent to five phone numbers, including the police, said Mercury Infocomm System chairman R.P. Mishra. The device also sets off loud alarms from the vehicle.

 The mother unit of the device, Auto Vigil, will be fitted with the engine and each passenger will have a remote signalling key.

 The firm has been asked by a few BPO companies for demonstration.

 DMK seeks rice rollback

 Chennai: DMK chief M. Karunanidhi has 

 demanded that the Centre immediately withdraw its decision 

 to raise the price of rice under the public distribution 

 system and cut the quantity of foodgrain families are entitled 

 to under the scheme.

 Karunanidhi dashed off a fax message to UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to revoke the decision after his arch rival Jayalalithaa demanded last night that the 12 ministers in the UPA government from Tamil Nadu should resign at once for the Centres anti-poor decision.

 With the coming Assembly polls in mind, the chief minister said the decision to increase the price of rice supplied to the states for the PDS had only exposed the anti-people treachery of the DMK-led combine. 

 Salem warrant

 Mumbai (PTI): A special court has issued 

 a production warrant against extradited gangster Abu Salem 

 for his alleged complicity in the murder of Ajit Dewani. 

 Dewani, who was the secretary of actor Manisha Koirala, was murdered in 2001.

 Gangster held

 Muzaffarnagar (PTI): Vicky Tyagi, a 

 gangster carrying a reward on his head, and two of his hitmen 

 were held on Sunday. They were allegedly trying to extort 

 Rs 30 lakh from a businessman here, a police official said. 

 Two stolen cars and a pistol were seized from them.

 Doctor in sex net

 Mumbai (PTI): Eight persons, including 

 a doctor and his wife, have been arrested for their alleged 

 involvement in a prostitution racket, police said. Himanshu 

 Desai, 53, and his wife Malavika, 51, were arrested from 

 their residence in Dahisar on Saturday night. 

 Indian and Russian paratroopers will hold their 

 second joint exercise in August in Russia. The first joint 

 anti-terror war games, Indra 2005, was held in Rajasthan.

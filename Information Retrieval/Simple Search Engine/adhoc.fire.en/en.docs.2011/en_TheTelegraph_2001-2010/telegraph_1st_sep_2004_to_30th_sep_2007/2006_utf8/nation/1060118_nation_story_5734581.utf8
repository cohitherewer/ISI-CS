 Bangalore, Jan. 17: Techies in Indias Silicon Valley will no more report to work with soot on their faces, in crumpled clothes or travel weary.

 The Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation today launched 25 low-floor, air-conditioned Volvo buses to connect the city with the tech hubs of Whitefield and Electronics City. They will start plying from Saturday.

 This is the first time in the country that Volvo buses will run on city bus routes.

 Volvo Buses Corporation said the Rs 60-lakh vehicle, which can accommodate nearly 100 passengers, meets Euro III emission norms and is fitted with an automatic transmission. 

 Its low floors are a boon to the wheelchair-bound.

 Technically, the long vehicle has a better turning radius than conventional buses. Passengers will experience a fluid movement where the braking and typical jerks are hardly noticeable, the company said.

 Our city buses are the future for many cities in India. It is safe, convenient and ensures good returns for the operators, its president Hakan Karlsson said yesterday.

 Volvo is also holding talks with transport corporations in Mumbai, Ahmedabad and Hyderabad.

 The managing director of the Bangalore corporation, Upendra Tripathi, said these buses will ply on three routes ? Majestic to Electronics City, ITPL and on the Ring Road. Based on passenger response, we will expand to other routes, he said.

 While 25 buses will join its fleet by March, the corporation has already placed an order for another 25. The drivers are trained and certified by Volvo at its factory in Hoskote on the outskirts of Bangalore.

 Volvo, which has been advocating separate bus lanes, has studied the routes these buses would ply. 

 There would be no problem to operate these buses along with other traffic. Although at the moment, it is not feasible to have special lanes, it will become an optimal and reliable transport system soon for the city, the vice-president of Volvo Buses South Asia, Akash Passey, said.

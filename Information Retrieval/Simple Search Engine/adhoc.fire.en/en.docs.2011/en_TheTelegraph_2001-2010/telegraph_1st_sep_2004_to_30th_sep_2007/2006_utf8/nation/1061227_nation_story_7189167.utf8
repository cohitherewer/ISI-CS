 New Delhi, Dec. 26: Delhi police have arrested six men who they believe are part of an international narcotics organisation trafficking heroin from Afghanistan and West Asia to India and countries further east.

 The nature of the arrested group is multinational three of them are Indians, two Nigerians and one Pakistani.

 In all, 17.83 kg of pure, high-quality heroin was seized from them. Drug rates vary with the extent of purity, and the heroin recovered could fetch about Rs 18 crore in the international market. 

 The police are conducting raids in parts of the capital in search of other members of the gang after yesterdays arrests from various parts of Delhi.

 We believe this should not be looked at as an ordinary drug bust. The gang these men belong to has been ferrying heroin from West Asia to India and then eastwards for the past four-five years now, said joint commissioner of police (special cell) Karnail Singh.

 While Nigerian presence in the capitals underbelly, in particular in the drug-trafficking business, has been noticed for the past year, the police are calling the arrest of Afzal the Pakistani a qualitative breakthrough.

 The arrest of a Pakistani national is significant, because it could imply that the net of traffickers may be expanding, Singh said. Afzal, arrested in Connaught Place, is also being described as the kingpin of the group arrested. 

 One of the Nigerians, Kinsey, was arrested with Tejinder and Vinay Indians from Amritsar at Uttam Nagar in north Delhi.

 Jack, the other Nigerian, was picked up at almost the same time yesterday evening along with Kaplesh from Kerala at Tilak Nagar in northwest Delhi. 

 The police suspect the heroin could have been headed, through the Northeast, to Myanmar.

 Drugs are relatively easier to hide than other goods smuggled across the Indo-Myanmar border, and if the men had escaped us here, the heroin catch would have been hard to stop, a police official said.

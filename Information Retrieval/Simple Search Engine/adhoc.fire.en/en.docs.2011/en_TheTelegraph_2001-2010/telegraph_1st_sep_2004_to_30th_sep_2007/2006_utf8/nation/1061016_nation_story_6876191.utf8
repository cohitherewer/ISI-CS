 Pardon heat piles on YSR

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Hyderabad, Oct. 15: The Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy government in Andhra Pradesh is facing criticism over its recommendation of clemency for Gowru Venkat Reddy, the husband of a Congress legislator from Kurnool district.

 Days before the Telugu Desam-led Opposition plans to call on the President and Prime Minister over the YSR governments role in the controversial clemency case, legal opinion has slammed the government.

 The Supreme Court, while setting aside governor Sushil Kumar Shindes remission of Gowrus jail term from 10 to three years earlier this week, had noted that the recommendation for clemency highlighted that the convict was married to a Congress MLA. It ruled that politics, caste or religion should never count in the grant of clemency.

 Opposition parties have been demanding Reddys resignation following the Supreme Courts order. It is ridiculous for the chief minister to say now that he did not read the file, said BJP leader Bandaru Dattatreya.

 According to a count by Reddy watchers, the YSR government has been arraigned by the judiciary on 65 occasions for lapses and wrong decisions since it came to power in 2004. The government topped the list of judicial criticism, said former advocate-general S. Ramachandra Rao.

 Former attorney-general Soli Sorabjee held the cabinet responsible for the governors action of granting pardon to Gowru. Sorabjee, who was in Hyderabad to attend a lecture series at the National Police Academy, said the only aspect in favour of grant of clemency and remission of the jail term was Gowrus being a good Congressman.

 Reddy has dismissed the criticism against his government as politically motivated. The apex court had not said a single word against my government or cabinet or myself, he told a news conference. The chief minister also reeled out a list of remissions given by the previous Chandrababu Naidu government.

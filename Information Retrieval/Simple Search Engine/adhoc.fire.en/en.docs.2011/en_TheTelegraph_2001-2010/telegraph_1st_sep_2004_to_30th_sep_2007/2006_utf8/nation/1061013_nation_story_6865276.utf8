 India, some fullstops

 Jolie: What colour, meals?

 Mumbai, Oct. 12: Guess whos not coming to dinner with Mr and Mrs Smith?

 With shooting on from 7 pm till morning, Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt have been eating their evening meal at one of the three Pune bungalows rented for the film. Their fellow diners include the films foreign crew.

 But the Indian crew eats downstairs.

 One of the bungalows has a serving area exclusively for the foreign crew. The Indians have their meal on the ground floor, while they (the foreigners) have it on the first floor, said Ananta Kumhar, who did up the interiors of one of the bungalows, Nayansukh.

 He offered an excuse for the segregation: Thats maybe because we prefer different kinds of food.

 Brangelinas admiration for desi sights and smells they reportedly said the trip would enrich their childrens experience apparently stops at the dining table.

 Getting too close to the couple, of course, has had its perils for some of the few Indians who have managed it. Two students fell off their skidding motorcycle as Jolies car sped past them last evening.

 The shooting for A Mighty Heart, based on Daniel Pearls life, began on the slain American journalists 43rd birthday, October 10. Most of the shooting is being done at Nayansukh, which is standing in for Pearls Karachi home.

 Scores of cars line the gates and production hands run around from one bungalow to the other with walkie-talkies in their hands. The street sign outside now reads: Zamzama Fourth Street. The boundary walls of the neighbouring bungalows, too, have been painted white to complete the Karachi look.

 Bungalow number 109 is reportedly being used as the make-up room and dining place. Jolie and Pitt might stay in one of the three bungalows Nayansukh, number 109 or number 132.

 A narrow gate opens almost from the threshold of Nayansukh into a bylane that leads to the Nilgiri Lines, with its makeshift shanties, overflowing drains and muck. 

 The squalid locality is home to hundreds of household helps who work in the upscale Sindh Society and the neighbourhood.

 Its one picture of India that, if they were to see it, might spoil the Hollywood sets appetite.

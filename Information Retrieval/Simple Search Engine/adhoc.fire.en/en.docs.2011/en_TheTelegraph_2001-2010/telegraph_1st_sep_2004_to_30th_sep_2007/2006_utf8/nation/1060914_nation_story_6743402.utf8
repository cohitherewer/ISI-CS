 Schools take parents for a ride

 Class trick

 New Delhi, Sept. 13: It was a shock 38-year-old Sushmita Kapoor says she will never forget.

 When the entrepreneur saw the advertisement for Play On, a pre-school for children under six in west Delhi, it seemed the perfect place to send her three-year-old son Ayush.

 It offered individual attention, a swimming pool and even horse-riding classes, the single mother said.

 A busy Sushmita was impressed by the online admission forms, which she filled in and, on the due date, sent Ayush with an ayah to the school.

 I myself could not go to the school for some days. I was either out of town or too busy, she said.

 One evening, Ayush rushed into her arms, crying.

 The next day, she decided to visit the school only to find out that the perfect play school was located in a narrow back-alley in a residential locality. It had a small courtyard that passed off as a playground and a single, rusted slide.

 The swimming pool was a small pond, created by diverting water from the nearby sewer and using a purification system. The children, naturally, were staying away from it.

 Nor were there any facilities for horse-riding. I was told the horse-riding would start in a few days, Sushmita said.

 According to NGOs and some in the Delhi government, its a racket.

 There are no guidelines, here or anywhere else in the country, for these play schools that have mushroomed in the metros, said Bullu Sareen, who runs YWCA Force, an NGO concerned with the education of young children.

 Sareen asked that when every booming business is made to undergo regulations, why not the play school industry?

 Eurokids, one of the largest play school chains in India, for instance, has 180 centres around the metros.

 Anubha Shankar, in charge of one of the schools of Mothers Pride another chain said the company has been making a turnover of around Rs 10 crore for the past few years.

 She agreed about the need for guidelines, saying she was shocked at Sushmitas story.

 While it is good business, no serious player in this field wants the entire business to get a bad name because of a few, she said.

 The Delhi government has received several complaints about play schools duping well-off but busy parents, a senior bureaucrat admitted on condition that he is not named. 

 The latest occasion was when the issue of these play schools being sealed by the Municipal Corporation of Delhi came up, he said.

 The MCD was planning to seal the premises of several play schools operating out of residential areas, which is illegal under the Delhi master plan 2021. The master plan has since been amended by the Delhi government to allow the play schools to continue.

 Each time the issue comes up even this time (it runs into) a powerful lobby that does not want any regulations on the play schools, the bureaucrat said.

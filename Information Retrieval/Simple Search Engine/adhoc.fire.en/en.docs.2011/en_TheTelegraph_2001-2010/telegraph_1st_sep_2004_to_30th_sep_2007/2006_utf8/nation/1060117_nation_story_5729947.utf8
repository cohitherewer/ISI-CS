 Glimmer of hope in Maoist pact 

 BHARAT BHUSHAN

Kathmandu, Jan. 16: The agreement between the Maoist insurgent leaders and representatives of the seven-party alliance for democracy has injected a new sense of hope for peace in Nepal. 

 A quantum leap forward is how a European diplomat described the 12-point understanding between the seven-party alliance fighting for democracy in Nepal and the Maoists. 

 It commits the Maoists to multi-party democracy and respect for human rights. The instrument for achieving democracy will be the Constituent Assembly and there the two sides have admitted their differences, the diplomat said. 

 Getting the Maoists to agree to multi-party democracy and the outcome of an elected Constituent Assembly even rhetorically is a huge step forward, he added. 

 Suryabahadur Thapa, described as the sly old fox of Nepalese politics and five times Prime Minister of the country, however, dubbed the alliance unnatural. 

 Principally, I dont agree with it. It is born out of compulsions of the political parties, the Maoists and their advisers, whoever they might be. Still, I say, that the political parties should take advantage of it, Thapa said. 

 The Maoists have shown good strategic thinking. The political parties now have to turn the alliance to their advantage. If they dont then we wont have to wait too long for the consequences, he added grimly. 

 Why did the Maoists agree to reach an understanding with the political parties? 

 Shyam Shreshtha, the editor of the Left-wing magazine Mulyankan, explained: The Maoists knew that even if they could seize state power militarily, they could not hold on to it. 

 To push their agenda they needed the support of the international community and the opinion-making middle class in Nepal. They couldnt do so by sidelining the political parties. They were also the sufferers of the kings February 1 coup. 

 He added that perhaps their popularity had also diminished because of their excessive use of force and coercion. A combination of these factors brought about a change in their strategy. 

 Professor Lokraj Baral, an eminent political scientist venerated by young Nepalese for voicing Republican sentiments much ahead of the political parties, seemed to agree.

 The Maoists have their own problems and want a safe landing. But what is wrong with that? They should give up arms, the use of violence and accept democracy. If they do so, it is good. 

 Girija Prasad Koirala, the president of the Nepali Congress, the primary moving force for a dialogue with the Maoists, sees the understanding reached with them as a first step towards bringing them within a democratic value system. 

 Democracy also imposes a responsibility on us to bring even non-democratic elements within the democratic framework. I am convinced that the Maoists can be brought to the democratic path. The 12-point understanding is a measure of our success in that direction, he said. 

 Koiralas views are underlined by another stalwart, Madhav Kumar Nepal, the general secretary of the Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist Leninist), a member of the seven-party alliance. 

 The seven-party alliance and the Maoists have agreed to bring down this autocratic monarchy, hold elections to a Constituent Assembly and establish complete democracy. Together with the Maoists, we are exploring how to bring about a participatory democracy in this country. These are no longer just slogans, he said. 

 Hari Sharma, director of social science, Baha, claimed the 12-point understanding is a turning point in Nepalese politics. 

 It ends the politics of displacement ? the Maoists first displacing the political parties and then the king doing so through his coup. It marks a new politics of engagement that makes peace possible, identifies contentious issues and ensures that any future dispensation will have to begin with this minimum agenda, Sharma said. 

 He pointed out that the future dispensation will have no place for the king. There will be multiple negotia- tions at the popular level ? between ethnic, religious and regional identity groups. Which group does the king belong to? The current engagement is taking place outside his realm ? both traditional and contemporary.

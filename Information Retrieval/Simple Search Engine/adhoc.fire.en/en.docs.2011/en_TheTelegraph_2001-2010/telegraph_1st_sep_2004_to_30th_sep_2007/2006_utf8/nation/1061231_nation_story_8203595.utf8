 AGENDA 2007

 Women are seeking more gains in the new year. Here are some priorities

 Power

 corridors

 For women activists and politicians, this is unfinished business. The disappointment of watching the men again stall the bill that would force them to give up a third of all legislature seats to women has given way to anger mdash; and the determination to ensure its tabling and passage in 2007. ldquo;We are ready for aggressive action: a Parliament gherao, an indefinite hunger strike, a march with black flags mdash; anything, rdquo; a Left woman activist said. ldquo;The women are ready to go to jail. We have done enough of petitioning, rdquo; added Annie Raja, leader of the CPI-backed National Federation of Indian Women.

 Even Sonia Gandhi said she felt like joining the women who sat outside Parliament in a dharna. With all the women MPs mdash; from the CPM rsquo;s Brinda Karat to the BJP rsquo;s Sushma Swaraj mdash; united, the Lalu Prasads and Mulayam Singh Yadavs may be in for a shock in the new year.

 Dupe, dump and pay

 If a wronged wife rsquo;s sufferings are bad, worse have been those of the duped or dumped ldquo;other woman rdquo;, live-in partner or ldquo;second wife rdquo;. But no longer, if the National Commission for Women gets the criminal law amendment it wants. It has suggested that a woman in a live-in relationship should be entitled to a monthly maintenance if 

 deserted by her partner.

 A woman often marries a man (or lives together with him in a relationship like marriage) without realising he is 

 already married till he 

 deserts her and refuses 

 alimony. These women will 

 be the biggest beneficiaries.

 Harass hope

 Women at their colleagues rsquo; mercy are not the only victims of workplace sexual harassment. So are women customers who face lewd comments from a shop assistant or bank clerk, or those molested at a police 

 station. They are all being 

 harassed at someone rsquo;s 

 workplace.

 Unlike the women rsquo;s reservation bill, the one on sexual 

 harassment at the workplace got delayed not because of stalling by the men but because women themselves wanted its scope widened. It rsquo;s likely to be tabled in 2007, 

 enriched by suggestions from activists and the public. Its features will include a complaints cell in every organisation, a ldquo;district officer rdquo; (DM or ADM) to deal with 

 complaints and a ldquo;local 

 complaints committee rdquo;. Any inquiry panel will have a civil court rsquo;s powers and will work to a 90-day deadline.

 Budget boost

 The year 2007 may see a more gender-sensitive budget mdash; for instance, more integrated schemes for educated, unemployed girls. ldquo;We hope the budget will recognise and extend credit to women farmers and entrepreneurs in rural areas, rdquo; said Ranjana Kumari, who heads WomenPowerConnect, which is lobbying with the government to empower the gender more. Kumari said the government would be pressured to also come up with gender budget 

 assessments.

 Calcutta, July 15: If the Bengal chief ministers office is working round the clock to make Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees proposed US trip later this year a success, the Bengalis there are busy arranging business meetings for the Left leader.

 Interest in India has never been so high in the US and this is the time to sell the state, said Swadesh Chatterjee, a North Carolina-based businessman and political activist.

 Chatterjee, a prominent member of the Indian-American community in the US, met Bengal chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb and industry secretary Sabyasachi Sen in Washington when they were in the US last month to prepare the ground for the chief ministers visit.

 In Calcutta on a 10-day personal visit, the businessman with roots in Bankura will call on state government officials to discuss Bhattacharjees trip. 

 People outside the state dont know much about the positive changes happening in Bengal. Thats why there is a pressing need to tell the true story and we will help in coordinating meetings with businessmen in the US. We are now waiting for the dates, said Chatterjee, who in 2001 became the first Indian American to be awarded the Padma Bhushan.

 Bhattacharjee, who has got an invitation from the US-India Business Council, is expected to meet the Indian-American community and US investors. 

 According to Chatterjee, the challenge before the chief minister would be to convince multinationals to put their money on the state ruled by the Left for 30 years. But the hype around India and Americas interest in conducting business with the country will make Bhattacharjees job easier, he added.

 Chatterjee, who will be visiting his mother in Sonamukhi in Bankura, is also involved in lobbying for strategic partnership between the Indian and US governments. 

 As founding member of the US-India Friendship Council, Chatterjee is known to have played a key role in steering the recent Indo-US agreement on civilian nuclear cooperation through the House International Relations Committee and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

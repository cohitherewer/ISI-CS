 Seat strain on Sena alliance

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Oct. 4: The 22-year-old Shiv Sena-BJP alliance in Maharashtra has come under strain less than six months after the death of the man who was instrumental in keeping it alive.

 Pramod Mahajans absence began to tell on the combine as the partners squabbled over an Assembly seat by-election amid threats of a divorce if the standoff drags on.

 After a closed-door meeting at Sena leader Bal Thackerays home this evening, the party vowed to file nomination for the Chimur seat in the Vidarbha region. The decision came despite BJPs insistence on fielding a candidate in the constituency.

 There was no talk about snapping ties with the BJP. But it was decided that no matter what, Sena will have its own candidate for Chimur as it held the seat earlier. It was felt that the BJP should make necessary changes in its plan if it values this friendship, said Vinayak Raut, aide to Sena president Uddhav Thackeray.

 The veiled threat stops short of snapping ties at this point, but it mirrors the rapid changes in the equations with the BJP ever since Uddhav took over the Senas reins.

 The Chimur seat was held by Senas Vijay Vadettiwar in the last elections. 

 But he recently switched sides and followed Senas former leader Narayan Rane to the Congress.

 Smarting from the betrayal, the Sena is bent on making the election a grudge match. But the BJP believes that the party should be given the seat as the Sena has no candidate with the calibre to win.

 The Sena has not officially informed us anything about snapping ties. They understand the value of this partnership and I am sure they will look at the whole issue in a matured way. But I want to put this on record that BJP will field its candidate at Chimur, Maharashtra BJP chief Nitin Gadkari said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 No arrest in harass rough-up

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Nov. 9: Two days have passed since Ayan Chakraborty was roughed up for raising his voice against the harassment of women autorickshaw passengers but police are yet to arrest anyone.

 I have asked the inspector-in-charge to submit a report. Then, action will be taken, said S.N. Gupta, district superintendent of police, South 24-Parganas.

 On Tuesday, Chakraborty, 38, had asked two youths to behave themselves when he saw them harassing some schoolgirls. However, the defiant duo went on to harass a woman travelling in an autorickshaw with Chakraborty.

 When Chakraborty, a resident of Motilal Gupta Road in Behala, reached Tollygunge Metro station, the youths and a few others beat him up. He later reported the incident to Regent Park police station.

 I was not in town, so I could not follow up on the matter. But I will take it up with the highest authorities, Chakraborty said.

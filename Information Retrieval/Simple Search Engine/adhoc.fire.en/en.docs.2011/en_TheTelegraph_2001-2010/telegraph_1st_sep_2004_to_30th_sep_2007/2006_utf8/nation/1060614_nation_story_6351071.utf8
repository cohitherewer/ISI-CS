The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Two more states in fuel tax cut

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, June 13: The governments of Delhi and Uttaranchal today announced a reduction in the prices of petrol and diesel. 

 While the Uttaranchal government has decided to completely forego the value-added tax (VAT) on the increase in the price announced by the oil companies, the Delhi government has decided to impose a lower tax. 

 The Delhi government has announced its decision to reduce the price of petrol and diesel in the capital by 67 paise and 22 paise per litre, respectively. 

 The Uttaranchal government, however, will not charge 25 per cent VAT at all on the increased component of Rs 3.86 on petrol and 21 per cent on the increased component of Rs 1.79 on diesel.

 Prices of petrol would, therefore, come down by 95 paise while diesel would be cheaper by 38 paise in the hill state.

 Delhi finance minister A.K. Walia said after a cabinet meeting that the reduced price would come into effect in the city within a week.

 At present, the price of petrol in Delhi is Rs 47.51 per litre and diesel costs Rs 32.47 per litre. After the new prices come into effect, petrol will cost Rs 46.84 per litre and diesel will be available for Rs 32.25 per litre in the city.

 Vehicle owners in Uttaranchal are luckier as the reduced prices have already come into effect. 

 A decision to this effect was taken by the N.D. Tiwari government in Dehra Dun last night.

 Tech laggard tap for Bengal

 MONOBINA GUPTA 

New Delhi, Nov. 24: The Centre has told Bengal it is not investing enough in technical education at a time when it is nurturing a burgeoning IT sector.

 Bengal is among 12 laggard states whose chief ministers have received a nudge from the Union human resource development ministry to try and meet the shortfall in technical education.

 Arjun Singhs letter asks the states to place proposals before the Planning Commission so that necessary allocations can be made in the 11th five year plan.

 Bengal offers 24 degree and 11 diploma courses in the field of technical education per one lakh population about a third of the national average of 68 and 31, an HRD ministry review shows.

 Orissa is far ahead with 55 degree and 26 diploma courses, and even Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh fare better than Bengal with 38 and 28 degree courses.

 Bihar is at the bottom with 3 degree and 4 diploma courses and Assam is just above it with 4 and 6.

 The HRD ministry is baffled by the situation, for Bengal is economically far better off than Bihar or Orissa. Officials say the state is not investing enough money in this sector.

 The ministry has suggested that these 12 states create a more investor-friendly climate, court private partners, offer land concessions, set up institutions in backward areas, increase seats in the existing institutions and improve the quality of secondary education.

 The ministry is worried not just over the paltry number of institutions but also the quality of teaching. This is a concern Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee shares. 

 At a recent seminar on higher technical education, he conceded that most IT and computer science teachers in Bengal are under-qualified.

 The chief minister said he feared a shortfall in the supply of techies. The annual demand for IT professionals in Bengal will go up to 58,000 within a year but the 52 engineering colleges in the state will only be able to provide 8,280 graduates a year, he said.

 Over 70 per cent of colleges in Bengal do not have full-time teachers for computer science courses, The Telegraph had reported this week.

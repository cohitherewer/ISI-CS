 Lanka tax on films, ads

 Colombo, July 6 (PTI): Sri Lanka has introduced a new entertainment tax for all foreign films, commercials and serials, including those produced in India, the finance ministry said today. 

 Foreign commercials aired on television will be taxed 1 million Sri Lankan rupees while a 30-minute film or drama for broadcast on television will be charged 75,000 Sri Lankan rupees. The tax goes into effect immediately, officials said. Most of the popular television dramas are imported from India, they added. 

 Tele-dramas and films imported and dubbed in the native Sinahala or Tamil languages will be taxed 90,000 Sri Lankan rupees for a 30-minute segment.

 This is not a revenue generation method, but a policy directive to ensure the development of the arts, treasury secretary P.B. Jayasundara said.

 Tamil language content is exempted from the tax as Sri Lanka produces very little of these programmes, he added.

 National film corporation chairman Asoka Serasinghe said around 57 films are aired on television each week of which nearly 50 are in foreign languages.

 About 300 local film producers are languishing without sponsors while many line up to finance Hindi productions which have a huge following even though there are no native Hindi speakers in Sri Lanka.

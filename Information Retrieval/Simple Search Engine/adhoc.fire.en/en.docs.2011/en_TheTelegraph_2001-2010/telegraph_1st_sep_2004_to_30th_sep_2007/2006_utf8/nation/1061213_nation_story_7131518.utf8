 Chase ends for Bhag

 SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI 

 Suneil Shetty

 Mumbai, Dec. 12: Hollywood rip-offs are fast becoming pass for Bollywood copycats. They are pouncing on things closer home the top-grossing regional films.

 But the makers of originals arent exactly sleeping. On Saturday, actor-producer Suneil Shetty was forced into an out-of-court settlement with Malayalam film producer Mani Kappan. 

 Shettys Bhagam Bhag, a fast-paced comic-thriller due to hit the marquee on December 22, is allegedly a remake of Kappans super-hit Mannar Mathai Speaking. 

 Today, Shetty and his associates agreed to pay Kappan a royalty for the remake. Kappan, in turn, withdrew his copyright-infringement suit against the Bhagam Bhag producers. 

 We have received Rs 75 lakh by demand draft as royalty for the Hindi remake of Mannar Mathai Speaking. In the circumstances, Mani has no objection to the release of Bhagam Bhag, said Majid Memon, Kappans lawyer. 

 None of the Bhagam Bhag producers were available for comment. Last week, Justice S.F. Vajifdar of Bombay High Court had issued notices to Shetty, who owns Popcorn Motion Pictures, and Raj Mehta of Shree Ashtavinayak Cinevision which has co-produced the film. They were asked to reply to Kappans copyright petition.

 We got to know that Bhagam Bhag was a copy of Mannar Mathai Speaking from the films website and television promos. On scrutiny, we found that the story, screenplay and presentation of the two films were exactly the same. Thats when we decided to file a suit, said Memon. 

 Mannar Mathai Speaking is itself a sequel to Ramji Rao Speaking, one of the most memorable Malayalam comedies that was remade in Hindi as Hera Pheri by Priyadarshan. Incidentally, Priyadarshan has directed Bhagam Bhag, too. The court notices had also gone out to Priyadarshan and story-screenplay writer Neeraj Vora.

 All relevant permissions had been sought while making Hera Pheri. I dont know whether the producers of Bhagam Bhag were as meticulous as we were, said a source close to Feroze Nadiadwala, the producer of Hera Pheri.

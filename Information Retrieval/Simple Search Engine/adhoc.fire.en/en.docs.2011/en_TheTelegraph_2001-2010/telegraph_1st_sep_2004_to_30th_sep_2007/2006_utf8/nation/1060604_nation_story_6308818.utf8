 Amar complains of Cong sting

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 3: Samajwadi Party general secretary Amar Singh today accused the Congress of masterminding sting operations against party leaders to destabilise the Mulayam Singh government in Uttar Pradesh. 

 I have received information regarding sting operations against me and other party leaders, including Akhilesh Yadav and Shivpal Yadav, he said. Akhilesh is Mulayams son and Shivpal the chief ministers brother.

 Ever since the Samajwadi Party government came to power in Uttar Pradesh, the Congress has been trying to destabilise it.

 Singh alleged at a news conference that sting operators, equipped with hidden camera on a laptop, had approached his lawyers with specific queries regarding him and other party leaders. The Congress strategists have deployed the sting operators against me. 

 Asked about the basis of his allegations, Singh only said: I have all the information about whatever they are planning. We have concrete proof in this regard.

 The Congress rubbished the allegations. The Congress has better things to do. We are concerned with issues like better implementation of the employment guarantee scheme and making the right to information popular, the partys media cell secretary Tom Vadakkan said.

 Roy pens Farm II

 New Delhi: Having desisted from writing fiction for years after she won the Booker, Arundhati Roy has been inspired by George W. Bush to pen her version of George Orwells Animal Farm. 

 Animal Farm II by Roy does not, however, turn to Mr Jones or Napoleon to play the Czar and Stalin. The title of her play says it all ? Animal Farm: In which George Bush says what he really means.

 I want to acknowledge that this play is entirely derivative, Roy told a bemused gathering of students at JNU on Tuesday night, adding the caveat ? public speeches and reflections of the famous poet, pacifist, flower child, free thinker and social activist George W. Bush. 

 All money from the sales should be sent directly to him. The location where the play is being staged is Purana Qila in Delhi, she said.

 No Ash 

 Mumbai (PTI): Aishwarya Rai would not be seen at the luncheon being hosted by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in honour of US President George W. Bush in Delhi on Thursday.

 Aishwaryas secretary Hari Singh said on Wednesday the protocol officer in the foreign ministry called to invite the actor 40 minutes after she left for Brazil on Tuesday night. 

 We have informed the ministry via e-mail that she would not be able to attend the event, Singh said.

 Aishwarya is in Brazil to shoot for Dhoom 2.

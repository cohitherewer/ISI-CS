 Mumbai landmark facelift

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Dec. 17: Thanks to a generous Tata company, Mumbais architectural landmark, the Rajabai Tower, a clock tower located on Mumbai Universitys Fort campus, will get a facelift. 

 Tata Consultancy Services chairman and managing director S. Ramadorai visited the campus on Friday and discussed a proposal for funding the restoration of the library, as well as the clock tower, with vice-chancellor Vijay Khole.

 Ramadorai agreed to contribute Rs 75 lakh to the makeover, which will be carried out under the supervision of a noted city architect and conservationist. The 280-foot high clock tower is named after Rajabai, the mother of Premchand Roychand, a 19th century stockbroker whod helped fund its construction.

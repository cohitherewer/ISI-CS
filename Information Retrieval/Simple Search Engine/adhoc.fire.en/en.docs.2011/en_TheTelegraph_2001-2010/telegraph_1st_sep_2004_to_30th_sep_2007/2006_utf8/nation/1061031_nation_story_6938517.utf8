 Arrest in Malegaon serial blasts 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Oct. 30: Police have announced the first formal arrest in the Malegaon blasts case, saying an alleged Simi activist was among those who planted the bicycle bombs that killed 37 people.

 The police also claimed that the explosions were engineered to fuel communal tension in the sensitive powerloom town near Nashik in Maharashtra.

 Identified as Noor-ul-Hooda, the 25-year-old suspect was formally arrested and produced in a local court that remanded him in police custody till November 3. The police said Hooda is suspected to be a member of the banned Students Islamic Movement of India.

 Four bombs had exploded within minutes of each other in the Muslim-dominated town of Malegaon on the Shab-e-Baraat day near the Hamidiya mosque and Mushewarat Chowk on September 8. The victims included several women and children.

 Director-general of police P.S. Pasricha said Hooda was a resident of Malegaon, and worked in a godown owned by Shabbir Ahmed Batterywala, a suspect arrested in connection with a bomb hoax in a Malegaon shopping centre three days after the blasts.

 Asked whether Lashkar-e-Toiba, named in the July 11 Mumbai train bombings case, was also responsible for the Malegaon terror attack, Pasricha said: We have arrested him yesterday. As and when we get more information, we will share it.

 He added that the motive behind the explosions was to create communal tension in Malegaon.

 Hoodas arrest was made on the basis of our information and statements of witnesses. It wont be pertinent to divulge any more information about the investigation, Pasricha said.

 The police said Batterywala was detained and later arrested in connection with the bomb hoax in a shopping complex on September 12.

 Batterywala is a conspirator since his godown was used in the explosions. We had sent the material found on the stairs of the shopping centre to forensic labs. Their report confirmed that there were similarities with the explosives used in the serial explosions, Pasricha said.

 He added Mumbai police would seek the custody of Batterywala and Hooda for questioning on possible links with the train bombings.

 Arjun swipe at IIM

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 18: As IIM Bangalore today began preparing to meet Arjun Singhs terms for going global, he again had a go at the premier B-school.

 The Union human resource development (HRD) minister had in a TV interview yesterday set the institute a condition: it must amend its memorandum of association (MoA) if it has to set up shop abroad.

 This morning, during an interaction with the media, he attacked the B-school, saying its board of governors was not competent to take its initial decision to start a campus in Singapore ? a plan his ministry had struck down.

 The IIMs board is made up by representatives from the Union HRD ministry, the state government and the institute itself. Arjun indicated that the government representatives on the board had not endorsed the overseas plan.

 Asked why the government had, then, taken so long to decide on the matter, he replied that important decisions take time.

 IIM Bangalore sources, however, said that when the proposal had been put before its board, none had objected. When the plan gained momentum, the HRD ministrys permission was sought.

 We cant possibly take every idea to the ministry and get its clearance first. After all, the IIMs are supposed to be autonomous, a source said.

 The sources added that the institute had now decided to amend the MoA and had called a board meeting on Friday.

 Asked if his ministry would give its nod after the MoA is amended, Arjun evaded a definite answer. Let them start the procedure, then we will see, he said. We are prepared to review the decision.

 Officials said amending the MoA would take time, which means Arjun can breathe easy for now. To make the necessary changes to the document, the board will have to thrash out a formula acceptable to all the members.

 The government is clearly against any of the IIMs setting up campuses abroad till they meet the domestic requirement. The institutes now offer short courses abroad but do not grant degrees.

 Arjun made it clear that the government doesnt have the money to set up too many new IIMs to meet the domestic demand. So far, it has decided to open one in Shillong.

 But I do not think we can have more IIMs in the near future. The existing IIMs, which have a huge corpus of funds, should help students who have no access to these premier institutions, Arjun added.

 Yesterday, Arjun had said these six premier B-schools were not private companies, free to do what they want.

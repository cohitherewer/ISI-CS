 Foreign minister soon: Singh

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Singh

 Brasilia, Sept. 12: A new external affairs minister will be in place soon after Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs return home at the end of the NAM summit next week. 

 Singh indicated this during an interaction with journalists on board his special aircraft en route to Brasilia, where he arrived last night.

 Defence minister Pranab Mukherjee will, however, lead the delegation to the annual meeting of the UN General Assembly as scheduled. 

 Could NAMs legacy of US-baiting isolate India? Or, is his attendance at NAM intended to counter the allegation that Indias foreign policy is tilting too much towards the US? 

 Singh explained that India was not seeking good relations with the US at the cost of its relations with other countries. Our desire to normalise and expand relations with the US in no way contradicts or runs counter to the interest of other countries. 

 Non-alignment, according to him, is a state of mind and represents an ability to exercise independent judgement on all issues. Whether it is improving relations with the US, China or Latin America, the objective is to try and widen Indias development options. Weve to toss the balls, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Row over rebel arrests

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Srinagar, Nov. 6: The army and Kashmir police are caught in a fresh row over the arrest of four youths from an Uri village. Ghulam Mohiudin Akhoon, Mushtaq Najar, Manzoor Lone and Maqbool Dar were arrested last night. But the army and the police have come out with conflicting statements about the arrests.

 Army spokesperson Col H.K. Juneja said the youths told us they were trying to exfiltrate to Pakistan-occupied Kashmir to receive arms training. 

 But Mohammad Yousuf, sub-divisional police officer of Uri, said when the youths were handed over to us, they said they had come here to purchase cows. It does not appear they were exfiltrating.

 Two weeks back, the killing of Mohammad Maqbool Dar, a youth from Pakherpora, had created a similar controversy. While the army said he was a militant and had died due to sickness, the police said he was innocent.

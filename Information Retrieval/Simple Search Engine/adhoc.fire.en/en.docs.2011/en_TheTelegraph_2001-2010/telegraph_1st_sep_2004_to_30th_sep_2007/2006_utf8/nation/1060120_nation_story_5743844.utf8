The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Pat for Buddha, not party

 Calcutta, Jan. 19: Singapore is high on the Bengal chief ministers list of countries he wishes to draw investment from. Going by what a senior minister from that nation said today, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee may have a lot of hard sell ahead of him.

 Goh Chok Tong, who had once guided the southeastern financial powerhouses policies as its Prime Minister, felt Bhattacharjee was serious enough about attracting capital but feared that the CPMs image could play spoiler.

 Goh, who flew in from Ahmedabad to attend the CII Partnership Summit, compared Bhattacharjee ? somewhat embarrassingly for him ? to Narendra Modi of Gujarat as investment-friendly chief ministers.

 Here (in Bengal) the chief minister thinks differently (from his party), Goh conceded. But he felt this may not be enough to convince global investors, who still see the Left as slow in accepting the need for reforms.

 Now they (the Left) understand the importance of FDI in creating jobs and alleviating poverty, Goh said, but added that they were still reluctant to let India open up its economy further.

 He even suggested that the Lefts presence in the UPA could send wrong signals but quickly added that this was Indias internal matter.

 Goh felt the nation as a whole still suffered from an image problem. The labour laws are inflexible in India... the cost of firing is too high.

 As for India outstripping China in the near future ? a hope Bhattacharjee had expressed yesterday ? Goh felt the need to sound a caution: the dragon would put tremendous pressure on India to perform.

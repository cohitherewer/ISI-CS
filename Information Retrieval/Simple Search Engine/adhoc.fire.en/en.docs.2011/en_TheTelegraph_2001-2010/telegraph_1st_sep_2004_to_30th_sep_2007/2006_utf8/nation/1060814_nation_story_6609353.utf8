 Rehana takes trailblazing walk down the aisle

 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY

 Lucknow, Aug. 13: Rehana would have been just another Muslim woman getting married in a flower-decked, brightly lit hall swarming with gift- clutching guests and silver-maned clerics in flowing robes.

 But the bashful 18-year-old from Isallaul Muslimin, a social welfare organisation where she grew up after her biological parents abandoned her, had no idea she would walk down the aisle and a milestone. 

 Her marriage on Thursday to Samroz, a teacher in a Rae Bareli madarsa, was possibly the first in the country to be solemnised and recorded under the model nikaahnama, a wedding pact extolled by its authors as a charter of change but reviled by mostly women critics as a contract of oppression.

 Muslimin inmates always told Rehana she would be setting an example with her marriage. That distinction had hardly dawned on her until Idgaah Imam Khalid Rashid Firangee Mahli began reading out a 17-page pact, saying it was the new nikaahnama under which the wedding was being formalised.

 The meaning of the charter was explained, followed by the declaration that Rehana and Samroz had mutually agreed to be husband and wife.

 I dont know about other cities, but this is the first marriage in Lucknow and Uttar Pradesh under the model nikaahnama, which has long been introduced. We have a duty to popularise it, said Zafaryab Jilani, a senior member of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board and convener of the Babri Masjid Action Committee.

 The executive body of the Muslim personal law board, which drafted the document, cleared it with changes in January 2005. The boards general body meeting blessed it four months later.

 The three-part nikaahnama has sundry information about the couple, like the age, guardians permission for marriage and details of the mehr (gift) given to the bride. It also names witnesses as well as the qaazi (consent taker).

 That is not, however, where the problem is. It is in the provisions which almost legitimise child marriage, and in norms that require women to seek their husbands permission before stepping out of home.

 After the Bhopal meeting of the law board adopted the agreement in May last year, Muslim women organisations tore it into shreds in street marches to protest a document they say is steeped in misogyny.

 The All-India Muslim Women Personal Law Board even drafted another nikaahnama, but it is not clear if the document was ever used as an alternative.

 Purveen Abdi, general secretary of the womens law board, wants the new model nikaahnama to be purged of child marriage provisions before it is pushed down the throat of the ordinary Muslims. 

 Granting guardians the right to give permission for marriage, even if the couple happens to be minor, is repugnant. How could that be part of an agreement in modern times? she argues. 

 Shaista Ambar, social activist and Jan Morcha leader, says marriages under the new agreement, which oblige women to be obedient, should be discouraged.

 However, members of the personal law board contend the nikaahnama at least has a format for marriages to be registered. 

 So far, such agreements used to be whimsical or verbal and, in some cases, or non-existent, said Kamaryub Geelani of Isllaul Muslimin. 

 His organisation hopes many more women will walk Rehanas path.

 New Delhi, May 9: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today called on the youth to start nationwide yatras to mark the 150th anniversary of the 1857 uprising next year. 

 Singh said the uprising was an example of Hindu-Muslim unity. 

 Addressing a national youth convention, organised by the Nehru Yuva Kendra Sangathan, Singh proposed that as Meerut was the holy ground on which the first spark of the uprising was seen, young people should take out yatras from all over the country and converge in Meerut and march to Delhis Red Fort on May 10, the day of the rebellion. 

 The anniversary will be celebrated in the capital as part of a series of events, planned by the UPA government, to commemorate the milestones in Indias fight for Independence. 

 The striking feature of the 1857 revolt was that both Hindus and Muslims assiduously organised the front against foreign rule. Hindu-Muslim unity was visible among soldiers and people as well as among leaders, Singh said.

 The context for Singhs address was the introduction of the Enfield rifle by the East India Company. It required the bullet to be bitten before it was loaded. There were rumours that the bullets were greased with fat extracted from either cows or pigs, which struck at the core of Hindu and Muslim religious beliefs. 

 British historians describe it as the Sepoy Mutiny.

 Recently, the 1857 rebellion was the subject of the Aamir Khan starrer Mangal Pandey ? The Rising.

 The Prime Minister used the forum to speak of the need for religious cooperation. The frustrated elements that disturb the ethos of communal harmony must not be given any scope for having their aims achieved, he said while commending the architects of the Indian republic for declaring the country a secular state.

 They had the vision to recognise that India can prosper only as a secular society, as a country where there will be no discrimination against citizens on the basis of caste, religion and creed. The importance of communal harmony, I think, needs no reiteration. It is the sine qua non for our survival as a civilised polity, he stressed.

 Singh condemned the use of religion as a pretext for violence and said such acts caused disservice to faith and humanity. Tolerance is an important lesson for all religions, he said.

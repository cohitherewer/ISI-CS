 Two more in Mumbai blasts net

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, July 26: The anti-terrorist squad has arrested two more persons suspected to have links with the Lashkar-e-Toiba, taking the total suspects netted in the 7/11 bombings to six.

 They were produced in the Mazgaon metropolitan magistrates court today and were remanded in police custody till August 7.

 Zameer Ahmed Sheikh, a 31-year-old key-makers son from Lotus Colony in Worli, and 38-year-old Shaikh Sohail Mehmood, a resident of Bhimpura in Pune, were formally arrested late last night when the crime branch handed them over after interrogating them for over a week.

 The two were held under nine sections of the Indian Penal Code, including 120-B (conspiracy), the Indian Railways Act and the Indian Explosives Act.

 The ATS remand application said the duo had travelled to Pakistan in 2005 and were trained in handling sophisticated weapons and explosives similar to those used in the train blasts. Both were in contact with Tanvir Ahmed Ansari, a Unani medical practitioner arrested earlier.

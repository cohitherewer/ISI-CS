 Unesco hub to fill up biotech gap

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, July 16: Indias department of biotechnology will collaborate with Unesco to establish an Asian regional hub for education, training and research across frontier areas of biotechnology.

 India will invest Rs 40 crore in the regional centre ? to be located in New Delhi ? offering postgraduate education, doctoral and post-doctoral research opportunities, specifically in areas not available in existing institutions, officials said.

 One of the biggest handicaps we face today is the lack of teachers in the life sciences, said Maharaj Bhan, biotechnology secretary. This regional centre will be aimed at filling in this gap through short-term and long-term courses.

 India expects that the education and research activities at the proposed Unesco centre would also be funded by other member countries in the region such as Australia, China, South Korea, Japan and Singapore.

 Bhan said while the exact education models have yet to be worked out, in addition to long-term postgraduate programmes, the regional centre could also train life science teachers through short-term training modules. Were planning a unit that might concentrate on teaching teachers all the time. Perhaps, 500 teachers might be trained over a year.

 The centre is expected to begin education activities by February 2007.

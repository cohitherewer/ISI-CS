 Two in race for cabinet secretary

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 26: With the quota controversy more or less settled for the moment, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is likely to get down to the job of appointing new governors to replace those whose terms end shortly and finding a new cabinet secretary.

 The incumbent cabinet secretary, B.K. Chaturvedi, will retire on June 13. Political sources said the race for his successor has narrowed down to two names: Dhanendra Kumar and Adarsh Kishore.

 Kumar, a 1969 batch IAS officer, is from the Haryana cadre and is presently an executive director of the World Bank.

 Kishore is also from the 1969 batch and belongs to the Rajasthan cadre. He is secretary in the finance ministry and heads the expenditures department.

 Kumar has the backing of Chaturvedi and the Allahabad University network of bureaucrats who form a powerful lobby in the government. Kishores plus point is that he was on the wrong side of the BJP because of his stand on secularism when the NDA was in power. 

 A section of the Congress believes that if it has to detoxify the administration and weed out saffron sympathisers, it is important to appoint persons like Kishore in top positions.

 It is believed Chaturvedi is seriously looking at life after retirement. The buzz in the power corridors is he could get a World Bank assignment or a position as governor.

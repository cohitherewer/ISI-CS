 War room leak charges

 New Delhi, July 3 (PTI): Ravi Shankaran, a relative of Indian Navy chief Admiral Arun Prakash, and four former senior defence officials were today chargesheeted by the CBI in the naval war room leak case.

 The investigating agency filed the chargesheet against the five in the court of additional chief metropolitan magistrate Kanwaljeet Arora, who posted the matter for a July 10 hearing.

 The former defence officials chargesheeted are naval commander Kulbhushan Parashar, sacked naval comman-ders Vijender Rana and V.K. Jha, and ex-Indian Air Force wing commander S.L. Surve.

 Shankaran, against whom an Interpol red corner look-out notice is out, has been declared a proclaimed offender.

 The chargesheet says Shankaran, whom the court had asked to appear before the CBI on or before July 31, 2006, is hiding in Europe.

 Parashar, Shankaran, Surve and Rana were chargesheeted under Section 120-b (criminal conspiracy) of the IPC. 

 They have also been charged under the Official Secrets Act for allegedly entering into a conspiracy and compromising about 7,000 pages of sensitive defence information from the naval war room and air defence headquarters, which have a direct bearing on national security. 

 The case was registered by the CBI on March 20 on a reference from the defence ministry after an inquiry was held by the air force against Surve and another by the board of inquiry of the navy. 

 On April 5, Parashar was arrested at an airport on his return from London. 

 The CBI claimed in its 250-page chargesheet that the accused allegedly entered into a criminal conspiracy for collecting defence information calculated to be useful to the enemy, or which was prejudicial to the sovereignty and security of the state.

 The CBI told the court that it wanted to continue inves-tigations against those who were not chargesheeted today. The agency had carried out searches at 20 places on June 23.

 US go-slow on religious visas

 Washington, Nov. 29 (PTI): The US has announced a temporary suspension of the premium processing visa service for religious workers after detecting potential vulnerabilities, a move that will affect applicants from several countries, including India.

 The US citizenship and immigration service office of fraud detection and national security recently completed a fraud assessment for religious worker petitions that revealed significant issues and potential vulnerabilities.

 The suspension of the premium processing for religious workers under the R-1 non-immigrant visa application is for a period of six months beginning November 28.

 As a result of this assessment and to ensure the integrity of the religious worker programme, additional adjudication procedures are necessary, the department of homeland security has said in a statement.

 Mumbai, Nov. 13: Angelina Jolie today stopped being the elusive star and stood in a railway ticket queue, changed trains and took taxi and boat rides before hundreds of jostling onlookers.

 As the Mumbai leg of the shooting of A Mighty Heart began, the actor criss-crossed the southern parts of the city, donning curls to resemble Mariane, the wife of slain US journalist Daniel Pearl.

 The weeklong schedule kicked off with shots of Jolie and Dan Futterman, who plays Daniel, taking a walk in the morning along the Gateway of India promenade outside the Taj Mahal Hotel.

 The crew then moved to the Imperial hair salon -- tucked away in a lane behind the hotel that Daniel frequented while based in Mumbai as a Wall Street Journal correspondent.

 Wearing a lime-green top and pink sarong, Jolie did a few scenes as crowds and news photographers flocked to the site for their first glimpse of the actual shooting of the film. Heavy security had kept the media at bay during the shoots at Punes Sindh Society last month.

 Off to Colaba for a few scenes at the Palkhi restaurant, and the cast and crew were on their way again, followed by their security cars and photographers.

 From Colaba to the Air-India building and on to Girgaum Chowpatty till the motorcade took a sudden U-turn and stopped at Churni Road railway station.

 Jolie and Futterman walked in and slipped into the queue before a ticket counter. They boarded a second-class compartment, got down at the next station, Marine Lines, and took another train to the next, Churchgate.

 Jolies personal security followed the duo from a distance, their worried looks needing no explanation. Just four months ago, bombs had gone off in trains leaving Churchgate, killing 189 people and injuring over 750.

 Within hours of the afternoon shoot, Western Railway had started a massive security drill, frisking every commuter entering Churchgate in the evening peak hours.

 Between 5 pm and 8 pm, streams of passengers walked through 38 metal detectors to be scanned by over 220 railway police, aided by 80 hand-held devices, two X-ray machines and two sniffer dog squads.

 The film crew had packed up for lunch around 1 pm. Jolie and Futterman reappeared a few hours later at the Gateway of India and were filmed taking a boat ride. Then on to Ballard Pier, which houses several colonial-period office buildings, for the taxi ride scene.

 In the coming days, Jolie is likely to shoot at Mohammed Ali Road, a dense Muslim-dominated pocket in south-central Mumbai that would pass as a Karachi street in the film.

 She will be joined by actor Irrfan Khan, playing a Pakistani officer who helps Mariane search for her kidnapped husband.

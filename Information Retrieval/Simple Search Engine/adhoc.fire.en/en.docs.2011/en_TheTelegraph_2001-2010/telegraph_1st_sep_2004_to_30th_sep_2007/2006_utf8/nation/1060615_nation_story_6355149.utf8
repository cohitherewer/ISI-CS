 New Delhi, June 14: Rahul Mahajan slipped out unseen through a side gate of Tihar jail where he spent over a week but flashlights popped all around as he was reunited with a tearful mother Rekha at 7 Safdarjung Road.

 Rekha, who lost her husband Pramod Mahajan a month-and-a-half ago and suffered another blow when Rahul was caught up in the drug scandal, broke down and then embraced her son as they walked into the house, accompanied by Poonam.

 Rahuls sister spoke for the first time since the incident on the night of June 1-2, denying her brother was a drug addict and affirming her faith in the BJP, her late fathers party. 

 Poonam said: My brother is innocent. He has never taken drugs. We all are depressed because of what happened to our father.

 She dismissed reports of the BJP distancing itself from the Mahajans after the drug scandal, which claimed a life in Bibek Moitra, Pramod Mahajans secretary.

 The BJP has fully supported us. It is our family. BJP is in our blood, she said.

 Describing the scene at 7 Safdarjung Road, Gopinath Munde, Pramod Mahajans brother-in-law, said: Rekha is happy after all these days. Rahul will probably just eat something in 15 minutes before hitting the bed.

 Munde said Rahul, who arrived at the scene of an alleged drinks-and-drugs orgy wearing a white shirt and blue denim and sporting a scraggy beard, had told the family he was very tired.

 Emerging from the car that brought him from jail, he hugged Rekha.

 Earlier in the day, Poonam told reporters: We are happy and relieved to hear that he has got bail. Poonam declined to write off the political career of Rahul. You cannot say whether his future in politics is spoilt or not.

 Let him come back and speak to us and then we will decide.

 Me and my other family members just want to see him now. There was delay in getting bail as the police were harassing him and putting him under pressure.

 We have full faith in the judiciary and will fight out the case and he will be proved innocent.

 Reacting to the remarks of her jailed uncle Praveen, who shot her father, of Rahul being a spoilt young man, she said: He is an accused and I dont want to comment on his remarks. We will ensure that he gets the maximum punishment for his crime. 

 Asked why Rahul was taken to Apollo Hospital instead of a nearby hospital that night, Poonam said he was taken to a place which could offer the best healthcare.

 The Delhi government today convened a meeting of Apollos board of directors to be briefed about the case. It expressed unhappiness with the hospitals media handling. 

 The board was particularly cut up with the hospital administration for holding news conferences on the case. Usually, medical bulletins are issued.

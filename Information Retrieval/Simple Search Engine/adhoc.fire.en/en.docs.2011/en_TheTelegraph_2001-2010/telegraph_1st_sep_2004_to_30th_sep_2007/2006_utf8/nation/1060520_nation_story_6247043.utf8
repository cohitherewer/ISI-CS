 Cong for coalition in Chennai

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chennai, May 19: A week ago, Tamil Nadu was on the road to its first ever minority government. Today, the Congress put it on coalition course.

 In a surprising U-turn from its promise of unconditional support from outside to the DMK-led regime, the Congress today urged all Democratic Progressive Alliance partners to join hands with the government.

 In the interest of stability of the government and also to fulfil the expectations of the people of Tamil Nadu, other partners of the DPA (must) join hands with the government, associating with the cabinet and its various functions, it said in a resolution.

 The development came even as chief minister M. Karunanidhi was putting in place a minority team with support from its allies, including the Congress, PMK and Left parties. The DMK has 96 seats in the 234-member House.

 The Speaker and the deputy Speaker were elected today. They are Avudaiyappan and V.P. Duraiswamy, both from the DMK.

 The Congress also pitched for a common minimum programme on the lines of the UPA government at the Centre.

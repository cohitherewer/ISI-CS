 No cream for panel

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 8: The oversight committee, which is laying down a roadmap for implementing 27 per cent reservation for Other Backward Classes, has left it to the government to exclude the creamy layer if it wants to.

 We are not very concerned about the creamy layer. It was applicable in case of Mandal which gave the OBCs 27 per cent quota in jobs, the panels chairperson, Veerappa Moily, said today at the end of its third meeting.

 We have left it to the government to deal with it, the former Karnataka chief minister added.

 There is a strong lobby among academics that favours excluding the creamy layer. So does the CPM. But backward caste leaders like Sharad Yadav, of the Janata Dal (United), are against any move that would dilute the 27 per cent reservation. 

 Moily said his panel would have to go into overdrive to implement the 27 per cent quota by the next academic session. There are problem areas like infrastructure and manpower. But these can be overcome.

 The committee will submit an interim report by the end of August. In view of the urgency, we are planning to give an interim report so that the government can start acting on it before the 2007 academic session begins, he said.

 The government is treading with caution after the recent protests by medical students. The committee has decided to hold a national seminar on July 15 to get a wide range of opinion on the issue.

 We will invite 40-50 eminent personalities and experts for a brainstorming session. We want to have a national consensus on the issue, Moily said.

 Wait for students body gets longer

 OUR BUREAU AND AGENCIES

 Bokaro, Sept. 28: The grieving parents of murdered medical student Nitesh Kumar Singh will have to wait three more days for his body, which will be sent to Calcutta on October 1 by air and then taken to his hometown.

 Nitesh, a sixth-year student at the St Petersburg State Mechnikov Medical Academy, died on Sunday after being stabbed seven times in the chest by unidentified attackers. He was walking back to the hostel with friends but had stopped to buy bread.

 The condition of mother Shakuntla Devi has deteriorated as she has refused to take medicines until her sons body arrives. Shitesh, Niteshs elder brother, said doctors were giving her sedative injections at regular intervals to induce deep sleep as she kept fainting.

 The 27-year-olds killing is the latest in a series of hate crimes amid growing xenophobia in Russia. The murder has triggered unrest among Indian students, many of whom are from Bokaro. 

 The external affairs ministry described the killing as very unfortunate and said India had sought an urgent probe into the incident and security for its other nationals in Russia.

 About 150 students yesterday stopped Indias consul-general in St Petersburg Jordana Diengdoh Pavel on her way to work and escorted her to their dormitory to protest against inadequate security.

 Shitesh, a businessman, said the consul-general was not cooperating fully. Yesterday, the office of the consul-general sent a letter saying Niteshs body would reach Calcutta by Thursday. Today, the family was informed by C.D. Sarma, a consulate official, that the body would not reach India before Sunday.

 Nitish progress pill: drop the tum, say aap instead

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, July 25: Amid talks 

 that the Nitish Kumar administration was preparing to go 

 full throttle to meet its promises post-monsoon, the Bihar 

 chief minister today offered a three-way advice to his officers 

 to ensure smooth progress.

 Two of the suggestions made by Nitish ? a state of readiness to launch development schemes and ensuring a conducive law and order environment ? were repetitions of what the government had been saying since it came to office in November last year.

 But the third advice on etiquette, a fresh one, came when the chief minister asked a large assembly of bureaucrats to treat the common people with respect.

 Addressing a special meeting of all 38 district magistrates and superintendents of police today, Nitish was quoted as saying by a district magistrate: Aam janata ko tum nahin aap boliye, unko izzat dijiye (Address the common people as aap, not tum, give them respect).

 It is rare in the state that a bureaucrat, often addressed by the vast majority as huzoor, maalik or sahib, would return the address with a polite aap in the social hierarchy that is in vogue.

 Known to lack the rusticity often associated with the political class in Bihar, the chief ministers advice on polite behaviour as a key to effective administration ? what has become famous in the state as sushasan (good governance) ? was meant mainly for the district magistrates and superintendents of police.

 District magistrates and police superintendents are like the chief minister in the districts. They hold the key to good governance. Total coordination between them is necessary. I suggest they interact with each other on a regular basis, Nitish said.

 Proper coordination will help remove the roadblocks for development. Equally essential is regular monitoring of the governments welfare schemes by the district magistrates and superintendents of police. They should also report the progress to the headquarters in a routine manner, he added.

 The government has set an ambitious target by promising to fully utilise development funds in a financial year. This, senior bureaucrats feel, will not be possible unless the district officials adopt a pro-active approach.

 The chief minister said the officials should lay special emphasis on child development schemes. 

 Transparency, checking corruption and a pro-poor approach are necessary. Police should strive to ensure the rule of law in the state. Criminals should be firmly dealt with. An effective intelligence gathering system has to be developed and we are ready to provide the necessary help, he added.

 The district magistrates have been asked to stay put in the capital for a meeting with the heads of the various state departments tomorrow.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Headcount report on track

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 6: The Rajinder Sachar committee, set up by the Prime Ministers Office to collect data on the socio-economic and educational status of Muslims in India, is expected to meet its deadline and present its report in June. 

 The report will be tabled in Parliament in the monsoon session and, perhaps, be debated, as desired by the Congress and the Rashtriya Janata Dal.

 The seven-member panel was also mandated to collect information on the percentage of Muslims in the public and the private sector.

 This raised a controversy when the army seemed reluctant to part with the information on the ground that it might convey a wrong message and adversely affect the well-established cohesion, regimental spirit and morale of the force.

 When the BJP took up cudgels on the armys behalf, the government directed the committee not to ask questions that could touch a raw nerve.

 Once the army was virtually out of the committees loop, it is learnt that several public and private enterprises refused to divulge data for pretty much the same reasons.

 First of all, they said, they did not collate data based on caste and community and second, if they embarked on such an exercise to help the committee, the ramifications might be sensitive.

 A member of the committee said the response from data providers was lukewarm. But I wish to give them the benefit of the doubt. Our system is bureaucratic and often such data is not readily available. 

 Panel secretary S. Zafar Mehmood, however, said: Data is pouring in and we are in the process of compilation.

 The committees problem was compounded by the fact that five BJP governments were instructed by their Delhi bosses not to cooperate. 

 Senior party leader V.K. Malhotra said even BJP-partnered coalitions like in Orissa and Karnataka were advised to follow suit. 

 While Orissa chief minister Naveen Patnaik agreed, Malhotra said he was not sure what the chief ministers of Bihar and Karnataka, Nitish Kumar and H.D. Kumaraswamy, respectively, would do.

 The Gujarat governments urban development minister and spokesman, I.K. Jadeja, argued: We dont want to encourage a second Partition.

 Asked how the committee would 

 fill the information gaps, a member said: Doubtless, 

 we have had to double and treble our efforts. But there 

 are secondary sources from where the relevant figures and 

 facts are available.

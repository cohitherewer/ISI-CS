 Nuns and priests can be lawyers: Court

 JOHN MARY

 Thiruvananthapuram, March 21: Kerala High Court today ruled that nuns and priests cannot be barred from practising law just because they belong to the clergy.

 Chief Justice V.K. Bali and Justice J.B. Koshy upheld a single-judge benchs verdict, which the Bar Council of India had contested.

 There would be no restraint on the clergy, as a class professing religion, to enter the legal profession under bar council rules, the bench said. The division bench also concurred with the single-judge benchs observation that if priests and nuns join the bar, it would benefit ordinary people. 

 The state Bar Council had barred nun Tina Jose from enrolling as an advocate last year on the ground she was engaged in a religious profession and thus gainfully employed.

 While turning down Joses application for enrolment, the Kerala Bar Council Enrolment Committee had told her that the overcrowded bar would be worse off with such additions.

 The committee had taken a fee of Rs 4,800 from Jose on January 16 last year but had struck her name off the list. 

 Jose, Sister C.T. Tresa and Father Thomas Puthussery, backed by the church, had contested before the single-judge bench the denial of fundamental rights by the committee.

 There is no bar in this section of the people... in government or semi-government organisations. Moreover, the manner in which they have conducted themselves... in the profession has been great, the judge had said.

 Sister Tresa is from the Congregation of the Medical Sisters of St Francis of Assisi, Thiruvananthapuram, and Father Puthussery is from the Roman Catholic church in Irinjalakuda, Thrissur.

 Passports to come easy

 New Delhi, Dec. 25 (PTI): Acquiring passports will be easier from tomorrow with the government revising guidelines, which includes doing away with police verification in case of re-issue of the document. 

 An applicant will now be required to furnish only three out of 14 documents, including one with a photograph, according to the new guidelines aimed at reducing delays in passport issuance.

 A stamp of emigration check not required (ECNR) will also not be needed if an applicant is matriculate. The eligibility criteria for ECNR till now was graduation. 

 The government has also relaxed rules for obtaining certificates for waiver of police verification by extending the authorisation powers to under secretaries, tehsildars and station house officers, official sources said today. 

 No police verification would be needed for reissuing passports unless there is negative information concerning the applicant, they said. 

 Also, the passports will have to be re-issued within four days, the sources said. 

 Changes have been made to the Tatkal scheme, under which a passport will have to be issued within 14 days, instead of the 20 according to existing rules.

 A Tatkal passport may also be issued in seven days if an applicant pays Rs 500 extra. 

 Reissue of passport under the Tatkal scheme will have to be done within three days and the applicant will not have to cite reasons for applying for a Tatkal passport.

 The intention of the ministry of external affairs of doing away with the requirement of address verification for a passport applicant and depending only on the individuals identity has failed to take off because of opposition from the ministry of home affairs. 

 The external affairs ministry also intends to do away with the requirement of the five-year address proof for people born in Jammu and Kashmir and residing outside the state. This proposal has also been shot down by the home ministry. 

 The government is also examining suitable amendments to the Passports Act to allow stricter penalties against those obtaining passports by fraudulent means. 

 The government is also working 

 on the introduction of biometric passports that will have 

 a micro-processor storage device containing biometric features 

 like fingerprints of the holder and information concerning 

 the applicant.

 Meet fuels UP topple fears

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 3: Uttar Pradesh governor T.V. Rajeswar met Union home minister Shivraj Patil here today, triggering apprehension in the Samajwadi Party over the Centres plans to dismiss its government in the state.

 A couple of hours after the meeting, the BJP did its bit to mount pressure on Mulayam Singh Yadav. A party delegation, headed by Sushma Swaraj, called on President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam and handed him a memorandum demanding central rule in the state ahead of elections.

 Assembly elections are due early next year. Free and fair polls will not be possible if the present government continues. It will be possible only under Presidents rule, the memorandum said. 

 The six-page document listed examples of the states worsening law and order situation an issue understood to have been discussed in the talks between Patil and Rajeswar. However, there was no official word on the governors meeting.

 The talks follow the desecration of an Ambedkar statue in Kanpur, which triggered violence in Maharashtra and provided a handle to Mayavatis Bahujan Samaj Party to target the Samajwadi Party in Parliament. Some Congress MPs, too, had joined in the protest.

 A few days ago, Congress president Sonia Gandhi had said fair elections werent possible under Mulayam. Last month, the chief minister said the Centre was preparing to dismiss his government on the basis of a report sent by the governor. Raj Bhavan was quick to deny this, as was the Centre, in Parliament. 

 The BJP delegation to Rashtrapati Bhavan was to have been led by Rajnath Singh, but the party president headed to Bengals Singur, where villagers are protesting the acquisition of land for setting up a car plant. 

 Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, Vinay Katiyar, Keshari Nath Tripathi and Santosh Gangwar were in the group that met Kalam.

 The constitutional machinery in Uttar Pradesh has broken down. There is jungle raj and the administrative system has collapsed because of politicisation, the party told Kalam in the memorandum.

 The recent elections to local bodies in the state were not fair, the BJP said, adding that efforts were on to rig the Assembly polls, too.

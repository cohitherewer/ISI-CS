 New Delhi, Sept. 17: Shiv Shankar Menon may have won the big race for foreign secretary, but scramble season in South Block is by no means over. Needle contests are lined up for key diplomatic posts.

 The external affairs ministry is expected to wear a new look when Menon takes over as foreign secretary on November 1. By then new ambassadors may have been appointed at crucial missions in the neighbourhood Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bangladesh and China.

 A posse of hopefuls is chasing these assignments, because a stint in the neighbourhood can make a diplomats career. Serious lobbying is on for the post of high commissioner in Pakistan, which fell vacant after Menon was promoted.

 The front-runner at the moment is Satyabrata Pal, high commissioner in South Africa. He seems to have nudged out Nalin Surie, Delhis representative in Beijing.

 Surie is likely to be brought to the headquarters as secretary (east), replacing Rajiv Sikri, who resigned after being superseded by Menon to the foreign secretarys post.

 Surie could be replaced by Nirupama Rao, high commissioner in Colombo. Alok Prasad, the ambassador in Singapore, is likely to head for Sri Lanka.

 Delhis envoy in Nepal, Shiv Shankar Mukherjee, another beaten competitor in the race for foreign secretary, may also be transferred.

 Sources said Veena Sikri, wife of Rajiv Sikri and high commissioner in Bangladesh, could be made dean of the Foreign Service Institute, a post that will fall vacant in November with the retirement of Atish Sinha.

 Another important post secretary (west) will see a new face. Senior diplomat Neelkantan Ravi is in the fray to replace Shashi Tripathi, who is also on the way out after being superseded by Menon.

 The post of secretary (economic relations) will be up for grabs with incumbent Rinzing Wangdi being sent to Mexico as ambassador. 

 Officials said there will be changes at the joint secretary level, too, and new division heads will be named.

 The appointment to cap the shuffle that of a foreign minister could happen sometime soon with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh having indicated the possibility.

 The current foreign secretary, Shyam Saran, is continuing with his work on the Indo-US nuclear deal. He is in New York for talks with US under-secretary of state Nicholas Burns.

 After his return, he will visit Nuclear Suppliers Group members New Zealand, Ireland and Japan. He will work as the Prime Ministers special envoy on the nuclear deal after his retirement on October 31.

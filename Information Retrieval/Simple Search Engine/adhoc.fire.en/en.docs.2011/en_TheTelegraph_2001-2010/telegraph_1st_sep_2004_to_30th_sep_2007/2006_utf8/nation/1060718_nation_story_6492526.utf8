 Strike docs win salary battle 

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 17: The Supreme Court today directed the Centre to release the salaries of doctors who had called off their anti-reservation strike following an assurance from the government that no punitive action would be taken against them.

 The resident doctors at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences and Maulana Azad Medical College, who went on strike from May 14 to June 3, moved the court after the Centre withheld their pay for the period despite the undertaking in court.

 The doctors had struck work protesting the proposed Other Backward Classes quotas in institutions of higher learning.

 The court, however, made it clear today that the doctors would be entitled to salaries only for the period of the strike from May 14 to 30 ? the day the court requested them to join work. They would not be paid if they were absent after May 30.

 Pointing out that the Centre had gone by the principle of no work, no pay, additional solicitor-general Gopal Subramaniam said the departure from the principle should not be made a precedent. But the bench pointed out that the court had directed payment only on account of the undertaking given by the government before it. 

 The court said as a matter of law, it would not have approved the strike but an assurance that no action would be taken against the doctors if they called off the strike was given to the protesters. 

 The apex court had recorded Subramaniams submission in its May 31 order, noting that the government shall not take any punitive action for whatever has been done till the strikes etc are called off.

 Todays order did not come as a surprise to the government as the apex court had made it clear in its last hearing that the Centre was not justified in withholding the doctors salaries. 

 Please ask your government to be a model employer, the bench had told solicitor-general G.E. Vahanvati on July 5, while adjourning the hearing as he had sought time to consult the government. 

 On the health and family welfare ministrys refusal to release the salaries, the court had said: Was this concept of no pay not known to the government (at the time of making the commitment) ?

 Besides relying on this order for release of their salaries, the doctors had also relied on a statement by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh stating that no action would be taken against them.

 The court has already ruled that internship of medicos on strike for over the 15 days should not be deemed extended so as to make them ineligible for admission to post-graduate courses.

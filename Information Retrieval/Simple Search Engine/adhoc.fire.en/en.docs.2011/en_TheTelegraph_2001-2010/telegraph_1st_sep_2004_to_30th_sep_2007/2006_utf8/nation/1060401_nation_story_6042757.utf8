 Dash for defence purchases

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 31: In a hurry to meet the budget-imposed deadline, the Cabinet Committee on Security has cleared military purchases of about Rs 7,000 crore in meetings that concluded on the last day of the financial year today.

 The CCS is understood to have decided to fast-track the acquisition of Sukhoi 30 aircraft that are licence-produced by the defence public sector Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) in Bangalore. 

 The acquisition programme was being cut short by about five years, sources said, after the Indian Air Force projected that in the next seven years, its phasing out of aircraft would impose pressures on maintainability of its squadron strength.

 Rescheduling the Sukhoi 30 acquisition programme means that the government has had to make arrangements to fast-track pay-outs also, but figures were not immediately available. 

 The IAF has an authorised strength of 39.5 squadrons but was teetering close to a situation when the fighter fleet would be much depleted. MiG-21 type 69 and MiG-23 fighter aircraft are due to be phased out of service.

 Defence minister Pranab Mukherjee said the CCS has cleared three projects:

 20 light combat aircraft (Tejas) to be manufactured by HAL for Rs 2,439 crore. The aircraft are still being developed. The commitment of the funds means that HAL has been given the order and the IAF is factoring the induction of the aircraft in the development of its fighter fleet.

 20 Jaguars to be produced by HAL at a cost of Rs 2,442 crore. HAL is to manufacture and fit spares as well within this amount for the deep penetration ground attack aircraft of the IAF. The Jaguars are licence-produced by HAL.

 The Coast Guard will place an order for five inshore patrol vessels with Hindustan Shipyard, Visakhapatnam, for Rs 219 crore.

 Todays clearances come quickly after the CCS yesterday approved the acquisition of 20 Dhruv advanced light helicopters for the army for about Rs 955 crore, seven central acquisition radars from Bharat Electronics Limited for the air force for Rs 275.6 crore and vehicles for new artillery guns that have been upgraded from 130 mm to 155 mm calibre for Rs 535 crore.

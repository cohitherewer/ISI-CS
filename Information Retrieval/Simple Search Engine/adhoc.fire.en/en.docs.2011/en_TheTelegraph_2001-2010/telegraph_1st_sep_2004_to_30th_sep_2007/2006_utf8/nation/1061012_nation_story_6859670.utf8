 CAS nod to 11 players in Calcutta

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 11: Twenty-one cable companies have been allowed to operate under the conditional access system (CAS), and 11 of those that passed muster would cater to Calcutta.

 The 11 firms, most of them based in Calcutta, will operate within the city limits.

 These companies are multi-system operators (MSOs), which send signals to cable operators. They have, however, received provisional permission. A clearance from security agencies and the Centre is needed for the final nod.

 The information and broadcasting ministry, which gave the permission, had received 35 applications, of which 14 firms were told to return with clarifications.

 Siti Cable and Hathway Cable and Datacom are among the big companies to have bagged the clearance for three cities each. 

 The list also includes IndusInd Media, Star Broadband Services, Spectra Net, Howrah Cable Network, Silver Line Broadband, Kolkata Cable amp; Broadband Pariseva, CableComm Services and Indian Cable Net Company.

 Progress towards CAS had figured in a meeting of the consultative committee. I amp;B minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi told MPs the roll-out was smooth.

 CAS has to be implemented in notified areas of Delhi, Calcutta and Mumbai by December 31. 

 The system, which allows viewers to pay only for the channels they choose to watch by routing signals through a set-top box, has already made its debut in Chennai.

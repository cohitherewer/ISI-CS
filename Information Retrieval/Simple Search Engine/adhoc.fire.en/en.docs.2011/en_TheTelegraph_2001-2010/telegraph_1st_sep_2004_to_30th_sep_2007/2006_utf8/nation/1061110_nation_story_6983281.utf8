 America upbeat about nuclear deal

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mulford: Nuke assurance

 New Delhi, Nov. 9: The Bush administration today expressed confidence that the election results will not come in the way of the nuclear deal, but was unsure if the bill to implement it would be passed in the lame-duck session of the Senate next week.

 US ambassador David Mulford pointed out that top Democrats have come out in support of the pact in the past 24 hours since their party swept the Congress elections. Among them are Senator Joseph Biden, who will head the Senates foreign relations panel, and Tom Lantos, who will head the House of Representatives panel. Biden said the lawmakers were ready to go with the India bill when Congress returned to work next week.

 But Mulford cautioned that lame-duck sessions primarily take up money bills so that the government can continue to operate. Lame-duck sessions are hard to predict. 

 President George W. Bush had said yesterday that the India bill, the Vietnam bill and the budget would be the priority of his administration during the session beginning on November 13.

 Mulford said it was difficult to predict how long the Senate will meet or the time it would take to pass the bills, but said the prognosis looked good as there was a broad consensus among Republicans and Democrats.

 The Vietnam bill was likely to take more time than the nuclear deal, he said. But if the deal gets stuck on some amendments, the bill would have to wait for the new Congress to sit in January next year. That will mean re-starting the entire legislation process. 

 Amid uncertainty in Washington on the deal that would allow India access to civilian nuclear technology, a US team is in Delhi to work out the bilateral civil nuclear pact, also known as the 123 agreement. The team includes officials from the state department, the national security council and the defence department, policy makers, legal experts and nuclear regulators.

 US assistant secretary of state for South and Central Asia, Richard Boucher, also arrived in Delhi today. 

 High-profile visitors from the US are expected to arrive in the coming weeks, including executives of 200 companies later this month. This is the biggest US trade delegation to any country in the world, Mulford said.

 Representatives of companies dealing in nuclear technology will be part of the trade mission. A fairly large group of companies, many of which are in nuclear supply and technology business, have elected to come to Delhi to see people here and pursue interests here, Mulford said.

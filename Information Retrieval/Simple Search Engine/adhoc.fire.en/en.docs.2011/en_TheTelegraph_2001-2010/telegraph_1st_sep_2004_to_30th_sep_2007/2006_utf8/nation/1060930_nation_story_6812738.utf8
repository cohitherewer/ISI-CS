 Army amp; govt in Belgaum land war

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Bangalore, Sept. 29: The Karnataka government has run into another row in Belgaum.

 The army claims that the land the state government has chosen to house its winter legislature sessions belongs to it and it has deployed troops to protect the plot.

 After the Centre withdrew its affidavit before the Supreme Court, which is hearing a petition filed by Maharashtra to include Belgaum and other Marathi-speaking areas into its fold, the Karnataka government rushed to hold a legislature session in Belgaum, the first outside Bangalore.

 During the five-day session that began on Monday, the government declared it would build a Suvarna Soudha in Belgaum, resembling Bangalores Vidhana Soudha.

 No sooner was the announcement made and the site picked, the Maratha Light Infantry Regimental Centre sent its troops to guard its 721 acres.

 We have been using the land for training and also to produce grass and hay for defence use. The army has been in possession of 755 acres in Turkmatti Kuran since 1873. Out of this, 20 acres were transferred to the ICMR in September 1984 and 14 acres to the PWD in June 1978. Currently, around 721 acres are in the armys possession, said Col. M.A. DSouza, deputy commandant, Maratha Light Infantry Regimental Centre.

 The state government has disputed the claim. Revenue officers said the land was leased to the army for a period of 99 years, which expired in 1972. However, they had no answer when asked why the state government did not take possession of the land after the lease expired.

 DSouza countered that as per the records available, the army has the legal authority over this land. It cannot be given to the state government.

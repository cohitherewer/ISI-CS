 Pranab music to Beijing ears

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 15: A day after rejecting Chinas claim to Arunachal Pradesh, Pranab Mukherjee played down differences between the two countries and stressed the importance of good ties.

 India-China relations can no longer be seen in the context of balance of power or conflict of interests, the foreign minister said.

 Mukherjees remarks at the National Defence College come a week ahead of Chinese President Hu Jintaos visit.

 The India-China relationship, he said, is bound to become one of the most important globally because of the sheer size of the two neighbours populations and economies.

 How we manage this relationship will have a tremendous impact on peace and stability in the regional and, increasingly, the global context.

 The minister (in picture) admitted to differences between the two sides but said they should not be allowed to affect overall development.

 India and China have been at odds on several issues, including the territorial dispute over Arunachal and Delhis regulations on investments from Beijing in infrastructure.

 Mukherjee said Indias foreign policy will in the coming years focus on improving ties with all its neighbours, from Afghanistan to Myanmar.

 A major power has hardly ever emerged or sustained itself on the world scene from amidst a conflict-ridden and impoverished neighbourhood.

 He called to the neighbours to allow themselves to benefit from Indias economic progress. He cited how Bhutan, Maldives and Sri Lanka had already gained from Indias successes.

 Mukherjee said relations with Pakistan stood at the crossroads, but although it is not possible for us to change borders, we can surely reduce the salience of borders in our relationship.

 If, on the other hand, terrorism is perceived and practised as an instrument of statecraft, then the most imaginative diplomacy will founder on lack of domestic support.

 The minister was satisfied with the growth of Indo-US ties and spoke of a bigger economic element to them in the coming years. The nuclear deal reflects a maturity in the relationship, he said.

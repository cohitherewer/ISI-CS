 New Delhi, June 19: The National Commission for Women wants all those punished who watched pop singer Mika kiss item girl Rakhi Sawant and treated it as a joke.

 Rakhi has filed a police complaint against Mika, alleging he forcibly kissed her at his birthday party on June 10, but the womens panel thinks the onlookers deserve punishment as much as the singer.

 We have asked TV channels to send us the footage of the party so as to identify guests who made fun of the incident. Action should be taken against all those (people) for treating the matter lightly, commission chairperson Girija Vyas said.

 It is not a matter of an individual or of Rakhi alone. This is a symbolic case through which we want to make it clear that women cannot be treated as objects. What we have seen on TV has left us stunned. It is clearly a case of sexual assault.

 Vyas said that had it been her, she would have slapped Mika before going to the police. I would have slapped him then and there.

 Vyas, however, was silent about the footage being repeatedly telecast by the news channels.

 The commission has asked Mumbai police to submit a report on what action they have taken on Rakhis complaint.

 Besides lodging a first information report (FIR) against Mika under Sections 354 (teasing a woman) and 323 (physical assault), Rakhi had moved the commission.

 Mika, brother of Punjabi pop singer Daler Mehndi, has obtained anticipatory bail.

 Rakhi was recently in the news when her stage shows in interior Maharashtra were cancelled after protests against her obscene dancing.

 Congress scanner on Singhs style

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 New Delhi, May 12: The signature campaign may not have reached anywhere yet but a view is emerging in the Congress that Prime Minister Manmohan Singh should refashion his style and appear more responsive to peoples needs and aspirations.

 Congress leaders believe that although Sonia Gandhi has nipped in the bud Ajit Jogis demand for making her Prime Minister, the last has not been heard on the matter.

 It (Jogis letter to Sonia) has led to a discussion on the governments domestic and international policies, the need to identify the weak areas and what mid-course correctives need to be taken, a Congress leader said.

 Human resource development minister Arjun Singh is expected to urge Sonia to convene a meeting of the Congress Working Committee shortly to discuss inflation and the policies that are perceived as anti-people. 

 Inflation has been inching up but it is still at a relatively low 3.5 per cent but Arjun ? who has emerged as a rallying point of sorts for the governments critics and the Congresss disgruntled elements ? can say the issue is in public interest.

 The CWC would have met after the Parliament session. But rather than make it a poll post-mortem, sources said, Singh would like to convert it into a looking-ahead session.

 We have to fight another slew of Assembly elections next year in Uttar Pradesh, Uttaranchal, Gujarat, Punjab and Himachal Pradesh. The Congress president is as worried as the rest of us are on what impact the governments policies have had in these states, a source said. The meeting is likely to take place on May 26.

 The Congress feels that Sonia should leverage her record Rae Bareli victory to push through the partys agenda with the government, instead of leaving it to the Prime Minister. 

 While nobody in the CWC is expected to raise direct questions on Singh or his governments performance, sources said the issues Arjun would bring to the Congress presidents notice would amount to a critique. 

 The Congress hopes to persuade the Prime Minister to speak the language of the people, stress on growth with equity instead of just growth and put in place a more active mechanism for coordination between the government and the party.

 He should recognise the reality that as a party, we have to fight elections again and again and get re-elected. He cant use the excuse that the government does not exist only for fighting elections, said a source. In the past, Singh had explained to the Left that government policies were not always meant to win elections. 

 While Singh is reportedly thinking of inducting a foreign policy adviser in the Prime Ministers Office, the Congress feels he needs a stronger political presence to interface with the party and get independent feedback.

 Divestment rumbles in TN

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Chennai, June 25: The DMK is opposed to the Centres decision to divest 10 per cent shares in Neyveli Lignite Corporation, the public-sector lignite mining and power generation giant in Tamil Nadu.

 The party, a key Congress ally at the Centre, has decided to back trade unions in their indefinite strike at Neyveli Lignite Corporation (NLC) plants from July 4. 

 Tamil Nadu chief minister M. Karunanidhi is not the first to urge the Manmohan Singh government to reconsider its divestment decision. The Left parties had also expressed reservations about the proposed dilution of government equity at Neyveli Lignite Corporation and Nalco in Orissa.

 I am not aware what views the DMK MPs have expressed at the recent cabinet committee on economic affairs (meeting) as some of the DMK nominees in the Union cabinet were abroad. But as the leader of the party and as chief minister, I have faxed a message to the Prime Minister today to review the decision on NLC, Karunanidhi told reporters after a meeting of the DMKs district secretaries. 

 He said the UPAs common minimum programme mentioned that profit-making PSUs would not be sold off. 

 Referring to the Lefts opposition, the chief minister said: The views raised opposing the disinvestment of 10 per cent share in NLC cannot be ignored by the central government. 

 Karunanidhi made it clear that any deviation from the common minimum programme, whatever reasons we may give, would amount to diluting the already agreed principles. 

 During the recent Assembly election campaign in Tamil Nadu, the Prime Minister had said that like-minded governments in both Delhi and Chennai would augur well for development in the state. But this is the first major issue after the polls and the DMK finds itself pitted against the Centre. 

 However, Karunanidhi does not think the move by the CPM and CPI to try to revive a third front at the national level poses any threat to the stability of the Congress-led government. Let it take shape first, then we will see, he said, when asked if his party would support such a front. 

 On the Sri Lanka crisis, the chief minister said there was no word from the Prime Ministers Office on when national security adviser M.K. Narayanan would come to Chennai for discussions with him.

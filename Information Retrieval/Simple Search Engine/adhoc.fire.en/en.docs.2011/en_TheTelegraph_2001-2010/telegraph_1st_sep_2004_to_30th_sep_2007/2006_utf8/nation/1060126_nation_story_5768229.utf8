NATION BRIEFS

 Patiala, Jan. 25: Gopal Krishan Kashyap, who set himself on fire to protest the failure of the authorities to rehabilitate displaced hawkers, died in hospital today, says our correspondent. 

 The death was announced after chief minister Amarinder Singh, holidaying in Delhi, returned. 

 A magisterial inquiry has been ordered. But Patiala residents are sceptical.

 Everybody knows what is going on here. The land mafia has been provided the red carpet to gobble up spaces and the common man has no other way to express displeasure. We are being thrown out from everywhere. Does anyone care? said Balbir Mann, a shopowner.

 Lucknow: Allahabad High Court cleared on Wednesday the way for former Uttar Pradesh chief secretary Neera Yadavs trial in corruption cases. The CBI does not need the states permission to prosecute the IAS officer, it said. 

 Kandahar (AP): Militants threw a grenade at the Indian consulate here on Wednesday, but it hit the boundary wall and exploded on the road outside, officials said. No one was injured. 

 New Delhi: The UKs Royal Air Force will be flying its fighter aircraft in mock combat drills for the first time since the British transferred power in August 1947. A squadron of Tornado aircraft will be deployed for an exercise with the Indian Air Force in October.

 Mumbai, Dec. 5: Mumbai police have roped in the Border Security Force for the first time in the city as part of security arrangements for B.R. Ambedkars death anniversary tomorrow.

 One company of the BSF will be stationed at Sena Bhavan.

 Joint commissioner of police (law and order) Arup Patnaik said: More or less, the pattern of security will be the same as every year, but in the backdrop of the Khairlanji issue and last weeks riots, the deployment of paramilitary forces will be stepped up. Previously, Chaitya Bhoomi used to be our main priority, but this time the eastern and central suburbs will also have policemen deployed at various places.

 Over five lakh followers converge every year at Chaitya Bhoomi the site where Ambedkars last rites were held on the occasion of his death anniversary. This year being the 50th anniversary, the number is expected to double.

 We are taking extra pains to ensure that the day passes without any incident. An advisory has also been received from the Intelligence Bureau as the day coincides with the anniversary of the demolition of the Babri Masjid, Patnaik said.

 Over 15,000 policemen will be deployed to maintain law and order tomorrow. Seven deputy police commissioners and two additional commissioners from the anti-terrorist squad, special branch and the riot control and the economic offences wings will supervise security on a day which would also witness the annual urs (religious gathering) at the Baba Magdoomi Dargah in the city.

 At least 10 companies of the state reserve police, three companies from the Rapid Action Force and the Central Reserve Police Force along with home guards, volunteers from NGOs and over 2,000 extra police personnel will be part of the security arrangements, said a senior police official.

 The state has decided to keep schools and colleges closed tomorrow.

 The police have also set up 15 watchtowers. Two control rooms will be set up inside Shivaji Park. Twenty-two closed-circuit TVs and six giant screens to watch live darshan at Chaitya Bhoomi have been installed. Officers in plainclothes will also be on duty and people will be frisked.

 The Deccan Queen, five coaches of which were torched by mobs on the outskirts of the city on November 30, resumed running on the Mumbai-Pune route today. Central Railway suffered a loss of about Rs 5 crore.

 It also had to return Rs 150,000 on account of refund on tickets.

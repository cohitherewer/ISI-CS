 Health worry at Castro absence

 ASHIS CHAKRABARTI

 Havana, Sept. 15: Cuban leader Fidel Castro failed to appear at the inaugural ceremony of the NAM summit here this morning, fuelling fresh speculation about his health.

 His brother, Raul, whom he had named temporary successor following his intestinal surgery on July 30, received the heads of governments.

 Castros participation was always doubtful, but after Kofi Annan, the UN secretary-general, and Hugo Chavez, President of Venezuela, yesterday met him, there were hopes here about the Cuban leader making it to the summit, even if briefly. 

 For a gathering of such a scale, Havana looked rather listless. Nowhere in the streets are the usual spectacles of flags, festoons and banners that go with such events elsewhere. 

 There is no mistaking, though, the undercurrent of tension about the future, especially in view of the Bush administrations threat of interference in the eventual transition in Cuba.

 If Castros absence from the NAM inauguration put new question marks on his health, brother Raul sought to make up for it. It was Rauls first public appearance since he was appointed Castros successor.

 In his speech, Raul predictably made the US the target of his attack. With Chavez and Raul calling the shots at the summit, it is poised to be a rallying cry for anti-Americanism and anti-globalisation. Free trade, Raul said, is a mere illusion.

 A message of hope about Castros health came in a 90-minute interview he gave yesterday to an Argentine writer-politician, Miguel Bonasso, from his sick bed in an undisclosed location.

 I walked down the hallway as in the travelling shot of a film, Bonasso wrote in an article, in which the tension builds up as the character moves.

 First his bodyguards dressed in olive green, then his personal and perpetually kind-hearted physician and at the end of the long corridor, a trio composed of two women and a tall man, all three dressed in white gowns. Doctors, nurses?

 When he was finally escorted into the Castros room Bossano found Castro him sitting in bed, with a white table and a mobile phone in front of him. A thick book was on the table: A Hundred Hours with Fidel. Castro was apparently going through the revised, and yet unpublished, book by Ignacio Ramonet. 

 Castro stood up to give the Argentine writer, who is here as a member of his countrys NAM delegation, to give him a hug. 

 I lost 41 pounds, Castro said, but Im putting the weight back on. Nearly half of what I lost. 

 PM proposal

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh proposed to the gathering that NAM set up two working groups one for West Asia and another for energy security. India would be prepared to chair the group on energy security, he said. 

 In conformity with the sentiment in NAM on the West Asian crisis, Singh said the tragic and pointless war in Lebanon has only sharpened the sense of alienation and resentment, brutalising a country that just begun to reclaim its heritage of inter-ethnic and inter-religious harmony after years of conflict.

 Singh suggested that a suitable high-level group be formed to promote understanding in the region and assist in establishing peace.

 He called on NAM to back Indias effort for universal nuclear disarmament, a document on which will be circulated at the UN General Assembly later this month. He also wanted NAM to take an unequivocal stand against terrorism.

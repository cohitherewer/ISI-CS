 Jindal turns makeshift midwife

 K.P. NAYAR

 Washington, Aug. 16: Indian American Congressman Bobby Jindals ambition was to become a doctor. He ended up being a politician.

 But in the early hours of Tuesday, Jindals childhood ambition was realised in part in real life. 

 His wife Supriya went into labour around 3 am on Tuesday. When she woke up in pain, Jindal (in picture below) summoned an ambulance to take her to hospital. 

 But the ambulance took time to arrive. Little Slade Ryan Jindal was in no mood to wait.

 Desperate, Jindal called up Supriyas doctor and a nurse at the doctors office coached the Congressman to be a midwife for this emergency.

 Jindal helped deliver his little son to the point of tying the babys umbilical cord with a shoestring.

 We certainly did not expect this, the rising Indian American star of US politics said later. We thought we had more time than we did. 

 Slade Ryan Jindal weighed 8 pounds and 2 ounces, 21 inches in length. Both the mother and baby are well. Jindals two older children slept through all this.

 Ironically, Supriya had been to the hospital twice in the last week even on Monday with pains but the hospital sent her away saying the baby was not due for another two days.

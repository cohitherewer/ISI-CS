 New Delhi, Sept. 29 (PTI): The University Grants Commission has decided to remove the cap on teachers appointments in colleges under Delhi University.

 The commission has informed the Delhi University Teachers Association about the decision taken on Tuesday, association president Amar Deo Sharma said. The UGC had earlier put an 85 per cent cap on teachers appointment in these colleges.

 The commission has requested the HRD ministry for an additional budget for these appointments, its letter said.

 The decision was taken after the teachers association submitted a nine-point charter of demands to the UGC.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Left breather for Delhi

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 12: The CPM will wait till the Assembly elections are over before moving on to the next stage of conflict with the government over its economic and foreign policies.

 The next stage, though, remains nebulous with the party unwilling to do anything that might threaten the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) governments survival.

 For the time being, we will concentrate on the Assembly elections. There will be further discussions within the party after the polls on our differences with the UPA government, a central committee member said.

 The five poll-bound states are Bengal, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Assam and Pondicherry. The CPM has nothing at stake except in Bengal and Kerala, where its chances are bright.

 Kerala, however, continues to be a headache for the party central leadership with factionalism continuing to thrive between the two groups led by V. Achuthanandan and Pinarai Vijayan. Both are eyeing the chief ministers chair.

 The CPM politburo has discussed the national political situation ? that is, the tension between the party and the government on foreign and economic policies. But in the end, it has decided to stick to the old strategy of raising contentious issues in and outside Parliament.

 Yesterday, Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury had told the media the party had to support the Centre because of political compulsions.

 Uttaranchal governor returns profit bill

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, April 3: The Congress government in Uttaranchal suffered a setback in the office-of-profit controversy when governor Sudarshan Agarwal today returned a bill seeking to amend the Uttaranchal Prevention of Disqualification Act, 1971.

 Governor T.V. Rajeswar in neighbouring Uttar Pradesh gave his assent to a similar bill last month on the rationale that states had the right to bring in amendments to their laws.

 Like the Uttar Pradesh bill, the one in Uttaranchal was passed in the state Assembly by a voice vote on March 27.

 However, Agarwal returned the bill to the government, saying it did not clearly define office of profit and those outside its purview. The bill, his office is believed to have pointed out, did not give full information on the offices of profit that exist in Uttaranchal.

 Congress sources said Agarwal, who has a BJP background, wanted to embarrass the Congress government. He cannot probably reject the bill outright but can delay it till the UPA government at the Centre tables a bill on it, said a Congress minister. 

 If the Assembly sends the bill to the governor again, he has to clear it.

 When Uttaranchal Speaker Yashpal Arya told the Assembly today that Agarwal had returned the bill without giving his assent, the announcement was welcomed by the members of the Opposition BJP, BSP and other smaller parties with thumping of desks.

 The government had tabled the bill in the face of demands by the BJP, BSP and the Left parties for the resignation of 14 Congress MLAs allegedly holding offices of profit. There were no complaints to the Election Commission against the 14 MLAs but they came under fire from the Opposition.

 Raising the issue at zero hour, BJP leader Prakash Pant demanded that the Speaker bar the entry of these MLAs.

 The Speaker said the House was not competent to disqualify the members and that only the governor was a competent authority. Pant then asked the Speaker to forward his plea to the governor.

 The Congress MLAs allegedly holding the offices of profit include Vijay Pal Singh Sajwan, Dinesh Agarwal, Phool Singh Bist, Kunwar Pranav Singh, Ganesh Godiyal, Anusuiya Prasad Maikhuri, Ramprasad Tamta, Pratap Singh Bist, Pradip Tamta, Shailendra Mohan Singhal, Gopal Singh Rana, Narayan Ram Arya, Jot Singh Gunsola and Ram Prakash. The MLAs have claimed that they were not holding the offices of profit as they do not get any emoluments from them.

 Ganesh Godiyal said: The BJP is using the governor, who hails from the same background, to humiliate the Congress MLAs.

 While the N.D. Tiwari government had tried to follow the Uttar Pradesh governments move to bring an amendment, it failed to meticulously identify offices of profit and provide a list of the same, said Raj Bhavan sources.

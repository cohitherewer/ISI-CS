 Doctors in dock for Rahul report

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 1: Six doctors of Apollo Hospitals have been named in a chargesheet filed by Delhi police for misleading investigations into the Rahul Mahajan drug abuse case. 

 Six management employees of Apollo, including a managing director, also face the same charge. 

 Sudhanshu Mittal and Harish Sharma both close acquaintances of Rahuls late father Pramod Mahajan have been named for destroying evidence of drug abuse. 

 The chargesheet, filed before additional chief metropolitan magistrate Kamini Lau today, alleged that the management and doctors of Apollo, where Rahul was admitted after an apparent drug overdose in June, deliberately gave a false toxic report. 

 The police said it was done to mislead the investigating agency and prevent it from taking legal action against the accused.

 The six doctors named in the chargesheet Anupam Sibal, Mukund Pandey, Abha Gupta, Prasad Rao, Avdesh Bansal and Ali Mohammad Gani were part of the core team that treated Rahul. 

 The police claimed that the drug toxicity test carried out after collecting Rahuls urine samples showed the presence of opiates above normal, but the hospital still certified it as normal.

 Apollo said it would respond to the chargesheet on November 4.

 Delhi police decided to go ahead with the chargesheet after questioning three senior doctors on June 20. The police also decided to seek prosecution of the doctors and management for protecting Rahul.

 The police had raised a finger at Apollo even in their first chargesheet, which accused Rahul and five others of financing illicit trafficking and possessing contraband for personal consumption.

 It has also been revealed that the doctors at Apollo Hospitals have deliberately misled the police regarding the treatment and state of the health of accused Rahul Mahajan, the chargesheet had said.

 Rahul and friend Bibek Moitra were admitted to Apollo on the intervening night of June 1 and 2. While Bibek was declared brought dead, Rahul underwent treatment at the intensive care unit.

 The police have accused Rahul of using Pramod Mahajans official residence at 7 Safdarjung Road for consuming drugs. Sahil Zaroo, a Mumbai student from whom Rahul is believed to have bought the drugs, was charged with trafficking under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act.

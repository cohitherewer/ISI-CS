 Abu cloud on Sanjay show

 SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI

 Mumbai, Jan. 5: Sanjay Dutts troubles dont seem to end.

 An executive of Sahara One told The Telegraph that the channels game show, Mission Ek Crore Ka, would see a delayed launch because of the actors pre-occupation with the courts following Abu Salems extradition.

 Sanjay has not yet given us the dates for shoots of the show. He is having to make frequent court appearances after Salems extradition. It is clear we wont be able to go on air with the show in January as planned, said the source involved with the show.

 The promos of the show are, however, already on air.

 But Sahara One chief operating officer Purnendu Bose said the decision to launch the game show in March was because of its special format and not because of Sanjays schedule. 

 Sanjay is best suited for our show which is focused more on the winners entertaining capabilities than on his knowledge. He has a widespread appeal and is loved by all. The show has not been delayed. We made a conscious decision to not launch the show along with money-based game shows by other channels. It is definitely happening and will go on air around March-end, said Bose.

 Sonys Deal ya No Deal, anchored by Madhavan, is on air while Zee TVs Kam Ya Zyaada, hosted by Manoj Bajpai, will hit the small screen this month. 

 Will Sanjays name cropping up many times in connection with the Bombay blasts ever since Salems extradition affect Sahara Ones show? I dont see why it should? He has already suffered for this and has spent time in jail. We were aware of such issues when we zeroed in on him. The past is behind him, said Bose.

 But to add to Sanjays woes, his name cropped up again today during the interrogation of Salem aide Riyaz Siddiqui by the CBI.

 Siddiqui told the CBI that Sanjay received an AK-56 assault rifle from a cache of arms he brought from Gujarat on the advice of prime conspirator Anees Ibrahim in January 1993.

 Riyaz said he met Salem in Gujarat. The don was already present there and the duo drove back to Mumbai in separate vehicles laden with arms and ammunition, which later reached the blast accused, including Sanjay, he claimed.

 The CBI told the designated Tada court about Siddiquis visit to Gujarat and the subsequent delivery of arms to the blast accused while seeking Salems custody.

 The court is now hearing the 1993 Bombay blast case. The judgment was expected last month but Salems extradition and emerging new evidence will delay the verdict by some more months.

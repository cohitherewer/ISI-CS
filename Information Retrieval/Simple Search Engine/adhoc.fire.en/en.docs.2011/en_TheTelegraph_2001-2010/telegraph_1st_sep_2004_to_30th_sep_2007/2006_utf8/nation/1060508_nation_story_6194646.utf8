 Lalu sounds Mayavati

 Lalu Prasad, Mayavati 

 New Delhi, May 7: Eager to settle scores with Mulayam Singh Yadav, Lalu Prasad is trying to sew up an alliance with Mayavati for the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections early next year.

 The Bahujan Samaj Party chief has, however, yet to respond to the offer, sources in Lalu Prasads Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) said.

 Although the RJD does not have much of a presence in the state, Lalu Prasad could work his charm with the masses to help Mayavati win over Muslims and a section of the other backward classes, a BSP leader said. The railway ministers charisma could work especially in the districts bordering Bihar.

 For the time being, however, Mayavati is said to be reluctant to hold the hands of the Yadav leader of Bihar to unseat the Yadav chief minister of Uttar Pradesh. Behenji has always insisted on fighting the elections independently. And then it is too early for the party to decide on the RJDs offer, the BSP leader said.

 Relations between the two started improving after the BSP, with its four MLAs in Bihar, decided to vote for RJDs Rajniti Prasad in the Rajya Sabha elections about a month ago. The last-minute decision helped Lalu Prasad defeat his sworn enemy, Lok Janshakti Party candidate Ranjan Yadav.

 Lalu Prasad is obliged to Mayavati. Without her support, the RJD candidate would not have won the Rajya Sabha seat against LJPs Ranjan Yadav. Also, both are pitched politically against the same adversary ? Mulayam Singh Yadav, a senior RJD leader said, explaining his partys offer of an alliance.

 But more than gratitude to Mayavati is Lalu Prasads desire to pay Mulayam back in his own coin. During the Bihar polls that the RJD lost, Mulayam had a role in damaging its vote base among Yadavs and Muslims in some constituencies. 

 Also, with LJP leader Ram Vilas Paswan ? another enemy of both Lalu Prasad and Mayavati ? joining hands with the new morcha of V.P. Singh and Samajwadi rebel Raj Babbar, the RJD chief is getting restive to take the poll plunge.

 Alone, Lalu Prasad may not even be noticed in Uttar Pradesh, but with Mayavati he can play his role (of harming Mulayam) well, the RJD leader said, adding the ball is now in the BSP chiefs court.

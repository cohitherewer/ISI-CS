 BJP may sail with profit list 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 12: The BJP is unlikely to stand in the way of a parliamentary clearance to exempt about 36 posts from the list of offices of profit under the Parliament (Prevention of Disqualification) Act, 1959.

 BJP sources said defence minister Pranab Mukherjee has managed to convince BJP leader Jaswant Singh that the only way out of the situation arising out of Jaya Bachchans disqualification is to declare more posts to be out of the ambit of offices of profit. 

 Singh had written to Mukherjee on April 27 indicating that the BJP would oppose any dilution of Article 102.

 Article 102 is aimed at making legislative members independent, which is why holding an office of profit under the government is a criterion for disqualification. The BJP has been arguing against any dilution of the spirit of the Constitution.

 The total number of posts that the Centre wants exempted from the profit list is reportedly close to 36 but the figure is still subject to revision.

 Sources said the National Advisory Council, of which Sonia Gandhi was the chairperson before she resigned, is definitely going to be exempted. Railway minister Lalu Prasad, too, has given his choices of posts that should be exempted.

 The government would definitely include the chairman of Sriniketan-Santiniketan Development Authority, a post that the Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee holds, in the list.

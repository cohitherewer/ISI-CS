 US sanctions on Indian Dawood

 K.P. NAYAR

 Dawood 

 Washington, June 2: The Americans appear to have concluded that underworld king Dawood Ibrahim is no longer in Karachi.

 Contrary to a US treasury department notice in October 2003 listing Dawood as a Pakistani citizen and a resident of Karachi, the White House yesterday designated him as an Indian drug kingpin.

 Dawoods designation under the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act, or Kingpin Act for short, however, acknowledged that the mafia dons network continues to span the subcontinent and the Gulf.

 President George W. Bushs designation as appropriate for sanctions specifically said Dawood is an Indian, but that his Dawood Ibrahim Organization conducted its operations in India, Pakistan and the UAE.

 This action underscores the Presidents determination to do everything possible pursue drug traffickers, undermine their operations, and end the suffering that trade in illicit drugs inflicts on Americans and other people around the world, as well as preventing drug traffickers from supporting terrorists, a White House statement said.

 In October 2003, the treasury department notice, which notified Dawood as a global terrorist with links to al Qaida, not only noted his Pakistani citizenship, but also revealed his Pakistani passport number G869537. That notice published his telephone number in Karachi: (021) 5892038.

 Today, no one was answering calls to that number. A total of 62 entities have been named under the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act since 2000. It was signed into law in December 1999. 

 The legislation targets significant foreign narcotics traffickers, their organisations and operatives worldwide, denying them access to the US financial system and all trade and transactions involving US companies and individuals. 

 Determinations of drug traffickers to be sanctioned under this law is done annually and announced by the White House.

 Restraint sermon to Mumbai cops

 Kid-gloves? Policemen escort a blast suspect to court

 Mumbai, Aug. 1: Maharashtra DGP P.S. Pasricha has urged officials/teams questioning Mumbai train blast suspects to proceed with restraint.

 The DGP has asked investigating teams to act tactfully and humanely while dealing with preventive detentions and interrogation of suspects, a senior Maharashtra police officer said.

 The idea is to sensitise interrogators that they should not give suspects the impression that they are in custody because of their religious beliefs. Rather, that they are being questioned for possible involvement in an act of violence.

 As it is, they are fed with a heavy dose of hatred that provides them some moral justification for what they do. We have to ensure that police high-handedness does not add fuel to fire and alienate them further, a senior officer who was earlier with Mumbai polices crime branch said.

 The issue figured in a meeting between Maharashtra and Mumbai police officers and representatives of central intelligence agencies.

 It is significant in the context of intelligence that dormant militant modules are trying to set up a terror triangle between Dongri in south Mumbai, Naya Nagar in suburban Mira Road and Mumbra in Thane district.

 Most of the blast detainees were from these areas, of which a large number were educated youth with no police record.

 It was felt that the need of the hour was to fight fundamentalist indoctrination. Prevention, after all, is better than cure, a police officer who attended the meeting said.

 Sources in the anti-terrorist squad said terror groups were targeting metros because such attacks ensured maximum publicity and higher casualties.

 For this, communication is the key and boys comfortable with technology are an asset. They do not recruit semi-literate youth with criminal backgrounds any more. Their catchment area has shifted from Kashmir to Maharashtra, an ATS source said.

 Correspondingly, the profile of terror modules in Mumbai and parts of north Maharashtra has drastically changed over the past five years, the sources said.

 A police officer said it was not just money that drew educated youths to terror modules. 

 They are highly motivated ideologically, and though the lure of the lucre exists, it is not the only reason that draws them.

 They genuinely believe they are not doing anything wrong. So, the strategy to deal with them cannot be the same as that for hardened criminals.

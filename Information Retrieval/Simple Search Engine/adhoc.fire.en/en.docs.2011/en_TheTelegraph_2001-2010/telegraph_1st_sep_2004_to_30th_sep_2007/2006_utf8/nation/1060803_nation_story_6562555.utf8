 New version of womens bill

 New delhi: The Centre is trying to evolve a consensus on a new version of the long-delayed womens reservation bill. It promises a quota for women in Parliament but not a 33 per cent one, reports our special correspondent.

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh spoke about it while meeting a CPI parliamentary delegation on Wednesday.

 According to CPI leader Gurudas Das Gupta, Singh said the Centre was working at getting political parties to agree on a quota smaller than the original proposal of 33 per cent seats in Parliament and state legislatures. 

 The UPA government had in the past floated other proposals, including one about making Parliament bigger, so that women would get more seats but not necessarily at the cost of men. 

 Das Gupta criticised the governments efforts at building consensus on the bill. Is it a pre-requisite that there should be unanimity before a bill is introduced in Parliament? he asked in the Lok Sabha. 

 CISF post-retirement scheme

 New Delhi (PTI): The Central Industrial Security Force has decided to launch a scheme to help its 2,000 employees who retire every year to secure private jobs after superannuation.

 The CISF is creating a database of those who retired in the last five to seven years with a detailed profile and information about their expertise and experience. Once the database is created, private and public sector companies and enterprises would be able to easily access information on retired employees. 

 CISF director-general S.I.S. Ahmed said many employees want to work after retirement because of family commitments.

 Debt suicides

 Akola (PTI): Three farmers in western Vidarbha have reportedly committed suicide, police said. 

 Santosh, 25, consumed poison on Tuesday after he was unable to repay a loan. Gautam Narayan Surve, 33, and Shrikrishna Gangaram Rahate, 45, also committed suicide as they were unable to repay their debts. 

 Imrana case

 Muzaffarnagar (PTI): Ali Mohammed, accused of raping his daughter-in-law Imrana, has claimed that he was falsely implicated because of a property dispute. Last year, Islamist clerics had ruled that Imrana should treat her husband as her son following her alleged rape. 

 Salem custody

 Mumbai (PTI): A court hearing the 1993 Bombay blasts case on Wednesday disallowed a Delhi police plea to hand over the custody of extradited gangster Abu Salem in an extortion case. 

 India will represent the 17-member Asia-Pacific region at the 11th annual meeting of the international coordinating committee of national human rights institutions in Suva, Fiji.

 Srinagar, April 17: Militants ambushed and critically wounded former National Conference MP Ali Mohammad Naik in Pulwama district today.

 Two of Naiks guards were killed and a policeman was injured in the attack in Naiks hometown Tral in south Kashmirs Pulwama district.

 Police said Naik was returning from a wedding in Tral, 43 km from here, when militants sprayed bullets at his vehicle near the local bus stand. 

 The former MP was injured while one of his security guards identified as Nazir Ahmad died on the spot, said a senior police officer.

 Naik and two of his security guards were shifted to the main hospital in Srinagar where one of the wounded guards, head constable Abdul Ahad, succumbed to injuries despite efforts by doctors to revive him, the officer added.

 Additional troops were rushed to Tral and the site of the attack was cordoned off and searched. No arrest has been made.

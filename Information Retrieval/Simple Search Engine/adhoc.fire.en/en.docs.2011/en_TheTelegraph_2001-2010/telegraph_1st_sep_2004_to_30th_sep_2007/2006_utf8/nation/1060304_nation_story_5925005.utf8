 Left lowers protest pitch

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, March 3: The Left has toned down but not abandoned its opposition to the Indo-US nuclear deal, agreed between Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and President George W. Bush yesterday.

 The Left today lowered its pitch against the agreement amid the widespread perception that the US had largely given in to India on several key aspects relating to sovereignty. Its MPs, however, demanded the government spell out the details of the nuclear pact and the agreement on agriculture and bio-technology.

 It (the nuclear deal) is a complicated agreement and we want to know all its aspects before offering our comments, CPM member Nilotpal Basu said in the Lok Sabha.

 Defence minister Pranab Mukherjee reminded the House that Bush was still in India. The Prime Minister will make a statement in Parliament next week, he said.

 Parliamentary affairs minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi told reporters he would discuss the subject with the Prime Minister tonight so that he could make a statement in Parliament on Monday.

 The Left realises that if the reports about the US conceding Indias key demands over the nuclear deal are true, it will be very difficult to oppose it, CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury later said. 

 But at a broader political level, the Left will continue to oppose American policies and press Manmohan Singh to chart a foreign policy independent of US influence.

 Basu expressed just this point when he said: We will also have to see whether there is an American game plan of containment in Asia ? whether the US wants to use India to contain China.

 He, of course, did not expect the Prime Minister to throw much light on this subject when he addresses Parliament. Nobody will publicly admit to this game plan, Basu admitted.

 He underlined the Lefts concern: There are three important principles (involved in the nuclear deal) ? maintenance of the independence of Indias nuclear programme, principle of reciprocity and the separation of civilian and military facilities which should be a sovereign decision resting with India.

 The principle of reciprocity is especially very important. The US has a track record of going back on its commitments. The US Congress is frequently used to subvert agreements with India.

 Basu cited the instance of the US discontinuing fuel supply to the Tarapur nuclear power plan.

 The US President will have to get the nuclear pact ratified by the US Congress. If he fails, the deal falls through.

 The CPM is suspicious of the agreement on agriculture and bio-technology, too. It fears the pact will pave the way for multinational corporations, such as Wal-Mart and Monsanto, to entrench themselves in India.

 Most of the public debate has been on (the) nuclear agreement and very little on agriculture, which is the lifeline for 75 per cent of our people, the Left MP said.

 Samajwadi Party and Janata Dal (United) MPs asked the government to apologise to the nation for allowing sniffer dogs at the Mahatmas samadhi.

 The government has lowered the nations prestige, an MP said.

 Rajnath in nuke fumble

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 12: BJP president Rajnath Singhs belated response to the unease in the nuclear establishment over the Indo-US nuclear deal reflects a clear lack of focus on foreign policy issues in the partys post Atal-Advani era.

 Having kept mum for several days after Atomic Energy Commission chairman Arun Kakodkar pointed out problem areas in the nuclear deal, Rajnath yesterday said the BJP was concerned about the issues raised by scientists.

 It is a very serious issue, said Rajnath. It has to be taken up in Parliament. We are holding discussions.

 Referring to the Presidents statement about development of nuclear power through thorium reserves, he said India does not have to kneel before the US for fuel.

 However, there was no clear stand on how the BJP wants to raise either the issue of the nuclear deal or vote on Iran. While the BJP has demanded an all-party meeting on the Iran vote as well as the nuclear deal, the partys official stand is still not clear.

 Even yesterday, Rajnath drifted from the deal to the Mitrokhin archives. The lack of coherence clearly reflected the BJP chiefs different priorities in which foreign policy or strategic issues rank very low. 

 Rajnath was keen on discussing the impossibility of the BJPs alliance with the Samajwadi Party in Uttar Pradesh rather than explain his stand on the Iran vote and the nuclear deal.

 We cannot even dream of having an alliance with the SP (Samajwadi Party), said the BJP chief in response to queries about RSS mouthpiece Organisers suggestion to this effect.

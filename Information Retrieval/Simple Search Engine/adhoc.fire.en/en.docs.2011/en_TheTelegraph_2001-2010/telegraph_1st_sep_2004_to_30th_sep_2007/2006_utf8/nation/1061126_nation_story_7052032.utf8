 Lucknow, Nov. 25: Three months ago, Mulayam Singh Yadav was all for greening up the banks of the Gomti. Three months on, 6,000 of the 15,000 saplings planted with fanfare in August were dug up to make way for a podium for him.

 For the chief minister and his band of boys, cutting the losses the Samajwadi Party suffered during the civic polls were more important. Mulayam had to address the people before more votes slipped away the Assembly polls are next year and what better place than the river bank?

 So, all the promises and cabinet proposals to plant trees along the Gomti to help replenish the dwindling water table and check shrinking of rivers were flung out of the window. As was some part of the Rs 49 lakh spent on planting the neem, teak and sal saplings.

 A huge podium was set up in the area cleared out, from which Mulayam today raved and ranted against Uttar Pradesh governor T.V. Rajeshwar for allegedly meddling in the affairs of his government.

 There is already the Lakshman Mela Ground here, where middling big rallies or fairs are held quite often. But encroachment and illegal constructions have eaten into most of the space.

 About 40,000 people turned up for the rally. The three-month-old saplings also made space for a fleet of cars belonging to party functionaries.

 Uprooting the saplings has struck a huge blow to the efforts to restore greenery on the river bank, environment activist Sachin Awasthi said.

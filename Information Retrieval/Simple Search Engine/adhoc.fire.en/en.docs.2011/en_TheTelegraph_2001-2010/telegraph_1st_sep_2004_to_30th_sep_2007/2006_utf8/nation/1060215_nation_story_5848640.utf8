 Court leash on capital colonies

 New Delhi: The Supreme Court has asked the government not to regularise unauthorised colonies in the capital without providing basic amenities, reports our legal correspondent.

 A bench headed by Chief Justice Y.K. Sabharwal said on Tuesday that if state authorities cannot provide these basic services, they should not go ahead with the regularisation process.

 The court passed the order while hearing a PIL on pollution of the Yamuna river. It has been monitoring the cleaning process since 1994.

 The apex court noted that the growth of illegal colonies without proper drainage and other facilities was a major cause of pollution of the Yamuna.

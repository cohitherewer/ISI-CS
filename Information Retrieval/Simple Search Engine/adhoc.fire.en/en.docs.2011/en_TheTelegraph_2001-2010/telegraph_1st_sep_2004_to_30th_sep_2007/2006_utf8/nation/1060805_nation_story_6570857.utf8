 UPA parades united colours

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 4: With the Left Front more or less on board on the nuclear deal and the banking bills, the Congress is keen to put the acrimony of the recent past behind at least before the next crisis erupts and put up a united show in Parliament.

 Today, the customary Congress briefing at 4.15 pm was replaced by a news conference addressed jointly by parliamentary affairs minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, CPM leader Basudeb Acharya, Gurudas Das Gupta of the CPI, the Rashtriya Janata Dals Devendra Prasad Yadav, Brajesh Pathak of the Bahujan Samaj Party and DMK leader C. Kuppusami. 

 Some important constituents and outside supporters like the Samajwadi Party, Lok Janshakti Party and the PMK were, however, missing. We rustled up whoever we could because we felt it was time the UPA jointly protested the BJPs stalling of the House instead of letting the Congress do it all the time, Das Munshi explained.

 The sum of their submissions was that in a democracy there was scope for dissent and disagreements, but that did not mean a single party or formation could hijack the agenda and hold the House to ransom day after day like the BJP has been doing.

 Since the start of the 14th Lok Sabha, the BJPs main intention is to disrupt the proceedings. The last budget was passed without a discussion. Parliament is meant for debate and discussion. We are supporting the UPA government, we have our differences with the government but we express these on the floor of the House. As peoples representatives, we owe it to them to highlight the problems of the poor, the peasants and the working class, Acharya said.

 Das Gupta pointed out that apart from remuneration and perks, MPs were paid a daily allowance of Rs 500 when Parliament was in session. These hold-ups mean we dont work. This is not social propriety. We are put to shame. The BJP is destabilising Parliament and bringing it closer to the Pakistani political system of parliamentary fundamentalism, he said.

 Yadav of the RJD quipped it would be more apt for the NDA to call itself the Nagpur Disorder Assembly than the National Democratic Alliance. Nagpur houses the RSS headquarters.

 The show of solidarity was intended to convey the message that all was well with the UPA.

 Bribe admission 

 COLUM LYNCH

 New York, Dec. 22: A businessman representing an Indian public sector company pleaded guilty to bribing a former senior UN official with an unspecified amount of cash, a cellphone and a discounted Manhattan apartment in exchange for more than $50 million worth of business contracts.

 Michael Garcia, the US attorney for the Southern District of New York, said in a statement that Nishan Kohli, 30, admitted making the illicit payments to Sanjay Bahel, then a high-ranking UN purchasing official, as compensation for steering business to Kohli from 1998 to 2003. 

 Kohli faces a maximum of 10 years in prison. 

 Bahel last month pleaded not guilty to related charges. His attorney said Bahel never used his influence to favour Kohlis businesses. He unequivocally denied that Bahel received any cash payments. He added that Bahel had already left the UN procurement division when he began renting an apartment from Kohli in 2003.

 Bahel was indicted on charges he provided insider information on UN contract negotiations to two companies, including Telecommunications Consultants India Ltd, which Kohli represented. Kohli provided Bahel with a cellphone so they could communicate about their scheme in secret. 

 The company signed contracts worth $54 million, including a $36-million deal to provide radio communications to UN peacekeepers in East Timor, Congo and other countries .

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Boycott ends, thanks to Atal

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 9: The NDA will be back in Parliament tomorrow, but with another warning for Speaker Somnath Chatterjee, in a strategy shuffle forced by many NDA constituents and Atal Bihari Vajpayee who have balked at the thought of a prolonged boycott. 

 We are coming back, declared V. K. Malhotra, BJPs deputy leader in the Lok Sabha, after a meeting at Vajpayees residence this evening. The talks were aimed at working out the BJPs strategy following the growing discord between the NDA and the Speaker. 

 We dont want to be the cause of disruptions in Parliament. But there should be a discussion on the Pathak report. Our future course and conduct in the House depend on how the Speaker behaves, Malhotra said. 

 Vajpayee had deepened the crisis yesterday with his warning to Chatterjee that he had lost the confidence of the Opposition. However, the former Prime Minister is believed to have told his BJP colleagues that he did not favour a boycott of Parliament. 

 Vajpayee wanted to give vent to the Oppositions disapproval of the Speakers conduct without being held responsible for a boycott. The NDA, however, went ahead with a days token protest by abstaining from the Lok Sabha yesterday, but the BJP top gun stayed away.

 The discussions this evening centred on the Pathak report and the alliances strategy following its direct attack on the Speaker. We will step up our agitation against exoneration of the Congress in the Volcker scandal. Sansad se sadak tak jayenge (Well take the issue from Parliament to the streets), Malhotra warned. 

 On parliamentary affairs minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshis remark about Vajpayees letter to Chatterjee being uncharacteristic of him, Malhotra said it just proved how clueless the ruling alliance was on most issues. He also said the BJP was planning to submit a memorandum to President A. P. J. Abdul Kalam on the Indo-US nuclear deal.

 The NDA does not intend to move a no-confidence motion against the Speaker at this juncture. It only wanted to make a point about his conduct and feels it had been done in a successful manner with the sit-in outside Parliament. 

 For the NDA allies, the focus will now shift to other issues. The monsoon session has been dominated by non-issues Jaswant Singh and the mole, Pathak committee and the leak and now the Speakers conduct of the House. We now want the House to resume and function normally. A number of important issues need to be discussed, said a Janata Dal (United) leader.

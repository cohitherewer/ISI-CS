 Clue to film-mob link

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Nov. 22: A day after being brought from Dubai, Anjum Adam Phajalani, a close associate of underworld kingpin Chhota Shakeel, was today formally arrested and booked under the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) for allegedly threatening Salman Khan.

 The 48-year-old Phajalani, among the 10 Dawood Ibrahim henchmen detained and reportedly deported, was produced before special MCOCA court judge Mridula Bhatkar. He was remanded in police custody till December 5.

 In their remand application, the police told the court that Phajalani had asked Salman to cut his professional fee from Rs 1.50 crore to Rs 1 crore to star in the 2000 film Chori Chori Chupke Chupke. The threat was allegedly made on instructions from the Karachi-based Shakeel.

 The SIM card from which Phajalani had allegedly made the call to Salman has been recovered, the police said, adding that they need to interrogate him to ferret out more information about the Bollywood-underworld nexus.

 A Salman-Preity Zinta-Rani Mukherjee starrer, Chori Chori Chupke Chupke had courted controversy after tapped telephone conversations led the crime branch to investigate its source of funding. The police claimed diamond merchant Bharat Shah had funded the film while Nazeem Rizvi had produced it allegedly at the behest of Shakeel.

 Rizvi and Shah, booked in 2001 under MCOCA, were later convicted. Other than Salman, several Bollywood stars, including Zinta and Shah Rukh Khan, were quizzed in the case. With the exception of Zinta, who stood by her statement, others had turned hostile in court.

 As many as 12 crime branch units are scanning dossiers to unearth information on the detained bunch of 10. 

 Apart from Phajalani, the other nine produced before a local metropolitan court are facing extortion-related charges.

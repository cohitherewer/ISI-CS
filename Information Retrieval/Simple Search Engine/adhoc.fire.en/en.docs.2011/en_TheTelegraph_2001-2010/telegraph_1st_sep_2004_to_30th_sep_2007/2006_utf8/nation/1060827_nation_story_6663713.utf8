 Court date for flight couple

 JOHN MARY

 Thiruvananthapuram, Aug. 26: The husband and wife who remained off camera while alleging mid-air harassment by Kerala public works minister P.J. Joseph could appear before a magistrate at Aluva near Kochi next month.

 Aluva first-class judicial magistrate P.K. Aravind Thampi today accepted a public interest litigation saying if the court agrees, the litigant can get the Chennai-based couple to appear before it. 

 The petition was filed by Stephen Rozario, chairman of Niyama Sahayavedi, an NGO, after police personnel in charge of Nedumbassery airport in Kochi refused to register a case. The PIL named Joseph and the pilot as the first and second accused.

 Joseph had allegedly molested the woman, a former TV news presenter, as the Kingfisher flight took off from Chennai for Kochi on August 3.

 Inspector-general B. Sandhya, who heads the team probing the incident, has visited the airport to gather evidence from its director, Kingfisher staff and the circle inspector who initially recorded the victims version as directed by the chief minister. 

 Sandhya will soon travel to Chennai to record the couples version.

 The probe team, which includes three deputy superintendents, examined the distance between seats on the small aircraft, a crucial factor in judging if the victim had perhaps over-reacted to a casual touch by the fellow passenger.

 Maoists kill 13 cops in twin attacks

 R. KRISHNA DAS

 Raipur, Feb. 6: Maoist guerrillas blew up a private vehicle carrying jawans from Nagaland and attacked a police station, killing 13 security personnel in twin attacks in extreme corners of Chhattisgarh today.

 The rebels first raided the Arrah police post in Jashpur, a district near the border with Jharkhand, killing three members of the special task force of the state police. More than 200 armed militants cordoned off the area and attacked the post, about 500 km from here and 3 km from Gumla in Jharkhand.

 In the other attack, the rebels triggered a powerful landmine in Dantewada, a district near the border with Andhra, and blasted a private vehicle carrying jawans of the Nagaland Armed Police. Ten jawans died in the explosion.

 The attack on the Arrah police post, 15 km from the district headquarters, came around midnight when most of the 17 jawans posted there were asleep. The police said the rebels exploded grenades and opened fire after blocking the roads leading to the post. They also blew up a wireless tower and a bridge on river Boki.

 Sources said the rebels made public announcements in all villages near the post, warning people not to come out of their homes.

 When the jawans at the post woke up to the attack, they returned fire. In the gun battle that followed, three jawans were killed and 12 injured. Around 4 am, the rebels succeeded in taking control of the post. They left after looting arms and ammunition and setting the post on fire. 

 Chhattisgarh police chief .P. Rathor, who rushed to Arrah with senior officials, spoke to his Jharkhand counterpart V.D. Ram and requested assistance in joint combing operations as the Maoists had probably escaped to Gumla and Simdega in Jharkhand.

 Since Maoists from Jharkhand are suspected to be involved, I have spoken to my counterpart there and steps are being taken for a joint operation to nab the attackers, Rathor said.

 The injured jawans were airlifted and rushed to different hospitals in Bilaspur.

 In the other strike, the rebels laid a trap in Bhejji on Indrepal-Sukma road in Dantewada district this morning.

 The Naga jawans ? deployed for counter-insurgency operations ? were returning to Bhejji after patrolling in the private vehicle to dodge the rebels. Sources said the truck, carrying two dozen jawans, was tossed 20 feet into the air before landing in pieces. Nine jawans died on the spot, one died later. Eight were injured.

 The sources said the blast was followed by heavy firing from the rebels. The jawans retaliated and the exchange of fire lasted till 2 pm. The rebels fled after additional forces reached the spot.

 Please-all name for Ladakh fest

 New Delhi: Finally, a politically correct name for Ladakhs annual culture bash on the banks of the Indus. Its a long name, but should please both Hindutvawadis and the secularists.

 When the NDA was in power, and for two years after that, the decade-old festival used to be called Sindhu Darshan. Some 10 days ago, that got replaced by the de-saffronised, local-friendly name of Ladakh Singhey Khababs Spring Festival.

 But press reports said some local politicians, including MLAs Sonam Wangchuk and Pinto Norbu, protested that Sindhu Darshan had become a brand that attracted tourists. 

 So, there is yet another name change. Its now Sindhu Darshan-Ladakh Singhey Khababs Spring Festival. 

 On Friday evening, a government release used the new name while listing the festival programme. The three-day event in Leh begins on June 12.

 Rs 2.5 lakh lost and found

 Durgapur: Sandip Roy, who sells 

 schoolbooks from a little shop for a living, has returned 

 a bag stashed with jewellery to its owner. 

 Police said the gold ornaments were worth Rs 2.5 lakh. Tapan Samanta, a garment trader, was carrying it home for a wedding in the family on Thursday night.

 Samanta got down from the Burdwan-bound local at Gurap, leaving the black bag behind. Roy saw it on the seat and asked others if it belonged to any of them. No one claimed it. Roy, 38, who earns about Rs 2,500 a month, then opened the bag and was stunned to see the contents. He took it to his home at Galsi.

 On Friday morning, he went to the local panchayat pradhan, who accompanied him to the police station. 

 The police found a visiting card with Samantas name and a telephone number, and informed him.

 Gandhi head

 Pithorgarh (PTI): A statue 

 of Mahatma Gandhi in this Uttaranchal district was desecrated 

 by vandals who cut off its head, police said on Friday.

 The head of the statue at Gandhi Chowk was chopped off with a sharp-edged instrument, sparking protests. The police are looking for the culprits.

 Malaysia visa

 Mumbai (PTI): The Malaysian 

 government has decided to open a visa office here and grant 

 multiple visas to Indians. It would also help develop new 

 land in India for developing palm oil estates, Malaysian 

 deputy Prime Minister Mohammad Najib Tun Razak said at the 

 launch of the Malaysia India CEO Forum.

 Amarnath ring

 Jammu (PTI): A three-tier 

 security ring of police, army and paramilitary personnel 

 has been readied to ensure that the two-month annual pilgrimage 

 to Amarnath starting this Sunday is incident-free.

 Japan has promised a grant of Rs 19 crore to 

 the Unicef for the eradication of polio in India. It will 

 be used for the purchase of 33 million doses of oral polio 

 vaccine.

 Verdict brings smile amp; shock

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Dance bar owners association chief Manjit Singh Sethi was sent to jail for 90 days for making derogatory remarks about deputy chief minister R.R. Patil.

 Mumbai, April 12: Supporters of dance bars were a jubilant lot, but the other camp was shocked and warned it could lead to greater corruption.

 The first group believed todays order had given a new lease of life to the bar girls.

 Joy was writ large on the faces of bar girls and bar owners who felt they could now return to work. I am certain that as soon as the dance bars open their doors, most bar girls would come back to work. I hope several others, who have entered prostitution as a result of their joblessness, would also return to work after this positive judgment, said Bar Girls Union president Varsha Kale.

 Womens rights activist and lawyer Veena Gowda said: The judgment is a step forward. Merely because women work in dance bars does not mean they are exploited. Another positive aspect is that the bar owners have told the court that they would not allow minors to be employed.

 The high court, in its ruling, directed an NGO, Prayas, and the SNDT Womens University to set up a team to monitor whether minors are employed in dance bars, and, if so, report it to the police.

 For the anti-dance bar lobby, the judgment came as a bolt from the blue. Vidya Chavan, of the Dance Bar Virodhi Manch, said: The judgment is shocking. We will challenge it in the Supreme Court. Nobody can deny that prostitution takes place at a majority of dance bars, and minor girls are employed in a big way. The dance bar addiction has also wrecked a number of families financially.

 Former IPS officer Y.P. Singh, whose book Carnage of Angels gave a fictional account of how protection money from beer bars breeds police corruption, said: Most of the investment in dance bars comes from police officers. But by banning dance bars, the employment of hundreds of people will be affected. You cant stop a profession just because you cant control it.

 Senior police officers see dance bars as a source of sleaze money. Tonight, not only will the dance bar owners and bar girls celebrate, a lot of other corrupt elements will also party hard. With dance bars having been closed, the hafta business had taken a beating. The bribe and the whole corruption chain will restart when the bars reopen, said a senior police official, who had cracked down on dance bars mushrooming in Thane.

 After the ban came into effect on August 15, 2005, the bars had continued to serve liquor but the dance performances had stopped, resulting in a sharp drop in revenues. We had continued serving drinks and offered musical entertainment after the ban. We will soon reopen the dance floor, said a bar owner in Dadar. However, several dance bars had begun refurbishing their outlets nearly two weeks ago, in the belief that judgment would be in their favour.

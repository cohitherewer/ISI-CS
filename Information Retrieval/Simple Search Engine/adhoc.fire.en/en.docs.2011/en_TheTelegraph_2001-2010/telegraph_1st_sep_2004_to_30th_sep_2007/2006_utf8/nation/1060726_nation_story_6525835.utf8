 Patil keeps mum on Pak

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi, July 25: Home minister Shivraj Patil today admitted that more money needed to be spent on the countrys security apparatus but steered clear of blaming Pakistan for the blasts in Mumbai earlier this month.

 Patil, who was speaking after a debate that raised the mercury in Parliament, did say we have certain information when pressed, but added he would not divulge it in the interest of the investigation.

 When leader of Opposition L.K. Advani picked on Patils silence on Pakistan though the Prime Minister had spoken of its possible involvement, the minister stood up again to clarify that there was no contradiction between what he and Manmohan Singh have been saying.

 Patil said more funds were required to beef up security as he addressed points raised during a Lok Sabha discussion on an adjournment motion the Opposition had moved on the governments failure to tackle the menace of terrorism.

 He mentioned plans for a 300-battalion increase in the strength of central police forces and the need for firming up the intelligence network. 

 Patil said the low-intensity warfare the country was facing was likely to continue for sometime and stressed on maintaining the unity evident after the train blasts.

 The Opposition termed his address unsatisfactory and walked out after the vote. The motion, seeking to censure the government, was defeated through a voice vote.

 RS trouble

 Walkouts and verbal duels marked proceedings in the Rajya Sabha on Tuesday as the government came under attack from the Opposition as well as its ally over the rise in prices of essential commodities.

 Finance minister P. Chidambarams assurance that the government had taken steps to tackle the situation did not impress the BJP and senior party leader Sushma Swaraj led her party out of the House.

 The Left then charged the government with enjoying a tax bonanza after the rise in prices of crude oil. When Chidambaram rejected the accusation, its MPs walked out.

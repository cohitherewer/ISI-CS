 Bird sucked into plane engine

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, May 27: A small bird brought an Indian Airlines plane to a shuddering halt as it was speeding for take-off from Orissas Biju Patnaik airport this afternoon, but all 121 people on board were safe.

 The bird, which hit the planes engine and got sucked in, however took its toll on the tyres. Four of them deflated as the pilot suddenly brought the airbus to a halt. 

 It (the bird) hit the right engine and was sucked in, said A.S. Das, an employee at the airport managers office.

 The plane later taxied to a bay near the terminal building and the passengers got off.

 There was a jolt and we all jerked forward as the aircraft ground to a halt. Later, the in-flight announcement told us there has been a technical glitch, said Ramesh Parikh, a manager with an insurance firm, recalling the close shave sometime after 2 pm.

 Parikh and the other passengers were kept waiting for about an hour inside the aircraft and another hour at the terminal before being taken to a city hotel.

 The aircraft has been sent for a check and repairs. Das said it may not be ready for flying till tomorrow.

 Preliminary investigation suggests it was a small bird. The pre-flight examination gave no indication of any bird but it could have flown in from somewhere, he said.

 Das said airport authorities have expressed concern about the presence of open garbage dumps and meat shops near the airport, which attract birds.

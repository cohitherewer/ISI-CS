 July 11: The stench of death was pervading on the Matunga station premises as a blast ripped through the first class gents compartment in the Virar-bound fast local in Mumbai here today.

 According to information, the train was travelling through Matunga around 6.25 pm when the blast took place. Witnesses claim that many passengers flung themselves out of the train even as it was running at full speed. 

 Amid the mangled heap in the compartment, chaos broke out in full force. 

 The dead and the injured were taken to the nearby KEM, Hinduja and Sion hospitals. The highest number of deaths were reported at Matunga station.

 The injured were taken to the hospital in taxis, there were no ambulances. We used our own hands to carry the bodies. I will never forget what I saw. There were men who had lost their legs and elbows and there was a man whose torso was hanging out, cried an eyewitness, who was so overcome by emotion that he almost collapsed.

 Vinod was in a state of shock as he desperately looked for his brother-in-law who had called him from the train as the bomb ripped through it. He cried that he has lost a leg?and asked me to come! After that I have no news, said the doctor.

 Sion hospital reeked of blood and mayhem as body after body arrived. On last count, 38 people were brought in dead while 40 were being treated in the emergency wards. 

 This is the worst that I have seen yet, after the 1993 blasts. There are people who are in various stages of treatment. Most of them have suffered huge loss of blood and had severely mutilated bodies. We have already arranged for about 60-100 extra bottles to be brought in for emergency requirement. 

 The bodies are all mangled and we have three to four doctors operating on a single patient ? the tension and shock suffered by them is adding to their already deteriorating condition, said Dr M.E. Yeolekar, dean, Sion hospital.

 He added: We have put up about 40 additional beds to accommodate as many people as possible. 

 In Sion hospital, 38 are dead and 25 are injured, while in KEM, 22 people are dead and 40 injured. This is all that I can say at this point of time, said a visibly disturbed D. K. Karale, DCP, Zone 4.

 Opposition leader Gopinath Munde visited the blast site even as the police department tried to bring in some semblance of order at the station.

 Clad in a starched white kurta, Munde accused the government for not taking any adequate measures to ensure the safety of the masses.

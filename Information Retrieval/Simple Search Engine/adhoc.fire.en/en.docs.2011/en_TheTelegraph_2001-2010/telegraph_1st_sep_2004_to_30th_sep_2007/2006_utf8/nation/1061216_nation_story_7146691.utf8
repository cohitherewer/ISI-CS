 Forest law for tribals, as Left likes it

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Dec. 15: A bill that for the first time grants tribals and other forest dwellers the right to live in the jungles was passed in the Lok Sabha today. 

 The CPM has reason to be pleased as the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Bill was passed with all the three big amendments suggested by the party.

 The bill also protects forests against further encroachment. Forests and forest-dwelling tribal people are inseparable. One cannot survive without the other, minister for tribal affairs P.R. Kyndiah said.

 There is a recognition of the fact that forests have the best chance to survive if communities participate in their conservation and regeneration. Insecurity of tenure and fear of eviction are the biggest reasons for tribals feeling alienated from forests.

 The bill grants the right to live in the forest, the right to access, use or dispose minor forest produce, the right to entitlement such as grazing and traditional seasonal resource access and the right to protect, regenerate, conserve or manage any community forest resource that was traditionally protected and conserved.

 First tabled on December 13, 2005, the bill was sent to a joint parliamentary committee to sort out differences. For a year, the pro-tribal rights lobby within and outside Parliament fought with environmentalists who claimed the bill would jeopardise the forests and tigers. 

 The CPM, which played an active part in pushing through the legislation, got the government to accept its suggestions. 

 Originally, 1980 was to be the cut-off year, which meant that those who had come to reside in forests after that year could be evicted under the law. The CPM argued that the cut-off should be December 13, 2005, when the bill was tabled in the House. After a long tussle, it had its way.

 The Centre initially wanted to restrict the tribal rights bill to scheduled tribes alone, but the CPM wanted it to cover other forest dwellers as well. The government proposed a second bill for the latter. Last week, CPM MP Brinda Karat said they had met the Prime Minister and argued against two separate bills. The government yielded.

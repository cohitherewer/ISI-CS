 Sonia, Renuka 

 New Delhi, Nov. 2: The government is split down the middle. Beneath the smiles and polite namastes simmers a silent gender war in the Union cabinet.

 These days Renuka Chowdhury, women and child development minister, isnt exactly the most popular figure in the corridors of power. Nor is dare we or they say it Sonia Gandhi.

 The United Progressive Alliance chairperson is trying hard to cut through the resistance from male ministers and MPs to the 33 per cent womens reservation bill, which has been in cold storage for years.

 Renuka seems to have sent a shiver down many of her male colleagues spines by managing to push through the domestic violence bill. Even the babus arent too pleased.

 The day the bill came into effect last week, Renuka received congratulatory calls from women colleagues and citizens. But a male cabinet minister rung her to say: You are doing this when you do not yet have 33 per cent reservation. Imagine what you might do if you get the quota!

 The babus say the bill smacks of gender bias. Why cant women be punished, too, for ill-treating men or other women? 

 Renuka has a ready reply: where was this talk of gender bias when women could be abused without the protection of a specific law?

 The spectre of the domestic violence bill is becoming increasingly linked to the womens reservation bill.

 Womens bodies are moving with a clear strategy: petition Sonia to neutralise the male leaders opposition.

 We fixed a meeting with Sonia before we were to meet Pranab Mukherjee, who was advocating increasing Parliament seats. Home minister Shivraj Patil was trying to link reservation to delimitation, said a member of the womens team that met Sonia.

 So we met Sonia at 5 pm, two hours before our appointment with Mukherjee.

 The tactic paid off. By the time the women met the foreign minister, Sonias call had gone through to his office.

 He told us Madam had called and that the government was not planning to increase Parliament seats.

 The male ministers and MPs may mutter under their breath about the madness of the womens reservation bill; all they can do in public is parrot Sonia.

 They, however, can speak their mind to Renuka. So they call her up crack a joke or two about the domestic violence bill and portend a gloomier future once the reservation bill is passed.

 But this hasnt deterred Renuka from planning an agenda that will make it tougher for men to get away with gender crime. 

 Her ministry plans to include stalking as a crime in the bill against sexual harassment.

 Sonia is her staunchest ally; her strongest critics are male cabinet colleagues, party leaders and the babus.

 At a meeting with the home minister, his officials told Renuka that women should dress modestly before complaining about the rise in rapes and molestation.

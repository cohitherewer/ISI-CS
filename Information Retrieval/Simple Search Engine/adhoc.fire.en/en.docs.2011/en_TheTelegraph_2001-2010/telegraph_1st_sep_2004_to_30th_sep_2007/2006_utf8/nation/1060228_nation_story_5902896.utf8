The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Channels many, takers few

 SUBHAJIT BANERJEE

 Calcutta, Feb. 27: The India-England series being played out on more than one channel may be good news for cricket lovers, but the sponsors are not sharing their enthusiasm.

 The asking rate for commercial airtime by Nimbus ? which holds the telecast rights to the upcoming three Tests and seven one-dayers ? is finding few takers in the advertising community.

 The company, which sold terrestrial telecast rights to Doordarshan and satellite rights to Sahara One, is reportedly quoting a price of around Rs 4.25 lakh per 10 seconds of advertising airtime. Thats close to what Ten Sports had got for a prime series like India-Pakistan. This series is simply not that lucrative, said the head of a national media buying agency.

 There is not much interest from advertisers since the price-value equation doesnt work out, the media buyer added. 

 A title sponsor for the series ? with only a day to go for the first one-dayer to get under way in Chennai ? is not yet on board either.

 Reluctant sponsors and no opportunity of earning subscription revenue ? both Doordarshan and Sahara One are free-to-air ? have made the chances of Nimbus and the channels making money even slimmer, feel industry observers.

 Nimbus is marketing the combined airtime for terrestrial and satellite channels by itself, which usually works out to 60:40 in favour of the satellite channel. For Doordarshan, the payout is simple. Nimbus needs to pay Doordarshan 25 per cent of revenues earned from selling terrestrial airtime.

 In case of the deal with Sahara, though neither party would disclose details, sources said Nimbus has agreed to retain the first $36 million (Rs 162 crore) of revenue generated and split the rest equally with Sahara.

 But with the matches available on more than one channel and low advertiser interest, it would be almost impossible for Nimbus to rake in anything close to that amount, said a sports channel official.

 Adding more channels to the pie ? Nimbus is trying to rope in a Tamil and a Telugu channel for simulcasting the matches ? will further reduce payouts.

 The problem of piracy has also cropped up with the matches being shown on Sahara One, a non-encrypted channel which can easily be downloaded in neighbouring countries like Pakistan. Sahara reportedly is planning to route the Sahara One feed for the series through encrypted decoders of Filmy, its recently launched movie channel.

 But there are only around 600 decoders for Filmy in the country. Though the company is trying to procure more boxes before the series starts, its a concern for advertisers, sources added.

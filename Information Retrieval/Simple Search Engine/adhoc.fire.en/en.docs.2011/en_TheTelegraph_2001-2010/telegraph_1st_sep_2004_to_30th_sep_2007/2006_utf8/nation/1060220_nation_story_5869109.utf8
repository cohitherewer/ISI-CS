 Andhra counting put off

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Hyderabad, Feb. 19: The Election Commission has put off counting of ballots in the byelections to the Visakhapatnam-I Assembly segment in Andhra Pradesh for which polling was held today.

 The commissions decision has come in the wake of complaints by the main contenders ? the Congress and the Telugu Desam Party ? that money and liquor had been distributed to influence voters.

 Confirming the postponement of the counting process slated for February 22, state chief election officer M. Narayan Rao said a fresh date would be announced after the petitions by the political parties are disposed of.

 He said 55 per cent polling was reported in the constituency which went to the polls to fill up a vacancy caused by the death of sitting member Dronamraju Satyanarayana.

 Quake claims child

 Alwar (Rajasthan), Nov. 29 (PTI): A 10-year-old girl died after a mild earthquake hit Alwar district and adjoining areas, triggering panic.

 Alwar superintendent of police Rajesh Arya said rumours of aftershocks had spread shortly after the quake, with civic authorities getting repeated calls. Everything is normal now, he said.

 Arya said the 10-year-old died when schoolchildren ran out of their classes in panic. She fainted because of shock and subsequently died, he said. 

 Denying reports that the girl died in a stampede, Arya said the body has been sent for post-mortem to ascertain the cause of death.

 The tremor was recorded around 11.10 am with its epicentre at a latitude of 27.6 degrees north and a longitude of 76.7 degrees east, officials said. No further loss of life and damage to property has been reported.

 Cash MP seats to miss date

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi, April 3: The Supreme Court today 

restrained the Election Commission from initiating the election process to fill 

Lok Sabha seats that fell vacant following the expulsion of 10 MPs involved in 

the cash-for-questions scandal. 

 The poll panel had moved the court as there was a legal obligation to fill a seat within six months of vacancy. With the expulsion being ordered on December 23, the vacancies had to be filled by June 22. 

 But with the apex court not giving an early hearing, the vacancies can now be filled only after a gap of over six months. There would be no illegality as the apex court is seized of the matter.

 A bench headed by Chief Justice Y.K. Sabharwal said the poll panels request for holding byelections would be considered in July after the summer vacations.

 The Supreme Court, which is hearing petitions challenging the expulsion, had asked the commission not to hold elections without seeking directions from the court.

 But the vacancy created by the expulsion of the lone MP from the Rajya Sabha has already been filled. The court had on March 3 allowed the filling up of the Rajya Sabha vacancy, subject to the outcome of the decision of the Constitution bench that would hear the matter.

 Allowing a plea for interim relief, the court had earlier directed the authorities not to evict the expelled MPs from the government accommodation provided to them. 

 The issue of byelections to fill the vacancies is now likely to be decided after the summer vacations. It was, however, not clear whether this issue would also be decided by the Constitution bench. 

 After attorney-general Milon K. Banerjee sought a go-ahead for the polls subject to the outcome of the decision, the court said it would further complicate the matter. 

 In its application before the court, the poll panel pointed out that it proposed to hold the byelections with the last phase of polls in states on May 10.

 The commission said that due to unfavourable climatic conditions in June, it wants to hold byelections in the 10 seats spread across six states in May itself.

 All the 11 MPs who were caught on camera demanding or accepting money for raising questions were expelled from the House. Their petitions challenging the power of Parliament to expel them have been referred to the Constitution bench.

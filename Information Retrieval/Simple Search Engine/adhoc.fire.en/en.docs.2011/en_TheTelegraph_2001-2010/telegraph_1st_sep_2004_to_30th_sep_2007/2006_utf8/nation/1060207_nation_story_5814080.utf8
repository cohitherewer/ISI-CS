 Red flag hint for toxic ship

 M.R. VENKATESH

 Chennai, Feb. 6: The Supreme Court panel studying whether decommissioned French naval ship Clemenceau should be allowed entry into Indian territorial waters, is unlikely to flash the green signal.

 The 11-member Supreme Court Monitoring Committee on Hazardous Wastes, headed by G. Thyagarajan, met today and gave finishing touches to its report.

 Clemenceau sailed into an environmental storm for carrying toxic cargo ? asbestos and asbestos-containing material. The French aircraft carrier has been sold to a company in Gujarat for ship-breaking.

 The committees report will be sent to the apex court tomorrow and the final hearing is slated for February 13.

 Thyagarajan, the former head of the Central Leather Research Institute, declined to divulge details of the report, saying: We are governed by a strict protocol. 

 However, his philosophical remark gave a hint of the panels mood. 

 The Clemenceau was the flagship of the French navy, a ship that has done so much service to that country. Why should it go through all this humiliation and cannot France end the agony of the ship by taking it back? he asked.

 The committee, which had met in Delhi and Mumbai before, had been divided on the issue earlier. But the final consensus seems unlikely to favour Clemenceaus entry.

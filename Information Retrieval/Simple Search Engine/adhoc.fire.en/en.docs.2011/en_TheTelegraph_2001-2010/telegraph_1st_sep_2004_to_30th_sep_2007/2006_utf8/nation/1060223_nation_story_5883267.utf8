 Bush security

 AYSWARIA VENUGOPAL

 New Delhi, Feb. 22: With Left groups threatening snap protests when the US President arrives here on March 1, Delhi police are working on a plan to make sure his motorcade is not stopped.

 Unlike his predecessor Bill Clinton, George W. Bush might have to take a rain check on visiting Delhis heritage sites such as Humayuns tomb, Akshardham temple and the Purana Qila because of security concerns.

 American security officials are already in Delhi, busy scanning the places Bush may visit.

 Other than snap protests, the four major Left parties are planning an anti-Bush march from Ram Lila Maidan to Jantar Mantar on March 1. Organisations like the Jamait-e-ulema Hind and celebrities such as Arundhati Roy, too, are expected to take to the streets in protest against US policies. 

 We shall be extra vigilant on March 2 when Bush is likely to visit Rajghat and move on to Hyderabad House, a police officer said. 

 Our focus areas will be the Ring Road around Rajghat, C-Hexagon at Hyderabad House and adjoining locations. Protests are also expected around Hyderabad House as there will be an open-air programme there, he added.

 The police will block both carriageways on the route of the US President, who will be staying at Maurya Sheraton.

 Although the plan is still being finalised, sources said the Americans were keen on Bush visiting an area of Islamic importance. Though a trip to Purana Qila had been okayed earlier, its now being reviewed.

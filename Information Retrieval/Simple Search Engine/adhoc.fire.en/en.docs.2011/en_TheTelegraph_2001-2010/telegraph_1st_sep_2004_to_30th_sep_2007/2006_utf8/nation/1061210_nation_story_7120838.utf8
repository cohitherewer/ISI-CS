 $1 billion rural loan hope

 Singapore, Dec. 9 (Reuters): The Asian Development Bank is to loan India $1 billion the largest-ever advance by the bank to a developing country to help alleviate rural poverty, the Financial Times reported today.

 The bank is expected to announce the loan on Monday amid concern that failure to broaden the base of Indias blistering growth could lead to social conflict, capital flight, falling investment and an economic slowdown.

 The package will be aimed at weaning the rural poor away from moneylenders by expanding access to formal finance, the newspaper said, marking a shift in emphasis towards the social sector for ADBs Indian loans.

 Until the end of 2005, nearly 90 per cent of ADBs loans to India had been invested in infrastructure.

 The funds, to be disbursed over three years and to be managed by the finance ministry, will boost lending by cooperative banks in five states: Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and either Gujarat or Orissa.

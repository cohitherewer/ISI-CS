The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Back to talks, chill in the air 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 16: The third round of foreign secretary-level talks between India and Pakistan is scheduled to begin tomorrow at which both sides are set to focus on Jammu and Kashmir and peace and security.

 The talks, led by Indian foreign secretary Shyam Saran and his Pakistani counterpart Riaz Mohammad Khan, will be held in the backdrop of recent acrimony between the two sides. 

 Earlier this month, in a sharp reaction to President Pervez Musharrafs remark that he would ensure peace if the Indian Army is pulled out of the three districts in Kashmir, Delhi had said demilitarisation or redeployment of forces was an internal matter.

 Today, while the Pakistani delegation claimed that it would table a new proposal on Kashmir, Delhi said it would propose expansion of confidence-building measures through a Poonch-Rawalkot bus service, plying of trucks on the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad route and allowing pilgrim movement across the Line of Control. 

 Apart from discussing Kashmir and peace and security, the foreign secretaries will chalk out a new schedule for technical-level discussions on six other subjects that are part of the composite dialogue ? Siachen, Sir Creek, the Tulbul Navigation Project, terrorism and drug trafficking, economic and commercial co-operation and promotion of friendly exchanges. 

 Khan, who reached Delhi today, said: We will see where we stand and how to push the peace process forward. 

 Official sources said Islamabad was likely to make a formal proposal for demilitarisation of some parts of Jammu and Kashmir, self- governance and joint patrolling in areas near the LoC. Delhi has already rejected Musharrafs proposal of demilitarisation. 

 Islamabad has also expressed dissatisfaction regarding the pace of the peace process and now wants to discuss concrete proposals on Kashmir. 

 In the first session of discussions, the two sides will review the progress made during the technical-level talks held last year. Kashmir and peace and security will be taken up subsequently. 

 The technical-level talks on the remaining six issues have to be completed before October when the two foreign ministers are expected to meet.

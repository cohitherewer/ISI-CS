 Fare hike beeps on air radar

 New Delhi, Nov. 14: Most airlines in the country are expected to raise passenger fares later this month.

 At a meeting held in Mumbai earlier this month, many airlines had decided that they would opt for the fare increase, which normally occurs in winter.

 Traditionally, winter is a busy season for airline travel and fares in India as well as abroad go up by 10 per cent to 30 per cent.

 Airline sources said the decisions taken at the meeting held by the Federation of Indian Airlines (FIA) were not publicised but fares are likely to go up as early as this week.

 PTI reported that major airlines are likely to hike fares by 3 to 5 per cent from Thursday, while state-owned Indian is contemplating charging a flat Rs 200 more per ticket for a limited period. The charge would be levied during the peak time from December 1 to January 31.

 Several airlines have been increasing fares without announcement by reducing the number of seats in the cheaper travel category. This trend is expected to continue this winter. 

 Facing stiff competition from low-cost carriers, some full-frills airlines have been selling tickets at as much as 60 per cent below the original fares.

 Most airlines have posted losses or lower-than-expected profits during the first half of 2006-07. Fuel bill, higher maintenance and spares costs as well as cut-throat competition from new entrants have hit the industry hard.

 Airline officials said they expected the opening up of new international routes for domestic carriers to help ease the pressure on margins. Better realisations and higher growth in foreign travel have made flights out of India lucrative. The Southeast Asian, Gulf, European and US routes are considered to be extremely profitable.

 Low-cost airlines, which are also represented in the FIA, had opposed a further hike in fares, saying fuel costs had come down and there was no justification for an increase.

 However, the carriers had agreed, in principle, not to charge fares below a certain level. 

 The FIA is scheduled to meet again on Thursday.

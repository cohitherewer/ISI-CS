 Sadhu gets bail after surrender

 Patna, May 26 (PTI): Rashtriya Janata Dal MP Anirudh Prasad alias Sadhu Yadav today surrendered before a designated vigilance judge who released him on bail in the multi-crore flood relief scam.

 Patna High Court had granted anticipatory bail to Yadav on May 22.

 Yadav, who is the brother-in-law of railway minister Lalu Prasad, had been on the run since the vigilance court issued a non-bailable warrant against him on April 10.

 The designated judge released him on bail after he furnished a personal bond of Rs 50,000 and two sureties each of the same amount on the directive of the high court. He also deposited his passport as the high court has asked him not to leave the country without its permission.

 The vigilance investigating bureau had on May 9 moved the court for a property attachment order against the MP. The vigilance judge accepted the plea and a proclamation notice ? a step before attachment of property ? was issued against Yadav.

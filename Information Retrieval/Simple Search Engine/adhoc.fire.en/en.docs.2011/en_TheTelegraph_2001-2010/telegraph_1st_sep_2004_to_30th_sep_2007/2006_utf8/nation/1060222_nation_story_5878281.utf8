 Court blow to Ambani

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 21: Delhi High Court today dismissed Anil Ambanis plea to stay the transfer of equity and other processes relating to the award of contract to private parties for the modernisation of Delhi and Mumbai airports.

 A division bench of Justices Tirath Singh Thakur and B.N. Chaturvedi, however, said any equity transfer or creation of third party rights would be subject to the court judgment. The government and private bidders ? GMR-Fraport and GVK-ASA ? will have to abide by our final verdict on the petition challenging the bidding process.

 Investments, if any, by the bidders would be at their own risk, the judges clarified.

 Ambanis Reliance Airports Developers, which has challenged the bidding process, had sought the stay till the disposal of its petition before the court.

 Todays ruling came after additional solicitor-general Gopal Subramaniam said both the government and the bidders were aware of the litigation and there was no need for staying the entire process.

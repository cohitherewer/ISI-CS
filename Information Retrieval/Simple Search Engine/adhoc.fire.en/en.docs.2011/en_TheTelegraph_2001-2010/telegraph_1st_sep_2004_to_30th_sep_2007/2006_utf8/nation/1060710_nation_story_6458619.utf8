 Farmers stand in township way

 ABHIJEET CHATTERJEE 

 Burdwan, July 9: After a section of farmers at Singur in Hooghly district, peasants on the outskirts of Burdwan town are resisting the construction of a township and health city.

 Over 300 acres are required for the Rs 200-crore joint venture project involving the Burdwan Development Auth-ority and private real estate companies.

 Of the land earmarked for the project, about 150 acres are single-crop, 140 acres residential, 10 acres multiple-crop and the remaining 10 acres water bodies. The average earnings of the farmers at Goda, about 90 km from Calcutta, range between Rs 2,000 and Rs 10,000 a month.

 I earn about Rs 3,000 every month by growing paddy or pulses. I dont want to sell my land, said Nityananda Kora, who tills a six-bigha plot.

 We have heard that a town and a health city will come up here. A factory would have fetched us jobs. We will not part with our land, he added.

 Kora is one of the 3,000-odd farmers and farm labourers dependent on the produce ? paddy, pulses, corn, sugarcane, potato and green vegetables ? from the 150 acres of land at Goda, part of industries minister Nirupam Sens own constituency. 

 The township will house about 40,000 people, government offices, a fire station, a police station, a higher secondary school and a shopping mall.

 But the farmers are not impressed. District magistrate Subrata Gupta, also an authority board member, had appealed to them last month to appear before the district land acquisition department. Only a negligible number responded. 

 He tried to sound positive. I have held meetings with the village heads on this issue and we are trying to convince them to sell their plots. Local land touts are misguiding the villagers.

 At Singur, some 40 km from Calcutta, the Tatas want 1,000 acres for their small-car unit. 

 Like the Singur farmers, the residents of Goda have set up a forum to protect their land ? the Paschim Bardhaman Krishi Kalyan Samiti. 

 The compensation being offered to the farmers in Burdwan is in accordance with the terms announced by the state recently. The farmers are likely to get between Rs 6 lakh and Rs 9 lakh for an acre. 

 Two thousand farmers of three villages in Dadri, Uttar Pradesh, yesterday tried to get back their land, which had been acquired for a Reliance power project. It ended in police firing. They were paid Rs 1.5 lakh an acre as compensation for the land close to Ghaziabad and the Noida industrial area.

 The CPM leadership in Hooghly, however, is treading with caution. We have learnt a lesson at Singur. We want to go about the land acquisition very carefully, a party functionary said.

 The only way to end the impasse, said another leader, is to convince farmers that the new facilities will benefit them. 

 Sajid Hossain, who owns a two-bigha plot, however, believes that he is being displaced to make room for the rich.

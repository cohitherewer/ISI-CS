 Steel VP held over clash

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, May 21: A vice-president of Bhushan Steel and Strips was among nine persons arrested today, a day after security guards of the company clashed with villagers protesting against a boundary wall. 

 At least seven villagers suffered injuries when security personnel at the plant in Meramundali in Dhenkanal district opened fire and hurled bombs around 4 pm yesterday. 

 Residents of Sarpa-Raghunathpur near the Bhushan steel plant are opposing the construction of a wall around the 1,700-acre area acquired by the company last year. They said it would block the road that is their only link to National Highway 42.

 We have arrested nine persons from the plant area, including five officials of Bhushan Steel, said Dhenkanal superintendent of police Bhakta Ballav Das. Das said police were searching for more accused involved in the clash.

 The arrested Bhushan officials are vice-president Paras Singh, assistant general manager Ramayan Upadhyaya, senior managers Sandip Behera and Naveen Singh and security officer Banabihari Nayak. Besides, the police have arrested four others working for United Construction, which was hired by Bhushan Steel and Strips to build the wall. Vice-president Singh was admitted to the district headquarters hospital after he complained of dizziness.

 All the seven injured ? Sukadev Behera, Digambar Parida, Nabakishore Patra, Bira Behera, Sachhidananda Behera, Ramesh Behera and Bhramarbar Senapati ? have been admitted to the Dhenkanal hospital.

 Collector Usha Padhi visited them at the hospital this morning and said the district administration would bear all expenses of their treatment.

 Bhushan Steel and Strips director Neeraj Singhal said from Delhi: The villagers armed with swords and lathis entered the plant premises and attacked the construction workers. This led to a clash between them and the contractors men. Our staff were not in any way involved.

 Grenade blast kills 4 tourists

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Srinagar, May 25. Four tourists from Gujarat, including two children, were killed in a militant attack on a day Prime Minister Manmohan Singh concluded his visit to Kashmir.

 In the second strike on tourists this week, militants this evening hurled a grenade at a bus carrying tourists from Surat at Batpora on the outskirts of the city. 

 The grenade exploded inside the bus, injuring 11 passengers, four of whom died in the Soura Medical Institute. Doctors said the others, all tourists, are admitted in the hospital.

 The victims were identified as Thinnal and Robin, both 8, Krishna, 15, and Khusboo, 18.

 Earlier this week, one tourist and a local driver were killed and four injured when militants hurled a grenade at a bus from Sonamarg at Soura on the outskirts of Srinagar.

 Thousands flock to the Valley during summer and the swelling crowd forced even the Prime Minister to cut short his visit as extraordinary security arrangements had been causing inconvenience to tourists and local people.

 Because of the tight security, the tourist bus today had to go round the Dal Lake. The round-table conference, which brought Singh to Kashmir, was being held on the other side of the lake.

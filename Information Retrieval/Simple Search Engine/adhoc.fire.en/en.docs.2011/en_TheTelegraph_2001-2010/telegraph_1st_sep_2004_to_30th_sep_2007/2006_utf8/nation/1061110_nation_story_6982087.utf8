 Marandi in surprise win

 OUR BUREAU

 Patna/ Koderma, Nov. 9: Jharkhands first chief minister Babulal Marandi pulled off a stunning victory in the bypoll to the Koderma Lok Sabha seat today.

 All but one of his rivals lost their security deposits as Marandi (in picture), contesting as an Independent and written off by critics, beat the UPAs Manoj Yadav by 1.94 lakh votes. Marandi had vacated the seat he won in 2004 as a BJP candidate after quitting the party in May.

 The victory, which Marandi described as a mandate for mid-term elections in the state, set alarm bells ringing in the BJP as well as the rival Jharkhand Mukti Morcha.

 Arjun Munda, who had replaced Marandi as the BJP chief minister, said his party had learnt to take both wins and losses in its stride.

 But in Bihar, there was good news for the NDA, of which the BJP is a part, as both its nominees emerged winners. 

 Shahnawaz Hussain of the BJP won from Bhagalpur while Janata Dal (United) candidate Ram Swarup Prasad won in Nalanda. 

 Lalu Prasad, reacting to the results, said: Its okay that the NDA has won. But we havent lost. His nominees had come second, followed by the Left candidates who were backed by the UPA minus the RJD.

 Conceding that the NDAs victory was due to the UPAs failure to field common candidates, Lok Janshakti Party president Ram Vilas Paswan said in Delhi: The LJP made sacrifices and did not field candidates in favour of the Left parties.

 Chief minister Nitish Kumar was elated. The victory indicates that the NDA has the support of all sections, particularly the Muslims, he said.

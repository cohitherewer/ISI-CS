 Sikh hair snip sparks fury

 Jaipur, Aug. 22 (PTI): Members of the Sikh community went on the rampage today after the alleged cutting of the hair of a Sikh teenager.

 Two policemen were hurt and the windscreen of their vehicle smashed when they tried to stop the protesters from hurling stones, an official said. 

 Demanding the arrest of six youths who allegedly cut the hair of 17-year-old Inderpreet Singh before beating him up yesterday, the protesters ransacked Gandhi Nagar police station and forced shopkeepers to down shutters. The situation in the Rajpark locality remained tense as the protesters, brandishing swords, also asked other business establishments to close down.

 An FIR lodged with Gandhi Nagar police station late last night said Inderpreet was taken to a deserted place before being assaulted. Yesterday, as I was returning home, six masked youths dragged me into a car from right outside my school, beat me up and then cut my hair, Inderpreet said, recalling his ordeal. I was then thrown by the roadside.

 Jealousy and rivalry in a love affair involving a girl close to Inderpreet could be the reason behind the assault, police said.

 Hundreds of people staged a sit-in outside the Rajpark gurdwara demanding the arrest of the accused.

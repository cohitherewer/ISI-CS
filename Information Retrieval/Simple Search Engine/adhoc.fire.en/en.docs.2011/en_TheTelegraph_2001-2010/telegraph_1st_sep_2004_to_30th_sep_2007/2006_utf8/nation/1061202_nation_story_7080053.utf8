 Coal e-auction hits SC wall

 SINGH GYANANT KUMAR

 New Delhi, Dec. 1: Declaring that public interest, and not profit, should guide the public sector, the Supreme Court today quashed Coal India Limited (CIL)s decision to sell through e-auction at rates higher than the notified price. 

 The order is a setback to CIL, which might now have to refund the excess amount collected from petitioners, that too with interest.

 A bench headed by Justice S.B. Sinha, however, left it open for the government to re-introduce e-advertisement or e-tender after ensuring greater transparency. 

 CIL had introduced e-auction of coal around two-and-a half-years ago and claimed that it eliminated the mafia, allowed for greater transparency and fetched higher prices as bidders competed for different grades. 

 Only 10 per cent of the coal produced by CIL, it claimed, was being sold through e-auction while the rest went to the core sector and other users at notified prices. 

 The decision had been challenged before various high courts. While Guwahati High Court had held the order invalid, the Madhya Pradesh High Court had upheld the validity of e-auction.

 The apex court verdict came on a batch of petitions challenging the decision by CIL not to supply coal at the notified price. 

 The Centre had sought transfer of all similar petitions pending before various high courts to avoid conflicting judgments.

 The court had, during the pendency of the matter, directed industrial undertakings to pay one-third of the excess amount claimed by the public sector undertaking till the disposal of their petitions. 

 It is likely that Coal India would have to refund the extra amount paid by industrial undertakings with interest.

 Setting aside the scheme, the court said coal was a scarce commodity and there was a need to have a mechanism to curb loopholes to check misuse so that genuine consumers benefited. The Union of India or the coal companies appear to have lost confidence in the state governments, the court noted. 

 The state governments, before e-auction, used to furnish list of industrial units, especially in the small-scale sector, eligible to receive supply of coal at notified prices.

 With a view to evolve a viable policy, a committee should be constituted by the Union of India with the secretary of coal as chairman. A technical expert in coal should also be associated, the court said.

 The court clarified that the verdict should not be seen as prohibition on the Centre or coal companies. They evidently can (change policies); but there should be a public interest as distinguished from a mere profit motive, the court added.

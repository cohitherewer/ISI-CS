 Dance bar ban heads for SC

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, April 13: The Maharashtra government today claimed the ban on dance bars had lowered crime figures and said it would appeal in the Supreme Court against yesterdays Bombay High Court judgment lifting the ban.

 Deputy chief minister R.R. Patils announcement, however, failed to discourage the thousands of bar dancers here who continued their celebrations late into the night, distributing sweets and doing little jigs to Bollywood beats.

 The verdict has given hope to the dance bar industry that employs about 2 lakh people, including 75,000 dancers. The court has said the process of renewing the bars dance performance licences ? withdrawn after the ban kicked in on August 15 last year ? must begin in eight weeks.

 Upset at the high court verdict, Patil had refused to react to the news yesterday.

 The Nationalist Congress Party minister had announced the ban in the Assembly on March 31 last year, and personally convinced the dissenting Congress leaders in the coalition to obtain a cabinet approval.

 On Thursday, Patil told the legislative council that the governments law and judiciary department and the advocate-generals office would study the 257-page court ruling and file an appeal in the Supreme Court within the stipulated eight weeks.

 The high court struck down the ban because it prohibited dance performances at beer bars and restaurants while allowing them at high-end hotels, theatres, pubs and sports clubs. The court found this discrimination unconstitutional.

 Only six five-star hotels in Mumbai possess dance performance licences, Patil said. Two of these hotels had organised Indian and western dance performances on eight days, whereas dance bars organise dance performances every night through the year.

 He argued that dance bars encouraged crime. In five years, 23,119 offences were registered against dance bars. These include offences like keeping the establishment open beyond the stipulated deadline of 1.30 am, prostitution and obscenity.

 No such case has been lodged against any of the six five-star hotels. Before tabling the bill, we had consulted legal experts and they did not feel the legislation was discriminatory.

 Patil, who handles the home portfolio, said after the ban came into effect, crime rates in the state had dipped. I will soon table the crime figures in the Assembly to illustrate this.

 Denying he was isolated within the government on the subject, Patil said: It was a unanimous cabinet decision to implement the ban. The bill was tabled and passed unanimously. I dont consider this a defeat.

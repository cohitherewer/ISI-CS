 Maoist ideologue Baburam Bhattarai and spokesman Krishna Bahadur Mahara, who met Mukherjee, claimed that nearly 150 Nepali Maoists are being detained in India.

 Among the senior leaders imprisoned in India are Mohan Baidya, in Siliguri jail, and C.P. Gajurel, recently sentenced to three years in prison in a fake passport case.

 This is the first formal meeting between an Indian diplomat and the Maoist leadership since insurgency began a decade ago.

 According to Maoist leader Dina Nath Sharma, Mukherjee promised to convey their concerns to New Delhi. The ambassador was extremely positive to our concerns, Sharma said.

 Madras HC stalls Gajurels Bengal trip

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chennai, Sept. 19: Bengal police yesterday cut short Chandra Prakash Gajurels walk to freedom as he stepped out of a Chennai jail, but they wont be going back in a hurry with the Maoist leader from Nepal.

 Madras High Court today made it clear that Gajurel could not be taken to Jalpaiguri, in north Bengal, till the habeas corpus petition his lawyers have moved and an earlier plea are decided on.

 A division bench refused to stay the transit warrant the Bengal team had applied for in the chief metropolitan magistrates court yesterday, but said the warrant need not be executed till the petitions are disposed of.

 Both petitions are expected to come up on Friday.

 Gajurel was arrested by Bengal police for anti-national activities just as he walked free yesterday from the central jail here where he had been imprisoned for carrying a fake passport.

 Today, his lawyers moved the chief metropolitan magistrates court for bail, hours after the high court admitted the habeas corpus petition challenging the re-arrest.

 C. Vijayakumar, one of the lawyers representing Gajurel, said if the Maoist leader does not get interim bail, he will be taken back to the central prison till the high court decides on the two petitions.

 Earlier, in the high court, Gajurels senior counsel Sankara Subbu alleged the Bengal team, led by inspector P.K. Dutta, had illegally re-arrested the leader on the jail premises. Dutta denies the allegation and says Gajurel was arrested in front of the prison.

 Subbu also contended that an earlier transit warrant issued by the sub-divisional judicial magistrate of Jalpaiguri had been stayed by Madras High Court in August 2004. As the matter is pending in the high court, Bengal police could not re-arrest Gajurel.

 He argued that Gajurel could be given interim bail as he is a senior Maoist leader.

 The high court said the prosecution, which has opposed the bail plea as Gajurel is a feared terrorist, and the defence could make submissions before the chief metropolitan magistrate.

 PM in two minds on quota bill date

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

New Delhi, June 5: The Centre is having a rethink 

on whether it should introduce the bill on reservation for Other Backward Class 

students in Parliaments monsoon session or wait for the oversight committees 

roadmap on how to implement the controversial policy.

 After a meeting of the Left-UPA coordination committee two weeks ago, the government had announced that the bill, earmarking a 27 per cent quota for OBCs in institutions of higher education, would be brought in the next session beginning in the third week of July. Given that no political party has opposed the policy, its passage was a certainty. 

 The oversight committee headed by Congress leader Veerappa Moily is expected to submit its report by the end of August. 

 The committee was mandated to chart a specific course of action to increase the number of seats in higher education institutions and determine faculty requirements so that the general category would not end up with lesser seats.

 Official sources said Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was of the view that given the extreme reactions to the governments proposal ? in the form of a long-drawn agitation by medical students ? the two steps should go hand-in-hand. 

 Singh felt if the bill was passed before the Moily committees report, it would appear as though the latter was a cosmetic gesture aimed at buying transient peace with the agitators. 

 Although neither move can be implemented before the next academic year in 2007, South Block feels divorcing the two could trigger another round of protests when the colleges and universities reopen after the summer vacation. 

 The sources said the rethink does not mean the Centre would go back on its reservation policy. But because of certain qualitative differences the debate yielded this time as compared to 1990, when the V.P. Singh government adopted the recommendations of the Mandal Commission, it was imperative for the UPA to tread cautiously.

 In 1990, the situation was circumscribed in black and white. Either you were for Mandal or against it. This time, there is a recognition that social equity and academic excellence can co-exist? and that merit is not caste- or community-specific, a source said. 

 To push for postponing the introduction of the bill, the Prime Minister has his task cut out. He is likely to first discuss it with Congress president Sonia Gandhi, senior party leaders and ministers Pranab Mukherjee and Arjun Singh.

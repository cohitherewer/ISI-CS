 Aid no bar to autonomy

 - Boost for minority centres

 New 

 Delhi, Dec. 3 (PTI): The Supreme Court has held 

 that minority educational institutions receiving aid cannot 

 lose the right to claim immunity from state interference 

 in management and appointments, including that of principal.

 Having regard to the key role played by the principal in the management and administration of the educational institution, there can be no doubt that the right to choose the principal is an important part of right of administration and even if the institution is aided, there can be no interference with the said right, the apex court said. 

 The court was delivering a judgment on the appointment of a principal in a private minority-aided college in Kerala. 

 When the appointment was challenged, it had been contended that the college was aided and governed by the state act, and the candidate would, therefore, have to fulfil the criteria set by the state.

 A bench comprising Justices H.K. Sema and R.V. Raveendran recently set aside the verdict of Kerala High Court which had held that the receipt of aid by a minority institution removes protection under Article 30 (1) of the Constitution by taking away its right to claim immunity from interference.

 The high court had held that under such circumstances, the regulations made by the state to govern appointments and the removal of appointees as also the conditions of service of principals and lecturers would be binding on such aided institutions.

 However, the Supreme Court said that a constitution bench in the T.M.A. Pai case has made it clear that a minority institution did not cease to be so merely on receipt of aid from the state or agencies.

 Article 30 (1) clearly implies that any grant that is given by the state to minority institutions cannot have such conditions attached to it which will, in any way, dilute or abridge the rights of the minorities to establish and administer educational institutions, the bench said.

 The Malankara Syrian Catholic College had challenged Section 57 (3) of the Kerala University act, which makes seniority-cum-fitness the basis of appointment of principals in private-aided minority institutions, on the ground that it was violative of Article 30 (1).

 The bench said Section 57 (3) of the act cannot apply to minority-run educational institutions even if they are aided.

 Big shot grabs woman on flight, minister lands in trouble

 JOHN MARY

 Thiruvananthapuram, Aug. 21: A Kerala minister has been sucked into a controversy after a woman complained that she was molested by a VIP on a flight from Chennai to Kochi earlier this month.

 Public works minister P.J. Joseph was the sole VIP on Kingfishers flight IT 2483 on August 3.

 Joseph denied the allegation, saying it was aimed at finishing his political career. He said he would meet the chief minister tomorrow to explain his stand.

 Youth Congress leaders had marched to the secretariat this evening demanding action against the minister after local TV channels carried interviews and voice-overs from the woman and her husband, who wore masks to protect their identity.

 According to the womans husband, who wasnt on the flight, the incident occurred when the plane was readying for take-off and cabin lights were off. Someone suddenly came and occupied the back seat, which had remained vacant till then, he said.

 As the plane started moving, someone caught my wife from behind. She called out to the crew and demanded another seat but was asked to wait till take-off. She then raised her voice, asking the man behind whether big shots like you wouldnt allow a woman to travel safely. Soon she was given another seat, the husband said.

 When the lights came on, the man was found hiding his face behind a newspaper.

 The purported victim made a written complaint expressing concern over the safety of women passengers. No name was specified because there was no personal vendetta involved, her husband said.

 Television channels picked up the incident after the Nedumbassery airport security wing got a call from the chief ministers office, seeking to verify it. 

 Chief minister V.S. Achuthanandan is non-committal, saying he would inquire if there was a formal complaint.

 The woman told a TV channel over phone from Coimbatore that she had not complained against the assailant because she did not want to make it a public issue. She pleaded to be left alone.

 Kingfisher pilot Shaji Madhavan confirmed the incident without naming the accused.

 Opposition leader Oommen Chandy refused to react on the basis of hearsay. But Youth Congress president K.P. Anil Kumar and Mahila Congress leader Shanimol Usman demanded that the chief minister reveal who the culprit was and whether it was his colleague.

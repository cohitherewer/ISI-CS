 Sudden goodbye for Sonias eyes amp; ears 

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Sonia

 April 11: Sonia Gandhi is not leaving her detractors any chance to question her the next time she enters the Lok Sabha.

 In keeping with her resignation spree after the office of profit row, two visible faces that often functioned as her eyes and ears have disappeared from 10 Janpath.

 Since Sonia stepped down as National Advisory Council chairperson, P.P. Madhavan and S.V. Pillai, both Class II Government of India officials, can no longer be seen at her residence. Till recently, both were drawing salary from the PMO, under which the NAC falls.

 Madhavan was originally from the home ministry and Pillai the PMO. Both are likely to have returned to their respective departments.

 In 1975, Sonias role model Indira Gandhi had suffered ignominy when Allahabad High Court set aside her election as MP, forcing her to resign as Prime Minister. The order came after her aide Yashpal Kapoor, a government employee, was seen at a poll meet in Rae Bareli.

 After nearly three decades, Sonia too is seeking election from Rae Bareli.

 There was no official word on the officials sudden exit. But insiders at 10 Janpath conceded their return would not be easy or swift.

 Even after winning Rae Bareli, Sonia will continue to be merely an MP ? an office that does not entitle her to avail the services of these two officials.

 Congressmen attributed their departure from the power house as yet another example of a cautious Sonia.

 This decision too comes from Soniajis cautious approach. With her own election in Rae Bareli (coming up) and Assembly polls in five states in full swing, she did not want to invite the Election Commissions wrath, a source said.

 It is believed that BJP spokesman Prakash Javadekar got wind of Madhavan and Pillais presence and was keeping a close tab on their activities.

 For the outside world, the importance of Madhavan and Pillai is not exactly known. But the duo had been extremely influential since Sonias private secretary V. George went on leave.

 George returned, but his detractors strove to reduce his workload. Madhavan and Pillai worked in shifts almost round the clock. They fixed appointments with Sonia. In the past few months, there were complaints that genuine party leaders were finding it difficult to meet her.

 Madhavan and Pillai, whose links with the Nehru-Gandhis date back to the late 80s, also vetted reports from AICC general secretaries, controlled access to Sonia and even booked film tickets for Priyanka and Rahul Gandhi.

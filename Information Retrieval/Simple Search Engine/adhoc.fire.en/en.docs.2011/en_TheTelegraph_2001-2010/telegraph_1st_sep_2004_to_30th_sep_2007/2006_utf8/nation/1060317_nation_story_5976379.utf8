 ATM thief owns up

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Ahmedabad, March 16: As a service engineer with an ATM manufacturing company, Sagar Soyantar found it easy to fix the machines and commit the perfect bank robbery.

 The 25-year-olds undoing was he couldnt fix his conscience as well.

 Nobody had an inkling about what Soyantar had been up to till the innocent-looking youth walked into a bank to confess his crime and hand over the nearly Rs 7 lakh he had fraudulently withdrawn over six months.

 While servicing ATMs of the State Bank of India, with which his company had a maintenance contract, Soyantar would tamper with the machine and withdraw money from his own UTI Bank account ?without the transaction being rec-orded.

 Soyantar has told police he would cut off the power immediately after he withdrew the money; thats how it never got debited to his account.

 The young man had already withdrawn Rs 6.81 lakh from three State Bank ATMs when his conscience started pricking him. 

 On December 16 last year, he walked up to Sandeep Ubale, the manager of State Banks Civil Hospital branch, and confessed.

 It took the bank three months to check the facts and lodge a complaint, and Soyantar was arrested on March 13. He has been sent to the Central Sabarmati Jail.

 Investigating officer V.S. Pandav said Soyantar has been sacked by the Chennai-based Diebold Private Limited, for which he worked at a monthly salary of Rs 15,000.

 Asked how the bank had failed to detect the fraud till Soyantars confession, bank manager Ubale said: I am not authorised to speak on such matters. 

 The investigating officer said Soyantar, a resident of Vejalpur, had withdrawn Rs 5.97 lakh from the State Bank ATM at Civil Hospital, Rs 74,000 from Chandkheda and Rs 10,000 from the Ashram Road ATM.

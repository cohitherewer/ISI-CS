Spiderboy, with lizard as his teacher

 Imphal, June 27: A small village in Imphal West has unleashed its own home-grown Spiderman. 

 Sixteen-year-old Soraisam Surjit Singh, gifted with a rare talent ? he can crawl up tree trunks, branches and walls without any tools, just like the comic superhero ? is now trying to climb his way into the Guinness Book of Records.

 The self-taught climber is being trained by the Manipur Mountaineering and Trekking Association for a shot at Guinness fame. The sports enthusiast initially took to the crawling game because it thrilled him. 

 The Guinness dream came much later. 

 The inspiration came five years ago. 

 One day during my summer vacation, I was reading in the shade of a big tree near my house. There I spotted a lizard moving up and down the tree effortlessly and spent the entire afternoon watching it. I thought that I could also crawl up and down like the creature if I practised, Surjit reminisced.

 The next few months went into devising ways to climb trees backwards, winding both arms and legs round the trunk. But Surjit soon realised that he would need stronger muscles to keep his 11-year-old frame from slipping off the trunk. 

 After making some effort, I realised that I needed strong arms and legs. Therefore, I underwent vigorous physical exercise like push-ups to strengthen my muscles before I could climb a few feet backwards, he said.

 Initially, parents Bijayenti Devi and Sakhenba Singh did not approve of their sons choice of sport. We were afraid that he would fall and injure himself. But he would not listen to us. Today we cannot help but support him, his father said.

 Till last week, Surjit had kept his talent to himself. Then, he displayed his skills to a group of residents of Lairen Sajit, his native village. I never imagined any human being could climb any tree backwards like he did, gasped B. Sunzu, who witnessed a demonstration of the rare feat.

 Since the show, Surjit has come to be known as lizard boy in his locality. His art is simple, or so he makes it seem. 

 He first positions his body, holding onto the trunk with his hands and legs; his face pointing towards the base of the trunk. Then, he climbs up backwards, using his legs to move upwards and his hands to push his body, until he reaches the end of the trunk from where the tree branches out. 

 He then manoeuvres himself down, without changing his position. 

 His mother Bijayenti Devi regretted that she could not provide an adequate diet for Surjit, the youngest of four siblings in the family of farmers. 

 Following a relatives suggestion that he should try and find a place in the Guinness Book of Records, Surjit intensified his training . He also underwent a basic mountaineering course with the Manipur Mountaineering and Trekking Association. 

 The president of the association, N. Ibungochoubi Singh, has promised all possible help to the youngster. 

 Surjit is not willing to take any chances. He wants to be fully fit and perfect before staking his claim. I am also in the process of finding out the feats of record holders in similar categories, he said.

 Plan to let schools, not govt, hire teachers

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 30: Arjun Singh is toying with a new policy for appointment of teachers in government schools to check rampant absenteeism in urban and rural areas.

 Under the proposed system, government schools would be empowered to directly hire teachers instead of being at the mercy of state and district authorities. Salaries would, however, continue to be paid by the state government.

 At present, state or district authorities recruit regular teachers and place them in schools without much regard for the specific needs of any institution.

 The new system is expected to make teachers accountable to school authorities for their attendance as well as performance, both of which are not up to the mark now.

 As there is little or no accountability in the existing system, teachers often dont turn up in school or turn up but dont take classes. They do not bother much about teaching well either.

 This has been identified by policy makers and experts as one of the main reasons for low quality education and high dropout rate in schools.

 To counter this, the model right to education bill proposed by the human resource development ministry has introduced a clause for direct hiring of teachers.

 The bill also does away with para teachers who are often hired after they pass class X. Education experts have long said such teachers can never be a substitute for regular appointments.

 Para teachers are appointed at the local level of panchayats. Many states, including Bengal, have been increasingly hiring them as they have to be paid much less than regular teachers.

 Experts say the quality of education is critical if the goal of achieving universal primary education ? the global deadline according to the millennium development goals is 2015 ? is to be meaningful.

 There are huge disparities in teacher absenteeism figures across the country. Jharkhand tops the truancy list at 41.9 per cent, followed by Bihar at 37.8 per cent, Punjab 34.4 per cent, Madhya Pradesh 17.6 per cent and Gujarat 17 per cent. Maharashtra has the best record with a truancy figure of 14.6 per cent.

 The government has also been looking into the teacher crunch in colleges and universities. Education secretary Sudeep Bannerjee sent an ultimatum to states two months ago to stop employing low-paid ad hoc teachers or face derecognition of colleges/universities.

 In a letter to chief secretaries of states, administrators of Union territories and universities, Bannerjee has laid down that posts of regular teachers should be filled up before the next academic session beginning in July-August this year.

 One extreme way of tackling this problem would be to stop further assistance to these universities and colleges which do not have regular teachers as per the norms, the letter said.

 An even more drastic step would be that of derecognising such institutions. This is an avoidable situation both because it would unnecessarily inconvenience the students and cause dislocation of their studies.

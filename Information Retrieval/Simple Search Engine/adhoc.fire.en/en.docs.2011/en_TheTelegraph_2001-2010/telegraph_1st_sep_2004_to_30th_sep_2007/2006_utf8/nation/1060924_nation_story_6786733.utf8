 Kerala cola depots ransacked

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Thiruvananthapuram, Sept. 23: Youths belonging to the ruling Left Front ransacked stores selling Coca-Cola and Pepsi in Kerala today, warning the soft drink companies against resuming sale and manufacture of the banned products.

 The youths were protesting against yesterdays high court verdict that overturned the Kerala governments ban on Coke and Pepsi.

 Activists from the Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI) and the All-India Youth Federation (AIYF) pro-CPM and CPI organisations raided depots and hurled soft drink trays. DYFI activists destroyed nearly half the stocks at two depots here.

 The partys activists attacked a depot in the northern Kozhikode district. In Palakkad, they attacked eight vans that had come to lift stocks from the Coke unit. AIYF activists tried to raid the Pepsi factory there but police prevented their entry.

 PepsiCo said it had sought police help. The company would move court if attacks continued, an official said.

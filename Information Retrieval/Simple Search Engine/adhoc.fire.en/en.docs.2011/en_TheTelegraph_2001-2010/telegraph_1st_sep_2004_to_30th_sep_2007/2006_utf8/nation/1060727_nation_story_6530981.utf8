 Boy in a spot over Sulabh stinker

 - Death 

 threat to Kalam 

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Kalam

 Indore/Bhopal, July 26: On July 17, President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam had invited the people of Madhya Pradesh to write their grievances directly to him at presidentofindia.nic.in.

 Within two days, he received a one-line message from Dinesh_asknyahoo.co.in that threatened him with death.

 When Indore police today arrested the 19-year-old sender, Sulabh Goyal stunned his interrogators by explaining he was upset with Kalam for his failure to act on an earlier complaint.

 Sulabh said his earlier email had sought a change in the name of the public toilet chain Sulabh shauchalaya, which had apparently made him a butt of jokes. Since Kalam was the head of the state, he held him responsible for the denial of justice.

 Sulabh, an Internet buff, has a habit of sending emails to those in high authority. He told Indores inspector-general of police, Shailendra Shrivastava, he had written to President George W. Bush asking to be allowed to become a US air force pilot. His current ambition is to join the Indian Army.

 Prima facie, mischief seems to be the sole motive, Srivastava said. Sulabh will be handed over to Delhi police for further questioning.

 On July 17, Kalam had addressed the Madhya Pradesh Assembly to mark 50 years of the states birth. In his televised speech, he had read out his email address and said he checked his mail every day.

 Srivastava said the offensive mail addressed to Kalam was traced to Cyber Fun, an internet caf? at Rishiraj Complex in the Navlakha area of Indore.

 Since July 19, when Rashtrapati Bhavan discreetly informed the central intelligence agencies about it, Indore police had questioned everyone in the locality who had accessed mail from the cyber caf? on July 19.

 During the probe, the police were given the jitters by reports of the Students Islamic Movement of India using Indore and other places in the state for anti-national activities. Madhya Pradesh had been the first state to ban Simi, in 1995, when Digvijay Singh was chief minister.

 The Sulabh chain of pay-and-use toilets is run by a Patna-based social service organisation. Sulabh operates and maintains more than 3,100 community toilets in 641 towns across 20 states and two Union territories.

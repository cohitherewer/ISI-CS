 Heat on nursery interviews

 CHARU SUDAN KASTURI

 All smiles

 New Delhi, Sept. 4: Smile, fathers and mothers of tiny tots admission to nursery school could soon be less of a headache.

 Delhi High Court today formed a five-member committee headed by CBSE chairman Ashok Ganguly to suggest criteria that would do away with all subjectivity in selection of students at the nursery level.

 The court said despite last years order asking private unaided schools to stop interviewing both parents and children, the pernicious practice was still on in many city schools.

 Acting Chief Justice Vijender Jain has given the panel six weeks to submit the suggestions. The next hearing is on October 17.

 An academic on the panel said one of the suggestions the committee could dwell on was neighbourhood schooling.

 The problem is arising because of too many students and too few schools. All parents want to send their children to the same top few schools, which leads to the schools resorting to various means of selection, including interviewing a four-year-old and his parents, he said.

 The solution, he said, might lie in parents sending children to schools within a certain distance from their home. But he added that a mechanism to check false information about residence was needed if neighbourhood schooling is to be effective. 

 Many parents will oppose this (neighbourhood schooling), he added.

 Schools which had been asked to come up with alternative selection guidelines by the court feel their suggestions are being misinterpreted.

 We believe it is important to meet the parents and the child. After all, the relationship is one which could last 14 years, said Jyoti Basu, principal of Springdales, one of Delhis top schools.

 Basu said the recommendations the schools forwarded to the court had mentioned conducting these interviews after the selection, to get to know the parents and child better.

 Each school has a particular conception of how to approach education. It is important that what the parents are looking for in a school should match with the schools vision, Basu added.

 The schools had also suggested neighbourhood schooling, but, according to the court, did not suggest any concrete plan of implementation.

 Most parents welcomed the courts decision. My sons were disqualified from three top schools because the authorities were not impressed by us, said Reena Kumar, a mother of four-year-old twins.

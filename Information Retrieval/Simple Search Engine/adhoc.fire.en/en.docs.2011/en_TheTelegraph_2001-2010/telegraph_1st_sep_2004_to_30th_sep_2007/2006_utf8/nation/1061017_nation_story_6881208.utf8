 Bomber on eve of Kalam visit 

 OUR BUREAU

 Oct. 16: Police today detained 

 a 10-year-old boy who was reportedly engaged by Ulfa to 

 lob bombs in the heart of Bongaigaon town as a string of 

 blasts rocked the Lower Assam town and Guwahati a day before 

 President A.P.J. Abdul Kalams visit. 

 An Ulfa militant, identified as Parimal Rai, was killed when the bomb he was trying to plant on a railway track near New Bongaigaon railway station, exploded. Minutes later, the outfit struck again at Pagalasthan railway gate. 

 The third explosion rocked the B.G. Yard in Bamunimaidam area of Guwahati this evening. Senior superintendent of police (city) Nitul Gogoi said the explosion took place in a dump of at the railway yard at 7 pm. There were no casualties.

 NF Railway officials said the packed Chennai Express had crossed the spot minutes before the militant was blown up.

 The rebel was probably trying to plant the bomb on a railway track when it went off killing him on the spot, the railway official said.

 The Brahmaputra Mail was scheduled to cross Bongaigaon minutes after the blast.

 It would have been a disaster had the rebel managed to plant the explosives on the track, the official said.

 Ulfa, fighting for an independent Assamese homeland since 1979, has been blamed for a string of explosions and grenade attacks in the past three weeks killing five persons and wounding about 50 more, including a dozen soldiers.

 Speaker sword on defectors

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Ranchi, Sept. 7: The defection drama in Jharkhand has sparked off a no-holds-barred struggle for survival, which promises more fireworks and the possibility of Presidents rule in the state. 

 While legislators supporting the UPA continue to relax outside the state, the NDA is bending over backwards to pull a rabbit out of the bag.

 Speaker Inder Singh Namdhari today raised the curtain over the next scene, when he issued notices to three MLAs under the anti-defection act, two of them former ministers who defected from the NDA and an Independent MLA, Stephen Marandi. All three are expected to vote against the NDA government during the trial of strength.

 The timing has left nobody in doubt about the Speakers next step. Let us just say we will not be surprised if the three are found guilty of defection and are consequently disqualified from attending the Assembly, said an NDA leader.

 Since rules of business of the Assembly are silent on the need of serving the notices in person, they have been delivered to the legislators local addresses, though all of them are believed to be in Delhi. 

 Since the Constitution authorises the Speaker to take decisions related to defection, NDA strategists argue, the MLAs are bound to turn up for hearing before the Speaker. If they dont, the Speaker will be free to give an ex-parte ruling.

 The petition against Anosh Ekka, one of the ministers who resigned this week, is being heard by the Speaker for over 15 months, they said, and the Speaker cannot be faulted for giving his ruling now. 

 The other former minister, Kamlesh Singh, had won the election on a Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) symbol and had taken oath in the shortlived UPA government headed by Shibu Soren in March 2005. But when the government fell in less than two weeks, he defied a whip issued by the NCP and crossed over. Now he has turned another somersault.

 The third MLA facing disqualification is former JMM MP Stephen Marandi, who contested as an Independent. He is accused of holding an office in the Babulal Marandi-led Jharkhand Vikas Morcha (Democratic).

 Namdhari maintained that the cases were plain and simple and their disposal would not take long. While the hearing of Ekkas case will take place on September 11, Stephen and Kamlesh are expected to respond latest by that day.

 Thiruvananthapuram, Jan. 16: It took a call to the Kerala chief minister for the Sri Lankan President to clear the air over his wifes visit to Guruvayur temple.

 A section of the Lankan media had reported that Mahinda Rajapakses wife Siranthi, a Christian by birth, had violated the tradition of the Sri Krishna Temple, which allows only Hindus, Buddhists and Jains on its premises.

 The President today said his wife had converted to Buddhism and the temple board ruled out any room for suspicion regarding her faith.

 Rajapakse had called up chief minister Oommen Chandy between 8 and 9 last night to clarify that his wife was a Buddhist. The Indian embassy said Siranthi was also a follower of Satya Sai Baba. 

 The President and his wife had made offerings and prayed at the temple on December 30 last year for lasting peace in the island nation.

 Chandy said Rajapakse believed the controversy had been created by his opponents.

 We were cautious and had informed New Delhi prior to the visit about the restrictions regarding temple entry at Guruvayur?. The Sri Lankan high commissioner to India, Jayasinghe, a Christian, the Presidents chief security officer Fernandes and chief of protocol, Sri Lanka, Amza, a Muslim, had stayed back at the airport during the presidential visit on December 30. They did not even accompany the couple on the copter ride to Guruvayur, Chandy said.

 The Guruvayur temple administration described the controversy as unnecessary as they had verified the faith of the Lankan First Lady.

 However, according to media reports in Kerala this morning, temple authorities had said yesterday that ritualistic cleansing would have to be done in atonement. If the Presidents wife is a Christian, we will have to redo all pujas from December 30 to the present date. Cleansing rituals will have to be done. We have already begun preparations for the cleansing rituals, main priest Chennas Raman Namboodiripad, was quoted as saying.

 Blip on radar off Pak border

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 19: The Indian Air Force scrambled two fighter aircraft from a base in Rajasthan yesterday after its radars caught a blip of an unidentified flying object approaching the international boundary with Pakistan near Bikaner.

 As per preliminary reports, there was a blip on the radar screen. The blip did not cross the International Boundary. As a precaution, two interceptors were scrambled. An inquiry is on to determine what kind of flying object it was and how close it was to the IB, air force spokesman Wing Commander Mahesh Upasani said today.

 In 2005-06, there have been nearly 50 airspace violations. These have taken place from both Indian and Pakistani sides, but have mostly been over Jammu and Kashmir. Many of the violations occurred in efforts to distribute relief to victims of the Kashmir earthquake on October 8 last year.

 Air force sources said they were not immediately concluding that Fridays was a major violation. The MiG 21 fighter aircraft were scrambled from the IAFs Suratgarh base. If the inquiry gives cause for concern, the matter will be taken up with Islamabad through the ministry of external affairs. 

 The sources speculated the radar blip may have been of an unmanned aerial vehicle. Pilotless surveillance aircraft are used by the militaries of both countries. India and Pakistan have a no-fly zone of five nautical miles that jet aircraft can cover in seconds on either side of the International Boundary that stipulates all aircraft have to be identified and military aircraft are not to fly close to the border. The uneven border makes this difficult to implement.

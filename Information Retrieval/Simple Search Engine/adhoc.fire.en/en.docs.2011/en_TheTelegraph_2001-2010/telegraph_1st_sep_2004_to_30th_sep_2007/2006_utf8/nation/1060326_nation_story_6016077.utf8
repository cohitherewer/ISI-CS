 US records rise in Indian students

Washington (PTI): The intake of foreign students, especially 

Indian and Chinese, in US graduate schools has increased by 11 per cent this year.

 According to the Council of Graduate Schools, applications from foreign students have increased by 11 per cent from 2005 to 2006 against a cumulative decline of 32 per cent for two years following the post-9/11 visa restrictions.

 The report released by the Washington-based council said large gains in the volume of applications have been from India with 23 per cent, followed by China with 21 per cent.

 India and China account for the largest foreign student population in the US with one study pegging the annual number of Indian students at 85,000.

 This increase in applications from foreign students is good news and is a result of sustained efforts by both the federal government and graduate schools, council president Debra W. Stewart said.

 However, despite the promising trends this year, the intake of foreign students is still feeling the impact of the 32 per cent drop in the last two years.

 The federal government has made considerable progress in reducing delays in visa processing and graduate institutions continue to improve their admission systems and enhance efforts to attract international applicants. But the lower volume compared to three years ago bears watching, Stewart said. 

 At this time, the relationship between the quantity and quality of applications is unclear. The issue of quality will be addressed in the next phase of the councils international graduate admissions survey, to be released in July, she said.

 Sanjay on razors edge till after Diwali

 - Court sets post-festival judgment date

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Oct. 18: Sanjay Dutt sat quietly in his usual place the last bench in the far corner of the enclosure for the accused as the special anti-terror court convicted three associates of prime accused Tiger Memon in the Bombay blasts case today.

 The actor, turned out in a light blue shirt and jeans, raised his hand and stood up when the court staff took the attendance for him and 25 other accused out on conditional bail. 

 On his second appearance since Judge Pramod Kode began to deliver the blasts verdict on September 12, the Lage Raho Munnabhai star whose Gandhigiri is the talk of the country appeared relaxed. But Dutt, who is believed to have come up with an idea for another Munnabhai sequel in which the genial goonda travels to the US, has put all new projects on hold fearing an adverse verdict.

 Special public prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam said the judgment on Dutt, accused of possessing and destroying arms and conspiracy, will be pronounced after the court sits on October 30 after a nine-day Diwali break.

 The actor and the other accused on bail, who were asked to be present in court today, have been exempted from personal appearance till further orders.

 Dutt, whose arrival had created a brief stir outside the high-security Arthur Road jail which houses the anti-terror court, left around 2.30 pm. 

 The three accused convicted today included a father-son duo, 70-year-old Issaq Hajwani and his son Sikandar Issaq Hajwani. 

 While the father has been found guilty of being a part of the conspiracy and possessing weapons, the son has been convicted of undergoing arms training at Sandheri Hills in Raigad. The training was organised by key conspirator Memon. The plan was to storm the municipal corporation, but this was dropped at the last minute. A third accused, Shahnawaz Dadamiya Hajwani, was also found guilty of undergoing training.

 The number of convictions has risen to 53 and 19 accused have been let off so far.

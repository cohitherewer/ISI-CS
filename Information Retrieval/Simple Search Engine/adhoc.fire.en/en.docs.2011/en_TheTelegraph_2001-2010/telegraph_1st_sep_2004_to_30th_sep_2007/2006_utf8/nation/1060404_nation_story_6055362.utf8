 EC scanner on Singh code

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 3: The Election Commission is looking into the BJPs allegations that the Prime Minister violated the model code of conduct on the eve of the first phase of polls in Assam.

 The BJP has accused Manmohan Singh of announcing a financial package of Rs 602 crore for the rehabilitation of the families of those killed or injured in last years tribal conflicts in the state during campaigning.

 The Prime Minister had addressed a public meeting at Dankamokam in Karbi Anglong district yesterday.

 The government has said a memorandum for relief was submitted to the Prime Minister but he made no announcement. 

 The commission is looking into the matter, deputy election commissioner R. Balakrishnan said.

 A five-member BJP delegation submitted a memorandum to the poll panel today, urging it to initiate punitive and corrective action against the Prime Minister.

 Such an announcement almost takes the form of an inducement by way of bribery to the voters of a particular constituency, the party alleged.

 The BJP delegation included M.A. Naqvi, Ravi Shankar Prasad, S.S. Ahluwalia, Prakash Javadekar and R. Ramakrishna.

 Assam also came under the commissions spotlight when it took exception to parties holding news meets after campaigning had ended in the state.

 Sources said the poll panel ordered that cases be filed against Brindaban Goswami and A. Bhattacharjee of the Asom Gana Parishad and Telugu Desam Party leader Rama Mohan Rao for violating the model code of conduct.

 Assams chief electoral officer has been directed to ask the district poll officer of Kamrup to file cases under provisions of the Representation of the People Act against the three who held a news conference in Guwahati yesterday.

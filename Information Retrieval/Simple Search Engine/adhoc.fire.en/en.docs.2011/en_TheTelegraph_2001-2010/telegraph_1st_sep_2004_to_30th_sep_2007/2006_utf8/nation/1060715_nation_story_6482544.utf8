NATION BRIEFS

 New Delhi, July 14: The telecom tribunal today asked STAR TV to provide its channels to Dish TV, giving a boost to companies launching direct-to-home television services.

 The Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) told the Rupert Murdoch-controlled STAR to make available in 15 days the channels it had so far withheld from the Zee-promoted Dish TV.

 The tribunal also ruled that direct-to-home providers should pay only about half of what cable service operators pay for STAR channels. This is apparently because in DTH ? which eliminates the cable operator and subscribers get access to channels through a small dish antennae ? less number of people share the revenue made from the customer.

 The TDSAT ruling will be applicable to other operators entering into commercial deals with broadcasters. 

 New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Friday turned its glare on Publicity Interest Litigation, Private Interest Litigation and Paise Income Litigation that are often camouflaged as Public Interest Litigation and asked high courts to act ruthlessly while dealing with the imposters.

 The observation came after the court found that a woman had filed a PIL alleging irregularities in an auction in which she was herself a bidder. The court said because of such trumpery proceedings initiated before courts, innumerable days are wasted, which otherwise could have been spent for disposal of cases of genuine litigants. 

 The attractive brand name of PIL should not be used for suspicious products of mischief.

 Thiruvananthapuram: The Sabarimala temple in Thrissur has begun washing off the sin committed by Kannada actress Jayamala, who recently said she had offered prayers there and touched the deity two decades ago. 

 The temple, which allows people of all faiths, bars the entry of women between 10 and 50 years of age.

 Authorities of the temple board started the penance by offering kheer, three fistful of coins and bunches of banana leaves.

 The board members will repeat their act at five other temples in Kerala before returning to the Sabarimala hill shrine, where they will do penance at the main priests manor. The main priest will then carry out remedial measures next month.

 Three Maoist women die in encounter

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Hyderabad, April 2: Five rebels, including three women, were killed in an encounter in a forest near the Andhra Pradesh-Chhattisgarh border in the early hours today.

 About 15 armed CPI (Maoist) rebels fired at police commandos combing the forest area near Mukkanur village in Khammam district, 210 km north-east of Hyderabad.

 They were holding a meeting atop a hill in the dense forest when a team of Andhra Pradesh and Chhattisgarh police cordoned off the area and asked the rebels to surrender.

 When the Maoists did not heed the warning, the police opened fire, killing five of them, said R.K. Meena, the police superintendent of Khammam. Throwing grenades at the police, the rest of the rebels escaped in the darkness.

 The encounter is said to be the first outcome of joint operations between Chhattisgarh and Andhra police after last weeks meeting of police chiefs in Delhi, where they resolved to share information and resources.

 Chhattisgarh police had informed their counterparts in Andhra Pradesh about the Maoists hilltop meeting and sealed all routes on the border.

 The police have identified one of the dead rebels as Shyam, a deputy commander of the Venkatapuram local guerrilla squad.

 According to Chhattisgarh police, the rebels, who were allegedly involved in an attack on a police outpost in Dantewada district, crossed over to Andhra Pradesh yesterday.

 The rebels have been fighting for land rights of the rural poor and peasants for three decades and over 6,500 persons have been killed in encounters. The Maoists, who held peace talks with the Andhra government in October 2004, used the ceasefire to regroup, recruit and train cadre.

 A senior home ministry official said there are 20,000 armed rebels and their supporters are spread across 12 states. Their objective is to turn Dandakaranya into a janathan sarkar (liberated state) and form a guerrilla corridor between Andhra Pradesh and Nepal.

 The spokesman for the Maoists during peace talks, 65-year-old poet Pendyala Varavara Rao, was released from a jail here on Friday. He has accused the authorities of foisting false cases and illegally detaining him for seven months.

 They arrested me from my home clandestinely on August 17 under the Public Security Act for being a member of a banned organisation and kept me behind bars even after the ban on revolutionary writers was lifted on November 17, Rao said on the sidelines of a meeting yesterday.

 Rao said he was willing to participate in peace talks again if assured of immunity from the police.

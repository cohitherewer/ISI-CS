 SC Taj safety nudge

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 9: The Supreme Court today directed the Uttar Pradesh government to list what steps it was planning to take to protect the Taj Mahal against unchecked rush of visitors on festive occasions.

 A bench headed by Justice S.B. Sinha, which had taken serious note of reports on forceful entry by visitors, had earlier asked the government to file an affidavit stating the steps it had taken to implement a contingency plan proposed in 2001.

 Though the government had filed an affidavit, the court sought a fresh one as it had only dealt with security in the complex and not outside. The court asked the government to respond within three weeks. 

 While the security within the complex is managed by the CISF, state police are in charge of the security outside. 

 Amicus curiae Krishan Mahajan said there was a heavy rush of visitors on six festive occasions, including Ram Barat, every year.

 On the setting up of a facilitation centre, the solicitor-general told the court there was no land outside the complex. Mahajan, however, said land was available and, even otherwise, it could be acquired.

 The court then asked a monitoring committee to visit the city and file a report.

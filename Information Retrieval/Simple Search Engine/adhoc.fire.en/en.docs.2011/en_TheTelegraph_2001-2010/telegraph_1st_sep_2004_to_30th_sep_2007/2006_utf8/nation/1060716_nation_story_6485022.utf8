 Puri hotel hostage

 Bhubaneswar, July 15: A woman from Howrah who had alleged harassment by employees of a Puri hotel where she had overstayed without paying was today allowed to leave after the Orissa state commission for women intervened.

 Arundhati Sarkar lodged a complaint with the womens commission yesterday, requesting them to rescue her from the hotel where she had run up a bill of over Rs 4 lakh and was not being allowed to leave.

 Arundhati, who hails from Dankuni in Howrah, claimed she had been deserted by her husband Mukesh Khanna, who has left for Bhubaneswar. 

 She said Khanna had brought her and their child to the Puri hotel on Swargadwar Road in September. After a week, he left her and never returned.

 Arundhati said Khannas real name is Manoranjan Ray and he was married before he met her in Bhubaneswar.

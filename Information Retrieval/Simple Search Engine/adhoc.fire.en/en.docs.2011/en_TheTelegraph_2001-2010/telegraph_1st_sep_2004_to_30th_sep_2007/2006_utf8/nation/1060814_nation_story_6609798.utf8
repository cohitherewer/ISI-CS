 Terror on top in PMs Red Fort sermon

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Manmohan Singh

 New Delhi, Aug. 13: The world wants India to do well but terrorism, regional inequality and unemployment are key challenges that is expected to be the central theme of Manmohan Singhs address this Independence Day.

 The Prime Minister will stay off political overtones that could be suggestive of the pressures he faces from the Left and UPA allies. It will be a broad-based speech looking ahead at the challenges after two years in power. Any major policy announcement is unlikely, too. 

 On terrorism, however, words will not be minced. Singh will have a stiff message for neighbours, mainly Pakistan and Bangladesh. He could tell them that unless they battle the challenge of terrorism with the same degree of commitment and gravity as India, South Asia cannot become a powerful conglomerate. 

 Pakistan and Bangladeshs commitment to fighting terrorism has to be much more visible, said sources close to the Prime Minister. 

 Singhs tough stance has been prompted by the assessment that the US, UK and Europe understand Indias problems better every time they face an attack or a threat. Almost all such incidents including last weeks plot to blow up air- craft had a Pakistan connection. 

 This has given Singh and his officials the feeling that the government need not underplay its own perception of Pakistans role in terror strikes carried out in Kashmir and elsewhere in India, sources said.

 However, the August 15 address could make a distinction between the terrorists and Muslims, sending the reassurance that the entire community will not be tarred with the same brush. 

 There is discontent in the Congresss minorities cell, many of whose members feel the UPA government is not being upfront on Israels offensive against Lebanon. The Prime Minister may make a passing reference to the crisis with an observation that all developing countries need peace and security to go ahead.

 The address could be peppered with the expected assertion on how the countrys sovereignty and interests will not be bartered away in international dealings. But Singh may be silent on the nuclear deal with the US. 

 One reason could be that he is scheduled to speak on the thorny issue in the Rajya Sabha on August 17.

 We have told the PM that India should not accept any changes detrimental to the national interests or nuclear sovereignty, CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury said in Ludhiana today. His party, along with other Left allies, opposes the nuclear pact in its current form.

 BARRIER BREAKERS

 In 2006, the woman next door went where she had never been before, sometimes seeking glory but often out of necessity. We feature some of them

 Big-stage woman

 Pune rsquo;s Sheetal Mahajan, 24, was just another middle-class college student when she heard a friend rsquo;s brother, a parachute instructor, say that no woman had ever taken a free-fall para-jump over the South Pole. Three years later, on December 15, 2006, she became the woman who did, taking the 12,000-foot plunge in minus 38 degrees armed with just three-four days rsquo; training and an iron resolve.

 In between, she did the North Pole with no training, 

 taking her maiden parachute jump at the end of her debut plane ride. When, for a time, it seemed she might not get her shot at glory at all, she met President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam and persuaded him to come to her aid. 

 Ambition, Mumbai-maid

 In between cooking for their own families and washing clothes for their employers', 20 domestic workers in Mumbai will be contesting the municipal polls. The move, a first in the country, is aimed at winning some rights and benefits, such as mandatory leave. 

 ldquo;I represent other poor people, too, rdquo; said Malan Sonawane, 40, the odds-on favourite from ward 87 in Golibar. She has been fielded by the Ghar Kamghar Mulkarni Sanghatana, which counts 25,000 household helps as its members. Supported by CPI labour arm Aituc, they represent the Left rsquo;s best hope of winning a seat ldquo;in any kind of election in Mumbai for years rdquo;.

 The rising

 Like Sheetal, the women of 

 Uttaranchal have conquered poles, but of a different kind. They are 

 clambering up electricity poles, fixing glitches. At other times, they are 

 taking meter readings and running to deliver the bills at homes in the farthest-flung of hamlets. India rsquo;s village women have begun doing what only men were thought capable of: helping electricity distribution and 

 maintenance.

 Fed up with its shirking, drunken male workers, the Uttaranchal Power Corporation signed up 400 women to read electricity meters, prepare bills and deliver them. The 

 result: revenue collection is up 20 per cent. More women are queuing for the job. Kalpana Bhatt, a widow with three kids, said, ldquo;I have to climb electricity poles and fix transformers and line faults. But so what? This is no rocket 

 science; I can do it easily. rdquo;

 Crisis manager

 If the candlelight on the tsunami's 

 second anniversary glimmered with hope, hand it to the fisherwomen of the south. As governments rebuild the smashed houses, the women are rebuilding 

 households, learning new livelihoods that now bring their 

 families more money than fishing ever did. With NGO help, they have set up poultry farms 

 or shifted to making fish pickles, adding value to their catch. Some are doing ldquo;crab fattening rdquo;.

 Mumbai, Oct. 16: Reviving memories of underworld gangwars on Mumbai streets, two undertrials facing charges in a drug seizure case were gunned down by three unidentified assailants in a dramatic attack in a busy office area this afternoon.

 Amjad Hussain Khan, 36, and Himanshu Chaudhary, 32, were crossing a traffic intersection at Kala Ghoda after a court hearing when three men fired several rounds at them from point-blank range. 

 Khan collapsed with nine bullet injuries, including three in his head. Chaudhary took three bullets in the chest. Both were rushed to G.T. Hospital, where they were declared dead on arrival.

 The shooting triggered panic in the Kala Ghoda area, which houses several heritage buildings, including the Jehangir Art Gallery, Mumbai University, Elphinstone College and the David Sassoon Library.

 Witnesses told Colaba police that the three men walked away towards the Bombay Stock Exchange after the attack. Based on their descriptions, the police have drawn sketches and are investigating if the strike has connections with underworld outfits.

 The incident happened around 1 pm, when Khan and Chaudhary emerged from the sessions court after a hearing before judge S. P. Kulkarni. 

 Arrested by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act in connection with the seizure of 516 kg of mandrax from Juhu in 2000, the two have been on bail since 2002. 

 The judge had adjourned the hearing to 2.30 pm because the lawyer for the duo, Shyam Keswani, was not present in the court.

 I was stuck in the adjacent Bombay High Court and, therefore, the court adjourned the matter to the post-lunch session starting at 2.30 pm. During the break, Khan decided to offer namaaz. Chaudhary wanted to have lunch. The case was in its final stages, and I was to cross-examine the last witness when the attack happened, Keswani told The Telegraph.

 Deputy commissioners Brajesh Singh and D. Kamlakar, supervising investigations at the scene, did not rule out the possibility of the attack being a part of underworld gangwars.

 DRI sources, too, say Khan had links with the Chhota Rajan gang. The use of automatic pistols is also seen as an indication the underworlds involvement.

 DRI officials said Khan and Chaudhary were the only ones among the five accused in the case who were out on bail. While Sharif Tarave and Abdul Ahsraf Akhatir are in legal custody, the fifth, Mohammed Abdullah, is absconding.

 Thi sessions court at Kala Ghoda is no stranger to gangwars. Crime branch sources said that in the early 1980s, Dawoods men had shot down Amirzada when he was brought for a hearing. Amirzada, part of the Pathan gang, had killed Dawoods brother-in-law Sharif Parkar.

 In 1994, Arun Gawlis men, dressed in lawyers black coats, fired at Amar Naiks younger brother Ashwin, paralysing him below the waist. 

 In 1996, Sadhu Shetty was luckier. The Rajan associate escaped his assailants bullets and a police team led by then deputy commissioner Deepak Jog spirited him back to jail.

 BJP seniors call shots, juniors wait

 Advani, Vajpayee: Still at the helm

 New Delhi, Sept. 22: The tussle over candidates who would contest byelections to the Vidisha and Bhagalpur Lok Sabha seats is showing just how difficult it is for the RSS to pull the BJP out of the shadow of its twin towers Atal Bihari Vajpayee and L.K. Advani.

 In Madhya Pradeshs Vidisha, the old guard is bypassing the second rung and pitching for a third-generation aspirant Varun Gandhi. The seat is up for grabs because Shivraj Singh Chauhan quit as an MP of this constituency to become chief minister.

 Since then, the BJP has been agog with speculation that a second-rung leader will be picked for the slot. The names of Sushma Swaraj and Arun Jaitley did the rounds for some time. Chauhan wants to field his wife Sadhana Singh, but the party is unlikely to settle on her.

 Eventually, it could be a toss-up between Sushma and Varun with both Vajpayee and Advani favouring the Gandhi scion for their own reasons.

 The party has its own logic for fielding Sushma. None of the top leaders in the second-rung contested the Lok Sabha polls. The BJP is well represented in the Rajya Sabha, but in the Lok Sabha, it is only Vajpayeeji and Advaniji. It was felt one of the second-rung leaders should share the work in Lok Sabha, said a senior leader.

 However, the two seniors have shown no willingness to share responsibility. The ostensible reason for Advani to back Varun is that he has personal relations with the family. But sources said the reality is that neither of the two veterans wants to be overshadowed by a younger leader. Sushma is a very able parliamentarian. There are obviously powerful interests blocking her entry into the Lok Sabha, a source said.

 In Bhagalpur the seat former BJPs Sushil Kumar Modi vacated to become Bihar deputy chief minister in November former minister Shahnawaz Hussain is a strong contender, but Vajpayee has thrown his weight behind local big-wig Nishi Kant Dubey.

 Shahnawaz was the BJPs key campaigner for the Bihar elections. Its alliance partner, Janata Dal (United), was wary of Hindutva colours in the campaign. Shahnawaz easily became the BJPs Muslim face. Ever since, he has been hoping to be rewarded. 

 But Vajpayee has been favouring Nishi Kant. Try as the Sangh might, it has not been able to render the two old men (Advani and Vajpayee) irrelevant, a BJP source said.

 Naxalite plan, via Howrah

 MANAN KUMAR

 New Delhi, July 19: Jolted by the ferocity of the Naxalite raid on a safe-haven camp in Chhattisgarh, the Centre is looking with renewed interest at a five-year extremist plan to exploit labour unrest in the industrial belts running from Bhilai to Howrah in the east and from Ahmedabad to Pune in the west.

 The Naxalite blueprint seeks to step up the rebels presence in Bengal and break new ground in Assam, Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh by 2011, according to officials.

 The draft of the Naxalite blueprint, so far gathering dust because investigating agencies did not initially lend much credence to it, is expected to be dissected at a meeting to be convened by the home ministry within a week.

 Naxalite literature confiscated primarily from Chhattisgarh and some areas of Jharkhand and Andhra Pradesh in the last few months reveal that the extremists have already established zonal committees in the four states and are moving in a systematic manner to set up trained militia to spread the war to more states by 2011.

 The literature describes the two industrial belts as the route to take the battle to the urban areas by exploiting the simmering unrest due to retrenchment, class differences and disparity in wages.

 The worrying factor for the home ministry is the precision with which the rebels had implemented their earlier plan, made in the early nineties, to spread their reach in nine states. 

 The security officials who got hold of the Naxalite plan then had taken it lightly and rejected it altogether. But now we know that the Naxalites stuck to their script. Their future plan cannot be taken lightly anymore, said a source.

 According to the officials, the road map of the rebels gives a step-by-step description of how they expect to reach a dominant position in the four states.

 The first is the documentation stage, which the sources say, the Naxalites wrapped up at least a year ago. 

 The extremists have carried out surveys on different areas of all the four states to analyse the socio-economic and cultural aspects. The areas covered include the caste system, the economic structure of different castes and sub-castes, labour issues and problems faced by the disadvantaged sections.

 The second stage talks of establishing zonal committees and opening cultural organisations in areas where unrest is growing.

 Internal security analysts said the Naxalites have crossed this stage also in the four states and their cultural machinery has started functioning.

 The third stage involves infiltrating agitations over local issues and raising their pitch, approaching volatile elements, indoctrinating them and arranging meetings with the central leadership.

 The fourth and final phase will seek to co-opt the brightest from the working force and establish militia groups in key areas of industrial belts.

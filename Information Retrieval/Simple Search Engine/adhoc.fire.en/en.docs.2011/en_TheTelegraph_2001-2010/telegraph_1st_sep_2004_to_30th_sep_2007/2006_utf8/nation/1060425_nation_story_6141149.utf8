 US tries to clear N-deal cloud

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 24: Amid growing concerns about snags hitting the Indo-US nuclear deal, Washington today clarified that it recognises Delhis stand against joining the non-proliferation treaty (NPT) and to maintain a strategic programme.

 In a statement released by the US embassy in Delhi, Washington said it believes India will maintain a strategic nuclear programme but most of its future growth would be on the civilian side.

 Officials said the US reiterated its position to allay apprehensions about the deal hitting a roadblock. The clarification was prompted by reports about serious differences between the two sides on the introduction of additional clauses in the pact, including one that barred India from testing a nuclear weapon. India has rejected the clause.

 The statement said Washington does not recognise India as a nuclear weapon state and does not seek to amend or renegotiate the NPT. We understand, however, that India will not join the NPT as a non-nuclear weapon state.

 The US said it had sought an exemption for India from the full-scope safeguards requirement of the Nuclear Suppliers Group guidelines, and would amend its own law to allow Delhi access to the international civil nuclear market.

 The separation of Indias nuclear programme, the declaration of its civilian facilities, and the placement of those facilities under International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards will help ensure that nuclear material, equipment and technologies supplied by NSG members are exclusively applied to the civil sector, the statement said.

 This assurance is in line with the obligations of the countries that are party to the NPT, which includes all members of the NSG.

 The US said it was firm on the joint statements of July 18, 2005 and March 2, 2006, which recognised Indias strong record on nuclear technology exports and its commitment to work within a global non-proliferation regime to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons.

 It reiterated that it recognises Indias increasing energy needs to sustain a growth rate of over 8 per cent that will be fulfilled through nuclear power. However, such technologies cannot be shared without India accepting the agreement, the statement said.

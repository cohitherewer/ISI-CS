 Biman Bose: The party will not poke its nose in CAB matters

 Calcutta, July 31: Biman Bose lost his temper today when pushed for a reaction to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees statement on the CAB elections and Jyoti Basus response to it.

 The CPM state secretary, at pains to underline that the party had nothing to do with the polls, had looked uncomfortable as he fielded one question after another on the same issue at the Alimuddin Street headquarters.

 If the present issue warrants a discussion, it can be discussed. But the party has no stake in CAB elections, he snapped, when asked repeatedly if the CPM secretariat would take it up as Basu had suggested.

 Told that the party patriarch had been looking for him to discuss the chief ministers comments, Bose said: If he (Basu) wants to have a talk with me in this regard, it would not be a problem.

 But the state secretary refused to comment on Bhattacharjees description of the election result as a victory of evil over good. 

 I am not aware of what the chief minister has said. I shall speak to him tomorrow when we meet. Buddha has made certain remarks as the chief minister. So I shall not comment before talking to him, he said.

 Basu had expressed surprise at the chief ministers reaction and said the matter should be taken up by the CPM secretariat on Friday.

 The CPM secretary stressed the party will not interfere in CAB affairs, but added that he had been told police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee, who lost the battle for the presidents post to Jagmohan Dalmiya, had said the election was democratic.

 Asked to clarify his partys stand in the light of comments by the chief minister, his predecessor Basu and sports minister Subhas Chakraborty, Bose was furious. 

 I have told you time and again that our party has no stake in CAB elections. Let this be clear to one and all. Our party will not put its finger in every pie. 

 You people have been asking this question several times and I have been saying repeatedly that the party will not poke its nose in CAB matters, he said. 

 Why are you people trying to put words in my mouth? This is not done.

 Reminded that he had briefed the media on a discussion on the CAB elections at an earlier CPM secretariat meeting, Bose erupted: At that time I was told that Eden Gardens had not been hosting international matches and that a change of guard was required in CAB. 

 I never said that it was my observation. My statement was that I had been told this. You people dont have any right to distort my statements.

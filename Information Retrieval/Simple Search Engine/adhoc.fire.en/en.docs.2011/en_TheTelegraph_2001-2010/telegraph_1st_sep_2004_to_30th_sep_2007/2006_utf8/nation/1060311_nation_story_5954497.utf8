 Jaya, Amar: In same boat 

 New Delhi, March 10: Jaya Bachchan today moved the Supreme Court for a clarification on offices of profit that disqualify the holder from Parliament membership.

 The Election Commission has recommended Jayas disqualification from the Rajya Sabha on the ground that as chairperson of the Uttar Pradesh Film Development Board, she holds an office of profit.

 The actor-turned-MP today filed an intervention application in a disposed-of matter on Shibu Sorens disqualification from the Rajya Sabha in 2001. 

 Her application came on a day close associate Amar Singh, also elected to the Rajya Sabha on a Samajwadi Party ticket, received a notice from the poll panel. He, too, faces disqualification for holding an office of profit, as chairperson of the Uttar Pradesh Development Council. 

 Amar has been asked to file a written reply on or before March 31, sources said. He said his lawyer would reply. 

 Chief election commissioner B.B. Tandon said a petition against the Samajwadi Party leader had been made to the President, who had referred it to the panel. The commission has to follow the legal and constitutional provisions and send the necessary opinion to the President and that process has started, he said.

 On July 19, 2001, the Supreme Court had upheld a Patna High Court order disqualifying Soren for holding an office of profit. 

 Under Article 102 of the Constitution, a member of the Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha stands disqualified for holding an office of profit under the government unless he holds an office declared by Parliament by law not to disqualify its holder.

 Jayas application said office of profit was not defined in the Constitution or the Representation of Peoples Act and there was a need for clear guidelines.

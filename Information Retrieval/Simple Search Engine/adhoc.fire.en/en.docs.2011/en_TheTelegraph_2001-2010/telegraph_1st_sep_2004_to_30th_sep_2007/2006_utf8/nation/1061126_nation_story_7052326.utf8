 Mohan Gidwanis photograph of mating damselflies

 New Delhi, Nov. 25: Graphic artist Sarbajit Sarbjana has rendered a pregnant womans abdomen as the orb of a giant planet. Mohan Gidwani, heir to a century-old sweets shop, has captured the mating ritual of damselflies as a ballet of red, purple and yellow hues. And Herak Nandy, a wildlife enthusiast, has shown how an insect skates on water.

 The images by the three amateur photographers are among the top winning entries in a national science photography contest Lights and Shades of Science.

 The contest organised by the department of science and technology and the R.R. Mehta Educational Trust received over 5,000 entries, from which prizes were awarded to 66 in five themes. This is an attempt to create synergy between art and science through photography, said Anjali Rai Mehta of the trust. Weve found that photography can be an excellent vehicle to communicate science.

 The images cover science in action a photograph by Imphal-based Rajkumar Kishor showing the abrupt dispersal of seeds from a plant by gusts of wind bagged the first prize. Calcutta-based Nandy got the first prize in science close-up through an image that shows a water-strider virtually using the surface of water like a sheet of rubber.

 There is science in the water-walking act. The body weight of the insect counterbalances the surface tension of the water and allows it to stand floating in the water. It was tricky because this insect moves very fast, perhaps a metre per second, said Nandy.

 The photograph by Sarbjana was made at home. The 33-year-old New Delhi-based artist captured a high-contrast close-up of the abdomen of his pregnant wife and sent it as his entry titled The Beginning.

 Bhargava Dangar from Rajkot sent in an X-ray image of a dog catching a disc. Gidwani won several prizes, including the second and third prizes for science in action. He bagged the third prize for the science in society theme for a picture showing a pelican with a plastic bottle in its mouth.

 Photographer Bandeep Singh of Delhi juxtaposed aged hands on the face of a young woman to win the second prize for an entry titled Ever-Youth.

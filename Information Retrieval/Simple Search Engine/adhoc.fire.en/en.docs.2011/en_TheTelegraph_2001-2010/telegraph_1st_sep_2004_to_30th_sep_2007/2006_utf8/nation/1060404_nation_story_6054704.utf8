 Rebels kill DSP

 Patna, April 3: A deputy superintendent of police was killed in an encounter with suspected Naxalites in Rohtas district today, reports our special correspondent.

 Police said the subdivisional police officer of Bikramganj, Akhileshwar Prasad, was leading a team to Matihar village, around 150 km south-west of Patna, on a tip-off that kidnappers of a boy were holed up in the village.

 Instead, nearly three dozen Naxalites were present in the village, planning an operation, the police added.

 The police team encircled the extremists but while retreating, the rebels opened fire in which Singh was fatally wounded. After the heavy exchange of fire, police recovered a carbine, three rifles and ammunition.

 Taken first to the Bikramganj hospital, around 25 km from the spot, the police officer died while he was being brought to Patna for treatment.

 Rohtas superintendent of police N.H. Khan said the district police had recently mounted operations against the Naxalites. Khan said the special task force and the district police had launched a joint combing operation to trace the Naxalites.

 The development came on a day when Patna High Court constituted a seven-member committee for effective control of crime in the state.

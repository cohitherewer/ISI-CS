 Mumbai, Nov. 29: Prayers all night, tense moments in court and then, a sigh of relief over the part-acquittal.

 The Dutts had too much of it, all in a day. But, after dusk, spirits at Imperial Heights were lifted with a quiet celebration that Sanjay hosted for close friends and family members.

 Sisters Priya, Namrata, brother-in-law Kumar Gaurav and Priyas associates in the Congress, Baba Siddiqui and Baldev Khosa, were there, as was Ajay Marwah. Dino Morea, Dalip Tahil, Viveik Oberoi also turned up. Vidhu Vinod Chopra and Rajkumar Hirani, the makers of Lage Raho Munnabhai, also put in an appearance.

 Sanjay has been summoned by the Tada court on Thursday to record his statement, where he is likely to plead for a lenient sentence. The star faces five to 10 years in jail. 

 Absolved of the charges under the Indian Penal Code and Tada which could have earned him a life term or even death Dutt has to turn himself in to police on December 19.

 His lawyers and the Maharashtra government were guarded in their reactions. 

 Chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh said in Delhi the state government would study the Tada court verdict on Dutt before taking any decision to challenge it in the Supreme Court. Lawyer Satish Maneshinde said he would appeal, but only after the Tada court has handed out the verdicts. Asked if he would approach Bombay High Court, he said: We will approach the adequate appeal court. 

 The Tada courts orders can only be challenged in the Supreme Court. Abu Salem had tried to challenge the separation in high court, but was asked to move the apex court.

 Legally speaking, Judge Pramod Kode of the Tada court will complete his judgment only when he has handed down the sentences to each of the 123 accused in the 1993 blasts.

 Before that, he will hear arguments from the prosecution and the defence on the degree of punishment. So far, he has only heard the four Memon family members who were convicted on September 12, the first day of the staggered judgments.

 The last sentence is expected to be pronounced sometime in January. The court also closes for a Christmas vacation.

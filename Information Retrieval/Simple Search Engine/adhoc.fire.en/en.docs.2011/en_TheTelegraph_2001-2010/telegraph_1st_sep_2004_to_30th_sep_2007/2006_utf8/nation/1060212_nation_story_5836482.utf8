 Mulford letter annoys govt

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 11: The Centre is reportedly unhappy that US envoy David Mulford sent Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee a letter protesting against his alleged reference to George W. Bush as the leader of an organised pack of killers.

 It is not known if Manmohan Singh will follow up on the Bengal chief ministers letter objecting to Mulfords missive, but government sources informally said none was likely to approve of the US envoys style of functioning.

 They said that according to protocol Mulford should have approached the US secretary of state, conveyed his displeasure and left it to him to summon the Indian ambassador in Washington. 

 The sources said with Bushs visit coming up in March, it is unlikely that the Prime Minister would act on Bhattacharjees protest. He would not want to vitiate the already-muddied atmosphere, they said.

 There have been reports that the Left proposes to demonstrate against Bush, Indias voting with the US on the Iran nuclear issue and some of Mulfords statements during the March visit. It has also threatened to boycott any joint Parliament session Bush might address, raising the possibility that he might not do so.

 Last month, Mulford raised the Lefts hackles twice: one, by saying that if India did not vote against Irans nuclear programme, the fallout on the Indo-US nuclear deal would be devastating two, by asking why the Left was opposed to FDI in retail.

 Are they opposed to farmers and business guys and others getting credit for developing their livelihoods and their businesses? I dont understand what their opposition is about because the beneficiaries are the regular working people of India, Mulford had said in an interview.

 On an earlier occasion, he had pitched for 50 per cent FDI in insurance, prompting CPI leader D. Raja to call it an outright intervention in our internal affairs.

 After the US washed its hands of Mulfords Iran statement, the storm abated a little. Sources said any remaining suspicion would be cleared by Singhs statement on the nuclear deal in Parliament and the discussion that is expected to follow.

 The sources said the views aired by Anil Kakodkar, chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, in a recent interview went a long way in establishing the governments bona fides on the pact.

 The Congress is steeped in the legacy of Nehru, the author of the Non-Aligned Movement, and Homi J. Bhabha who brought the Indian nuclear programme to life and set its priorities and direction.

 To insinuate that our government will break out of this framework and allow the US to dictate terms or negotiate is ridiculous.

 Our conditions and priorities were already spelt out to Washington (in July 2005) and it is for the US to like or lump them, a source said.

 Denying reports that Singh had ticked off Kakodkar for speaking out of turn, the sources justified the nuclear establishments position. 

 Let the US know we have a vibrant scientific community which is strongly patriotic. Just as they have divergent views, which are articulated by intellectuals and scientists with tacit backing of their establishment, so also is the case in India. This must be respected by the US, the source said.

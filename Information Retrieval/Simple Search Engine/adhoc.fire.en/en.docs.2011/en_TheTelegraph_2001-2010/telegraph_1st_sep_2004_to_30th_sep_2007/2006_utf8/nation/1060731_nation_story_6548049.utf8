 Etawah (Uttar Pradesh), July 30: With its two glittering stadiums, airport, an institute of medical sciences and a post-graduate college, Sefais success story should have been a beacon of hope for every heartland hamlet.

 Only if it werent the home village of chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav.

 Dharam Singh Jatav of Heonra, just 3 km from Sefai, is certain that his impoverished, underdeveloped village will never see a fraction of the prosperity that has been bestowed on its neighbour.

 Only Sefai has a chief minister in Uttar Pradesh, we dont, Jatav said. The wage labourer believes Sefai will continue to corner whatever development happens in the region.

 The state budget this year set aside Rs 300 crore for Sefai so that its airport could be lifted to international standards and its already gleaming roads further beautified. A third stadium is coming up at the village of 4,000 residents ? mostly Yadav kinsmen of Mulayam ? and a paramedical college is in the offing.

 The villages four huge, luxurious government guesthouses can shame any in the cities; the Chaudhary Charan Singh post-graduate college has a sprawling campus with hostels for boys and girls.

 In the middle of all this, stands the palatial residence of Mulayam, flanked by the houses of his relatives.

 Sefai also has two colleges teaching plus-two courses, round-the-clock power and water supply, and is linked to every important town in the region through pucca roads.

 The trek to Heonra, though, is another matter. The 2.5 km between Heonra and the Sefai-Etawah road is little more than a dirt track punctuated by slush-filled ditches that grow bigger whenever it rains.

 There are only two hand-pumps for over 250 families in Heonra. While Sefai has 24-hour power supply, we dont get electricity even for seven to eight hours, said Albar Singh Katheria.

 The situation is no better in the five other villages located within a 5-km radius of Sefai ? Ranua, Perari, Patha, Rabaiyapur and Nangla Sobhan. These villages are dominated by the Scheduled Castes, including Katherias and Jatavs, who are seen as supporters of the Bahujan Samaj Party.

 We were thrilled when huge structures started coming up in Sefai. We thought the government had finally turned its gaze towards us and development would soon arrive to our village, too, said Santosh Kumar, a Scheduled Caste resident of Nangla Sobhan.

 But not only did all the big and small contracts go to Mulayams relatives and his caste men, the progress remained confined to Sefai alone.

 The Dalits complain that during election time, Mulayams men often stop them from voting.

 On the day of polling, the Yadavs (who are Samajwadi Party supporters) occupy the booths. Fighting them is impossible without police support, said Narai Singh Jatav of Perari.

 Sefais development has occurred in phases coinciding with Mulayams chief ministership, most of it during his current stint, which began in August 2003. The Samajwadi leader earlier headed the state government from December 1989 to February 1991 and then from December 1994 to May 1995.

 Mulayams only setback while championing the cause of his home village came when he billed it ahead of Lucknow and Ayodhya as a place of cultural and historical interest.

 The chief minister was eyeing central funds for a centre to research and showcase Sefais culture and heritage in preference to those of Lucknow, Ayodhya, Baghpat and Jhansi. Delhi nixed the plan.

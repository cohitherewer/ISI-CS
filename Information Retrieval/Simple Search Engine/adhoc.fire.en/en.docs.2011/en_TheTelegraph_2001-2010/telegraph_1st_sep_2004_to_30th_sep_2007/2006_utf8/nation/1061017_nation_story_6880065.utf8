 Panel for pvt job quota

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Meira Kumar

 New Delhi, Oct. 16: Prime 

 Minister Manmohan Singh today constituted a coordination 

 committee headed by his principal secretary, T.K.A. Nair, 

 to prepare a report within six months on job reservation 

 for Dalits and tribals in the private sector.

 The five-member panel of secretaries formed months before elections in Uttar Pradesh will suggest ways in which the Centre can assist and support the process of implementing such a job quota. 

 With a view of taking the process forward by ensuring a national dialogue leading to a time-bound action programme, the PM is constituting a coordination committee, said Sanjaya Baru, Singhs media adviser.

 Government sources did not specify what the ways of implementing the move could be. Details are being worked out, they said.

 Earlier, Singh had set up a group of ministers to consult the corporate sector and political parties on how best the plan for such job reservations could be pushed. In 2004, the UPAs common minimum programme had promised such quotas within five months of coming to power.

 But the ministers panel itself was a divided house. Social justice and empowerment minister Meira Kumar rooted for the proposal, but others either remained neutral or opposed it. 

 On November 18, 2004, Kumar wrote to 218 corporate houses about the possibility of reserving a certain percentage of jobs. Only 21 replied and nobody offered unqualified support. 

 Some industries asked for tax breaks and special concessions in lieu of the reservation. Others promised only scholarships.

 Congress sources said with Uttar Pradesh elections due early next year, UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi feels the issue ought to be revived and given the importance it deserves if the party wants to get Dalit votes. 

 However, the sources are sceptical of what the secretaries panel will achieve, given the perception that the government has not done enough spadework. At least, we can answer BSPs campaign that the Centre is not doing enough for the Dalits, they said.

 Secretaries from the ministries of social justice and empowerment, personnel and training, tribal affairs and industrial policy and promotion, are part of the committee, which will submit an interim report within a period of six months and a final one in a year.

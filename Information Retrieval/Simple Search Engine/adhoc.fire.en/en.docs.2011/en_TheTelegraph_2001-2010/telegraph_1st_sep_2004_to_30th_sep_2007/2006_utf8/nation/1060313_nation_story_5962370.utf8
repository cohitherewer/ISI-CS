 Probe into model injury

 Mumbai, March 12 (PTI): Police are probing whether Sanjana Srivastav, the model found unconscious with a bullet injury in her head, was attacked or had attempted suicide.

 Sanjana, who hails from Lucknow, was admitted to Arogya Nidhi Hospital in Juhu yesterday after being found unconscious at Joggers Park, Lokhandwala.

 We are investigating two aspects ? whether it was an attack on her life or if she made an attempt to end her life, additional commissioner of police Bipin Bihari said today.

 Judging from the injuries on her head, the model and television actor seemed to have been shot at from close range, the police official said. 

 The pellets embedded in Sanjanas skull were removed last night during an operation, but she was yet to regain consciousness, the additional commissioner added.

 Bihari said the police had summoned for questioning all those who had any contact with Sanjana in the last couple of days.

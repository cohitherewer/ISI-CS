 Upset governor speaks out

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Bhopal, June 6: Madhya Pradesh governor Balram Jakhar is losing patience over continuing attacks on the Christian community in the state, wondering why the Shivraj Singh Chauhan government was not following its raj dharma.

 In a rare stance of going public during his two-year old tenure, an upset Jakhar told The Telegraph: I have been trying to draw the attention of the state government to curb anti-social activities with (an) iron hand. So far, nothing much has happened. I hope things shape up fast.

 Jakhar said he has been regularly calling up the chief minister and speaking to the state director-general of police and the chief secretary, and writing letters, but with no results.

 I have been constantly reminding chief minister Chauhan that the state cannot and should not differentiate among its citizens. It is the job of the government to ensure that no injustice is committed anywhere. As a custodian of the Constitution, I will ensure that it happens, he said.

 the veteran Congress leader, who has been Lok Sabha Speaker and Union minister.

 Sources close to the governor said that in last few months, Jakhar has shot off six letters seeking investigation into specific cases of violence against the Christian community but in each case, the state home department either gave a clean chit to the attackers or denied that the incident had taken place.

 In less than 10 days, the Christian community has witnessed five separate attacks. Yesterday, when state minorities commission member Indira Iyenger was presenting before the media two Christian girls who were allegedly gangraped in Khargaon district, Bajrang Dal activists barged in, threatened her with dire consequences and disrupted the meet. Two days ago, hooligans attacked a church.

 On Sunday, the temple town of Ujjain witnessed ugly scenes of a religious prayer meet being disturbed. In three incidents in Jabalpur district last week, several youngsters were forcibly abducted for allegedly inciting villagers to convert. In all the cases, police avoided acting against the hooligans.

 Madhya Pradesh is among few states in which religious conversion is regulated by law.

 Church leaders like the Bhopal-based Father Anand said he failed to fathom why law enforcement agencies were not acting against radical organisations taking law in their hands. He also alleged that the government was increasingly using the police to muzzle Christians, who form less than 1 per cent of states five-crore population.

 Temple hubs turn green labs

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Bangalore, April 9: With their daily rush of visitors, the temple towns are some of Indias dirtiest and dingiest places.

 What better sites to test if a plan to clean and green the countrys cities will work?

 Puri, Vrindavan, Tirupati, Madurai and Ujjain are, therefore, among seven towns the environment and forests ministry has chosen to kick off its green cities project.

 If the experiment works, the towns will have enough water and power, fresher air, and cleaner streets and neighbourhoods. They will be quieter places dotted with gardens and parks, complete with flitting butterflies and scampering squirrels.

 Its a challenge to clean and green these towns and success stories here could lead to changes in urban planning and governance (across the country), said ministry official and project director Sanjay Kumar Srivastava.

 We are developing these smaller concentrations (but aim) to expand and apply such programmes to larger cities, where unplanned development has taken a toll on the environment.

 The two other towns among the select seven are Kottayam and Manipal, which have been chosen for just the opposite reason. These towns have already started some of the eco-friendly projects on the ministrys list, and can, therefore, be greened faster.

 The temple towns might take half a decade to show clear signs of the projects success but the ministry might be able to showcase Manipal in a couple of years.

 We found that the Manipal Academy for Higher Education, which runs several institutions in this tiny town, had already initiated a lot of green projects within the campus areas, Srivastava said. 

 This university town can be improved with minimum effort and will soon be a good example for the entire country.

 The environment and forests ministry had considered Pondicherry before settling for Manipal.

 Under the programme, the local governments will do the planning and waste management. They will recycle water, harvest rain water, recharge the water table, dispose of waste, promote and use non-conventional energy such as wind and solar power, create lung space, regulate traffic and check noise and air pollution.

 The ministry has taken up the project in partnership with GTZ-Asem, an Indo-German environment programme that will lend technical expertise.

 The Manipal academy has signed an agreement with the ministry which, GTZ-Asem director Juergen Bischoff said, would make it the first campus in the world to implement such a project.

 Manipal academy president Ramdas M. Pai said this was the first time that a corporate entity had come forward to develop an eco-city.

 The academy owns and runs 10 windmills about 20 km away and is talking to the Karnataka government for cheaper transmission of electricity to the campus.

 Once that is through, we will utilise non-conventional energy and reduce our power bills, Pai added.

 Retired Atal in seat watch

 POORNIMA JOSHI

 Vajpayee: Just a pause?

 New Delhi, Feb. 19: Atal Bihari Vajpayee may have announced his retirement but signals from the BJP suggest the party veteran has not really called it quits.

 Party sources said the former Prime Minister has been taking a keen interest in the redrawing of constituency boundaries by the delimitation commission.

 He has reportedly asked his poll managers in Lucknow to keep an eye on the delimitation process in his parliamentary constituency. His interest has led to speculation that he might be planning to contest the next Lok Sabha poll.

 We asked him why he was so interested after having announced his retirement. We were treated to one of his meaningful pauses. The kind of interest he is showing can only mean he has not given up the idea of contesting elections again, a party source said.

 That Vajpayee has not fully retired is also proved by Rajnath Singhs appointment as party chief. While L.K. Advani had made his partiality for M. Venkaiah Naidu clear, the RSS waited for Vajpayee to endorse Rajnath.

 Who finally cleared Rajnaths name? Everyone knows it was Vajpayeeji, the source said.

 Another clear sign that Vajpayee is still active is the BJPs consistent refusal to ratify Advanis claim to be the next Prime Minister candidate.

 Advani, while announcing his resignation as party president, had emphasised that he was not retiring from active politics. He later told an interviewer that conventionally, the leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha is the partys Prime Minister candidate.

 But the BJP has refused to accept Advanis argument. Rajnath had said: The elections are too far away. We have not thought over the issue yet.

 The realisation that Vajpayee has no plans to bow out of active politics anytime soon has made everyone in the party cautious about making any public statement about the next Prime Minister.

 Remember what happened to Venkaiah Naidu when he spoke of the lauh purush and vikas purush (thus placing Advani and Vajpayee on the same level)? One statement from Vajpayeeji about Advani leading the party in the next election was enough to send Naidu scurrying for cover, the source said.

 And all of us know who led the party in the 2004 general election. The BJP would continue to believe Vajpayeeji is still our Prime Minister candidate till the time he himself makes it amply clear that he isnt interested, he added.

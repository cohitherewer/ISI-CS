 Gujarat ticked off on Godhra cases

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New 

 Delhi, Nov. 22: Gujarat today sought dismissal 

 of an NHRC petition seeking transfer of 17 post-Godhra riot 

 cases outside the state.

 In an application before the apex court, Gujarat contended no third party should be allowed to interfere in criminal cases via a PIL. 

 Appearing for the state, counsel K.T.S Tulsi said the apex court had ruled in a PIL against Lalu Prasad that once a charge-sheet was filed the process of monitoring by this court had to end.

 But the court refused to compare the two cases. Dont compare other cases with the Gujarat riot cases. These are peculiar cases.

 The court explained that it would have to consider that procedures under CrPC had been overlooked in the cases, post-mortem had not been done and doctors had given false evidence.

 Tulsi said the trial court could handle these matters if an application was filed. But the court said it would have to ensure the criminal justice system was not derailed.

 The court then fixed February 20 for the next hearing.

 Of the 17 cases sought to be transferred, 13 were filed by the NHRC and four by an NGO.

 The NHRC cases pertain to massacres in Godhra, Sardarpura, Gulbarg Housing Society of Meghaninagar, Naroda Patiya, Naroda Goan and Ode.

 Citizens for Justice and Peace filed nearly 65 affidavits by victims and witnesses to back its allegations.

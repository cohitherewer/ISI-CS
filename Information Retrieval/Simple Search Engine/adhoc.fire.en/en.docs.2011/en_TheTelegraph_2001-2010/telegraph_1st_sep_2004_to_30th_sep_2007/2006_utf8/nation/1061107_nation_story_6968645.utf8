 India inches up honesty ladder

 New Delhi (PTI): Corruption in India 

 was less this year than a year ago, which helped the country 

 earn a better ranking in the corruption perception index 

 released by Transparency International on Monday.

 With a of 3.3 out of 10, India moved up to 70th position from 88 last year. 

 Finland emerged as the least corrupt nation with an overwhelming score of 9.6, while Haiti was at the bottom of the index (163rd) with a score of 1.8.

 Pakistan is ranked at 142 with a score of 2.2 and the US holds the 20th position with a score of 7.3.

 The marginal improvement in India has been brought about by the untiring efforts of the civil society organisations, and the right to information act, which came into effect on October 12, 2005, is a big step toward countering corruption, said a release by Transparency International India.

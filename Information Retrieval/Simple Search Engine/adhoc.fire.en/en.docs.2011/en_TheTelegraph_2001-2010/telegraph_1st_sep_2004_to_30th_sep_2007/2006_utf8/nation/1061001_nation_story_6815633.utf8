 Raid relief to Delhi traders

 This has been done to prevent undue trouble to the traders, Delhi minister of finance and planning A.K. Walia said on Saturday. Instructions in this connection have been issued to the department of trade and taxes, he added.

 We have also asked the department of VAT to issue instructions to its field staff to be soft and courteous to traders, he said, adding, inspectors will not visit any shop and not conduct any raid without the prior permission of the commissioner.

 Walia also requested the traders to issue receipts for each and every transaction to maintain mutual trust between the department and sellers.

 Raj company on defaulter list

 A warehouse owned by the erstwhile East India Company in Danpur on the outskirts of this town continued to be on the list of the local power distribution company, Cesu, and was marked a chronic defaulter.

 It is one of the few structures which was electrified by the Britishers much before others enjoyed the luxury of electricity, N.K. Mishra, sub-divisional officer (commerce) of Cesu, said. The company was surprised to find the warehouses name in the official list. But a spot verification failed to locate it, he said.

 The name of the warehouse, with Rs 68,902 as arrears against its name, was deleted from the consumer list after the inspection.

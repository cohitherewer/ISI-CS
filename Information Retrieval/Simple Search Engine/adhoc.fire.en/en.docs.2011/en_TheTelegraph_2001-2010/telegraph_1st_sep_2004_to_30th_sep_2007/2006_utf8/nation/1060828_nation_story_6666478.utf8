 Kalpakkam (Tamil Nadu), Aug. 27: The fast breeder test reactor at the Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research has come up for a safety and life extension review.

 The Atomic Energy Regulatory Board has asked reactor authorities to do a seismic re-evaluation to check if it can withstand the latest quake-resistant norms, research centre officials said.

 The review order comes even as the department of atomic energy has sanctioned Rs 20 crore to refurbish some systems and replace aged components in the reactor, the precursor to the second generation fast breeder reactors.

 P.V. Ramalingam, director, reactor, operations and maintenance group, said the review had been necessitated in view of the re-classification of seismic zones in Tamil Nadu after 1969 the reactor was designed in that year and in the post-tsunami context.

 Preliminary assessment of the reactors safety shows it can be operated safely for another 15 years, he said. The atomic energy board will give the final go-ahead for the life-extension programme.

 Simultaneously, reactor authorities have taken up the refurbishment project sanctioned by the atomic energy department, which includes replacing computer systems that have outlived their utility.

 Already, we have replaced one of the key computer system for the test reactor, Ramalingam said.

 The new computer systems will be identical to the system to be put in place in the upcoming 500 MW prototype fast breeder reactor, he added.

 Authorities will also be doing several experiments and tests of systems like neutron detectors that will be of relevance to the prototype reactor project, Ramalingam said.

 These experiments will be spread over two years. We have prioritised them depending on the prototype reactor project schedule, he said. The next generation fuel for subsequent fast breeder reactors will also be tested.

 Another smaller reactor at the Indira Gandhi centre named Kamini, which analyses spent fuel and also acts as a neutron source, has the Indian Space Research Organisation as its main customer, Ramalingam said.

 The effectiveness of pyrodevices (which enable or disable functions in a rocket) is checked for in the Kamini reactor, he explained.

 Tsunami watchdog

 The tsunami warning system for the Kalpakkam complex and adjacent villages is in place and was activated before the recent Indonesian tsunami, Indira Gandhi centre officials said.

 The system is split into two detection and warning.

 The detection system is a round-the-clock mechanism through which scientists constantly monitor global sites for earthquakes/under-sea quakes. It is so designed that once an under-sea quake of over 7.5 magnitude on the Richter scale is detected, an alarm system is triggered off.

 Once the warning and related inputs are received, the Kalpakkam management can decide if a tsunami alert should be sent out immediately.

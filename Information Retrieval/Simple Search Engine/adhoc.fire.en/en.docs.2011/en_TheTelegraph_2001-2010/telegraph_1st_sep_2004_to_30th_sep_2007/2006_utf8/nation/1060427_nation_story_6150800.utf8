 N-pledge to Pak

 IMTIAZ GUL

 Islamabad, April 26: India today told Pakistan that it would not be the first to use nuclear weapons after the two sides failed to finalise a draft agreement on reducing the risk of accidental use of nuclear arms.

 The assurance came as officials of the countries concluded two days of talks on nuclear confidence-building measures in Islamabad. The talks are the first to be held since the India-US nuclear deal.

 Indian additional foreign secretary K.C. Singh and his Pakistan counterpart Tariq Osman Hyder led the delegations during the talks.

 Singh said Delhi does not approach its relationship with Islamabad from a negative perspective. 

 We want to approach this relationship with positive parameters of engagement and friendship, he said, adding that Indias security policy was not Pakistan-centric.

 Ours is a large country, whose concerns are wider than those of Pakistan.

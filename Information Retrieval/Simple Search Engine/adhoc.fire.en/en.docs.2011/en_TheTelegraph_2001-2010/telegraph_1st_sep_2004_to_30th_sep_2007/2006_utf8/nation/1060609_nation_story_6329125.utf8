The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Party, govt in unity show

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 New Delhi, June 8: A day after the Prime Minister made it clear there would be no rollback of the oil price rise, the government and the Congress were eager to dispel the perception of a communication gap and possibly misunderstanding between Manmohan Singh and Sonia Gandhi.

 Distancing the Congress president from the developments that followed the cabinets decision to raise prices, the party stressed there was perfect understanding between the two. 

 If a contrary impression was given, it was because petroleum minister Murli Deora and the partys spokespersons botched up what was to be a skillfully-choreographed exercise in which the Congress would convey the concerns of the aam aadmi to the government without going over the top, sources said. 

 The sources dismissed the suggestion that the government had snubbed the party, insisting there was no battle for supremacy. 

 Sonia and her political aides had been informed of the quantum of increase, senior party functionaries said. They were given a realistic picture of how if the government were to go by the upward price trends in the international market and the escalating tension in West Asia, petrol prices would go up by Rs 10 a litre. The figure of Rs 4 was the best possible in the circumstances, it was stressed.

 Deora met the Congress president a day after the hike on his own and was not summoned by her, the sources clarified. 

 His statement that the high command would have the last word did not go down well with either Sonia or the Prime Minister because it gave the impression that she was out to undo a cabinet decision and reinforced the BJPs charge that the Congress president was a super PM. The minister was directed by Singh to amend his statement and say there would be no rollback. 

 The most charitable explanation for Deoras flip-flop was that he is not adept at handling the media, having been a backroom boy for much of his political career, the sources said. 

 As for the spokespersons, Abhishek Singhvi and Rajeev Shukla, who pushed the party on a warpath, they were perhaps being more loyal than the situation demanded. 

 They should understand the limitations in which the party works. The Congress leads the government and cannot afford to declare war against the Prime Minister like the Left and perhaps other UPA allies, the sources said.

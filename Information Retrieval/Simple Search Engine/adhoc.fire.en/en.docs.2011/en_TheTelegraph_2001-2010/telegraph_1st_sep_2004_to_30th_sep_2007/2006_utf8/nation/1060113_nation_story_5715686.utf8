 PM pushes subsidy shift

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 12: The Congress will direct its workers from the pulpit of the Hyderabad plenary to act as watchdogs in Opposition-ruled states and see to it that the social sector and pro-poor programmes launched by the UPA government are implemented in letter and spirit.

 In the run-up to the session, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh tried to put in perspective the food subsidy cut, which has been put on hold after opposition from the Congress as well the allies.

 Our past policies of offering a range of subsidies have benefited only a few. In fact, it has benefited largely the well-off sections of agrarian society. If we really want to help the poor, we must shift the emphasis away from subsidies to encouraging new investment and extending social security, he told a meeting here.

 We need new ways of thinking about old problems, Singh added.

 Party sources said the plenary is expected to showcase the National Rural Employment Guarantee Programme and the tribal rights bill as manifestations of the governments commitment to the common minimum programme. 

 The delegates will be told to ensure that the employment programme, which entails an outlay of Rs 50,000 crore, is properly implemented in the Naxalite-affected areas. 

 Sources said under the cover of empowering the unempowered, money may pass into the wrong hands in an atmosphere of terror. Workers from these states will be asked to act like watchdogs.

 The sources said the perception in the party is that though the government has done exemplary work, the Congress has not been able to extract fill political mileage.

 The credit seems to be going to our Left allies. We are getting the flak for the supposed anti-poor schemes as the BJP is constantly making fun of our aam admi slogan. This impression has to go, a source said.

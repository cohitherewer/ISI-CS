 Tiger shadow over Tamil refugee rush

 Sri Lankan refugees arrive in Rameshwaram

 Chennai, June 29: A refugee exodus from Sri Lanka in the early 1990s had helped the LTTE infiltrate into Tamil Nadu in the run-up to Rajiv Gandhis assassination.

 Fears of a fresh sneak-in are now causing alarm in and around Rameshwaram, where a steady stream of Tamil refugees, fleeing the war clouds in northern Lanka, have been landing for the past few months.

 Unofficial reports say that some of the younger arrivals have been trained in self-defence ? including the use of firearms ? at Tamil Tiger camps.

 Officials deny this but sources said 11 men with suspected Tiger links have been shifted from the main refugee camp of Mandapam to a special camp in Chengalpattu.

 A senior police officer in Ramanathapuram, the district headquarters, said he hadnt heard of any refugee who had undergone Tiger training.

 He said four agencies ? including the Intelligence Bureau and state polices special branch ? were carrying out a thorough check on every new arrival.

 With the clashes between the Tigers and Lankan forces continuing, the number of refugees fleeing to India has risen in the past 10 days. People are arriving from all parts of Tamil-speaking northern Lanka, including Mannar, Trincomalee and Vavuniya, officials at the Mandapam camp said.

 Over 50 arrived early this morning. They included 15 women, 18 men, six boys and 14 girls. Altogether 3,278 Lankan Tamil refugees have landed in India since January.

 Once the Lankan Tamil-owned boats drop the refugees off at one of the islets near the Rameshwaram coast, local fishermen or sailors from the navy or Coast Guard who spot them inform any of the seven coastal police stations.

 The police bring them in for a preliminary investigation and luggage check. Each family is photographed, handed serial numbers and, after the first search for explosives or smuggled goods, packed off to Mandapam.

 A month of quarantine follows, allowing a thorough check into each refugees antecedents, especially for Tiger connections. Once cleared, they are officially admitted into the camp, allotted a house ? one for a family of six ? handed a set of cooking utensils and issued ration cards. There is a school and a hospital in the camp, which is barred to the local population.

 Many state political parties sympathetic to the Tigers demand for a Tamil homeland carved out of Lanka have urged Delhi not to provide military assistance to Colombo. They fear it might be used against Lankas civilian Tamils.

 These parties include United Progressive Alliance-constituent Pattali Makkal Katchi, the Dalit Panthers of India and the Dravidar Kazhagam headed by K. Veeramani.

 Their request came after reports that India had supplied two radars to Lanka.

 Aamir, Gopichand: What 

 youths want 

New Delhi, Nov. 18: Delhi University history student Kanika Kishore wants Aamir Khan and Smriti Irani to take a lesson from Pullela Gopichand, former winner of the All-England Badminton Championship.

 In the months after the win, the badminton player had declined offers to serve as brand ambassador when soft drink manufacturers approached him with requests to endorse their products.

 As Gopichand explained his stand to teenagers from 34 countries at a conference in Agra today, delegates hammered out a charter for a global campaign called Youth For Health (YFH) scheduled for launch tomorrow.

 The YFH movement will urge governments to enforce anti-tobacco laws and regulate the sale of unhealthy foods. It will also call on celebrities to stop promoting unhealthy products from soft drinks to potato chips.

 We want sportspersons and stars to spread the right messages to the public, said Kishore, a delegate from the New Delhi-based Students Health Action Network (SHAN).

 Some conference delegates said they were impressed that Gopichand could have used the offers from soft drinks companies to bolster the status of his sport but didnt.

 If he could stand by his values, why cant other celebrities do the same thing sacrifice just a little, said Rahul Bajaj, a student at the College of Business Studies in New Delhi.

 We want celebrities to join youth in spreading good health messages, said 15-year-old Palkesh Asawa from Choithram International School in Indore. In one conference session, a student said the government should be asked to set aside funds to be paid to superstars to promote healthy products. 

 Fresh fruit juice instead of a soft drink, said Asawa.

 Senior medical delegates said the potential for YFH should not be underestimated. 

 Young people can emerge strong advocates for change in behaviour as well as policies at local levels in schools or even in homes, said Dr K.S. Reddy, a cardiologist and president of the Public Health Foundation of India.

 SHAN has shown that anti-tobacco messages can reduce the proportion of school students who experiment with tobacco. Our experience shows that health messages can decrease the intention to use tobacco and reduce the proportion of first-time users, said Monika Arora, SHAN director.

 The YFH movement is aimed at creating a network of youth across the world to campaign in favour of behaviour change and health friendly policies. The YFH charter, scheduled to be released in Delhi tomorrow, calls on youths to adopt good health behaviour and advocate social policies that support such behaviour.

 Kar sevaks demolishing the mosque in 1992

 New Delhi, Aug. 18: Nearly 14 years after it was constituted, the Liberhan Commission might be close to submitting its report on the demolition of the Babri mosque in Ayodhya. 

 Home minister Shivraj Patil indicated in Parliament today that the government had learnt from the commission that it might not need another extension of its term.

 Informally, we are told that the report would be given by December 31, 2006, the minister told the Lok Sabha after some members raised the issue during zero hour.

 The commission headed by retired Justice M.S. Liberhan was set up within days of the demolition of the disputed Babri mosque on December 6, 1992.

 The panel was to submit the report within months but its probe dragged on. Over the years, its term has been extended, usually in instalments of three and six months.

 The latest was a six-month extension which ends on December 31, 2006.

 When MPs protested that even December 31 was too far, Patil said the report could be submitted before that date.

 Members like Mohammad Salim (CPM) and Devendra Prasad Yadav (Rashtriya Janata Dal) wanted the government to act tough. 

 Patil dismissed the suggestion that the commission should be wound up. 

He said no action should be taken that could lead 

to the report not coming out at all when the commission was on the verge 

of submitting it.

 Flu fear sets up job flight to India

 DAVID HARRISON, CATHERINE HUMBLE AND ADAM STONES

 London, Jan. 15: Thousands of employees will be told to work from home if Britain is hit by a bird flu pandemic.

 Many more jobs could go abroad as big companies seek to minimise the potentially devastating impact of the virus that has already travelled from the Far East to Turkey, on the doorstep of Europe.

 Up to 25 per cent of the population is expected to be infected by the virus if ? as scientists predict ? it arrives in Britain in a form that can be passed from human to human, according to the World Health Organisation.

 Companies are drawing up emergency plans to reduce or cope with the loss of one in four workers. 

 An expert warned that some could see their entire staff wiped out by the virus.

 Vodafone, Norwich Union and accountancy firms PricewaterhouseCoopers and KPMG say they would make arrangements for staff to work from home. Some workplace meetings would be replaced by video conference calls.

 A senior executive for Vodafone, which employs more than 13,000 in Britain, said: Bird flu is a real threat and we are taking it seriously. Working from home means that people will be at less risk from getting the virus and could play a crucial role in keeping our business going.

 David Way, a national disaster adviser with the insurers Alexander Forbes, said up to 70 per cent of staff already had the facilities to work away from the office.

 Some large international companies will move operations and key staff abroad. Norwich Union plans to transfer claims calls to centres in India and Sri Lanka.

 KPMG is strongly advising businesses to prepare to move some operations to countries where the virus has not struck. HSBC has said it is planning for staff losses as high as 50 per cent but in some places I think it could be nearer 100 per cent, a KPMG spokesman said.

 Even firms expecting a 25 per cent sickness toll ? including British Airways, Boots, BP and Vodafone ? say the real figure will be increased by staff who stay at home to look after relatives stricken by the virus.

 Evidence from the Far East suggests that half of those infected so far have died. In Britain, the chief medical officer has put the figure for possible deaths at between 50,000 and 750,000, if the disease spreads between people.

 Last week, WHO warned that the arrival of bird flu in Britain was inevitable and possibly imminent.

 The Sunday Telegraph surveyed dozens of large UK companies and found that over 80 per cent had made emergency plans ? including Asda, Tesco, Royal Mail, O2, Natwest and Ford. 

 Most firms said they were basing preparations on projections that 25 per cent of the population could be infected by the virus.

 A 25 per cent loss of staff would cut Britains 28.8 million working population by 7.2 million ? with devastating consequences for the economy. If we dont prepare properly then the country could be plunged into an economic crisis, an analyst said.

 Scientists say it is only a matter of time before the H5N1 strain mutates into a form that can spread from person to person.

 Companies are also trying to buy up Tamiflu, the anti-viral vaccine drug, which could reduce the symptoms of bird flu ? although it would not be a cure.

 Bupa, the private health company, said 30 per cent of the firms it insured had asked for stocks of Tamiflu for their staff but it had so far been unable to satisfy demand. Many clients had also asked to be supplied with face masks.

 Dr Andrew Vallance-Owen, a spokesman for Bupa, said: There is a feeling that the virus is about to change its form. We must be ready to meet the challenge.

 Employers are being urged to raise hygiene standards.

 John Lewis is planning to introduce alcohol-based handwashes for staff and customers inside their stores and anti-viral mats at the entrances.

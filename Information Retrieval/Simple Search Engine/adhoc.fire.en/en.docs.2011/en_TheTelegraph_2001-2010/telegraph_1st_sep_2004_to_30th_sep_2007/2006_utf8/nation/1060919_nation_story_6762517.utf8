 PM pitch for Tharoor

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Tharoor

 On board the Prime Ministers special aircraft, Sept. 18: Manmohan Singh thinks Shashi Tharoor is an outstanding candidate for the post of the next UN secretary-general. 

 What is more, he sees Tharoors candidature as Indias first attempt to assume its role in the management of international polity. He, however, realised that it is not going to materialise in one day. 

 He said he had raised the issue of Tharoors candidature wherever he got an opportunity. And, contrary to what some people have been writing, he is running very strong. 

 He recognised, though, that there were difficulties but was hopeful that Tharoor would give a good account of himself.

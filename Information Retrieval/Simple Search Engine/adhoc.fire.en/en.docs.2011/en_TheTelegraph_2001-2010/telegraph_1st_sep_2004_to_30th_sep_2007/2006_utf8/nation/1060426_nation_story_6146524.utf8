 Ranchi, April 25: T.K.A. Nair, the principal secretary to the Prime Minister, returned today after an overnight reconnaissance tour of Naxalite-affected Latehar. 

 But he refused to comment on his findings on Jharkhand. I am not here to disclose my assessments on Jharkhand. I have told everything to the chief minister. You better talk to him. He might give you all the details, he said, after spending the night at the hill resort of Netarhat.

 Nair, who was leading a team of five senior officials from the PMO, met the residents of many villages in Latehar and heard out their grievances. Though not fluent in Hindi, the Punjab cadre IAS official communicated with the masses well.

 The team reached the hill resort of Netarhat last evening and drove straight to the Dhodhikona village of Asurs. They were welcomed in traditional style by the villagers who offered pidhas (wooden stools) and chatais (mats). The team spent about 45 minutes hearing out the villagers.

 From there, the team was scheduled to see the famous sunset from Magnolia Point at Netarhat, but the sun had already set by the time they reached. After spending about half-an-hour talking to villagers, Nair and his team drove to Netarhat School.

 Another half-an-hour later, they headed for a meeting with deputy commissioners and superintendents of five districts. 

 The team took two helicopters to Garu, where the state police and CRPF gave a joint presentation. Then the officials visited an interior village to see a primary school run by a committee of mothers. 

 From Garu, the team took a 15-minute helicopter ride to Chandwa block where it inspected a fisheries project being run by Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribes youths. The team flew back to Ranchi after visiting Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalaya in Chandwa.

 Sisters raped and murdered

 Hyderabad: Two teen sisters who worked as child labourers in a cotton field in Andhra Pradesh have been gangraped and murdered, police said.

 Yasoda, 15, and Shyamala, 13, were working as pickers in a farm at Pampali village in Kurnool district.

 They lived with their brother and younger sister in sheds built for the labourers by contractors.

 According to police, the sisters had gone to answer natures call late on Friday night when they were kidnapped by miscreants, gangraped and later murdered.

 A search by other labourers did not yield any trace of them. Their bodies were later found in a nearby stream.

 District superintendent of police Malla Reddy who visited the spot along with the district collector found the living conditions of the labourers pitiable and miserable.

 Suspect in Jagat house

 Jaipur (PTI): Rajasthan police chief 

 A.S. Gill said on Sunday a decision to take action against 

 Natwar Singhs son Jagat will be made after ascertaining 

 if he was aware a man arrested from his official residence 

 was a murder accused.

 We will decide on registering a case against Jagat Singh after examining the case. Not knowing the law is no excuse but not knowing the criminal record of some one is another aspect. That is to be substantiated by evidence and needs further investigation, Gill said.

 A man called Mehram Chaudhury was arrested from the official residence of Jagat on Friday for allegedly murdering one Babu Lal Gurjar in February. Jagat, present when the arrest was made, had alleged the move was part of a political conspiracy against him.

 Chaudhury is in police remand for five days.

 Indian key to Canada crown

 Toronto, Jan. 21: As Canadians prepare to go to polling stations in a rare winter election on Monday, there are few certainties: one of these is that whichever party comes to power, there will be at least one cabinet minister of Indian origin in the next government.

 Six Canadian politicians, who are of Punjabi parentage, could, in fact, determine who rules the worlds second largest country after Mondays election.

 These six India-born MPs in the outgoing parliament belonged to the ruling Liberal Party and are seeking re-election. The outgoing Liberal Party government did not have a majority in the last parliament and barely survived on the support of the New Democratic Party (NDP), which supported Prime Minister Paul Martin from outside.

 If the outcome of Mondays polls is similar to the last one, Martin will need the support of every one of his Indo-Canadian MPs: even if one of them loses the election, his prime ministership can be in jeopardy. 

 Already, a seventh Liberal MP, Gurmant Grewal of British Columbia, has opted not to seek re-election, implicated in a tape exposing his role in a scandal.

 In all, there were 10 MPs in the last parliament who could trace their origin to India: seven Punjabis, all first-generation migrants to Canada, and three others who have Indian blood but consider East Africa as their original home.

 Forty-four South Asians are in the fray in Mondays election and they are scattered all over the political spectrum. 

 The Conservatives have fielded the largest number of South Asians, a total of 13 candidates.

 Close behind are the Liberals with 11 nominees, and the NDP with eight brown faces. The Green Party has roped in four South Asians to fight the polls on their ticket while the Communists and the Progressive Canadian Party have two each. Three South Asians are fighting as Independents and the Canadian Action Party has one nominee.

 Already, Punjabi is the third most important language in the Canadian parliament after the two official languages of English and French and no visible minority has been as successful as Indo-Canadians in this countrys politics.

 Elections Canada, the equivalent of Indias Election Commission, has produced voter information guides and other poll-related information in Bengali, Gujarati, Hindi, Tamil, Urdu and, of course, Punjabi for Mondays voting exercise.

 Elections Canada has spent three quarters of a million in Canadian dollars so far in advertising directed at ethnic voters, who may not have access to the mainstream media here or have no comprehension of what is aired or printed in English and French.

 Ahead of the voting, polling officers have been assigned in each constituency to reflect its ethnic composition: in Toronto constituencies which are overwhelmingly Punjabi, polling officers will also be predominantly Punjabi-speaking.

 In addition, if voters contact returning officers in advance, they will make doubly sure that specific interpretation services are made available to voters at polling stations.

 Besides, voters may bring along a relative or a friend to interpret for them and those seeking information at Elections Canadas toll-free phone number can request live interpretation in whatever language they speak. 

 Since November last year, when it became clear that a mid-term election was round the corner, Elections Canadas ethnocultural community relations officers have been pressed into work with South Asians and other minorities to get them to vote.

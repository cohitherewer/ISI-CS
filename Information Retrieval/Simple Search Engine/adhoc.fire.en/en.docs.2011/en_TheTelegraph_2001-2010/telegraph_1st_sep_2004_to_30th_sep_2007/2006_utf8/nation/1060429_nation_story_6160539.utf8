The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Opal off shelves

 The episode also raises the question whether the publishing industry can turn literary wannabes into successful authors through marketing hype and packaging.

 Viswanathan worked not only with her publisher but also with Alloy Entertainment ? known as a book packager ? in developing the concept for the novel and its first four chapters. She has said Alloy was not responsible for any of the copying.

 In many instances, editors at Alloy craft proposals for publishers and create plots and characters before handing them over to a writer (or a string of them). Alloy owns or shares the copyright with the authors and then divides the advances and any royalties with them.

 In a way, its kind of like working on a television show, said Cindy Eagan, editorial director at Little, Brown Books for Young Readers, a sister imprint of Viswanathans publisher. We all work together in shaping each novel.

 In an interview on Wednesday, Viswanathan said that after an initial meeting with the book packager, They asked about my life, who I was?. Basically, it was like, Send us an email writing about yourself that seems most natural.

 Viswanathan said she wrote about not having a boyfriend, about the pressure her friends were feeling to get into good colleges and about being an Indian-American girl. They liked that.

 Alloy then worked with her on the books first four chapters, making what Viswanathan described as very minor suggestions.

 But the publishing contract Little, Brown signed is actually with Alloy, which holds the copyright to Opal together with Viswanathan.

 The relationships between Alloy and the publishers are so intertwined that the same editor, Claudia Gabel, is thanked on the acknowledgments pages of both McCaffertys books and Viswanathans Opal.

 Gabel had been an editorial assistant at Crown Publishing Group, then moved to Alloy, where she helped develop the idea for Viswanathans book. She recently left Alloy.

 A spokesman for Random House, the publishing company that owns Crown, said Gabel had left the company before the editorial work was completed on Viswanathans book.

 The plagiarism row broke out last Sunday when Harvard Crimson reported that Viswanathan had plagiarised nearly 40 passages from McCaffertys books.

 Little, Brown and Viswanathan had earlier said she would revise the book to remove the copied passages and that they would reissue it. Viswanathan, reached last night, declined to comment.

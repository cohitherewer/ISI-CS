 New Delhi, Oct. 6: Delhi High Court today upbraided the central and state governments for their failure to prevent the outbreak of dengue despite funds allocated for a slew of public health sanitation measures a decade ago.

 A division bench of acting Chief Justice Vijender Jain and Justice Kailash Gambhir directed the governments and civic agencies to file within a week the reason for their failure to implement the courts 1996 order on dengue and other diseases.

 The court had given directions in 1996 and you have not taken any step so far. This is a shocking state of affairs, the bench observed. If 3,000 reported cases and 40 deaths cannot ring the alarm bell, considering the population in the city, a day is not far that people, who suffer from dengue today, will suffer from chikungunya tomorrow and some other unknown diseases day after tomorrow.

 While the Delhi government is drawing flak for the dengue outbreak, it has sent show-cause notices to 13 schools, including Modern School in Vasant Vihar and a Don Bosco school, for allowing mosquitoes to breed.

 Scientists from the National Vector-Borne Disease Control Programme had detected a peak in the density of Aedes aegypti larvae in July this year, portending an outbreak of dengue. There was extensive fumigation done, but many places were clearly left out, said a health official.

 While inspectors had visited apartment blocks and community centres across the city over the past two months, looking for mosquitoes breeding, the outbreak shows they missed many such sites, the official said.

 The court today asked why a drain adjacent to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) was not covered despite the fact that Rs 21 crore had been sanctioned for the work.

 As no step has been taken to cover the drain, mosquitoes breeding in the drain have caused the death of a young doctor, which is unfortunate, the court said, directing the Municipal Corporation of Delhi to take adequate steps.

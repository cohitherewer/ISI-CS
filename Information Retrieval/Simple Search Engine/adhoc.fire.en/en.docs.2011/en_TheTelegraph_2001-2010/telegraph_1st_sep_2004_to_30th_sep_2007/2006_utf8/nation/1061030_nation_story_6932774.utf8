 Sonia to pluck gender thorns

 Chakur, Oct. 29 (PTI): Admitting that there was opposition to the womens reservation bill from some colleagues in the Congress and other constituents of the UPA, Sonia Gandhi today said she would make efforts to convince those against the measure.

 I have to convince (Union ministers) Lalu (Prasad), (Dayanidhi) Maran and (Anbumani) Ramadoss. I have to convince some colleagues from our party, the Congress chief told party workers at Chakur, the native place of Union home minister Shivraj Patil, in Maharashtra this afternoon.

 Sonia hinted that the passage of the bill in Parliament would be an uphill task, saying she has to convince several people from within and outside the Congress on it.

 She credited her late husband, former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, with ushering in reservations for women in panchayat bodies.

 Referring to remarks made earlier by Rajni Patil, chairperson of the Central Social Welfare Board, on reservation for women, Sonia said: I am also trying my best (for the passage of the bill).

 Stating that grassroots workers are the real strength of the Congress, Sonia, in a two-minute address, asked them to work with determination and dedication so that the party could face the challenges ahead.

 She spent the better part of an hour listening to grievances of party workers and office-bearers from Maharashtra, especially those from the Marathwada region.

 MLA Kalyan Kale told her that the Centre should offer better support prices to farmers and increase import duty on cotton so that domestic growers get remunerative prices.

 Later, addressing a farmers rally at Chakur, Sonia said agriculture was the backbone of the country. Without agriculture development, there cannot be development of the country, she said.

 Natwar outburst

 Former foreign minister Natwar Singh today said Sonia was behind his recent problems with the Enforcement Directorate in the Iraqi oil-for-food scam and attacked her foreign origins. 

 Everything that the government did against me was on Sonias direction. I will not blame Manmohan Singh, he told STAR News.

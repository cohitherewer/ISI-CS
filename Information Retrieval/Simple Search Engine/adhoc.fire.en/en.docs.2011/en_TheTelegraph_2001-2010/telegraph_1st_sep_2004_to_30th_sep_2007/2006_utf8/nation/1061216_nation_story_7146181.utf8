 New Delhi, Dec. 15: A section of doctors from the AIIMS, who are on a hunger strike against the quota bill since yesterday, threatened to step up their agitation.

 We have decided to intensify our hunger strike. The number of doctors on hunger strike has gone up to 20 today. More doctors are expected to join it tomorrow. We will continue to build up our agitation till the government heeds our demand. If it chooses not to, then we will ensure that the agitation snowballs into a major storm like it did in May, said Anil Sharma, spokesperson of the AIIMS Resident Doctors Association.

 The bill to reserve 27 per cent seats in higher education for the OBCs was passed by the Lok Sabha yesterday.

 Sharma said there would be no disruption in the functioning of AIIMS because of the hunger strike, as that would affect patients and earn doctors a bad name.

 AIIMS spokesperson B.K. Dash dismissed the protest. You can draw your own inference from it, he said. 

 Although RDA is the biggest doctors 

 association in AIIMS, its general body meeting today lacked 

 in strength. A doctor who was present at the meeting said 

 only about 50 doctors attended.

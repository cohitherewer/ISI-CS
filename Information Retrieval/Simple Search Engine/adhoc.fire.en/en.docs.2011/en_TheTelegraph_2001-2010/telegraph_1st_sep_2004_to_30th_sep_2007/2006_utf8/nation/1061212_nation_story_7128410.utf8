 Nudge to nuke group

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 11: The passage of the Indo-US nuclear cooperation initiative in the US Congress will influence a large number of Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) members who are yet to come out in support of the deal, officials have said.

 The 45-member NSG is required to alter its guidelines to enable full nuclear energy cooperation with India. But officials said only a handful of countries have so far openly endorsed the Indo-US deal. The NSG needs to evolve a consensus to open up civilian nuclear trade with India.

 Most NSG members belong to the European Union (EU). As a bloc, the EU is yet to take a stand. Only three countries UK, France and Russia have strongly endorsed the deal.

 The officials said India had made a presentation to the NSG consultative group in Vienna in October and gauged the mood among the members. After the meeting, a group of countries led by Norway, concerned over the non-proliferation issue, had raised some questions and sought clarifications.

 India and the US have launched independent efforts to convince the NSG members to evolve a consensus on the issue.

 The officials hoped that several countries were looking to the US Congress to pass the bill. The strong endorsement in Congress, reflected in the bipartisan support for the legislation, would have a positive impact on the fate of the deal in the NSG, they said.

 Though Delhi has not asked the NSG members to spell out their position, as it felt the time had not yet come for such a move, there is apprehension that some countries might be difficult to take on board.

 One of the biggest challenges will be to convince China. India and the US have been working separately on China and both hope it will not be an obstacle. India had taken up the issue during Chinese President Hu Jintaos visit but there was no clear signal from Beijing.

 The under-secretary of state for political affairs and architect of the deal in the Bush administration, Nicholas Burns, took up the US initiative on Beijing. During his trip to Delhi last week, he told officials that the Chinese were unlikely to do anything to block the deal.

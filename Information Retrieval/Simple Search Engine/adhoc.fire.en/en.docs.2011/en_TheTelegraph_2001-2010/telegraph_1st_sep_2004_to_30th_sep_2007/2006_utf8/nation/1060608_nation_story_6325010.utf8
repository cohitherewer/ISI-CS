 Rs 10000 fine for credit card harassment

 New Delhi, June 7 (PTI): A consumer court has fined Citibank Rs 10,000 for harassing a person by sending him an unsolicited credit card and later issuing fake bills.

 Charanjit Singh, a resident of Tagore Garden, filed a petition against the bank with the District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum. 

 Acting on it, the forum said: Citibank is not following the RBI rules and regulations and the matter needs a probe. It also clarified that since it has no power to probe, this can be done by other agencies.

 On February 24, 2003, Singh received a letter from the bank containing a free credit card. He contacted the bank and refused to accept it as he was not aware of the terms and conditions.

 The bank officials tried to convince him about the various advantages of it. But Singh did not sign any document regarding the acceptance of the card nor did he fulfil any other formality.

 On November 11, 2003, the bank sent him another free credit card. Singh refused it again and made it clear to the bank that he was not interested in such free gifts.

 Despite his request to cancel the cards, the bank started sending him card bills showing first year fee, service charges and service tax.

 When Singh contacted the bank officials again, he was told that the card was not activated and the bills sent to him were the minimum compulsory charges. 

 The bank also threatened Singh that it would take legal action against him in Chennai if he did not pay.

 While approaching the forum, Singh sought compensation of Rs 4.9 lakh and produced the last bill dated April 18, 2005, of Rs 2,996 to the court.

 The court observed that the credit card had no validity and the bank was demanding fees for a non-activated card while passing an interim order to cancel all bills issued by it.

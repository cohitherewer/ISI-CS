 Talks with US on N-deal

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 19: Delhi and Washington today tried to thrash out a key element of last Julys nuclear deal that faces a severe test later in the US Congress.

 In a restricted meeting, foreign secretary Shyam Saran and US under-secretary of state Nicholas Burns discussed the separation of Delhis military and civil nuclear plants before being joined by the rest of their teams.

 India had handed over the blueprint of separation during the last round of talks; today the US gave its response.

 India submitted a long list of nuclear plants that have been placed in the civil category. Officials said that most of the countrys 11 reactors that are not covered by safeguards could be part of the civil list.

 There is some hurry over finalising the details because Washington is looking for significant gains ahead of President George Bushs visit early next month. The dates are expected to be fixed during the talks. Unconfirmed reports said Bush would be in India from March 1 to 3.

 Same rules, elbow room for foreign schools

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 India calling

 New Delhi, Nov. 29: Foreign universities that want to start operations in the country will soon have to comply with rules drawn up by the government.

 A group of ministers has cleared the controversial Foreign Universities Entry and Operation (for the maintenance of quality and prevention of commercialisation) Bill, 2006, which could be passed in the ongoing winter session of Parliament.

 The bill, which had become a bone of contention between the human resource development ministry and the commerce ministry, has been finally thrashed out after a series of meetings.

 Under the bill, foreign institutions that set up operations in India will have the status of deemed universities. An expert committee of statutory educational bodies like the University Grants Commission and the All India Council of Technical Education will be authorised to decide which foreign universities will be exempt from fee regulations and rules that govern national institutions.

 Others will have to abide by the national policies on fees and quotas for students from the scheduled castes, scheduled tribes and other backward classes.

 One of the main points of conflict between the HRD and the commerce ministry was how foreign universities will be treated. The HRD ministry said if foreign universities want to set up branches in India, they will have to do so without any preferential treatment.

 But the commerce ministry said stringent regulations would prevent foreign direct investment from coming into higher education. Its argument was that prestigious universities might not want to adopt the current system of quotas which has been expanded further. It also said the presence of reputable foreign universities might stem the exodus of Indian students to other countries.

 The HRD ministry maintained that it could not allow education to be commercialised as it was not a commodity. It also insisted that one of the essential objectives of the bill was to prevent fly by night operators from setting up branches here.

 The ministry said foreign universities should not be allowed to charge exorbitant fees as that would make them inaccessible for a majority of students.

 The Left parties, which have been backing HRD minister Arjun Singhs policies on quotas and his position on FDI in higher education, are all for stringent regulations for foreign providers that want to come to India.

 We do not want FDI in higher education, CPM politburo member and Rajya Sabha MP Sitaram Yechury told reporters today.

 Sources said the Left parties are likely to discuss the foreign providers bill with the HRD minister and suggest their views.

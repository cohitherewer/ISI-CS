 Left arms for SEZ, China battles

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Karat

 New Delhi, Oct. 3: The Left Front is preparing to take up with the government tomorrow the issues of special economic zones and the denial of permission to Chinese companies that want to set up ventures in India.

 At the scheduled meeting of the coordination committee of the United Progressive Alliance and the Left, the CPM plans to submit notes to the government on both issues. The partys central committee, which met here last week, discussed the parameters within which special economic zones (SEZs) are to be set up.

 The central committee also discussed the unfair manner in which Chinese companies are being denied clearance to set up projects on the ground that they are a security threat. 

 The Centre has stalled the development of a port in Kerala because one of the Chinese companies that won the bid is also building a strategic Pakistani naval base.

 We want to know why the Chinese companies are being blacklisted in infrastructural development, CPM general secretary Prakash Karat said. We will submit a note to the government on this issue.

 On the special economic zones, the Left has an ally in Congress president Sonia Gandhi, who recently advised caution in pursuing the model. The CPM, once set against the special zones, has come around to accepting them after Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee threw his weight behind the idea.

 The Left note will spell out the amendments it wants to the SEZ act. The Congress is not likely to oppose them, especially after Sonias advice.

 The Left is also waiting for a detailed response on the note it had handed the government on its two-year performance. Karat accepted that the response would take time arriving since the note contained a thorough review of all aspects of government policies.

 The Left is temporarily satisfied on foreign policy with the Prime Ministers visit to Havana for the Non-Aligned Movement meeting. 

 Also, the conflict over the Indo-US nuclear deal has, at least for now, been defused after Manmohan Singh spelt out its terms of negotiation in Parliament, covering all the points the Left had raised.

 But a new flank of hostility with the Centre seems to be building on the issue of China.

 We do not think this government shares the opinion of George Fernandes who, during his tenure as defence minister (in the Vajpayee government), described China as enemy number one, Karat said.

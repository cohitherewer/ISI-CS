The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 11, and already a hoax caller

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 21: For over 10 days, Delhi police have been chasing bomb tip-offs that turn out to be hoax calls.

 Today, they nabbed three persons behind Wednesdays bomb threat call at AIIMS, which had led to disruption of healthcare facilities at the hospital for around six hours.

 The call was traced to the phone of Lokesh Dahal, 32, who supplies medicines to chemists shops. Dahal, arrested early this morning from his west Delhi residence, is being questioned to find if he has any links with terror outfits.

 Dahal denied making the call and said his phone was used by two 16-year-olds who live in a neighbouring house. Following his statement, the two boys were detained for questioning.

 In all likelihood, however, it was a case of boredom driving the schoolkids to sensationalism, a senior police official involved with the case told The Telegraph.

 The officials conclusion can be excused, considering the spate of recent hoax calls, most of which have been eventually traced to youths who made the false threats out of little more than boredom.

 In Madhya Pradeshs Kathi, an 11-year-old boy was arrested today after he sent an email on behalf of Lashkar-e-Haq, a name he had created. The boy was released within hours.

 Five days ago, the police had arrested an 18-year-old tailor, Shadaab, after he had made them spend a sleepless night chasing bombs that were never there. Shadaab, who was later declared just another bored kid, called thrice to claim that the Akshardham temple, Sisganj Gurdwara and the Red Fort would be blown up.

 In Bhopal, Sumit Tamrakar, 22, was arrested two days ago for an email sent to Mumbai police. He claimed to belong to the Students Islamic Movement of India and warned there would be much more devastation in soon-to-happen blasts in Bhopal. Though Sumit is still in detention, the police are sure his email was a prank.

 Mohammed Sheikh from Jogeshwari in Mumbai was arrested for making a hoax call in the aftermath of the blasts. Sheikh, 30, called a PCR van threatening more bombs would go off at Jogeshwari railway station, one of the sites where blasts occurred on July 11.

 Kalam threat arrest

 The cyber caf? from where an email containing a threat to President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam was sent has been traced to Indore and a person was arrested, reports PTI.

 Four others have been picked up in connection with the threat and are being interrogated, the police said.

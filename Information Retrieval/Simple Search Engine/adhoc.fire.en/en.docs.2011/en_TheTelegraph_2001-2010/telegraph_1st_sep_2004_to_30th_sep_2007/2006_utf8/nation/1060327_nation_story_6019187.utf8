 Maoists die in encounter

 Raipur, March 26: Security personnel today killed eight Maoists at a village in Dantewada district, about 500 km south of the capital, reports our correspondent.

 The encounter occurred in Telipenta village while the securitymen were on their way to Kotru in connection with the killing of Salwa Judum activist Budhram Telam. The 25-year-old villager was axed to death last night.

 Police got news of the murder this morning and a team led by assistant sub-inspector Hira Singh Netam went to Kotru across the Indravati river.

 As the team of 58 policemen made its way through the forests, armed Maoists attacked them from the nearby Parkeli hills.

 In the encounter that started at 9 am and went on for almost an hour, eight Maoists were killed and 12 injured. The police recovered five bodies, home minister Ramvichar Netam said, adding that the rebels had taken three bodies with them to the adjoining jungles.

 The police also found eight rifles, Maoist literature and explosives, he added.

 In Kanker district, 200 km from here, a CRPF jawan was killed and another wounded in a landmine blast triggered by Maoists this morning. 

 The incident took place near Gorbinapal village, about 200 km from here, at 10 am. Security forces were patrolling on foot when the landmine exploded, sources said.

 Sridevi case

 New Delhi, Nov. 10: The Supreme Court today dismissed a petition by a man challenging a Madras High Court order directing him to pay Rs 1 lakh for claiming to be the husband of actress Sridevi.

 The court dismissed the special leave petition by Vicharapu Ramkrishna Gowd who would now have to pay Rs 1 lakh for misusing the judicial process.

 Gowd, who claimed to have married Sridevi in March 1992, had moved a petition before the Chennai family court alleging that the actress deserted him in January 2003. The court had issued notice to her in March 2004 seeking her response to the petition seeking restitution of conjugal rights. 

 Sridevi filed a writ petition in Madras High Court seeking quashing of the proceedings before the family court. She alleged that Gowd, who was a resident of Guntur district in Andhra Pradesh, had also claimed to have married Priyanka Gandhi and Jaya Prada.

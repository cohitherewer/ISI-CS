 Mughal premiere runs into trouble

 Karachi/New Delhi, June 23 (PTI): The premiere of Mughal-e-Azam in Karachi got caught up in controversy today as government-owned Pakistan Television (PTV) pulled sponsorship and lyricist Javed Akhtar had trouble acquiring a visa.

 PTV withdrew sponsorship of the Indian film stars visit without citing reason, distributors of the movie said. 

 The premiere is to be attended by a 25-strong team from India, including Saif Ali Khan, Jackie Shroff, Sri Devi, Rishi Kapoor, Urmila Matondkar, Prem Chopra, Shabana Azmi and Akhtar.

 They are to reach Karachi by a chartered flight tomorrow morning. 

 Initial reports suggested Akhtar had been denied a visa by Pakistan, but the high commission said in Delhi he had been given permission to travel. 

 Akhtar had said in Mumbai: I learnt yesterday afternoon that out of the 25-member delegation that was to visit Karachi tomorrow for the premiere, I was the only one to have been denied a visa. I am quite surprised.

 The Indian celebrities are also scheduled to appear in a nine-hour PTV telethon to raise funds for victims of last years earthquake before attending the premiere.

 Nadeem Mandviwala, the films distributor, could not explain why PTV had scrapped sponsorship but vowed that the 1960-hit movie would be released in Karachi on schedule on June 30.

 I cannot tell you why PTV has withdrawn its sponsorship. Nevertheless, I would like to clarify here that these Indian idols were the guests of PTV who were extended invitations individually, he said.

 Sources close to Mandviwala said the trouble arose after some of the Indian stars insisted on taking their own security staff.

 Some of the Indian film stars had security reservations (in Karachi) and wanted to carry their own security staff. This request was denied, they said.

 No PTV spokesman was available for comment.

 Plea to fill expelled MPs seats

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 3: The Election Commission today moved the Supreme Court for permission to hold elections to fill Lok Sabha seats that fell vacant after the expulsion of 10 MPs in the cash-for-questions scam.

 The court, which had allowed elections to the seat vacated by a lone Rajya Sabha MP, issued notices to the other expelled parliamentarians and asked them to respond before the first week of August.

 A bench headed by Chief Justice Y.K. Sabharwal fixed the hearing after the poll panel said there was a legal obligation to fill a seat within six months of vacancy.

 With the expulsion being ordered on December 23, the vacancies were supposed to be filled by June 22. But there would be no illegality as the poll panel had approached the apex court before the summer vacations, which asked it to mention the matter after it reopened.

 On the poll panel seeking an urgent hearing, the court said it would hand over the petition challenging the expulsion before a Constitution bench only after deciding the issue of elections.

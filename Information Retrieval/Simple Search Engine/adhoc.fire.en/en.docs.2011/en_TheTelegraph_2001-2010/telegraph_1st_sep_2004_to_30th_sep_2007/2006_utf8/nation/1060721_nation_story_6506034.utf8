 Resignation over AIIMS row

 New delhi: Trapped at the centre of the 

 war of faculty factions over AIIMS director P. Venugopal, 

 faculty association president A. B. Dey today decided to 

 bail out, reports our bureau.

 Deciding he had had enough of the pressure from both sides, Dey resigned from the presidentship of the association, a body representing about 500 members of the faculty.

 Throughout the past two months of intense drama at AIIMS, Dey was seen as one of the few senior faculty members who chose not to side with either Venugopal or health minister Ambumani Ramadoss.

 A section of the faculty association, led by its secretary B.K. Khaitan, had openly expressed support for Venugopal when Ramadoss had moved to sack him.

 This section had resented a letter signed by Dey and sent to Ramadoss in March, suggesting that significant numbers of the faculty wanted Venugopal removed.

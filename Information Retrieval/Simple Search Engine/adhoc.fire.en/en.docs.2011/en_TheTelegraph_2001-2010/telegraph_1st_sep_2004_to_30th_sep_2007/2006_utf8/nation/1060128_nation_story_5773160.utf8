 Cable bill weathers TN House storm

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chennai, Jan. 27: Amid uproarious scenes and a walkout, the Tamil Nadu Assembly today adopted the bill enabling the government to take over private cable television networks in the state. 

 The DMK-led Opposition, which lacked an effective floor strategy, found itself hopelessly divided during todays debate.

 Minutes before the legislation was passed by a voice vote ? a resounding chorus of yes by members of the ruling ADMK ? the CPM found itself in an embarrassing position with its floor leader J. Hemachandran contradicting fellow Marxist K.C. Karunakaran, who had earlier welcomed the Jayalalithaa governments move.

 DMK treasurer Arcot Veerasamy, who had initially declared his party would accept the bill if all multi-system operators ? there are over 500 in Tamil Nadu ? were taken over by the government, changed tune in a matter of minutes to say any selective take-over meant political vindictiveness.

 The Congress and the CPM, too, had stated that they were not against nationalisation of key public services, but later objected on procedural grounds. 

 It was only the PMK, a DMK ally, which opposed the bill all along.

 On the last day of the 12th Assembly, the battlelines were clearly drawn for the coming state polls.

 Because we are going to come back (to power), you fear Sun TV so much and you are trying to choke it. But even God cannot strangulate Sun TVs voice, Veerasamy thundered before the Opposition stomped off. 

 The channel is owned by members of DMK chief M. Karunanidhis family.

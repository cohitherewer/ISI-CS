 Food for Lanka

 Chennai, Nov. 16: Amid the escalating violence in northern and eastern Sri Lanka, India has decided to send food for the beleaguered Tamil population there, reports our special correspondent.

 Foreign secretary Shiv Shankar Menon will also visit Colombo to convey Delhis concern about the plight of the island Tamils to the Lankan government, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has said in a letter to Tamil Nadu chief minister M. Karunanidhi.

 Taking note of the situation in northern and eastern parts of Sri Lanka, India is sending 5,200 tonnes of rice, 1,500 tonnes of sugar and 300 tonnes of milk powder as humanitarian assistance to the civilian Tamil population in those areas, Singh said. 

 The letter is in response to Karunanidhis recent statement drawing the Prime Ministers attention to the killing and injuring of hundreds of Tamils by the armed forces.

 Stating that there can be no justification for the killing of innocent Tamils, including women and children, Singh said India would make known its deep concern and anguish at the recent spurt in violence in Sri Lanka.

 We will reiterate to the Government of Sri Lanka that there is no military solution to the problem in Sri Lanka and the only way out is a negotiated political settlement, the letter said.

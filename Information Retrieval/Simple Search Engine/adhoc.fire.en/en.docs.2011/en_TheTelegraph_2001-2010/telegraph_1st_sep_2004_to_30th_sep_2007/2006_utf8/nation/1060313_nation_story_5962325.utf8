 A CAT for designers

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Ahmedabad, March 12: The National Institute of Design has come up with the idea of a common entrance test for design aspirants, on the lines of the common entrance test for IIMs, from the next academic year.

 The NID will be holding a meeting with two dozen-odd design institutes on April 8 to discuss the feasibility of the design aptitude test or DAT, Darlie Koshy, the executive director of the premier design school said. 

 The idea is to standardise admission to design courses as the 42-odd design institutes in the country are in nascent stages of development and only the NID is a recognised design institute. 

 The design school wants to discuss the possibility of such a test, to be conducted by NID, the scores of which could be used by the other institutes during admission. 

 Koshy believes that the 45-year-old institute ? that trains in industrial, communication and textile design ? is capable of leading upcoming design schools. It is already helping several designs schools in developing their curriculum.

 Considering the demand for modern designing in almost every sector, every year 5,000 to 8,000 jobs are available. But only 500 designers come out of various design institutes in the country. The NID trains only 250 designers.

 The increasing demand for trained designers led the NID to propose an increase in its student intake by 40 in 2007-2008. 

 The Planning Commission and the department of industrial policy and promotion have also suggested an increase in intake of undergraduates.

 The institute had decided to increase the number of students in its graduate diploma programme from 60 to 75 from the academic year starting June 2006. 

 To sort out the space crunch in the campus here, a new one is coming up in Gandhinagar. The first phase of the campus will be complete by March 2008. It will accommodate 200 students and core faculty members, Koshy said.

 The institute has also set up a research and develo- pment campus at Bangalore that will be inaugurated on March 31.

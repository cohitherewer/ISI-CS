 Trapped with spiked drink, foreigner raped

 SATISH NANDGAONKAR

 Mumbai, Dec. 31: A 27-year-old foreigner, who reportedly came to India to pursue a career in Bollywood, has filed a complaint that she was drugged at a city pub by two men and raped at an unknown location near the Mumbai domestic airport. 

 Police commissioner A.N. Roy said two men ? Sunil Multhani and Suresh Krishnani ? have been arrested and their complicity in the crime has been established.

 According to the womans complaint, the assault occurred in the early hours of December 28 after she had dinner at Hotel Bawa International, near the Chhatrapati Shivaji domestic airport.

 The woman stated in the FIR that after dinner, she had gone to the pub in the same three-star hotel, where two strangers accosted her. She ignored their advances and had drinks alone at the pub.

 According to the complaint, she left her drink mid-way to visit the toilet. After she returned and finished the drink, she began feeling drowsy.

 The two men offered to drop her home at Andheris Lokhandwala Complex, where a number of stars and aspiring starlets stay.

 The woman said she lost consciousness for more than an hour and when she came to her senses, she was in a room, possibly a hotel room, with two men assaulting her. When she resisted, she was beaten with a belt. At dawn, the men took her to Lokhandwala Complex.

 The woman and her lawyer visited the Vile Parle police station the next evening and lodged a complaint under Section 376 (g) (rape by more than one person) of the Indian Penal Code. The poor condition of the woman was cited as the reason for the delay in approaching the police.

 Her lawyer, Falguni Bramhabhatt, denied some television reports that the rape victim was an NRI model who arrived in Mumbai to make a career in Bollywood.

 However, additional commissioner, western region, Parambir Singh said: There is clear evidence to show that she came to Mumbai in September to become an actress in Bollywood.

 But Bramhabhatt said: She is a foreign national and came to Mumbai on a tourist visa. She belongs to a business family.

 The lawyer requested that the victims nationality be kept confidential for fear of social stigma.

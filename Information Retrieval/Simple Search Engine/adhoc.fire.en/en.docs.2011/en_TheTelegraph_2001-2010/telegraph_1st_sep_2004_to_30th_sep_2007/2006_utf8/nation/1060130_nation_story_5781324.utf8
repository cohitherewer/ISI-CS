 Hands chopped after roti row

Damoh (MP) (PTI): A youth died and another was critically 

wounded after their arms were chopped off over a minor dispute at Wahhama village 

near here on Sunday, police said.

 Virsingh Gond and his nephew Rammu Gond allegedly cut off the right arms of Tulsi Adivasi, 28, and Bhura Adivasi, 26, with an axe when they came to the Gonds house and asked for roti, the police said.

 Rammu had allegedly been itching for revenge since the duo reportedly attacked him for refusing them roti two days ago.

 The two were admitted to a nearby hospital, where Tulsi died.

 Virsingh and Rammu have been arrested.

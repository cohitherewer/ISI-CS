 Shuffle on Singh and Sonia plate

 Nainital, Sept. 22: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Congress chief Sonia Gandhi are set to give a hard look at the government and the party this weekend and decide on shuffling a few ministers.

 The talks are expected to centre round the foreign, home and defence ministries. The fate of Union human resource minister Arjun Singh is, however, undecided despite the growing disquiet within the Congress against him.

 At the seventh edition of the Congress chief ministers meet, Manmohan and Sonia are grappling with several issues, mainly internal security and agriculture. They will also be getting feedback to fine-tune the UPAs functioning.

 Manmohan is keen to revamp his council of ministers and fill the vacancy in the foreign office. He is on record that there will be a new foreign minister soon and the issue may be clinched in Nainital. But as he is travelling to South Africa late next week, the exercise could take place after he returns.

 Sources said he was looking at Union home minister Shivraj Patil as a possibility following his unsatisfactory handling of internal security. When 14 chief ministers of Congress-ruled states began arriving in Nainital today, there was near consensus that Patils continuation in the home ministry had become untenable.

 Defence minister Pranab Mukherjee is tipped for the challenging assignment in North Block. Mukherjee was shortlisted for home when the UPA ministry was formed in May 2004, but it was changed to defence at the last moment.

 If Patil is shifted to external affairs and Mukherjee to home, the Prime Minister has to find someone for defence, which S.M. Krishna, the former Karnataka chief minister, is believed to be keen on. But Krishna, now Maharashtra governor, is not an MP, which could work against him.

 Sources said a section of the Congress is keen that Arjun is given some other responsibility, preferably a gubernatorial assignment. But 10 Janpath is still undecided.

 Sonia, the sources said, is weighing the pros and cons of such a measure in view of next years Uttar Pradesh polls.

 The opposition to Arjunhas mounted in the wake of the Vande Mataram controversy. But he fell foul of the leadership for the manner in which he announced education quotas for other backward classes this May.

 Although the Congress and the Prime Minister were in favour of the quota, they did not like Arjuns attempt at one-upmanship.

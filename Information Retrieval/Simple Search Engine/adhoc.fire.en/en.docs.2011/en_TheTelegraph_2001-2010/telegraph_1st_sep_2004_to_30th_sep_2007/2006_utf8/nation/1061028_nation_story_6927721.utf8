 Super-quick terror quiz raises brows

 Bangalore, Oct. 27: Nikhil Gowda on Friday; terror plot on Saturday. That should have been the expected sequence of front-page lead news in Bangalores newspapers.

 Instead, full reports on the Mysore gunfight which supposedly took place at 12.15 am today were splashed under banner headlines in several dailies this morning.

 In most, the news had pushed the hotel brawl involving chief minister H.D. Kumaraswamys son off the front page.

 It led to doubts over the timings of the arrests as well as the polices revelations.

 One vernacular newspaper that reported the arrests said they happened at 10 pm beating the police version by over two hours.

 Even if that were correct, the many details of the conspiracy it published would suggest the ISI-trained youths, Mohammed Fahad and Mohammed Ali Hussein, had spilled the beans with surprising eagerness.

 At the state police chiefs 9 am news conference here, many reporters were amazed how his force could have dug up such a wealth of details in so short a time about the duo.

 The police had Fahads passport and visa numbers, his house number and street name in Karachi, and the details of his education from school to university. In between the grilling sessions, they had completed what must have been a lightning raid on their hideout.

 The police had even cracked Fahads computer password which usually would have taken weeks and peered into his inbox and sent box, reading his emails to his handlers in Pakistan and the bomb-making tips he had downloaded from a website.

 If 9 am was too early to have finished all that, consider this: the Mysore police commissioner had briefed the media there even earlier, between 7 and 7.30, and revealed the same information.

 Parts of the version failed to convince. One of the duo had allegedly fired from an AK-47, which should have been difficult to carry unobserved on their Hero Puch, a 70cc two-wheeler police say they were riding.

 The hand-drawn sketch of the roads around the alleged targets, which the police claimed to have seized, seemed too amateurish.

 Sources said that after such arrests, police would normally keep quiet for seven to 10 days, using the time to question the suspects before they had to produce them before a magistrate and seek remand. Only after they have found out enough would they go public.

 The timing of the revelations, however, will make the chief minister happy: they have deflected attention completely from his sons capers.

 The police said the two youths had confessed they were to set up a module and wait for the actual bombers to arrive from Kashmir.

 Fahad allegedly arrived in Bangalore some eight months ago and headed straight to Mysore, opened a gift shop in the Rajendra Nagar locality and set up base nearby. He had received Rs 8 lakh through various banks, a part of which he passed on to Al-Badr.

 Hussein from Manshera, who had sneaked into Kashmir in 2002 and risen to become an Al-Badr district commander, joined him four months ago. He had been asked by his handlers to assume an Indian identity through documents like a driving licence, apply for a passport and then re-enter the country posing as an Indian. But his plans were delayed.

 Police said Fahad a member of All Pakistan Mohajir Students Organisation is fluent in Hindi, English, Malayalam and Tamil. His father, Abdullah Hai, had left for Pakistan from Kozhikode in 1964. His mother is Pakistani-born.

 1000 Indians on Gulf test-case strike

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Dubai, Jan. 17: The fate of over 1,000 Indian workers, the bulk of them from Kerala, remains uncertain against the backdrop of a strike they are staging to press their claim for wages in arrears.

 It is the most serious labour dispute to erupt in the UAE, but is symptomatic of the situation in the labour market in view of the high demand for workers in the booming construction industry in Dubai and elsewhere in the Emirates. 

 Some 200 workers at the Perfect Group, which supplies skilled and unskilled personnel to the construction and contracting sectors, began their protest last week, complaining that the company officials were mistreating them and owed them up to four months of pay in arrears.

 However, the company says only one months wages is unpaid and rejects the charge of mistreatment.

 The number of striking workers swelled to 1,000 over the weekend, and police had to use force to disperse them when they converged on the labour office in Sharjah on Saturday.

 Efforts by the Indian consul general in Dubai to solve the problem failed to make any headway after both sides skipped meetings on several occasions.

 The workers approached the ministry of labour again but they faced a technical hurdle ? officials there asked for copies of their passports and labour permits, which most of them do not have.

 The original documents are in the companys possession. 

 Filing a case against the company for arrears would involve legal fees that could run to several thousand dirhams, which the workers cannot afford. 

 Some among the workers do not have legal status in the country, having arrived here on visit visas and overstaying the granted duration.

 The local authorities are aware of such violations, but the number of violators is so high that it would be a mammoth task to tackle the situation. 

 Some contractors claim that the authorities are deliberately holding back action, as the construction and contracting sector needs workers and it would take months and thousands of dirhams to recruit and bring them from outside the country.

 On an average, according to managers of labour supply companies, it costs up to 9,000 dirhams (Rs 108,476) per worker, including visa fees, air fare, work permit fees, charges for mandatory medical tests and an obligatory (but refundable) bank guarantee of 3,000 dirhams. 

 The guarantee amount would be appropriated by the authorities in favour of the worker, including his or her passage home in the event of any unresolved dispute with the employer. 

 The high cost translates into a hike in the price of employment visas being sold by agents in Kerala.

 Some of the striking workers said they paid up to Rs 150,000 each for their visas. 

 Workers also complain that they were being paid around five dirhams per hour and not with the initial offer of eight dirhams. 

 The situation at the residential camp of the Perfect Group remains tense, with the workers accusing company officials of trying to intimidate and terrorise them, a charge denied by the firm.

 Most of the workers say they do not have money to buy food and meet other needs and they are managing with help from friends, a situation that cannot continue for long.

 We are desperate and would do anything to make sure that we get what is due to us, said Vijayan, a worker from Kerala. 

 Udham Singh, who hails from Bihar, said the company owed him three months pay. Ive not sent any money home to feed my family in the last three months, he said.

 The company should realise that there is no way we could make any compromise over back wages earned with our blood and sweat.

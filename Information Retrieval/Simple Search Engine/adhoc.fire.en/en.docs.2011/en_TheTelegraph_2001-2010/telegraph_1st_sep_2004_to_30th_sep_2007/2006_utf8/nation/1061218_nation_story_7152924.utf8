 PM lists five growth tests

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec.17: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today warned against being complacent about the Indian economy as major development challenges still await solutions. 

 Addressing the golden jubilee celebrations of the National Council of Applied Economic Research, Singh began on a positive note. Circumstances are today favourable for sustained, rapid and equitable growth of the economy, he said.

 Then came the words of caution. However, we must not be complacent. It would be wrong to assume, as some do, that the major development challenges have been solved and the Indian economy can now effortlessly coast towards becoming a developed country.

 The Prime Minister went on to explain the five challenges India would face over the next decade, both as a prerequisite for fast growth and as a consequence of it. These were:

 Revitalising the rural economy. Singh said agricultural activity needs to be redirected to higher-value activities so that small landholders earn a decent income and non-farm employment can support farm income

 Improving delivery of essential public services such as basic education and healthcare 

 Preparing Indias financial system for greater inclusion and increased global integration. We have to further extend the reach of our formal financial system to all sections of the society. This is crucial for permitting our small entrepreneurs and producers to realise their potential, Singh said

 Establishing a regulatory culture to facilitate cost-effective private investment in infrastructure. The Prime Minister stressed on the need for more public-private partnership in this sector. Such investments will only materialise if there is confidence in the independence and stability of the regulatory regime.

 Modernising the governance of cities so that they can generate the resources for their own growth and attract private financing in a stable environment. Singh said Indias competitiveness as a nation would vastly depend on the efficient functioning of the cities and noted that urbanisation is an expensive business.

 Although some of his colleagues in the Congress were sceptical of the 10 per cent growth rate the UPA government has envisaged, Singh was not apologetic. 

 The National Development Council has recently directed that we should aim for a growth rate of 10 per cent by the end of the 11th Plan. Rapid growth is needed to provide hope and productive employment to the millions of young people joining the labour force each year, he said.

 Singh also had a word of praise for the private sector. India today faces few external constraints on its growth. The responsiveness of the Indian private sector to economic liberalisation and increased international integration has been generally satisfactory, Singh said, adding that the responsiveness of India Inc imparted tremendous resilience to the economy.

 Yesterday, the Prime Minister had made some of these points but in a different context. Asked to comment on the political opposition to the proposed Tata Motors plant in Singur, he said: We need more investment to create more jobs. Our young people need a fast moving economy to provide them with job opportunities, which is their right. So it goes without saying that anything which comes in the way of maintaining industrial peace constitutes a setback.

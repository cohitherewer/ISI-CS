 Foreign berth pot boils again

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 14: With Prime Minister Manmohan Singh returning to the capital tonight after back-to-back overseas trips, speculation has again started on a cabinet shuffle.

 The key question being asked in Congress and government circles is whether Singh will retain the foreign ministers portfolio or find a replacement.

 A senior functionary involved in the discussions said in keeping with his earlier statements that the Prime Minister was most likely to have a new foreign minister before Diwali, which falls on Saturday.

 By the process of elimination, the choice had narrowed to two names: Pranab Mukherjee and Kamal Nath. 

 Mukherjee was initially not keen on the portfolio, as he would have to work directly under the Prime Minister and have little leeway in conceptualising and shaping policies.

 However, after a perceived snub delivered by Congress president Sonia Gandhi last month in Nainital, he is left with little choice. 

 Sonia had then made it clear that Singh would not have a deputy Prime Minister a comment apparently made to scotch rumours that Mukherjee had made his acceptance of the foreign ministers job conditional on being made the official No. 2 in the cabinet.

 If for some reason, Sonia did not want Mukherjee to be shifted from defence, the sources said, commerce minister Kamal Nath would be the next choice. Science and technology minister Kapil Sibal could then move to commerce. 

 It is believed the Prime Minister was reluctant to make large-scale changes because he felt that these could affect the continuance of P. Chidambaram as finance minister. 

 Chidambaram was in the line of the Congresss fire on several occasions in the recent past, the last being in Nainital where he initially made light of the queries posed by the partys general secretaries on economic policies.

 The only other major change being talked of is the likely exit of T.R. Baalu, the DMKs shipping, road transport and highways minister, from the government.

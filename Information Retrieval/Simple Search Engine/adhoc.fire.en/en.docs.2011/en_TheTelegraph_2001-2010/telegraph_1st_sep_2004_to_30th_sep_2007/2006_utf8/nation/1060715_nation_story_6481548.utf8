 Peace talks take a blow

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 14: The Mumbai blasts have delayed peace talks with Pakistan, although India denied the dialogue is off.

 According to a tentative programme prepared at the beginning of the year, the Pakistan foreign secretary was to arrive next week to sum up the third round of the composite dialogue, but Delhi is in no mood to host the official now.

 Who says the process is off? Indian foreign secretary Shyam Saran said today, but added that Delhi has not proposed any fresh dates for the talks.

 Saran said the Mumbai blasts were unsettling, and co-operation with the neighbouring country is a two-way street. No cooperation can be one-sided. India will do what it has to do, he said.

 Delhi and Islamabad had prepared a calendar of talks at the start of the third round of the composite dialogue earlier this year. The talks were to end with the meeting of foreign secretaries on July 20-21, followed by an interaction between the foreign ministers.

 This calendar is subject to confirmation from both sides. Islamabad had conveyed to India around a week ago that it was willing to attend the meeting on July 20-21. India has neither confirmed the dates nor proposed fresh ones.

 Officials said that after the Mumbai explosions it would be difficult to hold the talks, particularly when investigations are pointing to Pakistans involvement. 

 India wants a fresh commitment from Pakistan on dismantling terrorist infrastructure. Officials said Islamabads claim that it has cracked down on militant outfits has fallen flat after the blasts in Mumbai and Srinagar.

 The officials said the foreign secretary level talks were crucial as these would be the culmination of the third round of the composite dialogue. Fresh strategies were to be decided to take the peace process forward.

 Nuclear deal

 India today said any provision in the proposed US legislation that does not measure up to the July 18 joint statement and the separation plan agreed on between the countries will not be acceptable.

 Shyam Saran said the key to Delhi was commitments it would make in the bilateral 123 agreement and the safeguards arrangement with the International Atomic Energy Agency.

 Shyam Saran, who returned from Paris after meeting Nicholas Burns, the US nuclear deal negotiator, said the new legislation will be the product of an American political process and could include some references that India may find unpalatable. Indias obligations will only be those that we undertake in the bilateral 123 cooperation agreement and the safeguards arrangement with IAEA, he said.

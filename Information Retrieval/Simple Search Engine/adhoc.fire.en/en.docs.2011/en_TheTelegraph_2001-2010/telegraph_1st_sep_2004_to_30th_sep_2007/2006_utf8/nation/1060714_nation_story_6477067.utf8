 SC rape slur shield for women

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 13: A woman cannot be charged with gangrape even if she played a role in the crime, the Supreme Court has said.

 The order came from a bench headed by Justice Arijit Pasayat as it set aside a verdict of Madhya Pradesh High Court, which held one Priya Patel guilty of gangrape for helping her husband rape a woman.

 The victim had alleged that Priya slapped her and closed the door of the house while he was assaulting her.

 But the apex court said though it is not necessary for a person to have actually committed rape to be charged with gangrape along with the other accused in such a case, it cannot make a woman guilty of rape. This is conceptually inconceivable, it said.

 A woman cannot be said to have an intention to commit rape, the court said, adding that the provision only indicated that when one or more persons acted in furtherance of their common intention to rape, every one would be deemed to have committed the rape. Such a woman can, however, be prosecuted for abetting the offence, the court said.

 The high court, while dismissing Patels appeal, had noted that though a woman could not commit rape, she could be prosecuted for gangrape if she facilitated the act.

 But the apex court pointed out that a bare reading of Section 375 of the IPC, which defines rape, made the position clear that rape can be committed only by a man.

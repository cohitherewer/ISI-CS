 EC sends fresh quota query

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 12: Not satisfied with human resource development minister Arjun Singhs reply on the governments quota move, the Election Commission today sought some clarifications on reservation for OBC students in elite educational institutions.

 According to sources, the fresh clarifications that the commission has sought are technical in nature. 

 The poll body found a mismatch between Singhs reply on Sunday and the version that appeared in newspapers the next day, sources said, adding that the commission has, therefore, sought to know which is the correct version.

 The Election Commission today sent a communication in this regard to cabinet secretary B.K. Chaturvedi, asking him to obtain the governments clarification and forward it to the commission by April 18. 

 It had earlier said the HRD minister had prima facie violated the model code of conduct for elections by announcing plans for reservation.

 In his reply to the poll panel, Arjun Singh had said: There was no announcement of any concession or any breach of the model code of conduct. 

 A decision of the central government with regard to percentage of reservation of seats was yet to be taken, the minister had told the commission. 

 Backing Arjun, the Congress today sought to douse the controversy, saying no government decision has been taken and what had taken place were mere inter-ministerial proposals.

 We have not reached a stage where it can be called a government decision. What was reported were mere exchanges of inter-ministerial proposals, Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi told reporters. He said there was no need for the Congress to take a stand as all parties had given their opinion when the matter was debated in Parliament last year.

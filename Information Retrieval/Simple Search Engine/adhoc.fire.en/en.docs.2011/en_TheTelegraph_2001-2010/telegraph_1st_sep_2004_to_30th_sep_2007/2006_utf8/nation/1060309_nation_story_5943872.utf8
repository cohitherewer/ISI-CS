 Selective airport frisking on anvil

 New Delhi, March 8 (PTI): If you are peace-loving and unsuspicious, you may soon be able to fly without going through the rigours of multiple check at airports.

 The Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), entrusted with the task of airport security, is planning a novel concept of profiling passengers to ascertain their behaviour so that the normal ones can be exempt from stringent checking.

 Under the new plan, CISF personnel will use closed-circuit television and other security gadgets to understand the behavioural pattern and conduct of every person entering an airport.

 If you are a normal and peace-loving person, then you should be able to go through without vigorous tests, CISF director-general S.I.S. Ahmed said today.

 The move comes at a time when airports across the world are beefing up security and making plans to fingerprint and photograph passengers to keep tabs on terrorists.

 Scanning of passengers will begin the moment they enter the airport. From the person who says namaste to the main security personnel at the gates, everyone would be in the job of profiling a person, Ahmed said.

 The CISF is in charge of security at 54 domestic and international airports, including those at Delhi, Mumbai and Calcutta, and is all set to take over a few more soon, Ahmed said.

 It is also in talks to provide security to the Hyderabad and Bangalore airports and Delhis metro rail. Six battalions of the CISF are assisting Delhi police to ensure foolproof security to the Delhi metro and talks are for giving us full charge, he said.

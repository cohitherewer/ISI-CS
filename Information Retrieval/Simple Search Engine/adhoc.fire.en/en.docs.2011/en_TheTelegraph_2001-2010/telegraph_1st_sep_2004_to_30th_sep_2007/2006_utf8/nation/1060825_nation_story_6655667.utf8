 High court warning on Ramadoss

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 24: Delhi High Court today threatened to restrain health minister Anbumani Ramadoss from heading the AIIMS governing body if the government fails to respond to a petition alleging that the induction of the minister into it was unlawful.

 Justice Anil Kumar warned that the court would pass an interim order restraining the health minister and the health secretary from attending governing body meetings if a reply to the July 1 notice is not filed within two weeks. 

 Dr S. Kale and nine others had challenged the induction of the minister and the secretary, alleging that it violated provisions of the amended AIIMS Act. The act was amended in 2000 to protect the autonomy of the institute, on the recommendations of a joint parliamentary committee in 1996, the petitioners said. 

 It had recommended that they should not be members of the governing body to ensure complete autonomy for AIIMS.

 The court had on July 1 directed the Centre and AIIMS to respond to the petition within four weeks.

 The matter has been posted for further hearing on September 27.

 One Aligarh riots, another spreads calm

 Aligarh, April 7: Garment trader Mazhar Ali was escorting six Hindu employees out of a riot-hit locality on their way home when he was shot and injured.

 Randhir Kumar barricaded his 16 Muslim workers inside his factory while neighbours stood guard through the night following a threat to turn the lock-making unit into another Best Bakery.

 As Aligarh rioted for the third day, raising the death toll to six, tales of courage and solidarity kept emerging.

 Kumars factory is in Upper Court in the Delhigate area that has been gripped by violence since Wednesday night. The labourers had still turned up for work on Thursday morning, thinking the clashes would soon be brought under control and reluctant to miss a days wage.

 In the evening, some people rang up Kumar and said they planned to burn his labourers alive in the factory.

 With rumours already swirling that many of the towns lock-making units would be targeted, Kumar took no chances and called police.

 It would have been too risky for the labourers to walk back home through the volatile locality. So they stayed back, spending a sleepless night as police inspector Vijay Kumar stood outside with his small force, joined by many residents of nearby houses.

 It seems the attack was indeed planned. The rioters targets were the lock-making factories, garment shops, groceries and showrooms owned by one community, said Mazhar Ali from his bed at J.N. Medical College Hospital.

 When violence erupted for the second time yesterday afternoon -- following Wednesday nights initial skirmishes ? it seemed to follow a pattern. A warning would reach a locality. Then the rioters would arrive, loot the shops and set them on fire.

 Before an area was attacked, the message of the impending attack would reach it. The violence began at Safara Bazaar and within an hour spread to Railway Road, Mahavirganj and Halwaikhana, said Abdul Karim, hit by a bullet in his back and admitted to the same hospital.

 In the towns main business district, about 2 km from the Aligarh Muslim University, gutted shops and markets and partly burnt houses told the story.

 Inside a hospital, 14-year-old Khalid and 15-year-old Pintoo lay side by side, their heads bandaged. The boys had come here from the neighbouring Etawah district in search of jobs. When trouble began, they both ran for their lives but got hit by stones.

 The boys live in one of the labourers colonies where Hindus and Muslims stay close together. Many of the colonies were deserted today with the families having taken shelter at school buildings or police stations.

 Ousted, Naidu woos farmers

 Rajahmundry, May 28: Out of power, N. Chandrababu Naidu is worried about the farmer.

 The former chief minister, identified with IT and reforms, has said the benefits of 16 years of economic reforms were yet to reach the common man, particularly farmers and the rural poor.

 Naidu was speaking at Mahanadu 2006, the annual convention of the Telugu Desam Party which is celebrating its silver jubilee. The meeting is being held in this town, 370 km from Hyderabad, on the banks of the Godavari in East Godavari district.

 It is the devils rule in Andhra Pradesh where political opponents and innocent farmers are at the mercy of vested interests and the ruling party, he said. Mounting farmer suicides during his nine years as chief minister had cost Naidu his power in 2004.

 Desams rout in the Assembly and Lok Sabha elections and in municipal polls that followed appear to have forced a rethink ? on reaching out to the common man and to other members of NTRs family whom Naidu had sidelined after wresting the reins from his father-in-law in 1995. 

 NTRs son Harikrishna, an actor-politician, and Naidus brother Ramamurthy were present at the Mahanadu. Both joined the party last week after years of estrangement. Harikrishna had floated his own outfit, which flopped in elections while Ramamurthy had been used by the Congress to gain political mileage. 

 Over 7,000 delegates are participating in the three-day annual convention that coincides with the birth anniversary of NTR, the partys founder who died in 1996. Although change of leadership is ruled out, almost every Desam leader was curious if new blood was being inducted at any level. 

 We have not given thought to question of change of leadership. Naidu continues to be our unquestioned leader. We are only focused on change in policy and to alter our party image, said G. Butchaiah Chowdhary, a former minister and prominent leader from East Godavari.

 The Mahanadu is debating the challenges before Desam for survival both at the state and the Centre. 

 In New Delhi, its campaign for a third alternative to the Congress and the BJP has fallen flat after the recent Assembly polls in five states that saw the Congress and the Left come out on top. The issue is not even being discussed at the meeting.

 Naidu attacked the UPA government, accusing it of corruption, scant concern for farmers and dumping the non-aligned policy to go with the US. The office of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is being controlled by remote by the Congress chief Sonia Gandhi.

 The Desam leader also found faults with the Congress governments free power scheme for farmers. The YSR government is cheating the farmers by giving poor quality power and also charging them to the tune of Rs 900 crore while the TDP charged them only Rs 450 crore, he said.

 TRS boss coaxed out of fast

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 25: The indefinite hunger strike of Telengana Rashtra Samiti chief K. Chandrasekhar Rao has ended in two days.

 Rao, who sat on the fast at noon on Wednesday to protest against the governments indifference to his demand for a separate Telengana state, called it off at midnight yesterday, exactly 36 hours later.

 The move came after Union agriculture minister Sharad Pawar visited him and conveyed an appeal by Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee. Chatterjee had yesterday urged Rao to break his fast when TRS members raised the matter in the House. 

 The TRS chief, however, vowed to intensify his agitation by mobilising the people of Telengana.

 Later, TRS general secretary V. Prakash said the aim of the hunger strike to expose Congress, which betrayed the cause of Telengana by denying the formation of a separate state has been achieved.

 We have told the nation about the double standards of the Congress. The common minimum programme of the UPA favours smaller states. The Congress has changed its stand, Prakash said.

 Rao, along with his deputy A. Narendra, had quit the Union cabinet on Tuesday, demanding a commitment from the Congress-led government on carving out a Telengana state out of Andhra Pradesh.

 The TRS has, however, deferred its decision on leaving the UPA.

 For the next 10 days, I will be in Hyderabad. The ties of the TRS with the UPA will be decided only after that, Rao told reporters at his residence today.

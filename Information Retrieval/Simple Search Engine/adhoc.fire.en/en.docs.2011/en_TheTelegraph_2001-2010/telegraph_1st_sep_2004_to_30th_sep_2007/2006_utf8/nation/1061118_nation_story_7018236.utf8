 India in rich family race

 New Delhi, Nov. 17 (PTI): In a new world order being shaped by the increasing economic might of India and China, the number of high-income households in the two countries would more than double to 6.4 million by 2010, from less than three million in 2005, a new study says.

 According to data compiled by the Hong Kong-based research firm CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, India would account for 3.8 million rich households in 2010, about 1.2 million more than China.

 The study also shows that India will have lesser deprived households the lowest in the income range. Their number in India would drop to 114 million in 2010 from 135 million in 2002. China, which had 301 million deprived households last year would have 290 million in 2010, the study says.

 However, four years on, the combined number of rich households in the two countries would still account for less than 1 per cent of the total number of households.

 According to the study, in an Indian population of 221 million households in 2010, 3.8 million would be rich, 6.1 million strivers, 22 million seekers, 75 million aspirers and 114 million deprived, based on their income range.

 India and China are continuously getting urban, nuclear and richer, the CLSA says. The two countries would together add 376 million to their urban population by 2020, which is 1.25 times the current population of the US.

 The trend towards nuclear families in both countries is one of the reasons for the sharp increase in the number of households there would be 77 million new households by 2020.

 The number of rich Indian households would increase from 0.8 million in 2002 to 3.8 million in 2010. In comparison, China would register a slower growth, from 0.8 million in 2005 to 2.6 million.

 The data shows that till the 1970s, the urbanisation trend in both countries was nearly the same with a rate of well under 20 per cent. 

 However, China picked up the momentum after the 1980s and the rate nudged the 30 per cent mark in the next two decades. 

 The Indian rate has also increased, but has hovered in the range of 15-25 per cent.

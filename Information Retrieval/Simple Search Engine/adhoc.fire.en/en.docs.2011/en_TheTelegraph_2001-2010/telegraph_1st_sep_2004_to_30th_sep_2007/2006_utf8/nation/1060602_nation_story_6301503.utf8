 Landmine blast kills 12 jawans

 Jamshedpur: Jawans of the CRPFs 

 bomb disposal squad were killed in a landmine explosion 

 in West Singhbhum district on Thursday morning, our bureau 

 reports. Police put the number of dead at 12.

 The jawans were returning after defusing bombs planted in a school building at Thalkobad, 35 km from the site of the blast at Saranda forest near Kiriburu. Police officials now believe it was a trap.

 The school had closed for the summer vacation and the police planned to use the building as a static base for conducting anti-Maoist operations in the forest. But when information trickled in that the building had been mined, officials decided to send a large contingent to recover the mines before it was blown up.

 Accordingly, around 80 policemen, among them CRPF jawans drawn from Bokaro and Chaibasa, were sent. They executed the operation smoothly, said Chaibasa DIG Anurag Gupta. 

 Kunal Saha denied damages

 Calcutta: The medical negligence 

 charge brought by the US-based doctor Kunal Saha against 

 five Calcutta doctors was dismissed on Thursday by the National 

 Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, New Delhi.

 The three-member bench of the commission dismissed Sahas claim for a compensation of over Rs 77.76 crore. 

 Saha had filed the case in 1999, holding Sukumar Mukherjee, Baidyanth Halder, Abani Roy Chowdhury, Balram Prosad and Kaushik Nandy responsible for the death of his wife Anuradha.

 Doctors or surgeons do not undertake that they will positively cure a patient. There may be occasions beyond the control of the medical practitioner to cure the patients, the commission said. 

 Saha said the judgment is utterly shocking.

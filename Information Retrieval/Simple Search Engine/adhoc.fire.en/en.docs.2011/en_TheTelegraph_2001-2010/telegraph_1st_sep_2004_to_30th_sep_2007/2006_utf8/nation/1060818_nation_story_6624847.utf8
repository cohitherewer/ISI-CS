 Calcutta, Aug. 17: President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam will inaugurate Infocom 2006, the countrys biggest information, communication and technology exposition, on December 6 in Calcutta. 

 In its fifth edition, the annual event organised by Nasscom and Businessworld, an ABP group publication will be bigger both in scope and scale, the organisers said at the curtain-raiser. 

 We have witnessed phenomenal growth in Infocom in terms of participation, reach and impact over the years. This time the show will be bigger and better, said an organising committee spokesperson, giving the programme schedule. 

 Innovate to Differentiate is the theme for the four-day conference and five-day exhibition between December 6 and 10. More than 2,000 delegates from India and abroad are expected to log on for 25 sessions, to be conducted in two parallel tracks. 

 The sessions will cover a wide range of areas from the scope of information, communication and technology in healthcare and issues facing business and knowledge process outsourcing companies to discussions on future technologies and the role of e-governance in developing countries. 

 Industry leaders and specialists from software, IT, manufacturing and telecom companies from India and abroad, government representatives and academics will talk about technology, business and governance.

 Besides, there will be the Bengal chief ministers interactive, the IT ministers roundtable and the CEO conclave. 

 But Infocom is not only about tech talk. In line with this years theme Innovate to Differentiate the latest products and services will be on display and 350 exhibitors have already booked space at the Salt Lake Stadium grounds, the exhibition venue. 

 Quiz competitions, a job mart and an Edufair are planned. Up from last years 100,000 visitors, the organisers are expecting a footfall of over 150,000 at the 200,000-sq-ft ground. 

 To make the event global, we have tied up with the best in the world, Deutsche Messe AG, organisers of the worlds largest trade fair CeBIT, the spokesperson said. 

 CeBIT will put up a pavilion where companies from Europe will exhibit their products and services.

 We are instituting Infocom Future Leadership Awards for B-school boys and girls. Students will have to submit papers on this years theme and the best six, three Indian and three international, will receive cash awards and internship offers, the spokesperson said.

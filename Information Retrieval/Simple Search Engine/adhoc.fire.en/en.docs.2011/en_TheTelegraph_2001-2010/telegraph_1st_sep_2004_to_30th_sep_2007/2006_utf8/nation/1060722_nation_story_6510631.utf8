 War room leak arrest

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 21: The CBI today arrested Abhishek Verma, the businessman son of former Congress MP Veena Verma, in the navy war room leak case.

 The investigating agency will produce Abhishek before a designated court tomorrow to secure his remand.

 Abhishek was summoned to the CBI headquarters today for questioning in connection with incriminating documents and a computer hard disk which the agency had seized from his residence and offices in Gurgaon and Delhi during raids on June 23.

 After a thorough examination of the seizure, the CBI found several clues linked to the navy war room leak case. Investigations carried out also pointed out (Abhishek) Vermas very close links with two former navy officials Kulbhushan Parashar and Ravi Shankaran who have been declared proclaimed offenders by the court. It was precisely on the basis on this evidence that Verma was questioned today, said a source.

 When Abhishek could not provide satisfactory answers to questions asked by the sleuths, the investigating agency thought it appropriate to arrest him on the charge of criminal conspiracy, sources said.

 Residences of three under-secretaries of the ministry of defence ? Prem Shanker Mehra, R.S. Dudani and H.S. Bhatia ? were also searched by the CBI today. The CBI had registered a case on the navy war room leak on March 20 and conducted raids across the country on April 6, besides arresting six persons.

 Last months raids against 14 people, including Abhishek and his chartered accountant Sushil Baghera, revealed a larger conspiracy of secret and confidential information being leaked from various directorates of the defence ministry. CBI sources refused to deny or confirm if there was any evidence linking Abhishek with this larger conspiracy.

 Among those raided by the CBI last month were the residences of Commodore A.K. Patnaik, officer-in-charge of INS Kolkata, Commander D.K. Swain based in Cuttack, Commander (retired) S.S. Rathore and army officers Lt Col S.S. Chaudhury and Major Devendra Sharma. It has also raided the houses of navy commanders S.M. Hanchinal, A.K. Pandey, B.B.S. Jamwal and S.S. Dhiman, who look after quality assurance of weapons and equipment in Calcutta.

 The CBI has said investigations indicate a ring of compromised officials in various wings of the armed forces and the ministry of defence.

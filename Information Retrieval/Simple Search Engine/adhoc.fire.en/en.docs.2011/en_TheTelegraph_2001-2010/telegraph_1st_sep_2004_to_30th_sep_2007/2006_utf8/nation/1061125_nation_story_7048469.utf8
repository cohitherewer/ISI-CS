 Cubs raise tiger hope

 Jaipur, Nov. 24 (PTI): The Ranthambhore tiger reserve in Rajasthan has been blessed with 10 cubs in the last few months, raising hopes of an increase in the number of big cats in the wilderness.

 Three cubs were spotted near the Padamtala area of the national park yesterday while seven were seen playing with their parents in the last two months, deputy field director R.S. Shekhawat said. 

 As a result of better conservation and breeding facilities, and the cooperation of villagers, the cubs were born, Shekhawat said. 

 Earlier, forest guards had spotted three cubs at Kachida and two each at Darraneegarh and Gelai Sagar ponds in the reserve, he said.

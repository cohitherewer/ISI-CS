 Envoy to Dhaka quits over Menon

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 26: South Blocks age of unrest lingered as Shiv Shankar Menons elevation to foreign secretary prompted another senior colleague to seek voluntary retirement.

 High commissioner to Bangladesh 

 Veena Sikri (in picture) decided to follow husband Rajiv 

 Sikri, who quit as secretary (east) earlier this month after 

 the high commissioner to Pakistan superseded over a dozen 

 officers.

 Sikri decided to quit after all efforts failed to persuade her to opt for another position. Sources said the government is considering her request. Another officer, ambassador to France T.C.A Rangachari, is also thinking of quitting.

 Menon, who takes charge in October, was in headquarters last week and held meetings with the joint secretaries before heading back to Islamabad to pack his bags.

 Officials said the arrival of the new foreign secretary would lead to a shuffle in the ministry. Those he superseded can resign or seek voluntary retirement or opt for ambassadorial postings. They cannot serve at headquarters under him.

 Plea to send docs back to work

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 23: Delhi High Court today sought the Centres response on a petition seeking to invoke the Essential Services Maintenance Act against doctors protesting against the proposed reservation for Other Backward Classes in higher educational institutions. 

 Posting the matter for hearing on June 1, a bench headed by acting Chief Justice Vijender Jain asked the Centre, the Delhi government and the Medical Council of India to respond within two weeks to the PIL seeking to declare the ongoing strike by doctors illegal.

 The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Medical Association has contended that if the government invokes ESMA, doctors would be forced to get back to work.

 Arguing on behalf of the petitioners, advocate Prashant Bhushan alleged that thousands of poor patients had to bear the brunt of the strike as the government had not made any alternative arrangements in state-run hospitals.

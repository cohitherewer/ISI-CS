 Uma support worries Chauhan

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Bhopal, Feb. 15: Rebel BJP leader Uma Bharti is under pressure to contest Lok Sabha polls from Vidisha, a seat tipped to be vacated by chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan, who is now contesting Assembly elections from Budhini. 

 Chauhan, who took over as Madhya Pradesh chief minister in December 2005, has to get himself elected to the Assembly within six months. Yesterday, BJP MLA Rajendra Singh quit the Budhini seat, clearing the decks for Chauhan to contest from there. However, the chief minister did not quit his Lok Sabha seat.

 Chauhans reluctance to hold simultaneous Lok Sabha and Assembly byelections is being seen as a sign of lack of confidence. The chief minister reportedly wants to avoid giving Uma a chance to enter the Lok Sabha when he would be tied up with the Assembly byelections. In the current scenario, Chauhan in all probability would vacate the Vidisha Lok Sabha seat after getting elected to the Assembly.

 Sources close to Uma said the sadhvi was toying with the idea of testing waters in Madhya Pradesh and enter the Lok Sabha. At present, she is an MLA but seldom attends sessions.

 Umas supporters are hoping that if the BJP nominee is defeated in the Lok Sabha byelection, it would rattle a majority of party MLAs and functionaries. Uma may have left the BJP but she has pockets of support in the state unit. A few days before her unceremonious exit from the party, Uma had chaired a meeting of party MLAs at her Bhopal residence where over 100 BJP MLAs had signed a letter favouring her as chief minister.

 The BJP high command, however, ignored the representation and crowned Chauhan instead.

 Uma is currently camping in Madhya Pradesh, leading a janadesh yatra (public mandate march). She has been drawing good crowds but her supporters are egging her on to perform something spectacular. An electoral win over the BJP could be one such demonstration of mass appeal and authority, they argue.

 Communists break ranks, swear by God

 - Brahmin and Christian MLAs flaunt faith in House

 JOHN MARY

 Thiruvananthapuram, May 26: Two CPM legislators took their oath in the name of God while enrolling as members of the new Kerala Assembly, reflecting the changing attitude of the communist parties towards matters of faith.

 With the exception of Aisha Potti and M.M. Monayi, the other 59 party MLAs made a solemn affirmation.

 The Constitution allows lawmakers to be sworn in either in the name of God or by solemn affirmation. By tradition, members of the CPM, CPI and even the RSP take the oath by solemn affirmation ? a pledge by which they commit themselves to upholding the Constitution.

 Potti, a lawyer who won from Kottarakara in Kollam district, said: Weve been committed to communism and the party. But wed never given up on our faith while being active in the revolutionary movement.

 A member of the CPM area committee in Kollam, Potti is the states first Brahmin woman MLA. Monayi, member of its Ernakulam district committee, is a Christian.

 K.G. Gopalakrishnan Zachary, an expert in legislative procedures, said: In my memory, this is the first time a CPM member has taken the oath in Gods name (in Kerala).

 Neither has any communist lawmaker been known to do so in Bengal. But at least three Christian CPM members from Kerala recently took the oath in the name of God in Parliament.

 Dr Sebastian Paul (Ernakulam) is an Independent backed by the CPM while K.S. Manoj (Alappuzha) and Lonappan Nambadan (Mukundapuram) had won on party symbols.

 Prof Ninan Koshy, a former director of the World Council of Churches, said: Up to the mid-70s, the CPM had been opposed to members expressing their religious affiliations. The party has obviously learnt to accept minorities and those of other faiths into its ranks without asking them first to denounce their faith.

 In the 80s, the late party ideologue, E.M.S. Namboodiripad, had asked Kerala Congress (Joseph) leader P.J. Joseph, now education minister, to disown the bishops in public before letting him join the Left Democratic Front.

 Two decades ago, the CPM could hope to reach out to Keralas minority heartland only by piggy-riding a Christian party, but not now. Recent polls have shown that it has been able to make direct inroads into the minority territory.

 This is an outcome of the partys tolerant approach towards people of different faiths and a realisation by different communities that the party seeks their hand in checkmating right-wing Hindutva forces at the national level, Prof Koshy said.

 Former MLA Umesh Challiyil of the regional outfit JSS, who took the oath in the name of backward-class saint Sree Narayana Guru five years ago, had a different problem, though.

 The high court struck down the swearing-in and asked him to pay a fine of Rs 500 for each of the 83 illegal sittings. He paid the fine, took the oath again in the name of God, but went to the Supreme Court. The case is pending.

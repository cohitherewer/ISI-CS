 Heart no. 1 killer in villages

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New 

 Delhi, April 14: Urban affluence, symbolised by 

 crowded malls and fast food chains, hasnt trickled 

 to Indias villages yet, but the rural folk are catching 

 up with urban India in terms of deaths from heart attacks 

 and strokes.

 The first detailed analysis of deaths in a pocket of rural India has shown that chronic cardiovascular diseases have emerged the biggest killer, with coronary heart disease or stroke making up one-third of deaths, medical researchers have said.

 This is a sign of health transition in rural India ? a shift from infectious diseases to chronic cardiovascular diseases, said Dr K. Srinath Reddy, the head of cardiology at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in Delhi.

 Reddy and his colleagues in India and Australia have analysed 1,354 deaths from among a population of over 180,000 in 45 villages in east and west Godavari districts of Andhra Pradesh in 2003 and 2004.

 Heart attacks or strokes together emerged the biggest killers in this rural pocket, accounting for 32 per cent of the investigated deaths. The second leading cause of mortality was injuries on farms and rural roads, making up 14 per cent of deaths. 

 The researchers described their findings on Wednesday at a conference on mortality surveillance in developing countries.

 This study provides a snapshot of whats going on in rural India, said Bruce Neal, director of the cardiac and renal division at the George Institute for International Health in Australia, a member of the study team.

 Public health experts argue that given its limited resources and infrastructure for healthcare, India should ideally focus more on prevention rather than treatment.

 Infections account for 12 per cent of deaths in the villages, according to the study. Were not surprised, Reddy said. We suspected wed see something like this.

 Earlier studies, including projections of disease burden, have suggested that heart disease and stroke make up 40 per cent of deaths in urban India. Changes in diet and lifestyle are also pushing rural India into the cardiovascular risk zone, Reddy said.

 Doctors suspect that traditional high-fibre diets in rural India have gone out of fashion or been substituted by relatively unhealthy diets low in fibre and rich in refined sugars. We think vegetable and fruit consumption has dropped in villages because the produce is sold in the domestic or export market. Villages that dont have drinking water would have soft drinks and noodles, Reddy said.

 In subsequent phases of the study, researchers plan to identify specific risk factors that are pushing rural people towards cardiovascular diseases and launch preventive programmes to coax rural folk to adopt healthier lifestyles.

 East and west Godavari districts are relatively affluent rural zones and doctors expect that the cardiovascular disease patterns observed there might be similar to patterns in the northern grain basket zones of Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh. But such a pattern of diseases may not be reflected in poorer districts of eastern Uttar Pradesh or Bihar.

 The researchers said the Godavari study is intended to establish a model to diagnose and prevent chronic cardiovascular diseases in a small community. This model could subsequently be adopted elsewhere in the country.

 The study in Andhra Pradesh involved conducting verbal autopsies ? conversations with relatives and friends of the dead ? and analysis of the findings by independent doctors to determine the cause of death.

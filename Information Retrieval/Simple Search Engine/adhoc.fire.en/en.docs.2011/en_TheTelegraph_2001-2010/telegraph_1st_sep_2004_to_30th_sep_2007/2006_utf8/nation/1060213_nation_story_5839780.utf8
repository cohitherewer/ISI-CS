 Gohaingaon (Tinsukia), Feb. 12: After the trauma, the healing touch. 

 Eastern Command chief Lt Gen. Arvind Sharma today visited Kakopathar, the Assam town that exploded in mutiny against the army over a custody death just over a week ago, to hand a cheque for Rs 1 lakh and Rs 5,000 in cash to the victims family. However, there was no stemming the tide of protests, which spread from Tinsukia district to other areas.

 Residents of Demow, in Sivasagar district, blocked National Highway 37 in protest against Fridays police firing on protesters at Kakopathar. Movement of vehicles on the highway, which links Dibrugarh and Tinsukia districts, was stalled for over two-and-a-half hours.

 In Kakopathar, there was an uneasy calm when Lt Gen. Sharma visited the house of Ajit Mahanta, who had been picked up by the army on February 4 for allegedly working as an Ulfa linkman. The general-officer-commanding of the Eastern Command spent about 30 minutes in the familys hut.

 This was a very unfortunate thing to happen. I am shocked. This should not have taken place. We have already constituted a court of inquiry and will get the report very soon, Lt Gen. Sharma said before handing over the cheque and the cash.

 We know we have done wrong. We have not come here to compensate you by giving some money, we have come here to meet you purely on humanitarian grounds, he told Ajits mother, Sabita. 

 The army promised another Rs 1 lakh and a rehabilitation package that includes reconstruction of the familys house, adoption of Ajits two sons and a job or employment assistance to his wife. 

 Brig. A.K. Bardalai, commander of the Tezu-based 82 Mountain Brigade, translated each and every word of consolation uttered by the Eastern Command chief.

 As Lt Gen. Sharma got up to leave, his hands folded, Sabita said: Aru namaribi dei...mur Ajit gol, aru nahe. Apunasabak anurodh korisu, aru namaribi?(please do not kill anyone else, my Ajit is gone, he will not come back, I beg of you, do not kill any more).

 The general nodded and asked Brig. Bardalai to tell the family that he had lost his father when he was only nine and understood how Ajits children must be feeling.

 Lt Gen. Sharma later told The Telegraph that the army had been analysing the situation in the wake of the custody death and certain corrective measures have already been taken while conducting counter-insurgency operations. 

 In Guwahati, chief minister Tarun Gogoi announced a judicial probe into the police firing and Rs 3 lakh each for the families of all nine victims.

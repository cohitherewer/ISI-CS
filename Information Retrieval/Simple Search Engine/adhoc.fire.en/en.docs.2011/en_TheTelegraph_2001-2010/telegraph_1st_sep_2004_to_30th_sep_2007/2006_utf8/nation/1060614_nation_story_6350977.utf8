 Calcutta to let hawkers stay

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, June 13: Hawkers in Calcuttas business district can breathe easy ? the government is again set to brush under the carpet the task of removing, or even reining them in.

 Calcutta High Court had set a June 16 deadline to the government to present before it a blueprint on how it intends to deal with the hawker problem. 

 But the government held a crucial meeting today only to decide that it would seek more time from the court before presenting its plans. 

 After the meeting chaired by chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb this evening to finalise the governments response in the high court, an official said: We will tell the court that we are in the process of framing a policy on hawkers and that we need more time to finalise it. We will pray for more time before we submit it in the high court.

 City police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee, Calcutta Municipal Corporation commissioner Alapan Bandopadhyay and deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Javed Shamim were among those present at the meeting.

 The go-slow, it was apparent, was because of political considerations. This is a sensitive issue, an official said.

 Before he left for Canada yesterday, mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya had said the existence of hawkers on city roads was a reality.

 Nobody can think of Calcutta without hawkers. There are hawkers on pavements even in sparsely populated countries like New Zealand. We cannot just toss them out, he had said.

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had earlier said there should be political graffiti on walls in Calcutta because there is no such ban in London or Paris.

 On May 19, the high court directed the government, the police and the civic body to submit a report within a month stating the steps they had taken to make the roads less congested and the traffic less chaotic.

 The hawker menace is growing like cancer. It is impossible for people to walk on the roads, forget the footpaths, the division bench of Chief Justice V.S. Sirpurkar and Justice Soumitra Sen had said while hearing a petition filed by environmentalist Subhas Dutta in 2004. 

 The CMC has no clear policy on hawkers as of now and it has turned a blind eye to even the existing rules. 

 According to the rules, hawkers are supposed to be banned from 21 main thoroughfares in the city, which include Brabourne Road, Jawaharlal Nehru Road, Bidhan Sarani, APC Road, Park Street, Gariahat Road and Rash Behari Avenue. 

 However, hundreds of hawkers throng these roads till late in the evening, making it impossible for pedestrians to negotiate the pavements. 

 Hawkers on city pavements have doubled since the eviction drive, Operation Sunshine, in November 1996.

 Civic rules say that no permanent structure can come up on the pavements, something which neither the government nor the civic body has ever enforced.

 The court had also sought to know whether the national hawker policy was being followed in the state. In case hawkers are to be allowed, the government was asked how many were to be allowed, under what conditions and on which stretches?

 Civic officials said they have no answer to any of the questions.

 Trishul flip-flop

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 17: Defence minister Pranab Mukherjee said he was not pulling the plug on the Trishul surface-to-air missile project begun under A.P.J. Abdul Kalam despite the date for its scrapping being fixed for December. 

 Mukherjee and the defence ministry today scrambled to resurrect the Trishul, given up as a no-hoper by the user (read the navy) after nearly two decades of development and trials and pumping nearly Rs 300 crore into it.

 The announcement that the project was not being buried comes after ministry officials briefed reporters last evening and confirmed that the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) was asked to set the closure date for the project in December.

 The ministrys flip-flop on the Trishul has been prompted by two things. First, it has dawned belatedly on it that scrapping the Trishul weakens the CBI case against Fernandes and co as it justifies the acquisition of the Barak system, a deal in which they are alleged to have accepted bribes. Second, the DRDO and the scientific adviser to the defence minister, M. Natrajan, lobbied hard to continue the project because junking it would also mean a stoppage of funds to the organisation.

 Mukherjee confirmed that the project was to be completed by December 2006 but on the suggestion of the DRDO he had extended it by another year. Therefore, there is no question of shelving the project.

 Extending the life of the project makes it almost co-terminus with Kalams term in Rashtrapati Bhavan. His term expires in the middle of 2007.

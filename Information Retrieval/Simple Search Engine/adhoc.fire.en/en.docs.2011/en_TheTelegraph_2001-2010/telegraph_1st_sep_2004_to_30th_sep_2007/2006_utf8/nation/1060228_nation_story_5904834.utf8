 RS stick for stung member

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 27: The Rajya Sabha ethics committee has recommended expulsion of Samajwadi Party MP Sakshi Maharaj, who was caught on camera while inappropriately sanctioning funds under the MP Local Area Development programme.

 The call for his expulsion comes months after 11 other MPs involved in the cash-for-query scam were expelled.

 The ethics committee held Maharaj guilty of compromising the dignity of the House and inappropriate conduct. It, however, exonerated another MP, the Bahujan Samaj Partys Isan Singh of the charge of ethical misconduct.

 The two members were shown allegedly succumbing to inducements for sanctioning funds under the MPLAD scheme. The sting was part of Operation Chakravyuh, telecast by a news channel.

 The committee headed by Karan Singh, in its report to the Rajya Sabha today, held that Maharajs conduct amounted to violation of the Houses code of conduct for MPs.

 The facts and circumstances of the case leave no doubt that the member has not only committed gross misdemeanour, but by his conduct he has also compromised the dignity of the House and its members and has acted in a manner that is inconsistent with the standards which the House is entitled to expect of its members, the report said.

 The committee said as the members conduct had brought the House disrepute, he had forfeited his right to continue as a member. 

 The committee, therefore, recommends that he be expelled from the membership of the House.

 On the BSP MP, the committee held that he neither asked nor accepted any commission despite repeated inducements by those behind the sting operation.

 The committee recommended that his complaint against the Dedicated Investigative Guild, which conducted the sting, and the channel, be referred to the privileges committee. 

 The BSP MP has said the Dedicated Investigative Guild and the news channel had sullied his image. 

 The committee also took adverse note of the sting operators action attempting to entrap Singh. 

 It is unfortunate that telecast of the programme, which tried to wrongly project the member as corrupt, sullied his image? presented him in poor light, may damage his political career, the committee said.

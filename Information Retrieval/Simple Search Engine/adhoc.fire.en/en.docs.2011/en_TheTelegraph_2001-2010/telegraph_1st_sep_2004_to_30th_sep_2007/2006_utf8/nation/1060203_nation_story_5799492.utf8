 Mumbai (PTI): Police have filed a chargesheet against two persons accused of raping a South African model in a city hotel.

 The 27-year-old model of Indian origin was drugged and taken from a hotel in Bandra to another in Ulhasnagar on December 27 last year and raped before being dropped home the next day.

 The 200-page chargesheet, filed on Wednesday, charges Suresh Krishnani and Sunil Morpani with wrongful confinement, kidnapping a woman to seduce her, gangrape, causing hurt with a dangerous weapon, administering drugs, assaulting a woman to molest her and sale of obscene books.

 The model has gone back to her country and would come back when the trial begins, the police said.

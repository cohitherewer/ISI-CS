The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 One ally gone, four on board

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 29: The UPA may have lost an ally in the Telengana Rashtra Samiti with its five MPs, but it has found four new ones three of which were with the NDA. 

 Kerala Congress (two MPs), the Sikkim Democratic Front (one member) and S.K. Bwiswmuthiary, an Independent MP from Assam, have confirmed support to the ruling coalition to parliamentary affairs minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi. However, sources in the Lok Sabha speakers office were not sure if these parties and MPs had handed in letters of support to Somnath Chatterjee.

 Baleshwar Yadav of the National Loktantrik Congress, a breakaway group of the Samajwadi Party, has also professed his backing for the UPA, according to Das Munshi.

 The minister, hosting breakfast meetings for the UPA allies almost daily, may soon invite his new friends from the NDA. In a crunch, the coalition feels it can count on the support of Babulal Marandi, the BJP rebel who made it to the Lok Sabha as an Independent.

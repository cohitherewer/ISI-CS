The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Finger at US, UK for false alarm

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Jaswant Singh: Book blast 

 New Delhi, July 21: The US and the UK had indulged in scare-mongering by spreading stories of a nuclear conflict in the subcontinent after the attack on the Indian Parliament in 2001, Jaswant Singh has said in his latest book.

 The former foreign minister, who also held the defence and finance portfolios in the NDA government, adds in his book, A Call to Honour ? In Service of Emergent India, the two countries had grossly overstated that the conflict between India and Pakistan would go nuclear after Delhi mobilised its forces.

 He says the impression, primarily spread by the US and the UK, that South Asias first nuclear crisis was brewing was far from true as India had never considered using the nuclear option despite grave provocation. 

 The book says the two countries created unnecessary panic by issuing travel advisories asking its citizens to pull out of India by harping on the possibility of a conflict and of it going nuclear. To me, personally, this is tantamount to scare-mongering, he writes.

 This scare was incomprehensible, for a nuclear dimension just did not exist. It was so totally not on Indias cards that when the scare was first raised ? principally by the US and the UK ? I heard in this a kind of western attitudinising echoes of a long forgotten imperial past.

 Singh goes on to add: Why was this sought to be created? I have never been able to fathom why, nor why the United States took a lead in the matter. Tellingly, though, hardly any other country followed suit. They were not moved at all by these Anglo-American alarms, he said.

 The BJP leader says that under the garb of an artificial scare, Delhi was flooded with guidance and counselling to exercise restraint when there was no need of it. 

 The US evidently assessed the situation in accordance with its own historical experience, particularly of the Cold War. To them, therefore, as to the UK also, India was a fledgling nuclear weapons-possessing country, it could possibly not have the needed maturity to handle these awesome instruments of global destruction, only we in the US and UK know how to? etc, etc, he writes.

 Singh dwells on the history of the India-Pakistan conflict that had sparked similar scares. He cites Pakistan President Zia-ul Haqs secret flight to Delhi after he found his forces grossly mismatched when the Indian Army launched Operation Brass Tracks.

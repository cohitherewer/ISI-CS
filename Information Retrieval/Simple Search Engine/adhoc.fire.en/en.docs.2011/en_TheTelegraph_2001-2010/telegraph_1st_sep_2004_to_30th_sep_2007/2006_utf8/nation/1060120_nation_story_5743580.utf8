 Cricket to stay with Sahara 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Same group, new firm

 Mumbai, Jan 19: When Rahul Dravid goes out for the toss in Faisalabad on Saturday, he will be sporting a sponsorship logo on his arm that has been leveraged to promote a brand that will soon become non-existent: Air Sahara.

 Last month, the Sahara group had renewed its Team India sponsorship deal with the BCCI under the Air Sahara brand for Rs 313.80 crore.

 But Jet Airways ? which acquired Air Sahara in a $500 million deal yesterday ? plans to integrate the Sahara groups airline business under its own brand.

 Pending confirmation of regulatory approvals, the airlines will continue to operate independently. But a top Jet official said: We are planning to phase out the Air Sahara brand eventually.

 A Sahara source said: We offered to forgo the brand to Jet. The cricket sponsorship deal was made with Air Sahara and we plan to transfer it to one of our group companies. The Team India deal means a lot to us and we wont forgo it.

 Sahara is expected to transfer the cricket sponsorship to a financial services company within the group.

 The sponsorship is open for four years, from January 1, 2006, to December 31, 2009. Sahara has already paid a years bank guarantee to the BCCI.

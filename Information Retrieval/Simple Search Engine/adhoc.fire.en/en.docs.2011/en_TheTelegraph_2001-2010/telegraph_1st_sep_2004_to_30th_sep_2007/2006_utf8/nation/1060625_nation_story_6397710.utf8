 Army mulls rank error showcause

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT AND PTI

 New Delhi, June 24: Army sources in New Delhi today said that the rank of lieutenant colonel conferred on lady officer Priyamvada Mardikar was a mistake.

 The Telegraph had reported on Saturday that Mardikar, the only lady officer outside the medical corps to have been made a lieutenant colonel, has been asked by army headquarters to relinquish her rank.

 It is likely that army headquarters will ask her commanding officer to show cause.

 Such a measure does not address Mardikars grievance, nor that of other lady officers who are peeved that they are not given substantive ranks of major and above.

 Mardikar was allegedly given the rank erroneously after completing 13 years of service though the defence establishment is yet to decide if the terms and conditions on promotions for (gentlemen) officers on permanent commission are applicable to lady officers on short-service commission.

 She was ceremonially conferred the rank on International Womens Day (March 8) last year.

 Ironically, earlier this week, the army had tom-tomed that it had for the first time promoted two lady officers to the rank of lieutenant colonel. Clearly, that was a falsehood.

 The army headquarters also let it be known today that the rules governing the service conditions of lady officers have been finalised and are expected to be adopted shortly.

 Amid the spiralling controversy over alleged gender bias, the government today asked the army to look into equal pay and uniform for lady officers. It added that women could be considered for combat role if they were willing to undergo hard training.

 They will be doing very well in information technology. They are doing very well in the medical services. But we want them in other areas also. In hard areas also we want them to participate more and more depending on their willingness, defence minister Pranab Mukherjee said.

 Right now we are not putting them (in combat roles) because it is much more hazardous, but I am quite confident a day will come when they will make their contribution.

 Mukherjee said he has told the army chief to look into this, it should be equal pay and uniform for lady officers. 

 We are encouraging more and more women to participate in the armed forces and they are doing a good job. They should be encouraged not only to equal pay, equal allowances and other opportunities, but we should create an atmosphere where they feel comfortable.

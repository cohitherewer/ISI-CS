 Dons get thick, for Don Friday

 Calcutta, Oct. 17: We hope not to let you down Shah Rukh Khans SMS to Chandra Barot left the maker of the original Don choked with emotion.

 With more than 72 hours to go for Don Friday formerly Diwali Friday the chase has begun again. 

 The solarised scamper (the titles were shown on negative background) that had begun 28 years ago across Mumbais Dhobi Ghat may have reached the green-tinted Petronas Twin Towers of Malaysia but one Don is incomplete without the other.

 From Bandra to Juhu, from Mannat to Jalsa, from the old Don to the new Don, messages and calls have been flying thick and fast. As the wide world of Bollywood gets ready to compare the 1978 low-budget thriller to the glitzy 2006 remake, the Dons themselves are busy exchanging notes and pleasantries.

 As promised at the Toronto Film Festival a couple of months ago, Shah Rukh was learnt to have arranged a special screening for Amitabh Bachchan at the Yash Raj Studios in Andheri this evening. Apart from Bachchan, King Khans inner circle of Karan Johar and Farah Khan were said to be present at the screening.

 Amid growing talk that Shah Rukh and Bachchan had fallen out over screen space and time in Johars Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna, Shah Rukh has been maintaining how the old Don is no doubt better and how everyone wants to act like him (Bachchan) but one is not able to.

 Part of a remake himself Ram Gopal Varma Ki Sholay Bachchan, on his part, has been supporting remakes, encouraging fresh perspectives for old classics.

 If the stars of the two Dons have been backing each other, the directors have formed their own mutual admiration society. 

 So, Farhan, the director of the 2006 Don, has been calling Barot up to say: Chandra Uncle, I am your crazy fan. And Barot had told The Telegraph last week: I remember I felt that I had made Dil Chahta Hai. I am in total synergy with Farhans vision.

 The one-film wonder has been personally invited by Farhan to a starry screening of the film on Thursday night. But that is not the official premiere of Don, which will happen in a week or two in Malaysia, where most of the film has been shot.

 The real twist in the tale, however, can be in the original Salim-Javed storyline. The Bolly buzz is that the set-up and the climax of the new Don are completely different from the original. 

 While the cast and crew have remained behind a veil of silence, Boman Irani, who plays the role of DCP DSilva (Iftehkar in the original Don), dropped a clue: It is faithful to the original but has a sting in the tail.

 Farhan, who has been calling the film his take on the 1978 Don, says: It has the same characters and the same dilemmas but I have incorporated all the changes that have happened with the changing time.

 With the backing of Barot and Bachchan, Farhan and Shah Rukhs Don can sure emerge as the most wanted film in 11 countries and beyond.

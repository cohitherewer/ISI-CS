 Jaya lays granite path for election victory

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 The presiding deity of the Palani temple 

 Palani (Tamil Nadu), March 12: To Jayalalithaa, the path to power lies through Tamil Nadus famous Palani temple and is paved with granite.

 Ahead of the May elections, she is getting the marble floor relaid at the Dandayuthapani Swami shrine ? the states richest with an annual income of Rs 37 crore, courtesy the thousands who worship and get their heads shaved there every day.

 The marble flooring, done a few years ago for a sleeker look, is apparently an error. According to the Agama Shastras ? the ancient science of temple building ? granite alone gives the right vibrations.

 A quick correction alone, the chief minister believes, can stave off defeat in the state polls. She has her reasons to be so deeply concerned: another error had set up a previous election rout.

 Just before the May 2004 general elections, she had had a new deity of Dandayuthapani Swami ? also known as Moolavar ? made out of the traditional panchalohas (five metals) and placed it before the original, 3,000-year-old navapashana idol built by the ancient sage Bhogar. She lost at every one of the states 40 Lok Sabha constituencies.

 The old idol, made of nine minerals and herbs, is believed to impart medicinal powers to the milk-water with which it is washed every day during abishegam (ritual bath). A sip of the water later is said to cure many diseases.

 But whether because of the baths or not, the slim, four-foot figure was getting visibly thinner and disfigured by the day. Ever since the problem was noticed in the 1980s, successive state governments kept worrying if this could bring bad luck to them.

 In 1984, then chief minister M.G. Ramachandran ? a staunch believer unlike many of his predecessors at the DMK top post ? formed a Palani navapashana idol protection committee.

 The worsening of the idols condition became a big political issue, recalled Sivananda Pulipani Patra Swamigal, the only living descendant of Bhogars direct disciple Pulipani, whom the master had appointed protector of the idol.

 Jayalalithaa acted after the Kanchi Sankaracharya, Jayendra Saraswati, appealed that the idol be protected from further wear and tear. She got the idol veiled and placed the metal substitute in front of it, which became the object of worship and abhishegam.

 This was against tradition. The new idol quickly started turning black, shocking devotees, Sivananda said.

 After the election, the new idol was removed and the navapashana restored to its original status. Now Jayalalithaa wants to correct the remaining anomaly.

 An army of masons are now ripping the marble off the floor of the garba griha (sanctum sanctorum) and the walls of the artha mandapa (the hall facing the sanctum), replacing it tile by tile with granite. The consecration of the shrine has been set for April 3.

 A few other changes are being made. The entrance to the sanctum is being widened in the manner of the Tirupati temple, the cracks cemented and some pillars decorated.

 Thousands continue to flock daily to the temple ? set atop the Sivagiri Hills, 475 km from Chennai ? unmindful of the dust and noise of the round-the-clock masonry. But the deity has been placed behind a screen to protect it from the dust. Till the renovation is complete, devotees must worship an alternative deity, the utsavar, under a makeshift shed in the outer enclosure.

 Temple authorities, however, deny any link with the Assembly polls. 

 The renovation was planned long ago, a temple official said.

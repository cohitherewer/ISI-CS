 MPs to join Pak talks

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 1: The time has come for politicians from India and Pakistan to sit across the negotiating table.

 The ball will start rolling for an inter-Parliament interaction when the India-Pakistan joint parliamentary committee begins functioning in December.

 The idea of setting up the committee of parliamentarians was discussed last year and the Indian chapter was formed. Pakistan was yet to act when the Mumbai train blasts in July brought the peace process to a halt and scuttled the panel plan.

 The decision to revive the peace process on November 14 with the foreign secretary-level talks put it back on track.

 Political parties in Pakistan, particularly those in the Opposition, are keen to get the committee going. Hafiz Hussain Ahmad of the Muttahida Majlis-E-Amal (MMA), who is in Delhi, has made a strong pitch for involving politicians in the peace talks.

 Ahmad, whose party is a vocal critic of President Pervez Musharraf, said Delhi should not interact with the dictator. India should talk to the Prime Minister and not Pervez Musharraf, he said.

 Ahmad and Choudhary Manzoor of the Pakistan Peoples Party, who is accompanying him, have held discussions with leaders of several political parties in India.

 According to the MMA leader, the upcoming foreign secretary-level talks would not achieve results unless political parties are included. 

 Ahmad said parliamentary committees need to be set up to tackle various points of dispute and should be mandated to conduct peace talks. 

 The Pakistan Opposition leader, whose party is in power in the North West Frontier Province, also suggested a bigger role for India in restoring peace in Afghanistan. 

 A critic of American intervention in Afghanistan, Ahmad wondered when Hamid Karzai, the President of the war-torn country, could interact with Musharraf, why he could not involve India. 

 The MMA wants the Pakistan President to hand over power to political parties.

 Manzoor echoed Ahmad, saying India should interact with the democratic forces in Pakistan. A bad democracy is better then a good dictatorship, he added.

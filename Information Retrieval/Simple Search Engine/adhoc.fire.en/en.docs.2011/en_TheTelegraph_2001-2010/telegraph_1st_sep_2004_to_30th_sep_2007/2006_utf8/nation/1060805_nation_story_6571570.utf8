 New Delhi, Aug. 4: The Opposition today stalled Parliament over the reported revelations in the Justice R.S. Pathak committee report, blaming the government for the leak. 

 Ally Left, the Rashtriya Janata Dal, which is part of the government, and the Samajwadi Party, which does not get along with the ruling Congress but offers issue-based support, made it clear they were unhappy about the leak and demanded a probe. 

 In the Rajya Sabha, Opposition members walked into the well minutes after it met, forcing the first adjournment. When the House reassembled at noon, renewed slogan-shouting prompted chairman Bhairon Singh Shekhawat to call it a day.

 The Lok Sabha was also adjourned for a few hours by Speaker Somnath Chatterjee the BJP-led Opposition began walking into the well.

 Before that, Chatterjee had allowed a 20-minute impromptu debate on the condition that contents of the report, which has not yet been made public, would not be discussed. 

 The National Democratic Alliance, Left, the RJD and the Samajwadis demanded that the report be tabled in Parliament as soon as possible. 

 The Samajwadi Party, Telugu Desam Party and the ADMK were today contemplating bringing a privilege motion in the Rajya Sabha over the media leak.

 Chatterjee, too, put on record his disapproval of the report being made available to the media first when Parliament was in session. The government has to explain why this happened, he said.

 Parliamentary affairs minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi agreed with the sentiment but stressed that nobody from the government had leaked the report.

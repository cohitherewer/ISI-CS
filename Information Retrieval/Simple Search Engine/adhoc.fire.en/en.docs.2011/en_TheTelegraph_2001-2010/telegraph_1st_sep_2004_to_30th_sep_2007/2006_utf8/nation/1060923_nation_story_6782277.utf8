 China pushes for easy visas for business

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 22: Ahead of President Hu Jintaos visit to Delhi, China has raised the pitch by demanding a level- playing field for its companies to set up business in India.

 The Chinese ambassador in Delhi, Sun Yuxi, today said visa restrictions on business executives, which were hampering investments, should be lifted. He said there should be a level-playing field as China does not have a restrictive visa policy for the Indian business community.

 Chinese business executives have to get their visas renewed every three months for which they have to go back to Beijing. Sun allayed apprehensions that Chinese companies posed a security threat to India.

 The ambassador said there were 150 Indian companies doing business in China. But the number of Chinese companies in India was only 50. The Indian companies are taking part in around 2,000 projects in China. In contrast, India has blocked investments by Chinese companies in telecom and infrastructure projects citing security concerns.

 Indian officials said investment from China was welcome but it had to be within the framework of domestic laws and regulations. 

 The two sides will discuss the issue when Hu visits Delhi in November. Much importance is being given to the visit, which is expected to pave the way for developing strategic ties. Both the countries are working on 12 agreements that would be signed during Hus visit.

 The Chinese companies are keen on taking part in developing port infrastructure, where India is looking at an investment of more than $10 billion. The other areas of interest are steel plants and telecom.

 The Chinese officials want to end the mistrust between the two sides and point out that relations have grown in the recent years. The mistrust has its origin in the long-standing border dispute between the two countries. Officials expect to make some progress on the border talks before Hu lands in Delhi.

 The two sides are doing the groundwork for another round of meetings between the special representatives on the boundary question, said Sun.

 The resolution of the boundary question will help in ending the mistrust, said officials.

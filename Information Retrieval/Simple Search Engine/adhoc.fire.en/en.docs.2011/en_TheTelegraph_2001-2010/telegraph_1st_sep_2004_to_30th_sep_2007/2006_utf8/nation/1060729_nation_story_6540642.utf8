 Infosys price feeler to govt

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, 28 July: Infosys expects the Bengal government to offer land in the range of Rs 5 lakh to Rs 30 lakh an acre in line with what other states have offered it for setting up campuses.

 The IT company wants to invest Rs 250 crore in the project, which would sprawl on 100 acres, but the price of land in Calcutta and surrounding areas has been a stumbling block.

 The West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation has a plot near the Vedic Village resort, some 10 km from Calcutta airport, which is cheaper than land in New Town Rajarhat. But even there it is asking for no less than Rs 1.58 crore an acre. 

 In Rajarhat, land is selling at Rs 2.16 crore an acre.

 Bangalore-headquartered Infosys has set up nine campuses across India in the past four years and is keen to come to Bengal as much as the government is keen to get it here, but for the hiccups.

 We have requested the West Bengal government to look at prices that have been offered to us in other states. They range from Rs 5 lakh to Rs 30 lakh, said Kris Gopalakrishnan, the president and joint managing director of Infosys Technologies.

 We are awaiting a formal proposal from the state government regarding the project highlighting the land location, price and other such key issues?. The state government has to induce us to come here, he added.

 The two major hurdles in preparing the proposal are the price of land and a detailed map of the region, said IT minister Debesh Das.

 Discussions are on regarding the land price and we have to consider key factors like the cost of building a road through the 850-acre plot, part of which would be allocated to Infosys. The industrial development corporation also has to arrange power and water connectivity, Das said.

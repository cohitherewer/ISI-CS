 No-job fine on computer school

 New Delhi, Oct. 29 (PTI): 

 A consumer court has penalised a computer training institute 

 for failing to provide employment to three of its students.

 Holding that alluring students through misleading advertisements amounted to unfair trade practice, the Delhi State Consumer Commission directed CMS Computer Institute to pay Rs 33,000 each to the three students who had been promised jobs.

 This case should be an eye-opener and a deterrent for those institutes and any and every kind of training-imparting centre which gives out misleading and false advertisements as to the utility of their training with an assurance or guar- antee to arrange the job also, said Justice J.D. Kapoor, the president of the commission.

 The three students, who were not provided jobs by the institute, had contended that according to the advertisement, it was bound to provide placement on completion of the course.

 The commission agreed with the contention.

 The students were lured by a newspaper advertisement that said: At CMS, you are a winner anyway for you have a job on join- ing the programme or immediately after the programme.

 The commission said such advertising practices need to be curbed with a heavy hand.

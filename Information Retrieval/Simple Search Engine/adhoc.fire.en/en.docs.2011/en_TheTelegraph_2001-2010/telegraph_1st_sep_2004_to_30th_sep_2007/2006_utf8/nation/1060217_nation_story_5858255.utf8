 PM to clear air on Iran in Parliament

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Singh: Nothing secretive

 New Delhi, Feb. 16: The Prime Minister is likely to make a suo motu statement on the Iran vote in both Houses of Parliament tomorrow to try and take the wind out of the Lefts sails.

 He wants to provide factual information against the disinformation so that the parties can take their stand, parliamentary affairs minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi explained.

 Manmohan Singh will make his statement first in the Lok Sabha and then the Rajya Sabha, Das Munshi said.

 If the Left and the Opposition want a separate, structured discussion on the subject, the government will not oppose it, the minister added. But the discussion will take place after the Union budget is presented on February 28.

 Sources said the government expected the parties to air their positions in the debate on the motion of thanks on the Presidents address to both Houses of Parliament.

 Many members want to know the actual position on the Iran vote before they participate in the motion-of-thanks debate. Why deprive them of the benefit of information? a source asked.

 The Prime Minister is not expected to touch on the other thorny issue: the Indo-US nuclear pact.

 Congress sources said Singh wanted to reinforce the point that there was nothing secretive or murky about Delhis stand on Iran as the Left was insinuating.

 Some CPM leaders have used the Iran plank to justify the need for a third front in conjunction with the Samajwadi Party. The Samajwadi went a step further and threatened a no-confidence motion against the government until its leaders were persuaded against it by CPM general secretary Prakash Karat.

 At todays meeting of the business advisory committees of both Houses, the Left urged the government to put off the Prime Ministers statement and instead have a debate on Iran after the budget.

 But we were determined the PM would make it, whether the Left wanted it or not, a source said.

 While the BJP officially supported the Centres stand on Iran, the deputy leader of the party in the Rajya Sabha, Sushma Swaraj, reportedly indicated at the business advisory committee meeting that the party was not necessarily going to back it.

 You will see for yourselves whether we support the government or not, Sushma is believed to have said after CPM leader Nilotpal Basu remarked that there was no difference between the positions of the BJP and the government on Iran.

 The BJPs chief whip in the Rajya Sabha, S.S. Ahluwalia, insisted that Sushmas was an off-the-cuff comment and too much should not be read into it.

 Delhi believes India cant afford another nuclear neighbour, and is worried that Iran has ignored the terms of the Non-Proliferation Treaty despite being a signatory.

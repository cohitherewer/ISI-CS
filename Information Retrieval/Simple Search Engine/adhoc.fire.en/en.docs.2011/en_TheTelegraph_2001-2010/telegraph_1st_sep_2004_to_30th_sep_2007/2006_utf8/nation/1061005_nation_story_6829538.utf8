 Jawan in grenade smuggling net

 Jammu (PTI): An army jawan has been arrested 

 at Jammu railway station for allegedly trying to smuggle 

 a grenade.

 Manoj Kala, posted with 58 Rashtriya Rifles in Udhampur, was on his way to hometown Nashik when he was picked up, officials said. 

 During a customary X-ray check at the railway station, Government Railway Police personnel found an H-36 grenade in his bag. The GRP has informed army authorities about the incident.

 Last week, another jawan was arrested with 40 rounds of AK rifle ammunition when he was on his way home. 

 Gay rights petition modified

 New Delhi (PTI): Toning down its demand 

 for scrapping Section 377 of the IPC which prohibits unnatural 

 sex, the Naz Foundation has said the provision should not 

 be applied to homosexual activities between consenting adults.

 In a fresh affidavit to Delhi High Court, the NGO, spearheading the cause of legalising homosexuality, said it was not asking for the provision to be scrapped but advocating that consenting homosexual activities should not be considered a crime.

 However, B.P. Singhal, a former MP, has moved a fresh petition, saying that legalising homosexuality would erode the countrys cultural traditions, ethos and spiritual values.

 The petition said that if the NGOs argument was to be applied, brothels, child labour, drug trafficking and other such activities should be permitted in the country.

 Temple threat

 Amritsar (PTI): The Shiromani Gurdwara 

 Prabandhak Committee has received a letter threatening to 

 blow up the Golden Temple and the Vaishno Devi and Raghunath 

 temples in Kashmir. 

 The letter, signed by one Karim Ansari of the Lashkar-e-Toiba, also threatened to blow up the Amritsar and Jammu stations. 

 Salem interview

 Mumbai: The anti-terror court trying 

 the Bombay blasts case has expressed displeasure about an 

 interview of Abu Salem filmed on a spycam on the court premises 

 and beamed by a TV channel. The Arthur Road jail head has 

 filed a complaint and submitted a CD of the interview. 

 Lankan killer

 Dubai (PTI): A Dubai court has sentenced 

 a Sri Lankan to 15 years in jail for killing an Indian after 

 a fight over a teenage girl. He will serve an additional 

 six months for having an illicit relationship with the girl.

A phone call claiming that a bomb would go off 

 in a suburban Chennai school led to evacuation of students 

 on Wednesday morning. The call was later found to be a hoax.

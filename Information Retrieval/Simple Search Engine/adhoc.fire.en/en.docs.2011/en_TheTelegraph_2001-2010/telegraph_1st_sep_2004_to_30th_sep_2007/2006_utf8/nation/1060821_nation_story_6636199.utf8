 Bureaucrat appraisal policy

 New Delhi (PTI): The government plans 

 to introduce from next year changes in writing the annual 

 confidential reports of bureaucrats, which will be assessed 

 by a referral board rather than an individual.

 The move follows recommendations submitted in 2003 by an expert group headed by former UPSC chairman Lt Gen. Surinder Nath and upheld by the second administrative reforms commission.

 The changes, being prepared by the department of personnel and training, will pertain to health check-ups, numerical grading, integrity certificate and maintenance of personnel dossiers.

 Under the new plan, each official in consultation with his superior will prepare a work plan for the year, setting out key tasks and specific deliverables in qualitative and quantitative terms, the officials said.

 The officers performance will be subject to a mid-year review with reference to the work plan and the report written by the superior officer.

 The accident also left 14 injured. Most of the victims were from Chennai.

 New Delhi, Feb. 2: Confusion 

 and chaos reigned at Delhi airport for the second day as 

 employees of the Airports Authority of India continued their 

 agitation against the privatisation of Delhi and Mumbai 

 airports.

 Passengers, crew members and even VIPs had a difficult time as they had to walk along the long airport road with their luggage to reach the departure terminal of the domestic airport.

 All roads leading to the terminal were blocked as the AAI employees converged, raising slogans against Congress chief Sonia Gandhi and civil aviation minister Praful Patel. The protesters also burned Patils effigy.

 Former Chhattisgarh chief minister and Lok Sabha member Ajit Jogi also had a tough time as they refused to make way for his car heading towards the departure terminal.

 Former BJP president M. Venkaiah Naidu also found himself in a similar situation, though both leaders did manage to reach the airport on time to catch their flights.

 Passengers were clearly unhappy. One does not hire a taxi to the airport and then walk 2 km to catch a flight, said G. M. Rather, a Srinagar resident who was to take a Chennai flight. Other passengers echoed his feelings. There are no trolleys. Actually, the trolleys have become meaningless because we have to pull the luggage from a far-away area, said Ramesh Patel, a businessman from Mumbai. 

 Crew members, too, had trouble reaching the airport. Usually, crew members report at least an hour and a half before the scheduled departure. Today, because of the traffic bottlenecks, they reached much later, making the preparatory work a rushed affair, said an official of a private airline. 

 Fire in Palam

 A fire broke out at the domestic terminal this evening. It was reported around 10 pm in the retiring room at the 1-B terminal, officials said. Four fire tenders were sent to the spot.

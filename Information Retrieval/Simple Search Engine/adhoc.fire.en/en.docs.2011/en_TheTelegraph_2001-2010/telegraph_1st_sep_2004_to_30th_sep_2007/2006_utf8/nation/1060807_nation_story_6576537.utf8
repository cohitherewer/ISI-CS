 Hindujas home in on trophy royal property

 then, Srichand now?

 The controversial Hinduja brothers are in talks to buy one of citys most prestigious buildings from the Queen.

 The Sunday Telegraph understands that Srichand and Gopichand Hinduja, the Indian billionaires who were embroiled in the cash-for-passports scandal that led to Peter Mandelsons second resignation from the Cabinet, have made an offer of about 60 million for the Crown Estates opulent former head office in Carlton House Terrace, near Buckingham Palace.

 The Crown Estate, which has a 6 billion property portfolio managed for the Queen by a board she appoints with the prime minister, moved out of the sumptuous John Nash building and into purpose-built offices in Mayfair this year.

 Roger Bright, the Crown Estates chief executive, is understood to have discussed the possible sale of numbers 13-16 Carlton House Terrace with Kash Chandarana, a senior negotiator for the Hindujas, who already own properties in the terrace. Both Bright and Chandarana were on holiday this weekend and unavailable for comment, but a spokesperson for the Hinduja brothers said: It is the sort of property they would be interested in.

 The sale could be highly contentious as the businessmen plan to convert the 19th-century building, which overlooks The Mall and St Jamess Park and was commissioned by King George IV, into exclusive flats.

 A spokesperson for the Crown Estate said: We have received offers on the property but no deal has been completed yet. It is an exceptional property and we hope it can return to residential use at some stage. There is a presumption that residential, rather than office use, would be the preferred option for the property.

 The property has had a number of distinguished residents, including William Gladstone, the reforming Victorian prime minister.

 The Hindujas came to prominence in 1998 after they offered to support the Millennium Dome, for which Mandelson then had ministerial responsibility. Eight years earlier they had had their first application for British citizenship turned down.

 The brothers offered to underwrite the 6 million costs of the Greenwich exhibitions Faith Zone, but, after discussions with Lord Levy, Tony Blairs chief fund-raiser, they agreed to donate 1 million instead. In 1997, Gopichand Hindujas second passport application was successful. 

 In 1999, Srichand Hinduja also became a British citizen. Two years later, Mandelson resigned as Northern Ireland Secretary over a disputed telephone call with the office of Mike Brien, the then immigration minister, about Srichands passport application.

 The Hindujas were also involved in controversy over the Bofors arms scandal, which led to the election defeat of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in 1989.

 Last year, they and their brother, Prakash, were cleared by an appeal court of accepting 4.6 million in illegal commissions to help to secure government contract for A.B. Bofors, a Swedish arms manufacturer.

 Their business empire, which employs 30,000 people in 25 countries, includes Amas Bank (Switzerland), IndusInd Bank, Ashok Leyland, which makes buses and other commercial vehicles, Gulf Oil, Ennore Foundries and media and technology companies.

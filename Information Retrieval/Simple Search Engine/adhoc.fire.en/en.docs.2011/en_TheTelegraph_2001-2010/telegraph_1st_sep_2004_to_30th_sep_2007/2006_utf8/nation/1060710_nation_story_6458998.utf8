NATION BRIEFS

 Amritsar, July 9 (PTI): Over 180 people watching a film had a miraculous escape when a fire broke out at Aanam theatre here today.

 The blaze damaged the screen and gutted the furniture, but no one was injured, the fire de-partment said. The audience rushed out of the hall as they sensed the fire. A probe had been ordered and the screening of films at the cinema has been stopped.

 Krishnagar: A 40- year-old farmer was shot dead in his sleep at a village in Bengals Nadia district, 190 km from Calcutta, on Saturday night. Police said Joydeb Ghosh, an affluent farmer, was sharing a bed with son Kaushik, 14, when the miscreants shot him through a window. Dacoits had broken into Ghoshs house two days ago and he apparently recognised some of them.

 Bethuadahari: Sadhana Mondal, 20, set herself on fire on Saturday after she was beaten up by her gambler husband in front of his associates here in Nadia, 130 km from Calcutta. Police said Kamal, a grocer, had lost all his savings. Sadhana went to his gambling den on Saturday after she found no food at home for her five-year-old daughter Bulbuli.

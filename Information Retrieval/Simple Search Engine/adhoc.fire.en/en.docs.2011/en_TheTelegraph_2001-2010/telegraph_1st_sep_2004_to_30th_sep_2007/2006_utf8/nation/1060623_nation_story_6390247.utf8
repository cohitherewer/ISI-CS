 Peace push to Colombo

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 22: Delhi today asked Colombo to speed up the process of resolving its ethnic problem by addressing legitimate expectations of all sections of Sri Lankan society while maintaining its territorial integrity.

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh conveyed the message to Sri Lankan foreign minister Mangala Samaraweera who visited Delhi on his way back from Oslo, Norway, amid fears of war breaking out in the island nation.

 Colombo assured India it would continue to respect the ceasefire with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam despite grave provocations.

 Samaraweera said his government would firmly protect the security of its people and the country. 

 He told Singh that the all-party conference in Colombo had decided to appoint a multi-ethnic committee of experts to develop legal provisions for a political settlement of the Tamil question based on maximum devolution of power in an undivided Sri Lanka. 

 He also briefed the Indian leadership on the development work in the troubled north and east.

 Profit heat on Centre

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 27: The Centre today faced Opposition heat in the office-of-profit controversy with the BJP warning it not to dilute the constitutional provisions on the subject and Sonia Gandhi again being dragged into the row.

 The Telugu Desam and Samajwadi Party suggested the Congress chief had been let off lightly by the Election Commission in comparison with Jaya Bachchan.

 They cited how the complaint against Sonia was closed after her resignation while Bachchan faced retrospective action, her Rajya Sabha membership derecognised with effect from day one together with her entire contribution to its proceedings.

 The BJPs warning came with an accusation that the government was not revealing even its tentative views on the subject while asking others to declare theirs.

 The Centre, in an effort to sew up a consensus before the budget session resumes on May 10, had written to the parties asking if they wanted the present law amended or a new one passed.

 In his reply, BJP leader Jaswant Singh said it would be difficult for him to provide specific inputs unless the Centre first revealed its mind.

 It would be difficult for me to agree to any dilution of this (the constitutional provisions) or other related provisions of the Constitution, whether in letter or in spirit, Singh said. 

 He added that his party had always believed that the Parliament (Prevention of Disqualification) Act, 1959, was born out of Article 102 of the Constitution.

 It is only against that litmus paper test that we can, or ought to, examine all the various other questions that you have raised: amendments versus new comprehensive legislation; prospective or retrospective, etc.

 The Telugu Desam and the Samajwadi Party accused the poll panel of double standards. But deputy election commissioner R. Bhattacharya said the commission had considered every angle before deciding to close the case against Sonia.

 Notice to CPM MP

 The commission today issued a notice to the CPMs Bangsagopal Chowdhury following a complaint by Trinamul leader Mukul Roy. The Trinamul wants the MP ousted from Parliament because he holds the chairmanship of the Asansol-Durgapur Development Authority as well.

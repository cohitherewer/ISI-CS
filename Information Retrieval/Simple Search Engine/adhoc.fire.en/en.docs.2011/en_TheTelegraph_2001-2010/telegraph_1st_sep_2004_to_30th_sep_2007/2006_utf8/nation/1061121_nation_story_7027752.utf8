 Saddam noose tightens around students

 Kalyani (Nadia), Nov. 20: As the clock inched towards 5 pm, Biswajit Dass knees started knocking.

 Black hood pulled over his face, the Class XI student of Kalyani College was playing Saddam Hussein at a mock gallows, full with a noose around his neck. He had been standing on one side of the dais since the CPM meeting began at 2 pm.

 So by the time the 1,000-strong crowd at the meeting on Kalyani Station Road, about 45 km from Calcutta, turned to welcome state CPM secretary Biman Bose, the 17-year-olds legs couldnt hold him up any more.

 Minutes later, as Bose took the dais, Biswajit started swaying. Manoj Banerjee, the 15-year-old student of Kalyani Government School who was playing the judge, saw him tottering and rushed forward to help. Immediately, Biswajits hood was yanked off. Gasping for breath, he was carried off the stage to a room behind the dais.

 Worried CPM volunteers who today graduated to tormenting children from crippling commuters with a rally in Calcutta last week, all for Saddam raced in with jugs and began sprinkling water on his face.

 Were you up there on the dais without any food? a volunteer asked.

 Slowly, Biswajit regained composure. Smiling wryly, he said: After an hour or so, I found it difficult to breathe. It was not easy to perform as Saddam. It really made me ill. Dadas in our area told me I would be performing in front of Biman Bose and might be rewarded if the performance was good.

 With Biswajit gone, the dadas couldnt sit tight. A new Saddam would have to be found, as the show would have to go on.

 So, a Class IX student of Kalyani Government School, Soumen Biswas, was called in to take his place on the gallows. Thirty minutes, and Soumens knees were knocking, too.

 Noticing that Soumen was in bad shape, the 20-year-old playing the hangman rushed to steady him. Soon after, both walked off the dais, only to be joined by the judge who suddenly felt a pain in his legs.

 Bose, meanwhile, was spitting fire and venom in his tirade against George Bush.

 Oh, I will never try this again. The hood was suffocating me, said Soumen, feeling better after washing his face.

 Please dont ask me anything. I am very tired and will probably need medicine.

 A little later, the CPM volunteers put Biswajit, Soumen and Manoj on an auto-rickshaw and packed them off home.

 They may have fallen ill. But they put up a tremendous performance, a volunteer said.

 By this time, Bose had turned his attention to Mamata Banerjees agitation against land acquisition for the Tata Motors small car unit in Singur. 

 Who knows farmers interests better than us? he said. We have decided to create job opportunities for farmers who will lose land. Arrangements have been made at Belur to impart vocational training to them.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Left seeks and gets Tehran massage

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 6: Nobody thought India was out to topple the regime in Iran. But the Left wont rest easy until the assurance comes from the Prime Ministers mouth.

 Manmohan Singh obliged the Left today, declaring in Parliament that India was not part of any international effort to change regimes in the region.

 The clarification came after the Left stepped up the heat on the Centre and accused it of failing to reply to US President George W. Bushs call from Indian soil for a regime change in Iran.

 The issue also served to indicate that the US Presidents visit had widened the gulf between the UPA and the Left on foreign policy.

 In his Purana Qila speech, Bush had said: In Iran, a proud people is held hostage by a small clerical elite that denies basic liberties, sponsors terrorism and pursues nuclear weapons. Our nations must not pretend that the people of these countries prefer their own enslavement. We must stand with reformers and dissidents and civil society organisations and hasten the day when the people of these nations can determine their own future and choose their own leaders.

 The clarification over, the CPM picked on the nuclear deal to keep up its attack on foreign policy.

 The CPM believes this is contrary to the common minimum programme. It will work assiduously to see that this course is reversed as it is harmful for the country and the peoples interests, the party central committee said in a statement.

 The Prime Minister will make a statement in Parliament tomorrow on the nuclear deal.

 Singh, who was replying to the debate on Indias vote against Iran at the International Atomic Energy Agency, stressed that India advocated diplomacy rather than confrontation to resolve the Iran conflict. 

 He told the Rajya Sabha he had discussed the issue with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Saturday night.

 Our emphasis, as well as sincere desire, is that the matter should be resolved without any coercive methods. Diplomacy must be given adequate space. He added that Putin shared these views.

 Confrontation is not in the interest of either our country or the Gulf region, Singh added. He said Indias foreign policy was guided by national interest.

 But the CPM was unconvinced. 

 The overall direction of the joint statement is a further step away from an independent foreign policy. It marks an erosion in Ind-ias strategic autonomy which is vital to our national interest.

 Tortured Indian maid in help cry

Dubai (PTI): An Indian maid has appealed for rescue from 

her employer in Bahrain, who she claimed had refused her food and clothes for 

five months.

 I am not given a decent meal even once a day or proper clothing and I have to use the clothes that I pick from the garbage bins in the locality, she said in a letter to the Bahrain Keraleeya Samajam.

 In her letter sent through a neighbours housemaid, the Keralite woman has pleaded to be sent back to India. 

Madhu Madhavan, general secretary of the organisation for expatriate 

Keralites, said: She had sent an audio tape to her family in India describing 

all the hardships and torture that she was undergoing. In response her family 

sent five telegrams to her employer, asking to send her back.

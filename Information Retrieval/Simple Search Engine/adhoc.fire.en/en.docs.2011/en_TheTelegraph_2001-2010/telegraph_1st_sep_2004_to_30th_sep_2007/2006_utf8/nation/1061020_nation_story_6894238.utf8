 MiG 27 crash in Bengal

 OUR BUREAU

 Oct. 19: A MiG 27 fighter jet of the Indian Air Force crashed into a paddy and brinjal field in north Bengal this morning. 

 The pilot, Wing Commander K.D. Singh, bailed out and was said to be safe but for minor injuries. Two villagers also suffered injuries as they tried to take cover. 

 The aircraft, on a routine training flight, crashed in Uttar Majidkhana village 36 km east of the Hashimara air base at 10.17 am after taking off a few minutes earlier. The village is located 17 km from Alipurduar town. 

 Two fire engines from Alipurduar took two hours to bring the blaze under control. Around five domestic animals were killed in the crash.

 The air force spokesman in New Delhi, Wing Commander Mahesh Upasani, said: The aircraft was on a routine training mission. An inquiry has been ordered.

 Sources at the Hashimara base put the crash down to a mechanical snag. 

 The MiG 27 suddenly developed a mechanical problem and Singh was forced to bail out. His parachute landed 2 km from the crash site, said Squadron Leader Santosh Babu. We have recovered the black box.

 The air force has six MiG 27 squadrons. Squadron no. 22, nicknamed the Swifts, is based in Hashimara.

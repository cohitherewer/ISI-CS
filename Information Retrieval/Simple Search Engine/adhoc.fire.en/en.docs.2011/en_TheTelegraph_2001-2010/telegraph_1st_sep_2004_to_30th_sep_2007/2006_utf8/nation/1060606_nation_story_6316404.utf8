Panel on Muslims gets extension

New Delhi (PTI): The government has extended 

by four months the term of the Rajindar Sachar high-level committee set up to 

look into the social, economic and educational status of the Muslim community 

in the country.

 The committee has been given time up to October 31 to submit its report. The term of the committee, chaired by Justice Sachar, was to end on June 8.

 Justice Sachar said he had sought more time to collect information from the states, some of which were taking long to respond.

 He said there would be no preliminary or interim reports and the final one would be presented to the government by October 31. The extension has been sought as he did not want to give a half-baked report, Justice Sachar said. I will not be asking for any further extension.

 Post office push for passport 

Bangalore (PTI): The ministry of external affairs 

is working with the department of posts to increase the number of speed post centres 

where passport applications are accepted by nearly 300 in three months.

There are 218 such centres in the country where passport 

applications are accepted.

 We are working with the department of posts to increase the number of such centres to 500 by August 2006, Union minister of state for external affairs E. Ahamed said.

 Noting that the total number of passports issued by the regional passport office here in 2005 was approximately two lakh, he said there has been an increase in demand for passports because of the citys growth as an IT destination.

 Seed price

Hyderabad (PTI): The Supreme Court has declined 

to stay an Andhra Pradesh government order directing biotech major Monsanto to 

sell its genetically modified Bt cotton seed at not more than Rs 750.

Either the court or the trade practices commission 

would decide who should pay the additional amount, if any, it added.

Bail blow to cop

New Delhi (PTI): The Supreme Court has dismissed 

a petition by deputy superintendent of police Ashraf Mir, allegedly involved in 

a sex scandal in Jammu and Kashmir. The petition had challenged a high court order 

refusing to allow anticipatory or regular bail by a subordinate court.

Jaya portrait

Chennai (PTI): ADMK MLA K. Pandurangan and 

44 others were detained after they entered the government hospital premises at 

Vellore demanding that an erased portrait of Jayalalithaa be redrawn.

 The Haryana government is considering a proposal to ban manufacture of coloured plastic bags in the state as a part of steps being taken to keep the environment free of pollution.

 Ranchi team

 Ranchi, Oct. 12: Jharkhand chief minister Madhu Koda today appointed two deputy chief ministers and allocated the portfolios keeping 19 with himself after more than three weeks of haggling.

 But the government seemed headed for another crisis as several heavyweight cabinet members openly expressed discontent at being denied useful berths. 

 The decision to have two deputy chief ministers, Stephen Marandi and Sudhir Mahto, pleased neither.

 Koda, who has had to walk a tightrope on allocation of portfolios, turned up with the list at Raj Bhavan this evening. This followed oblique hints to the squabbling ministers that any further delay in distributing portfolios might lead to the imposition of Presidents rule.

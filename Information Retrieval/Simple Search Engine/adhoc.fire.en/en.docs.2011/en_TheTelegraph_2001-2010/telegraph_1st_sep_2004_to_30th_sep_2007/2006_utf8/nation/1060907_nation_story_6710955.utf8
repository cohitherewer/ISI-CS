 Disaster looms for diabetic India

 Sydney, Sept. 6 (AP): Skyrocketing rates of childhood obesity and type 2 diabetes in Asian countries like India and Pakistan are an economic and social disaster that could affect regional stability, leading health experts warned today.

 Asia currently has around two-thirds of the worlds type 2 diabetics or around 90 million people, according to Paul Zimmet, chairman of the international obesity task force.

 Four out of five of the worlds most diabetic populations are also in Asia including India, China, Pakistan and Japan and the number of diabetics in Asia is set to increase to 120 million by 2010, said Zimmet, citing recent data from the World Health Organisation.

 By 2025, the number of Asians with diabetes could increase to 198 million, he said.

 The rate of childhood obesity among Asian children is increasing by about 1 per cent each year, roughly the same rate as in Australia, the US and Britain, according to the task forces regional director, Tim Gill. Its a social and economic disaster, said Zimmet.

 While many Asian countries are busy gearing up to deal with the possible threat of bird flu, Zimmet said, they are ignoring a looming health crisis caused by diabetes.

 Most Asian countries dont have the health care systems to meet the cost of treating diabetes and related illnesses, such as strokes, kidney failure, heart disease and blindness, he said.

 Beyond the rise of health care, Zimmet warned, the epidemic could have dire consequences for the social and economic stability of many Asian countries.

 Munda: For profit shield

 Ranchi, March 22: Far away from the din in Delhi, the BJP-led government in Jharkhand today decided to rush through a legislation listing posts which will not be deemed offices of profit.

 A cabinet decision to this effect was taken late this evening, capping a day of hectic activity by the Opposition which sought disqualification of as many as four NDA legislators from the Assembly.

 The cabinet secretary informed that a new legislation, Jharkhand Legislators (Prevention of Disqualification) Bill, will be presented before the Assembly to replace a similar Bihar Act of 1950 vintage.

 The Opposition has targeted three BJP legislators ? Chatruram Mahto, Karia Munda and Saryu Roy ? and a Janata Dal (United) MLA, Kheeru Mahto, who, they argued, could no longer be members of the Assembly for holding different offices of profit under Article 191 of the Constitution.

 The Oppositions prime target is Chatruram Mahto, the BJPs legislator from Gomia, who contested the Assembly elections last year while holding the post of chairman of the state agriculture marketing board, enjoying the rank of a minister of state.

 Anybody holding a post of profit has to resign before contesting elections, but the legislator has admitted he was chairperson of the board while fighting the polls.

 The Opposition, however, spared chief minister Arjun Munda, who is chairman of the Tenughat Vidyut Nigam Limited, a state-run corporation. Munda has said he does not enjoy any benefit from the corporation. 

 Barring the Gomia MLA, all others, and even Munda, were notified as chairpersons after being elected. Roy, the BJP legislator from Jamshedpur West, is vice-chairperson of the state planning board. Karia Munda, the MLA from Khijri, is vice-chairperson of the 20-point programme implementation committee while Kheeru Mahto, the Dal (U) legislator from Mandu, is chairperson of the mines board. 

 In his defence, Chatruram Mahto said he had orally tendered his resignation to the chief minister before contesting the polls, but it was not accepted. I had stopped taking travel and dearness allowance after the election was notified. I stopped drawing salary from the board after I started getting salary from the Assembly.

 Legal experts cite the example of JMM chief Shibu Soren, who had to relinquish his Rajya Sabha seat (from Bihar) after it was established that he held a post of profit as chairperson of the Jharkhand Area Autonomous Council while contesting the elections in the nineties.

 Undeterred by the ruckus in Parliament, the UPA-led Opposition continued to press for disqualification, both in the Assembly and outside. 

 The Opposition tried to move an adjournment motion in the Assembly, a move which was disallowed by Speaker Inder Singh Namdhari, who advised the MLAs to consult experts and petition appropriate authority, indicating the Election Commission.

 In the evening, a UPA delegation called on Governor Syed Sibtey Razi and demanded the disqualification of the four NDA legislators allegedly holding offices of profit.

 Parents back for teens killer

 AMIT ROY

 London, Feb. 10: The parents of murdered British schoolgirl, Hannah Foster, are flying to India this weekend to expedite the extradition of the man wanted for questioning for her rape and killing.

 In India, Maninder Pal Singh Kohli, who was recognised and arrested in July 2004, is fighting the extradition to the UK. He has apparently retracted an earlier confession.

 Hannahs parents, Trevor and Hilary Foster, from Southampton, will be accompanied on their trip by detective superintendent Alan Betts, who has been leading the inquiry into the death of the 17-year-old A-Level student.

 She was abducted and killed following a night out with friends in Southampton on March 14, 2003. Her body was found beside a road at West End, near Southampton, two days after she disappeared.

 Kohli, father of two children, went missing shortly after the body was found. He was picked up in India after Hannahs parents visited the country and made a personal appeal. Shortly afterwards, Hannahs mother was diagnosed with cancer and has been receiving treatment.

 It does not speak well of the speed of the Indian justice system that the Fosters are having to fly to India again.

 It has often been the case that Indians and Pakistanis have committed serious crimes in the UK and fled to India and Pakistan in the belief that once there, they would be out of the reach of British law. 

 The extradition law between India and the UK was brought in at the behest of the Indians in an effort to bring back Sikh militants from Britain to India. Britain has no extradition law with Pakistan, a source of worry to the British because of the alleged role that madarsas have played in the London bombings in July last year.

 A Hampshire police spokeswoman said: Mr and Mrs Foster hope their trip will once again focus attention on the case and at the same time give them the opportunity to meet the legal teams involved in the proceedings against Maninder Pal Singh Kohli who was arrested on suspicion of the murder in July 2004.

 It is said that Hannahs parents have become increasingly frustrated about the lack of progress to return Kohli to the UK to face trial and hope the trip will help the process.

 A warrant for the arrest of Kohli on suspicion of the abduction, rape and murder of Hannah was obtained from Southampton Magistrates Court in 2003 and faxed to the authorities in India.

 The spokeswoman added: We are anxious to have Mr Kohli back in the UK so that his trial can proceed as soon as possible.

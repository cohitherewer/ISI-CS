 Jaya melts Natwar

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 7: If you are 74, a man of letters who counted E.M. Forster as a friend, spent a lifetime in foreign service, had royal antecedents rooted in caste that counts for a lot in Rajasthan and boast of the ultimate cachet of being a Nehru-Gandhi loyalist, what do you do when you are consigned to the dustbin of history? Fret, fume or rebel? Natwar Singh is doing a bit of everything.

 For the last nine months, he was in the doghouse. The Congress ignored him despite his fulminations and occasional threats to tell it all. But the Kunwar from Bharatpur decided he would not keep quiet once the Pathak report was out. Sonia Gandhi or no Sonia Gandhi, Manmohan Singh or no Manmohan Singh.

 So when the Rajya Sabha met this morning for its first sitting after the former foreign minister moved a breach of privilege motion against the Prime Minister for allegedly leaking the Pathak committee report, it was palpable that the Congresss nerves were stretched. Dressed in his trademark white kurta-pyjama, Natwar took his seat in the front row, next to his lone well-wisher in the party, Arjun Singh.

 Before the House began, petroleum minister Murli Deora came up to him and said something that obviously made Natwar furious. He gestured his index finger towards the left row customarily occupied by the Prime Minister. Congress sources surmised Deora was asked to persuade him to withdraw his motion. 

 When the House met for the second time after an adjournment, Natwar took his seat and seemed more determined to speak. His demeanour said it all. He greeted members like Motilal Vora, Ahmed Patel and Janardhan Dwivedi with a cold namaste and glared at others like V. Narayanaswamy who matched the Oppositions decibel level when Natwar got up to speak but couldnt.

 Sharad Pawar gestured towards Natwar to remain seated but he kept leaping as the BJP and the Samajwadi Party egged him on with slogans like Natwar Singh ko bolne do, Sonia ki pol kholne do (Let Natwar speak and spill the beans on Sonia).

 The House was adjourned again and Natwar shifted from the treasury benches to the Opposition where he was in a huddle with his new friends Amar Singh, Digvijay Singh and Sitaram Yechury.

 Later, they moved to the central hall where Jaya Bachchan joined them. It seems no Congress member went anywhere close to them after word got around of how Natwar refused to take parliamentary affairs minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshis phone calls on Sunday. One of the younger and flamboyant Rajya Sabha MPs valiantly went up to him and asked him to kiss and make up with the Congress. But Natwar ignored him.

 Jaya recalled how external affairs officials in New York were shocked when the Volcker report mentioned Natwar. She said she was in the US at that time and they told her a person of Natwars integrity and stature was incapable of getting involved in scams.

 Gone was the grimness on his face. He was all smiles when Jaya told him he should pen his memoirs fast and call it Gunahon ka Devta (the angel of evil). The irony in her suggestion was lost on her and Amar, and of course, Natwar.

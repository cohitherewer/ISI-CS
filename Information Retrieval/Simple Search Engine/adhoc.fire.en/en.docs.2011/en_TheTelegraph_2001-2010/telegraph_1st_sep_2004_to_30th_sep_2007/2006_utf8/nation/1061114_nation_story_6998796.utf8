 Pranab Mukherjee

 New Delhi, Nov. 13: Foreign affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee and finance minister P. Chidambaram today told an audience of international arms transfer experts that India has liberalised norms for investment in defence industry and was formulating reforms that would make investment easier.

 Mukherjee, who was defence minister before being given the foreign portfolio last month, called for greater involvement of the private sector in defence production. 

 Inaugurating a three-day International Seminar on Defence Finance and Economics, he said a system of checks and balances should be made a part of the defence expenditure norms that govern huge outlays.

 The defence allocations for the current year were about Rs 81,000 crore and India was last fortnight rated in a US Congressional research service study as one of the big spenders in defence. But the defence allocations were still below the global norm of 2.5 per cent of gross domestic product.

 Babloo nurses wedding dreams 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, June 14: Last October he was ruing his unfulfilled desire of killing Dawood Ibrahim in his book Adhura Khwab (Unattained Dream).

 Eight months later, richer by Rs 9 lakh from royalties, former Dawood aide Babloo Srivastava (in picture above) is anxious not to lose his second dream ? marriage.

 In jail since his extradition from Singapore in August 1995, the 42-year-old gangster today said he was set to marry a fellow student from his Lucknow University days in the mid-80s.

 I wont tell you her name; but I plan to marry her soon, possibly in July. I have applied for parole, Babloo told The Telegraph on his way to the additional sessions court, Lucknow, in connection with one of the four cases pending against him.

 Dressed in an off-white shirt, he looked relaxed as he puffed on his India Kings surrounded by a cordon of nine policemen. She used to study with me. She is from Lucknow, is a postgraduate and is employed now. Thats all I can reveal, he said.

 Babloo, the son of a college principal, and the woman were just friends then. They lost touch after he joined Dawoods gang and left for Dubai.

 But late last year, after she happened to read Babloos book, she visited him at Bareilly jail. And love bloomed.

 Once they decided to marry, the families gave their consent. It will be an inter-caste marriage, Babloos lawyer Ram Ugrah Shukla said.

 One of the gangsters former associates declared: It will be a huge wedding. We expect at least 10,000 guests. Of course, Babloos old comrades will also come.

 Babloo had received parole to attend his sisters wedding in Lucknow last year. He hopes he would be a free man by July, when the verdicts are expected in the four cases in connection with which he was extradited.

 Babloo, facing charges of conspiracy in all four, is confident he would be acquitted in each. Even if he is convicted, he expects to be freed because he has already spent 11 years in jail.

 If I am released in July, I wont be needing parole, he said. But I cant take chances.

 The Supreme Court rejected his plea for parole yesterday but said he could apply again in Delhi High Court. So my advocate will now take it up there.

 Babloo had been don Chhota Rajans right-hand man since they parted ways with Dawood after the 1993 Mumbai riots. He complains that though the deal with Singapore was that he would be tried in four cases ? he was wanted for 22 ? the government tried him in eight. He has already been acquitted in four.

 I have asked for compensation from the Government of India (for the alleged breach of agreement), he said.

 What will he do after marriage? The answer is no surprise: he wants to be a politician.

 Babloo plans to contest next years Assembly polls from Allahabad, having lost from Sitapur in 2002.

 But he knows he would constantly be looking over his shoulder. The fear of attack (by Dawoods hitmen) is always there, he admitted.

 Even his mentor Chhota Rajan is thinking of shifting base from Malaysia to Japan for the same reason.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Yikes! To London amp; back for just Rs 10,000

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 2: Now 

 you can hop to London and back at a fare cheaper than a 

 flight from Calcutta to Delhi.

 Air Sahara, which plans to debut on the Delhi-London route from January 14, has said it will sell 2,006 Delhi-London return tickets for as low as Rs 10,000 on a first-come first-serve basis.

 This will be the cheapest fare from New Delhi to London being offered by any airline, Air Sahara president Ronojoy Dutta told newspersons today. 

 The limited tickets, up for grabs from tomorrow, would be available only on the website, www.airsahara.net, and would be valid for a year from the date of purchase.

 Initially, Sahara will fly four times a week to London but from March it would start daily flights, Dutta said.

 Rival Jet Airways, officially had no comments on Saharas fare strategy, but sources in the private airline did say that it would be difficult to respond as we are all operating below costs on these routes. 

 Air-India, however, dismissed any speculation of a rate war. Dont read too much into these promo offers. They are offering (around) 2,000 cheap tickets for the whole year and we take 1,000 passengers daily to London. This is just a gimmick, no match for us, one airline spokesperson said.

 Earlier, Air Sahara had announced another low-economy basket of Rs 17,999 for a Delhi-London round trip. 

 Travel trade analysts said British Midlands, which flies to Mumbai, could be a threat to the wannabe low-cost carriers. 

 Also, Air-Indias low-cost version, the AI Express, is yet to launch and will certainly trouble these two competitors once it kicks off, said Debasish Chatterjee of CTI Travels. 

 Air-India charges Rs 26,000 for a round trip, while British Airways refuses to go below the Rs 30,000 mark. But even then, these fares are low compared to peak season rates that go up to Rs 58,000. 

 The catch in the low-fare offers is that the airline offers limited seats, normally between 5 and 10 per cent on a flight.

 There are baskets above that price which range up to the full fare and passengers, depending on how early they buy tickets, can get a seat in one or the other basket.

 There are other disadvantages, too. The seats are usually at the end of the aircraft. It is also difficult to change journey dates on these tickets.

 Still the big deal with low fares is that it gets people who would never (otherwise) catch a flight to say London think of travelling.? All in all, it helps expand the market, Chatterjee said.

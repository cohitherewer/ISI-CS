 Fatigue in Bangalore 

 OUR BUREAU

 Feb. 1: Karnataka chief minister-designate H.D. Kumaraswamy skipped a meeting called by the BJP in New Delhi today, fuelling speculation that all was not well with the fledgling coalition.

 The BJP and the Kumaraswamy-led Janata Dal (Secular) are all set to form the next government in the state.

 Kumaraswamy told reporters in Bangalore that he could not make it to the meeting as he was very tired. I have been travelling for many days now. I was too tired to go and have asked for another date. 

 Kumaraswamy and his breakaway group have been on the move ever since they decided to align with the BJP. After chief minister Dharam Singh resigned, Kumaraswamy has been on a whirlwind tour of religious places in Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka.

 The Delhi meeting was called to iron out hurdles before ministry formation. The two parties had announced that only the chief minister and his deputy from the BJP, B.S. Yediyurappa, would be sworn in on February 3.

 Kumaraswamys fatigue embarrassed central BJP leaders who had announced his Delhi visit with much fanfare yesterday.

 However, BJP leader Venkaiah Naidu said there was nothing to worry about the fate of the alliance. He wants to seek the blessings of his father before he takes oath as chief minister. Who are we to interfere in the father-son relationship?

 HC notice

 Karnataka High Court issued notices to Speaker Krishna and 38 Dal (S) MLAs on a petition challenging his decision to recognise Kumaraswamy as the partys House leader.

 Justice Ajit J. Gunjal also referred the matter to a division bench. Three politicians had filed the petition challenging the Speakers decision.

 - Bill to ask private players to fulfil public service obligations

 ASHWANI TALWAR

 New Delhi, July 6: The new broadcast bill that could be introduced in the monsoon session is set on making private, commercially-run channels realise their public service obligations like Doordarshan does.

 All broadcasters could be asked to ensure that 10 per cent of their programme and advertisement content every week is for public service and is socially relevant.

 In the event of war, Doordarshan could be asked by the Centre to take over the functioning of a private channel.

 The proposed Broadcasting Services Regulation Act also enables the Centre to ask foreign channels to produce a certain percentage ? the draft bill puts a 15 per cent ceiling ? of their programmes in India. 

 But what happens if a channel broadcast from overseas cannot or does not follow the public service obligation? 

 The draft offers a way out: a tax of sorts on the channels that shirk. 

 In the event of failure to comply with the public service obligation, every content broadcasting service provider shall be liable to pay such amount as may be prescribed by the central government towards its public service obligation, the draft bill says.

 The draft bill provides for a Public Service Broadcasting Obligation Fund for financing production of programmes and messages on socially relevant themes, like AIDS, environment and womens rights, for private channels to carry.

 The bill, also meant to set up a seven-member Broadcasting Regulatory Authority of India, is now doing the rounds among cabinet members. 

 Some public service obligations mentioned in the bill already figure in government guidelines issued in recent years, like compulsory sharing of live footage of sports events of national importance with Doordarshan and mandatory transmission of select DD channels by cable operators.

 Although the Centre would have the power to commandeer a private channel under Emergency laws in the event of war, the proposed bill spells things out.

 It says in the event of war or a natural calamity of national magnitude, the Centre may, in public interest, take over the control and management of any of the broadcasting services, suspend its operations or entrust the public service broadcaster to manage it. 

 Another allows the government to put a lid on any channel if it carries content deemed prejudicial to friendly relations with a foreign country, public order, communal harmony or security of the state. Similar provisions figure in the programme code under the decade-old Cable Television Network Regulation Act.

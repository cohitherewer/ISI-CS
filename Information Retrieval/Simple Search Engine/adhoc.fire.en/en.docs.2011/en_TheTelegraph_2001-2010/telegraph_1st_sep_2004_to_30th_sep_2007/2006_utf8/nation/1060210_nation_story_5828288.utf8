 No choice in transfer, rules HC

 New Delhi, Feb. 9 (PTI): A government employee holding a transferable job cannot insist on being retained at the place of his original posting or a location of choice, Delhi High Court has ruled.

 Transfer being an exigency of service, government and PSU employees cannot oppose the same on any unreasonable ground, a division bench of Chief Justice Markandeya B. Katju and Justice Madan B. Lokur said.

 Appellant B.D. Sharma, working as a medical representative with the public sector company Hindustan Antibiotics Limited at Delhi, was re-designated as senior technician (production) and transferred to the head office at Pimpri, Pune.

 Terming the move arbitrary and illegal, Sharma filed a petition before a single-judge bench. The plea was dismissed, following which he appealed.

 The court upheld the order of the single judge who had ruled that an employee could not claim the right to be retained at any particular place of their choice.

 Sharma contended that he was recruited as a medical representative and was not trained for production.

 In its counter-affidavit, Hindustan Antibiotics justified the move on the ground that the transfers were part of the companys redeployment strategy after it was declared a sick unit by the Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction.

 The company submitted that such redeployment and transfers were inevitable. It also said Sharma and several other redeployed staff were being given special training in production. 

 The bench felt that the sick company could have easily dispensed with Sharmas service, but instead it took a humanitarian approach and offered him alternative employment by providing the necessary training.

 Ladakh staff shift for riots

 Jammu, Feb. 16: Ladakhs all-local government staff will have to pay a price for the recent communal clashes. After winter, half of them must switch postings with non-Ladakhis from elsewhere in Jammu and Kashmir.

 Leh and Kargil towns had erupted last week with Shia and Buddhist mobs taking on each other following reports of the Quran having been desecrated in Leh.

 What irritated the state government is that it never got a clear idea about the cause of the clashes and if there was a conspiracy behind it. The local officials versions were coloured by communal sentiments and there were hardly any independent observers.

 Apart from the deputy commissioners and superintendents of police in the regions two districts, Kargil and Leh, all other staff are Ladakhis ? Buddhists or Shias.

 The monopoly of the local officials and employees in government services in Leh and Kargil has to be broken so that the region feels it is part of the state, a senior state official said. 

 The outlines of the plan for staff exchange have been discussed with two ministers, Rigzin Zora from Leh and Haji Nissar Ali from Kargil. They have been told they must help facilitate the transfers, as the exclusiveness of the region is not a healthy sign for the state.

 The exercise of identifying the employees to be transferred outside the region and their replacements is in progress. The formal orders may be issued by the end of March.

 Ladakh has been insulated from the way the rest of the state is governed as both its districts have autonomous hill councils.

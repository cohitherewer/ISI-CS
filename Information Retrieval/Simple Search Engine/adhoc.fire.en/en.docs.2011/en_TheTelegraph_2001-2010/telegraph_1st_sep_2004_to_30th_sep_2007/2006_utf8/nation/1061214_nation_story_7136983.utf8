 Last legal gamble for Afzal 

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 13: Mohammad Afzal has moved a curative petition in the Supreme Court challenging his sentence.

 This is the last legal recourse after a review petition in the apex court available to a convict. The Supreme Court had ruled in 2002 that one could approach it for a third time to cure a gross miscarriage of justice. 

 But such a petition can be filed only if a designated senior advocate gives a certificate that the judgment was in violation of a settled law.

 In his petition, Afzal contends that a competent lawyer didnt defend him. He has cited a 1980 Supreme Court ruling that said a person had a fundamental right to get competent legal representation at the expense of the state.

 None of the lawyers he suggested was appointed by the trial court, Afzal said, adding that it appointed a lawyer on its own after two of those he recommended expressed inability to appear for him.

 Cop summons

 New Delhi, April 27: A court today summoned deputy commissioner of police, New Delhi district, Anand Mohan after a complaint was filed alleging that excessive force was used against doctors and students protesting against the proposed reservation for Other Backward Classes in educational institutions.

 Additional chief metropolitan magistrate Kamini Lau has asked Mohan to appear in the court tomorrow.

 Advocate Manoj Sharma had filed a complaint alleging extreme brutality by the police on demonstrating medical students yesterday. 

 He said excessive police force has often been used as a political instrument to suppress constitutional and fundamental rights. Sharma argued that freedom of peaceful demonstration was a fundamental right that cannot be curtailed by the use of force.

 The court has also sought information from the DCP regarding the number of demonstrators arrested yesterday and their present condition. 

 Pointing to media reports, the petitioner alleged that some police officials had misbehaved with women.

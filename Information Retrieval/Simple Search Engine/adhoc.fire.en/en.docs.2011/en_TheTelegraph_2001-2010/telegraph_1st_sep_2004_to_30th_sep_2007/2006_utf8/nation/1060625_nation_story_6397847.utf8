 Ire over actress singes Krrish

Bhopal: In a rare show, the Congress and the 

BJP joined hands on Saturday to disrupt the screening of Krrish in Indore 

theatres, accusing actress Priyanka Chopra of having links with gangster Chhota 

Shakeel, reports our special correspondent.

Priyanka, who plays the lead in the thriller, is in 

a running feud with her former secretary Prakash Jaju, a resident of Mhow near 

Indore.

 Weeks before Krrish was released, Jaju had warned that his supporters and friends in the Congress and the BJP would give a befitting reception to the movie.

But on Saturday he denied having anything to do with the protesters 

and said: The protest is a public manifestation of the outrage against the 

growing cult of the underworld in Bollywood.

Indore Youth Congress president Devendra Singh Yadav said: We 

want Priyankas underworld connections to be exposed and Jajus money 

paid.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Transparent land deals

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, June 9: The Bengal government today began the delicate exercise of working out a process of acquiring land in a way that is transparent and farmer-friendly. 

 Around 40,000 acres would be taken over in seven districts in the next six months for industry, but Writers Buildings cannot afford to ruffle the farmers. 

 The takeover is inevitable for the sake of industries and infrastructure. But we will try our best to make it transparent and farmer- friendly, land and land reforms department commissioner Sukumar Das said today. It will be land acquisition with a human face.

 The government has already worked out a detailed compensation package for those to be displaced.

 Land and land reforms minister Abdur Rezzak Mollah and officials of his department held a meeting today on how best to explain the formula to the farmers and convince them they are being given a fair deal. 

 To begin with, public hearings would be held in the villages to settle disputes over the compensation being offered and to know the farmers views. The farmers would be provided with information on land records and previous sales to help them make a self-assessment of the value of their land.

 In case a farmer claims a higher amount, he would have to produce evidence ? like the instance of a recent sale in the area at a higher price ? to back his claim. 

 We would like to make it 

 a mutually agreed settlement as far as possible and to avoid 

 litigation, Das said. We would like to make 

 this a do-it-now process in tune with the motto of the government.

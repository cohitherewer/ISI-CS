 New Delhi, April 18: Delhi High Court today granted bail to prime accused Manu Sharma and seven others in the Jessica Lal murder case.

 The division bench headed by Justice Manmohan Sarin heard the appeal filed by Delhi police against the acquittal of the accused in the murder. 

 Apart from Manu, the son of Congress leader and former Union minister Vinod Sharma, the other accused were Vikas Yadav, son of former MP D.P. Yadav, Tony Gill, Alok Khanna, S.S. Sharma, Yograj Singh, Vikas Gill, H. Chopra and Raja Chopra. 

 Manu was asked to furnish a personal bond of Rs 1 lakh and a surety of equal amount, while the seven others will have to furnish personal bonds of Rs 50,000 each.

 Jessica, a model, was working as a celebrity barmaid at socialite Bina Ramanis Tamarind Court Caf? in south Delhi when she was shot at from point blank range on April 30, 1999, for refusing to serve a drink around 2 am.

 Seven of the nine accused were present in court today. Vikas Yadav and Vikas Gill did not turn up.

 Delhi police standing counsel Mukta Gupta told the court Gill was absconding and could not be traced after the high court issued summons and bailable warrants. 

 The court has now issued a non-bailable warrant against him.

 Yadav, on the other hand, is in Tihar jail. He is the prime accused in the Nitish Katara murder case. 

 Refusing to appear in court today, Yadav moved an application from Tihar seeking permission that his lawyer be allowed to represent him. He cited harassment by mediapersons at the instance of Neelam Katara, Nitishs mother. 

 Yadav had allegedly killed Nitish in February 2002 because he got to friendly with his sister Bharti.

 The division bench today granted four weeks to the prosecution to make arrangements for translating all the documents in connection with the Jessica case into English.

 Madan fells the wrong one

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 23: When he set out to settle scores with powerful Samajwadi Party member Jaya Bachchan after losing a Rajya Sabha seat to her, Madan Mohan Shukla ? a little known Congressman from Kanpur ? had no idea that his action would trigger one of the biggest political controversies of recent years, forcing his own leader Sonia Gandhi to resign from the Lok Sabha.

 It all started after Madans nomination for the Rajya Sabha was cancelled last year.

 Madan, an advocate by profession, had tried his luck at entering Parliament when he contested the 2004 general elections from Billour constituency in Kanpur.

 After losing, he saw a ray of hope when the Congress named him a candidate for the upper House. But his candidature was rejected and some high-profile people from the Samajwadi Partys list, including Anil Ambani, Lalit Suri and Jaya, were elected unopposed.

 Madan, advised by his lawyer S.S. Shukla, moved the Lucknow bench of Allahabad High Court challenging Jayas candidature.

 He raised an objection saying she held an office of profit in the Uttar Pradesh administration.

 Jaya resigned from the post in the state film council only to be re-appointed after the election.

 This time, Madan got hold of a copy of the appointment letter and filed a petition seeking her disqualification to President A.P.J Abdul Kalam, who referred it to the Election Commission. The rest is history.

 While Madan, who is camping in Delhi, could not be traced, his counsel said that at no stage was the Congress or 10 Janpath involved in the petition. I advised Madan Mohan to send a petition to the President, he said.

 Madan contested his case on the basis of two precedents. He said Shibu Soren was disqualified for holding an office of profit and Mohan Ranga, who was the Tamil Nadu governments representative in Delhi in 1982 while being an MP, was also disqualified.

 The case challenging Jayas candidature is still going on in Allahabad High Court, Madans counsel said.

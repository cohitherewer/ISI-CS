 Tough talk, blast before PM visit

 New Delhi/ Srinagar, May 23: The Centre said there will be no talks on the sidelines of the Prime Ministers roundtable conference that begins tomorrow, as another suicide attacker struck in Kashmir, ramming a car packed with explosives into a Border Security Force (BSF) bus and injuring 26 occupants.

 Four of the injured are seriously hurt in the attack near Srinagar airport, where Manmohan Singh will land tomorrow for the two-day talks.

 With the Hurriyat and other separatist groups staying away from the roundtable and Delhi not having a specific agenda, the mainstream parties Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and National Conference are likely to rule the roost, pushing their respective demands for self-rule and more federal autonomy. 

 Although invitations were sent out to 48 people, following the boycott by the separatists, the Centre is expecting about 30-odd to attend. 

 Taking off from what it said at the last roundtable in Delhi on February 25, the PDP will seek more confidence-building measures, like a drastic cut in the armed forces and more economic powers for the state, besides a forward movement towards self-rule.

 Homecoming of militants from across the border, handover of internal security to police and recruitment of a huge number of policemen, repeal of the Armed Forces Special Powers Act and opening existing bus routes between India and Pakistan for trade are some of the other demands it is expected to raise. 

 There are 2,000 people waiting across the border to give up arms and lead a normal life. They are willing to go to jail also. We want the Centre to help them come back to their homes, said a senior PDP leader.

 He added that the party, which is part of the ruling coalition in Kashmir, also wants the Centre to hand over major hydel power projects to the state. 

 Jammu and Kashmir, which is so rich in water resources, has suffered a lot because of Centre being the controlling authority. We will ask the Centre to acknowledge the losses the state has had to bear till now and to compensate for them, the leader said. 

 The National Conference, which is in the Opposition, is also likely to speak up for youths who had crossed the border for arms training and are stuck in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. 

 At a rally in Anantnag last week, party president Omar Abdullah had said the National Conference was pushing for restoration of autonomy to the state with full responsibility as restoration of peace is subservient to the former.

 Peace looked distant once again with a suicide bomber in a car targeting the BSF jawans on their way to the paramilitary camp at Humhama on the outskirts of Srinagar. The militant died in the explosion that blew his Maruti to bits, police said. 

 It was a lethal strike aimed at the specific target, a senior police officer said. The BSF bus was extensively damaged in the bombing. 

 Residents were rattled by the attack, which comes after Sundays strike on a Congress rally that killed five. 

 I thought for a moment that my house was going to collapse as our windows and doors rattled because of the explosion impact. My wife, who was making food for the family, fainted and we had a tough time bringing her back to senses, said Showkat Ahmad, 48, a businessman living in the upscale Peerbagh locality.

 Irfan, 29, was entering his Peerbagh house when the explosion occurred. I stumbled and hit my forehead with the floor as I thought something hit me from behind.

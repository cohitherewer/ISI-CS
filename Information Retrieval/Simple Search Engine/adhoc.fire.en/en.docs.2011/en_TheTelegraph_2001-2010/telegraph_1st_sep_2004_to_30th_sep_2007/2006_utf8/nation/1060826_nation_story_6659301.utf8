 Patwardhan wins Holy war in court

 Patwardhan: Show on

 New Delhi, Aug. 25: After a legal battle lasting about 10 years, documentary film-maker Anand Patwardhan can telecast his Father, Son and Holy War on the national network.

 A Supreme Court bench headed by Justice A.R. Lakshmanan, which had a special screening arranged by Doordarshan on July 20, said the public broadcaster had cited flimsy excuses not to beam the award-winning film on religious violence that Patwardhan had submitted in 1995.

 The film in its entirety has a serious message to convey and is relevant in the present context, it said today.

 In our opinion, the respondent (Patwardhan) has a right to convey his perception on oppression of women, flawed understanding of manhood and evils of communal violence through the documentary film produced by him, the court said.

 Dismissing an appeal by Doordarshan against a Bombay High Court order directing the telecast of the film, the court asked the channel to air it within eight weeks.

 Reprimanding the broadcaster for finding flimsy excuses time and again not to telecast Patwardhans film, the court said: This in our view is highly irrational and is a blatant violation of the right guaranteed under Article 19 (1) (a) of the Constitution (fundamental right to speech and expression).

 The judges said this was not the first time Doordarshan had displayed a sad reluctance in beaming award-winning films. They pointed out that it had refused to telecast In Memory of Friends on the fight for communal harmony in Punjab and Ram ke Naam (In The Name of Ram) on the Ayodhya crisis.

 Patwardhan had moved court after the public broadcaster refused to telecast his film, which had won several national and international awards. Doordarshan said the film had some explicit scenes and speeches that could excite religious passion.

 The film-maker first approached Bombay High Court, which ruled in his favour in 2001. Doordarshan then filed an appeal in the apex court, which directed it to reconsider its decision.

 But Doordarshan rejected the film after reconsideration. Patwardhan filed a new petition in Bombay High Court which again ruled in his favour in 2003, taking Prasar Bharti back to the apex court.

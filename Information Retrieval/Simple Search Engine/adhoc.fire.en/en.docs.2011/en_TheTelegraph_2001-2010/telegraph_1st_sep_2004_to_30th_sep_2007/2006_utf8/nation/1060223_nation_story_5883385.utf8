 Jawans spill cricket blood

 MUKHTAR AHMAD

 Srinagar, Feb. 22: Three boys and a young man were allegedly gunned down by soldiers as they played cricket in the village of Dudipora, 87 km from here in north Kashmirs Kupwara district, late this afternoon.

 The Kashmir inspector-general of police, K. Rajendra, however, claimed the four were killed in a crossfire between Rashtriya Rifles troops and militants hiding in the village.

 Other police sources said the victims ? aged between 10 and 20 ? were in the middle of their game when the troops arrived and ordered one of the group to accompany them. Apparently, all four panicked and tried to run away, prompting the soldiers to fire from their automatic weapons.

 Eyewitnesses and the police sources said two of the group died instantly while the other two succumbed to their injuries on the way to hospital.

 The victims have been identified as Abdul Samad Mir (20), Amir Hajam (12), Ghulam Hassan Bhat (16) and Shabir Ahmad (10).

 Rajendra confirmed that the victims were unarmed civilians. He added that the troops were trying to throw a cordon around Dudipora after being tipped off about the presence of militants in the village.

 Militants hiding in Dudipora village opened fire on the troops, which was returned. In the crossfire the four youths were killed, Rajendra told The Telegraph.

 An anguished Ghulam Nabi Azad, the chief minister, said a magisterial inquiry has been ordered.

 Hundreds of people had gathered at the scene this evening and were protesting against the security forces, shouting anti-India slogans.

 Senior police and security force officers, who arrived at the site to ascertain the facts, were advising the villagers to bury the dead, but the crowd had carried the bodies to a school building and was squatting around them.

 Azad said the circumstances in which these killings took place demand a thorough inquiry.

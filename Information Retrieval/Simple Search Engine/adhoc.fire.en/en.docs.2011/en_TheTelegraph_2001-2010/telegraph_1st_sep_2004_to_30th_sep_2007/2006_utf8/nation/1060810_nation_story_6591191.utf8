 Left piles heat on Reliance

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 9: The CPM is nudging the Centre for an inquiry into the charge that Reliance was the biggest beneficiary in the Iraq oil-for-food programme.

 In a statement issued today, the CPM politburo said: A special investigation should be carried out into the oil transactions and surcharges paid by the biggest (non-contractual) Indian beneficiary the Reliance company. 

 Since the Volcker controversy broke, Left parties have been demanding a probe. I raised the issue in the Rajya Sabha and the finance minister promised the matter would be looked into, CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury had said yesterday. 

 Now that the Congress has suspended Natwar Singh from the party over the oil scam, the Left cry has become louder. 

 The politburo reminded the Centre that the Pathak panel report has dealt with two of the four beneficiaries of oil contracts listed by the Volcker committee. The fourth Reliance company appears in three oil contracts (M/ 09/35, M/10/17, M/11/ 25), amounting to a total of 19 million barrels as a non-contractual beneficiary, it said.

 The BJP, too, came under attack. The silence of the BJP on this issue is illuminating. It was during the BJP-led governments tenure that the allotments to Reliance were made, the CPM said.

 The CPM drew attention to the fact that the Pathak report mentions that Natwar was allotted 4 million barrels of oil, of which 2 million were lifted. According to the Volcker report, the Reliance company lifted 15.78 million barrels.

 The role of Reliance should not be confused with the exports to Iraq by over 125 Indian companies under the oil-for-food programme, the politburo said. They had paid the taxes levied by the Iraqi government and these transactions were recorded and legal.

 Last Saturday, Reliance Industries had said it has always followed national and international laws and norms in all its dealings.

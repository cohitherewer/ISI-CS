The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Bangla flights

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 22: Bangladeshs sole private airline GMG Airlines will fly four times a week to Delhi as well as launch a Sylhet-Guwahati daily service, taking advantage of a plan to allow private carriers of South Asian nations greater freedom over each others skies. 

 It also wants to launch a thrice-a-day service between Dhaka and Calcutta, but awaits a bilateral pact to do so. 

 GMG chairman Shahab Sattar told The Telegraph: We will be flying to Delhi within the next quarter with a Boeing 737-300 .... We are also in talks trying to convince the Indian government to lift the cap on flights between Dhaka and Calcutta. If we can do that, then we want to fly thrice daily between Dhaka and Calcutta.

 GMG hopes to be allowed to fly to other Indian cities .

 Dhaka has already cleared Sahara Airlines and Jet Airs plans to link Calcutta with Dhaka through a daily Boeing-737 flight, but these flights are yet to take off.

 GMG, which went into domestic operation in 1998, is the only Bangla airline other than the state-run Biman Bangladesh, which flies to India.

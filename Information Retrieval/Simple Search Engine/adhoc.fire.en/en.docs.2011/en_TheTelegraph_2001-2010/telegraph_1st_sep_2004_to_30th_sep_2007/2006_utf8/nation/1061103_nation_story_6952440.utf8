 New Delhi, Nov. 2: Delhi today breathed a collective sigh of relief as the government held out hope that the sealing drive would not resume till Monday.

 A meeting of the group of ministers headed by home minister Shivraj Patil decided that the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) would again approach the Supreme Court tomorrow to explain the problems in carrying out the operation in an environment fraught with tension.

 The apex court had earlier made it clear that the sealing of illegal commercial establishment in the capitals residential areas must start today.

 We hope the MCDs plea is considered favourably, urban development minister S. Jaipal Reddy said.

 The MCD will also bring to the courts notice that two major Sikh festivals fall over the weekend, making it difficult to carry out the sealing of premises, Reddy said.

 Earlier in the day, attempts to stave off the operation seemed to have fallen through with the apex court turning down a Delhi government plea to stay the sealing of 48,000 commercial establishments. The government argued in favour of traders who have filed an affidavit before the Supreme Court declaring that they would stop using their properties illegally.

 The court told the Delhi government that it would hear its plea on Monday.

 Funds flow to Sangh outfits

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Step towards Welfare 

 New Delhi, July 23: The 

 RSS has ample reason to be more than happy with the UPA.

 The ministry of tribal affairs 

 has been constantly funding and supporting hardcore RSS 

 groups over the last three years. These organisations were 

 included as voluntary groups and NGOs to promote educational 

 and cultural development in tribal areas during the NDA 

 regime. The change of guard at the Centre has neither dried 

 up the RSSs funding by the government nor is there 

 any proposal to withdraw funds in future.

 The 10 RSS-affiliated organisations 

 that make their appearance in the ministrys records 

 are:

 Vidya Bharati

 Sewa Bharati

 Deendayal Research Institute, New Delhi

 Akhil Bharatiya Vanvasi Kalyan Ashram

 Bharat Sewashram Sangh

 Rashtriya Sewa Samiti, Andhra Pradesh

 Vivekanand Girijan Kalyan Kendra, Karnataka

 Bharatiya Adim Jati Sewak Sangh and its associated organisations

 Akhil Bharatiya Dayanand Sewashram Sangh, Delhi

 DAV managing committee, New Delhi

 The names of these groups are 

 frequently mentioned in the state-wise list of organisations 

 funded during the last three years in schemes that promote 

 educational and vocational training 

 in tribal areas.

 In some cases, such as Sewa Bharati 

 in Bhopal, funds have been cut to some extent. Sewa Bharati 

 received Rs 67,500 from the ministry in 2002-03. However, 

 in 2004-05, the funding was cut to almost half ? Rs 37,7305.

 However, there seems to be no 

 proposal to scrap the funding altogether. In fact, in its 

 official reaction to the ministry mentioning the Sangh-affiliated 

 organisations in its annual report, the RSS claims that 

 the ministry has kept them in a special category 

 to grant relaxations while providing funds next year.

 Howsoever the UPA government 

 and its coalition partners, especially the leftists oppose 

 the RSS, the government had to laud the service activities 

 being rendered by various RSS-associated organisations in 

 different parts of the country. The ministry has kept them 

 in special category to grant relaxations while providing 

 grant for the next year.

 Minister of tribal affairs P. 

 R. Kyndiah was not available for comment.

 The ministry is working on four 

 major schemes with the participation of voluntary organisations. 

 They include grants to the organisations working for the 

 welfare of the tribals, literacy campaigns among tribal 

 women, running of vocational training centres and development 

 of various tribal communities.

 The ministry implements 

 its welfare schemes for all-round development of vanvasis 

 with the help of voluntary organisations. The ministry 

 has identified 14 organisations which produced remarkable 

 results through better implementation of its various schemes, 

 said the RSS in a written statement.

 The RSS claimed that the ministry 

 had lauded the Sangh-affiliated organisations for having 

 done a good job in implementing government schemes. 

 The ministry said these 

 organisations would be encouraged to implement development 

 schemes in the coming years, the RSS said.

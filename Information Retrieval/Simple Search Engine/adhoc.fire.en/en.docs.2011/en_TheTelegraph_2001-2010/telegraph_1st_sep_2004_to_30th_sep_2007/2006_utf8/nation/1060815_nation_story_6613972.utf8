The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 IT holiday struggle

 JOHN MARY

 Thiruvananthapuram, Aug. 14: This Independence Day has thrown up an unusual question: if the infotech industry is free to work on August 15, dont the employees enjoy the liberty to take a celebratory break?

 In the first round, the companies appear to have lost out, at least in Kerala, one of the states that views information technology as the answer to its perennial unemployment problem.

 A labour officer in the state has warned companies against forcing employees to work on national holidays. 

 Seven companies, two of them BPO firms that need to work round the clock to meet client requirements abroad, at the state government-owned Infopark at Kochi had proposed to work, though with truncated manpower, tomorrow. 

 But the Ernakulam district labour officer, under whose jurisdiction the park falls, has issued the warning, citing provisions of the Kerala Industrial Establishments and National Festival Holidays Act.

 Collector A.P. Mohammed Haneesh, who received complaints from employees reluctant to slog on Independence Day, directed the labour officer, Vincent Alex, to conduct an inquiry.

 The officers visit to Infopark this morning had its effect. Affiliated Computer Services (ACS), which offers several real-time services to US clientele, backed off and declared a holiday.

 But some 200-odd employees will be working tomorrow and they will be eligible for double wages plus a compensatory offday within one week for working on a national holiday.

 Collector Haneesh said national honour should outweigh commercial considerations. Granted BPO firms have a problem, but while calculating manhours, they should factor in national holidays.

 ACS has a problem only with its Kochi operations. Its 2,850 employees will be working at its Bangalore facility tomorrow.

 In Calcutta, many software companies have declared a holiday but several outsourcing firms will stay open.

 The sector has not been brought under the Essential Services Act. But that doesnt imply one can resort to discretionary shutdowns on celebratory patriotic occasions, an industry representative in Kerala said.

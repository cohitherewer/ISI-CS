 Nuke talks falter

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 8: A team from the International Atomic Energy Agency today held extensive talks with officials to work out a plan for opening up civilian nuclear facilities in India for global inspection.

 The talks remained inconclusive and the two sides will meet again to firm up the safeguards agreement as required under the Indo-US deal to allow civilian nuclear trade with India. The plan incorporates application of safeguards to nuclear material and facilities of Indias civilian nuclear programme.

 According to the separation plan presented by India, 14 civilian nuclear reactors will be open for international inspection. While accepting the plan, the US had agreed to supply nuclear fuel to India and ask other nuclear nations to follow suit.

 The dialogue with the IAEA officials is being closely watched as it comes after two key US Congressional committees marked the bills seeking amendments to the Atomic Energy Act 1954, which will allow nuclear trade with India.

 Washington is formulating the final legislation that will be drafted after merging the separate bills presented in the House of Representatives and the Senate. 

 There is a strong lobby in the US that wants India to first sign a safeguards agreement before the bill is introduced before Congress. But India does not want the two issues to be interdependent. Delhi is also disturbed by a clause in the bill that asks for signing a separate safeguards agreement with Washington.

 Sangh gets a salute

 Mulayam: Eye on BJP turf?

 Lucknow, June 26: Mulayam Singh Yadav today invoked the horrors of the Emergency to attack the Congress and try to make inroads into the BJPs political space ahead of the 2007 Assembly polls.

 At a function to mark 31 years of the Emergency, the Uttar Pradesh chief minister honoured scores of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh activists who had been jailed during the period, promising to accord these soldiers of democracy a status on a par with freedom fighters.

 Some 2,000 former Emergency detainees, including about 250 Sangh activists, turned up at Rabindra Bhavan to hear Mulayam announce a monthly pension of Rs 500 and free trips in government buses. 

 Sitanath Mishra, a former Sangh worker from Barabanki, said: At least he (Mulayam) has kept the promise of honouring those who had gone to jail during the Emergency. The BJP-ruled governments never did this.

 Mulayam had invited Janata Dal (United) leader George Fernandes to the function, perhaps to remind voters of his socialist roots at a time his party is being identified to an extent with industrialists and filmstars.

 The Samajwadi Party chief recalled that on June 27, 1975 ? the day after Indira Gandhi had proclaimed the Emergency ? he was detained in Etawah jail with eight others. Of them, two are surviving.

 Mulayam warned his audience that the way power was being concentrated in the hands of one person in Delhi, he feared a return to those dark hours of history. 

 He didnt mention Sonia Gandhi by name but railed at the ruling alliances daman chakra (cycle of repression).

 The Congress was quick to seize the chance offered by the presence of Fernandes, a Nationalist Democratic Front leader, and Sangh activists at the function.

 The felicitation programme for the soldiers of democracy turned out to be one for a public eulogy to the RSS and the NDA. After this, no one should have any doubt about where Mulayam Singh Yadavs heart lies, said state Congress spokesman Akhilesh Pratap Singh.

 We invited the RSS leaders who were jailed during the Emergency. There can be no discrimination in this. We called everyone. We believe in democracy, explained programme convener Ravidas Mehrotra, who had joined the Samajwadi Party from the BJPs youth wing.

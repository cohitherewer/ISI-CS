The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Mumbai, switch off AC or roast

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Feb. 12: The city of neons has been asked to choose the ceiling fan over the air-conditioner and the kitchen pan over the electric toaster if it wants to avoid getting fried by power cuts.

 Shielded so far from the power crunch in the rest of the state, Mumbaikars were told on Friday evening to cut down electricity consumption by 20 per cent.

 The Centre, however, provided some relief by announcing on Sunday it would provide 100 mw power to the state, whose shortfall is 4,000 mw, from the unallocated quota.

 Union power minister Sushil Kumar Shinde also announced that unit II of the Dabhol Power Project would be made functional by May 1 this year, supplying 700 mw.

 Till then, the Maximum City must learn to get by on a minimum of electricity. The instruction came from the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission, which has hinted at penalties if households, businesses and factories fail to comply.

 The commission, which routed the ultimatum through the power utilities, will issue a public appeal next week and follow it up by conducting public hearings.

 State power minister Dilip Walse-Patil of the Nationalist Congress Party, too, met his bureaucrats and officials of private and public power companies on Friday to discuss the looming crisis and ask for suggestions to battle it.

 Though the rest of the state, facing a 4,200 mw shortage, has been groaning under long power cuts, Mumbai has so far escaped the heat thanks to the supply from private companies. The likes of Tata Power and Reliance Energy have generated enough power to match the citys demand of 2,500 mw.

 Though the government maintains that load-shedding is not an immediate possibility, the city is worried. In neighbouring Thane, where the state electricity board provides power, residents put up with two-and-a-half hours to four hours of power cuts every day.

 The Shiv Sena-BJP has seized its chance. State BJP president Nitin Gadkari has predicted that in the next seven to eight months, Mumbai could face up to 10 hours of load-shedding, and the rural areas, 20 hours.

 No, I am not joking or trying to be an alarmist. The MSEB is facing a huge shortage, and during the summer peak, it will have to turn to Tata Power and Reliance for additional power. If it does, load-shedding in Mumbai is a certainty, Gadkari said.

 The Opposition combines leaders met Governor S.M. Krishna on Friday to protest against the governments failure in tackling the shortage and farmer suicides. The BJP staged a jail bharo on the issue last week.

 In April 2005, the state government had signed a pact for 12,500 mw of power with eight private companies: Reliance Energy, Tata Power, Essar Power, Jindal, Ispat, Cipco Power, GMR and Spectrum. The projects are yet to take off.

 Maharashtras hopes, therefore, rest on the defunct 2,184 mw Dabhol project. Shinde plans to run the first phase using naphtha after Union minister Prithviraj Chavan returned empty-handed from his liquid natural gas hunt in Oman last month.

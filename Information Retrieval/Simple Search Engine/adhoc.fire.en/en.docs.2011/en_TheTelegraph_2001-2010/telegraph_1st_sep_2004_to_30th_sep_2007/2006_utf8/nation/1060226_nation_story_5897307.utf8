 Cops crack staged 50-lakh robbery

 Mumbai, Feb. 25 (PTI): Police today claimed to have cracked a Rs 50-lakh robbery from a car in south Mumbai, arresting the complainant for allegedly staging the theft.

 The police said 29-year-old Hussainmiya Janjirkar had planned to steal his employers money and put it in a call centre business.

 He hatched the plan thinking that his employer, for whom he had delivered money many times before, would not suspect him.

 Janjirkar is reported to have confessed the crime and the police have already seized Rs 47 lakh of the stolen cash. Three more persons, allegedly involved in the robbery, have been arrested. They will be produced in court tomorrow.

 Janjirkar and Tahir, another accused, had lodged a complaint on Thursday night claiming that two persons robbed them of Rs 50 lakh on PM Road in south Mumbai before escaping in a four-wheeler.

 The money belonged to Marylyn Marine services, a ship-breaking firm, and the two were on their way to deposit the money with the companys chartered accountant.

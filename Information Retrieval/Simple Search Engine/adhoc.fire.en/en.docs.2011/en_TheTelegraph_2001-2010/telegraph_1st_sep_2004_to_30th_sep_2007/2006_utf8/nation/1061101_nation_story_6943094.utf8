 Uma in home turf brawl

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Bhopal, Oct. 31: With victory on home turf Bada Malehra in doubt, Uma Bharti and her men today got into a dust-up with BJP supporters in the constituency and then called for yesterdays polling to be countermanded.

 Uma (in picture), acting as polling agent for her nominee Rekha Yadav, entered Shahrora village and confronted local strongman Shankar Pratap Singh, accusing him of buying votes through free supply of liquor and money. Local BJP leaders protested, leading to a free-for-all.

 Uma alleged that over 250 goons had been summoned from neighbouring districts in a conspiracy to get me killed. 

 But the BJPs Arvind Bhadoria alleged she was hyping up a small event to use as an excuse for her impending defeat. As a politician she can sense defeat. It is a nautanki (drama), he said.

 A case of rioting has been registered against Uma and her supporters.

 Bada Malehra, an Assembly segment in Chattarpur district, over 350 km from Bhopal, fell vacant when Uma resigned as BJP MLA. The result will be declared on Thursday. 

 A loss here would virtually finish the Uma factor in state politics while a BJP defeat would lend credence to her claim of being the architect of the partys victory in the 2003 Assembly polls.

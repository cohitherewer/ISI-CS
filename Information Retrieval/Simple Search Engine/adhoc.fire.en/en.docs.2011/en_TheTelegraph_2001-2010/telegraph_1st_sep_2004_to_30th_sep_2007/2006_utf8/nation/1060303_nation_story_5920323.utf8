 Tug-of-war over band of 40

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, March 2: At Mayavatis Mall Avenue residence this morning, the top leadership of the Bahujan Samaj Party waited for a band of 11.

 As the minutes passed, the leaders grew restive. The homecoming was not turning out as expected.

 Party chief Mayavati had called a news conference at 10.30. But all her plans to show that she was generous enough to take back the 11, part of the 40-member group that had switched loyalties to the Samajwadi Party more than two years ago, was coming to nought.

 Frenetic fingers kept pressing mobile buttons, but every time the same message came back. The MLAs had switched off their phones.

 They were not at their official residences either and the rumour mills were working. The legislators, some said, had changed their mind. 

 At 9.30, one of Mayavatis aides informed her that not 11 but just one MLA had so far decided to come back. Ram Kishan was soon rushed to the governors house to put in his papers. He told the governor he was resigning on moral grounds.

 While the BSP had to remain satisfied with five MLAs ? four resigned yesterday ? Samajwadi leaders began calling up reporters after 12 for a new conference to be addressed by chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadavs brother Shivpal Singh. The buzz was that the rest of the rebel BSP MLAs were being taken care of by the ruling party.

 At 2.30, the drama shifted to 5 Kalidas Marg, the chief ministers residence. Shivpal counted 30 of the BSP rebels and paraded them before the media. The MLAs, however, refused to talk.

 Sources said Samajwadi leaders had kept watch over the MLAs who were put up in a guesthouse. Yesterday, one of the MLAs, Jaiveer Singh, who was made education minister by Mulayam, told reporters that Shivpal threatened him after he quit. The chief ministers brother denied the charge.

 As the possession drama raged, one rebel member, Rajendra Singh Rana, approached the Supreme Court with a petition against Tuesdays order of Allahabad High Court. The high court had ruled the September 2003 split in the BSP illegal but stopped short of disqualifying the defectors.

 The BSP hit back by filing a caveat, while Mayavati called on the governor and asked him to sack Mulayam. She also urged other Opposition parties to unite and overthrow Mulayams two-and-a-half-year-old regime.

 As the mercury rose, Shivpal flaunted his partys numbers. We have the strength of 237 members (in a House of 403), he said. 

 This is minus the strength of the Congress (which offers outside support). So where is the threat to the government?

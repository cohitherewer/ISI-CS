 Marandi dumps BJP

 POORNIMA JOSHI

 New Delhi, May 17: Babulal Marandi today dealt a body blow to the BJP by giving up his Lok Sabha seat and resigning from the primary membership of the party to voice his concern at the way Jharkhand is being governed. 

 The former chief minister, who is a national vice-president and the BJPs sole member of the Lok Sabha from Jharkhand, began a 24-hour fast in Giridih today. He is expected to make a formal announcement on Thursday afternoon after he breaks his fast.

 Although the BJP denied receiving any communication from Marandi, sources in the Parliament secretariat confirmed that the BJP leader had faxed his resignation from the Lok Sabha.

 We received a fax from him. But the fax is not enough. It has to be handwritten and Marandi has to present himself before the Speaker to sign the resignation once again, said a Lok Sabha source.

 Marandis resignation is believed to be a cause of concern not just for the Arjun Munda government but also for BJP president Rajnath Singh, who is believed to have been supporting the chief minister. 

 Till he took over as BJP president on January 1, Rajnath was in charge of Jharkhand. It was his skillful handling of the political situation in the state, leading to the BJP forming a government last year, that strengthened his claim to the top post in the party.

 Coming close on the heels of the partys dismal performance in the recent polls, particularly in the Rae Bareli byelection where BJP candidate Vinay Katiyar lost his deposit, the crisis in Jharkhand is likely to prompt a fresh campaign against Rajnath.

 After Marandis resignation was received, top BJP leaders went into a huddle, with Atal Bihari Vajpayee insisting that the party should make all efforts to hold him back. 

 But Rajnath seemed confident that Marandis ouster will not impact the state government. We will see what happens. I have not spoken to him. There is no communication. The government is not in danger, he told The Telegraph.

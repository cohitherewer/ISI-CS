 Boy tossed bomb, laughed

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, June 2: The teenaged boy was laughing as he looked into the teenaged girls eyes. He had just tossed a grenade on her lap.

 Seventeen-year-old Roma Datta today shivered as she recalled the moments immediately before Wednesdays blast in a tourist bus in Srinagar that has left her injured in both legs.

 An auto-rickshaw had blocked the road and our bus had come to a stop. I had a window seat. A boy, aged about 17, smashed the window and dropped a bomb on my lap. He was laughing when he dropped it, Roma said at the Woodburn Ward of SSKM, where she has been admitted after being flown here from Srinagar.

 I was sitting beside her. We were just two minutes away from our hotel, recalled Mithu Datta, Romas mother.

 It was 5 pm and the area was crowded. As the grenade fell on my daughters lap, two men seating beside us quickly swatted it down to the floor of the bus and tried to drag her away.

 But it was too late. There was a flash and a deafening sound. I felt severe pain in both my legs, Roma said. Passengers in the last three rows at the back of the bus were injured.

 Phulu Roy, a passenger of one of the two buses attacked, has said she saw a boy, aged about 15 or 16, roll a grenade under her bus.

 Roma today learnt she had passed the Madhyamik examination in the second division, but the news seemed to hardly affect the girl from Ariadaha.

 Please take me home. I cannot bear the pain, she groaned.

 Her uncle Lakshmikanta Konar had come to the airport to receive Roma and Mithu, who arrived with 26 others 20 injured tourists and six of their relatives around 7 pm on board a Border Security Force aircraft.

 Twelve of the tourists are seriously injured and have been admitted to SSKM, Medical College Hospital and in the case of one of them at a private hospital, state tourism minister Manab Mukherjee said.

 Reena Kar and husband Raghu Raman Kar of Belgharia were in the front seats of the bus with their 14-year-old daughter Ranja.

 I heard the bang at the rear end. The bus was filled with smoke. I immediately grabbed my daughter and rushed out of the bus, Reena said. After I had got down, I realised that both my legs were bleeding profusely.

 She is at Medical College and Hospital with splinters still stuck inside her legs.

 Tapan Kumar Ghosh of Bhadreswar had received a shrapnel in the head as he tried to protect his son. He is at Calcutta Hospital.

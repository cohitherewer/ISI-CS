 Praveen debt angle

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, April 26: Since Praveen Mahajan spoke of a financial motive for shooting at brother Pramod, two businessmen have told police the building contractor owed a lot of money.

 Arun Datar, a 46-year-old newspaper distributor from Thane, said he helped Praveen transact a Rs 70-lakh land deal in Thanes Vishnu Nagar. Praveen allegedly didnt pay the whole amount to the realtor, a man called Bhave.

 Malad-based businessman Uday Shankar Mishra claimed Praveen owed him Rs 8.5 lakh. Praveen had allegedly bought two luxury buses and sold them to Mishra for Rs 17 lakh in 1999. But he had delivered only one bus.

 When Mishra asked him to refund the price of the second bus, Praveen allegedly used Pramods name to pressure him to give up his demand.

 Pramods condition continued to be critical. He was still on dialysis but doctors said they had slightly reduced the dosage of the medicine for controlling his blood pressure. Pramods son Rahul told reporters the patient had made some hand movements.

 Praveen has reportedly told the police that he had been boiling in anger at his brother not only because he humiliated him but also because Pramod wouldnt help him with money or let him use the BJP leaders name to make financial gains.

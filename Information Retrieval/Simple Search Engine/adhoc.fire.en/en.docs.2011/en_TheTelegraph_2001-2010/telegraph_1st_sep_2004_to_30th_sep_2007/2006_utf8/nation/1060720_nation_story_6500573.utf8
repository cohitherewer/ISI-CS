 Bomb hoax hits AIIMS

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, July 19: A bomb hoax call disrupted medical services at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences for about six hours today.

 Though the caller remained untraced, the call was made to the Safdarjung police station around 11:30 am. The police swung into action and alerted the AIIMS authorities.

 Within minutes, a bomb squad arrived along with over 10 sniffer dogs.

 Rooms of all the departments and hostel as well as OPDs and emergency wards were searched, before the call was declared a hoax around 5 pm.

 Due to the six-hour search, many patients who had come to seek treatment at the countrys premier hospital were turned away.

 We had no option. The police told us to leave the building immediately, said Vishal Dixit. 

 Several senior faculty members claimed that the administration did not inform them about the potential threat.

 I came to know it from the police when they entered my department while I was treating patients, said a senior surgeon in the paediatrics department.

 Anything could have happened. What if the bomb had exploded, wondered Sulekha Kumari, a senior resident doctor, who, too, hurried out of the emergency ward following instructions of the squad.

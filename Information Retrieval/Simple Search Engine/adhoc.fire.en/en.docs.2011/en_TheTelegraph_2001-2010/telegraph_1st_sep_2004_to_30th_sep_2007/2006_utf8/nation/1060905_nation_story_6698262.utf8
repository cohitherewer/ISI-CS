 Comrade amp; convertibility hard nut

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 How easy, compared with Convertibility

 Calcutta, Sept. 4: Three days ago, the CPM observed anti-imperialism day in Bengal by forming a human chain to protest against the US-led war in Iraq.

 But how do you get cadres to organise a protest against capital account converti- bility?

 It may be easier converting people to Marxism than making them understand capital account convertibility and then persuading them to hit the streets.

 The CPM politburo issued a statement today opposing the recent report of the Tarapore committee that has set out a five-year road map for capital account convertibility.

 Capital account convertibility means free currency movement into and out of the country.

 The Tarapore committee has failed to draw the most important lesson from the spate of currency crises faced by several developing countries over the past one decade. The common feature of all the crisis-afflicted countries was their liberalised capital account, the politburo said.

 The CPM opposes the move as the party thinks it would increase the financial systems vulnerability to speculative capital, a sudden and large outflow of which could precipitate a crisis. The common minimum programme (CMP), the document that constitutes the policy base of the Congress-led coalition in Delhi, had vowed to reduce the impact of speculative capital on the financial system.

 Its not the first time the CPM has found the government deviating from the CMP. On each occasion whether its the policy towards Iran or divestment from public sector units strongly worded politburo statements were followed by mobilisation of public support and protest rallies.

 Party leaders themselves acknowledge the difficulty of raising a cacophony on CAC (capital account convertibility).

 The issues concerned here cant be explained to everyone as common people cant understand the nuances of capital inflows and outflows. So getting people to protest against this will be difficult and it will take time, said politburo member and Citu leader Chittabrata Majumdar.

 Since the Tarapore committee has proposed a five-year plan, theres a lot of time. 

 To carry the protest forward, we have to involve all Left parties and approach the government, added Majumdar.

 A similar problem had cropped up during negotiations under the World Trade Organisation (WTO) to liberalise trade. Lalu Prasad had to talk about neem and how foreign companies were going to turn this traditional Indian medicinal plant into their own property by taking out patents to organise mass support against the WTO talks.

 Maybe, the CPM should try something as simple. How about telling the people that the government is mortgaging the sovereignty of the rupee?

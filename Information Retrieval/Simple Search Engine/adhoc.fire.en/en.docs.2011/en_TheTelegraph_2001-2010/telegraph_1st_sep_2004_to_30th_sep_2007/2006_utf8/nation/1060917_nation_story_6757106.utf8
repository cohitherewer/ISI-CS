 WHO for old hand to battle malaria

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 16: The World Health Organisation has recommended a return to the use of indoor sprays of DDT to fight malaria, reversing its own three-decade-old policy of phasing out indoor spraying of the insecticide.

 While announcing its new policy at a news conference in Washington DC yesterday, the WHO cited India as an example of a country that has used DDT effectively in indoor spraying to dramatically cut the number of malaria cases and fatalities.

 India had never phased out DDT completely but scientists have cautioned that mosquitoes have become resistant to DDT and to other substitute insecticides widely used in the country.

 The WHO had actively promoted indoor spraying for malaria control until the early 1980s, when growing health and environmental concerns prompted it to stop advising its use and focus on other prevention methods.

 However, extensive research and testing have since demonstrated that well-managed indoor residual spraying programmes using DDT pose no harm to wildlife or to humans, the WHO said.

 We must take a position based on science and data, said Arata Kochi, director of its Global Malaria Programme. One of the best tools against malaria is indoor residual house spraying. Among the dozen insecticides the WHO has approved as safe for house spraying, the most effective is DDT. 

 Studies show that correct spraying can reduce malaria transmission by 90 per cent.

 India never discontinued the use of DDT, though its use has decreased substantially over the years as new insecticides became available, researchers in India said. For some years, the malaria control programme used BHC and malathion as alternatives to DDT, before moving to a new class of compounds called synthetic pyrethroids.

 India began to use DDT in the 1950s and witnessed a dramatic decline in malaria. But as mosquitoes developed resistance to it, malaria cases began to rebound, peaking in the mid-1970s to over five million cases, before gradually declining to stabilise at about two million during the 1990s.

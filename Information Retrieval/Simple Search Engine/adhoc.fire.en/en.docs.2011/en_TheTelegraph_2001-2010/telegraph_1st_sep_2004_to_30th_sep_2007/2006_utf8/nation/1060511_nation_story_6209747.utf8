 Rs 400-cr dole for heartland jobless 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mulayam Singh Yadav

 Lucknow, May 10: The Uttar Pradesh government has announced a scheme that a cash-strapped Bengal had scrapped five years ago: a dole for the jobless.

 The allowance, which comes a year before the state polls, can be up to Rs 500 and includes the self-employed and those with working spouses.

 Jobless youths aged between 21 and 35 who had registered themselves with the state employment exchanges by February 28 this year are eligible, chief secretary Navin Vajpayee told reporters.

 The cabinet took just 10 minutes to clear the scheme after chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav proposed it today.

 The Rs 400-crore budget provision will be placed before the Assembly tomorrow when the House begins its session. Though the Opposition has criticised the scheme as a sop for young voters ahead of the 2007 Assembly polls, the government doesnt expect any hurdle in the House.

 Principal secretary (labour) Anil Kumar said there are 8,55,392 eligible jobless youth in the state, but the number of beneficiaries is likely to be lower. More than 1 lakh youths would not take the allowance because of different reasons, ranging from their familys economic solvency to their being not in station.

 To get the dole, those eligible must submit affidavits to their district magistrates affirming their jobless status.

 The amount may vary, between Rs 200 and Rs 500, depending on the beneficiaries educational qualification, Kumar said. The scheme comes into effect from April and the first payment, which may be delayed till the end of this year, would include the arrears.

 The allowances will be sent to the youths in their bank account by the district magistrates, who have been asked to publicise the list of beneficiaries in their office, Vajpayee said.

 Punjab gives its jobless matriculates a dole of Rs 150 and graduates Rs 200, but the self-employed are excluded.

 Bengals Left Front government had started a jobless allowance of Rs 50 in the seventies, which gradually rose to Rs 2,500 till the cash-strapped state stopped it in 2001-2002.

 The ruling Samajwadi Party leaders are holding up the scheme as a revolutionary step. The Karnataka government had promised an unemployment dole but failed to implement it. The Samajwadi Party-led government has shown its political will by making it a reality, said Ram Saran Das, Samajwadi state unit chief.

 Opposition parties are arguing the provision would put a strain on the state exchequer. The scheme isnt bad but it isnt easy to maintain. Besides, its timing makes us suspicious. Its being launched less than a year before the state is supposed to go to polls, said Promod Tiwari of the Congress.

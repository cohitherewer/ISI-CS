 New Delhi, Dec. 27: The conditional access system (CAS) will be mandatory in notified areas of Delhi, Calcutta and Mumbai from this weekend, but smaller towns, too, will be clamouring for the digital television that can be offered with the new system, say cable industry officials.

 Siti Cable CEO J.S. Kohli says once CAS rolls in the metros, viewers in other areas would demand digital television.

 Siti Cable, part of the Zee group, is one of the multi-system operators (MSOs) the big operators who sell the channels to local cable operators. From December 31, cable-operators will switch to CAS in select neighbourhoods. If you live in one of them, you need to buy or rent a set-top box for pay channels. 

 Kohli said his company is already looking at the smaller cities where it could offer digital television. However, the service that Siti Cable plans to launch wont be CAS, as viewers wont pick individual channels. A bouquet of channels will be offered in these cities. The Telecom Regulatory Authority of Indias rules wont apply to this service. 

 For now, like other MSOs, Siti Cable is focusing on CAS. Like rival Hathway, it has come out with an inaugural price for bundles of channels far below the Trai-mandated tariff of Rs 5, plus taxes, for each channel every month.

 Households which opt for Siti Cables special inaugural package will get 25 pay channels for Rs 600, plus taxes, for a year. In addition, there will be rent of Rs 30 per month for the set-top box and Rs 77 per month for the free-to-air channels. The total charges will be over Rs 157. For Rs 1,800 a year, you can own the set-top box.

 As CAS approaches, MSOs have competition from direct-to-home television (DTH). Kohli says within Zee itself, Siti Cable and Dishtv the groups DTH operator are pitted against each other.

 Pawar climbs down, only a little

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 28: Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs first serious foray into rural Bharat has run into problems of his ally, the Nationalist Congress Party, and the Congresss making. 

 With a little over 24 hours to go before Singh lands in Nagpur to travel into the areas hit by farmers suicides, the relief package he is expected to announce in Vidarbha is yet to be finalised. 

 Agriculture minister Sharad Pawar and finance minister P. Chidambaram met for the third time today to fine-tune the package but the meeting was inconclusive, ostensibly because of its huge financial ramifications. 

 The package will cover not just Vidarbha but districts in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Kerala which report large numbers of farmers suicides.

 The Prime Minister resolved his first major hitch by getting Pawar to accompany him on the two-day trip beginning June 30. Last evening, Pawar had said he would not go. 

 Pawars statement after meeting Chidambaram set off the speculation that he was unhappy at being kept out of the loop and being projected as a fall guy by the Congress for the present price rise and food shortfall. 

 He also reportedly objected to aspects of the proposed package, particularly that on the vigorous implementation of the approved major irrigation schemes. He reportedly insisted that until these projects were okayed by the environment and forest ministry, they should not form part of the deal. 

 Chidambarams ministry, on the other hand, is still assessing the financial implications of a total interest waiver to the farmers in the 31 affected districts of the four states, the rescheduling of loans for small and marginal farmers in debt and providing higher subsidy for drip and sprinkler irrigation.

 Although Congress spokesman Rajeev Shukla said there was no truth in the news of Pawars unhappiness, the fact that the party decided to have a meeting of the Congress Working Committee, its apex policy-making body, tomorrow on the eve of Singhs Bharat Darshan indicates that the war to reclaim the Maharashtra turf from the NCP is on. 

 Sources said the meeting is expected to yield a statement endorsing the Centres measures to rein in prices as well as applauding the Prime Minister for his vision for Bharat. 

 It seems Sonia Gandhi wants to ensure that her trademark aam aadmi slogan is not appropriated by the UPA allies, especially the NCP, given the tension between the Congress chief and Pawar. 

 Most Congress leaders privately blamed Pawar for the mess on the price and agriculture fronts. They alleged he was too busy with cricket politics and fixing Sourav Ganguly after taking over the BCCI and marketing Maharashtras wines to have time for paddy, wheat and sugar.

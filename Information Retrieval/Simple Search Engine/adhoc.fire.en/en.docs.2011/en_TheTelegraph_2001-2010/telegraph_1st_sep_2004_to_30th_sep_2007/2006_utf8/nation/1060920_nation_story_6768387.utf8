 In distress, Diwali bonus

 - Shops on seal list selling cheap

 CHARU SUDAN KASTURI

 One more closed

 New Delhi, Sept. 19: Diwali has come early this year to Delhi. Although the festival is about a month away, the shopping spree that accompanies it has begun.

 The reason: distress sales at markets that are on the hit list of the municipal corporations sealing drive.

 From the middle-class family hangouts of Lajpat Nagar and Sarojini Nagar to the expensive salons and designer showrooms of Greater Kailash, a flood of customers is leaving shopkeepers gasping for breath.

 Normally, this is a period when sales go down because of the shraadha period when Hindus are not supposed to buy things for themselves. But this year, business has reached record levels because of the distress sales, says Rajeev Agnihotri, sales manager at Benetton.

 Many, like Shimona Raghuvanshi, cant believe their luck. The aspiring fashion designer has just bought a brand new designer sherwani for Rs 650 almost a fourth of the original price of Rs 2,500.

 Wearing the white-laced outfit, a beaming Shimona says she wants to shop as much as I can before the government brings in a move to stop the sealing.

 As she says it she bites her tongue, mindful of the many shopkeepers glaring at her.

 This (the sealing) is not at all fair. We believe the ground is being created for more malls. What about those shopkeepers who cant afford a place in a mall? asks Rizwan Khan who, with his family, has been running a sweet shop at the corner of the Greater Kailash main market for two decades.

 The corporations sealing drive against commercial establishments in residential localities, ordered by the Supreme Court, has targeted not just the small corner shops but also the big establishments in posh markets.

 So Rizwan is in the same boat with Shashank Shekhar, who was sales in-charge at the Lajpat Nagar branch of Haldirams before the bulldozers came. Shekhar says the sealing drive has eaten up many jobs.

 Our outlet, for instance, used to employ close to 100 people, in one way or the other. Most of them, mainly those at the lower rungs, are today unemployed.

 Tulika Garg, managing director of Continental Shelf a continental cuisine eatery says the forced shift from South Extension to Vasant Vihar cost her at least Rs 5 crore.

 Several top fashion designers suffered, too, when the Mehrauli Gurgaon Road in south Delhi, which used to host most of the top designer showrooms, was targeted.

 Sudhanshu Kuba isnt complaining, though. The 18-year-old college student says he would never have been able to afford a Rs 2,000 necklace for his girlfriend. 

 I got it for Rs 450. Of course, my girlfriend doesnt know I got it cheap. I dont know if Ill tell her, he says.

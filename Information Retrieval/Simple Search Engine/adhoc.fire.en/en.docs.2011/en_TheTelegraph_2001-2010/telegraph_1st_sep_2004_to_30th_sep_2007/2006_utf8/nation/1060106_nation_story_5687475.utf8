 Foreigner identifies rapists

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Jan. 5: A 27-year-old foreigner who was allegedly drugged and raped in Mumbai last week today identified the two arrested persons as her violators, police sources said.

 The woman, from a prominent business family with Indian roots, was taken to the Arthur Road jail this morning, where an identification parade was carried out in the presence of a magistrate and the investigating officer. 

 Assistant commissioner of police Prahlad Sonawane said the woman identified Sunil Morepani and Suresh Krishnani as Aditya M and Rahul, the names stated in the FIR she had filed.

 In the FIR, lodged at the Vile Parle police station on December 29, the woman had alleged that Aditya M and Rahul raped her repeatedly at an unknown destination after spiking her drink at Avalon, a pub in a three-star hotel near the Mumbai domestic airport. 

 Based on her description, the police picked up Morepani, a model coordinator-cum-casting agent, and Krishnani, a wine shop owner, on December 31.

 With the identification parade over, police officers said they could now focus on further investigations ? for instance, if the owner of the hotel, G.S. Bawa, had any links with the accused.

 Bawa met the foreigner at a five-star hotel two days before the incident and had invited her for dinner to his Hotel Bawa International on December 27. He also asked her to visit Avalon pub where she bumped into Morepani and Krishnani.

 The police also launched a probe to find out if the victim had been filmed after being drugged as Krishnanis mobile phone revealed some pornographic video clips.

 Pilgrim peak for Haj

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 16: A record number of Haj pilgrims are likely to visit Mecca this year after the government today decided to enhance their travel quota by 10,000 to 1.1 lakh.

 Plans have also been drawn up to add more flights to accommodate the increased number of pilgrims who would now avail themselves of the foreign ministrys subsidy scheme.

 Air-India and Indian will fly them from Calcutta, Nagpur, Aurangabad, Patna, Guwahati, Jaipur and Srinagar later this month.

 The decision to increase the quota was taken at a meeting of the Union cabinet.

 About 110,000 pilgrims will get the benefit of the second phase of Haj operations, information and broadcasting minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi said after the meeting.

 The decision to allow more Haj pilgrims to travel to Mecca follows the Saudi Arabian governments move to enhance the quota for Indians by 16,000.

 According to the agreement with the Saudi government, India will send 147,000 pilgrims. Of them, 1.1 lakh will be sent through the Haj committee.

 Officials said elaborate arrangements have been made to handle the rush. 

 The list has been computerised to remove names of those who have been to the holy city before. More than 200 names have been deleted and elimination is still going on.

 The officials said accommodation for 90,000 pilgrims have been arranged and preparations were on to house another 15,000.

 The highest number of pilgrims are from Uttar Pradesh, followed by Kerala and Andhra Pradesh. 

 The officials said the quota of each state would be increased accordingly after the permission to allow an additional 10,000 pilgrims.

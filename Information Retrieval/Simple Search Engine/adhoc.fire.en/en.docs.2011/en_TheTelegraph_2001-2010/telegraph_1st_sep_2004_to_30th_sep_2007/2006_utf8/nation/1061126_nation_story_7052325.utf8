 Love will win: Neelam

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Bharti Yadav

New Delhi, Nov. 25: The phone line was crackling, but the voice at the other end was far from uncertain. Love will prevail over fear, said Neelam Katara, her voice as steely and hopeful as her resolve has been for more than four years, in trying to get justice for her son Nitish.

 The love they shared will make Bharti Yadav help bring Nitishs killers to book, the mother believes. That belief is now going to be tested.

 Bharti, whose testimony is considered critical to the murder case, returned last night to India from Britain where her family claims she was studying hotel management and will have to appear in court on Wednesday.

 She has returned and is staying at the family house at Chattarpur (near Mehrauli in south Delhi), her lawyer Subhash Bhuttal said. 

 As B.S. Joon, the chief public prosecutor, put it, its a visit to the court long overdue. 

 Nitish, a graduate from the Institute of Management Technology, Ghaziabad, was murdered on the night of February 16-17, 2002, allegedly by Bhartis brother Vikas and cousin Vishal Yadav. According to the prosecution, Vikas and Vishal did not approve of Bhartis relationship with Nitish, the reason cited for the murder.

 In her police statement, Bharti, daughter of politician D.P. Yadav, said she was told her brothers took Nitish away in a car from a party she too was attending that night.

 I know my brothers were upset because I danced with Nitish at the party, her statement reads.

 The prosecution has been waiting for Bharti to reveal who told her that her brothers had taken Nitish away. Once it is confirmed Vikas and Vishal were the last people with Nitish before his murder, our case becomes virtually impenetrable, Joon said.

 But the wait has been long. Sixteen court summons and a non-bailable warrant failed to get Bharti to appear.

 Finally, on the day she was to be declared a proclaimed offender by the trial court following which an Interpol notice would have been issued Bharti faxed a message to additional sessions judge Ravinder Kaur.

 In the fax, sent from Middlesex, she agreed to appear before the court. Subsequently, her lawyers put forward several conditions before the court for her return.

 Most of these demands, including one seeking to bar Neelam from being present in court during Bhartis testimony, were rejected.

 The defence wanted to hold up her arrival to India as long as possible, and so they filed all the affidavits and appeals they could, said Joon, under 24x7 police protection after receiving threats in the run-up to Bhartis arrival.

 Police and the public prosecutor will have to wait till Wednesday to speak to Bharti the court has made it clear she cannot be detained.

 The court has advised her not to speak to the media, Bhuttal said. 

 When she does speak in court, the media will not be allowed in her testimony will be recorded on video. Neelam will be present though and, she says, waiting.

 Rajnath rider to Advani demand

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 29: Yesterday, L.K. Advani stole Rajnath Singhs thunder by supporting the agitating doctors demand to evaluate the impact of reservation.

 Rajnath today tried to salvage lost ground by adding a rider to his partys support for an OBC quota: reservation for economically weaker sections among upper castes.

 He also condemned the UPA government for its socially divisive manner of handling the quota issue. 

 Rajnath today addressed his first national executive meeting as BJP president under Advanis imposing shadow. On display were his political skills against his predecessors considerable talents. Advani calmly watched from the gallery.

 The issue that is currently testing their political dexterity is equally contentious. The BJP supports the 27 per cent reservation for OBCs in higher educational institutions. But subsequent protests have largely convinced the BJP that the opinion-making class has deserted the Congress on this issue and the party is keen to lure the middle class back into its fold.

 At the same time, the BJP president also has to worry about not alienating the OBCs.

 What Rajnath did today was a careful balancing act. Yet, coming as it did after Advanis public statement that seemed to be in the anti-quota camps favour, it was viewed as a mere step forward in the path paved by Advani.

 The manner in which the reservation issue has been handled by the government leaves no one in doubt that its object is not social justice but to create social tensions, Rajnath said. While providing reservation, any attempt at divisiveness must be avoided. Social fabric must not be damaged. Consensus-building is a prerequisite for such initiatives.

 Clearly mindful of the partys desperation to win over the OBCs, Rajnath stressed that the BJP was in favour of reservation for the OBCs. The BJP had supported the constitutional amendment to provide reservation in higher educational institutions, he said.

 Unfortunately for Rajnath, his carefully drafted lines had already been delivered by Advani yesterday. Nevertheless, he repeated them with gusto. 

 However, Rajnath did emerge a winner of sorts by announcing the BJPs demand for reservation for the economically weak among upper castes. The government must ensure that economically weaker sections among the upper castes are included in the benefits of reservation, he said.

 Rajnath also repeated the BJPs long-pending demand that minority institutions should not be excluded from the obligation of reservation.

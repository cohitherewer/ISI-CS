 My Lord may be on way out

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 12: The Bar Council of India (BCI) has indicated its willingness to replace the colonial practice of addressing judges as My Lord and Your Lordship with Your Honour and Honourable Court.

 The BCI framed a draft rule after discussing it at a meeting yesterday.

 The draft rule, which has been sent to all state bar councils for their response, will be finalised after taking their views into consideration.

 While the draft rule suggests Your Honour and Honourable Court for the Supreme Court and high courts, it leaves it open for lawyers to address trial court judges as Sir or use any other equivalent word in respective regional languages. 

 The BCI noted that it sought to frame the rule as My Lord and Your Lordship were relics of the colonial past.

 The state bar councils have been asked to give their views within six weeks.

 The Progressive and Vigilant Lawyers Forum had made a representation before the BCI after the Supreme Court refused to entertain its petition. The court had observed that it was for the BCI and state bar councils to decide the issue.

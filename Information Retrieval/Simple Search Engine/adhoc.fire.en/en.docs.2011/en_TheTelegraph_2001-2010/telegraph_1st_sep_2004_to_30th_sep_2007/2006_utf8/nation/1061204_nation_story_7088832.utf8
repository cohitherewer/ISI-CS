 Madarsas turn down Arjun plan 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 3: For the second time in two years, Muslim educationists have rejected Arjun Singhs proposal for a central madarsa board, arguing it would mean government interference.

 At a convention of Muslim scholars and heads of educational institutions, the Union human resource development minister had served up a reworked version of the earlier proposal.

 He said the board, set up under an act of Parliament, will be free of government control. It will raise its own money and build a corpus. It will not pay income tax but will be allowed to accept foreign contribution.

 Affiliation to the board will be optional. The board will modernise the curricula and conduct examinations. Madarsas now lack a uniform examination system.

 The delegates said they were not against madarsas teaching English, science or mathematics but would not accept a central board, which would only bring in government interference in some way or the other.

 With the Sachar committee citing gaping holes in the madarsa system, Arjun asked the scholars to come up with concrete suggestions that can be included in the 11th Five-Year Plan.

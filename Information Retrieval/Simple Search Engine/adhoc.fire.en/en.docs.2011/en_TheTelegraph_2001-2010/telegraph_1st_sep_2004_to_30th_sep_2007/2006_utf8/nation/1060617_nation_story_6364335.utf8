The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Gone with the house, sunset peacock

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 16: The Congress is in tears, the BJP sceptical and the Janata Dal (United) angry.

 Today, when the Union cabinet okayed a uniform and rational policy for the allotment of land to parties for their headquarters here, no one from the political establishment cheered ? not even the Congress, despite the fact that the coalition government it heads passed the order.

 The decision meant the parties, which worked out of sprawling bungalows surrounded by acres and acres of greenery and the lovely, old jacaranda, laburnum, jamun and neem trees in Lutyens Delhi, would have to move out.

 The alternative spaces are in three areas, none of which has the charm of the heart and soul of Delhi. They are Deendayal Upadhyaya Marg, Badarpur-Mehrauli on the road to Faridabad and RK Puram, a residential-cum-commercial area of south Delhi.

 The Congress was quick to apply for land on Deendayal Upadhyaya Marg, which is part of Lutyens Delhi and has colonial houses and shaded avenues. But sources said it would be impossible to replicate the space and character of 24 Akbar Road, its headquarters since February 1978. 

 There is an element of nostalgia to the whole thing because there are so many memories connected with this office. But we are all bound by the law, said party spokesman Abhishek Singhvi.

 The office was originally a house allotted to G. Venkataswamy, then MP from Andhra Pradesh. In a burst of munificence, he gifted it to the party. 

 The bungalow, which houses the offices of Sonia Gandhi and her senior colleagues, was gradually expanded to accommodate some of the frontal outfits such as the Seva Dal and a canteen. Its five acres were also enough to construct small homes for the staff. 

 The employees said they would miss the peacock the most, which appears without fail at sunset.

 The BJP office on 11 Ashoka Road may not be as expansive as the grand old partys, but no one was cribbing. The party now has no idea where it will move.

 Its spokesman Ravi Shankar Prasad described the cabinet order as biased in the Congresss favour and questioned the criterion of allotting land on the basis of the parties present strength. 

 The bungalow has seen the BJP through its rise in the Ram temple era and fall after the NDA was voted out in 2004. Its ideologues and astrologers tried all kinds of vaastu mechanisms to tide it over the crises but have had no luck so far. 

 A small gate connects the bungalow to its neighbour ? 9 Ashoka Road. This house was allotted to Arun Jaitley but he chose to live in his own residence. The party then turned it into a home for its superannuated members, who like good RSS pracharaks have stayed unmarried. The lawns, however, are used to host wedding receptions. Jaitley had once loaned it to cricketer Virender Sehwag.

 The office of the Janata Dal (United) has its own past. The gigantic structure on Jantar Mantar, the hub of agitations ? with its walls and floors splattered with paan stains ? originally belonged to the Congress. It was taken over by the Congress () after the split and finally went to the Socialists.

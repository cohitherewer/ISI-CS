The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 BJP opts out of Speaker drive

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 11: The BJP will not support Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjees efforts to evolve a consensus on the expulsion of the 11 MPs caught in the cash-for-questions scam.

 At a meeting of its parliamentary party at former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayees residence tonight, party leaders decided they did not want to back a clash between the judiciary and legislature.

 Delhi High Court had earlier sent notices to the Speaker, the chairman of the Rajya Sabha and the Centre after eight of the expelled 11 filed a petition.

 But Chatterjee has decided not to reply to the notices on the ground that the House and its decision are sovereign and the court has no jurisdiction in the matter. He has called an all-party meeting on January 20 to discuss the notices.

 The BJP would not be party to any collective decision on the matter, the BJPs deputy leader in the Lok Sabha, V.K. Malhotra, said.

 Malhotra, who described the Speakers efforts to evolve a consensus as inappropriate, however, added that a decision on attending the all-party meeting would be taken later.

 The partys national council meeting falls on the same day and it could be an easy explanation to skip the Speakers session.

 BJP president Rajnath Singh, however, had told The Telegraph earlier today that the party should attend the meeting. But the final decision will be taken by the parliamentary party. 

 Rajnath was clearly echoing the majority view in the BJP. 

 His predecessor L.K. Advani had earned the wrath of many a party leader for seeming to defend the erring MPs. In his reply on a motion to adopt a recommendation on sacking the 11, Advani had said expulsion was too harsh a punishment. He had also gone on to describe the MPs as stupid. 

 Advanis statement generated a lot of heat, with many participants at the BJPs silver jubilee celebrations openly attacking him for his stand.

 Despite the dominant view that the BJP should not be seen as defending the MPs, the party does not want to publicly contradict its earlier decision to boycott Parliament on the expulsion issue.

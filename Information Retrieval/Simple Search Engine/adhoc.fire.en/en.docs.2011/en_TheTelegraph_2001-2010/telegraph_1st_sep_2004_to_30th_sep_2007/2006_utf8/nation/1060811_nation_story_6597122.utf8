 Two quota bills on Arjun table

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 10: Human resource development minister Arjun Singh has tied himself in knots over the 27 per cent quota for Other Backward Classes in institutions of higher learning.

 Faced with a divided cabinet and under mounting pressure from the Prime Minister, the HRD ministry has not only backtracked on its plan to implement the quota at one stroke, but is also bringing in two bills in place of one.

 One provides for extending reservation to OBC students in aided institutions. The other plans to introduce quotas for Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and OBCs in unaided deemed universities. There are 93 deemed universities in the country.

 The bill expanding the scope of reservation in aided institutions will stagger the introduction of the OBC quota after the IITs, IIMs and the agriculture universities protested against its implementation at one go from the next academic year. The IITs, IIMs, Indian Institute of Science, National Institute of Design and the School of Planning and Architecture will be allowed to introduce quotas in phases.

 The two draft bills have been sent to other ministries for their comments. They will then have to be endorsed by the cabinet.

 The HRD ministry is determined to introduce the bills in this session of Parliament. 

 The ministry was forced to draft the two bills after Prime Minister Manmohan Singh suggested that unaided institutions be kept out of the quota ambit.

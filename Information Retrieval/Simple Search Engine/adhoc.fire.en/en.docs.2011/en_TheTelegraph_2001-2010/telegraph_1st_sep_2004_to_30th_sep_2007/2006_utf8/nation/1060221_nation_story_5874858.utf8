 Tall ask for staff in zone

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 20: A hand-scrawled map tucked in a folder that Upma Chawdhary carries represents the logistical challenge that bird flu response teams face as they slaughter chickens in the infected zone and count poultry in the surrounding surveillance zone.

 It is a challenge that could explain why only 80,000 birds had been culled by this evening and why a decision to vaccinate chickens against bird flu in the surveillance zone is yet to be taken.

 The 16 farms infected with avian influenza H5N1 are scattered across a large area where the distance between the two farthest farms is 5 km.

 The infected zone thus has a radius of 8 km, an area much larger than initially anticipated.

 From the circumference of this zone, the surveillance zone extends outward another 7 km. The surveillance zone is large, said Chawdhry, the joint secretary in the department of animal husbandry. Chawdhary is among the officials in Delhi who have spent the past three days, working 18 to 20 hours a day, seeking authentic figures of chickens in the poultry farms scattered across Navapur.

 A rapid response team member from Navapur said over telephone that the culling has gained momentum since early this morning.

 The government has a stock of 700,000 doses of bird flu vaccine for the chickens. But well take a decision on vaccinating the chickens in the surveillance zone after the culling operations are completed, Chawdhary said. 

 Relying on information provided by state animal husbandry staff, the government had initially prepared a plan for culling about 300,000 birds and vaccinating about a million in the surveillance zone. But today, officials said the exact number to be culled would be known only after the job is complete. 

 The vaccine imported from Holland comes at a price of Rs 1.50 a dose, officials said. But the actual cost of delivering the vaccine to every chicken in the surveillance zone would be higher because of transportation and delivery costs, they said.

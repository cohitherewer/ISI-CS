 Arrest warrant chases Sadhu

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, Feb. 13: A vigilance court today issued a non-bailable arrest warrant against Rashtriya Janata Dal MP Sadhu Yadav for allegedly furnishing false and suspicious information in the multi-crore flood scam.

 The government has issued a countrywide alert and asked the airport authorities to help arrest the Gopalganj MP.

 Additional director-general (vigilance) Neelmani, the Delhi police commissioner, directors-general of police of all states, the chief of the Central Industrial Security Force and all zonal police officers in Bihar have been asked to cooperate with the bureau in arresting Sadhu.

 Special judge (vigilance) R.N. Prasad issued the arrest warrant on the bureaus plea.

 An amount of Rs 6 lakh had been credited to the bank account of Sadhu, the brother of former chief minister Rabri Devi, from the one held by Santosh Jha, an accused in the scam.

 During interrogation on September 12 last year, he (Sadhu) told us that the money was the proceeds of a car that he had sold to Santosh Jha. Further investigation revealed that he had bought the 2001 model Opel car in question from one Sumit Jena in Delhi in June 2004 for a mere Rs 1 lakh. It is strange that in January 2005, he sold the same vehicle for a higher sum of Rs 6 lakh, Neelmani said.

 Vigilance officials said the vehicles value, instead of depreciating, actually went up after six months. This brings the transaction under very serious suspicion. It looks unbelievable, they added.

 Sadhu was known to be close to Jha, a small-time trader who made a fortune, and former Patna district magistrate Gautam Goswami, who was in charge of flood relief operations. Both are lodged in jail and their bail pleas have been rejected.

 Jaya plea

 New Delhi, April 25: Jaya Bachchan has moved the Supreme Court seeking to set aside her disqualification from the Rajya Sabha for holding an office of profit under the Uttar Pradesh government, reports our legal correspondent.

 The actress-turned-politician has requested the court to declare the Presidents March 16 order null and void. 

 The order was arbitrary and violative of Article 14 of the Constitution, she alleged in the petition, which was numbered by the courts registry today.

 Bachchan said her appointment as the chairperson of the state film development council was purely advisory and she had never asked for anything in return.

 Rap on cell operators

 New Delhi, Jan. 15 (PTI): Telecom regulator Trai has pulled up the Cellular Operators Association of India for the deteriorating quality of mobile services in the country. 

 Trai said the operators were citing delay in interconnectivity and spectrum-related issues as the reason for the poor quality. 

 In a letter, Trai said it is understood that operators have not taken any steps to reduce the time period in the interconnection pacts. Besides, the association has not explained how the delay was affecting quality.

 On spectrum, reacting to the associations statement that lack of additional frequency was an impediment in offering quality services, Trai said: As such, spectrum is not an impediment in ensuring quality.

 According to the last survey by Trai, most of the operators had failed to meet the prescribed benchmarks.

 There are parameters like customer helplines, billing complaints, accumulated downtime of community isolation which are not connected with the issues raised by the association, the letter said. 

 All the operators are not meeting some of these parameters in some circles, the regulating authority added.

 The regulator had issued a directive to all operators in November to ensure that the quality of service should be up to the prescribed benchmarks by December 31.

 Denying the allegations, the association has asked Trai to withdraw its directive.

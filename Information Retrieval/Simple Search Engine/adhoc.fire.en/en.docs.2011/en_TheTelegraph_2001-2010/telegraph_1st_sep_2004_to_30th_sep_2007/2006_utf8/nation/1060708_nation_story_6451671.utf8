 Vajpayee washes hands of house

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 7: Former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, one of the VVIPs named in a PIL questioning the allotment of residences in Lucknow by the Uttar Pradesh government, told the Supreme Court today he was not interested in possessing any government accommodation in his constituency.

 The petition was filed by an NGO, Lok Prahari, challenging the constitutional validity of the Ex-Chief Ministers Residences Allotment Rules, 1997, which has a clause that entitles former Prime Ministers to get government accommodation.

 Vajpayee said he had vacated his previous residence at La-Plaze and had not taken possession of the bungalow allotted to him at 10 Mall Road.

 He admitted that his office had applied for accommodation but he was no longer interested in taking possession and so his name should be deleted from the list of respondents to the petition.

 The NGO argued that there was no justification in providing free residences to those who had ceased to be chief ministers or Prime Ministers.

 The PIL, which sought a directive to the Uttar Pradesh government to cancel all illegal allotments, named 16 former chief ministers, including V.P. Singh, N.D. Tiwari and Mayavati, as beneficiaries.

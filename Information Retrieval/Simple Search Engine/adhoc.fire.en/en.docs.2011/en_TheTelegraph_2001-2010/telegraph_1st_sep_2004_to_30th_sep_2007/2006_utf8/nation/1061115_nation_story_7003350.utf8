 Split voices in rival ranks

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 14: Political boundaries were clearly marked today in the debate over reservation for Muslims, with the NDA, too, speaking in a divided voice.

 The BJP stood isolated as the only party to oppose reservation, while its erstwhile and current allies the Janata Dal (United) and the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP), to name a few charted out their individual courses.

 The Dal (U), while opposing reservation on religious grounds, said Dalit Muslims and Christians should be clubbed with scheduled castes so that they can avail themselves of the quota benefits being given to SCs.

 The Dal (U)s demand is at variance with that of LJP chief Ram Vilas Paswan, who a few days ago had advocated a quota for Muslims by including them in the list of other backward classes.

 The BJP has dubbed the UPA chorus for Muslim reservation competitive communalism. The party perceives this as a golden opportunity to revive its lost Hindu vote-bank in the Hindi heartland, especially in Uttar Pradesh.

 Senior BJP leaders are addressing the media almost every second day over the issue. Yesterday, party president Rajnath Singh described recent statements by UPA leaders as an attempt to Balkanise India. Today, party spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad demanded an explanation from Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.

 Religion-based reservation is a dangerous and unconstitutional demand, which has far-reaching implications for the country. The BJP rejects this demand and any attempt to divide the country on communal basis. The party would oppose any compromise on the existing benefits being given to SC/STs and other backward classes in the country, Prasad said.

 We also want to know from the PM where he stands on this issue, he added.

 New Delhi, March 8: Gursharan 

 Kaur, the shy, retiring wife of Prime Minister Manmohan 

 Singh, was thrust into the limelight today when she kicked 

 off a panel discussion on a controversial issue: Are 

 women effective leaders?

 The debate, which was part of the nationwide celebration of International Womens Day, saw Indias First Lady addressing a packed audience of women and a handful of men.

 Kaur said: The problem relating to women and girl child comes from illiteracy. We should give more importance to the girl child.

 The subject turned to whether women had been able to carve a space for themselves in todays competitive world. Kaur said: We (women) have already begun to do that, but a lot more needs to be done. We are no less than men... all we need is enough freedom, recognition and opportunity to go ahead in life.

 Sharing the dais with Kaur were Smriti Z. Iraani of the popular serial Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi, actor Shabana Azmi and former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Farooq Abdullah.

 Smriti urged the audience to work hard in changing the mindset of women to make them leaders in all fields.

 Shabana said: We are effective leaders because we are different from men.

 Society can change. Only women can do that since we think differently from men. But for this, we need our rights, she added.

 Expressing her displeasure on the portrayal of women in TV serials, Shabana took a dig at Smriti after she left midway. Isnt it strange that we have an entertainment industry full of women but all their roles portrayed are still very stereotyped? So, have they (women) really been able to bring about an effective change?

 Speaking on similar lines, Abdullah said: The strength does not come from words alone. Women need to be resolute and stand up for their rights and, if needed, fight for them.

 In a lighter vein, he added: All men are henpecked, no matter whatever they show. They need women and that is the truth.

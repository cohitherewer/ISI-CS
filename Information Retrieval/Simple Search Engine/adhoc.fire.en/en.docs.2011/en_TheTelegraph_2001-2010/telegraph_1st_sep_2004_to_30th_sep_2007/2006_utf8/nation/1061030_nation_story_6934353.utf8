 Sex slaves flee Sharjah captors

 Dubai (PTI): Two Indian women, who were allegedly forced into prostitution in Sharjah, have escaped from the clutches of their captors.

 The women, aged 31 and 32, made their getaway on Saturday from a flat where they were locked up, and have been brought to the Indian consulate in Dubai. They had come to the UAE on September 10 after being offered jobs as cleaners by an agent in Kerala.

 One of them was quoted by Gulf News as saying they were forced to work for long hours. I have three children back home.... I have not been paid at all. I am also scared.... What if I have contracted some disease, she said.

 The woman said the news of her fathers death forced her to revolt against the agents. When they refused to entertain any more men, they were locked up in the flat as punishment.

 For the first couple of the days the agents men came with food, but later their visits stopped.... We came across a screwdriver... Slowly we unscrewed the lock and got out of the flat early in the morning, the woman said.

 Netaji claim before death

 Guna (PTI): A man believed to be nearly 125 years old claimed he was Subhash Chandra Bose before he died two days ago in a village near this Madhya Pradesh town, prompting police to launch a probe.

 Baba Lalji Maharaj, living in Saiji village in Ashok Nagar district for the past 30 years, claimed before he died on October 27 that he was Netaji, ex-sarpanch G.S. Raghuvanshi said.

 He revealed his identity and asked us to keep it a secret till his final rites were performed, he added.

 Sentence cut

 New Delhi (PTI): Delhi High Court has reduced the sentence of a convicted dacoit after the prosecution failed to prove he carried arms during a robbery.

 The court took into consideration the fact that Surinder, out on bail, is now apparently a reformed man making a living as a vegetable vendor. He had been found guilty by a trial court.

 Air heart attack

 Chennai (PTI): A 30-year-old woman on a Visakhapatnam-bound Air Deccan flight suffered a heart attack after the aircraft returned here following inclement weather on Sunday, airport officials said. She was given first aid by the airport doctor and then hospitalised.

 Valley prisoners

 Srinagar (PTI): Jammu and Kashmir High Court 

 has asked the state government to provide a list of prisoners 

 facing trial who have not been produced in courts for the 

 past six months or more.

 An MDMK candidate lost the chairmanship of a 

 town panchayat in Madurai after the ADMK councillor who 

 proposed the candidates name filled in his own name 

 in the form by mistake.

 IFS man in trafficking glare loses post 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 18: Senior IFS official Rakesh Kumar, wanted by the CBI in a human trafficking case, has been stripped of his charge as secretary, economic relations.

 Rinzing Wangdi, a 1971 batch IFS officer, has replaced him, official sources said.

 Kumar, who was then in Latin America on an official tour, was asked to go on leave after his name appeared in an FIR lodged by the CBI in the human trafficking case.

 The senior IFS officer was accused of sending a dance troupe, Mehak Punjab Di, illegally to Germany last year when he was director-general of the Indian Council for Cultural Relations. Nine members of the group went missing after landing in Berlin. All of them have been found, and five are being deported. Four are contesting deportation in a German court.

 Kumar, who was asked to cut short his trip to face investigators, got admitted to a hospital in Munich on the way back, complaining of chest pain and high blood pressure. He was served with summons while he was in Germany, where he stayed for more than two weeks, but has not appeared before the CBI even after his return.

 Instead, he headed to Rishikish to recuperate. A notice asking him to appear before the CBI was sent to his home through the ministry of external affairs. Another notice was sent directly by the CBI. 

 CBI officials probing whether Kumar took money from the troupe members, said they will wait for him to appear for questioning on his own.

 Tax notice to Gupta

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 14: Adobe CEO Naresh Gupta, whose son Anant was kidnapped and rescued from Noida last month, has been slapped with an income-tax notice.

 Gupta has been asked to appear before the additional income-tax commissioner (Noida circle) on December 28, a PTI report quoting sources in the department said.

 Gupta has been asked to furnish details of bank accounts, property and other sources of income, possibly to find out the source of the Rs 50-lakh ransom. He confirmed receiving the IT notice, but described the ransom link as kite flying.

 Yes, I have received IT notice. But so what? The income-tax department does its assessment every year and we keep getting such notices as a matter of routine. I dont know who has concocted this baseless story of relating the notice to ransom, Gupta said.

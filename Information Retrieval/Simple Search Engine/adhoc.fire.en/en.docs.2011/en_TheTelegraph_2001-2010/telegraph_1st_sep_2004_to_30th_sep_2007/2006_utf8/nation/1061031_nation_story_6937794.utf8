 Red light for constables

 MANAN KUMAR

 New Delhi, Oct. 30: He is the pot-bellied butt of jokes in that Bollywood film you saw last week. He is the one accepting the bribe in the newspaper picture. Sometimes he is even a hero, carrying a sick man to hospital from the roadside.

 But the police constable could be preparing to take his last bow.

 A draft law promises to reform Indias 145-year-old, Raj-created police, often feared by the public as an instrument of harassment. But when the new, friendly policeman announces himself in Indian society, one familiar face could be missing.

 The drafting panel, headed by former attorney-general Soli Sorabjee, suggests doing away with the rank of constable in the civil police (as opposed to armed police).

 His place will be taken by the civil police officer (CPO) grade II, who will be recruited only after completing a three-year bachelors course at police academies and training centres, whose number will be increased.

 The objective is to improve efficiency and behaviour where they matter most at the lower rungs. The constable is absorbed into the force after just two to three months training.

 The draft law, which looks to free the police from political control and make them answerable to the public, was handed to Union home minister Shivraj Patil today. If the act, containing 221 sections in 16 chapters, is passed by Parliament it will replace the Police Act of 1861. It will, however, be a model act that the Centre cannot force on the states.

 The Supreme Court, however, last month passed an order that echoes most of the Sorabjee panel recommendations. The Centre, states and Union territories must file compliance reports by next January 3. The order which the states must obey will stay in force even after the model act is passed.

 Under the law, civil bodies headed by judges will listen to complaints against the police in every district and a watchdog in every state will ensure that governments didnt influence or pressure the force.

 To curb state governments power to transfer upright officers, a board that will include the leader of the Opposition will decide transfers, postings and promotions.

 A fixed two-year tenure has been suggested for state police bosses (director-generals), district chiefs (superintendents) and station house officers, so they can provide leadership with a long-term perspective. 

 Law and order duty is to be separated from investigation from the district level.

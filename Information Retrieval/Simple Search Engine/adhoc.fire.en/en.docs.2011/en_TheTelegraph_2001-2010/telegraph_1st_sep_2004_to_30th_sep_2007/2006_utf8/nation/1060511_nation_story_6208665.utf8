The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Safety belt for NAC but Sonia in doubt

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 10: The National Advisory Council is likely to be included in the new list of offices exempt from the MPs disqualification law, but suspense continues whether Sonia Gandhi would be back to head it.

 Sources said she might provide a clue after the Rae Bareli result is out tomorrow, her return probably hinging on whether she betters her 2004 victory margin of 2.5 lakh.

 It is learnt that 48 new offices would feature in the amended list. The Centre, as a sop to its key ally, will possibly include in it the 14 autonomous bodies, institutions and authorities of which Left MPs are a part.

 These include the Sriniketan-Santiniketan Development Authority and the West Bengal Minorities Development and Finance, headed by Speaker Somnath Chatterjee and MP Mohammad Salim.

 The Uttar Pradesh Assembly has passed an amendment declaring that the posts held by the Samajwadi Party MPs -- notably the Uttar Pradesh Development Council, chaired by Amar Singh, and the UP Film Development Council, headed by former MP Jaya Bachchan ? are not offices of profit.

 Official sources said these offices would still be included in the central list to protect other MPs from disqualification in the future.

 The bill will be introduced in the Lok Sabha on May 16 and passed after a four-hour debate. It will be sent to the Rajya Sabha the next day for discussion and passage.

 The pro-people lobbies in the Congress and the government are pressing Sonia to take over as NAC chairperson whether or not she crosses the 2.5 lakh mark.

 Otherwise the juice from this government is gone, a minister said.

 He described the council as the most potent and effective mechanism of putting a human face to the reforms-oriented agenda of the Prime Minister. He cited how the amendments forced by Sonia and her team had lent teeth to legislation such as the rural job scheme and the Right to Information Act.

 If Sonia engaged only informally with the council, it will not be the same, sources said. They cited several arguments:

 The Centre had acquired 

 an anti-aam admi image thanks to the 

 obsession with growth rate and free trade agreements. 

 As NAC chief, Sonia could steer the agenda back on the path 

 charted out by the common minimum programme.

 She should not yield 

 to the BJPs clamour for disbanding the council. Former 

 Prime Minister A.B. Vajpayee joined the chorus today.

 Without a pro-people 

 ventilator, the party would end up ceding all political 

 space to the Left and allies like the Rashtriya Janata Dal, 

 and emerge as the A-team of the India Shining advocates.

 To signal the NAC means business, its convener, Union minister Jairam Ramesh, has called a meeting tomorrow to assess the implementation of the rural job scheme and the education-for-all programme.

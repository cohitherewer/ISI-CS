 Brain drain bombshell hits AIIMS

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Over half the graduates work abroad 

 New Delhi, Dec. 26: The All India Institute of Medical Sciences produces the countrys top doctors, but more than half of them work abroad, mostly in the US.

 A study on the current whereabouts of most AIIMS graduates released today by the Delhi-based Media Study Group shows that the brain drain in the medical sciences may be more severe than earlier believed.

 Of the 2,129 students who passed out in the first 42 batches of the MBBS programme at AIIMS from its inception in 1956 to 1997 the researchers could trace 1,477.

 Of them, 780, or 52.81 per cent, are working abroad.

 Among these doctors, as many as 679, or nearly 46 per cent of those traced, are employed in the US, not far behind the 697 working in India.

 Among those still in the country, 71 per cent work in big cities Delhi, Mumbai, Calcutta, Chennai, Bangalore and Hyderabad. Rural India has been given a big miss by AIIMS. The findings are shocking, said Anil Chamadia of the Media Studies Group.

 Among those sampled, 211 are in California and New York, four more than the number employed in the whole of India outside the metros.

 The findings have come at a time when the health ministry is studying recommendations made by a committee to make AIIMS one of the top medical universities of the world.

 One of the recommendations of the three-member committee, headed by Dr M.S. Valiathan, is to hike fund allocation for the premier institute.

 These findings, however, put a question mark on the validity of that recommendation. In fact, the whole report will have to be looked at in a completely new light, said a panel member.

 The data was collected with the help of the Alumni Association of AIIMS and the AIIMSonians of America (AOA), an organisation of AIIMS graduates in the US.

 According to the AOAs Rajiv Nagar, the trend in the past few years has not changed much.

 With the private sector being allowed more and more in India post-1990, there were expectations that the outflow of AIIMS doctors would reduce. Those expectations have been proved false, Nagar said from Los Angeles.

 Calling the figures a huge matter for concern, AIIMS sub-dean Dr Sunil Chumber admitted that the administration was virtually at a loss to find ways to stop the flow of students out of India. 

 None of us here had ever imagined the numbers would be so adverse, he said.

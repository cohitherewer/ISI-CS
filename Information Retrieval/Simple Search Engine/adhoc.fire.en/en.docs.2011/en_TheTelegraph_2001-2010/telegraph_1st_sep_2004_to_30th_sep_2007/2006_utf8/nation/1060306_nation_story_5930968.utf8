The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Scientists think big and far

 G.S. MUDUR

 New Delhi, March 5: The US nuclear deal could help India make up for lost time and accelerate the indigenous three-stage nuclear power plan to exploit the nations vast reserves of thorium in the beach sands of Kerala.

 Top nuclear scientists have said the deal will enable India to access imported nuclear reactors and fuel even as the Department of Atomic Energy pursues the three-stage plan pencilled decades ago at the start of atomic energy activities in the country.

 But they cautioned that the deal would first have to be accepted by US Congress and the Nuclear Suppliers Group and the International Atomic Energy Agency would need to agree to a special set of safeguards for Indias civilian nuclear facilities.

 Its an opportunity for India to expand nuclear power capacity in a big way over the next few years, M.R. Srinivasan, former chairman of the atomic energy commission told The Telegraph. 

 India could get nuclear reactors from the US, France or Russia, as well as uranium fuel for safeguarded civilian reactors. The indigenous power programme could proceed uninterrupted.

 The deal doesnt come in the way of our strategic programme either, he said. The plutonium from nuclear reactors designated as military facilities could go into the strategic inventory. 

 In future, India could also consider the option of building a new dedicated military reactor. Since the fast breeder would be out of the safeguards, research and development activities could proceed without inspections, Srinivasan said.

 The deal could speed up the pace of the indigenous nuclear power programme by allowing India to import dual-use components, said Placid Rodriguez, a former director of the Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research in Chennai.

 In the first of Indias three-stage plan, natural uranium is burnt in pressurised heavy water reactors to produce plutonium. In the second stage, a mixed fuel of uranium and plutonium is burnt in fast breeders to produce more plutonium. In the third stage, thorium ? mined from the coastal sands of Kerala ? is turned into fissile uranium in breeders. 

 Estimates suggest that thorium-based nuclear power could meet Indias energy demand for several hundreds of years, Rodriguez said. India has more than 225,000 tonnes of thorium and scientists estimate this would provide energy for up to 500 years.

 But delays have dogged the indigenous programme. India is yet to achieve its goal of generating 10,000 mw of power through the first-stage programme, a goal outlined in the mid-1980s. The current nuclear capacity is about 3300 mw but will rise to over 7000 mw in the next three years.

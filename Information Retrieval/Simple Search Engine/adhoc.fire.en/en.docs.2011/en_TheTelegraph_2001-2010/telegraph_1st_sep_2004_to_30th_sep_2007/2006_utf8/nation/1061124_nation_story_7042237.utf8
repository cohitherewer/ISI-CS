 Sons long lesson

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, 

 Nov. 23: Chandana Bhattacharya, a widow turned 

 out of her house by her son and his wife, was today granted 

 police protection to return home by a high court judge who 

 said he wanted her grandchildren to see how their parents 

 had treated her.

 I want to keep the matter pending for 20 years. Your children will be then grown up enough to realise how their grandmother was treated, Justice Soumitra Pal told the counsel for her son Tapas, 25, and his wife.

 Chandana, 69, was being tortured for the past year because she had refused to hand over her house in South 24-Parganas to her only son, her lawyer Anjan Bhattacharya said.

 My client had no option but to knock on the high court door as the Maheshtala police turned a deaf ear to her complaint against her son on seven different occasions from May 1 to September 8 this year, he said. They used to beat her up mercilessly. She had lodged several complaints with the police. But the police did not take any action.

 The court asked the Maheshtala police station to provide all assistance to Chandana to return home.

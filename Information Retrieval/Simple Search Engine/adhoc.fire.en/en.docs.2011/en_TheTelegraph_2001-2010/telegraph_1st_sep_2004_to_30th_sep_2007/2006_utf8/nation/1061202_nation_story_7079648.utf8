 Lies in court nail Soren

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 1: The sentencing of Shibu Soren got postponed till Tuesday after the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha leader failed to appear in court for the second successive day.

 The court, informed that Soren was undergoing treatment at AIIMS, directed the hospital and police to ensure his presence on December 5.

 Speculation continued over Sorens conviction with several legal experts expressing surprise at how weak the case against him was.

 But sources close to the prosecution claimed that it was Sorens lies in court that had led to him being convicted of conspiracy to murder his former private secretary, Shashinath Jha.

 According to CBI sources, additional sessions judge B.R. Kedia relied on a principle of law, laid down in several Supreme Court judgments, that when an accused offers no explanation or an explanation that is found to be untrue when confronted with incriminating evidence, the court can draw the inference that the person is guilty.

 Soren, for instance, had first claimed that he did not know Jha and that he was one of the thousands of people who visited his house. But witnesses and evidence corroborated that Jha was indeed close to the Soren family and was his private secretary.

 Soren also denied in court that co-accused Nand Kishore Mehta was a member of the JMM and that he had been to Mehtas house, where Jha was killed. Evidence produced by the prosecution, however, established that Mehta had been given the party ticket to contest the Assembly elections from Hatia in 1995.

 Soren, similarly, denied any acquaintance with one Sushil Kumar, one of the more prominent witnesses produced by the prosecution. He turned out to be a partner in a firm promoted by Soren, his wife, son and the deceased.

 A charitable view in the CBI is that Soren and the other accused either did not understand the questions or did not care. To most queries, they had replied either I do not know or this is incorrect.

 IAF cream says no to creamies

 Lately in Bidar, North Karnataka: The UKs Royal Air Force has been told that there should be no creamies for the cream of the Indian Air Force.

 Use of creamies ? slang for top students who are asked to tutor juniors ? is normal in British education practice.

 The Royal Air Force (RAF) was using some of its own trainees who ranked as top-grade performers to instruct fighter pilots from the IAF. The Indian pilots are in the UK as part of the Rs 8,000-crore package to buy and induct the Hawk advanced jet trainer aircraft.

 The pilots of the IAF sent to the RAF Valley in Wales for the course are the cream of cadets who have topped at the Air Force Academy in Dundigal near Hyderabad. Over the next five years, 72 pilots trained in the Hawk will form the nucleus of the IAF and many of them, in turn, will become instructors for the next generation of fighter pilots.

 The first British Hawk is to be inducted into the IAF by September 2007 for which the base here in this World War II-era airfield built by the Nizam of Hyderabad in Bidar in north Karnataka is being expanded.

 Sixty-six Hawks will be inducted into the IAF under the deal ? 24 off-the-shelf and the rest licence-produced in India ? that was signed in 2004.

 The first batches of IAF rookie pilots sent to the UK for training said despite high skills, the alien social environment and the restrictions imposed by dense air traffic in British skies were posing some difficulties. Among the most important of these was the inability to follow different British accents.

 The rookie pilots in Bidar who are selected for training in the Hawk are now put through a special pre-Hawk capsule that involves listening to CDs and cassettes of common terms, jargon and slang used by the British, Irish, Scots and Welsh in their spoken English.

 Instructors from the RAF and British Aerospace, in turn, have been coaxed to pick Indian English terms and phrases.

 The airbase in Bidar, which is the home of the Suryakirans ? the squadron of nine aircraft that performs dazzling aerobatics ? is being expanded. 

 The two runways are being lengthened, a new ATC tower and separate hangars are being built for an initial cost of Rs 140 crore.

 Bidar is where fighter pilots go through the Stage II of their training programme by graduating from the HPT-32 to the Kiran Mark IA jet. 

 The induction of the Hawks will also mean the beginning of the end of the MiG Operational Flying Training Unit in Tezpur, Assam. That is expected around 2012.

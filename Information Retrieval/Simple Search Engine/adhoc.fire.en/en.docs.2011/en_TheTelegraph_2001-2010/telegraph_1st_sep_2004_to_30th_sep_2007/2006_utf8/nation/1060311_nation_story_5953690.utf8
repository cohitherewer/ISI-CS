 IIM grads shun jobs

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Ahmedabad, March 10: Mansur Ahmad, an IIM Ahmedabad graduate, got a dream offer of ?65,000 from Deutsche Bank but turned it down.

 Even before he had joined the Indian Institute of Management, the boy from Tiruchirapalli knew what he wanted: a computer games company of his own.

 The ambition took seed when he was working with IBM, developing computer games. I really enjoyed developing games. It was in those days that I thought some day I would start my own computer games company, Mansur said, explaining his decision to reject the offer that came his way during summer training at Deutsche Bank in London. 

 Mansur is sure his time is now. 

 There are several others like him, who have opted out of the placement race to follow their dream. 

 Like Nikhil Vasani and Rohit Shankar. They have already registered their company, Be Positive, which is to be launched on April 7, World Health Day.

 The company will provide wellness service ? preventive healthcare service ? and is targeted at corporate clients in the IT and BPO sectors. It will design customised packages that will be a combination of yoga, pranayam and sports, says Vasani. 

 The two friends have conducted a market survey in Pune, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Gurgaon and Gandhinagar and say the feedback is good. Eventually, they plan to set up sports academies from the money they generate from this venture. Shankar has played under-19 cricket for Karnataka. 

 Another student following his dream is Gaurav Dagaonkar, who is madly in love with music. He was not even present on campus yesterday, the second day of placements, busy as he was recording his first album in Mumbai. 

 Like Mansurs love for computer games, it was Gauravs passion for music that brought him to IIM, to pursue his ambition of setting up a music company. 

 A former cultural secretary of IIMA, he wants to launch himself as a solo artiste. Im positioning myself as one who can compose, write lyrics and sing. His album is likely to be released in April, during the convocation.

 IIMA director Bakul Dholakia is a happy man. It is a welcome sign if more and more students want to become entrepreneurs. It makes the institute proud.

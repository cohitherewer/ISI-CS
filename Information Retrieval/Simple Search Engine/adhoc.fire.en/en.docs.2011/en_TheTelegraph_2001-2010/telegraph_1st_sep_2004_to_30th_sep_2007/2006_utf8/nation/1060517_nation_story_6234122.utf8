 Boos for minister, in drops of blood

 New Delhi, May 16: Carefully harvesting a few drops of blood that flowed out of the puncture on his arm, medical student Shrey Modi used his fingers to scribble Arjun Singh hai hai on his casualty registration slip.

 After 54 hours going without food, Modi had collapsed. And in the casualty ward, as he received intravenous fluid, he decided to use his blood to articulate what he could hear fellow students screaming outside.

 A blend of poetry and perseverance, heat and hunger, marked the third day of the hunger strike at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) where dozens of medical students on strike lay sprawled on carpets.

 At least five students had to be rushed to the AIIMS casualty and students fear the number will rise if the strike continues.

 Were going to be here as long as we dont get what we want, said Modi ? a second-year undergraduate AIIMS student from Gwalior who had ranked 23 in the entrance examination ? anti-reservation messages etched on his forearm.

 But as the students and junior doctors took an aggressive line, resident doctors of 15 government hospitals, including AIIMS, withdrew their strike after the authorities termed the protest totally illegal and threatened action, a PTI report said. The strike continued in other major government hospitals such as the Guru Tegh Bahadur and Lok Nayak Jai Prakash hospitals.

 Posters on the walls of AIIMS sought to display students disgruntlement via verse. We need youth who will not divide and rule, rather than Arjun, old obstinate mule, said one. If division you scribe, united is my tribe, added another.

 Students from other institutions continued to drop by. Resident doctors from the Institute of Human Behaviour and Allied Sciences arrived, shouting anti-quota slogans.

 Dr Pradeep Sharma, senior ophthalmologist at the institute, ambled in and asked students to continue the strike. He switched to poetry: Hartal jari hain; insaaf mile humko; hartal jari hain; voton ke bhookhe mantri hain; hartal jari he (The strike is on; well get justice; the strike is on; the minister is hungry for votes).

 In the afternoon, another student, Amit, began throwing up and was rushed to casualty. Tomorrow, the faculty will observe a black day in support of the striking students.

 Pro-reservation bodies joined the fray with the OBC Mahapanchayat and the All India Pasmanda Muslim Mahaj staging a sit-in at Jantar Mantar in support of quotas.

 IMA threat

 In Indore, IMA national vice-president S.N. Goyal said the association was mulling denying membership to doctors who took advantage of reservation down the generations.

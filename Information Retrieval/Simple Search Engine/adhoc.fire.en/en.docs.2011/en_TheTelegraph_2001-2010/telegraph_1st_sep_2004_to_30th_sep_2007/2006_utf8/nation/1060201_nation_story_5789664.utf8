 In BJP, Centre has a fellow passenger

 New Delhi, Jan. 31: As the Left geared up for a battle with the government on the airport modernisation bid, the Opposition BJP inadvertently admitted its agreement with the ruling UPA on a host of economic issues.

 Sections within the RSS have already said what almost everyone in the BJP talks about in private ? that the BJP has more in common with the Congress than any of its allies. 

 RSS ideologue M.G. Vaidya made an announcement to this effect in the Marathi daily Tarun Bharat.

 Both the Congress and the BJP have presence across the country. They have people belonging to different sections of the society. Their political and economic thinking is similar, said Vaidya. The only difference is in respect of the interpretation of the idea of secularism.

 Although BJP leader M. Venkaiah Naidu today rejected Vaidyas remarks as his personal views today, the stated position of the party on a number of issues ? airport privatisation, vote on Iran, privatisation in general, Indias relationship with the US ? echoes the ruling Congress.

 BJP spokesperson Prakash Javadekar refused to make any statement against the governments decision to open bids for the Delhi and Mumbai airports today. 

 We are not against improvement of civil aviation infrastructure. The Left has threatened the government with a strike. But we only want to caution the government to keep the allotment of bids as open and transparent as possible. We have nothing against airport privatisation, he said.

 Senior BJP leaders are privately even more vocal about their support for the Centre not just on airport modernisation but on the Iran vote in the IAEA and on Indo-US relations.

 The aviation sector is growing by leaps and bounds. What do the Left leaders have in mind for improvement of airport infrastructure? Havent they experienced the chaos at the airports? The government has to go ahead with privatisation of airports. There is no other option, said a senior BJP leader.

 The BJP has demanded that the Prime Minister call an all-party meeting on the Indo-US nuclear deal and the vote on Iran, but the party has clearly refused to join the Left-led chorus for US ambassador David Mulfords expulsion.

 Honestly, there is a division in the party on this issue. I personally feel that on strategic and foreign policy issues, you cannot push the government around. Do you seriously believe that India can afford to vote in Irans favour when countries like Russia and China too have supported the US stand? asked a BJP leader.

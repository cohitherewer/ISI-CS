 Beedi caution order on hold

 New Delhi: Having faced flak from political 

 parties taking up the cause of beedi workers, the Centre 

 has offered to put on hold for four months its order saying 

 all beedi packets should carry the skull-and-crossbones 

 warning sign.

 But that is the only concession Union health minister Anbumani Ramadoss would make as MPs argued in the Lok Sabha that lakhs of workers would lose their livelihood as the new rule, meant to deter people from puffing, would put beedimakers out of business.

 The Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products (Packaging and Labelling Rules), 2006, which was notified recently, requires the warning graphic to be printed on beedi packets from February 2007.

 Ramadoss said the Centre could defer the notification till May-end. The MPs, however, have demanded that the rule be amended.

 Call for separate tea ministry

 New Delhi: A group of small 

 tea growers associations and trade unions have urged minister 

 of state for commerce and industries Jairam Ramesh to create 

 a separate ministry for tea plantations.

 The Indian tea industry is in the process of restructuring. Plantations are getting more and more separated from marketing, said J. John of the Centre for Education and Communication, a voluntary organisation. 

 The tea growers meeting with Ramesh comes on International Tea Day, being observed across the world. 

 Small tea growers and workers are bearing the brunt of the crisis, said Pallavai, who is also attached to the centre.

 UP varsity probe

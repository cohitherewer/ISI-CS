 Sealing hearing in SC today

 New Delhi: The Supreme Court will on Wednesday hear pleas by the Centre and the Delhi municipal corporation seeking to protect about 25,000 traders from the sealing drive.

 The court had blasted the government while hearing a similar plea on November 6. It had taken strong exception to the Centre seeking relief for traders who had taken to the streets against the sealing drive ordered by the apex court. 

 The Centre and the Delhi civic body have been contending that the premises of about 25,000 traders facing action were protected under the notifications but were being sealed because they had filed affidavits before the notifications were issued.

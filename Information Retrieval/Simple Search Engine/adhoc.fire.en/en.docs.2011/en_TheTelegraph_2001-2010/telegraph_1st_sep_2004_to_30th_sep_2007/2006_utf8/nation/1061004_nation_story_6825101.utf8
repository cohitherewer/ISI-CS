 Scanner on Shayans Hindi

 New Delhi, Oct. 3 (PTI): Socialite Bina Ramani and model-cum-actor Shayan Munshi, whose conflicting testimonies led to the acquittal of Jessica Lal murder accused Manu Sharma, today came under the scanner of Delhi High Court.

 A bench of Justices R.S. Sodhi and P.K. Bhasin expressed dissatisfaction at the manner in which the witnesses gave testimonies.

 What is this? What type of English is this? the bench said referring to Ramanis submissions like I think he was the same person, I guess, I believe, which she made when asked to identify Manu. 

 Government counsel Mukta Gupta said Ramani had said she confronted Manu after Jessica was shot and asked him to hand over the pistol, while asking her husband George Malihot to chase him.

 Bengalis know Hindi. How is that he says he cannot read or write Hindi. But at least he could understand Hindi, isnt it? the bench asked when the prosecution pointed out that Shayan claimed two bullets were fired from the same pistol but later said different weapons were used.

 Munshi pleaded that he did not know Hindi but merely went by the statements recorded by police. 

 Speedy trial

 The Supreme Court has asked the Centre and state governments to ensure speedy trial in criminal cases. The observation came while quashing a corruption case registered in 1980 against a bank official.

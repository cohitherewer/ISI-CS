 Cracker clash puts UP town on boil

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, Oct. 22: Tension gripped Muzaffarnagar after a youth was shot dead today in a dispute over bursting of crackers. 

 Pankaj Kumar, 22, was shot by unidentified miscreants. He died on the way to hospital. Four others were injured in clashes later.

 Senior superintendent of police Amrendra Sengar said the clash occurred when some youths insisted on bursting crackers well past midnight in the Kotwali police station area of the western Uttar Pradesh town despite objections from people of the minority community. Those opposing the fireworks felt it would disturb the early-morning namaz, police said.

 Arguments were exchanged between the two groups, which had assembled around 1 am. 

 The showdown had almost ended after some elders intervened but Kumar was shot at even as both sides were in talks to bury the hatchet.

 As news about the killing spread, the situation went out of hand. Rival groups began ransacking houses and burning shops. The police team that arrived at the scene was greeted with a hail of stones and crackers.

 The district administration imposed prohibitory orders in the disturbed areas and rushed additional forces this morning. A Rapid Action Force flag march followed. Sengar said tension is simmering, but added that enough troops have been sent to the trouble spots.

 An FIR has been registered against five suspects in connection with the murder, but only one arrest has been made so far, he said. 

 According to a PTI report, chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav announced a compensation of Rs 5 lakh for the family of Kumar. He also asked the police to take strict action against those responsible for the clashes.

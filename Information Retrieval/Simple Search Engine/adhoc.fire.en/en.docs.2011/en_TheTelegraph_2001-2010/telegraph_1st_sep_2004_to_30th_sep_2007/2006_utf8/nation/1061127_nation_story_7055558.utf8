 Womens bill hurdle

 New Delhi, Nov. 26 (PTI): The governments efforts to table the much-debated womens reservation bill in the current session of Parliament have hit another hurdle with the CPI opposing the plan to hold an all-party meeting to work out a consensus.

 Party general secretary A.B. Bardhan said there was no need for another all-party meeting on the bill as many such meetings had already been held. 

 Further meetings will become an excuse for delay in bringing the bill and betray the womens cause for political empowerment, he told a news conference. 

 The CPI supports the UPA government from outside.

 Bardhans remarks came close on the heels of a demand by the Lalu Prasad-led RJD for the all-party meeting to evolve a consensus.

 Informal consultations are on but no date has been fixed for the all-party meeting, a government source said.

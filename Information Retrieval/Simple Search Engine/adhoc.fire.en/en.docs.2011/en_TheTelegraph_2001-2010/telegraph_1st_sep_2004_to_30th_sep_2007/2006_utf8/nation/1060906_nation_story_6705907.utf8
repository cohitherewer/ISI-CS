 PM prescribes pro-active minority pill

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Singh

 New Delhi, Sept. 5: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today urged chief ministers to work on a pro-active policy to remove any feeling of alienation among Muslims and ensure that individual acts of terrorism do not stain the communitys image.

 The appeal, at the chief ministers conference here on internal security, redeemed a promise Singh had made to Muslim clerics and rights activists.

 The Prime Minister had told them last month he would soon convene a meeting of chief ministers to address their fears about selective targeting of a particular community by law-enforcement agencies after a terror attack.

 Singhs opening remarks mainly focused on the threat from Maoists, but he used the occasion to reassure the Congress that the Centre was aware of the feelings of Muslims and would rein in governments headed by the party in case of aberrations.

 The call to end feelings of persecution among Muslims follows murmurs of resentment against Maharashtras Congress chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh. The party had privately criticised Deshmukh for his alleged failure to prevent police from indiscriminately raiding minority settlements after the July 11 blasts.

 The partys Muslim members resented intelligence reports that suggested involvement of local Muslims with Kashmir militants without conclusive evidence. 

 Singh said it was unfortunate that terrorism had resulted in the targeting of certain sections. The result (is) that a wrong impression has been created of the radicalisation of the entire Muslim community. It is, hence, imperative that we embark immediately upon a pro-active policy to ensure that a few individual acts do not result in tarnishing the image of an entire community and remove any feeling of persecution and alienation from the minds of the minorities.

 Singhs counter to a view, which sought to equate Islam with terrorism and see the issue as a clash of civilisations, was: All religions recognise the existence of certain sacred values. We should seek to highlight the commonality of such sacred values and campaign against pernicious ideas and philosophies such as the clash of civilisations...

 Singh said the strong grievance of Muslims about not being an active participant and beneficiary of processes of social and economic development was legitimate. So chief ministers must pay personal attention in ensuring that our minorities are effective partners in processes of social and economic change.

 To law-enforcers, his message was no innocent person should be victimised. Government agencies, particularly law-enforcement agencies, must establish intimate contacts with community leaders and show adequate sensitivity to their concerns. CMs ought to put in place effective mechanisms to achieve these objectives, he said.

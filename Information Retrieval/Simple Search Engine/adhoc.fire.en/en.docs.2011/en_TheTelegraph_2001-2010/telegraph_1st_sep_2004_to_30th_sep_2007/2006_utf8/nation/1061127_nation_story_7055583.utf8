 Bachchans and Ash in Varanasi

 Varanasi, Nov. 26 (PTI): Amitabh Bachchan arrived here tonight with son Abhishek and Aishwarya Rai for a puja planned early tomorrow. 

 The visit comes amid speculation about a marriage between the younger Bachchan and the actress. 

 The stars flew to the temple town with Samajwadi Party general secretary Amar Singh in a chartered plane. Amitabhs brother Ajitabh and his daughter Namrata accompanied them.

 Jaya Bachchan is alre- ady in Varanasi, shooting for Pradeep Sarkars Chood- iyan, also starring Rani Mukherjee. 

 Seven suites at the Taj Ganges had been booked for the visitors. 

 Astrologer Chandramouli Upadhyaya, who met them at the hotel for more than half-an-hour, later said Abhisheks marriage was not discussed and that the family is here to pray at Sankatmochan temple and Kashi Viswa- nath temple to overcome a problem relating to Aishwaryas horoscope.

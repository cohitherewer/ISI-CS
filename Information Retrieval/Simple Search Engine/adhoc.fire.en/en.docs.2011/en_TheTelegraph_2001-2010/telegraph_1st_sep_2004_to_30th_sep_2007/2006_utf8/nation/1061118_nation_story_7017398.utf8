 Iran in Saarc push

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 17: Iran today said it should be included in the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation as an observer, adding that it wanted to eventually become a member.

 The visiting Iran foreign minister, Manouchehr Mottaki, may well have had a twinkle in his eye as he made these remarks the US, along with China, has been made a Saarc observer.

 With America clearly on his mind, Mottaki said a third country would not be allowed to affect the relations between India and Iran. He played down the recent uneasiness in ties after Delhi voted against Tehran at the International Atomic Energy Agency.

 The minister hoped that by the end of the year Delhi and Tehran would have clinched their two big projects: a pipeline from Iran to India through Pakistan, and the supply of liquid natural gas.

 Mottaki, who is in Delhi to attend a regional summit on Afghanistan beginning tomorrow, said he had discussed both with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh yesterday. There is a serious will to implement the project and the two sides are showing flexibility on pricing.

 He ducked questions on Indo-US cooperation in the field of civil nuclear energy. I did not feel any pressure here, he said.

 Jamia spotlight on professional students

 New Delhi, July 20: As Jamia simmered today over Tuesdays clashes, students in all universities examined the role of professional student leaders ? the term used to describe those who enter varsities simply to contest union elections.

 The clashes in which a Jamia student leader was beaten up by goons, who the students alleged had been hired by the administration, started after vice-chancellor Mushirul Hassan denied admission to alleged professional student leaders. 

 Why should my classes be disrupted because of these people, who are least interested in being students, and are only interested in being leaders? asked Shweta, a mass communications student at Jamia.

 Shwetas sentiments were echoed by many in Delhi University (DU), Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) and Jamia, who believe student leaders often enrol in various courses just to become eligible to stand in union elections. 

 Student union posts in central universities like Jamia are considered lucrative, as they often help people to enter national-level politics.

 BJP leader Arun Jaitley, for instance, was DU Students Union president before he entered national politics. Similarly, the CPMs Sitaram Yechury was an active student leader at JNU.

 It is a three-year post-graduation, so I have six years (including three years of undergraduation) to contest elections, admitted a leader from one of the major student bodies, who lost an election last year but hopes to win this time. 

 Many professionals fail exams and prolong their stay in the university, and in the bargain extend their tenure as student leaders ? a reason cited by Hassan in his decision to deny admission.

 One of the men denied admission had applied to 32 courses which, according to Hassan, stunned him. Here was a person who was definitely trying to enter Jamia to stand in elections, he said.

 While disagreeing with Hassan on the Jamia controversy, Ragini Nayak, former DU student union president, says steps could be taken to change the age limit for student elections. Ragini was part of an electoral reforms committee that introduced an upper limit of 25 for contesting elections at DU two years back.

 Similar changes can be brought about in other universities like Jamia (which has no upper age limit), she said. 

 These changes, Ragini believes, are essential to prevent people from sticking around at varsities indefinitely.

 Student unions of Delhi University and JNU have joined hands with their Jamia counterparts to demand the resignation of the vice -chancellor and proctor over the clash.

 Ragini, National Students Union of India (NSUI) president Nadeem Jawed, and representatives of the JNU student union will meet human resource development minister Arjun Singh tomorrow along with Jamia students to seek the resignations and an independent inquiry.

 Jamia students have accused proctor Rocket Ibrahim of pulling out a revolver to threaten one of their leaders who had gone to see the vice-chancellor on an admission-related matter. 

 The vice-chancellor has set up a one-man committee under retired high court judge S.K. Agarwal to listen to the students grievances.

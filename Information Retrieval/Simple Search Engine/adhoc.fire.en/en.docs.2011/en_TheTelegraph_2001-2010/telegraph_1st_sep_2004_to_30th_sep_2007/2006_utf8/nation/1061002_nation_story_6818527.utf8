 Delhi gives Pak a chance

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 1: Shiv Shankar Menon, who took over as foreign secretary today, said India is ready to present evidence of Pakistans role in the Mumbai train blasts but at the right time and in the right place.

 But the government is willing to give the Indo-Pak joint anti-terror mechanism a chance in spite of the renewed chorus from the BJP and parts of the security establishment to jettison it, he suggested.

 We will see what Pakistan does about the evidence and see what their reaction is, he said. Success or failure of this mechanism will depend on what action Pakistan will take.

 It is learnt that Menon will put the proof on the table when he meets his Pakistan counterpart, Riaz Muhammad Khan, in Delhi in November.

 The evidence could include records of telephone calls made by suspects to Lashkar-e-Toiba members in Pakistan. Mumbai police are said to have details of conversations about money received from Azam Cheema, the Lashkar commander based in Bahawalpur, Pakistan, who is suspected to be the brain behind the July 11 blasts.

 Other evidence could include confessional statements of suspects and their narco-analysis test reports.

 The security establishments view is that evolving a joint mechanism of the kind proposed by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and President Pervez Musharraf in Havana last month could work on a level of parity, that is when both countries are equally committed to fighting terrorism. 

 How can you have the government (of Pakistan) itself supporting terrorism as the Mumbai blast investigations revealed? a former diplomat asked.

 But sources said the Prime Minister regards the anti-terror initiative as an important milestone in Indo-Pak relations that fructified after a lot of hard work on the ground, not just a trial balloon floated in an upsurge of bhai-bhai sentiments towards Islamabad. 

 The fact that Mumbai police, working under a Congress-led coalition, pieced together its investigations methodically in record time should leave none in doubt about the Centres earnestness and sincerity in fighting terrorism. Thats one aspect of it.

 The other is the pursuit of a macro-policy towards Indias most important neighbour. The PM has time and again iterated that we can choose our friends but not our neighbours.

 We cant live in perennial fear and paranoia of Pakistan and hope to attain a 10 per cent growth rate of the economy. Peace in the subcontinent is a vital pre-condition to achieving this target and the PM is clear about it, a source said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Thrust and parry in court

 SINGH GYANANT KUMAR

 The CBIs charges and Shibu Sorens defence

 CBI: Soren put pressure on Shashinath Jhas family to withdraw the case

 Soren: Denies the charge

 CBI: When his servant informed him that Jha was missing, Soren asked him to be calm and quiet

 Soren: Denies the charge

 CBI: Jha was Sorens private assistant and knew about the alleged deal between the Congress and the JMM to save the Narasimha Rao government

 Soren: Never paid any regular salary to Jha. The Jharkhand movement was going on in 1994 and Jha was among thousands of people who visited his MPs bungalow on Gurdwara Rakabganj Road

 CBI: Jha and Sorens wife and son were business partners

 Soren: Knew about it. Wanted to help him (Jha) settle in life

 CBI: Soren got Jha abducted from Delhi. A betel-shop owner saw two persons abducting him

 Soren: Denies the charge. One of the CBI witnesses had said that Jha was a guest in a football match in Piska Nagri

 CBI: One Charo Oraon said he had seen Nand Kishore Mehta, Ajay Kumar Mehta and Pashupati Nath Mehta and others killing Jha after having drinks at Nand Kishores house

 Soren: It was unnatural that he (Oraon) had not spoken about this even to his family for four years. And he had a criminal background

 CBI: The skeletal remains dug out from Piska Nagri near Ranchi were that of Jha

 Soren: DNA reports did not support the contention and the body had reportedly been identified by a family as that of one Alim who went missing around the same time 

 CBI: The skull superimposition report proved that the body was Jhas

 Soren: Cited an apex court ruling that DNA report is conclusive proof

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 BJP cries for Nepal

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 19: The BJP was so disturbed by Nepal refusing to remain a Hindu kingdom that it nearly declared India a Hindu state today.

 Expressing deep disappointment on the Nepalese parliaments resolution that Nepal is no longer a Hindu kingdom, the BJPs deputy leader in the Lok Sabha Vijay Kumar Malhotra stressed that India is a Hindu country.

 We are a secular nation because the majority of the population is Hindu, Malhotra said. Being secular and Hindu is the same thing.

 Asked why he was so upset by Nepal turning secular in that case, Malhotra said: What was so disturbing about Nepal being a Hindu country?

 For the exponents of the Hindu rashtra theory, Nepal was the only beacon of hope, a physical illustration of what many dismiss as mere rhetoric. The BJP used to derive vicarious satisfaction over a Hindu monarch presiding over the Himalayan kingdom.

 Yesterdays development was a big blow to the saffron party. 

 Only anti-Hindus can exult over this development. Nobody objects to at least 50 countries in the world being referred to as Islamic republics. Why such double standards? There are almost as many Hindus in the world as Muslims and Christians. Why shouldnt there be a Hindu country as well? asked Malhotra, sounding almost hysterical.

 Jaswant plea

 Jaswant Singh has approached the Supreme court for the removal of election commissioner Navin Chawla on the ground that he has links with a particular political party.

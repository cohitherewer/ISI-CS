 Karat flexes more muscles

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 12: The Left today spoke of a third alternative to the Congress and the BJP, flexing its muscles ahead of tomorrows co-ordination committee meeting with the ruling alliance.

 The CPM, which recently warned it would bring the government to its knees, said it was trying its best to build such an alternative in the near future.

 Party general secretary Prakash Karat, who met Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav yesterday, announced in Guwahati that his party had sent feelers to the democratic and secular forces in the ruling United Progressive Alliance.

 CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhan was milder. He said in Bangalore that the Congress-led coalition would be allowed to complete its five-year term despite the government violating the common minimum programme with its foreign and economic policies.

 After its politburo meeting in Calcutta, the CPM had warned the Congress that a new situation might emerge if the government voted against Iran at the International Atomic Energy Agency meeting on March 6.

 The Left has already announced a common understanding on several matters, including Iran, with the Samajwadi Party, which recently spoke of moving a no-confidence motion during the budget session over the Iran vote.

 The communists are also bristling at the governments positions on privatising airports and opening up the retail trade. Upset at being repeatedly taken for granted, they are inclined to underline that they are not part of the coalition but have been supporting the government from outside.

 What annoys the Left most is the realisation that the Congress and the government are making light of its threats, maintaining that thorny issues have always been resolved through discussions. The upcoming elections in five states could add to the tension, for in Bengal and Kerala, the Congress and the Left will be rivals.

 The battle of nerves over Iran has set up the second major rupture between the ruling alliance and its key outside ally since the Bhel divestment controversy last year. The Left had then boycotted the co-ordination committee till the government climbed down.

 The communists have also toughened their stand on airport privatisation and FDI in retail, with the CPM recently hinting at the formation of a pressure group of parties within and outside the ruling alliance. The Left backed the four-day strike by airport staff against privatisation of the Delhi and Mumbai airports.

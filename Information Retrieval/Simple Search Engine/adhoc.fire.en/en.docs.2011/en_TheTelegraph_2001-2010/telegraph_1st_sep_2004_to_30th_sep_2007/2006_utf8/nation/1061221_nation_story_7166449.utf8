 New head for Kashmirs first rebel group

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Amanullah Khan

 Jammu, Dec. 20: The Pakistan-based wing of the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF) the first militant outfit of Jammu and Kashmir has changed its chairman Amanullah Khan in the first such move since the group was formed in 1966.

 The JKLF is engaged in a military and political campaign for independence of Jammu and Kashmir from both India and Pakistan.

 The change was effected by the cabinet and central executive committee of the JKLF at its meeting on December 17, according to a JKLF release issued from its Pakistan headquarters and circulated to the media by email.

 Amanullah had co-founded this secessionist group with Maqbool Butt on the two sides of the Line of Control 40 years ago. Butt was hanged to death in Delhi for killing a CID official.

 Amanullah will be succeeded by Saghir Khan, who until now held the post of secretary-general of the JKLF.

 The step has been taken at a time when the JKLF has decided to launch a movement for self-determination from January 9 next year. It reflects a significant change on the secessionist landscape in Pakistan-controlled Kashmir.

 The decision to launch the international campaign has come at a time when Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf has offered a four-point formula on the Kashmir issue. Musharraf has ruled out the option of independence of Jammu and Kashmir a cause most dear to JKLF.

 The outfit has said Musharraf has no right to speak about the destiny of the 15 million people of Kashmir living on either side of the LoC.

 It was stated that Amanullah had desired to step down and be relieved of his responsibilities. But after heated debate, it was decided to elect him as supreme head of the group. He has been asked to oversee organisational work in general and the diplomatic wing in particular, based on full coordination and consultation with the cabinet and the central executive committee of the outfit.

 The release, circulated to media in both Indian and Pakistan Kashmir, was issued by Raja Mazhar Iqbal Khan, information secretary of the JKLF. The movement will be political and peaceful and its preparatory phase will start on January 9, 2007, it stated.

 PDP fatality count

 The Peoples Democractic Party (PDP) in Jammu and Kashmir has suffered the most in terms of political killings in the state, a top intelligence source said, reports PTI.

 The party lost as many as 78 leaders and activists to militancy in the past four years of the PDP-Congress coalition government, the source said.

 The highest number of 78 political leaders and activists including one minister of PDP were killed during nearly past four years period, between January 1, 2003 to October 12, 2006, the source said.

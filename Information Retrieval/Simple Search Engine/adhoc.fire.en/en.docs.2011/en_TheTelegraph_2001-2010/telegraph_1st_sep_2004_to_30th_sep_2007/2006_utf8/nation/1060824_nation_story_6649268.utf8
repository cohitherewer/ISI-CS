 Students face ragging glare

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 23: In the first major incident of ragging in Delhi this year, a case has been lodged against two students of the School of Planning and Architecture for ragging a fresher.

 Aviral Dikshit and Nikhil Saxena, both third year B.Arch students of the countrys apex architecture school, have been suspended by the institute apart from being fined, after Ankit Gautam, a fresher, complained they had humiliated him.

 The institute authorities, however, clarified to The Telegraph today that the alleged culprits had not been rusticated.

 The alleged incident happened on the night of August 10, the day Ankit had joined the institute and its Maharani Bagh hostel.

 The institute authorities as well as police had, however, kept mum about the incident.

 Ankit has left the institute and gone home with his father.

 We have lodged an FIR after the victim alleged physical punishment, harassment and abuse, said DCP (South Delhi) Anil Shukla.

 Ankit and his father a lieutenant colonel in the army had come to the capital earlier in the day from Patna, the police said. After completing admission formalities, Ankits father is believed to have dropped him off at the hostel.

 According to the FIR, Ankit was taken along with 25 other students girls and boys to a seniors room around 9.30 pm. 

 There we were divided into groups of four three boys and one girl per group. We were then asked to enact Kamasutra poses, alleged Ankit in the FIR.

 Ankit apparently refused, whereupon he was asked to crawl up the stairs of the building, the police said.

 Close to 20 students were hauled up by the institutes administration initially for the incident but only Aviral and Nikhil have been suspended following an internal inquiry.

 The police said Ankit identified Aviral and Nikhil as those who threatened him to do as told.

 Students at the hostel, however, deny Ankit was made to perform acts against his will. They (the students) were all called up for interaction. It is completely untrue that they were asked to undress or that they were asked to do anything forcibly, said Rajneesh Sanghvi, a third year student at the hostel.

 Shukla, too, confirmed that the students had not been asked to undress. On asking other freshers, it seems clear they were not asked to undress, he said.

 In August 2004, the institute was reprimanded after freshers were allegedly made to enact sexual intercourse with a dog.

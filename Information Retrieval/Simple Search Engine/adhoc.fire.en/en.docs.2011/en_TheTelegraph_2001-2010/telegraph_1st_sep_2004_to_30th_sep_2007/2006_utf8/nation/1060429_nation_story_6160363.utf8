 Marxist rises above party

 Palakkad, April 28: Rising again after recent reverses at the hands of CPM colleagues, V.S. Achuthanandan seems to have acquired a larger-than-life image, outgrowing his party in the process.

 The Kerala Opposition leaders public meetings appear to be a throwback to MGRs rallies in Tamil Nadu where crowds would prostrate themselves before their leader.

 The near-martyrdom thrust on Achuthanandan by the party politburo, which denied him an Assembly ticket only to backtrack, seems to have turned him into a favourite of the cadre and the crowds.

 He follows a gruelling campaign schedule, addressing some 50 rallies as he travels in an open van in the sweltering summer of palm-dotted Palakkad. His chief aide Shajahan says: Its the people that make him tick.

 The past five years have witnessed an image makeover by the doughty crusader for public grievances. Middle-class families who would switch TV channels whenever Achuthanandan appeared on the screen with his characteristic drone are now waiting to catch a glimpse of him.

 His comeback has been phoenix-like after his faction was trounced at the CPM state party conference last year. His loyalists were kicked out of the CPM state secretariat and other party forums and he was removed as chief editor of party organ Deshabhimani.

 But Achuthanandan outsmarted the party by breaking out of its confines and appealing to the people directly, aided by the bite-and-visuals-starved TV channels.

 This man has made himself a regular fixture in the living rooms of most families, cutting across caste and religion, Sundaresa Menon, a cousin of CPM general secretary Prakash Karat, said.

 Menon wont bet his money on the margin of victory for Achuthanandan, though, because the people are inscrutable. In the 2001 Assembly election, Achuthanandans majority in Malampuzha had plummeted from nearly 19,000 votes to less than 5,000.

 The sudden popularity of the 82-year-old doctrinaire Marxist is causing consternation among the party brass. Karat has felt compelled to explain away the Achuthanandan wave as an LDF (the CPM-led Left Democratic Front) wave. 

 But its clear that Achuthanandan is the elections outstanding crowd-puller.

 Many, however, feel Achuthanandan has turned his back on the crucial question of development. While he continues to champion public issues, he seems to smell a rat in every development proposal mooted by Congress chief minister Oommen Chandy.

 But during election time, voters seem to develop a fondness for spectacle and theatre. Achuthanandan has a clear edge in this unlike Chandy, whos into serious campaigns for development.

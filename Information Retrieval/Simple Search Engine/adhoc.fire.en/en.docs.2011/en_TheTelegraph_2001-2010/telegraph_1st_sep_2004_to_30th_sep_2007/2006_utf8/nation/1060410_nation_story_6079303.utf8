 Indian doctors in UK protest

 London, April 9 (PTI): About 300 doctors of Indian origin plan to hold a demonstration outside Britains health department on April 21 to protest against new rules making work permits mandatory for non-EU medical practitioners to work in the National Health Service (NHS) from July.

 So far, doctors from outside the EU, including those from India, were able to take up NHS jobs under permit-free-training schemes.

 The protest is being organised by the British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin (Bapio), which has a membership of over 25,000.

 Buddhdev Pandya, honorary corporate adviser of Bapio, said the new rule would affect over 4,000 doctors, many of whom have families in the UK. Any doctor wishing to apply for postgraduate medical training in the UK will also be required to have a work permit.

 Work permits will not be easy to get. To obtain a permit, an employer must show that existing vacancies cannot be filled with a resident doctor.

 In the case of overseas doctors, EU nationals will get preference. Even Indian general physicians who have listed for training for consultancy jobs are now in difficulty. They would be passed over by EU doctors, said Dr Shiv Pande, the only Asian to have ever held an executive post in the British General Medical Council.

 This makes it almost impossible for new doctors from India (to get a job) and even the 800-and-odd unemployed Indian doctors who are already here hoping to get a training assignment will now have to pack up and go once their visa expires, he said.

 At present, 117,036 overseas doctors, including 16,000 NRI doctors, work in the British government-funded health service.

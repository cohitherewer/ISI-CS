 - CPM circulates note to all parties to join hands against US deal

 New Delhi, July 23: The CPM today launched an initiative to rally all parties, including the BJP, to force the Centre to stand up to Washingtons pressure on the Indo-US civil nuclear energy cooperation deal.

 A day before Parliaments monsoon session begins, CPM general secretary Prakash Karat said his party would spare no effort to get Parliament to express its mind on the US Senate bill on the deal.

 The CPM fears that the new conditions in the US Senate and House of Representatives bills, introduced over and above the clauses in the original July 2005 deal, would erode Indias sovereignty and the independence of its foreign policy and hobble its nuclear programme. 

 For instance, US lawmakers now want a moratorium on the production of fissile material by India for purposes of nuclear explosions. 

 The CPM has sent a six-page note, titled Indo-US nuclear deal: changes not acceptable, to all parties, outlining its objections to the way the government has handled the negotiations.

 We have written to all political parties. (This) is not a party issue. It has vital national importance, Karat said.

 The Left, however, will not have any formal floor coordination with the National Democratic Alliance. Yet, it isnt shy of discussing with the NDA ? and perhaps with Congress MPs unhappy with the negotiations ? a tactic that may force the Centre to take a second look at the deal.

 The CPMs main objective is to force the Centre to lay down the parameters within which the nuclear deal would be acceptable to Parliament.

 The formal agreement is still not signed. We have to define the parameters of the deal and convey the sense of the House, Karat said.

 The Prime Minister will be under direct pressure since the nub of the CPMs argument is that the draft US bills fly in the face of the assurances Manmohan Singh gave to Parliament on July 25 last year.

 The sense of House is binding on a ruling party. During the Vajpayee governments tenure, then home minister L.K. Advani was forced to drop his plans of sending troops to Iraq at Washingtons request after Parliament passed a resolution against the proposal.

 Karat didnt spell out if his party was planning to get a resolution passed in both Houses. All that will be worked out later. CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury has discussed such a resolution with two former foreign ministers, the BJPs Jaswant Singh and the Congresss Natwar Singh.

 The Left also wants a constitutional amendment that allows Parliament to discuss and ratify any treaty signed with a foreign government.

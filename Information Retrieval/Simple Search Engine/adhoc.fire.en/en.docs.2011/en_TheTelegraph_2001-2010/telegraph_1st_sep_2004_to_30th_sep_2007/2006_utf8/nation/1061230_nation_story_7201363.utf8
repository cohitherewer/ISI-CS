 February poll, minus UP

 OUR BUREAU 

 New Delhi, Dec. 29: The Election Commission has announced the dates for Assembly polls in Manipur, Punjab and Uttaranchal, but decided to hold elections in Uttar Pradesh separately, possibly in the last week of April.

 Manipur will have three-phased polls on February 8, 15 and 23. Elections in Punjab will be held on February 13 and in Uttaranchal on February 21. 

 Votes in the three states will be counted on February 27, chief election commissioner N. Gopalaswami said here today. Manipur has 60 Assembly seats, Punjab 117 and Uttaranchal 70. With the dates announced, the model code of conduct has come into effect. 

 Gopalaswami said the terms of the Assemblies in the three states expire in March. Uttar Pradesh, where the legislature has time until May 14, is likely to have three-phased polls around the end of April. 

 The commission sought substantial paramilitary forces for Uttar Pradesh, but the Centre said it could spare them only after March, sources said, explaining the plan for separate polls in the state. 

 A large number of paramilitary forces will be required for the elections in Manipur, Punjab and Uttaranchal, the sources said. The month-long National Games in Assam also begin on February 7 under the shadow of an Ulfa threat. 

 Gopalaswami side-stepped questions on whether special measures are needed in Uttar Pradesh, where political parties have been demanding Presidents rule to ensure free and fair polls. 

 We will talk about Uttar Pradesh when we come to it, the chief election commissioner said, adding that the commission would asses how and when polls could be held. 

 Asked if Presidents rule was required in view of the states law and order situation, he said: We have nothing to do with Presidents rule. 

 He said the commission had been able to take 25 lakh dead voters off electoral rolls in a clean-up operation that has been reasonably successful. The date for the final revision of rolls in Uttar Pradesh has been extended to January 15. 

 In the Manipur, Punjab and Uttaranchal polls, Gopalaswamy said central paramilitary forces and police drawn from other states will be deployed. 

 The commission will monitor the ground situation closely and will take appropriate measures to ensure peaceful, free and fair elections.

 Gopalaswami said digital cameras will be installed inside sensitive polling stations. The commission will also depute observers, who will keep a watch on constituencies.

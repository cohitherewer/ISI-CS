 Indian sailor killed, no cartoon link yet

 P.V. VIVEKANAND

 Dubai, Feb. 15: An Indian sailor has been found battered to death aboard a Norwegian vessel in international waters off the coast of Fujairah, one of the emirates in the seven-member United Arab Emirates.

 But there was no indication that the apparent killing was the result of a dispute over cartoons of Prophet Mohammad in the European press.

 While it was reported in the local press that the man, identified as Sudheer Nonia Jagannath, 31, who hailed from Karnataka but lived in Mumbai, got into a scuffle over the controversial cartoons, police investigations and information available with the Indian consulate-general in Dubai did not indicate such a link.

 We are so far not aware of any cartoon link in the affair, said consul-general Yash Sinha. The matter is under investigation by Fujairah police.

 The cartoons angle to the death came in a report carried by a Dubai-based newspaper.

 According to reliable sources, the fight among the seamen, which caused the death of one sailor, emerged after an argument between them over their differences of opinions over the slanderous and blasphemous cartoon on (the) Prophet Mohammad, said the paper.

 Fujairah police got involved in the case only because the emirate was the nearest coast to the vessel, Champion, which was in international waters after delivering chemicals from Mangalore in India to Fujairah. It was proceeding to Kuwait to pick up another shipment.

 The ship had 21 crew members and seven of them, including captain Jitender Malhotra, are now in Fujairah police custody. Two of the others were identified as Sunit Bhola and M.G. Singh. The names of the others were not immediately available.

 The body was found on the deck of the ship when an inspection party went aboard the vessel. The body bore marks of heavy blows to the skull and other parts.

 Police sent the body for post-mortem and detained the captain and crew members.

 Malhotra told police Jagannath got into a fight with fellow crew members and had to be restrained ? meaning bound and tied up aboard the ship, as permitted under maritime law. The next thing he knew was finding Jagannath battered up.

 Further segments of Malhotras testimony were not available, including why the scuffle took place. Fujairah police declined any comment on the case until investigations were completed.

 However, another member of the crew told a local reporter during a short exchange that the crew was drinking heavily before the fight. Again, it was not clear who were involved in the fight.

 According to a preliminary list, there was only one Muslim and one Christian among the crew; all others were Hindus.

 Naushad pardon

 The stage is set for the release of Indian national Naushad who was slapped with an eye-for-an-eye punishment in Saudi Arabia for attacking a Saudi three years ago, reports PTI.

 Naushads wife Suhaila said Indian embassy officials have confirmed that a Sharia court in Dammam had approved the legal formalities sparing Naushad after he was pardoned by the aggrieved person. 

 Allah has heard our prayers. My husband would be released from jail soon. That is what those officials who called from Saudi Arabia said, Suhaila said.

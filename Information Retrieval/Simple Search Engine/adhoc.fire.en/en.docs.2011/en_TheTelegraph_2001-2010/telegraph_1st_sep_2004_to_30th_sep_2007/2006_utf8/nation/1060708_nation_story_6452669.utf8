 ABHIJEET CHATTERJEE

 Asansol (Bengal), July 7: The Centre has agreed to include a Rs 1,529-crore project for the development of Asansol and Durgapur in its National Urban Renewal Mission. 

 Around Rs 400 crore will be spent on water supply and drainage, over Rs 400 crore on living conditions in the region of Burdwan district famous for its coal reserves and Rs 692 crore on infrastructure projects, Asansol-Durgapur Development Authority chairman Bansagopal Chowdhury said today.

 The project designed by IIT Kharagpur will be completed in seven years. 

 Of the total funds required, the urban renewal miss- ion will provide Rs 764 crore and the state urban development department Rs 364 crore. The development authority and the civic bodies there would jointly raise Rs 401 crore through partnerships with private investors. 

 The Burdwan district administration received the Centres formal communication agreeing to fund the project last week. We had submitted the project to the Centre early this year. We hope to begin work early next year, Chowdhury said. 

 The first phase would include new water supply networks for Asansol, Jamuria, Ranigunj and Durgapur towns, upgrade of drainage systems, dredging of the Garui and beautification of its banks. 

 A draft plan prepared by the IIT had said that the areas under the authority would need an additional 100 million gallons of drinking water every day by 2025 and the drainage and sewerage networks need immediate upgrade.

 In the second phase, new industrial and housing projects would be developed. 

 The IIT study had predicted that the population of around 45.5 lakh in the region would go up by another 19 lakh by 2025. 

 In the third phase, two ring roads would be built in Asansol and Durgapur. Bypasses and link roads would be built in Asansol, Ranigunj, Jamuria and Ukhra and flyovers in Asansol and Durgapur. Hawkers along GT Road in Asansol will be shifted to the outskirts of the town, 240 km from Calcutta.

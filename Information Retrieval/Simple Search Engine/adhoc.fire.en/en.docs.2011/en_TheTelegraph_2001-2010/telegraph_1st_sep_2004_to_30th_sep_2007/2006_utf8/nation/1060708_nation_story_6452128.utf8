 SRK house

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, July 7: The Supreme Court today dismissed a petition seeking to stop Shah Rukh Khan from constructing a multi-storeyed complex next to his house, which is a heritage building.

 A social activist group based in suburban Bandra, where the actor lives, had filed a petition accusing Shah Rukh of using his wealth and influence to get clearance from the authorities concerned and blocking the site of the heritage building.

 Petitioner Cyril Thomas asked the apex court to direct the Mumbai municipal corporation to disallow the construction. 

 The court said there was nothing illegal about building the complex and upheld a Bombay High Court order dismissing the petition.

 Environmentalist lawyer Y.P Singh said it was not possible now to file a fresh petition in the apex court avoiding the points mentioned in the current dismissed one. The current one talks about the heritage status of the building only. But there has also been a violation of Coastal Regulatory Zone guidelines, which has not been brought up. 

 According to the guidelines, a 500-metre distance has to be maintained between the coastline and a concrete structure.

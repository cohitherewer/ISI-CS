 Ganga report reminder to Bengal

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 10: The Supreme Court today directed Bengal and other Ganga-basin states to file status reports on the implementation of the Ganga Action Plan, a 21-year-old scheme aimed at cleaning the river.

 A bench headed by Chief Justice Y. K. Sabharwal took note of CAGs 2006 report that highlighted the deterioration in the quality of water. It asked the environment ministry to file a status report by November 15.

 On March 31, the court had sought reports from all parties concerned within four weeks, but has received no response so far. The court directive followed submissions from amicus curiae Kishan Mahajan, who said there had been no significant change in water quality even after spending Rs 1,000 crore.

 The next hearing has been fixed for the last week of November. Other than Bengal, the court notices were sent to Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh and Uttaranchal.

 Mahajan cited the CAG report, which said the environment ministry had stopped the practice of monitoring water quality. Only 45 per cent of the industries that spewed filth into the Ganga had effluent-treatment plants. To make matters worse, 80 per cent of those machines were not functioning properly, the report said. 

 The court expressed concern that monitoring at the central and state levels had stopped. It also frowned on the fact that Bengal was yet to send a report on whether tanneries in Calcutta had set up effluent-treatment plants.

 The judges ticked off the environment ministry for not sending a representative to the hearing. 

 A law officer to put forth its views should be present next time, they said.

 Earlier, the apex court was told that that people living on the banks of the 2500-km-long river often suffered from water-borne diseases such as typhoid and dysentery.

 Central Pollution Control Board lawyer Vijay Panjwani said the responsibility for implementing the scheme rested with states. The Centres role was limited to financing, he said.

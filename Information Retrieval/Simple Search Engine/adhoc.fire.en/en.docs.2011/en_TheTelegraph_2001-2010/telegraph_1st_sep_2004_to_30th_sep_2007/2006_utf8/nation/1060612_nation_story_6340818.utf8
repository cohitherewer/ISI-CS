 Scare and stick for airline

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, June 11: The 

 windshield of an Air Deccan flight cracked mid-air, prompting 

 Calcutta airport to make preparations for an emergency drill 

 but the plane landed safely.

 Flight DN 681, carrying 182 passengers, was going from Calcutta to Mumbai but had to turn back because of the crack, which led to a fall in pressure inside the aircraft.

 The Airbus 320 took off from Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose airport in Calcutta at 5.52 pm. At 6.30 pm, when the plane was flying 100 km west of Jamshedpur, the pilot contacted the air traffic control in Calcutta and reported the damage to the windshield and the consequent fall in cabin pressure. 

 The aircraft was flying at 36,000 feet when the windshield cracked. The pilot requested for an emergency descent, an airport official said. The aircraft then descended to 23,000 feet and further down to 21,000 feet.

 The aircraft is made to lose altitude to ensure that passengers do not face any inconvenience due to shortage of oxygen and the crack does not widen, the official said.

 The ground staff at Calcutta airport was kept on alert. Preparations were made for an emergency landing, the official said. Fire tenders and ambulances were kept on stand-by. However, the flight did not require emergency support and landed at 7.30 pm. The flight was cancelled for the day. 

 Damages over delay 

 A consumer court has ordered Air Deccan to pay Rs 30,000 in damages to a Delhi-based businessman for inconveniences caused by a delay in flight schedule and poor on-board customer service, adds PTI.

 Acting on the complaint of Rakesh Kwatra, the Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum (north) headed by K.K. Chopra observed: Low-budget service does not mean passengers should not be offered drinking water ... The repeated statement that they (Air Deccan) run a low-cost airline does not absolve them of their responsibility of supplying basic amenities to passengers.

 Following an admission in court by the airline that it had so many defective planes, the forum also cautioned it to improve the maintenance of its fleet.

 Kwatra, who was flying to Chennai on the evening of May 25 last year, complained to the court that all passengers were left stranded for over seven hours at the airport. This was after they had checked in on time and were issued boarding passes.

 Katara said passengers were cold-shouldered by the flight crew, who refused to serve even a bottle of water. Kwatras repeated complaints via e-mail to the airlines CEO were ignored.

 Brushing aside Air Deccans defence that it was still in its infancy and growing as a low-cost business model, the forum said the onus of providing passenger comfort and safety was on the airline.

 The fact that the airline had issued boarding passes to all passengers without informing them of the delay in flight plans showed deficiency of service on its part, the court said. It also ordered the airline to pay Kwatra Rs 1,000 in litigation costs.

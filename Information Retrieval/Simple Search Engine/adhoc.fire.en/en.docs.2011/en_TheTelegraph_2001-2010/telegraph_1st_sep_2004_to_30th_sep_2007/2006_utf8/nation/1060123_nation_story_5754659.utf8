 Mega show? Groan

 Hyderabad, Jan. 22: Three mega events in three weeks have left Hyderabad groaning under the weight of endless traffic diversions, security checks and prohibitory orders ? and constant chaos.

 The Indian Science Congress in the first week of the year was quickly followed by the Pravasi Bharatiya Divas. Now with the Congress plenary disrupting his daily life, the citizen is begging not any more.

 One more mega event like this will bring down the city administration and the police force, both of whom have been under tremendous pressure since the start of the year, said mayor Tegala Krishna Reddy.

 Most local officials say they are too drained by overwork to talk.

 I havent slept for the past 10 days and cannot afford to sleep for another two. What a month! a senior official groaned at the district collectors office.

 Visitors arent any better off: thousands of business tourists are stranded without rooms as the Congress has booked almost all the decent hotels, clubs and guesthouses.

 We would rather have bandhs and agitations than these super-conventions and political conferences, said Rukmini Naidu, a schoolteacher fed up with the traffic curbs and security checks.

 The scale of arrangements for the VIPs comfort is mind-boggling. For instance, 46 synthetic chemical toilets have been imported from Italy. But its the security that has overshadowed everything else.

 The state government has clamped prohibitory orders under Section 144 around Hyderabad, Secunderabad, Ranga Reddy and Medak districts for one week.

 Four CRPF and four CISF companies have cordoned off a 3-square-mile area around the venue for the plenary, which has drawn some 12,000 delegates.

 The organisers have made double ID cards compulsory for entry.

 Bear with us; we cannot violate the security code in view of the risk perceptions made out by the agencies, Congress secretary Ambika Soni had appealed on the eve of the plenary.

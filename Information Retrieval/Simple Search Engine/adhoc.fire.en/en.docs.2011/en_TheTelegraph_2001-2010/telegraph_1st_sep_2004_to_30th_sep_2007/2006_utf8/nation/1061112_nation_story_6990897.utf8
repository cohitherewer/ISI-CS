 Damages rap on cell provider

 New Delhi (PTI): A consumer forum has 

 held MTNL-owned Garuda Mobile Services guilty of deficiency 

 in service to a subscriber who complained of weak signals 

 and a defective handset.

 The forum has asked the service provider to get the phone repaired and give the complainant a compensation of Rs 4,000.

 There was some network problem in the area of the complainant which affected the service and there also appears to be some problem with the handset, said the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum (south-west).

 The attitude of the service provider does not appear to be consumer-friendly in view of its statement that the complainant can surrender the handset if the same had become a liability, it added.

 Wall drives priest to court

 Thiruvananthapuram (PTI): A 

 priest of the local Vishnu temple moved court following 

 a boundary dispute with his neighbour. 

 The entrance to Sunderajan Pottis home was closed after his neighbour blocked a narrow passage between their houses by building a wall.

 Since then, Potti has had to climb a high wall to enter his house. His mother had to move out as she couldnt balance herself on the narrow wall.

 The neighbour had got a court order to build the wall, Potti said. There was a passage when I purchased the plot a few years ago. I did not know about the boundary dispute. 

 Pottis attempt to win over his neighbour by purchasing a piece of land for a passage did not work.

 Airport alarm

 Chennai (PTI): An unclaimed 

 suitcase next to an airlines counter created a flutter 

 at the domestic airport here, police said.

 CISF officials noticed the suitcase and a bomb disposal squad was called. But the suitcase was found to contain only papers and clothes.

 Arrest warrants

 Pratapgarh (PTI): Non-bailable 

 arrest warrants have been issued against Uttar Pradesh minister 

 Raghuraj Pratap Singh, Samajwadi Party MP Akshay Pratap 

 Singh and 25 others for failing to appear in court for the 

 hearing of three cases pending against them. The hearing 

 will resume on November 17.

 Fake passport

 Thrissur (PTI): A Pakistani 

 national was arrested allegedly with a fake Indian passport. 

 Mohammed Ali came to India last year on a visit visa and 

 overstayed. He managed to get the fake passport from Malappuram, 

 police said.

 Lage Raho Munnabhai, screened on Friday 

 to mark the 100th year of Mahatma Gandhis first satyagraha, 

 became the first full-length Indian film to be shown in 

 the UN auditorium.

 Lalu brushes off IIM advice

 New Delhi (PTI): They may be the brains running the countrys premier B-schools, but their ideas are no good for Lalu Prasad.

 The railway minister on Thursday politely turned down suggestions offered by a group of academicians from Indian Institutes of Management on how to run his ministry. He told them that his organisation was already full of talented people.

 The team led by IIM Ahmedabad professor G. Raghuram, who was part of an official committee that predicted the railways would incur a Rs 60,000 crore debt in the next 10 years and slip into bankruptcy, suggested that Lalu Prasad appoint an advisory board for the ministry.

 Raghuram said the board should have experts from the Indian Institutes of Technology, the IIMs and other universities and they should interact regularly.

 Sensing that their mission was going off track, the delegates then tried to massage Lalu Prasads ego. They suggested that he take on the title of CEO of Indian Railways following its spectacular performance during the two years he has been at his helm.

 he minister, under whose tenure the railways has generated Rs 13,000 crore worth internal resources and surplus revenue of Rs 11,000 crore, brushed off the compliment, saying: Sincere efforts accomplished with honesty will bring about progress and development of any organisation.

 The IIM team would also be attending the two-day general managers conference to be inaugurated by Lalu Prasad here on Friday.

 Body exhumed

and buried by her husband, was dug out in a village of this district on the instructions

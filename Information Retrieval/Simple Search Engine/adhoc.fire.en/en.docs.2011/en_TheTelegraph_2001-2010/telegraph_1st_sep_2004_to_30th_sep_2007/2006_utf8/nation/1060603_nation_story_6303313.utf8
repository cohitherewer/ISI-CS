 Calcutta, June 2: Legally, hes not allowed to drive but the 17-year-old schoolboy is talking of trips of a different kind.

 I was prescribed benzodiazepines before my board exams as I had difficulty going to sleep. Now, I cant sleep without popping at least two pills every night, Veer says.

 He casually mentions hes tried cocaine, too, but at Rs 4,000 a gram the price is a little too steep for regular snorts.

 Drug abuse is rising among Calcuttas young. Walk into any nightclub and youre likely to see men and women high on Ecstasy, LSD or the date rape drugs Rohypnol (a benzodiazepine derivative) and GHB.

 And if they want to really live it up, they can mix champagne with cocaine or a Jim Beam a brand of bourbon whisky with heroin for a quick high. Called speedballs, these dangerous mixes can often lead to fatal overdoses.

 LSD, magic mushrooms and ecstasy are the most popular drugs at city night spots and private parties. Calcutta doesnt have a cocaine dealer network, so snorters have to fly to Delhi or Mumbai to get the stuff, which is then shared among a select crowd behind closed doors.

 Cocaine is a social drug. But you can share it only with people you know well, maybe at a closed-door party, said someone whos a regular on the citys social circuit. At Rs 4,000 a gram, not many can afford cocaine, though.

 How do the young men and women get hooked?

 In most instances, the addiction starts off with tobacco. From smoking cigarettes, a child may progress to cannabis and alcohol before moving on to harder drugs such as cocaine, psychiatrist Joy Ranjan Ram said. This is called the gateway effect.

 Peer pressure is a prime reason for the young taking to drugs, Ram said. Cultural influences are another.

 Taking drugs is less of a taboo now than 20 years ago. Use of hard drugs is even considered cool or seen as a sign of liberation.

 Narcotic trafficking has increased sharply in Bengal. Chinese and Myanmarese drug rings have set up shop in Calcutta, which lies on the international trafficking route.

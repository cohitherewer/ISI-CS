 Army count storm rages

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 17: The second day of the budget session saw Parliament turn into a battlefield with both the ruling coalition and its rivals firing with equal aggression.

 While a war of words raged in the Lok Sabha over a survey commissioned by the UPA government on the socio-economic status of Muslims in all government institutions, including the armed forces, members in the upper House almost came to blows.

 When the BJP hurled a communal headcount charge, the Congress did not hesitate to hit back. If there is any party responsible for bringing religion into votebank politics, it is you, defence minister Pranab Mukherjee said, wagging a finger at the Opposition.

 The House had to be adjourned for 10 minutes as soon as it met this morning.

 The Opposition demanded a summary withdrawal of the survey in the armed forces. But the government refused point blank. 

 The Sachar committee has been set up to get authentic and updated data about the socio-economic condition of the Muslim community. The committee will recommend steps that could help improve their status, Mukherjee said. 

 There had been disquiet within the Congress, particularly in its minority cell, over the Prime Ministers defence of the commission. 

 In the Rajya Sabha, BJP leader Jaswant Singh described the survey as a fraud on the people of the country.

 But the debate took an unsavoury turn when the BJPs Sharad Joshi described Samajwadi Party member Shahid Siddiqui as a Muslim League man. An offended Siddiqui rushed to the well threatening to tear off his own shirt. 

 The din led to the adjournment of the House twice.

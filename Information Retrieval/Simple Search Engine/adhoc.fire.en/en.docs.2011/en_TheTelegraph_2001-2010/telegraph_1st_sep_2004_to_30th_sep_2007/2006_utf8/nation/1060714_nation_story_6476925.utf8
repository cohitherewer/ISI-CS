 Modi for mission Mumbai

 POORNIMA JOSHI

New Delhi, July 13: The BJP has decided to depute Narendra Modi to lead the partys campaign against terrorism in Mumbai.

 With fingers being pointed at Pakistan-based terror groups and Gujaratis reportedly being their principal targets, the BJP believes the ground is fertile for a fresh Hindu consolidation in Maharashtra.

 The gradual erosion of Bal Thackerays authority also seems to have been a guiding factor in the partys attempts to poach on the Shiv Senas base.

 The BJPs two-day countrywide campaign against terrorism is to commence on July 15. 

 Prominent party leaders, except Atal Bihari Vajpayee, would be travelling to various states to enthuse the cadre. 

 BJP president Rajnath Singh is going to Nagpur while Murli Manohar Joshi has been asked to go to Lucknow. Jaswant Singh would be headed for Bangalore and Sushma Swaraj is to lead the campaign in Delhi. L.K. Advani is heading the campaign in Ahmedabad and Bhopal.

 The announcement of Modis name for the campaign follows a resolution by the partys office-bearers that blamed the UPA for Tuesdays blasts in Mumbai.

 The BJPs foot-soldiers mounted a more shrill offensive today against the governments alleged soft stand on terrorism. 

 Party spokesperson Prakash Javdekar raised the pitch by pressing for a policy of hot pursuit against Pakistan.

 The office-bearers resolution clearly asks for a no-compromise stand on terrorism. The government has not been able to bind Pakistan to the commitment it made to Atal Bihari Vajpayee on January 4, 2004. Pakistan foreign minister Khurshid Mehmood Kasuris statement is an example of how Pakistan is flouting the agreement. We should follow a policy of hot pursuit towards Pakistan, said Javdekar.

 Ironically, the original promoter of hot pursuit, Advani, relied on Sudheendra Kulkarni yesterday to chart a moderate course. 

 While the party top brass blamed the UPA for the terror strikes, Advani said the time was not right to criticise the government. His statement was reportedly drafted by Kulkarni.

 Kulkarnis has not been a welcome presence in the BJP since the Jinnah controversy last year. 

 He was blamed for Advanis Jinnah is secular spiel that cost him the party presidents job. 

 Though Kulkarni has since been stripped of the BJP secretarys post, he continues to be in Advanis good books.

 But the BJP is not buying Advanis line. Sources said his statement in Mumbai yesterday is largely being perceived as yet another attempt to paint a different image for himself. 

 He may have done it to appeal to a different constituency. Because of Kulkarnis association, all these efforts are going to backfire, said sources.

 The prevalent mood in the party is to channelise the widespread anger and frustration into consolidating the Hindu vote.

 Advani may have felt that the situation in Mumbai was not suited to make a political statement. 

 The BJP is clearly more interested in what Modi is likely to say in Mumbai on July 15.

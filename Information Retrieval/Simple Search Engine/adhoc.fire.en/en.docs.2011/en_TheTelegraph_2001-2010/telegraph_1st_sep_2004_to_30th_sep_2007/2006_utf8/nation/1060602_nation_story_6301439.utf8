 Panic floods Mumbai

 Mumbai, June 1: Memories of last Julys deluge still fresh on his mind, a second day of rain with flooded lanes was enough for PCO operator Shravan to begin panicking.

 When I got back home yesterday, my tenement was under at least six inches of water. This morning when I came to my PCO, it was the same story, the resident of suburban Mankhurd said.

 The phone line is down, and I havent done any business today. I shudder to think how Im going to survive this monsoon with my family.

 But although low-lying areas stayed flooded, there was much less waterlogging than yesterday. 

 Were going to be more prepared this time; there will be no repeat of last monsoon, municipal commissioner Johnny Joseph said.

 But Shravan wasnt convinced.

 This is just the beginning of the monsoon ? the very first day. And despite all the promises made by the government and civic authorities, nothing has changed for us, he said in his back-alley booth in Bandra-Kurla, home to some of the slickest corporate offices and next door to Asias biggest slum, Dharavi.

 Upscale south Mumbai, the business district, stayed largely unaffected. Traffic, however, was disrupted in some parts as Wednesdays rain had brought down some huge trees.

 Thursday has seen less rainfall than Wednesday, but the rain alert continues and we predict more heavy showers in the next 30 hours, said meteorological department director Sati Devi.

 Devi said the Colaba observatory had recorded 118 mm of rain from 8.30 am yesterday till 8.30 am today, while the Santacruz observatory had recorded 180.4 mm.

 Suburban trains ran late but most flights were on schedule barring minor delays early in the morning.

 Although parts of Greater Mumbai continued to experience heavy power cuts, the authorities blamed it on the long-standing power shortage.

 Mobile subscribers complained of poor network coverage but telecom operators denied. I havent heard about network failures on Thursday. But I must point out that we have made detailed arrangements to avoid network-related problems during the rainy season, said Bharti telecom spokesperson Mrinal K. Dey.

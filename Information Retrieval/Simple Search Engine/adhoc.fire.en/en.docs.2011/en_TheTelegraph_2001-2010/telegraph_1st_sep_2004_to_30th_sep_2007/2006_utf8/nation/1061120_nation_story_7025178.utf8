 Prince on bike rips up greens

 Kathmandu, Nov. 19: His conversion to golf was touted as a lifestyle change away from the binges, bust-ups and fast cars to leisurely strolls on the greens and genteel conversation.

 This weekend, crown prince Paras vroomed onto the turf at Kathmandus exclusive Le Meridien Gokarna golf course, zigzagging across its hallowed landscape on his Harley Davidson as international diplomats and venerable elderly gentlemen watched in horror.

 After months of lying low since a popular revolution ousted his father as absolute monarch, the wayward prince was back to life in the fast lane, ready again to ride roughshod over whatever stood in his way. 

 Unmindful of the players and whizzing balls, he scorched through the course on his high-powered bike, followed by security men in his familiar amphibious vehicle.

 The company on the greens included leading Kathmandu-based diplomats and expatriates. It was absolutely shocking to see the crown princes daylight antics on the golf course. He not only violated golfing norms but also posed severe security hazards for us, said a diplomat who didnt wish to be named.

 Soon after Paras left, his security brought out his three children for a ride across the greens in the amphibious vehicle. This led to more looks of shocked incredulity all around, for the children could have been hit by the flying balls.

 There was no disguising the changed times, though. Seven months ago the golfers would have stopped playing, but now many continued with their game.

 The hot-headed Paras, notorious for boozing and nightclub brawls, had taken to golf since early last year in what was clearly a palace effort to give the future king an image makeover.

 The prince did seem to acquire some polish, inviting diplomats to games and managing to stay on his best behaviour, even earning polite praise for his good manners and suavity.

 But with the monarchy emasculated and Parliament claiming the right to choose the royal heir threatening to push the throne for ever outside his reach Paras perhaps saw no need for a refined image any more.

 After the family had had their fill of rides, they and their guards returned to the Gokarna forest palace where Paras, wife Himani and their children were spending the weekend.

 But not before Princess Himani, who belongs to the royal family of Sikar in Rajasthan, had taken a few lessons from the resident golf professional. She was extremely courteous with the staff members.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Soccer, for business 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Brasilia, Sept. 13: You cant do business with Brazil without a bit of soccer diplomacy. Little wonder that football figured at the meeting of the three heads of governments of India, Brazil and South Africa with the business delegations from the three countries. 

 They would all be happy to do more business with Brazil, but a little help from President Lula on the soccer front could help things. 

 It was the leader of the South African business delegation who brought it up during his presentation. South Africas number one football team, he told Lula, is called the Brazilians. It had no Brazilian players, though. So, would Lula help with a coach and some players for the team? 

 Not to leave India altogether out, he said: And Prime Minister Manmohan Singh could help us with improving our cricket.

 Before the next speaker, CII president 

 R. Seshasayee, could throw in his bit of football plea, 

 the South African President, Thabo Mbeki, butted in. Referring 

 to the point made by the head of the business delegation 

 from his country, he said: His description of the 

 Brazilians as the best soccer team in South Africa is subjective 

 because he owns it.

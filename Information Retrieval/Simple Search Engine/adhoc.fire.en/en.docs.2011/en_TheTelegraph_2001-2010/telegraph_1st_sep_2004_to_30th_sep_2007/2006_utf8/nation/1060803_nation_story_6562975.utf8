 JNU caste abuse

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 2: Two Dalit students were allegedly abused and thrashed with cricket bats and stumps by members of a right-wing group in Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) late last night.

 Saurav, a first-year student of BA in Spanish, and his brother Amritashva, who has just passed out of the university, were reportedly attacked by five members of the recently-formed JNU Patriotic Forum, a splinter of the BJP-backed Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad.

 The accused Maninder Singh Chauhan, Gopal, Rahul, Rahul Tulsayan and Yashwant had allegedly been harassing Saurav, taunting him about his caste. They would abuse him and tell him that he didnt deserve to be in JNU, Amritashva said.

 Pramhit Shukla, a member of the Forum, said there was a confrontation but added that Sourav and his bother went to the room of one of the accused and provoked the occupants. 

 The victims were admitted to Safdarjung Hospital and were discharged this evening. The injuries resemble nail marks. A lot of the skin from the hand has peeled off, said Rajnish Kumar, a doctor. A complaint has been filed with police, which said an FIR would be registered under the SC/ST Act.

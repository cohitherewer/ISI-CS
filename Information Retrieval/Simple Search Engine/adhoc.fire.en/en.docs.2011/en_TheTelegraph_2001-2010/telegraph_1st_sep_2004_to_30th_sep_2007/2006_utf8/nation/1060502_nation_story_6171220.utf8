 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Chinsurah, May 1: Nine persons, including eight of a family, were killed this morning when the Sumo they were travelling in crashed into a roadside Eucalyptus tree on Delhi Road at Arenga in the Polba area of Hooghly, about 70 km from Calcutta.

 Police sources said 13 members of a family, all residents of Jetia Natunpara in Halisahar in North 24-Parganas, were on their way to the Tarakeswar temple to offer puja.

 The driver of the Sumo lost control while trying to skirt a cyclist crossing the road around 7 am. It hit the cyclist and then ran into the tree. 

 Five passengers of the car were killed on the spot, apart from the cyclist, while three succumbed to injuries in hospital. 

 The dead included two young sisters ? four-year-old Rimi and six-year-old Jhilik. 

 The cyclist, 25-year-old Radhaballav, used to work in a jewellery shop in Calcutta. 

 Tabu Sheikh, who saw the accident, said: I was working in a cold storage nearby. Suddenly I heard a deafening crash and saw the Sumo had rammed into the tree. I raised an alarm and ran towards the mangled car. The driver, however, escaped.

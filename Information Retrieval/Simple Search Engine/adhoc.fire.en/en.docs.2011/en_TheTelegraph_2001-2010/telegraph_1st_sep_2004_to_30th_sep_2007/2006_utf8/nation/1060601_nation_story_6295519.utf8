 Calcutta, May 31: Amarnath Yatra or a holiday in the hills, there is a regular flow of tourists from Calcutta to Kashmir. The demand had increased over the past two seasons, till the twin grenade blasts brought a rude shock today.

 We send around 100 tourists a year from here to Kashmir, said a spokesperson for Modcons Tours and Travels.

 The big groups are mostly for the yatra, but we also have some holidaying families around the year. The security aspect is uppermost on their minds, of course, and it does deter some people, he added.

 But there are still those who choose to go. Tourists are rarely the targets of militant attacks, so they usually dont face any problems. We have never had a mishap with our groups.

 We dont conduct tours to Kashmir, but it has been a very popular destination for Calcuttans so far this summer, said Prashant Binnany of Discovery Travels and Tours.

 We had record bookings and they all came back happy. The hotels were almost booked up.

 Security is often the reason why some travel agents, such as Diamond Tours and Travels, keep Kashmir off their map. But tourists do drop by for reservations.

 There arent too many, since the situation there deters most tourists. So we dont promote that sector. But there are some Calcuttans who go to Kashmir on holiday. They have questions about the security issue. We dont give them any special advice, but we give them hotel options and do the reservations in front of them, said Diamond sales executive B.K. Paul.

 Todays attacks will reduce the number of tourists going from Calcutta, an industry source said.

 The president of Travel Agents Association of India, Calcutta chapter, Alka Rathi, said its unsafe to book oneself on Kashmir tours through unknown and often unregistered travel operators who we have never heard of.

 Im told that there is significant tourist traffic from Calcutta to Kashmir. But there arent too many travel agencies that organise trips there. What happened today is very sad.

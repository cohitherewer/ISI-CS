 Rain washes away soap and song

a day of shooting because of the rain 

 Mumbai, July 6: The rains didnt just sink the man on the street. Even the stars lost their shine.

 When the skies opened over Mumbai, flooding roads and homes, the entertainment industry, too, was brought to its knees.

 Television channels suffered because most shows did not have a bank of episodes and had to air repeat telecasts.

 We couldnt shoot on July 4. Our sets were literally drowning. The cops had shut the roads, so none of our actors could make it to the sets. All the shows have been affected equally, but Kasamh Se (Zee) and Kavyanjali (STAR Plus) have been harmed the most, said creative director Nivedita Basu.

 Since Sankraman studios (The Balaji studio in suburban Mumbai) is built on a low-lying area, it gets flooded easily. But compared with last year, this time the damage was not that much.

 Most production houses chose to cancel shoots, lest their actors were left stranded. We were in Mumbai on July 4 and didnt take a risk on July 5. I had to transport property for my shoot in the heavy rain and as a result suffered monetary losses. But as a precaution, I stay in touch with the weather department and avoid outdoor shoots. The only problem is that even if I keep a bank of episodes, it starts to dwindle if I dont stick to schedules, said producer Tony Singh, whose show on Zee, Jab Love Hua, is shot on Mumbais outskirts.

 Many actors, both from the small and the big screen, chose to stay indoors. Director-producer Karan Johar cancelled his July 4 shoot of the last song for his movie Kabhie Alvida Na Kehna. The song stars all his lead actors.

 Sources said while Preity Zinta and Abhishek Bachchan managed to make it to the studio, Rani Mukherjee and Shah Rukh Khan were caught in the slow-moving traffic.

 Another film that has suffered is Sajid Nadiadwalas Jaan E-Mann, which stars Salman Khan and Zinta.

 There were only three major films on the floor during the rains ? Babul, Jaan E-Mann and Kabhie Alvida Na Kehna. All of them lost one day and, frankly speaking, in the course of making big-budget movies thats not much of a loss, said Komal Nahata, who estimates that the industry lost about Rs 40-50 lakh during last Julys deluge.

 Overall, the film industry must have lost around Rs 15-20 lakh maximum. Again they didnt have to pay the crew or the make-up people and saved other expenses that come with running a film schedule, Nahata added.

 But losses came in other forms. Ajay Devgan was looking forward to the music launch and book release of The Making of Omkara on Tuesday. Both were cancelled.

 The worst affected were, perhaps, Bobby Deol and the small screens leading lady, Kanchi Kaul, who was stuck in Madh Island in suburban Mumbai with only a few crew members for company and without adequate food and water. She even lost her cellphone.

 For Deol, this rain brought back memories of last year when his bungalow was submerged. This year, the rains flooded his lawn and the water almost touched his staircase.

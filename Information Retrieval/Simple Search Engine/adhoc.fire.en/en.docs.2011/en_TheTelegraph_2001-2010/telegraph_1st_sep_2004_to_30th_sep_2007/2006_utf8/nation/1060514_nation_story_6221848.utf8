 Job quota hint with an if

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Kamal Nath

 New Delhi, May 13: Commerce minister Kamal Nath today said the Centre would bring a law to ensure job reservation in the private sector if industry failed to come out with adequate voluntary action for the purpose. 

 We will first see what is its voluntary action.... But if it fails, the government will have to look at other options... including making it legally possible, he told a TV channel.

 He said the government was also working on a package to provide incentives, including tax concessions, for encouraging private companies to set up industries in backward districts where a large percentage of the population were from the scheduled castes, scheduled tribes and other backward classes.

 But the government action would depend on the response from industry, the minister reiterated. If it felt the steps being taken were not adequate on the ground, other options would be considered, he said.

 Nath pointed out that Indias growth has so far been urban-centric and it was important to develop areas that were not part of this growth story. There are about 104 districts in the country, where SCs, STs and OBCs comprise more than half the population, he said.

 But, if there is no other alternative to all-inclusive growth, reservations will have to happen, he said.

 Job reservation in the private sector took centrestage after Prime Minister Manmohan Singh urged private companies to make their employee profile more broad-based and representative.

 The Prime Ministers remark, which came at the inaugural plenary of the Confederation of Indian Industrys annual session, triggered howls of protest.

 However, a subtle process of a caste headcount is on in several companies. Unlike the government, there was no column for castes in our job applications. But with the issue again cropping up, we are now conducting a survey of sorts internally to find out how many of our present employees belong to scheduled castes and scheduled tribes, said a Delhi industrialist.

 The CII, too, is learnt to have asked its member companies about caste representation in their current pool of human resource.

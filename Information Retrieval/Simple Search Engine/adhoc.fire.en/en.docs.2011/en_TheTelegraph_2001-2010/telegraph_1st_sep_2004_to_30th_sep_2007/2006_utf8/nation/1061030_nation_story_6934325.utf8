 Cell alert in J amp;K jail

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Jammu, Oct. 29: The Jammu and Kashmir government is mulling calling in the CBI to probe the goings-on in the Kot Bhalwal jail after a mobile phone and SIM cards were found on its premises.

 The high-security jail holds some of Kashmirs most-wanted militants and an initial investigation has revealed that jail superintendent Gurdip Singh was in the know about the mobile phones. 

 The probe revealed that a murder undertrial, Gurmeet Singh, and Hizb-ul Mujahideen militant Mohammad Altaf were in touch with a Pakistani militant, called Mohammad Farooq, through cellphones. Farooq is in Sangrur jail in Punjab.

 Gurmeet and Altaf, when questioned by SP Yoginder Kaul of the CID, claimed that jail superintendent Singh knew what was happening. 

 Sources said the inmates used the mobiles to coordi- nate hawala transactions and a drug trafficking network in the state.

 Gurdip would also be questioned, an officer of the states prisons department said.

 In June 1999, when Gurdip was posted in the same jail, Sajjad Afghani, a close associate of Jaish-e-Mohammad founder Masood Azhar, tried to escape. But he was killed by CRPF guards. 

 Director-general, prisons, M.K. Mohanty, has himself been visiting the jail after the mobile phone was found.

 The government suspects there is more than what meets the eye. We are thinking of handing over the investigation to the CBI, an official said. 

 It has become necessary that these things be thoroughly probed and the truth should come out without any delay.

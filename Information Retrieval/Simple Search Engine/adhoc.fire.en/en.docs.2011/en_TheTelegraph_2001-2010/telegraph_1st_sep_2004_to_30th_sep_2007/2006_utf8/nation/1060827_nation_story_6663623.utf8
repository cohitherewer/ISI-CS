 Uma faces Vidisha dilemma

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Bhopal, Aug. 26: Uma Bharti is in a predicament. 

 The expelled BJP leaders supporters are coaxing her to contest the Vidisha Lok Sabha byelection, but the Bharatiya Janshakti Party chief fears that if defeated, her political career in the state will be over. Uma is testing the waters before taking the plunge. 

 The Vidisha seat has been vacated by Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan and polls are scheduled for early October. The state BJP wants a local nominee preferably Chauhans wife Sadhna to be given the ticket. Earlier, there was talk of Feroze Varun Gandhi or Sushma Swaraj being fielded from the constituency. 

 On Friday, Uma held consultations at her Professors Colony residence. She received unanimous feedback from her partymen who wanted her to take on the ruling BJP in Vidisha. Uma was told that if she continued to be diffident, she would lose her credibility as a firebrand leader. 

 Last year in October, when Uma raised the banner of revolt against the BJP leadership, she had the support of over 100 party MLAs. But the tally has now been reduced to a single digit. 

 It was pointed out to Uma that most of the dissident BJP MLAs, including Sunil Nayak, were working out a rapprochement with the parent organisation instead of joining her breakaway party. 

 Vidisha is predominantly a backward and rural constituency. It has a sizeable number of Lodhi, Patel, Kirar and other backward classes which form the base of Umas support. But it is essentially a BJP citadel. 

 Uma is aware of this and so would rather focus on areas like Uttaranchal, Uttar Pradesh and Punjab where she can play a spoiler to the BJP.

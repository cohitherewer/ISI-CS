 Howrah bus blast

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Gaya, July 29: A powerful explosion ripped through a Howrah-bound bus in Bihars Gaya district this evening, killing two persons in an attack police blamed on a Maoist faction.

 Gaya superintendent of police Amit Jain said he suspected the involvement of the Marandi group in the blast on the Grand Trunk Road near Barachatti, a rebel stronghold about 50 km south-west of the divisional headquarters.

 Jain said the police had of late stepped up operations against the Marandi faction and that Rakesh Mahto, one of the prominent members of the splinter group, was recently arrested in Barachatti.

 Last year, BJP leader M. Venkaiah Naidus campaign helicopter was torched by Maoist rebels after it made an emergency landing in a Barachatti field.

 Reports reaching the district headquarters said the explosion, which also left eight persons seriously injured, occurred as the bus negotiated a speed-breaker. The impact of the jerk may have triggered the blast, the reports added.

 The injured have been admitted to Magadh Medical College Hospital.

 Jain, who rushed to the blast spot with DM Jeetendra Srivastava and other senior officials, said the bombs may have been kept in the luggage. Asked if the explosives were planted in the bus or a passenger was carrying them for use elsewhere, the police officer said it was too early to comment.

 Md Shamim, the driver of the bus, said he heard a loud explosion and thought a tyre had burst, but soon recovered from the shock to realise that the situation was more serious. Some glass splinters also struck him, he added.

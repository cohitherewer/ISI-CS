 Egypt right of way to junk ship 

 Cairo (AFP): Egypt has approved the transit through the Suez Canal of a decommissioned French warship heading for the ship-breaking yard at Alang in Gujarat.

 The decommissioned warship, Clemenceau, had been stranded for three days over fears it was an environmental hazard to dismantle the vessel.

 In a statement carried by the official Mena news agency, the environment ministry said documents provided by Paris proved the Clemenceau did not fall under the 1989 Basel Convention banning the export of toxic waste.

 The ministry assessed that following the agreement by the French government to export the Clemenceau in its current state and Indias agreement to take it for dismantling, the French aircraft carrier does not pose an environmental threat to Egypt.

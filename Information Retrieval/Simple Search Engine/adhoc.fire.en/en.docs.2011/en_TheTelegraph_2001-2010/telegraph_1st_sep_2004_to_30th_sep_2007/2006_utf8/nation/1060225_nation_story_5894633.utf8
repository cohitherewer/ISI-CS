 Life term sets off leap to death

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Feb. 24: Moments after being convicted of murdering her foster father to grab his Rs 35-crore flat in Breach Candy, a 30-year-old woman jumped to her death from the window of the courts third-floor toilet today.

 Ardeshir Cursetjee, 73, was strangled at the Worli flat of foster daughter Geeta Soni on May 20, 2003. The sessions court handed life terms to Geeta, her mother Sharad, husband Irshad Mulla and watchmen Rakesh and Ajay Valmiki.

 The accused were being taken back to jail around 2.35 pm when Geeta asked to go to the toilet. Minutes later, she dropped to the courtyard, her skull smashed by the fall. She was taken to hospital but died before admission.

 She was shocked by the judgment but had seemed normal, her lawyer Waris Pathan said. She signed the papers for an appeal before Bombay High Court.

 Dr Baburaj Hegde, who had arranged a certificate for natural death ? signed by his friend Dr U. Pal ? got three years. Parsi priest Behram Dordi, who had agreed to perform the last rites, was acquitted along with Dr Pal.

 The prosecution said Cursetjee had met Geeta in 1996 and made her his foster daughter over wife Mehroos objections. In 1999, he bought a flat for Geeta in Worli. When she decided to marry Mulla, a driver, a livid Cursetjee threatened to cut her out of his will. On May 20, 2003, he went missing. Geeta showed Mehroo a death certificate that declared Cursetjee had died of a heart attack. 

 But suspicious family members lodged a complaint with police, who recovered the decomposed body from the Tower of Silence.

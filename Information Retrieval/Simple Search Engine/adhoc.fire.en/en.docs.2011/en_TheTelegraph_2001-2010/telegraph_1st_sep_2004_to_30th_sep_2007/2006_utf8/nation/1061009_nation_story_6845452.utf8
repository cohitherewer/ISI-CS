 Uri, Oct. 8: In these valleys still scarred by last years death and destruction, this appears the only sign of life bouncing back.

 On the anniversary of the October 8 temblor, which claimed hundreds of foetuses in their mothers wombs, the good news is a robust birth rate during the past one year.

 The earthquakes casualties include not just the 75,000 people who were buried under the debris or died of their wounds both sides of the border. It caused complications in hundreds of expectant mothers, mostly with advanced pregnancies, leading to abortions and intra-uterine deaths.

 Dr Sitara, a senior gynaecologist at the sub-district hospital in Uri, which along with Tangdhar was the worst affected area in the Valley, said the problem was grave. There were dozens of abortions here.

 At Srinagars premier maternity hospital Lal Ded, the number of dilatation-and-curettage procedures performed to extricate the dead foetuses after the earthquake was more than double the number in any other month last year.

 Called threatened abortions, they took place because of stress. Women who had abortions before or had conceived several years after marriage suffered the worst.

 Nazir Ahmad Sheikh of Hazratbal is still traumatised by his personal tragedy. His wife had conceived 10 years after their marriage but the quake shattered their dream with the foetus dying in her womb.

 God knows whether I will ever become a father, he sobs.

 But since last October, the number of newborns has continued to surge although the quake affected the privacy of every household here, with most people forced to live in two-room tin sheds.

 This number (of births) after the quake is perhaps as big as it was in the last year (before the quake), Dr Sitara said.

 The hospitals records show that compared with 330-odd births in Uri in the year preceding the quake, over 300 babies were born in the 11 months after it. Many deliveries, particularly in the far-flung villages, still take place at homes.

 Even some of those women who suffered abortions last year have given birth to babies, Dr Sitara said.

 At Tangdhar, the story is similar. Although the quake affected the privacy of families here, we did not find any decrease in the number of births, says Dr Parvez Iqbal, a gynaecologist at Tangdhar hospital.

 Not surprisingly, the only period when the number fell was exactly 40 weeks after the quake. The births in that month were less than a third of the two following months.

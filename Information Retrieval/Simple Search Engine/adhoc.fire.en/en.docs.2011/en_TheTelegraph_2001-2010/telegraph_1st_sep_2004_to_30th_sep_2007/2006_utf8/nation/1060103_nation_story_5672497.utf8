 Cops on toes avert another Bangalore

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Hyderabad, Jan. 2: The citys gleaming infotech hub has been spared a possible bloodbath with the arrest of two men after police swung into action yesterday on a tip-off and also seized powerful explosives hidden in steel containers.

 The arrests came days after a professor was shot dead and four others were wounded in the countrys tech capital Bangalore and just a day before Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is scheduled to kick off the 93rd Indian Science Congress here.

 Additional commissioner Rajeev Trivedi said the explosives packaged neatly in steel containers normally used for carrying pickle and fried eatables were linked to a mobile to trigger off the fuses. 

 About 14 kg of explosives were found on the men, the police officer said.

 The arrested men, he added, were planning to attack the office of the citys police chief, police headquarters and buildings that house top IT companies. 

 Both the men ? Shakeel and Haji ? and the explosives were presented before the media today.

 Trivedi said Haji and Shakeel were picked up after a tip-off by Zaheed and Kaleem, who were arrested last month in connection with the October 12 suicide attack on the police task force office in Begumpet. 

 Besides the suicide bomber, a police constable was killed in the attack.

 The police say the ringleader of the group, Shaheed, is still at large. Shaheed had toured Vijayawada and various parts of Karnataka till October after he got admitted to an institute in Bidar (north Karnataka) as a computer student, Trivedi said.

 The police officer, who heads the citys crime department, said it appears that committed terrorists and large quantities of explosives were at large in the city and its surroundings. We have to be very careful in the next few days with several events lined up, he added.

 Trivedi said explosives linked to cellphones were dangerous as terrorists could blow up buildings by just making a call to the mobile. Nobody is safe anywhere.

 The Andhra Pradesh government has deployed 12 battalions of the Central Industrial Security Force to ensure that the coming weeks pass without any incidents.

 The campus of the Acharya NG Ranga Agricultural University, the host of the science congress, has been turned into a virtual fortress. The science meet will be followed by the three-day Pravasi Bharatiya Diwas from January 7. The Prime Minister would be among those who will attend the function.

 Hyderabad would also host an international IT meet before the Congress plenary gets under way later this month.

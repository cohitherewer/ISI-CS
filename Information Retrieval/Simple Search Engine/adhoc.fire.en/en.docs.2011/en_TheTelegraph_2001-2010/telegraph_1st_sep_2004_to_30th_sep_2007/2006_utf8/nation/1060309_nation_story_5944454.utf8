The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Wraps off Indian abortion mafia

 AMIT ROY

 Is anybody listening? 

 London, March 8: Pregnant Indian women in the UK who want to get rid of unwanted female foetuses are being referred by unscrupulous British general practitioners to a mafia of doctors in Delhi, Mumbai, Calcutta and Chennai, it was alleged today. 

 The scandal was blown wide apart this morning by Dr Puneet Bedi, a consultant in obstetrics and gynaecology at Indraprastha Apollo Hospital in New Delhi, who alleged that getting an abortion done in India was as easy as buying a car or a VCR.

 As the law stands, abortion is legal in the UK up to the 24th week of pregnancy, said a spokeswoman for the General Medical Council, the organisation which supervises medical ethics in Britain.

 However, if there is a substantial risk to the womans life or if there are foetal abnormalities, there is no time limit, she said. To comply with the 1967 Abortion Act, two doctors must give their consent, stating that to continue with the pregnancy would present a risk to the physical or mental health of the woman or her existing children. However, the act does not extend to Northern Ireland, where abortion is still illegal.

 The spokeswoman went on: A scan will show up the sex of the foetus only after six months or so, by which time it will be too late to have abortion on demand.

 For some months now, stories have been appearing in British newspapers of Indian women making their way to India for abortions, for which they are more than happy to pay a premium. For the doctors in India who perform these operations, it is a nice little earner on the side.

 Speaking on BBC Radio Fives Live Breakfast, Bedi said: I know for sure, I have often been approached by people who are willing to send someone to my practice. There are transfers from GPs in England to the gynaecologists in Delhi ? that is a fact. It is an organised industry, an organised mafia among doctors.

 Asked if it was a common practice, he said: Yes, actually, and, if anything, it is on the rise because basic economics dictate and theres a lot of money for the doctors to be made. I am not sure how many people will say it on the television or radio but we all know it happens all the time. Most of the gynaecologists in south Delhi, at least, are directly involved in the process.

 Bedi revealed that the average cost for woman in India to have an abortion was around ?100, whereas British Asian women could pay several thousand pounds.

 I do not know of any doctor who does not have half a dozen colleagues or medical school friends in England already practising ? sometimes in areas where there is a large Indian population, he said. In this business there is a core of silence like every other organised white collar crime.

 Supporting evidence was given by Dr Himansu Basu, a consultant gynaecologist who runs a private practice in Gravesend, Kent, who said: Abortion based on the sex of the child is banned in the UK, it is also illegal in India. But there are areas of private practice where people can go.

 He added it was difficult to estimate the numbers of female abortions that take place each year because data was never published. But, anecdotally, he estimated that it has been going on for years.

 He went on: Overall, the global impact must be absolutely horrendous, it is a biological disturbance.

 Julia Millington, from the Pro-Life Alliance, said she was horrified by the system: It is illegal in the UK and illegal in India to abort a baby simply because it is the wrong sex. Anyone who actively participates in such a referral is culpable themselves of an illegal act and must be prosecuted.

 They are contributing not only to the death of innocent unborn babies, but also actively furthering appalling discrimination against women.

 A spokesman for the British Medical Association commented: I am not sure of the legality but we would certainly strongly oppose this practice.

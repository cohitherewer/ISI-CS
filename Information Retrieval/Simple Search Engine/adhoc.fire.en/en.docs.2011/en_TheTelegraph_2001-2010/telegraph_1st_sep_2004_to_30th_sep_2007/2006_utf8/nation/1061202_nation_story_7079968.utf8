 Bias blame on history

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 1: The CPM is blaming history for the low status of Muslims in Bengal, a state it has ruled for nearly 30 years.

 The Rajinder Sachar committee, which went into the social, economic and educational status of Muslims, has underlined that the community lacks access to jobs.

 The report it tabled in Parliament yesterday also speaks of the poverty levels among Muslims in Bengal who account for 25.2 per cent of the states population.

 The report, for instance, points out that the average per capita expenditure of Muslims in Bengal is below that of all other socio-religious groups, except scheduled castes and scheduled tribes.

 On government jobs, it says the percentage of Muslims is very low. In fact, even Gujarat, fares better than Bengal.

 Bengals ruling Marxists, however, did not appear to be embarrassed by the revelations. Far from what our detractors hope that the CPM will be embarrassed by these findings, we have already noted the flaws and initiated proposals for remedial action, says Peoples Democracy, the partys mouthpiece, in its latest issue.

 The party falls back on historical reasons to justify the backwardness of Muslims.

 In the 1870s, the then Viceroy Lord Mayo had asked Sir William Hunter to study the causes of Muslim unrest, it says.

 A survey showed serious under-representation of Muslims in government jobs. For instance, there were 14 Hindus and two Muslims in the category of assistant engineers, and one Muslim and 24 Hindus among sub-engineers and supervisors.

 There is nothing on paper to show that concrete measures were taken to correct this imbalance. Modern-day Bengal has inherited this legacy, the CPM says.

 It says the 1947 partition saw 

 the migration of nawabs, landlords and the wealthy to East 

 Pakistan. Post-Independence decades also compounded 

 the problem through waves of immigration. Calcutta continues 

 to attract the poorest of Muslims from neighbouring states 

 in search of livelihood and survival.

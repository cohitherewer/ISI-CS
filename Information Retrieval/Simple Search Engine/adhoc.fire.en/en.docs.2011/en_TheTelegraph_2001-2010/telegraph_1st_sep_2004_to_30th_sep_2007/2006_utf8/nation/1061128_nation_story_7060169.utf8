The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 After IT windfall, whirlwind spending

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Hyderabad, Nov. 27: K. Narasimha Raju, 21, flies to Mumbai every weekend to check in at a ritzy hotel and spend hours at Bollywood studios gazing at Shah Rukh Khan or Amitabh Bachhan.

 The rest of the week he keeps trying out various facelifts after all, he might just catch a directors eye one day if not the megastars.

 A few months ago, this farmers son earned a living by washing dishes at roadside hotels.

 Bhujanga Reddy, 29, doesnt care for Mumbai. The ex-farmer from Mansanpally on Hyderabads outskirts has enough tycoons and Telugu film stars in his apartment block to rub shoulders with, anyway.

 Just to think I grew lentils on my one-acre farm and earned Rs 2,000 a month till the other day, he chuckles. But I sold it for Rs 22 crore in June, bought a Scorpio and moved into a posh colony.

 Raju and Reddy are two of the 1,300 farmers who have cashed in on Hyderabads IT boom, selling their plots to many of the 1,500 companies for tens of crores.

 Raju sold his land for Rs 26 crore and Jambla Naik, the 36-year-old former rickshaw-puller who now owns a luxury Tavera from the stable of Chevrolet, Rs 65 crore.

 That is too much money even after you have bought all the fancy cars you want. Even the Singapore holidays and Dubai shopping binges hardly make enough of a dent in the fortune.

 So these men have been forced to find their own solutions.

 Every day now, gleaming Mercs and Scorpios glide out of plush apartments and bungalows, their boots loaded with gunny bags stuffed with bundles of notes.

 The owners scour the city looking to strike lightning real estate deals, ready to lure prospective sellers by dangling on-the-spot advances of tens of lakhs in hard cash.

 Watch out for the flashy cars zipping around the city. If you take a peek at their back seats you will notice bundles of cash in plastic bags or gunny bags. It could be up to Rs 50 lakh, says inspector Shankara Reddy at Jeedimetla police station.

 They dont trust outsiders; they employ relatives to survey real estate and bribe government officials. All the bars, restaurants and dhabas on the citys outskirts are always crowded with agents, clients and farmers making merry till the small hours.

 Each treasury-on-wheels is protected by at least two armed guards, the officer says.

 A few weeks ago, two farmers were robbed of nearly Rs 25 lakh at gunpoint on a highway, but they didnt even make a police report.

 The real estate business looks at the sudden competition with a mixture of scorn and envy. These people with their ready cash might be stealing a few deals from us, but they dont have a clue about the business. In the long run, they are going to blow their fortune, an agent said.

 Away from the costly flats and fast cars, sitting on his wooden cot before his two-room village house in Nanakramguda, Koti Reddy may turn out to be the wisest of them all.

 The 62-year-old, who has sold his 5.3 acres for Rs 114 crore, has taken home only Rs 2 crore.

 No one in my family over generations had seen so much cash together, Koti told The Telegraph last month. So, I have asked the buyer to keep it in safe custody for me.

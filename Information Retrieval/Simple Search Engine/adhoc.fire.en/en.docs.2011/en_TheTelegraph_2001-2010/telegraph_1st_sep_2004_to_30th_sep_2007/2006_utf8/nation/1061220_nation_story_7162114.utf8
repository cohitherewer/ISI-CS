 Scanner on grain trade

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 19: A Parliamentary committee has recommended keeping food grain, coarse grain, pulses and sugar out of forward, or futures, trading. It says the gains from rising prices of farm products usually go to middlemen and traders, at the cost of farmers and consumers. In forward or futures trading, buyers and sellers agree to trade a specified quantity of a product at a pre-negotiated price.

 The panel, whose suggestions came five months after Sonia Gandhi urged the government to speed up the Forward Contracts (Regulation) Amendment Bill, 2006, said since individual farmers dont participate in futures trading, they have no knowledge of the vagaries of the market. 

 Headed by RJD MP Devendra Prasad Yadav, the committee said the large amounts specified in the contracts of commodity exchanges are of little help to farmers, many of whom dont have warehouses and cold chains to cope with the risks inherent in commodity trading. However, it found nothing wrong in non-agricultural products being traded in commodity markets. 

 Parliamentary affairs minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi said the amended bill would become law in the budget session. 

 The NDA government had lifted a 1952 ban on forward trading in most commodities through an ordinance issued in April 2003. It argued that such trading reduces uncertainty in prices and helps farmers get a better deal.

 Other committees appointed by the government in the past to assess the feasibility of futures trading had also suggested keeping essential goods of mass consumption out of it, the House panel pointed out. The suggestion has always been to limit forward deals to big consumer things, like cotton and jute.

 The committee recommended that the Constitution be amended to put stock exchanges and futures trading on the Union or concurrent list so that they can be regulated better. It said foreign agencies or individuals must not be allowed to trade in the commodity market. This will require an amendment to Clause 21 of the bill. The panel also wants the tax waivers on Forward Markets Commission lifted.

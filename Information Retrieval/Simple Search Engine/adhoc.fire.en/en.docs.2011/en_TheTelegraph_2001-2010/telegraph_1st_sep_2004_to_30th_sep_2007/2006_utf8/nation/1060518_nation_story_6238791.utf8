 Netaji no more, mystery lives on

 Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose reading the proclamation of the Provisional Government of Azad Hind on Indian soil

 New Delhi, May 17: Netaji is surely dead ? that is the sole clear conclusion arising from the third government-appointed probe over the past half century into one of the enduring mysteries of modern Indian history.

 The two other major findings of Justice M.K. Mukherjee Commission, which will breathe new life into the conspiracy theories, were straight away rejected by the Centre as it placed the three-volume report in the Lok Sabha today.

 Subhas Chandra Bose did not die in the (August 18, 1945) plane crash (in Taiwan), says the panel. Also, The ashes in the Japanese (Renkoji) temple are not of Netaji.

 The government gave no reason why it wouldnt accept these findings.

 The commission says that in the absence of any clinching evidence, a positive answer cannot be given to how and when Bose had died.

 The six-year investigation bases its only definite conclusion not on clinching evidence but on common sense: Considering? the average life span of an Indian is 70-75 years and Netaji was born on January 23, 1897, it can safely and surely be presumed that he is no more.

 The probe panel was set up by the Vajpayee government in 1999 after two others had accepted the air crash theory but failed to convince many of Boses staunch admirers.

 They continued to believe their hero survived or faked the crash, escaped to Russia and later returned to India in disguise ? though none could convincingly explain why he would keep his identity a secret.

 But the panel says it stands by its conclusion though its attention had been drawn to a photograph of an allegedly 124-year-old sadhu found living in the year 2000.

 There is no reliable evidence that this sadhu was Netaji. Nor is there any that Bhagwanji-Gumnami Baba was, so the question whether he (Netaji) died in Faizabad on September 16, 1985, need not be answered.

 But the question whether Netaji thereafter landed in Russia or else cannot be answered for dearth of evidence.

 Justice Mukherjee declined to react to the Centres rejection of his key findings, saying: I have no reaction to the governments stand.

 But the Forward Bloc ? the party founded by Bose which has all along rejected the air crash theory ? demanded a debate in both Houses of Parliament.

 No worry on Pak assets: Air chief

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 5: The head of the Indian Air Force, Air Chief Marshal S.P. Tyagi, today said he would be concerned if the balance of power changes in the subcontinent but he was not worried by the acquisition of new military assets by Pakistan.

 The air chief said that as his force flags off its platinum jubilee year this weekend, the IAF is working to achieve strategic reach the ability to project trans-oceanic capability by acquiring newer assets.

 The air chief was addressing a news conference just a week after a letter written by him to the defence minister that pointed to declining force-levels and Pakistans acquisitions was leaked to the media. The news conference is an annual event that takes place in the week leading to Air Force Day on October 8.

 This (monitoring the military potential of countries) is the job of the military, to continuously monitor what is happening in our neighbourhood, the air chief marshal said. He was asked about his apprehensions over a Pakistani deal to source 18 F-16 fighter aircraft from the US that was contracted earlier this week.

 In July, the air chief wrote to defence minister Pranab Mukherjee that unless the IAF bolstered its fleet, the number of its combat squadrons was in danger of falling to the level of Pakistans. Tyagi said he would not part with the contents of the letter that were leaked to the media in any case because it is privileged information.

 The air chief also said purchases of equipment and aircraft were likely to be speeded up after the defence procurement policy was announced last month. On the pressing need for 126 multi-role combat aircraft, the air chief still could not give a timeframe despite it being in the works for more than three years.

 However, beginning next year, the IAF is scheduled to add to its fleet newer aircraft. Air Chief Marshal Tyagi said discussions to buy Mirage 2000-V fighter aircraft from the French have revived.

 Gunmen rap on Mulayam

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, Dec. 12: Allahabad High Court today ordered the Mulayam Singh Yadav government in Uttar Pradesh to withdraw gunmen assigned to student leaders, vindicating the stand of Lucknow University vice-chancellor R.K. Sharma. 

 The order asks the government which had justified granting security cover to student leaders, saying they were under threat to file an affidavit on compliance by December 15. 

 No exception can be made simply on the ground that there is some threat of life to a person if there are criminal antecedents against the particular person, the division bench of Justices Imtiyaz Murtaza and Amar Saran said.

 Security should be sanctioned strictly in accordance with the objective and fair norms laid down in government orders, not on the desire or direction of the chief minister or any other authority, it said. 

 The court directed the government to withdraw the security/gunners from all ineligible private persons, like students, student leaders, contractors and all political workers. 

 A government spokesman said while it was yet to receive a copy of the order, it would launch an exercise for compliance by December 15. The order came on a petition by Gayur Hasan, a resident of Lucknow. 

 Vice-chancellor Sharma, while announcing recently that the university was being closed following student violence, had complained that student leaders affiliated to the ruling party were moving around with gunmen. 

 There is no power with any authority, howsoever high, to distribute largesse in the form of gunners for security. In case any exception is to be made in any case, it will only be to those cases where the private person is a witness of a serious crime and that too only if he has no criminal antecedents, the court said. 

 Gunners and security can no longer be a status symbol or for protection for illegal activities, it added. 

 On November 8, the bench had expressed distress at the halfhearted manner in which orders to withdraw security from those not eligible for it were being complied with. The court had pointed out that the number of people who had been given security were far above the 2,207 mentioned by the government.

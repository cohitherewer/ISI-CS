 School staff locked for pass marks

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, April 22: Around 170 students of an English medium school, along with their guardians, kept its 33 employees confined to a room for over 15 hours, allegedly after failing to secure pass marks in the annual examinations.

 The results were declared around 11.30 am on Friday. A group of students of Classes V to IX, who failed to secure the pass marks, along with their guardians, demanded promotion to the next classes, alleged Mridul Bose, administrator of Andrews High (HS) School in Dhakuria.

 When the authorities declined to meet the absurd demand, the 33 teaching and non-teaching staffers, including him, were locked up in a room around 4 pm, said Bose.

 Police rescued the employees around 7.30 this morning.

 The students and guardians refused to comment.

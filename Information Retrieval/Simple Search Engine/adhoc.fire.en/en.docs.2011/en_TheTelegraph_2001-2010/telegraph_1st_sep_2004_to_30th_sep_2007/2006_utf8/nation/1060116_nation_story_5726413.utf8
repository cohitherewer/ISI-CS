 Delhi envoy

 Indias ambassador to Nepal, Shiv Shanker Mukherjee, arrives in Delhi on Monday to brief the government on the escalating violence in the kingdom.

 A day after triggering a series of bomb blasts, the Maoists on Sunday attacked the Nepal army chiefs house on the outskirts of Kathmandu. Two government buildings were also bombed.

 Mukherjee is expected to meet foreign secretary Shyam Saran and other senior officials. 

 The envoy may also call on defence minister Pranab Mukherjee and home minister Shivraj Patil.

 Schools out of Punjab home zone

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Chandigarh, April 10: A court order barring schools from operating in residential areas in Punjab has put a question mark on the future of nearly 30 lakh students in the state.

 The Punjab and Haryana High Court order follows a public interest litigation filed nine years ago demanding that schools be barred from operating in residential areas for failing to maintain basic facilities in terms of buildings and playgrounds.

 The courts decision, which came last year, gave the government a years time to implement the ruling. The deadline expired on March 31. 

 The ruling states that even affiliated schools that do not fulfil guidelines must down shutters. In all, nearly 20,000 schools in Punjab will be affected by the decision. 

 But the 126 government primary schools that are operating from residential areas have not been served any notices in this matter. 

 Though official sources said over 8 lakh students would be affected, the Punjab Private School Association put the number between 30 and 35 lakh, blaming the education department for creating a scare among parents who are left with no choice but to shift their wards to ill-equipped government schools, several of them even lacking teachers.

 The whole country creates a hue and cry when just a few IIM and IIT students send a letter of protest to the government. Here, it is a matter that is affecting lakhs of schoolchildren and the government is doing nothing, said Surinder Singh Dhillon, president of the association. 

 The association had asked for an extension of the deadline. A plea on this is expected to be filed this week.

 According to Dhillon, the education department has erred in understanding the verdict. The PIL was on schools in Punjab Urban Development Agency townships and their number can be counted on the fingertips. The verdict should have been implemented in only the townships and not the entire state, he claimed. 

 Government schools can accommodate only 3 lakh students. What is going to happen to the rest? And what about the 1.5 lakh teachers who are running the schools?

 A senior officer in the chief ministers secretariat said the government was seized of the matter. We are taking legal advice on the verdict. We will go to the Supreme Court if needed. We cannot order schools to close in an election year.

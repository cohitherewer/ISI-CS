 Bahuguna plans penance at Tehri

 - Face of Chipko movement to plant trees around dam that drowned a town

 Bahuguna: Fighting on

 Lucknow, July 31: The tree under which Sunderlal Bahuguna had sat praying as he launched his battle against the Tehri hydel project has drowned with the town.

 But to the man with the prophets beard and green bandanna, its more permanent than the dam standing tall.

 Trees are permanent; they are natural dams. The one built on the river is temporary, he said a day after watching the opening of the power project on television.

 Equally temporary, therefore, is the defeat in the three-decade fight against the power project that has submerged the old Himalayan town of Tehri.

 Bahuguna left Lucknow for Tehri today to launch a fresh campaign. But to the Gandhian in his 80s who has been the face of the Chipko (hug the tree) movement, this one will be as much a penance as a protest.

 My struggle is on and we will this time do the penance on behalf of the government in the Himalayas by planting trees around the power plant. This will mark a new chapter in the ongoing movement of the people, he told students of the Indian Institute of Management, Lucknow, last evening.

 Why a new movement when the dam is already built, asked the students who had invited him to speak as part of a tree plantation movement on the campus.

 So what if the dam has been built? I will continue to sit in front of the dam and protest, Bahuguna told them.

 Some 25,000 people have lost their homes in Tehri, he said, and there are still problems of rehabilitation. 

 I dont know how the dam would solve the power problem but it has not solved the problems emanating from the rehabilitation mess-up, Bahuguna said.

 Bahuguna, who is mobilising voluntary organisations working in various fields for his new campaign, has already met representatives from several NGOs in Uttar Pradesh.

 He will now be regrouping his followers scattered around the Tehri region in Uttaranchal. The plantation drive may begin in a week or two.

 Uttaranchal government sources said the authorities would not oppose the movement. 

 We, too, are worried about deforestation in the Himalayas. Itll be good if he plants trees, a source said.

 Bahuguna has been reminding green activists that the issue is larger than the dam.

 The main issue is the Himalayan policy because I see the Tehri dam as the symbol of the destructive development which will kill both the Himalayas and the rivers and streams, he said.

 The Himalayas are a land of penance. Nothing in the world can be achieved without penance. I am doing this on behalf of all who are striving to save our dying planet. Why should a river, a mountain, a forest or an ocean be killed while we cling to life?

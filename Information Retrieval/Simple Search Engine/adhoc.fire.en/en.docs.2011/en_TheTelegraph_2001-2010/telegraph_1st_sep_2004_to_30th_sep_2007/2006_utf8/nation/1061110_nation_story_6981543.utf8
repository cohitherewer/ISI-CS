 Korean ship mystery 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Nov. 9: The ship is empty but the circumstances could not have been more loaded.

 MV Omrani-II is a vessel that flies the flag of North Korea, which recently stunned the world with a purported nuclear test.

 The ship was on its way to Iran, which is suspected to be running a covert nuclear programme, possibly with the help of countries like North Korea. 

 Then Omrani-II strayed into the waters of India, dredging from the depths memories of a similar ship with missile parts bound for Pakistan.

 The new ship and its 12-member crew have been detained in Mumbai since October 29 but officials clarified that investigations have been confined to documentation and safety procedures. 

 So far, the Indian inspection is a routine procedure and not based on a UN resolution under which member-nations like India are bound to scan cargo from North Korea for nuclear, biological and chemical weapons.

 When Indian officials boarded the vessel that reported engine trouble, they found it empty but the crew could not give satisfactory answers.

 Initially, there was a language barrier. Our investigation showed that the vessel had its documentation largely in order, except for some safety equipment-related parameters, an official said.

 They have told us that because it is a new ship, they were testing it. But it is strange that they should need to sail as far as Iran, an official of the directorate general of shipping said.

 Captain Deepak Kapoor, a directorate official, told The Telegraph that the crew has appointed an agent to comply with our directives.

 He said the vessel would be allowed to sail to Iran once all requirements are met, unless the defence establishment objects. A defence spokesperson refused to confirm or deny if the military will step in.

 In 1999, a Korean ship heading to Pakistan was ferrying missile components, metal casings and technical manuals, though the manifest had listed sugar and water purification equipment.

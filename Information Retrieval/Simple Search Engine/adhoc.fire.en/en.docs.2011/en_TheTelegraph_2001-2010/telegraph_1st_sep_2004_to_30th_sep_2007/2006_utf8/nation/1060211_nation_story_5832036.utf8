 Bengal govt to face EC music

 - Poll observers complain about irregularities 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 10: The Election Commission has decided to have a talk with the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee dispensation in Bengal after 19 special observers, who toured the state, complained about the governments lax attitude in handling election-related irregularities.

 The observers, who made detailed individual representations to the poll panel, said the administration had done little to execute non-bailable warrants, seize illegal firearms or protect voters who revealed irregularities in the rolls.

 This is the first time the poll panel has decided to hold direct talks with any state government. The date of the meeting is yet to be decided.The observers reported that those who lodged complaints on electoral roll irregularities were intimidated and the local administration hesitated in filing FIRs against the culprits. Some of the observers pointed out that it took their intervention to get the FIRs registered, a source said.

 The commission also came down heavily on the Bengal government for not executing non-bailable arrest warrants despite repeated warnings. The government has to act on 63,724 warrants. 

 Also, the process of deleting names of the dead and identifying voters who had shifted base was found to be unsatisfactory in municipal areas. The commission has decided that the exercise would continue even after the final rolls are out on February 22.

 The observers also briefed the panel on the ground realities regarding photo identity cards, procedural details and other electoral issues.

 The only good word for Bengal was that the observers were able to interact with representatives of all parties and take feedback from ordinary voters in the states interiors .

 Poll panel officials said the report has been disturbing and the matter needs to be taken up at the earliest with the state government. 

 The officials hinted that because of this, polls in Bengal may be conducted in different phases. A final decision would be taken later. The phased elections had positive results in Bihar. 

 The poll panel had earlier pulled up Bengal officials for being negligent and had warned of stringent action. Several officials have been either transferred or suspended. The Election Commission today repeated this threat. 

 Bengal chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb said neither the observers nor the commission had informed the government about the pending non-bailable warrants, the number of which had been substantially brought down.

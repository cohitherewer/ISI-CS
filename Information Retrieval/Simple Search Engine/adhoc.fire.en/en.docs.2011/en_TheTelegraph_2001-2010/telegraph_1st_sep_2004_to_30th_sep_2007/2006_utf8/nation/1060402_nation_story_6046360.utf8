 New Delhi, April 1: The air in the capital was thick with tension as the Municipal Corporation of Delhi continued to seal shops in residential areas for the fourth day in a row. 

 For the first time since the sealing began ? following a Supreme Court order ? the Rapid Action Force was deployed over a radius of 500 metres in the Karol Bagh area today as protests against the drive threatened to snowball. 

 Police lathi-charged a violent crowd in west Delhi and arrested BJP MLA Harsharan Singh Balli. 

 Angry traders clashed with the police and corporation officials, setting an MCD vehicle on fire and pelting stones at its personnel in Najafgarh. Two officials were injured.

 Shops like Big Jos in the upscale South Extension shopping district and amusement parks, including the popular Fun Food Village in Kapashera, were among 466 properties put under lock and key today.

 The MCD has so far sealed over 1,000 commercial establishments in residential areas. 

 Yesterday, thousands of traders had tried to obstruct civic officials from sealing shops and offices across the city, putting the police on their toes.

 The MCD has sought more help from the police. After a meeting with Delhi chief minister Sheila Dikshit yesterday, city police commissioner K.K. Paul requested for additional forces from the Centre. 

 Union home minister Shivraj Patil called a meeting this evening to discuss the law and order situation in the capital.

 The Delhi government has decided to approach the Supreme Court to let the MCD bring more number of roads on the list of areas where mixed land use will be permitted. A central notification allows shops and offices to function only from the ground floor in residential areas.

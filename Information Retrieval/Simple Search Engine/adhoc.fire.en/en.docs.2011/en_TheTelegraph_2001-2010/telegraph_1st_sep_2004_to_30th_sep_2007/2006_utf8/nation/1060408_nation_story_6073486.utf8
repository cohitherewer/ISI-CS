 Exotic species crawl out of Himalaya hideout

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Discovery hotspot 

 New Delhi, April 7: In the cold, rugged mountains of south-west China and Nepal, scientists have discovered exotic species hitherto unknown to science ? creatures such as a beetle that buries birds in subterranean tunnels and a giant hornet that local villagers call the yak killer.

 The new species, discovered during a two-month research expedition into the region north of the Himalayas, also include amphibians, ants, insects and some plants, the US-based Conservation International (CI) announced today. 

 The expedition, supported by the Disney Wildlife Conservation Fund and the Walt Disney Company, combed six sites in the mountains of southwest China and Nepal that have been dubbed Himalayan bio-diversity hotspots, regions where high diversity in native plants and animals is threatened. 

 The fact that we found so many new species and documented several rare and endangered species in such a harsh environment is good news for these two regions, said Leeanne Alonso, the lead scientist of the expedition and vice-president of CIs rapid assessment team. 

 Local efforts by Tibetan communities are helping prevent these plants and animals from going extinct and demonstrate that cultural values can play a role in conservation, he said.

 Biologists and botanists and conservation experts who were members of the expedition trudged through the mountainous terrain for weeks, seeking out, studying and cataloguing several exotic creatures and some known but endangered species. 

 The scientists observed a beetle that buries a small bird and rodent carcasses in subterranean tunnels to feed offspring, a giant hornet whose sting is so powerful that local villagers call it the yak killer and a wingless grasshopper that can tolerate extreme cold, CI said in a release describing the findings. 

 The male of the grasshopper rides on the back of the female, often for days, to prevent other males from mating her, it added.

 The expedition also found new species of frogs, eight new species of insects, 10 new species of ants and several rare and endangered species such as a jumping mouse and two ancient plants, including one that is an important source of drugs against cancer. 

 CI said the results of the expedition would be shared with environmental organisations and scientists to develop conservation strategies to protect the unique species in the region. While the findings reveal the bio-diversity of the region, the Himalayas face challenges from rapid social and economic development. 

 It said road construction is causing habitat loss and bringing more tourists which in turn has spawned a market for wildlife products.

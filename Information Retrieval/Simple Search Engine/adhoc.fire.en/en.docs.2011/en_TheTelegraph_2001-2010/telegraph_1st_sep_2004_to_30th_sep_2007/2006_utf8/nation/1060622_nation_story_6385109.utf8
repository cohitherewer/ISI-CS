 Filmdom looks ahead to cross-border leap

 - Wall 

breaks, brick by brick

 New Delhi, June 21: The dropping of a single paragraph from Pakistans censor code has raised hopes that Islamabad could be on the way to lifting a 40-year ban on Indian films.

 Reports from Islamabad say the government has scrapped the notorious para 5 in Form B that exhibitors fill up while seeking the censors clearance for a film made abroad.

 Under this paragraph, the exhibitors had to affirm that the film has neither been wholly nor partly exposed in any Pakistani or Indian language depicting Pakistani or Indian way of living nor leading roles have been played by Pakistani or Indian artistes.

 The Pakistani media interpreted this amendment to the Censorship of Films Rules, 1980, as lifting of the ban on Indian actors in Pakistani films and on India-Pakistan joint ventures.

 But film circles in India and Pakistan would not go so far as to say this means an Indian film with Indian cast and exposed in an Indian language can now be shown across the border. They seem to agree though that there are no legal hurdles now to joint ventures starring Indian actors.

 In time, they feel, the ban on Indian films will also go.

 Filmmaker Mahesh Bhatt said the wall is being dismantled brick by brick. Bhatt, who has been lobbying for years against the ban and in favour of a freer cultural exchange between the two countries, called the development a major leap. 

 The ban wont go overnight, he felt, because people needed to absorb the changes. When the presence of Indian actors in Pakistani movies ? which the amendment seems to allow ? boosts the Pakistani film industry, it will lead to the next step. A Pakistani actress, Meera, featured in one of Bhatts films, Nazar.

 Trade analyst Komal Nahata was more cautious, but he too agreed the amendment will eventually lead to lifting of the ban. Otherwise, why would they do this? he asked.

 Barring the odd waiver for a specific film, Indian films have not been seen legally in Pakistan since 1965. But they remain hugely popular and the DVD trade thrives.

 In contrast, Pakistans film industry is in a downspin. Reports say cinema houses have been going out of business over the years and many exhibitors feel allowing Indian films is the only way to revive the industry.

 Nahata thought it was unlikely that big Indian stars would act in Pakistani movies soon. Nobody will be able to afford our actors, he said. But there could be joint ventures with actors from both countries.

 Bhatt said Indian actors and technicians should make use of the opportunity, even if it means making less money. Sometimes it is more important to get a footnote in history than to make money, he added.

 The filmmaker was part of a delegation to Pakistan for the premiere of Akbar Khans Taj Mahal, billed as the first commercial release of an Indian film in Pakistan in four decades. But that film had got special clearance and the profits went to earthquake victims. 

 In earlier years, there have been a few screenings of select movies. But the ban has stayed.

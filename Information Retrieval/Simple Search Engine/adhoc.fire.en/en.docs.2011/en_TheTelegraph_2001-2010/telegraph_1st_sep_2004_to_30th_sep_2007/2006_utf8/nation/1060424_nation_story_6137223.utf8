 Actor wife suicide

 Navin Nischol

 Mumbai, April 23 (PTI): Veteran actor Navin Nischols wife Geetanjali allegedly committed suicide at the couples residence in central Mumbai on Saturday, police said.

 The cause of the suicide appeared to be a property dispute between her husband and his brother Pravin, the police added.

 Geetanjali hanged herself last night, according to the police.

 A couple of months ago, Geetanjali had alleged that Pravin had left the couple homeless by throwing them out of their apartment in upmarket Khar where they lived. She said her husband owned the property.

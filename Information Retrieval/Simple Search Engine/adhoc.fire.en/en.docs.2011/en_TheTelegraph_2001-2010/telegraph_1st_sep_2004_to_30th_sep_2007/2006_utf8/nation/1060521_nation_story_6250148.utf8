 Loan for demolished houses

 New Delhi, May 20 (PTI): The Centre today notified a law suspending for a year the demolition and sealing of illegal structures in the capital that have come up before January 1, 2006. 

 It also offered to help people whose properties have been demolished by the Municipal Corporation of Delhi.

 Union urban development minister S. Jaipal Reddy said: We will try to provide loans to those people whose houses have been demolished but can be regularised now (under the new law applicable from January 1) for reconstruction.

 Once President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam gave his assent to the bill suspending action on illegal structures, the Delhi Municipal Corporation ordered cessation of its demolition and sealing drives that have triggered howls of protests. The crackdown on illegal structures was ordered by Delhi High Court.

 Action against encroachment on public property will continue.

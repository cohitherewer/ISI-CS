 500 bounty for an A in math, howzatt!

 - British bait to lure students to science

London, Sept. 4: A senior British educationist has made a remarkable suggestion that pupils who do well in mathematics should share a 500 bribe. 

 Such is the crisis in British science, caused by the rapidly declining pupils taking mathematics at GCSE Advanced Level, that the head of an Oxford College said yesterday that a student and teacher should share a 500 bribe if they contrived to get the top A grade in school-leaving examinations. 

 Frances Cairncross, rector (head) of Exeter College, Oxford, used the word bounty instead of bribe but it amounted to the same thing. 

 The crisis in science education also has wider consequences, politicians have warned. If Britain does not produce enough science graduates good in mathematics, jobs will be lost in the years to come to China and India, politicians and heads of companies have said. 

 Gordon Brown, the chancellor of the exchequer, said in one speech: Within a decade, 5 million US and European jobs could be outsourced. And all the time China and India are upgrading their science and skills, with India and China today producing 125,000 computer science graduates a year and Britain only 5,000. 

 But today, Cairncross, who is also the chairman of the Economic and Social Research Council and this years president of the British Association for the Advancement of Science (BA), focussed on education. 

 Cairncross pointed out that 10,000 fewer schoolchildren took mathematics for their General Certificate of Education at A-level this year than they did in 2001. 

 In the last 10 years in the UK, the number of pupils taking A-levels in chemistry has dropped by 18.7 per cent, in physics by 29.6 per cent and in mathematics by 25.4 per cent over, according to the Royal Society.

 The plummeting popularity of science, engineering and technology among pupils and students threatens the prosperity and quality of life of the whole nation and its progress during the 21st century, commented Sir Alistair MacFarlane, former principal and vice-chancellor of Heriot-Watt University and one-time chairman of the Royal Societys education committee. 

 The government and the professional science and education communities need to strengthen their commitments to encouraging more pupils and students to study science, engineering and technology, he said. 

 He emphasised: Many undergraduate courses in science, engineering and technology are more expensive to run than those in other subjects because they require laboratories, equipment or fieldwork. There must be no let-up in the efforts to remove the hurdles that are deterring talented young people from studying science. 

 Cambridge, meanwhile, has urged pupils who want to gain admission to the university to stick to traditional subjects such as mathematics and avoid soft options such as media studies, health and social care, performing arts, accounting and business studies.

 Speaking at the start of the BA Festival of Science at the University of East Anglia in Norwich, she pointed out the obvious that with mathematics, many doors slam shut. 

 Previously an economics correspondent for The Economist, The Times and Financial Times, Cairncross said: Its hard to study economics at university satisfactorily if you do not have A-level maths, and other social sciences increasingly require quantitative skills. You cannot properly understand risk, or probability, or judge many scientific debates if your maths skills are poor. 

 A good mathematics A-level was also a passport to higher earnings. How many 16-year-olds understand this? Perhaps we need to experiment with a bounty for every grade A for maths A-level taken in a maintained school divided equally between the student and the class teachers. 

 Maintained schools are funded by the state and attended by 93 per cent of pupils in Britain. Yet, private fee-paying schools (public schools in the UK), which take in only 7 per cent of pupils, account for 45 per cent of the top A-grade in mathematics, chemistry, biology and physics.

 It is a scandal that such a high proportion of the best A-levels in these key subjects are coming from fee-paying schools, Cairncross said. We owe it to our grandchildren to educate our children properly.

 It is hard to think that Britain is the land of G.H. Hardy, the foremost mathematician of his day who arranged for Srinivasa Ramanujan to come to Cambridge from Madras in the early part of the last century. But today, it is no longer considered cool to be good at mathematics.

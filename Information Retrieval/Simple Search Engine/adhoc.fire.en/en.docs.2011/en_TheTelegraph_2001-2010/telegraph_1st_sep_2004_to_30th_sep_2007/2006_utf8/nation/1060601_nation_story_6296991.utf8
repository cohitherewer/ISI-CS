 Calcutta, May 31: Divine intervention? How about thank you boss?

 Uttam Dey and S.K. Ghosh must be thanking the very people they had been cursing the past nine days. But for them, they might have been among the bleeding group of men, women and children being rushed to hospitals in ambulances and police vehicles.

 The two, one a Calcutta Port staff and the other a railway employee, had to cancel a trip to Kashmir with their families and relatives after being denied leave at the last minute. They were to start on May 22.

 This evening, they learnt that the bus some of their relatives were on had been targeted by militants.

 Around 7 pm, I got the shock of my life when I came to know about the grenade attack. I did not know what to do, said port employee Dey, a resident of Birati in North 24-Parganas.

 But his sister Manasi, brother-in-law Tapan Kumar Ghosh, a manager with State Bank of India, and their two sons, Bibarshan, 15, and Agnip, 8, had gone ahead with the trip.

 Around 8.30 pm, Ghosh called me and said he and his two sons were all right and only Manasi had suffered injuries in her left leg. We are thankful to God that they have survived, Dey told The Telegraph.

 Railway employee Ghosh, Tapans elder brother, was also a worried man.

 Tapan called us around 8.15 pm and said his wife was injured in the attack but is out of danger. We are praying for their safe return, he said.

 Dey said Tapan used to call him everyday. He had gone to Vaishno Devi and told us what he saw over phone. He and his family were having a nice time. But todays attack is terrible. 

 Far away in Kashmir, Tapan recalled his harrowing experience over phone. There was a sudden blast in the bus on our way back to Srinagar. We did not know what happened. After a while I saw almost all the passengers lying in the debris. Some of them were writhing in pain. Blood was oozing from my wifes leg, he said. I would never ever come here. God saved us from death.

 Back home, Dey has no regrets for not making the trip. After todays incident, he said, I think it was nothing but divine intervention.

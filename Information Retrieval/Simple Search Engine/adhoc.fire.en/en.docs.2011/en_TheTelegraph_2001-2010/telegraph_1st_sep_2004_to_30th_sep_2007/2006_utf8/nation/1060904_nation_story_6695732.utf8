 Parents quarrel, baby lands under train 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 3: A baby aged a year and a half was flung on the tracks and run over by a train this evening when its father pushed its mother after a quarrel on a railway station platform.

 The push threw Mumtaz Bibi, with Manirul in her arms, off the platform and onto the nearer set of tracks at Dakshin Barasat station, about 60 km from Calcutta. The child landed on the outer tracks and into the path of the approaching Lakshmikantapur-bound train.

 His legs severed under the wheels, Manirul died at Padmapukur hospital in Joynagar. A badly injured Mumtaz, 20, was admitted to Bangur Hospital in Calcutta.

 As eyewitnesses rained blows on Mumtazs husband Ramzan Gazi, 24, railway police rescued him and took him into custody. The daily labourer, too, needed to be admitted to Bangur Hospital.

 Manirul had been suffering from jaundice, railway police superintendent Barun Mullick said. Ramzan, a resident of Joynagar, had gone to his in-laws home in Kultali where Mumtaz was staying with her ailing son.

 They were supposed to take the child to a doctor in Calcutta and came to the railway station to catch a train to Sealdah. While waiting for the train, they started a quarrel over whether they should visit the doctor today or tomorrow, Mullick said.

 Suddenly, Ramzan, in a fit of rage, pushed Mumtaz.

 Pak peace process on anti-terror test

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Singh, Musharraf 

 New Delhi, Oct. 18: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today told the military that Pakistans intentions will be tested by the joint anti-terror institutional mechanism that he proposed to Pervez Musha-rraf in Havana. Future talks with Pakistan on a peace pro-cess hinged on its response.

 Singh did not dwell on corruption in defence deals in the wake of the Barak missile deal case. But he said: Transparency in procurement is a desirable objective both from the viewpoint of good governance and national security. Reports critical of such processes can demoralise the services, where they are untrue, and must be directly addressed, where they are true.

 He said the defence ministry had announced new defence procurement procedures that aim to make deals transparent and also make more business possible for the domestic industry.

 But the bulk of his speech was devoted to using the military as one of the pillars to strike strategic partnerships and also on watching Islamabad on its promises to restrain militants in India.

 We have put Pakistan on notice that any democratic government of India would find it difficult to continue on the present path of addressing all outstanding issues unless the government of Pakistan deals with the issue of terrorism, Singh told the combined commanders conference.

 Pakistans involvement with the anti-terror mechanism will be the test of its intention to implement all assurances it has given since January 2004 when the peace process resumed, he said.

 Singh prefaced his remarks on Pakistan by calling for greater defence engagements with major powers because terrorist networks transcended national boundaries.

 He said Indian strategy has to go beyond action against terrorists and should also seek to modify the behaviour of the states where terrorists find safe haven, sanctuary and material sustenance.

 Pervez amazed

 Musharraf has expressed surprise over A.B. Vajpayees comment that the Agra summit failed because the Pakistan President refused to accept there was terrorism in Kashmir.

 It is amazing to hear from Vajpayee that the Agra summit failed because I was not accepting that there was terrorism in Kashmir. How could I accept this, because we say there is a freedom movement and the Indian forces are involved in state terrorism in Kashmir.

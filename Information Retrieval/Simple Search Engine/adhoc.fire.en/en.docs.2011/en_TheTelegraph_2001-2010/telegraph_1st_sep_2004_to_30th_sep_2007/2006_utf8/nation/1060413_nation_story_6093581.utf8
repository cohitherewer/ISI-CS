 US help sought in card fraud probe

 Lucknow (PTI): Uttar Pradesh police have sought help from US banks to track down customers from whose accounts crores of rupees were siphoned off by a gang, using fake international credit cards.

 The special task force recently busted the gang, which duped the banks to the tune of Rs 3.5 crore, and arrested three persons. Sleuths were also on the lookout for an NRI and a native of Punjab, who is reported to be the kingpin, task force sources said on Wednesday.

 Using a scan machine, the NRI, whose relatives owned a general store in Ohio, obtained credit card numbers when customers made payments. 

 These numbers were again scanned on magnetic plastic cards in India, which were then used as cloned credit cards, sources said.

 Left trains Saarc gun on govt

New Delhi: The Left parties on Wednesday objected to the 

Centres reported moves to make the US an observer in Saarc, reports our 

special correspondent. 

 We are unable to understand the rationale behind involving the US as an observer in the South Asian regional forum, CPM general secretary Prakash Karat and his CPI counterpart A.B. Bardhan said in a letter to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.

 The leaders wondered whether the Centres decision was an outcome of the strategic partnership between the two countries.

 They said if non-Asian powers were to be associated with Saarc, other Asean members and Russia would have a better claim. It would be better if government clarifies its position in the matter, the letter said.

 Lonely Salem

 Mumbai (PTI): Citing loneliness, gangster Abu Salem has 

urged an anti-terror court to move him from a special cell in the central prison 

to the barrack housing those accused in the 1993 Bombay blasts.

 The designated judge has asked the jail superintendent to file a reply to Salems plea.

 Honour for NRI

 Vadodara (PTI): Lucknow-born NRI doctor Khalid Hameed, an 

honorary physician to the President of India, has been appointed high sheriff 

of Greater London. High sheriff, a ceremonial post, is the oldest office in Britain 

apart from the monarchy and has been in existence for 1,000 years. 

 Baby lifters

 Pune (PTI): A hunt is on to trace the culprits involved 

in stealing a three-day-old baby from the Southern Command military hospital on 

April 8, police said.

 Police stations in Mumbai may soon have individual custody rooms instead of the system of a common lock-up in the wake of a rise in custodial deaths.

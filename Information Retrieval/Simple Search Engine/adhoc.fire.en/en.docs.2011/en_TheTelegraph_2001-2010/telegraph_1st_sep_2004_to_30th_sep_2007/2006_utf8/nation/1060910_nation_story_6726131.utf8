 New Delhi, Sept. 9: The punches thrown at Professor H.S. Sabharwal on an Ujjain college campus today came back to haunt the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad at elections in the countrys largest university.

 The Congress-backed National Students Union of India beat heavy odds to win three of the four top students union posts at Delhi University, its fortunes recovering dramatically in the past few days as its rival sank under the charges of murdering Sabharwal.

 The NSUI, which had swept all the four posts in the last elections, held on to those of president, secretary and joint secretary but lost that of vice-president to the BJP-backed Parishad. Yet, it has been a triumph for the out- fit that even two weeks ago had seemed headed for a drubbing.

 Although the union is attributing the victory to the good work done in the past year, its campaign had had a completely different focus.

 The NSUI had focused not on what it did over the past year, but on Ujjain, said Sharmishtha Ghosh, a second-year English honours student at Miranda House.

 As the news of Sabharwals death, allegedly from the blows of Parishad activists, made headlines, the mood on the campus changed all of a sudden, said Hindi professor Dr Umesh Aggarwal. The same students I had seen trying to persuade others to vote for the ABVP were suddenly quiet.

 The NSUIs Amrita Dhawan, Tarun Tanwar and Shashi Kant will be president, secretary and joint secretary. Vikas Dahiya of the Parishad will be vice-president.

 As if taking their first big step into Congress politics, the NSUI trio, all dressed in spotless white kurta-pyjamas, went to seek the blessings of Madam Sonia Gandhi in the evening and touched her feet.

 Outside the Congresss 24 Akbar Road headquarters, NSUI cadre celebrated by bursting strings of crackers and shooting them in the air from a Chinese-made launcher, forcing cars to scatter to safety.

 Its another year-long party, said an NSUI supporter as film music blared and crates of beer were transferred between vehicles. 

 Nobody was talking of Sabharwal any more.

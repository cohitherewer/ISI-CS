 For govts ears, Karat says it again

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Prakash Karat

 New Delhi, Sept. 16: Pra-kash Karat has made it clear that neither the CPM nor the Left Front will bring down the UPA government despite differences over policy matters.

 In an interview to a TV channel, the CPM general secretary said the Left parties do not intend to function as a veto and pull down the government. 

 He said his party, which has 60 MPs, had given new direction to the UPAs foreign and economic policies though it had not succeeded on all issues.

 We dont intend to function as a veto on everything and pull down the government you either accept what we say or we pull down this government. Then the government would not have lasted six months.

 We went into supporting this government knowing fully well there are basic differences between the Congress and us but the common minimum programme should be attempted to be worked at and implemented, he said.

 From the outset, the CPM had said it would not destabilise the Congress-led dispensation because of the threat from the BJP and the NDA. The NDA, the Left said, was waiting to step in.

 The Left has clashed with the government on foreign policy and economic reforms. It took a strident posture on the Indo-US nuclear deal and forced the Prime Minister to make a statement in Parliament outlining the parameters within which negotiations are to be worked out. 

 It also pulled the government back from divestment of profit-making non-navratna PSUs.

 At no time has the CPM and the Left been able to influence policies at the national level to the extent that is happening today. We have shifted the whole terrain of political debate in the country and we have shown that on every question we give no quarter, Karat claimed.

 He said the CPM was intervening in foreign policy matters though BJP leader L.K. Advani had been insisting that the Left should have no say in foreign policy and security matters.

 Karat, however, conceded that the Left had not been able to stall the government on policy bills that could be introduced in Parliament without its consent. 

 But it had stalled at least six bills that required its support, such as the pension fund bill.

 Today the situation is any divestment in profitable PSUs will not take place because theres widespread political opposition, and thats not confined to the Left. Weve created that climate, Karat said.

 On the womens reservation bill, he said the government would have to bring it in the next session of Parliament. There is no other way, he said.

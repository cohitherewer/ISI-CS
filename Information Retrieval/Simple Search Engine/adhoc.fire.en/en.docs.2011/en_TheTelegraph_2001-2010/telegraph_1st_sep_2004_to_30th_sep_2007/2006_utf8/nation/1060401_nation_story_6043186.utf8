 Chhattisgarh stage for Naxalite battle

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New 

 Delhi, March 31: Chhattisgarh seems set to become 

 the main theatre of war against Naxalites.

 A meeting of the coordination committee of rebel-infested states and home ministry officials today indicated as much.

 The state has been the most vulnerable to Naxalite violence in recent months. Out of 391 incidents across the country so far this year, 162 occurred in Chhattisgarh alone. In terms of civilian casualties, too, the state is way ahead. It recorded 105 deaths out of a total of 157.

 According to a home ministry official, most in the coordination committee agreed that Chhattisgarh has got the rebels jittery because of the increasing support to Salwa Judum, the peoples movement, and are desperate to thwart it. 

 Naxalites know their fate largely depends on who wins the battle in Chhattisgarh?. We know they will do their best to step up violence in the state. The focus thus is Chhattisgarh, he said. 

 Union home secretary V.K. Duggal reiterated the Centres commitment to Salwa Judum. What we need is to sustain the popular movement in its strongholds with the help of security forces and then let it expand slowly. We need to install a system to give them protection. 

 A fortified shield for the movement is part of the set of plans drawn up by the home ministry to counter the rebels. Chief among them is a strategy to blunt the Naxalites most lethal weapon ? Chhattisgarhs landmines. 

 We will help Chhattisgarh employ expert army officials to de-mine their jungles, Duggal said, adding that the defence ministry has given the permission to take help from 20 retired officers.

 Delhi has also allowed Chhattisgarh to give an insurance cover of Rs 2 lakh to Salwa Judum activists.

 Chhattisgarh has asked for more special police officers, and the home ministry is likely to give the nod. The state has appointed 3,500 such officers on an honorarium of Rs 1,500 a month and wants to take the number to 2,000 in each of its 12 rebel-affected blocks. 

 Turning his attention to poll-bound Bengal, which has also been in the grips of Naxalite violence, Duggal said the Centre is considering the state chief secretarys request for two helicopters to keep a vigil on possible attacks during the election.

 We are concerned about West Bengal?. We have sent 600 companies of central paramilitary forces there and are considering to send some more, said Duggal.

 Hyderabad, Sept. 8: Andhra Pradesh police today seized over 600 rockets and dozens of launchers and landmine-making machines that Maoist rebels, apparently on the run in the state, were trying to shift outside.

 The police had last night chanced on a truck carrying two rockets and launchers near Jangireddigudem village in Mahbubnagar district and arrested two persons. 

 Their interrogation led to a raid on an unmanned arms dump in the nearby forests, throwing up a cache of 600 rockets, 12 launchers and 22 landmine-making machines.

 Hours later, during a routine check on transport offices in Giddalur town, Prakasham district, the police stumbled on 27 huge parcels containing rockets and 12 launchers. The town, 263 km southeast of Hyderabad, is close to the Maoists village strongholds.

 The parcels, booked in Tamil Nadu, had been lying unclaimed for over a month, said Prakasham police superintendent N. Balasubramanyam. He added his men were searching the warehouses of all the transport operators in the district.

 Senior officers said the rebels, who have suffered a series of setbacks in the state in the past year and a half, were trying to move their weapons to neighbouring Chhattisgarh and Orissa.

 The Maoists have been shifting base after their state secretary, Madhav, was killed in July. Most of their leaders have moved to Chhattisgarh.

 We already had the Maoists on the run. It seems they planned to move their weapons, too, said state police chief Swaranjit Sen.

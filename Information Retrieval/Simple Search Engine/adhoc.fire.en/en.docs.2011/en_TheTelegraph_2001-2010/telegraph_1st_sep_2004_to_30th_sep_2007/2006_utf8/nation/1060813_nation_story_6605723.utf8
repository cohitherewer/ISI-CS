 Death for army recruitment

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Jammu, Aug. 12: Two elderly men were killed in a village in Poonch district late last night for daring to defy the diktats of militants. They had allowed their sons to take part in an army recruitment rally held in Poonch last month.

 Militants of Lashkar-e-Toiba entered the houses of Mohammad Bashir and Shad Khan in Kullali village in the south of Pir Panjal, about 220 km north of Jammu. The two were dragged out and shot. 

 The Lashkar militants left behind a handwritten note in Urdu, asking, We are here, why did you forget it?

 Earlier, Lashkar had issued a decree against army recruitment in the area. 

 But Shads son Mohammad Arif and Bashirs son Mohammad Javed, both in their twenties, joined the recruitment rally in Poonch last month. 

 They were found physically and mentally fit for recruitment, official sources said.

 Bhopal banishes Chacha Nehru

 Bhopal, June 21 (PTI): The BJP government in Madhya Pradesh has removed a poem on Jawaharlal Nehru from school textbooks. 

 The poem Chacha Nehru Mujhe Bana Do was struck off the Class I syllabus while the late Prime Ministers memoirs on his wife Kamla was dropped from the Class VII course.

 The move comes a week after popular nursery rhymes like Baa, baa, black sheep and Twinkle, twinkle, little star were banned from the school syllabi.

 The state governments decision to remove the poem on Nehru and his writings has sparked a controversy with Opposition parties accusing it of saffronising education on RSS directives.

 Threatening to launch a state-wide stir, Congress workers burnt an effigy of chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan. Several children wearing Nehru sherwanis also took part in the demonstration. 

 The Left parties, too, condemned the changes in the school syllabi and accused the BJP of trying to end progressive values among children.

 However, state school education minister Narottam Mishra denied any political designs behind the move and said the changes were made on the recommendation of an expert committee.

 Though Nehrus poem and his memoirs were dropped, another of his writings, Vaseeyat, and portions of letters written by him to Indira Gandhi, Pita Ki Chitthi Beti Ke Naam, were included in the syllabus.

 Rubbishing Mishras claims, state Congress general secretary Manak Agrawal sought governor Balram Jakhars intervention in preventing RSS-directed saffronising of education.

 The state government had earlier replaced several poems from the primary school syllabus with new ones saying it was an attempt to reduce western influence on children and to inculcate national sentiments among children. 

 But how can it justify the move to drop Nehrus writings? state CPM secretary Bahadur Singh Dhakad asked.

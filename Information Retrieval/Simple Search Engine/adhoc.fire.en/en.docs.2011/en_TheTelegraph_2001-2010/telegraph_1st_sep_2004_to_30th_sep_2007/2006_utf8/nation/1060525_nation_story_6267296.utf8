 Home again for dead Pak boy

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, May 24: Mohammad Sharif is going home to Pakistan on May 30, 16 years after he left for Jeddah as a 10-year-old and more than a decade after his family performed his last rites.

 Since 2004, Sharif had been living at Kakori police station, 12 km from here, waiting for word from home that he thought would never come. A phone call at 3.30 pm on May 1 had the youth, who has spent the better part of his life in detention, crying like a baby.

 Abhi to aap ko yakeen ho gaya hai main zinda hoon. Main aap ka beta Sheru (Now do you believe I am alive. Im your son Sheru), he told his mother sobbing.

 After two years in a Jeddah jail, six in a juvenile home in Uttar Pradesh, four in Lucknow jail and two at the police station, Sharif will return home to Karachi where his mother Husainara Begum and younger brother Mohammad Amin live. His father is no more.

 The process of his repatriation is finally over. We will take him to the Pakistan border on May 30 and he will finally be leaving for home, the station house officer of Kakori police station, Pramod Kumar Pandey, said.

 Sharif, then only 10, had left for Saudi Arabia in search of work with step-brother Abdul Ghafoor in 1990. Ghafoor, who had introduced him as his son in the country to which they had travelled illegally, slapped rape charges on him two years later. He alleged that I had raped his wife, Sharif recalled.

 A lower court sentenced him to death and news travelled to Pakistan that he was executed in Jeddah. 

 Sharif says he was cleared of the rape charge on appeal but sent to jail for two years for lying and other offences. At the end of the jail term in 1994, when Saudi Arabia decided to deport him, Sharif had only a forged Indian passport his step-brother had given him. So he was deported to Mumbai.

 The youth says he met Rafiq, who was with him in jail, on the flight and he brought him to Lucknow but left him at the station.

 Soon after, Lucknow police arrested him because he had no valid papers. Sharif was tried under the Foreigners Act and sent to the juvenile centre, where he received primary education and training in carpentry. In July 2000, he was moved to Lucknow jail and on October 10, 2004, the court ordered his release and repatriation.

 Since then, his address has been Kakori police station because this was the area he was picked up from. He could not be sent back to Pakistan as his family did not believe he was alive.

 Even after chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav spoke to Pakistan high commissioner Aziz Ahmed Khan, in town for film director Shaad Alis wedding in January, nothing appeared to be moving because the family were disbelieving.

 Then, Pappu appeared. The Kakori resident saw him at the police station earlier this year before leaving for Karachi where his wife was visiting her parents. While in Karachi, Pappu got in touch with Sharifs mother and made her call him.

 Sharif, who is counting days to his return, says: I will work as a carpenter and I can never forget India.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

Forget the spirit, its time to fight back 

SHOBHAA D Eacute;

How I hate statistics. Im staring at the headlines 

and turning away from those cold, harsh numbers: 11 minutes, 7 blasts. 190 dead. 

Im reading everything listlessly, my mind numb, my eyes glazed. We already 

have a name for what happened last evening ? Terrible Tuesday. Thats how 

it will be remembered from this moment on. Bombay ? The Bomb Blast Capital 

of the World, declares a daily, almost as if its some sort of a macabre 

boast, a grisly achievement. 

We are with you, Condi Rice is assuring 

us. So is Tony Blair. And of course, our general from across the border, Pervez 

Musharraf. Something snaps within me. Oh yeah? I say to myself. How easy it is 

to utter such inanities, such platitudes. 

A girlfriend calls from Karachi on my cellphone. Her 

number doesnt flash. Private, reads my display. Wearily, I take 

the call, wondering which foreign journo it could be, sweeping down for an appropriate 

quote to file the mandatory copy, more concerned about a deadline than the dead 

of my beloved Mumbai. I dont feel like cooperating with co-hacks. 

I refuse to go on TV channels, hastily putting the right mix of concerned panelists 

together for prime time specials. I cannot, will not, be a part of the media-circus 

dishing out well-rehearsed sound bites in a safe and cosy studio. 

And I absolutely will not stoop to saluting the Spirit 

of Mumbai one more bloody time. Ive had it. Im up to there. 

And I dont need to draw the worlds attention to this amazing spirit 

of ours. I want to yell, scream, protest and hit back. I dont want to be 

ladylike and generous, calm and resilient. Hell no. And Im pretty sure its 

this very spirit of ours that has allowed the most recent atrocity to take place. 

Had we been more vigilant, more angry, more aggressive the last time such a ghastly 

crime was committed against it (2003), perhaps we would not be the sitting ducks 

waiting to be annihilated with such ease, as we were.

Why Mumbai? Thats the dumbest question to ask. 

And yet, so many informed and intelligent people have been asking it since the 

first bogey got ripped apart at 6.24 pm, Khar station. It is shameful that the 

Union home minister should squeak his apology after the horror of the attacks 

had hit home. For him to acknowledge that there was enough information available 

to suggest something major was in the offing, but that the intelligence agencies 

had no clue as to where, how or what would be the target, is a pathetic admission. 

If they did not possess that most vital piece of information, what are they talking 

about in that case? 

In retrospect, its easy to claim the government 

agencies werent sleeping on the job ? but damn it ? the truth is, they were! 

And someone must take the rap, own up responsibility and tell us what the next 

step is going to be. I suspect well hear nothing, for they have nothing 

to say. There is no plan in place, there is nothing by way of disaster management, 

and all those self-important mantris sitting in Delhi dont have a 

clue. They are as dazed as those hapless commuters one saw on TV, babbling incoherently 

while trying to make some sense out of the monumental tragedy.

There is a devilish method to the madness. Mumbai 

is a marked city. Let us make no mistake on this score. Once we face up to this 

brutal truth, we shall have to ask ourselves what to do the next time such a thing 

happens. For it will. And the demons orchestrating these terrorist attacks are 

not going to wait for 13 years. Or even two. 

Why should they? Theyve seen for themselves 

how easy it is to hold Mumbai to ransom. They know how vulnerable the metropolis 

is. Theyve realised Mumbai is the safest target in the world. Unprotected 

and naked. Anybody can waltz in with anything and blow it up. Doesnt take 

much. Just a few willing volunteers who can nonchalantly and effortlessly 

move around the city, planting explosive devices that go undetected till ? Boom 

? they blow up a few hundred innocent citizens. Nothing happens even after that.

The people of Mumbai are cho chweet, they 

forget so fast ? they forgive so easily. Look at them ? back at work already ? 

not even 24 hours have passed. And see how they helped one another ? complete 

strangers offered their homes, shared meals, shared emotions. Wah! Wah! Really, 

these Mumbaikars are amazing. 

Yes, sir, we truly are amazing. And I hate us for 

being so. Amazing does not mean accommodating. To hell with being resilient. Its 

high time we fight back ? fiercely, ferociously, fearlessly. Only then will I 

be able to hold my head high as a Mumbaikar.

We owe our dead at least this much. Let us not insult 

their memory by being passive. By being nice. Tough times need tough 

people and tough talk. You have the citys marching orders, Mr Deshmukh. 

Start walking!

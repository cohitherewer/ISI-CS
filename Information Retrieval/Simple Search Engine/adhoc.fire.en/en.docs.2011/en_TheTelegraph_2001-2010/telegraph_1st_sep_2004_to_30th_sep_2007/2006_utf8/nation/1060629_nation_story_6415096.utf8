 17 years on, lifer freed 

 Calcutta, June 28: A man spent 17 years in jail on the basis of a dying declaration that was not produced in court.

 Calcutta High Court today acquitted Biren Pardi of Haldia, found guilty of killing his wife by a Midnapore judge.

 Pardi was arrested on January 13, 1989 after brother-in-law Aswini accused him of setting his sister Kanchan afire. 

 The public prosecutor said in the trail court that Kanchan had made a dying statement indicting her husband for her death. 

 The sessions judge con- victed Biren on the basis of the submission and sentenced him to life without verifying the existence of the statement. 

 While going through pending cases, the high court discovered that a life convict had been languishing in jail for 17 years. On its own, the court appointed an advocate for Pardi and heard his appeal.

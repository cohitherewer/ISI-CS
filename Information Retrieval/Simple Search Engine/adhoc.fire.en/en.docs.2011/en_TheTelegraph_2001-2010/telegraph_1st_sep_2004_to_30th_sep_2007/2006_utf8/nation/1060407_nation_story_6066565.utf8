 On way to Bangla, leader from Bengal

 Lucknow, April 6: Slim, dark and of medium height, Mehboob Ali Mondal could have passed for just another studious young man.

 Studious, he might be, but police believe he is much more. The man from rural Bengal, they say, headed a terror outfits module involved in the blasts that bled Varanasi last month.

 The 34-year-old from North 24-Parganas Bongaon, held yesterday with four others, acted as the Bengal chief of the Bangladesh-based outfit Harkat-ul-Jehadi-al Islami (HUJI) and helped recruits cross the porous border for arms training, police sources said.

 Today, all five were remanded in judicial custody. They were planning to blow up a Hanuman temple in Aliganj tomorrow during the Ram Navami festival, the police said, showing letters and other documents seized from the group during yesterdays raid.

 Mondal has been one of the most trusted hands of the Harkat-ul-Jehadi-al Islami. He was the leader whenever members of the organisation used to visit Bangladesh, said Rajesh Pandey, a superintendent in the special task force (STF) probing the blasts that claimed at least 20 lives.

 Task force sources said a team of investigators from Lucknow is scheduled to visit North 24-Parganas to unravel the link between terrorists there and in Uttar Pradesh.

 The police said Mehboob visited Bangladesh five times and Pakistan twice.

 On his first visit in February 2004, Mehboob could not meet HUJI chief commander Maulana Asad Ullah. His tenacity paid off when he again went to Bangladesh towards the end of that year. It was Asad Ullah who, impressed by his dedication to the cause, told arrested blast mastermind Waliullah, the outfits chief in India, to take Mehboobs help whenever he wanted to send youths for training to Bangladesh.

 But Mehboob was a man who wore several hats. At times, he worked as a pesh imam ? or one who conducts namaaz at a mosque ? in Bengal. He also got a degree from a western Uttar Pradesh seminary to become a mufti. He developed contacts in Lucknows old city and even stayed in Mumbai and Hyderabad.

 He had one address in Murshidabad, too, which perhaps made investigators think he was from that district.

 Mahbook is intelligent, tenacious. He has got training in handling all kinds of weapons. He was also the most forthcoming during interrogation, said STF special superintendent S.K. Bhagat.

 He said he was not afraid of anything, Bhagat added. He was even ready to become a suicide bomber for the cause of the Bangladesh-based organisation.

 A senior state home department source said the police would soon send a fact-sheet on the Bangladesh-based outfit to central intelligence agencies so that Delhi can take up the threat from the outfit at the highest diplomatic level with Dhaka.

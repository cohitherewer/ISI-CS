 Scare feeds on jet and blast

 Mumbai, Aug. 13: A cooking gas cylinder explosion in ritzy Malabar Hill and an emergency landing kept the terror-spooked city on tenterhooks today.

 Investigations into the blast showed that a leaking LPG cylinder in a sweet shop exploded, causing the first floor of a three-storied building, Sagar Cottage, to cave in. Five people were injured and one killed.

 The ground floor that took the brunt of the attack, housed the sweet shop and a caf. The first-floor flat, owned by an NRI, was empty. A diamond merchant, Paresh Shah, and his family lived on the second and third floors. 

 I was woken up by the explosion. It shattered the window panes of our third-floor flat. My daughter lives on the second floor. I screamed for help from the balcony, said Shahs wife. The rest of the family escaped, but she had to be rescued by fire-brigade personnel.

 With the ground and first floors damaged, civic officials declared the structure unsafe and demolished it. Residents blamed illegal cylinders in the sweet shop and caf. 

 We had complained to the BMC that these establishments were using commercial gas connections without permissions or safety clearance, but it did not take action, a resident said.

 Local Congress MP Milind Deora visited the spot and promised to look into the grievances. I will meet state government officials for rehabilitation of residents who lost homes in this mishap. We will try to get temporary accommodation for them, Deora said.

 Even the fire brigade staff smelt gas. But we are not ruling out any possibility and investigating all angles, deputy commissioner of police Pratap Dighavkar said.

 The other incident that frayed already-jangled nerves occurred at the airport, where a London-Mumbai Jet Airways flight made an emergency landing after reporting an engine snag. It touched down around 12.45 pm amid full emergency measures. 

 The flight made a safe landing. All passengers on board were safe. We have a well-planned drill for such emergencies and all ended well, airport director R. J. Treasurywala said. All 198 passengers, including four infants on board the Airbus A340, were fine.

 Security has been tightened at the airport after the plot to blow up 10 US-bound flights in mid air was busted. Over 24 suspects have been arrested, including a London-based Jet Airways employee.

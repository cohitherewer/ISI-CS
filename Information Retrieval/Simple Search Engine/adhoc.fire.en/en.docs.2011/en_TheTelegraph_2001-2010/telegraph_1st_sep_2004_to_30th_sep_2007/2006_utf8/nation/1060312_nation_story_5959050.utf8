 China talks

 New Delhi, March 11: Top Indian and Chinese officials spent the day today coming to grips with complex boundary questions before they leave for Kottayam for some houseboat diplomacy tomorrow, reports our special correspondent. 

 National security adviser M.K. Narayanan and Chinas executive vice foreign minister Dai Bingguo have been appointed as special representatives by the two governments to speed up a settlement on border issues.

 The India-China boundary is divided into western, middle and eastern sectors. The most tricky parts in the dispute involve Aksai Chin in the western sector and Arunachal Pradesh in the eastern sector. 

 The two sides have not resolved the issue despite several rounds of deliberations.

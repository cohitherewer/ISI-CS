 Gowda ice yet to melt

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 New Delhi, Jan. 24: Efforts to stem the Karnataka political crisis intensified today when Congress chief Sonia Gandhi met Janata Dal (Secular) leader H.D. Deve Gowda. 

 Sources described the meeting as an ice-breaker which remained inconclusive. 

 The two are likely to meet again tomorrow. That both sides want to ensure that the Congress-Dal (S) coalition is somehow salvaged was apparent when the Sonia-Gowda d?tente was brought forward by a day. They were earlier scheduled to meet on January 25. Gowda was reportedly prepared to meet Sonia in Hyderabad during the AICC plenary but she did not want it.

 The sources said if a breakthrough has to be achieved, it has to be now or never because only two days are left for the trial of strength chief minister N. Dharam Singh will face in the House following the split in the Dal (S).

 Gowdas spokesman in Delhi, Kunwar Danish Ali, said their endeavour was to keep the communal forces at bay. He refused to divulge details of the negotiations. 

 Congress sources disclosed that Gowda had placed a set of demands which were being examined. 

 It is believed that Gowda is still firm on his son, H.D. Kumaraswamy, being made the chief minister, a demand the Congress was reluctant to consider. Gowda also wanted Karnataka Congress chief Mallikarjuna Kharge to be replaced. This, too, was reportedly unacceptable to the Congress.

 The Congress sources said the back-room strategists, including Pranab Mukherjee, were in touch with Karnataka leaders. Any decision that is taken will have their backing. So the chances are 50:50 and the situation is fluid, said a source.

 Their only hope was Gowdas own predicament of earning the label of an opportunist who was ready to do business with the BJP and his palpable keenness to avoid the tag. 

 CPM general secretary Prakash Karat also met Gowda and asked him to stay with the secular forces.

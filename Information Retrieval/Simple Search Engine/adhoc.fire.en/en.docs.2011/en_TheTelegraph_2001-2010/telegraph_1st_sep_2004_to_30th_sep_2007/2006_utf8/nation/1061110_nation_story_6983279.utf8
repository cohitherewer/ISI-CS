 Dont overfeed thin babies

 G.S. MUDUR

 New Delhi, Nov. 9: Attempts to fatten children who were born low birth-weight babies even after they turn two could put them at high risk of diabetes and heart disease in adulthood, doctors have said.

 Medical studies in India have validated a decade-old hypothesis proposed by British doctors that under-nutrition during foetal life may raise the risk of these adult diseases, paediatricians said at a conference here.

 The results of these studies conducted in New Delhi and Vellore are significant enough to be incorporated into child care practices, said Harshpal Sachdeva, former professor of paediatrics at the Maulana Azad Medical College in New Delhi.

 Low birth-weight and thin infants are more likely to have diabetes or heart disease in adult life, said Palany Raghupathy, former professor of paediatrics at the Christian Medical College in Vellore.

 Its important that parents do not overfeed such children after they turn two in their attempt to help them catch up with other children who were not born underweight, Raghupathy said.

 Surveys suggest that about 31 per cent of Indias infants just under one in three babies are born underweight because of poor maternal diet or other medical reasons. A foetus adapts to under-nutrition by permanent changes in its body metabolism, said Caroline Fall, an epidemiologist at the University of Southampton in the UK.

 Fall was among a team of researchers at Southampton led by David Barker who had proposed in the early 1990s what is now known as the Barker hypothesis -- that some adult diseases may have foetal origins.

 The foetal adaptations to under-nutrition lead to lack of properly developed pancreas, lack of muscle, and high levels of cortisol, the stress hormone, said Fall.

 These changes pave the way for an increased risk of diabetes and heart disease in adulthood. Its crucial that such children do not gain too much weight beyond two years of age, Sachdeva said.

 Without precautions against weight gain, by the time such children turn into young adults, it might be too late to do much. We need to identify this subset of children and prescribe rigorous lifestyle measures to control weight and other risk factors that also contribute to diabetes and heart disease, he said.

 Doctors in Vellore and New Delhi validated the Barker hypothesis by tracking down several thousand people who were born between 1967 and 1973 and whose birth records had been stored. The studies showed that thin infants had a higher risk of displaying impaired glucose tolerance, a signal of impending diabetes.

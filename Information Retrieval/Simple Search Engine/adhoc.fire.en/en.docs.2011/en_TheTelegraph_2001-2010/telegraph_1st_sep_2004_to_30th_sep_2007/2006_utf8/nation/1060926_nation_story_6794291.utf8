 Student killed in Moscow

 Moscow, Sept. 25 (PTI): A final-year Indian medical student was stabbed to death at St Petersburg last night in a suspected case of racial attack.

 Nitish Kumar Singh, 27, a student of Mechnikov Medical Academy, was attacked near his hostel. 

 Some students found him lying on the ground near the hostel for foreign students and called police and an ambulance.

 However, Singh succumbed to multiple stab wounds before the ambulance arrived, the NEWSru.com web portal reported.

 The police, who have lodged a criminal case, do not rule out racial hatred behind the killing of the student.

 Foreign car? Be careful

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chennai, June 7: Watch it, there could be trouble behind the sleek foreign wheels you just whooshed by in.

 The Directorate of Revenue Intelligence today claimed it has busted a racket in which used foreign cars are dismantled into spare parts/accessories before they are imported, reassembled locally and put up for sale.

 Such a racket has been unearthed in India for the first time in decades, DRI additional director-general P. Babu said. 

 One Ramadoss and his son Suresh, both automobile engineers running a garage in Chennai, were behind the racket, he said. Three other city garages have been identified.

 Several big car brands ? Mercedes Benz, Mitsubishi GTO, Honda, Mitsubishi Lancer, Toyota MR2, Toyota Silica and Volkswagen ? are believed to have been sucked into the racket.

 A Volkswagen ready for sale and another car sent to Bangalore are among those seized, 17 of which were in various stages of assembly.

 Babu said the body of the cars would be cut into three to five pieces and the parts declared in the bill of entry as used car spare parts/accessories. The imports would be made in the name of the private garages.

 Once in India, the pieces would be welded together to resemble the original car, given a fresh coat of paint and put up for sale to unsuspecting buyers.

 After reassembling, they can make a handsome profit as used cars will be cheaper than imported ones and look as good, Babu said.

 The ingenious method of importing them as spare parts helped the racketeers evade the 118 per cent customs duty on import of foreign cars, he said.

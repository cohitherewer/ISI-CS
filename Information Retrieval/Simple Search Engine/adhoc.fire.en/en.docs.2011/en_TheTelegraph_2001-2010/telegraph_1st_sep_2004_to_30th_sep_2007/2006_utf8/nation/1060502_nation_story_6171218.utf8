 Natwar in probe prod

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 1: Former foreign minister Natwar Singh today urged the Justice Pathak inquiry panel examining allegations of kickbacks into the Iraq oil-for-food scam to speed up its probe. 

 The authority had issued a notice to Natwar as his name figured on the list of non-contractual beneficiaries in the Volcker Committee report.

 This was the second notice issued to Natwar, who has denied any role in the scam, as the panel found his responses to the first evasive.

 A second notice was sent to his son, Jagat Singh, whose responses were also evasive and lacking any substantial information on issues highlighted in the Volcker report.

 Both father and son have denied direct or indirect involvement in the scam.

 The inquiry panel was set up after the Volcker report named some politicians and the Congress as non-contractual beneficiaries in the oil-for-food scam.

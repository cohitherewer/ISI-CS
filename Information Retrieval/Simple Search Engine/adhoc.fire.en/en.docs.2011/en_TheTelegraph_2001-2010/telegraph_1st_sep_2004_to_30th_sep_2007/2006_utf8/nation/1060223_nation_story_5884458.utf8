 Valley alert on winged guests

 MUKHTAR AHMAD 

 Srinagar, Feb. 22: The Kashmir wildlife department has sounded an avian flu alert as thousands of migratory birds make a stopover here before heading to their summer homes in China, western Europe and Siberia.

 These birds also come here during this period from the plains of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Orissa, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra. The beginning of spring is the period we must remain on maximum alert to track down birds that might carry the virus to Kashmir, said Mohammad Shafi Bacha, the state wildlife warden.

 So far, more than 800,000 migratory birds have come to Kashmir from western Europe, China and Siberia, but only three species are suspected to be carriers of the H5N1 virus, Bacha said. These are the brown-headed gull, the cormorant and the bar-headed geese.

 He added that brown-headed gulls and cormorants are just birds of passage and stay in the Valley for very short periods.

 But the bar-headed geese spend some months in the Ladakh region of the state for breeding, Bacha said.

 The state government has banned the entry of poultry and poultry products into the state, which arrive mostly from Punjab, Himachal Pradesh and Haryana.

 However, state minister for animal husbandry Taj Mohiuddin said the ban is temporary and has been imposed purely as a precautionary step and would remain effective for 10 days only.

 M.K. Turki, the joint director of the local animal health department, said teams of experts from his department, armed with the latest equipment and sample collection kits, are visiting different parts of the state.

 Although the wildlife department has dubbed the Valley a high-risk area, Turki said there is no reason to panic. We have no report of any bird deaths that could be pinned to the dreaded H5N1 virus so far, he said.

 But the people are not taking any chances. Local restaurants have taken poultry off their menu. We stopped serving guests with chicken and eggs right from the day the news was aired on the electronic media, said the manager of a restaurant in Srinagar.

 Dealers in poultry and poultry products virtually had no sales in the last three days.

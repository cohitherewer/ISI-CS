 Uma in poll struggle

 Bharti: Uphill battle

 Budhini (Madhya Pradesh), April 14: In her first electoral foray after leaving the BJP, Uma Bharti is struggling to make a mark in the Assembly byelection which will decide the fate of chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan.

 Budhini, 70 km from Bhopal, will vote on April 24.

 Uma is backing the Gondwana Gantantra Party (GGP) nominee, Gulzar Singh Markam. With less than 10 days to go for the polls, the GGP, a regional party, is way behind the BJP and the Congress.

 Umas associates admit that by supporting the GGP, they are confronted with a number of problems.

 First, Sangh parivar outfits like the VHP and Bajrang Dal are not supporting Markam. They argue that the GGP has been traditionally opposed to the Hindutva ideology.

 The GGP has been projecting tribal heritage and customs to drive home the point that tribals have their own customs and religious tradition.

 Second, Umas failure to field her own candidate has demoralised even her die-hard supporters. The official explanation is that Uma is yet to form her political outfit and has, therefore, chosen to back the GGP. But the argument gaining currency is that Uma could have demonstrated her strength had she fielded her own candidate.

 When Uma campaigned in Budhini last weekend, she focused on the Ram temple issue, making references from the Ramayana and the Mahabharata. GGP leaders said such a campaign made little sense to the tribal voters running into over 30,000.

 Compared to the GGP, the Congress seems to be in a beter position to challenge Chauhan. Its candidate, Raj Kumar Patel, is a local leader and has represented the seat in the Assembly. 

 He is assisted by an organised team of party leaders and has lined up several senior leaders like Union minister Suresh Pachauri and AICC general secretary Digvijay Singh to campaign for him.

 Chauhan, too, is leaving little to chance. Though confident of victory, he is spending most of his time touring villages falling under his constituency.

 His wife, Sadhna, has also been touring independently, urging people to vote for Chauhan. Asked if she would scold the chief minister if he failed to fulfil election promises, Sadhna said: Woh to mere parmeshwar hain (He is my God).

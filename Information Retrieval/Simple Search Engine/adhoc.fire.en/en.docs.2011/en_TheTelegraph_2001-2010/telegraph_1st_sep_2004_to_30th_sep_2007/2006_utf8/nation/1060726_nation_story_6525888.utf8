 Last laugh yet for Venugopal

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 25: The government today withdrew its appeal seeking to revoke the high court stay on AIIMS director P. Venugopals sacking after the court threatened to dismiss it.

 The Centre will, however, file fresh charges against Venugopal in the high court, the governments chief counsel Gopal Subramanium said.

 Subramanium signed an undertaking withdrawing the charges against Venugopal minutes after Justice Vijender Jain threatened to dismiss the Centres appeal.

 Before we file fresh charges, the list of charges will be presented to Venugopal and to all other members of the institutes body, said Subramanium.

 The decision amounts to a virtual acceptance on the part of the government that it had acted hastily in dismissing the AIIMS director without giving him enough time to respond to the charges against him.

 Venugopals appeal to the court on July 6, a day after he was sacked, had alleged that he was not given adequate opportunity to respond to the charges. 

 The government plea in the high court has a list of 45 charges against the AIIMS director, including his support to the anti-reservation strike that paralysed the institute in the second half of May. The government also alleged financial mismanagement.

 In his petition, Venugopal has accused the government of malice and mala fide intentions behind his sacking ? claims the court appears to be buying.

 Pro-reservation students and doctors at AIIMS are, however, miffed at what they see as the governments soft peddling on Venugopals dismissal.

 The government has no serious intent in dealing with either Venugopal or the anti-reservation protests that stopped AIIMS from functioning in May, said Vinod Bajpai of the Medicos Forum for Equal Opportunities.

 Subramanium, who is representing the government in this case, is defending Venugopal in another case simultaneously ? a fact these doctors and students say shows the governments lack of intent.

 Could they not have found any other advocate? Why choose someone who may have a conflict of interest? asked a senior faculty member at AIIMS.

 Subramanium is defending Venugopal in a case where he has been charged with holding two government posts ? AIIMS director and head of its cardio-vascular department ? at the same time.

 According to most experts, however, Subramanium is in the clear as long as the two cases have no bearing on each other.

 Only if the two cases are interlinked, i.e. the same evidence may have to be provided in both cases, would it be unethical, said Kamala Sankaran, senior faculty at the Indian Law Institute in Delhi.

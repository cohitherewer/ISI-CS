 India trails Pak on power to women

 New Delhi, Dec. 4 (PTI): Statistics show that India fares poorly compared with its South Asian neighbours in womens representation in national legislatures, even as the wait for the womens reservation bill continues. 

 While there are 8.3 per cent women in the Lok Sabha, the lower House in Pakistans national assembly has 21.3 per cent women, according to a written reply given by minister of state for women and child development Renuka Chowdhury in the Rajya Sabha today.

 Bangladesh has 15.1 per cent women in its parliament, while Maldives, too, fares better with 12 per cent women in the national legislature.

 The upper house in Pakistans national assembly has 17 per cent women.

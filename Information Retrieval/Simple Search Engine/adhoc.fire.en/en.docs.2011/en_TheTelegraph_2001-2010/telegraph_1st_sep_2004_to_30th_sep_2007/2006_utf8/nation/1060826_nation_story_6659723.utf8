 Negligence rap on AIIMS

 New Delhi, Aug. 25 (PTI): A consumer court has asked AIIMS to pay Rs 2 lakh as compensation to relatives of a woman who died because of alleged negligence.

 The Delhi state consumer disputes redressal commission ordered the hospital to pay the amount in a month. It rejected AIIMSs contention that it did not fall under the purview of the consumer protection act as it was a premier research centre.

 Whatever be the main object of the establishment, the fact remains that it has also been entrusted with the task of maintaining one of the most well-equipped hospitals for patients, said the commission.

 Under the guise of providing research facilities, the institute cannot be allowed to treat patients as guinea pigs, it added, allowing the complaint filed by the relatives of the deceased Asha Mathur.

 The complaint said Mathur was brought to the hospital to undergo an angiography. 

 After the test, she was advised to undergo angioplasty, a procedure used to dilate narrowed blood vessels by inserting a balloon-tipped catheter. But the patient died during the operation.

 Talaq over phone, wife moves court 

 Durban (PTI): An Indian-origin Muslim 

 woman divorced by her husband over the phone has moved court 

 seeking recognition of her marriage according to South African 

 law.

 I was returning from Durban with my father and our son. He telephoned me to say he was driving to Durban... and wanted our son to spend some time with him. An argument ensued and he ended our eight-year marriage by issuing the Islamic divorce with the words talaq, talaq, talaq, Moolla said.

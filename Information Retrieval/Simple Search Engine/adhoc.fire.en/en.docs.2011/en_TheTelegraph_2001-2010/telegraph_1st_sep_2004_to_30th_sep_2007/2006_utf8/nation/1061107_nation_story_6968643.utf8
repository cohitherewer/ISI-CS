 In Goa, Gandhi has two faces

 Sanjay Dutt reads up on Gandhi in Lage Raho Munnabhai

 New Delhi, Nov. 6: Gandhism will feature in the auditorium and Gandhigiri nothing official about it will frolic on the beach.

 While the International Film Festival of India 2006 runs through its 11-day course, beginning November 23, there will be film screenings elsewhere in Goa as well. Including beach screenings at half-a-dozen places.

 Over 100 films will be shown at the festival, in the competitive and non-competitive sections. On the same days, in capital Panaji and other towns, the organisers will screen movies not featured there.

 These would include cult movies an official today listed Lage Raho Munnabhai and Rang De Basanti among them and animation films.

 Also planned are music concerts, childrens workshops and film bazaars where trade people will discuss business.

 At the official festival, Richard Attenboroughs Gandhi and not Munnabhai will be seen.

 As this year marks the centenary of Gandhijis satyagraha, the festival is honouring the Mahatma with a special screening of the 1982 film. The organisers the Goa government and Union information and broadcasting ministry have failed to get Attenborough to attend, though.

 He wont be able to come, I amp;B joint secretary V.B. Pyarelal told a news conference, also addressed by Goa chief secretary J.P. Singh. Actors Sohail Khan and Riya Sen, too, had come along to promote the festival.

 IFFI 2006 will open with the Pedro Almodovar-directed Volver, starring Penelope Cruz, and close with Brad Pitt-starrer Babel, made by Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu. The organisers are trying to get Pitt, who is in India, to attend but arent sure if he can make it.

 Shashi Kapoor is the chief guest at the festival, which will feature a Prithviraj Kapoor retrospective. There will be retrospectives also on Rolf de Heer, Javier Bardem and G. Aravindan.

 The festival will honour S.D. Burman, Hrishikesh Mukherjee and Satyajit Ray. The country focus will be on Argentina, but films from around the world will be showcased in the non-competitive section.

 Pakistan sent in one entry but it didnt make it past the jury. Australian director De Heer is part of the international jury that will pick the best movie for the Rs 10-lakh Golden Peacock award. 

 Lips sealed on Bachchan

 Authorities of the film festival are tightlipped about whether Amitabh Bachchan would be invited. Last year, the actor had been asked to inaugurate the festival, but the organisers backed out at the last minute. Next question, was the Goa chief secretarys reply to all Bachchan-related queries.

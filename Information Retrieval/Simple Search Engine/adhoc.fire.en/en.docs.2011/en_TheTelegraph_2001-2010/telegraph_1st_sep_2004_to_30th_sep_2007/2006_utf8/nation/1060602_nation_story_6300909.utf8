 Srinagar, June 1: Rita Ghosh of Agarpara, tending to her husband, Dinanath Ghosh, in Barzulla Hospital is numb with shock. We only want to go home. But we are being looked after. If it were not for these people ? she points to the doctors, the paramedical staff and the police who have surrounded her ? I dont know what would have happened to us.

 Last night, there were many local people who queued up at the hospital to donate blood and were sad to be turned back because there wasnt so much demand.

 We have been able to inform our families and relatives back home, thanks to the assistance given to us, says Paresh Mandal of Bidisha Travels, who was organising the tour group that was returning from Gulmarg.

 There is a tourist officer from the Jammu and Kashmir government at each of the hospitals. Imtiaz Ahmed Khan, a 28-year-old plainclothes policeman at the SMHS hospital, runs from bed to bed inquiring after the patients, taking messages from one family member to another. You can rest assured that they (the patients) are in safe hands.

 Our doctors are experts in trauma care. Each of them has handled so many cases of people injured in firing or in explosions, says Imtiaz.

 Last evening, local journalists and photographers found time to hold the patients and give first aid despite the pressures of their assignment.

 We left in the morning around 6.30 for Sonamarg. Surajit Ghatak of Rocky Travels (Barrackpore) was our guide. We were tired by the time we returned to Srinagar and were five minutes from our hotel when this happened. My daughter Dipannita (8 years) is safe and unhurt, says Rita.

 There was confusion in the hospitals because the police and the local people did not follow the language. Even if some of the tourists spoke in Hindi, the pronunciation was unfamiliar. It is most difficult to record the names.

 Some of us were carrying mobile phones. But we did not know that only post-paid connections work in Kashmir. We all had prepaid phones, says Biplab Dutta.

 The tourism department has now left two mobile telephones with the patients for calls from home.

 Dutta manages a smile because he recalls that the managing director of the Gopalpur (Orissa) hotel had asked him if he thought it was safe to visit Kashmir. I told him: dont worry we are travelling in a group. And he joked: is it a militant group?

 Phulu Roy, the 63-year-old lady travelling alone, has something similar to narrate. My son and daughter-in-law were advising against the trip but Paresh Mandal said we will take good care of her and he has been. There are six or seven people in our group who are even older than me and we were enjoying the trip, she says.

 Then she lapses into shock again: Can you believe it I saw him (the assailant) and he was a kid!

 Rashid Butt, an assistant director with the tourist office who is posted at the SMHS Hospital, is almost ashamed. Horrible. What has happened is terrible. We just dont understand why? And Sujay Datta, who is being returned to the ward after being X-rayed and whose father is critical, consoles him: You are not to blame.

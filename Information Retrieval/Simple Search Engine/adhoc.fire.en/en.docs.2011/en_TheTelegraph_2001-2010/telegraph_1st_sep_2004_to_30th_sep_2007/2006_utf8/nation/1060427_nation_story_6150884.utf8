 No quota rethink yet

 New Delhi, April 26: The human resource development ministry appeared unfazed by todays display of anger by medical students over the proposed quota for OBC students. 

 The ministry is determined to go ahead with the Mandal formula of 49 per cent quota in higher educational institutions, including IIMs, IITs and medical colleges. 

 This means an addition of 27 per cent reservation for OBCs to the existing 15 per cent and 7.5 per cent quotas for Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe students. 

 Todays demonstrations ?first outside minister Arjun Singhs residence and then at Jantar Mantar ? are being seen as the first indication of what to expect once the quota is formally announced.

 Ministry officials said they are not contemplating rolling back the Mandal formula or slashing the 27 per cent quota. The proposal is pending before the cabinet, which will take it up after the elections.

 The officials pointed out that the 93rd Constitutional Amendment Act has already introduced reservation for educationally and socially backward classes, which include OBCs. All that the Centre is now planning to do is bring a bill to implement this guarantee in the Constitution, they added. 

 There is also an opinion within the ministry that an anti-quota agitation today cannot assume the proportions of the anti-Mandal agitation of 1990 following the then Prime Minister V.P. Singhs announcement of 27 per cent reservation in government jobs for OBCs.

 It is believed that an anti-quota agitation now will be met with an equally forceful pro-reservation agitation by OBC students. 

 Analysts pointed out that the political complexion of the country has changed since 1990. More assertive after Mandalisation, OBCs are keen to safeguard the right the amendment act has given them. 

 The pro-quota students will not lack support from the political establishment either. All political parties had supported the amendment act that was moved in response to a Supreme Court order scrapping quotas.

 Modi: Under scanner

 New Delhi, Nov. 29: An eight-member team from the ruling UPA will be in Ahmedabad tomorrow to assess if rehab packages the Centre had announced have reached Muslim victims of the 2002 riots and remind them that they have not been forgotten.

 Many of these victims still live in makeshift camps in sub-human conditions and the task of the United Progressive Alliance delegation, sources said, is to inform the nation through Parliament whether they have got the relief meant for them.

 We will also check on the political situation, said Sanat Kumar Mandal, an RSP MP who is part of the team.

 Team member Madhusudan Mistry, a Congress MP from Gujarat, said the objective was to tell the victims they had not been forgotten.

 With Assembly elections a year away, the Congresss stakes in Gujarat are high. We have to make a beginning by taking a clear stand vis--vis the minorities and not allow ourselves to get browbeaten by the BJPs pro-Hindu campaign, said a leader involved with Gujarat affairs.

 The team, which has representatives from the secular spectrum, includes Basudeb Acharya and Mohammed Salim (both CPM), C.K. Chandrappan of the CPI, Forward Blocs S. Basu, Alok Mehta of the RJD and the Samajwadi Partys Ramji Lal Suman.

 The Union home ministry is also planning to send a separate team to follow up the recommendations of the National Commission for Minorities.

 The commission had visited Gujarat in October and found that 5,703 riot-affected Muslim families were still stranded in transit camps. It accused the Narendra Modi-led BJP government of abdicating its responsibility and asked the Centre to announce a relief package.

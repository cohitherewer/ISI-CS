turnover: 3 chiefs in 3 years

Bhopal, Nov. 21: The Madhya Pradesh BJP today got a new president, the third in as many years the same as the number of chief ministers since the party came to power in December 2003.

 New appointee Narendra Singh Tomar quickly got a taste of things to come when his colleague and former Union minister Phagan Singh Kulhaste said his performance will be closely watched.

 We would not tolerate any injustice, Kulhaste said even after he was taken to the party high command in Delhi to tone down his reservations on caste lines.

 Tomar, a Thakur, has replaced former Union minister Satyanarain Jatia who hails from the weaker sections. Scheduled caste and scheduled tribe components in the state unit had opposed Jatias exit, saying his removal would send a wrong signal to their voters. 

 Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan, who backed Tomar, rejected the argument, saying the BJP culture does not recognise caste considerations. 

 Echoing his sentiments, party general secretary Anant Kumar today asked partymen to gear up for Mission 2008 to ensure a second term for the party in the state.

 However, Jatias exit remained shrouded in mystery. In his year-and-a-half tenure, the party did well in all municipal, Assembly and parliamentary elections. It also did not witness any major controversy.

 When the BJPs organisational polls got underway, it was thought that Jatia would be given another chance following the partys convention. But a senior leader said today: Woh adjust nahin ho paye (He could not adjust himself).

 According to party insiders, chief minister Chauhan was not getting along well with Jatia and lobbied hard with the central party leadership and the RSS to get rid of him. 

 Chauhan found favour after successfully humbling expelled leader Uma Bharti in the recent Bada Malehra Assembly and Vidisha Lok Sabha byelections.

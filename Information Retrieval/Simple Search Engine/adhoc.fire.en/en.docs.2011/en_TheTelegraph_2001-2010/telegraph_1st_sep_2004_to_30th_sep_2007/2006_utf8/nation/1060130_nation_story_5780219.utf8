 Nagas set truce term

 BHARAT BHUSHAN

 Bangkok, Jan. 29: The National Socialist Council of Nagalim (Isak-Muivah) wants the extension of its ceasefire with Indian security forces to be conditional on Delhi fulfilling commitments specified in advance.

 It was, therefore, unwilling in todays negotiations to specify any time period for the ceasefire extension. The mood seemed to be to further cut short the period of extension.

 Indian negotiators, however, told the NSCN (I-M) that if the ceasefire extension was curtailed further ? say, from six months at present to three months ? then that would be construed as an insult to the government of India.

 Minister of state Oscar Fernandes and former home secretary K. Padmanabhaiah are pushing for a one-year extension of the ceasefire, claiming that doing so for only six months would do more harm than good to the NSCN (I-M).

 They told the NSCN (I-M) negotiators, led by general secretary Thuingaleng Muivah, that a shortened extension would send the wrong signal to rival groups ? they would assume all is not well with the peace process and would be encouraged to jeopardise it further. This was what happened because of the last extension of six months, they claimed.

 Fernandes and Padmanabhaiah are believed to have told Muivah that there was a contradiction between his claiming to have tremendous faith in the Prime Minister, Sonia Gandhi and the Union home ministers commitment to peacefully resolving the Naga issue and, at the same time, not being inclined to extend the ceasefire long enough to explore a solution.

 The Nagas, they said, must ask themselves whether they had gained or lost from the eight-and-a-half years of ceasefire and then take a balanced view on its extension. Muivah agreed with them but said that Delhi would have to commit to some confidence-building measures to sustain the ceasefire.

 Muivah charged the Indian government, especially the army, with encouraging the NSCN (I-M)s rival groups in a bid to control it. Therefore, among other things, he demanded that the government make a firm commitment that it would not use any group against the NSCN (I-M) during the ceasefire. 

 If Delhi did not do so, Muivah argued, there was no point in extending the ceasefire.

 For its part, the government is proposing that the two sides recognise that the commitment to a peaceful negotiated settlement had been given at the highest level and that some progress had, in fact, been made in the past, even though the last eight months had not been very productive. It wants the two sides to jointly identify the roadblocks to a settlement and extend the ceasefire by a year to enable this process.

 To meet the NSCN (I-M)s concerns about the ground situation during the ceasefire, the government seemed willing to give a renewed commitment to honour and implement the ground rules of the truce both in letter and spirit. 

 This was to assuage the Naga concern about groups inimical to the peace process being propped up deliberately. The negotiators also proposed a joint exploration of some new initiatives to break the deadlock in the peace process.

 While the decision on the period of ceasefire will be taken tomorrow, indications are that the extension itself is almost certain. 

 Doubts, however, continue to be expressed by the Nagas about Delhis attitude to the ceasefire. All that Muivah said after todays negotiations was that the discussions were heated and serious. 

 Preferring to announce a positive outcome tomorrow, Fernandes limited himself to saying: I have no comments today.

 A seven-member delegation of the apex organisation of the Naga tribes, the Naga Hoho, was scheduled to arrive tonight in the Thai capital, led by its president Horangse Sangtam. 

 The Hoho leaders are likely to meet the Indian negotiators and submit a memorandum to them, giving their views on ceasefire extension and explaining how Delhi could have used the previous period more productively.

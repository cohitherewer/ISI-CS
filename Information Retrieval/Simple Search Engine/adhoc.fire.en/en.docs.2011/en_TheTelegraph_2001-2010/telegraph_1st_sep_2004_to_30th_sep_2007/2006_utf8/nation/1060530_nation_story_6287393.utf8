 Military pact with China

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 29: India and China today signed an agreement on cooperation between their militaries that envisages joint training and drills in some areas ? a confidence-building measure that New Delhi and Beijing can claim to have worked out despite the yet unresolved disputes on the border.

 Defence minister Pranab Mukherjee and General Cao Gangchuan, Chinas minister of national defence, today signed the memorandum of understanding on exchanges and cooperation in the field of defence in Beijing.

 India and China have been steadily increasing military interactions but so far this has been limited to non-combat areas such as search and rescue and/or demonstrations of firepower. 

 The militaries are also engaged in confidence-building measures along the Line of Actual Control along the border. 

 The border disputes are being discussed by special envoys but have not been allowed to stall military-to-military interactions.

 India and China fought a war in 1962 and India has for long perceived a pro-Pakistan tilt in the Chinese military. The formalisation of military exchanges in this background is a fillip to the negotiations that are currently on and buttress the understanding that the two countries have reached to a limited measure.

 The MoU is a major confidence-building measure in the defence field between India and China and is expected to contribute towards building up greater understanding and trust, a defence ministry statement issued here said.

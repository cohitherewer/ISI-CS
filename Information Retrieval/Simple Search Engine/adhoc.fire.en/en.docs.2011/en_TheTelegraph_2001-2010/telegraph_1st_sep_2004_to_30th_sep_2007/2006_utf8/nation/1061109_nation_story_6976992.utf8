 The Nepal road map and the amber light 

Deal on arms, power talks on 

 BHARAT BHUSHAN

 New Delhi, Nov. 8: In an unprecedented and historic development, the decade-old Nepalese Maoist armed insurgency has agreed to separate its combatants from their weapons, put them under international supervision and join a multi-party government to build a new Nepal.

 Maoist leader Baburam Bhattarai may be the next deputy Prime Minister of Nepal. On December 1, he could be one of the five Maoists leaders to join the 23-member cabinet of octogenarian Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala. 

 Of the two top Maoist leaders Prachanda (Pushpakamal Dahal) and Bhattarai only one would join the cabinet. 

 With the senior leader, Prachanda, preferring to stay out, Bhattarai is expected to join as deputy Prime Minister. However, these are early days yet, and much backroom manoeuvring is expected before the cabinet assumes a final shape.

 The Seven-Party Alliance is understood to be reluctant to offer any of the three key portfolios of home, defence and finance to the Maoists. 

 Not counting Koirala, his party the Nepali Congress will get five portfolios along with an equal number for the Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist Leninist) and the Maoists. Sher Bahadur Deubas breakaway Nepali Congress (Democratic) also wants five berths but may have to settle for less.

 A breathtaking road map has been agreed to. The Maoist Peoples Liberation Army numbering 35,000 would go into seven cantonments at Kailali, Surkhet, Rolpa, Palpa, Kavre, Sindhuli and Ilam districts.

 In each district, there would be three separate camps for the combatants. Weapons would be stored only in the main camp under lock and key of the Maoists but with a UN seal, monitored by closed-circuit cameras and motion sensors with sirens. The two satellite camps would only house combatants without arms. The upkeep of the combatants would be the states responsibility and a ministerial committee would oversee their eventual rehabilitation.

 We were insisting on separation of arms before the Maoists joined the government. This will happen by November 21, Shekhar Koirala, one of the key negotiators of the peace deal, said from Kathmandu. 

 Prior to that, by November 16, a comprehensive peace agreement would be signed with the Maoists. By November 21, an already agreed interim constitution would be adopted by the existing 205-member House of Representatives, which would then dissolve itself.

 On November 26, a 330-member expanded interim Parliament would be convened. The Maoists would get 73 seats while 48 MPs would be nominated from tribals, regions, professional organisations and oppressed sections. 

 From the existing House of Representatives and the upper House, 209 members would be in the new Parliament, excluding those who opposed the democracy movement. 

 On the day the new interim Parliament is constituted, the Maoists would disband their Peoples Governments and Courts. An interim government would be formed, which would in turn form interim district, town and village local bodies with Maoist participation for local governance and hold elections to the Constituent Assembly by June 2007. 

 The Constituent Assembly would have 425 members 205 elected from existing parliamentary constituencies, 204 elected on the basis of proportional representation and 16 nominated members. 

 The Constituent Assembly would decide the future of the monarchy the king will have no role in the interim period.

 A special constitutional court would settle contentious issues.

 Two commissions would be set up. There would be a commission to recommend state restructuring to end class, ethnic, linguistic, cultural, religious and regional discrimination. The other would be the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (Satya Niroopan tatha Mel-milaap Ayog) to heal the wounds of a nation deeply divided by violence.

 Former Nepal foreign minister Chakra Prasad Bastola, while welcoming the agreement, said: The immediate agreement deal with combatants but leaves out two important issues the future of Maoist militia and the terms of reference of the interim government. 

 The peace agreement to be signed with the Maoists must address the question of the militia, he felt.

 Shekhar Koirala said the Maoists demand that the militia be absorbed into Nepal police had been rejected: They are essentially Maoist cadre. If after the formation of the interim government, anyone is found carrying arms, the law will take its course.

 Bastola felt the interim government with Maoist participation should have a limited mandate. It should be responsible for the Constituent Assembly elections and for routine governance only. The Maoists must not be allowed to convert the interim government into their version of a peoples government.

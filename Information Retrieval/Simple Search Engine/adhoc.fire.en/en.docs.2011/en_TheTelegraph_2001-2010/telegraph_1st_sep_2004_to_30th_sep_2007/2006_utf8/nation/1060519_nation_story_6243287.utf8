 IIMA alumni voice seat fear

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Ahmedabad, May 18: Former students of the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, today joined the anti-reservation chorus, saying more seats to absorb the impact of quotas for Other Backward Classes would have an adverse effect on IIMs.

 We are scared of the governments proposed move to increase seats which, we believe, is going to affect the quality of education and reputation of the institution, said Amal Dhru, the president of the Ahmedabad chapter of the IIMA Alumni Association.

 Dhru, who appears to have taken a cue from Infosys chief and IIMA governing body chairman N.R. Narayana Murthy, said increased quotas could drive the brightest students abroad.

 Narayana Murthy had earlier voiced his reservations on the Centres move to more than double the proportion of seats reserved for backward sections and tribes to 49.5 per cent in educational institutions, including IIMs and IITs.

 Dhru is, however, optimistic that the Group of Ministers, set up by the Prime Minister, would come up with positive suggestions on how to handle the issue. We are just waiting for the Group of Ministers to give suggestions, he said.

 IIMA authorities officially refused to comment, but sources said most faculty members fear the government will not go back on its proposal.

 With political parties united on the move, the question, said a senior faculty member, was how to go about it so that the impact is less damaging. We are already over-stretched, he added. If seats are increased, it would have a very negative impact. IIMA might lose its premier status.

 Dhru said increasing seats does not mean just adding a few more chairs and tables. Infrastructure and faculty is the key thing and the government needs to consider these aspects.

 It is certainly not a question of pleasing this community or the other. It relates to our future and future generation. That is why we expect the Centre to have a re-look at the entire issue, he said.

 The IIMA alumnus said he recognised the disparities in the country and the need for affirmative action. But that should be at the school level. There should be no reservation at the higher level.

 New Delhi, Jan. 11: Amar Singh today turned to A.B. Bardhan to enlist his support in the phone-tapping case, but the CPI general secretary reportedly told him that his party has no intention of being an intermediary between him and Congress chief Sonia Gandhi. 

 Last week, the Samajwadi Party leader had met CPM general secretary Prakash Karat to discuss the same matter.

 The Left has demanded a law to ensure privacy and to ban phone tapping. If need be, there should be an amendment in the Indian Telegraph Act, Bardhan said today. Phone tapping should be banned. It should be allowed only in case of national security.

 The Samajwadi Party general secretary visited the CPI headquarters this afternoon and gave Bardhan an account of the case, which seems to be turning murkier by the day. Sources said Amar held back nothing during the one-to-one. 

 He listed several motives behind the tapping of his phones. One, he said, was to create a rift between him and Mulayam Singh Yadav, the party chief and Uttar Pradesh chief minister. A second motive could be to fix Amar in a business deal or to use his conversations for blackmailing him.

 Amar reportedly also told Bardhan that he is friendly with some actresses. One of them is Dimple Kapadia, he said. The tapes are believed to contain his conversation with some of the actresses. 

 Other conversations include those about financial dealings. During an election campaign, a friend of Amar had lent the leader his helicopter. The friend also made a donation of Rs 96 lakh to the Samajwadi Party. 

 Amar told Bardhan he has come to know that Rs 80 lakh was paid to the person who carried out the operation. 

 Amar also told Bardhan that he does not believe that Sonia masterminded the tapping. The needle of suspicion, now, seems to point towards Congress spokesperson Ambika Soni. But he added that nobody in the Congress could hatch such a plot without the party chiefs knowledge.

 Written plea as good as typed

New Delhi (PTI): Government officials under no circumstances 

should insist on applications in typed format for providing information under 

the Right to Information Act as mere handwritten requests are valid for the purpose, 

the central information commission has ruled. 

 The commission has imposed a fine of Rs 25,000 on director (Housing-II) of the DDA and public information officer J.P. Agarwal for refusing to provide certain information to Rekha Koli of Sundar Nagri, Delhi, because her application was handwritten. 

 In her complaint to the commission, Koli said she had submitted an application in February to Agarwal seeking information on the procedure to apply for a flat under the Ambedkar Awas Yojana scheme. 

 But Agarwal had allegedly denied her on the ground that the application was handwritten and insisted that it be provided to him in a typed form.

 DNA test for Fijians roots

Kochi (PTI): Kerala High Court has issued notices to the 

government and the Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology after a Fijian woman 

approached the court for a directive to conduct DNA tests on her and her paternal 

relatives in Kerala. 

 Ellis Barbara Brewer had sought the courts intervention to establish her genealogy, which she had found after a long search.

 Barbara said she only knew that her father, who died in 1975, was a Keralite who migrated to Fiji 93 years ago when he was only 15. She visited Kerala at least thrice in search of her roots. 

 Barbara learnt that her ancestral home was in Thrissur and has managed to trace two of her relatives.

 Deserter cop

 Jammu (PTI): Army troops on Tuesday arrested a special police 

officer who deserted the force and fled with an AK rifle in Doda district.

 Showkat Ali, who had fled on Saturday night with an AK rifle, two magazines and 15 rounds, reportedly joined the militant group Harkat-ul Mujahideen. 

 Babloo plea

 New Delhi (PTI): The Supreme Court has rejected underworld 

don Babloo Srivastavas plea for custodial parole to solemnise his marriage. 

It, however, allowed that his petition accusing the Centre of violating the extradition 

treaty be heard before Delhi High Court. Babloo was extradited from Singapore 

in 1995.

 Explosives haul

 Ongole (PTI): Andhra Pradesh police have unearthed a huge 

quantity of explosives, including gelatine sticks, detonators and claymore mines. 

The explosives were allegedly planted by Maoists.

A 

top Geological Survey of India official said Jaipur might be hit by an earthquake 

in the near future as mushrooming of buildings has pushed the city into the high-seismic 

zone.

 Tutor-in-hospital angle under glare

New Delhi, June 5: Police suspect that Harish 

Sharma, the late Pramod Mahajans aide, has tutored Rahul about what to tell 

investigators. 

 Rahul has denied having taken any drugs on the night of June 1-2, saying he had drunk only sparkling wine.

 Sharma got himself admitted to Apollo Hospital, where Rahul is being treated since Friday morning, on Saturday and has been interrogated under Section 201 (destruction of evidence) of the IPC.

 Delhi police today posted guards in front of Rahuls room in the hospital. He would be produced before the metropolitan magistrates court tomorrow for further remand and, depending on doctors advice, moved to police custody.

 We have sufficient evidence against him, Manish Agarwal, additional DCP, said. We have enough witnesses and statements to prove he took drugs.

 Rahuls lawyer, Sunil Mittal, confirmed that his client had denied taking drugs.

 He said it was obvious the police had arrested Rahul under pressure and we are trying to find out what that pressure is.

 Mittal said the evidence, on the basis of which he had been arrested, was not sufficient as no drugs, according to the tests carried out by Apollo Hospital, were found in Rahuls body ? a claim that is not strictly correct.

 He described the statement of Sahil Zaroo, the youth who said he had allegedly procured the drugs for Rahul, as tutored. 

 The lawyer of Sahil, who was arrested earlier in the day, today retracted that statement.

 Sharma told the police that all the four youths ? Sahil, Trishay Khanna, Karan Ahuja and Rahul Malhotra ? who visited 7 Safdarjung Road that night were Bibeks friends.

 It is a clever argument and we believe the long period during which Rahul has managed to stay in the hospital was used cleverly by the former aides of Pramod Mahajan to prepare him for the questioning. We are looking into it, a police officer said.

 The police believe Sharma used the hospital intercom to advise Rahul. They might arrest Sharma. Also under suspicion for similar reason is Sudhanshu Mittal, described as the late Mahajans business associate.

 They are also hoping that Trishay, Karan and Rahul Malhotra, who had dramatically surrendered on Friday night, would become approvers.

 The deposition of the three Greater Kailash youths, who were eyewitness (though there is doubt if Rahul Malhotra was present) before a court would be the clinching evidence of drugs being used the police are looking for. 

 The investigators plan to record their statement before a judicial magistrate.

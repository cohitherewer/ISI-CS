 Jaswant faces House sack

 - Joshi likely to get post

 Jaswant: Exit route

 New Delhi, Oct. 10: Jaswant Singhs days as leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha seem to be numbered.

 The BJP will have a new leader in the Upper House before the budget session of Parliament, sources said. Murli Manohar Joshi is said to be the most likely to get the post.

 The RSS is in a hurry to get rid of the urbane Singh, who it has never been overly fond of. The mole controversy that followed the release of his book, A Call To Honour: In Service of Emergent India, revived the Sanghs bid to oust him.

 The only reason Singh was not sacked then was that the BJP did not want any more controversies to erupt during the monsoon session of Parliament. It would have also been politically clumsy to remove a leader of the Opposition while the House was in session.

 His ouster could be scheduled for as early as the beginning of the winter session next month. But the BJP has a number of issues to settle before dealing with Singh.

 The ongoing organisational polls would end with the re-election of Rajnath Singh as party president. Rajnath then has to re-organise his team of office-bearers, a complex exercise that involves shifting of responsibilities, removing people from key organisational posts, etc. All this is to take place by December end. There is a chance that it may defer Singhs removal for another couple of months.

 At the same time, the Sangh wants him out at the earliest possible opportunity. In fact, a plan had been made to remove Singh while he was busy at Harvard University for the current semester.

 Singh is a senior fellow at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, John F. Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University. He will be attached to the universitys Asia Centre for the fall. 

 He wont be there for the whole semester. He left late in September and would be back by mid-November, said a source close to Singh.

 According to BJP insiders, the plan was to quietly replace Singh with Joshi during this period. But Singh got wind of the scheme. A meeting was reportedly called at Atal Bihari Vajpayees residence in the last week of September, a day before Singh left for the US. In the meeting, Singh managed to extract a promise from Rajnath that he would not be shunted out in such disgrace.

 What appears likely is that by the next budget session, the BJP would have a new leader of the Opposition.

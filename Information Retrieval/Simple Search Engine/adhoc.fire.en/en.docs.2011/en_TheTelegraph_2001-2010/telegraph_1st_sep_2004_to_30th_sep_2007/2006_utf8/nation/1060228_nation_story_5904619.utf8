 Soft drink panel

 New Delhi, Feb. 27: The Supreme Court today directed the Centre to constitute a committee within three weeks to look into the harmful effects of chemical additives in soft drinks, reports our legal correspondent.

 When additional solicitor-general Amrender Sharan told the court that a committee had already been set up to look into pesticide content in soft drinks, the judges said in that case, the panels terms of reference should be broadened to include chemical additives.

 The order came during the hearing of a PIL filed by the Centre for Public Interest Litigation, an NGO, which alleged that besides artificial colour, soft drinks contained preservatives like sulphurous acid, ascorbic acid, sodium nitrite, sodium nitrate and propionic acid that are hazardous to health.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Quota panel fixes formula

 - Ministers hope to give report to PM today, row spoils CWC victory meet

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 A pro-reservation march in Patna by 

 over 500 doctors turned violent as some of them clashed 

 with mediapersons, forcing policemen to resort to lathi-charge. 

 (PTI picture shows a medical student taking his colleague 

 away as policemen rain blows) Fifteen people, including 

 four camerapersons, were injured in the scuffle. The 

 government has ordered an inquiry. In Delhi, Congress 

 leader Ashok Yadav denounced the strike by medical students 

 to protest reservation for Other Backward Class students 

 and warned about a growing pro-quota movement. 

 Next Monday, the nation will witness the strength 

 of OBCs. Students of 36 universities will arrive. It 

 will be a mass movement, he told a meeting attended 

 by Delhi University and Jawaharlal Nehru University 

 students.

 New Delhi, May 19: The 

 group of ministers grappling with the reservation row appears 

 likely to suggest to the Prime Minister a three-pronged 

 approach to defuse the snowballing crisis.

 The plan is to increase seats in existing institutions, set up new ones and implement the quota in phases.

 Defence minister Pranab Mukherjee and finance minister P. Chidambaram, members of the group, met Manmohan Singh to report on progress. I will see the papers (report) and send them by tomorrow morning (to the Prime Minister), Mukherjee said.

 Human resource development minister Arjun Singh, also a member of the committee, had made public a proposal to introduce quotas for other backward classes (OBCs) in higher educational institutions, triggering a wave of protests, often violent, across the country.

 In Jawaharlal Nehru University tonight, at least three persons were injured in a clash between opponents and supporters of the quota.

 In an attempt to quell the demonstrations and end the hunger strikes against quotas by medical students, the formula being worked out by the committee seeks to protect the seats now available to general category students.

 Some figures we are working out. We are thinking of both increasing the number of seats in the existing institutions and creating new institutions. Financial implications will be worked out, Mukherjee said after a meeting of the group. 

 The general category seats which are there today will continue to be same, he added.

 Elaborating on the likely formula, Mukherjee said to implement the reservation, the seats in an institution with an existing capacity of 100 would have to be raised to 154. An increase to this level will accommodate those coming through reservation without touching general category seats.

 He said it was a preliminary idea and we are trying to put all the views together.

 It has already been reported in this paper that the government plans to implement the quota in phases, possibly over three years. 

 In Delhi, where the protests have been the strongest, medical students are planning to march from Maulana Azad Medical College to Jantar Mantar. They have invited the general public, lawyers, and students from other institutions.

 Delhi University students joined the protest today with a march. They are also likely to join the hunger strike by medical students at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences tomorrow. 

 Barely 30 of the students on fast have been able to continue, with the majority of the around 150 protesters having fainted. 

 Striking doctors, who were warned yesterday to join duty or face action, said: We burnt the notices in protest.

 The agitating doctors are also seeking an appointment with the Prime Minister.

 Advertisements will appear in the papers tomorrow to recruit doctors to replace the strikers in hospitals.

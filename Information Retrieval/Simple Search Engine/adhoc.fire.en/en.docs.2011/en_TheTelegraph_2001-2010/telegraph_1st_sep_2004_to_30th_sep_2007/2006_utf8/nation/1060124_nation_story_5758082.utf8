 AIDS fear in brothel law

 Cry for rights: Sex workers 

 at a rally 

 New Delhi, Jan. 23: The National AIDS Control Organisation (Naco) will petition the Prime Minister to drop a proposed law to punish sex workers clients, arguing it would increase the threat of HIV/AIDS.

 The cabinet has approved an amendment to the Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act that empowers law-enforcing agencies to punish sex workers customers but prevents prosecution of the women for soliciting and loitering.

 But critics argue that besides hitting sex workers livelihood, this would drive the trade underground, thus harming the current campaign for the use of condoms by clients.

 Sex workers are most vulnerable to HIV/AIDS. After a sustained campaign by womens groups, sex workers in Calcuttas Sonagachhi are now insisting clients use condoms. If the trade becomes more furtive, moving to murkier, more clandestine spots, the campaign would be hard to sustain.

 Angry sex workers are planning a march to Parliament during the budget session, when the amendment will be up for passage.

 A group of sex workers from Sonagachhi were in Delhi this week to lobby against the amendment. They met senior Naco officials who told them neither the health ministry nor Naco was consulted when it was approved.

 It (the governments stand) is moralistic and absurd, said Tripti of the Lawyers Collective, a voluntary organisation. In the name of protecting the sex worker, you will be kicking her in the stomach.

 Sweden has a similar law for punishing clients. The results have shown how much it can hurt the sex workers who have been driven underground and are compelled to work in dangerous situations, Tripti said. We want the amendment referred to a parliamentary standing committee so that more voices can be heard.

 Even this is difficult unless a sizeable number of MPs raise doubts over the amendment. So far, there have been few voices of dissent.

 We met Oscar Fernandes. He said he would do something, but we havent heard anything, an activist said.

 The organisation also managed to speak to CPM Rajya Sabha MP and politburo member Brinda Karat, who said her party would never agree to protest against the amendment though she personally may agree with the critics viewpoint.

 College for Kalpana

 Kalpana Chawla

 Panipat, April 5: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today said the Centre would discuss with Americas National Aeronautics and Space Agency the possibility of setting up a medical college in Karnal in Kalpana Chawlas memory.

 The astronaut had perished when the space shuttle Columbia disintegrated on its return journey in February 2003.

 We will discuss setting up a medical college named after Kalpana Chawla in collaboration with Nasa, Singh said, but not before he was reminded by Haryana chief minister B.S. Hooda that he had forgotten to make the announcement. The Prime Minister then turned back to the podium to make the declaration.

 According to Karnal MP Arvind Sharma, Nasa has assured Kalpanas family of help to set up a hospital or any other memorial to the astronaut from Karnal.

 The Prime Minister also promised to consider setting up a nuclear power plant in the state. As and when we move to the next phase of development of nuclear power, we will consider setting up an atomic power plant in Kumharia (Fatehabad), he said.

 Singh was in Panipat to lay the foundation stone of a 10-km stretch of a six-lane highway as part of National Highway 1 that includes an elevated 3.4-km section to decongest long-distance traffic. It would help cut short the journey to and from Delhi by at least half an hour.

 The Prime Minister said his government was investing over Rs 1,80,000 crore to strengthen the road network in the country. In the last one year, we have awarded contracts for four-laning of nearly 5,500 km of national highways. This is the highest ever since the start of the national highways development programme, he added.

 Singh said the country needs world-class infrastructure. We have set for ourselves a growth target of 8 to 10 per cent over the coming years. For this we need greater investment in infrastructure.

 Roads, he added, are links that join us to our neighbours, other regions and other countries. Roads connect farmers to markets. Roads connect consumers to sellers. They bring jobs closer to our homes.

 The Prime Minister also promised assistance for more infrastructure projects to help Haryana develop into one of the countrys most advanced states.

 Mulayam and Mayavati: 

 Business before politics 

 Lucknow, Oct. 30: At a time when Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayavati is believed to be riding a pre-poll wave, the Mulayam Singh Yadav government has surprised many by giving her a clean chit in the Taj Expressway graft probe.

 Government sources claim business trumped politics in making up Mulayams mind. They say what tipped the balance is the governments changing equations with the company that is to build the 182-km, eight-lane expressway between Noida and Agra.

 It was the BSP regime that had awarded the contract for the Rs 2,500-crore project to the Jaypee group of industries before the government fell amid a series of corruption allegations.

 Days after replacing Mayavati as chief minister in September 2003, Mulayam had set up a probe into alleged irregularities in the award of the contract and land.

 The Justice Sidheswar Narain commission handed in its report on October 25 this year saying it had found no evidence of corruption. Two days later, the state government not only approved the findings but gave the go-ahead for the project.

 Even BSP leaders seem rather surprised at the move that comes with weeks left for next years Assembly polls that will largely be fought between Mulayam and Mayavati.

 A certificate of good character from a political adversary has to be accepted with caution, but one thing is clear. Politically we stand vindicated: there was no wheeling-dealing on this project, said S.P. Maurya, BSP state legislature party chief.

 Although the report hands a breather to Mayavati, also facing a probe in the Rs 175-crore Taj heritage corridor project and an assets case, the party has decided not to go on a publicity drive over this.

 Sources in the government say theres no reason to believe that Mulayam has suddenly gone soft on his arch-rival, whom he once described as a fountain of scams.

 Its just that equations between the government and the company which the ruling Samajwadi Party had initially held at arms length because of its proximity to the previous regime has improved in the past year and a half, they claim.

 The thaw came in January 2005 when Allahabad High Court, arbitrating over the sale of cement plants and other assets of Uttar Pradesh State Cement Corporation Ltd (UPSCCL), declared Jaypee the highest bidder.

 The company then acquired dolomite and sandstone mines in Allahabad and Mizrapur, with the state government showing unusual speed in clearing the deals.

 Now the Uttar Pradesh Development Corporation, headed by Samajwadi general secretary Amar Singh, has cleared the Taj Express project.

 We are clear on one thing. If it is in the interest of the state we would avoid bringing politics into it, a corporation member said.

 A Jaypee group spokesman said: All we can say is that we are happy about the probe report.

 Mayavati had been accused of offering the entire land for the project free of cost and also waiving the Rs 50-crore stamp duty. 

 Also, as a special favour, the company was allegedly given exclusive rights to set up commercial hubs at various points along the expressway, including a couple of five-star hotels.

 New Delhi, Oct. 8: As some 900 people turned up at the All-India Institute of Medical Sciences complaining of high fever and body ache over the past 24 hours, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today visited the hospital to look up dengue patients, among whom are two of his grandsons and a son-in-law.

 Thirty new dengue patients have been admitted to AIIMS in that time, but no casualties have been reported, hospital authorities said.

 Over 900 patients have come in the past day, fearing they have dengue. Several tests need to be conducted on each patient before confirming or dismissing the possibility of dengue. It is really hard to handle, said Dr .P. Verma, a doctor at the general wards in AIIMS.

 The task for the hospital is getting tougher by the day as, other than having to take care of the steady stream of dengue patients, it now has to treat chikungunya victims, too.

 Yesterday, three chikungunya cases were reported in the national capital territory of Delhi, triggering fears that the already stretched AIIMS infrastructure would fail to cope.

 Like dengue, AIIMS is best equipped to deal with chikungunya. Since AIIMS biotechnology research is ahead of the other hospitals in Delhi, people will flood the institute if there is an outbreak of chikungunya, said a doctor.

 Along with wife Gursharan Kaur, the Prime Minister spent half an hour with two of his grandchildren and his son-in-law in the private ward at AIIMS. 

 They also visited close to 50 other dengue patients, comforting their families and inspecting the facilities for general patients. Walking down the general wards D-2 and AB-3 on the second floor, Singh spoke to each patient, enquiring after their condition and wishing them speedy recovery.

 He also inquired about the level of hygiene and sanitation at the institute from the families and patients.

 The Prime Minister was satisfied with the facilities and level of hygiene here, said medical superintendent D.K. Sharma.

 A little after Singh left, his youngest grandson, Rohan, 11, was discharged. Rohan had been admitted last Tuesday with high fever and other dengue symptoms. 

 His other grandson Madhav, 17, and son-in-law Vijay Tankha, Madhavs father, are still in AIIMS, but are recovering, doctors treating them said. They are responding very well to the medication they have been put on. They may be released as early as tomorrow, one of them said.

 Dengue cases have grown in the last two days with over 211 patients being admitted in various Delhi hospitals over the weekend, 61 one of them today itself.

 Doctors expect the numbers to start dropping slowly because, according to them, outbreak had crossed its peak.

 Asked by the high court to explain what it had done to battle dengue, the Delhi government said it would file an action taken report on steps it had taken.

 A PTI report quoted an unnamed official as saying the government and the civic body had by and large complied with the directives issued by the high court in 1998 and 2003 to prevent the spread of dengue.

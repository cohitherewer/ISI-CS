 Bus plunges into pond, 56 drown 

 Bhopal: As many as 56 passengers of a 

 bus, including 15 children, were feared drowned after the 

 vehicle plunged into a pond in Rewa, Madhya Pradesh, on 

 Thursday.

 The driver of the Rewa-bound bus from Hinoti lost control of the vehicle when its steering arm broke at a sharp turn in Govindgarh, police said. The bus plunged into the pond after crashing against a mud structure. 

 The badly patched and potholed road, too, contributed to the accident. 

 Nine persons managed to swim to safety. 

 For six hours after the accident when some lives could have been saved the Rewa district administration struggled to find divers. 

 On October 2, over one hundred pilgrims were washed away following the release of 9,000 cusecs of water from a dam in Sindh river. They were crossing the river to offer prayers at the Ratangarh Mata temple. 

 Boy killed, servant arrested

 New Delhi (PTI): A four-year-old boy 

 was killed and two of his elder sisters were injured when 

 their servant allegedly attacked them with a knife in north 

 Delhi on Thursday.

 Sanjay had stabbed Pratham Aggarwal and his sisters Prerna and Akriti, aged 13 and nine, when their parents were in another room, police said.

 The girls have been admitted to hospital in a critical condition.

 The police said robbery was not the motive behind the attack as nothing was found missing from the house and suspect it was a result of resistance by the girls to a molestation attempt.

 The servant, who went missing after the incident, has been arrested from Rishikesh. 

 Maoists killed 

 Hyderabad: Four Maoists were blown to 

 pieces when a pressure bomb exploded in their hut in a village

 SC clears air on job quotas

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 6: The Supreme Court has ruled that if a reserved category candidate who has made it to the general list of a competitive exam seeks to switch to the reserved list to bag a better job, it will not disturb the total number of reserved seats.

 While computing the percentage of reservation, such people should be deemed to be in the general category, a division bench headed by Justice H.K. Sema said while upholding a Delhi High Court order.

 The judgment assumes significance as most reserved category candidates whose names appear on the general list stake claim to the quota to get an edge over general candidates.

 Some Other Backward Classes candidates, who were not given jobs despite being on the list of successful candidates in the civil services examination, had moved court after the OBC quota was declared full.

 The apex court today said the number of seats under the OBC quota will not be exhausted simply because an OBC candidate from the general list seeks allocation of service from the reserved category.

 This reservation, under Article 16 of the Constitution, does not operate like a communal quota, the court added.

 The apex bench also directed the government to allot jobs to the petitioners.

 Straight on to arms hardsell

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 8: Washington has quickly followed up on the final bill on the civilian nuclear deal by urging India to deepen its military cooperation and induct American equipment for its armed forces.

 US under-secretary for state Nicholas Burns and the US ambassador in India, David Mulford, met defence secretary Shekhar Dutt this afternoon, hours after the reconciliation of the bill. Burns said later that the military relationship with India would be pursued as a separate ambition.

 Earlier this year, then defence minister Pranab Mukherjee had said that the offer of US arms under the Pentagons Foreign Military Sales (FMS) programme was making India review its defence procurement policies. Since then, the defence procurement policy and defence procurement manual have been revised.

 Burns said the Indian Navy will shortly acquire the USS Trenton, a large landing ship tank. An Indian naval crew is already in the US where the Trenton is being refitted for India. The ship which will be the largest in the navys fleet after the aircraft carrier, INS Viraat, is likely to sail into Mumbai by March 2007.

 There will soon be the transfer of US naval vessels to the Indian Navy. We are very hopeful that the US can participate in the transformation of the Indian armed forces, said Burns.

 Two US-based firms, Lockheed Martin and Boeing, are among other global companies vying for a multi-billion dollar Indian Air Force order for 126 multi-role combat aircraft. The Indian Navy is also considering 16 helicopters to replace its aging fleet of Seakings.

 Burns was clearly practising hardsell. We produce some of the best helicopters and fighter planes in the world and we are known to be reliable and good partners with many countries, he said at a news conference after the meeting with the defence secretary. Military sales and technology transfer will help build a long-term relationship, he said. We see India as a partner, he added.

 He was wary, though, of appearing to make the offers of military sales and transfers conditions for the acceptance of the civilian nuclear deal.

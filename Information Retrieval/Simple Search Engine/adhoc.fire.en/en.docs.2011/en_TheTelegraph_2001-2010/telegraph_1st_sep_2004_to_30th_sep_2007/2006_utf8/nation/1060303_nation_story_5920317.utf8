 Power scare for Mumbai

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, March 2: Conserve power or face disconnection, the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission has warned Mumbais residents. 

 In a fresh order today, the states power regulator directed domestic and commercial consumers to cut power consumption by 20 per cent and keep it below 300 units a month. 

 Usage exceeding 300 units could lead to temporary disconnection by Mumbais three power utilities, the order said. The step has been taken keeping in mind an expected shortfall of 250 to 275 mw in the peak hours in April and May. 

 The three power utilities ? Bombay Electric Supply and Transport Undertaking (Best), Tata Power Company and Reliance Energy ? collectively supply about 2250 mw to the city. But they are unable to meet the additional demand of 250-275 mw.

 If this estimated demand-supply gap is not bridged, then load shedding will become inevitable in the city. The commission is of the view that a well-thought and planned strategy to bridge the demand-supply gap is a better option as compared with unregulated or unplanned shutdown in case of a shortfall, the order said, stipulating mandatory load regulation targets.

 Th power regulator had suggested consumption checks in a public notice on February 14 and held public hearing for suggestions last week. Todays order came after taking into account the submissions made by NGOS, residents and the power utilities.

 Apart from middle and upper-middle class domestic consumers, advertisers and firms providing outdoor light displays will feel the direct impact of the order, which has asked the power utilities to ensure that supply is not given for illuminated displays. 

 The regulatory commission has also not spared heritage structures like Bombay High Court, the Mumbai University, the CST Terminus and buildings in the Kala Ghoda heritage precincts that are illuminated at night.

 The commission has asked essential services like the railways, the airport,water supply and sewerage systems, telephone exchanges, post offices, atomic energy establishments and hospitals to conserve power, but ruled out temporary disconnection. 

 Stating that these measures would be reviewed in the first week of April, the power regulator also asked the three utilities to be ready with a rotational load shedding plan. It appointed Tata Power to monitor the demand-supply position and submit a report.

 Tata Power has said it would source 100 mw of power from the Jindal Power plant in Karnataka and another 50 mw from Tatas Jamshedpur plant. 

 It is now eyeing another 100 mw from National Thermal Power Corporation-run 400 mw plant at Kawas in Gujarat.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Copybook Don that plays by the law

 PRATIM D. GUPTA

 Calcutta, Oct. 19: The year was 1974. Javed Akhtars breakfast script co-written with Salim Khan finally found takers as Amitabh Bachchan, Zeenat Aman and Pran came together to bail out producer-cameraman Nariman Irani. 

 The same year saw Akhtar and his writer wife Honey Irani becoming the proud parents of son Farhan.

 Three decades later, when he still couldnt get out of his mind the re-introduction scenes of Amit uncle swivelling in his chair and firing two bullets from his revolver, two-film-old Farhan set out on mission improbable to remake the cult classic called Don. 

 It stemmed from the utmost respect and the deepest love for the earlier film, Farhan confided to The Telegraph hours before the release of his remake.

 Farhan feels that through Don he will be able to re-discover himself more than anything else. For me, the film is a part of this puzzle in my mind of what my influences are, he said. 

 Once people have accepted that as a filmmaker you have a voice of your own, you can go back to the films that have influenced you and even publicly declare those influences.

 After the super-cool Dil Chahta Hai and the coming-of-age Lakshya, a new Don might have been the last thing one expected from Farhan but then it is the unpredictability that makes his films so fresh. 

 I felt the old Don lent itself to being easily adapted and contemporarised for todays sensibility and audience, he defended his choice. For a remake to work there should be something you can add to the original film. You have to tell the story in a new language or interpret the story differently from what it was.

 And thats what Farhan has done to Don taken it by its head and then turned it around. 

 With Shah Rukh Khan heading an eclectic cast of Priyanka Chopra and Kareena Kapoor, Arjun Rampal and Boman Irani, the new Dons turf is in Malaysia, not Mumbai, with chases around Eiffel Tower, not dhobi ghat.

 It walks along the footsteps of the original film but then meanders and goes into areas completely unexplored, Farhan said. So, it has a healthy mix of being true to the original and yet carving out an identity of its own.

 But the effect, Farhan feels, will be different for different audiences. 

 The explanation: Theres going to be a lot more nostalgia for someone whos seen the 1978 film. They will probably try and remember how a particular scene was done in the original how Mr Bachchan said a line or Helenji performed to Yeh mera dil... For people watching Don for the first time, it will be purely just a little action adventure thriller movie.

 With the big Don vs Don moment dawning on him, Farhan is bracing for the inevitable. 

 Theres no escaping comparisons because the original Don was a fantastic movie, he said. But the new film has been approached in a very different way. Shah Rukh has not tried to better Mr Bachchan because it cannot be bettered. He has played it very differently. At some point initially in the film, you keep thinking about the original but then once the new treatment takes you away from the earlier Don, you only think about this movie.

 Whatever be its box-office fate, Farhan hopes that Don will make remakes official. 

 We have been doing remakes of movies for some time but have very conveniently termed them as inspirations, he says. 

 With us buying the rights of the old Don, people now know that there is a legitimate way to remake a film. So, maybe with Don, its just gone from inspired by to official remakes.

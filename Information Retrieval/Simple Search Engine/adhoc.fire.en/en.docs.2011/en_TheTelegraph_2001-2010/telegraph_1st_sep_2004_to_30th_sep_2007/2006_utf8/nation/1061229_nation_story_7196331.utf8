 Thieves in burqas give jewellers the jitters

 Pune, Dec. 28 (AP): Jewellers want women in burqas banned from shopping at jewellery stores here after a series of thefts carried out by veiled robbers.

 The Pune Jewellers Association has applied to police for permission to bar people who cover their faces from their stores, said association president Fattechand Ranka.

 Ranka said the move comes after closed circuit cameras in stores showed that three recent thefts, each of jewellery valued at around Rs 4 lakh, were carried out by customers wearing burqas.

 Because of the burqa the police could not identify their faces, he said.

 Ranka said his move was not aimed at Muslims, who are a minority in Pune, but would target anyone who refused to show their faces to the security cameras. Many Hindu women also wear veils.

 Anyone could be masquerading under a burqa, even a man, he said.

 Ranka said he had sent a letter to Maharashtras police chief but had not yet received a response.

 However, Pune police commissioner D.N. Jadhav said police would not allow the ban, fearing it could spark tensions with the Muslim community. If they are really concerned about security, they can appoint saleswomen and women security guards in their shops, Jadhav said.

 The reaction among the Muslim community was mixed.

 Naseem Siddiqui, the head of the Maharashtra Minority Commission, said a ban would fuel further discrimination against Muslim women and that women should be allowed to choose what they wear.

 However, Maulana Zaheer Abbas Rizvi, the secretary of the All India Ulema Council, said jewellers are entitled to protect their livelihoods.

 They do not seem to be against any religion but are acting on purely business interests, he told a newspaper.

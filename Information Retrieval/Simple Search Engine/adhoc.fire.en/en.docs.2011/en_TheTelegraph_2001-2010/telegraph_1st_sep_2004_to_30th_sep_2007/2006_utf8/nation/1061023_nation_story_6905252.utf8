 Adhir daughter 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Oct. 22: The condition of MP Adhir Chowdhurys daughter Shreyashi, who jumped off the roof of her six-storeyed south Calcutta apartment on Wednesday, has deteriorated.

 Her vitals (are) gradually deteriorating, said a medical bulletin issued by the private hospital where the Congress leaders daughter was admitted with injuries to her head and chest and multiple fractures.

 She is on maximal ventilatory support with 100 per cent oxygen. Neurologically, she remains unconscious without response to painful stimuli. Her liver and renal functions have worsened from yesterday. Overall, she continues to be very critical and appears to be developing multi-system organ failure. 

 Hospital sources said her mother Arpita fell ill because of anxiety and had to be admitted today. She was released later. 

 Defence minister Pranab Mukherjee went to the hospital this afternoon.

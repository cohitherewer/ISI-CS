 New Delhi, Nov. 8: The sealing drive ordered by the Supreme Court has slammed into a high-profile target the Telecom Regulatory Authority of Indias (Trai) swank office. 

 The Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) today sealed the office of the telecom watchdog, which keeps the countrys telecom companies on a leash, as part of the order to seal unauthorised business establishments in residential areas.

 Work at the office, built on a plot in the residential area of Safdarjung Enclave, opposite Bhikaji Cama Place in south Delhi, stopped immediately. And with it, its official website, www.trai.gov.in, came to a virtual standstill. It is not clear how the structure came up there.

 Like the owners of other illegal structures, Trai officials had sent several requests for extensions in the time granted to close down their office voluntarily, but they claimed the municipal office never got back to them. 

 We plan to approach the apex court for an extension. We have spoken to Bhure Lal, member of the Supreme Court-appointed monitoring committee, an official said. 

 Officials said they might shift to another place, but refused to give details on the precise location of the new office. 

 The MCD today resumed the sealing that was halted after violence during the September 20 traders bandh. The action followed orders from the Supreme Court panel.

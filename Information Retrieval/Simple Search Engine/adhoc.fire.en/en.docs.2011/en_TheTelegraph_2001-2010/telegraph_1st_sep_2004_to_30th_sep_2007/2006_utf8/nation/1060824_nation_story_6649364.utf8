 Pregnant pilot fights obese battle

 SUJAN DUTTA

 New Delhi, Aug. 23: Standing in front of the office of the National Commission for Women (NCW) in the capital, Flight Lieutenant Prerana Chaturvedi-Tiwari attracts glances from passers-by because she cuts an attractive figure. 

 She is tall, for one, and this evening, she has let her hair down. Even out of uniform, which she has no right to wear currently, the helicopter pilot is a traffic-stopper in a loose pink salwar-kameez despite the evening peak hours at a busy downtown intersection.

 It is rude to ask a woman her weight. Maybe it is also sexist to report about a woman by the way she looks, especially when she is alleging gender bias. But Prerana has gone to court because the air force has categorised her as obese. 

 Yesterday, Delhi High Court asked the air force to explain the rules applied to board her out of service and to deny her a sheltered assignment involving ground duties.

 Prerana is now six months pregnant with her first child but she is preparing to plough through the smog of Delhis traffic in a bumpy auto-rickshaw and fly up to Leh, where she was last posted, and down again over the next month, all the while lugging her thick brown leather briefcase.

 Inside an officers chamber in the NCW office, Prerana puts the briefcase on her lap, opens the top and spreads out the paraphernalia of her case: the writ petition, a brief, copies of her letters and petitions to NCW chairperson Girija Vyas and Sonia Gandhi, and photographs of herself in the blue overalls of a pilot standing next to a Cheetah helicopter. 

 Such is her state now that this pilot with nearly 1,500 hours of flying has to fall back on these to prove her credentials because, she says, the air force has seized all my log books and is refusing to give them to me.

 At air headquarters, not far from the NCW, legal officers are preparing to respond to her petition in the high court. Officially, they will not comment on a case that is sub judice. But scraps of information are available about Preranas medical records. She was overweight even at the time of commissioning but was accommodated by stretching the norms. Since then, at several reviews by medical boards, her weight has fluctuated but has been on the higher side.

 For a tall and big-boned woman like me, the ideal weight should be around 66 kg, says Prerana. The medical records show that her weight is considerably higher. The air force norms stipulate that her weight should be 52 kg. When she was boarded out, the medical papers say, she was around 83 kg, 40 per cent overweight.

 Prerana argues that her weight never came in the way of her flying duties. She flew missions to Srinagar and Kashmir during the 1999 Kargil war on Cheetah and Chetak helicopters. 

 During Operation Parakram, she was posted at Jamnagar in Gujarat. For a small-town girl from Gwalior and Lucknow, flying in the air force was really big. Her parents her father retired from the Bank of Baroda are settled in Gwalior. Her husband is with the air force and currently posted in Bangalore.

 Prerana has two arguments. First, how can medical norms framed in 1962 be applied to her? In 1962, there were no women in the armed forces. She admits that there is a 10 per cent relaxation of the norms for women. Second, why should she not be given ground duties like another officer, Squadron Leader Rajesh Bhushal, who was also declared medically unfit?

 The air force says norms are equal and nothing has been done to discriminate against her. Prerana would have been boarded out even if she was a man who did not meet the rigorous physical standards demanded for flying duties. 

 The air force actually takes pride in its physical standards for flying officers. Its head, Air Chief Marshal S.P. Tyagi, was fit enough to earn his para wings qualify as a parachutist only last year at the age of 58.

 Bhushal, too, had gone to court. The squadron leader sustained a spine injury after his helicopter took a hard landing. Till the court disposes of the case, Bhushal is being accommodated on the basis of interim orders.

 Prerana is unconvinced. If I was fit in 1995 (at the time she was selected) at 22 years of age when I was 70 kg, I am fit now. Ten years later, I cannot be expected to get any younger. But I am fit. I want immediate reinstatement in the flying branch with consequent benefits for the last two and a half years (since being boarded out).

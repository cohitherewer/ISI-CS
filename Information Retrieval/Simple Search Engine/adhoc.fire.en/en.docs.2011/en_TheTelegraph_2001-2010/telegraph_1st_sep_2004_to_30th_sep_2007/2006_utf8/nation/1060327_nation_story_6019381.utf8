 Bird flu balm 

 New Delhi, March 26 (PTI): The government today decided to grant a one-time reduction of four percentage points in interest payments on bank loans taken by poultry unit owners.

 The step was taken to aid the poultry industry, which has been badly hit by the outbreak of bird flu.

 The interest payment cut would apply to accounts of all poultry units with commercial banks, co-operative banks and regional rural banks (RRBs), said Union agriculture minister Sharad Pawar after a meeting representatives of the poultry industry.

 The amount required for the interest cut would be released to the banks for crediting to all such accounts very soon, he said.

 The Reserve Bank of India has also issued a series of instructions to provide relief to the poultry industry. 

 The instructions cover a moratorium of one year on the payment of principal and interest (for term loans and working capital due to all scheduled banks and RRBs), conversion of working capital into term loan and making them payable over three years.

 The RBI would also allow rescheduling of term loans and permission to draw additional working capital, depending on the commercial viability of each unit after conversion of working capital to term loan. 

 Also defaulted accounts would not be treated as non-performing assets, barring wilful default.

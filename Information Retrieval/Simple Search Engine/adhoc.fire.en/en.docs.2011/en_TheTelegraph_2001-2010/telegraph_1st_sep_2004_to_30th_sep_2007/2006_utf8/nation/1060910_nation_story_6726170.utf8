 Lone doctor, a 100 victims

 Malegaon, Sept. 9 (Reuters): 

 A lone doctor at a small private hospital here struggled 

 today to treat some 100 bomb victims, single-handedly operating 

 on dozens of them to take out splinters and sew up gaping 

 wounds.

 Residents first took survivors of yesterdays explosions to a state-run hospital close to the blast sites, but services there were soon overwhelmed.

 Relatives then moved the wounded quickly to a private hospital run by general surgeon Farhani Syed Ahmad, who had only a couple of assistants when the injured began pouring in.

 The government hospital is like hell. There are no doctors, no medicine, nothing, said Osman Abdullah Khan, whose brother Obeidullah, 13, received serious wounds on his legs and abdomen. My brother would not have survived if we had not brought him here.

 The frugal but clean two-storey hospital is just a few miles from the state-run hospital, where only about 10 of the wounded remain. Most of the rest are under Farhanis care and in another hospital in a nearby town.

 The middle-aged, soft-spoken surgeon rushed to his hospital when he heard of the blasts despite being ill himself. We have around 100 people here, many of them critical, he said, coming out of his small operation theatre after removing splinters from the body of a young man.

 He then toured the general wards to check on his patients, most with limbs or heads wrapped in bloody bandages.

 Crowds of relatives waited anxiously, many huddled in groups on the ground.

 A single doctor is doing what the whole government machinery has not been able to do, said Azhar Ahmad Mohammed, whose cousin lay in a semi-conscious state after surgery to remove splinters from his neck and chest.

 But the doctor is untouched by the praise. Im just doing my duty, he said.

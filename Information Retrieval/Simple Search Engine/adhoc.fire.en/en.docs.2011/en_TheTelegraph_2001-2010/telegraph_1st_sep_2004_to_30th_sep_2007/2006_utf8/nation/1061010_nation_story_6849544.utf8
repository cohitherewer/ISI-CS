 SC leash on zoos

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 9: The Supreme Court has directed overcrowded zoos to stop breeding animals in captivity. 

 A bench headed by Chief Justice Y. K. Sabharwal ruled that inbreeding cannot be allowed in zoos where the number of animals exceeds the limit recommended by the Central Zoo Authority in 1995. 

 Peta, an NGO, alleged that the number of animals was much higher than what the zoo authority had suggested. It said the tally in the countrys 159 recognised zoos had increased from 28,607 to 41,235 between March 31, 2004 and March 31, 2005.

 In 2000, the apex court had asked the government to take steps to avoid inbreeding and overcrowding. The authority, too, had issued a directive in February 1995 asking zoos not to give permission for inbreeding beyond a limit, Peta pointed out in its petition.

 Existing rules cap the number of tigers/panthers in big, medium and small zoos at 10, 6 and 4, respectively, the NGO said.

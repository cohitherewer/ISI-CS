 Sex-on-cell racket busted

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Target student

 Mumbai, Jan. 7: Police busted a racket of selling sex clips on mobile phones last night in Mumbais northern suburb Borivli and arrested 27 people. 

 A team raided five shops in the Indraprastha Centre in Borivli West on a tip-off and found evidence of the shopkeepers selling the clips, especially to students. 

 The arrested were produced in Borivli court today and remanded in judicial custody. 

 An officer said the police were aware of the sale of sex pictures or clippings in many places. An informer posing as a client went to one of these shops and purchased a video clipping. It was then produced before the deputy commissioner of police, Zone XI, Dattratreya Karale.

 All the shops that were raided sold mobile phones or mobile phone-related services. They especially targeted college-going students. They downloaded the pictures or videos on memory cards of 128 megabytes or 256 megabytes, said the officer. 

 The charges varied between Rs 500 and Rs 2,000, depending on whether a celebrity was featured, he added. 

 Four computers, mobile phones and electronic equipment worth Rs 2 lakh were seized from the shops.

 The police, however, said it was not an organised crime. They are trying to find out the source of the material. 

 The clippings and pictures can be downloaded easily from the Internet by any one. It takes as little investment as a computer ? the reason why this is growing at an alarming speed as a subsidiary business in many cellphone shops. 

 The arrested have been booked under Sections 292, 293 and 34 of the Indian Penal Code and Section 67 of the Information Technology Act, which deals with obscene material. 

 Deputy commissioner of police Amitabh Gupta, who is in charge of Zone IX that includes Bandra, said the crime was high on the priority of the police in his area, too. But they can act only on specific information, he added.

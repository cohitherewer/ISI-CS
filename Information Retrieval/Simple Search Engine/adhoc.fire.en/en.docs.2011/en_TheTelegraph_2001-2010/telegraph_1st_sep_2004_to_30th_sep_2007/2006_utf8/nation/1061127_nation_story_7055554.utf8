 New Delhi, Nov. 26: The BJP today re-elected Rajnath Singh as its president for a full three-year term, signalling the RSS favourite would lead the party in the crucial Uttar Pradesh polls as well as the next general election.

 Rajnaths unopposed election ensures that the Sanghs grip on the party will remain as firm as ever as it heads for four state polls in the next few months.

 Both Atal Bihari Vajpayee and L.K. Advani proposed Rajnaths name. No rivals filed papers while party colleagues sent in 15 nominations for Rajnath. One of these came from the national executive members led by Vajpayee.

 His first innings got over successfully. His second innings will be more glorious. The partys future is bright in his hands. We pledge full support to him, Vajpayee said.

 Rajnath, 55, became party chief last year after the Sangh virtually forced Advani out of the post, capping a seven-month war of nerves over the former Union home ministers praise of Mohammed Ali Jinnah in Pakistan.

 Rajnaths interim one-year term witnessed a series of crises, from the expulsion of several senior leaders to the loss of power in Jharkhand. 

 But the party was buoyed by the recent successes in the Uttar Pradesh civic polls, achieved with the help of the Sangh, and the Assembly and Lok Sabha byelections in Bihar and Madhya Pradesh.

 Advani, who is believed to be upset with his successor for allowing the Sangh a bigger role in the party, joined Vajpayee in praising his leadership skills today.

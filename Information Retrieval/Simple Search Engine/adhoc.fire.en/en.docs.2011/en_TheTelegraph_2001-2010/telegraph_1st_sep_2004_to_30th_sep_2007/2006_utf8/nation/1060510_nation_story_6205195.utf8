 After 12 years, blue dawn beckons

 Thiruvananthapuram, May 9: At 5,000 feet and above, the Neela Kurinji blooms like a blue dawn.

 But its a rare blossom ? because the kurinji flowers every 12 years.

 But as May rolls towards the second half of 2006, lovers of the plant are again counting the days. The last time the flower bloomed was in 1994 and the time has come for another fleeting glimpse.

 With the flower already sighted on the Tamil Nadu side of the Western Ghats, kurinji fans are planning a trek to the Munnar-Kodaikanal hills on the Kerala-Tamil Nadu border for one last glimpse of what they call the blue dawn.

 Its not a sentimental lament. Extensive logging operations on either side of Kerala and Tamil Nadu have denuded vast tracts of the hills, harming not just the plants mentioned in early Tamil classics but also the unique shola forest system where mists turn to streams through the year and flows down the hills to join rivers.

 This time we do not know to what extent the flowers would bloom. The plants are scattered all over and those are the lucky ones to have escaped the plunder. Were undertaking a campaign to move the federal and the state governments to declare a sanctuary to protect the shola system, says G. Rajkumar of the Save Kurinji Campaign Council.

 The council has joined hands with the Malabar Natural History Society, the Group Endeavour for Environment and Natural Sustenance and the Youth Hostels Association of Indias Malappuram chapter to organise a Kurinji march this month.

 The march will start from the Kodaikanal boat club on May 21 and end in Munnar on May 23. Participants will traverse the kurinji land before the flower blooms between July and December and assess the damage to the forest system during the 12 years since 1994.

 Later in the year, when the kurinji blossoms on the mountainside like a velvet canopy, nearly 500,000 plant lovers are expected to turn up at Kodai-Munnar stretch, about 300 km from Kochi. They would also have the opportunity to visit the Eravikulam National Park, home to the Nilgiri Tahr (hill goats) which has been listed among endangered species.

 Wildlife warden Roy P. Thomas, who recently destroyed vast acres of illicit cannabis cultivation in Kambakkallu near Munnar, says there would be restrictions on visitors, whose numbers are expected to swell from the 1,000 to 2,000 a day now to 6,000 every day.

 Thomas says any effort to save the kurinji would go a long way in protecting the shola-grassland system, which has a unique microclimate that helps preserve rare flora and fauna and seems to have withstood the ravages of human depredation.

 Thats one big relief for all those who believe in preserving nature, he says.

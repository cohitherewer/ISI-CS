 Kiddy code for television

 - Govt toys with family viewing criteria

 Guided tour?

 New Delhi, June 23: Some months from now, television channels could be forced to keep children in mind when they slot their evening programmes.

 The information and broadcasting ministry is mulling a proposal under which TV channels will explicitly categorise their programmes into what is fit ? and what is not ? for family viewing.

 Existing regulations, too, forbid broadcasters from showing programmes unsuitable for children at a time when a large number of them could be watching. 

 But if the proposal gets government approval, the existing programme code would be turned more specific. It could include time-slots for different kinds of programmes ? sorted by their theme, language, level of violence and the amount of skin shown.

 Between 5 and 7 in the evening, broadcasters would show programmes for universal viewing. From 7 to 11 pm, there would be programmes which could be seen by children under parental guidance. Programmes with an adult theme and content would only be seen after 11 pm.

 The suggestion was made earlier this week by a sub-committee set up by the ministry to review the code, which now is part of the Cable Television Networks (Regulation) Act. The committee consists of media professionals, film people, educationists and women rights activists.

 The idea of slotting TV programmes this way has been toyed with for the last few months ? as part of the larger debate on the Broadcast Content Regulation Authority Bill expected to be introduced in the monsoon session of Parliament. The bill is expected to provide teeth to implement guidelines or a code for broadcasters.

 I amp;B ministry officials insisted the panels proposals were just an input which would help them take a final decision. They said the time-slots proposal was not the only suggestion that has come from committee members.

 Deciding on a time-slots mechanism itself could not be a solution of dealing with the problem of obscenity on TV, they pointed out. Defining obscenity ? as always ? will be a problem. 

 To what degree should TV really observe relaxation after 11 pm? Can the saas-bahu serials be shown before 7 pm? 

 Though a clear picture is yet to emerge, most likely these calls will have to be taken by the regulatory authority which the draft bill is understood to propose.

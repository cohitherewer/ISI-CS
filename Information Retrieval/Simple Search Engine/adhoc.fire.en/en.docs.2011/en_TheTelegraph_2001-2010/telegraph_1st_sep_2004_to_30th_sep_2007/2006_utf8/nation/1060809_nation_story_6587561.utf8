 SC asks for Tehri rehab report

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 8: The Supreme Court today directed the Centre, the Uttaranchal government and Tehri Hydro Development Corporation to submit within two weeks a status report on the rehabilitation of over 500 families likely to be affected by the increase in the height of the Tehri dam from 760 metres to 790 metres. 

 A bench headed by Chief Justice Y.K. Sabharwal gave the directive after it was alleged that authorities were not taking proper steps to rehabilitate the oustees. 

 Activist N.D. Jayal said the authorities had published a notification asking the families to move to safer places and meet officials concerned for compensation, though oustees had to be allotted alternative plots with necessary facilities as per various court orders.

 An NGO alleged that some people whose houses were submerged when the height of the dam was raised to 760 metres were yet to be rehabilitated, which the government denied.

 The bench also directed the NGO to conduct a survey.

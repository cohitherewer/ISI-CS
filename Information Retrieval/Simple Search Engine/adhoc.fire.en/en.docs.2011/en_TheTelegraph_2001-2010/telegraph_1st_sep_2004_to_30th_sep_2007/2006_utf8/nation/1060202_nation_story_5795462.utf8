 Strike bill on leader

 JOHN MARY

 Thiruvananthapuram, Feb. 1: Kerala High Court today asked a CPM leader and the block president of its youth wing to pay Rs 10,150 to the owner of a garment shop, the window panes of which were damaged by party cadre during a shutdown last November.

 This is the first time that a court in Kerala has fixed responsibility on leaders of a party that calls a strike and leaves the field open for cadre to damage public/private property.

 It is also the logical outcome of the 2001 landmark high court verdict declaring forceful shutdowns illegal and unconstitutional.

 The order by Justices J.B. Koshy and Ramkumar came on a petition by shop owner Rajan and the Kodungallur Merchants Association seeking damages. The shop is in Kodungallur in Thrissur district.

 The bench directed that the compensation should be paid within a month, failing which the petitioners could initiate appropriate proceedings, including contempt of court.

 In view of the courts earlier judgment that parties calling and enforcing bandhs were liable to pay compensation for losses incurred, the CPI(M) and DYFI vicariously are liable to pay compensation to the petitioners, the court held.

 The CPM and the DYFI denied having called the bandh, but the court said there was no reason to disbelieve newspaper reports.

 The court also rapped the government for giving a long rope to party workers who hold the public to ransom during strikes.

 The pay-up order has come on the heels of a four-month jail term given to Vadakkancherry legislator A.C. Moideen and 10 others for obstructing traffic during a rally. A first class magistrate had termed the traffic snarl a violation of the high court verdict.

 The order also came on a day the CPM laid siege to the government secretariat to protest anti-people policies.

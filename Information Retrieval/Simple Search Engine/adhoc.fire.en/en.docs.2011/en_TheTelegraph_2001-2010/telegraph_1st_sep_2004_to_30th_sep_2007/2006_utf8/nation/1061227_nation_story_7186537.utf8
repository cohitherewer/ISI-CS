 Power lure that turned fatal

 Lucknow, Dec. 26: As a second minister in the Mulayam Singh Yadav government resigned today over the murder of a university teacher allegedly involved in a sex-on-camera scam, people who knew Kavita Chaudhary said she was captivated by power.

 She used to be wonder-struck watching the VIPs and the ministers. She was haunted by the power they used to wield, said Smita Rai, a former student of Chaudhary Charan Singh University, where the 29-year-old taught.

 Chaudhary Babulal, a Rashtriya Lok Dal minister in the Mulayam Singh Yadav government, who was found to have spoken to Kavita on the phone nearly 60 times, resigned today. Earlier, he had denied any wrongdoing. She was doing a D.Litt and she wanted me to put in a word with the senior professors who were to interview her, he had said. 

 The lecturer missing since October was an ordinary student when she was growing up in Khusrupur village of Bulandshahr district in western Uttar Pradesh. But after graduating with history, she decided to pursue her post-graduation at Meerut University. By 2004, she had done a PhD in art and culture during the Mughal period.

 Kavita got the university job and moved into room No. 10 on the campus. Since early 2006, swank cars would draw up in front of her room, from which elderly men used to step out, a student said. 

 Police say Kavita used to lure politicians and her partners would secretly film the intimate scenes. They would later blackmail the VIPs, including Mohammad Merazuddin, who quit yesterday.

 A search is on for Kavitas body after Ravindra Pradhan, an accused, admitted to killing her and dumping the body into Dadri canal. Eleven fishermen have been roped in by the police. The police are also looking for three other accused.

 But Kavitas brother Sushil, who owns a shop in Bulandshahr and some farmland in the village where he lives with their mother and uncle, is disputing the police claim that she was killed on October 24. I called her on December 7, the phone rang twice before she picked up and said hello bhaiya and then someone snatched the phone from her.

 Recruited by the former vice-chancellor, R.P Singh, who was sacked last year by the governor for alleged involvement in financial irregularities, Kavita was introduced by him to some politicians from the region, sources said. 

 The Meerut SSP, Navneet Sikera, and the inspector-general, Jagmohan Yadav, both confirmed today that Merazuddin was not the only politician involved.

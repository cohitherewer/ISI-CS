 Postal policy full refund 

 New Delhi, Jan. 4 (PTI): The National Consumer Commission has directed the postal department to refund the entire investment of insurance policy holders who had prematurely surrendered them.

 Upholding a Maharashtra State Consumer Commission order, it rejected the submission of the postal department that policy holders were not entitled for refund of the entire amount if they surrender their policies prematurely. 

 The ruling came on three revision petitions filed against the order of the state commission which asked the postal department to refund the whole amount to Deepak Shelka, Maroti Sawant and Harish C. Gorakhnath who had surrendered their policies after paying instalments for over three years. 

 The commission has asked the department to pay over Rs 37,000 collectively to the three within a month. 

 The commission pointed out that the consumers were not informed of or supplied with the documents detailing the rules on withdrawal of policy before maturity.

 We expect that at least in future before entering into a policy/agreement, the petitioner (postal department) will disclose the tables of surrender value in the brochure made for policy as well as a copy thereof shall be supplied to each policy holder, it said.

 The order of the district forum as well as the state commission is substantially just and equitable and these are not such cases where this commission should interfere with the order for the sake of unknown, unpublished, surrender value that was kept secret by the postal department itself.

 Blame delay on the rain

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 14: Rain during and after the blasts may be a reason why forensic scientists are yet to determine the explosive that killed close to 200 people in Mumbai on Tuesday, say ballistic experts.

 While RDX tops the list of suspects for intelligence agencies ? because of the nature and extent of the damage ? gelatin or dynamite cannot yet be ruled out, according to the Central Forensic Science Laboratory (CFSL) in Delhi.

 We cannot confirm RDX yet, said a scientist.

 The rain, forensic specialists say, could have significantly diluted traces of the explosive substance used in the blasts, thus making investigators depend on more sensitive tests that take longer.

 The rain water could thus also have diluted the chances of quickly finding out the explosive used, Jana Kriscenski of the Serbian explosives giant Prva Iskva Namenska (PIN) said. 

 PIN is one of only two companies that officially makes and supplies RDX to armies around the world.

 Forensic scientists conduct two kinds of tests to detect the explosive used in blasts such as the ones in Mumbai.

 The less sophisticated tests ? qualitative analysis ? are simply developed versions of university-level chemistry laboratory experiments. They would not have been affected by the rain, the experts say.

 These tests analyse the nature of the material used, said a scientist at the forensic laboratory in Hyderabad. 

 Qualitative tests, however, generally fail when the quantity of substance used is little or when the properties detected could be shared by more than one explosive.

 For instance, the experts say, gelatin and dynamite are both nitroglycerine based and cannot be distinguished by using simple qualitative tests.

 Quantitative tests that can detect minuscule quantities of an explosive then come into play. RDX, according to the experts, is confirmed by such tests. But the rain in Mumbai may have made normal quantitative tests tougher.

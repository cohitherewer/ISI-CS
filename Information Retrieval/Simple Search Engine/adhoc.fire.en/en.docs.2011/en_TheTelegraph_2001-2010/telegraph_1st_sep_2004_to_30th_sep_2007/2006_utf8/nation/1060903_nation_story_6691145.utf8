 Bipasha faces parade suit 

 Bipasha Basu

 New York, Sept. 2 (PTI): The organisers of the controversial India Day parade in New Jersey plan to sue Bollywood actress Bipasha Basu for breach of contract for not participating in the event and making allegations of harassment against two of their volunteers.

 The Indian Business Association said it has constituted an inquiry, headed by New Jersey superior court judge Richard Plechner, and will file the case after the inquiry is complete, IBA sources said.

 Bipasha was invited to lead the independence day parade in Edison and some 10,000 people had collected to watch the event. But she came late and claimed she had gone through a harrowing experience at the hands of persons sent to bring her from a New York hotel to the venue of the parade.

 She said she had gone back to the hotel but decided to return and speak frankly about the humiliation she suffered in the limo sent to bring her to Edison.

 After hearing her, dozens of people left and did not participate in the parade. She claimed she had suffered some bruises which were photographed but did not file any case.

 Sex assault slur on former cop

 Jammu (PTI): A former superintendent 

 of police has been booked on the charge of sexually assaulting 

 a woman police constable in Jammu.

 Trikuta Nagar police registered a case against Chowdhary Chiragdin following a directive from the state human rights commission, which has also ordered a probe, a source said.

 The woman had complained to her senior officers in 2000 that Chiragdin, who retired in 2005, had been sexually assaulting her. But no action was taken because nothing was found to substantiate the charge, he said.

 The constable later moved the rights panel. 

 Graft scanner on officers

 Kochi (PTI): The CBI will start proceedings

 It was found that the collection ran into several lakhs a week. The bribes were collected in dollars, dirhams and riyals by customs officials and then exchanged in Indian currency with the help of three local agents.

 Singh sermon to weak CBI

 New Delhi: The Prime Minister has again denied that political interference had led to Ottavio Quattrocchis London bank accounts being de-frozen, having moments ago taken a dig at the CBI for its weak record in nailing offenders, reports our special correspondent.

 Manmohan Singh did not mention the Italian Bofors accused as he spoke to CBI officials at a function on Wednesday, but asked the agency to consider for itself whether it wasnt being slow to complete investigations and move for conviction.

 The CBI has come under repeated public scrutiny and will continue to do so, he said after laying the foundation stone for a new CBI complex. There is somewhat concern that your record in securing prosecution and conviction of offenders has been weak. You will have to address the issues of image, morale and brand-building.

 s Singh finished his speech and got up to leave, a posse of waiting journalists pushed forward and, held back by security a few metres from the Prime Minister, kept shouting one question: wasnt it political pressure that let Quattrocchi off the hook?

 The first gesture from Singh suggested he was leaving and had no time to answer questions; but his exit route brought him to within hand-shaking distance from the reporters. Somebody asked whether his silence meant that there had indeed been some political interference.

 I have already clarified my stand on this issue earlier. There was no political interference, Singh said tersely before walking off.

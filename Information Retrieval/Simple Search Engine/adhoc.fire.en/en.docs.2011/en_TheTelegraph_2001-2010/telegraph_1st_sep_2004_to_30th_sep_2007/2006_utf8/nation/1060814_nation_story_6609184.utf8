 Cola ban cloud on business

 Washington, Aug. 13 (AFP): As Coca-Cola and PepsiCo lose their fizz in India, the US government and business leaders are warning of a potential fallout on investment.

 The soft drinks giants are suffering a publicity nightmare after an environmental group alleged that their sodas contain toxic levels of pesticides, leading to full or partial bans in six Indian states.

 The clamour against Coke and Pepsi has been an unwelcome reminder to some in the US that India, despite more than a decade of economic reforms, remains a hazardous place to do business.

 This kind of action is a setback for the Indian economy, said under-secretary for international trade Franklin Lavin.

 At a time when India is working hard to attract and retain foreign investment, it would be unfortunate if the discussion were dominated by those who did not want to treat foreign companies fairly, he added.

 The soft drinks giants have hit back with a barrage of press statements and publicity campaigns in India to insist that their beverages are perfectly safe.

 So I am hoping that (US) companies dont use this as a measure to decide whether to invest in India, said Kiran Pasricha, the US head of the (CII).

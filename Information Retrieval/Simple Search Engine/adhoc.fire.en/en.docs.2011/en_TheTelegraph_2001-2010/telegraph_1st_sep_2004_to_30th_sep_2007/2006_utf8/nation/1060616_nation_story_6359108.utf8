 Sen clears contract farm air

 BISWAJIT ROY

 Nirupam Sen: Facilitator

 Calcutta, June 15: The Bengal government will not take the initiative to introduce contract farming in the state but will leave it to farmers to negotiate individually with agro-industries what they will cultivate and how, industries minister Nirupam Sen said today.

 However, if the Farmers Commission, being set up to study agricultural productivity in the state, recommends contract farming, the Left Front government would consider translating it into a policy decision. 

 The governments job is to act as a facilitator for farmers seeking access to markets for their products, said Sen, who is No. 2 in the government after Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. If we can help our farmers sell their products in the domestic market as well as export their goods, it will benefit them.

 The government is not opposed to farmers entering into a buy-back agreement with private companies dealing in agro-products either individually or in groups. But we are not going to compel them to engage in contract farming, Sen said. Neither are we going to fix prices as we want to leave it to the farmers to get the best deal. However, we will intervene if there is distress sale. 

 Sen said the government was willing to consider contract farming, which almost all Left Front constituents other than the CPM are opposed to.

 Agricultural scientist M.S. Swaminathan had recently met Bhattacharjee and suggested the introduction of contract farming with a code of conduct built into it to protect farmers interests. The CPM peasants wing had also lent its support on condition that farmers would be protected. 

 However, the CPM brass have shied away from taking any decision to avoid controversies within the front.

 In itself, contract farming is not any different from the buy-back agreement that farmers in Bengal have already started entering into with private companies.

 Under such an agreement, a farmer gets loan and technical support for producing what the company wants him to. The price for the produce is fixed in advance and the farmer has an ensured market if what he produces matches the companys specifications. 

 Pepsico India and the Bangalore-based Calypso group have entered into such pacts in south and north Bengal. Bhattacharjee has described the agro-products business as one of the growth engines for the states economy.

 The Bengal commission, conceived on the lines of the national farmers commission, will probe the state of agriculture and allied activities, including the slow-down in agricultural growth in the past decade, increase in the number of marginal land-holders and the need for crop diversification to make cultivation more remunerative.

 We want to counter fragmentation of land and the consequent marginalisation by promoting new technologies suitable for small landholdings, Sen said. We also want to counter this phenomenon by creating non-agricultural means of livelihood, which would centre around the new industries coming up in the state.

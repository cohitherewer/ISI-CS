 After axe, clean chit to Joshi

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 2: The Sanjay Joshi CD may have stung the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, but it has not deserted its pracharak. An editorial in Sangh mouthpiece Organiser declares Joshi (in picture) innocent.

 Even the Shiv Sena has come to the aid of the disgraced pracharak. Its journal Saamna has defended Joshis right to privacy. What public interest is served by exposing what Sanjay Joshi chooses to do in his bedroom? an editorial asks.

 The Organiser editorial termed the CD episode an attempt to weaken the advocates of nationalism and Hindutva by portraying them as venal, indecisive and weak on moral fidelity.

 In the last 18 months, we have witnessed a concerted onslaught as if there was a pattern and a master brain behind these plots, it says. Take the case of the former BJP general secretary, Sanjay Joshi. We have no doubt that he is the victim of an inhuman ploy. He is innocent. The CD, the audio cassette and the letters were all fake.

 The Sangh and the BJP both, however, had got Joshi to resign. The editorial reflects the growing feeling among cadre that the man has been treated unfairly.

 More such CDs are expected. A woman politician, mayor of a town, has been filmed having a bath in a hotel room. That CD is circulating. Her political career is over. Is it fair? a BJP leader asked.

 Some in the party and Sangh feel that part of the problem is the unrealistic standards the Sangh sets for its pracharaks. We didnt allow Uma Bharti to marry Govindacharya. Was that fair? How can you set such unrealistic standards for your political workers? They are human beings, a senior leader said.

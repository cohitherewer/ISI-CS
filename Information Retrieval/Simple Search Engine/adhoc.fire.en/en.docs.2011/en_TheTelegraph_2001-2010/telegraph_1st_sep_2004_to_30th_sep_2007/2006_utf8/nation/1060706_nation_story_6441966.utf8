 Allies score over PC on wages

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 5: The government today decided to retain the existing wage structure under the job guarantee law after allies Left and the RJD shot down the finance ministers proposal to peg the minimum rate at Rs 60 a day throughout the country.

 The decision to leave it to states to fix the minimum wage came at a meeting called by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. 

 Finance minister P. Chidambaram and defence minister Pranab Mukherjee reportedly favoured the Rs 60 rate for workers under the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act.

 It would have reduced the outflow of central funds for the programme ? which is 90 per cent funded by the Centre ? but meant that states which pay a higher wage would have had to scale it down.

 But RJD leader and rural development minister Raghuvansh Prasad Singh, CPI leader A.B. Bardhan and activist Aruna Roy, a former National Advisory Council (NAC) member, rejected the suggestion.

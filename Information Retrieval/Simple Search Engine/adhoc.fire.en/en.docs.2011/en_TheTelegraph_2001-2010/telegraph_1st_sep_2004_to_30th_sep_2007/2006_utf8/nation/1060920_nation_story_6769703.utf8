 IAF in for rare presidential peek

 SUJAN DUTTA

 New Delhi, Sept. 19: The Indian Air Force is set to conduct a rare review of its entire fleet by the President, the supreme commander of the armed forces, as part of its 75th anniversary celebrations at a time when air headquarters is struggling to keep up the squadron strength.

 The IAFs year-long 75th anniversary celebrations will be flagged off on October 8 (Air Force Day) amid repeated requests from the armed force for funds and resources to shore up its fighting capabilities because acquisitions have fallen way behind schedule.

 A review by the President will be the occasion for the IAF to display its entire fleet, with representative aircraft from each type, and an exhibition of its firepower. A presidential review of the IAF is a rare event. Though each President is expected to review the IAF fleet at least once in his tenure, that has not always happened.

 Officially, the air force has a strength of 35 fighter aircraft squadrons down from the sanctioned strength of 39.5 (and much less than the desired level of 44) but a more realistic figure accounting for wastage without replacement over the years is 32 squadrons. This does not include transport and trainer aircraft and helicopters.

 Air force sources said the fleet review by the President is likely to be held in Chandigarh in early March 2007 even as the IAF is scheduled to decommission several more of its ageing fleet of MiG 21 fighter aircraft. Squadrons of this aircraft have so long been the combat mainstay of the force. 

 Before the anniversary celebrations are through, the IAF expects to add the first lot of 66 British Hawk advanced jet trainer aircraft and the first of three Israeli-made Phalcon airborne early warning systems.

 The IAF is now worrying over the delay in sending out the global tenders (requests for proposals) for 126 multi-role combat aircraft, the paperwork for which air headquarters is understood to have completed. 

 Air Chief Marshal Shashi Tyagi has said more than once that he desired the aircraft to be in the IAFs fleet today. But the acquisition can be completed only in about 10 years after the government has decided the choice of aircraft from among the competitors and has signed the contract.

 In its inventory currently, the IAF has 16 different types of fighter aircraft but it is also likely to display the Tejas light combat aircraft that it has contracted from Hindustan Aeronautics. It is the failure of HAL to meet the demands on the Tejas by the IAF that has contributed in large measure to slippages in the schedule of acquisitions.

 Also displayed will be seven types of transport/carrier aircraft, including the mid-air refuellers, and seven types of helicopters. 

 It is not yet known if air headquarters will choose to display its secret Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, two of which the Heron and the Searcher Mark II have been procured from Israel.

 The total number of combat aircraft 

 with the IAF is less than 600 and air headquarters has projected 

 the need for at least 200 more.

 Second-line combat aircraft: 99

 Oh boy! Wannabe grandpa sires gender row

 - A way with words?

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Amitabh and Abhishek 

 Lucknow, Oct. 31: When Amitabh Bachchan released lyricist Sameers biography Sameer -- A Way With Words in Mumbai on Saturday, he probably did not dwell too long on the significance of the title.

 For it seems he put his foot in his mouth the next day with a casual comment in Varanasi that has women activists in the state bristling with indignation.

 At the shoot of a documentary on the development of Uttar Pradesh, the actor had said he would like son Abhishek to marry quickly. Then he added: I want to tell Abhishek to father a son.

 Women activists and students allege that by referring to the unborn childs sex, Bachchan had virtually endorsed the widespread gender bias that fuels female foeticide across swathes of the state.

 Since Monday, college and university students and social activists have been holding marches on Varanasis streets with cutouts of the actor, shouting slogans such as Amitabh Bachchan hai hai.

 (Bachchans comment) is an assault on the normal science of reproduction. If the icon publicly expresses his sexual preferences, he would simply be perpetuating the myth in society that sons are more important to a family than daughters, said Kanchana Singh, president of the Centre for Social Research (CSR), a voluntary organisation.

 CSR activists organised a march 10 km away in Sarnath, too, where village women had come for a session on empowerment.

 The actors comment came in the middle of a campaign against female foeticide in Uttar Pradesh, where the number of women per 1,000 males stands at 898-900. Its worse between 865 and 870 in the western districts such as Meerut, Muzaffarnagar and Bulandshahr.

 I hope Bachchan is aware of the situation, said an angry social activist engaged in mobilising public opinion on the states missing women.

 Bachchan is being criticised in Lucknow, too. Former vice-chancellor of Lucknow University Dr Rooprekha Verma, who runs an NGO called Sanjhi Duniya, has demanded an apology.

 I would not have bothered had he been just another member of the glamour world, Verma said. But he has associated himself with a political party. He should explain his stand on the girl child.

 Samajwadi Party leaders said a personal, light-hearted comment was being dragged into the vortex of social activism.

 He probably did not mean to hurt the sentiments of women, said Samajwadi Party state secretary Ramsaran Das.

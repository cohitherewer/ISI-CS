 Court clears air on eviction

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 21: The Supreme Court has ruled that a person who lets out a premises is entitled to seek eviction even if he does not own the property.

 A bench of Justices Arijit Pasayat and Tarun Chatterjee said courts cannot refuse to entertain an eviction petition merely on the ground that the petitioner did not have any right or title to the property.

 ....The court needs to decide whether relationship of landlord and tenant exists and not the question of title to the properties in question, which may be incidentally gone into, but cannot be decided finally in the eviction proceeding, it pointed out. 

 The apex court further noted that a tenant could not deny his landlord title till he restored the possession of the premises. It clarified that if a landlord-tenant relationship was established or admitted, an eviction petition was maintainable.

 The order was passed while upholding the right of a widow Pydamma of Andhra Pradesh to seek eviction of tenants from a premises owned by her late husband Suryanarayana despite the fact that she was not entitled to inherit his property as their marriage was void on account of bigamy. Pydamma had married Suryanarayana while his first wife was still alive. 

 Although Pydamma was not entitled to inherit Suryanarayanas property, she could maintain an application for eviction of a premises let out by her, the court said, while dismissing an appeal by her tenants who had challenged an Andhra Pradesh High Court order.

 A district court had held that Pydamma was not entitled to evict the tenants because she was not the legally wedded wife of Suryanarayana and therefore, did not have any right, title or interest in his properties.

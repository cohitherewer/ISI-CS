 Jammu, Oct. 14: An unusual display of woman power today forced militants to set free two of four village defence committee members they abducted from Doda.

 Muslim women of the twin villages of Dauthan and Tender, about 170 km from Jammu, threw a human chain around the militants as they were planning to take off, with the four able-bodied men in tow.

 They pleaded with the militants, armed with AK-47s and Chinese grenades, to release at least the two Hindu men they had kidnapped. But when the militants began flexing their muscles, the women offered to be shot first.

 Village defence committee members are on the hit list because they are seen as the first line of opposition to militants. More Hindus than Muslims are at the receiving end of militants bullets.

 This is the first time that women have shown such courage against militants, to the point of risking their own lives to save the men folk.

 Doda senior superintendent of police Manohar Singh said the four men initially abducted were Ram Lal, Shadi Lal, Ghulam Mohammad and Ghulam Hassan. But the first two were released under pressure from the women.

 The police have launched a search for the missing members and the militants. We are at it and will be able to reach them, Singh said.

 Hindus constitute 40 per cent of the 5.5 lakh population of Doda and are more vulnerable to attacks from militants than Muslims. 

 Kashmir attacks

 A suspected militant was killed and at least five people injured in two separate attacks on Saturday in Kashmir, add agencies.

 The rebel was killed in a gunbattle in the village of Senzan, about 35 km south of Srinagar, said Imtiaz Hussain, police superintendent.

 Separately, militants ambushed an army patrol team in Nadihal, a village north of Srinagar, wounding five people including two soldiers, an army spokesperson said. The militants fled after the attack.

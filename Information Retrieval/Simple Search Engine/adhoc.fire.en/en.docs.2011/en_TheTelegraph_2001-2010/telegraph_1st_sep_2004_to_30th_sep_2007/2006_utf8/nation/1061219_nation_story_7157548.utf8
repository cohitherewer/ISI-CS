 WHAT NEXT

 Lalu Prasad is accused in six fodder scam cases of which charges have been framed in five

 Patna, Dec. 18: The assets case clean chit can only be a temporary respite for Lalu Prasad, who is chargesheeted in six of the 60 fodder scam cases.

 The trial has reached an advanced stage in one of the six, RC-20A/96, which deals with the scams conspiracy aspect and is pending in a Jharkhand court.

 CBI sources said trials had begun in two other fodder cases against the railway minister RC-64A/96 and RC-38 A/96 in Jharkhand courts.

 The fodder case charge-sheets accuse the Rashtriya Janata Dal chief of conspiring with the officials concerned to draw money from state treasuries over and above that sanctioned to the animal husbandry department in undivided Bihar.

 The amount mentioned is Rs 950 crore.

 The drawals came against signatures of officials in the department and the various treasuries, most of which are now in Jharkhand. This was done, the CBI says, at the behest of Lalu Prasad, who was the chief minister and also the finance minister from 1990 to 1997.

 The auditor-generals report later alleged illegality in the heavy drawals, which the CBI has cited as evidence.

 Five of the fodder cases are pending in Jharkhand courts and only one in Bihar. In the Bihar case, the railway minister has filed a discharge petition.

 The RJD chiefs political opponents, some of whom are petitioners in the fodder cases, are gunning for him.

 One of them, Bihar deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi, said after the days assets case acquittal: Lalu Prasad is still guilty in the eyes of the people and in our eyes. I am sure the court will one day convict him in the fodder cases.

 State Janata Dal (United) chief Lallan Singh echoed him, saying: We will keep on deposing in the court. There is no question of accepting that Lalu is not a culprit in the mega scam just on the basis of a courts order in a particular (assets) case.

 Both Modi and Lallan had lodged fodder cases against the RJD chief.

 The CBI is hopeful that Lalu Prasad would be found guilty. An agency official said: The courts have handed out convictions in all the three fodder cases in which they have delivered judgments so far.

 Lalu Prasads opponents have used the fodder scam as their main weapon against him in all Bihar elections since 1998. It is still the main issue, Modi said.

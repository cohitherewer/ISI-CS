 Manipur top cop killed in ambush

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Imphal, Dec. 31: Manipurs 

 inspector-general of police in charge of intelligence was 

 killed in an ambush by the Peoples Liberation Army 

 in the states Bishenpur district around 9 am today.

 T. Thanthuam and havildar Kharsiam were killed on the spot while four policemen escorting the senior official were wounded in the meticulously planned ambush. The injured have been admitted to the Regional Institute of Medical Sciences here. Two of them, Awat Bihari and Ginmang Paite, are said to be in a serious condition.

 Thanthuams son Paokhanmung and daughter-in-law Muanpui, who were travelling in the same vehicle, had a miraculous escape. 

 Thanthuam was returning to the state capital from his home district Churachandpur, when the militants hiding inside a parked truck opened fire on the three-vehicle convoy at Oinam Bazar, 20 km from here. 

 Police sources said the militants attacked the convoy with bombs and automatic weapons. The pilot vehicle and the officers car rammed into two houses on the roadside after being hit.

 When we were passing Oinam Bazar, we saw a truck parked by the wayside with its rain-cover hood down at its rear end. As we were passing the truck, gunmen who were inside the vehicle suddenly removed the cover and fired at us. It occurred so suddenly that we did not know what happened, the IGs driver, David Paite, said. 

 Late in the evening, the Peoples Liberation Army, the military wing of the Revolutionary Peoples Front, claimed responsibility for the ambush.

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh expressed shock at the incident and conveyed his condolences to the IGPs family. Chief minister Okram Ibobi Singh, who went to the RIMS mortuary with his ministers, wept uncontrollably on seeing the body of the slain police official. 

 Curfew was clamped in Churachandpur district tonight following violence and arson, adds PTI.

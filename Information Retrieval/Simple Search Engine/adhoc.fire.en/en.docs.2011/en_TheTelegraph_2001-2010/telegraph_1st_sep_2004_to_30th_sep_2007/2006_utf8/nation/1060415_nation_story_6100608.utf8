The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Bihar poll hero gives Mamata little joy

 Calcutta, April 14: The Election Commissions measures for the polls in Bengal are as good as one can expect them to be under Presidents rule. And, if the status quo of political equations is maintained, all these allegations of scientific rigging will be proved baseless.

 That, ironically, was from K.J. Rao, adviser to the EC until recently, on whom the Opposition parties in Bengal had once placed much of their hopes for the coming polls. 

 He didnt quite know what scientific rigging was all about. Speaking to The Telegraph today, Rao said he had seen fear among the people during his visit to Chhoto Angaria in East Midnapore and had been convinced ? on his trips to Nadia ? about Bangladeshi names on the voters lists. 

 Booth-jamming? He had seen that in other states, too. But some of the allegations are simply absurd. Like the one that the CPM cadre put some scent on the buttons of the electronic voting machines in order to keep count of votes polled by a party candidate. 

 If all this isnt music to Mamata Banerjees ears, Rao was also candid in his praise for the CPM on one thing. When the CPM made some complaints to him, the party did so with meticulous homework. So, their complaints always proved to be correct. 

 Trinamul Congress leaders, on the contrary, talked in the air. I said this to Mukul Roy (of Trinamul) and after that they changed a bit, Rao said.

 As if that wasnt enough, Rao rubbished another report that has come to be the Trinamuls trump card to showcase allegations about elections. 

 Afjal Amanullah, one of the EC observers for the 2004 Lok Sabha polls, had recommended that elections to all the 42 constituencies should have been countermanded because of the pro-Left politics of government employees who acted as presiding and polling officers. 

 Rao said he hadnt seen the report but came to know of it. If the EC acted on that recommendation, the affected party would have gone to court the next day. Countermanding the elections to even one constituency is the biggest step the EC can take. But it can never do so on the basis of generalised complaints. Lots of evidence on the ground have to be collected and established. 

 Then, there are state employees unions affiliated to political parties in every state and they perform their duty during elections, he added. 

 What about a case in which a CPM candidate wins an Assembly seat by a margin of more than one lakh votes? Rao was unfazed. I have known cases where candidates for Assembly polls have won by 1.5 lakh votes. 

 For the man who worked with the EC for 39 years and earned something of a cult status for cleaning up the elections in Bihar, there was, however, one secret he wasnt prepared to share with the media. Why did he leave the EC in the middle of his work as one of the observers in Bengal?

 Thats something Ill reveal in the book I plan to write. But I can say this much. I didnt quit because of any pressure from any political party or leader. Im not the kind of person who would surrender to any pressure. 

 He laughed aloud and added: There are two Bengalis who know. But they arent involved in any way in the Bengal elections.

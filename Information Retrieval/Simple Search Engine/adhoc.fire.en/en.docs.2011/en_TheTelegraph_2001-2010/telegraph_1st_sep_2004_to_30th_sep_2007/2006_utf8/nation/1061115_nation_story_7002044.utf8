 IT union out of sight, not mind

 Calcutta, Nov. 14: The talk was all about their rights, but the techies chose to remain glued to their workstations while Citu formally unveiled the West Bengal IT Services Association at a rally in tech town. 

 The nature of the industry is such that we cannot just leave office and attend a rally, said an IBM employee. 

 Citu state president Shyamal Chakraborty was addressing the rally barely 15 metres away from his office. But the 20-something techie slowly strolled into an ATM counter attached to the office, withdrew some cash and went inside the building, the world of business as usual. 

 Over 1,000 people turned out at the unveiling ceremony of the union and witnessed the launch of its website. Most of them were members of unions in government-run outfits in Salt Lake, contract workers engaged in support functions in the IT industry and auto-rickshaw drivers. 

 IT industry does not mean engineers and management people alone. There are around 50,000 people involved in various support functions and we want them to join us, Chakraborty said.

 Somnath Bhattacharya, secretary of the outfit, however, invited engineers even CEOs and entrepreneurs to support the fledgling outfit.

 Overt expression of support was missing but several employees voiced the need for an association. We know of the meeting, but we are in a wait-and-watch mode. There is no denying that employees in the IT sector need a forum that helps in addressing our grievances. But, we do not want to be identified and blacklisted, said an employee of a leading infotech company who dropped in for a while at the meeting.

 The fear psychosis got reflected at the Citu rally. The Citu leaders had promised to parade 10 employees of five companies who were sacked unlawfully by their employers. But the plan was shelved, as the employees did not want to be identified.

 The accusations listed against some companies in the industry were: arbitrary hire and fire, refusal to issue formal appointment letters, work schedule beyond the 48-hour weekly limit, night shifts for women without government approval and lack of security for women employees. 

 A small section, in-principle supporters of the association, remained scattered at dhabas, cafes and tea-stalls after work hours to discuss the pros and cons of unions. 

 The employers in the IT industry are opposed to unions as they think the companies are best suited to address employee concerns.

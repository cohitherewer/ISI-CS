The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Writers clears way for more cities 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, June 13: To build new cities across Bengal, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees government will offer freehold land to developers.

 Until recently, the government only offered land on lease to private developers. This land could not be sold to a third party and so the price they fetched was often not the best. 

 Now the government hopes to find more takers for land in the state to develop townships and build infrastructure. 

 We had been facing problems with leasehold land for a long time. There arent many takers for leasehold land in the first place. When we find someone, the deal doesnt fetch us a good price, urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya said today. 

 Land and land reforms minister Abdur Rezzak Mollah and the urban development minister discussed the acquisition of around 6,000 acres over the next six months for a string of projects to urbanise vast swathes of the state.

 These include acquiring around 5,000 acres for a proposed township in Dankuni, 350 acres for a township at Baruipur, 150 acres for the seat of the South 24-Parganas district headquarters in Baruipur and another 325 acres off EM Bypass.

 The cabinet has cleared the proposal to grant freehold land to the various development authorities of the government and an order to this effect was passed early this month.

 Last year, the government had given around 300 acres to the Salim Group for the West Howrah township at a throwaway price as the land was leased for 999 years. 

 However, while acquiring freehold land, investors will have to seek a clearance from the land and land reforms department to make sure that provisions of the land ceiling act do not apply there.

 Also, before acquisition, the body will have to give in writing the purpose for which it is acquiring the land. Once the purpose is stated, there cannot be any change, Mollah said.

 In addition to the 6,000 acres for the various urban development projects, the government will also acquire another 40,000 acres for industries within the next six months. 

 The urban development department also needs land for other projects, some in Garden Reach in Calcutta and at Mekhligunj in Cooch Behar to build water treatment plants and solid waste management facilities at Jhalda in Purulia and Mal in Jalpaiguri. 

 Mollah, the land and land reforms minister, said: The urban development department has said it has around 325 acres off EM Bypass. Well conduct a joint survey to see how much land there is and whether it is vested with the government.

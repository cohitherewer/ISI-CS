 60 queries to Ash, all because of Mister A

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Aishwarya Rai

 Mumbai, Nov. 20: As a wannabe Miss World, Aishwarya Rai had to answer one question in the final round before the crown was placed on her head.

 Today, she had to scribble down answers to no less than 60 questions before emerging with an as-of-now clean chit. 

 Blame it all on another A an Avineshwar who thoughtfully tossed in a wad of euros equivalent to nearly Rs 14 lakh in a parcel addressed to the actresss old home.

 Mumbai customs today questioned Aishwarya for over two hours on the parcel containing 23,000 euros (Rs 13.88 lakh).

 Aishwarya, who arrived from the shooting of Ashutosh Gowarikers Jodha-Akbar in Jaipur, was quizzed at the Mumbai airport, away from the glare of a media contingent that cooled its heels outside the customs office in south Mumbai. Later, she was allowed to fly back to the location.

 The customs commissioner (import), A. K. Prasad, told PTI that Aishwarya accompanied by her mother and lawyer was tense initially but calmed down later to answer the set of 60 questions in writing. On November 15, Krishnaraj Rai, Aishwaryas father, had met officials to explain her position.

 She has said that she neither had a professional nor a personal association with the sender. Her explanation was satisfactory. We have started tracing the sender in Rotterdam, Prasad said, adding she will be called for questioning again if needed.

 In her statement, Aishwarya said she had no dues to recover from the man, identified as Avineshwar. He is a Dutch national of Indian origin and appeared to be in his 30s, Prasad said.

 We are unnecessarily being made a party to it. We dont know if the man exists at all, Aishwaryas lawyer Girish Kulkarni said. 

 The 16.5-kg parcel containing a T-shirt, a pair of binoculars, two cellphones, the cash and a copy of Avineshwars purported passport arrived at the foreign post office here in September but was opened last month before witnesses. While the other items were declared, the money wasnt.

 Sending over Rs 5,000, or equivalent of it in foreign currency, through post without declaration is illegal.

 Asked whether Avineshwar was associated with an awards event in the Netherlands in 2005, Prasad declined to comment. However, he said Aishwarya had told officials that she had performed at the show, though she does not remember meeting this man.

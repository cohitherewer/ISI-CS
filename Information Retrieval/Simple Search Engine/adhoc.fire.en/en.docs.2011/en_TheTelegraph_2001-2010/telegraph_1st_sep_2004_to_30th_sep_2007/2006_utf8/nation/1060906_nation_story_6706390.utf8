 CM birds 

 Shimla, Sept. 5: The Himachal Pradesh wildlife department has issued a showcause notice to Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh for possessing about four dozen exotic birds, reports our correspondent.

 A team raided his ancestral farmhouse at Chail, 60 km from here, on Sunday and found the birds. The department said Singh had been asked to produce in 15 days the permit for importing and breeding the birds, including golden pheasants. 

 It appears the birds were being bred in captivity, Sanjeev Sood, range officer of wildlife wing, said.

 Airport upgrade teeth for govt

 SINGH GYANANT KUMAR

 New Delhi, Feb. 20: The Supreme Court today upheld the authority of the government to involve private players in the modernisation of airports without parliamentary sanction.

 Dismissing an appeal by the International Airports Authority of India Officers Association challenging a Delhi High Court order of 2005, the apex bench observed that the government could exercise discretion in policy matters.

 The association had contended that under the Airports Authority of India Act 1994, the management of airports, civil enclaves, air traffic services and other related jobs were vested with the Airports Authority of India (AAI) and it could not be taken away without legislative clearance.

 Senior counsel R.K. Jain, appearing for the association, submitted that although a provision in the act allowed the AAI to go for joint ventures in discharging its functions, it envisaged new airports and not existing ones.

 The petition challenged the validity of Section 12(3)(r) ? which provides for joint ventures ? saying it was not in consonance with other provisions and the spirit of the act. But it failed to convince the court.

 The apex bench noted that various provisions in the 1994 act had to be construed harmoniously before coming to any conclusion.

 The court dismissed a PIL by advocate A.K. Chaudhary, who wanted the award of contract for the modernisation of Delhi and Mumbai airports to be set aside.

 A fine of Rs 10,000 was imposed on the advocate for merely relying on media reports to file his petition and abusing the process of law.

 Besides, the court said, one of the parties that lost the contract for the two airports, had already challenged the bidding process and Chaudhary had no business to file a PIL.

 The Reliance Airports Developers petition is pending before Delhi High Court.

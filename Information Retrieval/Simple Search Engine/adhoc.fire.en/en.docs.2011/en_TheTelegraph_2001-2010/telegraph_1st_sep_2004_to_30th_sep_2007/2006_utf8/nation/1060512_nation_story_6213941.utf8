 Rahul reaps laddoos of labour

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 11: On May 6, when Priyanka Vadra, who was Sonia Gandhis election agent in Rae Bareli, landed in the town, one of those she called on was a veteran Congressman, Anjani Vajpayee, in Khorgaon village. 

 Recounting the experience, his son Deepak said his sister Sonia brought a glass of lassi for Priyanka. She refused, saying she didnt care for the drink. My sister said but, didi, I read in the papers the other day that you love lassi.

 Priyanka laughed and answered: Not me. Your jeejaji (brother-in-law) loves lassi. A cold drink would do for me. 

 It was the suggestion of familial closeness, contained in her reference to husband Robert Vadra as the jeejaji, that endeared Priyanka not just to the Vajpayees but the people of Khorgaon. Every door in the village was open for her to step in, gushed Deepak.

 While Priyanka won hearts in her mothers constituency through gestures such as these, people felt Sonias election manager and son Rahul maintained a certain reserve and distance. 

 We could sense the discomfort in him every time somebody touched his feet or garlanded him, Rajesh Chowdhury, a Congress worker of Sehenjo village, said.

 But today, Rahul was a transformed person. A Congress functionary of Rae Bareli called this correspondent and excitedly said that on hearing Sonia had won by over four lakh votes from an election official, Rahul had asked a worker to get lots of laddoos and distribute them. He forgot he was seated in the district magistrates office and not the Congresss.

 Not just that, he wanted pictures to be clicked. There was an agency photographer and Rahul egged him on, the functionary said.

 He even played Holi with gulal and other dry colours with the people. 

 The baptism through the heat and dust of eastern Uttar Pradesh over, Sonia announced that Rahul would get an organisational responsibility. He will be in politics for many years. He will face many tests, Priyanka told journalists in Rae Bareli.

 With the Congress determined to focus on Uttar Pradesh and give itself a leg-up before the Assembly polls, sources said whatever Rahuls formal designation, his work area would be the state. Last week, Rahul told reporters he wouldnt speak on Uttar Pradesh because he was only familiar with Amethi and Rae Bareli.

 Congress sources said it would be a long haul for Rahul because in Amethi and Rae Bareli he was used to working with his crack team of family loyalists and local workers. He had evolved a style of functioning that combined the earnestness of an NGO activist with the efficiency of a corporate manager. It worked in these places because the aura of the Gandhi family overcomes caste and religious divisions, said a source.

 Sign of rift in Hurriyat

 New Delhi, May 26: The moderate Hurriyat and other separatist groups, which have twice spurned Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs invitation to join the roundtable conference, might find themselves out in the cold when the next phase of the talks is held.

 Official sources said the Centre is considering not to invite the Hurriyat and some other separatist leaders for the next roundtable and to accommodate them only if they show their willingness and firm commitment to join the democratic dialogue process.

 After sending signals through various unofficial channels about joining the roundtable conference this week, the moderate Hurriyat had backed out at the eleventh hour, causing embarrassment to the Prime Minister and the Jammu and Kashmir government.

 However, sources said the Hurriyats decision to stay away from the roundtable was not unanimous. Fearing that its absence from the talks could cause political damage in the long run, at least two members of the executive committee were keen to join the conference but could not because of the majority decision against them, said a senior home ministry official.

 Some Kashmir observers within the government also see this as signal of a split within the moderate Hurriyat. The All-Parties Hurriyat Conference had earlier broken up into the hardline faction led by Syed Ali Shah Geelani and the moderate faction led by Mirwaiz Omar Farooq.

 If a further break-up takes place in the Hurriyat ranks and gives birth to another faction ? a more moderate one, it will definitely demoralise Pakistans game plan to dictate terms in Kashmir affairs, said a source.

 Working groups

 The Centre has advised the Jammu and Kashmir government to immediately constitute five working groups in an effort to establish a mechanism to carry the roundtable dialogue forward.

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had suggested creation of the working groups to look into issues and problems faced by Jammu and Kashmir.

 To give these groups a wider representation, the convenors and members will be from the mainstream parties of Jammu and Kashmir, said a senior home ministry official.

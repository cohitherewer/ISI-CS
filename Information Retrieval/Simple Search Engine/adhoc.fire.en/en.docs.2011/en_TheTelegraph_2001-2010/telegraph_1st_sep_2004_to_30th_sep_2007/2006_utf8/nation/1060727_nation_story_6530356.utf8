 Calcutta kids freed in south

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chennai, July 26: At least 

 25 children from in and around Calcutta were rescued by 

 Tamil Nadu police at Cuddalore station this afternoon.

 The children, mostly boys, were part of a group of 165 people travelling by Cholan Express from suburban Tambaram to Mailaduthurai. They had been recruited by a private company on contract to work at an ONGC drilling site, police sources said. 

 A curious case of misinformation led to the tracing of the 25 who might be under 14 and whose deployment would amount to forced child labour, the Cuddalore district superintendent, Sanjay Kumar, said over phone. 

 An activist of a child welfare organisation had alerted the Cuddalore superintendent in the afternoon that a group of young people from Calcutta travelling by Cholan Express today were possibly being taken to be sold as bonded labourers in Tamil Nadu. 

 Kumar said he rushed to Cuddalore station with a police party around 1.10 pm when the train was to arrive. The entire group of 165 was detained at the station, after which we began the investigations. 

 The police got the help of a Bengali-speaking woman who could talk to the detainees, he said. It turned out that barring the 25 who may be below 14 years of age and whose deployment would be illegal, the rest were all contract workers employed by the East Coast Engineering Company, Kumar said. 

 The 25 have been held back in Cuddalore and sent for medical examination. If it is found that they are under 14, then we will take steps tomorrow to send them back to Calcutta as a group.

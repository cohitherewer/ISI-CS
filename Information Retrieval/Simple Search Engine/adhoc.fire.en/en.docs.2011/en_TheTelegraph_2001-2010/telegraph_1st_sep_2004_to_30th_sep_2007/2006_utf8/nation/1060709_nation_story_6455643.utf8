 Teen rape fury singes cops

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai/Nashik, July 8: Hundreds of furious residents clashed with Nashik police this morning in protest against their failure to make any arrests in the suspected rape and murder of a 14-year-old schoolgirl.

 A 2,000-strong mob gheraoed the Deolali Camp police station, prompting a baton charge. Twelve policemen were injured in the clash.

 Priyanka Lakariya, a Class IX student of St Patrick High School, used to travel from Bhagur to Deolali every evening in a share auto-rickshaw to attend a coaching class. She returned home by the same auto.

 On July 4, she left home around 6.30 pm but did not return. Her friends told her parents they had seen her get into an auto-rickshaw around 8.30. 

 The Lakariyas then lodged a missing complaint and also petitioned Nashik police commissioner Himanshu Roy.

 Last evening, around 8.30, cattle-grazers spotted a body in a semi-naked state in a jungle where the Deolali army base has its firing range. The Lakariyas rushed to the spot and identified the girl. Despite being informed, the police did not arrive till 11.30.

 As the news spread, angry residents from Deolali and Bhagur, among them local political activists, began gathering around the Deolali Camp police station this morning. They demanded that inspector Prakash Sindane be handed over to them.

 The crowd also apparently pelted with stones the car of commissioner Roy, who rushed to the police station. Roy escaped unhurt.

 Later, after a meeting, Roy ordered transfer of the inspector, and directed the crime branch to conduct the probe. The crime branch detained two suspects this evening.

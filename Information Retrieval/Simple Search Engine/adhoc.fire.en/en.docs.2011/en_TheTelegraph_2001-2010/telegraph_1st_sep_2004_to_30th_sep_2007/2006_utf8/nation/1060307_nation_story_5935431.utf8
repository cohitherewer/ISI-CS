 March 24 date for breakaway BSP case

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 6: The Supreme Court will hear on March 24 pleas seeking to stay the Allahabad High Court judgment regarding the merger of a breakaway BSP group with the Samajwadi Party.

 The high court had directed the Uttar Pradesh Assembly Speaker to review the validity of the merger.

 A bench of Justices K.G. Balakrishnan and P.P. Naolekar fixed the date after hearing preliminary arguments on behalf of some of the MLAs.

 In four petitions before the apex court, 29 of the 40 MLAs who had left the BSP, have challenged the high court judgment setting aside the Speakers verdict recognising their split and merger with the Samajwadi Party.

 They have sought a stay on the order on the ground that the two judges who had given the majority opinion for a fresh decision by the Speaker had written separate judgments expressing divergent views on some key legal issues.

 The judgments were likely to create political confusion and there would be attempts to destabilise the state government with the Congress and the BSP using the governors office for the purpose, they said.

 On February 28, a three-judge bench of the high court by a 2-1 majority declared the Speakers decision as honest in the eyes of law and sent back the matter with a direction to decide it afresh in the light of observations made by the court.

 The court asked the Speaker to first decide applications seeking disqualification of 13 BSP MLAs before adjudicating on the validity of the split and merger of 40 BSP MLAs. 

 The BSP had sought disqualification of the 13 MLAs even before some more left the party and jointly sought recognition of their split and subsequent merger. Noting that the 13 MLAs were included in the 40 MLAs that quit the BSP, the court felt that the issue of disqualification had to be decided first as it could have an effect on the validity of the split.

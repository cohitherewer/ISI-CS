 Minister house blown up

 Ranchi, April 20: Armed Naxalites blew up the ancestral house of Jharkhand water resources minister Kamlesh Singh at Kamtarpur village in the Hussainabad area of Palamau district tonight.

 Singh was in Ranchi when around 200 Naxalites surrounded the house at 9.30 pm, asked the inmates to come out and hand over their belongings. 

 The rebels then put dynamites in the house and blew it up. 

 Singh said his eldest brother and his family members were staying at the house but all of them are safe. 

 He said he had asked police not to go to the incident site at night as the area could have been mined by the rebels. I dont want another incident to happen, he said.

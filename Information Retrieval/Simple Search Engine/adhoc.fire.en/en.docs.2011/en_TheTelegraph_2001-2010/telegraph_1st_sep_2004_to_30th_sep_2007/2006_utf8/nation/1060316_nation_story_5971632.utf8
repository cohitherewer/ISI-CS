The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Partial view of solar eclipse

 Mumbai, March 15 (PTI): Certain parts of India, including Calcutta, will get a partial glimpse of the total solar eclipse on March 29, according to the Nehru Planetarium in Mumbai.

 The moons umbra touches earth in Brazil and runs across the Atlantic, northern Africa and central Asia where it ends at sunset in western Mongolia. A partial eclipse will be seen within the much broader path of the moons penumbra, which includes northern Africa, Europe and central Asia, a statement from the planetarium said.

 While parts of India, including New Delhi, will get an opportunity to witness the event, Mumbai will miss it.

 Calcutta will have a grazing partial eclipse where only 7 per cent of the diameter of the sun would be covered during the maximum phase and the eclipse would end 15 minutes before sunset, the release said.

 New Delhi, Dec. 23: Two years after his death and near-effacement from the Congresss pantheon of eminence, P.V. Narasimha Raos political and policy legacy has been finally given a stamp of approval by Sonia Gandhi.

 Sonias statement on Raos death anniversary was replete with nostalgia, respect and a tinge of affection. 

 For the first time, she remembered him as Rao garu, which translates approximately as Rao Sir. 

 The signed statement said: Today, we recall the memory of one of the most scholarly, erudite and distinguished political leaders of the post-Independence era. Shri P.V. Narasimha Rao garu left an indelible imprint in whichever post he adorned MLA, minister, chief minister and finally Prime Minister.

 After Rao was dethroned as the Congress president by Sitaram Kesri and excluded from the Congress Working Committee in 1998 after Sonia took over, he became persona non grata in the party to such an extent that even leaders appreciative of economic reforms credited Manmohan Singh for the initiative but never Rao under whose leadership it happened.

 Sonia finally acknowledged his legacy: His contributions to giving a new direction and momentum to our economic growth are both profound and enduring. He was a stalwart Congressman for over half a century.

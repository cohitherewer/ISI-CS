 Ex-navy chief granted relief

 New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Wednesday 

 stayed contempt proceedings and the arrest warrant against 

 former navy chief Admiral (retired) R.H. Tahiliani issued 

 by a Jammu and Kashmir court in a defamation case.

 The court also stayed proceedings against Bhaskar Rao, director of the Centre for Media Studies, which had come out with a report along with Transparency International, the NGO headed by Tahiliani. The report, Corruption Study 2005, had branded the judiciary the second-most corrupt department.

 The judicial magistrate, Class I, Kangan, had directed the admiral to personally appear before him.

 Tahilianis counsel Prashant Bhushan said the orders were totally arbitrary and invalid and directly impinged on Tahilianis liberty. The petition said no subordinate court has the power or jurisdiction to initiate contempt proceedings.

 DDA fined for 27-year wait

 New Delhi (PTI): The Delhi Development 

 Authority (DDA) will have to pay a compensation of Rs 1 

 lakh to a man who was not allotted a flat even after he 

 registered with the body 27 years ago.

 Awarding the compensation, the state consumer disputes redressal commission also directed the authority to include complainant M.S. Tewari in its future draws.

 Terming the compensation awarded by a district consumer forum as adequate, the commission upheld a district forum order and asked the authority to return the registration amount of Rs 4,500 lying with it since 1979.

 VP sons complex

 has allowed Ajey Singh, son of former Prime Minister V.P. 

 Singh, to move an application before the district magistrate

 by Samajwadi Party activists last month. 

 Car gang busted

 busted a gang involved in stealing expensive cars from different 

 places, including Mumbai, and arrested three men. Seven

 Singh: Message to Left

 New Delhi, June 17: The Prime Minister is likely to skip the United Nations General Assembly meeting in New York to attend the Non-Aligned Movement summit in Cuba in September.

 The decision is a signal to the domestic audience, especially the Left, that India follows a sovereign foreign policy and hasnt tilted completely towards Washington.

 The UN meeting begins on September 12 while the five-day NAM summit starts in Havana on September 11. 

 Cuba will take over the movements leadership from Malaysia for the next three years.

 On his way to Havana, Manmohan Singh will stop over in Brasilia to attend a meeting of the IBSA, a pressure group of India, Brazil and South Africa formed in June 2003. The grouping hopes to get the UN to reform the Security Council, creating permanent seats for developing nations.

 Although the Prime Ministers Office would not officially reveal his travel plans, its learnt that Singh has already decided that Havana and Brasilia have higher priority. Defence minister Pranab Mukherjee may fill in for Singh at New York.

 Ever since the Indo-US nuclear pact last July, the Left and Samajwadi Party have been accusing the Prime Minister of tilting far too much towards Washington. Their protests grew louder when Delhi voted against Iran on the nuclear controversy, and President George Bush visited India.

 The Left criticised the government for acting against a fellow NAM member and accused the Congress of departing from Jawaharlal Nehrus policies.

 Official sources said Singhs presence in Havana was meant to correct such impressions. They said that from now on, his speeches and interventions on foreign policy would reflect the tenor of his April 24 address at the Bandung Asia-Africa Conference in Indonesia.

 The Prime Minister had underlined that non-alignment remained a valid and effective instrument to ensure the creation of a more just and fair global order.

 The Congress, in its Hyderabad plenary last January, stressed the importance of NAM but said its strategy should be reworked to suit the present global situation, and that India should take the lead in the matter.

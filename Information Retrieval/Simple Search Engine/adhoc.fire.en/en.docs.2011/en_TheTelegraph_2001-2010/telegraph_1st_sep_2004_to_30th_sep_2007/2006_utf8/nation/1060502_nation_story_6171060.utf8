 Passport revoked in navy case

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 1: The ministry of external affairs today revoked the passport of former navy officer Ravi Shankaran, a suspect in the war room leak case, to facilitate his deportation from London.

 Shankaran, a close relative of navy chief Admiral Arun Prakash, is believed to be in London.

 CBI sources said the Interpol headquarters in France is likely to issue a red-corner notice against Shankaran so that he cannot flee to any other country.

 The CBI requested the Centre to revoke Shankarans passport after it failed to get any response from him despite sending several notices to his office and residence in Mumbai seeking his appearance for questioning in the case.

 The CBI hopes to plug several loose ends in the case by questioning Shankaran.

 Former naval commander Kulbushan Parashar, an accused in the same case, had earlier told CBI sleuths during interrogation that he had met Shankaran in London.

 The CBI had earlier raided Shankarans office in Mumbai ? Shanks Oceangraphic Private Limited and the office of one Jeniffer Mirza, alleged to be heading Shankarans front organisation in Goa ? and had recovered certain documents alleged to be linked to the leak.

 The agency had registered a case on March 20 against nine persons, including Shankaran, under various sections of the Official Secrets Act and Section 120-b (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code.

 Of these, five are former navy officials and two are former air force officials.

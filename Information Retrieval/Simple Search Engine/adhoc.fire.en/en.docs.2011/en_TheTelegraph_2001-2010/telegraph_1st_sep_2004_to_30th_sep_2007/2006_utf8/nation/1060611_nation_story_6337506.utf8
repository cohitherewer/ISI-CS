 IIMs voice reservation fears before govt panel

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Bangalore, June 10: Representatives of all six Indian Institutes of Management yesterday met the government sub-committee that is looking into admission to IIMs to hammer out a consensus on the proposed quota for Other Backward Classes in higher education.

 The IIMs gave their views on how to implement the proposed 27 per cent quota without harming the intake of merit students. They said increasing the number of seats would mean compromising with the quality of the institutions.

 Another point they made was that IIMs are facing a 25 per cent shortage of teaching staff. A seat increase would widen the gap. It is not easy to find good people to teach, given the constraints of an IIM salary. Also, the institutions do not have enough resources to build new facilities like classrooms and hostels, a source said.

 A senior professor said IIM faculty members were not happy with the governments decision to tinker with the existing system of selection. We are contemplating writing to the President like the IIT Kanpur faculty did.

 The IIM sub-committee, headed by Samuel Paul, is one of the five panels that will report to the oversight committee chaired by veteran Congress leader Veerappa Moily. The others are looking into admissions to IITs, agricultural institutes, central universities and medical institutes.

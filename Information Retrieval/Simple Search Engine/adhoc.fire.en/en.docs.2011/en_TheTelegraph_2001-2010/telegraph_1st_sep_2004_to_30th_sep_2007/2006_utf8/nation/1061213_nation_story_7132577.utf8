 Nuked: Bid for axis of BJP amp; Left

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 12: The BJP and the Left are not going to join forces, like they did during the monsoon session, against the Indo-US nuclear deal.

 Attacking external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjees statement on the deal today, BJP deputy leader in the Lok Sabha V.K. Malhotra stressed that India should reject the new legislation.

 The BJPs aim is to get the House to vote on the deal. The party has given a notice under rule 184 in the Lok Sabha, which involves a division of votes. Though the governments cooperation is a prerequisite for allowing a debate, the BJPs strategy is clear not only does it want a dissenting note, it also wants to expose the Left.

 They (the Left) betrayed us last time. We are going to follow our own strategy this time, Malhotra said.

 He was referring to the Lefts decision to chart its own course after having exhausted the BJPs efforts to cobble together a majority opinion for a sense of the House resolution on the nuke deal during the monsoon session.

 Yashwant Sinha led the BJPs efforts to strike a chord with the Left. But others in the BJP felt the Left had helped the Prime Minister in assuring the House over the nuclear deal. Eventually, no sense of the House resolution was adopted and it was the Prime Minister who emerged with the upper hand.

 That is why the BJP is making sure that theres no repeat of what is now being perceived as a mistake to rally with the Left.

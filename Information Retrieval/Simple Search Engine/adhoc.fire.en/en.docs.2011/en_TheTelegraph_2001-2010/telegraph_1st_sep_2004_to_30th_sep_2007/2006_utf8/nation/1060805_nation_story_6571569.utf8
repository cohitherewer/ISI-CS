 Blue Line pullout blips on radar

 Maj. Gen. Malhan with soldiers leaving for Ethiopia-Eritrea

 New Delhi, Aug. 4: India is likely to consider pulling out its troops on duty with the United Nations on the Blue Line between Lebanon and Israel because of a serious threat to the soldiers who are in the middle of the war zone. 

 Defence sources said here today that they were close to the tipping point beyond which a withdrawal from duties with the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (Unifil) would become inevitable.

 The moment we feel that the threat to the lives of our soldiers outweigh the prestige attached with UN missions and our international commitment, we will ask them to fall back or pull out, a source said.

 India rarely withdraws from UN duties the exception in recent times has been the pullout from the UN Mission in Sierra Leone (Unamsil) where Indian soldiers were taken hostage and rescued after a daring operation by the 18 Grenadiers about four years back.

 There are always contingency plans in place, Major General R.P.S. Malhan said here today while seeing off another battalion group of infantry soldiers for duties with the United Nations Mission in Ethiopia-Eritrea another hot zone where the peacekeepers are severely cramped by restrictions.

 We are monitoring the situation (in Lebanon) and are taking a very close look. A withdrawal will be considered if required, he said. 

 There are 673 troops from the 4 Sikh battalion group in the northeast sector of the Blue Line that is now the scene of major incursions by Israel. The troops have been short on supplies and convoys are making way to their positions tardily. They are practically confined to bomb shelters.

 Earlier this week, the Security Council extended the mandate for Unifil that has about 1,900 troops by a month till the end of August but the forces responsibility has been made largely irrelevant because there is no peace to keep since the war began on July 12. 

 The extension of the mandate for the UN force that is neither authorised nor capable of stopping the war allows Israel time to continue with its offensive and the world community to consider putting an international stabilisation force suggested by UN secretary-general Kofi Annan in its place. 

 The threat to soldiers from India and Ghana with Unifil is from both Israel and the Hizbollah. Hizbollah guerrillas have fired Katyusha rockets from close to Unifil positions and this, in turn, has invited heavy Israeli air and artillery strikes. 

 About 180 Indian troops are also posted on the disputed Golan Heights between Israel and Syria.

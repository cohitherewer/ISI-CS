 Blast in Bhutan closes border

 OUR BUREAU 

 Phuentsholing (Bhutan)/ Guwahati, Dec. 2: The Bhutan border along Assam has been sealed after a crude bomb exploded this morning in Phuentsholing the point of entry into the Himalayan kingdom injuring four persons, including three Indians. 

 The blast occurred at 6.20 am around 300 km from Phuentsholings main gate.

 The condition of Dendrup, a Bhutanese watchman with the Bank of Bhutan, is reported to be critical. He is undergoing treatment at the local government hospital.

 The others injured Hira Basfore, Ramnath Basfore and Pramod Basfore were first moved to Hashimara air force hospital and then to Binnaguri army hospital in India.

 The Basfores, all residents of Subash Pally colony in Jaigaon, on the Indian side of the border, work as sweepers with Bhutans City Corporation in Phuentsholing, Jaigaons twin town on the other side of the border.

 Like every day, we crossed into Bhutan at 5 am, Ramnath said at the hospital. While cleaning the sides of the road (Phuentsholing-Thimphu), we came across a gunny bag. We did not check the contents of the gunny bag, thinking it contained garbage and flung it into the cart, which caused the explosion, he added.

 Dendrup was on his way home after a night shift at work. 

 They had splinters of the explosive device all over their bodies, R. Shankar Upadhyay, commanding officer of Hashimara Air Force Hospital, said.

 Namgay, the district magistrate of Chukha, and Inga Sangey, superintendent of police, arrived at the scene soon after the incident. We have initiated an inquiry, Namgay said.

 R. Ranjit, district magistrate of Jalpaiguri, and J.B. Dorjee, additional superintendent of police, Alipurduar, also reached the spot. We will extend all co-operation for their probe, Ranjit said.

 The Indo-Bhutan border has been sealed and additional personnel of the Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) have been deployed in the wake of the blast, Assam additional director-general of police B.P. Rao said.

 Asked if any insurgent outfit was behind the blast, Rao said preliminary reports point to the involvement of Ulfa.

 Bengal school truths

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 10: Bengal has the highest number of out-of-school children after Bihar, Jharkhand and Assam. It also has the highest number of scheduled tribe children out of school. Eleven per cent of Muslim children in the Left Front-ruled state do not go to school.

 A global monitoring report released by Unesco on Wednesday shows that the flaws marring Indias report on education persist particularly in the states which have been sluggish in their commitment to widen the access to education.

 High dropout rates and gender disparities continue despite a 93 per cent enrolment rate claimed by the government.

 Nigeria, Pakistan, India and Ethiopia (in descending order) are home to the largest number of school dropouts. Twenty-three million for the four countries, says the Unesco report. A recent survey of primary schools and pupils across India, for example, showed the average absentee rate to be 30 per cent on the days schools were visited.

 The southern states in India present a different picture. In the south, some states appear to have virtually achieved universal schooling for 6 to 13 year olds, says the report. The dropout rate varies not only across states but also within them.

 The focus of Unescos report is on early childhood care and education for those below 6 years they do not come under the fundamental right to education guaranteed for children in the 6-14 age group.

 The report says India is not using its creative talent in the Education for All (EFA) programme. One of the main conclusions was that Indias approach to EFA was lacking in vision and policy for non-formal education, Unesco points out.

 It raises questions about the 

 way the Sarva Siksha Abhiyan, a key EFA programme, is being 

 implemented. On paper, the enrolment is high but the quality 

 of education is under a cloud. A study conducted by Pratham 

 and a group of other NGOs has shown that a large percentage 

 of students across the country is not equipped with minimum 

 levels of learning.

 Glare on seat sale to rich

 New Delhi, May 16: Reserving seats for the backward classes is much less anti-merit than selling them to the children of the rich, many doctors say.

 They argue that quotas in medical colleges might help counter the widespread sale of medical seats in private colleges to candidates who could not make it through competitive entrance examinations.

 Top Indian Medical Association officials in Delhi have opposed caste quotas, arguing this would lower the quality of students and lead to a fall in healthcare standards.

 This is absolutely hypocritical, said Dr Chittakudam Soman, former professor of nutrition at Trivandrum Medical College and now chairman of the Health Action by People, an NGO.

 Hundreds of students get into private medical colleges not through their performance in entrance examinations but thanks to their parents ability to pay for their seats, Soman said.

 Although capitation fees do not exist, everyone knows seats are sold today, said Dr Kunchala Shyamprasad, vice-president of the National Board of Examinations, which conducts postgraduate examinations for doctors.

 Many private medical colleges have a quota of payment seats that are filled not on the basis of candidates ranks in government-run entrance tests, but through tests conducted by individual colleges or groups of private colleges.

 Candidates whove paid for their seats expect to be passed. Pressure builds up to ease the examination system so that they graduate, said Dr Karumathil Aravindan of Calicut Medical College.

 Kerala and Tamil Nadu have had up to 50 per cent reservations for backward classes in medical colleges. Yet both states today have among the best healthcare systems in the country, Soman said.

 Reservations might at least help us get candidates who wont be repelled by the idea of rural practice. Most of them (backward class students Soman has taught) have continued to stay in Kerala. Theyre the ones whove transformed the states health landscape.

 Medicine needs people who have empathy, a willingness to make sacrifices, said Dr Vellappillil Ramankutty, a paediatrician and vice-chairman of the Health Action by People. Candidates who buy seats are unlikely to have such personality traits.

 A senior IMA official in New Delhi said the association has opposed the sale of medical seats.

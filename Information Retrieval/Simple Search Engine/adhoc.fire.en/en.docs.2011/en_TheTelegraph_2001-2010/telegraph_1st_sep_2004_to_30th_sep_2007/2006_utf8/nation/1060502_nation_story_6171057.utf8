May 1: The police firing on an angry mob protesting the razing of a Vadodara dargah today drew fire from the minorities commission which slammed the excessive use of force and lack of tact in handling the issue.

 The commission also called for a judicial inquiry into the flare-up near the Saiyad Sarsihiddin Babba Ni Dargah that left four persons dead.

 The police action is an instance of excessive use of force in a situation that could have been handled with tact, the National Commission of Minorities said in a statement.

 It also rejected the claims of the Vadodara Municipal Corporation that the ongoing demolition drive was intended at removing illegal constructions.

 It stands to reason that a structure that predates a master plan cannot be put in the category of encroachment. Nor can it be the policy of the government to pull down historical monuments, it said.

 In Ahmedabad, minority leaders insisted the dargah, located in the middle of the road near Champaner Gate in Fatehpura was not an encroachment.

 It was 300 years old and existed in the original master city survey plan of 1921, Zuber Gopalani said.

 According to the places of worship act of 1921, it could not be called an encroachment and should have been protected, he said.

 He alleged that by razing the dargah the law-enforcers had broken the law. He dismissed the civic authorities argument that demolishing 20 temples was reason enough to pull it down.

 We were ready to demolish any illegal structure around the dargah but wanted it to be maintained, he said.

 BJP mayor Sunil Solanki defended the demolition, saying development of a city was a secular issue and every community should cooperate with civic authorities.

 Sources said minorities had been angered by the presence of some BJP leaders, including Nalin Bhatt, when the bulldozers rolled in.

 Vadodara police chief Deepak Swaroop confirmed two persons had been killed in police firing but added the clashes were not communal. The stabbing deaths were in retaliation to police action, he said.

 So far, the clash with the police has no communal tinge. But it may turn communal and that is why we have clamped curfew in other police station areas as well.

 In all, six police station areas are under curfew.

 DGP P.C. Pande said about 200 additional personnel of the state reserve police force had been sent to Vadodara. We have also kept the rapid action force on stand-by. The situation is right now under control.

 Union minister of state for home Sriprakash Jaiswal will visit the city tomorrow for a spot assessment. Gujarat home minister Amit Shah is camping in Vadodara.

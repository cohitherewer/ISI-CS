 PM to correct trust deficit with Pak

Pervez meet set to reactivate talks

 ASHIS CHAKRABARTI

 Brasilia, Sept. 12: Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs talks with President Pervez Musharraf in Havana on the sidelines of the NAM meeting are expected to lead to the resumption of foreign secretary-level dialogue between India and Pakistan. 

 The talks as well as the composite peace process between the two countries suffered a setback in the wake of the Mumbai blasts in July.

 Back-channel diplomacy is believed to have worked on the premise that the Musharraf-Manmohan talks in Havana would lead to the resumption of the composite peace process. But India would like Pakistan to show a better commitment to tackling terrorism. 

 Talking yesterday to journalists accompanying him on board the Prime Ministers plane en route to Brasilia, Singh said: Thats the minimum that I should feel commit our two governments, our two systems, to work to achieve.

 He admitted that there was a trust deficit between the two countries and we have to take that on board.

 The two countries have to work together in a manner that would inspire confidence. 

 Singh would not agree, however, that the peace process had failed to move forward in the past two years. There had been cross-border transportation not only across the two Kashmirs, but also across the two Punjabs, the increased civil society engagements and people-to-people contacts. But I cannot carry public opinion with me if acts of terrorism continue, he said.

 Singh would share with Musharraf Indias perceptions of the role of external elements in promoting terrorism in our country. Asked about any structure or agenda for his meeting with Musharraf, he said it would discuss all issues between the two countries, particularly Pakistans commitment not to allow its territory to be used by terrorists for attacks on India.

 In reply to a question on the Malegaon blasts, the Prime Minister said it would be inappropriate to rule out or rule in anything about allegations on the role of Hindu fundamentalists in the blasts. There should be a fair investigation which inspires confidence and brings out the truth and nothing but the truth. This has to be objective. 

 He, however, admitted there was scope for improvement in the strengthening of the intelligence network and in the strengthening of co-operation among the states and between the Centre and the states.

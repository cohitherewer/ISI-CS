 Nainital, Sept. 23: Sonia Gandhi today directed her partys 14 chief ministers to amend their policy on special economic zones so that land for industry did not come at the cost of the small farmer.

 Prime agriculture land should not be diverted to non-agricultural uses. Farmers must get proper compensation when their land is purchased. Could farmers also not become stakeholders in the projects that come up on the land acquired from them? the Congress president asked a meeting of party chief ministers. 

 Mentioning the farmer suicides sweeping across several states, she urged governments to act without delay. Suicides of so many farmers in some states of the country are a challenge to our collective conscience and beckon us to immediate action.

 Sonia added that no discussion on agriculture can be complete without a reference to issues like land rights and land access, particularly for the scheduled castes, tribals and minorities.

 A position paper presented at the two-day meeting pushed for a farmer-friendly national agriculture policy as opposed to the National Democratic Alliance governments corporate-friendly policy. 

 It recommended that the government consider setting up an Indian Trade Organisation with its own grading system of boxes on the model of the World Trade Organisations Blue, Green and Amber boxes.

 The WTO classifies the need for subsidies by boxes that are given the colours of traffic lights: green (permitted), amber (to be slowed down that is, reduced) and red (prohibited).

 According to the Congress paper, an ITO can serve as a brain and information bank to help the government make informed decisions. 

 The idea came from agriculture economist Prof. Swaminathan, who feels such a trade organisation can be a friend and guide to the small farmer, providing advice on land use and crop-planning.

 One of the speakers suggested that instead of talking about agriculture alone, the focus should be on rural transformation, as the Congress chief had suggested earlier.

 Finance minister P. Chidamabarm was criticised for not offering relief to heavily-indebted farmers, but he said most loans were taken from cooperative banks, which are governed by states and where the Centre has no role.

 Sonia, who accused the NDA of being insensitive to the distress of farmers throughout its term, said black money should not be allowed to seep into the rural economy.

 She also blamed Mulayam Singh Yadav, the chief minister of poll-bound Uttar Pradesh, for the stagnation in his states foodgrain production. This compelled the country to import wheat, she said.

 Mayavati to skip poll

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, Oct. 7: With Assembly elections just months away, Mayavati has decided to give municipality polls the miss to keep her party from the bickering that always accompanies distribution of tickets.

 During the last local body polls in the state, held in 2000, the party had to absorb a lot of local-level acrimony. For a single seat, multiple contenders sought party tickets and some contested as Independents when denied and lost. It took the party organisation long to recover, the Bahujan Samaj Party chief said here today.

 But the last time there was a gap of over a year between the local body polls and the state polls. Now we are left with only a couple of months, she said. We dont want to take any risks. 

 So BSP members who want to contest the elections will have to do so on their own, without the partys ticket.

 The gain from this strategy is that the BSP would welcome those candidates who win and disown those who lose. Also, it can distance itself from the results of the municipal polls.

 What Mayavati did not say was that her Jatav support base, which constitutes about 12 per cent of the more than 20 per cent Dalit votes in the state, has little presence in the municipal areas. She is not sure if the upper-caste voters she has been trying to woo through Dalit-Brahmin bhaichara (brotherhood) will support the BSP. The party is also wooing the non-Yadav other backward classes and the non-Jatav Dalit voters.

 The stress now is on weeding out the unfaithful, she said. Not only are we counting out those MLAs who sold themselves to other parties, we are gradually edging out those who were ready to sell themselves but were persuaded to stay, she said.

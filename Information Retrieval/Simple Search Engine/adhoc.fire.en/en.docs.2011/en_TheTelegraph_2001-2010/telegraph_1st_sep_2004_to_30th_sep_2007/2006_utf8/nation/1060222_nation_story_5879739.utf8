 Cull teams at minister farm gates

 SATISH NANDGAONKAR 

 Navapur, Feb. 21: Embracing personal loss for public good is the last thing politicians are famous for. But Maharashtra transport minister Swarup Singh Naik was not given a choice.

 After animal husbandry teams began culling chickens at his three poultry farms, Naik, who was yesterday lobbying the chief minister to spare the Priyanka, Akshay and Deepak farms, tried to make the best of a bad deal.

 My sons and daughters-in-law were shocked and upset. But I told them that we can recover the losses, but we cannot go against the people who voted us to power. I have represented them for the last 30 years after all, said the minister who represents Nandurbar in the Assembly.

 Naiks three farms are located at Sukhwel village, about 13 km from Navapur, which has reported the countrys first bird flu cases. Yesterday, culling operations were on at other larger farms nearby but the three were not touched. 

 The minister argued that his farms were outside the 3-km infected zone and even the 10-km surveillance zone. But after failing to persuade chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh, who visited Nandurbar yesterday, he had to give in.

 Naik did not deny, however, that he was upset that his Ambassador, with its flashing red beacon, was stopped at the entrance of Deepak Poultry Farm when he went to take stock of the culling operation. 

 I asked them, am I not being allowed into my own house? he said, speaking at his residence after initially trying to evade the media.

 Deepak and Akshay have an estimated 7,500 chickens each while the larger Priyanka houses 14,000. A team of 25 animal husbandry officials, including four doctors, today began packing live chicken into gunnybags before burying them in pits.

 On the first day, the government had announced that only birds within the 3-km infected zone would be culled. However, since last morning, culling teams have targeted poultry farms at Panagaran village, well outside the 3-km radius. Naiks three farms are located at least 5 km from Panagaran. 

 Asked why his farms were targeted despite being outside the infected zone, Naik said: Whatever the government asks us to do, we will do. They are destroying the livestock at 99 per cent of the farms, how can I say, dont do it at my farms though it is not in the radius.

 Animal husbandry minister Anees Ahmed said: The decision to expand the culling operations from 3 km to 10 km was taken at the chief ministers meeting with officials at Nandurbar yesterday. We will clear the whole area of any suspected bird flu.

 Referring to Naiks farms, he said: There was an impression created that poultry farmers of some influential people were being spared. But, we have started culling there also.

 But the culling is likely to spark a tug-of-war within the Congress-NCP alliance. Naik is one of the two powerful Congress politicians from Nandurbar, the other being the Navapur-based minister of state for home, Manikrao Gavit. NCP chief Sharad Pawar holds the agriculture and animal husbandry ministry at the Centre.

 Whatever happens in animal husbandry is decided by Sharad Pawar, Naik said.

 Terror sermon

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Hyderabad, Oct. 26: A new breed of tech-savvy, white-collar criminal has turned terrorism into the greatest threat facing the country, the Prime Minister told police today.

 Perhaps, even more than external aggression, we need to be concerned about internal security. In some instances there is, of course, an external dimension to the internal threat, Manmohan Singh said at the National Police Academy here after watching a passing-out parade by 78 IPS probationers.

 From an occasional footnote, it (terrorism) has become a hydra-headed monster. Todays terrorists are most sophisticated and have trans-national linkages and have adequate resources.

 The transformation owes much to globalisation and technology the Prime Minister said.

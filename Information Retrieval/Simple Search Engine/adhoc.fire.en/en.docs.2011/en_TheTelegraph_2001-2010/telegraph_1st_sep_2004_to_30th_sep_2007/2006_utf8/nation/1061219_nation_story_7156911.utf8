 A pat for reliable Bina

 New Delhi, Dec. 18: A weak smile lit up Bina Ramanis tear-stained face, her words barely audible, voice very shaky.

 I feel vindicated, she said, taking a deep breath, the yoga she regularly practises coming in handy.

 Three months ago, Bina had been put through the harrowing experience of spending two weeks in Tihar jail, with only common criminals for company.

 She was accused of forging liquor and ownership licences for Tamarind Court, her restaurant, where Jessica Lal was shot. Those charges still stand, but it was the bigger accusation of having helped weaken the prosecutions case against Manu Sharma that had rankled.

 Today, though, she was the heroine.

 Dismissing arguments of the trial court judge who had found Binas testimony unreliable, Delhi High Court today gave her credit for Sharmas conviction.

 From the analysis of the deposition of prosecution witness 20 (Ramani), whom we find a reliable witness and the only brave person who mustered courage to face the shooter, the involvement of Manu Sharma in the murder of Jessica Lal is writ large.

 It was Manu Sharma who pulled out his pistol and fired two shots, one at the ceiling, and the other at Jessica Lal, the bench of Justice R.S. Sodhi and Justice P.K. Bhasin said.

 Jessicas sister Sabrina was among the first to call and thank her, Bina told The Telegraph.

 She has been the one person who has maintained her version and not turned hostile, Sabrina said of Bina.

 The judges also praised Malini, Binas daughter and a co-witness, for standing her ground through the entire cross-examination.

 Bina had said in her written statement, and then in court, that she had seen Sharma leaving the bar moments after she saw Jessica fall to the ground from a bullet shot.

 I asked him who he was, why he was here, and why he had shot Jessica Lal. I also asked him to give me his gun. I thought he might be having a gun.

 Bina also said in her statement that Sharma pushed her aside and tried to escape, at which point she followed him, but could not stop him.

 The trial court had dismissed her statement as evidence as it had no explicit mention of whether she had actually witnessed Sharma shooting Jessica.

 The high court, though, interpreted the same statement quite differently.

 The fact that Bina asked Sharma why he had shot Jessica clearly shows that she had herself seen Manu Sharma shooting Jessica Lal, the high court said.

 The judges went on to reprimand the trial court judge for having allowed Sharma to get away scot free.

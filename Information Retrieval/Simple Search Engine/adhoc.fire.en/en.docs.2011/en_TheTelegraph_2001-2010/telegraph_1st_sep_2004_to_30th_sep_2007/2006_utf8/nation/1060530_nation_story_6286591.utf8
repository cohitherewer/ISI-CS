 Rogue runs free, hunters held

 Thiruvananthapuram, May 29: When forest officers failed to catch a rogue elephant, some tribals decided to hold them captive.

 Officials from Kerala and Tamil Nadu were locked inside a building in the Peppara forest range, around 50 km from here, for nearly three hours today by the group that included women and children.

 They demanded immediate capture of the elephant that has killed their kin and eaten their crops.

 Chief conservator of forests (wildlife) V. Gopinathan said his officers were held by residents of Podiyakkala in the Peppara forest range. But Ive not given any assurance to the local people or fixed a deadline for snaring the rogue elephant. Its risky, he said.

 Tribal representatives told reporters they withdrew their siege on the Eco Development Council building only after Gopinathan drove down.

 The chief conservator requested them to let assistant wildlife warden R.S. Aneesh Kumar and four officials from Tamil Nadu go out for snacks.

 The officers were taken hostage around 8.30 am and freed three hours later. Gopinathan stayed put till they were released.

 The tribals have been at the receiving end of the elephants fury for nearly two years.

 The four-tonne tusker has killed two persons and destroyed crops. Sometimes, it would also steal hooch and get tipsy.

 The elephant was hit with a mild tranquilliser dart on its hind leg on Saturday. But that did not dent its destructive streak as it continued to devour bunches of plantains, tapioca and other seasonal crops grown in tribal hamlets.

 Apart from the officers, four trainer elephants (kumkhis) brought from Tamil Nadu, vets ready with dart-tipped tranquillisers and nearly 50-odd personnel are on the jumbos trail.

 The hunt started at least a month ago when the nomadic loner came down from the hills at the peak of summer in March-April in search of food and water.

 Elephant expert Jacob Cheeran said bull elephants usually stray from the herd in their teens. But the Peppara tuskers age was found to be 40 and, therefore, it could have been looking for food, he said.

 Once denied adequate roughage in the woods, it turns to human habitat. Itll catch the scent kilometres away.

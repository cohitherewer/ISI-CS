 SC flashes green signal to dam

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 10: The Supreme Court today agreed with Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs decision not to stop construction work to raise the height of the Sardar Sarovar Dam in the larger public interest.

 The Prime Minister had taken the decision after going through a report by the Sardar Sarovar Project Relief and Rehabilitation Oversight Group on Saturday even as the Gujarat government had said it would stop work from today because of the monsoon.

 I am of the view that it would not be appropriate, in the light of the material and observations contained in the report, to pass any direction or orders at this stage stopping the construction of the dam, which is designed to serve larger public interest, Singh said in his statement, which was handed over to a bench headed by Chief Justice Y.K. Sabharwal today.

 In a setback to Medha Patkars Narmada Bachao Andolan, which has been demanding the rehabilitation of oustees before raising the dams height from 110.64 metres to 121.92 metres, the Prime Minister said the shortcomings in the relief and rehabilitation work mentioned in the report could be remedied by an accelerated pace of implementation.

 The Prime Minister pointed out that the Gujarat government would stop work on the dam from today because of the onset of monsoon. Differences with the Madhya Pradesh government came to the fore with Singh urging the court to direct the state to speed up rehabilitation during the period when there would be stoppage of work so that all affected sites can be brought on a par with each other.

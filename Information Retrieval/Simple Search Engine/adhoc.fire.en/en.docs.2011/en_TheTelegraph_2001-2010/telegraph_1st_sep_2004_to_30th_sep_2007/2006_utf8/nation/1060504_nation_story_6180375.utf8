The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Manager for 

 all seasons

 Pramod Mahajan (1949 2006)

 The designer clothes, Rayban and 

 Reebok spoke of his love for glamour and the good life. 

 Yet Pramod Mahajan was no showboy, but a doer and astute 

 manager who helped the BJP win tricky elections and make 

 a success of crucial political campaigns like the Ram rath 

 yatra.

 If politics can be compared to 

 chess, Mahajans death amounts to the loss of a grandmaster 

 for his embattled party, none of whose second rung 

 leaders possess his organisational skill, determination 

 and shrewdness ? and the ability to hide chutzpah under 

 a varnish of suave personal charm.

 These skills, so useful to the 

 party, were of no little use to his own career. Mahajan 

 was the man who could get away with almost anything.

 In recent years, the flamboyant 

 functionary ? among the first to flaunt a cell phone among 

 leading Indian politicians ? was chased by sexual and financial 

 scandals that would have wrecked the career of most. He 

 had also annoyed the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh by ushering 

 in the five-star, corporate culture in the BJP.

 He was openly accused of an affair 

 with and the murder of journalist Shivani Bhatnagar. That 

 he was the BJPs link to big money was no secret: he 

 almost flaunted his connections with the Ambanis and some 

 other top businessmen.

 Yet he kept his job in the Union 

 cabinet and continued to be a favourite with the partys 

 final court of appeal, Atal Bihari Vajpayee. And he remained 

 enough of a swayamsevak to make himself useful ? 

 that word again ? during the frequent Sangh-BJP standoffs.

 It was his usefulness 

 ?especially in raising funds? that was his USP to the saffron 

 parivar.

 L.K. Advani may have been the 

 grand strategist, but it was to Mahajan he would turn for 

 the execution of his boldest plans.

 Starting from the Ram rath yatra 

 that put the party firmly on Indias political map, 

 Mahajan was at the helm of every big event. He had sat next 

 to Advani on the chariot journey in 1990. The smallest detail 

 ? from where the workers would eat to whether the air-conditioning 

 in the chariot was working -- didnt escape him.

 The BJP owed the spectacular conquest 

 of Rajasthan to Mahajan, who pulled the rug from under the 

 Congresss feet during the 2003 Assembly elections. 

 The BJP led by a record 120 seats in a 200-member House 

 in what most newspapers speculated was a rigged 

 election. The charge, like many others, could never be proved.

 Part of the reason was Mahajans 

 ability to go on denying accusations till most people almost 

 believed him or lost interest.

 After the WLL scandal broke ? 

 it was alleged that Reliance Infocomm was allowed to launch 

 the service as a full mobility service without paying the 

 required licence fee when Mahajan was Union telecom minister 

 ? he rang up a reporter one evening.

 Voice shaking with indignation, 

 he demanded: Who has fed you this? This is the problem 

 with you people: you write about things you dont really 

 understand.

 He was shrewd enough not to mention 

 specific details in the news report; neither did he bother 

 to officially deny it. The idea was to send a personal message 

 that he was clean; and as usual, he almost managed it.

 During the six years of National 

 Democratic Alliance rule, Pramod was the BJPs all-purpose 

 man, managing elections and functions and overseeing the 

 partys performance in Parliament. Despite his relative 

 inexperience, he was arguably one of the better parliamentary 

 affairs ministers in recent times.

 For all the mockery heaped by 

 his more sophisticated party rivals on the gaudiness 

 surrounding the events he supervised, it was Mahajan whom 

 the workers favoured. He was the man who organised funds 

 and got things done.

 In an era of coalitions, the BJP 

 has lost and gained many partners. But the one alliance 

 that Mahajan personally nurtured was with the Shiv Sena 

 ? a most difficult task with the mercurial Bal Thackeray 

 in charge. Even Mahajans critics agree that without 

 him, the BJP would never have been able to cuddle the Sena 

 tiger.

 As with all big events, the 2004 

 elections were handled by Mahajan. It was to him that most 

 of the flak, too, was directed after the unexpected defeat. 

 But true to his reputation of being a survivor, Mahajan 

 resurrected himself sooner than many had expected, largely 

 thanks to his past relations with new party chief Rajnath 

 Singh.

 Mahajan had just finished with 

 the Assam elections and would have gone on to manage the 

 next general elections, too, had his younger brother not 

 stopped him short at breakfast time on a fateful Saturday 

 morning.

 SC breather for Kota missionaries

 New delhi: The Supreme Court has stayed criminal proceedings before a Rajasthan court against some Christian missionaries on their plea that they were being targeted at the behest of a BJP minister, reports our legal correspondent.

 The duo, facing charges of spreading religious hatred by selling a book, had moved the apex court seeking transfer of the case to Delhi as the state administration was showing unusual interest.

 The Supreme Court also directed the petitioners ? V.S. Thomas and Samuel Thomas of the Emmanuel Mission in Kota ? to include social welfare minister Madan Dilawar as a party in the case.

 The prosecution said the mission was selling a book, called Haqeekat, in which abusive words were used for Hindu gods and that it also targeted Jain rituals.

 The petitioners said Dilawar had announced that if he was not able to get Samuel and M.A. Thomas, the founder of the mission, arrested, the people of Kota could hang or stone them to death.

 Probe into Amarnath row

 Srinagar: Jammu and Kashmir governor Lt Gen. (retd) S.K. Sinha has ordered a probe into the allegation that the lingam in the Amarnath cave shrine had been tampered with this year, reports our correspondent.

 As board chairman, Sinha has appointed retired high court judge K.K. Gupta to probe the alleged piling of snow in place of the naturally formed ice lingam.

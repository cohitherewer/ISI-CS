 Aviation firms dip toe in India

 SUJAN DUTTA

 New Delhi, Sept. 10: Global aviation firms have signed technical agreements for military aircraft or are announcing investment plans in India after defence minister Pranab Mukherjee announced a new acquisitions policy last week and said multi-billion dollar orders for military equipment will be subject to the new rules.

 Defence ministry sources said that the Defence Acquisition Council will be constituted shortly for the Indian Air Forces 126 multi-role combat aircraft (MRCA) order, an order for 197 helicopters for the Indian Army and another possible order of upto 70 helicopters for the air force.

 Since the defence acquisition policy was announced, it is being increasingly conveyed that the choice of the winners for the orders will not depend solely on L1 (lowest bidder). Lifecycle costs and commitment to supplying spares will also be taken into account. The rules under which the orders will be issued will be vetted by the Central Vigilance Commissioner and the contractor will have to commit to a no-bribery agreement.

 The Request for Proposals (RFP) for the 126 MRCAs would have been out in June but is still awaiting political clearance that is wanting for more than one reason, the most important being the diplomatic signal that New Delhi wants to send out by placing the order that could be between $7 billion and $12 billion.

 The American companies (Lockheed and Boeing) are lobbying strongly for the order. The French, the Swedish and the Russians are making attractive offers in their own ways. There are indications also that the Indian Air Force could ultimately consider splitting the order and actually go for more than one type of aircraft.

 The principal contenders for the MRCA order are Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Gripen, RS-MiG Corporation and Dassault Aviation. EADS is also competing with its Eurofighter Typhoon. Boeing and Lockheed Martin have announced major investment plans in India either on their own or in tie-ups with Hindustan Aeronautics for servicing and maintenance of aircraft and spares.

 EADS Eurocopter and Bell Helicopters are also in the race for a 197-helicopter order from the Army Aviation Corps that could be in the region of $6 billion. 

 MiG and Dassault already have running agreements for separate projects with the Indian Air Force because their aircraft are in its fighter fleet. 

 EADS AS550 helicopter and Bells 407 are shortlisted for the army order and have been given trials. EADS has also announced investment plans of more than $2 billion over the next decade for research and development in India.

 Plea to lift Pak movie ban

 IMTIAZ GUL AND AGENCIES

 Islamabad, Dec. 13: Pakistani film exhibitors want the three-decade ban on screening of Indian movies to be lifted, saying it was necessary to revive the countrys film industry.

 The Pakistani Film Exhibitors Association has filed a petition in Sindh High Court asking for permission to import and screen Indian films in movie theatres.

 Amicus curiae Qazi Faez Isa argued that the ban was irrational and had resulted in several cinemas closing down over the years. It had also brought down the number and quality of films produced in Pakistan.

 The industry is in dire straits and the court can take judicial notice of the consequences of an unreasonable ban, he was quoted as saying by a newspaper.

 But Pakistani culture minister G.G. Jamal ruled out both import and screening of Indian films. How can we allow exhibition of Indian films in Pakistan when our local industry is in a shambles? he asked.

 We will submit a detailed reply in the light of the governments existing policy whenever the court summons our representative, said Jamal, who plans to travel to India in January to discuss the possibility of co-production between the two countries.

 He said the government would have no objection if Pakistani and Indian directors co-produce movies as that would help revive the local industry.

 Pakistan had about 750 movie theatres in the 1970s, but the figure is now down to 250. 

 The number of films being produced dropped to 15 last year from 150 in the 1970s.

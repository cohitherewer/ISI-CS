 Abu Salem: Recall gambit

 Mumbai, Sept. 11: The last hurdle before the designated Tada (anti-terror law) court hearing the 1993 Bombay blasts case has been removed.

 Abu Salem has decided not to press his plea before the Supreme Court seeking a bar on separation of his trial from that of the other accused. The petition has, however, not been technically withdrawn.

 We have decided not to press with the separation of trial issue. But we will wait for the SC order on our plea regarding pressing of additional charges by CBI against Salem, the dons lawyer, Ashok Saraogi, said.

 He said the plan was to not put up the separation of trial issue before the Indian courts at all.

 We have written to Portugal authorities pleading that Salem should be recalled by them. Lisbon had extradited him for being tried in the 1993 blasts case. But now there is this attempt to separate his trial from the rest of the blasts accused by pressing additional charges against him. This is not acceptable to us and is against the grounds of extradition, he said.

 Salem was extradited on specific charges of delivering arms to actor Sanjay Dutts residence. Later, the CBI pressed additional charges that Salem had picked up the arms from Bharuch in Gujarat and delivered them to Dutt, which pointed at deeper involvement. The gangsters trial was separated by the special Tada court on June 13.

 Special public prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam said Salems petition would not debar the court from delivering the judgment tomorrow.

 Legal experts are, however, sceptical that the verdict will be given tomorrow. They say that sifting through the voluminous evidence and writing out the judgment for 123 accused is a mammoth task and could take a while.

 All 123 accused, including Dutt and 85 others out on bail, have been directed to be present in the court.

 Sangh fears CD rerun

 POORNIMA JOSHI

 New Delhi, Jan. 10: The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, scalded by the Sanjay Joshi sex sting, could be hit by more sleaze CDs ? this time involving senior ideologues.

 Whispers of there being two more sex CDs got louder in parivar circles after a senior BJP leader today declared that another bombshell was in the offing.

 There will be a dhamaka (bombshell) soon, the leader said after being asked whether more CDs of the Sanjay Joshi variety were likely to appear.

 The Sangh is livid with such insinuations, especially after senior functionary M.G. Vaidya, too, dropped similar hints.

 Vaidya, in an article for Sangh mouthpiece Tarun Bharat, confirmed the existence of another sex CD involving a senior Sangh functionary.

 He also hinted that Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi was the mastermind behind the sting on Joshi.

 Although Sangh chief K.S. Sudarshan is believed to have rapped Vaidya for the article, the growing talk of new CDs has caused panic in Sangh circles. Instructions have been issued in the Sangh headquarters to frisk outsiders, and pracharaks have been asked to be cautious with strangers.

 Sangh spokesperson Ram Madhav was clearly unhappy with Vaidya for having spoken out of turn.

 Why dont we just wait for the Madhya Pradesh police to come out with a report on who has trapped Sanjay Joshi? There is no need to speculate when the truth is going to come out soon anyway, Madhav said.

 He denied any reports of new CDs and stressed that the Sangh did not suspect anyone in the BJP ? whether in Gujarat or Delhi ? to have plotted Joshis disgraceful ouster from the party.

 Joshi was on deputation to the BJP from the Sangh. He was the official link between the two and held the post of general secretary (organisation) in the party. The sting on him was largely seen as a move to embarrass the entire Sangh.

 Senior BJP leaders had at the time suggested that the CD had exposed the Sanghs real character.

 The Advani camp was gloating because the CD surfaced soon after several Sangh-loyalist MPs had been filmed accepting bribes. In the cash-for-questions scam, four of the six accused BJP members had been staunch Sangh swayamsevaks.

 Where is the question of morality now? an Advani loyalist had said at the partys recent conclave in Mumbai.

 Vaidya, in his signed article Narendra Modichya Gujaratmadhye (in Modis Gujarat), hinted that senior BJP leaders in Delhi and Gujarat were involved in the sting on Joshi.

 ?From what I heard, I had a feeling that someone from Delhi could be behind this. I was reminded of Iago in Shakespeares Othello. Could there be an Iago in the BJP? Vaidya wrote.

 But when I heard that the story had a Gujarat angle? I was reminded of two more characters from another Shakespeare play ? Macbeth and Lady Macbeth. The ambitions of a revenge-filled man and jealousy give rise to sin.

 Asked whether he was blaming Modi for the Joshi CD, Vaidya told reporters they could draw whatever inferences they wanted to.

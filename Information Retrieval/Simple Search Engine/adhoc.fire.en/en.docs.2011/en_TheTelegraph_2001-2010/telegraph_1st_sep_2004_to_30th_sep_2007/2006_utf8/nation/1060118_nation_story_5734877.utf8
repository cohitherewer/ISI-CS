 ONGC extortion doubt

 OUR BUREAU

 Guwahati/New Delhi, Jan. 17: Assam today ordered that security be beefed up in and around installations of the ONGC after it was served with a demand for Rs 500 crore, apparently by the Ulfa. 

 A worried Mamoni Raisom Goswami, mediator in the Assam peace process, scurried to secure a clarification from the militant outfit, fearing there could be an adverse fallout from the damning charge. 

 Goswami said that after the matter was brought to her notice, she sought a clarification from the outfit through her contacts about the veracity of the demand note, purportedly issued by the outfits Myanmar-based 28 battalion. 

 She, however, expressed doubts about the authenticity of the note. She argued that of late, miscreants have issued several demands in the Ulfas name. 

 Paresh Baruah ? the Ulfas commander-in-chief ? himself told me recently that most of the demand notes being served in Upper Assam in the name of his organisation are fake, Goswami said. 

 Goswami, who has single-handedly been able to convince the Ulfa leadership to sit across the table with Delhi for a negotiated settlement of its demands, said she would be able to confirm the authenticity of the letter within a couple of days. The ONGC received the demand note by post. 

 B.K. Gohain, commissioner and secretary to chief minister Tarun Gogoi, said superintendents of police of Sivasagar and Jorhat have been asked to beef up security around the oil giants Assam asset headquarters at Nazira as well as its other installations. 

 Though we are not sure whether the Ulfa has actually issued the demand note, we are not taking any chances and have strengthened security measures in and around ONGC installations, he said. 

 Gohain said the state government was trying to verify whether the extortion note was authentic. He said the government would match the note received by the ONGC with Ulfa documents available with the government. 

 We have the technology and the expertise to match two documents to ascertain authenticity, he added. 

 Sources said the special branch of Assam police has been asked to ascertain the genuineness of the letter. 

 Earlier, the ONGC had asked the Assam government to verify the authenticity of a demand note. 

 We find it hard to believe that the Ulfa would send such a demand at a time when they have expressed willingness to sit for talks with the government, a high-level source said. 

 He added that some unscrupulous elements could be behind the move to extract money in the outfits name. 

 Sources explained that since it is a public sector unit, the question of payment of taxes did not arise. We wont pay anything. Operations in Assam may have to be brought to a close if we are forced to shell out such a high amount, the source said.

 Mumbai, Aug. 26: When Asha Bhonsle and Sachin Tendulkar pay their annual visit to the Lalbaugcha Raja Ganesh pandal this year, police cameras will be watching them as well as the medias.

 The police of terrorism-hit Mumbai will deploy four mobile vans with closed-circuit cameras to strengthen vigil at the big pandals during the 10-day Ganesh festival beginning Sunday.

 Lalbaugcha Raja, one of the largest pandals, expects 35,000 visitors every day, including a host of celebrities. Tendulkar visits the pandal, located in central Mumbais Parel, during the festival every year and donates a sum.

 Following repeated warnings from central intelligence agencies of a possible terror attack during the festival, the city police have put their 45,000 personnel on maximum alert and deployed hi-tech surveillance.

 Apart from closed-circuit cameras that can zoom up to 100 metres, the police will be using wireless vans fitted with the global positioning system and geographic information system, and broadband Internet.

 The festival will be celebrated at over 40,000 Ganesh pandals across Maharashtra, with Mumbai accounting for 7,000 registered pandals and 5,000 unregistered ones.

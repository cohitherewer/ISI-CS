 New Delhi, Dec. 1: Navjyot Singh Sidhu was asked what hed do if the BJP shut its doors on him after his conviction. Agar meri chachi ki moochhen hoti, to woh mera chacha hota (If my aunt had a moustache, she would have been my uncle), was his reply.

 The Sidhuisms were in full flow as he faced the media this afternoon, hours after being convicted of causing the death of a person after a Patiala parking brawl. The BJP had got him to put in his Lok Sabha papers and were parading him as an example of the partys morality and ethical standards.

 Sidhu had earlier written to A.B. Vajpayee, L.K. Advani and Rajnath Singh asking for permission to step down. After all three advised him to quit, he sent in his resignation to the Speaker.

 In an 18-year-old case arising out of alleged road rage, the high court has passed an adverse order against me. The high court will hear my lawyers on Wednesday with regard to the quantum of punishment.

 Without resorting to technical arguments about what the quantum of punishment would be and my right to challenge the judgement in appeal, I tender my resignation as member of the Lok Sabha.

 Ive always stood for truth and moral grounds and these principles are above any office or power that I hold, said Sidhu in his resignation letter.

 However, the Speaker had not accepted his resignation till late in the evening. The reason, said sources in the Speakers office, was that Sidhu had made references to the high court judgment and his own conviction to truth and morality.

 The rule book says the resignation letter has to be simple. You cannot make moral pronouncements nor can you make references to the courts. You have to be simple and direct that you resign from such and such date if you are really serious, a source said.

 Having made a big noise about Sidhus resignation, BJP spokesperson Sushma Swaraj asserted he had the partys full backing and he would campaign for the Punjab elections if he got a reprieve from the Supreme Court.

 Sidhu, too, put up a brave front, cracking jokes and explaining his immediate plans to television crews that trailed him. I would appear before the high court where the sentence is to be pronounced on Wednesday, he said.

 Sushma backed him, arguing he had set an example of pure conduct by resigning. He did not hide like a coward, neither did he make any pretence of being ill. He has faced the world like a lion. He is an eminent member of the BJP.

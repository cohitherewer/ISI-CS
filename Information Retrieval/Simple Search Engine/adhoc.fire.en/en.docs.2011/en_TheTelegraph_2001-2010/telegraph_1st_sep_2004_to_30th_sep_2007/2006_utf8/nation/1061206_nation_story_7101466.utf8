 Delhi people push vs Pak territory thrust

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Musharraf

 New Delhi, Dec. 5: Pakistan President Pervez Musharrafs self-governance plan for Jammu and Kashmir is not acceptable to India, which favours consultations between democratic institutions on either side of the LoC.

 Indias people-centric approach as opposed to Pakistans territory-centric stand was explained by former foreign secretary Shyam Saran at a recent function.

 Saran, who led Indias talks with Pakistan on Kashmir in the past couple of years, said if Islamabad is serious about self-governance, it should create truly representative institutions on its side of the LoC. This includes not only Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, but also Gilgit and Baltistan.

 Delhi is in favour of cross-LoC consultations between truly representative and self-governing institutions to address shared challenges, such as water management, safeguarding the environment and promotion of local cultures, he said.

 Sarans comments came before Musharraf proposed a four-point solution to the Kashmir problem. Musharraf suggested that Pakistan would give up its claim over Jammu and Kashmir if India agreed to local self-governance, phased withdrawal of troops and a joint supervision mechanism without altering borders. Officially, India has not reacted to the proposal.

 The comments of Musharraf and Saran have brought to the surface the back-channel activity between Delhi and Islamabad on Kashmir.

 Pakistan foreign secretary Riaz Mohammad Khan, who was in Delhi last month for talks with his Indian counterpart Shiv Shankar Menon, acknowledged the exchanges when he said that never in the history of Indo-Pak relations has Kashmir been discussed so extensively as in the past two years.

 Outlining Indias stand on Pakistans suggestions, Saran said self-governance has been interpreted by Islamabad to imply dividing Jammu and Kashmir along ethnic and religious lines. Islamabad even suggested that if India cannot accept division based on religion, it could consider ethnicity and kinship.

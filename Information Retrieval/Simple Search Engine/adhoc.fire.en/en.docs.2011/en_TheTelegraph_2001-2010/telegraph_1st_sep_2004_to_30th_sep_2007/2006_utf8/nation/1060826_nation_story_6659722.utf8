 Aul (Kendrapara), Aug. 25: Every afternoon at Aul, a sleepy town 130 km south of Bhubaneswar, a gaggle of belles has a ball, literally. 

 The girls, still in their sweaty school uniforms, hotfoot their way to a marshy playground adjacent to the school, where they quickly change into worn-out jerseys for a game of football.

 One of them is Shradhanjali Sahoo, who last month sent a brilliant floater to teammate Rashmita Podh in the 44th minute of Orissas final match against Manipur in the national Under-17 championship in Chandigarh. In the next few seconds, Podh neatly pushed the ball past the helpless Manipuri goalkeeper. The cross from Sahoo, the captain of the womens team and a mean defender herself, was crucial as that was the only goal of the match won by Orissa.

 As the states soccer eves revel in their newfound glory, Aul can stake claim to being their nursery. As many as four girls in the winning U-17 team Sahoo, Sangita Ray, Shrimati Samal and Rashmita Patro are from the nondescript town of 20,000 in Kendrapara district, which has nothing better than a crumbling palace as its USP. 

 In the states Under-19, five players Sashmita Mallick, Suprava Samal, Sangita Patra, Alochana Senapati and Bijoylaxmi Sahu are from here. At present, as many as 12 of the 22 in the state sports hostel in Bhubaneswar are from Aul. Every year, we get two to three girls from Aul. We would take more of them had there been seats. They are disciplined, well-versed with the nuances of the game and have a hunger to succeed, said Bijay Kanungo, a football coach at the hostel.

 Auls first brush with womens football was in 2001 when some matches of the womens Federation Cup were played in its only stadium. It was an eye-opener for the local girls, who watched the tournament as if it were the World Cup. 

 For them, football was an escape route from the drudgery of life, explains Devendra Sharma, whose Aul Athletic Association cashed in on the newfound craze for football and formed a womens team. 

 Three hundred girls applied, of whom 50 made it to the final list. There were many who hadnt touched a football in their life, but still they wanted to play, says Sharma.

 However, the girls craze for football was soon met with disapproval from parents who were scared that their daughters would no longer be eligible for marriage if they played a mans game. But the reluctance soon gave way to unabashed support once they realised football could be passport to a better future. 

 Kailash Mallick, father of Gayatri Mallick, skipper of the Utkal Universitys women team, is one such parent who made the transformation. In November 2005, she pumped in 13 goals in two matches at the inter-university championship in Imphal. 

 Playing will keep her fit and if she excels, thats even better, says the senior Mallick, a lowly block extension educator.

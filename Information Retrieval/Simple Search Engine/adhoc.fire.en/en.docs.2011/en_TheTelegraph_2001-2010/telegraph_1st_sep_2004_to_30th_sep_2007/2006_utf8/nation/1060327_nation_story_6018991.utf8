 In Dickensian Dubai, labour outcry

 Dubai, March 26: For Rajee Kumaran, this was the city of dreams.

 Dubais gleaming highrises, idyllic beaches and seemingly limitless opportunities glittered on the pages of brochures and in the stories told by labourers returning home to his native Kerala.

 But after five years here, surviving in squalid conditions and 550 dirhams (about Rs 6,600) a month, the 28-year-old says his dream has long faded.

 I thought this was the land of opportunity, but I was fooled, he said on Thursday, standing with fellow construction workers outside their camp in the desert on the citys outskirts.

 When hundreds of workers angered by low salaries and mistreatment rioted on Tuesday at the site of what is to become the worlds tallest skyscraper, they were expressing the growing frustration of Asian migrants here.

 Far from the highrise towers and luxury hotels, the workers turning this swathe of desert into a modern metropolis live in a Dickensian world of cramped labour camps, low pay and increasing desperation.

 For years, workers like Kumaran have done whatever they could to get here, often paying thousands of dollars to unscrupulous recruiters.

 Of the 1.5 million residents of Dubai, a million are immigrant workers, the largest sub-group being construction workers, said Hadi Ghaemi, a Human Rights Watch researcher. Most come from the Indian subcontinent and the Philippines.

 The workers camps have been set up ever deeper in the desert. That takes an hour or two just to get to the site every morning, in addition to the 12-hour shifts.

 A growing number have resorted to suicide rather than return home with empty pockets: last year, 84 South Asians killed themselves in Dubai, up from 70 in 2004.

 Kumaran sends home almost half his earnings. He is left with barely enough to pay for food and cigarettes and use his cellphone from time to time. He isnt sure how he will repay the loan he took to get here.

 Since last September, labourers have held at least eight major strikes, but Tuesdays mass action was the most significant. Hundreds of workers building the Burj Dubai skyscraper chased security guards and broke into offices, smashing computers, scattering files and wrecking cars and construction machines. 

 The next day, labourers building an airport terminal across town also laid down their tools.

 The workers have few rights. Visa sponsors and employers often confiscate their passports and residency permits, restricting their movement and ability to report abuse. Unions are banned.

 Denial of wages is the most common abuse, as contracting companies typically wait to pay their workers until they themselves get paid. Some workers have been denied wages for over 10 months, only to lose the entire salary when the contracting companies go bankrupt.

 The labour ministry has made rule changes to allow workers to change employers more easily and imposed strict penalties on employers who do not pay their labourers. Workers can call a toll-free hotline to the ministry to lodge complaints. Ministry inspectors travel to work camps to inspect them.

 The problem is, only 80 government inspectors oversee about 200,000 companies and other establishments that employ migrant workers, Ghaemi said.

 As he boards a bus to his construction site, Kumaran says he looks up at Dubais skyline of gleaming highrises with a degree of sadness.

 I wish the rich people would realise who is building these towers, he said. I wish they could come and see how sad this life is.

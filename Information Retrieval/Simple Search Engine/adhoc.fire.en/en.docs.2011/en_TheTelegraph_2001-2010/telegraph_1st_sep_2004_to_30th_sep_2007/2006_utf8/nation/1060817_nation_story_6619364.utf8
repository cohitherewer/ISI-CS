 Madarsas open I-Day doors 

 DHIRENDRA K. JHA

 New Delhi, Aug. 16: As many as 200 madarsas invited district magistrates and senior police officials to join the Independence Day celebrations yesterday.

 All of them about 150 in western Uttar Pradesh and the rest in Gujarat, Bengal and Maharashtra are run by the Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind. 

 We feel that there is some misconception and misinformation regarding the madarsas. It is our duty to correct it, Jamiat secretary Niaz Ahmed Farooqui said. The organisation runs a majority of the madarsas in the country.

 At most places, the officials not only attended the flag-hoisting ceremony but also joined in interactive sessions with teachers and students.

 In previous years, individual madarsas have sometimes invited district officials for Independence Day celebrations. But this is the first time an effort has been made by Jamiat to open the doors of so many of its madarsas to the local authorities.

 Farooqui said the initiative was aimed at showing the officials that madarsas are like any other educational institution. 

 After the Mumbai blasts that were blamed on groups such as the Lashkar-e-Toiba and the Students Islamic Movement of India, the Muslim community and madarsas, in particular, find themselves being viewed with suspicion.

 The guests appreciated the Jamiat move, Farooqui said. It not only removed misgivings but also resulted in better understanding of the curriculum and the functioning of madarsas by the district officials, he said.

 The Jamiat would keep encouraging the madarsas it runs to invite officials from time to time to end the spread of misinformation among the public.

 Madarsas are often accused of churning out terrorists, a charge that is used to communalise society and reap political dividends.

 Farooqui said madarsas run by the Jamiat have in the past, too, invited local officials to the flag hoisting ceremony on Independence Day. 

 But because of the misinformation being spread especially after the Mumbai blasts, the Jamiat has decided to step up our madarsas interaction with the local authorities from this year onwards. This would help in clearing the air.

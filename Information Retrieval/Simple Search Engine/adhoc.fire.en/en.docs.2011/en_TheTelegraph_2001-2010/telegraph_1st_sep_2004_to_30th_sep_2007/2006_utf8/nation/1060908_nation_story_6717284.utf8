 Death plea for Mattoo killer

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 7: The CBI today said it would seek death sentence for Santosh Singh, accused of raping and murdering Priyadarshini Mattoo. 

 The agency, however, has not yet proved either of the charges in the case that dates back to January 23, 1996, when Mattoo was raped and strangled at her home.

 Additional solicitor-general Amarendra Saran, who appeared for the CBI, said this was a fit case for a death sentence.

 But the time for arguing on the quantum of punishment will only come if the accused is held guilty. 

 The CBI, which had filed an appeal against Singhs acquittal by a trial court, said there was sufficient circumstantial evidence to prove the two charges against him. 

 Saran pointed out that the DNA report, rejected by the trial court on technical grounds, was in favour of the prosecution and had been corroborated by the expert who conducted the test. 

 There was also evidence to prove the motive behind the crime, he argued.

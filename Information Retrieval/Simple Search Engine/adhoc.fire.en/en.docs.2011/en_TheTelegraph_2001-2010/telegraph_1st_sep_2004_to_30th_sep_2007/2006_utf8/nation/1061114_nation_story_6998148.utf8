 Talks on terror, eyes on Kashmir

 New Delhi, Nov. 13: Terrorism may be on top of the agenda when Indian and Pakistani foreign secretaries sit across the negotiating table at Hyderabad House tomorrow, but outside it, Islamabad will not lose sight of Kashmir.

 A cross-section of Kashmiri separatist leaders gathered in Delhi for an audience with Pakistan foreign secretary Riaz Mohammad Khan. Khan plans to meet each leader separately at Pakistan House after the talks tomorrow.

 Sources said the initial plan was to meet all factions together, but the chairman of Hurriyats hardline faction, Syed Ali Shah Geelani, insisted on meeting the foreign secretary separately. The talks are seen as an attempt by Pakistan to establish a joint platform of various groups.

 Among those supposed to meet Khan is a delegation of Jammu and Kashmir Democratic Freedom Party led by Shabbir Shah. Abdul Ghani Butt will lead the moderate faction of Hurriyat. Mirwaiz Umer Farooq, a prominent moderate voice, will skip the event as he is touring Egypt.

 Sources said informal discussions have been held between Kashmir forums activated by Delhi and Islamabad. While this has been denied officially, the two sides are reported to have exchanged notes on the issue. 

 Officially, India says it is ready to discuss all issues with Pakistan, including Jammu and Kashmir, but Islamabad will first have to deliver on its commitment on terrorism. 

 Soon after arriving in Delhi, Khan heading a nine-member delegation that includes Pakistans high commissioner-designate to Delhi, Shahid Malik said he expects very constructive discussions. Indias foreign secretary, Shiv Shankar Menon, hosted a dinner for the team just after they had touched down in the capital.

 Delhi is pinning hopes on finalising the broad contours of the joint mechanism on terrorism. Menon and Khan will have the mandate to hammer out the mechanism finalised by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and President Pervez Musharraf. 

 The forum will be used by India to share evidence of Mumbai bomb blasts. Delhi will not share the complete case dossier with Islamabad, but will only provide investigation leads that point to the involvement of groups based in Pakistan. 

 Officials said India will propose a two-tier mechanism that will work at formulating the policy and its implementation.

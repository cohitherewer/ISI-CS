 Happy to escape, anxious to return

 Mumbai, July 22: At nine months, Jasleen is too young to understand what has been happening around her for the past 10 days. Perched on her mother Sarpreet Kaurs shoulders, she flashed a toothless grin as she emerged out of the arrival lounge at Mumbai airport late last night on her way to Punjab.

 Jasleen was one of the 602 tired but relieved first batch of evacuees brought to India before midnight on Friday. They were ferried by INS Mumbai from Beirut to Lanarka in Cyprus, and put on two special Air-India flights last evening. One Boeing 747 flew directly to Chennai with 341 Tamil Nadu-based passengers, while the other aircraft touched down in Mumbai at 11.05 pm.

 She was scared, but has been smiling ever since we boarded INS Mumbai, Jasleens father Kamaljit Singh said as he patted his daughters head. 

 Kamaljit had moved to Beirut in 1994 to work as a crane operator. 

 There used to be clashes between Israel and Hizbollah, but the last few days have been more like a war. We managed to live in basements for the first few days, but it became impossible to survive, he said, rushing to catch a connecting flight to New Delhi.

 Balbir Singh, 34, and wife Kalvinder Kaur, from Sangrur in Punjab, had been living comfortably in Beirut on his monthly income of about Rs 20,000 as a petrol pump employee for nine years. 

 None of us from Punjab wanted to come back. Life is very comfortable in Beirut, people are nice and friendly. We would like to go back to Beirut once this crisis is over, he said.

 Bombs exploded very close to us, said Kalvinder, happy that she will be reunited with her school-going daughter who lives in Sangrur.

 With banks closed, the couple left behind the bulk of their savings and boarded INS Mumbai with whatever little they had with them. 

 We are grateful to the Indian government for rushing to help us. There are hundreds of people from other countries still waiting for their governments to move, Balbir said.

 Many of those who returned on the first flight belong to the working class. 

 Deedar Singh, 45, who had worked at the French library in Beirut for 15 years, said: Its like a third world war. There is destruction all around, with women and children dying. 

 The $700 he earned every month supported his wife and two children in Ambala.

 Dhan Singh, working as a chef at an Indian restaurant in Beirut for six years, was shaken. The Israeli army has entered South Lebanon and is barely 10 km from Beirut. I am not sure I can ever return.

 Ahmedabad-based consultant Prakash Dave narrated how the Indian community had almost lost hope of surviving the conflict. When INS Mumbai arrived in Beirut, our morale went up, he said.

 Israel wants to finish off Lebanon. They are destroying everything ? bridges, airports, hospitals, banks, industries. They destroyed an Indian factory employing 350 people on July 19, he said, furious. 

 Air-India spokesperson Jitendra Bhargava said: Of the 241 passengers who landed in Mumbai, 119 travelled to Chennai, 88 to Delhi, seven to Kathmandu. Six were from Thiruvananthapuram, one each from Calcutta, Bangalore and Hyderabad and 38 from Mumbai.

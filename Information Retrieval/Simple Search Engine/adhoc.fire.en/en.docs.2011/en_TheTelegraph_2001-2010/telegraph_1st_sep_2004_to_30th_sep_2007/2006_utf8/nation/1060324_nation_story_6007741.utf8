 Mother shocks Rae Bareli

 Rae Bareli, March 23 (PTI): The news of Sonia Gandhis resignation has left her constituency numb with shock.

 Residents of Rae Bareli came out of their homes today and assembled at street crossings and tea stalls.

 She is like our mother?. She treats us as her family members, said Sushma Kumari, who lives in Nirala Nagar Colony.

 There were others who basked in her glory. 

 Sonia is a symbol of sacrifice.? She sacrificed the post of Prime Minister and now she has sacrificed her Lok Sabha membership, Raj Kumar Gupta, a shop-owner, said.

 After the shock came some solace for Sonias family as the Congress president announced that she would contest again from Rae Bareli.

 The people of Rae Bareli will again see that she re-enters the Lok Sabha by an even bigger margin this time, promised Ram Naresh, a resident of Gangaganj near the city.

 Telephone industry workers and local Congress activists also took to the streets and shouted slogans like Sonia Gandhi amar rahein (Long live Sonia Gandhi).

 Sonia visit

 Sonia Gandhi is expected to visit Rae Bareli in a couple of days.

 Congress sources said a date is yet to be finalised, but it would be as early as possible.

 No change in House schedule for profit bill

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 2: The Centre will not convene an emergency session of Parliament to discuss the Prevention of Disqualification bill, which was returned by President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam with a series of his observations, nor will it bring forward the monsoon session, said parliamentary affairs minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi today.

 It will be held as scheduled in the third week of July.

 Briefing the media after a meeting of the cabinet committee on economic affairs and the cabinet, Das Munshi said the bill, exempting certain offices held by members of Parliament as offices of profit, was not discussed. 

 Under Article 111 (of the Constitution), the President returned the bill to Parliament. It has, therefore, to be considered by Parliament in the monsoon session and not the cabinet. We have no plan and there is no need either to prepone the monsoon session. It will be held as per the normal schedule, he said.

 Government sources said informal consultations will be held with the Left Front and the UPA allies on Kalams proposals. But it is most unlikely that any of the three proposals he made will be incorporated, they added.

 The reason was none of them the need for an uniform law in the Centre, the states and the Union territories, why the amendments should apply with retrospective effect and the propriety of passing them at a time when the Election Commission was already scrutinising certain petitions against MPs holding offices of profit specifically related to a clause or provision in the bill under consideration. 

 They are general in nature and for every argument mustered in favour of the Presidents proposals, there is a counter-argument. For instance, how can we enact an uniform law in a federal structure? asked sources.

 There will be no cosmetic changes, either because sources explained that incorporating any or all of Kalams proposals would entail full-fledged amendments. 

 For example, if the government was to seriously consider having a uniform law, it may have to even amend the Constitution.

 In 1986, when the then President, Giani Zail Singh, returned the Indian Post Office (Amendment) bill to Parliament, he had specifically questioned the amendment in Section 16 which vested certain authorities with the right to intercept or detain postal articles on stipulated grounds.

 Das Munshi said the Presidents message (on the bill) was already incorporated in the Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha bulletins, according to the rule which requires this procedure to be done when Parliament is not in session.

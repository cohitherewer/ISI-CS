 No chances with rogue traffickers

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Abdul Qadeer Khan

 New Delhi, Dec. 8: If there 

 is one lesson that the Americans have learnt from the friendly 

 neighbourhood nuclear store that was being run by Pakistans 

 rogue scientist Abdul Qadeer Khan, it is to prevent its 

 future occurrence. 

 To this end, Pakistans sins have been reflected in a new section added to the reconciled bill to permit civilian nuclear cooperation with India. The basic aim of the provision is to ensure that should an Indian follow in the footsteps of Khan, the civilian nuclear cooperation with India would be terminated.

 If an Indian person ever transfers nuclear or nuclear-related material, equipment or technology that is not consistent with NSG (Nuclear Suppliers Group) guidelines or decisions, the cooperation with India would be immediately jeopardised. If the Indian person instead transfers ballistic missile or missile-related equipment or technology that is not consistent with the guidelines of the Missile Technology Control Regime, even then the arrangement would be terminated.

 The definition of Indian person is very broad in the bill. It not only includes a citizen of India but also a corporation, business association, partnership, society, trust, or any other non-government entity, organisation or group organised under the laws of India and which conducts business principally from India. All government entities, including those operating as business enterprises, are included in the term Indian person.

 However, there are three exceptions where the US President may not terminate the overall cooperation in the nuclear field with India. 

 One, if he determines that such transfers were made without the knowledge of the Government of India. 

 Two, at the time of the illegal transfer the Government of India did not own, control or direct the Indian person or if the individual acted without the knowledge of the entities he was associated with (also defined broadly as Indian person).

 Three, if the US President certifies to Congress that India has taken or is taking appropriate judicial or other enforcement actions against the accused.

 Clearly, the conference committee of the US Congress has taken the A.Q. Khan case, seen the inability of the US administration to take criminal action against him and transferred the scenario to India. This is an attempt to see that in the unlikely event of such an eventuality, India does not get away scot-free as Pakistan did.

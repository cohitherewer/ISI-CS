 PMO prod to China border road

 New Delhi, May 4: A major push to build and upgrade roads in border areas is likely this year, beginning with the Northeast, after instructions from the Prime Ministers Office.

 The Border Roads Organisation, an outfit headed by the army, has been asked to intensify road-building in the Northeast, especially along the border with China.

 This follows an assessment in the government that China has connected important posts along the Line of Actual Control ? the dispute on which is being negotiated by the special envoys from New Delhi and Beijing ? with feeder links to main roads. A BRO source said the outfit has been asked to take up projects in consonance with a look east policy that Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is keen on.

 The BRO is, of course, not identifying this focus on road-building as a response to Chinese activity across the Line of Actual Control but as a drive to connect marginal regions with the hinterland. 

 The BRO director-general, Lieutenant General K.S. Rao, pointed out that the all-India density of roads is 80 km per 100 square km but in a border state like Arunachal Pradesh it is a mere 16 km per 100 square km.

 The Cabinet Committee on Security has approved a special accelerated road development programme for the Northeast. In the first phase, the BRO has been asked to take up building and/or improvement of 492 km.

 Rao said the only foreign project the BRO is engaged in after the Zaranj-Delaram project in Afghanistan is beyond the north-eastern border with Myanmar. It has been tasked to build and maintain a 160 km Tamu-Kalemyo-Kalwa road from Manipur to Myanmar.

 BRO engineers have also been asked to build and maintain more than 1,500 km of roads in Bhutan.

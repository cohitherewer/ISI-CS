 Mumbai nights lose life

 Mumbai, Feb. 9 (Reuters): Nightlife in the countrys entertainment capital has become dull, youngsters in Mumbai complain, as the authorities continue a crackdown on discos and bars that they accuse of corrupting impressionable young minds.

 The citys nightlife ? not so long ago pulsating, risque and never-ending ? has become a non-event, they say, ever since officials declared a war on adult fun in August, forcing hundreds of popular dance bars to shut their doors saying they bred crime and prostitution.

 Thousands of dancers found themselves out of work, with many moving to other states to earn a living. Others are reported to have become prostitutes. 

 As if that was not bad enough for Mumbais party set, police are now reining in the citys ordinary watering holes, asking them to obtain a dozen licences, pull down the shutters at midnight and make their guests behave.

 This is moral policing at its best and we dont need any of this, said Sebastian Ambrose, a computer professional and a regular pub-goer. They say this city never sleeps. Now Mumbai sleeps by 12. 

 More than 30 pubs have closed in the last two weeks, with the police often kicking out drinkers as they relaxed after work, and many more look set to follow unless the authorities relent.

 Anyone hoping to serve alcohol needs to spend more time in government offices than pouring drinks, with permits for parking, pest control, the playing of music (one each for live or recorded sets) and many others needed before opening time.

 A pub owner here has to go from table to table seeking more than a dozen licences that may take more than a year to obtain, said Kamlesh Barot, secretary of a hotels and restaurants association.

 While only four of the permits have been introduced recently, in the past many licences were more often than not overlooked. But not any more.

 Bar owners say the crackdown is just an excuse for government officials and the police to collect bribes. 

 We dont mind licences but the wait for getting them should not be endless. Files dont move till officers palms are greased, said Jehani Farhang, the director of a south Mumbai pub.

 It is not just the bar owners who are coming under pressure. The police are stepping up patrols outside popular nightspots. We feel like criminals with police keeping a watch outside pubs and nightclubs. They have to stop being a bully, said Sanjay Khadas, a young advertising executive.

 The dance bars are gone. Now they are after the bars to ensure there is no entertainment in Mumbai, said Paritosh Sehgal, a college student.

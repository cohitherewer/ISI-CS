 PC uses China charm

 M.R. VENKATESH

 Chennai, Jan. 9: P. Chidambaram has invoked Beijings economic policies to tell the Left why it should back the Centres reforms process.

 If India is to achieve a growth rate as high as Chinas, while at the same time emulating the northern neighbour in attention to social equality, such support from the Left parties would be crucial, the finance minister said yesterday.

 At a campaign meeting in his South Chennai constituency, Chidambaram told the governments key ally that its objections to the economic reforms were misplaced.

 Although the government and the Left have differences on some issues, on most issues there is consensus, the minister declared.

 There is no quarrel about socialist goals, he said disarmingly. We only have to discuss how to achieve those goals.

 CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury was to attend the meeting but couldnt make it. He was substituted by state CPM leader and central committee member T.K. Rangarajan.

 The Marxist ideologue took a swipe at the Centre for its failure to implement the assurances in the common minimum programme. He cited the recent slash in the allotment of public distribution system (PDS) foodgrain and the hike in their prices for those above the poverty line.

 This had Chidambaram referring to the Chinese model. To achieve Beijings sustained high rate of economic growth, he said, India was ready to do whatever they did (in opening up their economy), follow the policies they adopted in inviting foreign investment and relax all those controls that China had eased over a period of time.

 India is neither in competition with China nor its political rival. There is enough space for both India and China, and so all the Left parties should cooperate with our government to help us achieve those goals, Chidambaram added to Rangarajans obvious discomfiture.

 He said the developed countries had been stunned by Indias economic growth rate of 6.9 per cent ? which was next only to Chinas ? in the six months after the Manmohan Singh government assumed office in May 2004.

 In the current years first half, India has clocked an amazing 8.1 per cent growth rate, he said. I am hopeful we will end this fiscal (2005-06) with a growth rate of 7.5 per cent.

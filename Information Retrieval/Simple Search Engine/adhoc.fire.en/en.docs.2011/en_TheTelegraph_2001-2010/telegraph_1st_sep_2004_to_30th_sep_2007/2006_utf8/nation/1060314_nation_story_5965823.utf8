 RSS clears yatra air, just about

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 13: RSS chief K.S. Sudarshan today clarified that the Sangh would not oppose any initiative that targets minority-appeasement.

 Sudarshans statement was a result of reports that he had a fight in Nagpur with L.K. Advani over his proposed national integration yatra. 

 A section of the media has dragged my name into an unseemly controversy, he said, adding Advani came to Nagpur and had lunch with him. 

 In a press conference, Advani said there is no tension between him and the Sangh. After that, there should be no scope for any speculation, he said.

 About Advanis yatra and the speculation that the Sangh would not mobilise its cadres, Sudarshan said the Sangh would not oppose any political campaign against rampant Muslim-appeasement.

 Two factors were clear in his statement. One, he did not call it Advanis yatra. He stressed on taking Rajnath Singhs name before mentioning Advani.

 Two, Sudarshan refused to admit that the Sangh was supporting this yatra in particular. He made the point that the Sangh was willing to support any move that promotes national integration, the stated purpose of the yatra.

 So far as Rajnath and Advanis yatra is concerned, there is no question of the Sangh actively opposing any move to educate people about the dangers of minorityism. The Sangh would support any venture to promote national integration, he said.

 The Advani camp hailed the RSS chiefs reaction as a testimony of the Sanghs support to his yatra but insiders said it was a mere denial of reports about the alleged fight between the two.

 Sources said Sudarshans statement should be seen as a attempt to convey that the Sangh would not actively oppose the yatra nor would it support it.

 There is a difference between saying there is support for the yatra and a clarification that the Sangh would not oppose the initiative. It would be wrong to interpret it as a sign of the Sangh mobilising the kind of support they did for Ramjanmabhoomi.

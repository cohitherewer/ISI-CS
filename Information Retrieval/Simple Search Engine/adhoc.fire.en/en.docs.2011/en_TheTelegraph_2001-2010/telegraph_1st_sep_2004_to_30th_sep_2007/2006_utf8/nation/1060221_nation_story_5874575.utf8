 Disabled

 New Delhi, Feb. 20 (PTI): Delhi High Court today issued notices to six airlines asking them to explain the special facilities they provide physically-challenged persons and directed the railway ministry to ensure wheelchairs are available at all railway stations.

 A disabilities rights group had filed a PIL that there were no adequate access and special facilities for the disabled in public spaces. The court also ruled that station masters would be held personally liable if they failed to provide wheelchairs.

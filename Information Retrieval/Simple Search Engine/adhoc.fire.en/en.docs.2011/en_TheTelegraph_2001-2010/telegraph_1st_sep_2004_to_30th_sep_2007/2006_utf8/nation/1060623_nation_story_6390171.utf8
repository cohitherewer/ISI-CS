 Real Bush in nuke battle

 K.P. NAYAR 

 Cheney

 Washington, June 22: With only days left for the Indo-US nuclear deal to be marked up for consideration by the Senate and the House of Representatives, the Bush administration today unleashed the most potent weapon in its armoury to muster support here for the landmark initiative.

 Vice-President Dick Cheney, who is often referred to as the real President of the US, delivered the luncheon address at the 31st Anniversary Leadership Summit of the US-India Business Council (USIBC) on the theme, Implementing the US-India Strategic Partnership.

 Addressing the council, Cheney cautioned against any change in the agreement or delay in Washingtons approval.

 Given this agreements strategic importance, we must be sure that amendments or delays on the US side do not risk wasting this critical opportunity, he said, describing the deal as one of the most important strategic foreign policy initiatives of our government.

 This is the very first time that Cheney, the administrations hatchet man for the Bush regimes most challenging and controversial policies from the Iraq war to serving Enron, has been pushed into anything in support of India.

 The USIBC had invited President George W. Bush for todays event, but the White House appears to have concluded that it would be more effective at this juncture to get the Vice-President to signal that the administration was fully committed to the Indo-US partnership and the nuclear deal.

 According to present indications, the House of Representatives International Relations Committee (HIRC) is all set to vote on the deal on Tuesday and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee (SFRC) immediately thereafter.

 If the legislation enabling the implementation of Indo-US civilian nuclear cooperation is passed by the two committees, the full House and Senate are expected to vote on the bill next month.

 There are conflicting signals about the outcome of the vote. Fresh complications arose yesterday after Tom Lantos, a holocaust survivor and the HIRCs senior-most Democrat, asked Delhi to act responsibly and dissociate itself from a statement by non-aligned foreign ministers in Malaysia last month pledging support to Iran against western pressure on its peaceful nuclear project.

 What Cheney said today in support of the deal will, therefore, have major bearing on how conservative senators and representatives who are so far undecided about India will vote on the deal.

 Cheney is president of the Senate and has used his casting vote in the Senate to get over a tie in voting. 

 So far, he has shown scant interest in Indo-US ties in public and has come into the picture only where vested interests, which he ardently champions, have been affected. 

 When L.K. Advani visited Washington during the NDA rule, Cheney talked to him, but not in person. The conversation was conducted by teleconference and focused on a subject of abiding interest to Cheney: the war on terror.

 The only other significant meetings between Cheney and Indian leaders have been with Congress chief Sonia Gandhi in 2001 and with defence minister Pranab Mukherjee last year.

 According to accounts that subsequently became public, the meeting with Sonia was to bail out Enron, which was then in trouble with the Congress-led government in Maharashtra. He took up Enron with Indias external affairs minister a few months later, but the energy giant soon became bankrupt.

 His meeting with Mukherjee last year was ostensibly on behalf of the USs military industrial complex, which wants to sell weapons to India.

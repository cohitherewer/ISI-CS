The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Discovery of India, West Africa-style

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 6: When foreign policy makers decided to focus on bettering ties with West African nations, they did not have a clue what they would be in for.

 A virtual procession of leaders from the region is now headed to India. So much so, that one, the President of Gabon, has already landed up without an invite.

 President El Hadj Omar Bongo Ondimba was on a visit to the UAE, Thailand and China when he suddenly decided to include Delhi in his itinerary.

 For Bongo, it was a spur of the moment decision, but the protocol-conscious foreign ministry found things hard to handle as the Prime Minister was away from Delhi.

 Bongo, the longest-serving African head of state ruling for 35 years, checked in at a five-star hotel on May 3 along with foreign minister Jean Ping, the ministers for commerce and trade and several officials. The team booked over three dozens rooms.

 Although the visit was described as private, the foreign ministry ensured that senior cabinet ministers called on Bongo and also held separate meetings with their counterparts.

 Junior foreign minister Anand Sharma met Jean Ping, who was president of UN General Assembly last year. Commerce minister Kamal Nath was roped in for trade talks. Mines minister Sis Ram Ola also met the team.

 Bongo and his team are flying off tomorrow but they have left a good taste in the foreign ministrys mouth. Gabon, an oil rich country, has backed Indias candidature to the UN Security Council and also decided to open an embassy in Delhi next year.

 India values Gabons support for the Security Council seat as it has come from a Francophile nation, not one of Delhis strongest constituencies.

 Bongos visit paid off in business terms too. India is eyeing Gabons telecom sector and Oil India Limited is in the process of signing a deal to acquire a controlling stake in an oil exploration block in Gabon.

 The Gabon story is just a slice of Indias growing prominence among West African nations. Ministers from Ghana and Nigeria were in Delhi last month as part of the Economic Conglomeration of West African Nations.

 This was followed by the visit of the foreign minister of Congo, a nation where 4,000 Indian troops are deployed in peacekeeping operations.

 Next week, the foreign minister of Angola will be in India. The foreign minister of Ghana will follow on June 9.

 Officials said the development was significant as the West African countries are, for the first time, moving out of the shadow of the west and looking to open up to India and China as potential partners.

 DMK Neyveli stunner

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chennai, July 2: The ruling DMK today stunned its Left allies by scaling down its stand on divestment in the Neyveli Lignite Corporation from outright opposition to a compromise.

 Chief minister M. Karunanidhi has faxed a message to the Prime Minister and the Union finance minister, proposing the shares be sold to the companys employees instead.

 The Centre should ideally reconsider the plan to sell 10 per cent stakes in the public sector undertaking, he said, but if disinvestment cannot be avoided, an employees share ownership option could be the answer.

 The softened stance, coming two days before central and state trade unions begin an indefinite strike at the companys plant, shocked the Left unions. We are opposed to any form of divestment, the Citus A.K. Padmanabhan said. 

 A week ago, Karunanidhi had joined the Left to condemn the divestment plan, and his party and its labour arm have supported the strike.

 Political circles suggest two reasons for the rethink. The Union finance minister, who met the chief ministers son and DMK leader M.K. Stalin at a function last evening, may have conveyed a message from the Centre.

 Also, Karunanidhi is believed to be annoyed that all the unions at Neyveli Lignite, except the DMK workers wing, had together invited his rival Jayalalithaa to inaugurate their agitation, which starts with a fast tomorrow.

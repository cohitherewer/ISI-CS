 Walkout on Left mind

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 16: The Left parties are yet to decide how they will respond to the Prime Ministers reply in the Rajya Sabha tomorrow to a short-duration debate on the Indo-US nuclear agreement. 

 The most likely strategy could be for the parties to walk out of the House if they are not satisfied with the reply. 

 In many ways, it will be a climbdown from what the Left had expected to achieve. CPM general secretary Prakash Karat triggered the debate last month when he circulated a note among all political parties listing objections to the way the nuclear negotiations were being conducted. 

 The Left had expected a resolution or a declaration in Parliament that would bind the government. But in the end, they had to settle for a discussion and a reply from the Prime Minister.

 Indications are that Manmohan Singh will address the concerns raised by the Left about the agreement and how much influence the US bill will have on restructuring it. But the biggest question is: will the Prime Minister lay down the parameters within which the negotiations will take place? 

 The CPM has found nine points of departure in the US draft bill from the Indo-US agreement of July 2005. The Left expects the Prime Minister to put down parameters that will prevent any deflection from the original agreement. 

 On August 4, defence minister Pranab Mukherjee sent a draft of what could be the Prime Ministers reply to the Left parties. It said the Prime Minister would not allow Indias foreign policy to be dictated by any foreign country and listed seven parameters. 

 The Left parties said some of the parameters coincided with theirs.

 CPM politburo member and MP Sitaram Yechury has been in touch with Singh trying to working out a solution that would let both the government and the Left parties breathe easy.

 The two may strike a temporary truce on the nucl- ear issue but the acrimony on foreign policy, particularly the Centres flexibility towards the US, is likely to continue. 

 The Manmohan Singh governments refusal to allow a resolution or a declaration on the nuclear agreement has not gone down well with the Left.

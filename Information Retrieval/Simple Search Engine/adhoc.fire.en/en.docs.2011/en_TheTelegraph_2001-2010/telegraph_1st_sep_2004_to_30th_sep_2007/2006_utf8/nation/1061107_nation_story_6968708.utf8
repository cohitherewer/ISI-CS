 IIT research scholar kills himself

 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY

 Lucknow, Nov. 6: An IIT Kanpur researcher, who had just submitted thesis papers for his chemistry PhD, was found hanging from a ceiling fan in his hostel room today.

 Two bottles of white fluids and a suicide note were found next to the body of G.J. Abhilash, 28, in hostel four of the institute, which has now seen three suicides since November last year.

 I lost interest in life long ago, but waited for my brother to get married on November 3. I believe I am unfit to live in this world any more. No one is responsible for my suicide, Abhilash wrote in his note, which also had his brothers telephone number. This helped the institute authorities contact his family immediately. His father, who works at Bharat Heavy Electricals Hardwar plant, is expected to reach the campus tomorrow.

 Police said Abhilash might have swallowed the chemical before hanging himself. The body has been sent for post-mortem and the chemical bottles which appeared to be imported taken away for tests, R.K. Srivastava, additional superintendent of police, Kanpur, said.

 Unlike the others who committed suicide on the campus in recent months, Abhilash, who hailed from Kerala, was not an engineering student. He came to the institute after his post-graduation in chemistry from IIT Roorkee. 

 He had come here in 2001 for doing his PhD in chemistry. He submitted his thesis papers recently and was supposed to appear for his viva test on November 9, said Prawal Sinha, dean of students affairs at IIT Kanpur.

 Batchmates described Abhilash as a bright student, saying he had recently returned from a research assignment in Germany. It did not look like he was under stress because of academic pressure, Sinha added.

 Authorities were relieved the death had apparently nothing to do with studies. Kripashankar, the deputy director of the IIT, said: It is unfortunate that another suicide has taken place here, whatever may be the reason, personal or academic. A PTI report said the institutes director has convened an emergency meeting of faculty members to discuss the issue.

 A pall of gloom descended today on the campus which, till yesterday, was celebrating Antaral, its annual fest. 

 On May 3, Shailesh Sharma, a final-year chemical engineering student, had ended his life, apparently unable to cope with frustration over poor grades in his last semester.

 Swapnil Chandrakant Dharaskar, who was studying mechanical engineering, flung himself to death from the roof of the administrative block on December 1, 2005. Three other students had died in 1981, 1987 and 1999. 

 A worried IIT Kanpur has been doing its bit to fight the trend. It has started yoga exercises to reduce stress. Last month, it brought in experts from the Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences in nearby Lucknow for workshops where ways to beat tension were shared.

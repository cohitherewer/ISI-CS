 US puppet gets a snub

 Tharoor, Zeid: Mixed 

 fortune 

 New York, Sept. 15: A backdoor attempt by the US to hijack the UN secretary-generals job for one of its client states was roundly rebuffed by the Security Council yesterday in its second straw poll to choose a successor to Kofi Annan.

 Jordans Prince Zeid al Hussein, who is widely believed to have entered the race for the next UN chief at Washingtons prompting, emerged a distant fourth in the secret poll, way behind South Korean foreign minister Ban Ki-moon, Indias Shashi Tharoor and Thailands deputy Prime Minister Surakiart Sathirathai.

 The result of yesterdays straw poll largely mirrored that of an earlier one in July: Ban and Tharoor retained the first and second places. The two men received 14 and 10 positive votes, respectively. Surakiart got nine positive votes.

 The support of at least nine of the 15 members of the Security Council is considered the minimum needed for a candidate to be viable.

 Prince Zeid, who got only six positive votes, is just 42. His only worthwhile diplomatic experience is from his post here as Jordans ambassador to the UN. 

 In that capacity, he runs a tiny mission compared to many other member states of the UN. But he is one of the sons of the late King Hussein, who was one of Washingtons allies in West Asia.

 The US attempt, according to multiple sources at the UN, was to push Zeids candidature as a moderate Muslim and a role model for young Muslims worldwide at a time when they are increasingly turning towards religious extremism.

 With Zeid as puppet secretary-general, lacking in experience, the US plan, it is said, was to lobby on behalf of another of its client states, preferably from Eastern Europe, for the deputy secretary-generals post. 

 That deputy would be a heavyweight, such as Polands former President Alexander Kwasniewski, Slovakias former foreign minister Eduard Kukan or Latvias womanPresident Vaira Vike-Freiberga. All three have the capacity to be Washingtons factotums, judging by their records in office.

 Privately, US diplomats at the UN have been saying a strong deputy with rich experience could make up for any shortcomings in a secretary-general.

 Publicly, the US has not declared its support for any candidate. President George W. Bush and his envoy to the UN, John Bolton, have expressed differing views on Asias right to have a next UN chief.

 But after Zeids dismal showing in yesterdays straw poll, Bolton told some US reporters: I think there is still plenty of time for new candidates to come in. We want to be sure we have had the advantage for the full range of possibilities.

 Speculation here centres around the one negative vote that was cast yesterday against the South Korean candidate. If that vote came from a veto-wielding permanent member of the Security Council, Bans candidature will be sunk.

 Tharoor got three negative votes while two council members expressed no opinion.

 Another candidate, Sri Lankas Jayanta Dhanapala, got only three positive votes.

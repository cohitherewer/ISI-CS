 Delhi quick with stamp of approval

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New 

 Delhi, April 21: India today put its stamp of approval 

 on King Gyanendras intention to transfer executive 

 power to a government constituted by a seven-party alliance, 

 saying the move will pave the way for restoring political 

 stability in Nepal.

 This action by His Majesty the King of Nepal, who has reaffirmed his commitment to multi-party democracy and constitutional monarchy, should now pave the way for the restoration of political stability and economic recovery of the country, a statement said. 

 Delhis reaction reaffirms its support for the two-pillar theory that hinges on co-existence of constitutional monarchy and multi-party democracy.

 Welcoming Gyanendras move, India also commended the people of Nepal for carrying out the pro-democracy struggle. They deserve our respect and admiration. We sincerely hope that the aspirations of the people of Nepal can now be addressed by enabling them to enjoy their rights through democratic electoral exercise, free from the threat of violence.

 Delhi said it stood by the people of Nepal in their hour of need and offered to help the country achieve political stability and economic recovery at the earliest.

 India was waiting for Gyanendras reconciliatory move after special envoy Karan Singh met him yesterday and handed over a blunt message from the Prime Minister to restore democracy. 

 He gave the king a letter from Manmohan Singh asking him to transfer power to political parties in a manner acceptable to the people. Gyanendra was told to let the parties decide whether or not there should be a constituent assembly, and that the control of army should be with the political executive.

 Karan Singh welcomed his statement today and said political parties in Nepal should accept it and work out the details later. He brushed aside speculation that the king might seek asylum in a third country, saying the matter has not reached such a point.

 The special envoy had briefed Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in the presence of national security adviser M.K. Narayanan and foreign secretary Shyam Saran on the situation in Kathmandu. He also apprised Congress president Sonia Gandhi about his Nepal mission.

 The kings announcement came hours after India said the situation in Nepal was fast deteriorating and the country was on the brink of anarchy.

 Star secretary in the dock for faking phone calls from don

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Priyanka: Sigh of relief

 Indore, June 4: Actress Priyanka Chopras former secretary Prakash Jaju seems to have run out of luck. A Mumbai police team is camping in Indore to arrest him for faking phone calls he had claimed had come from underworld don Chota Shakeel allegedly threatening him on Priyankas behalf.

 Jaju, a compulsive name-dropper, suffered a second setback when another actress, Celina Jaitley, announced she was parting ways with him. 

 In a text message sent to her contacts, she said: This is Celina Jaitley, informing all my friends and colleagues that I have parted amicably with my manager Prakash Jaju on mutual decision.

 She goes on to say: I would like all of you to kindly contact me directly as I am currently managing my own business. Any deals, monetary or date-wise, made with anyone but me I will not be responsible for. 

 Celina cited no reason for the break-up.

 Last week, Jaju had filed an FIR at a police station in Mhow, some 40 km from Indore, alleging that Chota Shakeel, Priyanka and her father Ashok Chopra had threatened to kill him. He had claimed Shakeel made the threat over phone from Dubai. A Mumbai police team member contradicted the claim. 

 On May 30, a sessions court in Mumbai rejected Jajus plea for anticipatory bail on a complaint by the actresss father that the former secretary was threatening them over a dispute over his fees. 

 Chopras statement said Priyanka had dismissed Jaju in 2002. No transaction is pending, but Jaju would send vulgar SMSes to Priyankas mobile phone and even call her home number. As Jajus demands met with no response from the Chopras, his calls became more frequent. The family feared danger and complained to the police. 

 Adarsh Katiyar, the Indore superintendent of police, confirmed the presence of a Mumbai police team in the city to arrest Jaju. He (Jaju) is wanted for allegedly sending vulgar messages to the actress and some other irregularities, Katiyar said.

 He said Jaju had a running feud with Priyanka over money. A few days ago, her father called up Jaju and warned him not to contact her for money, Katiyar said. 

 Before going underground, Jaju had accused Priyanka of owing him Rs 1.37 crore. He told Indore police that he received three phone calls in which the last caller said he was Chota Shakeel and warned that he should stay away from Priyanka. He had also alleged that a top Samajwadi Party leader, known for his proximity to Bollywood, had threatened him, too.

 In Indore and Mhow, to which he belongs, there are conflicting reports about Jaju. A number of people view him with suspicion as Jaju has a habit of referring to Anil Ambani, Madhuri Dixit, Sridevi, Hema Malini, Jackie Shroff and Celina Jaitely as his business partners. 

 According to Jaju, a month after winning the Miss World 2000 title, Priyanka signed an agreement which entailed payment of 10 per cent of the amount signed for every movie, stage show or advertisement. 

 He claimed it was he who got her entry into Bollywood with movies like Hero, Andaaz, Kismat, Asambhav, Blackmail and Mujhse Shaadi Karogi, besides getting her work in over 50 stage shows and many advertisements. 

 Jaju said Priyanka received the assignment for the Shah Rukh Khan-led Temptation World Tour in 2004. But soon after going on tour, she sent out an SMS to her acquaintances that Jaju would no longer be working for her. 

 Now she is refusing to give me my dues, he had said. 

 Priyanka was unavailable for comment as she was busy with the shooting of Don in Malaysia, her lawyer said.

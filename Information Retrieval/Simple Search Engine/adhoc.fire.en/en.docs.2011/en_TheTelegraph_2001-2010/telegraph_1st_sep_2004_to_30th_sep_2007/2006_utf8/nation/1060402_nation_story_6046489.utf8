 Tyre burst scare grounds A-I flight

 Mumbai (PTI): An Air-India flight on the Delhi-Frankfurt-Los Angeles route made a precautionary landing here on Saturday following a suspected tyre burst during take-off from Delhi, airport sources said.

 But an Air-India spokesman denied the tyre burst and said A-I 137 was diverted to Mumbai as rubber pieces were found at Delhi airport after it took off.

 The aircraft landed safely at the international airport at 1.45 pm. All the 284 passengers and 20 crew members on board are safe.

 The aircraft will depart on Saturday night for its destination, the spokesman said.

 Tonsure on adultery charge

 Tiruchirapalli (PTI): Five members of a Muslim jamad have been arrested for allegedly ordering a 55-year-old woman to be tonsured in Perambalur district of Tamil Nadu on the suspicion that she had allowed her daughter to commit adultery.

 Police said one Zahir Hussain divorced the womans 25-year-old daughter, suspecting her fidelity, and she had been living with her mother ever since.

 He filed a complaint with the jamad early this year, alleging that his former wife was committing adultery. After an inquiry, the jamad fined the mother Rs 5,000 for encouraging her daughter. The woman paid the fine.

 Hussain filed a second complaint against his former mother-in-law accusing her of allowing her daughter to commit adultery, for which the tonsuring was ordered.

 Sarabjit plea

 The petition, which says Sarabjit was wrongly implicated, was sent last week by post.

 War-wary Lanka taps India for help

 - Rajapakse wants neighbour to use its capability to bring Tigers to talks table

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 Mahinda Rajapakse President, Sri Lanka

 Colombo, July 24: Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapakse wants India to use all its capability to bring LTTE chief Velupillai Prabhakaran to the negotiating table because war is the last thing his country needs.

 While Rajapakse would not say it in as many words, sources close to him said a full-blown war with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam would affect Indias southern states ? both politically and in terms of the cost of coping with more refugee influx into Tamil Nadu.

 At a meeting with a delegation of women journalists from India at Temple Trees, the Presidents sea-facing residence, Rajapakse said Delhi and political parties in Tamil Nadu could help his government find a solution to the conflict.

 The Lankan President ? grappling with fresh LTTE offensives after the 2002 ceasefire accord virtually collapsed ? made it clear that Indias engagement, whether direct or covert, would have to take in the Tigers, notwithstanding his perception that it was a terrorist organisation and did not believe in democracy.

For him, apparently, the bottomline was that the LTTE was very powerful in the north and the east and, therefore, we have to be practical. 

 I have enough faith I can do it (resolve the conflict). We are ready to talk to the LTTE, ready to work with them. Prabhakaran is Sri Lankan, not an outsider, Rajapakse said. 

 India is our neighbour. They have all the capability to persuade Prabhakaran and bring him to the negotiating table. I do not want a war, I do not want to go to war. Look at the war in Lebanon. The world is silent about the whole thing. But if I started a war (against the LTTE), a lot of people can say..., he trailed off.

 However, Rajapakse would not elaborate on his expectations from India. The sources said ideally he would like India to be the principal facilitator in resolving the conflict with the Tamils instead of Norway because the Lankan establishment feels Oslo is more sympathetic to the cause of the Tigers. 

 But, the sources added, that might not happen because we dont think the Indian government will get directly involved.

 Asked how hopeful he was of bringing Prabhakaran around, Rajapakse said they were talking about a man who will not understand democracy. It is very difficult to persuade him. No one can meet him. Can you negotiate with them?

 While not underestimating the power of the LTTE, the President, in reply to a question, stressed that Prabhakaran did not represent the Tamil aspirations.

 How many Tamil leaders were killed from A. Amrithalingam (of the Tamil United Liberation Front) onwards? The man who came to help them, your late Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, was killed. He was not a Sri Lankan.

 He went on to say: All Tamils are not LTTE. Most Tamils are in Colombo, 39 per cent of the population in Colombo is Tamil, its deputy mayor is Tamil. When there is a problem (in the north-east), they all come to Colombo.

 This, Rajapakse said, was just what the LTTE desired. It is organising them to go out of there. We have our own refugee camps, too. 

 Although he did not go into the specifics of the road map he had before him, the President made two things clear: despite the LTTEs threats and refusal, he would speak to other Tamil outfits and whatever model of polity was evolved would be a Sri Lankan one.

 I have appointed a committee of specialists. I have asked them to study the Indian models and other models, too. We must have a Sri Lankan model. This is a small island. So whatever solution is found, everybody must be able to accept it, whether they are Tamils, Sinhalas or Muslims, Rajapakse said.

 He added that he had invited all Lankan parties for a round-table conference in the hope that it would yield one or two proposals. 

 Those will be put before the LTTE. I want their views, Rajapakse said.

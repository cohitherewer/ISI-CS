 Gogois good luck

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Guwahati, May 11: A road that had appeared bumpy suddenly looks smooth for Assam chief minister Tarun Gogoi.

 After being almost written off, Gogoi is now poised to retain the hot seat with the Congresss 53 seats making it the single largest party in a House of 126, the support of at least 12 Bodo legislators assured and challenger Bhubaneswar Kalita out of the way.

 Although AICC leader Digvijay Singh said the next chief minister would be chosen only at the Congress Legislature Party meeting on Saturday and Gogoi promised to happily shoulder any responsibility given to him, there was little to indicate that someone other than the incumbent would make the cut.

 Singh and his AICC colleague Chandan Bagchi, who arrived in Guwahati just after Gogois resounding victory in Titabor was confirmed, drove straight to the chief ministers hilltop residence instead of dropping by at the party headquarters, Rajiv Bhawan. Congratulatory calls from Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Congress president Sonia Gandhi came in by 2 pm.

 Among the other callers were MP Mani Kumar Subba and Robin Bordoloi, neither of them known to be particularly fond of him.

 A beaming Gogoi said he always knew that the Congress would beat the anti-incumbency factor. 

 I have never hankered after any post and will do whatever is asked of me. More than the chief ministership, I am excited about our party returning to power despite predictions to the contrary, he said. 

 It is a vote for continuity, development and sincerity. I always knew we were on course. I have full faith in the people. 

 Kalita, the state Congress chief who lost in Rangia, said he had taken his defeat sportingly, but ruled out stepping down from his post.

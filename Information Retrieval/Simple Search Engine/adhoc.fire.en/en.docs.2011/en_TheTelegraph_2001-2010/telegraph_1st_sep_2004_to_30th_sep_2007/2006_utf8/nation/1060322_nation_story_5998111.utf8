 Mukherjee: Counter-attack

 New Delhi, March 21: Defence minister Pranab Mukherjee today fired a point-by-point rebuttal to the NDAs allegations on the Scorpene submarine deal.

 Making a suo motu statement in the Lok Sabha, Mukherjee dismissed the Oppositions allegations as completely contrary to facts and lauded his government for bringing down the price of the submarines. 

 The UPA regime re-negotiated the contract that was finalised in the NDAs tenure and brought down the price by Rs 313 crore, he said. 

 No extra Rs 4,500 crore was paid as alleged by NDA leaders, he claimed. On the contrary, after the present government came to power, it re-examined the project even though all the negotiations had been completed in 2002 and the ministry of finance had accorded approval to the project in 2003. 

 He said the contract with French firms Armaris and MBDA was worth Rs 7,197 crore. There was an additional agreement with Amazon Docks Limited ? where the submarines will be made indigenously ? and this would cost Rs 5,888 crore. 

 The total cost then comes to Rs 13,085 crore and not Rs 16,000 crore as claimed by the NDA leaders, the minister pointed out. He said the government had sanctioned Rs 18,798 crore but the deal was clinched at much less. 

 Mukherjee said the contracts had in-built mechanisms to check corruption through the integrity pacts. 

 He said the stringent safeguards meant cancellation of the contract, recovery of all advances, non-payment of dues to make recoveries, imposition of liquidated damages and the recovery of all the money paid to any agent.

 He said the French government also took the Indian side into confidence on the corruption aspect and assured that it was a signatory to Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development convention on combating bribery of foreign officials in international transactions.

 The minister denied that the navy war room leak case was linked to the Scorpene deal, but admitted that information of commercial value was leaked. Three officers have been dismissed from the service.

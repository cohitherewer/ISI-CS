 Techies detained near border

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Agartala, July 13: Tripura police tonight detained 11 youths from Maharashtra, one of them a former Microsoft employee who was based in the US until the 9/11 terror attacks, for suspected fundamentalist activities in villages along the Indo-Bangladesh border.

 Superintendent of police Arindam Nath said the group identified themselves as members of the conservative Tablighi Jamaat and claimed to be in Agartala to preach Islam. We are interrogating them and, given their background and inconsistencies in their statements, something startling might emerge. We will contact the Maharashtra police to verify our findings. 

 Director-general of police G.M. Srivastava went to Ambassa, the headquarters of Dhalai district where the youths were detained.

 The youths identified themselves as Mohammed Sheikh, Mohammed Wazid, Mohammed Irfan, Harun Rashid, Zafar Khan, Atif, Ashiq, Afzal, Junej, Jaieed and Zahir. 

 Nath said Sheikh, a resident of Thane and a graduate in pharmacology, had migrated to the US several years ago, earned a computer engineering degree from Houston University in Texas and found a job with Microsoft. He quit sometime later to float his own company, Nucleus Technology, in Washington. 

 Sheikh told us that he returned to India immediately after the al Qaida attacks and joined Microsoft again in Hyderabad. He left the company again in March to become a member of the Darul Falas Maszid in Thane, the police officer said.

 Two of the other youths in detention ? Harun and Zafar ? are NRI engineers. Harun is based in Dubai and Zafar Khan in Qatar, Nath said.

 The police officer said the group reached Agartala on June 23 and stayed at the Ramnagar mosque, in the western part of the capital town, for three days. They then fanned out into the minorities-dominated areas bordering Bangladesh. They were spotted indulging in suspicious activities along the border. A police team found them in Malaya village, Nath said.

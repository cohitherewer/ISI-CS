 Constitution bench to decide quota ceiling fate

 Petition poser 

 New Delhi, Aug. 30: Can a law extending the ceiling on reservation beyond 50 per cent be inserted in the Ninth Schedule of the Constitution to bar scrutiny by courts?

 Confronted with the question, a Supreme Court bench headed by Chief Justice Y.K. Sabharwal today ordered setting up of a nine-judge Constitution bench.

 The bench will decide whether Parliament was competent to place a law circumventing judicial verdicts in the Ninth Schedule of the Constitution to ensure that it is not cancelled by the courts.

 Article 31B of the Constitution provides that no act or regulation specified in the Ninth Schedule shall be deemed to be void on the ground that such act or regulation was inconsistent with or takes away or abridges any of the fundamental rights guaranteed in the Constitution.

 Justice Sabharwal said the Constitution bench, which would hear the matter in the second week of October, would first determine the power of Parliament to take away the scope of judicial review of a legislation by placing it in the Ninth Schedule.

 The court was hearing a batch of petitions challenging the validity of laws, including a Tamil Nadu legislation providing for a reservation of 69 per cent, inserted in the Ninth Schedule.

 The law enacted by the Tamil Nadu government, extending reservation beyond the 50 per cent ceiling fixed by the Supreme Court in the Mandal Commission case, was placed in the Ninth Schedule by Parliament in 1994. 

 A petition challenging the validity of the law and the subsequent inclusion in the Ninth Schedule was filed in the Supreme Court in 2001.

 Besides this, the apex court was seized of several similar petitions questioning the right of Parliament to bar judicial review by courts, which is a basic feature of the Constitution. 

 The petitions have also challenged the power of Parliament to insert laws struck down by the courts in the Ninth Schedule. It has been contended that an act struck down by the courts could not be validly inserted into the Ninth Schedule.

 The batch of petitions to be taken up by the bench also includes a writ challenging the insertion of the West Bengal Land Holding Revenue Act 1979 in the Ninth Schedule. The enactment was inserted in the Ninth Schedule by Parliament after it was dismissed as unconstitutional by Calcutta High Court and the Supreme Court.

 The need for the Constitution bench was felt by a five-judge bench while hearing the matter in 1999. The bench had referred the matter to the Chief Justice because it felt a larger bench was needed to reconcile the inconsistencies in the Waman Rao case and the Maharao Sahib Sri Bhim Singh Ji case judgments.

 To expedite the matter, the Chief Justice today directed all parties to the petitions to file their submissions by September 27. The nine-judge bench would hear the matter for five days from October 9 to October 13.

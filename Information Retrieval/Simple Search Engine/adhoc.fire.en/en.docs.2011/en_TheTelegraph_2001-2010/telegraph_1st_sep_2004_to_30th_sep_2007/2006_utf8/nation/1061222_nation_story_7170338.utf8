 Singh plays Santa for Bengal

 Singh: PSU goodies

 New Delhi, Dec. 21: Three days after the cabinet hit the fast lane on privatisation with decisions to sell the governments residual shares in Maruti and clearances for FDI worth Rs 65 crore, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is expected to sing a different tune when he visits Bengal on Sunday. And it may just be music to the CPMs ears.

 Singh, who will reach Calcutta on Saturday night, will fly by a helicopter to Burnpur the next morning, after flagging off the platinum jubilee celebrations of the Indian Statistical Institute. In Burnpur, he will lay the foundation stone of the Rs 9,600-crore modernisation of Indian Iron and Steel Company (IISCO), integrated into Steel Authority of India (SAIL) in 2004.

 Official sources said Singh will focus on the revival of public sector units and its importance for industrial growth. 

 The expansion project is a major gesture from the Centre to Bengal because the Burnpur plant was about to close down, said a source. When steel minister Ram Vilas Paswan announced that there would be no dearth of funds to resuscitate the 130-year-old plant, it was seen as a major victory for the Left Front government. IISCO has now become SAILs fifth integrated plant.

 In Burnpur, Singh could list the gains for Bengal from the UPA government. One of them came its way today, when the cabinet committee on economic affairs approved a revival package for Bengal Chemicals and Pharmaceuticals.

 Official sources were tight-lipped on whether the Prime Minister would refer to land acquisition in his speech especially in the context of Singur. A Congress source involved with the partys affairs in Bengal said he was unlikely to get entangled in a political controversy. 

 Singh will be sharing the dais in Burnpur with chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee to whom the Prime Minister so far been sympathetic. 

 Asked to comment on Singur while returning from Tokyo, the Prime Minister had told journalists that more investments were needed to create jobs. It goes without saying that anything which comes in the way of maintaining industrial peace constitutes a setback, he had said.

 Pranab Mukherjee and Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, who will accompany Singh, could respond to Singur. 

 A cogent political response is expected to be worked out at the Congresss core committee meeting on Friday. So far, we are in a bind because the Left supports the Centre but the Congress cant afford to burn its bridges with Mamata either, said a party functionary. Singh and Sonia Gandhi will attend the meeting.

 Terror missile at Dhaka

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Dhaka, April 20: India is concerned that Bangladesh is allowing itself to be manipulated in a way which is detrimental to India, minister of state for commerce Jairam Ramesh said in Dhaka today.

 Ramesh is in Bangladesh to attend the first ministerial council meeting of the South Asian Free Trade Agreement.

 There is a genuine concern in India that the secular, liberal and democratic foundations of Bangladesh are being eroded, Ramesh told Dhaka-based reporters working for the Indian media. 

 He said a popular impression in India is that Bangladeshi territory is being used and some Bangladeshi citizens are working to create problems in India. Many Indians believe that Pakistani terrorists are using Bangladesh to harm India, he added.

 Ramesh said fundamentalism would help neither Bangladesh nor India. Fundamentalism is alien to South Asia.

 The minister said India is keen on investment in Bangladesh to help it boost its economy and create new jobs. 

 The Tata groups plan to invest $2.5 billion in gas, power and fertiliser in Bangladesh should be seen as a good beginning, Ramesh said.

 India wants Bangladesh to appreciate the merit of the Tatas proposal, he added. The future of Indian investment would largely depend on the fate of the proposal, the minister said.

 Ramesh said India has decided to import eight million garments from Bangladesh each year. The exports are expected to generate revenue of $64 million for Bangladesh that will help reduce the huge trade imbalance between the two countries.

 India will also invest $200 million over the next few years to upgrade its land ports on the border with Bangladesh to facilitate trading. We are interested not only in trade, but also in investment in Bangladesh, Ramesh said.

 School killer gets life term

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 15: The Supreme Court today upheld the conviction of an alleged CPM activist who, along with other party workers, had killed a school teacher in a classroom on December 1, 1999.

 A bench headed by Justice S.B. Sinha, however, reduced the death sentence awarded to A. Pradeepan to life imprisonment. 

 The court acquitted four of his alleged accomplices who had also been sentenced to death by the trial court and Kerala High Court. 

 The high court, in July 2005, had confirmed the death sentence awarded to the five for killing Bhartiya Yuva Morcha leader K.P. Jayakrishnan in the classroom at East Mokeri in Kannur district. 

 Jayakrishnan was murdered around 10.40 in the morning in front of Class VI students. He was chased and hit with rods, an axe and a chopping knife. 

 Before entering the classroom, the assailants overpowered Jayakrishnans bodyguard, sitting at the school gates, by pouring poisonous liquid into his eyes and mouth, and snatched his pistol. 

 After killing the teacher, the assailants wrote a warning on the blackboard of Class VA, threatening witnesses with dire consequences if they deposed against them. The murder was the result of political rivalry.

 The FIR was registered only after police, who received an anonymous telephone call, took a teacher to the police station to record his statement. 

 With witnesses, including the teacher who registered the FIR, turning hostile, the prosecution relied on children aged between seven and 11 as the main eyewitnesses. 

 The court noted that out of about 40 students, four who deposed were traumatised and could not go back to the school. Some lost valuable time in getting admission to another school and settling down. 

 But with witnesses failing to identify the assailants, the court gave them the benefit of doubt and acquitted four. It upheld Pradeepans guilt but asserted that the case cannot be said to be a rarest of rare case warranting imposition of the extreme punishment.

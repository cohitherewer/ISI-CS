 Ranchi, April 21: A remote village in one of the Naxalite-affected districts in Jharkhand will host a high-profile visitor next week.

 The principal secretary to the Prime Minister, T.K.A. Nair, will spend a night at an undisclosed destination, confirmed officials in Ranchi and New Delhi.

 Nair would be flown by helicopter to a remote area to enable him to collect feedback directly from the people and make an on-the-spot assessment of the situation. The suggestion that he should not confine his visit to the state to just meetings with officials, it is learnt, came from Manmohan Singh himself.

 The Prime Minister has described the Naxalite threat as the gravest since Independence. Sources said he is keen to find a solution to the problem, which has assumed enormous proportions in at least six states, including Jharkhand.

 Jharkhand home minister Sudesh Mahto has, in recent months, tried to do something similar and spent a couple of nights in remote villages and also engaged in a game or two of football with local youths.

 The exercise, however, was dismissed then as a political gimmick by detractors who questioned how the heavily-guarded minister, provided with all comforts in the tent, could possibly inspire confidence among the people.

 Nairs plan has also sparked off a certain degree of cynicism among police officials here, who believe the state government would spare no effort to ensure both security and comfort for the visitor.

 Nair, according to officials, will reach Ranchi on April 24. He will hold consultations with the chief minister, his Cabinet colleagues and state government officials. Later, he would be flown to the village.

 As many as 18 of Jharkhands 22 districts have been declared Naxalite-hit. Police have virtually stopped moving out after dusk, allowing the rebels to move freely. Civil officials in many of these districts have abdicated their posts and development projects have come to a standstill with contractors abandoning the jobs.

 The exact destination of Nair would be kept a closely-guarded secret, said officials. The final selection will be made as late as possible from a list drawn up by the state home department. While several places will be sanitised and made ready for the visit, the exact destination will be kept secret from even district officials till the last moment.

 The officer will have an opportunity to speak to people and see first-hand the efforts being made by security personnel to win over the peoples confidence.

 Naxalite violence has seen a spurt in recent months with the rebels looting an armoury in Giridih and detaining a passenger train overnight in Latehar. The government yesterday announced a surrender policy for the rebels, hours after which they blew up the ancestral house of water resources minister Kamlesh Singh in Palamau.

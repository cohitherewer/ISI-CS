 Minority turf tussle

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 22: A full-blown battle may not have begun yet, but there is simmering tension over who would get control of minority education.

 Human resource development minister, who has been keen to hold on to the minority reins, now has a contender in A.R. Antulay, a recent entrant to the cabinet for whom the government has especially created a new ministry of minority affairs.

 With a wide-ranging brief ? all matters relating to minority communities except those relating to law and order ? the ministry heavily impinges on the territory of the social justice ministry, which was dealing with issues like the minority commission.

 The minority ministry will look after socio-economic, cultural and educational matters relating to minorities ? issues related to minority educational institutions and organisations, including the Maulana Azad Educational Foundation. It will also be in charge of the Central Wakf Council.

 Singh has not asserted his claim over minority education yet, but a tussle, according to insiders, is inevitable as the HRD minister wants to retain control of the National Commission for Minority Education and Aligarh Muslim University.

 Officials say both the commission and the university should logically stay with the HRD ministry. However, the minority ministry would be unwilling to let go of the high-power education panel. The cabinet had recently passed an ordinance to empower the commission to set parameters for defining a minority institution.

 The minority ministry also puts a question mark over madarsas. Last July, Singh had unveiled a plan for the modernisation of madarsas at a national conference of minority educational institutions.

 HC leash on song licence fee

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 10: Delhi High Court today restrained Phonographic Performance Ltd (PPL) from collecting more than 15 per cent special licence fees for public entertainment at hotels and restaurants.

 The PPL is one of the societies empowered under the Copyright Act 1957 to charge fees for playing music.

 The interim order comes just ahead of Valentines Day, when most restaurants are expected to be packed with people.

 A bench headed by Justice Mukul Mudgal gave the ruling after hearing a petition filed by the National Restaurants Association of India and others, who have challenged the authority of such societies to fix their own rates.

 The petitioners challenged the constitutional validity of Section 34 of the Copyright Act, which gives complete freedom to societies registered under the act to decide licence fee rates.

 The Copyright Board, too, is not empowered to judge whether the fees are reasonable, the petition pointed out.

 Taking advantage of the provision ? which came after an amendment in 1994 ? the PPL and the Indian Performing Rights Society (IPRS) gradually started increasing rates and now they have reached unreasonable levels, they alleged.

 Restaurant and hotel owners allege that they were being charged twice by the two societies. While the IPRS sought fees for copyright of the songs lyrics, they had to pay the PPL for copyright of their recording.

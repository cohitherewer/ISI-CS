 Dead man meets family awaiting body

 OUR BUREAU

 Ashraf: Homes best

 Thiruvananthapuram/ Lucknow, Aug. 18: Mohammad Ashraf, 36, returned home to Kerala yesterday after nine months in Saudi Arabia to find his wife and five children waiting for his body.

 They wept with joy to see him. I didnt know my children were awaiting my body. Its terrific to realise that one isnt dead, he said.

 Ashraf, who had been in and out of Saudi Arabia for the past 11 years doing odd jobs like selling mineral water, was caught without proper travel papers and put behind bars for a week before the Saudi authorities deported him on the first available flight home. 

 Arriving in Lucknow on Sunday by the Jeddah-Delhi-Lucknow Air-India flight, Ashraf called up friends in Saudi Arabia to say he had reached safely. 

 But he could not call his wife at Malappuram, about 200 km from Kochi, because the cell phone stopped working and he had no money.

 After a day in Lucknow, Ashraf boarded a train for Chennai, from where he took the Thiruvananthapuram Mail to Palakkad and then a bus to reach home around 5.30 am, 45 minutes before the body arrived.

 Even as Ashraf was making his way to the station in Lucknow, his family had been informed of his death. Ashraf has been found dead at Lucknow airport and arrangements are being made to send the body, they were told.

 The family called up a cousin, who is a Central Industrial Security Force jawan in New Delhi, to confirm the news. 

 He got in touch with officials at Lucknow airport and was told the body had been identified from the out-pass.

 Ashraf had lost his wallet and the pass at the airport. 

 They must have found it near the body of the other person and surmised its me, he said, trying to work out the mix-up.

 Now, airport officials are trying to figure out the identity of the dead man. The body was taken back to Lucknow today and a team of senior Air-India officials from Delhi also reached the city to start an inquiry. 

 The man whose body was sent would be about 50 years old. He is of dark complexion and sick looking. He appeared to be from any of the southern states, said P.K. Gupta, the immigration in-charge at Lucknow airport. 

 He said 100 people had arrived on that flight from Jeddah. 

 The police and airport authorities are passing the buck to each other. Airport director Ravi Prakash said it is the business of the police to find out who this man is. 

 On the other hand, B.B. Tiwari, station in-charge of the Sarojininagar police station that had got the post-mortem done, said: The body is lying with the airport authorities. It is their duty to identify it. After identification, if they hand it over, we will dispose of the body.

 Ashraf has learnt his lesson. No more to Gulf, he said. When I lost my wallet, I made up my mind that I shall never leave Kerala. Now, Ive an extra reason not to.

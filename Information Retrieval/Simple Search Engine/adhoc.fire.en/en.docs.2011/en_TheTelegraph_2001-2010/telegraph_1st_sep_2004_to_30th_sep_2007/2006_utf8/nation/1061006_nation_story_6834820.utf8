 Homeless, a year after quake

 - Bracing for another winter in a tin shed

 Jabdi (Near LoC in Uri), Oct. 5: Before the earthquake ripped through Kashmir last October, Maulvi Mohammad Sayeed had been looking for a match for his daughter Shaheena.

 A year on, he is seeking treatment for the 22-year-old who lost her mental balance after the temblor claimed her mother, two sisters, a brother and grandparents.

 The death of her mother proved too much for her, sobs Sayeed, who is an imam at the local mosque. We even took her to the psychiatric hospital at Srinagar but she did not recover.

 Sixteen other relatives were killed when the roof of their house one of the few two-storey houses in this village of 184 families about 118 km from Srinagar caved in. The family, among the worst hit, now lives in a two-room tin shed.

 The quake on October 8, 2005, killed 940 people and damaged around 27,000 houses in Uri and Tanghdar, near the Line of Control. 

 On that morning, Sayeeds father Muzammil Hussain, also an imam, was gravely ill. We were planning to take him to the hospital. Our relatives had assembled to enquire about his health, recalls his brother Nayeem. Suddenly, the earth beneath us shook and the house collapsed. There were only a few survivors. 

 Shaheena, one of the few survivors, wanders around aimlessly. The two-storey house the family of imams even Nayeem is one lived in lies in ruins, just like the homes of their neighbours.

 Despite government assistance, the reconstruction of quake-ravaged Uri and Tanghdar seems a long way off. 

 We have already distributed Rs 400 crore in cash for reconstruction of houses and in compensation to the families of the dead and the injured, Kashmirs divisional commissioner Basharat Ahmad Dhar says. In the second instalment, we are giving Rs 138 crore and we have already released it in 8,000 cases.

 In the first instalment, a family whose house was completely damaged got Rs 40,000. Another Rs 60,000 is being given after construction of the plinth. We believe that the work has progressed well, so we have decided to release the remaining amount, Dhar says.

 Like every family here, Sayeeds family also got its share of the relief. 

 The government gave us Rs 40,000 for reconstructing our house but since we lived in a joint family, I had to share the amount with my brother, he says. This amount is insufficient to construct a shed, let alone a house. 

 Building a house is a luxury few can afford. In Jabdi village, only three houses are coming up. One of them belongs to a National Conference leader, Qazi Mohammad Sheikh. 

 Because of the long distance and treacherous road, the supplies come at a very high cost. We get a truckload of sand for Rs 8,000 against the Rs 2,000 in Baramulla town. A cement bag costs Rs 350 and 3,000 bricks cost Rs 14,000, Nazir Ahmad, who is supervising the work on Sheikhs house, says. It has already cost us Rs 3.5 lakh and will cost another Rs 7 lakh to complete one floor. 

 That is more money than most people here can spare. So they are bracing to spend a second winter in tin sheds. 

 Sara Begum, of Sultan Deki village, is one such. Eight of my family are huddled in a two-room shed. This has compromised our privacy, she says. Many of us have constructed the plinths but since the second instalment (Rs 60,000) is yet to be paid, we raised our tin sheds on the plinth.

 Mohammad Hussain, another resident, says the people living in kothars (mud sheds with timber roofs) were the only beneficiaries. They have moved from kothars to tin sheds, which are better. But those with concrete houses are on the roads.

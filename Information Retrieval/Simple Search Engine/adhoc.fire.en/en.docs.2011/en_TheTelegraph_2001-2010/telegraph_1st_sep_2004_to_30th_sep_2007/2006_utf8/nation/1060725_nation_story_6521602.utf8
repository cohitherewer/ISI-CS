 Bangla hope for stalled talks

 New Delhi, July 24 (Reuters): Indian and Pakistani officials plan to hold discussions in Bangladesh next week, the first meeting between the two sides after New Delhi put off peace talks over the Mumbai blasts, an Indian official said today.

 The talks between foreign secretary Shyam Saran and his Pakistani counterpart Riaz Mohammad Khan ? bureaucrats who head the respective foreign ministries ? would be held on the sidelines of a South Asian conference, the foreign ministry official said.

 The talks between the bureaucrats were expected to be followed by a meeting between the Pakistan foreign minister and Indias junior foreign minister, he said. The meetings are expected between July 31 and August 2.

 Its a good opportunity for the two sides to meet without it looking like formal talks, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. It will allow us to press Pakistan to live up to the commitments it has made to end terrorism.

 New Delhi put off talks between Saran and Khan, due last week, after suspicion over the July 11 Mumbai train bombings fell on Islamist militants based in Pakistan.

 Pakistan foreign ministry spokeswoman Tasnim Aslam said although no meeting in Dhaka between the two foreign secretaries had been scheduled yet, talks were expected. 

 If the foreign secretaries of both countries are there, they would naturally be interacting, Aslam said. 

 Asked if there was contact between the two countries to resume the dialogue, she said: We have said that the peace process between Pakistan and India is in the interest of both countries ... it is in the interest of this entire region and the world at large and we are committed to the peace process.

 Sushma one step in RS

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Sushma: An Elder soon?

 Bhopal, March 8: BJP leader Sushma Swaraj is set to enter the Rajya Sabha from Madhya Pradesh where her party is expected to net four of the five upper House berths in the biennial election scheduled for March 28. 

 A firm indication of the former Union ministers election from the state came when she registered herself as a voter in Bhopal.

 According to the voter list, Sushma is a tenant at 20/7 Laukheri, a property that belongs to local BJP leader Jitendra Daga. 

 It is another matter that the former Union minister, now officially a resident of the Govindpura Assembly segment, has not visited Bhopal in recent days. 

 Bhopals subdivisional magistrate Mahendra Singh confirmed Sushmas inclusion in the voters list and added that it was a requisite according to Section 22 of the Representation of the Peoples Act, 1951. 

 Senior Congress leader Digvijay Singh today claimed that he had congratulated Sushma in anticipation of her election. She accepted my good wishes and said that she looks forward to representing the state in Parliament, Singh, who was on a short visit to the state capital, said. 

 Apart from Sushma, the BJPs Vikram Verma and Narain Singh Kesri are tipped to get re-elected to the Rajya Sabha. Both have the backing of chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan. 

 However, for the fourth slot from the BJP quota, there are three claimants ? Brajesh Mishra, the former national security adviser who is a close associate of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, state BJP vice-president Raghunandan Sharma and the state units organisational secretary, Kaptan Singh Solanki.

 Brajesh is from Madhya Pradesh. His father D.P. Mishra was an influential Congress leader who served as chief minister of Madhya Pradesh. While Brajesh is counting on Vajpayees support, a section of the RSS is bitterly opposed to his candidature. 

 Sharmas hopes pin on seniority while Kaptan Singh is considered close to senior leader Pramod Mahajan and party chief Rajnath Singh. 

 On the basis of its current strength, the Congress hopes to bag the fifth seat with the help of Independents and MLAs loyal to Uma Bharti. 

 Union human resource development minister Arjun Singh is a favourite but his failing health has put a question mark over his nomination. But state Congress leaders are unanimous that in keeping with his seniority, Arjun should be fielded irrespective of his health.

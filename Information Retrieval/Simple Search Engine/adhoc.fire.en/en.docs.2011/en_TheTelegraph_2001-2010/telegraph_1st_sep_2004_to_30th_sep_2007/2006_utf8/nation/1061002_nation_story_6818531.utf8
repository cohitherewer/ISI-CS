 Pilgrims sucked in dam surge

 Bhopal: At least 20 people were feared dead when devotees on their way to a temple in Madhya Pradesh got swept away after a sudden release of water from a nearby dam on Sunday evening, reports our special correspondent.

 The incident brought back memories of a similar tragedy in April 2005 when over a hundred people died in Dewas district on the banks of the Narmada. In both cases, the district administration did not take precautionary measures despite knowing that water would be released from dams.

 Eyewitnesses in Seondha, 250 km from Bhopal, said they saw several women getting swept away after the water level in the Sindh rose while they were crossing the river on foot to offer prayers at Mata Mandir in Ratangarh on Durga Navami. The temple, in a dense forest, is 15 km from Seondha. Thousands have thronged the shrine in the last few days as part of the Durga festival.

 The witnesses said water was released from the Manikheda dam without prior information. Divisional commissioner Komal Singh, however, denied that water was released without warning.

 Datia collector M. Geeta said police rescue teams had fished out the bodies of Bhumi (20), Kangan (15) and Kamla Bai (60) and seven divers were still searching for the others.

 Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan has asked Geeta to probe the incident and send a report.

 Last year, over 100 pilgrims died while taking a dip in the Narmada after a dam released water for power generation without realising that thousands had gathered downstream. 

 The Narmada Hydroelectric Development Corporation, which released the water, blamed the local administration for not informing the pilgrims.

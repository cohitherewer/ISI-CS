 Fine on school for mid-session boot

 - Compensation 

 for nurse and class XII student 

 Shielded 

 New Delhi, Nov. 12 (PTI): A consumer forum has imposed a fine of Rs 50,000 on Delhi Public School (DPS), Faridabad, for expelling a student in mid-session for faring badly in his exams. 

 It is a sorry state of affairs that schools like DPS, in their anxiety to show good results in academics, are ready to go to any extent to expel a student in the mid-session of the 12th standard, said G.D. Dhanuka, president of Southwest Delhi Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum. 

 Holding the school guilty of unfair trade practice, the forum directed its administration to pay within a month the amount as compensation to Ritwik Puri, who was expelled after the semester examination of class XII in 2003.

 The forum rejected the contention that Puri was expelled as he remained absent without permission despite a notice served on his father.

 The school authorities just wanted to expel Puri from the school because he was not performing well in academics and to achieve this purpose, he was not allowed to attend the classes and his forced absence was made a basis to strike off his name from the rolls of the school, the forum said. 

 Puri had joined the school in June 2003. After he failed to secure good marks in the first semester exams, he was not allowed to attend classes for the next five days. 

 His father had visited the school authorities who assured him his son could resume classes, but on July 30, he received a letter stating that his sons name had been struck off due to unexplained absence from the school.

 The forum also rejected the schools contention that it did not have territorial jurisdiction as the school is located in Faridabad in Haryana.

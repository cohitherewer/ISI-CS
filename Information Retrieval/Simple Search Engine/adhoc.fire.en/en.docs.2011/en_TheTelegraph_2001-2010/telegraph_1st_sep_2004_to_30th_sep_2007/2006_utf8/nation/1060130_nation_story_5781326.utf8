 Mulford sets multiple tests

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 29: The Iran vote was only one of several conditions David Mulford had set India if it wanted to get its nuclear energy deal with Washington through the US Congress.

 In his controversial interview to a news agency last week, the US ambassador had tied the July 2005 pacts success also to Indias willingness to put most of its nuclear reactors into the civilian programme.

 The plan to separate its civil and nuclear reactors that India had presented to the US earlier this month has failed to meet the test of credibility and minimum standard that the US legislature requires, the envoy had said.

 I mean, it doesnt do any good to agree to a plan that? isnt credible and then try to sell it to 35 countries and a hundred senators and 400-plus members of the House. You know, you have got to be sure that you can get the votes to win that, Mulford was quoted as saying by the agency, which today released fresh excerpts from the interview.

 The first reports of the interview had Mulford asserting that the Indo-US nuclear deal would die unless Delhi voted against Iran at the coming International Atomic Energy Agency board meeting.

 The ultimatum prompted a summons by Indian foreign secretary Shyam Saran, who told Mulford that linking the nuclear deal with the Iran controversy was inappropriate.

 To defuse the tension, the US state department then snubbed the ambassador, disowning his stand and dubbing it his personal view.

 But experts here feel there could be a method to Mulfords madness. Though the US has distanced itself from his remarks, Delhi has become suspicious of Washingtons designs.

 There is a growing feeling that through its ambassador, America has floated a trial balloon to judge the mood in Delhis political circles. Such tactics are part of international diplomacy, an official said.

 Mulford had said that even if India did not fully implement the separation plan, it must give a commitment. On the basis of that commitment from India, we would seek to change the US law and we would seek to gain the consensus of the Nuclear Suppliers Group in the world (to get the deal through the US Congress).

 If a legislation to alter US law were to be placed in the US Congress before President Bushs visit here, we have to come to agreement relatively quickly because it takes time to prepare and place legislation before the Congress. It takes several weeks, he said.

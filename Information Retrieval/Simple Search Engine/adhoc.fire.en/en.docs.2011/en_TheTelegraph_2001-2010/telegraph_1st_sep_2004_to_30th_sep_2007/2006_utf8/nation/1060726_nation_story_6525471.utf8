 Relief for Husain

 New Delhi, July 25: The Supreme Court today stayed a Bhopal court order seeking the personal appearance of M.F. Husain in a case against him for outraging religious sentiments through his paintings, reports our legal correspondent.

 The court also restrained the Bhopal court from conducting further proceedings in the matter.

 The interim orders, given on a petition by Husain seeking transfer of the case to Delhi, come as a relief to the painter as a warrant could have been issued against him if he did not appear before the court. He had been summoned to appear on Thursday.

 Husain had earlier moved court for transfer of similar cases from Indore and Rajkot to the capital citing a threat to his life on account of rewards offered for killing him. He has also moved a transfer petition in connection with a case registered at Pandharpur in Maharashtra.

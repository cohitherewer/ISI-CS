 Development slur on green guardian

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, March 21: The ministry of environment has cleared dams, hydroelectric projects, mines, ports and steel plants across India without adequate assessment of their environmental impact, a coalition of non-government organisations has alleged.

 In a letter to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, the environmental action group Kalpavriksh and several other organisations said hydroelectric plants in Sikkim, Uttaranchal, Arunachal Pradesh, a dam in Andhra Pradesh and mines in Jharkhand and Orissa are among projects cleared by the ministry despite local opposition and incomplete assessments.

 The environmental groups timed their letter with the start of the eighth conference of the global Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) in Brazil yesterday. The biodiversity convention, which India had ratified in 1994, specifies voluntary guidelines that urge member nations to assess the cultural, social and environmental impact of development projects before approving them.

 The guidelines suggest that local communities should be part of the screening process. But there is a total lack of such involvement (of local communities) at most states of the environmental impact assessment process, the letter said.

 Many industrial and developmental projects are operating without environmental approval, the groups said. Instead of taking action on such projects, the groups said, the ministry of environment and forests in July 2005 issued an amendment to rules, assisting all such projects to get post-facto clearances.

 The environment ministry is mandated with the task of safeguarding the environment. If it doesnt do it, who else will do it? asked Kanchi Kohli, a member of Kalpavriksh who has compiled a report on violations of environmental impact procedures.

 Citing examples, the letter said the Teeta V hydroelectric project in Sikkim was granted clearance even before a study on its likely impact on the local Lepcha and Bhutia communities was completed.

 The letter said the Sethusamudram Ship Canal project on the Tamil Nadu coast and the Polavaram dam in Andhra will have a severe impact on livelihoods of local communities and the environment and have met with resistance from local populations.

 There is not a single known case of environmental impact assessment involving the indigenous tribal or community experts, the letter said. The environmental groups have described this as a complete disregard of international obligations.

 The letter claims several mines, ports, dams and industrial projects are being pursued despite inadequate environmental assessment.

 Members of the environmental coalition said it was ironic that while India was one of the most proactive countries in the formulation of the biodiversity convention, it has lost its leadership role in the past few years.

 They warned that by violating the provisions of the convention, India is endangering its fast-eroding biodiversity, threatening the future of its unique and culturally diverse traditional communities and opening up traditional knowledge to biopiracy.

 Centre rules out ban on plastic

 New Delhi (PTI): The government has ruled out imposing a blanket ban on plastic bags but noted that certain categories are prohibited as indiscriminate littering and recycling practices can have an adverse impact on the environment. 

 There is no proposal with the government at present to ban usage of plastic bags all over the country, considering the volume of plastics consumed, size of the industry and non-availability of cheaper substitutes, said minister of state for environment and forests N.N. Meena.

 But manufacture, stocking, distribution or selling of plastic bags made of virgin or recycled plastic that are less than 2030 cm in size and 20-micron thick is banned, the minister added.

 Use of recycled plastic bags for storing, carrying, dispensing or packaging foodstuff is also prohibited.

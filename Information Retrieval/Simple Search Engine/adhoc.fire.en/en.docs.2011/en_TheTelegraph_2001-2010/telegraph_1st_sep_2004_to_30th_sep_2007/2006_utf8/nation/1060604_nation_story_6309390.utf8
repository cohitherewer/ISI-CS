The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Capture, live on TV

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 3: The drama being played out on national TV could well be titled Indias most wanted, live.

 The 21-year-old the police were looking for in the nations most high-profile case of the moment sat coolly in a news channels office in hometown Srinagar, proclaiming himself innocent.

 Sahil Ahmad Zaroo, the fourth guest at the party in Rahul Mahajans home, was just making sure he got himself heard by a national audience before the police picked him up.

 But the channels live scoop was marred by the rest of the Srinagar media barging in. Soon, instead of the two anchors in Delhi, Sahil and his lawyer Aslam Goni were facing a battery of cameras.

 As the two got up to leave, the channels local correspondent made them sit down again for another round of questions from him.

 Then came the second twist in the story.

 By now, the local police had decided that enough was enough and they had to step in ? after all, the cops from Delhi would be arriving any moment to take custody of the young man.

 So as television viewers across the country watched, the police, too, barged into the scene and led Sahil out. TV showed long shots of the youth being taken away in a closed vehicle, two policemen perched on its footboard, their guns resting on the roof.

 Earlier, Goni had dramatically announced before the cameras that the police had illegally detained Sahils father Gulam Hassan Zaroo, a carpet merchant, to put pressure on the son.

 Sahil denied he had got drugs for the party. He was just a normal guy who didnt do drugs ? though he admitted trying out the white powder at the party and falling ill himself. I dont even take liquor, he claimed.

 But the manager of a posh pub in Juhu, Mumbai ? where Sahil studied ? gave a different picture.

 He was a regular here. I last saw him two weeks back. He was very much into alcohol. He would usually come alone but mingled a lot with the crowd here, said Nitin Damle, senior captain of Bohemia, a haunt of stars, models and other celebrities.

 Sahil said he had a house in Delhi and lived in Mumbai as well, where he knew Bibek.

 He said his friends had called him to the party and he had gone. He had no idea of what was happening there.

 Now, he said, he was scared because it was being made out that he was responsible for the episode, and a politician from a powerful party was involved.

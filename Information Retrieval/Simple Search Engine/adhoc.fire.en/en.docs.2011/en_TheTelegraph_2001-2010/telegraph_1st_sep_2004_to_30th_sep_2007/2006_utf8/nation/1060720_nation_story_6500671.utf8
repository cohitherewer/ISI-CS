 New Delhi, July 19: Jamia Milia Islamia University was shut down indefinitely, after violent clashes yesterday between administrators and people claiming to be students left the varsity shaken and its infrastructure bruised.

 Three persons, including former Jamia students union president Shams Pervez, were seriously injured and are in the intensive care unit of a south Delhi hospital. 

 It pains me to declare the university shut sine die, but in the wake of yesterdays events, we see no other option, announced vice-chancellor Mushirul Hassan.

 I have to take this decision to ensure the safety and security of all my colleagues, and of the institution. 

 Even as he spoke, riot police were on the campus surveying blood splattered near the boys hostel and shards of glass from broken car windshields near the parking lot. 

 The clashes ? on the first day of the new academic session ? are believed to have broken out in response to the administrations decision not to give admission to some students who allegedly have criminal antecedents. 

 Four such students went to meet Hassan last evening along with Pervez. 

 While they were waiting outside his office, a scuffle broke out between the proctor, Rocket Ibrahim, and the students, in the middle of which Ibrahim is alleged to have pulled out his revolver. 

 The revolver was used to threaten them to go away, said Mohammed Khalil of the outgoing students union.

 Two hours later, a gang intercepted Pervez and two others as they were leaving their hostel and beat them up, allegedly at the behest of the proctor. 

 He brandished a gun first, then sent his goons, said Anwar Hussain, a friend of Pervez.

 Hussain and the others then went on a rampage, damaging over 30 vehicles and 15 computers, prompting the administration officials to call police.

 Jamia authorities, however, said they had no role in sending the goons. Shams is our own student, and we very much regret what happened to him, said Hassan.

 According to the vice-chancellor, hard-nosed criminals, and not Jamia students, are behind yesterdays events.

 These are people who are known to join universities only to stand in student elections. We do not want them running our student bodies, Hassan said, explaining why these criminals were denied admission. These people want to take Jamia back to the days when it was better known for student violence than for academic excellence.

 Jamias turbulent past has seen several student leaders picked up by the police for a variety of crimes ranging from murder to alleged links with terror outfits.

 In 1997, after the varsity was shut following student protests, the students union was disbanded. A new union was elected in 2005 with Hassan at the helm of the administration.

 So many new courses were introduced this year, the library was improved and other academic facilities were overhauled as well, Hassan said.

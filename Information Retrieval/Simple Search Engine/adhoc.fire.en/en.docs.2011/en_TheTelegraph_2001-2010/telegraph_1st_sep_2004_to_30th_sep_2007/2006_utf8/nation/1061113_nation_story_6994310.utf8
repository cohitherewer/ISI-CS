 Rs 5.5 lakh for eye lost to hospital rape

 New Delhi, Nov. 12 (PTI): Delhi High Court has directed Shanti Mukund Hospital in east Delhi to pay as compensation Rs 5.5 lakh to a nurse who lost her right eye because of rape and assault by an employee within the premises in 2003.

 The court also directed Guru Tegh Bahadur Hospital to pay the victim Rs 2 lakh for negligence in providing adequate treatment to her after the incident.

 In his order on Friday, Justice Manmohan Sarin said: In the present case, where a heinous crime like rape was committed on a helpless girl, the high court must not restrict itself to (a) rigid stand like locus standi.

 The verdict came on a petition filed by the victim seeking compensation for the irreparable loss caused to her.

 The hospital was asked to pay Rs 1.5 lakh now and put the balance amount in fixed deposit for four years.

 Valley killings

 Jammu, April 30 (PTI): After a lull of several months, militants killed four persons after abducting 11 people this afternoon from Udhampur district. 

 The militants freed two but the fate of the rest remained unknown.

 Director-general of Jammu and Kashmir police Gopal Sharma said militants kidnapped nine Hindus and two Muslims from separate places of Basantgarh area in Udhampur this afternoon and took them to higher reaches of the mountainous belt.

 The militants freed the Muslims later in the evening while the police found the bodies of four Hindus, Sharma said. Search parties have been sent to find the rest.

 The higher reaches of Udhampur and Doda had once been a hotbed of abductions and killings by militants.

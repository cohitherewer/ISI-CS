 Calcutta, 

 Dec. 10: ESPN STAR Sports has bagged the audio-visual 

 rights to International Cricket Council events from late 

 2007 to 2015.

 The ICC did not disclose the final figure but said it is significantly in excess of the previous deal, which was clinched at $550 million (around Rs 2,475 crore) for 2000 to 2007. 

 The new agreement is for a huge, huge amount, a source claimed without specifying the figure.

 ESPN STAR Sports was chosen through a unanimous decision of the ICC board, according to a statement issued from the councils Dubai headquarters.

 Included in the new eight-year period are 18 ICC tournaments with two ICC Cricket World Cups, in Asia (2011) and Australasia (2015), and a minimum of three ICC Champions Trophy tournaments.

 It will also cover the first two ICC Twenty20 World Championships, in South Africa (2007) and England (2009), the latter taking place in the centenary year of the council.

 Cricket World Cup qualifiers, four ICC U/19 Cricket World Cups, and, for the first time, the Womens Cricket World Cup, with two tournaments scheduled for 2009 (Australia) and 2013 (India), are also part of the eight-year deal.

 After an open and transparent process, we have what we believe to be the best deal for cricket, ICC president Percy Sonn said.

 All the bids we received were of a very high standard. However, the board was unanimous in the view that the ESPN STAR Sports bid was the best, he added.

 Jamie Davis, the managing director of ESPN STAR Sports, said: This acquisition affirms our commitment to the Indian sub-continent and the world.

 I.S. Bindra was Indias representative at the Dubai meeting. This deal is good for the game and it shows cricket is growing. Much of the money that comes from this deal can be ploughed back into the development of the game, he said.

 The ICC team that met the potential media partners and sponsors and conducted negotiations included CEO Malcolm Speed and former president Ehsan Mani.

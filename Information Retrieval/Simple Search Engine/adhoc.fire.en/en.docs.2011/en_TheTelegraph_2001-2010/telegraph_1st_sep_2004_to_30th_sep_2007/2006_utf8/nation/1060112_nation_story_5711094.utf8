 Calcutta, Jan. 11: The South-Eastern Railway had to cancel three long-distance trains and divert a few others because of a sit-in on the tracks by local tribals at Bondamunda near Rourkela, an official said.

 Almost all long-distance trains from and to Howrah were running late by at least six to seven hours, the railway official added. 

 The cancelled trains were the Howrah-Kurla Express, Howrah-Mumbai Gitanjali Express and the Howrah-Koraput Express. 

 Some major trains like the Mumbai Mail, Howrah-Pune Azad Hind Express and the Ahmedabad Express were diverted because of the blockade.

 Wedding woes drive MBA to leap to death

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Oct. 28: A group of policemen and residents watched in disbelief as a 25-year-old jumped to her death from a building in Walkeshwar this afternoon.

 Karishma Kadakia, an MBA from Britain, ended her life after realising that she might not be able to marry her interior designer boyfriend because of differences between their families.

 A resident of the upscale Malabar Hill, Karishma had called up boyfriend Nipun Doshi this morning and went to his home in Walkeshwars Navjyot Sagar building in the afternoon.

 On her way out of his third-floor house, she went up the stairs and climbed on to a parapet between the third and fourth floors.

 She sat there for about 15 minutes, her feet dangling, as stunned residents gathered below. 

 They called Malabar Hill police station, but before the officers could rescue her, Karishma had jumped.

 She was rushed to a nearby hospital, where she succumbed to injuries.

 Officers found Karishmas spectacles and shoes on the third-floor staircase, but there wasnt any suicide note. 

 The police have registered a case of suicide and are investigating the possible reasons that drove the woman to death.

 Karishma, whose father Dr Anil Kadakia works with the Brazilian consulate, had been living in the UK for several years, the police said. She returned in May this year after getting her MBA degree from a British university.

 Karishma met Nipun when the Kadakias decided to renovate their flat and employed the 27-year-old interior designer. 

 Soon after, Karishma and Nipun began dating. When they told their parents about the relationship, the Doshis met the Kadakias with a formal proposal. But the marriage plans fell through because of some disagreement.

 Karishmas parents today said she was temperamental by nature.

 The multi-storeyed Grand Paradi at Malabar Hill, where Karishma lived, has been home to several suicide victims.

 The most macabre of them happened on a March afternoon in 2005. Spare parts dealer Balkrishna Dalal, 48, his wife Sonal and their daughter Pooja leapt to their death from their eighth-floor flat on the day a local court was to give its verdict in a case filed against the family for allegedly driving Balkrishnas parents to commit suicide. 

 Balkrishnas parents had jumped off the same flat in June 1998.

 Malabar Hill was also witness to a suicide by a 66-year-old doctor in July this year. 

 Dr Navin Hiranandani, the brother of construction magnate Niranjan Hiranandani, slashed his wrist with a kitchen knife in a bathroom in his sixth-floor flat in Kanta Apartments on Little Gibbs Road. 

 Police investigations concluded that the doctor was suffering from depression.

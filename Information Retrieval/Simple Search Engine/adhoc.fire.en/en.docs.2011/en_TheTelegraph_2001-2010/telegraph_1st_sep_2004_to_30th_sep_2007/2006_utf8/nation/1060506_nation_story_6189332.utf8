 Darkness looms on Delhi shops

 New Delhi, May 5 (PTI): The Delhi government has said its market areas would face loadshedding from 7.30 to 11 pm and industrial areas would go dark between 6.30 pm and midnight to manage the nearly 500 mw power shortfall in the state. 

 A high-level meeting was convened by Delhi power minister Haroon Yusuf today to work out ways to provide relief to Delhiites in the searing summer heat. 

 After the meeting, Yusuf said the loadshedding in the market areas would force shopkeepers to down shutters by 7.30 pm.

 Government offices in the capital have been directed not to use air-conditioners after 6.30 pm. 

 The markets have been asked to stay closed for one day in a week.

 Other directives issued by the government include disallowing illumination of advertisement hoardings. The power minister has also appealed to residents not to use air-conditioners before 9 pm. All these would lead to conservation of 250-300 mw of power, Yusuf said.

 The power crisis of the last few days is believed to have been caused by over-drawing from the northern grid by neighbouring states.

 The Supreme Court has asked the Centre and the Delhi government to file separate affidavits within two weeks on the steps being taken to enhance power generation and supply to meet the capitals increased needs.

 India clears terror air

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 27: India today clarified the scope of the anti-terrorism institutional mechanism with Pakistan, saying it was mandated to address all forms of the scourge. 

 The clarification came after Pakistan asserted that the new mechanism did not stipulate handing over wanted people, including Kashmiri militants, as they had the different status of freedom fighters.

 Delhi said the mechanism agreed in Havana on September 16 by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and President Pervez Musharraf was clearly mandated to identify and implement counter-terrorism initiatives and investigations.

 There is no doubt in our minds as to what constitutes terrorism and it is clear that the group is mandated to address all forms of terrorism, said a foreign office spokesperson.

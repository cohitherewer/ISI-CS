The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 New wings ready to soar for domestic air race

 SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI

 Mumbai, Feb. 15: A host of low-fare airlines will spice up the skies this summer, though Calcutta will miss out on the bonanza for a while.

 At least five new airlines will join the race to grab a slice of the swelling domestic market within the next few months. And with competition hotting up, most are putting their money where the rush is: the lucrative Delhi-Bangalore-Mumbai sector.

 Its a war out there and, in the initial period when one will have to grab market share at a furious pace, it is better to be with a safe sector, says Bruce Ashby, the CEO and president of IndiGo, one of the low-fare carriers launching this year.

 The Bangalore-based Air One, feeder carrier Jagson Airlines, Chennais Premier Air and the once-tainted East West Airlines will also cruise into the domestic skies to compete with the existing players.

 IndiGo, which placed orders for 100 Airbus aircraft at the Paris Air Show last year, will have the biggest fleet among the lot. The delivery of our first aircraft will take place sometime in July. We plan to start operations between July 1 and August 5, says Ashby.

 The airline is not planning any sensational pricing strategy. They would be in the same range as fares being offered by other low-cost carriers in the Indian market like SpiceJet and Air Deccan, says Ashby.

 As of now, the plans are to operate between metros with stoppages at intermediate spots like Delhi-Ahmedabad-Mumbai or Mumbai-Indore-Chennai-Thiruvananthapuram. 

 Most eyes, however, would be trained on the comeback of Indias first private airline ? East West. The airline, which withdrew operations in the nineties following reports of underworld links, is back.

 We will be up there by May with five leased Boeings. We will service Mumbai, Chennai, Bangalore, Delhi and Nagpur. Later on we will operate to Category II and III (smaller) airports. Basically, we will operate to all airports we were flying to earlier, says managing director Faisal Wahid.

 The East-West Group started airline operations in 1993 but folded up in 1996 after its managing-director, Thakiyudeen Wahid, was killed in 1995 because of underworld rivalries. NRI businessman Nasiruddin Wahid and his brother, the Bombay-based Faisal Wahid, now head the group.

 Air One, which has on its rolls former employees of Indian (formerly Indian Airlines), will be the first among the new carriers to take off. Initially scheduled for a February launch, it is now looking at March. We will start in any case before March 17, says a source in the airline.

 The launch flight will be between Bangalore and Delhi. Later, it plans to connect Mumbai with other south Indian cities. Air One will be the third Bangalore-based low-fare carrier after Kingfisher and Air Deccan.

 Feeder airline Jagson, too, has thrown its hat in the ring and is looking at a May launch. The airline, which has so far flown from Delhi to hill resort destinations in Himachal Pradesh and to Rajasthan, will enter the sector with Delhi-Bangalore flights. It has Uttam Kumar Bose, who earlier headed Air Sahara, as its president and CEO.

 Chennai-based real estate company Premier will make its first foray in the aviation sector between April and June. The no-frills airline, floated by US-based NRIs, will connect all metros from Chennai and later link prominent south Indian cities.

 Premier will be the second low-cost carrier from Tamil Nadu ? the all-business class Paramount Airways was the first to hit the skies in October 2005.

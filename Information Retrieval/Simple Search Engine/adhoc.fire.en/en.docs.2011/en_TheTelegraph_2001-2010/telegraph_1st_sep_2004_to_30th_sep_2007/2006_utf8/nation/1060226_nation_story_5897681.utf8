 Nicholas Burns

 Washington/New Delhi, Feb. 25: With an agreement over the Indo-US nuclear deal almost within grasp, Americas under-secretary of state for political affairs, Nicholas Burns, extended his stay in New Delhi for a final round of talks with foreign secretary Shyam Saran today.

 Full agreement on the separation of Indias civilian and military nuclear facilities, however, remained elusive and Burns returned to Washington on Saturday to brief secretary of state Condoleezza Rice on the progress in negotiations before he goes to New Delhi once again with President George W. Bush in another four days. Originally, Burns was to have left New Delhi on Friday night.

 In Washington, the US national security adviser, Steve Hadley, detailed for reporters the progress made by Burns in New Delhi: In this latest round, the Indians provided a document about a week ago; we provided some additional ideas and response. Nick Burns?is now coming back to Washington to report on where we are on those discussions. We are making progress, but we are not yet there. 

 He said the hold up in talks was over getting some clarification from the Indian side about what is in the civil side and what is on the military side, not only in terms of what exists now, at this time, but what are going to be the ground rules (for) going forward in relation to facilities which India may put up in future.

 Hadley said Burns and Saran will continue the negotiations by phone, document and the like and painted a picture of the intense nature of the talks when he said the process may go on probably up through the Presidents ? up to the Presidents visit.

 He stressed that we would obviously, like, and the Indians would like to use the occasion of this visit to reach agreement on this separation agreement, so-called.

 But he pointed out that what is important is to have a good agreement that works for the Indians, works for the US, will be acceptable to our Congress and to the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG).?We would like to get it before the trip. If we can, great. If we cant, we will continue to negotiate it after the trip.

 Like Bush three days ago, Hadley made the point that this is a very broad and rich relationship between the US and India right now, and the two leaders will have a lot to talk about, whether theres this agreement or not.

 The ministry of external affairs acknowledged that there was greater clarity on the issues under discussion. The US embassy in New Delhi said in a statement there are remaining differences but the US hopes they can be closed before the President visits India.

 Congress rules but the durbar is dead

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Indira Gandhi meets visitors at her residence during the morning durbar

 Oct. 25: Indira Gandhi thrived on it, Rajiv Gandhi relished it, and even the pouting P.V. Narasimha Rao would sit through it. Yet its all history now.

 Blame it on stifling security or a creeping corporate culture, the morning durbar that was once a Congress trait is as good as dead.

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh doesnt host janata darshans. 

 At Sonia Gandhis 10 Janpath residence, such walk-in, open-house sessions have been infrequent and are held in the afternoon.

 Most cabinet ministers and All India Congress Committee general secretaries start their day at 10 or 11 am, with meetings fixed strictly through appointment.

 The real activity at 24 Akbar Road, the Congress headquarters, now starts after 7 pm. Senior leaders like Ahmad Patel, Oscar Fernandes and Mukul Wasnik hold meetings well past midnight.

 In the 80s and 90s, however, not only the leader but heavyweight AICC officials and cabinet ministers would set aside a couple of hours in the morning for the aam aadmi.

 Between 8 and 9.30 am, people of every hue and station would walk into the palatial bungalows on Akbar Road, Tughlaq Road and their neighbourhood to have their say.

 At Indiras Safdarjung Road residence, it wasnt unusual to witness a mufassil (provincial) correspondent giving her feedback on the political situation in a particular district or a saintly fakir handing unsolicited tips to ward off impending evil.

 Similar scenes were enacted at the residences of leaders ranging from Kamlapati Tripathi and H.N. Bahuguna to Rajesh Pilot, Sitaram Kesri, A.B.A. Ghani Khan Chowdhury, Jitendra Prasada and Ghulam Nabi Azad.

 Even the reticent Rao listened attentively to district-level activists from Varanasi or Madurai. Congress workers say Raos problem wasnt that he didnt listen but that he never followed it up with swift and decisive action.

 Senior party leaders now privately mourn the demise of the morning sessions, arguing that those free hours brought immense benefits.

 First, they allowed the leaders to have their ears to the ground. Second, they helped the government and party relay their message to the grassroots through politically inclined teachers, farmers, academics, social activists, journalists and even religious leaders.

 Some Congress workers are ready to cite security as a reason for the durbars dying out, but old-timers reject this as a poor excuse for avoiding the very people who play a pivotal role in leaders success.

 They argue that would-be visitors are aware of the changed security environment and are willing to go through the drill. Besides, the security situation had changed as far back as 1984 when Indira was assassinated, yet the sessions had continued for over a decade and a half.

 Many blame the corporate culture in the party. The very idea of late-night meetings, they feel, suggests a lack of transparency.

 It calls to the mind the shadowy image of a clandestine operation. This may not actually be true, but isnt politics all about perception? a former chief minister asked.

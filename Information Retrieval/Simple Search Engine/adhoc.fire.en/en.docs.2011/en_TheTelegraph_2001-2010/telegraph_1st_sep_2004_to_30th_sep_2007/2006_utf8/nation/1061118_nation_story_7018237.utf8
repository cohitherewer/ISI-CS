 Mumbai, Nov. 17: Three of Angelina Jolies bodyguards, accused of shoving parents at a city school yesterday with shouts of you bloody Indian and you bloody Muslim, were arrested this afternoon.

 Jolies husband Brad Pitt later met Mumbai police chief Anami Roy to assure him that such ugly quarrels would not happen again.

 The three British guards, charged with insulting religious sentiments and causing hurt to parents, were granted bail against bonds of Rs 25,000 each. They must report to Azad Maidan police station every day till November 23.

 Thomas Edward Macadam, 47, Robert Patrick Duney, 36, and Michael John Brett, 50, were arrested from the Taj Mahal Hotel following a police complaint by Ansari Zuber Ahmed, father of a student of Anjuman-E-Islam school.

 The complaint said Brett who had last month been accused of scuffling with a news photographer in Pune had placed his electronic stick on Ahmeds neck yesterday and threatened to kill him.

 Police commissioner Roy, however, said the guards had not been armed as alleged by some parents.

 Ram Jethmalanis son Mahesh, who appeared for the trio, too pressed this point before a metropolitan court as he argued for bail.

 The guards have been booked under several bailable sections of the Indian Penal Code: Section 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), Section 298 (hurting religious sentiments), Section 504 (intentionally causing insults to provoke breach of peace) and section 506 (criminal intimidation).

 With Jolies personal security boasting seven to eight guards in all, the arrest of the trio did not prevent her from shooting today. She shot several sequences for the Hollywood film, A Mighty Heart, at the Sea Rock hotel in Bandra, a film unit source said.

 Commissioner Roy told reporters that Pitt, co-producer of the film, had expressed regrets about the school incident. I told them to convey their regrets through the media.

 The police chief added that the films producers had not taken police permission for shooting at the school. The police station was not informed about the filming.

 Before a film production company can shoot anywhere in the city, it needs clearance from the owners of the premises, the municipal ward office and the local police station and traffic authorities.

 Roy said the producers had obtained permission for filming at the other city locations till Friday. They will now need to seek fresh permissions before they can shoot.

 Pitt was accompanied to the commissioners office by Jolies co-actor Irrfan Khan, the films line producers, ad man Kailash Surendranath and his wife Aarti.

 Aarti said: Our shooting has not been stopped for any reason. We continued filming after the incident yesterday, and today as well.

 The producers had yesterday issued a statement saying, We had full permission and cooperation of the school to film on the premises.

 They blamed the paparazzi for the confusion.

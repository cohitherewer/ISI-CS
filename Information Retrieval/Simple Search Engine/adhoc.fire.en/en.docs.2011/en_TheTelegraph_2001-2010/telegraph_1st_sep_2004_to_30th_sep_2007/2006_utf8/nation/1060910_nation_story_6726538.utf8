The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 A lesson for Sonia, from Gaddafi

 AMIT ROY

 The poster of Gaddafi: 

 A Living Myth

 London, Sept. 9: Has Sonia Gandhi been just a little hasty in getting the Congress to block Provoked director Jagmohun Mundhra from making a film on her life?

 Producers acknowledge that it is notoriously difficult to depict people who are still alive for either the stage or screen, but Muammar Gaddafi, the 64-year-old Libyan leader, is said to be very keen to come to London to see the English National Operas controversial production of Gaddafi: A Living Myth, which premiered in London on Thursday.

 Among the more than 2,000 people who packed the Coliseum on the opening night were dozens of thoughtful Libyans whose opinions positive it seemed to The Telegraph will have percolated back by now to the Leader of the Revolution in Tripoli. 

 His daughter is in the audience, confided a journalist from a Libyan news agency, whose account I will report it fairly is certain to be read eagerly by the Libyan dictator.

 All things considered, the portrait that emerges of Gaddafi, given his previous involvement in dodgy deeds, is not exactly negative. This should reassure Sonia. In comparison, Sonia the film or Sonia the musical is likely to make the Congress president come across as almost the successor to Mother Teresa. Perhaps Mundhra, languishing in Los Angeles, should be summoned forthwith to the court in Delhi.

 It is unlikely that the Libyan leader will actually come to London but Gaddafi, known to be a vain man, will have read every word written about the English National Operas bold experiment to take opera where its never been before.

 There is a big British Asian involvement in the production. The libretto has been written by Shan Khan, a writer for TV, and the music is by one of Britains most popular bands, the Mercury Prize-nominated Asian Dub Foundation. One of its members, Steve Chandra Savales, is credited with conception of the project as well as additional lyrics.

 At one point, the background music appeared to have more than a passing resemblance to the Bollywood number Tu Cheez Badi Hai Mast Mast. Asked for an explanation by The Telegraph at the post-show party, Savales laughed but did not issue any denial. He merely said he was inspired by Sufi music, especially quawaal.

 Among the Asian actors in the cast is Ramon Tikaram, who plays the Libyan leader. 

 Audiences in India will have seen Tikaram, who is part Indian from Fiji, in Mira Nairs Kamasutra. 

 In Britain, Tikaram is known for his roles in television sitcom but he has also played the villain in Andrew Lloyd Webbers musical Bombay Dreams.

 Strictly speaking, Gaddafi: A Living Myth is not an opera or a musical or even a play or a film though it has elements of all. There is very little singing. Mostly words are spoken and speeches made over the Asian Dub Foundations (very loud) music. 

 Effective use is also made of background film, which takes audiences through the main events which shaped Gaddafis life.

 They go from Italian oppression of the country to the army coup which brought Gaddafi to power in 1969 in the past 37 years, he has seen off most of his enemies (including US President Ronald Reagan) his attempts to create a pan-Arab unity and merge Libya with Egypt, his export of terrorism to militant groups, including the IRA, in many other countries, the suspected Libyan hand in the blowing up of Pan Am flight 103 over the Scottish town of Lockerbie in 1988 and the alleged Libyan involvement in the explosion which killed US servicemen in a Berlin night club and the subsequent American bombing of Libya (in which Gaddafis adopted daughter was killed).

 In political terms, Gaddafi has come in from the cold, having renounced any plans to produce weapons of terror it was Libya that disclosed it had received nuclear secrets from A.Q. Khan, the Pakistani nuclear scientist.

 All this is rather a lot of history to pack into just over two hours but the audience is given the impression that if Gaddafi used torture to suppress his political enemies, western leaders were just as complicit in helping to create the kind of man he turned out to be.

 Artistically, Gaddafi: A Living Myth is best described as a work in progress. What is important is that the English National Opera has broken new ground with the production. It has already been suggested, tongue in cheek, that Blair: The Final Days is ready for similar treatment.

 Perhaps Sonia should see Gaddafi: A Living Myth. She may not have a change of heart about allowing Mundhra to film in India but in the West, at least, a line has been crossed in the sand. 

 The potential for contemporary politicians to provide material for theatrical entertainment was spotted a long time ago by Shakespeare: All the worlds a stage,/ And all the men and women merely players:/ They have their exits and their entrances;/ And one man (or woman?) in his time plays many parts.

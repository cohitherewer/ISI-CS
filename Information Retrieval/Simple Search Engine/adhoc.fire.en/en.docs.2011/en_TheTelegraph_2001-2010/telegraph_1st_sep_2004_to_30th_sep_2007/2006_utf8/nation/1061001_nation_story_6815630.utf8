 AIIMS medic dies of dengue 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 30: Doctors at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences caught in the grip of dengue are blaming a 10-foot-wide open drain just behind the campus for the outbreak of the disease.

 A seventh-semester medical student from Hyderabad died today of bleeding in the brain, a rare complication of dengue, while at least 14 students and five nurses have also been infected by the dengue virus.

 Medical superintendent D.K. Sharma said brain haemorrhage is a very rare complication in dengue and has not been observed in recent years, though dengue appears to have settled in the capital since its first major outbreak in 1996. 

 This is the season for dengue, but this year, the numbers are higher than what we have experienced in the past, Sharma said.

 The capital has witnessed a spurt in dengue over the past month. During August, the AIIMS received around 25 cases, but this month, the number has gone up to 90, he said. Nine people had died till yesterday.

 Since the mid-nineties, dengue has emerged as a major infection with either outbreaks or a growing number of sporadic cases reported from many cities, including Calcutta, Ludhiana, Bangalore and Mumbai.

 Public health authorities are blaming municipal officials for not doing enough to control the spread of mosquitoes. 

 Municipal staff in Delhi have been scouring apartment blocks and houses for household air coolers and other potential breeding sites for the Aedes egypti mosquito, the carrier of the dengue virus.

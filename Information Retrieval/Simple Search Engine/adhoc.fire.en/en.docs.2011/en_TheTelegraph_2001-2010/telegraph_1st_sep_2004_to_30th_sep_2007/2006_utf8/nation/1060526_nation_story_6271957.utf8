 No VIP treatment in temples

Chennai: The next time the king of Nepal visits the Ramanathaswamy 

temple in Rameshwaram, there will be no parivattam (a silk cloth tied around 

the head as a mark of honour) and no poorna kumbham (pot of flowers) to 

welcome him. 

 Tamil Nadu chief minister M. Karunanidhi has told the Assembly that there would be no special treatment for VIPs in the temples of his state, reports our special correspondent. This is the DMK-led governments effort to ensure equality of all before God.

 We will not allow this practice (of offering parivattams) to continue in temples, Karunanidhi said. 

 He was speaking on a resolution to mourn the death of Hindu religious and charitable endowments minister P.T.R. Palanivel Rajan, who abhorred the practice of offering parivattams to special guests in temples.

hostel.

 Sabarimala plot whiff

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Thiruvananthapuram, Sept. 26: Police have got fresh leads pointing to a conspiracy behind Kannada actress Jaimalas claim that she had sneaked into the Sabarimala shrine and touched the Ayyappa idol in 1987.

 Women between puberty and menopause are barred from worshipping at the temple and no one, except the main priest, can enter the deitys precincts.

 The actresss disclosure came after an astrologer, P.U. Panicker, divined during a ritual at the temple that a woman had breached its sanctity. The Thazhamon family, which officiates at the temples rituals, had seen in this a plot to discredit them.

 Now, police sleuths have handed 

 a report to additional director-general (crimes) Jangpangi 

 saying Panicker and Jaimala (in picture) had known each 

 other for sometime. The duo had claimed to have been strangers 

 till Jaimala had called the astrologer a few months ago 

 to admit her folly.

 The police say they have evidence that Panicker visited Jaimalas home in Bangalore in 2004. The investigation has looked into why the Devaswom board drafted Panicker for the ritual without permission from Thazhamon supreme priest Kantararu Maheshwararu.

 It has gone into the possible motives for discrediting the family, and how Jaimala or Panicker could have gained from it.

 UK Hindu protest

 AMIT ROY

 London, Nov. 22: The President 

 of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev, who is on an official 

 visit to the UK, was picketed today outside the London Stock 

 Exchange by about 150 placard carrying Hindus who were protesting 

 about the alleged persecution of the small Hindu population 

 in his country.

 Yesterday, Hindu groups handed 

 in a petition to 10, Downing Street, ahead of Tony Blairs 

 talks with the Kazakh President.

 It is alleged that the homes and 

 cottages of Hindus as well as their temple in the Karasai 

 district of Kazakhstan are in the process of being demolished 

 by the authorities despite appeals from the Iskcon movement 

 to whom most of the Hindus appear to be linked.

 EC clean chit for Singh 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 10: The Election Commission today gave a clean chit to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in a case of alleged election code violation in Assam. 

 The BJP had alleged that on the eve of the first phase of Assembly polls in Assam, Singh had announced a financial package of Rs 602 crore for the rehabilitation of families of those killed or injured in last years tribal conflicts in the state.

 But Election Commission spokesperson R. Bhattacharya today said: It (the poll panel) did not find any evidence of substance as the speech of the Prime Minister did not contain any specific announcement of a financial package. 

 He said the poll panel was examining human resource development minister Arjun Singhs response on Other Backward Class quotas in central institutions. 

 Arjun, too, faces the charge of poll code violation for having announced plans for the quotas, but he has denied making any announcement.

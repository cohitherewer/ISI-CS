 Grad in tit-for-tat fraud

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, July 30: When Amit Kumar Chauhan fell victim to an e-shopping fraud a few years ago, he swore he would get even.

 For the 27-year-old computer repairman, however, revenge simply meant figuring out how the fraudster had duped him and using the technique to swindle other, unsuspecting online shoppers.

 Amit, a bachelor of business administration (BBA), was arrested here today for cheating a host of e-Bay customers out of Rs 12 lakh over six years.

 The lanky, quiet young man told police he had done it to buy a Honda. The car has been seized, and so have been 13 ATM cards only seven of which were issued against Amits own bank accounts.

 The police said that all Amit had needed to carry out the fraud were an old computer and a couple of mobile phones.

 The police had received a complaint from e-Bay when the company learnt after an initial probe that the fraud was being carried out from Lucknow.

 Amit, using his technical skill, would tap the highest bidders for items posted on the site by other, genuine sellers, Lucknow police chief S.K. Bhagat said. He and the prospective buyer would then agree a price and the money would be sent to one of Amits eight bank accounts. The promised article, of course, would never be delivered.

 We have sixteen forms of checks and balances. Yet some clever brains try to subvert all these. They get arrested too, said an e-Bay official.

 He added that two other frauds had earlier been arrested in Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Bring them out for 13-second justice 

 Deepika and (below) 

 her grandmother Vinduri 

 Deepika Mirchandani was 10 when she and her grandmother Vinduri Mirchandani were injured in the Century Bazaar explosion on March 12, 1993. Deepika reacts to the conviction of Abdul Gani Ismail Turk, who has been found guilty of planting and detonating the bomb.

 I am glad that the court has found Abdul Turk guilty, but it should not give him death penalty. 

 Bring these accused out in front of the public, especially in front of those families who have lost someone dear. Trust me, justice will be served in 13 seconds, instead of 13 years.

 I saw his (Turks) face on television. It burns me to see that this man was responsible for all the 100 stitches on my grandmother, who was wailing in her frail voice Bhagwan, mere ko bachao. It reminds me that even today, when a firecracker is burst outside my building, she gets shaken up.

 Because of this Abdul Turks act of violence, I had to (shift house and) wake up at 4.30 every morning to catch the first bus to my school from my cousins house. After school, I would go to our damaged house in Worli, where my grandmother, then 77, used to bring me lunch.

 After supervising the reconstruction of our flat, we used to return to my cousins place midnight everyday and wake up at 4 am.

 What kind of a life did I live as a 10-year-old? What all did my aunts go through at the time?

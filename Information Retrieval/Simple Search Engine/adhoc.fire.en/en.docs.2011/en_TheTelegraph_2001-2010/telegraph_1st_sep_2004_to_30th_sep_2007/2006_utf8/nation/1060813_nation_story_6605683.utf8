 Left inches towards uneasy N-truce

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 12: The Left parties may strike an uneasy truce with the Centre on the nuclear deal for the time being though its frictions on foreign policy are far from over.

 From indications, the UPA government is moving towards a patch-up with the Left over the statement the Prime Minister is going to make in the Rajya Sabha after a short duration discussion scheduled next Thursday.

 CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury has been discussing the statement with Manmohan Singh himself and Union defence minister Pranab Mukherjee. Sources say the talks are inching towards a consensus.

 It seems the UPA-Left standoff on the nuclear deal will not blow up into a political crisis this time. But the seeds of discontent over foreign policy have been sown among the Left parties. The CPM believes the nuclear deal is only a part of its problems with the UPA. 

 Left leaders say the growing US-Israel-India axis will widen the rift between them and the UPA. Their perception is that the government will continue to pursue a line that is more and more flexible towards the US establishment

 On the nuclear deal, the Left has categorically stated the Centre must spell out the parameters within which the negotiations have to take place. This means the Prime Minister has to take note of the nine points of departure in the US draft bill from the original Indo-US nuclear agreement signed in July last year.

 CPM general secretary Prakash Karat has struck a hard stance on the matter. The bottomline is that the Left will not accept a statement from the Prime Minister which does not spell out the parameters.

 In an article in the media, Karat has written: The key question is whether the statement would respond to the developments that have taken place since the Prime Ministers statement in Parliament on July 29, 2005. 

 A section of the ruling Congress would have liked to dodge the parameters. The Prime Minister was, in fact, pushing for a delay on the grounds that the Centre should wait for the final US bill before it took up the matter in Parliament.

 The CPM has refused to yield especially after being forced to abandon its initial idea of a resolution or a declaration that could have been adopted by both Houses of Parliament reaffirming their commitment to the joint nuclear agreement.

 In his article, Karat has hit out at the government for refusing to adopt a parliamentary procedure that would have expressed the sense of the House on the nuclear issue.

 What the people of India would like to know is why the UPA government is unwilling to have the nuclear deal disclosed in Parliament so that a common viewpoint emerges and that can be the sense of the House.

 The CPM general secretary has also taken a swipe at the Centre for trying to project the issue in the light of the Left lining up with BJP. This is side-stepping the issue.

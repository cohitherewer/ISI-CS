 Nervous Mulayam in February poll push

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mulayam Singh Yadav

 Lucknow, Nov. 20: For Mulayam Singh Yadav, April is the cruellest month to hold elections in Uttar Pradesh.

 No, its not because the chief minister feels the weather will be hotter and it will be difficult to appease farmers who fly off the handle when there is no power to run irrigation machines.

 Or because he feels tempers flare more easily in summer as the heat gets unbearable.

 The reason he is pushing for polls in February is because he has stirred up a populist wave by doling out cash for girl students and the unemployed and wants to make the most of it before it ebbs.

 The wave has yet to peak, but Mulayams programmes have been drawing large enthusiastic crowds of late. And he knows he stands a better chance to bag the votes before the anti- incumbency factor come back into play.

 So, he has been pleading with the Election Commission that the polls should not be put off till April but should be scheduled in February, when the term of the Assembly expires. 

 We dont want the tenure of the House to stretch beyond five years. The present House was constituted in February 2002, he said last Thursday after writing to the poll panel that it was the ideal time for elections.

 The panel has not officially responded yet. With the chief election commissioner expected to visit the state only on February 22, indications are the polls will be held some time in April, possibly because of logistical reasons.

 Mulayam is believed to be so pleased with the response his doles have been getting that he has been taking Opposition parties head on.

 At a programme in Allahabad, he said: I have spent Rs 1,100 crore so far on these two projects. The Opposition, which envies the success of these programmes, has no right to criticise me. This is peoples money and I am returning it to the people only.

 He then massaged the people a little more, saying he would double the unemployment dole if they voted him back to power.

 Adding to the Samajwadi Partys nervousness is the fact that it lost Muslim votes to the Congress during the civic elections. 

 The party has sought to stem the drift by rallying against the death penalty awarded to Saddam Hussein. Although this has softened the Sunnis, it has not cut any ice with the Shias.

 We are not as lucky as Bengals Left, which got a big response to its rally against Saddams death verdict, Mohan Singh, a Samajwadi Party MP, said.

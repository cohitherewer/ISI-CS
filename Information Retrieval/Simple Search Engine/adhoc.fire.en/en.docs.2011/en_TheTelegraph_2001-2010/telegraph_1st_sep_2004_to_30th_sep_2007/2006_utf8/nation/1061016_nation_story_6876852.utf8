The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Fewer troops, more teeth

 SUJAN DUTTA

 New Delhi, Oct. 15: The Indian armed forces have drawn up plans to downsize number and scale up firepower. 

 The navy chief, Admiral Arun Prakash, has told The Telegraph in an interview that numbers may come down but capabilities are set to increase with the implementation of the navys Maritime Capabilities Perspective Plan up to 2022.

 The disclosure comes even as the army gets ready to restructure its force. The army commanders conference held twice a year began on October 11 with a special session devoted to Force Restructuring Through Optimisation of Manpower.

 The first effects of the restructuring of manpower is likely to be on the Armed Forces Medical Services and the armys Signal Corps. 

 The Signal Corps, which last month commissioned a Rs 400-crore high-capacity communication network called Mercury Thunder, is also likely to be restructured because the digitised links do not require the digital soldiers to be deployed with tactical units on frontlines.

 The Indian Army is nearly 11-lakh strong but has a shortage of officers. 

 The navy has about 55,000 officers and sailors in its ranks but also has a substantial civilian workforce.

 In the interview, Admiral Prakash said the navy was looking to acquire capabilities at the cost of numbers for strategic and expeditionary units. 

 But numbers were important for coastal defence and terrorism-watch patrols near high-value sea assets like Bombay High. 

 The navy is looking for sophisticated ships 35 are in different stages of production within the country that will replace ageing ships. It wants a total of 60 warships capable of out-of-area operations. But at closer quarters the navy wants an expansion of the fleet of patrol boats and corvettes.

 We need the numbers for low-intensity conflict, he said. But the experience with Operation Sukoon the naval deployment in the Mediterranean that was used to evacuate Indians from Lebanon in July this year had illustrated the value of strategic reach.

 The naval deployment in the Mediterranean also coincided with a deployment of two vessels off Fiji. For the first time, the admiral said, the navy had demonstrated a capability to deploy afar at the same time in the west and in the east.

 The army commanders conference will conclude with the second chiefs conclave, a meeting of former army chiefs, to be held today and tomorrow at army headquarters.

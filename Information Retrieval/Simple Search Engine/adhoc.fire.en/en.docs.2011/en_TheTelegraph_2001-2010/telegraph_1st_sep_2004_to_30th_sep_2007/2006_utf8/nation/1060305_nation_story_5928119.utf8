 Weapon teams line up

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 4: The India-US civilian nuclear deal is being quickly followed up by Washington with a series of meetings, exchanges and drills planned to sell military hardware to India. 

 The first among these is the visit later this month by the Pentagons chief official in charge of military sales, Jeffrey Kohler.

 Kohler was in India three months ago to brief Indian officials on the processes under the US governments Foreign Military Sales programme. He will continue with the briefings. The next set of briefings is likely to focus on the missile defence system (Patriot III), multi-role combat aircraft and a special one on the joint strike fighter. The last is on a request from India.

 But the quick follow-up to the Bush visit does not guarantee that the US will win big-ticket hardware orders from India immediately even if the nuclear agreement does address a key Indian concern. Indian military planners have always doubted the US ability to supply weapons systems reliably because of sanctions in the past. That position is beginning to change.

 Just reflecting how complex military orders can be despite intensified lobbying by the US, defence minister Pranab Mukherjee today struck a note of caution. 

 The easy conclusion of the nuclear deal is that the pay-offs for the US will come from military sales. But that is not possible in the short run because of the competition involved, Indian preference for lowest price bidders and the fact that in the decades of denial by the US, India has built its arsenal mainly with Soviet (Russian) weapons.

 Mukherjee said in Calcutta: We have no territorial ambition and will not join any arms race, but will procure arms as per requirements for defence preparedness. He emphasised: India will decide what type of arms and weapons it requires in its defence system.

 When asked for comments on Jyoti Basus observation that Indias foreign policy was giving up the Nehruvian model, he said there was no change. But at the same time, it is true that foreign policy does not remain static. 

 The US is in competition for each of the three segments for which Kohlers team will conduct briefings: for missile defence, India is also in talks with Russia for the SV-300; for the multi-role aircraft, the global tender is being brought in line with a new offsets policy and US companies Lockheed Martin and Boeing are competing with Saab, MiG and the French with more likely to pitch in; India is also in talks with Russia to participate in its fifth generation fighter aircraft programme.

 Naval headquarters is also expected to be briefed by US officials again on the E2C Hawkeye aircraft. 

 The pay-offs for the US are most likely to be in the area of high technology cooperation. The India-US High Technology Cooperation Group is working on licences for dual-use technology exports to India.

 Gifts to keep allies in good humour

 New Delhi, Feb. 24: Railway minister Lalu Prasads budget may have turned into a Chhapra Express, with some 13 of the 55 new trains running to or from Bihar, but there was also a sugar-coated bid to keep allies from grumbling. 

 Congress president Sonia Gandhis constituency Rae Bareli in Uttar Pradesh received two new trains, one to Delhi and another to Pratapgarh. The state, where the Congress has an uneasy relationship with the ruling Samajwadi Party, has got two other trains as well.

 Although the Left is not formally part of the UPA government, Rail Bhawan did not ignore it, perhaps because elections are round the corner in the Left-ruled Kerala and Bengal.

 Bengal has bagged nine new trains, connecting places such as Muzaffarpur, Puri, Ranchi, Radhikapur, Jogbani and Darbhanga. 

 For Kerala, Lalu Prasad pulled out two trains from his bag ? linking Chennai and Thiruvananthapuram. 

 But for all his efforts, the minister could not make the Left parties happy. They chorused against his indifference and demanded more largesse. They were especially miffed at missing out on the Calcutta-Delhi freight corridor. 

 When the Left MPs from Bengal accused Lalu Prasad of being blatantly partial to his state, the minister retorted: Why does everybody shout about Bihar? We have given nine new trains to Bengal, too.

 The other state going to polls, Tamil Nadu, too, has pocketed a good share of the goodies. The state, where the DMK, part of the Congress-led ruling alliance, will be pitted against Jayalalithaas ADMK, got eight trains, including one of the three Garib Raths.

 Neighbouring Pondicherry, where Assembly polls will be held at the same time, has a new express weekly train connecting it with Bhubaneswar.

 A Garib Rath will also chug to Congress-ruled Maharashtra, apart from a Mumbai-Howrah train and another linking Pune and Lucknow.

 However, Andhra Pradesh, where the Congress has returned to power, did not get much. It has to be satisfied with just a weekly train connecting Visakhapatnam and Nizamabad.

 From the Northeast ? which has been crying hoarse that Lalu Prasad has cold- shouldered their transport woes ? Tripura had a reason to smile. The only new line in the region will go to the Left- ruled state.

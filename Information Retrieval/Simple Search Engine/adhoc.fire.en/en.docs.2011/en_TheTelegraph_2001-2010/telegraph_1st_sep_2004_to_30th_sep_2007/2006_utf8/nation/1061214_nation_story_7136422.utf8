 Nadeem seeks relief

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Nadeem

 Mumbai, Dec. 13: Music director Nadeem Akhtar Saifee today moved Bombay High Court seeking the cancellation of a non-bailable warrant and Interpols red corner notice against him in connection with the murder of T-Series owner Gulshan Kumar.

 Nadeem had earlier won an extradition battle in London. His father Yunus Saifee filed the petition today.

 Lawyers Majeed Memon and Ashok Mundargi will appear for Nadeem when the petition comes up on December 20.

 Nadeem, who has composed music with partner Shravan for several hits, has been living in London since Mumbai police named him as an accused in the August 1997 murder. The police claimed Nadeem was a prime conspirator and that Abu Salem had got the murder executed.

 Nadeem, then in London, refused to return while denying the charges. The police lost the extradition case after Nadeem expressed fears about a fair trial in India because of his religion.

 Yunus today argued that the non-bailable warrant, which led to his sons arrest in 1997 by London police, had become defunct as he had won the extradition case. He said the red-corner notice has also ceased to exist since his whereabouts were known to the investigating authorities in London and Mumbai.

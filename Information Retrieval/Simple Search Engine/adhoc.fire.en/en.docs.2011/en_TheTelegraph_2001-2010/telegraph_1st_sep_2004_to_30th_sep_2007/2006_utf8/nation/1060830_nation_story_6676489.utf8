The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Rush for song note

 R. KRISHNA DAS

 Raipur, Aug. 29: States ruled by the BJP have sought details of the circular the Chhattisgarh government issued on Monday to make the singing of Vande Mataram compulsory in all schools on September 7. 

 The Gujarat government has asked for copies of the order, said a senior official in Chhattisgarhs school education department, while other party-ruled states had called up authorities here asking for it. The copies will be sent in a day or two, he added. According to a senior party leader, the states sought the Chhattisgarh circular after a whip issued by the party leadership in Delhi. 

 Muslims in Chhattisgarh are divided on the issue of complying with the state governments diktat that made singing the national song mandatory in madarsas and schools managed by the community on September 7 to mark the 101st year of its adoption as the national song.

 The state madarsa board has issued the guidelines, but heads of individual institutions expressed reservations over the order.

 An official of the Nayapara Madarsa said higher authorities had issued fatwas against Muslims singing Vande Mataram as it went against Islam. How can we ignore the fatwa? We have our compulsions, he said. 

 The madarsa board, bound by the state governments orders, merely said it did what it was asked to. We have issued the order. Now it is up to them to follow or not, board chairman Adil Hameed Khan said. The board could not force madarsas to follow the guidelines, Khan added.

 However, state minority commission chairman Haji Inayat Ali appealed to the heads of madarsas and muslims in general to end their protests. There should not be a confrontation. Every Indian should be proud of reciting Vande Mataram, he added.

 BJP leader Vijay Kumar Malhotra told PTI tonight it will be difficult to monitor if the song was sung in madarsas because they were not under government control. It would be good if a madarsa allows singing of the national song but it should be compulsory in government and aided schools, he added.

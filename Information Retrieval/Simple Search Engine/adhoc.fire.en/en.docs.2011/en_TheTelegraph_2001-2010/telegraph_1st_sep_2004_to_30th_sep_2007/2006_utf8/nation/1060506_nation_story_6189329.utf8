 Srinagar, May 5: 

 Protests against a sex scandal, allegedly involving abuse 

 of minors by senior politicians and police officers, turned 

 violent this afternoon with a mob tearing down the house 

 of the main accused.

 Crowds emerging from downtown areas merged into a huge mob during a general strike against immorality that shut the Valley down, and headed towards the Chinkra Mohalla locality armed with crowbars, police said.

 The protesters, who said the police were going soft against the racketeers as their own officers were involved, braved teargas shells to force their way into the house of Sabina, the alleged lynchpin who is in police custody.

 Shouting pro-Islamic slogans, they broke the doors and windows, ransacked the house, threw out household items and burnt them on the street. Then with the crowbars and their bare hands, they pulled the house down.

 In other parts of Srinagar, hundreds demonstrated against immorality and obscenity, giving the police a tough time after the Friday prayers.

 Late in the evening, the government handed the case over to the CBI, citing as reason the alleged involvement of senior police officers.

 The sex scandal first made headlines with the discovery of a 30-second smut CD in Srinagar in March. Two minor girls then came out with sex abuse charges against two former ministers, a deputy inspector-general of a paramilitary force and some senior policemen, with one of them alleging she had been forced into prostitution.

 The police arrested five persons, including Sabina, of whom two are out on bail. Jammu and Kashmir High Court has taken suo motu cognisance of the scandal and ordered it to be listed before the court.

 Todays general strike was called by traders and manufacturers and supported by the Dukhtaran-e-Milat, a separatist womens group that had earlier cracked down on sex workers and liquor shops. 

 Backed also by several other social and political bodies, including the hardline faction of the Hurriyat, the strike closed down all markets, public transport, schools, banks and offices in the Valley.

 Demonstrations were held at Lal Chowk, Residency Road, Jehangir Chowk, Nowhatta, Hazratbal, Bemina and Batmaloo in Srinagar. Reports of peaceful protests came from other districts, too.

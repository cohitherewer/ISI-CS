 Doctors fined for faulty surgery

 New Delhi, March 26 (PTI): Three doctors have been ordered to pay Rs 50,000 in compensation to an accident victim for a faulty dental surgery which led to temporary loss of the function of his jaws.

 Observing that it is unfortunate that the complainant fell into the hands of the doctors, who had acted carelessly, the district consumer disputes redressal forum (north), comprising president K.K. Chopra and members Neeru Mittal and R.K. Prabhakar, told the doctors to reimburse almost Rs 2 lakh spent on remedial treatment. The trio was also told to pay Rs 5,000 as litigation costs.

 Complainant Sumit Uppal met with an accident on the night of May 19, 2003, while travelling on his scooter and suffered multiple fractures on the face and jaw.

 He was rushed to the Maan hospital where he was given first aid by a doctor, Prem Aggarwal, and referred to the Sanjeevan hospital.

 Aggarwal told the Uppal family that Sanjeevan hospital was fully equipped to handle such accident cases.

 At Sanjeevan, plastic surgeon H.D. Manke and senior doctor V.K. Sehdev recommended immediate surgery as the victim had fractured six jaw bones and the broken splinters were causing breathing difficulty.

 Uppal spent 10 days in post-operative care at the two hospitals under the supervision of the three doctors.

 However, he started experiencing a pain in his jaws, forcing him to switch to a liquid diet. On further consultations, he came to know that the earlier operation was a sham.

 Responding to Uppals contentions, the doctors said the surgery they had performed was a life-saving one and the complainant was alright at the time of discharge. 

 They added that Uppal himself had, against medical advice, requested the stitches on his mouth to be removed prematurely.

 The court held that the surgery was a complete failure and ordered the doctors to pay Rs 1,99,025 as medical expenses and a compensation of Rs 50,000.

 Mollah: Tall talk

 Calcutta, Oct. 16: The 

 state must force real-estate developers to go in for skyscrapers, 

 switching to vertical construction from horizontal 

 expansion to get around the land shortage, Abdur Rezzak 

 Mollah said today.

 The CPM seemed to welcome the land and land reforms ministers proposal, saying the Indonesian Salim Group could be asked to implement the policy in its upcoming township projects.

 I want to introduce the idea of space management instead of land management keeping in mind the rising demand for land for real estate as well as industry and infrastructure. This, however, is my personal opinion, Mollah said at Writers Buildings.

 This is the need of the hour to meet the crisis of land. I will place this idea before the government as well as my party. Let the matter be debated, Mollah said.

 He said the upper middle class, the main clientele of real estate developers, is accustomed to living in high-rises and would be able to afford vertical construction.

 If the government brings legal changes making vertical construction mandatory, urbanisation would come at a lower cost to agriculture, the minister said.

 Mollah, known for his opposition to acquisition of farmland for real estate or industry, wants the same rules followed when industries build employees quarters.

 He, however, admitted that the manufacturing industries cannot be housed in vertical buildings, and said the government should work out the land requirements keeping in mind the nature of the industries.

 An IT or ITES companys land needs cannot match that of a car factory, Mollah said.

 CPM state secretariat member Benoy Konar said the party would indeed prefer vertical expansion of real estate projects.

 We will discuss Rezzaks proposal after he submits it to the party. We would prefer highrises with lifts in case of planned urbanisation projects to save on land. The Salim Group can implement this policy in the upcoming township projects, Konar said.

 RSP leader Debabrata Banerjee today met Left Front chairman Biman Bose and discussed issues relating to land acquisition for the Tata project in Singur as well as for Salim and Reliances agro-marketing projects. The CPMs allies had earlier voiced reservations over acquisition of farmland for industrial use.

 Sealing judge hangs up his boots

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 18: Chief Justice Y.K. Sabharwal, who will retire before the next hearing on the sealing issue takes place, has revealed that even his relatives in Delhi were affected by his orders aimed at preventing the commercial use of residential properties in the capital. 

 Sabharwal, hearing the case for the last time today before he retires on January 14, said he was bound by his oath of office to enforce laws not being implemented by the government. 

 So long as the laws are there, the government has to see that they are implemented. If not, it is the duty of the court to see that they are implemented, said Sabharwal, who enforced his order on the sealing drive with a heavy hand.

 I have relatives in Delhi who were affected by the orders, he said. 

 Referring obliquely to the notifications issued by the government to exempt certain areas from the sealing drive, the chief justice said he hoped the regime would enforce the law now onwards.

 A resident of Delhi, Sabharwal said he was well aware of the problems created due to blatant violation of laws. 

 When solicitor-general G.E. Vahanvati sought at least three more months for filing of affidavits by defaulters, as ordered by the court, Sabharwal said in a lighter vein: Obviously, after January. 

 To this, Vahanvati said he would be the last person to think of that. I have the highest regard for your lordship. 

 Finally, Sabharwal set the next hearing in February.

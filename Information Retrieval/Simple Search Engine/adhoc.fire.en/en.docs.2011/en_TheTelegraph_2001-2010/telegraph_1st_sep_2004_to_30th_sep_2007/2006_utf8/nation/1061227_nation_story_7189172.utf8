 Home truths for Cong trio

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 Digvijay

 New Delhi, Dec. 26: They were counted among the Congresss most promising second-rung leaders. But that was before Digvijay Singh, Ashok Gehlot and Ajit Jogi lost their turf to the BJP three years ago.

 Never known to be kind to failures, the party brass subtly but surely moved them out of their states either to Delhi or nudged them to the margins of politics.

 Digvijay and Gehlot were appointed AICC general secretaries and put in charge of states like Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.

 Jogi had a series of personal and political setbacks, but was nevertheless the only Congressman to win a seat in Chhattisgarh in the 2004 Lok Sabha elections. But little has been heard of the former chief minister since.

 Congress sources said as the UPA government entered its third year, the three leaders were beginning to give up on Delhi and set their sights on their home ground: Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh.

 One reason, the sources said, was that it was unlikely any of them would find a berth in the Union cabinet. Second, they realised that an organisational position sounds great but translates into nothing tangible. So if they wanted to remain relevant to the people, they would have to be more visible in their areas of work.

 Digvijays confidants admitted that a central minister like Kamal Nath had more clout than him in Madhya Pradesh. Although Digvijay officially maintains that he would not return to lead the Congress in the next elections, his frequent political visits to his state were noticed and commented on by the partys Delhi leaders. 

 The view is the once unchallenged leader is fighting with his back to the wall to preserve his domain.

 Gehlot, who was put in charge of Uttar Pradesh, is back to doing what he was dying to: play the role of Opposition leader in Rajasthan. The sources, however, were not sure whether he would be allowed to as the perception remains that the party lost the last polls because Jats were upset at the projection of an OBC chief minister.

 As for Jogi, his wife Renus recent win from the Koda Assembly seat has helped him prove the point that he still matters in Chhattisgarh.

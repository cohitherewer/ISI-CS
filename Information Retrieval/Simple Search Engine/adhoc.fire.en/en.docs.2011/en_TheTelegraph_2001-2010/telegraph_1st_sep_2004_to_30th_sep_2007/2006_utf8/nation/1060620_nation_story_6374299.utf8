 Board admits ice lingam tampering

 AGENCIES AND OUR BUREAU

 Jammu/Srinagar, June 19: The chief executive of the Amarnath shrine board today conceded the Shiva lingam in the holy cave had been tampered with amid demands from religious leaders that the truth be made public.

 We received complaints that some people had brought some snow and put it on top of the usual Shiva lingam. We dont defend that but this is something that has happened in the past, board chief executive Arun Kumar said.

 Acknowledging the board had received a complaint on June 7, he told a TV channel: There were some dirt marks. We cleared all that. We raised the grid to almost five feet. We put a lock. Our people are out there, so that no further tampering takes place.

 But he was quick to add: Our belief is that the Shiva lingam has naturally formed, howsoever small it may be.

 Board chairman and Kashmir governor S.K. Sinha, however, insisted there was no artificial lingam.

 I inaugurated the yatra on the 11th. All of you in the media were there. No one said anything at that time. Now suddenly, there is all this controversy. What is all the fuss about? Sinha asked.

 But tempers flared among religious leaders as hurt pilgrims demanded to know what had happened.

 Mahant Deependra Giri, custodian of the holy mace of Lord Shiva, said a judicial commission headed by a Supreme Court judge should probe the act of sacrilege.

 I dont know who ordered it but whosoever has done it is to be awarded exemplary punishment, for his act has deeply hurt the sentiments of Hindus across the world, he said.

 Explaining that the cave was not a picnic spot but a highly revered shrine, he said such reprehensible acts should not be committed to attract pilgrims.

 He said people had been calling him up and venting their feelings. The callers tell me the lingam looks altogether different. I have also received photographs that endorse the complaints.

 Terming the controversy a direct assault on Hinduism, the leader of the Baba Amarnath Yatra Nyas, Sudarshan Gupta, urged authorities to inquire into the matter and involve religious heads in the probe.

 Chandigarh, Aug. 30: Two days after a college teacher slapped a student for daring to speak on a mobile in her presence, the authorities and students have worked out a truce that allows restricted use of cellphones on campus.

 On Monday, students of the Sector 36 MCM DAV College had taken to the streets after woman lecturer Jagdish Bains slapped BA student Shivani Verma. Today, principal Puneet Bedi said a compromise had been reached.

 Students will not be allowed to speak on cellphones in the corridors and classrooms or near my office. They can only use them in the rear grounds. No cellphone with a camera or Bluetooth will be allowed, Bedi said.

 Earlier, there was a complete ban on use of mobiles by students on the college premises while professors and lecturers could use them wherever they wanted.

 Other colleges in the city allow students to use cellphones provided they are kept in silent mode in classrooms and libraries. In Calcutta, there is a complete ban on cellphones in schools and colleges, including professional institutes.

 Girl students said their mobiles made them feel secure.

 In a city that regards college girls as objects for harassment, its the cellphone that comes in handy to seek help, said Namrata Gill.

 If things get bad, we can use the cellphone as a weapon, too. What is the need to ban them when they are so helpful?

 Shivani agreed: Having a cellphone gives us a comforting sense of ready communication with those who are close to us. We feel secure.

 The lecturer hasnt publicly apologised to Shivani for slapping her, but has vowed not to repeat her behaviour.

 Im happy that a compromise has been reached. I didnt realise the incident would spark a major debate. With changing times, the attitude of the authorities must also change, Shivani said.

 The incident has led a school principal to come up with an innovative idea for her own institution.

 Rakesh Sachdeva has promised lockers for cell-wielding students at the Sector 15 DAV Public School.

 We are aware that mobile phones have become a necessity for senior students. Many of them leave their homes early in the morning for tuition and again attend coaching classes after school, Sachdeva said.

 She added that many students reach their homes late in the evening; some of them live 20-odd kilometres away.

 They need to talk to their parents during the day. We only need to draw a line on cellphone misuse. Lockers dont mean keeping the phones away. Provisions will be made for making calls.

 Sex workers shun legal stamp

 New Delhi, Sept. 6: The majority of sex workers in India do not want to legalise their occupation though it may give them rights they do not have. Instead, they want to keep their identity anonymous to escape social segregation.

 One of the main reasons behind the sex workers resistance to legalisation lies in the fact that the dominant form of the sex industry has changed. Only 10 per cent of three million sex workers now work out of brothels. The rest of them are mobile with no fixed workplace, says an official in the child and womens welfare ministry.

 Mobile sex workers earn more than those in brothels since they can move from place to place and get clients who pay better. They can keep their identity a secret especially a section which has voluntarily chosen the profession to earn extra money.

 A study conducted by K.K. Mukherjee, head of the social work department in Delhi University, says: They (mobile sex workers) recognise they are in the market but do not want to be branded. They make utmost efforts to keep their profession a secret in an effort to have a normal life.

 The report is based on a survey of 9,500 sex workers in 31 states and Union territories. The report underlines the shifting patterns in the sex industry.

 The emerging forms of prostitution in cities and towns are call girls, brothel sex workers and commuting and highway sex workers, says the report. It says the number of girls and women in the sex trade has increased 50 per cent in between 1997 and 2002-03. 

 Similarly, the number of girls and women in the sex trade in the metro cities has doubled.

 Mobile sex workers function as individuals who are part of a network. They function at hostels, restaurants, motels and cyber cafes. There are no fixed working hours. These could stretch from six hours to whole-day engagements. Majority of them work 16-25 days in a month, says the report.

 Their income varies from Rs 2,000 to Rs 80,000 a month. A sex worker from a street or a brothel can earn anything between Rs 2,000 and Rs 24,000 a month while a call girl Rs 40,000 to Rs 80,000. 

 Festival and marriage months are the best months for business. Political rallies add to the business. Hi-tech methods like mobile phones, emails and fax are used to contact and lure clients, says the report.

 Legalisation of prostitution has been one of the passionately contested areas with womens organisations split down the middle on the need for legalisation. A law can entitle sex workers to police protection, health benefits, better wages, even pension. But they will have to register themselves on the basis of which they will be issued licences.

 There is a rift among sex workers on the issue of legalisation. Red light area brothel sex workers in almost all areas approve the idea of licensing while street and home prostitutes who form the majority do not often approve, the study says.

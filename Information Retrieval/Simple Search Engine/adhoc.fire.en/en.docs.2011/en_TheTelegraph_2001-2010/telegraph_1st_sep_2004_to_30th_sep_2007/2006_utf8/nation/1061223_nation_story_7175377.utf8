 PC games for math skills

 Play and Learn

 New Delhi, Dec. 22: Next time your child refuses to do math, you can let him play computer games. It may help him equally.

 A study by Poverty Action Lab of Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in India has shown that computer-assisted learning and community teachers can improve learning skills among primary school students.

 Poverty Action Lab and Pratham, one of the largest NGOs working in education, together conducted two random projects in Mumbai and Vadodara. The main objective was to identify strategies to meet one of the biggest challenges in primary education the dismal quality of education that most poor children receive.

 In Vadodara, only 19.5 per cent of the students enrolled in grade III can correctly answer questions testing grade I math competencies, say the authors of the project.

 Poverty Action Lab devised two remedial programmes for weak students from poor families in Mumbai and Vadodara.

 In the first, a young woman from the community (balsakhi) spends two hours every day with the weakest children after regular classes. The balsakhis treat the children with respect and care in contrast to the indifferent attitude their schoolteachers often show.

 The balsakhis are given a two-week training by Pratham. They are then provided with a standardised curriculum that focuses on core competencies like basic number and literacy skills. Normally the children should have learned these in the first and second grades.

 The second programme, meant not just for the weakest but all the children, involves computer-assisted learning. Children in class IV are offered two hours of shared computer time per week. They play computer games that require them to solve math problems.

 This programme was carried out only in Vadodara and not in Mumbai, after Pratham provided computer training to a team of community volunteers for two weeks.

 The instructors encouraged each child to play games that challenged the students level of comprehension. When necessary, they helped individual children understand the tasks required of them by the game, says the project paper.

 Both the balsakhi and computer-assisted learning programmes are cheap. A balsakhi is paid Rs 500 to Rs 700 a month about half the salary of a regular teacher. The computer-assisted programme costs about Rs 722 per student every year. This includes the cost of computers.

 Evaluations conducted in the two cities over two years show that both programmes are effective.

 The average test scores of children improved by 14 per cent in the first year and 28 per cent in the second year, MIT says.

 The results suggest the programmes could dramatically improve the quality of education.

 An encouraging result, since a large fraction of children in India cannot read when they leave school, MIT says.

 Kashmir spots 

 new paradise

 - Bangus beckons

 MUZAFFAR RAINA

Srinagar, Nov. 17: Holidaying in paradise may not be the same again.

 A part of Kashmir without roads or homes, where shepherds, infiltrating militants and troops are the lone visitors, is set to lift the veil off its unspoilt beauty before the sightseer and adventure lover.

 Bangus valley, a 300-sq-km pastiche of grass bowls, streams and rangy mountains close to the Line of Control, has been off-limits for the past six decades because of cross-border hostilities. But with the guns falling silent on the frontier, the state government has decided to put the Bangus Valley Biosphere on the global tourist map.

 Its being developed as a prime tourist resort without disturbing its natural layout, said Sarmad Hafeez, joint director, tourism department.

Which means you can neither stay in this north Kashmir valley in Kupwara, 89 km from Srinagar, nor drive to it.

 The last 8.5 km from Reshwari the nearest place with human settlements on the route has no roads and will not have any. The project report by the Indian National Trust for Art, Culture and Heritage (Intach) bars any infrastructure being built beyond Reshwari so that Bangus can retain its pristine beauty.

 A chair-lift will take people beyond this point. Adventure lovers will prefer to walk the distance, said Mohammad Saleem Beig, convener of Intachs Kashmir chapter and former state tourism director-general. Beig promises that the trouble will be worth it.

 The Bangus valley ( in picture) 

 is a 76-sq-km rectangular bowl ringed by the lofty Shamsbari, 

 Rajwar and Mawar ranges. It would take a trekker 10 

 days to walk around the valley. There is potential for adventure 

 tourism, trekking, camping, skiing, fishing and a lot more. 

 It has 50 species of animals, including musk deer, antelope, 

 snow leopards, red foxes and bears, Beig said.

 Our strategy is to attract tourists who can spend $100 (about Rs 4,500) a day. Well provide them with tents, ponies, guides as well as food.

 Even Beigs knowledge of Bangus is new. The first survey came in August when four experts from Intach, a body dedicated to the preservation of arts and heritage, travelled to the valley. 

 We are awaiting the (Union tourism) ministrys approval. The chair-lift and allied infrastructure will cost just Rs 10 crore, Beig said.

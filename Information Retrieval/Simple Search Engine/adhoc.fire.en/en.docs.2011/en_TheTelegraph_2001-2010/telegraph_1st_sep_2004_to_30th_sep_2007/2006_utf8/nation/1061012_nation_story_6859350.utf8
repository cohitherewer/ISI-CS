 No action against Barak supplier

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Delhi, Oct. 11: Call it the Barak boomerang. 

 Defence sources today practically ruled out taking action against Israeli companies that have been alleged by the CBI to have paid bribes to win the Barak missile deal. Taking action against such important suppliers can be counter-productive for national security, a senior defence official said.

 The defence ministrys stand amounts to a virtual rejection of the CPMs demand that the Israeli company which offered kickbacks must also be proceeded against.

 The government and the CBI should not ignore the bribe-givers in this case. The Israeli company which offered kickbacks must be proceeded against to start with. It should be prohibited from future transactions, the CPM politburo said in a statement issued earlier in the day. 

 The Left party, a key outside supporter of the UPA government, said it should not ignore the fact that there are widespread reports of Israeli arms companies, which have become the second-largest supplier of defence equipment to India, resorting to illegal methods, including bribery. 

 The defence official, however, made it clear that unlike the South African company Denel, with whom transactions were frozen last year after investigators in Pretoria suspected it had paid middlemen to win an Indian anti-materiel rifle contract, Israel Aircraft Industries, the principal supplier of the Barak missile systems to the navy, will not be punished.

 Transactions with Bofors were also frozen for years to the detriment of the armys artillery regiments after allegations of kickbacks surfaced in 1987. 

 But Israel is deeply embedded in the Indian military and its equipment is deemed to be absolutely necessary because of Indias threat perceptions. The Israeli military-industrial complex has a big stake in Indias defence pie.

 Within the next fortnight, the Cabinet Committee on Security is expected to consider issuing a Rs 1,150-crore order to the Israelis for the Spydere missile defence system.

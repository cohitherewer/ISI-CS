 EC jitters for Mulayam

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, Nov. 23: Mulayam Singh Yadavs bid for February polls in Uttar Pradesh suffered a setback today with the chief election commissioner saying the elections might be deferred.

 The cut-off date for the polls is May 14 and my constitutional obligation is to hold it before that date, N. Gopalaswamy told reporters here.

 Asked about the Uttar Pradesh chief ministers letter urging the Election Commission to hold the polls in February, he said: We receive inputs from all political parties but the final decision is ours. There are instances when we have deferred (the poll date beyond that suggested by the state government), and we can defer here also, if needed.

 In 2003, the Telugu Desam Party government in Andhra Pradesh did not have its wish granted, and a year later, it was Gujarats turn. The Narendra Modi government even moved the Supreme Court, but to no avail. The apex court said the power of deciding poll dates rests entirely with the Election Commission.

 Mulayam has been pushing for early polls to reap the maximum benefit out of schemes like cash for girl students and the unemployed.

 Gopalaswamy said he would discuss the dates with his fellow commissioners after he goes back to Delhi and take a decision at an appropriate time. The chief election commissioner, who met representatives of all parties here, said while some of them were in favour of February polls, others cited events like the Ardh Kumbh in Allahabad and the board examinations as reasons why they should be held later.

 The poll panel would have to consider the main bathing days at the Ardh Kumbh that would extend from January to February, he said. Besides, the secondary education board has already announced that the high school and intermediate examinations will begin on March 17, 2007. As the tests would be over only in the third week of April, the poll panel would be left with little time to complete the election process, Gopalaswamy added.

 Gopalaswamy also mentioned the string of tasks to be completed, such as revision of poll lists and issue of photo-identity cards.

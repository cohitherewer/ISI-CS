 District tag on terror cradle

 Tarn Taran: The Punjab government bestowed district status on Tarn Taran on Friday, making it the 19th in the state, reports our correspondent.

 The move came on the day thousands of Sikhs thronged this border town ? once the cradle of terrorism and the erstwhile capital of Khalistan ? to mark the 400th anniversary of Arjan Devs martyrdom. The founder of Tarn Taran, Arjan Dev was the fifth Sikh guru. 

 Political parties, however, turned the religious platform into an election plank.

 The Shiromani Akali Dal held a convention where Simranjit Singh Mann demanded the revival of the 1973 Anandpur Sahib resolution seeking a separate, independent state for Sikhs. He asked BJP chief Rajnath Singh, who was present at the meet, to work for its creation.

 Pilgrims smelt a political motive in the Congress governments move. This is not the occasion to play politics. The announcement of granting district status to Tarn Taran could have been made on a different date, said Sharan Singh, who has come from Malerkotla. 

 Rakhi moves womens panel

 New Delhi (PTI): Rakhi Sawant 

 has approached the National Commission for Women with a 

 complaint of sexual assault against bhangra singer 

 Mika.

 The Bollywood item girl, in her complaint which she e-mailed to the commission on Thursday, said Mika brutally assaulted me and forcibly smooched me, commission sources said. 

 Rakhi said she was lodging the complaint as the singer publicly in front of the media insulted me and sexually assaulted me.

 The commission will take note of the complaint after its chairperson Girija Vyas, currently in Rajasthan, returns to Delhi. Vyas could possibly conduct a personal hearing, the sources added.

 More schools

 New Delhi: The cabinet has 

 approved the opening of 50 new Kendriya Vidyalayas in the 

 country and increased the allocation for mid-day meals for 

 primary schools. 

 As many as 84 Kendriya Vidyalayas, opened during the past two years, have also been regularised. There are 928 Kendriya Vidyalayas in the country. 

 Sacred row

 Mumbai (PTI): Bombay High 

 Court will watch the film Sacred Evil and go through 

 its screenplay and the book by Ipsita Ray Chakravarti on 

 which it is based. The court, hearing a plea by Garry Coelho, 

 will decide if additional guidelines need to be framed when 

 the censor clears films on sensitive religious topics, Coelhos 

 counsel said.

 Polio case

 Budaon (PTI): One more polio 

 case has surfaced in Uttar Pradesh with the WHOs team 

 detecting a two-year-old girl affected with it in the district.

 Filmmaker Adoor Gopalakrishnan has won the 

 Crystal Pyramid, an award for excellence in cinema given 

 by the London-based South Asian Cinema Foundation.

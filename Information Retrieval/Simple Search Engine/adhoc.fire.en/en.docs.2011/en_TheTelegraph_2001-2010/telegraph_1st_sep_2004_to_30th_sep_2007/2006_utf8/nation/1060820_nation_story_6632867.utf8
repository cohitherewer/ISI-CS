 Liquor ad apology on hold

 ASHWANI TALWAR

 New Delhi, Aug. 19: After cracking the whip on TV channels for advertising liquor and tobacco by proxy, the information and broadcasting ministry has retreated.

 Last week, it sent a notice to 43 channels asking them to run an apology as a scroll across the screen round the clock from August 18 to 21.

 But the broadcasters lobby has managed to wriggle out of the humiliation. The order punishing them for carrying surrogate advertisements has been deferred and will be reviewed by the ministry.

 The ministry has also pulled back on another front concerning advertisements on television. On July 31, it came out with a directive limiting commercials to 12 minutes every hour, including two minutes for a channels own promotion. An official said that directive, too, is on hold.

 The warning on surrogate ads had been issued on August 11 when the ministry decided to act against commercials that indirectly promoted alcohol and tobacco as in ads for bottled water with the same brand name and logo of a whisky.

 Quoting the Cable Television Networks Rules, 1994, the ministry made it clear that it had caught on with the under-hand promotion. It asked the channels to run an apology, saying: Ministry of information amp; broadcasting issues a warning to (name) channel for telecasting surrogate advertisements of liquor/tobacco products in violation of advertising code. (Name) channel regrets this and apologises for the same. We assure to be more careful in future.

 The directive was deferred by Priya Ranjan Das Munshi after representatives of broadcasters met the I amp;B minister on August 14.

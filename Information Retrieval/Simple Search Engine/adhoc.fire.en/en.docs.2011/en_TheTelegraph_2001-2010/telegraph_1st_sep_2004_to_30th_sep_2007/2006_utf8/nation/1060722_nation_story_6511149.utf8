 India asks Pak to act

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, July 21: India today asked Pakistan to match its actions to its words about a joint fight against terror, and hand over Hizbul Mujahideen chief Syed Salahuddin and gangster Dawood Ibrahim.

 The demand came a day after President Pervez Musharraf appeared on TV and offered to help the Mumbai blast probe and fight terrorism together. He urged India not to let the terrorists win by stalling the peace process.

 But Delhi said the responsibility for reviving the dialogue lay with Pakistan.

India remains committed to the dialogue process? but this can be sustained or yield results only if Pakistan acts against terrorist groups operating from territories under its control, foreign ministry spokesman Navtej Sarna said.

 Syed Salahuddin, who is freely roaming in Pakistan and in PoK... should be arrested and handed over to India.

 Delhi demanded that Pakistan also ban another militant group, Jamat-ud-Dawa, allegedly a front for Mumbai blast suspect Lashkar-e-Toiba. Dawood Ibrahim, who has been listed by the UN security councils 1267 committee as an individual associated with al Qaida, should be arrested and deported to India.

 Pakistan rejected the demands, scoffing that all India had to say 10 days after the blasts was a rehash of the old charges against Dawood and Salahuddin. It demonstrates there was nothing to warrant the irresponsible act of finger-pointing at Pakistan immediately after the Mumbai attack, Islamabad said.

 Earlier, Sarna had said that Musharrafs offer of cooperation if provided with evidence gave India no cause for satisfaction because in the past when we have provided evidence, there has been no practical action.

 Officials said that at the recent home secretary-level talks, India had passed on evidence linking Pakistan-based groups to terror attacks, including clinching proof relating to last years pre-Diwali Delhi blasts. Yet Islamabad hadnt acted.

 We will continue to provide all the evidence and await practical steps on the ground, Sarna said.

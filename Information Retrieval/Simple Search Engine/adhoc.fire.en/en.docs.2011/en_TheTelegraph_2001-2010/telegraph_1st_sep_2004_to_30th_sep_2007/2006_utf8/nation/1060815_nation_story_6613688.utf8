The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Tea with sniper 

 CHARU SUDAN KASTURI

 New 

 Delhi, Aug. 14: Every morning, Shamshad Hussain 

 goes to his rooftop, just opposite Red Fort, to enjoy a 

 cup of tea after the azaan, his ears catching strains 

 of prayers from the nearby Jama Masjid.

 Today, he carried two cups the second was for the sniper on the rooftop.

 I doubt anyone would know better the meaning of celebrating Independence Day in these times of terror, he says, gazing at the freshly painted red and white domes of Red Fort, from where the Prime Minister will address the nation tomorrow.

 Shamshad, who works at a cloth shop in Chandni Chowk, was greeted by a posse of policemen when he came back from work two days ago. 

 They searched our house, while we were asked to wait outside. The search over, the sniper was stationed on the roof.

 Every house in the predominantly Muslim areas of Daryaganj and Chandni Chowk that surround Red Fort has been searched and the identities of residents verified.

 For Shamshad and thousands of other residents of the Walled City that surrounds the Red Fort August 15 is a happy occasion, but it is also a day they wish to get over with.

 For them, the day is one of pride tinged with the pain of being watched, says Shehnaz Rasool Begum, who teaches English in a nearby public school.

 It is the day our country became independent. Yet, it is also the day of the year when we feel like prisoners, she says, getting ready to leave for work.

 Shehnaz would know. Her younger brother Shamshul was detained briefly by police a couple of years ago when he refused to cooperate with the house-to-house searches.

 I was hot headed then. Now I understand that the policemen are only doing their job, says Shamshul, now 22 and a graduate in maths from Delhi University.

 Rahim Khan, 78, remembers catching a glimpse of Jawaharlal Nehru. Our rooftop gave me and my brothers a birds eye view of the proceedings at the Red Fort. I remember Nehruji waving to all of us as he arrived. We, of course, waved back, he says.

 No one in the area is allowed outdoors during the Red Fort celebrations, but Rahim says the ritual of seeing the PM on Independence Day continues. The difference is nowadays it has to be on television.

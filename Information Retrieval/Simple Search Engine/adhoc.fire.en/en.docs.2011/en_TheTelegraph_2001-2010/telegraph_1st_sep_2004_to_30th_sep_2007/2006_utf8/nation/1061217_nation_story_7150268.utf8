 Claimant age key in crash damages

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 16: The money to be paid as compensation to the parents of an accident victim depends on the age of the claimants and not the deceased, the Supreme Court has ruled.

 The order came from a bench headed by Justice Arijit Pasayat, which reduced to Rs 5 lakh the compensation awarded to the parents of Zoremsangi, who lost her life in a 1997 road accident while travelling from Mumbai to Pune by bus.

 The Indian Information Service officer was 31 when she died.

 Zoremsangis mother had claimed a compensation of Rs 15 lakh. Taking into account the salary and the age of the victim, the Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal awarded Rs 12 lakh.

 The apex court, however, said the parameters considered by the tribunal for assessing the quantum of compensation was wrong. 

 It noted that a higher compensation had been awarded on the basis of the victims young age, despite the fact that age is irrelevant in cases where the compensation is claimed by the parents.

 Further, the court said, there was nothing to show that the parents were dependent on the victims income.

 The high court had dismissed the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporations appeal on technical grounds. In its appeal before the apex court, the corporation said there was nothing to show in the claim petition that Zoremsangis mother was dependent on her. On the contrary, she was the wife of the chief secretary of Mizoram.

 The corporation also said the victim did not stay with her parents and there was no material to show that she contributed to household expenses.

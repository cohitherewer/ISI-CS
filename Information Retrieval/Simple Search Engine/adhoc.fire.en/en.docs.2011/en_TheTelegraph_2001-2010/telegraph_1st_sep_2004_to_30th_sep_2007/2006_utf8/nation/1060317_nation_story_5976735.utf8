 Safe Sonia picks loyalists

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 16: Congress president Sonia Gandhi has played safe in the nomination of candidates for the Rajya Sabha election.

 Like the BJP, the Congress picked loyalists, veterans and those with the potential to send the right social signals over individuals with glamour and money.

 Sources said the only streak of adventurism was naming Madhya Pradesh veteran Satyavrat Chaturvedi from Uttaranchal, where the party unit is dead against outsiders.

 Chaturvedi is close to Sonia, though he had a brush with bad luck when he was dropped as a general secretary in the reconstituted AICC in January and stripped of the charge of Uttar Pradesh. Sonia, however, retained him in the Congress Working Committee as a permanent invitee with independent charge.

 Rajiv Shukla, who was eyeing a nomination from Uttaranchal, had to settle for Maharashtra.

 All the ministers in the House ? Shinde, Hans Raj Bhardwaj, Arjun Singh and Dasari Narayan Rao ? have been chosen.

 After Chaturvedi, the second surprise was the selection of Abhishek Singhvi from the lone seat in Rajasthan. Till last night, industrialist R.P. Goenka was tipped to be renominated. Apparently, the Congress brass decided it was time to reward the spokesperson hailing from Rajasthan, who is perceived as the partys counter to the BJPs Arun Jaitley. 

 Apart from loyalty, the social aspect seems to have scored with Sonia. 

 Rashid Alvi bagged a second nomination from Andhra though he belongs to Uttar Pradesh. The Andhra unit is crying foul, but the Congress president had her reasons. 

 She had promised Alvi a second term when he switched over from the Bahujan Samaj Party. The second reason was to neutralise the anger over the state governments failure to implement the pre-poll promise of job reservation for Muslims.

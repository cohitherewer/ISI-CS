 Hidden hint in IIT prize

 - DMK makes quota point by honouring scientist

 M.R. VENKATESH

 Kandasamy

 Chennai, Aug. 14: When chief minister M. Karunanidhi presents the Kalpana Chawla Award to Vasantha Kandasamy tomorrow, it would be a symbolic salvo at the central government.

 Vasantha, an assistant professor of mathematics at IIT Madras, is from the other backward classes and the award comes at a time when a debate is raging on 27 per cent reservation for OBCs in institutes of higher learning.

 Karunanidhis DMK and his Tamil Nadu allies like the PMK and the Dravidar Kazhagam (DK) have been pressuring the Centre to enforce the quota soon. But the committee set up to oversee its implementation has said the government does not want to bulldoze it through.

 Sources here say the DMK government, egged on by DK general secretary K. Veeramani, decided to present the award this year to Vasantha as no one better symbolised the voice for justice in centres of higher education.

 The award, for outstanding acts of courage by a woman, has been instituted in the memory of the young astronaut who perished with the space shuttle Columbia three years ago. It carries a cash prize of Rs 5 lakh and a citation.

 Vasantha is being honoured for her determination and relentless pursuit of social justice in the appointment of teachers at the IIT, where she has been teaching mathematics for the last 16 years.

 Vasantha, who has more than 600 published papers to her credit besides several books, says she has not got her due at the IIT because she is an OBC woman scientist.

 She says she has been denied higher posts despite her qualifications and teaching experience and has knocked on every door for social justice, including that of Madras High Court. She even wrote to President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam in his capacity as visitor to the institution under the IIT Act.

 According to the sources, it is this relentless fight for social justice that made the government decide to honour her with the award at the Independence Day celebrations.

 They say it would also be a strong message to the Congress-led Centre that the DMK and its allies would brook no further delay in enforcing the quota.

 Vasantha says she is proud that the government was honouring her for her fight for justice. If they had recognised me only for my contribution to mathematics, that would have been routine. My caste, my gender and my plea for reservation have been a triple malady against my career, but my mission is to work for both mathematics and social justice.

 Fresh Delhi force for Lebanon

 SUJAN DUTTA

 New Delhi, Dec. 10: A new contingent of Indian soldiers will next week replace the troops caught on the thin Blue Line the border between Israel and Lebanon in the middle of Tel Avivs war against the Hizbollah. 

 Soldiers of the 4 Sikh Battalion, who kept vigil for the UN during the war in July, braved Israeli air and land assaults and the Hizbollahs Katyusha rockets. They will be rotated and replaced by the 15 Punjab Regiment.

 With the rotation, India continues to demonstrate a commitment to UN duties in one of the most volatile regions of the world. The 121-km Blue Line between Israel and Lebanon was one of the deadliest places in the world this year.

 At the height of the war in July, India was mulling if it should withdraw its troops because of the high risk they run in an alien war. But the armys insistence that our boys are brave enough largely because of the dollars they earn on UN missions and diplomatic considerations of maintaining a sizeable presence in UN duties combined to convince New Delhi to do otherwise.

 The 673 troops of the 4 Sikh Battalion were commended by UN secretary general Kofi Annan for courage under fire and for keeping the vigil despite running out of food and rations in the wake of the Israeli offensive. 

 The battalion reported almost daily on the war, much to Israels consternation, and the UN and the Indian Army have some of the most graphic accounts of the battle because of them.

 The 4 Sikh Battalion was serving under the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (Unifil). 

 About 800 soldiers of the 15 Punjab Regiment have been deployed under Unifil with a UN Chapter VI (peace keeping) mandate.

 The UN has laid down the Rules of Engagement that those will be binding on our soldiers, deputy chief of army staff Lt General Susheel Gupta said during the send-off to the troops.

 The main task of the unit will be to observe and report ceasefire violations. They are not required to intervene. India had also told the UN department of peacekeeping operations that it was not to be involved in a mandate that calls for the disarming of the Hizbollah, as demanded by Israel.

 About 8,000 Indian Army personnel are currently serving on UN peacekeeping and peace enforcement missions.

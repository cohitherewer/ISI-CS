 Pack of pacts awaits nuclear nod

 Washington, March 1: Even as US President George W. Bush arrived in New Delhi, backroom negotiations on a host of issues to be considered by the two leaders have reached a stage where summit decisions on those issues are hinging on the nuclear agreement.

 Bush would like to announce an end to sanctions on Indian organisations at the end of his summit with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and altogether remove India from the US commerce departments so-called Entities List for restrictive dealings.

 But such a far-reaching step depends entirely on the nuclear agreement, which will allow India to be considered as a special case within the global nuclear establishment.

 Similarly, Bush would like to make an announcement with Singh by his side that the Indian Space Research Organisation and the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration are to sign a memorandum of understanding on the use of US payloads on Indian lunar missions.

 But the Sriharikota Space Centre, which will be used for such missions, is on the Entities List of organisations under American sanctions and will have to be taken off that list.

 The two leaders are also hoping to announce the completion of necessary arrangements for the launch of a US satellite as well as satellites containing American components by Indian space launch vehicles. That, too, is linked to the Entities List.

 Missile-related sanctions on India will also have to be lifted to make progress on the broad framework of strategic cooperation that is envisaged by Bush and Singh.

 With the aim of taking advantage of the USs vast advances in industrial research and development, they hope to announce the establishment of a Bi-National Science and Technology Commission, which will not only consolidate existing programmes, but also provide new impetus for greater collaborative partnerships.

 The Prime Ministers near-obsession with kicking off a second Green Revolution in India and commercialisation of Indian agriculture will be suitably reflected in the outcome of his meeting with Bush.

 The President is expected to announce a three-year, $100-million commitment to modernise and upgrade Indian farming through a knowledge initiative on agriculture.

 Meanwhile, the simmering dispute over Fridays public address by Bush at Purana Qila appears to have been resolved amicably with the function being hosted by Indian apex business organisations, with the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry taking the lead.

 US ambassador to India David Mulford had sought to hijack the event and was resisted by the Archaeological Survey of India, which controls the heritage site. Under the compromise, however, Mulford will determine who is invited for Bushs lecture.

 As part of the Indo-US joint efforts for energy security, Bush will facilitate Indias participation in an international marine research endeavour, the Integrated Ocean Drilling Programme, that can contribute to long-term energy solutions.

 Linked to an agreement on the nuclear deal are three other items on the agenda before Bush and Singh.

 These are: Indias participation in FutureGen, a one billion-dollar American initiative to build the worlds first integrated sequestration and hydrogen production research power plant, the EDER initiative on nuclear fusion and the Global Nuclear Energy Partnership or GNEP, a Bush initiative seeking worldwide consensus to allow developing nations to securely deploy nuclear power to meet their energy needs.

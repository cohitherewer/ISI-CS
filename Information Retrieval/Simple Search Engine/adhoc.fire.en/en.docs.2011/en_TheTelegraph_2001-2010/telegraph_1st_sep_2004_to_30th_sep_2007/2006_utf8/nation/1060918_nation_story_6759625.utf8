 Netaji papers stay under wraps

 New Delhi (PTI): The home ministry has refused to provide the Central Information Commission (CIC) with copies of documents presented before two panels that probed the disappearance of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose.

 This was reported by a research group Mission Netaji which appealed to the CIC to get the ministry to share records produced before the 1956 Shah Nawaz committee and the 1974 G.D. Khosla commission. Both had concluded that Bose died in an air crash on August 18, 1945.

 The appeal came after the central government rejected the findings of the Mukherjee commission in May. The commissions findings were opposed to the conclusions made by the previous two panels.

 The matter happened more than 20 years from the date of request and as such, it is refused, the group quoted deputy secretary M.M. Chopra as saying in his reply to the CIC on August 21, on its site www.missionnetaji.org.

 Monument protection notice

 New Delhi (PTI): Delhi High Court has 

 issued notices to the Centre and the Archaeological Survey 

 of India on a petition which claimed that 35 centrally protected 

 monuments have either disappeared or have been encroached 

 upon.

 The petitioner, Sri Chand Jain, cited a statement he claimed tourism and culture minister Ambika Soni made in Parliament about the disappearance of 35 centrally protected monuments/sites to substantiate his charge. The next date for hearing is on November 24.

 wire at Siswa Bazar area in this Uttar Pradesh district

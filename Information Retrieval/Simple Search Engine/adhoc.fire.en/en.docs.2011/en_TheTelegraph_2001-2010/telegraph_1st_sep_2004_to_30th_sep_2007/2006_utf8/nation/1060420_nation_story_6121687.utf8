 Top judge welcomes exit of My Lord 

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 19: Supreme Court Chief Justice Y.K. Sabharwal today welcomed the Bar Council of Indias decision to do away with the colonial practice of addressing judges as My Lord or Your Lordship.

 Sabharwal said he, as head of the judiciary, was happy and looked forward to the implementation of the rule that calls upon lawyers to address judges as Your Honour or Honourable Court. 

 The rule, according to bar council chairman Jagannath Patnaik, has already been sent for notification in the gazette and will come into force the day it is published. 

 I havent got a copy but I am happy that they have passed such a resolution, Sabharwal said.

 However, he said, lawyers who are in the profession for many years would find it difficult to immediately switch over. It takes time, it takes time, he said.

 If I had been a lawyer, I would have found it little difficult to adjust myself to the new terminology.

 SC newsletter

 The Supreme Court today came out with a newsletter ? Court News ? that will keep people, including the legal fraternity, abreast of important developments in the judiciary. It was released by Sabharwal.

 The quarterly will also mention vacancy of judges post in the Supreme Court, high courts and subordinate courts.

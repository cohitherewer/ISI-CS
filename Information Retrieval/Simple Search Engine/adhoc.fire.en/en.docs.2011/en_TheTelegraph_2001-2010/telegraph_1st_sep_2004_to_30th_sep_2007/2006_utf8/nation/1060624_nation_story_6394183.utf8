 Husbands bungalow haunts Arundhati 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Bhopal, June 23: Notices have been sent to Arundhati Roys husband and three others for encroaching on tribal land in Madhya Pradesh.

 A bungalow owned by Pradeep Kishan in the hill resort of Panchmarhi, 250 km south-east of Bhopal, is at the centre of a row for the second time in three years. 

 In 2003, the elevated bungalow overlooking twin hillocks and vast rolling greens in Bariyam village was found to be set in notified forest land, inviting action under a state law that bars purchase and sale of such land. That case is going on in Jabalpur High Court. 

 Now, SDM Niyaz Ahmad of Pipariya has received another complaint against Arundhatis husband and three others, including Aradhana Seth, sister of writer Vikram Seth. Vijay Singh, a tribal, has accused them of encroaching upon tribal land. 

 In his affidavit, Vijay has said that the four have constructed a cemented road to their bungalows without bothering to obtain permission or pay adequate compensation. 

 Ahmad has slapped notices on the four asking them to remove the encroachment or face action in 15 days. 

 Confirming that notices have been sent, tehsildar S.L. Solanki said prima facie, land survey number 12-2 and 3-4 appear to have been encroached. 

 As her husband faces action on these complaints, the writer and activist (in picture) has been fighting for the underprivileged.

 After Kishan bought the 4,346-sq ft plot in 1994, the government filed a suit arguing that the Forest Act of 1972 banned the sale of land in notified forest areas.

 Arundhati, a campaigner for the rights of Bhopal gas survivors and villagers displaced by the Sardar Sarovar Dam, now faces sarcasm from opponents. State BJP leaders said her husband is trampling on the rights of hundreds and thousands of animal species who do not have an Arundhati Roy to speak for them.

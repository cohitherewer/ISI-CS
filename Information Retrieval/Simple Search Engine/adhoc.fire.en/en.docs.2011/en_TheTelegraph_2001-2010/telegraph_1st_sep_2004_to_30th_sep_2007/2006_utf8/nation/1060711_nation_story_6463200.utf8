 China engine

 Beijing, July 10 (Reuters): China has successfully tested a new rocket engine to power the countrys ambitious programme of manned space flights and moon landings.

 Tests of the liquid hydrogen- and kerosene-fuelled engine were a complete success, said a China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation spokesperson. 

 The new engine is three times more powerful than those currently used.

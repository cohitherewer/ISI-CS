 Second line of defence

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Silchar, July 30: The show of belligerence by Bangladesh Rifles along a stretch of the eastern frontier has prompted Assam police to put up a second line of defence behind Border Security Force outposts in Cachar district.

 Superintendent of police Satyen Gogoi said today that warlike preparations by Bangladesh ? bunkers and military reinforcements have been sighted along a 32-km stretch of the Kathigorah sector ? necessitated supplementary efforts to counter the threat.

 The BSF reported a massive military build-up by Bangladesh last week and ordered the closure of schools all along that frontier. Officials also said they suspected a group of smugglers of leaking information on security on this side of the border to the Bangladesh Rifles. 

 Echoing the BSF, Gogoi said the main challenge was to pre-empt a resurgence of militant activity along the border with the tacit support of Bangladesh. 

 A skirmish between BSF and Bangladesh Rifles personnel was reported between Harinagar and Chandinagar villages, both on this side of the border, on June 28. Bangladesh Rifles personnel allegedly fired mortars without provocation, leading to retaliatory fire in which some defence fortifications on the other side were destroyed. 

 Bangladesh Rifles agreed to exercise restraint following a flag meeting on July 4 between the commandants of both sides. But BSF deputy inspector-general (Cachar sector) Ashwini Kumar Singh said Bangladesh troops had reneged on that promise. 

 He said Bangladesh Rifless 38 Battalion had taken over a few houses at Amulshid, Barita and Uttarmul villages of Sylhet division to house its troops. 

 They have also dug a large number of trenches and built bunkers at Aulshi village, just opposite Harinagar village, which is also a BSF border outpost.

 On Tuesday, revenue minister Bhumidhar Barmans statement in the Assembly about Bangladesh encroaching on 499.83 acres of Assams territory triggered an uproar. 

 Singh accused Bangladesh Rifles of encouraging territorial transgressions. He said soldiers on the other side of the border were using children as human shields to provide cover to Bangladeshi farmers illegally engaged in farming on a 220-bigha strip under adverse possession of India. 

 The Surma divides the two countries in Cachar district. 

 Kathigorah MLA Ataur Rahman Mazarbhuiya, who is from the Assam United Democratic Front, had planned to visit the border areas for a confidence-building exercise but the BSF yesterday nixed the idea.

 The security set-up along the entire eastern frontier was recently rejigged with a record number of BSF battalions being deployed. Battalion commanders have even been authorised to open fire in retaliatory action without waiting for orders from Delhi.

 Quake code 

 New Delhi, Feb. 3 (PTI): The Centre today informed the Supreme Court that it is planning to implement a national building code to ensure safety of structures from earthquakes in urban areas.

 Additional solicitor-general Gopal Subramaniam told a bench headed by Chief Justice Y.K. Sabharwal that he had talks with senior officials in the urban development ministry and the government was of the view that it should be mandatory for every structure to be quake-proof.

 During hearing of a petition filed by the Society for Safe Structure, the additional solicitor-general said the Centre favoured compulsory certification of buildings by qualified structural engineers before any new building was put to use.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Probe into AIIMS apartheid

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Sept. 13: The Prime Ministers Office has asked the health ministry to set up an inquiry into the caste divide at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences.

 Reliable sources in the ministry said the inquiry into the discrimination first exposed by The Telegraph will be carried out under joint secretary Bhawani Thyagarajan. 

 If the Prime Minister seriously intervenes, discrimination against us may finally come to an end, said third-year MBBS student Satinder Meena. We had no hope from the AIIMS administration. Even the director doesnt listen to us.

 Yesterday, the scheduled caste and scheduled tribe students pulled out of the AIIMS Resident Doctors Association polls alleging discrimination. They had earlier complained to director P. Venugopal about the rise in abuse by general category students and urged him to postpone the election that would have pitted them against anti-quota students. The request was turned down.

 The PMOs intervention, they say, has instilled fresh faith that things can change. It has asked for the inquiry after receiving a memorandum on caste-based discrimination yesterday. 

 The Telegraph had reported in July that backward caste students were being forced into a sort of ghetto in the hostels of the countrys top teaching hospital. Documents had shown that several students belonging to the scheduled castes or scheduled tribes had changed hostel rooms to live close together, after allegedly facing threats to move out of the general category wings. 

 Abuses and threats written on the doors of some of their rooms and open admission by some students that they committed the act confirmed the apartheid. 

 Following the report, NGOs, some students and a section of the faculty approached the Scheduled Caste Commission and the AIIMS authorities with memorandums.

 The memorandum was submitted in mid-July itself. After the sad demise of the chairperson (Suraj Bhan), the commission has not moved, said Jitender Singh, an aggrieved student.

 It is not clear whether the PMOs message came as a rap on the knuckles or a simple advisory. Health minister Ambumani Ramadoss is also AIIMS president and the head of its governing body. He has in the past clashed with Venugopal, who supports the anti-quota agitation.

 A day after their victory in the resident doctors association polls, the anti-reservation lobby here often accused of representing the upper caste students welcomed news of the probe. 

 We have always maintained that there is no discrimination here at AIIMS. It is purely a figment of their (SC/ST students) imagination. The truth should come out, said outgoing president Vinod Patro.

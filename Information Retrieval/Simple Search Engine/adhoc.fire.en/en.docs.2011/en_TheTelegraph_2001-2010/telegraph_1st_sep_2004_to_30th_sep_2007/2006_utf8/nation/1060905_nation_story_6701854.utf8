 Two-day wait for plane spare part 

 New Delhi (PTI): About 300 passengers 

 of an Air-India flight have been stranded at the Delhi airport 

 for the last two days because of the non-availability of 

 a spare part of the Boeing jet.

 We tried to source the spare part from all over... but have not been able to get compatible parts to be fitted in the aircraft, Air-India spokesperson S. Venkat said.

 The Los Angeles-bound flight via Frankfurt, scheduled for departure on Saturday, was delayed because of the malfunctioning of its weather radar. The delay was further compounded by the lack of availability of aircraft as Air-Indias fleet was fully deployed. 

 Efforts to transfer the passengers on to other carriers also proved a nought as this is the peak season for Westbound travellers.

 A relief aircraft would now be flown in from Mumbai to carry the 290 passengers to their destinations.

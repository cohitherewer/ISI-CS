 No to quota, training okay

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 27: India Incs top leaders today told Prime Minister Manmohan Singh they were against job quotas in the private sector but promised to do their bit for the underprivileged.

 At a meeting, business captains like J.J. Irani, Anil Aggarwal and R. Seshasayee submitted a plan of action to Singh and said they would introduce a code that would force industry to spend on alternative solutions like training for backwards. It is learnt that the group said the code would give preference to scheduled caste and scheduled tribe candidates if they possessed skills equal to that of a general category aspirant.

 Sources confirmed that industry chambers are looking at a code of conduct to implement the affirmative action plan. They would like to bring in the code ? to be implemented by companies individually ? by October.

 Asked about Singhs response, Seshasayee said: We submitted the (Irani committee) report yesterday. Details of this and the interaction with the Prime Minister will be disclosed tomorrow.

 The committee was formed by the Confederation of Indian Industry and Assocham to suggest ways to help people from the backward segments to get employment to pre-empt any legislation in this regard.

 Besides Irani, others on the committee include CII chief Seshasayee, Assocham president Aggarwal, Sunil Munjal of the Hero Honda group and Subodh Bhargav, a former CII president.

 The report is understood to have promised not only to help Dalits get jobs, but also promote enterprise among them, the sources said, adding that industry has agreed to create 100 entrepreneurs from among SC/ STs every year. The report said any recommendation of the Irani panel on affirmative action would be implemented on a voluntary basis.

 Industry officials say the focus of the action plan is on education, skill development, employability, entrepreneurship and social development.

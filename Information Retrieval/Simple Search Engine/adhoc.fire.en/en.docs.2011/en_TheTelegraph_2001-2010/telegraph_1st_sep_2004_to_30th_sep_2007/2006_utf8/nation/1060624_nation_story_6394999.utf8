 250-page chargesheet on textile scion

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, June 23: Mumbai police have filed a 250-page chargesheet against S. Kumar Group scion Abhishek Kasliwal, who was arrested on charges of raping a 52-year-old woman in March.

 The state is likely to expedite the trial by assigning the case to a fast-track court.

 Worli police arrested Kasliwal on March 12 after the woman alleged that the 26-year-old, on the pretext of giving her a lift in his Mercedes in the early hours of March 11, had repeatedly raped her in the car at an isolated spot in a textile mill owned by his father. 

 The chargesheet filed before Bhoiwada court magistrate B. Waghmare yesterday included statements of 15 witnesses, including two key ones, and several medical reports.

 It included forensic test reports, medical and chemical analysis reports of used condoms found in the car, the reports of lie-detector tests conducted on Kasliwal and a DNA test report, which confirmed that the semen sample on the rape victims clothes matched those of Kasliwal.

 The two key witnesses in the case are the watchmen of Shriram textile mills who first identified Kasliwal. 

 The victim had initially said the alleged rapist was Vicky Malhotra. But when the police questioned the mill watchmen who opened the gates to allow the Mercedes in, they identified the man in the car as Abhishek Kasliwal. 

 Kasliwal had denied the allegation of rape and said the sex was consensual. His lawyers alleged that the victim had demanded money from their client and made up the story when he refused to pay. 

 Kasliwal is out on bail.

 Smriti dons another hat

 Smriti Irani

 Mumbai, July 11: Actor-politician Smriti Irani has turned producer and will launch her soap ? tentatively titled Thoda Sa Asman ? on STAR Plus in mid-August.

 Iranis production house Ugraya (another name of Lord Shiva) Entertainment will produce the soap in collaboration with Ekta Kapoors Balaji Telefilms, which made Irani a household name as Tulsi Virani in the serial Kyunkii Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi. It will be aired every Saturday and Sunday at 10.30 pm.

 Irani, who has in the past produced news features for Goa and Gujarat during the elections, has worked on the casting and script with Kapoor. 

 The production team will be made up of Balaji staff.

 I am happy that the show has finally worked out. I am busy juggling my different careers and frankly since motherhood is a full-time job, I didnt want to take on anything that I couldnt complete. But honestly, my colleagues in the party (BJP) have always helped me manage, said Irani, who takes her role as a BJP worker very seriously.

 The soap will star Pawan Shankar, who played the lead in Star Ones Siddhanth, Usha Nadkarni, TV and film actor Achyut Poddar and Harsh Chhaya.

 Irani has produced stage shows in the past ? her first production was about senior citizens and the next about working women. The soap deals with clashes between families from two different economic backgrounds.

 There has to be some thought going into the stories that we tell and I have always tried to do something meaningful. I wasnt born into a filmy family and had to struggle a lot to make ends meet, so when I have this opportunity I want to make the most of it, she said.

 Irani, who as Tulsi has been televisions favourite bahu and saas for five years and now has a new track as ba, is also a brand ambassador for WHO and US Aid in India.

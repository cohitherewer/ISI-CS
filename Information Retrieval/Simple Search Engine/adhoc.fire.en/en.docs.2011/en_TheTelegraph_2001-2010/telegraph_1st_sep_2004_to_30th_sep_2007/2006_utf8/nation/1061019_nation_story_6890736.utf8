The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Good chance to make 7 wonders

 - Swiss 

 body to visit Taj Mahal in December 

 AMIT ROY

 Will it ace the race? 

 London, Oct. 18: The Taj Mahal absolutely has a good chance of being declared one of the new seven wonders of the world, it was stated today by the Swiss organisation which is attempting to identify the chosen ones through a worldwide poll.

 So do all the others on the list of 21, added Tia B. Viering, spokeswoman for the non-profit Swiss foundation called New7Wonders, which is running the poll.

 Foundation officials are travelling the world visiting each site in turn. We will be at the Taj Mahal on December 5, Viering told The Telegraph today. We would like everyone in Calcutta, everyone in India to know.

 When the Taj was included in the original list in February, 2004, Aishwarya Rai marked the event by releasing a giant balloon at the mausoleum.

 The Taj is a beautiful piece of architecture, more beautiful than me, the actress had remarked modestly.

 Viering promised: We will be back with an airship, more majestic than before.

 She acknowledged that only those with computers or telephones could participate in the voting. Thats a logistical necessity, she agreed. But we have found that people go to an Internet cafe or to a friends house to make a call.

 The worlds choice of the new seven wonders will be announced live on television at the Benfica stadium in Lisbon on July 7, 2007 7/7/07.

 We have already had 20 million votes and hundreds, thousands are coming in every day, said Viering. We hope to have millions and millions.

 Many from India have voted for the Taj Mahal, while the Chinese are supporting the Great Wall. Voters in Peru are backing Machu Picchu, the fortress city of the Incas. 

 New7Wonders, which specialises in the preservation, restoration and promotion of monuments, has argued that a new list of the seven wonder has become necessary because from the old list, only one the Pyramids at Giza in Egypt has survived.

 The other original seven wonders of the ancient world were the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, the Statue of Zeus at Olympia, the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus, the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, the Colossus of Rhodes and the Lighthouse of Alexandria. They have all disappeared.

 For the new list, only monuments built before 2000 can be considered. 

 The online and telephone poll represents the biggest international exercise of its kind.

 Salary cut threat for strike doctors

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 14: The government and the anti-quota doctors face another battle, this time in the courts, over a threatened pay cut.

 The government has said the doctors who struck work over the Other Backward Classes reservation, crippling hospitals such as the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, would not be paid for the strike period.

 The doctors have threatened to move court. They feel that the no-work, no-pay decision flouts the apex court assurance that had led them to end the strike.

 Dr Vinod Patro, an agitation leader, said Youth for Equality, which spearheaded the anti-quota protests, would challenge the threatened salary cut in the Supreme Court in the next few days.

 Health minister Anbumani Ramadoss, however, said a pay cut didnt amount to punishment, and therefore didnt violate the apex courts May 31 assurance that the doctors would not face punitive action.

 It is not punitive action, Ramadoss said. He said that by holding back pay, he was merely following the law. He added that the Centre would release the salaries if the court asked it to do so.

 Ramadoss said the government was in a position to increase seats in central medical institutions such as the AIIMS in Delhi and PGI, Chandigarh.

 Implementing a 27 per cent OBC quota while simultaneously increasing seats is part of the government plan to deal with the quota controversy.

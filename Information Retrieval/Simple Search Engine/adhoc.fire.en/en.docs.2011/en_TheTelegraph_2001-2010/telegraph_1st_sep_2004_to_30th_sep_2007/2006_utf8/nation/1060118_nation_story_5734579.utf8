 Rename cry for Suez of East

 M.R. VENKATESH

 Chennai, Jan. 17: Suez of the East? No, just a canal of Tamils.

 Tamil nationalists from India and Sri Lanka have dredged up a 65-year-old demand to rename the Sethusamudram Ship Canal Project as Tamizhar Kaalvai (Tamils channel).

 One reason being offered is that the planned 167-km shipping channel, connecting the Gulf of Mannar (south of Rameshwaram) with the Palk Bay, will have Tamils living on either side ? in Tamil Nadu and northern Sri Lanka.

 The demand was articulated for the first time in recent years by the Sri Lankan Tamil scholar, Maravanpulavu K. Sachithananthan, at a function in Chennai last week.

 The former UN adviser on food and agriculture told his audience that in the 1940s, the late Dravidian leader C.P. Adithanaar had asked that when the canal ? a 144-year-old dream of Tamils ?is built, it should be named Tamizhan Kaalvai.

 Sachithananthan was all for it, only he wanted Tamizhan replaced with Tamizhar, a more reverential way of referring collectively to Tamils.

 He offered two arguments. First, he mentioned how Colombo had made a tactical blunder by opposing the project in the beginning, which led to the channel being planned entirely within Indian territorial waters.

 If Colombo had been shrewd enough, it could have demanded that the channel be carved along the international maritime boundary between India and Sri Lanka to facilitate joint ownership and management, Sachithananthan said.

 But by opposing the project, Sri Lanka had given up its possible stakes in it, and now it is virtually a project of the Tamils with only Tamils living on either side, the scholar added.

 He then cited semantics, arguing that the current name, Sethusamudram, is a contradiction in terms.

 Ancient Tamil literature as well as the local dialect of Rameshwaram refer to the areas coast as sethu, a word whose origin is rooted in a natural phenomenon called mann servarthaal varum medu (mounds formed by shifting sands that accumulate on the shallow sea bed), Sachithananthan said. So, sethu suggests a shallow sea bed.

 But samudram means aazh kadal (deep ocean). How can the two words, virtual antonyms, be stitched together? the scholar asked. So, the project needs renaming.

 His comments came at a function where Tamil nationalist leader P. Nedumaran released a book on the project, written by lawyer K.S. Radhakrishnan and titled Sethu Kaalvai ? Oru Paarvai. 

 The author used to be a spokesperson for the MDMK and later, the DMK.

 Delhi has repeatedly underlined how important the Rs 2,427-crore project, now in its seventh month of implementation, is to Indias economic and strategic interests.

 Once the channel is ready ? probably by 2008 ? the countrys naval and Coast Guard ships will not need to leave Indian waters and make a detour around the southern coast of Sri Lanka while travelling between Indias eastern and western coats.

 Ditto for freighters. The countrys import-export trade will save the Rs 1,000 crore a year it spends in foreign exchange because of transhipment of cargo through Colombo.

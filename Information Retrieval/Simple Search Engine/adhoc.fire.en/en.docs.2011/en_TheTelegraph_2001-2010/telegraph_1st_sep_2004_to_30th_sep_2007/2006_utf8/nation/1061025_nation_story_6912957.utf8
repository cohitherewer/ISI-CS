The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 India greater? Not for Pervez

 Musharraf: Hard talk

 Islamabad, Oct. 24 (PTI): Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf today asked India to shed its obsession of being a greater nation and its attempt to dominate Islamabad.

 I respect the Indian Prime Minister but it is regrettable that India wants to keep its domination in the region and wants Pakistan to be (a) weaker force. India should come out of its obsession of being a greater nation and should talk to us on an equal level, Musharraf said.

 We would not allow anyones interference in our internal matters and neither would we tolerate such things, he said in an interview to a TV channel.

 Musharraf said both countries should refrain from interfering into each others internal affairs. India, he said, should set its own house in order before pointing fingers at Pakistan regarding terrorism on its soil and telling others what to do.

 There are 21 such places in India where violence continues. The situation in Assam is also visible. So, New Delhi should first correct its own matters and then talk to Pakistan, he said.

 He described as a welcome development the Indo-Pak dialogue to resolve the Kashmir issue.

 The talks between India and Pakistan on Kashmir issues are under way, which is a welcome development. The two countries exhibited in this regard a positive attitude in the Havana declaration. Now, the process should move forward, Musharraf said.

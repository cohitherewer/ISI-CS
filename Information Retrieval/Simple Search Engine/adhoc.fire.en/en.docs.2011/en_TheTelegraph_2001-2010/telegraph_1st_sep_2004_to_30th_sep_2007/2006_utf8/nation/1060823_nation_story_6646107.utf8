 Coward slur on Mizo deserters 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Aizawl, Aug. 22: Twenty-nine 

 constables of an India Reserve Battalion (IRB) from Mizoram 

 deserted their barracks midway through a training stint 

 at the Vairengte Counter Insurgency amp; Jungle Warfare 

 School, allegedly because they were scared of fighting Maoists 

 in Chhattisgarh.

 The deserters were part of a 673-member contingent being trained for a stint in the state where nine IRB personnel from Nagaland died in a landmine blast on February 6. 

 Sources said the constables had been grumbling about not being paid travel and dearness allowances in advance and walked out in a huff last night.

 However, an officer involved in training them dismissed it as an excuse. The main reason is their fear of facing the Maoists, he said. 

 The 29 constables, all of them allegedly drunk, trooped out of their camp at Lailapur around 9 pm and forced their way through the police checkpoint. Some of them were involved in a scuffle with their seniors before stomping out, a source said.

 The entire group is believed to be hiding somewhere along Mizorams border with Assam. Of the 29, three are from the Delta Company and the rest from the Charlie Company of the 2nd Mizoram IRB. The Union home ministry requisitioned their services earlier this month. 

 Officers at the counter- insurgency school, which has even hosted US Marines, said some of the IRB personnel gave them a hard time in the first few days. 

 But IRB deputy commandant Lalthafamkima said most of them had adapted well and would be ready for deployment soon. We have made great progress and hope to have the trainees fit before they leave, he said.

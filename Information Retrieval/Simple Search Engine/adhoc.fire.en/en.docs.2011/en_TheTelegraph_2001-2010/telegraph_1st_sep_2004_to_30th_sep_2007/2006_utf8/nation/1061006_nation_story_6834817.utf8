 US to end visa wait

 New Delhi, Oct. 5 (PTI): Indians travelling to America can expect to face lesser hassles with the US embassy mobilising additional resources to eliminate the waiting period for visa interviews by the year-end.

 The mission is also working on expanding its business executive programme under which visas of company employees are processed on a priority basis. 

 We are sensitive to the inconvenience and long waits for appointments, which have characterised our visa processing system in recent months, US ambassador David C. Mulford said after inaugurating the new visa appointment system at the embassy here.

 A similar system, under which applicants waitlisted for visa appointments can advance the dates, has been started at consulates in Calcutta, Mumbai and Chennai.

 Mulford acknowledged that the long waiting period was giving the US a bad name. It can currently take up to six months to get a visa application processed.

 We have made a mission-wide commitment to reduce the waiting time for a visa appointment, with the goal of eliminating this waiting period altogether, the envoy said.

 Applicants who have already got appointments should visit the embassys appointment website to advance their schedule, Mulford said.

 Additional manpower has been employed at the embassy and consulates at least 12 officers have arrived from Washington to clear the backlog.

 Mulford underlined that nothing is more important for the future of the two countries than the strong and growing bond of business and people-to-people contact.

 Talks are being held with major Indian business chambers like Ficci, CII, Nasscom and the Indo-American Chambers of Commerce to identify companies whose employees would get visas on priority.

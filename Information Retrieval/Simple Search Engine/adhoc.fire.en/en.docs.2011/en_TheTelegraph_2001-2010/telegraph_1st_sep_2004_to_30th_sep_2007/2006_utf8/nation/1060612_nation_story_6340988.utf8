 Rahul cops seek court shift

 New Delhi, June 11 (PTI): Delhi police today challenged the powers of a metropolitan court to try Rahul Mahajans case and sought its transfer to a special court.

 The metropolitan magistrate has no power to hear this case when a special court designated to hear all matters under the NDPS Act (the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act) is already in existence, they said in an application before special judge N.K. Gupta at the Tis Hazari complex seeking transfer of the drug abuse case to his court.

 Accepting the application, the special court has directed Delhi police to produce the late BJP leader Pramod Mahajans son, Rahul, now lodged at Tihar jail, tomorrow for further hearing.

 The plea was filed after metropolitan magistrate A.K. Chaturvedi, in whose court the case is currently being heard, had termed the public prosecutors argument that it did not have power to hear a bail application in the case fallacious.

 The jurisdiction to conduct trial automatically and inherently includes the right to grant bail and, therefore, this argument is rejected as being devoid of any foundation and appears to be an illustration of intellectual bankruptcy, he had observed on Friday while deferring Rahuls bail hearing to June 13. 

 Further, to counter defence counsel Sunil Mittals arguments on the quantity of the drugs found at Pramods official residence on the night of June 1, the prosecution had relied upon the fresh charges filed against Rahul under Section 27a of the NDPS Act for financing illicit traffic of contraband and harbouring offenders.

 But Mittal had rebutted that the prosecution was unable to distinguish between financing through a series of transactions and consumption through a single transaction.

 Accepting Mittals contention, the court had ruled out the applicability of Section 27a against Rahul.

 Chaturvedi had also said the polygraph, brain-mapping and the narcoanalysis tests could be carried on the accused even when he was on bail.

 The magistrate, however, had noted that nothing in this order would tantamount to an opinion... having a bearing on the merits of the case and shall be relevant only for the disposal of the present bail application.

 The police are likely to receive all the reports from the Central Forensic Science Laboratory soon, arming them with the exact information on the nature and quality of drugs used.

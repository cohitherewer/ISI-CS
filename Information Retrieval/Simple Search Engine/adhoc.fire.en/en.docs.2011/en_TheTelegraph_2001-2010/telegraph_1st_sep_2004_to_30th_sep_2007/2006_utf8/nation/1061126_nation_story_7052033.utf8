 China loses TV race

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chennai, Nov. 25: Indian electronics firms have beaten back competition from Chinese companies to bag a contract for 25 lakh TV sets that the Tamil Nadu government will distribute free to keep a DMK poll promise.

 The contract is for the second phase of the scheme that will eventually cover 80 lakh families that dont have TV sets. With the first phase in September involving a token 30,000 sets, all eyes were on this round.

 Nearly 120 firms from 16 countries including the US, Britain, Japan, Australia, Switzerland, Korea and Iran had shown interest but only 13 handed in bids. Chinas Hi Chi China TV and Panda China TV failed at the technical evaluation stage.

 The final orders are split between five Indian firms, with the Noida-based Dickson Technologies and Air-vision India bagging the bulk. Dickson will supply 9 lakh sets and Air-vision 2 lakh (plus another 3 lakh if it can increase manufacturing capacity in three months). LB Electronics of Ghaziabad will supply 2 lakh, Videocon 6 lakh and Bangalore-based Kitchen Appliances 3 lakh.

 At Rs 2,740 a set, the price is Rs 225 lower than the first-phase figure of Rs 2,965, when the TVs were supplied by Videocon, Dickson and Kitchen.

 Union finance minister P. Chidambaram, however, has ruled out the states request for an excise waiver, which would have cost the exchequer Rs 335 crore for the entire scheme.

 The state has other poll promises to keep, such as a gas stove with an LPG cylinder free to every poor household.

 Myanmar gas heat on Delhi

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 19: When he was 10, Wong Aung was forced to carry bamboo and build roads for Myanmars military junta. At 20, studying electrical engineering and drawn into the democracy movement, he was beaten by soldiers with rifle butts.

 This week, Aung took a break from self-imposed exile on the Thailand-Myanmar border to condemn Indias moves to exploit one of the worlds largest deposits of natural gas discovered in the 1990s in the Arakan sea off Myanmars west coast.

 The dollars that the military regime earns from gas will go into bullets to kill pro-democracy students, said Aung, president of the All Arakan Students Youth Congress. Their blood will make the colour of the gas red.

 Aung is among Myanmarese pro-democracy activists, student leaders from Indias Northeast, and international human rights watchers who have gathered here to protest against Indias involvement in a proposal to transport the gas from Myanmar to India.

 The Oil and Natural Gas Commission (ONGC) and the Gas Authority of India Limited (GAIL) had recently bought 30 per cent stake in a gas deposit from Koreas Daewoo that owns exploration and ownership rights for natural gas in the Arakan region.

 The Arakan gas deposits are huge ? the block where ONGC and GAIL have a stake alone contains over 20 trillion cubic feet of gas. But analysts say it is uncertain how India will get the gas from Myanmar.

 Negotiations with Dhaka to bring the gas via the Shwe gas pipeline passing through Bangladesh have all but broken down, and a pipeline through Indias Northeast, avoiding Bangladesh, is considered too expensive.

 While analysts point out that Myanmar has agreed to commit its share of the gas to China through a pipeline that runs into Chinas Yunan province, activists claim that India is still evaluating other options of transporting the gas to India.

 Analysts have predicted that the Shwe gas pipeline will help the Myanmar military regime earn an annual revenue of $2.86 billion for the next 20 years, a figure higher than Myanmars total current export earnings of $2.13 billion.

 The gas is Myanmars wealth. But this is a wrong time to buy gas from Myanmar, said Aung. The pipeline will mean more military repression. 

 He says the number of battalions in Arakan have gone up from 10 in 1990 to 45 in 2000 and 63 this year.

 Those who want Myanmars gas should wait until democracy is established, Aung said. It will happen some day.

 FIR norm

 New Delhi, Feb. 22: The Supreme Court has ruled that police cannot refuse to register an FIR even if they have doubts that the information provided in a complaint was not reliable or credible.

 A police officer is dutybound to register a case on the basis of any information disclosing a cognisable offence, the court said.

 Allowing an appeal against a Delhi High Court order, the apex court said: Genuineness or otherwise of the information can only be considered after the registration of the case. It cannot be a precondition for registering the case.

 The high court had rejected the plea of one Ramesh Kumari to direct the police to file an FIR.

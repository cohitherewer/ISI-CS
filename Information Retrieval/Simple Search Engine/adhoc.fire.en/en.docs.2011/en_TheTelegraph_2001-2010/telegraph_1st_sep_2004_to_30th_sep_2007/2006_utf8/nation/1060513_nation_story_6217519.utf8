 Delhi springs bill to stop bulldozers 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 12: The Lok Sabha today passed a bill to halt for a year demolition and sealing of illegal structures in the capital, virtually nullifying directives of the Supreme Court and Delhi High Court.

 The Centre will take the year to work out a comprehensive and balanced strategy on issues relating to unauthorised constructions. It will collect data and talk to residents associations and professional bodies.

 This will take some time, urban development minister S. Jaipal Reddy said, introducing The Delhi Laws (Special Provisions) Bill, 2006.

 The bill seeks to put the lid on months of controversy over demolitions and other punitive action being taken by civic authorities in Delhi, pushed by the courts.

 The year-long amnesty applies to violations up to January 1. Anything after that can be punished. Clearance of slums is also allowed if the land is required for specific public projects. 

 Otherwise, the shanties will stay. As will structures put up by street-vendors. Shops and offices in residential areas that do not conform to mixed land use guidelines will also be spared sealing. Homeowners, who have built illegal add-ons to their property, will not be visited by municipality squads.

 The bill took just an hour and 45 minutes to introduce, debate and pass. It will come into effect only after the Rajya Sabha passes it next week, but the bulldozers are expected to stop immediately.

 All parties backed the bill, but tried to score political points. Some MPs attacked the judiciary for interfering in a matter they said was the concern of the executive alone.

 The BJPs deputy leader and former urban development minister, V.K. Malhotra, said he had warned three months ago that the Centre must intervene but was ridiculed by Reddy. He demanded compensation for those whose properties had been demolished or businesses sealed and found flaws in the drafting of the bill. It would not stand judicial scrutiny, he said. 

 Reddy reminded Malhotra his party had done nothing when it was in power. 

 The government was also attacked by allies Left. The bill is belated, absolutely belated, CPI leader Gurudas Dasgupta said.

 Across parties, MPs agreed that migrants had to be factored in. People from the slums provided services to the middle-class and helped build infrastructure, they said. Reddy said the Centre would aim to provide better accommodation to slum-dwellers where they were, and not shift them to far-off places.

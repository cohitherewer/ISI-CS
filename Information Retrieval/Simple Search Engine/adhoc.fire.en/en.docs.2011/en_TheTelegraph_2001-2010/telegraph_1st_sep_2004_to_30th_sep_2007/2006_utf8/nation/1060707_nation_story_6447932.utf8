 AIIMS battle shifts to court

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 6: All India Institute of Medical Sciences director P. Venugopal today moved Delhi High Court to try and save his chair from health minister A. Ramadosss mala fide and vindictive attitude.

 Venugopal sought a restraint on the government from acting on the resolution to sack him passed at an extraordinary meeting of the institute called by Ramadoss yesterday.

 With Venugopal questioning the legal validity of the resolution, the Centre proposed a compromise: it offered to withdraw the resolution if the director quit on his own.

 Former law minister and BJP leader Arun Jaitley, who appeared for Venugopal, dismissed the offer as unfair and unworthy of consideration.

 Venugopals writ petition targeted the minister and sought his disqualification from Parliament on the ground that his post of AIIMS president was an office of profit.

 The cardiac surgeon also sought the health ministers removal as president of the institute. He argued that the AIIMS Act, 1956, envisaged autonomy for the institute and, therefore, a minister could not be appointed its president or even a member of its governing body.

 The BJP, which supports Venugopal in his tussle with the health minister, has accused Ramadoss of flouting the AIIMS Act by simultaneously holding the post of director of the Cardiothoracic and Neurosciences Centre.

 Venugopal, whose five-year tenure was to expire on July 2, 2008, argued that the decision to remove him was unconstitutional and went against the drift of a Supreme Court judgment.

 He said the apex court had held in a 1992 case that the post of AIIMS director was a tenure post, and once a person was appointed to such a post, the question of prematurely retiring him did not arise. The tenure could be curtailed only on justifiable grounds after issuing a notice.

 Venugopal told the court no show-cause notice had been issued to him before the resolution was moved. He claimed that the charges in the resolution, such as the one that he had revealed official documents to the media, were baseless, untrue, non-existent, concocted and driven by the mala fide and vindictive mindset of Ramadoss.

 The arguments will resume tomorrow.

 The BJP today appealed to President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam to sack Ramadoss as health minister and demanded an unconditional apology from the Prime Minister for the humiliation of Venugopal.

 Sushma Swaraj and V.K. Malhotra led a team of the BJP doctors cell to Rashtrapati Bhavan. 

 They said the President should intervene when the cabinet committee for appointments considers sacking Venugopal.

 London, June 30: The University of Oxford will assist Indian research and development institutions, firms, attorneys and managers to facilitate the commercialisation of intellectual property. 

 The governments of India and the UK have signed letters of intent to collaborate in building human resource capacities in dealing with matters of intellectual property rights (IPR) and promotion of educational and other institutions in the two countries. 

 Union ministers Kapil Sibal and Kamal Nath met Lord Sainsbury, UKs secretary of state for science and technology, yesterday under the aegis of India-UK business leaders forum. 

 As a response to this understanding, Oxford Business School will assist Indian institutions and managers in training and management of patents and trademarks, development of the profession of patent and trademark attorneys, share experiences and best practices for investigation of IPR infringement and their solutions. 

 Professor David Morris of Oxford said the university would facilitate teaching of IPR in Indian law schools and universities and help in increasing awareness and use of IPR by industry. 

 Nath said Indias record in respecting IPR was impeccable. 

 But we are striving to improve further. We want to have a huge resource group in government, industry and in the academic arena who will be experts in IPR. Let us not forget that India is no longer merely a user but emerging as a provider in innovations. We also need to protect our traditional knowledge resources. 

 The commerce and industry minister urged the British government and industry leaders to make use of opportunities in India, pointing out that investment in the UK by Indian corporates was higher than that of UK corporates in India. 

 We are now in a different world and a different India, thanks to 15 years of economic reforms. According to recent assessment by Standard and Poors, India is set to remain one of the fastest growing economies in the world. 

 Equally important are other estimates that suggest that around 30-40 per cent of Indias GDP growth has been due to rising factor productivity not just due to higher inputs of labour and capital, Nath said.

 Ajay Dua, the Indian secretary for industrial policy and promotion, admitted some infrastructural deficiencies and issues of governance and labour flexibility that need to be addressed, but said investors should remember that returns in investments in India were highest in the world ? more than Europe, China, Korea and Thailand.

 Party hard, get a liquor drop home

 CHARU SUDAN KASTURI

 New Delhi, Dec. 30: Guess whos worried about your safety on New Years Eve? The same brands whose liquor you might be consuming at the year-end bash.

 Take public transport and go to the party of your choice, drink if you please and celebrate as long as you like. Leave the worries of getting back home safely to liquor companies.

 If Seagrams advertisements ask you to drive safe on New Years Eve, Diageo, whose brands include Johnnie Walker, Guinness and Smirnoff, has decided to go a step futher.

 Four hundred taxicabs will be posted at the hotels hosting the most happening parties in Delhi, Mumbai, Noida and Gurgaon on the night of December 31 to pick up those who want a drop back home. After dropping a reveller home, the drivers will come back to their post, ready for the next person.

 And its all free.

 Information and broadcasting ministry guidelines ban direct or indirect ads through surrogate products like sportsgear or mineral water of liquor brands. While the free taxicabs may be seen as a form of advertising, no ones complaining, least of all the traffic police.

 Its wonderful that liquor companies are trying to minimise traffic accidents on New Years Eve, said Qamar Ahmed, joint commissioner of police (traffic).

 Ahmed has in the past led several police campaigns against the same companies, and their advertisements. But he says he couldnt be happier with the New Year initiative. If we can save even one life through their initiatives, it is good, he said.

 Echoing him was Diageo India managing director Asif Adil. 

 My son is 21 years old, and I am scared when he goes out partying. I know people will claim liquor brands are indulging in surrogate advertising, but people need to understand the industrys image improves if we have less road accidents, he said over telephone from Mumbai.

 Diageo, he said, was also in conversation with other liquor majors to spread the project further. 

 The liquor industry should get into the business of providing free post-party transport on a regular basis, he said.

 A Seagrams spokesperson said the company was waiting to see the success of this years initiative before taking a decision on joining in.

 Adil has set his eyes on Calcutta as well. I believe the taxicab service should be available all over the country, particularly in Calcutta. There is every chance next New Year you may see cabs rolling down Calcutta streets, the Diageo MD said.

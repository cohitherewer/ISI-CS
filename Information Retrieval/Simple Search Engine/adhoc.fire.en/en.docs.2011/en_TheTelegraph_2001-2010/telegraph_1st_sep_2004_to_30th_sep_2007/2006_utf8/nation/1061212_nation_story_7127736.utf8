 Plan to snip Delhis lung

 CHARU SUDAN KASTURI

 Delhi residents rest on a patch of green

 New Delhi, Dec. 11: Malls in place of forests.

 Polluting industries instead of parks.

 All by 2021.

 Thats the trade-off city planners of the Union urban development ministry are making as they sketch the final contours of the Delhi Master Plan 2021.

 The one-kilometre-wide green belt Delhis panting lung that encircles most of the national capital territory is being smothered to make more room for a shooting population and ever-expanding industry.

 The green area within the capital, too, will suffer. Now the highest among Indias metros at 19 per cent, it will be pruned to 15 per cent by 2021.

 The green belt has been a constant feature in all previous plans for Delhis urban future since the first master plan in 1962. The current draft of the master plan says for the first time that the green belt will not be maintained.

 The plan is likely to stay that way, say planners and bureaucrats at the urban development ministry.

 There is simply no space in Delhi. Much as we may want the green belt, and the green area within Delhi, at the end of the day housing has to get precedence, said Arun Mehta, a senior ministry planner.

 Economic activity, too, has grown faster than any of Delhis founding planners could have imagined, he said.

 Delhi now has forest cover along most of its borders; there is also the ridge running through parts of the capital.

 The ministrys vision document allows toilet blocks, pump rooms, electric power stations and other amenities in the green belt.

 And eventually, malls and amusement parks will be allowed in some sections of the erstwhile green belt... sorry, of what will become the erstwhile green belt, a joint secretary corrected himself at the ministry.

 A considerable part of the green belt has already been utilised for both planned and unplanned development, the draft master plan argues to explain the decision.

 The draft outlines plans for Delhis outskirts, too. Polluting industries are to be shifted to border areas, many of which are part of the current green belt.

 Environmentalists and urban planners, including some in the ministry, say Delhi is choking.

 Its a consequence of urban development lagging behind economic development, explained Rakesh Gupta, a member of the National Capital Region Planning Board. The board is a ministry body that plans for areas surrounding Delhi, such as Gurgaon and Noida, that make up the national capital region.

 The MPD looks to house a fifth of Delhis population growth from now in NCR areas.

 The NCR, which extends beyond Alwar in Rajasthan, Meerut and Bulandshahr in Uttar Pradesh and Rohtak and Panipat in Haryana, is less developed than Delhi. People and industries, therefore, continue to concentrate in the NCT, Gupta said.

 Its this that environmentalist Sushma Reddy fears could stifle Delhi and make the MPD unachievable.

 If you dont have space for the green belt, how will you accommodate traffic-free superways? Unless the population is spread out over the NCR in an equitable way, all the MPD plans will suffer, she said.

 Delhi to extend helping hand to Nepal, but only on request

 BHARAT BHUSHAN

 Koirala: India waits

 New Delhi, May 24: Only specific request from Nepal will determine the shape and size of the Indian plan to help create an economic and social peace dividend in Nepal, where the economy has been shattered by 10 years of insurgency. 

 The economic recovery plan, according to sources, will be based entirely on the requirements put forward by the interim government in Kathmandu. Keeping Nepalese sensitivities in mind and perhaps having learnt from past mistakes, there would be no attempt to push aid in one direction or the other unilaterally.

 Given the deteriorating fiscal situation in Nepal, however, some immediate assistance measures are likely to be announced in the coming days. The unveiling of a more substantive package though will have to wait till the proposed state visit of Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala.

 While several bilateral meetings have taken place between Indian and Nepalese officials, the decision on the economic assistance package has been delayed because of the inability of an ailing Koirala to undertake the Delhi visit. There has also not been a comprehensive or clear indication from Kathmandu of the specific contours of the assistance required from India.

 However, the expectation of Nepalese and Indian sources is that the aid package, still under discussion, would have four broad strands:

 It is expected that there would be a clear intervention strategy to help in the social sector (areas linked to improving the social indicators like public health, education, rural infrastructure).

 To put the Nepalese economy on the upswing again, there is expected to be emphasis on private sector-led growth in new infrastructure projects, improved access for Nepalese companies to the Indian market and setting up of hydro-electric projects to meet the electricity needs of Nepal. As the country is expected to suffer from power shortages till 2015, primacy would be given to local electricity consumption needs rather than exports to India.

 There is likely to be special emphasis on post-conflict rehabilitation of infrastructure ? rebuilding of hospitals, schools, bridges, electricity sub-stations and even police stations destroyed during the insurgency.

 And lastly, there would be an immediate cash-injection to meet the Rs 320-crore deficit in the Nepalese budget over the next two months of the remaining Nepalese fiscal year. Not the entire amount is likely to come from India as other donor nations have also been approached for help.

 The donor community, including India, has only been requested for immediate budgetary support to meet a deficit of Rs 320 crore. Indian ambassador to Nepal, Shivshankar Mukherjee, held discussions with the finance minister of the interim government, Ramsharan Mahat, on Tuesday in this regard. 

 It is learnt from Nepalese sources that so as not to delay the economic assistance package, a high level visit ? by either the finance minister or deputy prime minister K. P. Oli Sharma ? may take place before Koirala is fit enough to visit Delhi.

 The size of the overall package is still in a grey zone as it is not clear whether this would be a one-time assistance package or a cumulative package that may include assistance already committed ? to the tune of Rs 800 crore ? for ongoing infrastructure projects in Nepal. 

 New Delhi, meanwhile, is learnt to have decided to double the number of scholarships it grants to Nepalese students both in Nepal and India.

 However, the sources were puzzled that while India was planning a massive economic aid package, it had not moved at all on waiving the 4 per cent additional duty on Nepalese exports to India. 

 Seventy per cent of all Nepalese exports are to India and if New Delhi really wants to help, then it should begin by waiving the additional duty, they said.

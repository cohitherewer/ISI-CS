The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 For once, Opposition is united

 POORNIMA JOSHI

 Advani, Jaswant: Joint show 

 New Delhi, July 22: The government is trying hard to bring the Opposition on board as it drums up support for an unchanged office of profit bill, but the BJP and its allies appeared set against the legislation in its present form.

 Parliamentary affairs minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi and defence minister Pranab Mukherjee are scheduled to meet the leaders of Opposition in the two Houses ? L.K. Advani and Jaswant Singh ? tomorrow.

 The idea is to talk the BJP into not rejecting outright the bill, which will be reintroduced in Parliament next week. But sources said unless something dramatic happens, neither the BJP nor its allies would accept the bill as it is.

 BJP general secretary Arun Jaitley said the government does not even want to consider objections raised by the President. If the government carries on with this unconstitutional move, the BJPs stand is clear. If the move weakens the spirit of the Constitution? the BJP will oppose it.

 Sources said National Democratic Alliance leaders will meet tomorrow in Atal Bihari Vajpayees residence to firm up their strategy on an issue that has seen a rare unity among the allies.

 According to a senior NDA leader, the two dominant alliance partners ? the BJP and the Janata Dal (United) ? have serious differences over a number of issues.

 For instance, the Dal (U) has rejected the BJPs perennial demand for a no-confidence motion against Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee. BJP president Rajnath Singh had met Dal (U) leader Sharad Yadav on July 8 to discuss the issue. But Yadav reportedly said such a move would be politically counter-productive.

 Sab taraf se joote parenge (Well be beaten with shoes), Yadav is said to have told Rajnath.

 Even on the minority census, the Dal (U) has a different stand. While the BJP has mounted a shrill campaign against the move with Jaitley alleging that the government is following a path to national destruction, the Dal (U) has kept quiet.

 Our view is that the Congress wants to attract Muslim votes by this move while the BJP wants to consolidate its own vote bank. If the government is seriously interested in improving the lot of the marginalised, why dont they do a census of all castes and communities. Let us see where everyone stands after 60 years of Independence, a senior NDA leader said. 

 But on the profit bill, the Dal (U) is with the BJP. The BJPs view is that in its present form, the bill merely serves the interests of a few MPs who are occupying offices of profit.

 The party has proposed that the government introduce a one-time pardon for the current lot of MPs who hold such offices. At the same time, the bill should de-link all the offices from profit, which means that the job should come without any perks like salary, official vehicle, bungalow and staff.

 We agree on this. Now that the cabinet has decided to re-introduce the bill without any changes, I dont think the two ministers meeting with Advani and Jaswant Singh is likely to bring about any change in our united stand, an NDA leader said.

 If there is no further development tomorrow, we are most likely to oppose the bill in Parliament.

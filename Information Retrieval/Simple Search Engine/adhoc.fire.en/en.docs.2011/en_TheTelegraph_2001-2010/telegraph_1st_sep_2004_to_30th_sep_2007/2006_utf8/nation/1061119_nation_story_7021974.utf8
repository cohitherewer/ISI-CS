 Travel papers for witness Bharti

 New Delhi (PTI): Bharti Yadav, the key witness in the Nitish Katara murder case, has been issued travel documents by the Indian high commission in London so that she can depose before the trial court on November 29.

 Bharti is the sister of the main accused Vikas Yadav, and her passport had been revoked on court orders. She was granted the emergency documents on Friday on Delhi High Courts November 14 order, her lawyer S.C. Bhuttan said.

 Police believe Bharti, who was in a relationship with Nitish at the time of his murder, was pressured by her brothers and father Uttar Pradesh strongman D.P. Yadav to flee the country after the murder in 2002.

 The high court, while restraining the police from arresting her, had directed the external affairs ministry to issue emergency travel documents, including a fresh passport to Bharti on her arrival in India for the deposition on November 25. However, the date of her arrival was rescheduled by the court on her request.

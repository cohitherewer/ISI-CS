 Toyota cloud on Japan cash

 ANIL BUDUR LULLA

 Bangalore, Jan. 10: The labour trouble that prompted a lockout at Toyota Kirloskar Motors here has had the Japanese questioning all future investments in India.

 The Japan External Trade Organisation (Jetro)s regional office here feels that if incidents like the Toyota standoff or last Julys Honda clash in Gurgaon are to be avoided, India needs to urgently amend its antiquated labour laws.

 Unless these laws are modernised, such incidents are a warning to those who want to invest here, Jetro investment adviser K. Kuboki told The Telegraph.

 He said there was too much complexity in Indias labour laws and the unions were too politicised. Somebody should look into it and make the laws more flexible.

 Jetro is under the Japanese ministry of economy, trade and investment. Its offices in New Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore offer investment advice to Japanese companies looking to set up shop in India.

 In Karnataka alone, two major Japanese projects are in the pipeline. One is a BPL-Sanyo joint venture in electronics and the other is a Toyota expansion. The auto major plans to set up an assembly line for its small-car project.

 Toyota representatives are currently in Bangalore evaluating the feasibility of the small-car project. This incident at TKM has left a bad taste. Will they be interested in any expansion plans now? Kuboki asked.

 These two projects are worth millions of dollars. Japanese companies are also planning various other smaller investments.

 Kuboki said the workers at the Toyota Kirloskar factory did not understand the Toyota philosophy.

 While we get good, technically qualified people, they need to understand that every second counts for the Japanese. We always set a higher standard to achieve higher efficiency. The employees should be more cordial with the management.

 Trade union sources said US companies are more understanding while European companies are tolerant towards trade unions. It is only the Japanese who deal with unionism with a heavy hand.

 Protests by the Toyota Kirloskar employees continued for the second day in front of the state labour commissioners office. 

 Yesterday, company representatives refused to attend a reconciliatory meeting, saying the atmosphere was not conducive to talks. The talks have now been postponed to Thursday.

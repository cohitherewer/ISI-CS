 Mumbai turns up drug heat 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, June 9: Police today cracked down on drug addicts in Mumbai in a spin-off to the Rahan Mahajan case, arresting 97 in simultaneous raids in various parts of the city.

 Twenty officers and 65 constables of the anti-narcotics cell conducted the operation. Mumbai drug peddlers had gone underground last week anticipating such a drive was coming.

 The raids came a day after deputy chief minister R.R. Patil declared that the police would adopt a zero-tolerance policy to drug abuse. All 83 police stations were asked to keep vigil on drug dens.

 Patil also indicated that the police would keep tabs on parties in pubs and discotheques. These had come under the scanner last year after Salil Chaturvedi, promoter of apparel brand Provogue, was arrested on charges of allegedly selling narcotics at the Provogue Lounge.

 During the investigations, the police had received an anonymous letter from a journalist linking Rahuls name to Chaturvedi and the Provogue case. But no specific investigations were made.

 A Delhi police team led by station house officer Suresh Kaushik of Connaught Place police station has been camping in Mumbai to crosscheck leads given by Sahil Zaroo.

 The team visited St Xaviers College where Zaroo studied and the Marine Drive police station where a case was lodged against him in June last year for smuggling shahtoosh shawls.

 Zaroo had escaped with some shawls from his uncle Rafiq Mohammeds showroom at the Hilton Towers and is wanted in the case. The Mumbai police will move the Patiala House courts next week for custody of Zaroo.

 Based on Zaroos June 1 phone records, the night he allegedly carried seven grams of heroin to Pramod Mahajans Safdarjung Road house, the team is on the trail of a city discotheque manager, Haroon Sheikh, and a ramp model, Ria.

 Sheikh works with popular night spot, Velocity, in Tardeo. Ria is believed to be a reformed drug addict and a close friend of Zaroos.

 Zaroos phone records show he had called Haroon and Ria just before visiting Rahul. Senior police officials declined comment.

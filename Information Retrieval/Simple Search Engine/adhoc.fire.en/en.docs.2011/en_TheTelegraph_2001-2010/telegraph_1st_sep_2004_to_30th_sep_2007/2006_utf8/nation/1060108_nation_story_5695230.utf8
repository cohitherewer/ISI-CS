 Crorepati guru guns for No. 1 crown

 - Ambition to outshine Rajneesh, set up Rs 100-cr yog peeth

 Lucknow, Jan. 7: Whether he is talking of things spiritual or temporal, Baba Ramdev likes to think in crores.

 So, yoga is Bharatiya swabhiman, karoron sal purana vigyan (the pride of India, a science one crore years old).

 And his ambition is to set up a Rs 100-crore Patanjali yog peeth and become, his followers say, the countrys tallest guru eclipsing the likes of Mahesh Yogi and Rajneesh.

 The swami in his early forties is believed to make crores from his Divya Yog Mandir Trust, which runs a hospital, pharmacy, herbal garden and a cowshed in Hardwar, besides a chain of residential Vedic schools across north India.

 But the silver tongue that built the empire in just 10 years by promising magic cures finds it just as easy to fashion persuasive socialist slogans, as the CPM has found out to its chagrin.

 Bargar ka matlab barbadi (burgers mean ruin), the Baba advises his followers. Maggi ka matlab kire ho jana (eating Maggi will turn you into insects).

 As for the soft drinks manufactured by multinationals, they are no better than toilet cleaners. So whats a healthy diet? Vegetables and milk, of course.

 That has had the anti-multinational Mulayam Singh Yadavs and Lalu Prasads eating out of his hands, splitting the CPMs secular alliance. Dividing the men of science had been just as easy.

 The Baba had come under fire a few months ago from eminent doctors and rationalists. Dr Purushottam Lal, a cardiologist with Delhis Metro Hospital, said the yoga gurus claim that he can cure critical heart blocks has led to several heart attacks.

 He warned that practitioners of traditional medicine should be closely monitored because some patients develop slow heart rate and low blood pressure after taking their medicines.

 In no time, the Baba had found specialist doctors to endorse his claims. Dr K. Mishra, senior heart specialist with Lucknows Sahara Hospital, was one.

 The Babas yoga books now proudly quote him: Yoga is more effective in curing diseases than other systems. Yoga has given miraculous results in curing cancer and hepatitis B. Yoga, Ayurveda and allopathy are now linked to one another.

 Which is why his associates scoff at CPM leader Brinda Karats campaign to brand him a fraud whose herbal cures are laced with animal parts and human bone powder.

 The Babas dream (of emerging Indias no. 1 guru) is unlikely to be spoilt by these controversies, says a smug Swami Adbhutananda.

 The Baba, in true godman style, does talk about awakening the self and meditation, too. But what has earned him the faith of millions is primarily his medicines and the yoga-made-easy courses taught through cassettes, CDs, books, television and the Net.

 The price for a first-hand view is rather steep. Make enquiries about attending any of his yoga camps and you are told to contact Punjab National Bank for registration.

 A front row seat costs Rs 2,100 and a view from the back Rs 251. The average fee for a city doctor is about Rs 200.

 The Baba says his high ideals justify the high rates. I take the money for a sacred cause and for nation-building. I have to build the yog peeth (at Bhadarabad near Hardwar) to serve the people.

 What about the charge that he doesnt pay his labourers?

 An ashram is not an industry, he explains coolly. Those who work for me are not workers but volunteers.

 His associates believe his star is on the rise. Ramdev has powerful friends across the political spectrum.

 While N.D. Tiwari, Uttaranchals Congress chief minister, praises him for popularising Hardwar and Uttaranchal abroad Mulayam salutes the guru for curing people through yoga and Ayurveda, vindicating our traditional science.

 They as well as the BJP chief minister of Rajasthan, Vasundhara Raje, have promised to make Ramdevs yoga books compulsory reading in schools. Jharkhands Arjun Munda, too, is an admirer.

 Ramdev, a Haryanvi, is said to have studied Sanskrit grammar, Ayurveda and Vedic philosophy at the gurukul of an acharya named Baldev. He became an ascetic and, on the strength of severe austerities in the Gangotri caves, achieved self-realisation and acquired extraordinary powers.

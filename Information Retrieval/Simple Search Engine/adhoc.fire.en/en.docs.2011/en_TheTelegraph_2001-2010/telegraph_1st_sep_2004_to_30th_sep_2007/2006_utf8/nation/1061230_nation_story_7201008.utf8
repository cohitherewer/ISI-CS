 Britain to Bhutto: Were keeping Koh-i-noor

 AMIT ROY 

 The Koh-i-noor on the crown

 London, Dec. 29: How Zulfikar Ali Bhutto asked Britain for the Koh-i-Noor diamond and was told politely but firmly to get lost is revealed in documents released today by the National at Kew, west London, under the 30-year rule. 

 Britains determination to cling on to the most famous diamond in the world it now sits behind bullet-proof glass as part of the Crown Jewels in the Tower of London was summed up in a pithy note sent by a British Foreign Office official to James Callaghan, then the occupant of 10 Downing Street. 

 The secret memo said: The stark facts are these: i) We have the Koh-i-noor diamond, whether or not our possession of it is legally justified, ii) we have made it clear that we are keeping the diamond, adducing the best arguments to support our contention. 

 The diamond last made an outing during the funeral of Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother, on April 10, 2002, when the crown, which she had worn at her coronation in 1937 with the Koh-i-Noor as its centrepiece, rested on a velvet cushion placed on her cortege. 

 As her coffin was brought out of Westminster Abbey for the stately drive to St Georges Chapel, Windsor, the Koh-i-Noor sparkled in the sun. To old Britons, the diamond reminded them of imperial Britain; to old Indians, it represented stolen property. 

 Perhaps the most sensible comment was made by Kevin Rushby, a British author who traced the diamonds trail over the centuries in his book, Chasing the Mountain of Light. Ideally, somebody should steal it from the Tower of London that would be very much in the spirit of the Koh-i-noor. The British basically pinched it off the Sikhs, who pinched it off the Afghans, who pinched it off the Persians, who pinched it off the Indians. Like the story of any big diamond, its one of human greed and brutality, he said. 

 Bhutto, as Prime Minister of Pakistan, wrote a letter to Callaghan on August 13, 1976, pointing out that the diamond had been taken from Lahore to London in 1849 but continued to hold immense sentimental value in Pakistan. Its return to Pakistan would be a convincing demonstration of the spirit that moved Britain voluntarily to shed its imperial encumbrances and lead the process of decolonisation. Indeed, it would be symbolic of a new international equity, strikingly different from the grasping, usurping temper of a former age. 

 Callaghan learnt that Queen Victoria had been gifted the Koh-i-Noor by Maharajah Duleep Singh, a minor, in 1850. Queen Victorias husband, Prince Albert, had the diamond re-cut in 1852 to lend it more sparkle and set it in the Imperial Crown. But it was now reduced from 186.1 carats to 106 carats. 

 In 1911, it was worn by Queen Mary, and then, set in a new crown, in 1937 by the late Queen Mother at the coronation of her husband, George VI. The last time it was worn was in 1953 when the Queen Mother wore it at the coronation of her daughter, Queen Elizabeth, the present monarch. 

 Callaghan scribbled a hand-written comment: Very awkward! 

 The foreign office in London advised Callaghan to play a tried and trusted card divide and rule. He should hint that the Indians had a claim too (which has been made by, among others, journalist Kuldip Nayar). 

 A note from the South Asia department told Callaghan: As you will see, we have as good a legal title to the diamond as a treaty can give us, and it is most unlikely that even if we were disposed to give it up, Pakistan would turn out to be the only claimant. 

 In his letter to Bhutto on September 20, Callaghan chose his words carefully: I need not remind you of the various hands through which the stone has passed over the past two centuries, nor that explicit provision for its transfer to the British Crown was made in the peace treaty with the Maharajah of Lahore which concluded the war of 1849. 

 Callaghan said: In the light of the confused past history of the Koh-i-noor diamond, the clear British title to it and the multiplicity of claims which would undoubtedly be made to it if its future were ever thought to be in doubt, I could not advise Her Majesty the Queen that it should be surrendered to any other country. I am very ready, however, for the same reasons, to give you the assurance for which you asked in your letter, that the British Government do not contemplate any action which might prejudice the claim to the diamond which you have set out in your letter. 

 Bhutto released the correspondence to the Pakistani press and the matter was quickly forgotten. 

 In July last year, the Natural History Museum, which has had an original plaster cast of the uncut Koh-i-Noor in its collection for more than 150 years, put a replica on public display.

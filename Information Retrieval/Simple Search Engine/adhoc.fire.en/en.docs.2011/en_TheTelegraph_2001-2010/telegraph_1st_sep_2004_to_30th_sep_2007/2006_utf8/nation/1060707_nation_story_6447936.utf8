 Drive to decongest Calcutta

 - 84 municipalities picked 

 for satellite town project

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, July 6: Bengal urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya today said the government has laid emphasis on reducing congestion in the city by taking up development of small and medium towns outside the Calcutta Metropolitan Area.

 We have launched the Centre-sponsored scheme ? Integrated Development of Small and Medium Towns ? to improve infrastructure in these towns so that people need not come to Calcutta. 

 The scheme includes building of roads, augmentation of drinking water, modern sewerage and drainage system, improvement of health services and opportunities of employment, Bhattacharya told the Assembly while placing his departmental budget for 2006-07.

 He said 84 municipalities had been identified and brought under the purview of the scheme for which Rs 141.33 crore, including central assistance of Rs 85 crore, has been allotted to the local bodies to take up various development projects.

 If we improve infrastructure in other urban towns and people get all facilities, the rush of people to the city will reduce. Calcutta is already congested and if we fail to check the rush, we have to face a major problem in the days ahead, the minister said.

 Taking part in the debate, the Trinamul Congress and the Congress alleged that people from the villages and other towns are compelled to come to the city because of lack of proper facilities there.

 Presenting the Rs 1,838-crore budget, the urban development minister said the governments thrust areas were improving drinking water supply, sewerage, solid waste management, employment generation and slum development.

 He said the government had taken up a Rs 170-crore project to improve solid waste management in Uttarpara-Kotrang, Rishra, Konnagar, Serampore, Champdani and Baidyabati in Hooghly district. The government has taken a soft loan from the Japan Bank for International Co-operation to implement the project. The loan has to be repaid in 50 years.

 Bhattacharya said the government has submitted a detailed project report to the Centre for five drinking water projects totalling Rs 229 crore, two transport infrastructure projects of Rs 117 crore for the city and two drinking water projects for Durgapur and Jamuria worth Rs 44 crore, seeking financial assistance from the National Urban Renewal Mission Fund.

 The minister said the state government has urged the Centre to ease conditions set by the fund. If the state wants money from the fund, it has to repeal the urban land ceiling act and reduce stamp duty to 5 per cent and introduce independent regulators for urban services.

 The state government has already reduced stamp duty to 6 per cent in urban areas.

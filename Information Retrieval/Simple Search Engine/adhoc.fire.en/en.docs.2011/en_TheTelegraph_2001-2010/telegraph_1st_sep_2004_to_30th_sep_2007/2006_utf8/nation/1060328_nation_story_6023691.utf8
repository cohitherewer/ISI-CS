 Lalu plea

 Patna, March 27: Rashtriya Janata Dal chief Lalu Prasad today appealed to all secular MLAs and parties to support his second candidate for the Rajya Sabha biennial election slated for Wednesday.

 Along with the Congress, the Nationalist Congress Party and the CPM, the RJD has a total of 65 votes in the Assembly. Each of the seven candidates in the fray needs 35 votes to enter the Rajya Sabha.

 The RJDs first candidate, Jabir Hussain, is in a comfortable position to win the poll but its second nominee, Rajniti Prasad, is left with only 30 votes.

 The trouble for the party has come from the Lok Janshakti Party, which has put Lalu Prasads friend-turned-foe Ranjan Prasad Yadav in the field with speculation that the surplus NDA legislators and those from the CPI(ML) will back him to defeat the RJD.

 Shelter for Mumbai tenants 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Nov. 1: Harried house-hunters in Mumbai can take heart. Tenants could have agreements longer than the usual 11 months, those hefty deposits might just be sliced and laws on rental housing finance are likely to be made more transparent once the draft housing policy unveiled this evening takes concrete shape.

 The document released by chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh has two main objectives promote rental housing in a big way and use carpet area as the basis for sale and purchase of flats. The proposals are expected to benefit ordinary Mumbaikars trapped between escalating real estate prices and crumbling infrastructure.

 Owners in Mumbai were reluctant to lease their flats on rent due to apprehensions about tenants staking claim to the property. As a result, rented accommodation became scarce and expensive. We want to create an environment where rental housing is encouraged and new stock is created, said Swadhin Kshatriya, principal secretary, housing, in the state government.

 The government wants to move amendments to the provisions in the new rent control act to promote rental housing, Kshatriya said. For example, the live-and-licence agreements between owners and tenants have a strict tenure of 11 months. We could look at extending this period. Tenants are often confused about ownership details. We could bring greater transparency here. 

 Deposits of over Rs 1 lakh demanded by owners depending on the size of the apartment while signing the agreement will also come under the scanner, he said. 

 Under the old Rent Control Act of 1948, rents in Mumbai were frozen at 1940 levels. The issue is still before the Supreme Court and, therefore, we cant address it at this point. We plan to have interactions with the general public and invite their suggestions and objections before we finalise the changes, Kshatriya said.

 Another key aspect of the policy is the need for builders to stick to the carpet area the exact area within the inner faces of walls as the unit for sale and purchase of residential flats. Developers in Mumbai often offer a 900-sq-ft apartment while including other amenities in the building in that figure. As a result, a buyer could well be paying for 900 sq ft and actually getting 700 sq ft.

 But some dont find anything path-breaking in the policy. Carpet area is already there as a unit in the existing housing laws. Whats new in this? The point is that developers are violating the law. But has the government prosecuted any of them so far? asked environmentalist Debi Goenka. 

 The draft promises to implement this, but what measures the government finally takes in the final housing policy remains to be seen, he said.

 The draft is open to public debate till December 31 this year. The new policy will come into effect from January.

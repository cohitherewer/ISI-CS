 ITC foray into Bengal farm retail

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Calcutta, Nov. 8: Amid the debate over Reliances agri-retail project in Bengal, ITC rolled out its retail road map part of a Rs 1,250-crore investment package at a closed-door meeting with senior state government officials today. 

 They have made a presentation and the model is different and also limited in scope if compared with the Reliance plan. First, they want to run a pilot project in Howrah and North 24-Parganas. We are studying their proposal, commerce and industries secretary Sabyasachi Sen said. 

 The word retail is missing from the Rs 15-crore project plan christened horticulture initiative that includes a demonstration farm and research and development centre, a cold-pack house and three to four cash-and-carry outlets. 

 According to the plan laid down by the Rs 16,500-crore cigarette-to-hotel conglomerate, the 20-acre demonstration farm will showcase best practices and sell high-yielding seeds. The cold-pack house will act as a procurement and value-addition centre. Choupal Fresh outlets will be used to reach out to wholesalers, small retailers, pushcart vendors and even retail customers. 

 The fact that this model will not affect existing players the biggest concern in the Reliance model is expected to favour ITCs proposal, which ushers in ITCs e-Choupal network to Bengal. 

 E-Choupal is a chain of computer kiosks in rural India from where the company buys and sells farm produce. The model is running successfully in Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. 

 Protecting farmers interest is the governments priority. We will see the results of ITCs pilot project before giving them permission to roll out the project in other parts of the state, Sen said after the one-and-a-half hour presentation at the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation boardroom.

 Senior officials from commerce and industries, land and land reforms and agricultural marketing departments and the Howrah and North 24-Parganas district magistrates attended the meeting. 

 The company will invest Rs 1,250 crore in the state over the next few years. At this moment, we are ready to make investments in the horticulture initiative and the integrated food and logistics facility, said Nazeeb Arif, vice-president, corporate communications, ITC. 

 Besides launching the Choupal Fresh brand in Bengal, ITC wants around 60 acres to create production and logistics facilities with an investment of Rs 250 crore to support its agriculture and branded and packaged food business. Their proposal covers both new and existing businesses. The plan includes around Rs 850 crore for existing businesses like hotels, tobacco and paper, Sen said. 

 In the presentation, the ITC officials reiterated that the companys infotech business plan for Bengal was on track. ITC Infotech will set up a development centre on a 50-acre plot in or near Calcutta, the company confirmed. 

 It is also scouting for space in the state to set up two or three new hotels.

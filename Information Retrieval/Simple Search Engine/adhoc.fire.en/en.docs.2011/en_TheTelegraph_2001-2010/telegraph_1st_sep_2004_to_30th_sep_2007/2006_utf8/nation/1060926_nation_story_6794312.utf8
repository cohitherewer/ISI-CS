 Pakistan to open visa door wider

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 25: A more liberal visa regime between India and Pakistan is likely to be in place soon as Islamabad has offered to allow more travellers across the border.

 The offer to remove glitches in issuing visas came at a meeting of Saarc immigration officers in Delhi last week. Additional secretary (internal security) Qamar-U-Zaman, who represented Pakistan at the meeting, said Islamabad wanted to lift restrictions on travel.

 The objective is to promote easier travel within Saarc nations and, particularly, between India and Pakistan.

 Immigration officers from the region have been meeting regularly to keep intact the Saarc spirit of free movement. At last weeks meeting, the focus was on travel of privileged persons.

 This section identifies 32 categories of eminent persons, which include members of the judiciary, especially Supreme Court and high court judges, top-ranking government officials, members of Parliament and journalists. The Saarc stickers given to them allow easy procurement of visas.

 Pakistani officials said their government was in favour of expanding the privileged list at a bilateral level with India. An expanded list has already been submitted to Delhi for its response. 

 The Indian high commission in Islamabad issues more than 10,000 travel permits every month. India also wants to open new points across the Line of Control to allow more people to go across the border.

 The Pakistan high commission in Delhi clears about 300 visas every day.

 Islamabad claims that the decision to liberalise the travel regime was taken unilaterally as it was keen to promote exchanges between business communities. It also favours giving entrepreneurs multiple-entry facilities and long-term visas and is keen on increasing religious tourism.

 Blow to politics of clemency

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi/Hyderabad, Oct. 11: The Andhra Pradesh governor of the day had reduced a murder convicts sentence because he was a good Congress worker and his premature release wouldnt cause a reaction in his area.

 That act last year by S.K. Shinde today prompted the Supreme Court to rule that politics, caste or religion should never count in a grant of clemency.

 The court, which set aside Shindes remission of Gowru Venkat Reddys jail term from 10 to three years, noted that the official recommendation for clemency highlighted that the convict was married to a Congress MLA.

 If Reddy was prematurely released, his life would be safe because his wife is a sitting MLA and (has) police security, the Kunoor district probation officer had said. His report mentioned that Reddy was a good Congress worker and enjoyed sizeable clout in his village, Bramhanakotkur.

 The district police chief, too, recommended remission saying there would be no reaction in the area.

 The Telugu Desam, alleging misuse of the governors office by the ruling Congress, asked chief minister Y.S.R. Reddy and Shinde, now Union power minister, to resign. 

 The chief minister, however, denied the judgment was an embarrassment for his government, saying: We have religiously followed rules and regulations.

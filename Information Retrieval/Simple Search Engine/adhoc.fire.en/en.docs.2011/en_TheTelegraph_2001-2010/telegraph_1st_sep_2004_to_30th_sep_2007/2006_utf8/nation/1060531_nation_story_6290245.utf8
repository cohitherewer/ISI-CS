 War scrap in police station

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 30: Aghast soldiers of an army bomb disposal squad today detonated mortar shells and artillery shots in the Aravali Hills just south of the national capital after police in the industrial town of Faridabad hoarded the ammunition found on a roadside inside a police station.

 Common sense dictated that the police should inform the experts immediately, particularly after an October 2004 explosion in Ghaziabad in which nine workers were killed. 

 But in their wisdom, the Haryana police thought it was safer to pile the vintage bombs with illegible markings inside one of their own establishments.

 The deadly pile of war scrap was found near a garbage dump on the Surajkund-Palli Road last Thursday.

 The unexploded ordnance was inside the police station for three days. 

 The army bomb disposal squad based in Delhi cantonment was informed this morning and they gingerly removed the ammunition away for several hours from inhabited areas and into the wilderness of the hills before setting off controlled explosions.

 The total weight of the scrap was around 750 kg. Army sources said there were at least nine live bombs in the pile.

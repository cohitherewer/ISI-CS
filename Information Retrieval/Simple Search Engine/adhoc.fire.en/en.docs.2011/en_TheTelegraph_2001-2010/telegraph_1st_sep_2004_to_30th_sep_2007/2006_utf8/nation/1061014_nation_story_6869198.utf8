 Deserted by wife, man burns

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Chandigarh, Oct. 13: A man set himself on fire on Karva Chauth the day women fast for a long life for their husbands after his wife refused to return with him from her parents home.

 Yash Pal, whose wife Madhumati had left to live with her parents two months ago, is now recovering in a Hoshiarpur hospital. 

 On October 10, Yashpal went to her house in Gokul Nagar to bring her back but she declined, saying she no longer wanted to live with him. He said from his hospital bed that he set himself ablaze on the way back because her parents insulted him. They told him she would not return even if he killed himself, said Lakhbir Singh, officer-in-charge of Model Town police station.

 The police registered an FIR under Section 306 (abetting suicide) against Madhumati and her parents based on Yashpals complaint, but are planning to withdraw the case following revelations she was seeking separation because he ill-treated her and had no permanent job.

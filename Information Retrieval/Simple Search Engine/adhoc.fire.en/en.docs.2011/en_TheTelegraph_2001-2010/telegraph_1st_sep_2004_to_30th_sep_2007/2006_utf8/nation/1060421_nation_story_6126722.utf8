 Shoot-at-sight sightseers 

 BHARAT BHUSHAN

 Kathmandu, April 20: If one is Karan Singh, the Prime Ministers special envoy, then one travels with an armed escort during shoot-at-sight orders in the Nepalese capital.

 If one is Bruno Philippe of Le Monde and an old South Asia hand, one just walks out in the street shrugging ones shoulders and waving ones arms about asking for directions from the police. And they start giving directions.

 But what on earth does one do if one is an Indian journalist and with no Curfew Pass? A colleague and an old-Nepal hand suggested that it would be foolish to follow the footsteps of Bruno.

 There is a Tourist Shuttle dropping people to the airport. Why not pretend that one was leaving the country, board the shuttle and see how the protests were on the Ring Road that the bus to the airport would have to traverse, he suggested. At least one would get to see what was happening in the city. A splendid idea.

 The curfew be damned as suddenly one was legitimately on the road being escorted by local police, past the house of Pashupati Shamsher Rana (Devayanis dad and President of the Rashtriya Prajatantric Party), the palace of Crown Prince Paras and on to Narayan Gopal Chowk on the Ring Road.

 The riot police was all over and the protesters were kept at a distance. 

 They were visible in large numbers waving their flags. Then on to Chabahil Chowk. The shuttle bus could not pick up the tourists at the Hyatt as the demonstrators were blocking the road. Once again their numbers were huge.

 At the airport, the conductor agrees to take double the fare for dropping us back to the hotel, although he things he has got a couple of crazies onboard.

 Suddenly, there is static in the air as mobile phones begin crackling. 

 Apparently there are thirty-odd tourists stuck at Hotel Annapurna on Durbar Marg and they have a flight to catch. The shuttle bus driver and conductor are told to forget their lunch and rush there along with their police escort.

 So we drive like a Ferrari on the empty streets of Kathmandu in a rush to get to Hotel Annapurna. A gaggle of cheerful tourists gets is waiting to get in. So are some police officers.

 Sir, passport and airline ticket? one of them asks. We are tourists. Was this not a sightseeing tour? No Sir, this is a shuttle bus to the airport. 

 You should not be on this bus as you wont be allowed in unless you have a ticket to fly.

 The feigned noises of surprise do not impress the policeman as he calls his superior. The trick is not to break into Hindi or Nepali.

 Which is your hotel? the policeman asks. The Radisson. That is not our hotel but Karan Singhs. It would be a good idea to get dropped there. Lo and behold, a crew cursing about tourists who have no idea whether they are coming or going takes us there.

 There one finds Karan Singh keeping up a brave front after having spent two hours with the King ? including apparently sometime with the Kings mother. 

 When he readies to leave for the airport, we too make a move.

 There is a curfew, the hotel security guard informs us. Our hotel is 10 minutes walk away. When confronted by armed police, one just has to shout out the name of the hotel loudly like a lost soul. Straight and to the left, they say helpfully.

 Who says it is difficult to move around Kathmandu when there are shoot-at-sight orders?

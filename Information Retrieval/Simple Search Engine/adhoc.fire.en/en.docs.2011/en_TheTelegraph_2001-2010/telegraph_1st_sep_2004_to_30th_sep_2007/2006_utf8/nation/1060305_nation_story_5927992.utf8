 Probe into UP clash

 Lucknow, March 4: No fresh violence singed Lucknow today but the deserted streets betrayed the underlying tension after yesterdays anti-Bush demonstrations claimed four lives, including that of a three-year-old.

 Chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav has ordered a probe into the violence. The riot was unfortunate and we are not going to spare the culprits. After I receive the report, I will take immediate action against the accused persons, he said. 

 The Kesharbag and Aliganj localities looked tense this morning after rival groups had a heated exchange over a bandh called by the VHP. Markets in several areas and schools and colleges remained closed while traders took out marches demanding security. School examinations have been postponed.

 PAC and RAF personnel stood guard at all sensitive points of the city.

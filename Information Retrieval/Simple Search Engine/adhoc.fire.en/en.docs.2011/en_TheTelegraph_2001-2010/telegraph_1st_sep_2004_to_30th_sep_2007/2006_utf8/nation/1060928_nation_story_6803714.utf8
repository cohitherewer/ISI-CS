 BJP wakes up, forms panel

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Rajnath Singh

 New Delhi, Sept. 27: Images of a despondent Mamata Banerjee being comforted by Congress leader Priya Ranjan Das Munshi has wheedled a wave of sympathy from the BJP.

 BJP president Rajnath Singh today woke up to not just Mamata warming up to the Congress but also the reality of special economic zones (SEZs) stirring up political discontent across the country.

 In separate statements issued this afternoon, Rajnath set up a high-power committee to look into the issue of SEZs and condemned the CPM government for attacking an icon of peoples struggle like Mamata.

 Ms Banerjee was staging a peaceful protest against forcible acquisition of agricultural land at Singur. The act of police barbarism on a political leader, that too a woman agitating for the cause of poor farmers, has exposed the real face of the CPM. It is evident now that the Left has no regard either for farmers, women or, for that matter, basic expressions of protest in a democracy, he said.

 Reiterating that Mamata is still the BJPs ally, Rajnath expressed solidarity with her and the farmers set to be displaced in Singur.

 She is not only our ally but also an icon of peoples struggle against oppressive communist rule in West Bengal, he said.

 Turning his attention to SEZs, Rajnath said there has been a marked increase in oppression of farmers ever since the UPA came to power. The episode in Singur is another addition to the onslaught of state oppression against farmers, Rajnath said.

 Rajnath constituted the five-member SEZ committee despite the fact that the BJP has been officially promoting the concept. 

 At the partys national executive meeting earlier this month, M. Venkaiah Naidu had clarified that the BJP would continue to promote SEZs as a concept but simultaneously talk about better compensation packages for the displaced and their involvement in the development of the zones.

 The party is clearly eager to evolve a response that suits the current political context with most of its allies like Mamatas Trinamul Congress and the Janata Dal (United) planning protests against various sanctioned SEZ projects. 

 Dal (U) president Sharad Yadav has already stated that he is against acquisition of agricultural land for development of SEZs.

 The special committee has been set up to formulate the opinion of the Bharatiya Janata Party about SEZs. We have promoted SEZs as a concept but the way the present government has handled it needs special focus and analysis, said BJP spokesperson Prakash Javdekar.

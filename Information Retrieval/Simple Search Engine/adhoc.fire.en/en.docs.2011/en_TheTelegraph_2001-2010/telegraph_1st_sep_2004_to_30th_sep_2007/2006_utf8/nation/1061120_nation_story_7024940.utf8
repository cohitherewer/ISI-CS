 Kidnapper a wannabe Dhoom dude

 New Delhi, Nov. 19: If a movie is made on the twists, turns and flip-flops in the kidnapping of three-year-old Anant Gupta, the director wouldnt have to look far for his lead actor.

 The mastermind, arrested today with a fellow accused, claims to harbour Bollywood ambitions.

 The motorbike-riding cool dude criminals from the movie Dhoom were the inspiration behind the kidnapping of Adobe India CEO Naresh Guptas son, Chatrapal Dev told a televised news conference, his face hidden by a muffler.

 Chatrapal, who police say plotted the crime from a Mother Dairy depot opposite the Gupta home, was nabbed from Noidas Sector 14, barely a kilometre from where Anant was kidnapped on Monday. He told us he is an actor and has worked in a telefilm in Mumbai, said Noida senior superintendent R.K.S. Rathore.

 A fan of Dhoom star John Abraham, Chatrapal said the bike used in the kidnapping was stolen from near his home in Ashok Vihar, Delhi. Inspired by the cool manner in which the biker-thieves in Dhoom operate, he had decided to try a crime on a bike in real life. It isnt clear what association there is with the movie, since no kidnapping takes place in it, said Rathore.

 Matching the kidnap thrill for thrill, the ransom was flung out of a moving trains window just outside a platform, the police said.

 The Rs 50 lakh was to be deposited at a place in Surat. Naresh Guptas brother Lalit went to drop the money by train, but on the way the kidnappers called him and told him to drop the money at Meerut station, said N.B. Singh, inspector-general (Meerut range).

 Naresh added his own two bits of drama, playing on his laptop a taped conversation between Chatrapal and Anants mother Nidhi.

 The software executive revealed he had flown in a kidnapping expert from California on Monday. He confirmed what the police were already suspecting that the kidnapping was carried out by amateurs.

 Overshadowed by Chatrapals statements, the arrest of Vijay Chauhan in Gurgaon went almost unnoticed. Three accused are now in custody, with Jeetendra having been picked up on Friday hours after Anants return in an autorickshaw. Pawan, the fourth suspect, is still at large.

 Singh said Anant was first taken to Ashok Vihar. The kidnappers then moved from place to place in Uttar Pradesh, reaching Mathura. Then they went to Meerut.

 But the mystery over Anants return did not clear. The police had first said they themselves put him in the three-wheeler. Later, they backtracked when the auto-rickshaw driver said it was the kidnappers who had asked him to take the boy home.

 But Chatrapal today said he didnt know anything about how Anant returned home.

 Bid to shorten Goa tourist visas

 Panaji (PTI): In the wake of a controversy regarding foreigners buying huge plots of land in Goa, chief minister Pratap Singh Rane said on Wednesday that the state government would urge the Centre to shorten the duration of tourist visas from six months to three months. 

 Rane added that foreigners who want to stay longer would have to get commercial visas. 

 The state government recently revealed that 482 foreigners had purchased about 12 lakh square metres of land in the state. Activists under the banner of Goa Bachao Andolan have protested against the purchase of properties by foreigners. 

 The government is yet to ascertain whether the foreigners who have purchased properties in the state had arrived on business or tourist visas.

 Rain break for Narmada dam 

 vadodara (PTI): The controversial project to raise the height of the Narmada dam has been stopped following the monsoon.

 The dams height has so far been raised to 119 metres ? over 2 metres short of the targeted 121.92 metres. The matter has reached the Supreme Court over complaints of inadequate rehabilitation. The Gujarat government had then given an undertaking that construction would be stopped when rains began, following which the court had given the green signal to the project.

 Due to technical reasons, it was decided to suspend construction work on the dam till the monsoon is over, Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Ltd chairman P. K. Laheri said. He said ancillary work will continue.

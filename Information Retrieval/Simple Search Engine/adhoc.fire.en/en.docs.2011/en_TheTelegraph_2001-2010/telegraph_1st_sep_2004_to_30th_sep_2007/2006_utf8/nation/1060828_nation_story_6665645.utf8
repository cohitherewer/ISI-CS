 BJP elders fit, juniors ailing

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 27: The BJPs geriatric brigade seems bent on reversing the RSSs logic on infusing fresh blood into the partys top slots.

 Every member of the elders club L.K. Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi, Jaswant Singh and even A.B. Vajpayee seems to be in good health. But blood pressure, diabetes and a host of chronic heart ailments stalk the younger lot Rajnath Singh, Arun Jaitley, Sushma Swaraj and M. Venkaiah Naidu.

 Almost as a demonstration of the trend, BJP chief Rajnath Singh fell ill today, the second time in two weeks.

 Rajnath suffers from very high blood pressure. He had to be hospitalised on August 13, sweating and with high fever. He reportedly went through a series of tests, including an angiography for a suspected blockade in the heart.

 His staff, however, denied Rajnath had an artery blockade. It was high fever. And since he was admitted in a good hospital, he got a series of tests done, including angiography. But there was no blockade, an aide said.

 Today, he again developed high fever and was advised bed-rest for five days. Rajnath was so ill that he could not stir out in the morning for a function at the party headquarters.

 The elders, in sharp contrast, were in full attendance for the release of a book on the RSSs contribution to Indias progress.

 Vajpayee gave a long speech, followed by Advani who has been actively trying to warm his way back into the Sanghs good books. Advani makes it a point these days to attend any event even remotely concerned with the Sangh.

 Vajpayee has of late been leading the healthy elders pack with great gusto. Gone is the old glazed look and spells of incoherence. He is back in form leading protests, addressing party cadres and taking good-humoured swipes at his own colleagues.

 Apart from his knee problem, there is nothing much wrong with him. His contemporary Advani is fit as a fiddle as is Joshi.

 Contrast this with the second-rung leaders. Besides Rajnaths blood pressure problem, Sushma, Jaitley and Naidu suffer from diabetes.

 Sushma has been seeing a dietician for a long time to reduce weight. She has managed to lose about 10 kg and is constantly on guard about her health.

 Jaitley was hospitalised last July and had to undergo a bypass. He is extra cautious about what he eats.

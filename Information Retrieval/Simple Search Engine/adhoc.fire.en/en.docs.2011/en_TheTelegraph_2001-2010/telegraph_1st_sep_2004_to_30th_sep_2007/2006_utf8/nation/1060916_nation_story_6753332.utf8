 Security scanner on NRI

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 15: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) today submitted before the Supreme Court that monetary transactions between firms run by NRI businessman Vipin Khannas family and some foreign companies raised serious concerns about national security.

 An affidavit submitted by ED special director S.K. Panda said the family had received huge remittances from various foreign companies in violation of Fema. Some of these companies have been involved in arms deals.

 The apex court was hearing a petition filed by the businessman, whose passport has been impounded as a probe is on against him and his son Aditya for allegedly benefiting from the Iraq oil-for-food scam. The court said the passport could not be released for at least eight weeks. 

 The businessman is believed to be close to former foreign minister K. Natwar Singh, also accused in the scam.

 Panda said that in addition to the oil scam investigation, a separate probe has been started against Khanna and the companies he runs.

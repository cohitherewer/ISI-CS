 Calcutta, June 11: The Bengal CPM secretary had to caution cadre and supporters today against any involvement in the filling up of water bodies, a crime common in urban and semi-urban areas in the wake of a real estate boom. 

 We have to fight against corruption both in the party as well as the society. The environment is getting more and more polluted because of the filling of the water bodies. Sinister rackets are at work, Biman Bose said at the foundation-laying ceremony for the partys new Howrah district office, named after his predecessor, the late Anil Biswas.

 We have to be watchful that no CPM or other Left party activist or supporter or member of a mass organisation has connection with such evil caucuses (that fill up water bodies). We have to ensure that water bodies and wastelands are not filled up, Bose said. 

 Sections of the CPM have often been accused of hobno-bbing and having a nexus with real estate developers or, as they are commonly called, promoters. 

 When Bose spoke, the new environment minister, Mohanta Chatterjee, was seated on the dais. 

 The minister later said a comprehensive act to save the states endangered water bod-ies was in the offing. We are working on it as there is no comprehensive act to save the water bodies except the one enacted by the fisheries department and the law dedicated to safeguard the East Calcutta Wasteland.

 He added: The jurisdictions of the intervening authorities conflict in the present laws. So the Wasteland Institute has been asked to study the latest status of the water bodies in the state as we lack the latest data on them. 

 Boses warning and Chatterjees indication of a new legislation can be construed as a veiled caution against land-grabbing in the name of development. 

 Veteran leader Jyoti Basu spoke in the same vein. 

 We have to create a synergy between development and struggle, he said and warned against ignoring agriculture while striving for industrialisation. 

 The industrialists are now asking for land to set up new units. But we cannot afford to ignore agriculture or food security. The sixth Left Front government had protected agriculture. Our seventh government has promised to do the same, Basu said. 

 Anil Biswass widow Geeta attended the programme organised by the CPMs Howrah committee.

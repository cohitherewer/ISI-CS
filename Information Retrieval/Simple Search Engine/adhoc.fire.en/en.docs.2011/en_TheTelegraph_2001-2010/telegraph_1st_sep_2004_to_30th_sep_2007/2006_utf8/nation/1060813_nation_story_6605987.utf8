 Quota not to be bulldozed

 New Delhi, Aug. 12 (PTI): Amid hiccups over a consensus on the OBC quota, the oversight committee chairman, Veerappa Moily, has ruled out any bulldozing of the proposal for 27 per cent reservation in elite and central educational institutions. 

 He also asserted that protecting the excellence of educational institutions would be the main theme of the committee.

 There is no question of bulldozing the implementation of 54 per cent. We are clear about it. I will examine institution-wise and decide whether they can go in one go or in phases, Moily told a television channel. 

 Its an open-ended decision. Im keeping my mind open, this side or that ... Some institutions may come forward and say that with the kind of proposals made by the oversight committee, we can go at one go. That is likely to happen. And some institutions will say it is impossible even if all the facilities are lying there.

 Asked whether the committee would allow individual institutions to decide on the implementation, he said very true, very true. 

 Moily admitted that all the five sub-groups, which have recently submitted their interim reports to the panel, have said it is not possible to implement (the quota) at one go. 

 It has to be phased, he emphasised.

 The former Karnataka chief minister said he will not attempt to persuade the sub-groups to change their mind. Instead, he will hold extensive meetings with all the institutions as well as with experts from outside to understand their reasons before the oversight committee takes a final decision based on a holistic approach.

 Moily said he has convened a meeting of the governing council chairmen and the apex council chairman on August 17 and invited experts from all over the country on August 28 and 29 to ask them what should be the process.

 The committee was asked to submit its final report to the government by August 31.

 Dismissing the opinion expressed by Planning Commission member Bhalchandra Mungekar and UGC chairman Sukhdev Thorat that the question of staggering the implementation was beyond the remit of the committee, he emphasised that protecting the excellence of educational institutions was the main theme. 

 That is their personal opinion, Moily said.

 Cong leader sets himself on fire

 Jalandhar (PTI): Under the burden of huge debts, a local Congress leader allegedly committed self-immolation at his residence on Saturday.

 Mela Ram, who had been depressed for some time because of his financial condition, doused his body with spirit and set himself on fire sustaining 80 per cent burn injuries, police said. He was rushed to the civil hospital where his condition was declared serious.

 My younger brother had borrowed some money but could not return it on time and the financier was continuously threatening my father, the local block presidents elder son Naresh said.

 He used to practise as a registered medical practitioner but had stopped two years ago after suffering a paralytic attack, Naresh said.

 Rams self-immolation bid comes three days after another Congressman, Gopal Kashyap, set himself on fire in Patiala.

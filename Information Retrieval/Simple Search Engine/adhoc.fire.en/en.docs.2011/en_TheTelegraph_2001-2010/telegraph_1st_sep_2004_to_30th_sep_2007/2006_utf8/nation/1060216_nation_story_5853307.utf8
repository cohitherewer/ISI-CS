The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Few takers for poll fund plan

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 15: Parties sang different tunes at a meeting convened by the Election Commission today to discuss the Centres proposal on state funding of polls. 

 Although there was near unanimity on curbing poll expenditure and strict enforcement of the model code of conduct, there were few takers for the cabinets 10-point proposal on partial funding by providing facilities like rent-free telephones, accommodation and petrol or diesel to candidates.

 The representatives of six national and 34 (out of 44) regional parties flooded the panel with their recommendations. A consensus eluded even the partners of the UPA. 

 The CPM rejected the proposal, saying it was like offering subsidy to parties and would be a burden on the exchequer. The CPI said the limit on expenditure for the Lok Sabha and Assembly elections ? Rs 25 lakh and Rs 10 lakh, respectively ? should stay. 

 The BJP suggested the model code of conduct be given more teeth through legal sanction and said if state funding is put in place, all other means of raising money should be checked.

 The BJPs deputy leader in the Lok Sabha, Vijay Kumar Malhotra, said rules must be framed about exit and opinion polls before the elections in five states later this year.

 The regional parties voiced their grudges, too. If the Telugu Desam was annoyed with electronic voting machines, Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee alleged her phones were being tapped by the Left Front government in Bengal.

 However, chief election commissioner B.B. Tandon appeared satisfied with todays meeting, saying that though there were discordant notes, the majority view was in favour of state funding.

 He said all parties had agreed on strict enforcement of the limit on poll expenditure. They also wanted a fund to be set up and the panels infrastructure to be strengthened to handle it, Tandon added.

 Suggestions were also given on the sharing of election expenditure. At the moment, the Centre and states shoulder an equal burden. Some parties suggested that the Centres share be increased to 70 per cent.

 Tandon said the proposals forwarded by the Centre were on extending support in kind instead of cash and were based on the Indrajit Gupta committee report. Apart from political parties, views are also being invited from NGOs, academics, experts and independent observers, the poll panel chief added. 

 After formulating its opinion, the commission will send its recommendations to political parties before handing it over to the government.

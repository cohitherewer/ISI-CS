 FIR need not have minute details: SC

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 22: The Supreme Court has held that absence of details in a first information report (FIR) cannot make the prosecution case doubtful.

 A bench headed by Justice Arijit Pasayat said that an FIR was not an encyclopedia of facts concerning a crime and a prosecution case could not be doubted merely because the FIR did not contain the minutest details.

 There was nothing wrong in an FIR which presented a broad picture, the court said, adding that it had to be noted that there was an element of stress at the time of lodging an FIR in a criminal case.

 It is not necessary that minutest details should be stated in the FIR, the court said, upholding the conviction of four accused in a murder case. 

 The accused had challenged their conviction by the Andhra Pradesh High Court on the ground that the FIR by the eyewitness did not mention the source of light in which he saw them. 

 The court also rejected the contention of the accused that the witness could not be trusted because he was related to the deceased. Relationship could not be a ground for doubting the credibility of a witness, it clarified.

 It is more often than not that a relation would not conceal the actual culprit and make allegations against an innocent person, the court said. It, however, cautioned that each case had to be judged on its own facts.

 Rejecting another contention, the court said that falsity of a particular material witness could not be a ground for acquittal of the accused. 

 Even if a major portion of evidence is found to be deficient, in case residue is sufficient to prove the guilt of an accused, conviction can be maintained. 

 It is the duty of courts to separate grain from chaff, the court said, adding that where chaff could be separated from grain, it would be open to the court to convict an accused notwithstanding the fact that evidence of some witnesses had been found to be deficient.

 The Kalpakkam power station: Army guard

 Chennai, Aug. 14: The army today took over the security of Madras atomic power station at Kalpakkam and its research divisions for the first time in 30 years.

 An informal curfew is in force around the township, 65 km from the Tamil Nadu capital, but employees of the two nuclear plants and research units can go to work from their homes located within the complex, sources said over phone from Kalpakkam. 

 Two days ago, a contingent of the National Security Guards (NSG) was flown in from Delhi in line with the step-up of security at all atomic power installations in the country after the train blasts in Mumbai. 

 The army, which took charge from the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) last night, immediately imposed restrictions on the movement of people. It is not clear how long the checks will be in place but officials believe they have been dictated by the need for more safety ahead of Independence Day and warnings about terror strikes on key targets.

 Anybody found in suspicious circumstances is being questioned until they can establish their identity satisfactorily. Vehicles are also being checked thoroughly, the sources said.

 Visitors entry has been severely restricted and those with official appointments are being screened with sophisticated gadgets, the sources said. The home ministry has also moved with alacrity to install a foolproof security system. 

 Two naval ships are put on stand-by off the Kalpakkam coast, where fishermen have been advised not to venture out to the sea for the next few days. 

 In the rest of Tamil Nadu, police have stepped up security for the I-Day celebrations, particularly at the venue in Chennai where the flag-hoisting ceremony will be held.

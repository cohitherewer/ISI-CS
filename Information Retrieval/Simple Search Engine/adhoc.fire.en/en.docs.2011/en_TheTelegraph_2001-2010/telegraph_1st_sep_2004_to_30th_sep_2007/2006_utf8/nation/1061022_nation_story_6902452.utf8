 A police party from Rajouri police station, led by station house officer Gurmeet Singh, intercepted the van at Darhali bridge and arrested its conductor Aijaz Ahmed, a resident of Khabland, and seized his mobile phone.

 have left for Delhi from Kathmandu.

 The group left by flight on Friday and will head for Dharamshala from Delhi to meet their religious leader, the Dalai Lama.

 The Tibetans had arrived in Nepal on September 30 from China, but not before one of them, a nun in her mid-twenties, was allegedly killed by Chinese firing, while another 33 were arrested by Chinese soldiers.

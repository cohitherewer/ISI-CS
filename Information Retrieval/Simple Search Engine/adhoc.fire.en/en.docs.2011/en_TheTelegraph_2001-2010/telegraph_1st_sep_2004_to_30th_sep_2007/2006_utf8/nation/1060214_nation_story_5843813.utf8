 India angle in Baluch talks

 IMTIAZ GUL

 Islamabad, Feb. 13: Two days before Afghan President Ha-mid Karzai lands, Pakistani officials are readying to take up prickly issues such as cross-border firing by Afghan troops and the alleged Indian role in the turmoil in Balu-chistan.

 Foreign office spokesperson Tasneem Aslam briefed the media on Karzais engagements between February 15 and 17. 

 Other officials said the government would possibly touch on the issue that stems from the presence of several Indian consulates in Afgha-nistan.

 A private news agency, Online, also put out a story quoting official sources that intelligence agencies have found proof of the involvement of Indias Afghan consulates in creating unrest in Baluchistan.

 The agency said President Pervez Musharraf was likely to discuss the issue with Karzai, and Pakistan would take it up directly with the Indian government if the situation did not improve.

 Intelligence agencies have provided solid proof that Indian consulates in Afghan cities Kandahar (and) Jalalabad are providing financial assistance to Baluch tribal leaders, along with funds and weapons to the Baluchistan Liberation Army and the Baluchistan Liberation Front.

 Besides funding Baluch militants, these consulates have also aided people carrying out terrorist acts along the Pak-Afghan border... this support has played an important part in worsening the situation in the province, the report said.

 Indicating involvement of a foreign hand in Balochistan without actually naming India, Pakistani leaders, including President Musharraf, have often warned the rebellious tribal chieftains, including Nawab Akbar Khan Bugti who is currently living in a cave in a mountainous region in Balochistan, to respect the writ of the government and behave like good citizens.

 Even early this month, Musharraf had declared the rebels would not be allowed to flourish and challenge the writ of the government in Balochistan.

 More than 100 people have been reportedly killed in a fresh wave of violence that followed unveiling of plans by the federal government in December for exploration of oil and gas reserves in Balochistan Kohlu town, some 500 km east of Quetta.

 Baloch nationalists allege the federal government of exploiting the oil, gas and other natural reserves without passing on the benefits to people in their province.

 In another interesting spin ahead of Karzais visit, the government said Afghan police seized about 700 home-made bombs, hidden in orange crates, being smuggled into Afghanistan from Pakistan on Sunday but did not give the location of the seizure and the identity of the person arrested.

 Wires and fuses were also found among improvised explosive devices found in the Kunar province on the border with Pakistan, the interior ministry said.

 The Hindukush mountain range in the extreme northwest of Pakistan forms a natural border between the two countries.

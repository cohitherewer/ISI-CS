 CPM sticks to petrol cry

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Hyderabad, June 8: The CPM today attacked the Centre on the oil price rise, but refused to take the responsibility of bringing down rates.

 At the first meeting of its central committee after the election victories in Bengal and Kerala, the CPM demanded a total rollback of the price increase ? Rs 4 a litre for petrol and Rs 2 for diesel ? announced on Monday. 

 Party general secretary Prakash Karat set the tone for the three-day meeting in Hyderabad by launching an attack on the UPA government, which the CPM supports, over the oil price rise and lapses vis-?-vis the common minimum programme. 

 Someone had to bell the cat, he said, justifying the partys decision to call a nationwide strike on June 13.

 But the party, which said it had taken on the onerous responsibility of ensuring that the Centre gets rid of the rightist policies that still linger from the days of the NDA, rejected petroleum minister Murli Deoras suggestion that state governments cut sales tax to reduce the burden on the people.

 Where are the resources with the state governments? If they reduce the taxes on fuel, then they cannot meet the basic ends of their welfare programmes, said Nilotpal Basu, the party spokesperson.

 Ruling out a rollback, Deora had said the hike was essential to save oil companies from bankruptcy. He said that while the Centre had been absorbing a part of the losses of the oil companies, the states have not done their bit by reducing sales tax. Sales tax rates in Bengal, a Left-ruled state, are among the highest in India. 

 Basu accused the UPA government of having little concern for the poor, and said Deoras suggestion was meaningless.

 Reminded that the Prime Minister is firm there will not be a rollback, he said: We are not talking about what the government feels or says. When a popular movement builds up against the decision, the government has to budge and agree to what people say is right.

 The conclave is being held in the air-conditioned Jubilee Hall in the sprawling public gardens in the heart of the city, a sharp contrast to the central committee meeting three years ago in a theatre.

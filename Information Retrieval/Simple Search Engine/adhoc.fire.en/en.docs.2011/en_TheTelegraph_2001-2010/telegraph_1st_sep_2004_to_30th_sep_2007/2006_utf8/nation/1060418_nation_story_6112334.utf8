 Stroke in middle of Bihu concert

 Guwahati, April 17: A mild cerebral stroke midway through a Bihu concert in Guwahati last night sent balladeer Bhupen Hazarika to hospital and his legion of fans within and outside Assam into collective shock.

 Hazarika had taken to the stage at the Noonmati Refinery Bihutoli, one of the popular venues for Bihu functions in the capital city, despite looking unwell. The audience ? and those watching the concert live on a local television channel ? fell silent when the singer-composer had to be escorted off the stage after he had sung a few songs.

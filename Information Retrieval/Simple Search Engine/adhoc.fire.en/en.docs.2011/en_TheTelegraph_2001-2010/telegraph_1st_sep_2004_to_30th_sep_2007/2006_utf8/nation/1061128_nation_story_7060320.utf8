 Warm-up lunch for Pak visit

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 27: Pakistan foreign minister Khursheed Mehmood Kasuri had often complained about the absence of a counterpart in India. This afternoon he found one, when Pranab Mukherjee hosted him to lunch.

 Kasuri, who had come to Delhi to attend the wedding of Mani Shankar Aiyars daughter yesterday, was apparently satisfied at his first encounter with Mukherjee. I am happy that a senior Congress leader is in charge of external affairs, he said.

 The first meeting between the two leaders turned out to be an ice-breaking event, one that yielded a commitment from Mukherjee to visit Pakistan on January 13.

 He would hand an invitation to President Pervez Musharraf for Aprils Saarc summit in Delhi, and lay the ground for a possible visit by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. 

 Mukherjees visit would be the first by a foreign minister in 15 months. We will have substantive talks at that time. This was just an informal meeting, Mukherjee said.

 After lunch, Kasuri said the meeting was held to know each other better. He is coming to Islamabad in January; then we will discuss concrete issues.

 Foreign secretary Shiv Shankar Menon accompanied Mukherjee, while Kasuri was there with his wife and Pakistan high commissioner Aziz Ahmed Khan. Tourism minister Ambika Soni gave Kasuris wife company.

 It is the way you look at the glass, half full or half empty. I see it as half full, Kasuri said after a one-on-one with Mukherjee. He was referring to the dialogue process.

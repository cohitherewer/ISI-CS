 Bomb defused in Mumbai station

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, March 11: Mumbai police today averted what could possibly have been a repeat of the Varanasi explosions, defusing a crude bomb found in a mens toilet at Byculla railway station.

 Officials from the anti-terrorist squad reached the spot after an anonymous telephone call around 10 am said unattended baggage lay in the toilet on platform No. 1 of the central Mumbai station.

 Bomb experts then carried out controlled blasts to defuse the explosive, which contained ammonium nitrate. Mainly used for quarrying, ammonium nitrate was one of the ingredients in the bombs that killed nearly 20 in the March 7 Varanasi blasts.

 The explosive material was about one and a half kilograms. Initial analysis by our bomb experts showed that ammonium nitrate was the chief explosive, but it was mixed with something else. We are trying to ascertain what the other component was, the joint commissioner, anti-terrorist squad, K.P. Raghuvanshi, said. 

 The bomb had no ignition wires to trigger an immediate explosion, the officer added. Therefore, it was perhaps stored there for easy accessibility for a future strike.

 The detection of the bomb, just days after the Varanasi blasts and on the eve of the 13th anniversary of the 1993 Mumbai blasts, forced the police sound a general alert in the city.

 Soon after the bomb was defused, Thane police investigated another scare after a caller informed that a bomb had been placed in the Jeevandani temple in the western suburbs. The call turned out to be a hoax.

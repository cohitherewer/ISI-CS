 Little uniformity on land policy

 New Delhi/Ranchi, Jan. 3: Against the backdrop of the Orissa clash, the Centre is planning to ask states to build consensus on finalising compensation for land acquired for industry so that a less controversial benchmark could act as an unofficial guideline.

 Officials in Delhi said the lack of a standard rehabilitation package in cases of tribal land acquisition has helped fuel unrest in several places. 

 The problem is that each state negotiates its own rehabilitation package for tribals. There is little uniformity in the way they go about it, leading to comparisons that trigger unrest, an official said. 

 Fearing that the disturbances would allow extremist elements such as Maoists to exploit the situation, the officials said the Centre cannot afford to remain aloof much longer and must coordinate with states to work out a solution.

 Earlier, steel plants used to negotiate packages which included a job for at least one member of each family displaced, besides cash compensation for land, housing estates and community benefits like medicare. 

 Jobs could be given because these were huge mills and the industrial process required tens of thousands of unskilled or semi-skilled workers, an official said. 

 However, with steel-making and mining becoming increasingly mechanised, total employment in a modern steel mill has come to a fourth or fifth of earlier numbers, and unskilled workers are hardly taken. This factor has led to the need to come up with new models for rehabilitation that create alternative employment opportunities.

 We had the case of a river valley electricity authority giving tribals collective fishing rights to the dam they created as part of the rehabilitation package. This gave them an alternate livelihood, an official said. 

 Land acquisition issues have also become entangled in price issues. Often land is acquired at a point of time and nothing is done there for a decade or more. The acquisition price is set on the date of formal notification but the tribals are displaced after this lapse of time. By then land prices escalate, creating an impression that tribals have been short-changed. The state governments need to work out a remedy to this situation too, the official said. 

 In Jharkand ? a state where big projects are slated to come up ? opinion leaders suggested ways to tackle the land controversy.

 Sign MoUs with the people first, advised Cardinal Telesphore Toppo, while former Ranchi University vice-chancellor Ram Dayal Munda suggested a formula by which land would revert to the tribals or land-owners once industries shut shop or mines closed down.

 Jharkhand Mukti Morcha chief Shibu Soren said if land is acquired for industry, compensation should take the form of equity shares and the displaced should be assured of fixed returns.

 During the day, Tata Steel managing director B. Muthuraman went to Ranchi and was closeted with chief minister Arjun Munda. While none of them would speak on the meeting, it is believed the discussion was held in the context of the Orissa clash.

 Flat sealed, boy inside

 Mumbai, Dec. 13: A 13-year-old boy was trapped for five hours in the balcony of his seventh-floor flat today after civic officials sealed it following a court order. 

 He was rescued when police broke the seal at 11 pm.

 The flat was sealed after the owner of the building filed a case against the boys parents, accusing them of defaulting on maintenance charges.

 The boy, Rishabh, told reporters that he fell unconscious in the balcony after being hit by an official of the Brihanmumbai Corporation. 

 His father blamed the BMC team for his sons ordeal as it had begun sealing the flat without giving his family time to move out and the police because they arrived five hours late.

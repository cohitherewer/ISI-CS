The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Vaiko at full blast, this time for Jaya

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chennai, April 17: Its Sunday evening and an ideal hour to campaign. A small convoy of MDMK leader Vaiko arrives near a studio on the busy Konnur High road. 

 Vaikos van, fitted with loudspeakers, takes a narrow road just opposite the studio in the citys Pursawalkkam constituency. As they reach the spot, high-decibel crackers greet them.

 The smoke from the crackers creates a haze over the rows of chairs lined up on the road for the audience. The makeshift stage is packed to capacity with functionaries from the ADMK, MDMK and the Dalit Panthers of India (DPI), who comprise the alliance formed by the ADMK.

 Curious voters gather to watch the chemistry of the alliance led by ADMK chief Jayalalithaa, who has long forgotten slapping terror charges against Vaiko.

 Donning a white dhoti-kurta, Vaiko, who recently did a U-turn to side with Jayalalithaa, thunders: Reserve your Sivakasi firecrackers for May 11 when the results will be announced as the ADMK-led alliance will win the elections convincingly. 

 His voice reverberates. 

 But suddenly, power goes off and the blaring loudspeakers fall silent. Vaiko quickly pulls out a battery-operated microphone system from the van and continues with his speech.

 The MDMK chief launches a frontal attack on the DMK manifesto, which promises ration rice at Rs 2 per kg, free colour TV sets and free gas stoves to all families below poverty line (BPL), besides redistribution of about 55 lakh acres of wasteland in Tamil Nadu. 

 Kalaignar (as DMK chief Karunanidhi is known) says he will give rice at Rs 2 per kg to ration card holders in the state. But what were the DMK ministers in the Union cabinet doing when the central government recently raised the issue price of rice under the PDS (public distribution system)? he asks.

 And you have a finance minister in P. Chidambaram who wants to slash subsidies in general, but here in Chennai holds a meeting for the DMK saying the rice and free colour TV set schemes are feasible.

 As for the colour TV freebie, the DMK-Congress-PMK-Left parties have not quite figured out the economics, argues Vaiko. Kalaignar says he will import cheap Chinese TV sets that cost Rs 2,000 apiece. 

 But will this not attract anti-dumping laws and what is the finance ministers response to this when several local TV manufacturers have already folded up? he asks.

 Will Sumangali Cable Vision, owned by Kalanidhi Maran, Karunanidhis grandson, and other family members, controlling 80 per cent of the cable connectivity in the state, also offer free cable connections with the free TV sets?

 He heaps scorn on the offer of a free gas stove to each BPL family as well, saying the sop is ridiculous when the Centre is planning to hike the price of cooking gas to Rs 400 a cylinder to cut down the losses of PSU oil firms.

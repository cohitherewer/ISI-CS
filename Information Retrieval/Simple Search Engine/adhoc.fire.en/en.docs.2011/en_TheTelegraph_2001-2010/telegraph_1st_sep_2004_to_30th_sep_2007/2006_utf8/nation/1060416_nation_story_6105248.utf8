 Dawood scent brings cops to cooks village

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, April 15: A village of cooks specialising in Mughlai cuisine in Bahraich district, about 180 km from here, today came into the focus of the hunt for Dawood Ibrahims whereabouts.

 Police and intelligence sleuths swooped on Parpatganj this morning to raid the home of Mohammed Jibreel Khan, the cook sacked by Dawoods brother Anees Ibrahim after he contracted Hepatitis B.

 The 42-year-old Jibreel, arrested at Delhi airport on Wednesday night as he stepped off a flight from Pakistan, has reportedly told police that Dawood has a house in Karachis Defence Housing Authority area. Whenever the D-company boss was in the port city, he would take Jibreel on loan from his brother.

 The police didnt reveal whether the raid on the villages only brick-built house threw up any corroborating evidence, but said they found the building vacant. 

 The entire family ? Jibreels wife, father and elder brother, both men visually impaired ? fled on Thursday morning, hours after the arrest.

 The police found some burnt letters, documents and bills, including telephone bills.

 Big padlocks hung from two rooms inside which the sleuths found a TV set, refrigerator and telephone while the two other rooms on the outer side of the house offered little other than a few pieces of furniture, farm equipment, cassettes and a small music system.

 The minority-dominated Parpatganj, 51 km from Bahraich town, has long been known as a khansama ka gaon (cooks village). Many of its former residents are chefs at hotels and restaurants in Mumbai and Kuwait. Those who stayed back are poor farmers. 

 The village has a madarsa but no primary school.

 Jibreels family owns just a three-bigha plot but their two-storey house stands out amid the mud huts. The police also found a generator and expensive coolers.

 Jibreel was the king of cooks. But whenever he came here, he would keep a low profile, neighbour Fakir Mohammad told the police.

 The man had last visited the village a year ago and stayed for a month. Although Mumbai police had issued a lookout notice against him in 1999, Jibreels name doesnt figure in the Uttar Pradesh crime files. We have searched our records; his name isnt there, Bahraich senior superintendent of police Vijay Kumar Garg said.

 Jibreel had left the village for Mumbai in 1991. He stayed in Mumbai for five years and was hired by Dawoods sister, Garg said. In 1996, he left for Dubai and from there went to Pakistan to serve Anees.

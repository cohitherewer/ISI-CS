 The Indian Museum in Calcutta: Goof-up under glare

 New Delhi, May 7: At Calcuttas Indian Museum, some mothers-in-law, like Caesars wife, are above suspicion.

 Among the museums exhibits are a series of supposedly African ivory carvings, bought in 2003 at Rs 5.5 lakh. The decision to buy them was based merely on a statement made by the individual seller that these artefacts were collected from African countries by her mother-in-law, says the comptroller and auditor- general of India.

 No effort was made to establish the carvings antiquity or historical interest, the CAG adds. There was no evidence to establish that the artefacts deserved a place among the museum objects.

 The CAG, which has done an audit on the museum, Victoria Memorial and Asiatic Society, has slammed each of these hallowed institutions for lack of planning and direction, sloppy security and slipshod documentation.

 It found that the store rooms at the Victoria Memorial and Indian Museum were neither air-conditioned nor had adequate air circulation, putting the artefacts at risk. Lighting was poor at the Victoria store room, which was damp thanks to seepage of water.

 The memorial stated that the building and the roof were in dilapidated condition due to non-repair of the monument for decades.

 The CAG cites how poor security at the Indian Museum allowed a fifth-century Buddha head from Sarnath to be stolen in December 2004. The spot wasnt covered by closed-circuit television.

 Thieves, however, cannot be sure about laying their hands on something valuable every time: these institutions dont have a benchmark to evaluate objects before ? or after ? they buy them.

 The CAG cites how the museum paid Rs 20,000 for a pair of bangles after a seller declared she had inherited them from her grandmother. No reasons were recorded for the purchase, so whether the bangles have any historical value is anybodys guess.

 The museum had till November 2004 installed neither a fire alarm nor a smoke detector as recommended by a review committee in December 1992.

 The Asiatic Society had treated with similar contempt a home ministry surveyors suggestion in September- October 1993 for visitors passes, CCTV, walkie-talkies and modifications at the main gate. Victoria had put in place a Rs 14-lakh CCTV network in May 1990, but it was lying inoperative for months since it was unserviceable and outdated.

 The security guards at the museum and the Asiatic Society lack proper training, the CAG says.

 The findings were sent to the parliamentary accounts committee last November, says the 2005-2006 annual report of the Union department of culture. The House committee visited Calcutta to discuss the matter with officials of these three institutions.

 The CAG says only 15 per cent of the objects in the Indian Museums anthropology section have been registered in detail. All three institutions are way behind their photo-documentation targets.

 They lag equally in conservation work. A review in 1995 found that though the Indian Museums conservation laboratory could treat 1,000 artefacts a year, it had treated only 1,500 in five years.

 None of these institutions had a well-defined set of objectives, the CAG said. They didnt coordinate their efforts, leading to overlapping, inefficiency and under-utilisation of resources. Their activities often lacked direction.

 Also, none has done a physical verification of its possessions in five years.

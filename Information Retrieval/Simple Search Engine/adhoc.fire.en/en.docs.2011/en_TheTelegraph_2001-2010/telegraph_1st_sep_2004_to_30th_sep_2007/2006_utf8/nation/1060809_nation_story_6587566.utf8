 Day One: Ingredients required to make a hand grenade; precautions to be taken while making the grenade

 Day Two: Functions of different parts of a grenade; quantity of gelatine to be put; functions of the spring, lever and the hammer

 Day Three: Weight of a grenade; when to be used; effective area; precautions to be taken while using the grenade

 The hand-written notes recovered from a bunker in Jhumra hills tell the chilling story of how experts are being used by insurgents to train an army of instructors in subversive activities. That the notes were meant for instructors is made clear by the noting that classes should include practical demonstration and that students should be encouraged to ask questions. 

 The language, claim security forces, indicates that the expert tutors have a military background. The manual is elaborate and lays down every possible tool required to make a grenade, including the innocuous spoon, blade, weights and scissors. The businesslike noting also records that 25 to 30 per cent of the grenades fail to explode for various reasons.

 There are other interesting discoveries being made from the Jhumra hills. Bunkers abandoned by the extremists, for example, have yielded a huge cache of cashew nuts, used obviously as dry ration for people on the move or for people digging in their heels in the forests. Both, medicines and stretchers, found stored in different bunkers, indicate the state of preparedness.

 Diaries recovered from bunkers abandoned in a hurry have also provided a wealth of information. It is astonishing to find small-time area commanders keeping accounts in crores, said Ashok Kumar, an assistant commandant of the CRPF. Other police officers, including the DIG (coalfield), believe that Naxalites collect around Rs 350 crore every year in the Jhumra region. 

 Extortion and levy from forest contractors and those engaged in transportation or smuggling coal and explosives make Jhumra a lucrative operation, believe security forces. This, they say, also explains the desperation of the Maoists to regain lost ground in Jhumra.

 The manuals and diaries, however, do not interest security forces much. Nor are they too enthused by the recovery of a large number of volumes containing Maos collected works. 

 They evince a lot more interest in the recovery of 4.5 kg of RDX, a lathe machine, a mortar and the 200 and odd landmine bombs during the last month. 

 Security forces are increasingly discovering claymore mines or directional mines. They can be fired in any direction and at any angle and they are often positioned on tree-tops or on boulders or simply on the ground. Landmines are becoming less effective in Jhumra because security forces have learnt to rely more on walking, explains Anil Palta, DIG (coalfield). Therefore, they have shifted to claymore mines.

 Another interesting discovery made by security forces is Motorola wireless sets, electric wires and telephone cables. We know the extremists are making good use of technology, that they also use mobile phones and now we know that they have the capability of setting up wireless networks over at least short distances.

 Above all, raiding teams have seized around Rs 5 lakh in cash, stashed in plastic bags, from the bunkers. Judging by the accounts mentioned in diaries and documents which have fallen into the hands of security forces, the amount recovered is almost certainly peanuts, concedes CRPF commandant Ranveer Singh, who also admits that he has heard stories of crores of rupees buried in the ground in the Jhumra hill range. Much more, he feels, is locked up or invested in the metros.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Minister gives food scare

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, July 7: Bengal might be staring at a crisis of food if the trend to acquire farmland for industry or infrastructure projects continues, land and land reforms minister Abdur Rezzak Mollah said in the Assembly today.

 We still have a surplus in foodgrain. But productivity has declined because land for cultivation has been reduced. Our food security may be in crisis if we fail to increase agri-productivity by five times and reclaim fallow and arid land for agriculture and related activities, said the minister, who had earlier opposed the governments land acquisition in his backyard, South 24-Parganas. 

 What Mollah said today delighted the Trinamul Congress which, along with the Congress, has been arguing that chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees drive for rapid industrialisation and urbanisation is robbing farmers of their livelihood.

 The ministers admission is the tip of the iceberg. Gov-ernment reports reveal that 5.87 lakh hectares of farmland have been converted for non-farm use in the past 10 years, Trinamul legislature party leader Partha Chatterjee said. 

 Replying to a question by the CPMs Samsul Islam Mollah, the land and land reforms minister said 300,000 acres of non-farm land have been reclaimed for cultivation by the Left Front government in its 30-year rule. But at the same time, 400,000 acres of agricultural land have been acquired for urbanisation and industrialisation. 

 Rezzak Mollah hinted that the use of agricultural land for industries and urban development increased after Bhattacharjee took over as chief minister. 

 Around 2.5 lakh acres of farmland? have been converted for non-farm activities over the past five years. 

 The minister said that out of the 88.75 lakh hectares (around 2.1 crore acres) of land in the state, 32.87 lakh hectares are categorised as non-farm. Most of these are in the backward districts of Bankura, Purulia and West Midnapore.

 According to experts, one of the indicators of food security is that a small farmer should have at least 12 decimals (8 cottahs) of land. In Bengal, such a farmer holds 16 decimals at present. 

 The gap is decreasing, Mollah warned.

 According to some observers, Bengal has yet to attain actual food security. It produces 11 per cent surplus rice and 40 per cent surplus vegetables, but it is 50 per cent deficient in wheat, 75 per cent short in pulses and has to buy 60 per cent of oilseeds from other states. 

 A senior government official had earlier said food security shouldnt be the sole deciding factor. Many developed nations dont produce enough food but have a robust economy, given their industrial advancement.

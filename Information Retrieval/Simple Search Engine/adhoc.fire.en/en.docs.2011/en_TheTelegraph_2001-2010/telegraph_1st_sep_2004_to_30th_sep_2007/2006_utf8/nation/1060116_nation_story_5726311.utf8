 Rs 3-crore tax order to BCCI

 Mumbai, Jan. 15 (PTI): The Central Excise and Service Tax Appellate Tribunal (Cestat) has ordered the Board of Control for Cricket in India to pay Rs 3 crore by February 27 towards its service tax dues for the period 1999-2000 to 2002-2003.

 The BCCI is liable to pay Rs 11.19 crore as service tax for the revenue earned from advertisements and sponsorships from various companies for Test matches during the period, commissioner of central excise (service tax) Satyendra Singh said.

 The commissioner said his office had issued a notice to the BCCI asking the board to pay the dues.

 However, the BCCI filed an appeal before the appellate tribunal, which stayed the order and asked the board to make an interim payment of Rs 3 crore.

 The BCCI has been asked to file a compliance report by February 27, when the date of the next hearing will also be decided.

 In December 2005, the BCCI, by awarding official kit sponsorship to sports accessories major Nike for Rs 196.66 crore, had become the worlds most valued brand as seen by sponsors.

 Kashmir councillor among trio in Mumbai 

 MUKHTAR AHMAD 

 Srinagar, Jan. 9: The three Kashmiris recently arrested by Mumbai police as Lashkar-e-Toiba militants are two traders and an Opposition National Conference municipal councillor, say Jammu and Kashmir police.

 One of the three, Arshad Ahmad Badroo, has been identified as a municipal councillor from the north Kashmir town of Sopore.

 According to the police here, Badroo is also a close relative of the slain former Hizb-ul Mujahideen commander, Abdul Majid Dar.

 The other two arrested have been identified as Mohammad Ramzan Haji and Khurshid Ahmad Lone, both fruit traders and residents of the north Kashmir town of Bandipore in Baramulla district.

 We have no past records on any of the three persons arrested by Mumbai police, a senior police officer said.

 Militant leader Dar hit the headlines in July 2000 when he announced a unilateral ceasefire in Kashmir, which later led to a meeting between the then Union home secretary and four top Hizb commanders in Srinagar.

 Irked by Dars unilateral announcement, the Muzaffarabad-based militant groups supreme commander, Syed Salauddin, had withdrawn the ceasefire. 

 Dar was expelled from the outfit and later killed.

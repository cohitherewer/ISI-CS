 TN aims gun at all colleges 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chennai, May 24: A day after the Centre announced the Other Backward Classes quota in its higher education institutions, Tamil Nadu pledged to bring even private colleges under the regime.

 The new Karunanidhi government also promised separate reservation for the religious minorities in all educational institutions as well as government jobs.

 Government colleges in the state already have Backward Classes and Most Backward Classes quotas, which together roughly correspond to the Centres OBC quota that has sparked bitter protests in recent weeks across medical colleges in the country. In all, 69 per cent seats in the states government-run and aided colleges are reserved.

 In his address to the new Assembly today, governor S.S. Barnala said the government would enact bills providing for mandatory reservation for Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, Backward Classes, Most Backward Classes and other de-notified communities in unaided, non-minority, self-financing educational institutions.

 The 93rd Constitutional Amendment Bill passed by Parliament last year allows the central and state legislatures to enact laws reserving seats in government as well as private institutions.

 Two weeks ago, the Maharashtra cabinet had cleared the plan for an ordinance to reserve 50 per cent seats in all professional colleges, including private unaided institutions.

 Barnala also said that the fees at government engineering and medical colleges, increased manifold by the previous government, will be reduced.

 To put an end to the prevailing confusion in admissions to professional courses in the state, the government will scrap the common entrance test (CET) from the academic year 2007-08.

 The Jayalalithaa regime had tried to abolish the exam twice in the past two years, saying it put candidates under extreme stress and was unfair to rural students, but each time the move was struck down by the courts.

 Barnala said ration card holders would be provided with quality rice at Rs 2 a kg ? a DMK poll promise -- from June 3 this year. The distribution of free colour TV sets to poor households will start on the eve of September 15 ? the birth anniversary of the late Annadurai, the DMKs founder.

 The upper age limit for applicants for government jobs will be relaxed from 32 to 37 to make up for the freeze on recruitment clamped by the previous regime.

 The government will not only revive the marriage assistance scheme for poor women but raise the cash from Rs 10,000 to Rs 15,000. It will continue Jayalalithaas popular scheme of providing free bicycles to all plus II students.

 The governors address, expressing the DMK viewpoint, criticised the ADMK governments performance: The economic growth rate of Tamil Nadu has been less than the national average.

 Yet, in his address to the concluding session of the previous Assembly on January 13, Barnala had said: Despite the challenges posed by a devastating tsunami and unprecedented floods, Tamil Nadu is likely to record an economic growth rate in excess of 8 per cent in 2005-06?.

 The ADMK walked out of the House in protest today.

 Left skids on oily ground

 June 9: The CPM and its Left allies today found themselves on the defensive following Congress-ruled Maharashtras decision to freeze sales tax on petroleum products.

 Maharashtras Congress-NCP government has agreed not to charge sales tax on the Rs 4 and Rs 2 increase in petrol and diesel prices effected earlier this week.

 Senior leaders of the CPM and other Left parties admitted that the Congress strategy could blunt their plan to intensify the campaign against the fuel price hike.

 The issue was discussed in the context of the fuel price hike, said a senior CPM leader from Bengal now in Hyderabad in connection with the partys central committee meeting. 

 We think we will have to go beyond the immediate interests of the Left ruled-Bengal, Kerala and Tripura and concentrate on building up political consensus across the country. 

 Preferring anonymity, several CPM leaders admitted that the Left-sponsored agitation, expected to peak on June 13, would look weak before long, thanks to the Congress ploy.

 After the Maharashtra development, it will be difficult to make the common people understand that we are trying to build a campaign on an issue far bigger than a mere Re 1 or Rs 2 reduction in prices, said a CPM politburo member. 

 For the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government, the situation is expected to be embarrassing. Bengal, along with Maharashtra, is among states that levy high sales tax ? Rs 9.24 on a litre of petrol now.

 Finance minister Asim Dasgupta said he would not comment. I cannot say anything on this now as the state budget presentation is due this month (June 23).

 Kerala, also ruled by the CPM, has an even bigger problem. The preceding government, of the Congress, had not levied sales tax on the extent of the fuel price rise the last time, deciding to take a revenue loss of Rs 200 crore instead.

 Speaking at the end of the second days proceedings of the CPM central committee, politburo member Sitaram Yechury said: Out of the Rs 123,000 crore revenue from taxes on petroleum products, the Centre corners Rs 93,000 crore. Hence, its argument that state governments should reduce their taxes is meaningless.

 The CPM and its allies will seek to impress upon the people that advanced states like Maharashtra can afford to forego a portion of sales tax because they have many revenue-raising options. Less developed states like Bengal, Tripura or Kerala are neither placed in the same way nor are they bound to follow the advanced counterparts. 

 The Left will try to create space for manoeuvring by stepping up efforts to have non-Congress and non-BJP forces co-opted into the campaign against Delhi. We are already in talks with Janata Dal (United) and are keeping watch on how the NDA handles the issue, said G. Devarajan, a senior Forward Bloc leader.

 Yechury dismissed the claim by Telugu Desam Party leader Chandrababu Naidu that the Left was with him on the move to form a third front, but said the CPM had no problems working with him in the mass agitation against the fuel price hike.

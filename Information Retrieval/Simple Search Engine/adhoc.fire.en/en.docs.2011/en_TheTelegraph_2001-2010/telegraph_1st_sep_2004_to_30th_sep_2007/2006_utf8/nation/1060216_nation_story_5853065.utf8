 Bengal high on dropout list

 MONOBINA GUPTA

 New Delhi, Feb. 15: A report by a research institute has clubbed Bengal with states that have the worst dropout rates among children in the 11-13 age group.

 Authored by the Social and Research Institute, the report puts the national average of dropout rate among children in the 6-10 age group at 6.1 per cent. For the 11-13 age group it is 8.56 per cent.

 Among states faring worse than the national average in the 6-10 age group are Bihar (17.29 per cent), Bengal (6.34 per cent), Uttar Pradesh (6.97 per cent), (and) Jharkhand (9.42 per cent), says the report. The states with the worst figures in the 11-13 age group include Bihar (16.22 per cent), Jharkhand (13.33 per cent), Bengal (12.86 per cent) and Uttar Pradesh (10.84 per cent).

 But, in contrast with the national trend of a higher dropout rate among female children, Bengal has more dropouts among male children up to 5 years of age, says the report.

 The report comes at a time when the Centre is planning to introduce a substantial hike in allocation ? from Rs 7,156 crore to Rs 11,000 crore ? to the Sarva Siksha Abhiyan in the forthcoming budget. But, experts said that increased allocations do not necessarily mean a reduction in the dropout rate or an improvement in the quality of education.

 The report underlines the existing urban-rural divide. In the 6-13 age group, 7.8 per cent children dropped out in the rural areas. Bengal has a higher average: 9.46 per cent. Madhya Pradesh is slightly behind with 9.44 per cent. The worst states are Manipur (17.91 per cent) and Bihar (17.77 per cent). Uttar Pradesh has recorded 8.05 per cent.

 Bengal, with 5.64 per cent dropouts in urban areas, has a higher rate than the national average of 4.34 per cent in that category.

 The average of the estimated number of Muslim children out of school is 9.97 per cent. The states faring worse include Bengal (11.33 per cent) and Bihar (28.34 per cent). In the case of Scheduled Caste children, the national average stands at 8.17 per cent. The states doing worse are Bihar (21.4 per cent), Jharkhand (21.42 per cent) and Chhattisgarh (9.1 per cent).

 For years the government has been trying to bring down the dropout rate with schemes like mid-day meals, which it hopes will act as an incentive. The success, however, has been erratic. Even though enrolment has gone up, it is neutralised by a persisting dropout rate.

 The survey covered 5,001 urban and rural units throughout the country.

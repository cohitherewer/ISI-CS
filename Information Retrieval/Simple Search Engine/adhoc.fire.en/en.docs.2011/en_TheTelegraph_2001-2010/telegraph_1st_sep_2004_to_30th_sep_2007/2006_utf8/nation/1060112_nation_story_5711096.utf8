 Court relief for Delhi juveniles 

 New Delhi (PTI): After spending a chunk of their lives in the childrens home here, 10 boys were reunited with their loved ones, courtesy the juvenile court, which slammed the authorities for not making any effort to trace their parents.

 My judicial conscience is pricked about the manner in which the Child Welfare Committee under the social welfare department of the Delhi government appears to be functioning. Restoration of neglected children is supposed to be their prime objective, juvenile justice principal magistrate Santosh Snehi Mann said.

 Tired of their life under detention for year, 14 boys aged between seven and 13 had fled the home in search of their parents on the night of December 28, 2004. They were, however, caught and presented in court. Moved by the story of their long confinement, Mann ordered the juvenile welfare officer to trace the families of the children. 

 Disadvantaged plea to UPSC

 New Delhi (PTI): Delhi High Court has 

 issued notices to the Centre and the Union Public Service 

 Commission on a petition seeking a stay on the May 2006 

 civil services examinations until the government relaxed 

 the norms for physically challenged persons on a par with 

 other socially disadvantaged people.

 Petitioner Sunil Kumar, a physically challenged candidate, urged that disabled persons be allowed at least 10 attempts. He complained that while the candidates belonging to SCs and STs are granted unlimited attempts and OBCs get seven attempts, physically challenged persons get only four on a par with the general quota.

 The respondents have four weeks to file their replies.

 Stampede

 Tiruchirappalli (PTI): Eleven people 

 were injured in a stampede that occurred while removing

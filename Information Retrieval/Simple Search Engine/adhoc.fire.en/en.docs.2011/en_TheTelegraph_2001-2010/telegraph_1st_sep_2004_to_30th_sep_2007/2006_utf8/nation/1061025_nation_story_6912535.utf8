 If in doubt, dont summon:Apex court

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 24: A person not named as an accused in a criminal case should not be summoned for trial just because some witnesses might have implicated him or police changed their minds, the Supreme Court has ruled.

 Such a person can be tried only if the judge is satisfied that there is not just a doubt but enough prima facie evidence against him, the apex court said.

 But if the trial court feels the prosecution is likely to fail to prove the charges against this person, it should turn down the plea to summon him.

 (Courts) power under Section 319 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is not to be exercised in a mechanical manner. Only because some evidence has been brought on record, the same by itself may not be a ground to issue processes (against a person not on the list of accused), the apex court said.

 It added that courts had a duty to see that the innocent are not prosecuted.

 The court, however, upheld a Patna High Court order asking a trial court to consider an application to prosecute a person named by witnesses in a murder case.

 The person had been named in the first information report, but the trial court had accepted the district police chiefs contention that he had been falsely implicated.

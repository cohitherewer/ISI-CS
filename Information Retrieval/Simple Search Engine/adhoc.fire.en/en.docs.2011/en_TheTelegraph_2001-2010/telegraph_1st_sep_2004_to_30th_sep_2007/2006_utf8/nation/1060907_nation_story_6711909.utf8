 Question: Who are those politicians?

 Telgi: Mr Sharad Pawar, Mr Bhujbal.

 Q: And in Karnataka?

 Telgi: In Karnataka, I cannot name, because I have told everything to the boss... still there are no arrests. 

 Q: Now if you tell, the arrests will be made. Tell me about the politicians. 

 Telgi: Politicians are the backbone of this business, and I would prefer not to take names.

 Q: Who has threatened you?

 Telgi: Threatening is there... the SIT (special investigation team) report says... somebody will kill me.

 But God is great, he will not allow this mission... make it a failure.

 Q: Who is the boss?

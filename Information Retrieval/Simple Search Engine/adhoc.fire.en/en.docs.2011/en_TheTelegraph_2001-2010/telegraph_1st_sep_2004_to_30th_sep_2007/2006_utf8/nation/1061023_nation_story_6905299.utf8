 Chew on this, Congress gifts gutka to gain votes

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Vidisha (Madhya Pradesh), Oct. 22: With no known method yet of getting an electorate addicted to a political party, the Congress has settled for second best.

 The party is quietly distributing the sweet and extremely addictive 50-paisa gutka to shore up its chances in the October 30 Vidisha Lok Sabha bypolls. The brand shares its name with the Congress candidate, Rajshree (in picture).

 Gutkas health hazards include cancer and the Congress-led government at the Centre is thinking of banning its sales across the country. 

 A party campaign manager who didnt wish to be named said: At 50 paise, its much cheaper than posters, banners or badges. We are distributing hundreds of small pouches in the villages, asking voters to remember the brand name. Its having a great impact, for anything free is welcomed.

 The BJP plans to complain to the Election Commission against its rivals dirty campaign. Its unethical and shows the bankruptcy of their ideas. Such gimmicks dont fetch votes anyway, state minister Narender Singh Tomar said.

 The largely rural constituency near Bhopal has returned Congress nominees only twice since the 1967 election in 1980 and 1984 and that too by narrow margins. The seat fell vacant after its MP, Shivraj Singh Chauhan, became chief minister a year ago.

 The Congress needed a bright idea because it is lagging its rivals thanks to a lightweight candidate and a lack of resources and star campaigners.

 Rajshree, wife of local Congress leader Rudrapratap, is pitted against state BJP minister Rampal Singh and veteran RSS leader Raghunandan Sharma, fielded by Uma Bhartis Bhartiya Janshakti Party.

 Diwali and Id have prevented the Congress campaign from hitting top gear. Id will be celebrated on October 24 or 25 depending on the sighting of the moon, leaving barely three days for campaigning.

 Besides, the Congress is divided with most state-level and local leaders sulking over ticket distribution. State party chief Subhash Yadav had pitched for Bollywood starlet Nagma but was vetoed by Union minister Arjun Singh and All India Congress Committee general secretary Digvijay Singh.

 Neither Arjun nor Digvijay has plans to show up to campaign for Rajshree, sources said.

 Some states had outlawed gutka sales on health grounds, but were forced to backtrack after the Supreme Court ruled last November that the Centre alone could impose such a ban.

 Union health minister Anbumani Ramadoss has asked the law ministry to suggest a watertight way of banning gutka by December this year so that it cant be challenged in the courts.

 Cops quiz Salman on threat calls

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Question hour

 Mumbai, Dec. 13: Salman Khan was questioned on the alleged Bollywood-underworld nexus at an undisclosed location in Bandra this evening by crime branch officials investigating a 2001 case.

 Salman is just a witness in the case, and there is no case against him. He cooperated with the police and replied to all their queries, his lawyer Dipesh Mehta said.

 Officials met him after the actor returned home he lives in Bandra from the set of David Dhawans Partner in Film City. The questioning lasted about 50 minutes. Salman is due to leave for South Africa tonight and return on December 24.

 The police, who wanted to record his statement in the case involving the funding of the film Chori Chori Chupke Chupke, had earlier summoned the actor to appear before them. The case was reopened after Anjum Phajlani, a Dawood Ibrahim gang member, was deported from the UAE last month. Phajlani is a key associate of Dawood man Chhota Shakeel.

 We want to question Salman and corroborate whether the actor received any threats from Phajlani and Shakeel to act in Chori Chori. This will help us strengthen the case against Phajlani, a senior crime branch official said earlier.

 But Salman denied ever knowing Phajlani, sources said. 

 Phajlani was booked under the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) for his complicity in the 2001 case. He is wanted for issuing threats to Salman to force him to reduce his fees for the film, produced by Nazeem Rizvi and funded by Bharat Shah, allegedly on instructions from Shakeel. 

 The police believe that Phajlani had threatened Salman and forced him to reduce his fees from the Rs 4 crore he commanded at the time to Rs 1.5 crore. A SIM card the gangster used to make the calls, and later gave to Rizvi, has been seized. Rizvi had used the SIM card to call Shakeel the conversations, tapped by the police, were used in the probe. 

 In his confession, 48-year-old Phajlani has denied threatening Salman, saying he spoke to the actor calmly and explained why he should act in Chori Chori. He has also denied any association with Shakeel or knowledge of anyone threatening Salman to do the film.

 Police sources said the crime branch might question some more people from Bollywood in the next few days.

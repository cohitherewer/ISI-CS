 Leftists coup at B-school

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Yechury: Pleasant surprise

 Ahmedabad, Dec. 9: Lalu Prasad had merely lectured Indias top B-school on turnarounds; Sitaram Yechury today almost gave a demonstration.

 The unlikely guest speaker impressed his audience so much at the Indian Institute of Management here that over half-a-dozen students at the bastion of market liberalism told him they would love to do their summer internship with him.

 It left the professor who had invited the CPM politburo member open-mouthed. The students even submitted their resume to him. I was amazed, Anil Gupta said.

 If Lalu Prasad had charmed the students with his rustic wit three months ago as he explained his success with the railways, Yechury won points for being articulate and meticulous.

 He was very well informed and could answer all the questions, said Anand, a student. Hetal Trivedi found him very convincing.

 Many students, unused to Leftists, had come expecting to meet a dinosaur with a pre-globalisation worldview.

 But Yechury had moments ago told reporters: Yes, we know most of the students here are not going to agree with our views. But we are familiar with this situation and very comfortable with people who do not agree with us.

 Speaking on the official topic, Vision of future India: role of youth, the CPM leader urged the students: You might be cynical about party politics but if you do not participate you cannot bring about change. Politics is not just about election and political parties; it is an instrument of change.

 The guest was pelted with questions about his partys perceived hostility to reforms, at least outside Bengal. He explained the CPM wasnt against foreign money that added to Indias technology prowess. The investment coming to Bengal is bringing in new technology, he said.

 On telecom, he said: For security reasons we want that ownership of the service provider should not go to foreign companies. But if Noika wants to set up a manufacturing plant, we will welcome it and allow 100 per cent foreign investment.

 Some students remained unconvinced as before, but even they came to know about the other side, Gupta said.

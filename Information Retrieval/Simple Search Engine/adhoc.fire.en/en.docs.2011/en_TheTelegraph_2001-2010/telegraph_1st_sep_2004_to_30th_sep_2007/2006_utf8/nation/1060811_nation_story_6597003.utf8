 organisations, Naxalites abducted two government employees 

 from a village in Gajapati district on Wednesday evening, 

 our bureau reports.

 The two are Binod Kumar Kisan, a junior engineer in Mohana block, and Prasad Patnaik, a peon with the irrigation department. 

 A combing operation has been launched in a 15-km radius in Mohana with the help of two platoons of armed forces. Besides, two platoons of the special operation group (SOG) have spotted where the Maoists have reportedly kept the hostages, sources said.

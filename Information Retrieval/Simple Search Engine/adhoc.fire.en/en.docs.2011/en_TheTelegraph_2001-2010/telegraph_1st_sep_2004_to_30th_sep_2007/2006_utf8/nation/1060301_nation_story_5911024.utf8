The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Creative blast at Bush

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 28: He is the most powerful man on earth, the sole superstar in the world of politics. But an artists muse?

 Or, for that matter, a poets genius? Come on.

 But then, that was before George W. Bush planned a trip to India.

 Call it contempt for his foreign policy, or the charm of his personality, the US President has inspired a burst of creativity even before he has landed in Delhi for his first visit to the country.

 He has also done something else: brought such disparate elements as students and politicians, mullahs and Leftists, singers and teachers on the same platform of protest.

 But first the creative cascade.

 In Delhi University and JNU, T-shirts with colourful slogans are the latest rage. Ab tera kya hoga re Dubya, reads one, recalling the famous line from the seventies blockbuster Sholay.

 Bomb Texas, screams another, they have oil too.

 Then there are the regulars ? Bush haivan kiska mehman (we cant have the Devil for a guest) ? or, as a car sticker suggests, Uproot the Bush.

 Among the fellow travellers on this protest parade are the Jamait-e-Ulema-e-Hind, a congregation of ulemas, Booker Prize winner Arundhati Roy and MP-cum-TV channel proprietor J.K. Jain.

 Besides a common protest march organised by the Left and Samajwadi Party, the other big march is being organised by Arundhati et al. 

 Sudhanva Deshpande, of the Jan Natya Manch (JNM), has already held over 40-odd performances across campuses in the city. One of them, Nahin Kabul, is a spoof on Bush coming to India and meeting Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who shows him around.

 A play by Delhi University students starts with a dialogue between Bush and the chorus ? Bushji, han ji, war karenge, han ji?. The dialogue is interspersed with bits of power poetry from Palestine.

 Extracts from blogs and letters written by soldiers in Iraq are routinely read out at these performances.

 Several writers have made their contributions ? Gita Hariharan, Tariq Ali and Amitava Kumar, to name a few.

 Kumar describes a fictional conversation between Lalu Prasad and Bush while Ali writes a hilarious account of what is likely to happen when Bush lands here.

 The JNM has collected thousands of angry letters to Bush from almost everywhere ? working-class neighbourhoods to universities and middle-class homes. We are in the process of posting these letters to the US embassy. There are thousands of them, Sudhanva told The Telegraph.

 While the creativity flowed, activists at Sahmat (Safdar Hashmi Memorial Trust), which is at the forefront of organising the protests, were paid a surprise visit by officials of the US Congress library. They wanted to buy the protest material ? the anti-Bush posters, banners and T-shirts. Apparently, the material was required for archival purposes.

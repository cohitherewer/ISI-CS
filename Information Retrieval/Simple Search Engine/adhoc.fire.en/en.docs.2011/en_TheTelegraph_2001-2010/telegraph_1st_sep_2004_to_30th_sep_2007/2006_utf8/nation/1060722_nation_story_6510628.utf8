 Elusive witness irks SC

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 21: The Supreme Court today took serious note of the charge that the woman allegedly at the heart of the celebrated Nitish Katara murder case was being kept away from the trial by her powerful family.

 Bharti Yadav, daughter of former member of Parliament D.P. Yadav, is the sister of prime accused Vikas Yadav and a cousin of co-accused Vishal Yadav. Nitish was killed allegedly because he had become too friendly with her.

 Told that her family didnt know where Bharti was, the apex court said: What is the difficulty.? It is very strange that the father does not know where the daughter is.

 If we are convinced that the judicial system was being taken for a ride, we will take note of it. We cant shut our eyes to this, the bench said.

 The court was hearing appeals by police and Nitishs mother against the Delhi High Courts grant of bail to Vishal. The police alleged that Bhartis father and brothers were not allowing her to depose.

 The prosecution said it was trying to get Bharti declared a proclaimed offender and had sought Interpols help to trace her.

 Even the prosecution had initially sought to keep Bharti away from the witness stand, prompting suspicion that her family was influencing the trial. The prosecution had said that Britain, where she was studying, had refused to carry out the warrant against her and that she was unlikely to depose against her brother.

 It took an appeal to the high court by Nitishs mother to stop the move to drop Bharti from the witness list.

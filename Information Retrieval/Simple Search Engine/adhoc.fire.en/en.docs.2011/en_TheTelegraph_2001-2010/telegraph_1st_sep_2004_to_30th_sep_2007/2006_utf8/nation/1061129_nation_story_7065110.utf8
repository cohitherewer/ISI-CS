 Job spin to Buddha shuffle

 Mohanta after he won the last Assembly polls

 Calcutta, Nov. 28: Mohanta Chatterjees removal as state environment minister is not a reflection on his performance, CPM sources claimed today.

 They said the chief minister wanted Chatterjee to focus on his other two portfolios food processing and horticulture that have the potential to create jobs.

 The decision was taken at the last CPM state secretariat meeting and conveyed to the minister by Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and state party secretary Biman Bose, the sources said.

 It should not be seen as a punishment one decided after the partys half-yearly review of the governments functioning on Sunday. The state party secretary will later make this clear, a CPM leader said.

 The environment department needed a full-time minister, and parliamentary affairs minister Sailen Sarkar has been given the job since his original assignment was not too demanding.

 Sarkar, a party veteran from Malda, is apparently not too happy with the lightweight department.

 Chatterjees critics in the party, however, hint that he had displeased the CPM leadership by granting environmental clearance to controversial projects during his six-month stint.

 But party sources close to the minister argued he had rather enhanced the state pollution control boards (PCBs) image on key issues.

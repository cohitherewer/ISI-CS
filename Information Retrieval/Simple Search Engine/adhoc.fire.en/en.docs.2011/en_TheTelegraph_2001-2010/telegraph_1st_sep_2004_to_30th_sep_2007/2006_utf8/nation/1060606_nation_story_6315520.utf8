 Relief for spy scribe

 New Delhi, June 5 (PTI): Delhi High Court today ordered the release of a freelance journalist who was charged with leaking classified national secrets to the ISI, saying the court that sentenced her did not have the jurisdiction to try the offence.

 Setting aside the seven-year conviction imposed by the chief metropolitan magistrate, Justice Badar Durrez Ahmed ordered that Rachana Singh alias Ruchi be set free unless she is wanted in any other case.

 Ruchi was arrested by sleuths of the Intelligence Bureau and other investigating agencies in May 2000 on charges of passing classified official secrets to Pakistani agents based in Delhi and Kathmandu for monetary considerations.

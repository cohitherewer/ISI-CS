 Stocks for Orissa oustees

 SUBRAT DAS

Bhubaneswar, April 22: Orissa today announced 

an innovative policy to tackle the thorniest issue in the development debate, 

raising compensation for oustees while seeking to lock half the money as preferential 

stocks in the company that causes displacement.

The rehabilitation package, which includes jobs, land 

and money to build houses, is aimed at dousing the unrest over the Kalinga Nagar 

police firing and the growing opposition to the Posco steel project near Paradip 

port.

The definition of family has been widened 

to include all sons above 18, unmarried daughters/sisters above 30, physically 

or mentally challenged members, orphans and widows as a separate unit. This means 

each gets the full benefits apart from the job that goes to any one of them.

The stocks option has been left open. If the oustees 

wish, they can accept half the compensation in cash while the rest is locked as 

scrips, which can be liquidated after five years.

The state had been working overtime to draw up a rehabilitation 

policy after police bullets killed 13 tribals protesting against construction 

by a steel giant on acquired land in Kalinga Nagar on January 2.

The compensation for the Kalinga Nagar oustees has 

been hiked to Rs 1 lakh an acre from Rs 76,000. Agitating Jagatsinghpur farmers 

who are going to lose their betel vines to the Posco project will get Rs 6,000 

per tenth of an acre.

Other highlights include:

Job for one person from each undivided displaced 

family

One-acre land to build house together with Rs 1.5 lakh (up from Rs 50,000) 

for mining/industry oustees 

Aid of up to Rs 5 lakh for self-employment

Land for irrigation project oustees or, as an 

alternative, cash (Rs 1 lakh per acre for irrigated land and Rs 50,000 per acre 

for non-irrigated land)

The government has also minimised its role. An industrialist 

can negotiate with the prospective oustees directly. If he wants the government 

to acquire the land, it would step into the picture, delaying the process a little.

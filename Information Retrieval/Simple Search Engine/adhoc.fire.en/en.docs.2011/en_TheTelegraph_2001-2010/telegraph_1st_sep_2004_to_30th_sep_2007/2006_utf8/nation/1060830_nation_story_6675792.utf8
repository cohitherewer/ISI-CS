 Mumbai, Aug. 29: No surprises at Rahul Mahajans wedding those who were expected to show their faces did and those who werent didnt.

 Sarangi, wife of Pramod Mahajans killer-brother Praveen, and her children were missing from the scene when Rahul hitched up with long-time girlfriend Shweta Singh at the Blue Sea Banquets in Worli shortly before noon. 

 But then, few expected theyd be there.

 On the expected list and living up to the promise were all varieties of friends of the late BJP leader personal, political and corporate. And numerous bigwigs from his party, the BJP, save the aging Atal Bihari Vajpayee and the ailing Rajnath Singh.

 The dash of corporate glamour in the low-key traditional proceedings came from the younger Ambani, Anil. Bajaj Auto chairman Rahul Bajaj and Zee chairman Subhash Goel were also there.

 A slew of senior BJP leaders dutifully showed up to bless the couple, both looking happy and relaxed in spite of their wedding finery. L.K. Advani was there, so were M. Venkaiah Naidu, Kalraj Mishra, Ananth Kumar and Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi. TV actress Smriti Z. Iraani did not stay away either.

 There were politicians from other parties, too: NCP chief Sharad Pawar, Maharashtra chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh, Union aviation minister Praful Patel and former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Farooq Abdullah.

 The Shiv Sena brigade also landed up Uddhav Thackeray and Manohar Joshi were there, and also Uddhavs estranged cousin Raj.

 Rahuls mother Rekha, sister Poonam and uncle Gopinath Munde welcomed the guests at the ceremony that was out of bounds to the media. Somewhat removed from the limelight but very much present were Mahajan matriarch Prabhavati, older son Prakash and daughter Pradnya.

 Rahul and Shweta, who first met during a flying course in the US in 1995, will be leaving for Seychelles tomorrow for their honeymoon. After the ceremony, they posed for a photo-op video footage of the wedding was circulated to news channels but neither would say a word.

 The wedding comes three months after Pramod Mahajan was shot from close range by Praveen at the BJP leaders Worli residence. He died after a 12-day battle on May 3.

 A month on, Rahul was arrested on charges of drug abuse at the former telecom ministers official residence in New Delhi. A few days after he got bail, he got engaged to Shweta.

 A sessions court is scheduled to begin hearings in the Pramod Mahajan murder case from September 1.

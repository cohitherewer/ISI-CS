Pinpogaon (Baithalangso), May 14: A true king 

is never defeated, only subdued. 

 But Kangbura Hanse, the Chinthong Lindok (monarch) of the Karbi tribe of Assam, has thrown in the towel.

 I am helpless. My subjects are dying of hunger and I am watching helplessly, says Hanse, the descendant of a family of royals that once ruled western Karbi Anglong.

 Today, Pinpogaon, the capital of the Karbi kingdom, wallows in poverty and neglect. The air of despondency reflects the predicament of a once proud king who is now one with his subjects in the grim fight for survival. 

 Pinpogaon, under Baithalangso constituency, is a classic example of a place caught in a time warp. There are no roads, no public health centres and no schools. Hanse narrates Pinpogaons woes to any person of consequence who visits the area, but it is obvious that his words do not count. Not anymore.

 What remains unchanged, though, is the respect with which the residents treat him. We are forgotten by politicians once elections are over. They come to seek votes and that is where democracy ends for us. It is the king and his concern for our welfare that keeps us going against all odds, says Kumor Phagso, a youth from the village.

 Although Hanse has held on to the last vestige of his royal past, a white turban and a black coat, he readily admits that his position is now little more than that of a village head. How can I remain a king when I cant do anything for my people? he asks.

 The 65-odd residents of Pinpogaon make a living doing jhum (shifting) cultivation, but that is not enough to keep the home fires burning throughout the year. 

 We work hard to clear forest land for jhum, but we have to survive on forest produce like roots and tubers for the better half of the year. We have been degraded to a state of beggary, which is disgraceful in our culture, Hanse laments.

 Diseases like malaria and jaundice mean sure death for the villagers. A patient has to walk several kilometres through inhospitable terrain to reach the nearest public health centre. To reach villages like Opilangso and Mayagaon, one has to walk between eight and 10 hours. Roofless huts and semi-naked children crying in hunger complete the dismal picture.

 Wangpung, Larsing, Musalding, Psier and Umcheret ? the other villages that used to be ruled by Hanses family ? are no better.

 Insurgency and corrupt governance have crippled the entire district and the people are still ignorant about their rights. Its a hopeless situation for them, says Baithalangso-based retired teacher and writer Tanka Konwar.

 Fighting a losing battle against poverty at home and beyond, Hanse would agree.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Cricket barbs begin to roll towards Buddha

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Bhattacharjee

 Calcutta, July 30: Prasun Mukherjee might have lost the cricket election but the political googlies that began to fly soon after were all aimed at a player not on the crease: chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. 

 Sports minister Subhas Chakraborty, who had tried in vain to broker peace with Jagmohan Dalmiya, spoke out against the governments intervention in the Cricket Association of Bengal elections immediately after the results were announced.

 Several Left Front allies, too, trained their guns on the chief minister, describing Dalmiyas victory as an embarrassment to Bhattacharjee.

 As a sports lover, the outcome of the CAB elections was not at all unexpected to me. The way the administration was used to garner support for city police commissioner Mukherjee was unprecedented and unacceptable, Chakraborty said. 

 Without naming the chief minister and state urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya, who was at the forefront of the oust-Dalmiya campaign, the sports minister said: The role taken by some political persons, particularly those in the administration, to rally support for Mukherjee by touring the districts to goad sports associations was shocking. 

 The shadow-boxing within the CPM in the run-up to the elections had become so acute that it forced state party secretary Biman Bose to issue a gag order.

 Sources said that though the result was made public close to 11 pm, former chief minister Jyoti Basu, who had initially expressed displeasure at the police chief entering the fray, was informed of the outcome. 

 Refusing to comment on the impact of the outcome on the chief ministers image, Chakraborty said: A non-issue was turned into an issue. However, both sides now should accept the result in a sportsmans spirit. I had kept a bouquet of red roses ready for both Mukherjee and Dalmiya but it would be sent to the latter. Let all of us take lessons from the incident and think twice about politicising sports. 

 PWD minister and RSP leader Kshiti Goswami, who had publicly opposed the intervention in the CAB elections, said it is a victory for independent-minded people.

 The results prove that a majority of the voters did not cower before pressure from the administration and political leaders. I had told the chief minister earlier that the people do not like meddling with the functioning and elections of an autonomous body like CAB. The results made it clear that this is a victory for independent-minded people, Goswami said.

 Asked whether Dalmiyas victory would be seen as a loss of face for the chief minister, Goswami said: It is the chief minister who should ponder over the matter. As a cricket lover, he had a right to support one of the contenders. But it was not necessary at all to press the administration for rallying support for the police chief.

 Some front leaders preferring anonymity said the chief ministers differences with Dalmiya over the Bantala leather complex had snowballed into politics of revenge. 

 However, urban development minister Bhattacharya defended the chief minister. Whatever the chief minister had said was in the greater interest of Bengal cricket. He wanted to ensure inclusion of Bengals cricketers in the national team. His intervention had nothing to do with politics, he said.

 Trying to be non-committal on the outcome of the election, Bhattacharya said: I have already said in public that Dalmiya should have stepped aside after the chief minister asked him to do so. I should keep mum as our party secretary has instructed us not to speak about the CAB polls.

 Imrana: Triumph of truth

 Lucknow, Oct. 21: The verdict convicting her father-in-law of rape out of the way, Imrana is fighting another battle to be reunited with her husband in the face of edicts from clerics that her marriage is over.

 Yeh sacchai ki jeet hai (It is triumph of truth), she had blurted out from below her burqa moments after the district and sessions judge in Muzaffarnagar pronounced Ali Mohammad guilty on Thursday. 

 The sense of euphoria soon gave way to despair as the familiar statements from clerics for separation from her husband, Noor Illahi, began to cast a shadow on Imranas courage of conviction.

 It was almost surreal on the afternoon of October 19 at 4.30 pm, when victory greeted her. She was euphoric. However, as soon as clerics began insisting again that her relation with her husband did not exist, she wore the official smile but soon drowned in loneliness and isolation, said Rehana Adib of Astitva, the Saharanpur-based womens organisation that has been helping and counselling Imrana on life after the verdict.

 Kukra, 25 km from Muzaffarnagar, is swarming with social activists. It is here that Imrana has been staying at her parents home since the June 23 Dar-ul Uloom fatwa that asked her to live separately from her husband.

 On October 20, the day after the ruling, Imrana appeared to be fighting away some of the depression when she said she would not buckle under the pressure of maulvis and would like to stay with her husband. But even in that brief moment of hope, she wasnt too sure.

 Hame pata nahi mere shauhar ki kya soch hai (I dont know what my husband thinks about it), she said. The fear, however, came through in what she uttered next. If he wants to go, it is a different matter.

 Social activists helping Imrana, too, are not sure where Illahi would stand. They have reason to be wary. Just after the verdict, he said he was upset at the outcome. He is in his mid-sixties. I dont know how he will withstand jail at this stage of his life, he said, referring to his father.

 Last afternoon, he met Imrana, telling her that he did not want to leave her. What will happen to my children if I turn my back on my wife? he asked. Hours later, he visited his father to find out how he was doing in jail. 

 In August, Illahi had filed two affidavits over the rape charge against his father. In one, he backed Imranas allegations. In another, he claimed Mohammad was innocent. 

 One consolation for Imrana has been that her husband has kept in touch with her and has been looking after their children.

 The short, hard-faced, hungry-looking Illahi, confused as ever, has kept Imrana on tenterhooks. He is gullible, too. He may be swayed by the clerics lobby, said an NGO activist who is helping Imrana rebuild her life.

 It is these women activists and some vocal Muslim intellectuals who are helping her withstand the pressure from maulvis and imams.

 What personal decision Imrana takes in her life is more important than all the smoke and haze of maulvis opinions on Shariat laws, says Nurjehan Shafia Naz, executive director of Women Action Research Group in Mumbai.

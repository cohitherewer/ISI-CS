The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Regional parties blip on radar 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 13: The Telugu Desam Party and the Samajwadi Party are trying to emerge as the centre of gravity to attract regional parties unattached to any of the two grand alliances ? the NDA and UPA ? and the Left. 

 According to a senior Desam leader, party chief N. Chandrababu Naidus recent support to the Samajwadi Partys bid to bring a no-confidence motion against the Congress-led government was not an isolated move. It was part of an effort to begin hand-in-hand co-ordination, first in the House, then outside.

 Sources in the two parties claimed that they were also in contact with the Asom Gana Parishad, the INLD and the National Conference in order to arrive at an understanding on floor co-ordination in the coming budget session.

 Desam leader Yerran Naidu, however, downplayed the talk of a third front, saying it was too early for such speculation. He added, though, that the initiative certainly carried the possibility of maturing into a larger alliance. Sources said the two parties were also trying to contact ADMK chief Jayalalithaa.

 The Desam has also started to make its distance from the NDA more visible. The sources said it was with this aim that the Desam decided to keep away from yesterdays dinner organised by Speaker Somnath Chatterjee for the NDA.

 What has propelled the parties to try forming this ginger group was partly to lift themselves from the political fringes they had been confined to, the sources said. 

 Also, the two parties want to position themselves in a way so that they can deal with the Left on an equal footing if a third front looks possible in future.

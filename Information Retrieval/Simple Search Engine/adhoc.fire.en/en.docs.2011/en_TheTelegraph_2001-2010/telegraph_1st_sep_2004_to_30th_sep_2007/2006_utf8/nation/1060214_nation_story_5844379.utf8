 Plan for visa on arrival

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 13: The government is considering a proposal to give visa on arrival to people from 16 countries to boost tourism.

 These countries include Australia, New Zealand and France. The proposal is now awaiting clearance from the home ministry since there are security concerns, tourism minister Ambika Soni said. It could be either a long-term visa or an electronic visa.

 Soni said the tourism ministry is in talks with state governments to identify land for developing budget hotels.

 There is a proposal that all state governments must identify land sites and give them on long-term lease or auction them to hoteliers. Each state can decide on working out its own arrangement with the industry, she said.

 The railway ministry, which has committed 100 sites, will be asked to speed up the development process. 

 Soni said she has urged the finance ministry to grant infrastructure status to tourism. He has assured me that he will look into the issue. If it is done, our ministry will be the biggest employment generator, she added.

 Judgment day arrives for Monica

 Hyderabad, Sept. 28: The smile has returned to Monica Bedis face. 

 The judge of the CBI designated court, P.V. Narayana, will tomorrow deliver the verdict on charges of forgery, cheating and passport act violations slapped on Abu Salems girlfriend. The trial was completed yesterday. 

 Pradeep Kumar, Monicas advocate, says the CBI has more or less dropped the charges under the passport act. She may be tried, and found guilty, under Section 420 of the IPC, which relates to cheating and conspiracy and sets a prison term of six months. Monica has already spent 10 months in jail.

 Her attempts to win a bail proved unsuccessful, both in Andhra Pradesh High Court and the Supreme Court. However, she has reason to thank the apex court, which ordered this July that her trial be completed by October 18. 

 The all-women prison at Chanchalguda in the heart of the city has been home to Monica since November 11 last year, when she was brought to the Andhra capital for hearings in the fake passport case. 

 A similar case is pending against her in Bhopal.

 Monica denies she was married to Abu Salem, the gangster who was brought back from Portugal by the CBI last year. He is wanted in the 1993 Bombay blasts and other extortion and murder cases. The former actress was brought to the country with him but has since refused an advocate hired by Salem to fight her case.

 The CBI court in Hyderabad had also sought Salems appearance in the fake passport cases, but the Mumbai Tada court turned down its three warrants saying the gangster could not be released for travel on a transit warrant. 

 Monica, who also spent a year in a Portugal jail, celebrated her 36th birthday in July. Her uncle came down from the familys home in a Punjab village to appoint an advocate for her, as did her father, who met her a little over two months ago.

 Sources at the Chanchalguda jail say the reticence and silence have given way to warmth, and the one-time actress has reportedly been giving away some of her finest dresses to the needy and sharing food with them.

 She has been teaching women staff in the jail how to keep themselves pleasant, offering tips on make-ups and facials, says a jail employee. Monica even arranged a special lunch for the staff and inmates during the Ganesh festival. Many of us have offered prayers at the Ganesh temple and to Durga Mata for her well-being, said an employee.

 The best might not be over, though. A grand feast for the 150 inmates is lined up in her last days at the jail, as is a special screening of one of her films, says a senior official. Permission is yet to arrive.

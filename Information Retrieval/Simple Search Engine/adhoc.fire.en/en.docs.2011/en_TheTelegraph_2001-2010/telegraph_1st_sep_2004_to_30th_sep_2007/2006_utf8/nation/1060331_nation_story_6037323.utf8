 Airport strike threat

 New Delhi, March 30: The Airports Authority of India has warned the government that it would not hesitate to go on strike again if it went ahead with privatising Delhi and Mumbai airports without referring to a plan forwarded by the AAI, reports our special correspondent.

 However, the threat is being seen as a mere posturing by the AAI to get more concessions from the government and keep its flock happy with a militant stance. 

 The withdrawal of an earlier strike by airport employees had not gone down well with workers.

 The strike threat came a day after the third meeting of the committee, comprising government representatives, airport employees and AAI members, ended without any progress.

 The Centre yesterday refused to study the AAI development plans and indicated that airport privatisation was beyond the purview of talks held by the tripartite panel.

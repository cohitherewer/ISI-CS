 15 killed as families feud

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Lucknow, Nov. 17: 

 An old battle between two families over a plot of land left 

 15 people dead overnight in an Uttar Pradesh village, four 

 of them children.

 The massacre in a village 190 km from Lucknow described by police as the worst in the state in recent times brought director-general of police Bua Singh to the spot.

 But he did not promise to bring the murderers to book. When people have killed each other, where is the scope for action? he asked.

 Late last night, Srinivas Mishra alias Saghan woke up to find that his mother Dhandei, wife Kamli and three children Angrez (10), Chhotu (5), and Ruchi (3) had been killed in their sleep. Their throats were slit, the police said. 

 Mishras family had long been fighting with another Brahmin family in the village, headed by Pramod Vajpayee alias Lalai, over a 5-cottah plot that fell between their two houses. In 1998, two members of his family were killed and four members of the Vajpayee family booked for their murder. The four were freed on bail this week.

 The old wound was dug open yesterday when those four members of one of the feuding families returned from jail, said Subhas Chandra, DIG Lucknow range. These four persons allegedly masterminded the attack.

 Gathering men and arms, Mishra descended on the Vajpayee house around 1.30 am. The goons chased the members of the Vajpayee family, hunted them down and shot them. The counter-attack resulted in the killing of Vajpayees mother, daughter-in-law and five relatives, said IG Lucknow, A.K. Gupta. Eight-year-old Luvkush was among the dead.

 The battle using guns, axes and sticks continued for over six hours before police arrived at the spot at 7 am from a police station 7 km away. By then, three more villagers had lost their lives.

 A large police contingent headed by DIG Subhas Chandra has been camping in Shankarpur Jhisni village of Sitapur district since this morning. Two men Kriparam Dubey and Guddar Vajpayee have been arrested. However, the four who are out on bail and are suspected to have planned the attack have gone missing.

 As the Opposition BJP and Congress asked how the villagers had managed to arm themselves to the teeth and why it took the police so long to respond, chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav brushed aside the talk of breakdown of law and order. At a rally in Allahabad today, he said: It (law and order) was far worse when I took over and I have managed to bring it back on track.

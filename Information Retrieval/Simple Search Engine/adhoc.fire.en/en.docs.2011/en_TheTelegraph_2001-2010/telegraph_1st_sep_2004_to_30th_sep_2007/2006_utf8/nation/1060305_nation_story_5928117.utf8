 Imran goes from dinner to detention

 London, March 4: Former Pakistan cricket captain Imran Khan has been put under house arrest by police clamping down on protests against George W. Bushs visit to the country.

 Imran (in picture), the leader of the Tehrik-e-Insaf, is a vociferous critic of US foreign policy. Dozens of supporters from his party were also arrested ahead of a planned rally.

 When the sparsely-attended protest march from Rawalpindi to Islamabad did take place, the police beat up and arrested at least 16 people who were chanting slogans against Bush and Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf.

 Imran was leaving a friends home after dinner around 1 am when he was served with a detention order and then driven to his home in a police convoy, according to a spokesman from his party.

 The house arrest came as the Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal (MMA) and Opposition parties observed a black day to protest against the US Presidents visit.

 While the moderate Opposition parties like Pakistan Peoples Party declined to join the MMAs protests, they agreed to boycott the dinner being hosted by Musharraf tonight for Bush.

 Imran, who earlier used to be a supporter of Musharraf, has aligned closely with the MMA in carrying out demonstrations against the Pakistan President and the US.

 Bushs visit has been surrounded by extraordinary security. Ahead of his arrival, there were several noisy anti-US protests across Pakistan, but there was little sign of unrest today.

 After his detention, Imran told Pakistani television that he had been put under house arrest just to appease Bush.

 He criticised Musharraf for not allowing him and his supporters to hold a rally, while tens of thousands had organised demonstrations in India. What else can you expect from a dictator? Imran asked.

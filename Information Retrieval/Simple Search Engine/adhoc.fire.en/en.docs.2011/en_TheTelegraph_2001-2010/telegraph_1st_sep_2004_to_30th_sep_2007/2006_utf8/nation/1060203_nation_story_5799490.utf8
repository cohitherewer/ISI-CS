 Trolley help amp; clean toilets

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Feb. 2: The situation in Mumbai airport improved today with all flights running smoothly despite the dharna outside the airport.

 All flights in and out of Mumbai operated normally. We did have a bit of a problem with sanitation facilities, but we did the cleaning up inside the airport, said R.J. Treasurywala, the director of Mumbai airport.

 Outside, though, the garbage pile-up remained.

 Airport authorities hired a private contractor to handle the movement of baggage trolleys to ensure passengers did not face any inconvenience.

 More Left unions like the Railway Mazdoor Sangh rallied behind the striking Airports Authority of India employees as they joined the indefinite sit-in outside the airport.

 Indian Airlines ground staff, too, expressed solidarity with the protesters, though they stayed away from the strike.

 A rumour about the death of one of the five hospitalised employees injured in yesterdays lathicharge sparked tension this afternoon, but police clarified that it was untrue and defused the crisis.

 Three Indian Airlines (now known as Indian) flights were rescheduled today. Our 5.30 pm flight to Calcutta had to be rescheduled to 6.30 pm, but it was due to operational delays and not the strike, spokesperson K. Swaminathan said.

 Malini Nair, a spokesperson for Kingfisher Airlines, said out of the eight daily flights to Calcutta, the 9 am flight from Hyderabad was the only one to be rescheduled.

 Our passengers had no problem at all with baggage since it was taken care of by our valets. We also sent out SMS updates to passengers whose flights were delayed by a few minutes, Nair said.

 Dacoit puts price on cops

 - Most wanted turns pursuer with Rs 50-lakh reward

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Bhopal, May 10: Going by the price tag, Chambals most wanted are no longer its bandit chiefs but the police officers pursuing them.

 Rambabu Gadaria, the Veerappan of Chambal with Rs 5 lakh on his head, has turned the bloody theatre of the ravines topsy-turvy by announcing a retaliatory reward of Rs 50 lakh on three senior policemen. He wants them dead or alive.

 In a show of cheek, the dacoit left it to the Madhya Pradesh police to publicise his offer. He freed six kidnapped businessmen who handed the police a letter from him, written in Hindi and announcing the awards on inspector-general of police Sanjay Rana, Shivpuri superintendent R.S. Meena and station house officer Ashok Bhaduria.

 Gadaria has been accused of more than 100 crimes ? murders, robberies, kidnappings and extortion ? and is wanted also in the neighbouring states of Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan.

 The man specialises in kidnappings ? pakad in the Chambal lexicon. According to police records, he has taken more than 300 people hostage in the past eight years.

 The freed businessmen claimed Gadaria had handed them Rs 500 each. He gave us food and water, said one of them, Anil Sharma.

 Chambal deputy inspector-general Arun Pratap Singh, however, said the businessmen might be suffering from the Stockholm Syndrome, a psychological condition in which a hostage is apparently converted to the kidnappers viewpoint.

 The freed hostages said the dacoit changed his hideout every three or four days. The state police have put a team of 600 on the trail of the Gadaria gang, whom they have nicknamed T-1 (target number one).

 The police are desperate to get Gadaria because of his daring operations and knack for publicity. He massacred 16 Gujjars in October 2004, and last year threatened to rob the Bangalore Rajdhani Express.

 In Shivpuri, he had left a letter near 16 blood-spattered corpses, saying: We will kill 25 more people before Diwali. 

 The threat was never carried out but it triggered an exodus of Gujjars from all Chambal villages on Gadaria territory.

 Last year, the bandit wrote to the Shivpuri superintendent demanding Rs 25 lakh. Else, be prepared for abductions and killing of government servants, he said.

 Chambal is witnessing a shift from robbery to abductions, the police say. People no longer keep their valuables and cash at home, and so robberies do not yield much. 

 Abductions for ransom are more rewarding and safer, too.

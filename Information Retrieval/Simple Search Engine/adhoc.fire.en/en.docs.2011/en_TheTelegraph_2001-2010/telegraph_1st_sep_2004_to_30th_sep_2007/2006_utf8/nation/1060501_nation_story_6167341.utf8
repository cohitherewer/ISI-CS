 The dilemma before Delhi

 SUJAN DUTTA

 New Delhi, April 30: The kidnapping and killing of K. Suryanarayana goes right into the heart of Delhis Afghan dilemma: how to remain committed in Afghanistans badlands and yet guarantee security for Indian professionals amid its wilderness and wars.

 Suryanarayana was till this morning one of some 600 Indians working in Afghanistan. Apart from the Indian-government-sponsored efforts, there are also foreign firms who tap into Indias large reserves of cheap and skilled manpower to rake in dollars from post-conflict reconstruction.

 Suryanarayana was abducted from Zabul province that elected a portly ex-Taliban commander by the name of Mulla Abdul Salaam Rocketi to the Afghan Parliament in September last year. 

 In the language of the Americans and of Afghan President Hamid Karzai, he would be categorised under Good Taliban, that motley group from the former fundamentalist regime who are now on board the USs Afghan project.

 Two years ago in December 2003, Rocketi was instrumental in negotiating the release of two Indian hostages, Murali and Varadayya, engaged in road building between Kandahar and Spin Boldak on Pakistans Baluch border.

 Rocketi has some experience in the business of converting ordinary people into hostages. Years ago, when he was with the Taliban, he had kidnapped seven Pakistanis and two Chinese, in response to an attack on him by Pakistani forces. To his credit, Rocketi released them unharmed.

 With such credentials to back him up, the Indian embassy in Kabul tapped into its resources to use Rocketis offices once again. But this time it has not worked. It did not work in November either when Maniappan Raman Kutty was killed after being kidnapped by the Taliban. The question is : Is Rocketi losing his touch?

 The answer probably is that India is regaining its touch in Afghanistan, in terrain that runs parallel to the Durand Line, the border with Pakistan. 

 Like Rocketi of Zabul, another former Taliban leader ? its former foreign minister, Wakil Ahmed Muttawakil, contested the polls in Kandahar where Suryanarayana was killed, but lost. But he is still an influential figure. 

 The sands that blow across the Durand Line and the forbidding mountains in the region are now etching a different story in the Afghan desert. Pakistan continues to deny India access to Afghanistan through its territory. And India is seeking to bypass Pakistan in reaching out to Kabul. 

 Apart from the diplomats who staff Indias missions in Kabul, Kandahar and Jalalabad, the people who come in most handy for such endeavours are infrastructure professionals who can build roads and string telephone lines, people like Maniappan and Suryanarayana.

 Since November 2005 when Maniappan was killed, India has increased its detachment of security personnel in Afghanistan. There are 300 personnel of the Indo-Tibetan Border Police for the Border Roads Organisation site and staff on the Zaranj-Delaram road that will connect the Iranian port of Chabahar with Afghanistans Garland Highway. 

 In other words, Indian security personnel are not far from the Pakistan border. 

 Since November also, Pakistans Waziristan in its Federally Administered Tribal Areas and Baluchistan have been restive. Islamabad is alleging that India is using its consulates and the presence of Indian professionals to rig up an intelligence network that is aiding the Baluch ethnic movement, which has seen a revival. 

 In consonance with these worries, the Talibans demands on Delhi are also changing. In December 2003, the demands were localised ? such as to secure the release of comrades. Since November with Maniappans killing the message is clear ? they want Indians out of there. A note pinned to his body was explicit.

 Like Maniappan, Suryanarayana appears to have been victimised in the great game along the Durand Line.

 Foreign secretary Shyam Saran today made it clear that India would not back out from Afghanistan. 

 But the risks in denting Pakistans strategic space are high, probably too high for Indian companies and Indians working for foreign firms. Unlike the Americans and Canadians and the Germans, India does not have the security infrastructure to back its Afghan adventure. 

 Deploying more Indian security personnel will lead to diplomatic rows with both the US and Pakistan. But till such time as India is able to take care of its own in Afghanistan, its professional class will have to pay the price.

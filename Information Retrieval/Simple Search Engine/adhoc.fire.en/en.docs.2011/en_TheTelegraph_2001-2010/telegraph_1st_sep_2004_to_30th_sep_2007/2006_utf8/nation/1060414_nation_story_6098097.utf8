 SC rights order on prison women

 New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Thursday directed the Centre and the states to ensure basic minimum rights to women prisoners and their children in jails, reports our legal correspondent.

 A three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice Y.K. Sabharwal sought amendment of jail manuals to provide extra facilities to women prisoners, particularly those who have children or are pregnant.

 The court said the jail administration should ensure that pregnant undertrials or convicted women do not give birth to their children in jail. The rules should be amended to ensure that they are taken to hospitals with proper facilities.

 The court said children accompanying their mothers or those born in jail should not be treated as prisoners.

 The jail rules should ensure that children of women prisoners are not condemned, the court said, adding that the birth certificates of children born to incarcerated mothers should not mention jail as their place of birth.

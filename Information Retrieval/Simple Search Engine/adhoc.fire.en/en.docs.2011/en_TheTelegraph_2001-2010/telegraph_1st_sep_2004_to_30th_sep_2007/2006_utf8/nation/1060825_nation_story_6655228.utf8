 Jarring note on IIM seat hike

 Ahmedabad, Aug. 24 (PTI): A senior faculty member of IIM Ahmedabad has disagreed with the institutes claim that it cannot increase its student intake now.

 In a paper, IIMs expansion myths, realities and policy choices, Ramesh Gupta has said the claim is not true and it is possible to increase the number of seats substantially with the resources available.

 Solutions for other IIMs should be similar as all share similar programmes, ethos and culture; difference would be only in details, the paper says.

 The IIM-A had said lack of faculty and infrastructure would not allow it to increase student intake from the next academic year following the Centres decision to set aside 27 per cent seats for Other Backward Classes in institutes of higher learning.

 Gupta has, however, mentioned that his paper is not concerned with the OBC reservation policy.

 The IIM-A professor has alleged that increasing domination of alumni on the B-schools board has pushed the institute into the business of education rather than the education of business. The faculty has little control over new programmes and academic alliances, he added.

 The paper states that the IIM-A admits 300 students among them 250 in the postgraduate programme in management in the first year.

 The effective increase in the intake capacity of the IIMs in the postgraduate programme has been only 60-65 students in over 30 years, it says.

 The IIM-A now has about 84 faculty members against 300 students, the paper says.

 Gupta has, however, put in a disclaimer, saying the data about faculty and infrastructure are based on publicly available information. The institutes administration does not make comprehensive data available to the faculty or any other group and estimation error in the data could be 5 to 8 per cent on either side.

 Gupta has claimed that the IIM-A needs to restructure the fellow programme in management (the IIMs PhD programme). Currently, 22 faculty members teach 10 to 15 students of this programme in the second year alone in which only six to eight students graduate every year.

 According to him, intake in the fellow programme in management should either be increased four-fold (to 60 from the current 15) or the institutes should merge all streams and award a fellow in management with specialisation at the thesis stage. Such a practice is common in many universities facing faculty constraints, he has said.

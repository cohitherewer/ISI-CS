The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 President to teacher

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chennai, Sept. 24: President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam has virtually ruled out running for a second term, saying he wants to return to teaching after his tenure ends in July.

 I would be a teacher after my tenure as President, Kalam, who was a professor in Chennais Anna University before he became President, said in Rameshwaram, Tamil Nadu, yesterday.

 The comment triggered speculation about those eyeing the job. There was talk here that S.M. Krishna could be in the race after the Maharashtra governor met M. Karunanidhi at the DMK chiefs residence today.

 Krishna, here mainly to attend a function where the DMK patriarch was felicitated, dropped a hint. Me? No, I am quite comfortable in the Raj Bhavan at Mumbai, he said, asked if he was thinking of a return to active politics.

 Political circles here say Krishnas meeting with the DMK boss is significant as Karunanidhi is a key ally of the Congress-led Centre and has considerable clout with Sonia Gandhi. 

 They say Krishna, a lawyer-turned-politician, has a degree in constitutional law from Harvard University which adds to his credentials.

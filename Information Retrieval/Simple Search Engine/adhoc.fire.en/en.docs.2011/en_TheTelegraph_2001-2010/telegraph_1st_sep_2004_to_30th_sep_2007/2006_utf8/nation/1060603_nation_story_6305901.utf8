 BJP takes another blow

 New Delhi, June 2: For the beleagured BJP, Rahul Mahajans late-night revelry and alleged drug abuse was the second blow in less than a month.

 Rahuls father Pramod Mahajans murder by brother Praveen had sunk the partys morale to an all-time low. 

 Not only did the party lose one of its most promising leaders, it had to deal with sordid details of Pramods personal life being laid out for public viewing by television channels. There were speculations that dirty money and women had a hand in the stunning attack on the leader.

 The BJP had barely recovered from the shock when news trickled in about the horrible outcome of a late-night party at Pramod Mahajans 7, Safdarjung Road house. 

 A fresh scandal loomed large with television channels blaring news of narcotics and alcohol abuse that apparently killed Pramods secretary Bibek Moitra and left Rahul battling for life. 

 Barring BJP president Rajnath Singh, few top-rung leaders visited Rahul in hospital today. Only Harsh Vardhan, Arif Mohammad Khan, Shahnawaz Hussain and Vinay Katiyar called on him. 

 In Mumbai, too, few BJP leaders apart from city unit chief Nitin Gadkari visited Rahuls mother, who was staying with daughter Poonam in Worli.

 Doctors say they are doing their best, Rajnath said. I wish Rahul a speedy recovery.

 Rahuls personal physician was apparently advised to tell the media that he was on anti-depressants, a possible attempt to divert attention from the damning reports.

 This is particularly distressing for Rajnath as he had recently rolled out the red carpet for Rahul at the BJPs national executive meeting. 

 Rahul, too, seemed to be nursing political ambitions and there was talk of him being fielded as the BJP candidate in the byelection in Vidisha.

 Not only has todays incident cast a dark shadow on Rahuls political prospects, it threatens to batter the image of the BJP, which parades its puritanical beliefs with pride.

 Ironically, today Rahul was supposed to play the good son by going to Guwahati and immersing his fathers ashes in the Brahmaputra. Rahul decided to stop by in the capital before heading to Assam. 

 Some party leaders couldnt hide their disappointment. I had advised these people not to indulge Rahul too much. Thankfully, he had not been officially inducted into the party, said a leader who was close to Pramod.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Ravi Shankar

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Oct. 17: Sitar maestro Ravi Shankar is out of danger, sources close to him said.

 He indeed was critically ill but has turned a corner, Ravi Shankars Los Angeles-based disciple Harihar Rao said over phone.

 The authorities at Hospital Encinitas in San Diego, where the musician (in picture) is admitted for two weeks, have decided to equip a room at his home with facilities for medical assistance. That should take a day or two, Rao said.

 It was not clear whether a decision has been taken to discharge him.

 Ravi Shankars wife Sukanya, with whom The Telegraph had spoken yesterday, was beside him 24 hours while daughter Anoushka was in and out, another source said. 

 Sitarist Purbayan Chatterjee, now in New York, said Ravi Shankar was diagnosed with severe pneumonia. When I spoke to him a couple of weeks ago over telephone, he had complained of shoulder pain, but was fit enough to ask me to visit him in San Diego after October 9.

 According to Purbayan, the musician had also discussed plans for a music conference in Delhi under the aegis of his institute this December.

 Earlier, a statement from International Creative Management, the company handling the Ravi Shankar Foundation and his concerts worldwide, said: Ravi Shankar is in a hospital in the US for a viral infection. His condition is now stable but he has to stay in the hospital for a few more weeks.

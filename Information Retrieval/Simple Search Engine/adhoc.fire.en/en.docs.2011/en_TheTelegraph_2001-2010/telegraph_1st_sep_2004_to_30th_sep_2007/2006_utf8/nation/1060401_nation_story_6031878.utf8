The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Ship gift to Maldives

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 31: Defence minister Pranab Mukherjee will formally gift to the Maldives a fast-attack patrol vessel during a visit to the nation slated for April 15. 

 The move is part of efforts to increase military cooperation with nations in the Indian Ocean region, defence ministry sources said today.

 Mukherjee will land in Maldives on April 15 as the election campaign in home state Bengal peaks ? the first phase of polls are on April 17. But it was obviously felt that relations with Maldives at this juncture were more important.

 The unstated reason for the defence ministers two-day trip for the formal gifting ceremony is an effort by the Indian Navy to develop Maldives as a port where its own vessels can berth and be replenished. Defence sources are loath to use the phrase naval base but say that since the navys help to the nation in the aftermath of the tsunami, it has been keen on military cooperation.

 This is the second island nation in the Indian Ocean region to which the Indian Navy is gifting a fast-attack vessel.

 Lethal price for beer caution

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Hyderabad, Aug. 1: Two hotel management students were stabbed to death by a junior because they had ticked him off for drinking.

 Shenoy Cherian and Sanjay Giri, both students of the Institute of Hotel Management, Catering Technology and Applied Nutrition, found Naveen Kumar, 19, and three classmates drinking beer near the institute last night.

 They pulled up the boys for drinking in public and told them to quit the habit. Since the juniors were drunk, the duo took them to the apartment they shared with other boys and grilled them. One of the juniors responded to their queries while another dozed off. But Naveen questioned the authority of the seniors. In a fit of rage, he picked up a knife in the room and stabbed the two very seriously, roommate Mayank K. said.

 As blood spilled, all the boys got scared and ran helter-skelter. Naveen got scared and fled on his motorcycle, said Shankar, circle inspector of Nallakunta police station, who is probing the incident.

 Cherian, from Delhi, and Giri, from Meerut, were rushed to a nursing home nearby where they were declared dead on arrival.

 Police rejected suggestions that the incident might have involved ragging. This appears to be a case of excess drinking, DCP (task force) G. Sudhir Babu said.

 College principal K.A. Madhav said there have been no instances of ragging in his institute. We have very few local boys and hence many of the outsiders live together in hostels and share apartments, he added.

 Naveen is still missing. He has been drinking heavily, said his friend Nitish Kumar, who too was with him last night. Nitish is in custody.

 New Delhi, July 15: The BJP does not want the Indo-Pak peace process derailed completely in spite of its campaign on terror.

 Sources told The Telegraph today that instead of a complete halt, the BJP favours a moratorium on the dialogue with Pakistan in the wake of the Mumbai attacks. 

 For the sake of the peace process, we must suspend the dialogue for a while. The conditions are not favourable for talks. We need time to build confidence again, a source said.

 The BJP launched a two-day drive against terror with Narendra Modi leading from Mumbai. Party chief Rajnath Singh, L.K. Advani, M.M. Joshi and Jaswant Singh addressed rallies in Nagpur, Ahmedabad, Lucknow and Bangalore, respectively.

 However, the political attacks were directed mostly at in-house players ? the UPA, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav, HRD minister Arjun Singh and minority affairs minister A.R. Antulay. Anti-Pakistan rhetoric was significantly toned down.

 On how terror attacks should impact the peace process, the BJP said unless Pakistan reiterates its commitment to the January 6, 2004, agreement, talks should remain suspended.

 The agreement commits Pakistan to stop its territory from being used to promote terror.

 The BJP believes A.B. Vajpayee made a big breakthrough by getting Pakistan to sign this agreement. Vajpayees influence and personal interest in the issue has bound the BJP to a pragmatic line on Pakistan.

 For the first time, Pakistan came around to making a commitment on terrorism. But the UPA diluted that agreement when Manmohan Singh and the Pakistan President signed another agreement that laid down that peace talks would not be affected by terrorism. That was a big mistake.

 How can the dialogue remain unaffected by terror attacks? We have to work towards reverting the process to the lines of the January 6, 2004, agreement. Till then, talks should remain suspended, a source said.

 BJP spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad followed a similar line of argument but did not mention that the party wanted a moratorium on talks.

 The BJP started the peace process. But we understand that there can be no lasting peace unless terrorism is tackled. This is the biggest confidence-building measure. We cannot keep shaking hands while terror attacks continue in Srinagar, Bangalore and Mumbai. At the same time, there is a realisation in Pakistan that promoting terrorism can be counter-productive. We need to deal with the situation with a firm and clear attitude, he said.

 Islamabad Nepal claim

 The Pakistan government has said two of its citizens arrested in Nepal had no links to the Mumbai train bombings, and that the pair had been caught in connection with an old case.

 Nepal police arrested Ghulam Hussein Cheema, 53, and Atta Moinuddin Siddiqui, 56, on Tuesday over the 2001 seizure of RDX explosives. The two were remanded in custody for five days. 

 The Pakistan foreign ministry said Nepal police had told Islamabad that the arrest was in connection with an old case dating back to 2001, and that no linkage had been established with the Mumbai blasts.

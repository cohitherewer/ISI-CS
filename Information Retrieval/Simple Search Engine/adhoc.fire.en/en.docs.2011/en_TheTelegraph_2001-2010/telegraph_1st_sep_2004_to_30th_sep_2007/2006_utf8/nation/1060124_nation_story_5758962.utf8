 Jaya widens net, rival adds rider

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chennai, Jan. 23: The Jayalalithaa government today widened the reach of the proposed law to take over private cable television service providers in Tamil Nadu, leaving her main rival little option but to support the move.

 DMK chief M. Karunanidhi said his party will not oppose the bill if all the multiple service operators were nationalised in totality.

 It will amount to discrimination and vendetta if only a few cable TV networks are nationalised, he told a news conference at his party headquarters this evening.

 The comments followed the ADMK regimes move to introduce an amendment, which said more multiple service operators were being brought under government control.

 When the bill was introduced last week, it mentioned only two ? Sumangali Cable Vision, which accounts for nearly 80 per cent of cable distribution in the state and is owned by the Sun TV network run by Karunanidhis grandnephew Kalanidhi Maran; and Hathway of the Rahejas.

 The amendment ? which mentioned six more companies ? came in the wake of criticism of selective targeting. It said the legislation would also apply to any other person or company which are carrying on (the) business of multiple service optical transport system and are notified by the government later.

 The House was already tense when it assembled today. The first spark came from ADMK legislator Sekhar Babu who sought a clarification on reports that Karunanidhi and Kalanidhis brother, Union communications minister Dayanidhi Maran, met the governor to urge him not to give assent to the bill.

 Jayalalithaa added fuel to the fire, when she slammed Karunanidhi for taking resort to such surreptitious tactics of trying to influence the governors decision on a legislation still before the Assembly.

 The Speaker referred the matter to the privileges committee and, when furious DMK members insisted on a debate, ordered all of them to be evicted.

 At the news conference, Karunanidhi said he did not even know about the bill till he reached home after meeting the governor.

 Outsmarted Airtel plays it cool

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, June 28: Unnerved by the audacious hacking of its server by a youth, Airtel today tried to shrug off responsibility for the security breach, saying anyone could be hacked.

 Ankit Srivastava, a Ghaziabad resident, had hacked into the Airtel server, procured billing details of several public figures, and allegedly threatened to make this information public unless the company paid him Rs 1 crore.

 The high-profile among the targets include Delhi police commissioner K.K. Paul and several officials in the Prime Ministers Office (PMO) and the home ministry.

 Records of billing information of other senior policemen, such as deputy commissioners Tejinder Luthra and R.S.Yadav, were also found on Srivastava, the police said.

 The 20-year-old, arrested from his home on Monday, is in seven days police remand. But the police arent too pleased with Airtel either.

 Not just senior policemen but bureaucrats from the PMO and home ministry were among the targets, which is why there are serious questions about how secure their server was, a senior police officer told The Telegraph.

 The Airtel website (www.airtel.in) asks a user to register if he or she wants to receive online bills. After registering, customers simply need to type in their mobile number and an email ID they had registered.

 Srivastava has explained to the police how easy it was for him to hack into the server that contains the personal data of the telecom service providers 23.9 million users.

 Once he had the numbers and email IDs, he could check up on all family details, apart from being privy to the billing and payment details of the customer, the official said.

 Airtel, however, maintains its security system was state of the art.

 A similar scenario happened even with a multinational (Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation). It is a constant battle between anti-social elements and companies like ours, said Airtel spokeswoman Vandana Kilam.

 The reference to HSBC involves a Bangalore-based BPO worker allegedly leaking credit card information relating to the banks global clients to a gang of scamsters, who ripped off close to Rs 2 crore from those accounts.

 The difference, however, is that while HSBC suffered at the hands of an employee who was privy to inside information, Srivastava, the police believe, had no connections with Airtel insiders.

 Airtel, while admitting the need for a relook at security, was cagey about revealing the exact security mechanism it employs. The case is sensitive, and is sub judice, Kilam said.

 The police suspect that Srivastava could have used contacts in high places to get the characteristic phone code of the IAS officers and policemen.

 That would explain how he knew the numbers and email IDs, said Karnal Singh of the special branch (crime), the investigating officer.

 Government officials, including Delhi police officers, have mobiles with sequential numbers. All policemen of a certain rank in a police station would have numbers separated by one digit.

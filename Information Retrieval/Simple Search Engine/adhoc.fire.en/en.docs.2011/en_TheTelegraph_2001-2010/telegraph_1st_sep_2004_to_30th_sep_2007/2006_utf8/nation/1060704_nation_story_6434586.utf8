Death-row mufti looks to God

 Ahmedabad, July 3: Minutes after an anti-terror court sentenced him to death for the attack on the Akshardham temple four years ago, Mufti Abdul Qayumm, 35, hurriedly wrote a letter to his wife Sunaina Bano.

 I have accepted the verdict; you should also accept it. Be brave, dont ever get disheartened. Have faith in the Almighty, the letter said.

 Its an advice Sunaina has been following religiously.

 The muftis advocate had handed her the letter late in the evening ? neither she nor her 63-year-old, ailing father-in-law had been to Sabarmati Central Jail on Saturday to hear a court pronounce the sentence.

 Along with Qayumm, two others, Adam Ajmeri, 43, and Chand Khan, 33, were sentenced to death for the attack that killed 33 people. Three others received jail terms. 

 Sunaina , a mother of two, had spent hours praying and reading the Quran ever since her husband was picked up by the crime branch on August 17, 2003, from the Dariapur mosque. Since yesterday, the women of the neighbourhood have joined her, all of them reading the Quran and praying that the high court reverse the verdict.

 Father Ahmed Hussain claims the mufti is innocent. All my sons friends would vouch for that.

 One of Qayumms associates was Abdul Miya Yasin Qadri, 45, who helped him run a relief camp for the 2002 riot victims. Qadri, a cleric attached with the Dariapur mosque, was picked up the same day as Qayumm. He has been jailed for 10 years.

 Of the six convicted, my brother was the only one who hadnt given a confessional statement, said Qadris younger brother, Mohammed Yunus Qadri. That isnt the only reason he is hoping for relief from the high court. He said Qadri and Altaf Hussain Malek, 33, faced similar charges, yet Malek got off with five years in jail.

 The mother of 36-year-old Mohammed Salim Sheikh, who has been awarded a life term, stopped eating after the sentencing and his wife has been weeping inconsolably.

 During the riots, my brother was in Riyadh, where he had been working for the past 12 years, said Sheikhs brother Irfan. Sheikh was arrested on August 1, 2003, a day before he was to fly back to Riyadh. 

 Sheikh, Qadri and Qayumm, their families said, were detained illegally till August 28 when they were formally arrested. We were told not to approach a lawyer, else we would be in trouble, said the the muftis father, recalling his meeting with crime branch officials.

 Atoms split, Tarapur twin reaches nuclear milestone

 G.S. MUDUR

 Tarapur (Maharashtra), May 21: Around 1044 hours this morning, the readings on an instrument counting neutrons emerging from splitting uranium atoms inside the core of a nuclear reactor touched 37,565 and continued to climb.

 The rising neutron population marked the first sustained nuclear chain reaction inside Indias second home-grown 540-mw reactor, Unit 3 of the Tarapur Atomic Power Project. Its identical twin ? Unit 4 ? began to burn nuclear fuel last year.

 The two 540-mw reactors are Indias largest so far, a technology milestone towards even bigger energy-generating behemoths. 

 Top nuclear officials said the twin home-grown reactors are also among the worlds least expensive nuclear power plants.

 This is a great moment. It was copybook criticality, said Anil Kakodkar, the chairman of the atomic energy commission, who was in a control room watching the reactors steady move towards criticality ? the first sustained chain reaction in which neutrons from split uranium atoms split more atoms.

 Were on a path where the slope of growth in nuclear power is getting steeper and faster, Kakodkar said.

 Except for Tarapurs Unit 3 and 4, all existing indigenous nuclear reactors deliver about 220 mw. Unit 4 of Tarapur went critical in March 2005, began delivering electricity in June, and went commercial in September.

 We completed the Tarapur Unit 3 and Unit 4 project seven months earlier than scheduled and revised our cost estimates downwards, said Shreyans Jain, managing director of the Nuclear Power Corporation (NPC), the government enterprise that builds and operates nuclear power plants.

 The NPC spent Rs 6,100 crore on the construction of the twin units, instead of the Rs 6,500 crore initially estimated. 

 There are huge efforts under way now to realise these kinds of costs worldwide. This project shows that the NPC is already there, Kakodkar said.

 Unit 3 of Tarapur has also been peer-reviewed by the World Association of Nuclear Operators, and can thus claim a stamp of state-of-the-art technology.

 Over the next few weeks, NPC engineers will continue to test the behaviour of the reactor and gradually raise the power and produce heat to drive steam turbines and generate electricity.

 Unit 4 of Tarapur had taken about three months from its criticality to the point at which it was ready to feed electricity into the grid. We expect to produce electricity from Unit 3 by July this year, Jain said.

 He said the NPC would take advantage of the reduced capital costs of building the plants and reduce the cost of electricity from unit 3 and 4 of Tarapur to less than Rs 2.50 a unit. Tarapur will feed electricity to several states.

 With some design changes, the core of a 540-mw reactor could be used to produce 700-mw power, a senior NPC official said.

 A series of 700-mw reactors are a part of Indias goal of generating 10,000 mw of nuclear power through indigenous reactors that use natural uranium as fuel.

 Jain said the NPC has plans to construct twin units of 700 mw each at existing sites in Rawatbhata (Rajasthan) and Kakrapar (Gujarat).

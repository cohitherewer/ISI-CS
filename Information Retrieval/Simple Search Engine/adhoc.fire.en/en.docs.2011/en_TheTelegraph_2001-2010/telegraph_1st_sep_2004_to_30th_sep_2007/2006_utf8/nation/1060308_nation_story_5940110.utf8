 Somalian pirates hijack ship

 Mumbai, March 7 (PTI): An Indian merchant ship has been hijacked off the Somalia coast and negotiations are on for the release of the vessel and the crew, sources said today.

 All 25 members of the crew are safe, they said.

 Hiren Desai, the owner of the ship, Bhaktisagar, is camping in Dubai to hold negotiations. He could not be contacted. Sources close to him, however, said an attempt was being made to make the hijackers understand the situation and to rescue the ship and its crew.

 The Indian Coast Guard and the Marine Rescue and Coordination Cell do not have any role to play as the ship was hijacked beyond Indias maritime boundary.

 Bhaktisagar was taken over by pirates near El-Maan port while it was sailing from Kismayo port, about 35 km from the Somalian capital Mogadishu, late last month.

 This is not the first time Somalian pirates have hijacked a merchant vessel, reports said. Their usual practice is to get in touch with the owner to negotiate for the release of the vessel and the crew.

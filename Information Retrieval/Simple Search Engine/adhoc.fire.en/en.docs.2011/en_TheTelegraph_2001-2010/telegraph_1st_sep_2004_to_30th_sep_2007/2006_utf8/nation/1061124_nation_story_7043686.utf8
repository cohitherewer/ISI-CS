 Assam blast kills baby and parents

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Guwahati, 

 Nov. 23: Terror exploded at the Guwahati railway 

 station today, killing a family of three just over a fortnight 

 after coordinated blasts at two places in the Assam capital 

 claimed 16 lives.

 The victims of the blast that rocked the stations parking lot at 5.30 pm were one-and-a-half-year-old Uday and his parents Vinay, a rickshaw-puller, and Rina Chauhan. At least 11 were injured, two of them critically. 

 The blast, however, did not affect train services.

 The explosive, with a timer device, had been planted on a cycle-rickshaw, but it was not clear if Vinays vehicle was the bomb carrier. 

 Inspector-general of police (law and order) D.K. Pathak named the banned Ulfa as the main suspect. The militant group usually strikes at soft targets on or before its annual protest day November 27. 

 They have come out very strong and without inhibitions about killing defenceless civilians, said Lt Gen. R.K. Chhabra, the new chief of the armys 4 Corps.

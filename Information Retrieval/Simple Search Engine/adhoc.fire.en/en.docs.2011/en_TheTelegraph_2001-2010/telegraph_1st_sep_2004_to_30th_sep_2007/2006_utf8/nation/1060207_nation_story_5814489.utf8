 Coke amp; Pepsi get SC breather

 New Delhi (PTI): The Supreme Court on Monday stayed contempt proceedings against Coke and Pepsi for their failure to implement a Rajasthan High Court order to declare the contents of their soft drinks. 

 A division bench passed the order while hearing an appeal filed by the two multinational soft drink giants challenging the June 2005 order of Rajasthan High Court. The stay was granted after senior counsel K.K. Venugopal informed the apex court that the government has already initiated the process of enacting a law on the issue. The bill is pending before a select committee of Parliament and is likely to be cleared soon, he said. 

 Telgi confesses in 1995 case 

 Pune (PTI): Abdul Karim Telgi has confessed his involvement in a 1995 case in which he was facing charges of attempting to sell fake stamps. 

 Telgis confession before chief judicial magistrate D.W. Modak on Monday lasted five hours and 35 pages were typed by the judicial clerk in the presence of the magistrate, court sources said. 

 This is Telgis first confession since his arrest in 2002. He is facing 48 cases of fake stamp paper sale, totalling over Rs 30,000 crore. 

 On Monday, Telgi appeared before magistrate Modak 48 hours after he was asked to reflect on his decision to make a confession in the 1995 case. Telgi had told the court earlier that he wished to confess as it would expose powerful politicians, bureaucrats and businessmen involved in the scam. 

 I am very much relieved.... A load has come off from my heart... it has become quite light now, Telgi, who is an HIV patient, told his lawyer Harshad Nimbalkar.

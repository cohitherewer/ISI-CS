 New Delhi, Nov. 1: The 

 Supreme Courts monitoring committee has put on hold 

 the sealing drive in Delhi against illegal shops in residential 

 areas, capping a day on which angry traders took to the 

 streets, blocked traffic, pelted stones and smashed vehicles.

 The committee has said the sealing would not resume till further orders. The clampdown was scheduled to restart from tomorrow.

 The directive of the panel came late in the evening after a four-hour meeting with the Municipal Corporation of Delhi, the Delhi government and police.

 Earlier in the day, desperate to stave off a backlash, the Centre approached the apex court seeking relief for the traders who imposed the third day of their bandh today.

 The decision to approach the court was taken at a meeting of a group of ministers this evening, which reasoned that the sealing drive posed a threat to law and order.

 The sealing was earlier put off for a day following the monitoring committees suggestion that the government should wait for the three-day traders bandh to end. Today was the third and likely to be the last day of the bandh.

 The Centres petition sought concessions for one section of the traders those who had already offered to shift out of residential areas.

 The concern over law and order was conveyed to the monitoring committee. The court will be briefed tomorrow, Union urban development minister S. Jaipal Reddy indicated after the meeting. 

 Shopkeepers in several parts of the city took out rallies and staged sit-ins today. In some areas, the protests spiralled out of control.

 At least one bus was set on fire and several had their glass panes shattered and tyres deflated. Spare tyres and effigies of Delhi chief minister Sheila Dikshit were set ablaze. In a couple of sensitive localities like Seelampur, the scene of last months violence units of paramilitary forces were deployed.

 Traffic was thrown out of gear in several parts of Delhi. Arterial roads, connecting east of the Yamuna with the rest of the city, were the hardest hit. At the Noida crossing, traders put up a roadblock, prompting a police lathi-charge. On Vikas Marg, also in east Delhi, traders pelted stones at passing vehicles. Mobs in Seelampur stopped local trains for some time.

 The rest of the city, too, was not free of the traders ire. A rally beginning from Malviya Nagar in south Delhi disrupted traffic. In the west, a mock funeral procession for Dikshit resulted in a traffic snarl.

 The going was smoother inside the Assembly for the chief minister, where she survived a vote of no-confidence by the Opposition. 

 Before the committee announced the postponement, the Delhi government asked all schools to remain closed tomorrow, fearing violence on the streets.

 Some private schools announced they would be shut tomorrow and on Friday.

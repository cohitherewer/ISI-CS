 Breather for Salman

 Jaipur, March 10 (PTI): Actor Salman Khan today got a reprieve with a Jodhpur sessions court staying the one-year imprisonment awarded to him by a chief judicial magistrate in a 1998 chinkara poaching case.

 District and sessions judge Yashpal Choudhary admitted an appeal filed on behalf of the actor (in picture) against chief judicial magistrate B.K. Jains verdict on February 17 and ordered suspension of the sentence and a Rs 5,000 fine imposed on Salman till its ruling. 

 The next sessions court hearing is on April 12, Salmans counsel Hasitmal Sarswat said from Jodhpur.

 Sarswat argued in the appeal that Jain had pronounced his judgment without waiting for the prosecution to prove the offence beyond reasonable doubt. He demanded that the sentence be quashed.

 An application for suspension of the sentence was also filed under Section 389 of the Criminal Procedure Code, requesting that during the pendency of appeal, the sentence be set aside. Choudhary admitted this appeal.

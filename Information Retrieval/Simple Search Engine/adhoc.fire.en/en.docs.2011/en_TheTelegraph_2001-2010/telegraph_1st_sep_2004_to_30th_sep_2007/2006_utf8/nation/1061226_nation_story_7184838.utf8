 Miracle cure? Pah, scoff sadhus

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Ramdev: Misleading miracles?

 Allahabad, Dec. 25: A week before Kumbh mela, yoga guru Swami Ramdevs posters stare from every wall along the riverbank. His aides, cellphones strung together and worn like garlands round the neck, flit busily to and from the Babas tent the largest on the fair grounds.

 But to the naga (naked) sadhus and mahants arriving from the akharas across the country, Ramdev is not so much a star but what they scornfully call an item boy.

 And like the Centre, which has gagged Ramdev, they want him to stop claiming miracle cures on behalf of their spiritual discipline.

 Cure cancer through yoga? How can you do that? So many sadhus die of cancer... they couldnt even help themselves, scoffs mahant Dadhichi Giri in Sector 4 of the makeshift tent city, set up on the Gangas dry riverbed 7 km from the city.

 Giri, from Ramdevs home state of Haryana, drips sarcasm for the man misleading people with his greedy campaign.

 Professional jealousy? Neither Giri nor Swami Omkaranand in sector 5 will have any of that.

 You can teach asanas but you cant open ayurvedic shops and claim you can cure heart ailments, Omkaranand says at the Geeta Mandir camp.

 See, the aim of yoga is spiritualism; but Ramdev is the least spiritual of yogis, Giri says.

 I studied Vedanta in Varanasi, mastered yoga and spent years meditating in the Himalayas, boasts the 46-year-old who has been a naga sadhu for the past two decades, wearing nothing but his flowing beard.

 Im not sure if Ramdev can perform the guptakriyas (some of yogas most difficult acts, such as drinking through the nose) or any of the 84 most difficult asanas.

 He stands up on his toes, folds one leg and raises his folded hands up to demonstrate the lingasana. He then quickly manoeuvres his body into a Ganeshasana pose before finishing with the siddhasana in a meditative posture. 

 I dont perform these to earn my bread or massage my ego. This is a way of life with us. Its good if it helps people, but its despicable to sell it.

 Naga Baba Shivraj Giri, from Goleswar Narmadeswar Mahadev Mandir Math in Madhya Pradesh, is the bitterest.

 There were great yoga masters in the past, too, but they didnt put it on the market to earn a quick buck, he says. I challenge Ramdev to perform the lingasana before me.

 At Ramdevs tent, where a group of sadhus are climbing into a swank car, Achyutanand Swami brushes off the criticism. We dont want certificates from anyone on the Babas gifts. Whatever we are doing is for the sake of public health.

 The swami denies Ramdev ever said yoga could cure cancer. Asked about the claim on his website, he says it must be the handiwork of an over-enthusiastic follower.

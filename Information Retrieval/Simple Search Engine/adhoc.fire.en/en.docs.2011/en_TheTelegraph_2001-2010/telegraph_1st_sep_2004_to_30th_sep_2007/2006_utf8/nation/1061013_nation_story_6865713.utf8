 Battleground to boardroom

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Ahmedabad, Oct. 12: Theyve been eyeball to eyeball on treacherous heights. Now, their combat skills will be at play in the boardroom.

 Im testing my competence and capabilities. This is a new frontier for me, says Colonel Satish Tyagi, one of the 60 officers from the armed forces who have joined a six-month business management programme at the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad (IIM-A), after retirement.

 Three professors of the institute have drawn up the course at the instance of the directorate-general of resettlement, under the ministry of defence, to help officers bring a sense of purpose into their lives after service.

 They want to visit me at IIM-A before I complete this rigorous course, says the Kargil war veteran, referring to his two daughters pursuing studies in the US and Germany.

 So, as artillery columns give way to brand management, Tyagi is savouring the wonderful opportunity for a smooth transition from the battlefield to the boardroom.

 Tyagi, who set up the counter-insurgency school in Kashmir during his 30 years in the army, recalls with pride how even the Americans sent teams to study operations and models evolved at the training hub. 

 Commander Virendra Kaushik, a navy communications network specialist who was part of missions to Sri Lanka, Maldives and Somalia, cant wait to start his new career in the corporate world. He hung up his boots after 21 years of mandatory service to test the waters in the boardroom. 

 Coming from such a background, everybody expects us to do more, he said.

 We are honoured and privileged to have you amongst us. You have strategic insights, you have handled uncertainties, so your evaluation skill is naturally very high, which is very advantageous for boardroom challenges, said IIM-A director Bakul Dholakia, welcoming the batch of 36 from the army and 12 each from the navy and the air force.

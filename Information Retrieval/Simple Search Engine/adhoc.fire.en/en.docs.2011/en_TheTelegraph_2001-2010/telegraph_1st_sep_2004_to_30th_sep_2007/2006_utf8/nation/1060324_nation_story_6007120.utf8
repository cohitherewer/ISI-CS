 New Delhi, March 23: For a party coming to grips with the fallout of the Indo-US nuclear deal and the disquiet among Muslims over George W. Bushs visit, Sonia Gandhis twin resignations have come as an elixir.

 Sonias announcement was flashed at lightning speed from 10 Janpath to the party headquarters next door ? 24 Akbar Road ? and then it spread like wildfire across the capital to the suburbs and the satellite townships in Uttar Pradesh and Haryana.

 Between 3.15 pm ? when Sonia spoke to reporters ? and 5, all roads leading to her residence and the Congress office were choc-a-bloc with workers and leaders, and, ironically, aspirants to positions of power.

 So as the workers celebrated their leaders spirit of tyaag (sacrifice) and the twin slaps on her rivals faces away from the flashbulbs, out-of-work politicos such as Buta Singh, Jagdish Tytler and Sajjan Kumar made sure they were seen and heard. 

 Sajjan climbed atop a jeep and declared that the Congress president was a true disciple of Mahatma Gandhi. 

 An activist quipped that the three must be feeling a special empathy for Sonia as they, too, had sacrificed their posts, though under duress.

 So, what does the Congress make of Sonias third declaration of sacrifice? The first was in 1998, when her position as party president was contested by Sharad Pawar on the foreign origin issue and the second was in May 2004 when she nearly became Prime Minister but opted out. 

 Sources said the BJP and the Samajwadi Party had picked on a technical flaw in the law on office of profit and turned it into a political issue. The Samajwadis sought to equate Sonia with their MP, Jaya Bachchan, and were projecting it as a battle between an oppressor and a victim. It was as though Sonia and Jaya were equals, smirked one of them.

 Not just Jaya, the sources said, heavyweights like L.K. Advani and Mulayam Singh Yadav, who had bayed for Sonias scalp, were silenced by her swift response.

 However, amid the noisy celebrations, there was also a note of caution. Some in the party believe that the sacrifice could become an overkill if it happens repeatedly. 

 The problem, said a senior functionary, was not with Sonia but with her managers who have failed her in crisis after crisis. Whether it was Jharkhand, Bihar or Volcker, it is their shoddy management which landed her in trouble. They must ensure its not repeated otherwise her image will take a deep beating sometime.

 It appears that senior Congress leaders like Ahmed Patel and Janardhan Dwivedi may involve themselves in government and parliamentary matters more deeply so that their leader is insulated against future goof-ups.

 For the moment, the party is thinking of how to use the sacrifice series in the election campaign. A suggestion was to expose the Left and show how its leaders were intent on sticking to their offices despite complaints of holding offices of profit.

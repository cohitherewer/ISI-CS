 Azad focus on district recast

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Jammu, Nov. 6: The Jammu and Kashmir government today settled down to run the state from this winter capital for the next six months.

 On the first day of the opening of government offices in Jammu, chief minister Ghulam Nabi Azad said eight new districts proposed in the state would have their new administrative set-up by February.

 The commission tasked with defining the new districts Ramban, Kishtwar, Samba and Reasi in the Jammu region and Bandipore, Kulgam, Shopian and Ganderbal in the Valley will submit its report by January-end. The government will then announce officials for the posts of administrative heads. This is our commitment, which we are fulfilling, Azad told a news conference. He had announced the new districts in July this year.

 The shift from Srinagar costs the state exchequer close to Rs 100 crore and results in loss of work for almost a month every year.

 This tradition was started by Maharaja Partap Singh in the 19th century to build bridges between the Kashmir Valley and the Jammu region. Kashmiris had no access to the government in the Valley, giving rise to corruption in the officialdom during the Dogra rule and also alienated the population from the rulers.

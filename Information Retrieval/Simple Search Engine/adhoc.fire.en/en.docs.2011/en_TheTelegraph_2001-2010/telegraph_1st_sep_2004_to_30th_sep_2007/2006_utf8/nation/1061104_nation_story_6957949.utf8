 Photo glare on Najma

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 3: The CBI has registered a preliminary inquiry against Najma Heptullah, the former president of the Indian Council of Cultural Relations and BJP MP in the Rajya Sabha, on allegations of morphing her picture with that of Maulana Azad.

 The photograph appeared on the first page of a coffee table book, Journey of a Legend, with a caption describing Heptullah as being seated with Azad after her graduation. But CBI officials said while she graduated in May 1958, Azad died on February 22 the same year.

 It is alleged that Heptullahs image had been taken from a photo of hers with an Arab diplomat and superimposed over an image of the then Shah of Iran with Azad from another photograph that appears later in the book.

 The printers have apparently told the CBI that they did the doctoring job at the behest of Heptullah.

 On the basis of a public interest litigation, Delhi High Court had directed the investigation agency to look into the allegations and file a preliminary inquiry report against Heptullah, a CBI source said.

 Priyanka to pep up Rae Bareli battle

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 In charge

 New Delhi, April 28: Priyanka Vadra will once again be Sonia Gandhis election agent, managing the booth-level work in Rae Bareli as brother Rahul runs the campaign. Her job will be to ensure all the voters are registered, have their identity cards and go out to vote on May 8.

 Congress sources today said there is complete synergy of efforts between the siblings, whose aim is to ensure their mother wins by a record margin.

 There is a suggestion that Sonia try and surpass the record 7.44 lakh votes polled by the CPMs Anil Basu, who had won 77 per cent of the votes in Arambagh in 2004. But the scorching May heat is worrying Sonias campaign managers, who fear it could hit the turnout.

 Priyanka is not new to the job of shepherding voters to the booths, having worked as her mothers election agent twice before ? in Rae Bareli in 2004 and in Amethi in 1999, when Sonia made her poll debut.

 Priyanka could also double as a shadow candidate for her mother. A candidate needs to complete all kinds of formalities required by the Election Commission. Since Sonia is busy with the Assembly elections, she will not be available at all times to sign the papers. Priyanka will do the needful, an Uttar Pradesh Congressman said.

 Rahul, who is running the campaign this time, cannot be a poll agent because the poll commissions rules debar a Lok Sabha MP from being one.

 But the more important factor, Congress sources said, is that Priyankas continued presence in Rae Bareli will galvanise the workers, who reportedly have still not got used to Rahuls unconventional manner of functioning, his matter-of-fact approach to politics and his apparent distaste for adulation.

 Not that Priyanka demands sycophancy but she recognises the realities of UPs feudal style of politics and is more indulgent with the workers, a source said.

 Priyanka apparently doesnt mind unscheduled stopovers at workers homes while touring the constituency or stopping her vehicle to chat with farmers.

 While Rahul is reportedly a trifle impatient with the cloying references to his family, Priyanka is believed to savour the allusions to grandmother Indira Gandhi and grandfather Feroze.

 Priyanka is likely to be in Rae Bareli from May 1 till May 8 when the votes will be polled.

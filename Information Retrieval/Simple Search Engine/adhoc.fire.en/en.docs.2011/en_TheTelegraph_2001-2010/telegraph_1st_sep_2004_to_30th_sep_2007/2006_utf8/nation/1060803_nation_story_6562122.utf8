 Child law in place, NGOs want action

 New Delhi, Aug. 2: The government has widened the scope to prevent child labour by punishing those who employ children. But it did not bother to give teeth to the existing law for two decades. 

 Not a single violator of the Child Labour (Regulation and Prohibition) Act, which came into effect in 1986, has been sent to jail. The army of child workers has been growing regardless of the law. Their number is around 70-90 million.

 Most of the offenders have been let off with a fine of Rs 50 to Rs 100, said Kailash Satyarthi, head of the Bachpan Bachao Andolan, an NGO working with child workers and children in bondage. 

 The labour ministry yesterday banned the employment of children under 14 in domestic households and eateries. Satyarthi felt the Centres decision to add these two sectors in the category of hazardous occupation is a step forward. It has become yet another tool in our fight to end child labour. 

 But the government lacks the political will to implement the legislation. Whatever work has been done has been done by the NGOs, he said.

 Satyarthi is writing a letter to Union labour minister Chandrashekhar Rao to enforce the law strictly. 

 The civil society has to be involved in a large way, said Satyarthi. In two areas of south Delhi, his organisation involved resident welfare associations to take a stand against those employing domestic child workers.

 He said the residents were cooperative. When we tried this out there was no legal backing. Our effort was entirely on moral grounds. Now we have the law to help us.

 NGOs say the state governments have no machinery to implement the act. Labour inspectors are found lax. The government is indifferent and the civil society is yet to be adequately sensitised. 

 A section among the NGOs is raising another aspect of the problem which arises from children losing their economic livelihood. What happens to the child workers who are very often the sole breadwinner in their families?

 In 1996, the Supreme Court had cited a solution. It said each child who loses a job in a hazardous occupation should be substituted by an adult from the same family. The offender should pay Rs 20,000 and the government Rs 5,000 to put together a rehabilitation fund for the child. The money can be spent on the childs education and family. 

 There has not been a single follow-up on that ruling, said Satyarthi. 

 Rule from Oct. 10

 The new provisions that have been added to the act will come into force from October 10, not August 10 as mentioned in todays edition, which gives the employers three months time to take the necessary steps.

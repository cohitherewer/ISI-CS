 Battle for citys lungs amp; labour

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, March 7: Environmentalists and urban planners fighting for Mumbais lungs have described the Supreme Court verdict as disastrous and shocking while activists representing mill workers threatened to hit the streets.

 Environmentalist Darryl DMonte, who authored the first detailed book on the decline of the textile mills five years ago, said: The city will never have this much area in midtown Mumbai ever again. This was one opportunity to use the land that has now been squandered.

 Painting a grim picture, DMonte said the mill workers would be further marginalised. Like the jute mills in West Bengal, Mumbais textile mills were unique in the sense that no other city had 2.5 lakh workers in one single industry. 

 The workers would now sell their chawls for redevelopment, and move to far-flung suburbs. They are likely to become what are euphemistically called informal workers with no security, no holidays. It could only lead to jobless growth.

 The Girangaon Sangharsh Samiti, fighting for workers rights in the textile zone in central Mumbai called Girangaon, will hold a protest rally on March 14 at Azad Maidan to pressure the government to restore the original development control rules.

 According to the original rules, one-third each of mill land would have to be set aside for open spaces and low-cost housing and the last one-third could be commercially developed. But the rules were changed to exclude existing buildings from the division, and limit it only to open land.

 Samiti convener Datta Iswalkar said: Two-and-a-half lakh mill workers, affected by mill closures, who were promised land rights and housing in exchange, are now cheated of their rights.

 Architect Neera Adarkar, who co-authored a book on mill land last year, said the ruling set a bad precedent which could destroy the very basis of demanding a better environment. 

 The Maharashtra government had pulled all stops to protect the people of Ulhasnagars illegal buildings by enacting a law protecting them. We want the government to do the same to protect the city from losing its open spaces. The courts have given their verdict, now it is the time for the legislature to act in the interest of the citizens.

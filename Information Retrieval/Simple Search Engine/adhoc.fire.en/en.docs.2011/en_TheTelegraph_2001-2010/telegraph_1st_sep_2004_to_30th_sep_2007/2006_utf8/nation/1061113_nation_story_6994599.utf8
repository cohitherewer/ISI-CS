 Lucknow, Nov. 12: Racy Bollywood numbers today livened up the Bahujan Samaj Party office here, decorated with blue balloons and elephant posters.

 As the score of Ashiq banaya, the Himesh Reshammiya hit, began to play, party MPs, MLAs and district presidents who had gathered for a briefing on the coming Assembly elections were taken aback. Till the lyrics burst forth: Jungle banaya, jungle banaya re, UP ko jungle banaya....

 Mayavati looked on happily as one song after another lyrics suitably changed was played. The China Gate number Chhamma Chhamma was turned into Behena, behena kumari Maya behena, tum bin UP ki halat bari khasta hai.... 

 Kajra re, which saw Aishwarya Rai teaming up with the Bachchan father and son in Bunty Aur Babli, became: Ajao re, Ajao re Mayavati ban jao re phir se mukhya mantri....

 The afternoon of music at the party office on Lal Bahadur Shastri Marg ended on an upbeat note: Ab karo vijay ki taiyari, nischit hai jai hamari a take on a song from Taal.

 I have not exactly written the songs myself but I have suggested the themes of these songs, Mayavati beamed. A mix of popular film numbers and Dalit slogans would be used to spread the BSPs message in the campaign to be launched this month-end, she announced. The party will produce CDs of the songs and circulate them, she said.

 Mayavati will kick off the campaign on November 30, when the party will burn an effigy of chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav for failing to mourn Kanshi Rams death. Mulayam neither attended the funeral of the BSP founder in Delhi nor declared official mourning for him in the state, she said.

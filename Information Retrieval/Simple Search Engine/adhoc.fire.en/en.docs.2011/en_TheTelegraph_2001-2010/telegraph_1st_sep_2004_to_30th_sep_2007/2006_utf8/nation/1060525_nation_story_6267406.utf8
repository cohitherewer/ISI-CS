 Opposition speaks in two voices

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 24: Quotas have landed the Opposition in a flap.

 Unable to criticise the decision on quotas, the BJP today attacked the government for not evolving a consensus but a key ally contradicted the principal Opposition party.

 NDA allies, especially the Janata Dal (United), have openly welcomed the decision to extend 27 per cent quotas to OBCs in higher education. But the BJP accused the Centre of failing to introduce steps to build capacity in educational institutions.

 BJP general secretary Arun Jaitley said the governments stark failure in taking everyone along has led to widespread discontent.

 We are in favour of providing social justice to vulnerable sections. We believe that in the existing system, reservation is an effective mechanism to tackle inequality. But the government has mishandled the situation. They have failed to evolve a consensus, Jaitley said.

 But Dal(U) President Sharad Yadav said the UPAs decision was a result of widespread political consensus. There was a full-fledged debate in Parliament and absolute political consensus.

 Jaitley said the government was supposed to call an all-party meeting after a group of ministers submitted its report. But they did not do it.

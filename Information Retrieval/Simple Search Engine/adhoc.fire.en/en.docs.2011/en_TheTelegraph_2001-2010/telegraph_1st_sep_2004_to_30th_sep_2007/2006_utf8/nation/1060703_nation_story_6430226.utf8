 Centre allies call for OBC count

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 2: Several UPA constituents today dem- anded a census to determine the exact percentage of other backward classes (OBCs) in India. 

 The PMK and the Nationalist Congress party (NCP), which made the census demand, found support from former Prime Minister V.P. Singh and Janata Dal United (JDU) chief Sharad Yadav, an ally of the Opposition NDA.

 The Samajwadi Party, which is supporting the UPA from outside, also spoke in favour of the caste-based study.

 The census will once and for all prove to all that OBCs constitute the majority of Indias population ? about 60 per cent in fact, PMK president S. Ramadoss said at a seminar on reservation for OBCs. 

 The meet, attended by leaders across the political spectrum, was organised as a rejoinder to the protests against the 93rd amendment to the Constitution allowing 27 per cent reservation for OBCs in higher education institutions. 

 The leaders made it clear that they would press for the reservation bill to be passed in the monsoon session of Parliament. The Parliament has passed the amendment. Now there is no reason for further delay, CPI secretary D. Raja said. 

 Once it is proved that the OBCs make up the majority of Indian population, the leaders said there would be no argument opposing reservation.

 Right now, 10 per cent people are controlling the countrys future. OBCs need to be given a stake in decision making and decision makers need sound education, said the CPMs Sitaram Yechury. 

 The last such caste-based census was conducted by the British in 1930. 

 Blaming the media for only covering anti-reservation protests and not giving a voice to the OBC students in favour of reservation, the leaders said they would not allow a parallel parliament.

 A microscopic section of India thinks it can use the media and its position in the echelons of power to run a parallel parliament. This cannot be allowed, the NCPs Chhagan Bhujbal said to loud applause from BJP leader Santosh Kumar Gangwar.

 Recent events had shown, they said, that reservation was essential in the media and judiciary. ... the only way OBCs can be given a voice, said Congress MP and AICC general secretary V. Ramasamy.

 Frustrated with the long delay between his initiation of the Mandal reforms ? in 1990 ? and the 93rd amendment, V.P. Singh called for a national referendum to decide the legitimacy of reservations for OBCs. The overwhelming support for reservation among backward classes will then be clear for all to see. 

 The governments Knowledge Commission also came in for some stick for its opposition to the constitutional amendment. Two of its members, Pratap Bhanu Mehta and Andre Beteille, had resigned in protest against OBC reservation in higher education.

 The Knowledge Commission and Sam Pitroda (its chairman) have become tools in the hands of Ratan Tata and Rahul Bajaj, said Yadav.

 The leaders rubbished the meritocracy argument that the commission and many students, particularly at AIIMS, the IITs and IIMs, have raised. 

 Merit can be judged only among equals, said former BJP leader Uma Bharati. 

 Upper caste IITians and IIM graduates, the leaders said, benefit from subsidised education and then go abroad at the first opportunity.

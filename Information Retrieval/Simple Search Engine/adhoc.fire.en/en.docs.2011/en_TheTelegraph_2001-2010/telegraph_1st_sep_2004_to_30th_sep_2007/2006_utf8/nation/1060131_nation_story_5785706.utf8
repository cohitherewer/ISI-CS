 DMK snub

 Chennai, Jan. 30: M. Karunanidhi today sent his state allies a stern message, saying that though the DMK-led seven-party grouping will fight the upcoming Assembly polls together, there will be no coalition government if it wins, reports our special correspondent.

 This means that like last time, the DMK will keep a huge chunk of the 234 constituencies for itself to improve its chances of forming a government on its own.

 The news will disappoint two of the partys Democratic Progressive Alliance partners, PMK and MDMK, eyeing a larger seat share.

 Karunanidhi, however, stressed that the pre-poll alliance is very much on.

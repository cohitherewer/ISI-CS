 CPM turns voracious

 JOHN MARY

 Thiruvananthapuram, April 2: The CPM has lived up to its Big Brother image in Kerala by snatching as many as 14 seats from its partners, fuelling speculation that the coalition leader is eyeing a majority on its own.

 Kerala, which has 140 seats, goes to polls in three phases on April 22, April 29 and May 3.

 The CPM and its Independent candidates are contesting in 91 seats this time, against 77 in the Assembly elections of 2001. The party will field its own candidates in 84 seats, setting aside seven difficult slots for Independents, including former Delhi development commissioner K.J. Alphons.

 The CPI, the second major partner of the Left Democratic Front, has emerged unscathed, retaining all the 24 seats it contested last time. Smaller parties like the RSP, the Kerala Congress (Joseph) and the Nationalist Congress Party are among those which lost seats to the CPM.

 Alphons, a Syrian Catholic, is the CPM-backed Independent candidate in the rubber heartland of Kanjirapally, where the Left party would have faced an uphill task had it fielded a thoroughbred Marxist.

 The party has adopted similar tactics elsewhere. At Kuttipuram in the Muslim-dominated Malappuram in the north, the CPM has fielded former Muslim Youth League leader K.T. Jaleel against former industries minister P.K. Kunhalikutty, who had to quit the Oommen Chandy ministry after being linked to a sex scandal.

 The CPM, which lost some of its invincible aura after a bitter battle between its senior leaders, has also taken care to distance itself from controversial leaders. The front has denied seats to a former minister convicted in a molestation case and a former legislator who tampered with evidence in a case. 

 The two belong to the junior partners, the Janata Dal (Secular) and the Kerala Congress (Joseph).

 Left front convener Paloly Mohammed Kutty told reporters here today that he had conveyed the collective sentiment of the front to the two parties on the controversial candidates.

 The JD(S) asked the former minister, Neelalohitadasan Nadar, to step aside but he said a decision would be taken after consulting his supporters.

 Antony Raju, a Kerala Congress (Joseph) member, has been dumped because police had recently charged him with tampering with evidence in a narcotics case.

 He was alleged to have spirited out of court the underwear in which an Australian had tried to smuggle hashish 16 years ago. The vest was re-sized and taken back to the court.

 The lower court had convicted the Australian but he was discharged by the high court on the strength of the tampered evidence.

 Want Paradise cheap? Visit the Valley

 Srinagar, Dec. 3: In this Paradise on earth, land comes cheap.

 Sample this: A property little more than an acre in the heart of Kashmirs summer capital pays Rs 6,485 a year as rent to the government when its estimated market value is Rs 15-20 crore.

 The 10.75-kanal Dhananjibhoy complex one kanal is about an eighth of an acre is leased to Sheikh Abdullahs family till 2017. 

 The former chief ministers family 

 is not the only one with influence to have pocketed prime 

 land for a pittance.

 The 11.6-kanal Broadway Hotel, leased to Congress leader K.K. Amla, pays Rs 4,650 as rent a year. Thats roughly what the 100-room hotel worth between Rs 11 crore and Rs 17 crore in the market charges a customer for a nights stay.

 Under the Jammu and Kashmir Land Grants Act, 1978, state land can be leased to both state and non-state subjects for 99 years. The rent is Rs 40 a kanal for a year for residential plots and Rs 400 for commercial ones.

 Official sources say 7,900 kanals in Srinagar have been leased out. This land alone, if auctioned, will fetch the state thousands of crores, a government official said.

 Instead, all that it fetches is Rs 1.93 lakh as rent a year. That includes what the BSF pays the government Re 1 a year for the 5,518 kanals it occupies on the citys outskirts. In most of these cases, the beneficiaries have not paid any premium. They got the land almost free, said a senior officer. 

 Today, shopping complexes, hotels and offices have come up on these plots. While the government got nothing, the occupants became richer and richer, said a source.

 Thats not the end of the story. If they were leaseholdings so far, they would be property very soon and at dirt-cheap rates. 

 The government last week passed an ordinance under which people will get property rights to government plots for which they now pay rent. They need to pay just 25 per cent of the market value of the property in residential areas and 30 per cent for those in commercial localities.

 The ordinance follows a 2004 law, the Vesting of Ownership Act, popularly called the Roshni act. The objective of the act was to sell the leased land and utilise the money for generating power. But very few responded. Law minister T.H. Qarra said the move failed because occupants were asked to pay market rates. In the ordinance, we are giving many concessions.

 Which means, as a top officer put it, even less revenue. In some cases settled under Roshni, market rates were undervalued and occupants got their land for even one-third of the actual value, he said. With the fresh ordinance, they will get it at a much lower cost.

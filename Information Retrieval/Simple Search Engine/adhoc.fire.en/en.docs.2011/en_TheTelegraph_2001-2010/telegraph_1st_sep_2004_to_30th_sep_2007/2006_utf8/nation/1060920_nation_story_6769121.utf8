 PVR plans production with Aamir

 Aamir: New partner

 New Delhi, Sept. 19 (PTI): Multiplex screen operator PVR has said it will venture into film production and has tied up with actor-producer Aamir Khan for two movies. 

 We plan to produce two movies every year and to begin with have tied up with Aamir Khan Production Ltd with an investment of Rs 20 crore, PVR Cinema chairman and managing director Ajay Bijli said. 

 PVR is eyeing B and C category towns through its new theatres, PVR Talkies. We currently have 70 operating screens under PVR Cinemas and are looking to have a total of 500 screens by 2010, including 200 under the new PVR Talkies, PVR Talkies CEO Ashish Shukla said.

 The company said it would invest about Rs 200 crore for the new venture. 

 It is my fervent hope that PVR Talkies will induce people to come back to the big screen, Bijli said. The estimated investment per screen for PVR Talkies is around Rs 1 crore while for a general screen it is around Rs 2-2.5 crore, he said.

 Going by these figures, proposed investments for around 200 PVR Talkies screens and 230 additional PVR Cinema screens could be around Rs 700 crore by 2010.

 Bijli said the tickets would be priced between Rs 40 and Rs 60. The theatres will be opened by end-September in Aurangabad and Latur.

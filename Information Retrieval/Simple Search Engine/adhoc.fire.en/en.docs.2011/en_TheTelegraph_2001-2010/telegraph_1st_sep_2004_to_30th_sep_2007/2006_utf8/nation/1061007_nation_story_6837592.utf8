 Sabarimala suit threat

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Bangalore, Oct. 6: Kannada actress Jaimala is considering suing the Kerala government for maligning her name in the Sabarimala row.

 Addressing the media today, she accused Devaswom Board officials and Kerala temple administration minister G. Sudhakar of a conspiracy to gain political mileage. They have misused my silence and never taken my version, she said.

 A controversy had erupted after Jaimala (in picture) claimed she had touched the Ayyappa idol at the Sabarimala temple, where women between puberty and menopause are not allowed.

 Her claim came after a revelation by celebrity astrologer Parappanangadi Unnikrishna Panicker, who proclaimed during a devaprashnam conducted by him that Ayyappas abode was defiled by a female presence.

 I have been made a scapegoat for the political interests of Sudhakar, Jaimala said.

 The Kerala government had ordered an inquiry headed by the Devaswom Board superintendent of police. 

 A team of board officials visited Bangalore to take her statement a few months ago. But the actress had refused to meet them without a prior appointment.

 I was ready to cooperate with them. But after the initial attempt to contact me, they never wrote or called me. They have misused my silence and claimed that I did not cooperate in the probe, she said, unhappy that the CID report was leaked to the media even before it was presented before the Kerala cabinet.

 The actress said she was very upset over the way the issue had been handled.

 Freak blast kills jawans

 Lucknow, Jan. 15 (PTI): Three soldiers of the elite Guards Regiment were killed when a mortar exploded during firing exercises near Jhansi in Uttar Pradesh.

 Sepoys Rampati Yadav, Sanjay Yadav and Ashok Singh Sahi were conducting training courses for foreign army personnel, including those from Singapore, when the mortar exploded, army officials said.

 Apparently, the mortar rounds were faulty, they added. The incident happened at 3.30 pm when the soldiers, who were conducting the training, fired the 84mm mortar which exploded, killing all the three instantly. 

 No foreign soldier or member of the Singapore Army was involved in the incident, they said.

 The firing ranges of the 41st Armoured Division at Babina were being used to train Singapore army personnel in the use of artillery guns.

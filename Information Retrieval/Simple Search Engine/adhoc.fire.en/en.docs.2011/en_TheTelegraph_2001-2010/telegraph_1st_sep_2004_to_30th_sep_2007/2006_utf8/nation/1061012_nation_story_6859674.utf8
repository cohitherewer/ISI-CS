 The family, which moved to Britain in 2003, had gone to Cardiff over the weekend. The couple rushed back when informed of the racist graffiti sprayed across their house in Middlesbrough.

 This is terrible. We are not terrorists. We came here for a better life and now this happens. We are from India and we are not Muslims. I am a Catholic. This is racism, Jojimol said.

 I dont want to leave this house. My husband works nights and what am I going to do if anything happens here? she said.

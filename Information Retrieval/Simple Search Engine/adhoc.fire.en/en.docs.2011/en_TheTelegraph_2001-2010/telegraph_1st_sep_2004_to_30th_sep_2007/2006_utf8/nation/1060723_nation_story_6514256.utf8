 MP noose on conversions

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Bhopal, July 22: The Shivraj Singh Chauhan government in Madhya Pradesh has introduced a bill imposing more restrictions on religious conversions. 

 According to provisions of the bill tabled in the Assembly, a would-be convert will have to inform district authorities a month in advance. The existing law ? Madhya Pradesh Freedom of Religion Act 1968 ? stipulates that a person should inform the authorities within a month of changing religion.

 For the first time, the priest or anyone solemnising the conversion has been brought in the ambit of the law. 

 Any religious person conducting the conversion proceedings will have to inform the district administration 15 days in advance, Chauhan said. He said he was confident that the bill would become a law before July 28 when the monsoon session concludes. 

 Denying the charges of the Opposition Congress that the draconian provisions will be used against minorities, particularly Christian missionaries, the chief minister said: There will be no harassment; justice will be meted out to all. There is no discrimination on the ground of religion or community in Madhya Pradesh, he said pointing to similar laws in Orissa, Tamil Nadu and Gujarat. 

 But Christian leaders disagreed with the chief minister. They contended that the proposed changes violated freedom of conscience, which is guaranteed in the Constitution and the universal declaration of human rights. Archbishop of Bhopal Pascal Topno said he was unhappy and hurt.

 This is a grave injustice being done to the Christians. We have never, ever, converted anyone through force or enticement, he said and added that the terms allurement and forced conversions were vague. 

 This (proposed bill) only protects and defends those who perpetrate attacks against the Christians, Topno said. 

 Penalties for violators have been changed drastically. Instead of a years imprisonment and a fine of Rs 1,000, the bill proposes jail for 36 months and fines up to Rs 100,000.

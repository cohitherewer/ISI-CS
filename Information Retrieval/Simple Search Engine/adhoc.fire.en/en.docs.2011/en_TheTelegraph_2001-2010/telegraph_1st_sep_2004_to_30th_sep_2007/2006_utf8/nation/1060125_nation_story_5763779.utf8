 IAF asked to get on fast track

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 24: Defence minister Pranab Mukherjee said here today that he has asked the Indian Air Force to expedite the shedding of old technology while executing plans to replace them with new equipment simultaneously.

 Mukherjee said the IAF would phase out outdated equipment, including aero engines, after systematic cost-benefit analysis of operational, maintenance, financial and safety factors. 

 Speaking at an international flight safety conference hosted by the air force, he said the Centre had streamlined procurement policies and the induction of new equipment would be on the basis of the latest guidelines.

 Among procurement currently being made under the new policy was the import of spares from Russia and erstwhile Soviet countries. 

 A fast-track procurement mechanism was evolved and a task force deputed to Russia for immediate purchases of spare and expeditious finalisation of contracts, he said.

 Orissa tribal dies

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, March 11: One more tribal injured in the January 2 police firing in Kalinga Nagar succumbed to bullet injuries today, taking the death toll to 13.

 Shyam Gagrai, a tribal youth, died in the wee hours at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in Delhi. 

 On January 2, 12 tribals were killed in the Kalinga Nagar industrial complex after the police fired at hundreds who had converged at the complex to stop work on land acquired by the Tata Group to set up a steel plant. The tribals said they had been displaced after their land was taken from them.

 Gagrai, from Baligotha village in the Kalinga Nagar police station area, was hit in the stomach during the firing. 

 On January 18, he was shifted from SCB Medical College in Cuttack to AIIMS after his condition deteriorated. He is survived by his mother, sister and a younger brother. 

 Chief minister Naveen Patnaik, who is in Delhi, paid floral tributes to Gagrai at AIIMS.

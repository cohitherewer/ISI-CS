 Delhi spies terror camps

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Srinagar, April 18: Militant training camps across the Line of Control are flourishing despite the confidence-building measures between India and Pakistan, Union home secretary V.K. Duggal said today.

 Duggal earlier met senior army, paramilitary, police and civil officials here. In spite of all the CBMs, training camps are still flourishing across the border, the home secretary said. We have the numbers of those who have received training in these camps. We also have the numbers of those planning to infiltrate, but we are ready to meet that challenge. 

 Duggal confirmed that the Jammu and Kashmir government had asked for central forces to fight terrorists, but added that such additional deployment of troops was event-based. This is the time we have to review the internal security of the state, he said, as byelections are going to be held here on April 24. 

 The snow is melting, which makes infiltration possible around this time of the year. The state government offices are re-opening in Srinagar after their six-month recess. The annual Amarnath Yatra is also beginning in June, he said.

 Duggal confirmed that trade would take off shortly on the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad route. But before that the required road conditions have to be achieved and we have to put the scanning equipment in place to secure the route for trade, he said.

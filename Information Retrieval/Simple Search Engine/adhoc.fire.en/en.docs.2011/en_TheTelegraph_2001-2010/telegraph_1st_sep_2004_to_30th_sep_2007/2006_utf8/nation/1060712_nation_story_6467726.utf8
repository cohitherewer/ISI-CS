 Trains halt, chaos on roads

 July 11: The blasts led to massive disruption of road traffic in the city. With trains not running, the main arteries were choked for hours after the explosions.

 Many office-goers could not return home. Sanya Bannerjee, an employee with a multinational portal with its office in Lower Parel, near Dadar, said she couldnt go back home in Jogeshwari because of the traffic condition. Jogeshwari is on the western line, on which all the blasts took place.

 Sanya said the road to Dadar was a sea of vehicles and many of her colleagues were stuck. She said a friend would collect her from the office and take her to south Mumbai. There were thousands like her.

 Chandra Khot, a television employee, who lives in Goregaon, also on the western line, stayed put at her office in Worli after the blasts and would stay the night at a friends place in Worli. 

 But she also had to ask her relatives, who were returning to Calcutta tonight and had started for Kurla station, to cancel the journey. They came back, but were waiting for her at her office, as they could not go back to her residence. They would all have to stay back at Chandras friends place.

 Fatima Khan, a media professional who lives in Vashi, on the Harbour Line, had come for work in town. After the blasts happened, she decided to stay back with her relatives in south Mumbai. Though trains had stopped only on the western line, Fatima said she did want to risk going back home.

 But it was worse for those who had ventured out. A bank employee, who decided to start for her home in Kandivli, did not know when she would finally reach, as she sat in a colleagues car near Lower Parel. There were rows and rows of cars ahead of her that refused to move, she said.

 The people who did reach home after surviving the blasts said they would never get over what they saw. 

 Ramona Fernandes, an office-goer who lives in Borivli was at Borivli station when the blast occurred there.

 I took the Churchgate-Borivli local around 6.10 pm. A few minutes later I heard a deafening explosion and the train shook. People thought it was a cylinder blast. But before we knew what had happened, there were bodies and dismembered limbs pouring out of compartments and being carried into rickshaws and police vans, said Fernandes.

 There was a woman on a stretcher covered in blood. There were many others injured. They were carried in autorickshaws to a hospital.

 Actress Celina Jaitley also witnessed the blast. The Mahim blast happened right in front of my eyes. At that time, my car was next to the train tracks. Many people just died there. I have never seen something like this in my life, Jaitley said in an SMS.

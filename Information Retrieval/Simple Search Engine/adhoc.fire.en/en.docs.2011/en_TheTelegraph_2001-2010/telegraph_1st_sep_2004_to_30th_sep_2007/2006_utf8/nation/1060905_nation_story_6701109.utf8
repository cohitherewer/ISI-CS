 Defence strike looms

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 4: Defence minister Pranab Mukherjee, who took credit last week for drafting a new defence acquisitions policy, faces his first hurdle in implementing it with unions in the public sector and the ordnance factories calling for a strike on September 18.

 Ironically, on August 30, the day Mukherjee released the Defence Procurement Procedures and the Defence Procurement Manual, he also met CPI and Aituc leader Gurudas Dasgupta and urged him to discourage the unions from going on the strike.

 The unions affiliated to the Intuc, the BMS and the Lefts Citu and Aituc have called the strike.

 Mukherjee told Dasgupta that he would discuss the demands of the employees unions shortly after his return from France and Germany. He has also written to Dasgupta urging him to use his offices to call off the strike. The minister is expected to return on September 8.

 The unions have demanded that the government reject the proposals of the Vijay Kelkar Committee on restructuring the defence industry. 

 But Mukherjee has taken credit for incorporating suggestions made by the committee in its two reports submitted last year in the new policy.

 The unions have objected to the recommendations to turn the ordnance factories into companies. The 39 ordnance factories and the eight defence public sector undertakings make up the core of the defence industry in the country. The private sector has had only a limited role to play in defence equipment production so far. But the decision to pass on benefits from offsets from large imports lays the pitch for the private sector to increase its stake in defence production.

 Unions have objected to such measures that they fear will whittle down the role of the government units and lead to job losses. An estimated 5.5 lakh civilian employees are engaged in defence production units.

 Reforms to involve the private sector in defence production were initiated under the NDA government but evoked a lukewarm response. The participation of private industry so far has been limited to contracts for components outsourced by the public sector units. In the current policy, however, Mukherjee expects private companies to be more enthusiastic because more funds will flow in from offsets. The doors are now open for Indian industry to participate in defence research and development, Mukherjee had proclaimed while announcing the new policy. An estimated Rs 45,000 crore in offset benefits is estimated between 2007 and 2012.

 In a separate category identified in the defence policy, Indian companies would be encouraged to development complex systems for the armed forces.

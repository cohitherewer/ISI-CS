 Paul kin gets court call-up

 New Delhi, Aug. 16: A Delhi trial court has summoned M.D. Jindal, brother-in-law of Swraj Paul, in connection with a forgery case on November 28.

 This follows a complaint filed by Caparo Maruti a joint venture between Pauls steel giant Caparo and Maruti Udyog. It has the backing of the 75-year-old NRI baron.

 Paul owns 60 per cent of Caparo Maruti, while Jindal and Maruti have a 20 per cent stake each. A long-time partner of Paul, Jindal headed the firm between 1994 and 2003, when Pauls son, Angad, replaced him.

 The switch is believed to have led to the three-year-old spat between Jindal and Paul. The complaint accuses Jindal of illegally trying to acquire control of Caparo Marutis board by fabricating documents. 

 The court finds the allegations sufficient enough to form prima facie opinion on offences like cheating, forgery, using forged documents as genuine, fraudulent cancellation of valuable security and criminal conspiracy by the accused persons, said judge Manish Yadurvanshi.

 According to the complaint, Jindal held unautho- rised board meetings after allegedly putting two of his associates unilaterally on the governing panel. 

 The two, Surya Kant Aggarwal and J. L. Garg, are the co-accused. 

 This is not the only case which Paul and Jindal are fighting for control of the 700-million Caparo group. 

 Soon after being removed as chairman of Caparo Maruti, Jindal accused Paul and his executives of illegally diverting funds from Caparo to a competing supplier. That case, filed in 2003, is now at the trial stage. 

 The most serious charge by Caparo against Jindal figures in a separate case. This relates to an applica- tion to the registrar of companies in which he has sought its nod for fabricated minutes of the unauthorised meetings. 

 If proved, Jindal faces severe punishment under the Companies Act for misleading a public authority, the court said. He is now out on bail.

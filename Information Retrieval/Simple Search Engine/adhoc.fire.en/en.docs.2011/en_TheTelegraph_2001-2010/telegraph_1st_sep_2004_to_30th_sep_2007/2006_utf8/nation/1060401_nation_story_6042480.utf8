 Tour guide breather 

 New Delhi, March 31: The Supreme Court today stayed the death sentence awarded to a Varanasi guide for killing a tourist from New Zealand in 1997, reports our legal correspondent.

 A bench of Justices B.N. Agrawal and A.K. Mathur also admitted a petition challenging an Allahabad High Court order confirming the death sentence awarded to Dharam Dev Yadav for killing Diana Clare Routley.

 In February 2003, a trial court had sentenced Yadav to death for killing and sealing Dianas body under the floor of his house in Uttar Pradeshs Brindaban village. He had killed her to steal her travellers cheques and valuables.

 Four other accused were acquitted.

 Varanasi police had registered a case in July 1998 following a complaint from Dianas father. He said Diana, who was staying at Old Vishnu Guest House, had not contacted the family since August 1997. Investigations revealed she was seen on August 10, 1997 at the Varanasi railway station with the accused and later at a teashop in Brindaban.

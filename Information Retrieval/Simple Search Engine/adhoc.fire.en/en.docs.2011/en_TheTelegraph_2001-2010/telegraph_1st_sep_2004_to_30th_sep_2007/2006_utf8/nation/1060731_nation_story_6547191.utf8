 Karat firm on nuclear resolution

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 30: CPM general secretary Prakash Karat today said the UPA government must talk to all political parties, including the BJP, to decide the procedure in which the sense of Parliament on the Indo-US nuclear deal will be expressed.

 During the Iraq war, we spoke and interacted with the BJP despite our differences with the NDA government, Karat said at the end of a two-day politburo meeting. 

 The matter has to come before Parliament. Parameters on the negotiations have to be spelt out.

 The Congress leadership was hoping to satisfy the Left with a statement from the Prime Minister. Defence minister Pranab Mukherjee had gone to the extent of saying a resolution on the matter would mean the end of the day for the UPA government.

 Karat has made it clear that his party is not going to let the government off easily. People are asking a legitimate question. How is it possible that the US Congress is discussing the deal threadbare and taking decisions when the Indian Parliament is not even scrutinising it, he said. 

 That the CPM politburo is not willing to budge from its demand was also clear from the statement it issued. 

 The politburo expressed serious concern at the matter in which terms of the agreement have been changed and new provisions have been attached by the US, it said. In such a situation, it is imperative that Parliament discuss the issue.

 The nuclear agreement should be taken up in the monsoon session of Parliament itself. It is no use discussing the matter after the US Congress adopts the relevant law, the politburo added.

 The Prime Minister had earlier asked the Left and the Opposition to wait for the final US legislation before protesting against the deal.

 The party had identified nine points of departure in the Congress drafts from the original agreement of July last year.

 On Lebanon, too, the UPA government has not yielded to the CPMs demands that it must stop buying arms from Israel during the period of war and that it should take the lead in getting international sanctions imposed on Tel Aviv. 

 The CPM leadership in Parliament has collected 86 signatures and submitted a memorandum to the Prime Minister highlighting these demands. 

 Manmohan Singh last week made a suo motu statement on Lebanon in the Lok Sabha which did not refer to either of these demands. The statement issued by the CPM politburo today iterated the demands and said: The Bush administration has abetted Israel by preventing a ceasefire from being declared. It has encouraged Israel to carry on its blatant aggression by supplying lethal bombs and weapons.

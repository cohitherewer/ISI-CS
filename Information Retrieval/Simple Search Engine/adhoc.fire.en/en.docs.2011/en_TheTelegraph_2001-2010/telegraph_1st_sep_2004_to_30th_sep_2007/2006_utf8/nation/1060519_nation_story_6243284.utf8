 Quota solution group swells

 New Delhi, May 18: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh will not stay out of the deliberations by the Group of Ministers (GoM) on reservation for other backward class students.

 Sources said Singh, who had indicated yesterday that he would rather stay in the background, will hold consultations with GoM members to see how a solution can be hammered out to protect the interests of all sections.

 The government added two more names ? health minister Anbumani Ramadoss and agriculture minister Sharad Pawar ? to the GoM this morning. Defence minister Pranab Mukherjee, human resource development minister Arjun Singh and finance minister P. Chidambaram make up the rest of the group.

 Although both Manmohan and Congress president Sonia Gandhi are said to favour a middle path on Arjuns quota proposal ? politically no one dare oppose it ? the Prime Ministers handpicked members in the Knowledge Commission led by Sam Pitroda have voted 6-2 against it.

 The tug of war between pro- and anti-reservation lobbies continued through the day. Officials in the HRD ministry, however, said it was not possible to put a deadline to the bill to implement the 93rd Constitution amendment on reservation for educationally and socially backward classes. 

 Consultations have begun and there are several ticklish issues that have to be sorted out, they said.

 A team of six medical students met Mukherjee, minister without portfolio Oscar Fernandes and Ramadoss and submitted a set of demands. The ministers asked the students to end their strike and warned them that the tactic of intimidation would not work.

 The students urged the government to set up a non- political judiciary committee to study the desirability of quotas. They want an assurance from the Prime Minister that no injustice will be done to merit.

 Another meeting was held between the medical students and Fernandes at the AICC headquarters tonight on Sonias prompting ? the first sign of the Congress stepping into the storm.

 The medicos rejected the Centres proposal to increase the number of seats to offset the rise in quotas. The students, who are insisting on a complete rollback of quotas for OBCs, said the talks were inconclusive and have not failed. This means the two sides will resume the discussions.

 They said the strike would continue, though some state-run hospitals have served termination notices on resident doctors.

 The Centre offered to increase the number of seats in the general category in existing educational institutions but said the arrangement would not be applied to institutes that would be set up in the future. The proposal was not acceptable to the students as it was not uniform.

 A group of 30 OBC MPs from the BJP met a senior minister and said the government should not backtrack on the commitment made in the 93rd Constitution amendment.

 Mukherjee met Arjun, Pawar and Chidambaram. Pawar is backing the HRD minister to the hilt. The finance minister will play a crucial role as any solution would involve increasing the number of seats in medical colleges. 

 Arjuns ministry believes the real challenge lies in improving access to medical colleges, which have had a stunted growth as compared to the boom in engineering and management institutions.

 There are only 242 medical colleges and as many as 1,487 engineering colleges besides the seven IITs and 20 regional engineering colleges.

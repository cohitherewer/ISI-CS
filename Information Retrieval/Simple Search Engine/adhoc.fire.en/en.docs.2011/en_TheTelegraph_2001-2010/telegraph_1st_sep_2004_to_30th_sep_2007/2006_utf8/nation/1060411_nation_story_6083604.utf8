 B-school fire at hire tax

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Ahmedabad, April 10: Saying they are not hiring agencies, the Indian Institutes of Management today decided not to pay the service tax levied on campus placements.

 As placement offers ? which reached close to Rs 1 crore on IIM campuses this year ? continued to make headlines, the government had last month asked the B-schools to pay a 10.2 per cent tax on the money they make from the practice.

 At a meeting here today, all the six IIMs decided they wouldnt pay up.

 Our common view is that campus placement is an integral part of the education process, and we do not accept the governments classification that IIMs are manpower recruiting agencies, said Bakul Dholakia, director of the Ahmedabad institute.

 IIM Ahmedabad charges $5,000 (about Rs 2.23 lakh) per student from international recruiters as placement fee. Domestic companies pay Rs 40,000 to Rs 1.75 lakh depending on which day of the placements they are slotted, plus Rs 50,000 for each student they hire.

 The service tax applies only to the money collected from the domestic firms. 

 The seven-hour meeting discussed several other subjects, among them the proposed 27 per cent OBC quota that has been attacked by the faculty and management of all the B-schools.

 Dholakia, who had said the proposals merit was debatable, declined to reveal what the B-schools had decided. Until we get the communication from the ministry concerned, it will not be the right thing on our part to comment, he said.

 But some faculty members, on condition that they will not be named, were prepared to think aloud on how to beat the plan which, if implemented, will raise the overall reservation percentage to 49.5.

 One professor suggested that the three bigger IIMs ? Ahmedabad, Bangalore and Calcutta ? might tell the Centre they are not obliged to implement the quota as they do not take government grants.

 The 93rd Constitution Amendment Act, from which the quota plan draws its inspiration, however, allows reservation to be imposed even on wholly private, unaided institutions.

 One option is to raise the number of seats, faculty members felt, but to offset the impact of the quota would require something like a 54 per cent increase that the institutes are likely to shrink from.

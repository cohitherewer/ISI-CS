 Advani steps into protest

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 28: L.K. Advani today supported the quota protesters demand to set up a committee to evaluate the impact of reservations so far, bringing cheer in their camp.

 We need to examine the issue properly. A specialist committee should be set up to study the impact of reservations and examine alternative remedies for affirmative action which would not undermine merit or excellence, he said.

 The striking doctors welcomed Advanis statement ? the first sign of political support to the anti-quota stir. 

 The BJP has so far been playing footsie with the agitators. Party leaders Sushma Swaraj and Vijay Kumar Malhotra had visited the students as did Navjot Singh Sidhu but the party resolutely chanted a pro-quota line.

 Ahead of the BJPs crucial national executive meeting tomorrow, Advanis statement opens a Pandoras box. 

 The BJP cannot afford to take an anti-reservation stand. The party sends the largest number of OBC MPs to Parliament.

 According to the agitating doctors, Delhi state BJP president and former health minister Harsh Vardhan has promised them that there would be a detailed discussion on the quota issue in the national executive meeting tomorrow.

 Though the BJP cannot afford to oppose the governments decision on OBC reservations, Advanis statement indicates that the BJP would like to exploit the political situation emerging out of the doctors agitation.

 One should not forget that India today commands respect in the world not just because of its high growth rate, but also because it is established as a knowledge society. This has happened because of institutions where excellence is honoured, said Advani.

 His statement was a clear departure from the partys stand so far that it favours providing social justice to vulnerable sections. 

 We believe that in the existing system, reservation is an effective mechanism to tackle inequality, BJP general secretary Arun Jaitley had said on May 24. 

 Contrast this with what Advani said today: Merit and excellence should not be undermined while addressing the legitimate concerns of sections of society that have lagged behind for centuries.

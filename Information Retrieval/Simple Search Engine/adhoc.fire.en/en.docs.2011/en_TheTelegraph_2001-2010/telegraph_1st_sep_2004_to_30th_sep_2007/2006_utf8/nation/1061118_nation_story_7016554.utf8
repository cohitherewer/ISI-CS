 US business skirts Bengal

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Nov. 17: The ghost of Bengals labour unrest is refusing to fade away, though many in the Indian business community do not see it any more because of Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees drive to present a pro-industry image of the state. 

 Only three of the 200 members of a US business delegation the largest trade mission organised by the American government scheduled to visit Mumbai will come down to Calcutta in December.

 The reason: Bengals troubled past.

 In contrast, Delhi will host 20 companies and Bangalore 18. Representatives of six companies will go to Hyderabad and four to Chennai.

 The new principal commercial officer at the US consulate in Calcutta indicated that the other American companies were still not convinced about Calcutta as an investment destination.

 US companies pick up the bill for travel. Unlike many other countries, the US government does not subsidise it, said Alieen Crowe Nandi, the principal commercial officer, indicating that the trip to Calcutta was a pure business decision for the companies.

 Interacting at a Calcutta Chamber of Commerce meeting, Nandi admitted that her job would be to convince US companies about business opportunities in Bengal.

 She needs help in doing that and, by her own admission, Bhattacharjee continues to be the best bet. He was supposed to travel to the US during the fall. But it got postponed. It will be good if he goes to the US and interacts with companies there. That will be more effective than me speaking after all, Nandi said.

 Bhattacharjee did not, but Bengal chief secretary A.K. Deb and commerce secretary Sabyasachi Sen went to the US in June to showcase opportunities in the chemical and petrochemical industries, especially in the proposed special economic zone in Haldia. Their tour was believed to be a precursor to the chief ministers trip later in the year.

 Nandi was quick to add that the US was alive to Bengals changing investment climate. A mark of the growing importance of Calcutta: an early-December trip by deputy assistant secretary of the US department of commerce Colleen Litkenhaus, who would be here with a trade delegation.

 The US is the second largest foreign investor in the country, but Bengal has a negligible share in that. Very few US companies IBM, Cognizant and Pepsi among them have a presence in the state.

 All of them, as well as prospective investors, would keep a close watch on the December 14 strike called by the Left trade unions.

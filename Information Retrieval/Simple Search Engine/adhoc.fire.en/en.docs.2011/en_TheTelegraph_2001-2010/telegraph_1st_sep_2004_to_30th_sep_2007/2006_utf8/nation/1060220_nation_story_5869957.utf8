The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Ones poison, anothers meat

 New Delhi, Feb. 19 (Reuters): Poultry trader Mohammad Taqi is a sad man despite buying chickens at a discount of nearly 40 per cent.

 A day after bird flu was reported from Maharashtra, sales of chicken have collapsed in the capitals biggest wholesale poultry market and industry officials warn of lasting damage to the economy.

 I have bought 200 chickens today but I know I will not be able to sell them, Taqi said as he sat on an iron cage full of birds today. These are broiler chickens and nothing is wrong with them. Hopefully, everything will be normal in two or three days.

 He and thousands of such small traders throng the bustling Ghazipur poultry market which is next to the capitals biggest waste disposal ground.

 Vultures and eagles fly overhead. Chicken droppings and feathers are strewn all around and a nauseating stench envelopes the entire area.

 But some customers are happy. A live bird is now selling at Rs 25, just over half the Rs 40 it would have cost two days ago.

 I can enjoy a lavish lunch today. It is a Sunday and for once I can buy enough chicken because the prices are rock-bottom, said Nanku Ram, a labourer holding a huge bird.

 I have heard about bird flu on TV but I am not bothered. I want to enjoy the low prices.

 Policymakers say it is too early to assess any impact of the outbreak of bird flu on Indias economy but some analysts said foreign investment in Indian stocks could be hit in the short term.

 Investors are looking at India carefully and avian flu is a risk, said Abheek Barua, chief economist, ABN AMRO Bank.

 But Bharat Tandon, the chairman of Indias oldest livestock association, said anything happening to his industry would hurt the wider economy. India is the fifth largest producer of eggs in the world. Livestock and poultry is one of the fastest-growing sectors.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Viewers pleasure is channels pain 

CAS fee limit set at Rs 5 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 31: Viewers, go grab your remotes.

 Broadcast regulator Trais order today fixing a monthly rate for television channels under the conditional access system has come as good news for viewers, but it is bad news for broadcasters.

 When CAS comes into effect in a few months, viewers will pay no more than Rs 5 a month per channel, plus taxes to their cable operator.

 They would also have to pay rental and a security deposit for the set-top box needed to see pay-channels under the system, which gives a subscriber the freedom to choose the channel he wants.

 The deal is not too bad. If a subscriber wants to see 20 pay-channels and all free-to-air ones, he can expect to pay less than Rs 250 a month.

 Content providers and broadcast companies, including those transmitting from abroad, had opposed a maximum retail price. They said it would hinder them from spending money on better programmes.

 Pricing of channels is best left to market forces, the Singapore-based Motion Pictures Association had written to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India.

 Broadcast companies and associations were, however, reluctant to make any formal comment on the Trai order. The Indian Broadcasting Foundation was studying the issue.

 With the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal authorised to hear pleas against any decision or order by Trai, a legal challenge is not ruled out. After the tribunal decides, a regular court can also be approached.

 The broadcasters preferred selling bundles of their channels to cable operators, who in turn would transmit the channels to homes. Typically, a broadcast company would charge cable operators Rs 60 or 70 for its bouquet.

 The Trai order, however, mandates that broadcast companies must let the viewer choose individual channels and that they need not go for bouquets. In addition if they so wish broadcasters can sell channel-bundles at a discount.

 The order applies only to parts of Calcutta, Delhi and Mumbai where CAS will become mandatory by December 31. The system is already in force in Chennai.

 The order does not bar broadcasters from charging less than the ceiling Trai has set. But the ceiling for each pay channel is Rs 5, plus the 12.5 per cent service tax every month. 

 The bundle of free-to-air channels will cost Rs 77 plus tax in CAS areas. For this, a viewer does not need a set-top box. At present, there are 30 channels on the free-to-air list and they include many popular news and entertainment channels.

 Roop Sharma, who heads an all-India federation of cable operators, told The Telegraph they were pleased with the tariff order. Sharma said channels should have been priced at Rs 3 each.

 The order says households will have to stick with their choice of channels for at least four months. Broadcasters, in turn, will have to give a notice of one month if they want to remove or add channels to the free-to-air list. 

 Price regulation is justified when markets fail to produce competitive prices, Trai said.

 It said the subscriber has to pay for the set-top box and, therefore, should at least have a reasonable choice of programmes within affordable limits of the family budget.

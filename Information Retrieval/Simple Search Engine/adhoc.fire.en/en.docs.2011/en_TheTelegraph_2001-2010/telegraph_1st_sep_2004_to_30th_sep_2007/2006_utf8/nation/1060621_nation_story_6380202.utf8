 Study voucher on govt table

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 20: A strong lobby within the Planning Commission and the voluntary sector is rooting for a voucher system of directly funding students that would increase private role in primary and secondary education.

 The Planning Commissions approach paper for the Eleventh Plan says: There is a feeling that voucher schemes can help promote both equity and quality in schooling in areas where adequate private supply exists.

 Such a system will give parents an opportunity to pick a school of their choice for their children. At present, parents from low-income groups have no choice but to send children to government schools.

 The government now funds schools, which then offer education to the poor. 

 The voucher system will provide funds to the student who will then approach any of the schools. The voucher system makes schools accountable directly to students since they pay for the education through the vouchers, says Parth J. Shah of the Centre for Civil Society, an NGO. 

 The amount of money the government will spend on a student can vary between Rs 800 and Rs 1,300. If a student does not like a school, he or she can take the voucher to another school that has better standards.

 Private schools will, of course, have to agree to the system for it to succeed.

 The debate over a voucher system follows the persistent failure to improve levels of learning, stop teacher absenteeism and check dropout rates in government schools. 

 There is, however, a strong lobby against the system, which includes NCERT director Krishna Kumar. Educationists say this is the governments way of shrugging off its responsibility and paving the way for privatisation of education. 

 But those in favour of it say the resultant competition among schools would improve the quality of learning. Schools would offer a variety of services that students and parents value, Shah insists. 

 The voucher system is not intended to phase out government schools, its backers add.

 Tiwari quits 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 4: Narain Dutt Tiwari has resigned as Uttaranchal chief minister a year before the state goes to polls. But instead of handing in his papers to the governor, the Congress veteran faxed the resignation today to his party chief.

 Congress sources said if Sonia Gandhi accepts Tiwaris decision, he would meet the governor and formally quit.

 Tiwari, who was thrice Uttar Pradesh chief minister before Uttaranchal was carved out as well as a Union minister, told reporters in Dehra Dun he was too old to carry on. There is no person of my age serving as chief minister in the country, he said.

 Sources close to him said Tiwari, in his letter, cited his age ? he is 81 ? and his inability to lead the Congress to victory in the next elections.

 But insiders said he has been sulking for a while and did not attend the AICC plenary in January, reportedly to protest his exclusion from the Congress Working Committee. According to the partys norms, no serving chief minister is made a member of the committee but sources close to Tiwari said he was not being given the deference due to his age, seniority and loyalty to the Congress.

 The party sources said if his resignation is accepted, there are two main contenders for the chief ministers job: Indira Hridesh, parliamentary affairs, public works and information minister, and state Congress president and Rajya Sabha MP Harish Rawat. 

 While Indira is reportedly Tiwaris nominee, the sources said he would not push too hard if the high command is cold to the idea.

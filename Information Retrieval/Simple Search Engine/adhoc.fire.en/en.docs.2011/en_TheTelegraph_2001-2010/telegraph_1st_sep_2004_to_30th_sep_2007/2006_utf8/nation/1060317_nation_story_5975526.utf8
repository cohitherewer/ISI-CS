 Witness blow to Salman 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, March 16: Salman Khans former bodyguard today stood by his statement that the actor was drunk and driving the car himself when he ran over pavement dwellers in Bandra in 2002. 

 Ravindra Patil, a witness in the hit-and-run case, was arrested on March 11 following a non-bailable warrant against him. He had failed to appear in the metropolitan magistrates court four times.

 Today, the court asked him if his earlier statement had been recorded by the police using force. Patil said no. 

 Patil, a police constable, was suspended after an arrest warrant was issued. 

 The former bodyguard, who was with Salman (in picture above) during the mishap, had in his second statement to the police said the actor was driving the car and was drunk. He said he had repeatedly advised Salman not to drive. Today, he stood by this statement.

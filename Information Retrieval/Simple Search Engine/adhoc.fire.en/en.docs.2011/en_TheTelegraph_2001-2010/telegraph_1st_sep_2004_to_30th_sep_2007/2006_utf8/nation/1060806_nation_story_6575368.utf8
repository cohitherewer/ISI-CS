 Simi, Bangla rebels link via Bengal

 GYANANT SINGH

 New Delhi, Aug. 5: Bangladeshi fundamentalist leaders regularly attend meetings arranged by the Students Islamic Movement of India (Simi) in Bengal, the Centre has revealed.

 Justifying the ban on Simi imposed in February, the Centre has submitted before the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Tribunal that the organisation was using its pan-Islamic links to support anti-national and anti-social activities.

 Under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967, after banning any outfit, the government has to submit a reference to the tribunal that would determine whether there is sufficient cause for declaring an organisation unlawful.

 The Centre said leaders of the Jamait-e-Islami and the Islamic Chhatra Shibir of Bangladesh regularly attend Simi meetings in Bengal. 

 Information received from intelligence agencies has revealed that the Islamic Chhatra Shibir, which is the student wing of the Jamait, had used Simi to circulate objectionable CDs to influence young Muslims in the state, the government said.

 The agencies have also provided inputs to show that Simi has established links with the Lashkar-e-Toiba to carry out militant activities.

 In a written submission to the tribunal, the Centre said the ban had to be imposed for the third time because Simi did not refrain from its anti-national activities despite being declared unlawful in September 2001 and September 2003.

 It had kept its network alive by re-grouping and reviving the organisation through front organisations, the government said. 

 The Centre said Simi is supporting and receiving support in return from militant organisations like Al-Umma, Ganzim-Islahal Muslameen, Lashkar, Indian Muslim Mohammedi Mujahedin, Darsga-e-Shahadat and the Tehreek-e-Shaire-Islamia.

 It is also receiving moral and financial support from the World Assembly of Muslim Youth, Riyadh, International Islamic Federation of Students Organisations, Kuwait, and the Chicago-based Consultative Committee of Indian Muslims, the Centre said.

 The government said the organisation was found to be involved in at least six cases of anti-national activity across the country. 

 In some cases, the Centre said, it was seen that Simi was working along with the Lashkar, justifying the ban under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act.

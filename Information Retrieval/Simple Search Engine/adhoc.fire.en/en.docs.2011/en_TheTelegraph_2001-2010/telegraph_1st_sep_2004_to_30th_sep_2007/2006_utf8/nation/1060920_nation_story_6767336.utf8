 BJP sniffs Valley plot in deal

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 19: The BJP today alleged that unseen foreign powers had pushed Prime Minister Manmohan Singh towards issuing the joint statement with Pakistan in Havana.

 As for the joint mechanism on terrorism, the party suspected that it was the first step towards joint control of Jammu and Kashmir. We have great concerns about (the) deliberations in Havana, former foreign minister Yashwant Sinha declared.

 With uncharacteristic stridency, he added: Recent developments lead to a suspicion that the joint mechanism on terrorism is the beginning of the process of joint control of Jammu and Kashmir. The deliberations also lend to the inkling that India has acted under pressure. Are unseen powers pushing India towards the kind of solution of (the) Jammu and Kashmir issue that the country has rejected all along?

 Asked who the unseen powers are, Sinha said: We believe it is the US.

 He alleged the Centre had secretly been preparing the groundwork for such a mechanism and had sent a non-paper (unofficial proposal) to Pakistan that included suggested resolutions of the Kashmir dispute. 

 Though the government did not take Parliament and the people of India into confidence over its contents, we have learnt through Pakistani sources that it contains suggestions for joint control over J amp;K. We suspect that in the name of a joint mechanism, they are moving in that direction.

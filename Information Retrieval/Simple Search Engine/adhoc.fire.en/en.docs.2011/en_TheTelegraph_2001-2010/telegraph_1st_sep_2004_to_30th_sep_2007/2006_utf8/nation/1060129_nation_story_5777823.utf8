 Left moves to muzzle Iran vote

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 28: The Left parties have asked the government not to vote at the coming IAEA conference if there is no consensus on Irans controversial nuclear programme among member countries of the atomic watchdog.

 If there is a lack of consensus at the IAEA meeting, India should abstain from voting, they said in a letter to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. This is our considered opinion in line with the UPA governments commitment to pursue an independent foreign policy.

 The letter said there was profound disquiet within the international community ? especially Russia, China and the non-aligned nations ? and, instead of trying to resolve matters, the US was precipitating a referral to the UN Security Council.

 A principled Indian position calls for talks within the IAEA ambit. This will contribute towards averting an escalation of tensions that already exist in this area.

 It reminded Singh that the US efforts against Iran have disturbing parallels with the Iraq crisis when confrontation was eventually seized as pretext for making unilateral moves against Iraqs sovereignty and territorial integrity.

 The Left said discussions between Russia and Iran in Moscow on February 16 should be allowed to proceed.

 Calcutta, Feb. 2: The fashion fraternity was today up in arms over the 9/11 for designers at 1 MG Road in Delhi.

 A day after the countrys most prominent fashion address was razed to the ground by bulldozers of the Municipal Corporation of Delhi, the mood among the designer brigade was one of mourning.

 The sprawling glass and granite mall, housing around 50 top designer labels, and its relatively newer next-door neighbour were demolished on Wednesday and Thursday by the MCD, acting on a Delhi High Court order to target illegally constructed shopping complexes in the Lal Dora areas.

 Outlets in 1 MG Road had mostly been taken by the designers on rent.

 The MCD drive in the area continued today amid tight security as scores of showroom owners and staff protested, saying the buildings had been constructed before December 31, 2000, the cut-off period prescribed by the court for demolition.

 The designers are not just upset about the loss of their stores housed on the 1 MG Road mall, what has hit them harder is the governments apathy towards the industry.

 The behaviour of the MCD is more than just offensive. Keeping aside the illegal nature of the demolition, where there was no element of official notice, what is simply shocking is the attitude of the government to our industry. It shows no respect for the kind of efforts the designers have been putting in over the years to give the Indian fashion industry a place on the world map, said veteran designer Ritu Kumar. 

 Although she did not own a store in either of the malls, Kumar has decided to stand by her colleagues in their hour of crisis.

 Most designers, however, were able to save their merchandise. Luckily, we got the tip-off unofficially the evening before the demolition and, hence, we could largely remove our stocks. So, the financial losses have not been very high, said designer Raghavendra Rathore.

 But it is hardly any solace. This is not the kind of treatment that a bureaucracy metes out to its tenants when we are trying to portray the image of Incredible India to the world, Rathore fumed.

 He believes the move will make foreign fashion houses think twice about setting up shop here. It has virtually shaken the foundation of the Indian retail industry. In the long run, it will also detract the attention of the foreign companies that were planning to come to India. If our government cannot take good care of the home-bred designers, how can they be expected to respect foreign companies?

 Rina Dhaka, who had her outlet in 1 MG Road, echoed Rathore. We are feeling exactly the way a person would feel if ousted from ones own house. Most of us were lucky that we could remove our merchandise in time. But the treatment that the government has extended to us is simply shocking.

 Her colleague Leena Singh slammed the government for talking of getting more foreign fashion firms in the country when the future of the Indian fashion industry is itself at stake. 

 It is like killing ones own baby and adopting someone elses Singh said.

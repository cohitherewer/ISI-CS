 Eat all you want, but stay trim

 New Delhi, June 23: In what could be a leap forward in the war against obesity and diabetes, scientists today announced the discovery of a new biological way to burn body fat.

 A research team in the US has shown that mice genetically engineered to produce high levels of a protein called Tribbles3, or TRB3, remained lean despite feasting on fat-laden food.

 The mice were able to deal with a high-fat diet much better than normal mice, the scientists from the Salk Institute of Biological Sciences and colleagues from other institutions said, reporting their work in the journal Science.

 They stayed lean although they ate more, said Marc Montminy, the team leader.

 Fat-rich foods like red meat, fried items or sweets increase the risk of insulin resistance that can advance to type-2 diabetes. Most people with insulin resistance develop diabetes within 10 years unless they lose 5 to 7 per cent of body weight.

 The bodys ability to store fat is based on an enzyme called ACC. During fasting, the body burns up stored fat by chemically shutting down ACC. The research team has found that the TRB3 protein can also protect against diet-induced obesity by eliminating ACC.

 The 15-member team that reported the parallel pathway to get rid of stored fat included India-educated Rohit Kulkarni, now a scientist at the Joslin Diabetes Centre in Boston, whos been studying molecular links between obesity and type-2 diabetes.

 Previous studies had shown the amount of TRB3 in fat tissues rise during fasting when the ACC should be turned off. The researchers reasoned that increasing the TRB3 level during fasting and feeding would melt away fat deposits.

 Their laboratory experiments confirmed this premise. Mice genetically engineered to express elevated levels of the TRB3 protein in their fat tissues stayed 10 to 20 per cent skinnier than normal ones. Even when we put them on a high-fat diet, these mice just didnt gain weight, said Ling Qi, a researcher at the institute. 

 The discovery has triggered speculations about novel therapies to combat obesity. The high TRB3 levels protected the mice from diet-induced obesity by disrupting ACC activity and fatty acid destruction.

 AGPs big guns and Sonias Urdu on test

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Guwahati, April 9: Votes of the caste Assamese, minorities and the Bodos ? a tribal community which claims to be the original inhabitants of Assam ? will play a crucial role in the second phase of Assembly elections in the state.

 Spread over a dozen districts, the April 10 elections will see more stalwarts from the Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) in the fray than those from the Congress.

 Most of the Congress stars had slugged it out during the first phase on April 3, in which tea workers and tribals hogged the limelight.

 This phase will also cover the two trouble-torn districts of Karbi Anglong and North Cachar Hills, both managed by autonomous councils and inhabited chiefly by the Karbis and the Dimasas, respectively.

 Although both the councils are under the Congress, the Autonomous State Demand Committee ? which has split thrice ? wields a fair degree of influence in the two hill districts, among the most backward in the state.

 Among the big names in the fray is AGP president Brindaban Goswami, who is contesting from the Tezpur and Borcholla seats in Sonitpur district on the north bank of the Brahmaputra.

 Also in the picture is the partys former president and founder of the AGP (Progressive), Prafulla Kumar Mahanta, who is contesting from the Nagaon and Barhampur seats in Nagaon district of central Assam.

 Although most of the 61 seats have been strongholds of the AGP, the Congress had come to power in 2001 by capturing them with the help of minorities while retaining its traditional base in upper Assam, particularly in the tea belt.

 However, the Congress is not sure which way the minorities will go this time after the emergence of the Assam United Democratic Front (AUDF) ? formed with the sole agenda of ousting Sonia Gandhis party from power for its alleged betrayal of the communities. Like the tea workers, the minorities have traditionally been favourably disposed towards the Congress.

 In an effort to retain the minority flock, the Congress president turned to Urdu during an election campaign to say that her party aur akaliat ka purana samparkhai (The Congress and the minorities share an old relationship).

 April 10 will be a test of the minorities perception of the Congress after the emergence of the AUDF and the AGPs aggressive wooing of the community. The Congress unleashed an array of its Muslim leaders to campaign for the second phase.

 The imam of Delhis Jama Masjid, Sayeed Ahmed Bukhari, has said that the AUDF is a test case for Muslims all over the country. If it succeeds in Assam, the community across the country would emulate the idea of a political entity of its own.

 The districts going to polls being among the most backward in the state, development is an important issue. Mainly agrarian, these areas hardly enjoy the benefits that accrue from the two main economic sectors of the state ? tea and oil.

 The peoples woes are compounded by floods that wreak havoc every year.

 Comrade versus comrade over cop

 Achuthanandan

 Thiruvananthapuram, Dec. 10: Kerala chief minister V.S. Achuthanandan and his home minister Kodiyeri Balakrishnan are wrangling over whose writ should run in the state police department.

 It all started with inspector-general Rishiraj Singh, the anti-piracy cell chief, who raided a video shop here last week. 

 During the operation, Singh chanced upon information that Kochis Riyan Studio, owned by inspector-general Tomin Thachankarys wife Anita, was selling pirated copies of popular films.

 Singh, known as an honest man, took a team to Kochi to raid the studio. 

 But IG Thachankary ensured that the raiding team was stopped at the studio gates. He lobbied with director-general of police Raman Srivastava to intervene and fax a message relieving Singh of his anti-piracy cell responsibilities.

 Srivastava also reported to Balakrishnan that Singh, as a nodal officer, was not authorised to head the raid. But the state police chief was hauled up by Achuthanandan for giving the government a bad name. 

 Srivastava today handed over charge of the anti-piracy cell back to Singh, but the order was sent 48 hours after the chief minister had directed him to reinstate Singh.

 It is believed that the police chief had delayed the order on instructions from Balakrishnan, sending it only after the CPM central leadership intervened.

 Such an instance of a state police chief not heeding the chief ministers orders has never happened in Kerala.

 For now, it seems Achuthanandan and Balakrishnan have called a truce after two days of wrangling.

 Both were present at the inauguration of the Kerala House in Mumbai today and have vowed to straighten matters out after returning home.

 The bickering in the CPM, however, is expected to aggravate as Balakrishnan, backed by party state secretary Pinarayi Vijayans faction, will seek guarantees against Achuthanandans high-handedness.

 But the chief minister is unlikely to concede his moral authority to set right improprieties in matters of governance.

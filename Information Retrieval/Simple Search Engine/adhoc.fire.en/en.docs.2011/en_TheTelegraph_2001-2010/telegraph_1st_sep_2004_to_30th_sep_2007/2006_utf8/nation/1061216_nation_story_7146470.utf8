 Jampacked docks force navy to look West

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 15: The navy is scouting for shipyards in Europe and Russia where it can get seven stealth frigates built after concluding that Indian docks are choked and there is no space available to build its warships. 

 Of all the three armed forces, the navy gives more orders for its vessels and equipment to domestic industry. 

 Nearly 70 per cent of its new ships on order are being built by the Garden Reach Shipbuilders and Engineers (Calcutta) and the Mazgaon Docks (Mumbai). But both Garden Reach and Mazgaon have their hands full.

 Navy headquarters sources said requests for information (RFI) have been given to about 12 European and Russian shipyards. The order for the seven stealth frigates called Project 17A could be worth as much as Rs 30,000 crore over the next five to seven years.

 The navy is looking for technology transfer and co-development opportunity.

 The order has been bunched meaning the navy would want the ships to be built and delivered simultaneously because its fleet strength is depleting. 

 The depletion has been caused because few orders for new vessels were issued in the 1980s and the 1990s. The upshot is that older vessels are getting closer to their dates for decommissioning even before orders for new vessels can be issued.

 The navy is also considering if the order for the seven stealth frigates could be split. In that scenario, one ship would be built in a foreign shipyard and the other six at Mazgaon or Garden Reach. This would help cut costs. Project 17A is also called the Shivalik class of ships.

 In the original Project 17, 12 ships were to be built but financial constraints have delayed its implementation.

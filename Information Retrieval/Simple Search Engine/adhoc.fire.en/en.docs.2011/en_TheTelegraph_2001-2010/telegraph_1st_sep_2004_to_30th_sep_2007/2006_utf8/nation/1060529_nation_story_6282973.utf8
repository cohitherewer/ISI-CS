 Daydream tag on seat plan

 Gautam Gupta, brother of 23-year-old gutka vendor Rishi Raj who tried to set himself on fire during an anti-quota rally on Saturday, comes out of a Delhi hospital on Sunday. 

 Preliminary investigation has revealed that Rishi, who suffered over 35 per cent burns, was not part of the protest. 

 Police have questioned his father Subhash Chand Gupta, who denied Rishis interest in reservation politics pointing out that it did not affect anyone in the family. Gautam works in a call centre in Delhi.

 The police are trying to find out if Rishi received money to immolate himself or was set on fire to create panic.

 New Delhi, May 28: Medical teachers today described as daydreaming the Centres plans to increase seats in the medical institutes it runs by the next academic session.

 Top faculty members warned that the effort would be hobbled by a critical shortage of high-calibre medical teachers and a lack of infrastructure.

 The health ministry has asked central medical colleges to consider raising the intake of students by 50 to 60 per cent to ensure that general category seats do not shrink when the 27 per cent Other Backward Classes quota comes into effect next year.

 Theyre daydreaming if they think this can be done in all these colleges within a year, said Vinod Patro, the president of the resident doctors association of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences.

 The institute is expected to raise the number of seats in its undergraduate MBBS course from 50 to 90, while Vardhaman Mahavir Medical College will add 54 seats to the existing 100.

 AIIMS and Vardhaman sources said both institutions have the requisite faculty strength and patient load to raise student intake in a year, but other hospitals might need to recruit teachers and add physical infrastructure.

 The Medical Council of India, which oversees medical education in the country, has clear-cut rules on the student-to-faculty ratio, bed-to-student ratio and bed occupancy rates in medical colleges.

 Its not just a question of adding some chairs in lecture theatres, said Binod Khaitan, an associate professor at AIIMS. Medical training has a number of qualitative but crucial components that are important to maintain quality ? providing enough time to individual students for hands-on clinical training and spending adequate time in assessing students, he said.

 These are genuine concerns, said M.S. Valiathan, a senior doctor and national research professor at the Manipal Academy of Higher Education, Manipal.

 There is a terrible shortage of faculty in pre-clinical subjects such as anatomy, biochemistry and physiology. There is also a shortage of high-calibre faculty for medicine because theyve been moving to private hospitals, Valiathan said. Its a good idea to expand seats. But well need human resources to match this expansion.

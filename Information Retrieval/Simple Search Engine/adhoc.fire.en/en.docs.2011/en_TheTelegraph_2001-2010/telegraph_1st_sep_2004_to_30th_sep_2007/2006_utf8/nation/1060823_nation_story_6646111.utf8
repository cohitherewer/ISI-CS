 An accident, says big shot

 JOHN MARY

 Thiruvananthapuram, Aug. 22: The big shot accused of molesting a co-passenger on a Chennai-Kochi flight appeared in public today, claiming that a casual bodily contact was being blown out of proportion by his rivals to tarnish his image.

 Public works minister P.J. Joseph, 65, and a father of four, admitted he was seated behind a woman on the flight on August 3. His hand was gripping the front seat as the plane took off.

 The woman must have leaned to the side as the plane turned and climbed, accidentally touching my fingers. But how could a person stand up to complain, with the seatbelt on? he asked, referring to her account that she had stood up to protest.

 The purported victims husband sharply reacted to the inane explanations, saying the minister who misbehaved with my wife on the Kingfisher flight was telling a pure lie.

 Joseph met chief minister V.S. Achuthanandan this morning and later told reporters he wanted a senior woman IPS officer to probe the incident. He accused people whom he had thrown out of the party and the rival candidate he defeated in the last election of hatching a conspiracy against him.

 Many young women officers had worked with me. Ive been active in arts and cultural organisations, moved with young artistes. No one has ever had any complaint, said the minister, once a choir leader at his parish church near Kottayam.

 The womans husband, a chartered accountant in Chennai, said: We stand by every word in our petition. Co-passengers must have seen the commotion.

 The chief minister consulted leaders in the Left Democratic Front as the Opposition demanded a probe. 

 The Chennai-based Federation of Malayalee Associations also faxed him a petition seeking a probe as the woman, a former Surya TV newsreader, is a member of an affiliate outfit.

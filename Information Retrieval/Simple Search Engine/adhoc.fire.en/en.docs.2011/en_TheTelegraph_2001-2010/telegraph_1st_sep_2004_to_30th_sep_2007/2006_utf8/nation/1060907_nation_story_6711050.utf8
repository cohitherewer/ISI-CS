 Secular plea on pilgrimage

 Lucknow, Sept. 6 (PTI): The Centre has moved the Lucknow bench of Allahabad High Court to lift the stay on granting subsidy to pilgrims of any community, saying the bar could jeopardise the Haj pilgrimage and the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra. 

 The court had on August 25 restrained the Centre and the Uttar Pradesh government from providing any subsidy for pilgrimages till further orders.

 The Centres application, expected to come up before the court tomorrow, said the procedures for this years Haj have started already. 

 An agreement has been signed with Saudi Arabia for sending 1.47 lakh pilgrims and Air-India invited bids for leasing aircraft to accommodate the pilgrims, the application said.

 The Centre said the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra, organised in 16 groups of 60 people each, would be affected by the stay as some pilgrims have already left.

 The petition against the subsidies provided to pilgrims was political and could not be treated as a PIL, the Centre said. 

 In a policy decision made in the mid-nineties, the government had decided to subsidise air charter operations to transport Haj pilgrims. 

 This policy did not affect the principles of secularism envisaged in the Constitution in any way and enhances the feeling of secularism, the Centre said.

 Its affidavit also contended that Indian Muslims who go on Haj promote goodwill and international understanding. 

 The Uttar Pradesh government said it was providing facilities and assistance to pilgrims of all religions. 

 Umrah visa rule

 Concerned over the problem of overstaying by many Umrah pilgrims, Saudi Arabia has imposed new visa regulations.

 Visa will not be issued to individuals under 40 years of age who come alone from India, Pakistan, Egypt and other countries. However, those below 40 can go with their families or with organised legal groups.

 The decision was taken after a large number of pilgrims were found to have overstayed after performing Umrah.

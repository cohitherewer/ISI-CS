 Terror tales, from up close 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Guru Kay with his book

 New Delhi, Jan. 31: What does an army officer posted in Jammu and Kashmir do in between guard-duty and counter-insurgency raids? Write a juicy potboiler of a book, for instance, some of whose characters are loosely modelled on militants and others, scandalously, on brother officers and their mistresses.

 A serving officers potboiler of a book that wargames a terrorist attack into a plot laced with sex, drugs and betrayal has currently become a favourite among the top brass of the Indian military at army headquarters in South Block.

 Usually reticent about giving serving officers permission to go public and advertise aspects of the military ? unless they are exceptional like Olympic silver medallist Lt Colonel Rajyavardhan Rathore ? the top brass has nonetheless allowed a serving officer in army headquarters who goes by the pseudonym Guru Kay to stake his claim as a writer of pulp fiction.

 In real life, Guru Kay is Lt Colonel Manveet Singh. A law officer with the judge advocate generals branch ? the wing of the army that administers its system of military justice. Needless to say, the author brings to play his ample experience with some of the sleaze that end up as cases before army headquarters.

 Such a dose of liberalism shortly after the defence establishment was asked to vet the Aamir Khan starrer Rang De Basanti ? allegedly because it cast the Indian Air Force in poor light ? is still quite novel in the military. 

 As books go, one of the most popular doing the rounds in army headquarters is by Lt General Raj Kadyan, who after retiring as deputy chief of army staff, penned an account of how his colleagues conspired to deny him promotion even though, he claims, he was one of the ablest officers.

 But Guru Kays just published book is an entirely fictional account. Partly inspired by the Chrar-e-Sharief burning during counter-insurgency operations about a decade ago and partly by a militant jailbreak, Dubious Tactics: Missions of Hate narrates the story of a zealot who masterminds two simultaneous terrorist attacks in Kashmir and in the Northeast. 

 It (the plot) just grabbed me, says Singh who was brought up in Shillong and wrote the book even as he was serving in Kashmir.

 and was posted away from his family for two years. He was posted to headquarters last year. Its pure fiction and I really am not trying to get into anything else. Im now planning to sell television rights.

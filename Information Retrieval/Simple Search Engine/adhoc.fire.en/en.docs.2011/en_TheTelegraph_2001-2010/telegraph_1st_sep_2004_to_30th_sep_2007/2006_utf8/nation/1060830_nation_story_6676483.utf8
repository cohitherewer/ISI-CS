 New Delhi, Aug. 29: The Centre is all set to deploy unmanned aerial vehicles in vast stretches of Dantewada and Bastar in Chhattisgarh to tackle the Maoist menace.

 The Union home ministry has already spoken to the Indian Air Force, which has agreed to supply the UAVs that will be deployed in specific areas in consultation with the state government.

 These UAVs will only be used for intelligence purposes to know the positions of Naxalite hideouts and do not amount to giving armed assistance to the state in any way, a senior home ministry official said, ahead of tomorrows coordination centre meeting with affected states.

 The meeting comes in the backdrop of growing Maoist attacks across the country. Over 500 police stations in 11 states reported Naxalite violence last year.

 The affected states include Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Orissa, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Uttaranchal and Uttar Pradesh.

 Sources said the home ministry has come up with a two-pronged strategy to deal with the rebels. They said while the ministry is ready to set up a dedicated anti-Naxalite wing, it would form an inter-ministerial committee to focus on developing the affected states.

 The committee, under the special secretary (home), will have representatives from the Planning Commission, the ministries of tribal affairs, panchayati raj, rural development and agriculture, besides representatives of states affected by the Maoist menace.

 The committee will meet at least once every quarter, preferably before the meeting of the coordination centre, which is headed by the home secretary.

 As the coordination committee hardly finds the time to take up development issues, the home ministry wants to solve the problem through a presentation given by the special secretary on behalf of the affected states.

 The basic idea behind an inter-ministerial committee is to give equal importance to development issues and to have comprehensive involvement of all the stake-holders in the development of Naxalite-affected areas. The committee will also be able to produce an authentic report card on development done by each state, the home ministry official said.

 Officials said the anti-Naxalite wing, which would deal with both security and development issues, will be operational by next month. It will be headed by an additional secretary and include a joint secretary and four deputy secretaries.

 While the additional secretary will be required to travel extensively in Naxalite-affected states to get a clear idea of the situation on the ground, the joint secretary will work out development and internal security issues with the help of the deputy secretaries, the home ministry official said.

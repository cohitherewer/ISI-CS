 Doctors sacked in Malaysia

 Kuala Lumpur (PTI): Malaysia has terminated the contracts of over 100 expatriate doctors, including 20 Indians, and put on hold fresh recruitments, citing incompetence and poor language proficiency as the main reasons behind the move.

 Many of them faced problems such as language barri-ers.? Their contracts were also terminated due to poor performance or other reasons like tardiness, being irresponsible when called to come for duty after on-call hours, not adhering to their rostered schedules and not having sufficient expertise, health minister Chua Soi Lek said on Tuesday.

 The services of 118 such doctors were terminated between 2003 and June 2006. Besides Indians, 43 were from Pakistan, 36 from Egypt and the rest from other nations.

 Though the ministry is entitled to hire another 600, it is not going to do so, Lek said, adding that 698 expatriate doctors were still serving across the country. However, Malaysia is not planning to freeze its in-take, he said. 

 House relief to Pramod kin

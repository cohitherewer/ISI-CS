 Vijayshanti flirts with TRS, for Telengana

 Vijayshanti: War cry

 Hyderabad, July 22: Lady Amitabh Bachchan is ready to do anything for Telengana, even swap political loyalties.

 Last year, Vijayshanti had walked out of the BJP claiming it was interested only in playing politics with Telengana, not in bettering the lot of the people.

 Last Sunday, while launching her party ? Telengana Talli ? she said she was ready to brush shoulders with the Telengana Rashtra Samiti, provided it split with the deceptive Congress.

 Political circles here were stunned when the actress, dressed in an orange sari, participated in a festival at the Secunderabad Kali temple along with TRS leader and Union minister A. Narendra.

 Although she lashed out at the BJP ? it is using the Telengana issue as a political opportunity ? she was firm she was not ready to join any political party yet.

 For the time being, she would strive for the development of Telengana, she said, but if the TRS seriously fights for Telengana, I will extend all support to them.

 She said she was uneasy about the way the TRS was aimlessly drifting in politics. It is time they decide whether to continue with the deceptive Congress or not. They should come out and wage a full-fledged movement.

 The party should work for Telengana without any ambition for power and posts, she added.

 TRS leaders should not accept the crumbs of re-induction into the state cabinet in the expansion scheduled later in August.

 Vijayshanti had got rave reviews for her performance in Pratighatana (a film on corruption) and Osai Ramulamma, which espoused the cause of Telengana. But she burnt her fingers when she got into film production.

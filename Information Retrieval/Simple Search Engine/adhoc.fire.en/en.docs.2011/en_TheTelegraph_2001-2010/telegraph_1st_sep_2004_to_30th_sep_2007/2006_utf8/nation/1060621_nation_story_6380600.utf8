 Panchayat poll blow

 Hyderabad, June 20: The ruling Congress suffered a blow today with Andhra Pradesh High Court quashing the notification for panchayat polls, reports our special correspondent.

 Responding to a batch of petitions, the one-man bench headed by Justice P.S. Narayana held that the notification issued by the state election commission was illegal, arbitrary and discriminatory. 

 It appeared that the state election commission had abdicated its constitutional rights and acted on the dictates of government and made a mockery of its autonomous status.

 The polls are scheduled for June 28 and July 2.

 The notification violated Articles 4, 11, 12 and 201 of the Constitution, the court said, directing the commission to conduct polls only after a revision of voters lists by competent authorities.

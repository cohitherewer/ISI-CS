 Safety advice to students in Russia

 Moscow, Oct. 11 (PTI): The Indian embassy here has advised students to be vigilant and take due precautions for their personal security amid growing racial attacks against non-white foreigners in Russia. 

 Indian students in Russia are strongly advised to take adequate precautions themselves for their personal security, particularly during all their outdoor movements, the embassy said in an advisory posted on its website. There can be no substitute for remaining very vigilant and exercising due caution and prudence in ones movements, it added.

 The advisory comes in the wake of the murder of a medical student from Bihar in Russias second largest city of St Petersburg last month, sparking angry protests.

 Nitesh Kumar Singh, a sixth-year student from the Mechnikov Medical Academy in St Petersburg, was fatally stabbed by a group of eight masked persons in front of his hostel building on September 24.

 The embassy said Indian diplomatic missions in Moscow and St Petersburg have strongly taken up the issue of security of Indian students with the Russian authorities.

 The Indian missions said the authorities have promised to take action against the attackers and assured improved security for the foreign students.

 The problem of attacks on non-white foreign students would require a more comprehensive approach by the Russian authorities, the advisory said.

 There have been several incidents of attacks on Indian and other foreign students in different parts of Russia by extremist groups.

 In April, another Indian, Kishore Kumar Anjangi, a fifth-year student from the same medical institution, was also attacked in the same area, but survived.

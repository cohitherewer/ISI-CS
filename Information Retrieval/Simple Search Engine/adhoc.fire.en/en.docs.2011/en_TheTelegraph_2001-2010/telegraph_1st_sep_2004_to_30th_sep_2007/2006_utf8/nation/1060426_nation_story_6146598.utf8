 Profit list

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 25: Union ministers Pranab Mukherjee, Sharad Pawar, Meira Kumar and T. Subbirami Reddy as well as chief ministers of several states figure on the list of legislators whose disqualification has been sought on the ground that they hold offices of profit.

 The Election Commission today put on its website names of 43 MPs and 215 MLAs complaints against whom have been referred to President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam and governors of various states. 

 The names of Congress president Sonia Gandhi and industrialist Anil Ambani also figure on the list, but the two have since resigned from Parliament. The office of profit controversy broke last month after Rajya Sabha MP Jaya Bachchan was disqualified.

 The complaint against Sonia, who is seeking re-election to the Lok Sabha from Rae Bareli, was declared infructuous by the commission after her resignation. She has stepped down from all government organisations that she was heading.

 Other prominent MPs against whom complaints have been made include Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee, Karan Singh, Najma Heptullah, Ajit Singh, V.K. Malhotra, Amar Singh, Sajjan Kumar, Anuradha Chowdhury, N. Jothi and Naveen Jindal.

 Of the 215 MLAs, six are chief ministers ? of Punjab, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa, Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. Several ministers also figure on the list.

 The Election Commission decided to make the names public following a complaint by a Delhi doctor who accused it of violating the Right to Information Act. 

 The poll panel today issued a notice to Rashtriya Lok Dal MP Anuradha Choudhary for allegedly holding an office of profit. She has been given three weeks to reply.

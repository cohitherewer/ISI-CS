 Govt in fragging healing touch

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 10: Worried over the mounting toll from soldier suicides and fragging, defence minister A.K. Antony has asked army headquarters to rope in district administrations to iron out personal problems of soldiers.

 The army headquarters has been told that the district soldiers boards (Zilla Sainik Parishads) must involve district authorities such as the police urgently as soon as a soldier reports that he is facing problems over disputes in his village/household even as he is manning the borders or going after militants in counter-insurgency operations.

 The orders come after the army reported that the incidents that were taking a toll on the morale of the force were provoked by personal problems that the soldiers encountered at home when they were on leave. The army headquarters is also considering a proposal to allow soldiers in counter-insurgency areas to go on leave more often.

 The vice-chief of army staff, Lt General S. Pattabhiraman, said here today that the Defence Institute of Psychological Research (DIPR) will do a detailed study on causes leading to stress. 

 In earlier studies, the DIPR has pointed out a number of factors, some of which are socio-cultural. In one study, for example, it has been noted that units with soldiers recruited from certain northern states had recorded a higher incidence of frustration manifested in violent outbursts.

 Two important causes were identified. First, economic. Soldiers who come mostly from farm households and were away from home for long often returned to find that their land holdings had been fragmented and/or they were left with uneconomical plots. Second, the treatment of women in the households of the soldiers. Soldiers wives were exploited sometimes by relatives and this resulted in tension within the family.

 The defence ministers (in picture) order to ask the parishads to establish a communication channel with administrations comes against this backdrop. In the event of a soldier reporting injustice, the boards would urge the administration to intervene and sort out disputes.

 More soldiers have been killed by suicides and fragging the Americanism for soldiers killing colleagues this year than by militants in Jammu and Kashmir or the Northeast. Till October, 55 soldiers were killed during counter-insurgency operations. 

 In eight months till August, however, 86 soldiers committed suicide and two were killed by colleagues. Then came the spurt in October when 10 soldier suicides and fragging incidents were reported. The army chief, General J.J. Singh, said at a press conference in Srinagar last week that nearly 100 soldier suicides were reported in a year.

 The order from the defence minister comes after the army reported that most incidents of suicide and fragging resulted from disputes over leave.

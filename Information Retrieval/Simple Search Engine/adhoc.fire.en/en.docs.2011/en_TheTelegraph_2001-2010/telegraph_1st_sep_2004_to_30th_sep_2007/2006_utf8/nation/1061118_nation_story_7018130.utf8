 New Delhi, Nov. 17: Munnabhai has left his mark even on the Prime Minister, who mentioned Lage Raho Munnabhai today while elaborating on his plans to combat corruption.

 At a conference of the CBI and state anti-corruption bureaus, Manmohan Singh mentioned the blockbuster while telling senior policemen how deeply disturbed he is about corruption in every government department.

 When I recently watched the popular Hindi movie Lage Raho Munnabhai, the one incident that touched me most was the ordeal of a senior citizen trying to get his pension without having to pay a bribe, Singh said.

 In stripping his clothes as an act of protest, this pensioner was stripping our system, exposing the ugly nakedness of self-aggrandisement of those who man our institutions of governance.

 The Prime Minister said any system that required a pensioner to pay a bribe to secure his legitimate dues is most despicable. 

 Such corruption must be visited by the sternest action to reform, restructure and rejuvenate the system. The very legitimacy of the state and its various institutions is brought into question by such illegal exercise of power and authority, Singh said. 

 To deal with what he dubbed was cancer for the state and society, the Prime Minister laid out a seven-point strategy to combat corruption. He said the government intended to bring a public services bill in Parliament to define a code of ethics and management in public services. 

 The bill, he said, would also protect whistleblowers.

 He elaborated the points as:

 An integrated approach where investigating agencies should not operate in isolation. Each agency should develop resources to take a broader view of individual cases

 Eliminate all discretionary controls and minimise the scope for discretion in the control and regulatory systems we cannot dispense with

 Reform the tax system, make it simple and transparent and ensure moderate rates of taxation that enable widest possible compliance

 Modernise the justice delivery system to ensure prompt action against corruption even within the judiciary, at all levels

 Reform public procurement systems, in civil and defence, with complete transparency in tendering processes

 Effective utilisation of the Right to Information Act so that it acts as a deterrent and empowers citizens to bring to light acts of corruption. There should be a citizens charter that states explicitly the rights of taxpayers and consumers of public services

 Decentralise administration and the justice delivery system.

 Iran gas talks later this month

 IMTIAZ GUL

 Islamabad, May 12: Indian, Pakistani and Iranian officials will meet in Islamabad from May 22 to 24 to discuss technical aspects of the mega gas pipeline project.

 The meeting of the joint working group on the 2,670-km Iran, Pakistan and India gas pipeline project will be followed by minister-level talks between the three countries in Tehran next month.

 The issue of pricing mechanism and volumes envisaged for supplies through the $7.01-billion pipeline was discussed last month during talks between Pakistan and Iran.

 Refusing to succumb to any US pressure, Pakistani and Iranian officials had reiterated their intention to press ahead with the project. The US has been opposing the project on the pretext that Iran is developing nuclear weapons.

 Pakistans petroleum secretary Ahmad Waqar claimed his country was close to striking a deal with Iran on the project. The three countries have already made progress on the pricing of gas, structure of pipeline and the feasibility of the project.

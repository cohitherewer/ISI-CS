 Amar counts 44, EC 2

 DHIRENDRA K. JHA

 New Delhi, March 23: The confusion is not only about which posts are offices of profit but also about how many MPs hold them.

 The number is at least 44, if Amar Singh is to be believed. But there is no independent confirmation, with the Election Commission saying it has received only two complaints.

 The Samajwadi Party general secretary made his claim the day party MP Jaya Bachchan was disqualified from the Rajya Sabha for holding an office of profit.

 Amar, himself facing the same charge, claimed President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam had received 44 similar complaints and had forwarded some to the poll panel. He demanded all the names be made public.

 Yesterday, after a Samajwadi team met the President, Singh compounded the confusion by claiming Kalam had forwarded all the complaints ? including one against Sonia Gandhi ? to the poll commission.

 While Rashtrapati Bhavan has been tight-lipped, chief election commissioner B.B. Tandon told reporters in Guwahati that he hadnt received any complaint against Sonia.

 Though the number of accused MPs isnt clear, several big names have been revealed. Prominent among them are the BJPs V.K. Malhotra, CPMs Somnath Chatterjee and Amar himself.

 The Telugu Desam Party has submitted to the President a list of four Congress MPs ? Sonia, Karan Singh (head of Indian Council of Cultural Relations), T. Subbirami Reddy (chairman, Tirupati Tirumala Devasthanam) and Kapila Vatsyayan (head of the Indira Gandhi National Centre for Art).

 The Trinamul Congress has sent to Kalam a list of 10 Left MPs. One of them, Nilotpal Basu, who heads the West Bengal Gramin Sanchay Society, is set to retire from the Rajya Sabha on April 2.

 The poll panel says both the complaints it has received are against Samajwadi leaders. Jaya Bachchan has been disqualified and Amar ? chairman of the UP Industrial Development Council ? has been asked to reply by March 31.

 The commission has also acknowledged receiving complaints against 12 MLAs of Himachal Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh minister Azam Khan, forwarded by the two states governors. 

 Khan, chairman of the UP Jal Nigam, is also from the Samajwadi Party.

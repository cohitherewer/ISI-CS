 Mumbai, June 13: Afroze Shahid Khan Pathan, a resident of Majalgaon in Beed district, was arrested today after he surrendered in connection with the Aurangabad arms seizure case, reports our special correspondent.

 Pathan had travelled to Bangladesh for training in subversive activities and was in direct contact with prime accused Zahibuddin Ansari, a suspected Lashkar-e-Toiba operative, police said. 

Pathan was scheduled to travel abroad when the squad

 Teachers face parents threat

 RABI BANERJEE

 Krishnagar, July 9: The headmistress and all 15 teachers of a primary school here in Bengals Nadia district have sought transfers after being threatened by guardians who wanted their daughters to be admitted to Class I. 

 The district authorities had earlier ordered that primary schools would have to first take students from their own municipal wards or panchayat areas. If there were spare seats still, students from other areas could be accommodated. 

 Lady Carmichael School, about 85 km from Calcutta, enrolled about 90 local students in May. The competition for the remaining 30 seats got hot after it decided to admit these students on a first-come-first- serve basis. 

 Guardians of 70 applicants refused to accept the norm and demanded that their daughters be admitted because they studied in the schools pre-primary section, though the school had made it clear that no such privilege would be granted to them.

 On Friday evening, some of the guardians barged into the house of headmistress Sumitra Samadder, hurled abuses and demanded that their daughters be admitted. 

 When she refused, they pelted her house with stones. Samadder, who is on leave for the past few days for being unwell, said: They abused me and my retired husband. I repeatedly told them that I was only following rules but they smashed my door and windowpanes. 

 Nadia primary school council chairman Bibhash Biswas, who called police hearing about the incident at Samadders, said her colleagues were threatened over the phone.

 Yesterday, the headmis- tress and all 15 teachers of the school sought transfers. We have decided to grant their pleas, he said. 

 The inspector-in-charge of the Kotwali police station, Dibyendu Banerjee, said: We have initiated a case and investigation is on.

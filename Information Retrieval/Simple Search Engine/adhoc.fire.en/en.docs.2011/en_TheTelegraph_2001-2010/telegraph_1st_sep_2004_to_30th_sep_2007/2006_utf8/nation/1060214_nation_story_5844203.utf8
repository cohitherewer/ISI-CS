 40 pilots still sick

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 13: More than 40 Air Sahara pilots called in sick for the second day running, leading to the cancellation of at least 12 flights.

 The pilots are demanding pay and seniority on a par with their Jet Airways counterparts in a merged airline that is taking shape.

 Jet had last month announced the acquisition of Air Sahara for about Rs 2,300 crore. 

 The pilots, unhappy with the sale from the beginning, had formed a welfare association, which discussed future pay and allowances with the management.

 They held talks again today, but sources said no agreement was reached. 

 According to officials, the pilots simply reported sick on a mass scale instead of giving a proper notice. Legal action may be taken against them if the deal with Jet does not peter out, they added. 

 Yesterday, sources had said Jet and Sahara might ask the government to step in if the stalemate continued.

 Sahara today combined some flights with Jet and pressed into service executive pilots who are in managerial positions.

 The Lucknow-based airline ? the third-largest in India ? was hit by the strike yesterday when 20 flights were grounded, triggering chaos in airports across the country.

 Unconfirmed reports said Air Sahara counters have stopped reservations for certain sectors.

 Passengers on cancelled flights were accommodated in Jet and Indian Airlines (now named Indian), Sahara officials said. 

 The Jet-Sahara merger, which is expected to take place in a couple of months after regulatory approvals, will create a mega airline with some 77 aircraft and a huge market share.

 Smaller airlines have been lobbying against the deal as they fear the new entity would monopolise the domestic aviation sector. They say that in the lucrative metro sectors ? for instance, the Delhi-Mumbai route that accounts for nearly 50 per cent of total domestic air traffic ? the Jet-Sahara combine would take up 85 per cent of all flights.

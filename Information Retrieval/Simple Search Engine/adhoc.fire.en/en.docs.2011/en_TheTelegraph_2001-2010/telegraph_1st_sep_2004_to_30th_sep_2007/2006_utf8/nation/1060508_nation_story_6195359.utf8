 Damages for LPG blast

 New Delhi, May 7 (PTI): A city consumer court has asked Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited and Bharat Gas Service to pay Rs 5.5 lakh as compensation for supplying a faulty cooking gas cylinder which exploded at a marriage function, killing two persons and injuring a girl.

 The gas cylinder manufactured by the BPCL was defective and was supplied by its dealer BGS without ensuring that it was in a perfect condition and thus they are guilty of deficiency in service, said the Delhi state consumer disputes redressal commission.

 Terming the incident most unfortunate and spine-shivering, which turned the occasion of happiness into gory macabre tragedy, the commission headed by Justice J.D. Kapoor and member Rumnita Mittal asked the two government-owned companies to pay up within a month.

 The order came following three complaints filed by LPG consumer Dharam Pal, Ashok and a minor girl Preeti, who lost an ear in the fire which broke out at Pals house.

 According to the complaints, on the morning of February 16, 1999, Pals relatives had gathered at his Jahangirpuri residence in northwest Delhi to take part in a ceremony before his sister-in-laws marriage.

 As soon as the seal of the LPG cylinder was opened, it caught fire and exploded, killing Pals wife and Ashoks daughter. 

 Preeti survived with serious injuries. The fire also destroyed Pals household goods.

 Holding both companies guilty of supplying the defective cylinder, the commission asked BPCL to pay a compensation of Rs 2 lakh each to Pal and Ashok and awarded Rs 1 lakh to Preeti.

 The BGS was asked to pay Rs 50,000 to the LPG cylinder holder.

 The commission rejected the contention of the companies that the incident took place due to the negligence of Pal.

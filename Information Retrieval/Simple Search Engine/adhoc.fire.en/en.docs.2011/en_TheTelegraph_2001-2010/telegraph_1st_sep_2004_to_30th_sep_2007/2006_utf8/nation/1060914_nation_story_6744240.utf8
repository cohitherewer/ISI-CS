 Suspense on eve of Ranchi vote

 OUR BUREAU

 Ranchi, Sept. 13: A day before the trial of strength to decide the fate of the Arjun Munda government, Speaker Inder Singh Namdhari added to the suspense by reserving his ruling on petitions seeking the disqualification of three legislators, two of them former ministers who switched sides.

 In separate slots, the Speaker heard lawyers of both sides and reserved his ruling. Supreme Court lawyer R.K. Jain put up the defence for the two former ministers, Anosh Ekka and Kamlesh Singh, while S.B. Garodia appeared on behalf of Independent MLA Stephen Marandi. 

 Garodia, who till recently was arguing for immediate disqualification of Ekka on a petition preferred by Jharkhand Party president N.E. Horo, was today at pains to seek more time.

 The Speaker pulled up the lawyers on several occasions and pointed out that they were pleading for more time instead of concentrating on the gravity of the situation. Are you defending your clients or are you here to prosecute me? Namdhari asked. 

 There was a flutter when the UPA paraded only 37 MLAs at the New Delhi residence of railway minister Lalu Prasad. Joba Manjhi and Bhanu Pratap Sahi, two MLAs on whom the NDA is still pinning hope, were absent. 

 Later it was learnt that Manjhi took the flight with other UPA legislators and got down from the bus at the hotel in Ranchi.

 New Delhi, June 10: Opposition parties have slammed as political fraud the decision of Congress-ruled state governments not to levy sales tax on the increase in oil prices.

 The BJP, virtually ruling out that the states where it is in power would follow suit, accused the Congress of trying to divert attention from the real issue of high taxation? in the form of excise.

 Party spokesperson Prakash Javadekar said: We have the highest taxation in the world and the government is doing nothing.

 The Centre, he said, should first reduce the tax burden, then only will it have the moral right to call all the chief ministers and finance ministers for a conference to arrive at a uniform sales tax. Such isolated reduction is no solution. 

 After Maharashtra, some other Congress-ruled states today decided not to levy sales tax on the Rs 4 increase in the price of petrol and Rs 2 in that of diesel.

 The Samajwadi Party, the Janata Dal (United) and the Janata Dal (Secular) ? which have governments in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Karnataka, respectively ? have said they would take no such decision.

 What the Congress is getting done in the states run by it is simply a political fraud?. If the Congress is sincere, it should ask its government at the Centre not to levy customs and excise duties on the increased prices of crude instead of passing the buck to state governments, Samajwadi Party leader Mohan Singh said.

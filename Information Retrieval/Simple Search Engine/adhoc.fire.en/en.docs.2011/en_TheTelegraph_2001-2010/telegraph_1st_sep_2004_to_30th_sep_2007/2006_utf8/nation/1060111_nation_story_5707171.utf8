 Mulayam huddle

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, Jan. 10: Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav went into a huddle with senior colleagues and officials on Tuesday, a day after the Supreme Court asked him to respond to charges that he and his family own unaccounted assets worth crores.

 The chief minister met advocate-general Virendra Bhatia and discussed the implications of the Supreme Court notice, sent in response to a complaint filed by Congressman Vishwanath Chaturvedi.

 Prima facie, whatever I could gather, the purchases were made by respective persons separately. There is nothing wrong if a person acquires them through fair means, Bhatia said later.

 A court notice is not an indication of guilt. But the fact that the petition by Chaturvedi, whose motives were questioned because of his political affiliation, has been accepted by the Supreme Court has caused concern in Mulayams Samajwadi Party.

 Political circles in Lucknow were abuzz with speculation that Mulayam might step down and let his brother Shivpal take over till the Assembly poll next year in case of a legal setback.

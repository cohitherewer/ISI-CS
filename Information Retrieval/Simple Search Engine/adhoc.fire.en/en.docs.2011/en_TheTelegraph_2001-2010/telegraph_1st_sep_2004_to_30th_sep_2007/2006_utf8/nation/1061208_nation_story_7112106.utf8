 Briton killed

 New Delhi, Dec. 7: A British aid worker has been found murdered, apparently stoned to death, at Dharamsala, the home of the Dalai Lama. 

 The body of Michael Blakey, 23, was discovered partly concealed beneath a pile of rocks close to a small church on the outskirts of Dharamsala, a popular destination for backpackers.

 Blakey, from Burnley, had been living there since June, working for the Tong-Len Charitable Trust. 

 Police said there was no obvious motive for the attack although his mobile phone and wallet were missing. 

 They said that they had not made any arrests and were investigating several leads into the murder, which happened on November 25 or the day after, just before Blakey was due to fly home for Christmas. 

 Blakey was staying at a Buddhist monastery in a suburb when he went missing. His body was found five days later by a Tibetan monk in a gully that runs through the cemetery of St John in the Wilderness Church.

 Over 700 people from Christian, Buddhist and Hindu backgrounds took part in a ceremony in Dharmasala to celebrate Blakeys life. The messages included one from the Dalai Lama.

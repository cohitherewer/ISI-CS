 Aligarh curfew after clash 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, April 6: A clash over decorating a makeshift temple near a mosque claimed four lives, prompting authorities to clamp indefinite curfew in Aligarh since morning. 

 The violence erupted last night in the communally sensitive western Uttar Pradesh town and worsened today when members of rival communities opened fire and hurled stones at each other. 

 Thirteen people were hospitalised with gunshot wounds, six of them in a critical state, Agra divisional commissioner Ashok Kumar said.

 Two persons were brought dead to the Agra medical college, while the other two succumbed to their injuries later.

 The quarrel broke out in the Dahiwali 

 Gali area when a group of people removed the decorative 

 lighting around the temple, where Ram Navami was being observed, 

 alleging that the electrical connections cut through the 

 mosques premises.

 Left leads push for profit cover

 - Ally proposes amendment, govt accepts

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 9: Before the cabinet decided to expand the list of exempt offices of profit, the Left had mounted pressure on the UPA government to sort out the tangle.

 After a meeting of leaders of the four Left parties at the CPM headquarters today, CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhan said: The government should convene a special parliamentary committee of all political parties and recommend steps to deal with the situation.

 Several CPM MPs, including Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee, have had complaints filed against them saying they are holding offices of profit. 

 The Left leaders said the government should amend the 1959 Prevention of Disqualification Act and expand the list of categories of offices that are exempt. The list may include the controversial offices with retrospective effect, Bardhan said. Later in the evening, the cabinet decided to amend the act.

 Congress president Sonia Gandhi had resigned from the Lok Sabha after the Opposition charged her with holding an office of profit as chairperson of the National Advisory Council, which monitors implementation of the ruling coalitions common minimum programme.

 The Left leaders wanted such offices to be exempt. 

 But the BJP says expanding the exemption list might attract indictment by the Supreme Court, which laid down a stringent precedent yesterday while dismissing Jaya Bachchans plea to overturn her disqualification. 

 The BJP was waiting for the government to make clear its stand before revealing its cards. 

 At the height of the controversy, the CPM had said the MPs often have to be involved in development work in their constituencies. Somnath Chatterjee, who is the Bolpur MP, heads the Sriniketan-Santiniketan Development Authority. 

 There are several cases where Parliament gives the MPs responsibility to develop their constituencies, said Bardhan, citing the example of the Sunderbans Development Authority. The local MP is an ex-officio member of the board. Parliament has given him that responsibility. 

 Some posts in universities and other educational institutions, their senates and syndicates are also held by elected representatives of the people, the CPI leader said.

 Speaker stay-off 

 Speaker Chatterjee indicated that he might not preside over Lok Sabha proceedings when any related legislation is discussed.

 You are intelligent people. If any subject is discussed in which the presiding officer is interested, there are well-established conventions, he said after an hour-long all-party meeting which failed to arrive at a consensus on the profit controversy.

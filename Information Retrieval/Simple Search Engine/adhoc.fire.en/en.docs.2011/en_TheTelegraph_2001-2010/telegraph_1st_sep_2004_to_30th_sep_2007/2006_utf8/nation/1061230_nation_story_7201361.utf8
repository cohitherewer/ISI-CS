 Jewellers withdraw ban-burqa call

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Veiled threat

 Mumbai/Pune, Dec. 29: Punes jewellers, who had called for a ban on veiled customers in the wake of a series of thefts, withdrew the suggestion today after a sharp reaction from the Muslim community. The shopowners said they would make alternative security arrangements. 

 The Maharashtra Jewellers Association had yesterday sent a letter to the director-general of police and the Pune police commissioner seeking permission to ban the entry of customers in veils into the citys jewellery shops. 

 The traders had announced a shutdown of their shops today to protest the rise in crime. The suggestion regarding the burqa outraged Muslims, who said the proposal smacked of religious bias.

 The association today withdrew its proposal and clarified that it had no intention of hurting any community. The traders, however, marched to the collectors office as planned, and submitted a memorandum to draw the administrations attention towards the spurt in robberies.

 Speaking to The Telegraph from Pune, Fatahchand Ranka, the president of the association which has over 12,000 members, said: News channels wrongly portrayed our concerns. We never intended to hurt the sentiments of the Muslim community. We respect all religions and cater to customers from all communities.

 Ranka said sensing that a ban on veiled customers could hurt Muslim sentiments, the traders decided to deploy additional private security, including a lady security officer, to check suspicious customers. 

 We realised that a blanket ban on burqa could create problems. From now on, we will have a male and a female security guard in each shop who will frisk a customer if the person behaves in a suspicious manner and we feel he or she could commit a crime, Ranka said.

 Explaining his rationale for the proposal on a burqa ban, Ranka said during Diwali, the peak season for jewellers, Pune witnessed four major robberies and all were committed by criminals in veils. 

 Our closed-circuit TV footage showed that only the persons eyes were visible. Police also failed to achieve any breakthrough since their faces were not visible, Ranka said.

 Accusing Pune police of failing to curb the crimes, Ranka said the traders became more concerned after daylight dacoities were reported and jewellers suffered serious injuries in these incidents. 

 Dacoities usually happen at night, but in the last six months, daylight dacoities occurred in at least nine shops. Dacoits chopped off fingers of a lady member, while another man suffered such a serious injury that he had to take 50 stitches. How can we do business in such a situation? Ranka asked.

 Pune police commissioner Dhananjay Jadhav assured the traders that their complaints would be looked into and investigation speeded up.

 Diwali heaven on Dal islet

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Srinagar, Oct. 21: Away from their families on a lonely islet on Dal Lake, they have found their paradise. 

 CRPF men stationed at Srinagars Lanka Post, located on the islet popularly called Sona Lank or small Char Chinari, say the stunning view around them is their unrivalled Diwali gift.

 This is the best place to celebrate Diwali. It is like heaven here, said assistant commandant Sukhvir Singh, who is in charge of the post. We have all the arrangements. We have been provided a generator, candles and crackers and we are having great fun. 

 The islet, accessible by shikara, faces the Hazratbal shrine and behind it is the Mughal Gardens. The four mighty chinars Kashmirs prettiest symbol that stand at the corners make a spectacular picture.

 On Diwali evening, the CRPF will be treated to sweets and a special meal. Each party is stationed here for two to three weeks after which a new batch comes. I am urging my officer to keep me here for more weeks, said Ashok Kumar, a trooper. I am lucky to be here on this day and it is a great experience to celebrate Diwali here. 

 Commandant Karpal Singh said there will be celebrations at the camp headquarters in Hazratbal. But we are careful that our men at Lanka Post do not feel isolated. We are sending them delicacies. 

 Before militancy struck root in the area, the islet used to be a favourite stopover for tourists enjoying a shikara ride. They would spend time at a garden and a restaurant, which was later set ablaze. These days, people are allowed on the islet only during Id. 

 In other parts of the city, too, security men are making a song and dance about the festival. The BSF organised a Diwali mela at Humhama, thronged by hundreds of its men and their families.

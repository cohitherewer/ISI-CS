 Maoist gun misses one

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Vigil not enough 

 Midnapore, March 11: Dayasindhu Mahato had a narrow escape last night. The member of the local committee of the DYFI is alive because he was not around when half a dozen Maoists raided his home in Lalgarh, West Midnapore. 

 The rebels had come with the intention of setting up a kangaroo court to hand out capital punishment to Dayasindhu. 

 The Maoists, all with firearms, surrounded Dayasindhus house in Pannapuri village, about 175 km from Calcutta, and close to the Karamsole forest where the Maoists exploded a landmine yesterday.

 Not finding him home, they set his two-wheeler ablaze.

 A Lalgarh police official said: Dayasindhus wife Pratima told them (the rebels) that her husband had gone to Midnapore town to settle a business deal. But the extremists did not believe her and stormed in only to find two children sleeping.

 Furious, they burnt Dayasindhus motorcycle and the haystack in the courtyard. 

 Had Mahato been present, he would have met the same fate that Kartik Singha met a few days back. If he wants to be alive, tell your husband to leave the CPM, one rebel told a shivering Pratima.

 The police said yesterday at Dangardiha, near Belpahari, the extremists surrounded the relatives of CPM activist Gumai Tudu, who was hacked to death on Wednesday night. The relatives were about to cremate Tudu, but ran away, leaving the body behind.

 Yoga at IIT after suicides 

 - Kanpur tackles stress

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 For frayed nerves

 Lucknow, Sept. 5: For Santosh Murthy, the nightmare 

 started with every sundown.

As the shadows deepened and a hush fell over the IIT Kanpur campus, the second-year engineering student agonised inside. He couldnt sleep. 

 Night after night he lay awake, counting the minutes and then the hours as the clock hands ticked away.

 Soon the early morning birds would begin chirping, but I would keep awake, the young man from Hyderabad, a patient of chronic insomnia, told a medical team that visited the campus.

 That wasnt all.

 Another fear gnawed him fear that the water in Kanpur was not clean enough to drink. Murthy had installed a sophisticated form of water purifier in his room, but still his stomach revolted.

 But hope was at hand. He joined a yoga and naturopathy centre the institute had recently set up.

 Today, he is a different man. Six weeks of breathing exercises have improved his health. And he is sleeping more. Like many students, he was suffering from nervous tension and depression due to a phobia over water and study load, says Dr Ravindra Podwal, a yoga expert in charge of the centre.

 The IIT decided to introduce yoga and naturopathy after several suicides on the campus. We are asking students to go to the yoga centre because stress is a silent killer, says director S.G. Dhande. And initial responses from students have been positive.

 On May 3 this year, a 23-year-old student, Shailesh Sharma, hanged himself in his hostel room. The institutes authorities had claimed the final-year student of the chemical engineering department may have killed himself after coming to know that he had failed in two courses advanced thermodynamics and advanced fluid-mechanics.

 In October, Swapnil Chandrakant Dharaskar, a second-year mechanical engineering student, committed suicide.

 Now, with the authorities making yoga exercises compulsory for new entrants, about 70 students have joined the centre so far. Every day, after classes are over, they practise yoga for at least an hour.

 Sources in the institutes health unit say a study on IIT Kanpur students in the wake of the suicides revealed that a very high percentage suffered from stress and nervous tension. Podwal agrees. We had organised occasional health camps and found that stress was a common malady.

 Dr Nirmal Kumar, the institutes chief medical officer, said investigations had shown that the students who committed suicides suffered from stress and depression. 

 So what these future engineers need, Kumar says, is a relaxed atmosphere.

 IIT officials say one major problem springs from the fact that most of these students were toppers in their schools. But after they joined here, they found themselves among many toppers, which led to doubts about their abilities.

 The second factor is homesickness and the third is, of course, the study load.

 Lanka Tiger ban to stay

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chennai, Aug. 9: The Prime Ministers special envoy and national security adviser M.K. Narayanan today ruled out lifting the ban on the LTTE. 

 He also made it clear that there was no possibility at the moment of India holding direct talks with Sri Lanka to resolve the islands ethnic crisis.

 Narayanan urged the UPA government to take necessary steps to bring about peace in Sri Lanka while avoiding the pitfalls of the past in the wake of a war-like situation emerging between the Tamil Tigers and the Lankan security forces.

 Hinting that Delhi was not too enthusiastic about a cautious but more pro-active approach to the conflict between the Lankan army and Tamils in the country as suggested by the ruling DMK in Tamil Nadu and its allies Narayanan said: We are not intervening, but we are using all the persuasion that is possible.

 The envoy said he was in Chennai to brief chief minister M. Karunanidhi on the talks that took place between India and Sri Lanka when its foreign minister, Mangala Samaraveera, visited Delhi yesterday. 

 Delhi explained its position to Colombo on restoring the safety and security of the Tamils there, what should be done as far as devolution of powers to Tamils was concerned and the need to make a distinction between the LTTE and the Tamils of Sri Lanka, he said. 

 Asked whether the chief minister urged for any change in Indias foreign policy vis--vis Lanka, Narayanan said: There is complete unanimity on foreign policy between the state and the central governments. 

 On Karunanidhi telling the Assembly two days ago that it was debatable whether the ban on the LTTE was right, he said: I do not think the Centre has any doubt on the ban. We regard the LTTE as a dangerous organisation and hence the ban on it. 

 Narayanan reiterated Indias persuasive role instead of an interventionist one in Sri Lanka. India is a very important factor in the thinking of the Sri Lankan government. So far, our position is that we are not directly involved. India is a big country and Indias persuasion is important so that everybody, including the Norwegian peace interlocutors and the Ceasefire Monitoring Mission people, talks to us.

 Colombo has agreed to go ahead with the devolution of powers to the Tamils. But they have problems about dealing with the LTTE, the envoy said.

 Iraq probe

 New Delhi, June 16: The Pathak committee questioned two senior diplomats in connection with the probe into the Iraq oil-for-food scam, in which former foreign minister K. Natwar Singh and the Congress have been named as non-contractual beneficiaries.

 The one-man panel questioned Indian ambassador to Jordan R. Dayakar and the deputy chief of the Indian mission in Riyadh, Krishan Kumar, for two hours at Vigyan Bhavan today, sources said. 

 They were summoned for information on the visit of a team led by Natwar to Iraq in 2001. Dayakar was then the envoy to Iraq and Kumar was consul in Amman.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 16 years on, a sorry sendoff

 Rajkot, April 6: L.K. Advani 

 today made a sputtering start to his rath yatra before a 

 thin crowd in his home state, with an appeal to Muslims 

 to allow the Ram temple to be built at Ayodhya.

 Sixteen years after his Ram rath yatra had lifted saffron politics to the centre-stage, the BJP leaders Bharat Suraksha Yatra ? meant to educate people about the Centres minority appeasement ? had the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and the Vishwa Hindu Parishad thumbing their nose at it.

 Posters of Sanjay Joshi greeted the audience at the entrance to the Chaudhary High School Ground, from where Advani boarded his air-conditioned bus-turned-rath that will take him to Delhi at the end of a 35-day journey.

 Joshi, an RSS pracharak, was expelled from the BJP over a smut CD but has been forced back on the party by the Sangh, to the obvious resentment of Advani and Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi.

 Advani-Jinnah bhai bhai, said a banner. Kaho dil se, Sanjay Joshi phir se (say it from the heart: we want Sanjay Joshi), screamed another, as Advani watched with chief ministers Shivraj Singh Chauhan, Vasundhararaje Scindia and Modi, who later flagged the yatra off.

 Party old-timers openly acknowledged that the 1990 yatra, from Somnath to Ayodhya, had drawn a far larger crowd.

 Advani tried to sound reconciliatory towards the Muslims, saying: If Muslims offer help to Hindus in building the temple, it will set a very good example of communal harmony.

 But the audience, just a while ago enlivened by the usual fiery speech from Modi, seemed bored. Many began leaving despite party volunteers requests to stay put.

 Perhaps realising that the odds were stacked against him, Advani said: I dont know whether I should bombard you with another speech.

 But he continued, attacking the Congresss vote bank politics and seeking an apology from the Prime Minister and Sonia Gandhi for getting the Kerala Assembly to pass a resolution seeking release of the 1998 Coimbatore blast accused.

 He ironically thanked the late Rajiv Gandhi for the way he had handled the Shah Bano controversy, thus helping the BJP grow. But irony pervaded his own situation, too: the man who had led that growth was struggling to recapture the magic of the rath yatra that symbolised it.

 Advani might have sensed a bad omen during a visit to Dwarka last evening. As he got ready to pray at the Dwarkadhees temple to seek Krishnas blessings, the lights went off.

Panel gives Udit another chance

Patna: The Bihar womens commission on 

Monday said evidence presented by Ranjana Narayan suggested that she was Udit 

Narayans first wife.

 The commission gave the singer one more chance to present his case failing which the matter can be referred to the National Commission for Women.

 The singer did not turn up before the panel for the second time today and instead sent counsel Mahasweta Chatterjee to represent him. 

 The commission has been insisting on personal appearance so that Narayan could be brought face to face with Ranjana, who claims to have tied the knot with the singer in December 1984 at Supauls Nirmali village. 

Chairperson of the commission Manju Prakash said: We have 

sufficient evidence to substantiate that Ranjana is Udits wife. 

 The woman, she pointed out, has submitted over two dozen letters supposedly written by Narayan between 1987 and 2000 and around 40 photographs of the duo. The clinching evidence is Ranjanas bank statement, which shows a transfer of Rs 2,000 from Udits account three years ago, said Prakash.

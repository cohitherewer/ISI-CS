 Quicker route to Mansarovar, thank govt

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Fast-track salvation 

 New Delhi, Sept. 1: Theres good news for those planning to go to Kailash Mansarovar: the Centre has cleared a proposal to build a 72-km road from Lipu Lake to Gunji, which will cut travel time by over 48 hours.

 At present, travellers have to trek for two-three days to reach the Chinese border at Gunji, from where they are taken to a point close to Kailash Mansarovar in AC cabs.

 The move comes on the heels of the opening of the 4000-km railway line from Beijing to Lhasa. Besides, the Centre has also cleared 27 road projects in strategic areas on the Indo-China border.

 These roads will help people in remote areas to connect with modern civilisation and open new areas for tourists, but they are being built mainly to help Indo-Tibetan Border Police jawans who face great difficulty in reaching forward check posts, a home ministry official said.

 India has not built a single road in strategic areas near the Indo-China border since the 1962 Chinese aggression. Although the matter cropped up several times, the bureaucracy chose not to take action. The logic was strategic areas could be protected by not providing road connectivity.

 The perception changed when India discovered that China has in the last 10 years built several roads in the Tibetan Autonomous Region, right up to the international border with India. The Chinese marvel of connecting Lhasa with a super express train clinched the issue, the official said.

 The roads will run for 862 km near the Indo-China border in five states and will be constructed by the Border Road Organisation and state public works departments.

 Work on the project will start this December and take four years to complete at a cost of about Rs 900 crore, said H.S. Brahma, joint secretary (border management) of the home ministry.

 Of the 27 roads, Sikkim will have three, Arunachal Pradesh five, Uttaranchal 11 and Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir 4 each.

 The Centre is planning to construct more roads, on which a decision will be taken in the next three or four months.

 BJP smells opportunity

 New Delhi, March 22: After the House ruckus on the proposed office-of-profit ordinance, the NDA called on President A.P.J Abdul Kalam and urged him not to give his consent to any such move by the government.

 The NDA delegation, led by former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, alleged that Parliament had been adjourned sine die solely for the purpose of saving Sonia Gandhi from certain disqualification as MP.

 Sixty-one NDA MPs marched to Rashtrapati Bhavan this evening and submitted a memorandum, urging Kalam to give the nation a firm assurance on the ordinance.

 The BJP, which heads the Opposition NDA alliance, appears to have sensed that the ordinance can be turned into a talking point during the twin yatras by L.K. Advani and party president Rajnath Singh.

 BJP spokesman Prakash Javadekar said his party would keep both options of legal recourse and going to the public open if the government issued the ordinance to protect Sonia from disqualification.

 It will definitely become a major issue during the proposed yatras, he said.

 BJP insiders said the party had been struggling to find issues that could be used to attack the Congress. So far, only the Scorpene scam had been available, but that was too technical an issue to be made the main one.

 The ordinance, said to be largely aimed at protecting Sonia, was more than the party would have expected at this juncture, sources said.

 The BJP had sensed the opportunity since morning itself, when Advani told the Lok Sabha that he apprehended the government was planning to adjourn Parliament sine die.

 He reiterated this at a hurriedly convened news conference in the afternoon. 

 Sources in the BJP said that soon after the House assembled today, Advani had asked party leaders to get together most of the MPs for a march to Rashtrapati Bhavan. 

 After meeting Kalam, Advani termed the decision to adjourn Parliament sine die an assault on parliamentary traditions and propriety.

 The Congress party was gloating over the action taken against a Rajya Sabha member (Jaya Bachchan) for being a holder of an office of profit.

 But now a proposal is on for an ordinance to save all similar cases of MPs in respect of holding offices of profit, he said.

 There cannot be double standards ? one for Jaya Bachchan and another for Sonia Gandhi.? Why this brainwave has struck the government?

 Jaswant Singh, the leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha, said the BJP was not agreeable to either the adjournment or the ordinance.

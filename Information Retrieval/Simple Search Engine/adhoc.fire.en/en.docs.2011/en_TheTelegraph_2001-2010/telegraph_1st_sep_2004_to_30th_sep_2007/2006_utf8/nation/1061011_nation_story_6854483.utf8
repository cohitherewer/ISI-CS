 New Delhi, Oct. 10: Investigations into the seizure of rockets in Andhra Pradesh last month have revealed that Maoists had already received 375 pieces of the deadly contraband.

 The Union home ministry has asked the Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu governments to probe further and either seize the rockets or find out the final destination of the consignment. It fears that the rockets could be used to target VIPs and police posts.

 Police had found that the rockets were made indigenously in parts at several cottage industries spread over small industrial towns of Ambattur and Korattur near Chennai and were of better capability than the ones used by the extremists so far.

 There is a suspicion that the consignment was actually meant for Chhattisgarh where security forces have managed to keep the rebel onslaught under control for the last three months. 

 Chhattisgarh has been told to increase vigil in areas around the Andhra Pradesh border and find out if the rockets have been smuggled there. However, findings clearly show that there could be more manufacturing areas and supply lines which the Maoists are using to their advantage, said an official.

 To keep the rebels away from utilising dynamite and gelatine sticks as explosives, which they easily procure from scores of mining industries, the home ministry has also asked the governments to start using liquid-based explosives for mining.

 It can bring down the firepower of Maoists to a great extent as the explosive they mostly use is the solid explosive procured from the mining industry. It is very easy to carry and can be used with some skill. On the other hand, liquid explosive is not only difficult to carry but also requires expertise to use, said the official.

 The police had seized 875 rocket shells, 27 rocket launchers, 12 claymore mines and other arms and ammunition from Mahboobnagar and Prakasam districts of Andhra Pradesh on September 8.

 BJP snubs restive George

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Fernandes

 New Delhi, Sept. 12: The BJP today dissociated itself from George Fernandess criticism of Nitish Kumar and his government in Bihar, raising doubts over his continuation as National Democratic Alliance convener.

 Fernandes has, over the past one week, accused Janata Dal (United) colleague Nitish of failing to provide good governance in Bihar and compared his rule unfavourably with Lalu Prasads.

 BJP spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad contradicted Fernandess remarks this afternoon and heaped praise on Nitish. A number of independent surveys will bear me out; Nitish Kumar is doing a very good job in Bihar, Prasad said.

 The Janata Dal (United)-BJP alliance government has been handling the affairs of the state exceptionally well. The BJP completely dissociates from Mr George Fernandess remarks against the Bihar government.

 Prasad, however, chose not to speculate on how long Fernandes, who lost his post of Dal (U) president in April, would be allowed to continue embarrassing the alliance.

 Neither has the Dal (U) offered an official explanation. One of its leaders said the party has left it to the BJP to decide Fernandess fate.

 Atal, Advani, George they were the three faces of the NDA. The BJP used George to provide a secular colour to the NDA at a time when few were willing to align themselves with a communal party. He has been extremely useful to them. We have to now see how long they would tolerate his indiscretions, a Dal (U) leader said.

 Party strategists feel that Fernandes has tested the patience of the cadre to such an extent that they are now immune to his utterances. In the election for party president, the former defence minister was routed by Sharad Yadav. Party leaders, therefore, feel that Fernandes is no longer in a position to damage them. What he can do is hurt the BJP.

 The NDA conveners recent overtures to Mulayam Singh Yadav will annoy the BJP. Fernandes has invited the Uttar Pradesh chief minister to a socialist gathering on October 12, Ram Manohar Lohias death anniversary.

 The BJP has used George for a long time. Now Mulayam is trying to do the same in the run-up to the Assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh. It does not suit the BJP, a senior Dal (U) leader said.

 The buzz in BJP circles is that either Atal Bihari Vajpayee or L.K. Advani would have to intervene in the matter.

 Prasads statement today reflected the partys growing unease with Fernandes. His flirtations with Mulayam may prove the last straw.

 Sealing drive in Gujarat IT park

 Ahmedabad (PTI): The Gandhinagar Urban 

 Development Authority sealed around 100 shops that had illegally 

 come up on the Gandhinagar Infocity campus.

 The sealing of shops began this morning (Friday). We have sealed around 100 shops, officials said.

 The officials said they had permitted Infocity promoters to set up offices in the IT park. However, they had sold the space meant for offices to businessmen to set up shops and showrooms.

 The sealing drive in Infocity comes a day after the state government announced its IT policy for 2006 to 2011.

 The CEO of Infocity, Dilip Barot, had recently criticised the Gujarat government for not doing enough to promote the state as a favourable IT destination.

 Barot said lack of socio-economic infrastructure, inadequate talent pool and the states association with communal riots were keeping IT companies at bay.

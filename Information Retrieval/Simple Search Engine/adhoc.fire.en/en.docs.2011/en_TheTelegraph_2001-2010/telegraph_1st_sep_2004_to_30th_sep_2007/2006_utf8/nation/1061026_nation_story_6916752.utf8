The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Straight on to 7/11 evidence

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 25: After a decade, Pranab Mukherjee was today back as the external affairs minister, surveying some familiar bits of territory like the troubled India-Pakistan relations.

 Taking questions from reporters on his first day in office, Mukherjee said India would be sharing evidence of Pakistans involvement in the Mumbai train blasts.

 He did not get into semantics over the quality of evidence national security adviser M.K. Narayanan has said the evidence is not clinching and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh found it credible but said his assessment was the same as that of the government.

 The law enforcement agencies had gathered certain evidences, he said. That, he added, would be shared with the Pakistani authorities.

 Although Mukherjee did not elaborate, Delhi could choose to share the evidences through the joint anti-terror mechanism the two countries have decided on. The two countries will discuss the exact shape of this mechanism when foreign secretary-level talks take place next month.

 The new foreign minister spoke of creating a tension-free situation in the region as the countries had no option but to live with their neighbours. We cannot alter our neighbours, he said.

 Asked about anti-India activities being carried out from Bangladesh, he ruled out a suggestion that India could flex its military muscle. It is not a question of applying force, he said.

 But Delhi had been taking up the issue with Dhaka, he said. When Bangladesh Prime Minister Khaleda Zia came to India, Delhi told her that fundamentalist forces must be curbed.

 Mukherjee rooted for peace everywhere, not just in South Asia. We are part of a global village and instability in any part of the world can have its impact on India, he said in the context of Indias efforts to get the economy grow at a rate of 9 or 10 per cent a year.

 Mukherjee was welcomed to his new office by minister of state Anand Sharma.

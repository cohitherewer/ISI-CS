 Musharraf: Resolve on trial

 Nainital, Sept. 24: On the eve of the release of Pervez Musharrafs autobiography in which the General has blamed India for the Kargil conflict, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh acknowledged there was a trust deficit between India and Pakistan.

 But he said the two countries will have to find ways to reconcile their positions on Kashmir while New Delhi holds there cannot be redrawing of borders, Islamabad is unwilling to accept the Line of Control as the permanent border.

 Musharrafs autobiography In The Line of Fire will be launched by UN secretary-general Kofi Annan in New York tomorrow.

 Singh rejected criticism against the joint mechanism with Pakistan to fight terror. The criticism against setting up of the joint mechanism is not right. There is no change in our approach on terrorism, the Prime Minister said.

 His government has been saying talks can move ahead only when Islamabad fulfils its promise of not allowing territory under its control to be used for terrorism against India, Singh added. It (joint mechanism) will test Islamabads resolve to implement its promise to end the scourge of terrorism and its motive. 

 Congress president Sonia Gandhi, sitting by his side at the joint news conference at the conclusion of a chief ministers meeting here, nodded her head in approval each time Singh spoke on Pakistan, indicating the partys full support. The Prime Minister repeatedly clarified that there was no softening or change in the governments stand. 

 There has been trust deficit in our relations with Pakistan. But we cannot stand still, he said, facing a volley of questions on his meeting with Musharraf in Havana last week.

 Singh avoided comment when asked if Pakistans ISI, often accused of fomenting trouble in India, would be part of the anti-terror mechanism. 

 Instead, he chose to respond to Atal Bihari Vajpayees criticism, pointing out that as Prime Minister, the BJP leader invited Musharraf to Delhi after the Kargil conflict, shook hands with him after the attack on Parliament in 2001 and then travelled to Islamabad in 2004. Vajpayee has described the joint mechanism as a conspiracy against the country. 

 Singh said his meeting with Musharraf on the sidelines of the Non-Aligned Movement summit was very good. The two sides had decided to resume their composite dialogue, under which all issues, including Kashmir, will be discussed.

 Manu gets two few rotis

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 19: Manu Sharma is getting a little too demanding, say jail officials.

 The son of former Union minister Vinod Sharma, arrested in the Jessica Lal murder case, told jail authorities he needed more food than they had given him.

 We normally give a person three rotis per meal, but Manu wanted more. He told us he needed at least five rotis, a jail official said.

 The demands did not stop there.

 In the cold stone cell of Tihars jail number 4, Manu also asked for extra blankets one to keep underneath and two to snuggle under. Prisoners in Tihar normally get only one blanket and a sheet to place beneath while sleeping.

 Both the demands were turned down.

 It appears he hasnt yet realised that his fathers writ doesnt run here, said a Tihar official. 

 Manu was, however, spared yoga, introduced for prisoners this year. Every morning, inmates are woken up at 6. He (Manu) did not get up till 8 am, and went back to sleep again soon, the official said.

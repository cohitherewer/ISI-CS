 Women finger govt on violence bill

 MONOBINA GUPTA 

 New Delhi, Feb. 20: Womens organisations have accused the Centre of delaying implementation of the bill to prevent domestic violence that Parliament passed in the monsoon session last year. 

 Amendments were moved last September to make the bill more effective. The bill was passed in the face of opposition from various lobbies.

 But till today, the Centre has not issued a notification so that the bill could come into effect, Sunila Singh, programme coordinator of the National Centre for Advocacy Studies, said.

 In contract, the Centre issued notifications immedia-tely after the Right to Information Act and the National Employment Guarantee Act were passed, she said.

 Indira Jaisingh of the Lawyers Collective has drawn up the regulations that would guide the bill. But the womens organisations are sceptical about how pro-active states will be in implementing it. 

 They cite examples of the Dowry Act and the Prevention of Pre-Natal Diagnostic Act, which have not been implemented by some northern states.

 The centre for advocacy studies is organising a two-day conference on the domestic violence bill this week to discuss its enforcement. 

 We invited Union home minister Shivraj Patil but he declined saying he was too busy, Jaisingh said. 

 One of the objectives of the conference is to get the Centre to plan a budget for the bill. No separate budget has been allotted, Jaisingh observed. The government wants to club it with the Dowry Act. 

 We will draw up an estimate and meet the Planning Commission after the conference, Gouri Choudhury, director of Action India, said.

 Jaisingh said the bill needed financial planning at each level ? for protection officers, trauma centres and shelter homes. 

 The protection officer, who is to provide assistance to the aggrieved is one of the pivots to ensure efficacy of the bill.

 We are yet to decide who will be the protection officer ? male or female ? and what kind of qualifications he/she should have, Choudhury said.

 Air force to ration war games

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 5: US fighter aircraft that flew out of Kalaikunda for exercises with the Indian Air Force last November despite protests from the Left will not be back in the country this year because a cash crunch is grounding international military war games hosted by India.

 The Centre has axed a number of international military exercises that the IAF was hosting and participating in as they were draining the defence ministrys coffers.

 Military exercises with the US, in particular, developed since 2002 and provided the ballast to an intensifying diplomatic relationship.

 Senior air headquarters sources said the IAF has decided to drastically axe bilateral and multilateral drills with the air forces of the US, France, the UK, Singapore and South Africa among others because they are a drain on the exchequer.

 Air Vice-Marshal Sumit Mukherjee, the assistant chief of air staff (concepts and doctrine), announced today that henceforth the IAFs engagements in air exercises would be limited to just two in a year, one to be held within the country and another overseas. He refused to put a ballpark figure on the cost of such exercises but just said they were prohibitive enough.

 The slash ordered by the government will lead to a major cutback in the level of international exposure for the force and air headquarters sources admit that it will be a disincentive for pilots and aircrew as well as tell on comparative studies that the IAF has been carrying on since 2002.

 The Indian military embarked on a series of international engagements through military exercises with a number of countries but mostly with the US since the first contingent of Rangers and air force personnel visited Agra in October 2002 for the Cope India series.

 Since then, the military establishments of India and the US were expecting to institutionalise the exchanges and agreed that they would carry out a series of exercises, chief among these were the Cope India series, the latest edition of which was based out of Kalaikunda, and the Cope Thunder series for which the US Pacific Command hosted an IAF contingent along with air forces from Asia Pacific countries in Alaska every year.

 We have had a fair share of (international) interactions. Since we got the exposure in the last few years, the air force has got a big thrust. But these are very costly affairs. Not only for us but also for the foreign air forces. The effort required is a lot and we will like to control it to an extent. We have gained the respect of foreign air forces through these, Mukherjee said.

 Partly to offset the cost, the IAF last year decided that it would develop the airbase in Kalaikunda and put it out on hire for countries that lacked airspace. Singapore was the first country to take up the offer and in Sindex 2005 ? as the bilateral IAF-Republic of Singapore Air Force series of exercises is known ? it paid for the use of facilities.

 This year, the IAF will host the UKs Royal Air Force (RAF) in an exercise in October that will be based out of Gwalior but will also make use of Kalaikunda for landings and takeoffs of fighter aircraft. 

 The RAF will be bringing in six Tornadoes (air defence version), an E3D airborne early warning and control aircraft (Awacs) and possibly two VC-10 mid-air refuellers. The IAF participation will include four each of MiG 21 Bisons, Mig 29s and Sukhoi 30 Mkis.

 An IAF contingent will also participate in Sindex 2006, this time to be hosted by Singapore.

 Mukherjee said India and the US have decided on a three-year cycle of exercises with their air forces.

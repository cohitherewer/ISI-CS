 Buddha says behave, Kamala gets boot

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Turning their backs on the poor?

 Calcutta/Krishnagar, June 16: On a day the Bengal chief minister warned police and government officials against misbehaving with the poor, the 65-year-old widow of a small farmer was driven out of a police station where she went to lodge a complaint against a landlord.

 Addressing a rally of the CPMs youth wing, the DYFI, Buddhadeb Bhattach-arjee today said the policemen and the babus should learn to treat the poor and their complaints with respect. 

 But what he said at Netaji Indoor Stadium in Calcutta went unheard in Krishnagar police station in Nadia district, only about 80 km away. 

 Kamala Mondal was told to get lost. How long will you be able to fight the landowner? Dont waste our time, an officer told her. 

 Kamala tilled 3 cottahs of a man, Subodh Pal, who owns 120 cottahs. Her husband had got the right to cultivate that small piece of land for 20 years and share the produce with the owner. But five years on, Pal decided he need not honour the agreement now that the husband was dead.

 Turned away from the police station, Kamala, who is childless and depends entirely on the 3 cottahs for food, could have broken down. She didnt. 

 Instead, she moved the Ranaghat court, which ordered the police to accept her complaint, start a case and report the action taken in 15 days.

 Referring to police officers and bureaucrats, Bhattacharjee, who is also the police minister, said: Treat poor people with equal respect as those from the higher sections of society. 

 When a well-dressed person comes to a police station in a car, police officials give him/her a patient hearing and also offer tea. But when poor people come barefoot or in soiled clothes, the same police drive them out and speak filthy language. I want to make it clear that this attitude has to change.

 Kamalas is not an isolated case. Kalpana Basu (name changed), who was molested in Shantipur, Nadia, or Moriom Bewa of Domkol, Murshidabad, whose daughter was allegedly killed, would have the same story to tell. 

 This wasnt the first time that Bhattacharjee expressed resentment about misbehaviour by police and government officials. He said the same at a felicitation organised by the CPM-dominated body of government employees, co-ordination committee, immediately after being sworn in.

 A senior government official who did not want to be named said ordinary people often go to political leaders for help after being turned away by the police or some lower-level administrative official.

 Joint commissioner of Calcutta police Kuldip Singh admitted that a section of the officers was indifferent to complainants, more so if they were poor.

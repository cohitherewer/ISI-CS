 IIT bid to stem B-school brain drain

 CHANDREYEE CHATTERJEE

 IIT Kharagpur

 Calcutta, Sept. 17: Sunit Kumar was keen on research while at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kharagpur, but ended up doing an MBA at IIM Calcutta, instead. The electrical engineering graduate did not want to go abroad, and the IIT labs failed to excite him.

 Worried at the likes of Kumar who turn away from technology and hit the management fast-track after BTech, the IIT is offering better research facilities, high-value scholarships and innovation awards to keep its best students from heading to business schools. 

 At IIT Kharagpur, we are providing high-value scholarships to promote research. We are also trying to raise salaries of teaching staff and provide more perks to draw world-class faculty, said B. Chatterjee, dean of continuing education at the institute.

 The old boys are lending a helping hand, too. Arun Sarin, CEO of Vodafone, the worlds largest mobile company by sales, recently pledged $500,000 to an electronics materials research laboratory named after him. 

 It will be an extension of the institutes metallurgical and material engineering department. An initial sum of $250,000 has already arrived, and work on the state-of-the-art laboratory is scheduled to start shortly. 

 The IIT Foundation, a forum of former students, is not far behind. It is making contributions to develop the academic and non-academic infrastructure, with projects like the G.S. Sanyal School of Telecom and the advanced very large-scale integration (VLSI) lab. 

 These facilities are at the centre of the drive to retain the best brains in technology research. Kumar could well have been one of them.

 I wanted to go in for research but I did not want to go abroad. The labs at IIT Kharagpur are not fully equipped and do not have the latest technology. So, I opted for an MBA programme, Kumar said, explaining his decision to pursue his MBA degree at IIM here. 

 Although the institute does not disclose the percentage of students switching to management, the number is believed to be significant. 

 While modern labs and improved research facilities can offer what faculty members call a challenging environment to stem the flow to B-schools, more money is needed.

 IIT Kharagpur receives an annual grant of Rs 100 crore from the government. We need more support to keep the infrastructure upgraded, explained Madhusudan Chakraborty, the institutes deputy director. 

 Till the Centre loosens its purse strings, the focus is on other initiatives.

 One of them is a three-year graduate research assistant scholarship that the IIT Foundation has approved to encourage the best BTech students to join the advanced VLSI lab. 

 The other is the Nina Saxena Excellence in Technology Award, approved by the IITs board in February this year to encourage and promote technological innovation. 

 It is true that only the most passionate people stay on for research, but we are trying our best to promote it, Chatterjee said.

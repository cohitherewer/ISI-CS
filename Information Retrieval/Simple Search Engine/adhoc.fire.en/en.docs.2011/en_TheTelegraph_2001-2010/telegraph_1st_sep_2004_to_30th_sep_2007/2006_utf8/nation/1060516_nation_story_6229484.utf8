 Shayan knew of notice: Cop

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 15: Delhi police today said Shayan Munshi was aware of the look-out circular (LOC) issued against him and have questioned the model-turned-actors claim that he was going to Bangkok on a honeymoon.

 After interrogating Shayan for close to eight hours today, special commissioner U.C. Katna, who is heading the special investigation team (SIT) in the Jessica Lal murder case, said it was clear that Shayan knew about the LOC and the formalities he needed to fulfil before going abroad.

 We have got some information from him, but I would not like to disclose it at this stage. However, one thing is sure that Shayan was very well aware of the LOC and what he needed to do before going abroad, said Katna. 

 The actor, a key witness in the Jessica murder case who was held at Calcutta airport on Saturday and freed on bail, had said yesterday that he learnt about the circular after his arrest. He also claimed that Delhi police had told him in April that there was no problem if he went abroad.

 A senior officer today said Delhi police are likely to impound Shayans passport as his answers have failed to satisfy them.

 Shayan, who arrived in the capital yesterday, was taken to the SIT office in Qutub Institutional Area this morning where he was grilled from 12.30 pm to 8 in the evening. 

 A senior officer said Shayan fumbled when asked why he was going on a honeymoon after almost six months of his marriage. 

 According to Delhi police, the actors father was also accompanying the couple, which they found strange.

 However, Shayans father had said on Saturday that he went to the airport to drop his son and daughter-in-law Peeya, and had left immediately. When immigration officials refused to let Shayan check in, Peeya informed him.

 Shayan, who was bartending at Tamarind Court with Jessica when she was shot on April 30, 1999, had earlier turned hostile during trial.

 Ramani blow

 Delhi High Court today declined permission to Malini Ramani, another witness in the Jessica murder case, to travel out of India. Malini is the daughter of socialite Bina Ramani, the owner of Tamarind Court where Jessica was murdered. 

 The court also asked the police to file an application to declare Vikas Gill, one of the accused, a proclaimed offender. 

 State counsel Mukta Gupta said Gill, who was earlier granted bail, has fled the country and could not be traced since October 2004.

 According to the prosecution, the accused had given an undertaking in 1999 that he would not leave the country without the courts permission.

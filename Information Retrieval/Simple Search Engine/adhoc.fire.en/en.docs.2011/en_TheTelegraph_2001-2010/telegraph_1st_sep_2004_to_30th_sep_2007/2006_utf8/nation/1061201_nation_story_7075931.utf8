 7/11 charges in 15 bags

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Nov. 30: Four months after the blasts on Mumbai trains that killed 192 people, the anti-terrorist squad (ATS) today filed a 10,667-page chargesheet in a Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) court.

 Filed within the stipulated 180 days of the first arrest in the case, the papers were brought to court in fifteen bags. The ATS proposes to examine around 2,000 witnesses.

 The chargesheet is long and we have listed Pakistani national Azam Cheema of Lashkar-e-Toiba and eight others as the most wanted among the 28 accused. Two other Pakistanis, Saleem and Mohammed Ali alias Osama, are also named, but they were killed in Mumbai, said ATS chief said K.P. Raghuvanshi.

 The chargesheet says 11 Pakistanis plotted the blasts and planted the bombs. Seven bombs made of RDX, ammonium nitrate, nitrite and fuel oil were set off in packed first-class compartments of rush-hour local trains on July 11. The blasts cost the railways Rs 2.8 crore, ATS said.

 On September 30, the ATS claimed it had cracked the case, saying the blasts were masterminded by Pakistani intelligence agency ISI and executed by the Lashkar-e-Toiba (LeT) and the activists of Simi, a banned outfit.

 The claim sparked a diplomatic row with Islamabad, and while Delhi has been offering the Musharraf government evidence of Pakistani involvement in informal meetings, it is yet to hand in the proof formally.

 Speculation was rife that police would file the chargesheet ahead of the secretary-level talks that were held two weeks back so that Indian officials had a chance to present Pakistan with evidence of the ISIs involvement.

 The ATS believes around 15-20 kg RDX was smuggled in and assembled into bombs by Ehsanullah, a Pakistani national. The Pakistanis crossed over from Nepal to Bihar, from Pakistan to Gujarat and from Bangladesh to West Bengal to execute the conspiracy, said Raghuvanshi.

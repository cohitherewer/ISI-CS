 Hong Kong, Feb. 13 (AP): Grammy-winning singer Norah Jones, daughter of Ravi Shankar, will make her film debut in the first English language film by acclaimed Hong Kong art-house director Wong Kar-Wai.

 Wong was originally scheduled to shoot Lady from Shanghai, featuring Oscar-winning actress Nicole Kidman, but has delayed the project until 2007 because he has not found a strong male lead actor, a source attending the ongoing Berlin film festival said.

 Details of the new movie were not immediately available, but the source, who declined to be identified, said it would not revolve around the Hurricane Katrina disaster in the US, as reported earlier. 

 It also wont be filmed in New York doubling as New Orleans.

 The only cast member that is confirmed... is Norah Jones, the source from the film industry said.

 The source also said the movies earlier reported $50-million budget is incorrect, but didnt provide an accurate budget figure. It wasnt clear if Norah would contribute to the music in the movie.

 Norah, 26, rose to fame with the success of her debut album Come Away With Me, which won eight Grammys.

 Wong is known for his subtle and beautifully shot movies like In The Mood For Love, Happy Together and 2046. His films also feature melancholy soundtracks. Wong won best director at Cannes for Happy Together, a gay love story.

 Norahs management company didnt return a call seeking comment.

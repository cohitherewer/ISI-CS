 Second blow to contempt minister

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 11: Maharashtra transport minister Sarup Singh Naik suffered a second setback today when the Supreme Court refused to suspend the one-month jail term awarded to him for contempt of court yesterday.

 The minister had sought suspension of the sentence till his review petition was decided by the court.

 A three-judge bench yesterday convicted Naik and additional chief secretary Ashok Khot of wilfully violating a Supreme Court ban on the operation of six sawmills in Vidarbha. While passing the judgment, the bench also warned those who flout court orders because of their money power and social status.

 Naik and Khot were then environment and forests minister and principal secretary, environment and forests, respectively.

 Today, the bench headed by Chief Justice Y.K. Sabharwal refused to suspend the sentence awarded to Naik for committing contempt of court by violating a 1997 order. The bench said his review petition would be decided by the court in chambers before the summer vacations. The same bench will decide the review petition.

 Earlier, senior counsel Ranjit Kumar, appearing for Naik, argued that if the sentence was not suspended, the minister would have to go to jail even while his review petition was pending.

 The court could either absolve him of the charges or set him free after reducing the sentence to a period already gone.

 In 1997, the apex court had ruled that all wood-based industries within a 1-km radius of forests anywhere in the country should be closed. In 2002, it asked states not to allow any saw, veneer or plywood mill to run without clearance from a central empowered committee it had appointed.

 The order had said the six mills in Vidarbha should be closed, and a year later the court had rejected a plea by the state to allow them to reopen. But in 2004, Naik and Khot granted licences to the mills.

 The minister enjoys no immunity from arrest for being a minister or a legislator. Article 194 of the Constitution, pertaining to immunities to MLAs from arrest or imprisonment, does not extend to criminal charges and contempt of court. 

 Naik has been contending that he had merely accepted the report of the senior-most officer in his ministry. 

 His lawyer said the six mills were closed in January 2005 soon after the apex court-appointed central empowered committee brought the matter to the notice of the ministry. The contempt petition was filed in March 2005 when the mills were not functioning, he claimed.

 The minister pointed out that the mills were granted licence by the Centre under the Industrial Development and Regulation Act prior to 1997, before the green zone order was passed.

 Another Maharashtra minister is also under the apex courts scanner for violating green zone norms. 

 Civil supplies minister Sunil Tatkare has been issued a notice by a bench headed by Justice B.N. Agarwal for allegedly violating a January 2004 Bombay High Court order. 

 The bench has directed his ministry to decide on a matter pertaining to the encroachment of a green zone in one month.

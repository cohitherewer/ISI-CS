 Freedom fight maims Jipmer

 Pondicherry, Sept. 10: Empty wards, closed outdoors, patients dying unattended the ghost of the AIIMS standoff has returned to haunt the Union health minister at the Jawaharlal Nehru Institute of Post-Graduate Medical Education and Research here.

 Unlike at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, where Anbumani Ramadoss had clashed with the director over a junior doctors strike, its the paramedical staff that are on the warpath at Jipmer.

 The dispute stems from a move close to the health ministers heart to bring the Centres only major referral hospital in the south on a par with AIIMS by giving it autonomy. Group C and D staff fear losing the job security they now enjoy as central government employees.

 Autonomy would immediately lead to outsourcing of services like sanitation, laundry, kitchen and security, said a leader of the Jipmer Employees Struggle Front that represents the various hospital unions.

 The stench of biomedical waste hung over the hospital today, paralysed for the third day running. With nurses joining the strike, the management has been forced to discharge most of the 1,500 in-patients and has sought Red Cross help to run the emergency.

 Sources said an accident victim and a burns patient died yesterday from lack of adequate care at the casualty block.

 The outpatient department, where thousands were treated free of cost every day, is shut with the hospital struggling to look after the 60-odd patients in intensive care.

 Our strike will carry on, said A. Kalaimathi, who is leading the agitation. The patients would be hit hard anyway if autonomy is granted. Jipmer, where all treatment is free, will then start charging fees like AIIMS does.

 Till the flash strike began on Friday, the hospital received up to 5,000 patients every day from all the southern states, the emergency cases coming mostly from neighbouring Tamil Nadu.

 Jipmer director K.S.V.K. Subba Rao counters the employees allegation about job security. The Centre has promised that current service terms and conditions would be protected, he said.

 The doctors are in a dilemma. They are unwilling to go against the striking staff but feel the institute needs academic autonomy to attract and retain medical talent.

 Though its a cabinet decision, the unions allege its Anbumani who pressured the Centre (into it) because Jipmer is close to his native place. The reference is to Tamil Nadus Vanniyar heartland the political base of Ramadosss party PMK.

 The unions today met PMK chief S. Ramadoss and will talk to chief minister M. Karunanidhi tomorrow.

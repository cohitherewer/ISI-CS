 Class XII student raped in Delhi car

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 27: A Class XII student of a top public school was gangraped in a car in Delhi last evening when she was on her way home from tuition.

 Four men named in the FIR have been arrested today, deputy commissioner of police (west Delhi) Robin Hibu said.

 This is being looked at as a major case. We kept information of the case secret till the arrests were made to catch the accused by surprise.

 The 17-year-old victim knew at least two of the men identified as Palvinder and Kunal. These two are either currently her classmates or have been classmates in the past, a senior police official said.

 An epileptic patient, the girl has told the police she had a fit while returning from her coaching class in west Delhis Hari Nagar when the Scorpio with the four men drew up.

 She has told us they offered to drop her home. She voluntarily entered the car, the official said.

 But instead of taking her home, the police said, the men drove around west Delhi till it got dark. Then they headed to the isolated ridge area, where they took turns to rape her in the moving car. 

 A medical examination of the victim has confirmed the rape, the police said. The Scorpio has been impounded.

 Delhi contributes to almost a fourth of the total cases of rape in the country 24.4 per cent with Mumbai a distant second, at 8 per cent.

 Dead artist comes alive

 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY

 Varanasi, March 9: When the bomb went off, Manish Pandey was sketching the chaos of life. Untraced for over a day and given up for dead, the young art student might return to a more pressing theme if he survives ? lifes fragility.

 The 22-year-old, part of a group of students from Mahatma Gandhi Kashi Vidyapith Arts College, had gone to the Cantonment railway station on the fateful evening of March 7. They were in the waiting hall, their canvas spread out before them.

 Manish was just a couple of feet away from the blast, said Pramod, a fellow aspiring artist who survived unscathed as he had stepped out minutes before.

 Police and rescue workers found Manishs canvas and his small bag but he could not be traced.

 Today, Sanjeev, one of his friends who refused to accept he had died, found him in the intensive care unit of a hospital. Wired to multiple support systems, he was writhing in pain. 

 On his canvas, this would have been the most apt image of a mans struggle for life, said Manish Rai, a relative.

 The young man underwent brain surgery yesterday and is still unconscious. But he must be a strong person. We have done a surgery on his brain to bring out the splinter, said neurosurgeon Vivek Sharma.

 Senior medical officer G.N. Srivastava said news of Manishs death spread because his name was not there among the list of injured patients. And doctors could not identify him as he was unconscious.

 Saving his life was the first challenge. And we have, perhaps, succeeded in doing it, Srivastava added.

 Doctors say his condition is still serious but stable. Manish has now been identified as the son of .P. Pandey from Bihars Chhapra district.

 Like Manish, Bhola, Sadanand, Rajesh and Prakash ? who were also part of the group in the waiting hall ? could not be traced till yesterday.

 Today, Manjula Chaturvedi, the principal of the college, and other teachers found them in different hospitals. Their parents also met them. Bholas legs had to be amputated.

 Art work is the creation of a proper aesthetic mind. The blast appears to have impaired them extensively, either physically or mentally, Chaturvedi said later.

 College officials said the students are sent to public places for random sketches. Some of them had gone to the Sankat Mochan temple also. Fortunately, they left before the blast, an official said.

 Jail shock for eight Trinamul leaders

 OUR BUREAU

 Chinsurah/Calcutta, Aug. 3: Eight Trinamul Congress leaders were today remanded in judicial custody for a week in connection with a case of rioting and arson in a police station in 2000.

 Former Trinamul MLAs Sanjay Bakshi, Pankaj Banerjee, Dipak Ghosh, Biplab Roy Chowdhury and Jatu Lahiri are among the eight sent to jail. Apart from Ghosh, all the accused were present in the Arambagh sub-divisional court in Hooghly when additional chief judicial magistrate Mina Sarkar passed the order.

 Trinamul workers had allegedly ransacked Pursurah police station, 90 km from Calcutta, on December 25, 2000, following a clash with the CPM in Chiladingi village the day before. 

 The officers there filed a case, saying the Trinamul men had barged into the police station demanding that the CPM members involved in the clash be punished.

 Bakshi and the others moved Calcutta High Court in April this year seeking an order quashing proceedings against them. The high court asked them to seek bail from the trial court.

 The accused surrendered before the Arambagh court in May this year. It granted them interim bail and posted the case for hearing today.

 However, the leaders were in for a shock when the judge sent them to seven days judicial custody.

 After the ruling, leader of Opposition in the Bengal Assembly Partha Chatterjee called up state chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb and requested that something be done to prevent his party leaders from being sent to jail.

 I requested the chief secretary to explore the option of consulting the matter with the district judge so that they are freed tomorrow, Chatterjee said this evening.

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee called up Trinamul leader Saugata Roy this evening. The chief minister was concerned as most of the Trinamul leaders sent to jail are elderly. Pankaj Banerjee is also a former leader of Opposition. He has assured us help and said he was consulting officials, Roy said.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept 25: I amp;B minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi today asked the board of directors of United News of India to defer a meeting that could decide the news agencys ownership. 

 UNIs board of directors was scheduled to meet tomorrow to discuss a move to sell a chunk of the companys shares to the Essel Group, which owns Zee television and has a major stake in the newspaper, Daily News and Analysis (DNA). 

 Just before the board meeting, the annual general meeting of the UNI stake-holders was to be held.

 Das Munshi made the suggestion when he met Zee chairman Subhash Chandra and UNI boards chairman Manoj Sonthalia this evening.

 Sonthalia reportedly indicated the board would agree with his suggestion. But till late evening, there was no official announcement. Sonthalia could not be contacted.

 Das Munshi had suggested a months postponement. During this period, his ministry would talk with UNI employees, its management and the Zee group on what is being described as a proposed take-over of the company.

 Earlier, Das Munshi said the ministry would consult them on legal and other concerns related to the proposed transfer of shares.

 He indicated that the concerns included apprehensions over retrenchment of employees and the change in the character of the news agency.

 Several newspaper groups including ABP hold stakes in UNI which was founded in 1961 under Section 25 of the Companies Act. All profits have to be ploughed back into the company.

 The directors appear divided on whether Essel should get what could be a controlling stake in the company.

 The UNI employees union has protested against the Zee move and garnered support from the Left and Congress leaders. The CPM has written to the Prime Minister.

 Das Munshi has said he would report on the UNI developments to the Prime Minister.

 Sack letters to 760 doctors, strike spreads

 - Maharashtra government refuses to sign on dotted line

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, March 4: The doctors strike in Maharashtra that entered its sixth day today could spill over to other states. 

 As doctors in New Delhi, Andhra Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh pledged their support to the strike, a 7,000-strong rally was held at Azad Maidan in Mumbai. Interns and undergraduates also joined in. 

 The government, meanwhile, issued more termination notices. It had served letters to 150 striking doctors last night and 760 more in Mumbai and Pune were given termination notices today. 

 But despite the governments combative stance, the protests spilled to Nagpur. Resident doctors at the Indira Gandhi Medical College and Hospital today went on a flash strike.

 Negotiations between the government and the medicos have yielded nothing after four rounds of talks. Union minister Sharad Pawar also deputed Dr Ravi Bapat, a friend and a Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors (Mard) founder, to end the crisis, but to no avail. 

 The doctors, who went on strike following assaults from patients relatives, insist the government should sign an agreement if it accepts their demands (see chart). But state authorities remained non-committal. 

 We work for 48 to 60 hours without a break handling OPDs which have more than 500 patients a day. We have to share poorly-maintained staff quarters?. We are paid a measly Rs 8,000, which is lower than what a Class IV employee in a municipality gets. And, after all this, someone comes and slaps us for no fault of ours, cried an angry doctor at the rally.

 Speaking from Delhi, Dr Ashwini Dalmiya, the convener of the Federation of Resident Doctors Association in the capital, said: We wore black badges and observed a Black Day. We have planned a protest outside Rajghat tomorrow and we may resort to a token strike next week to express solidarity with the Maharashtra doctors.

 We want a debate in the society on this issue, he said.

 Mard, which is spearheading the strike, set up parallel out-patient departments at Sion and King Edward hospitals in Mumbai. 

 The government continues to use under-hand pressure tactics. They instructed blood banks not to accept blood collected at our blood donation drive held at KEM hospital, said Mard spokesperson Dr Ajay Oswal, who has been slapped a notice saying his services could be suspended.

 The state has offered to set up a committee to study the working conditions of doctors and implement the committees report after three months. Officials said resident medical officers would have to be put in the category of public servants. To decide on their other demands, the government has asked for more time. 

 The government has invoked the Maharashtra Essential Services Maintenance Act against them. This will enable the government to treat the strike as an offence and even arrest the doctors.

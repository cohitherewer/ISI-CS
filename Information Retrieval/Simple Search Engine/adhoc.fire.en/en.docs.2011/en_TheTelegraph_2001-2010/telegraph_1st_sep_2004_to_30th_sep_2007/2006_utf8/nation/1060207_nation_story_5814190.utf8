 Airport case put on fast track

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 6: Delhi High Court today posted a petition of Anil Ambanis Reliance Airport Developers, challenging the award of contract for modernisation of airports, for final disposal on February 13.

 A bench of Justices Tirath Singh Thakur and Sanjeev Khanna set the date after hearing preliminary arguments today. The court asked all parties concerned to file affidavits to support their contentions before February 8.

 Saying that the modernisation of Delhi and Mumbai airports was of national importance, the court agreed to dispense with various procedural laws to dispose of the petition by February 13.

 The bench said it was keen on early disposal of the case without going through the rigmarole of regular procedures. It would be an unpleasant decision to stay the entire process by way of an interim order in view of the national importance of the project, the bench added.

 Reliance Airport has alleged that the terms and parameters of evaluation and award of tenders were changed at the last moment in an arbitrary manner without any reason or notice.

 Appearing for the Union government, additional solicitor-general Gopal Subramanium urged the court to dismiss the petition as all rules were observed.

 He pleaded that the matter be disposed of at the earliest since the government was determined to complete the modernisation of the two airports before March 2010 in view of the Commonwealth Games.

 The lawyer said the tender process was conducted in a fair and transparent manner by involving as many as six layers of evaluation committees before clinching the deal.

 Counsel Mukul Rohtagi, appearing for Reliance Airport, wanted the entire tender process to be quashed.

 Representing GMR-Fraport, which won the Delhi airport project, counsel K.K. Venugopal said the petition needs to be dismissed as his company fulfilled both the technical and financial requirements to bag the contract.

 GMR-Fraport today submitted the Rs 500-crore bid bond guarantee to the Airports Authority of India.

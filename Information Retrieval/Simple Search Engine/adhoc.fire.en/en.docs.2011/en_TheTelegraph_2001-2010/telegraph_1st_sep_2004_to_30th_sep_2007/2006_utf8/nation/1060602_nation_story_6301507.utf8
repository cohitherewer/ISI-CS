 Left scorns Kalam query

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 1: With the threat of disqualification looming over 11 CPM members of Parliament after the President returned the office-of-profit bill for reconsideration, the Left today warned the Election Commission against precipitating matters in the changed situation.

 We do not want the EC to be drawn into further controversies. The commission has already taken several controversial decisions during the recent Assembly polls, CPM general secretary Prakash Karat said following a meeting of the Left parties.

 Karats warning comes a day after the poll panel ? which had gone slow over the disqualification petitions after Parliament passed the profit bill ? reportedly fast-tracked pending cases against 45 MPs and over 200 MLAs.

 The BJP-led National Democratic Alliance, too, petitioned the commission yesterday to act immediately on all the complaints.

 Now, on the basis of a BJP demand, the commission says it will proceed on the complaints against several MPs and MLAs of various parties. The EC should not get embroiled into further controversy, Karat said.

 The CPM leader reiterated his partys position that the complaints against the Marxist MPs, including Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee, were politically motivated. The complaints had been lodged by Trinamul Congress leader Mukul Roy in the run-up to the April-May Assembly polls in Bengal.

 We dont find any basis for the EC to seek further material on his complaint, Karat said.

 He side-stepped the question whether the Left wanted the bill to be passed again in its present form and sent back to the President. Parliament should decide on this issue, Karat said.

 He said the Left was against advancing the monsoon session of Parliament or calling a special session to deal with the matter.

 CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhan was dismissive about the Presidents query whether the new legislation would apply uniformly to all legislatures. He said the states had their own definitions and lists of offices of profit.

 As for the argument that the law shouldnt take effect retrospectively, Karat said even the Supreme Court has given rulings that laws can be enforced with retrospective effect. 

 There are many such instances, he said.

 The Left leaders repeated their demand for a special parliamentary committee and come up with a comprehensive definition of offices of profit to settle the controversy once and for all.

 Nuke talks close with loose ends

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 14: India and the US today ended discussions on the bilateral civil nuclear cooperation agreement, which forms the backbone of the Indo-US nuclear deal.

 Technical experts prepared the broad outline of the pact, also known as the 123 agreement, that will be signed after the nuclear deal is passed by US Congress. 

 The three-day talks that started on Monday were the first technical discussions on the complicated subject.

 Officials said the two sides made good progress in weeding out differences over the agreement, the framing of which is a painstaking exercise. A settlement on the final draft is expected within the next couple of months. 

 However, there are several loose ends yet to be tied. One of them is the question of allowing India to conduct nuclear tests in future.

 The US wants to put a cap on any testing by India and has sought the right to terminate the deal in case of violation. While Delhi has maintained it will adhere to the policy of unilateral moratorium on further tests, it does not want to enter into any legal commitment.

 Broadly speaking, the 123 agreement will cover supply of fuel, storage of spent fuel, nature of safeguards and terms on which the pact can be terminated.

 The two sides will hold another round of meetings later.

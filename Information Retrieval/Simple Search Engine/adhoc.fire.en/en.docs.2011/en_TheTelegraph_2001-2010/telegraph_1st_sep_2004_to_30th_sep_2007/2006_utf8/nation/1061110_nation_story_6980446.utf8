 Bihari slur: doc sorry

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, Nov. 9: A probe panel investigating allegations that a doctor misbehaved with a 30-year-old woman writhing in labour pain at Kalyanis Jawaharlal Nehru Memorial Hospital has apologised to her and asked him to tender a written apology. 

 Dont create such a din. This is typical Bihari behaviour, junior doctor Bappa Dhali had snapped at Sushila Gupta as she cried in pain on October 30. Sushila was born and brought up in Bengal but her parents hail from Ranchi, earlier in Bihar. 

 We called her (Sushila) on Tuesday and the five-member committee apologised to her on the hospitals behalf. We also told her that a written apology letter from Dhali would be sent, hospital superintendent Nirupam Biswas said.

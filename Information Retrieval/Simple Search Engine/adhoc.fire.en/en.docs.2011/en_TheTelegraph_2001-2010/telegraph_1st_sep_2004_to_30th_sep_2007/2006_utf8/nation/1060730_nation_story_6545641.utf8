 Mumbai, July 29: For the fourth time this month, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation has failed to pull down an unauthorised shopping complex allegedly funded by Dawood Ibrahim.

 After thrice postponing the demolition of the Sara-Sahara mall, the civic body today began demolitions amid heavy security, but eventually razed seven unauthorised structures adjacent to the mall, leaving the 20,000-square-foot complex untouched.

 Investigations have shown the mall was built on land belonging to the central public works department.

 Senior municipal officials, however, remained tight-lipped on whether the structures being demolished were also built by the Karachi-based underworld don, the main accused in the 1993 Bombay blasts.

 As the demolitions began, Kishore Kshirsagar, the deputy municipal commissioner supervising the operation, said the Sara-Sahara complex would not be razed today because of pending legal issues.

 The mall, which houses 271 shops, has been the subject of civic as well as criminal investigations. While a probe by civic authorities found 11 civic employees guilty of conniving with the underworld to allow the mall to come up, a Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) court is probing the criminal angle of the underworlds investments in real estate.

 Dawoods brother Iqbal Kaskar was arrested on charges of financing the mall with underworld money. He was arrested on the basis of telephone intercepts between him and co-accused Abdul Rehman.

 Today, over 300 civic workers began pulling down over 300 shops located in seven unauthorised structures in the Munim compound adjacent to the Sara-Sahara complex. Over 500 policemen threw a cordon around the demolition squad. 

 These seven structures are also on central public works department land, Kshirsagar said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 PM, Advani trade nuke missiles

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Manmohan Singh, L.K. Advani

 New Delhi, Dec. 18: L.K. Advani and Manmohan Singh livened up the Lok Sabha today, trading barb for barb on the nuclear deal.

 The leader of the Opposition lunged at the Prime Minister with the allegation of ending Indias nuclear swarajya (sovereignty).

 Singh stood his ground, arguing that the criticism based on the US waiver acts provisions was premature, because it was merely an enabling legislation Washington needed to negotiate with Delhi.

 The nuclear agreement is still to be negotiated. If we make compromises on our strategic nuclear programme or foreign policy in the final deal, the House can take action. I should add here that I would be the last person to say that Indias foreign policy should be made in Washington, he said.

 The brief discussion under Rule 193 was initiated by Basudeb Acharia. But the CPM member let Advani take his place and start the debate, prompting the BJP leader to allege that even the governments allies were divided on the deal. Do you realise how isolated you are on this issue? he asked. Even your allies do not support you.

 Singh met him head-on. The leader of Opposition has painted a scary picture that has no relation to facts. He has also sought to divide the UPA so that the government can be toppled, he said.

 But let me inform him, his dream would never be fulfilled, the Prime Minister declared as government allies thumped their desks. And to fulfil his dream, he also has to seek permission from Mr Vajpayee, he added, to more applause and laughter.

 The Prime Minister also took a mild swipe at the scientists critical of the deal by citing how they had failed to generate much nuclear energy despite promises.

 Our scientists have done us proud. Dr Homi Bhabhas vision, that was aimed at (a) nuclear programme giving rise to power generation, has not been realised. I was a member of the Atomic Energy Commission and in the 70s, the aim was to produce 10,000 mega watts of nuclear power. We have been able to produce barely 3,600 mw.

 A sarcastic Advani accused the Prime Minister of sharing the US ambition of de-nuclearising India.

 Singh shot back that the NDA had had secret parleys with the Americans on the nuclear deal. He said the NDAs foreign minister, Jaswant Singh, had promised the then US deputy secretary of state, Strobe Talbott, he would deliver Delhis assent to joining the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty regime.

 I have kept Parliament informed at every step of the negotiations, but one should ask the NDA what secret deliberations they were holding with the Americans. And we had to read Strobe Talbotts book to figure out what Jaswant Singh had gone and promised them.

 Advani listed seven objections to the US waiver act:

 It aims to eliminate Indias nuclear weapons programme

 It forces the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT) on India through the backdoor

 It classifies India as a non-nuclear weapons state

 It provides for non-proliferation controls on India

 It forecloses Indias option to conduct nuclear tests

 It imposes control on Indias fissile material production

 It seeks to control Indian foreign policy.

 Sonia stir in Lanka media

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 Sonia: In demand 

 Colombo, July 29: Everybody hates the war, yearns for peace and wants India to resolve the conflict. But nobody knows how.

 That encapsulates the mood across the political and extra-political spectrum in Sri Lanka, which is in a no-war-no-peace situation with the LTTE relaunching strikes and the army waiting in prey near the Tamil Tigers lair.

 The sense of despair and loss was reflected in the way the Lankan press treated a meeting that former Prime Minister and now leader of Opposition Ranil Wickremasinghe had with Congress president Sonia Gandhi in Delhi last week.

 Without sourcing the information, the press had it that Sonia had expressed her desire to resolve the ethno-religious conflict within the parameters of the 1987 Indo-Lanka accord, inked by Rajiv Gandhi and then president J.R. Jayawardene.

 A neutral take was Wickremasinghes United National Party ? which lost the presidential election to the Sri Lanka Freedom Party ? was in danger of losing its MPs to the ruling party because President Mahinda Rajapakse wanted to reduce his dependence on the Janatha Vimkuti Peramuna and the Buddhist party that support his government from outside.

 The UNP leader met Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and leader of Opposition L.K. Advani. In the process, he signalled to his domestic constituents that he had Indias blessings and could not be played around with. The ruling party was discreetly told not to fish in troubled waters. The defections were instantly placed on hold, said a political observer.

 But everybody saw a larger design at work in the Wickremasinghe-Sonia meeting.

 A source close to the Tamil Tigers reacted to the report by first saying that Sonia alone could appreciate the full dimensions of the problem because she is Rajiv Gandhis widow.

 Your other leaders have a superficial understanding because they are not affected by it, directly or indirectly. Sonia knows the whole thing inside out, the source said.

 In keeping with the Lankan propensity to mix politics with history and myth, this source harked back to the 1987 accord which proved to be the kiss of death for Rajiv Gandhi, who was assassinated by LTTE rebels in 1991.

 If Sonias reported view is taken to mean Indias view as well, then you are in trouble again, the source warned.

 The accord granted certain concessions to Tamils, such as devolution of power to the provinces, merger of the north and east provinces (subject to a later referendum), and conferring official status on the Tamil language. But it was savaged by the LTTE for its failure to situate the essence and mode of struggle as a liberation struggle for self-determination, not recognising the concept of a Tamil homeland and legitimising Delhi as the principal guarantor of a solution to the violence.

 On its part, India believes that the accord had ideas which can be picked up and made contemporary.

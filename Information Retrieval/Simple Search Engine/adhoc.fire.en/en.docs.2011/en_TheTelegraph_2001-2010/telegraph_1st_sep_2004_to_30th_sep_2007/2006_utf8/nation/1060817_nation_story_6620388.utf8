The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Man burns, others watch

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Gaya, Aug. 16: As the nation celebrated Independence Day, dozens of persons, including four cameramen, watched a former transport contractor immolate himself and made no attempt to rescue the man as he was engulfed by flames. 

 Manoj Mishra, a former contractor of Comfed, the Bihar government undertaking marketing dairy products, had announced his intention of self-immolation to protest against the high-handedness of the Gaya Dairy Project management.

 Witnesses said Mishra, in his mid-thirties, walked into the protected premises of the Gaya Dairy Project shortly after 6 in the morning yesterday. Four cameramen representing city and state news channels too arrived soon after. 

 Mishra positioned himself near the flag post on the project premises. Sitting crosslegged, Mishra soaked his towel in diesel. The cameramen adjusted their equipment to get the shot. Half-an-hour later, Mishra lit a matchstick and put it to his kurta, but in vain. He made a second attempt. This time the match worked. 

 Within seconds, the man was converted into an inferno. He ran around the national flag post, but nobody, including the half-a-dozen watch and ward staff of the dairy project, other employees present on the premises, cameramen and people watching the tragedy, did anything to rescue him. 

 Police, who arrived late on the scene, took Mishra to the Magadh Medical College Hospital, which does not have a burns unit. He was referred to Patna Medical College and Hospital, which, again has no a specialised unit for burns patients. About nine hours later, Mishra died. 

 Asked why no one tried to rescue Mishra, Sudhir Kumar, a Comfed employee, said though he was not present at the spot, those who were may not have taken Mishra seriously. Mishra, he said, was known for his theatrics.

 Azad: Back-channel overtures

 Jammu, Aug. 21: Ghulam Nabi Azad is making back-channel overtures for talks between separatists and the Centre to speed up the process of finding a solution to the Kashmir problem, according to highly-placed sources.

 The response to the chief ministers efforts the public calls to separatists that he has been making and now behind-the-scenes initiatives taken entirely on a personal level has so far been positive, the sources said.

 Azads confidants have approached at least two separatist leaders in the Kashmir Valley, one in Srinagar and the other with influence in the states northern region.

 Their message from the chief minister is the government was ready for talks with those who are keen on a solution through dialogue. The sources said Azad has made it clear that his administration was willing to engage separatists in talks if they offer a violence-free atmosphere.

 Azads efforts had started immediately after he took charge last November. He was the main force behind arranging meetings between Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Peoples Conference chairman Sajjad Gani Lone in January this year, and with Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front chief Yasin Malik a month later. 

 He was also instrumental in resuming stalled talks between the Prime Minister and a moderate faction of the Hurriyat Conference in May, three weeks before the second roundtable conference on Kashmir was held in Srinagar.

 The efforts have now been stepped up because the chief minister believes separatist groups have their symbolic value, both in the eyes of Kashmiris and that of the international community, the sources said.

 The fresh push to talks has also come at a time when even Hizb-ul Mujahideen, the strongest militant outfit in Kashmir, has opened up to the idea of a dialogue and indicated that a ceasefire was a possibility if the government brought down the number of troops in the Valley and released prisoners. 

 The statement came from its chief, Syed Salahuddin, in a recent interview with a Srinagar news agency. 

 Although the conditional ceasefire proposal has been shot down by militant outfits like Al Arifeen, Al Nasreen, the Save Kashmir Movement and Farzandan-e-Millat, the mood in the state remains extremely pro-dialogue. And, this is what Azad, keen to go down in Kashmirs history as a peacemaker, is trying to make the best of.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Two more weeks of unwanted calls

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 6: Relief could be at hand from the tyranny of the telemarketer, with the Centre today promising to solve the problem of unwanted calls in two weeks.

 The assurance was given to the Supreme Court as it heard a petition seeking a stop to companies invading telephone users privacy through telemarketing calls.

 The government sought a two-week adjournment saying it would come up with a solution by then.

 It is a serious problem and something has to be done, the bench of Justices Ruma Pal and Dalveer Bhandari said.

 Additional solicitor-general Gopal Subramaniam told the court the department of telecommunications had already summoned cellular service providers and basic landline service providers for a discussion.

 The public interest litigation, filed by social activist Harsh Pathak, seeks a direction to the government to check, regulate or end the unrelenting invasion of individuals privacy by cellphone, banking and other companies.

 The court had issued notices to the Centre, cellular service providers and several multinational banks last year, but the matter was then put on the backburner. Todays time-bound assurance by the Centre raises hopes of some sort of relief sometime soon.

 Pathak argues that unsolicited calls on mobile phones violate a citizens fundamental rights under Articles 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution.

 Besides seeking an appropriate law, scheme and regulation to protect the rights of citizens, the petitioner wants mobile companies banned from transferring data on subscribers to any other company for commercial reasons.

 Pathak has cited how other countries have acted to protect the privacy of their citizens.

 The US has passed The Telephone Consumer Protection Act, 1991, and the Telemarketing and Consumer Fraud and Abuse Prevention Act, 1994, besides starting a Do Not Call register to enable consumers to keep telemarketers at bay.

 Pathak has sought a similar register in India. Telemarketing companies are not allowed to call those on the US register.

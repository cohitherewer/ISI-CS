The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Teary rogue blames Brit lure

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Bangalore, July 1: Nadeem Hamid Kashmiri, the latest addition to the BPO hall of infamy, says it was the promise of a job abroad that made him transgress.

 I passed on personal information so that I could emigrate to the UK. I was promised a job there by the person to whom I passed on the data, the 24-year-old has told his interrogators.

 Kashmiri filched details pertaining to 20 British customers of HSBCs credit card division and passed them on to a crime syndicate that ripped off almost Rs 2 crore from these accounts. 

 He was produced before a Bangalore court on Wednesday and remanded in police custody.

 But the police are not amused. He has brought a bad name to the entire outsourcing industry in Bangalore. There are many gaps in what he says and we are definitely investigating the terror fund flow angle, too, S.K. Mohapatra, IG, economic offences wing, told The Telegraph.

 Kashmiri, apparently, has been crying during interrogation sessions and keeps blaming the third-generation Indian Muslim contact in the UK who induced him to commit the fraud.

 The police believe the UK contact ? whose name and cellphone number they have requested not to be published ? emailed Kashmiri after speaking to him several times. Although these international calls to HDPI, HSBCs BPO arm in Bangalore, are routed to customer service representatives at random, the investigators say the contact could have spoken to Kashmiri at least thrice and got friendly.

 It is possible that both spoke for many minutes as some customers engage in a banter with call centre representatives and it could have gone undetected, a BPO consultant said.

 Kashmiri says he thought the contact was a good Muslim. He was very polite and started his mails and calls with salaam alaikum. There was no face-to-face contact, he has told police who are hunting for the first email that has been deleted.

 The sleuths believe that after the first email, in which the contact gave Kashmiri his mobile number, they regularly spoke between March and May when the fraud was committed. It was only a matter of time before the UK contact asked Kashmiri to pass him personal details, security information and debit card codes.

 Initially, he was paid Rs 4,000 per customer profile, but when he found out there was a lot of money being removed from HSBC accounts, he upped his stake and was paid up to Rs 17,000 for every detail. In all, he made Rs 1,50,000 before being caught and fired.

 Kashmiri managed to get another job in Dell within a fortnight of being sacked by HSBC. We arrested him before he joined Dell following a complaint lodged by HDPI, Mohapatra said.

 BPO companies agree that there are no background checks on employees handling sensitive data. 

 There is a lot of scope for fraud, especially in the US. Here they are raising a hue and cry as it is outsourced to another country like India. In the US, Internet fraud is on a much bigger scale than in India, an industry source said.

 But the police are not taking the case lightly. He breaks down often and keeps repeating he did it to go to the UK and lead a better life, a senior officer said. 

 We will get more (information) from him as we have his custody till July 7, he added.

 Papiya four snapped up

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Patna, Dec. 16: Bihar police today arrested four persons and said Papiya Ghosh, who taught history at Patna University, was murdered for resisting a robbery a claim her friends find hard to accept.

 Ghosh and her help, Malathi, were stabbed to death on December 2 in the professors bungalow in the upscale Pataliputra Colony. 

 The murder rocked the Assembly and was taken up with the Prime Minister amid allegations that land sharks were behind it.

 As of now, robbery alone seems to be the motive behind the murder of Patna University historian Papiya Ghosh, director-general of police A.R. Sinha said. 

 The four arrested were Shankar Sau, 22, a part-time driver with a Don Bosco school teacher; A.K. Roy, 19, a jobless youth from Chhapra who worked in a rolling mill here before taking to petty thefts; A.K. Urao, 19, a newspaper hawker; and Manohar Kumar Thakur, who recently quit working at a rolling mill. None has a murder charge against him.

 Most of the loot, including a Maruti car found in a dilapidated garage, a TV set and a computer, has been recovered from different places in Patna. None of it had been sold. 

 The four will be produced in a court tomorrow. 

 DGP Sinha said the main gate of the historians house was ajar when the gang sneaked in around 9 am. They probably knew her daily routine well to strike at that hour. The main conspirator, who would have provided information about Ghoshs routine, is still at large. 

 The DGP, who announced a Rs 50,000 reward to the police team, asked the media to stop thinking of various angles and trust the police. 

 But Ghoshs friends are not convinced. Prof. S.K. Singh, also a resident of Pataliputra Colony, said the small gang must have been used just as a pawn by powerful people. 

 Maya Shankar, a friend, said: It is difficult to digest that Papiya was killed just for resisting a robbery. 

 Saibal Dasgupta, a sociologist, said with property rates as high as they are in Pataliputra Colony, the robbery motive was just too simplistic.

 The agreement is modelled on the Samjhauta Express that runs between Atari and Lahore. The express will run every Saturday. It will leave Karachi and reach Khokrapar at night and cross into India and stop at Munabao in the morning. It would return to Pakistan the same day. The tentative fare is Rs 190 in Pakistan and Rs 115 in India.

 Rape backlash kills inspector

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Guna (Madhya Pradesh), Sept. 11: A Bhil kangaroo court yesterday ordered tribesmen to attack a Meena village to avenge a gangrape, setting up a clash with police that killed an inspector and a youth.

 Over 5,000 Bhils had gathered at Koniya Kala village in Guna district, 180 km from state capital Bhopal, to discuss the polices failure to arrest two Meenas accused of raping Rodibai on August 21.

 The Bhil woman was returning to her village with her brother-in-law when she was attacked. Bablu and Ramesh Meena allegedly tied her brother-in-law to a tree and took turns raping her.

 Bhil elders said a first information report had been lodged with the Chachoda police station the same day naming Bablu and Ramesh as the rapists, but the accused were still at large.

 At yesterdays community panchayat, as the village elders criticised the system for the police inaction, the younger lot bayed for blood. They suggested that the Bhils follow tribal custom and take their own revenge. Soon, the police learnt that nearly 3,000 Bhils were on their way to Puranya Kalan village, where the accused lived.

 As the police tried to stop the mob, a clash broke out, said Gwalior Range deputy inspector-general Adarsh Katiyar. The Bhils fought with sticks and sharp weapons, leaving Kumbhraj town inspector Vir Singh Sapre dead and a constable seriously injured. Police firing killed a Bhil youth.

 The Bhils marry only within their tribe. Local people said the beauty of their women often attracts men from other communities and results in violent clashes.

 Three years ago, a Bhil panchayat had shocked the state by organising the auction of a woman in Gowari village.

 According to National Crime Records Bureau files, crimes against Dalits and the Scheduled Tribes is highest in Madhya Pradesh.

 Payback time for Pawar

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 23: Barely a month after Sharad Pawar thumbed his nose at alliance partner Congress to elect industrialist Rahul Bajaj to the Rajya Sabha, it could be payback time for the NCP boss.

 But it may have come too soon since he made common cause with the BJP-Shiv Sena combine against the Congresss Avinash Pande for the upper House battle.

 As speculation on his daughter Supriya Sules bid for the Rajya Sabha gains ground, the Maharashtra strongman has to look askance at a still smarting Congress.

 Supriya (in picture), whose political career had taken off with her very public involvement in development work for backward classes and womens self-help groups, joined the NCP earlier this week.

 Her decision to join her fathers party came shortly after senior NCP leader from Pune and Rajya Sabha member Vasant Chavan died in Mumbai on July 12. Sources said the progression of events since Chavans death point to Supriya making a bid for an upper House berth.

 Pawar does not have too many options if Supriya decides to have a go. In the 288-member Maharashtra Assembly, the Congresss strength is 73 while the NCP has 71 MLAs. The Shiv Sena (58) and the BJP (54) fill the Opposition slot.

 The NCP leader would either have to turn to his irate alliance partner or can ask the BJP-Shiv Sena to return the favour he did them by backing Bajaj. But the latter, sources said, is a remote possibility.

 While Pawar must have known that his decision to side with the BJP-Shiv Sena would hardly endear him to his alliance partner, he might not have envisaged that he would have to humble himself before the Congress so soon.

 Maharashtra Congress leaders, on the other hand, are smirking at his predicament. 

 One senior minister from the state could not help being sarcastic. The party has not decided on anything. But I am sure Mr Pawar can ask his friends in the BJP and the Shiv Sena to return the favour he did them last month.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Way out of song row: skip school 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, Sept. 2: Deobands Jama Masjid chief Maulana Mohammad Arif has instructed community members to avoid sending their wards to school on September 7, the day the BJP and the Vishwa Hindu Parishad insist the song must be sung by all.

 A spokesman for the Dar-ul Uloom seminary in Deoband, 25 km from Muzaffarnagar, clarified that the Islamic school has not issued an edict against singing the song.

 But he said the seminary, which recently set off a controversy with a fatwa against taking out life insurance policies, agrees with Arifs instruction, aimed at defusing the row over the national song.

 The seminary probably because the Taliban claimed descent from the same puritanical ideals enjoys a high profile, but its influence in India is limited. The Deobandis are in a minority among Sunnis in the country.

 Arif said he took the decision after consulting senior clerics and after much thought. I thought that was the only course left open for Muslims if they dont want to be dragged into the controversy, he told The Telegraph over phone.

 I believe it would be wrong to link this to any doubt about patriotism of the Muslim community. Muslims are loyal to the nation. Do they need any certificate from anyone?

 The Vande Mataram controversy is not new to Muslims and has been effectively dealt with by Maulana Azad and other Congress stalwarts. The community agreed to accept it as a national song on the condition that they will not be forced to sing it.

 But the BJP and the VHP have been demanding that everyone sing the song on September 7, considered the 101st anniversary of the Congress adopting Vande Mataram as the national song.

 If any community thinks anything on this otherwise, they should opt for any other country but India, VHP chief Ashok Singhal said yesterday.

 Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, one of the few Muslim leaders in the BJP, observed that those who oppose Vande Mataram should leave India.

 Arif Mohammad Khan, a former BJP MP from Uttar Pradesh, translated Vande Mataram into Urdu and read it out to some Muslim clerics. There is nothing in the song that can debar Muslims from singing it, he said.

 In election-bound Uttar Pradesh, most parties are wary of bringing up the subject. Chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav has not made any statement on the issue.

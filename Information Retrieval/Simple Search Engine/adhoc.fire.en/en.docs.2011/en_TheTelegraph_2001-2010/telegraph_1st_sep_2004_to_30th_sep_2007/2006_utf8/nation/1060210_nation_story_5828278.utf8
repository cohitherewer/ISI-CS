 Nepal border alert to Delhi

 MANAN KUMAR

 New Delhi, Feb. 9: The Sashastra Seema Bal has alerted the Union home ministry about a spurt in the fundamentalist campaign against India along both sides of the Indo-Nepal border, and its links with terrorists.

 The force, which guards the 1,751-km frontier, says 820 madarsas and mosques have mushroomed on Nepalese soil within 10 km of the border along its entire length. Of these, 73 madarsas are believed to have links with anti-India elements.

 Officials of the Pakistani embassy and workers of Pakistani fundamentalist groups have been seen visiting these institutions to hand over money, the SSB report says.

 Managers of various madarsas and (the) ulema maintain close links with the Pak embassy officials at Kathmandu. Financial assistance is also channelled through the Islamic Development Bank (Jeddah). Habib Bank of Pakistan has expanded its network in the border areas, including Biratnagar and Krishna Nagar in Nepal, the report says.

 Its not a coincidence that the terrorists who carried out the attack on the Ayodhya complex last year had used the Nepal route, a senior home ministry official said. 

 With tight vigil on the western front, the fundamentalists are using the porous Indo-Bangla and Indo-Nepal borders to sneak in terrorists and explosives.

 The SSB says most of the new mosques and madarsas came up after 1998, in the Nepalese districts of Bardia, Kapilvastu and Nawalparsi bordering Kheri West, Siddharthnagar and Maharajganj in Uttar Pradesh; and in Parsa, Bara, Saptari bordering Bihars East Champaran, Sitamarhi and Supaul.

 A large number of mosques and madarsas on the Indian side, too, are hand in glove with terrorists and ISI agents and have been airing anti-India propaganda, the SSB report claims. It counts 1,172 mosques, 810 madarsas and 383 mosque-cum-madarsas close to the border on the Indian side, mainly in Siddharthnagar and Maharajganj in Uttar Pradesh and Araria, Madhubani and Kishanganj in Bihar.

 The SSB has also alerted the home ministry about the anti-India campaigns being run by the Nepal Muslim Ettehad Sangh, Islamic Sangh Nepal and Muslim Youth Organisation.

 A worried home ministry has approved a move to add six new battalions to the SSBs existing 19 on the Indo-Nepalese border. Some 450 outposts are being built, of which 259 are complete.

 There are still a few gaps left ? 51 km in Uttaranchal, 28 km in Uttar Pradesh, 66 km in Bihar and 55 km in Sikkim. But well fill them fast, a ministry official said.

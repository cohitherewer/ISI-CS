 Rs 45000 fine for power double bill

 New Delhi, Aug. 12 (PTI): A consumer court has asked power supply major BSES Rajdhani Power Limited to pay Rs 45,000 as compensation to a doctor who was deprived of electricity for two months due to double billing.

 The Delhi state consumer disputes redressal commission headed by Justice J.D. Kapoor ordered the payment of damages within a month to M. Arora.

 The court said: It is disturbing to note that the grievance of the appellant was remedied only when she filed the complaint before the district forum and not in the ordinary course.

 While allowing Aroras appeal filed against the order of the forum which had awarded Rs 25,000 as compensation, the commission enhanced it to Rs 45,000.

 In the instant case, there was a gross kind of deficiency in not restoring the electricity for two long months and that too after having detected the case of double billing.... Such an action of delinquency requires to be visited with punitive damages as contemplated by the consumer protection act.

 Arora, a resident of Janakpuri, in her complaint said that even though she had paid her dues in time, power supply to her house was disconnected in April, 2005.

 Shocked, she approached the BSES officials with the payment receipts. The officials admitted that two independent bills were wrongly issued for the same electricity connection.

 They assured Arora that her power would be restored. However, it was only after she approached the consumer forum two months later that the officials actually acted on her complaint.

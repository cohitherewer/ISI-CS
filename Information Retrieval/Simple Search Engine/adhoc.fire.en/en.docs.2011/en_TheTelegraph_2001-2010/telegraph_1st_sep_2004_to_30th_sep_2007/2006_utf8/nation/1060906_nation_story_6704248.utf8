The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Row narrows to V-word

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Kalbe Sadiq

 Lucknow, Sept. 5: All-India Muslim Personal Law Board vice-chairman and Islamic scholar Kalbe Sadiq has asked for an authoritative translation of the word Vande, as the controversy over the compulsory singing of the national song rages. 

 I am not a Sanskrit scholar. But some of the interpreters of the song told me that Vande in Sanskrit means to worship. Others say it actually means salute. If the word means to salute, Muslims should not have any problem reading or singing it, Sadiq said here.

 But Muslims need to be convinced the word does not mean worship because they can worship only one God Allah, he explained.

 On the centenary of Vande Mataram, which is being celebrated on September 7, the Centre decided that the national song would be sung in schools across the country. Although human resource development minister Arjun Singh clarified that this was not binding, some BJP-ruled states have decided to make the singing compulsory, stoking a row.

 The English translation of Vande is bow, which could be an expression of salute or worship, Sadiq said. The mention of Durga and her hands in the song appeared to suggest that the country is being seen as a Hindu deity, he said.

 However, the English-Sanskrit Dictionary, 1877, of Anundoram Barooah translates the word Vande as salute. The dictionary, reprinted in 1971, is the second lexicon to be compiled anywhere in the world after Monier Williams work of 1851.

 Hitting out at pedestrian clerics who have been interpreting the song according to their own will, Sadiq said: In every religion it is the hardliners who were responsible for watering down the credibility of their faith. 

 What I suggest is that the saner elements of both Hindu and Muslim religions should get together for an authoritative interpretation of the word Vande and get the issue resolved.

 After Friday prayers last week, the Deoband Jama Masjid chief had suggested that Muslims dont send their children to school on Thursday to keep out of the controversy. 

 Sadiq said he would not ask children not to go to school but would suggest they keep quiet when it comes to pronouncing the two words. 

 Some political parties are trying to make big issue out of this and linking it to Muslims loyalty to the country. This is condemnable. There are some Muslims leaders in BJP who lack credibility but there are good people in BJP, too. I am not a BJP loyalist. But I believe there should be an authoritative, acceptable interpretation of the word Vande, he said.

 Sadiq was referring to the Urdu translation of the song by former BJP MP Arief Mohammad Khan, who interpreted the word Vande as salute. He argued that Khan, a knowledgeable person is not, however, a Sanskrit scholar.

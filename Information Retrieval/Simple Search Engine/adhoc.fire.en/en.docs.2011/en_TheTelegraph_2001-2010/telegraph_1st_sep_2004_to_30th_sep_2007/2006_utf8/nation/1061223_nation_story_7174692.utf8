 PM puts pension on dinner table

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 22: The Prime Minister last night broached a ticklish subject at the dinner table as he and Sonia Gandhi conversed with Prakash Karat and A.B. Bardhan.

 The atmosphere was convivial, so even the pension fund regulatory bill was spoken of in light tones.

 Manmohan Singh asked the Left leaders what amendments might make the bill acceptable to them. He also mentioned that the state governments were getting restive.

 The states had accumulated money under the new pension scheme after it came into effect through an executive order in 2004, when the NDA was in power. They now did not know what to do with it. Seventeen chief ministers have petitioned the Centre, the Prime Minister said. 

 Sonia kept quiet through the discussion. So did CPM general secretary Karat.

 Bardhan, the CPI chief, was the only one who suggested a solution.

 The states can park all the accumulated money with a national infrastructure development set up by the Centre, he said. The money invested can be used to build roads, highways and airports.

 Karat nodded in agreement. The Prime Minister chose to be non-committal and Sonia still kept quiet.

 The Congress president, however, spoke on a subject that has been close to her heart the 33 per cent womens reservation bill.

 She said she was disappointed with the developments on the bill, put off once again after hopes were raised that it would be tabled in the last winter session. Sonia said she felt like joining the women who sat outside Parliament in a dharna.

 The bill, which says a third of all legislature seats should be set aside for women, is one legislation on which the Prime Minister, the Congress president and the Left are fully agreed. Not so the pension bill, which continues to be in limbo with little chance of a breakthrough.

 The bill proposes to place pension funds, now managed by the government, under a public sector entity. The Left wants the government to guarantee a 50 per cent return on the fund, which it has refused to do.

 The Centre has summoned the chief ministers to decide what to do with the money they have collected under the pension scheme. The Centre alone has collected Rs 150 crore from its employees.

 Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee wants his party to support the legislation, which would lighten the financial burden on his government.

 The CPMs central leaders, left to themselves, might have gone along with Bhattacharjee -- a possible reason why Karat chose to keep quiet at last nights dinner. But the CPMs labour arm, Citu, has held the party back.

 The Centre was keen to pass the bill last winter session. Leader of the Lok Sabha Pranab Mukherjee held a series of meetings with Left leaders, but no agreement could be reached.

New Delhi, March 3: Has India been the bigger gainer than the US in the nuclear deal that the two countries are going to sign? The size and scope of the Indian nuclear weapons programme is not affected and Indias isolation ends in terms of accessing nuclear and other high-end technologies. 

 The US only gets a measure of success in bringing India under some kind of an international non-proliferation regime and the possibility of nuclear business with India.

 US under-secretary of state for political affairs Nicholas Burns talked of two main benefits of the agreement. He said: We have never had a way to have an impact, even insight, a transparent insight into Indias nuclear programme: now we will have that. 

 The other gain, he said, would be that full civil nuclear trade will ensue.

 While the US is emphasising its non-proliferation concerns, Indian policy makers believe that besides this, there have been four compelling reasons for the Bush administration to enter into civilian nuclear cooperation with India. 

 These are: arguments about managing the emerging energy scenario; the environmental concerns about fossil fuels; political reasons for removing hurdles to an intensive engagement with India; and strategic reasons in the region.

 The energy and environment arguments which the US found quite convincing were first made by India to the European Union in 2004. India argued with the EU that in the existing oil-dependent energy scenario, if India and China continued to grow at the projected rates and their energy demand kept pace, international oil prices would go through the roof.

 The EU was told that India had decided to take the route of generating power through nuclear energy. This would decrease oil dependency and nuclear energy was relatively cleaner than burning fossil fuels. There were environmental advantages of taking the nuclear route.

 The EU apparently chose to look at the argument in energy and environment terms and not in political terms. The breakthrough with the EU came when Prime Minister Manmohan Singh went to The Hague for the India-EU Summit in 2004. 

 India made a bid for joining the International Thermo-Nuclear Experimental Reactor project and an Indo-EU Energy Panel was also set up. In November 2004, the then US national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, was apprised of the development with the EU. She was excited about the idea as it came at a time when the US itself was taking a relook at nuclear energy.

 This led to the setting up of an energy dialogue with the US, followed the next summer by the July 18 joint statement by President George W. Bush and Singh on civilian nuclear cooperation.

 The political argument for the civilian nuclear deal, the Indian side believes, was that the US wanted to engage with an India growing economically at 7 to 8 per cent per year. It was a vast market with tremendous potential for technical and knowledge-based cooperation. 

 Yet, what came in its way was the whole edifice of a technology denial regime constructed against India since 1974 when it conducted its first nuclear test. All technology denial regimes against India in high-technology fields whether space or other dual-use areas had their roots in the nuclear issue. 

 If the US wanted a deeper engagement, these technology denial regimes had to be dismantled. This was done by taking India on board as a partner in the field of nuclear technology. 

 Lastly, analysts here believe that there was also a strategic argument for the nuclear deal. The US needs India for reasons of balance in this region. If the US was looking for a new balance of power emerging in this region, then only India, because of its economic size, democratic policy and technological capability, could be its most reliable partner.

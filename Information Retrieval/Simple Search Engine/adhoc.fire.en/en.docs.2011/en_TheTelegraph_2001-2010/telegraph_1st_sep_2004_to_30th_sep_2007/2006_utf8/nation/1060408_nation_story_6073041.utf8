The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Deadline ends, but CAS still in a bind

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 7: Delhi High Courts deadline for the implementation of the conditional access system (CAS) ended today but it is still not clear how the Centre plans to go about it.

 Information and broadcasting secretary S.K. Arora held a four-hour meeting with representatives of the cable television industry on implementing CAS in Delhi, Calcutta and Mumbai.

 This was the fourth such meeting he has held since March 10, when the high Court ordered the government to implement CAS within four weeks.

 Reminded of the deadline, Arora told reporters that the I amp;B ministry would take appropriate action. He said it was trying to get the opinion of all stakeholders.

 If CAS is implemented in the three metros ? as it has already been in Chennai ? viewers will get satellite channels through a set-top box. They would then have to pay only for the channels they choose to watch. But they would need to buy the box unless their cable operator provides one.

 Speculations are rife that the appropriate action the I amp;B secretary has planned is going to court, perhaps immediately after this weekend, and telling it about the progress made so far. Then, he would probably ask for more time for the implementation of CAS.

 Cable operators, including multi-system operators, appear to have arrived at a consensus of sorts with the government. They have told the I amp;B ministry that once a decision is taken, they would switch over to CAS in about eight months.

 But broadcasters, particularly foreign channels, seem to be maintaining a distance. 

 Cable operators have been complaining that the broadcasters are not saying how much they would charge for the channels. Roop Sharma, who heads the Cable Operators Federation of India, said the foreign broadcasters are boycotting the meetings.

 The broadcasters would rather specify monthly rates for a bouquet of channels. Cable operators are also worried that if CAS ends up raising monthly cable charges, it might drive them out of business. 

 After todays meeting, some cable representatives cried foul at the governments bias and said it was not putting enough pressure on the broadcasters.

 There is, however, a possibility that the government will deal with the broadcasters simply by fixing a maximum retail price. The price could be set for each channel, ensuring that an average household does not pay more than, say, Rs 250.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Abracadabra! Its a letter from Tata

 OUR BUREAU

 Ratan Tata

 Calcutta, May 11: Very dramatic it was, some might even say stage-managed.

 As a beaming Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee answered questions at a post-victory news conference, one of his aides stuck a piece of paper in his direction.

 The chief minister took it, read it and acted coy. Its a letter from Ratan Tata, he said, but I cant tell you more. An announcement will be made shortly.

 He did say more, though, by and by. For example, he revealed that Ravi Kant, Tata Motors managing director, was coming to see him tomorrow. 

 Its a proposal. I cant tell you now what it is. I have a very busy schedule tomorrow. But still I will go to Writers Buildings for half an hour for this, Bhattacharjee said, breaking into a wide smile. But I cant tell you any more.

 Tata Motors has been evaluating sites in Bengal to set up its small-car plant. The letter might have carried confirmation of the decision to locate the factory to make the so-called Rs 1 lakh car in the state.

 The Rs 1,000-crore unit is expected to come up at Guptamani near Kalaikunda in Midnapore. The Tatas looked at sites at Haldia and Baruipur, too.

 The choice of Bengal for the project had been kept under wraps for fear of incurring the Election Commissions wrath. Now that the results are known, negotiations on another large project are expected to be concluded.

 Infosys wants to set up its next development centre in Bengal. Now that the election is over, things should move fast. The preliminary talks should move towards finality, an Infosys official said.

 While Tata Motors and Infosys have progressed far with their plans, they are not the only big names coming to Bengal. Mukesh Ambanis Reliance will roll out its retail venture in four towns, including Calcutta and Haldia. 

 Pharmaceuticals company Dabur will set up a plant in north Bengal. There is also a proposal to set up a compressed natural gas station in Haldia which has also been chosen by the Centre for a submarine cable landing station.

 Once the station comes up, IT companies will get access to wider bandwidth, which is like a communication highway, and their costs will drop 20 per cent.

 Still, infrastructure remains a concern for IT and other companies. Sector V in Salt Lake ? home to all big IT companies ? will reach saturation point in the next one year. The government must improve this. At the same time, there is need to move out of Calcutta to smaller towns, an IT executive said.

 Not land alone, labour is a concern, too. They (labour) must be more cooperative and responsible. The message from the top now should translate into action at the ground level, said Pawan Ruia, chairman of Dunlop and Jessop.

 Most business leaders want to see faster implementation of policies.

 Industrial tempo has not gone up much in Bengal. But the chief minister is an outstanding person. I am sure it will change now, Basant Kumar Birla, the chairman of the BK Birla Group, said.

 Sanjeev Goenka, vice-chairman of RPG Enterprises, agreed.

 Now that the development agenda has been mandated by the people, the pace will pick up.

 Sanjay Budhia, the managing director of Patton, said: Files should move fast.

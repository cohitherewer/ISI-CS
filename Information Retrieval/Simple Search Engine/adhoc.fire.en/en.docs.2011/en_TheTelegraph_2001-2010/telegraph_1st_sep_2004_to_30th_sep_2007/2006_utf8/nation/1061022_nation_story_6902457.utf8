 Killer jawan rampage

 Jammu, Oct. 21: An army 

 jawan today shot dead three colleagues and wounded three 

 before killing himself with his service rifle, reports our 

 correspondent. 

 This is the latest incident among several in Jammu and Kashmir in which soldiers frustrated with their lifestyles have killed themselves.

 The jawan, whose identity has not been disclosed, shot his colleagues while they were sleeping in their barracks at Narani in Rajouri, about 180 km northwest of Jammu, early this morning. 

 Three soldiers died on the spot while the others were critically wounded. The injured have been taken to the military hospital at Rajouri. 

 After shooting his colleagues, the jawan shot himself. He died soon after. 

 The provocation for this drastic act is not immediately known, defence spokesman Lt Col R.K. Chhibber said. Army sources said the jawan may have had domestic problems. 

 A court of inquiry has been instituted.

 Salman witnesss turn to back out

 Mumbai, Dec. 20 (PTI): A prime witness in the hit-and-run case involving actor Salman Khan today did not support the prosecution in the trial court and was declared hostile.

 Mohammed Muslim Niyat Shaikh, who was injured when the actor allegedly rammed his car into a bakery in September 2002, told the court that he had not seen the person at the wheel of the car as he was injured and people had surrounded him.

 The prosecution declared him hostile and Salmans lawyer Dipesh Mehta then cross-examined him. The witness told Mehta that he could not see the person driving the car when the accident took place because his leg was injured.

 The prosecution would examine another witness, also injured in the accident, on January 3.

 One was killed and four were injured in the accident.

 Of a total of 60 witnesses, six have already deposed. Among them were Ravindra Patil and Ramasray Pandey. Patil was Salmans bodyguard and was with him when the accident took place. Pandey was sleeping in a shop adjacent to the site of the accident.

 The third witness was the one who had prepared the panchnama at the site and the fourth was Shaikh Ibrahim, cousin of the deceased, Narulla Salim Shaikh. The fifth, Mohammed Abdul Rauf Shaikh, had deposed on June 29.

 Earlier, witness Mohammed Abdul Rauf Shaikh had contradicted his police statement during his deposition saying he and a few others were sleeping on the footpath when a car rammed into the bakery injuring them.

 While giving evidence, Shaikh had disowned a crucial portion of his police statement, saying he had not seen Salman getting down from the drivers seat. 

 Shaikh told the court he had heard people saying Salman had come out of the car but he himself did not see the actor as he was underneath the vehicle.

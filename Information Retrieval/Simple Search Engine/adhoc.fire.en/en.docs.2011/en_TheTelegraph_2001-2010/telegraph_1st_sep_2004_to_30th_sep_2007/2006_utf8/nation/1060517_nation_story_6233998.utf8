 12 die in Maoist mistake

 OUR BUREAU

 May 16: In another case of mistaken identity, Maoists blew up a private jeep thinking it to be a police vehicle, killing 12 members of a marriage party in the wee hours today.

 The attack took place between Halebada and Patha villages in Maharashtras Gadchiroli district, around 10 km from the Chhattisgarh border, when a group of marriage revellers was returning to the Pakhanjore camp for Bangladeshi settlers in Kanker district. 

 Kanker superintendent of police Pradeep Gupta said the marriage of Savitavrat Rai from the Pakhanjore camp was solemnised with Bindu Mandal in Mulchera village of Sundernagar, around 60 km from the Gadchiroli district headquarters, last night. 

 The revellers were returning to Pakhanjore in a convoy of three jeeps and a Maruti when a powerful landmine explosion blew up one of the vehicles around 4.30 am today. 

 The impact of the explosion was so severe that the jeep went 20 feet in the air and landed in pieces, killing all 12 persons (eight men and four women) on board, the police official said. 

 The victims were identified as Subrat Roy, Amit Vrat, Sachin Hajari, Arun Sarkar, Mamta Badai, Sushila, Harinandan Sarkar, Chanchala Rai, Nitish Karmakar, Sukhdeo Mistry, Sudha and Gabbar. All 12 were residents of Pakhanjore village no. 3 in the settlement camp.

 The bride and groom escaped unhurt as they were travelling in the Maruti. Those in the other two jeeps were also unhurt.

 Gadchiroli superintendent of police Shirish Jain and additional SP A. Rokade rushed to the blast site. A search operation was also launched in the area to trace the Maoists. 

 Investigation is on. It appears that they (Maoists) misjudged the vehicles to be a police convoy, which usually moves in the early hours for operations, a senior officer from the anti-Naxalite cell in Gadchiroli told The Telegraph.

 This is the second time the Maoists have killed civilians after mistaking them for policemen. On March 24, the rebels blew up a jeep full of traders and porters near Pakhanjore, killing 13 persons.

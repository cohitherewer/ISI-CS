 Curtains on envoy drama

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 19: The government today named a new high commissioner to New Zealand to replace the defiant Harish Kumar Dogra, who continued to stay in Wellington even after he was recalled.

 Senior IFS officer K.P Ernest, additional secretary (policy planning and research) in the ministry of external affairs, will take Dogras place.

 Dogra had relinquished his charge to deputy high commissioner Tika Jatav before going on leave but refused to surrender the post.

 The foreign ministry showed urgency in appointing the new high commissioner to avoid further embarrassment. The row with Dogra was getting murkier with New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clarke commenting adversely on it. The situation is most unusual, she had said. 

 The controversy had left New Zealand bemused as India did not inform it that Dogra had lost his job, and Wellington continued to treat him as the high commissioner.

 Delhi swung into action and cancelled Dogras accreditation yesterday. The foreign ministry conveyed Ernests appointment to the New Zealand foreign office and its high commission in Delhi.

 The move came even as a senior IFS officer is in New Zealand to persuade Dogra to return. 

 Recalled on March 1, the diplomat was asked to report back to foreign ministry headquarters in Delhi. He was served the recall order under Indian foreign services (pay, leave and compensatory allowances) rules.

 The ministry said Dogra had indicated that he would return on April 1. The date of his arrival was then extended to April 15, said ministry spokesperson Navtej Sarna. But the officer did not turn up.

 Dogra has approached the central administrative tribunal seeking relief. Rejecting the recall order, he had launched a direct attack against foreign secretary Shyam Saran, holding him responsible for his conduct.

 Sources said Dogra was recalled on the complaints of some members of the Indian community who were denied visa. According to officials, Dogra had sent a report to the foreign ministry, giving the reasons why he had refused visa.

 In his eight-page letter to Saran that was leaked to the media, Dogra accused the foreign secretary of bringing shame to the country. He also refused to return till Saran was foreign secretary. Saran is due to retire in September this year. 

 Dogras grudge against the foreign secretary was that he was not given a chance to explain his position in violation of the basic principle of natural justice.

 Officials said the tug-of-war between Saran and Dogra caused embarrassment to the government as it was widely covered by the New Zealand media.

 Media trial angers riot judge

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Ahmedabad, Dec. 8: Gujarat High Court today rapped riot-hit families for trying to pressure it through a media trial and refused to transfer a massacre case to the CBI.

 The families of the victims, whose bodies were discovered in a mass grave near Lunawada town, had held a news conference on Wednesday along with rights activist Teesta Setalvads Citizens for Justice and Peace (CJP).

 On merit, you have no case at all. That is why you want to pressurise the court through the media, Justice Kalpesh Zaveri told the families and CJP.

 This has to stop, or else I will issue a contempt notice. Genuine social workers do not go to the media. You just want cheap publicity.

 The judge dismissed the petition on the ground that the CBI had not approached the court though it had received the DNA test reports on the bodies eight months ago.

 The mass grave with 21 bodies had been dug up on December 27 last year by some citizens, with the CJP playing a leading part, at Pandarwada in Panchmahal district.

 Amid suspicions that the state police might have buried riot victims there, the Congress-led Centre goaded the Narendra Modi government to investigate the matter and report to it.

 The CBI was given the task of supervising DNA matches between samples from the corpses and people from the area who lost close relatives in the February-March 2002 pogrom.

 The state government has told the court that the report from the Hyderabad-based Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics shows only six sample matches. CJP and the families claim that nine samples matched.

 Setalvad and her field co-ordinator in Gujarat, Raees Khan, were in court on Wednesday but neither turned up today, apparently having sensed trouble. The riot victims counsel, Md Suhail Timirizi, told the court his clients had not consulted him before talking to the media about the sub judice matter.

 The judge shot back: Why do you not retire from this case if your clients do not consult you?

 He added that he was not issuing a contempt notice this time as the petitioners had not made any adverse comments on the court before the media.

 Justice Zaveri held out a ray of hope for the petitioners, saying he would consider the matter if the CBI approached him. 

 CBI counsel Yogesh Ravani said the agency hadnt asked him to approach the court and seek a transfer.

 Aminabibi Rasool, who believes her son was buried in the mass grave, said she would move the Supreme Court to have the case handed over to the CBI.

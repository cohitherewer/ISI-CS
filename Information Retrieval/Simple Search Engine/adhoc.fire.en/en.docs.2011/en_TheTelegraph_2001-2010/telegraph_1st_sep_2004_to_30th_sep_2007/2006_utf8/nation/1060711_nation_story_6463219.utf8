 Sonia Gandhi: Divestment dilemma

 New Delhi, July 10: A section of the Congress feels that the party should iron out internal contradictions and misgivings on divestment before Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and party president Sonia Gandhi meet allies to elicit their views.

 A senior leader said it was important to reach some kind of an inner ideological and policy resolution on divestment ? Singh has said they will be put on hold ? because the Congress fears losing face if the party voices what it considers its collective and considered view and some member of the Left-of-centre school publicly contradicts the stand.

 Until this is over and done with, he said, it is pointless to float ideas such as holding more frequent meetings of the partys core committee or evolving additional coordination mechanisms with the constituents.

 The Congresss thinking was reflected in the first briefing on the matter by its chief spokesperson Satyavrat Chaturvedi today. He stressed that the process of economic liberalisation and reforms was not going to be put on hold. We will ensure that our (UPA) constituents will support us adequately on this.

 Though the spokesperson justified the decision to freeze divestment because allies had reservations, he said foreign direct investment was important. We want to create an environment for economic growth and development.

 Chaturvedi, who was briefed by Congress leaders to try and quell the speculation of a Prime Minster-party face-off, said Singh was not acting under pressure. 

 Asked why the Nalco divestment was opposed by the Congress ? both in the recently-held Congress Working Committee meeting and outside ? Chaturvedi initially hedged. He finally said: As a policy in the UPAs national common minimum programme that all the constituents agreed on, we feel that some percentage of the shares (of a public sector company) could be divested but the government should retain the majority of the shares. In specific cases, if there are reservations and objections, we will keep these in mind and hold consultations.

 Chaturvedi added that after considering all the views, a decision within the large framework of national interest would be taken.

 Sources said Singh, finance minister P. Chidambaram and defence minister Pranab Mukherjee believe that unless divestment goes full steam ahead, the government will run out of money to finance the ambitious social sector initiatives it has launched. 

 The Prime Minister reportedly raised this before the Congress president when he met her at his residence last Friday.

 She was told that at least Rs 50,000 crore would be required to fund the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, the Urban Renewal Mission and the mid-day meal scheme, and an additional Rs 9,000 crore to meet expenses arising out of the proposed policy on reservation for other backward classes in higher education.

 Sonia is yet to be convinced of this reasoning. 

 According to sources, she feels that if a party or a single constituent is uncomfortable about divestment, it should not be pursued.

 Call for private role in social sector

 Subhajit Banerjee

 Chidambaram 

 New Delhi, Feb .1: Finance minister P. Chidambaram today called for greater private sector participation for India to meet the Millennium Development Goals, particularly on water. 

 There are not enough private initiatives in several development areas, which, perhaps, is also the governments fault. We need to develop indigenous models where the private sector can work together with government agencies, Chidambaram said.

 He was addressing the CEO Forum curtain raiser of the Delhi Sustainable Development Summit 2006, organised by The Energy Research Institute (TERI) in the capital. 

 The Millennium Development Goals are eight objectives UN member-states have agreed to try to achieve by 2015 in areas such as poverty, education, gender equality, HIV/AIDS and the environment. 

 Out of the eight MDGs, we would be able to achieve at least two to three. In the absence of funds, it is unlikely that we will achieve the rest. For instance, in water, even to build small dams and restore, repair and renovate water-bodies, we need money and without water there is no sanitation. But there hasnt been a public private partnership model in the case of water, which brings together private sector and the government, Chidambaram said.

 Water, which is key to rural Indias sustainability, is becoming a scarcer and scarcer commodity. As someone said, the next war will be fought over water and not over territory. I urge you to be aware of the growing criticality of water shortage.

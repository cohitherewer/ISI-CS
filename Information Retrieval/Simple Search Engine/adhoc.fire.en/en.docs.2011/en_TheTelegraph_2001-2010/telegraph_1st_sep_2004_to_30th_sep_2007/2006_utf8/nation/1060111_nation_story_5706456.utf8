 Saif case

 Mumbai, Jan. 10 (PTI): Actor Saif Ali Khan today appeared before the customs department to answer the charges of duty evasion on an imported Toyota Lexus.

 The car was allegedly imported under the Transfer of Residence Rules by Kolangara Mamunhi Mohammed who came to Mumbai from Dubai. 

 If it is found that the actor had purchased the car from Mohammed then it would violate the rules and Khan would face action, sources said.

 Under the law, only NRIs can bring their cars from abroad on relocation.

 Self-help suffers in job focus

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Facing Hurdles in progress path

 New Delhi, April 23: The governments preoccupation with generating jobs in villages is threatening the future of what is considered the backbone of the rural poverty alleviation drive.

 The Swarnajayanti Gram Swarojgar Yojna ? the Centres flagship self-employment programme aimed at bringing the rural poor above the poverty line ? is on the verge of collapse.

 Thousands of self-help groups formed under the swarojgar yojna, which was launched in 1999, are waiting for government assistance and often dying out in the absence of any.

 The central allocations have not been able to keep pace with the progress of the programme. As a result, there is substantial backlog of assistance to be provided to the beneficiaries of this programme, rural development minister Raghuvansh Prasad Singh has told the Planning Commission.

 In his letter to deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia last week, Singh said 7.13 lakh self-help groups which are eligible for revolving fund, an incentive the government gives, and 2.91 lakh that are eligible for economic assistance are waiting for central allocation. The total funds required for these two assistances to SHGs come to Rs 4,354.25 crore in the current financial year, he added.

 While wage-oriented employment programmes provide for short-term financial gains, self-employment schemes ensure long-term benefits. The swarojgar yojna, which succeeded the Integrated Rural Development Programme, envisages training and involvement of the rural poor through a mix of government subsidy and credit, thus helping them cross the poverty line.

 The self-employment concept took some time to take off, but once self-help groups began to be formed in different parts of the country, the programme picked up pace. So, scarcity of resources at a time when the scheme is in full swing could hit it hard.

 So far, 22.44 lakh self-help groups have been formed under the swarojgar yojna. Of them, 13.09 lakh have passed grade I, which means they are eligible for revolving fund; 5.96 lakh have passed grade II (eligible for economic assistance), and the rest have either started or are about to begin some gainful economic activity.

 Besides requesting Ahluwalia to provide for resources to meet the backlog, Singh also asked the Planning Commission to devise a plan to cover all the rural poor under the self-help group movement by the end of the Eleventh Five-Year Plan.

 It is now appropriate time for the government to plan for coverage of all rural poor families under (the) SHG movement for eradication of poverty, the minister said.

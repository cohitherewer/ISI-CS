 Pak rush to scrub taint

 IMTIAZ GUL AND OUR DELHI BUREAU

 Islamabad, Oct. 9: Islamabad today scrambled to deny any link between North Koreas nuclear test and the architect of the Pakistani bomb, Dr Abdul Qadeer Khan.

 Three years ago, the UN watchdog, International Atomic Energy Agency, had accused Khan of supplying nuclear technology to North Korea, Iran and Libya.

 There is absolutely no link between the nuclear test conducted by North Korea and what might have gone on (between) Dr A.Q. Khan and the North Korean government, PTI quoted foreign office spokeswoman Tasnim Aslam as saying in Islamabad.

 North Koreas nuclear programme is plutonium-based and Pakistans programme is mainly uranium-based.

 But experts said it was unclear whether todays test was part of a uranium-based or plutonium-based programme.

 A recent analysis by the Washington-based Institute for Science and International Security had concluded that Pyongyang might possess enough separated plutonium to develop a credible nuclear arsenal. Officials also spoke of fears that Pyongyang has an undisclosed uranium programme.

 President Pervez Musharraf, in his recently published memoirs In The Line of Fire, has mentioned Khan transferring two dozen centrifuges to North Korea.

 Musharraf admitted that the scientist had also provided special oils for centrifuges and training on centrifuge technology, which included visits to top-secret centrifuge plants.

 North Koreas alleged clandestine nuclear ties with Pakistan have always worried India. Although Delhi and Pyongyang share friendly diplomatic ties, suspicion has crept in of late. There hasnt been any high-level contact between the two sides for several years.

 North Korea sees India as a new ally of the US. For Delhi, Pyongyangs proximity to Islamabad and Beijing is a concern. The trilateral partnership is believed to have helped Pakistan build its missile capability as a trade-off for supplying nuclear technology.

 Aslam deplored the North Korean test, saying it might have a chain reaction, which nobody wanted. 

 She denied any similarities between the circumstances that led Pyongyang and Islamabad to conduct nuclear tests.

 We were forced to go nuclear following threats to our security by the nuclear-armed India. Pakistans programme was purely in self-defence whereas Korean peninsula is a nuclear weapons-free zone, Aslam said.

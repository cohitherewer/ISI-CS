 Student fights Jaya exam law

 Jayalalithaa: In trouble

 Chennai, Feb. 13: A Plus Two student of a CBSE school has challenged a legislation bro-ught by Jayalalithaa exempting state board students from appearing for common entrance tests for admission to professional courses.

 The Tamil Nadu Regulation of Admission in Professional Courses Act, 2006, which requires students of all other boards to appear for the CET, has already got governor S.S. Barnalas go-ahead. 

 But Nishant Ramesh, who studies under the Central Board of Secondary Education, today challenged the validity of the legislation in Madras High Court, asking it to declare the act illegal, unconstitutional and without legislative competence. 

 The professional courses act was passed by the Tamil Nadu government in the last Assembly session.

 The petition was filed by Nishants mother on her wards behalf as the student is still a minor. 

 It said the new act for admission to professional courses in Tamil Nadu was discriminatory and violated judgments of the Supreme Court and Madras High Court which have held that the common entrance test was essential and cannot be dispensed with. 

 In the interim, the students petition sought a directive to restrain the Tamil Nadu education secretary, who has been made respondent in the plea, from going ahead with the selection and admission of candidates for the fresh academic year under the new act. 

 When the petition came up for hearing before the first bench of the high court, comprising Chief Justice A.P. Shaw and Justice Prabha Sreedevan, Shaw admitted that students should not be put through such inconvenience and hardship brought about by this kind of legislation. 

 Asserting that it was the student communitys interests as a whole which were most important, the chief justice said they should not be kept in suspense in such matters.

 Shaw also mentioned that the act was yet to come into force as the rules were yet to be framed. 

 He pointed to a Supreme Court judgment that laid down that even bills could be challenged in court. 

 The next hearing is on February 21.

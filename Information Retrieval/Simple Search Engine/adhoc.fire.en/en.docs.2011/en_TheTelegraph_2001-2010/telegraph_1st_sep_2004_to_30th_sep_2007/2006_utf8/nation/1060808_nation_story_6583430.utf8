 First of 3 letters nailed Natwar

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 7: The Pathak committee, which mainly relied on three letters to indict Natwar Singh in the oil-for-food scam, has said the veteran leaders first missive to the Iraqi oil minister in January 2001 was crucial evidence to link him to the scandal.

 The fact that Natwar Singh met the oil minister, Government of Iraq, Dr Amer Mohammed Rasheed, on January 22, 2001, along with Andaleeb Sehgal is borne out by a letter written by Natwar Singh himself on January 30, 2001, the probe panel said in its report.

 The committee said Natwars letter, seeking full cooperation for Sehgal, a relative, showed that the former foreign minister was in Iraq not merely to represent the Congress in a goodwill mission. He also used his presence to help Sehgal, who accompanied him, procure the oil allocation.

 I am sending this letter with Andaleeb Sehgal. He was present when I called on you on January 22, 2001, at your office in Baghdad. He enjoys my full support and confidence and I would appreciate you giving him your full assistance and cooperation, Natwars letter said.

 Although Natwar admitted that the signature was his, he said he was not sure about the text. 

 The Pathak authority, however, feels that the letter was also written by him because not only the signature but also the words with regards were written in hand and that Natwar had admitted that it was his own handwriting.

 The authority further pointed out that Sehgal, during his deposition, admitted to have taken Natwars letter to Iraq. 

 Jagats presence at the same meeting is established by another letter written on April 26, 2001, the report said, adding that the missive, sent through Jagat, said he (Jagat) and his cousin Sehgal were with him (Natwar) when he called on the oil minister.

 Natwar, however, denied during his deposition that Sehgal was Jagats cousin and said he did not remember having written any such letter, while Jagat and Sehgal said they did not travel to Iraq together. 

 The Indian ambassador to Aman, however, recalled that both had sought his help to go to Baghdad around that time.

 Natwar again sent a letter through Sehgal on August 11, 2001, to congratulate the minister on the re-election of Saddam Hussein as leader of the Baath Socialist Party. In this letter he said Sehgal had come to Baghdad to continue the cooperation extended by yourself.

 It was known at that time that the Iraqi government did not deal with any stranger and did not permit any one apart from persons who had been approved by them to deal in oil, the report said.

 It said Natwar and Jagat so projected themselves that Iraqi authorities formed the impression that they were representatives of the Congress. 

 The authority noted that Natwar wrote the letters on the official letter head of the All India Congress Committee showing himself as chairman of the foreign affairs department, while the address mentioned was 24, Akbar Road, New Delhi, the party headquarters.

 The Pathak panel, however, said there is not a shred of evidence to link the party to the transactions.

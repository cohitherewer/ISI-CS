 Army unable to bail out govt

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 17: The Armed Forces Medical Corps have told the Centre military doctors cannot be posted to government hospitals if civilian doctors go on strike in protest against moves to increase reservation for backward classes in medical colleges.

 Health minister Anbumani Ramadoss is understood to have asked the defence ministry for assistance with doctors and support staff if doctors and staff in government medical colleges and hospitals abstain from work to participate in the anti-quota movement.

 The director-general of the Armed Forces Medical Corps is understood to have informed the Centre that for emergency and life-saving situations, facilities in defence hospitals will be open for civilians.

 An officer said there are only two defence hospitals in the capital ? the army base hospital and the Army Research and Referral (Speciality) Hospital in the Delhi cantonment as most armed forces personnel stayed there. But there are five major government hospitals in the city.

 The medical corps has about 5,000 doctor officers across the country of whom nearly 2,000 are in active field and forward postings who cannot be withdrawn from these areas. 

 Another 1,000 doctors are either going through specialised courses or on leave. This means only about 2,000 doctors are in military hospitals that are not in forward areas.

 Our support to the health administration can be very limited. It will be difficult to post our doctors and support staff in civilian hospitals but our emergency services are on offer, the officer said.

 PC in budget warm-up with MPs

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 14: Finance minister P. Chidambaram kicked off his pre-budget consultations with a meeting where he heard what the Congress MPs had to say.

 The talks expected to be followed by at least two more rounds with these MPs and Congress office-bearers came two days after the party working committee voiced concern over spiralling prices and the failure of the much-touted 9 per cent growth rate to make a difference to the aam admi.

 Sources said Chidambaram heard them out without saying a word. Rahul Gandhi was present, too, but said nothing.

 One of the suggestions was to set up a minorities welfare corporation, modelled on the lines of a Malaysian agency where state intervention is minimal. The government gives its share of funds, but so do affluent sections. Part of the money is invested to earn interest, but almost the entire sum is spent on the welfare of the poor. A trust, with state representatives, runs the show.

 There was a call to float similar welfare institutions for Dalits, tribals and other backward classes. The MPs also spoke of the need to broad-base the participation. The SC/ST and OBC corporations are starved of funds, said Pravin Rashtrapal, a Rajya Sabha MP from Gujarat.

 Others said states like Punjab (ruled by the Congress), which set aside a disproportionately small share of their budget for the welfare of the Dalits 5 per cent although they make up 30 per cent of the population should be taken to task. The Prime Ministers Office and the finance ministry, they said, should create cells to monitor the spending on Dalits and tribals.

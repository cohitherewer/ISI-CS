 - Neighbours to share probe information

 Test case: A train compartment ripped apart by the July blasts in Mumbai

 New Delhi, Sept. 19: The joint mechanism to fight terrorism agreed by India and Pakistan in Havana is expected to focus on exchanging live information about investigation. 

 Although the modalities of the new mechanism, which has deeply divided the security establishment, are still being worked out, sources said there might not be any direct exchanges between the intelligence agencies of the two countries.

 The focus will be on investigation of crime. The investigating agencies, the CBI in India, can pass on leads to their counterpart in Pakistan for follow-up action, said officials. The finer details of the proposal will be worked out when foreign secretaries of the two countries meet in Delhi next month. 

 Under the composite dialogue process, the two sides already have a mechanism to cooperate in tackling crime and terrorism. The CBI and its Pakistani counterpart, the Federal Intelligence Agency (FIA), held discussions on subjects like human trafficking, counterfeit currency and illegal immigration earlier this year.

 The officials said the focus of these talks was mainly on Interpol references in each country. The CBIs list of Interpol references has over 100 names, including that of Bombay serial blasts accused Dawood Ibrahim. 

 They explained that the new mechanism would take the arrangement forward and include sharing of investigative material. This means that Pakistani agencies can be asked to follow up on traces of telephone calls or other information about suspects. 

 The test case of cooperation will be the July Mumbai blasts probe and the hijack of the Indian Airlines plane from Kathmandu to Kandahar in December 1999 where Indian agencies claim they have clues tracing links to Pakistan.

 The two sides had already agreed to appoint an officer each as the nodal point to cement cooperation between the CBI and FIA. Indian officials pointed out that lack of trust is going to be the biggest obstacle to cooperation. 

 For years, Indian and Pakistani intelligence agencies have worked at cross-purposes. 

 Delhi is trying hard to explain that the idea of the joint mechanism did not originate in Pakistan. A section in the Indian intelligence establishment wants to involve Islamabad in tackling crime instead of carrying on with the blame game, which has not yielded any result.

 IIM and Left: why the two now need each other

 MONOBINA GUPTA AND BASANT RAWAT

 Yechury and Karat: Grooming managers? 

 New Delhi/Ahmedabad, Dec. 27: The Marxists want the IIM as much as the IIMs Left adventurists seem to want the Marxists.

 Come summer, and the CPM headquarters will witness a rare sight: a posse of interns from the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, sitting under the giant portraits of Marx and Lenin to take lessons from party boss Prakash Karat.

 And the CPM leaders are flattered.

 Its a positive development, central committee member Nilotpal Basu said. That IIM students want to come to the CPM headquarters shows growing awareness about the Left.

 Even a couple of years ago, the market-unfriendly die-hards at Delhis A.K. Gopalan Bhavan would have cringed at the thought of hosting students from the countrys most elitist B-school.

 Today, the CPM sees it as an opportunity to not only shed its image of a dogmatic, orthodox organisation but also gain an upmarket gloss.

 The B-school is no less excited. Even faculty members and fellow students were stunned when, after a lecture-cum-interaction with Sitaram Yechury on December 9, six students walked up to the CPM leader and asked to do their summer internship with him.

 It was a first at the bastion of market capitalism, where the favourite choices for the eight-week internship have always been the corporate world, followed by NGOs and state-run companies.

 With the names of the students being kept a secret, their peers like Rahul Roushan are curious to know who they are and what exactly they want to do.

 But if Roushan is unsure whether its a smart career move, institute director Bakul Dholakia has no doubt that it is.

 The Left is becoming increasingly relevant not just in India (where the key government allies can tailor or veto policies). In China, Brazil, Bolivia and now Nepal Left parties play a big role in policy formation, he said.

 Dholakia believes many multinationals will prefer B-school graduates with exposure to the Lefts ideology and style of functioning.

 That understanding will be crucial for formulating business strategy not only in India but in Brazil, China and Russia who are likely to dominate the world economic order in the next 20 years and where investment is likely to flow.

 For the students, the key attraction is not the Left ideology itself but the CPMs recent experiments with it.

 In Bengal, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee is desperate to gain credence for his capital-friendly face. The IIM students want to know more about this change, CPM leader Basu said.

 They want to know how, in the last two-and-a-half years, we have evolved alternative approaches to many of the Centres key policies, like those on FDI and SEZs. The students want to pick party leaders brains and tap their intellectual resources.

 The publicity suits the CPM at a time when Bhattacharjee is trying to distance himself from party labour arm Citus hawkishness.

 A corporate-savvy face would reassure investors eyeing Bengal. In Delhi, it gives the Marxists just the image they need friends to the haves as well as the have-nots.

 The party hasnt decided how to tutor the B-school students. Leaders, MPs and academics close to the CPM might take informal classes. The interns may be taken on a trip to Bengal.

 Things will take shape only after January 15, the last day for deciding the internships. After the stint, the students will prepare a report and make a presentation.

 Will they come back deeply impressed, or will they raise uncomfortable questions in Delhi about the party? Either way, its going to be significant, an IIM teacher said.

 CBI knocks, but officer off on trip

 New Delhi (PTI): Senior IFS official Rakesh Kumar, allegedly involved in human trafficking, has gone to Rishikesh to recuperate after a fortnight in a German hospital, a team of CBI officials were told by the diplomats kin.

 The CBI team had gone to his residence in south Delhi on Monday afternoon to serve a notice on him.

 Earlier this month, Kumar had stopped at Munich on his way back to India from Brazil, where he was accompanying minister of state for external affairs Anand Sharma, and got himself admitted to a hospital in the German city.

 The CBI on Monday served the notice under Section 160 of the CrPC under which the agency can ask any suspect to appear before it for questioning. Last week, the CBI had sent a similar notice to the external affairs ministry asking it to direct Kumar to appear before it.

 The bureau registered an FIR against Kumar and three others after nine members of a 15-strong dance troupe went missing after they reached Berlin. 

 Cigarette blast in Kashmir

 Jammu (PTI): An explosive-filled cigarette that injured 

a civilian on Sunday night has led to the suspicion that terrorists in Jammu and 

Kashmir are deviating from their usual attack techniques and are working on other 

ways to target people.

 Militants are now using explosive-filled cigarettes to carry out blasts in Jammu and Kashmir. One such cigarette has been recovered last night, Colonel D.K. Badola, heading the 16 Corp media centre, said.

 A civilian, Hansraj Thakkar of Mislai village found two Capstan cigarettes in the village and ignited one for smoking. It exploded causing injuries to his right hand, Badola said. This was for the first time that a cigarette filled with explosive has been recovered from this area.

Muthulakshmi has filed her nomination as an Independent candidate from Tamil Nadus 

Pennagaram Assembly seat.

 Mystery balloon

 Hisar (PTI): A mysterious balloon lying in a field in a 

village near here was cause for much suspicion and curiosity to villagers who 

reported it to police. The balloon was attached to some instruments and a battery. 

The police are investigating the matter. 

 Bride suicide

 Jammu (PTI): A marriage ceremony turned tragic when the 

bride allegedly committed suicide by jumping into a well. A relative who went 

to look for 27-year-old Satya Devi found her body floating in the well in the 

Upper canal village in Jammu district on Sunday.

parts of Himachal Pradesh saw fresh snowfall on Monday, while the lower parts

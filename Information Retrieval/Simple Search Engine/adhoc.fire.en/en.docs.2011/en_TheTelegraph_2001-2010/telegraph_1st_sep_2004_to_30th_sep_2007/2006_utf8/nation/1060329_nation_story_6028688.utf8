 New Delhi, March 28: The tear in the fashion firmament has received official sanction.

 The monopoly watchdog today upheld the restriction imposed by the Fashion Design Council of India (FDCI) on its members from participating in the rival Lakme India Fashion Week which got off the ramp in Mumbai today.

 A Mumbai designer had moved the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Commission (MRTPC), challenging the bar and seeking a stay on the councils upcoming Wills Lifestyle India Fashion Week in Delhi. 

 The commission rejected the plea for the stay, clearing the way for the councils show, scheduled to roll in the first week of April. 

 The ruling sets the stage for two India fashion weeks unfolding on the catwalk for the first time ? one in Mumbai and the other in Delhi ? within a space of, what else, a week.

 The order also cuts short the hopes of a section of the fashion fraternity that was keen to take part in both the shows. 

 Lakme used to be the title sponsor of the original India Fashion Week for several years. But it fell out with the FDCI, the organiser, last year, largely over financial issues and the councils reluctance to take the show to Mumbai, which the cosmetics company wanted. Lakme later announced its own spectacle in association with IMG, the production company with exposure to international events.

 The council had then issued a directive to its member-designers, asking them to participate only in the India Fashion Week organised by the FDCI in Delhi.

 The Mumbai-based Narendra Kumar Ahmed approached the MRTPC after he was barred from participating in the Wills event.

 The commission today held that restriction imposed by the FDCI on its members does not amount to restrictive practices.

 It does not... in any manner restrict competition. On the other hand, it encourages competition in so far as all the designers in the field get an opportunity in one or another (event), said MRTPC chairman Justice B.K. Rathi.

 The commission accepted the councils plea that it has limited slots for exhibition and, hence, it was giving priority to those who have not got a chance in any other event.

 MLA, wife slain for Rs 3000

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Omkareshwar (Madhya Pradesh), 

 Oct. 21: Denied Rs 3,000 on Diwali, a former driver 

 of BJP MLA Kishori Lal Verma stabbed him and his wife to 

 death this morning.

 Verma, a former state minister, was performing Narmada puja at Kedi Ghat when Chandu attacked him from behind. 

 He slit the MLAs throat and then repeatedly stabbed him in the stomach till he lost the strength to put up a resistance. A witness said when Vermas wife Veena came rushing, Chandu slit her throat as well, killing her on the spot. 

 After the assailant threw away the knife, he was overpowered by the mob, which thrashed him till police arrived. While he was being taken away, Chandu kept shouting: Usne mujhe tyohar mein teen hazaar rupiya nahin diya. Maine use maar dala (He did not give me Rs 3,000 for the festival so I killed him). 

 Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan who went to the spot said Verma was unlucky as he had given his security guard leave to celebrate Diwali. I have ordered an inquiry into the incident and, in future, we will see to it that MLAs are provided adequate security round the clock, Chauhan said. 

 Leader of Opposition Jamuna Devi slammed the chief minister for failing to protect the lives of legislators. In the last two and a half years that the BJP has been in power, over two dozen MLAs have been attacked. We shudder to think about the plight of the common man in the state, the Congress MLA said. 

 Vermas son said Chandu had quit the drivers job to become a construction contractor. The MLA had reportedly given him an assignment to construct an ashram on the banks of Narmada. According to the police, it seems Verma and Chandu were having a dispute over payments. 

 An MLA from Pandhana in Khandwa district, Verma enjoyed considerable clout in the state BJP and was education minister when Sunderlal Patwa was chief minister. 

 Shaped like an Om, Omkareshwar, 

 280 km from state capital Bhopal, has been declared by the 

 BJP regime as one of the six holy cities where 

 sale of meat, eggs and liquor is prohibited.

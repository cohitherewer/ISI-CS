 Convert shot dead in Valley 

 MUZAFFAR RAINA

 Srinagar, Nov. 21: Suspected militants today gunned down an engineer, a Muslim who had reportedly converted to Christianity, at his native Mamoosa village in Pattan, around 35 km from here.

 Bashir Ahmad Tantray, 56, who worked in the states power development department, was shot dead near his ancestral residence while on a stroll with his cousin, Ghulam Rasool Tantray, around 10.45 this morning.

 Two youths approached us to enquire whether any bus had passed by. Then, one of them came near Bashir and shot him from point-blank range, Ghulam said.

 Bashir was later buried according to Muslim rituals. Dozens participated in his funeral. 

 This is the first time that a convert to Christianity has been killed in Jammu and Kashmirs 17-year-old history of militancy. No militant group claimed responsibility for the murder of Bashir, who is survived by his wife and four children.

 In 2003, Mamoosa came under the spotlight after reports that many residents had converted to Christianity. Locals generally rebuff such claims in public, but some admit in private that they have changed their faith.

 Hit in class, boy faints

 Krishnagar, Nov. 15: A 15-year-old boy fell unconscious this afternoon after being repeatedly hit with a wooden ruler by his English teacher in Nadias Karimpur.

 Bachchu De, a Class IX student of Jagannath High School, has been admitted to Karimpur Block Hospital, where his condition was stated to be serious.

 Around 2 pm, Nalini Ranjan Saha gave his students a fill-in-the-blanks exercise, which Bachchu thought was too easy. His mistake: he said as much.

 He told the teacher Sir why are you giving such easy tasks? My private tutor at home taught me these things a few months ago. Please give me something new to do, a classmate of Bachchu said.

 A furious Nalini lunged at Bachchu, ruler in hand. He hit him on the head and continued to beat him with the ruler, the classmate said. Then he turned the boy out of the class.

 Half an hour later, when the bell rang, Saha and other students came out of the classroom and found Bachchu lying unconscious. Assistant headmaster Kanai Saha and some other teachers rushed the boy to hospital. 

 Headmaster Asit Singha Roy has slapped a showcause on Saha. I dont know why even after repeated orders, the teacher beat up the student. I have served a showcause notice and asked him to reply within three days. I will also refer the case to the school managing committee, he said. 

 Despite corporal punishment being banned in schools, incidents of torture by teachers have been reported from across the state. In March this year, a teacher in Calcutta yanked a tuft of hair off the head of five-year-old Varnika Gupta because she had forgotten to put her art-and-craft papers in a plastic carrybag. 

 Nalini today said he was sorry. I became angry at the way Bachchu asked me to give him a new task.... but I did not realise that he would be hurt so badly.

 Bachchu has regained consciousness, but he has been put on saline drip. He has been administered sedatives as he suffered internal and external injuries in his head. The level of internal injuries can only be determined after a CT scan, said Subhendu Biswas, a medical officer in the hospital. 

 Nadia district magistrate Omkar Singh Meena said action could be taken against the teacher only after getting the injury report of the student from the hospital.

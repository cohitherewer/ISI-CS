 Brakes on top cop transfer

 - EC order binding only 

after poll is notified: HC

 Natraj: Brief relief

 Chennai, March 31: An Election Commission order to transfer the Chennai police chief will not be binding on the state till the polls are notified, Madras High Court ruled today.

 The decision is a moral victory for Jayalalithaa and a two-week reprieve for R. Natraj, under fire from the commission after being quoted in a newspaper saying the chief minister was the ideal woman.

 A bunch of public interest litigations had argued that state officials come under the commissions direct control only from the day the poll notification is issued and not the day the election schedule is announced.

 The court ruled that the poll panel order need not be considered as a binding directive on the state government till April 13, when the election is to be notified.

 A Chennai newspaper had published an interview with Natraj on March 8, International Womens Day, a week after the poll schedule was announced in Delhi on March 1.

 The officer was quoted as saying: An ideal woman is someone who manages both her personal and professional life well. In this respect, our chief minister, J. Jayalalithaa, is the perfect example of the ideal woman.

 Following a complaint by Union environment minister and DMK leader A. Raja, the poll panel checked up on Natrajs comments and ordered that he be transferred and kept off poll duty.

 This led to an avalanche of public interest litigations, the petitioners including three former state police chiefs.

 During the week-long arguments in the high court, the petitioners contended that the model code of conduct, which comes into effect immediately after the election schedule is announced, applies only to political parties and not to officials.

 The poll commission countered that when an officer publicly betrays a leaning towards a political leader, his impartiality comes under a cloud.

 As it gave its ruling, the court emphasised that after April 13, the poll panel can take any decision on the conduct of the elections and order any state official transferred.

 What the state government can do now, the court suggested, is sit with the commission, take a pragmatic view and figure out what should be done in the matter of Natraj.

 As for the officers reported remarks, the court observed that though they had come in the context of International Womens Day, there is a slim possibility that they might influence voters. So, the commissioner should have been more circumspect.

 Jayalalithaa today began her campaign for the May 8 election by attacking the Centre for raising prices. The price of PDS (public distribution system) rice was raised by the Centre. However, (my) government has not hiked the price and is providing rice at Rs 3.50 a kg, she said.

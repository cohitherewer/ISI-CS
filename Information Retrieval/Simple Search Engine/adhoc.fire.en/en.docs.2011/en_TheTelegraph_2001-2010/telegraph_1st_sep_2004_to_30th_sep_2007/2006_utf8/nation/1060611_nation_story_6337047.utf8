 Jail lessons from a veteran

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 10: Rahul Mahajan seems to have found a godfather at Tihar whose sage advice is making his days in jail somewhat more tolerable.

 The mentor is none other than the Rashtriya Janata Dal heavyweight from Bihar, Pappu Yadav, also lodged in block no. 4 of jail no. 3.

 A senior jail official said Rahul, who hasnt been allowed to meet his family since his arrival, looks more composed and relieved every time he meets Pappu.

 The Madhepura MP, whose biggest problem in confinement has been how to lose weight, should know all about ways to bring cheer into jail life.

 Arrested in the 1998 murder of CPM legislator Ajit Sarkar, he had turned Beur jail in Bihar into his fief, holding regular durbars and carrying on his business through mobiles. 

 After being shifted to Tihar, the seriously overweight RJD strongman applied for surgery to shed fat, with doctors suggesting his stomach be stapled to reduce his appetite.

 During a chat with a jail official, Pappu betrayed considerable sympathy for Rahul, a deceased politicians son gone astray. He said he felt like helping the young man when he saw his look of helplessness in the unfamiliar surroundings.

 They have already met three times in three days. On Thursday and Friday, Pappu consoled Rahul for more than a couple of hours, which seemed to improve the 31-year-olds mood a lot. The duo met for almost an hour this evening, too, after which Rahul went to the evening prayers around 6 pm.

 Tihar authorities have assigned an inmate to Rahul as his helper. He is taken to the jail clinic for a check-up every day.

 After having problems with food on the first day, Rahul has been managing to eat the dal-roti. He is also a regular at the Gumsum Panchayat, a sort of spiritual class where old-timers try to provide solace to the new entrants.

 Rahul can meet his family on Monday, one of the two days in a week when inmates in judicial custody are allowed to meet relatives.

 Rahuls mother Rekha, sister Poonam Rao and uncle Gopinath Munde are staying at the five-star Hyatt Regency. BJP sources close to the family said Rekha had stopped receiving calls from party leaders.

 The familys main objective is to secure bail for Rahul on June 13 and whisk him away to Mumbai or some other location, away from the media glare.

 If Rahul is denied bail by the magistrate, Rekha plans to move the high court, the sources said.

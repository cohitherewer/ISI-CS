 Glare on fake NRI weddings

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi, Oct. 8: A man marries his daughter-in-law to bring her to the US, but later starts misbehaving. The woman seeks legal remedy but her papers are found to be fake.

 A husband divorces his wife, who has arrived on an H-4 Visa. The lady is ordered to fly out to India immediately, but she does not want to leave her six-week-old toddler behind.

 Walk-in marriages and walk-out divorces are very common and acceptable in American society. But for Indian girls, facing such a situation is very difficult. Several of them have often been stranded at airports because husbands never turn up, says Anu Peshawaria, who runs Seva, a California-based NGO offering legal assistance.

 Nearly two of 10 NRI marriages are faked or end in divorce, says the legal counsellor from Fermont, who is here to lobby for an Indian law aimed at protecting victims of such spurious alliances and financial frauds.

 Peshawaria has met Union law minister H.R. Bharadwaj, who apparently promised her support. We have informed him about the situation in the US, where cases of frauds related to NRI marriages, which result in domestic violence, are increasing. He promised us full support, she says.

 Such overseas alliances, often showcased in many mushy Bollywood hits centring on lavish NRI lifestyles and fancy designer wardrobes, are turning into real-life nightmares for girls back home and their parents.

 Marriages involving Indian-Americans and quickie divorces are not rare. A number of NRI marriages last only two years, the time needed to get a green card. In many instances, people even have kids to make the marriage seem real, says Peshawaria, adding that such short-lived ties are known to leave behind a trail of abandoned children. 

 Marriage as a fast-track option to a green card is more common among the one million Indians of the 11 million illegal immigrants in the US. These people are very vulnerable, especially after 9/11, when identities are being probed. Anyone found faking an identity is detained, says Peshawaria.

 One of the lesser-known facts that Peshawaria brings to light is a fiancee visa, which allows girls to visit the US to run a check on prospective grooms. There is also the vawa petition that a girl can file in court when she is left alone or deserted there.

 She also suggests free legal aid to parents wishing to marry daughters to NRIs or persons of Indian origin. As a deterrent for abusers, she says efforts should be made to get the guilty extradited to India, whose marriage and divorce laws apply to NRIs, too.

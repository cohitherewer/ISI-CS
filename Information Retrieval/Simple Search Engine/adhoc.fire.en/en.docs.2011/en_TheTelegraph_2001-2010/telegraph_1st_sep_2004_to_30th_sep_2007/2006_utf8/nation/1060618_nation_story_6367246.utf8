 Lash at damning Narmada report

 - MP CM 

swoops on Sozs review team

 REFUSING TO LET GO

 New Delhi, June 17: The central government has more than made up for Saifuddin Sozs report on the Narmada oustees by refusing to take a decision on the Sardar Sarovar dams height. But the BJP has not yet forgiven the Union water resources minister for supporting the oustees.

 Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan today said the three-member survey team that Soz headed created more trouble than setting things right in the Narmada valley.

 If they (the ministers) were sincere about their job, they would have consulted the state government, (and) gone about it in a more systematic manner, Chauhan said.

 They just made a flying visit and gave a damning report without understanding the issue at all.

 Soz and the two other ministers ? Meira Kumar and Prithviraj Chavan ? had visited the valley when Medha Patkar sat on a hunger strike in protest against raising of the dams height.

 Patkars argument was that even at 110.64 metres, the earlier height of the dam, all families in the submergence zone were not rehabilitated. An increase in the height ? the target is 121.92 metres ? would mean a direct expansion of the submergence zone and more oustees.

 After the ministers had visited the valley, they submitted a report that subtly argued for a halt in construction at the dam site as rehabilitation work was, by no stretch of imagination, complete.

 The Madhya Pradesh government, however, claims that all families in the submergence zone would be resettled by the end of this month. This is despite the fact that the Supreme Court has clearly said all families in the submergence zone must be rehabilitated six months before the dams height is increased.

 While the water resources minister has maintained that he had a long discussion with government representatives and visited the villages they had suggested, Chauhan today said they pre-judged the issue of rehabilitation in the state.

 They did more harm than good for the people of Narmada valley. I wish we were left alone to get on with our job rather than people politicising the issue. Rehabilitation work is more than satisfactory, he claimed.

 However, after names of village after village in Dhar, Badwani, Jhabua and adjoining districts were cited for absolute neglect of rehabilitation work, Chauhan dithered.

 The number of affected families was 24,000. If a project involves such a large number of people, you obviously cannot satisfy everyone. I am not claiming that rehabilitation work is one hundred per cent complete, he said.

 But this is precisely what the state government claimed in its affidavit to the Supreme Court. They have told the court that rehabilitation work is complete, Prashant Bhushan, the lawyer for the Narmada Bachao Andolan, said.

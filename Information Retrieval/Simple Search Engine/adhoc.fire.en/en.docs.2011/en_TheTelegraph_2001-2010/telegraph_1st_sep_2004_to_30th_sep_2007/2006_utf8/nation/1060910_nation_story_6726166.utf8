 Crossfire over Bajrang link

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Dehra Dun, Sept. 9: The BJP today launched a counter-attack on the Left for their demand for investigating the Bajrang Dal in connection with the Malegaon blasts.

 Senior BJP leader Arun Jaitley presented the partys resolution on internal security at the party conclave here while mounting the charge against the Left, specifically the CPM, for their demand for investigating the Bajrang Dal.

 These are political parties on account of whose policies terrorism has flourished in India, he said in response to a question from the media about CPM general secretary Prakash Karats remarks on investigating the Malegaon link with the Bajrang Dal. 

 Jaitley argued that the common minimum programme of the UPA has no vision to counter terrorism. The only promise it makes is for removal of Pota, which they have diligently fulfilled, he said. 

 Labelling Karats demand as a diversionary tactic, Jaitley said the focus should be on finding out who the real culprits are. 

 Our party would not be privy to any attempt to divert attention from the real issue that the government has completely failed to check the spread of terrorist activities in India. There is not even a semblance of a breakthrough in the Mumbai blasts case.

 Defending the Hindu outfits, he said: They (the government) wanted to ban these organisations. But their own tribunals have not upheld these bans. I wish, in the backdrop of these attacks, our emphasis was on those innocents who have lost their lives and what is being done to investigate these incidents. 

 Caught in a bind over how to respond to Malegaon, where the targets were clearly the local Muslims, the BJP has concentrated its response mostly on the central governments soft policies towards terrorism. 

 Both Atal Bihari Vajpayee and L.K. Advani had yesterday targeted the Centre for mishandling internal security without expressing the kind of outrage the BJP characteristically indulges in after each terrorist strike. 

 However, the party recovered enough today to field Jaitley and Narendra Modi to express downright condemnation over the incident.

 We strongly condemn the terror attacks in Malegaon, Jaitley said. 

 On whether the party was confused about its reaction to an attack where the targets were Muslim, he said: An act of terrorism is an act of terrorism where innocents lose lives. Our intelligence agencies have to pull up their socks, terror modules need to be broken. Let us not give any room for speculation of any kind.

 Modi, too, duly appeared before television crews to express sadness. I express deep sorrow for what happened yesterday. The merchants of death have struck again and we are helplessly watching.

 George goes ballistic at PM

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 16: George Fernandes today accused Manmohan Singh of browbeating and sniping at the Opposition.

 Fernandes dashed off an angry letter to the Prime Minister, protesting against certain comments he made while returning home from a week-long foreign trip on Sunday.

 In a snipe against me, you, while interacting with the media on board your aircraft yesterday, said: I have no expectation from him (George Fernandes).

 Singh was responding to a journalist who asked: Are you surprised at the way George Fernandes has dragged the President into the controversy regarding the Barak missile deal? To this, Singh replied: Nothing surprises me, particularly a comment from Mr Fernandes.

 Today, the former defence minister went ballistic. He recalled his past meetings with Singh, the number of letters he had written to him earlier and let out a flurry of invectives against Congress president Sonia Gandhi.

 Your reported remark has amused me no end. I did expect you to act independently, courageously and unearth the truth out of the lies spoken by your party president. May I say that you have belied my expectations, he said.

 The lies spoken by your party president have been exposed as no wrongdoing of any kind has been proved against me, Fernandes wrote. 

 You failed in the witch-hunt against me in the coffin issue. Yet, instead of having the moral courage to apologise to me for having called me a coffin chor for the past four years, your government and other powers who control its affairs, have now started to explore other avenues to continue their politics of lies, vendetta and witch-hunts by misusing the CBI to register a false FIR against me. 

 Fernandess party, the Janata Dal (United), ignored his outburst and it fell upon the BJP to circulate his letter.

 Finally, Fernandes denied making any derogatory remarks against President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam. 

 It was the CBI that dragged Dr Kalam into the controversy in its press release dated October 10, 2006, he wrote.

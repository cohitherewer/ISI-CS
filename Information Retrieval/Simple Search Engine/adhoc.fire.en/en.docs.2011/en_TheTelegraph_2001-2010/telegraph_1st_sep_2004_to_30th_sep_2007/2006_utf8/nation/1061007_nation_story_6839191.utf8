 New Delhi, Oct. 6: A chemical cocktail developed by defence scientists to lure and kill mosquitoes that transmit dengue and chikungunya remains largely unexploited despite months of advance warning that both infections might show a resurgence in India, scientists said.

 Scientists at the Defence Research and Development Establishment (DRDE) in Gwalior had developed the cocktail containing a chemical that attracts female mosquitoes and an insect growth inhibitor that prevents eggs from hatching or larvae from growing into adult mosquitoes.

 Although DRDE scientists developed the technology nearly three years ago to prevent the breeding of the Aedes aegypti mosquito species that carries dengue and chikungunya viruses, outbreaks of both infections have occurred this year dengue in northern India and chikungunya in the south.

 We call it a lure-and-kill technique to prevent growth of mosquito population, said Krishnamurthy Sekhar, director of DRDE. The cocktail available as a liquid contains a pheromone that attracts female mosquitoes and a toxic chemical that destroys eggs and larvae. 

 After laboratory studies, the technology was field-tested in Delhi in 2004 and in Chennai and Thiruvananthapuram last year where it demonstrated its potential to obstruct mosquito breeding, Sekhar said.

 During an outbreak of chikungunya in Andhra Pradesh early this year, the DRDE had written to health secretaries of three southern states asking them to consider using this lure-and-kill technique to prevent further breeding of Aedes aegypti. It received no response, sources said.

 Public health authorities dont seem to wake up unless there are deaths, the sources said. But chikungunya has led to vast loss of productivity hundreds of thousands of people have had to stay away from work for days.

 More than 1.2 million people are suspected to have been infected by chikungunya in the four southern states and in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat since early this year. 

 The largest outbreak has occurred in Karnataka where over 750,000 people were believed to have chikungunya, an infection with symptoms that somewhat resemble those of dengue, but which does not pose a risk of haemorrhage as does infection by the dengue virus.

 The number of suspected cases of dengue in the capital crossed 500 yesterday. 

 Although municipal public health officers in Delhi have adopted the lure-and-kill technique in small pockets of the capital over the past two years, its use has not expanded to other areas in the capital or in other states.

 Insect growth inhibition is a promising method, but it has not been approved by the insecticide board, said Pyare Lal Joshi, director of the National Vector-Borne Disease Control Programme in New Delhi, responsible for controlling diseases spread by mosquitoes. Once its approved, we can consider using it.

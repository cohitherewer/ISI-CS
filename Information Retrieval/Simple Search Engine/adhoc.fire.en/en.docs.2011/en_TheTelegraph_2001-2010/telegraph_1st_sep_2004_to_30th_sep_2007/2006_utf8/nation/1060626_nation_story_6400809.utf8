 Singh, Sonia to push own agendas 

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 Singh, Sonia 

 New Delhi, June 25: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi are both expected to have their way in the monsoon session of Parliament.

 Sources said while Singh would push for the passage of the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority Bill, 2005, Sonia has already conveyed to the government that the Scheduled Tribes (Recognition of Forest Rights) Bill, 2005, should be enacted without delay. And they are not necessarily working in tandem this time.

 The Congress is in a tizzy, not knowing if it should lend its weight to the government and help market Singhs initiatives or stick to Sonias aam aadmi agenda.

 Those in the government, in touch with Sonia, believe the tribal bill should get top billing. They said it should be showcased with the same conviction and aggression as the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act.

 The bill will come in the July session and it will be passed... notwithstanding the pulls and pressures of the lobbies opposed to it, said a party leader involved in the drafting.

 The draft bill will be expected to incorporate the proposals put up by the National Advisory Council. For instance, it has pressured the government to refer to the Scheduled Tribes as adivasis and use a new phrase for primitive tribes.

 It also objected to the use of sentences such as tribals merely believe in harvesting crops without putting in efforts.

 Semantics apart, Sonia and her former NAC team members have demanded inclusion of separate clauses to a) confer ownership rights on tribals for minor forest produce, including tendu patta b) stop evicting them from forest areas; c) return land wrongly classified as forests to the tribals; d) convert forest villages into revenue villages and e) safeguard their rights over mineral resources, water sources etc as laid down by law.

 Congress sources said their main interest in getting this bill passed was to recover the ground the party had forfeited to the BJP in tribal belts in the recent polls in Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh.

 They admitted they could not match the cadre strength of RSS affiliates Bajrang Dal and Vanvasi Kalyan Ashram, which had reconverted Christian tribals and set up schools and primary healthcentres for them.

 Singh is reportedly interested in pushing through the pension bill ? which seeks to create a pool of fund managers and schemes to manage the pension wealth of individual pensioners ? as he believes the government should pull itself out of business as many sectors as it can.

 The Left has proposed a series of amendments that strike at the core beliefs enshrined in this bill. 

 Government sources said Singh would go through the motions of consulting the Left leaders before the session, but he would accept only those that do not overturn the character of the bill.

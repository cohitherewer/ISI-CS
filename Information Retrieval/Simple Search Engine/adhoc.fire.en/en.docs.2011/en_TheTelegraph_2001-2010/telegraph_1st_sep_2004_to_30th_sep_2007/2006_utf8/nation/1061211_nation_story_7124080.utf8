 BJP to Centre: Junk nuclear deal

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 10: The BJP today formally reacted to the US nuclear waiver act by describing it as an intrusive and humiliating attempt at capping, rolling back and eventually eliminating Indias nuclear weapons capability.

 The party asked the Centre to reject the legislation, passed by US Congress last week to allow civilian nuclear energy cooperation with India. It repeated its stand that the BJP retained the right to abrogate the deal if and when it came to power.

 The governments response was low-key. Parliamentary affairs minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi said foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee would make statements in both Houses of Parliament tomorrow, and indicated the government might allow a short discussion.

 BJP leaders Yashwant Sinha and Arun Shourie spelt out the partys position after emerging from a meeting at Atal Bihari Vajpayees home, attended also by L.K. Advani, Rajnath Singh and Jaswant Singh. They demanded that the Prime Minister explain Indias stand.

 It is now clear that the United Statess aim in signing the nuclear deal with India was to cap our nuclear capabilities as well as make us fall in line with their foreign policy objectives. The only alternative before us now is to reject the act in totality, Yashwant said.

 The BJP leaders cited seven principal objections to the waiver act:

 It does not provide for 

 full civilian nuclear cooperation

 The certification and 

 reporting requirements are rigorous

 Even civilian reactors 

 are not assured fuel supplies. India cannot reprocess the 

 used fuel nor can it ship it back to America unless the 

 US Congress clears the reshipment

 The moratorium on production 

 of fissile material remains a key US objective

 Delhi has been debarred 

 from nuclear testing even of the kind the CTBT permits

 The US retains the right 

 to carry out its own end-use verification. In addition to 

 International Atomic Energy Agency inspection, Indias 

 nuclear weapons programme will be subject to US scrutiny 

 through the requirement of cooperation in research with 

 the National Nuclear Security Administration

 India is expected to stick to obligations under international protocols such as the Proliferation Security Initiative, the Australia Group and the Wassenaar Arrangement. The Prime Minister had admitted Delhi had reservations about these.

 Both BJP leaders said the legislation makes a mockery of Manmohan Singhs assurances to Parliament. The principle of parity, on which the PM had placed so much emphasis, stands abandoned. Reciprocity and sequencing of the various steps have been given the go-by, Shourie said.

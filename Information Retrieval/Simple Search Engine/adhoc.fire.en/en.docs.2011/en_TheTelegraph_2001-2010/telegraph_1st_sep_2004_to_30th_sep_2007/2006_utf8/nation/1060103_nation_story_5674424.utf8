 Lawyers protest foreign sneak-in

 New Delhi, Jan. 2 (PTI): Lawyers today attacked the office of a mediation cell for out-of-court settlements during a day-long strike to protest its functioning, alleging the cell was an example of backdoor entry of foreign legal machinery.

 District judge S.N. Dhingra, however, refuted the allegations saying the entire staff and day-to-day expenses of the cell were being funded by his office without aid from foreign agencies. 

 Denying any role of foreign mediators, Dhingra said judges of the Delhi higher judicial services were handling the cases.

 The lawyers strike paralysed courts on the first working day of the year. The protest took an ugly turn when the lawyers, affiliated to the Delhi Bar Association, attacked the mediation cells office in the Tis Hazari court complex.

 Hundreds of lawyers, after holding a demonstration outside the complex, marched towards the cells office on the third floor of the building, breaking through police barricades. They shouted slogans against the Chief Justice of India, Y.K. Sabharwal, and Delhi High Court chief Justice Markandey Katju.

 The lawyers, who attempted to barge into the mediation cell but were stopped by police, vented their ire by smashing the cells sign board and inauguration plaque sporting the CJIs name. 

 The lawyers claim the mediation cell, launched in October with the help of American trainers of the US-based Ford Foundation, was started by the Chief Justice of India with the help of foreign lawyers and funds.

 We have resolved not to allow any foreigner to associate with the mediation centres set up to promote the interest of multinationals, bar association president Rajeev Khosla said.

 The lawyers went ahead with their strike despite an appeal by Justice Katju to desist from strikes in the interest of the litigants.

 Dhingra denied the allegations that the mediation cell involved foreign lawyers and MNC funds. The entire mediation programme based in Tis Hazari courts is funded by the office of the district and sessions judge and is supervised by the Supreme Court of India, he said in a release.

 Bhajan in quit mode

 Chandigarh, July 1: Bhajan Lal has offered to quit the Haryana Congress presidents chair after some of his loyalists did not find a place in the state Congress office-bearers list announced last month, reports our correspondent.

 Lal, who has thrice been Haryana chief minister, has faxed a message to Congress president Sonia Gandhi, complaining that he and his supporters were being humiliated ever since the Bhupinder Singh Hooda-led government came to power in March last year.

 But when asked to explain the reasons behind his move, Lal was tight-lipped. I would not like to comment at the moment. It is the internal matter of the party. 

 Lal found himself sidelined after losing the race for the chief ministers post to Hooda last year, despite having the support of nearly 40 MLAs. 

 Before the polls, the Congress high command had nominated a working chief, Randeep Singh Surjewala, to manage the partys affairs on the plea that Lal was not keeping well. But when Surjewala joined the cabinet, a Hooda loyalist, Ram Prakash, who lost the polls, was elevated as working president.

 Also the state Congress office-bearers list was announced by the party high command and released by Ram Prakash without Lal being informed.

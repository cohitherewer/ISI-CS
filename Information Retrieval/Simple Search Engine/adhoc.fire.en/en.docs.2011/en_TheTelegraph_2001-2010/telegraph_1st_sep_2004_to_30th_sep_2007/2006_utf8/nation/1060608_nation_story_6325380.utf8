 Business at Buddha door

 Hyderabad: A day before 

 the CPM central committee meeting kicks off, Bengal chief 

 minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had a queue of industrialists 

 calling on him, reports our special correspondent.

 Within hours of his landing here on Wednesday along with 

 Left Front chairman Biman Bose, biotech players swarmed 

 the Lake View Guest House seeking incentives and facilities 

 to invest in Bengal.

 Prominent among them were officials from BJR Diagnostics, Vin Biotech Products and Virunchi Labs. Representatives of Ficci also visited him.

 The president of the Andhra chapter of the CII, G. Vivekanand, who is also the managing director of Vishaka Industries Ltd, is likely to call on him on Thursday.

 Bhattacharjee told newsmen the talks with the industrialists had been preliminary and he had invited prospective investors to visit Calcutta for further discussions.

 Andhra government sources said Bhattacharjee had expressed interest in visiting IT units in Hitec City. We are eager to show him what has been achieved in the IT sector provided he gives us sufficient time, an industry ministry official said.

 Along with Bhattacharjee, two other Left chief ministers ? Manik Sarkar of Tripura and V.S. Achutanandan of Kerala ? will be sharing the dais with CPM general secretary Prakash Karat and politburo member Sitaram Yechury on Thursday.

 This is the first central committee meeting of the CPM since the Assembly elections. The three-day meet begins in the backdrop of dissent over the oil price hike but has the victories in Bengal and Kerala high on the agenda.

 Umrah visas

 Dubai (PTI): Saudi Arabia 

 will not issue Umrah or mini-Haj visas to those under 40

 deputy minister for Umrah affairs Adil Balkhair.

 Geelani arrested

 Ammu: The chairman of the hardline faction of the 

 Hurriyat Conference, Syed Ali Shah Geelani, was arrested 

 on Wednesday in connection with three cases of inciting 

 communalism and working against the country and remanded 

 in judicial custody for three weeks.

 Code DVDs

 Chennai (PTI): The air 

 intelligence unit of the customs department has recovered 

 850 DVDs, including 150 discs of the film The Da Vinci Code, 

 from unclaimed baggage at the international 

 airport here.

 Uttar Pradesh police will launch Operation Talash to trace girls missing in the state, most of whom are presumed to have fled home in search of greener pastures and ended up in brothels.

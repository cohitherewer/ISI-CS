 RS clears profit bill

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 27: The Rajya Sabha has passed the Parliament (Prevention of Disqualification) Amendment Bill, 2006 ? more familiar as the office-of-profit bill ? which was returned by the President for reconsideration.

 In the division of votes, 98 members voted in its favour and 49 against. The bill will be taken up for discussion in the Lok Sabha on Monday.

 The NDA tried to stall a discussion on the bill by demanding that the House should first take up the Mumbai blasts. 

 Government sources said senior BJP leaders had assured them at a meeting in Rajya Sabha chairperson Bhairon Singh Shekhawats chamber this morning that the bill could be discussed before the Mumbai issue was taken up. But they went back on their purported commitment in the House and forced two adjournments before agreeing to take up the bill.

 In backroom parleys that followed the adjournments, Shekhawat reportedly told the BJP MPs: If you do not honour my ruling, I can resign.

 Among the BJP MPs, only the leader of the Opposition in the Upper House, Jaswant Singh, was in favour of discussing the bill before the Mumbai blasts issue.

 When the bill was taken up, the government defended the bill and argued that a practical view should be taken about certain posts it proposed to exempt from its purview. 

 Law minister H.R. Bhardwaj said the earlier law had not defined what an office of profit was and only defined its scope from time to time.

 The BJPs Arun Jaitley opposed the bill and accused the government of subverting the Constitution by retrospectively amending the legislation to protect the violators from the consequences.

 The arrogance of numbers adds to the arrogance of power. The two arrogances taken together are so intoxicating that those in power refused to see reason and overruled the Presidents sage advice, Jaitley said.

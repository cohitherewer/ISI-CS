The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 PM in patience sermon

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 27: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today said any deviation from the July 2005 joint statement in the final US legislation allowing civilian nuclear trade with India will determine the fate of the deal.

 Singh advised a belligerent Opposition and the Left to have patience, as the legislation process in the US was not over.

 Let it be completed. Once it is completed, we will then determine whether there are elements in it which go beyond what we have committed in the July 18 statement, he told the Rajya Sabha.

 Singhs comments came hours after the US House of Representatives approved by a thumping majority the landmark deal, under which India will get access to American nuclear fuel and equipment to meet its soaring energy needs.

 However, it also needs to be approved by the Senate and a vote is not expected until September. The House and Senate would vote again after negotiations on the agreements technical details are over.

 Singh was responding to CPM leader Sitaram Yechurys contention that the bill approved by the US House made it mandatory for India to negotiate with the International Atomic Energy Agency on a system of inspections for its civilian nuclear sites before the final agreement is passed by the US Congress.

 The Prime Minister said the Bush 

 administration has given an assurance that it will take 

 steps to ensure that any element of the July 18 statement 

 is not tampered with. The foreign ministry welcomed the 

 US Houses approval but said it would wait for the 

 finalised text of the legislation.

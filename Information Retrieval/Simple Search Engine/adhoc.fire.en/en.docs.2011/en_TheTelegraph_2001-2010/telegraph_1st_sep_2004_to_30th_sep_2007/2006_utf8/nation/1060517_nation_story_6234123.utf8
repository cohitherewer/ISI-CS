 Spoilt-girl pout in Cannes, but wheres Aishwarya?

 There may not be any Indian entries in competition at the 59th Cannes Film Festival but the national flag was flying breezily over the India Pavilion on the Croisette ahead of Tuesdays official opening with a gala screening of The Da Vinci Code.

 The face of India, Aishwarya Rai, has yet to arrive but her poster, as a LOreal brand ambassador, was unusually prominent right in front of the Palais des Festival where stars traditionally walk up the red carpet.

 This is Aishwarya as India has not seen her before ? with a spoilt-girl pout.

 Cannes is a great place to pick up gossip/news about India and Indians ? one is that Aishwarya does not want to come because she is afraid that her new film, Provoked, will be received with the same lack of enthusiasm as her last, Mistress of Spices.

 Another is that Norah Jones, half sister of Anoushka Shankar, is to star in her first movie, My Blueberry Nights.

 Preity Zinta may officially inaugurate the India Pavilion on Wednesday but the engagement clashes with a screening of The Da Vinci Code. No marks for guessing which will attract the journalists.

 Actually, behind the scenes, the selling of Bollywood movies is being pursued with serious intent and a fair bit of success.

 UTVs stable is focusing on Rang De Basanti, which will have a couple of screenings in Cannes. Apparently, the Germans have shown themselves keen on the movie in trial runs in Frankfurt, Berlin, Munich and Cologne.

 The response was very good, said Ashoka Holla, a vice-president in the companys acquisitions department.

 There are indications that Bollywood is slowly winning new audiences in western Europe.

 We sold Rang De Basanti for a good sum in Germany, added Holla. It will go on general release on June 15, and be dubbed for television. Hindi films are starting to do well all over Europe, including Scandinavia.

 Bollywood producers can take some comfort that though they are not able to take their movies into competition, they seem to be doing better business than most of the competition.

 Another big distributor, Avinaash Jumani, of WEG India, has high hopes for a new film made in English, Hari Om, which tells of the adventures in Rajasthan of a scooter-rickshawallah (Vijay Raaz) and a French couple who get separated.

 Last year, Jumani managed to sell Chokher Bali to Latin America on the basis that the film starred Aishwarya.

 The Indian glamour count at Cannes has been steadily going up in the last few years but there is some way to go before Hollywood can be caught.

 One PR company gushed on Monday: During the 59th Cannes Film Festival, A-list celebrities such as Sir Elton John, Lenny Kravitz, Oliver Stone, Penelope Cruz, Meryl Streep and other film industry VIPs are expected.

 There is a Miramax private party for A-listers only. India is matching that with a Bollywood brunch hosted by Aishwarya.

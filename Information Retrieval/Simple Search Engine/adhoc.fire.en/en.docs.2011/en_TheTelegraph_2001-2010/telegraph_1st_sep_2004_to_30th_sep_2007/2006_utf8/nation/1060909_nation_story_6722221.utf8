 Fear of axe drives Ranchi trio to SC

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi/Ranchi, Sept. 8: Amid the bitter power struggle in Jharkhand, three MLAs supporting the UPA today moved the Supreme Court with a request to restrain the speaker from acting on applications seeking their disqualification from the Assembly until next weeks confidence vote.

 Speaker Inder Singh Namdhari issued the disqualification notices to Anosh Ekka (Jharkhand Party), Stephen Marandi (Independent) and Kamlesh Singh (NCP) on September 6. 

 The move had come a day after Ekka and Singh, along with Madhu Koda and Harinarayan Rai, quit as ministers and withdrew support to the Arjun Munda government, reducing it to a minority.

 A bench headed by Chief Justice Y.K. Sabharwal will hear the petitions on Monday, the day Namdhari has directed the trio to appear before him in Ranchi.

 Apprehending an adverse order, the MLAs said that since the governor had ordered a floor test on or before September 15, it was necessary to maintain status quo on the number of members in the House.

 The reason behind the issuance of notice at this stage, after the resignation and withdrawal of support by ministers and before the floor test, is to reduce the strength of the UPA, which, in all likelihood, will stake its claim to form the government, they alleged in the petition.

 It is necessary for the court to intervene in the matter as the Speaker is acting as an agent of the NDA, they contended.

 The Speaker, however, has exclusive jurisdiction to decide on applications for disqualification under the anti-defection law. 

 The Tenth Schedule of the Constitution lays down that his decision shall be final and no court shall have any jurisdiction in the matter.

 Border roads get nod

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 29: The Cabinet Committee on Security today approved a fund of Rs 992 crore to build roads close to the China border, effectively reversing a policy of not upgrading physical communication links in sensitive zones.

 Many of the roads are in the Northeast.

 Defence minister Pranab Mukherjee said the fund would be used by the Border Roads Organisation (BRO) to lay and rebuild 608 km of roads over five years. It had been suggested by the BRO that it will take seven years for the job but we have asked them to complete it in four to five years, he said. 

 The committee has also asked the BRO to make three abandoned airfields usable. The locations of the airfields were not identified, but they are most likely in Assam. The airfields were used by British and American forces in World War II for over the hump operations to support Chinese nationalist troops against communists.

 An unstated policy of the government was to let roads close to or going across the border with China remain in a condition of disrepair to minimise the threat perception. Chinese troops had advanced in Assam in the 1962 war and the security establishment in New Delhi believed that rebuilding the roads in India would give the Chinese military linkages into the country.

 BRO director-general Lt Gen. K.S. Rao recently said the road density in border regions is a measly 16 km per 100 sq km. The average all-India road density is 80 km per 100 sq km.

 But a definite lowering of the threat perception from China ? as indicated by the defence ministers visit to Beijing earlier this month ? coupled with Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs enthusiasm for a look east drive to enhance trade has led to the reversal of that policy.

 The Centre has also approved a fund of Rs 550 crore for building roads near borders. This is in addition to the road building funds from the armys general staff budget. The BRO is an army support arm.

 The army has been studying the active road and railway building activity on the Chinese side in Tibet. The roads to be built by the BRO are aimed at perpetual sustenance of difficult posts. 

 So far these posts have been maintained with air support. It is assessed that the Chinese railway line in Tibet from Zigatse to Lhasa would allow Beijing to deploy troops fast.

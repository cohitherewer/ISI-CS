 Nuke test-case meet

 K.P. NAYAR

 Washington, March 22: As a two-day meeting of the 45-nation Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) opened in Vienna today, the Bush administration circulated a draft of the changes it has proposed in its dealings with India on transfer of civilian nuclear technology.

 Nicholas Burns, the administrations top nuclear negotiator with India, told reporters here today that even if the NSG does not agree to amend its rules for cooperating with India at its current meeting, he expected the group to generally welcome the Indo-US nuclear agreement.

 We have a fairly compelling group of countries in favour of the agreement, Burns said in response to a volley of questions about the prospect of and timetable for admitting India into the global non-proliferation system.

 The NSG, formed 32 years ago to stop the proliferation of weapons technology and prevent non-nuclear weapons states from acquiring bomb-making systems, must agree to the essence of the Indo-US nuclear deal even for Washington to ultimately implement the deal and sell any new civilian nuclear plants to India.

 The Bush administration has sent Stephen Rademaker, assistant secretary of the Bureau of International Security and Non-Proliferation in the state department, and Richard Boucher, the new assistant secretary of state for South and Central Asia, to represent the US at this weeks NSG meeting.

 The two-day meeting in Vienna is not a full NSG session, but only a consultative group meeting. But it is important for India because it will decide the agenda for the next regular NSG plenary session to be held in Brazil in May.

 If there is stiff opposition to the Indo-US nuclear deal in Vienna this week, the changes proposed by Washington will not be on the agenda of the May meeting. That could be a major setback to New Delhi and Washington. 

 Burns, however, was optimistic that with the public support for the deal announced by Mohamed ElBaradei, the director-general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), many NSG members may lean towards endorsing it.

 He pointed out that in addition to the US, three nuclear weapons states ? Russia, France and the UK ? were in favour of the agreement.

 The American document, circulated among NSG members for todays meeting, proposes that the groups member governments which want to sell civilian nuclear technology to India may be allowed to do so. But they must satisfy themselves that New Delhi is fulfilling its commitments agreed to with Washington on July 18, 2005, and in subsequent follow-up steps.

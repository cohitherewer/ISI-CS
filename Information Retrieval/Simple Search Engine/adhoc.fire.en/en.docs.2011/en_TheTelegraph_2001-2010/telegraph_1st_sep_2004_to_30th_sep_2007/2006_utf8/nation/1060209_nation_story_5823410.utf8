 France offers to take ship waste

 Ahmedabad, Feb. 8: French ambassador Dominic Gerard today said his country was ready to take back whatever amount of toxic waste is found in Clemenceau.

 We are prepared to take asbestos back to France if the courts and India are prepared for it, he said.

 Optimistic that the Supreme Court would allow the decommissioned French warship entry into Indias territorial waters, Gerard said the ships inventory would be submitted to the apex courts monitoring committee. 

 He will also send a report to the French government about the ship laden with 45 tonnes of asbestos.

 On a visit to the Alang shipbreaking yard where the aircraft carrier is sought to be dismantled, the French envoy expressed satisfaction about the expertise and facilities there. I hope that Clemenceau will be handled in a safe manner.

 He said this would be the first instance of a decontaminated ship being dismantled. It has never been done before with any ship, not even a warship, and this operation is going to be the best example of that.

 Gerard, who inspected the shipyard along with two others, said: We are taking this as an economic issue and this is a great chance for technology transfer and for bringing better equipment here.

 Asked why the French government was taking so much interest in the dismantling of a ship that it had already sold off, he replied: The contract says that the propriety of the ship will be transferred when the ship is demolished, so we keep responsibility of the ship.

 The envoy also inspected plot No. 78, where the ship is supposed to be dismantled. The plot belongs to Mukesh Patel, the shipbreaker who bought Clemenceau.

 Gerard was dismissive about the propaganda war unleashed by Greenpeace activists, saying: What is happening at Alang is very different from whats shown by media and some others.

 Greenpeace and the Ban Asbestos Forum are protesting against India being used as a dumping ground because of its weak laws to deal with disposal of hazardous waste.

 EU poser to Paris

 The European Commission this week wrote to France seeking clarifications about the dismantling of Clemenceau amid doubts over it meeting requirements under EU environmental laws.

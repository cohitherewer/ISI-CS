 Silchar, Aug. 10: Two women were killed in Assams Cachar district last night when a mortar fired by the Bangladesh Rifles (BDR) landed on their house.

 Two were wounded in the mortar fire that went on all night as border friction between the neighbours reached a flashpoint.

 The dead were identified as 30-year-old Supriti Dey, wife of trader Milon Dey, and his 20-year-old sister Santa. They were residents of Kinnapkhal village. The injured villagers are undergoing treatment in BSF camps.

 The BSF had warned of a war-like situation in the south Assam sector of the Indo-Bangladesh border last month after spotting bunkers built by the BDR.

 BSF sources said BDR personnel opened fire without provocation at two border outposts in the Harinagar- Kinnarkal area of Cachar district and Tukergram in Karimganj district around 10.15 pm yesterday. 

 The BSF soldiers retaliated and mortars, carbines and machineguns crackled on both sides of the border throughout the night. 

 BSF sources confirmed that the exchange of fire continued uninterrupted beyond daybreak, ending only at 7 am.

 Police sources at Kathigorah police station said more than 3,000 people with homes along the border had fled to relatively safer areas since last night. A relief camp was opened for the villagers in a school near Silchar.

 At least 2,500 people have been evacuated since the first showdown between the BSF and the BDR in this sector on June 28. The skirmish site is located in Kathigorah block, 40 km west of Silchar.

 Firing by the BDR had earlier been limited to Harinagar village. But this time, exchange of fire extended to the nearby villages of Tukergram and Labourputa, BSF sources confirmed. 

 This indicates that Bangladesh Rifles elaborately planned the exercise, a BSF officer said.

 BSF deputy inspector-general (south Assam) A.K. Singh and 64 Battalion commandant B. Sengupta led the BSFs response to the firing from the other side of the border.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Tri-series not on DD

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 4: Viewers of Doordarshan will not be able to watch live the tri-series in Sri Lanka starting from August 14.

 A division bench today restrained Prasar Bharati from interfering with the exclusive telecast rights for the cricket matches obtained by the Dubai-based TEN Sports.

 TEN Sports has challenged the downlinking guidelines which makes it mandatory for channels to share feed for events of national importance with Doordarshan. It had moved an interim application to restrict Prasar Bharati from invoking the provision to interfere with the rights obtained by it for various sporting events.

 The court also restrained the public broadcaster from invoking the guidelines to force the channel to share feed for the Champions Trophy hockey (men and women), US Open tennis and World Cup hockey (men and women) matches.

 The court said the government should not take any coercive steps to enforce the obligation to share feed as per para 5.2 of the downlinking guidelines.

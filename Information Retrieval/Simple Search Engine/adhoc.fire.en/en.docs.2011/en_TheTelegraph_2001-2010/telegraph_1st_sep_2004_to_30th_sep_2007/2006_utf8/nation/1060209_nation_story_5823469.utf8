 Amar case

 New Delhi, Feb. 8: Uttar Pradesh police, apparently conducting a parallel probe into the Amar Singh phone-tapping controversy, today moved the Supreme Court against a Delhi High Court order barring them from meddling in the Delhi polices investigation.

 The special task force (STF) of Uttar Pradesh police argued that while the Delhi police were probing only the forged signatures in the letter requisitioning the tapping, they were investigating the mystery of the entire illegal tapping episode.

 The STF challenged the high courts authority to issue a contempt notice to it for seeking an appointment with the Delhi principal secretary (home) and the police joint commissioner (crime) in connection with the case.

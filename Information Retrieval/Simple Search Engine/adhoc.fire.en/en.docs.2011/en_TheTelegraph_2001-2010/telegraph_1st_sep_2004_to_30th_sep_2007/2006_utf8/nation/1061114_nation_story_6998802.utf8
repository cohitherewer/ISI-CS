 Shop owners watch as shops are sealed in Delhi

 New Delhi, Nov. 13: The Centre and the Municipal Corporation of Delhi today moved the Supreme Court seeking relief for about 25,000 traders who had filed affidavits promising to close down their shops in residential areas.

 In an application before the apex court, the Centre pointed out that the traders premises were protected under notifications allowing mixed-land use in some areas, but their shops were being sealed merely because they had filed the affidavits before the notifications were issued. 

 The court had on September 29 exempted some premises from the sealing drive till the validity of the notifications was decided, it said. But the 25,000 traders were not protected despite their shops being covered by the notifications.

 On November 6, the apex court directed the authorities concerned to first seal these 25,000 premises.

 The Centre submitted that the court order on interim exemption from sealing should bring all establishments covered by the notifications into its ambit. The MCD, in a separate application, also sought protection for all establishments covered by the notifications, irrespective of whether they had filed affidavits.

 Of the affidavits submitted by 40,000 establishments during the first phase of sealing before the notifications were issued on September 7 and 15, around 25,000 were covered by the notifications, the MCD said. 

 But they were being sealed, while traders with shops in similar localities who had not filed affidavits before the notifications were issued were let off, the MCD said.

 The Centre, the Delhi government and the MCD had on November 6 invited the apex courts wrath for seeking a breather for traders who had taken to the streets, citing law and order problems. Instead of moving the court on their behalf, you should have asked them to follow court orders, the court had said while ordering the resumption of the sealing drive. 

 Justifying its fresh intervention on behalf of traders, the Centre said the situation has considerably changed since November 6 when some people had disrupted normal life in the city. The MCD has resumed the sealing drive, it added.

 The MCD said sealing operations were on in full force following the directions of the monitoring committee appointed by the Supreme Court. As many as 266 establishments, including showrooms and shopping malls, were sealed on November 8, 9 and 10.

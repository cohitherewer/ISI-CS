 SC moved after judicial slur

 New Delhi: R.H. Tahiliani, the former 

 navy chief who now chairs Transparency International India, 

 has moved the Supreme Court challenging a warrant issued 

 against him by a Kashmir court for branding the judiciary 

 the second-most corrupt department. 

 Taking note of the findings in a study conducted by Transparency International and the Centre for Media Studies, the court had issued bailable warrants against Tahiliani and the centres director.

 Criminal proceedings under the Contempt of Courts Act, 1997, were initiated and charges pertaining to defamation were slapped on the two after a newspaper published a portion of the report, Corruption Study 2005.

 The court said the publication had scandalised the whole judiciary and defamed the public servants, including judges, involved in the administration of justice. 

 High-sea cops to prowl wider

 reports our special correspondent.

 According to the Coast Guard director-general, Vice-Admiral R.F. Contractor, the area under the zone is expected to grow from 2.013 million sq km to over 3 million sq km once a UN body the UN Laws of the Seas Convention redraws the continental shelf.

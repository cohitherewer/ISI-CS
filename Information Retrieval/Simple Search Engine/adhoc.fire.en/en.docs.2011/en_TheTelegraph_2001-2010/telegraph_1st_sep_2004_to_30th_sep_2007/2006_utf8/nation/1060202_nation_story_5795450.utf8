 PM allays nuke fears

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 1: Manmohan Singh today said India would not bow to pressure from the US on the nuclear deal and would continue to have a strategic nuclear programme with minimum critical deterrent.

 Under attack from the Left and the Opposition for pursuing a pro-US policy, the Prime Minister said Delhi was working with a clear objective to ensure continuance of a strategic nuclear programme and opening the doors for civil nuclear trade.

 I should make it quite clear that there is no question of bending. We have clear-cut objectives. We have to have strategic programme, a minimum critical deterrent. There is no question about it, he told a news conference.

 India was also keen to have energy security and to end the technology denial regime imposed by the nuclear suppliers group, he said.

 We are seeking a brave world order wherein the NSG will cease to discriminate with India when it comes to trade in nuclear matters.

 With political parties fearing the US was arm-twisting India on separating its civil and military nuclear facilities, Singh said he would take Parliament into confidence on the pact. When Parliament meets, I will take the first opportunity to inform it about the state of the plan vis-?-vis our negotiations.

 Singh hinted that nuclear talks with the US could take long as there was no deadline to seal the deal. There were technical issues involved, too, he said.

 Washington had indicated the deal may not be ready before President George W. Bushs visit to India.

 The criticism of being pro-US did not deter him from saying India-US ties were passing through one of its best phases. He said they were not only about the nuclear deal and looked forward to giving Bush a warm welcome.

 Brushing away queries on US ambassador David Mulfords remarks on the Iran vote, Singh listed the ties with Washington as one of his governments foreign policy successes, the other being improving ties with China and Asean.

 With western powers determined to reporting Iran to the Security Council, he said Delhi would take a stand after studying the draft resolution that will be tabled at Vienna tomorrow.

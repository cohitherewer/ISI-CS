The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Atal blows Sangh trumpet

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 27: Who is responsible for India becoming a nuclear power? Who ended the licence quota raj? Who annexed Kashmir to India? The Jan Sangh and the RSS, if A.B. Vajpayee is to be believed.

 The former Prime Minister today advertised the RSSs contribution to Indias progress at a function to release two special issues of Rashtradharma, the monthly magazine of the Sangh.

 With L.K. Advani looking on, Vajpayee attributed extraordinary feats to the RSS in a speech that merged fact with fiction and myth with history in characteristic Sangh style. 

 It is we who made India a nuclear-capable nation and got the position which we deserve in the world, he said. If today Kashmir is an inseparable part of India, it is because of us.

 The Sanghs contribution to the annexation of Kashmir to India is based on the myth that M.S. Golwalkar, who headed the RSS at that time, travelled to Kashmir in July 1948 and met Maharaja Hari Singh. The meeting is rumoured to have resulted in Hari Singh agreeing to the annexation.

 However, even historians close to the RSS have not been able to prove that such a meeting took place. In a recent documentary on the RSS, Sangh researchers omitted the event for want of sufficient supporting evidence.

 Vajpayee went on to add more achievements to the Sangh kitty. Our contribution to nation-building cannot be demeaned as it is due to our efforts that society is today free from licence and quota raj.

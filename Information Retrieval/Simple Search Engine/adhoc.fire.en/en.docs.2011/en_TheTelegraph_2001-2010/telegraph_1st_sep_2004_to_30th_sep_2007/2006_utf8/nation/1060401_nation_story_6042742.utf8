 Direct dial-up to troops of little wars

 SUJAN DUTTA

 New Delhi, March 31: Army headquarters in Delhi is rigging up an instant communication system to be in touch with Indian troops in Africa where the continents little wars now account for the largest deployment of army troops outside Jammu and Kashmir and the Northeast. 

 In the last two years, there have been three casualties, one of them a heart patient, because the UN failed to get Eritrea to lift an embargo on flying helicopters and the soldier could not be evacuated to a hospital in Addis Ababa in Ethiopia in time.

 India has also been requested for additional troops in Sudans violence-torn Darfur region.

 The deputy chief of army staff (information systems and training), Lt Gen. Mohinder Puri, said here today that the UN has requested for a brigade-sized group (about 3,000 troops) to patrol Darfur region. 

 India already has 2,429 military personnel in UNMIS (United Nations Mission in Sudan) where the force commander is also from the Indian Army, Lt Gen. J.S. Lidder.

 As the ceasefire along the Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir takes hold, the army is in a position to spare more troops for UN duties. 

 Soldiers and officers want UN 

 assignments because they normally make more money on such 

 assignments in a year than they would in 10 years of service 

 on Indian salaries .

 Lt Gen. Puri said troops in Jammu and Kashmir, however, are deployed on operational assessments and contingents for the UN are spared only after army headquarters deems that it is possible to send troops. 

 Larger Indian contingents in UN missions also strengthen Indias case for a Security Council permanent membership.

 The communications network based on a V-Sat system will link army headquarters in Delhi with all UN missions in Africa where Indian troops are deployed. Many of the regions are harsh and the troops are tasked to keep the peace between warring militia ? as in the Democratic Republic of Congo and in Sudan ? or between hostile neighbours such as between Eritrea and Ethiopia.

 Three of the UN missions with Indian participation are chapter VII ? peace enforcement ? deployments where the blue-helmeted personnel are authorised to go into combat for self-protection and for the protection of UN assets. There are MONUC (Congo), UNOCI (Ivory Coast) and ONUB (Burundi). The deployments in Sudan, Lebanon, Ethiopia-Eritrea and in the Golan Heights are chapter VI ? peace-keeping ? missions.

 The additional deployment in Darfur ? if the logistics are worked out ? will already take Indias unprecedented level of troop deployment overseas to a new high. Nearly 8,000 Indian troops, including some from police and central paramilitary forces, are deployed in eight UN missions.

 At no point of time since 1947 ? barring the Indian peace-keeping mission in Sri Lanka ? have so many Indian troops been serving overseas on operational tasks.

 Army headquarters in Delhi is in the process of assessing the composition of troops before the United Nations Department of Peace Keeping Operations (UNDPKO) is given a commitment for deployment of troops in Darfur.

 India considered sending troops to southern Darfur last year, too, but administrative arrangements between the UN and an African coalition had not worked out. 

 A signals unit of the army gives communication back-up to all troops under UNMIS, which includes contingents from Pakistan, China and Bangladesh.

 Typically, western nations contribute 

 cash to the UN peace missions while third world countries 

 like India, Pakistan, Nepal and Bangladesh contribute the 

 manpower.

 Party cocks ears for PM

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Singh

 New Delhi, Feb. 15: Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs reluctance to go on the front foot on the military minority count controversy has caused disquiet in the Congress.

 When journalists sought a comment on the issue, Singh said today: We have already clarified the position.

 He was apparently referring to a PMO statement on Monday, which said that after having constituted the seven-member committee, it has not been involved with the panels work.

 However, party sources wondered why Singh chose not to answer the question. The impression we get is the PMO wants to wash its hands of the Rajinder Sachar committee for fear that it might be accused of Muslim appeasement, a Congress source said.

 It was the Prime Minister who set up the committee under the Congresss pressure. We had demanded that the socio-economic conditions of Muslims should be profiled so that the government can formulate its policies accordingly, said a member of the partys minorities cell.

 The party hoped Singh would explain the Centres position in Parliament when the Opposition raises the subject.

 Sources said they expected him to repeat the moving and spirited intervention he made when the BJP raised the report of the Nanavati Commission looking into the 1984 anti-Sikh riots last year. His statement silenced the Opposition, a source said. 

 Officially, the Congress echoed the PMOs line that the Sachar committee was tasked with only data collection. The partys minorities cell is reportedly putting pressure on the Congress to issue a stronger statement.

 Army secular

 The Indian armed forces are totally secular and apolitical, defence minister Pranab Mukherjee said in Calcutta. There is no scope for controversy. The character of the Indian Army is not going to be changed, he added.

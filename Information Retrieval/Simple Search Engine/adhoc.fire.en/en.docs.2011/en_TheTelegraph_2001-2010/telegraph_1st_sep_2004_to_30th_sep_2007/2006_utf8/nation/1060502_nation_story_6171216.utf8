 Pramod lung worry 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, May 1: Pramod Mahajan today developed a severe lung condition where accumulated fluid prevents the oxygen in the breathed air from entering the bloodstream.

 The appearance of the symptoms of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) were worrying doctors at the PD Hinduja hospital who continued to describe the BJP leader as critical for the 10th day running.

 The 3 pm medical bulletin said the 56-year-old had been placed on advanced mechanical ventilation. Pramod has been on ventilatory support since April 22, the day he was shot at by brother Praveen.

 Anupam Verma, the hospitals director (administration), tried to play down the detection of ARDS, saying: This is a known and feared complication in patients with extensive multiple trauma, massive blood transfusions and systematic sepsis.

 But he added, This is a worrying development necessitating advanced mechanical ventilation, and posing an immediate cause of concern. He is being closely monitored.

 Earlier in the day, the leader of the medical team treating Pramod, Dr Gustad Davar, had described the patients condition as very serious. He said the BJP leaders pancreas and duodenum were badly damaged, and there could not be a surgical intervention at this stage. We will only be drying out the fluid.

 Dr Davars team did that on Saturday, cleaning up the fluids accumulated in the abdominal cavity to prevent infection.

 With injuries to his lungs, pancreas, liver, and heavy blood loss, Pramod has been battling multiple organ failure. He is on dialysis because of poor kidney functioning. When his blood pressure wavered, he was given heavy medication to stabilise it.

 But BJP workers and leaders played down the concerns.

 L.K. Advani, who visited the hospital this morning, described Pramods condition as critical but stable.

 The doctors have succeeded in stabilising his blood pressure after reducing the medication doses. It is a good sign, Advani said.

 Chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh called on Pramods family this morning.

 Praveen had a cheating case lodged against him and his company, PVM Enterprises, by a Malad-based businessman. Uday Shankar Mishra alleged he had signed a contract with Praveen in 1999 to buy two second-hand luxury buses at Rs 8.5 lakh each. Praveen, he said, delivered only one.

 Expelled MPs go to court

 New Delhi, Jan. 3 (PTI): In a move that could trigger a confrontation between Parliament and judiciary, two of the 11 ousted MPs caught taking bribes on camera in a sting operation have filed a writ petition in Delhi High Court challenging their expulsion.

 In their petition, Narendra Kumar Kushwaha and Manoj Kumar wanted the court to set aside the order of Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee and restore their membership.

 The petition contended that the action of Parliament was unconstitutional, undemocratic and arbitrary as the principles of natural justice were not observed.

 It claimed that the MPs were not given any opportunity to defend themselves and the entire action smacked of arbitrariness.

 The petitioners also argued that the Pawan Bansal committee, which probed the cash-for-questions scandal, had no locus standi to conduct the inquiry and recommend action against the MPs. 

 The Bansal committee report said the conduct of the MPs was unbecoming of them and also unethical and recommended the harshest penalty.

 Apart from expulsion, the Bansal panel also suggested imprisonment of the accused MPs.

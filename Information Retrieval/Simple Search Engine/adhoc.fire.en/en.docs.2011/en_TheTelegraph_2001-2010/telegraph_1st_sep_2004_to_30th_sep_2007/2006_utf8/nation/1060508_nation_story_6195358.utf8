 Science grapples with a shrine

 - Residents worship, lab issues denial

 The structure on the premises of the laboratory

 Thiruvananthapuram, May 7: A temple-like structure has sprung up in a quiet corner of the sprawling Regional Research Laboratory premises here, but officials claim there is nothing religious about it.

 The structure with temporary metallic roofing has come up close to scientists residential quarters on the 50-acre campus. Pictures available with The Telegraph suggest it is nearing completion.

 Locals said there had been only a huge tree, with remnants of a tulsi platform below it, at the site when the land was acquired by the lab 20 years ago.

 The lab is under the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research.

 Two months ago, campus residents are believed to have made offerings of pongala ? cooked rice and jaggery ? close to the structure. This is a popular form of worship in south Kerala.

 Lab authorities have, however, denied a temple has come up on the campus. Acting director B.C. Pai said there were no plans of building one either.

 No religious structure is coming up on the premises. The picture, which appeared in a local newspaper, doesnt say its a temple, he said.

 We dont intend to construct a temple though several scientific institutions like the Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre have places of worship on the campus.

 But he added that there was nothing unusual about having worship centres on the premises of a national facility.

 Even the army division at Pangode in the city has worship centres on its premises. The army runs the Ganapati temple at Pazhavangadi.

 A former fellow of the lab, however, confirmed the existence of the temple. A. Sabu said the authorities could be downplaying it for fear that other communities might demand their houses of worship too.

 Officials may not concede there is a temple on the premises?. A section of the RRL staff may be pleased with the temple, but this will provoke demands from other sections for their respective places of worship, he said.

 Would this contribute to the right academic ambience? Sabu, who teaches biotechnology at the University of Kannur, asked.

 With a storm brewing, fingers are likely to be pointed at lab director T.K. Chandra Shekhar, whose go-ahead would be required for any such project.

 But a scientist said it was uncharitable to do so as the director ? who was travelling ?had more serious academic matters to pursue.

 Its likely that someone had broached the idea and Chandra Shekhar may have nodded in approval quite innocuously.

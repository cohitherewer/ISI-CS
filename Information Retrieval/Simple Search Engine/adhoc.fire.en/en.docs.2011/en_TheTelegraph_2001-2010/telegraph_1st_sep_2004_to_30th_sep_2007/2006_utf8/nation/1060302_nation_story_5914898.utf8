 SC slashes holidays

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 1: The Supreme Court has cut short its 56-day summer vacation by a week, in view of the large number of pending cases. 

 Besides this, special benches of the court will continue to sit during the holidays from May 15 to July 2 to dispose of old cases. This would be in addition to the vacation benches that hear important cases. 

 The Supreme Court was earlier to reopen on July 9. The long summer break is a British legacy.

 Even after the cut, the apex court would have a much longer break than the lower courts. Delhi High Court will close for 28 days, the civil courts in Delhi for 24 days in June and the criminal courts for 14 days.

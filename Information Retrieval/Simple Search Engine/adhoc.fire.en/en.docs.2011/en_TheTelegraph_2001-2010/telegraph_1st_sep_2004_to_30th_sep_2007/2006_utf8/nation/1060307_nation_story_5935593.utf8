 Wheel turns full circle for once-feared cop

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Nayak (top), Sharma 

 Mumbai, March 6: There was a time when he chased denizens of the underworld with his 9mm automatic blazing and shot them dead. Now, Dirty Harry Daya Nayak does not want any encounters with the gangsters he once targeted.

 Nayak today pleaded before a court not to shift him to Byculla or Arthur Road jails where some of the Mumbai underworlds most feared gangsters are lodged as his life could be in danger.

 The police sub-inspector, now in the custody of the anti-corruption bureau on the charge of possessing assets disproportionate to his known sources of income, wants to stay where he is ? in the Bhoiwada police station lock-up.

 Nayaks counsel made the plea when the encounter specialist was produced before a sessions court for further remand. The court remanded him in judicial custody till March 20, but directed the jail authorities to submit a report on where Nayak should be lodged.

 Based on the report, the court would decide on the issue on March 10 and, till then, directed the anti-corruption bureau to keep Nayak in the Bhoiwada lock-up.

 Nayaks woes are unlikely to end with the disproportionate assets case. He also faces interrogation and possible arrest in connection with the mysterious disappearance of Khwaja Yunus, an accused in the Ghatkopar bus blasts case.

 The state CID had filed an application before the sessions court two weeks ago demanding Nayaks custodial interrogation in connection with the disappearance.

 Nayaks mentor-turned-rival Pradeep Sharma, another fallen police hero, also faces arrest in connection with Yunuss disappearance. Sharmas anticipatory bail plea was dismissed by a sessions court today, following an assurance by the state CID that the officer would be given a 72-hour notice in case of an arrest.

 The CID told the court that it did not wish to arrest Sharma at this juncture and hence his anticipatory bail plea should be dismissed.

 Yunus, a chemical engineer accused of links with the Students Islamic Movement of India, was arrested on the charge of plotting a powerful explosion in a bus at Ghatkopar on December 2, 2002. A month later, on January 7, 2003, he vanished from custody when a police party from the Andheri crime intelligence unit was escorting him to Ahmed Nagar.

 Sachin Vaze, the officer in charge of the escort team, claimed that Yunus escaped from the police van when the vehicle had an accident. But Yunuss co-accused, Abdul Basit Mateen, claimed that he had last seen Yunus vomiting blood after custodial torture and suspected that he had succumbed to third-degree beatings.

 With no evidence to corroborate the police claims, Bombay High Court had asked the CID to lodge a fresh FIR based on Mateens statement.

 The CID had arrested many encounter specialists from the Ghatkopar unit. Sharma and Nayak, who then worked at the Andheri unit, were not arrested in the case. But CID officials say if they are questioned in connection with the case, fresh evidence is likely to emerge, which could throw light on the role of then police commissioner Ranjit Singh Sharma and deputy commissioner Pradeep Sawant.

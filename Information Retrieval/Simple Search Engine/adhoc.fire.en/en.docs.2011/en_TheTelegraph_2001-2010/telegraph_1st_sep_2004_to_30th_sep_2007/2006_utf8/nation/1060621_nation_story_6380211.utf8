 Indian siblings suspect in UK murder

 DAVID SAPSTED

 London, 

 June 20: Two teenage brothers being questioned 

 last night over the fatal beating of a secondary education 

 student are former asylum seekers who are in foster care, 

 it was disclosed yesterday.

 The brothers, aged 18 and 16, are believed to be from India and to have been living for more than a year in Sittingbourne, Kent, where 16-year-old GCSE pupil Michael Chapman was attacked while walking with his brother and their girlfriends on Friday.

 GCSE is equivalent to Class X board exams in India. 

 Detectives were granted an extra 33 hours yesterday to interview the suspects, who have been granted permission to remain in the country indefinitely.

 I dont know why the police suspect these brothers were involved in the murder, but we know they were arrested, an immigration service source said. They arrived in Britain as asylum seekers and they have been living locally for over a year.

 Michaels girlfriend, Hannah, has kept a tearful, daily vigil at the scene of the death. Im just devastated, she said. Michael was everything to me. I cant believe he has gone.

 David, 18, Michaels brother, said: I just want the police to catch these bastards. Still shaking with grief and shock, he said: We were out with our girlfriends, just walking back home. I was with my girlfriend, quite a distance back, when some people ran past me.

 I didnt see who ran past me. It was so dark and they just came out of the woods. The next minute I heard screaming and shouting. I ran up and saw Michael just lying there on the ground, his girlfriend lying over him, crying.... Its terrible, the whole thing. Ive been back to the scene every day. I cant take in what has happened.

 We got on well with everyone. It makes no sense at all. I didnt know anyone who had a bad word to say about him. My brother was so popular. I cant believe he is gone.

 Deputy superintendent Lee Catling, who is leading the investigation, said the attack was not a mugging or robbery and appeared motiveless. He was here with his brother, with his girlfriend and they were set upon on their way home.

 As she surveyed dozens of floral tributes at the murder scene, Michaels mother, Sue, said: Michael was a wonderful 16-year-old: loving, thoughtful, happy, cheerful. Please find the people who did this to my son and Davids brother. Thats all we ask for.

 Jonathan Whitcombe, the headmaster 

 at Westlands School, where Michael was a pupil, said: Michael 

 was a quiet and reserved member of our school community.

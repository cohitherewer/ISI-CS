 US varsity convict has no regrets 

 Halder: Not to blame?

 Cleveland, Feb. 13 (AP): An Indian-born former graduate student convicted of killing a man and wounding two others inside a universitys business school remains convinced he should not be held responsible.

 In a one-hour interview last week inside the Cuyahoga county jail, Biswanath Halder, 65, expressed no remorse and accepted no blame for his violent, seven-and-a-half-hour siege that terrified students and faculty at Case Western Reserve University on May 9, 2003.

 A native of Calcutta, Halder blamed the university for a hacker who had wrecked his website that he said was meant to help Indian business entrepreneurs.

 I didnt take a life, Halder said in a quiet, calm tone, sitting at a small table with four guards present.

 It was Case Western Reserve University who took his life.... Case Western Reserve University never wanted to resolve the issue peacefully. They decided on violence right from the very beginning, and then the whole thing unfolded.

 Halder was convicted on December 17, 2005, on 196 counts, including killing 30-year-old graduate student Norman Wallace, whom he did not know. He is scheduled to be sentenced on Friday.

 Judge Peggy Foley Jones must decide whether to accept the jurys recommendation of life in prison without parole. She can impose a less severe punishment but cannot sentence Halder to death. 

 Experts testifying at last months sentencing phase said Halder was out of touch with reality.

 Violence is not just an act. Its a process, Halder said. Had I not done anything, I would have committed a crime against humanity. Had people known the entire story, I think I would have been acquitted.

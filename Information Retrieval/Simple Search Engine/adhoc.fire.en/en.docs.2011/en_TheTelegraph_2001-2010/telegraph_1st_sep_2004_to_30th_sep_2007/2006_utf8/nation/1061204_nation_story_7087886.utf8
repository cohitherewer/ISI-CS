 Wests mission Kashmir flops 

 GAUTAM DATT

 New Delhi, Dec. 3: An attempt by a group of British parliamentarians to get a better understanding of the Kashmir issue came a cropper as separatist leaders turned down an invitation to a roundtable conference last week.

 The exercise was part of an informal arrangement by missions of western countries in India to engage people involved in flash points of the South Asian region. The group includes diplomats from the US, Germany, Norway, France and the UK.

 The task of studying the Kashmir issue had been entrusted to the UK, which interacted with various factions of separatists and gathered first-hand information on the ground situation. A delegation of the House of Commonss foreign affairs committee was recently in Delhi, where a meeting was organised for them to study the situation beyond what is projected by the Kashmiri diaspora in Britain.

 Invitations to the November 28 roundtable were sent to political parties, separatist leaders and independent observers tracking developments in the Valley. 

 But the event turned out to be a non-starter as only National Conference president Omar Abdullah, CPM MLA Mohammad Yusuf Tarigami and Congress leader Ashok Bhan turned up.

 Moderate Hurriyat leader Mirwaiz Umar Farooq and Peoples Conference leader Sajjad Gani Lone declined the invitation. Former deputy chief minister Muzaffar Hussain Beg of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) could not make it, although he was invited. Hardline leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani was not given an invitation.

 The UK delegation was led by chairman of the foreign affairs committee, Mike Gapes. Besides him, it comprised Labour MPs Fabian Hamilton, Eric Illsley and Greg Pope, and Conservative leaders John Horam and Sandra Osborne. Paul Keetch represented the Liberal Democrats.

 The group is touring India and Pakistan to study the Kashmir dispute and record views from both sides. It has also met leaders in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. While in Delhi, the delegation tried to understand the roots of militancy in the Valley and the extent of Pakistans control over the separatist outfits.

 India allows diplomats to visit Kashmir and gather first-hand information on militancy and the problems of people. Senior officials and leaders of western nations can travel to the state and conduct independent studies.

 US shrugs off vote worries

 Washington, Oct. 20: American under-secretary of state for political affairs Nicholas Burns said here today that any differences between India and the US on Venezuelas bid for UN Security Council membership will not come in the way of the excellent relations between the two countries.

 India and the US are both sovereign nations, he told a roundtable with Indian correspondents here. There are hundreds of issues coming up at the UN. We cant agree on everything.

 Burns said he would not comment on how India voted in a secret ballot for electing Security Council members. It is not my job to do that.

 But he insisted there was no disappointment in Washington with Delhi on this issue though it was the Bush administrations view that Guatemala, which has never served on the council, deserved a chance.

 Burns announced that he would lead a large delegation to Delhi in November to push forward items in the blueprint for Indo-US relations agreed between President George W. Bush and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.

 Indo-US cooperation on counter-terrorism would be significantly upgraded during that visit. The delegation led by Burns will include top counter-terrorism officials from Washington.

 The plans for a high profile delegation-level visit next month is seen here as the Bush administrations Plan-B to keep up the momentum in Indo-US relations in case the nuclear deal falls through after Americas mid-term legislative elections in the first week of November.

 Burns described the nuclear deal as the symbolic centre of the new strategic relationship between India and the US. He said it was the top concern and a top objective of the Bush administration to secure its passage during a lame-duck session of the US Senate, which will be held after the elections.

 He also painted an optimistic picture of recent negotiations between India and the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) in Vienna a few days ago. India was invited for the first time to make a presentation at the Vienna meeting of the NSG, which must change its rules in order for India to benefit from the nuclear deal.

 However, the realities of domestic US politics make it highly unlikely that the Senate will approve of the deal next month. By announcing increased Indo-US cooperation on counter-terrorism, an issue that could catch popular imagination in India, the Bush administration hopes to blunt the adverse impact of any collapse of the nuclear deal.

 Burns emphasised that Bushs decision last year to create a strategic partnership with India will be judged as one of the most important strategic openings by the US.

 We are determined to move forward on strategic relations with India and build on it in an ambitious and positive way, he said.

 The US official also commented on differences between the two countries on the election of the new UN secretary-general.

 The US vetoed Indias candidate Shashi Tharoor.

 But Burns described Tharoor as one of the most distinguished international civil servants and congratulated Tharoor on the fine campaign he conducted.

 Burns acknowledged that India did very well in the race for the top UN post and denied recent reports in the Indian media that he had some unpleasant interaction with the Indian candidate before he pulled out of the race.

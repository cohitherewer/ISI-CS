 Flip-flop jolt to kidnap probe

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Anant: No sign of truth?

 New Delhi, Nov. 21: 

 The Uttar Pradesh special task force today claimed to have 

 made three more arrests in connection with the kidnapping 

 of Anant Gupta even as concerns were being raised by a section 

 of police over the way the investigation has been handled.

 A section of Noida police and the STF believes that frequent conflicting statements and denials of events which later turned out to be accurate may have seriously hampered the case against the kidnappers.

 The uncle and aunt of the main accused, Chatrapal Singh, were arrested from their home in Nagla Khasi village of Mathura district, STF special superintendent S.N. Bhagat said.

 Veer Singh and his wife Santhosh are accused of allowing the kidnappers to hide in their house with Anant while STF and Noida police teams scoured western Uttar Pradesh for them. 

 Sunil, a resident of Nagla Kheri village in western Uttar Pradesh has also been arrested from his house on the same charge. After picking up Anant, Chatrapal and Pawan (the other kidnapper who is still absconding) went to Hardoi and then to Sunils house, Bhagat said. 

 The kidnappers needed money and a place to stay the first night. Sunil gave them Rs 5,000 and allowed them to stay at his place, he added.

 The police are slowly admitting, in spite of the arrests, that their contradictory statements and flip-flops may make it harder to prosecute the accused in a court of law.

 While Noida police and the district inspector-general have denied Anant came home in an auto-rickshaw, Bhagat said the vehicle was part of a well-laid trap for the kidnappers. The police were later forced to accept that Anant had been put on the auto by the kidnappers themselves.

 The police had initially claimed Chatrapal, who has been sent to police custody till December 4, was arrested on November 17, the day Anant returned home. Later, it turned out that the man picked up was Jitendra, brother of Chatrapal, who was arrested late on November 18.

 The police and Anants father, Adobe India CEO Naresh Gupta, initially claimed no ransom had been paid, but Rs 50 lakh was recovered from the spot near Bulandshahr where the police claimed they had found Anant.

 Verse in Singh focus on villages

 Hyderabad, Dec. 5: The 

 country needs more skilled manpower this includes more 

 plumbers, electricians and nurses Prime Minister Manmohan 

 Singh said today.

 Singh spent half a day in Hyderabad, dividing his time between the Administrative Staff College of India (ASCI) and the Indian School of Business (ISB) which were each celebrating a milestone. While ISB has completed five years, ASCI has trained 100,000 managers in 50 years.

 I remember a verse I learnt when I was young and is relevant even now, he told the audience at ISB, calling for new management techniques that would make a difference at the grassroots.

 ...A bold peasantry, their countrys pride, When once destoryd can never be supplied, quot; he quoted from Oliver Goldsmiths Deserted Village. 

 The transformation of Indian agriculture and rural India will be the greatest development saga of the next quarter century, he said, adding there were lessons to be learnt from Bengals tenancy reforms, the infrastructure development at Baramati, Amuls experiment and ITCs e-chaupal. 

 It is paradoxical that in our country, rural areas contribute to 20 per cent of our GDP while two-thirds of the population is dependent on agriculture, Singh said.

 At ASCIs golden jubilee celebrations, the Prime Minister called for public-private coordination to improve Indias share of scientific research worldwide, which is less than 1 per cent now. 

 ASCI could train public sector managers to address the skills shortage and make investments productive. Although our public sector has provided a base for the formation of engineering and technological skills and is paying off, the productivity of investment locked up in our public sector is low, he said. 

 I want the citizens of this country to act and check big-time corruption, Singh added.

 The Prime Minister announced a Rs 5-crore interest-free loan for ASCI to improve its training courses.

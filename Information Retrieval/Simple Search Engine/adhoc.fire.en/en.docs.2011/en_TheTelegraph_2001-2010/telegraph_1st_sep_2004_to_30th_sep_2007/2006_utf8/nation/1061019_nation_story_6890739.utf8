 Spotlight on TV stings

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 18: The Supreme Court today said it needs to be examined whether television sting operations are in public interest.

 A bench headed by Chief Justice Y.K. Sabharwal questioned the counsel for CNN-IBN editor-in-chief Rajdeep Sardesai on sting operations and surmised that they were often outsourced people who conducted them went from channel to channel and sold them for lakhs of rupees.

 Whether it is in public interest or not will have to be examined, the bench said.

 The court indirectly referred to the case of junior home minister Manikrao Gavit who was cleared by an inquiry after a channel broadcast a phone conversation allegedly between him and a jail inmate. The court did not name Gavit, but noted that nothing came out of that operation, which was later described as fabricated.

 The observations came in the context of a petition filed by Sardesai, who faces the prospect of being arrested and produced before the Uttar Pradesh Assembly in connection with a sting operation aired on his channel months ago. 

 It showed an Uttar Pradesh minister and two legislators, who appeared to have been caught on hidden camera, accepting bribe or agreeing to accept money.

 The court will hear the petition tomorrow.

 Sardesais counsel Mukul Rohatgi cited professional exigencies for his failure to appear before the Assembly when he was summoned. The House has since ordered that he be brought before it under arrest on October 27.

 But Sardesai appears to have the support of his peers. That was a good sting operation, said NDTV Indias Dibang.

 At a seminar, Star News CEO Uday Shankar had used the case to illustrate the states attempt to regulate the media. But actress Shabana Azmi had alleged a sting against an actor an apparent reference to Shakti Kapoor was completely staged.

 Sardesai would not comment on his case, but asked if he felt sting operations were justified, he said: Absolutely, if it is in public interest.

 Journalists must determine if a sting is in strong public interest, he said. It should also be clear that the investigation could not be conducted by any other means. If these two conditions were met, Sardesai said: I see nothing wrong in a sting operation.

 Dibang agreed that the issue must be left to the channels and their viewers. I dont think there is need to take an alarmist view. 

 I amp;B minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi said a broadcast bill meant to set up a regulatory authority is likely to be introduced in Parliaments budget session.

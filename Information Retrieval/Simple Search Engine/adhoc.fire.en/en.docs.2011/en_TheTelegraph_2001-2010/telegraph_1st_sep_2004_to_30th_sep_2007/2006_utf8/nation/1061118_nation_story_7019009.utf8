 US pledge to address concerns

 Washington, Nov. 17 (PTI): The Bush administration will try its best to address Indias concerns when a committee made up of members of the two chambers of the US Congress meets to reconcile the separate bills on the nuclear deal passed by the Senate and the House of Representatives.

 I have had extensive conversations with ambassador (Shyam) Saran (Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs special envoy on the nuclear deal) about the sensitivities of Section 106 and 107... And what I have said is that (it) is a law passed by Congress and we should all be pleased about it and grateful for it, Nicholas Burns, under-secretary of state for political affairs, said. 

 We understand that there are some sensitivities and that we will work with India and with Congress to see if some of those of sensitivities can be dealt with at the conference.

 He also made it clear one more time that the civilian nuclear agreement with India was country specific and there were no plans to extend the same to Pakistan. 

 A similar arrangement with Pakistan is not going to be possible, Burns said. 

 This is a unique agreement.... The administration told Congress that we would not be seeking a similar relief from American law to any other country.

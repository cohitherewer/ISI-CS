 Push for pension for riot widows

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 26: The National Commission for Minorities (NCM) has asked the government to provide pension to women who lost their husbands in the 2002 Gujarat carnage and are still living in the states make-shift camps.

 The commission, having been handed a report by its team that visited the relief camps recently, has recommended that these widows should be allowed to claim pension even if they have sons over 18 years of age. 

 Around 5,000 Muslim families live in camps across Ahmedabad, Sabarkantha, Dahod and Panchmahal districts nearly five years after the communal mayhem swept the state. 

 The commission has also asked the Centre to provide below-poverty-line ration cards to such families immediately, without putting them through formalities.

 The displaced people have not been given the ration cards despite the fact that they are living in extreme poverty, the commission said. 

 Even when ration cards were issued, most of the residents (of the relief camps) were given above-poverty line ration cards, says the report of the team. 

 This makes a big difference because BPL ration cardholders are entitled to get food grain, cereal, kerosene and other basic items at subsidised rates, the report said.

 Observing that the camps lacked basic civic amenities, the panel has asked the state government to provide clean drinking water, streetlights and approach roads to the temporary tenements.

 A rehabilitation package has been recommended, too. There is an urgent need for the Centre to design and implement a special economic package for the rehabilitation of displaced Muslim families in Gujarat. It must include inputs that address the totality of livelihood concerns, the report says.

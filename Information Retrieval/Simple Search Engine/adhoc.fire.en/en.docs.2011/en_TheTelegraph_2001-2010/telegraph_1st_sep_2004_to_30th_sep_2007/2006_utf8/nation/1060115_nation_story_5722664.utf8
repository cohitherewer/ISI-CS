 Maoist serial strikes

 J. HEMANTH

 Kathmandu, Jan. 14: In a well-orchestrated move, Maoist rebels detonated bombs at several places in Kathmandu and killed at least 15 policemen in attacks on checkposts at two other places.

 According to unconfirmed reports, at least 10 policemen were killed in coordinated attacks on the Thankot and Dadhikot checkposts in Bhaktapur district late this evening.

 The rebels attacked the Thankot checkpost ? the entry point to the Kathmandu valley on the national highway ? by detonating bombs and firing indiscriminately. A police inspector, Mahesh Rawal, was reportedly killed in the attack.

 Simultaneously, another group of rebels raided a police post at Dadhikot near Bhaktapur city at the valleys other end. Reports said five policemen were killed.

 Officials are yet to provide details about the number of casualties. A Royal Nepal Army source said forces are conducting search operations in Thankot. Vehicular movement at the entry point to Kathmandu has been stopped.

 Krishnasenonline, a pro-Maoist news agency, claimed responsibility for the attacks and said the rebels did not suffer any casualty.

 Suspected rebels also triggered a blast at the office of the Lalitpur municipalitys ward number 9 and at Boudha Papal Bot. Reports of explosions in some ward offices in the Kathmandu valley are coming in.

 Todays raids were the first major attack by the rebels in the Kathmandu valley since they ended their four-month unilateral ceasefire earlier this month.

 Arjun cocks ears as guru blesses strikers

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Arjun: Trouble at home?

 Bhopal, May 30: Mandal II protagonist Arjun Singh may have gone off to promote excellence in education in the UAE, but his eyes and ears are glued to Madhya Pradesh.

 The Union human resource development minister has reasons spiritual and political to focus on his home state. His guru, Mauni Baba, has made a prophecy blessing anti-quota medicos. 

 The striking doctors called on the godman yesterday to prevail upon his disciple Arjun not to push caste-based reservation in education. The 75-year-old godman, who has taken a vow of silence, scribbled on a slate: Jeet apki hogi (You will be victorious).

 Arjuns daughter Beena arrived in Ujjain today by a chartered plane to call on Mauni Baba but there was no confirmation if the politically-inclined daughter carried a message from the minister.

 However, sources said, along with Beena, a team of doctors from New Delhi arrived to check the godmans pulse and blood pressure after he reportedly felt giddy while performing puja on the bank of Shipra this morning.

 Mauni Babas words matter a lot for Arjun. In 1989, when Arjun suffered a heart attack and doctors in Bhopal had given up hope, the godman made a prophecy of his survival. Even as a listless Arjun was airlifted to Delhi, Mauni Baba also reached there and shut himself in for days to perform a series of yagnas.

 Like Arjun, thousands of Mauni Babas devotees, including Uma Bharti and Amar Singh, consider him blessed with extraordinary powers. But mystery shrouds his past and a notice at his ashram prohibits photography.

 In his young days, Mauni Baba ? then using the surname Jaiswal ? was a trader running a shop in Ujjain. He left for Tripura and reportedly attained divine wisdom and spirituality in the jungles there. Years later, he returned to set up an ashram. 

 Arjun also has a problem on hand relating to the office of profit. As a former chief minister of the state, he enjoys the rank of cabinet minister which comes with perks, including a 12-member staff, two drivers, 250 litres of petrol, rent-free furnished accommodation, telephone and house maintenance allowance.

 Anti-quota leaders said they would move a PIL against Arjun in the light of the former Digvijay Singh governments decision to grant cabinet-minister status and facilities to previous chief ministers. 

 Ashok Singh, a member of the anti-quota group Youth for Equality, said Arjun may find himself in a spot in view of the Supreme Court observation that such facilities are deemed office of profit. We will call his (Arjuns) bluff, Ashok said.

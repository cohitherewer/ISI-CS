 Pay school teachers better, HC tells govt 

 New Delhi, Feb. 5 (PTI): Delhi High Court has told the government that school teachers should be paid well and given respect if the education system is to be strengthened. 

 If the foundation is weak, the edifice built on it cannot be strong. Hence, it is essential that high emoluments and perquisites are given to such teachers at the lower levels so that they have an incentive for hard work, a division bench said, dismissing an appeal by the Delhi government.

 In the appeal against the order of a single judge directing it to pay full salary arrears of teachers of Khalsa Middle School, the government had contended that they were not entitled to any pay because the school, which received grant-in-aid, had made illegal appointments in violation of the official roster system. The government counsel said the SC/ST and other reserved posts were filled with unreserved candidates.

 However, the counsel for the school said only eligible candidates were appointed in line with the rules. They furnished details of selection committee meetings, attended and approved by government representatives.

 Upholding the schools contention, the court noted that the government was paying only Rs 300 a month to each teacher who, according to their scale, were entitled to about Rs 7,000 each.

 Unless teachers are paid proper salaries, they cannot be endowed and energised. But unfortunately in our country today teachers are not given much respect as is given to ministers, judges and IAS officers, the bench said.

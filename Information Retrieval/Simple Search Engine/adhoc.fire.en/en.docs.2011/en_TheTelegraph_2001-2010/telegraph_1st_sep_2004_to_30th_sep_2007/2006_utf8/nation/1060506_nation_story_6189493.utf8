 Rahuls leadership lessons

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Rae Bareli, May 5: As campaigning for the Rae Bareli bypoll closes tomorrow, Rahul Gandhi, who worked virtually non-stop for mother Sonia Gandhi for two weeks, looked back on his experiences.

 Speaking to reporters from inside his Land Cruiser after a public meeting in Sehegaon village, Rahul said: I am looking at the learning experience in terms of my own consumption and public consumption.

 Leadership should be close to people. Every national leader should interact with the people. I know its not easy and not always possible. But they should.

 He said caste should not be given the importance it gets in the political scheme but conceded it was a factor in Uttar Pradesh politics.

 Caste is important but not the most important. Politically, UP has a lot of potential that has not been realised. I believe the thrust should be on developing leadership in different areas of society so that nobody is denied an opportunity.

 Then he asked a counter-question: But why was the caste question posed?

 The reply was: Because the Congress in UP began declining with the rise of the backward castes and the Dalits as political forces.

 Rahul looked a little bemused but said nothing.

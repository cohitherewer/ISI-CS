 Mumbai on toes

 OUR BUREAU

 Mumbai, Aug. 11: Security was stepped up in key areas and installations around the city following a US embassy warning about possible terrorist strikes here and in Delhi.

 The alert buttressed previous intelligence reports received by the Maharashtra government that pointed to an attack in the days before or after August 15. 

 State chief secretary D.K. Sankaran confirmed the information, saying the government was doing everything to put the necessary security measures in place.

 He had presided over a meeting to review the security of Bhabha Atomic Research Centre at Trombay last week. Security at the Barc was handed over to the CISF in June this year, days before the July 11 train bombings. 

 We have deployed 100 more armed personnel for round-the-clock vigilance. The Apsara reactor is in its 50th year, a police official said.

 Today, deputy chief minister R.R. Patil met over 55 representatives of multiplexes and malls asking them to intensify checks and safety drills. 

 Mumbai police commissioner Anami Roy held another round of meetings with the management of malls, entertainment centres and multiplexes, seen as soft targets.

 The Bombay Stock Exchange, the airport, hospitals, Barc, Siddhi Vinayak Temple and Pancharatna diamond market at Opera House are among the sites where security has been tightened.

 But, as panic shot up in a city already on tenterhooks after the July 11 train blasts, so did hoax calls. 

 A plastic bag was found in a BEST bus outside CrossRoads shopping mall at Tardeo around 11.30 am, but it contained a harmless lunch box, an official of Mumbai polices bomb squad said. 

 The warnings have added to the pressure Mumbai police feel every August. After Independence Day, the city will celebrate the 10-day Ganesh Utsav, beginning August 27.

 Race attack on Indian nurses

 London (PTI): Racial attacks on Indian nurses working in hospitals in north Liverpool in England have left them so terrified that they cannot move out of their homes, a media report has said. 

 Four blocks of flats on Falconhall Road, Fazakerley, where the nurses recruited by the National Health Service stay, have been attacked by thugs, and the racist abuse hurled at them is getting worse by the day, Liverpool Echo, a local daily, reported on Friday. 

 We are really afraid to go out at night because of young boys roaming around outside. I have stopped them (from) trying to take my car and they tried to smash their way into a flat through the window, said Minu Subash, a nurse working at Fazakerley Hospital. Her colleague Rani Thomas echoed her. 

 Glenn McDowall, the landlord of the flats where the nurses live, confirmed the allegation. The harassment is now escalating.

 Police said they have not received any complaints.

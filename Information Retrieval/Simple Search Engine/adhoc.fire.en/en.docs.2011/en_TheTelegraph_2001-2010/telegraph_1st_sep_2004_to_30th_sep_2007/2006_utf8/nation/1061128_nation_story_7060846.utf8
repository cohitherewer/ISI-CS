The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 50:50 price for bargadars, landowners

 - Singur prompts govt rethink

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Calcutta, Nov. 27: In a policy flip-flop apparently prompted by its experience in Singur, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees government now proposes to compensate sharecroppers at the expense of owners while acquiring land for industry and infrastructure projects. 

 Land and land reforms minister Abdur Rezzak Mollah today said the system of paying 100 per cent of the land value to its owner and 25 per cent to bargadars (sharecroppers) would be scrapped. The government wants the money to be divided equally. 

 This is one of the provisions of the West Bengal Land Reforms (Amendment) Bill, 2006, which was scheduled to be tabled in the Assembly today but had to be sent to the select committee for scrutiny in the face of opposition from the CPMs Left Front partners. 

 An 18-member all-party panel headed by Mollah will now look into it. Of the 14 front MLAs on the committee, 12 are from the CPM. Leader of Opposition Partha Chatterjee and Congress legislative party chief Manas Bhuniya are among the others.

 In Singur, the government is paying 152 per cent of the market price of land to owners and only six times the value of the annual yield to sharecroppers, the original beneficiaries of the CPMs land reforms. 

 The policy reversal was prompted by the realisation that a large section of those who benefited from selling their land to the government in Singur are non-resident landowners, Mollah indicated. 

 He added that the landowners would not object to the new formula as it would unlock their land, which cannot be sold now if sharecroppers object. Absentee landlords would be happy to get their land freed from barga records and sell it. We want bargadars and landholders to be equal owners of the land through a mutual agreement. This would facilitate speedy acquisition, the minister said. 

 Mollah had initially demanded 50 per cent of the land value for sharecroppers in addition to 100 per cent for landowners. The government thought such an arrangement would burden investors. 

 Justifying the move to legalise the surrender of share-croppers right to cultivation of 50 per cent of the land as proposed in the bill, he said around 15 per cent of the states 15 lakh recorded sharecroppers have already lost that right through illegal sale of land they tilled. With the demand for land increasing, this has been happening over the years.

 According to him, the 29 lakh pattadars who hold the right to till a piece of land given by the government to landless or marginal farmers will get the full price, though they do not own it.

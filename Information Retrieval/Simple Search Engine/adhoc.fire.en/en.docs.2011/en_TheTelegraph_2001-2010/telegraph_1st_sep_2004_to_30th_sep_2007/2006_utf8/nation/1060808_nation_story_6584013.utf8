 Don in Shilpa case falls into police net

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi/Mumbai, Aug. 7: Fazal-ur-Rahman, whom actress Shilpa Shettys parents allegedly hired to squeeze money out of a businessman, has been caught.

 On the run for nine years, the fugitive linked to the Dawood gang walked into the police net last night as he crossed over from Nepal to visit his hometown in Bihar.

 The 39-year-old (in picture), who had an Interpol red-corner notice against him and is wanted in several states, was arrested by a Delhi police special branch team close to the Nepal border near Gorakhpur.

 He has been running a terror network from Dubai and masterminding extortions and kidnappings. He shifted his base to Malaysia last year and from there to Nepal, Delhi police commissioner K.K. Paul told reporters today.

 Paul said the team laid a trap after a tip-off that the gangster was frequently visiting his hometown Darbhanga.

 Police sources said Rahman is close to the Chhota Shakeel gang and to kidnap kingpin Babloo Srivastava and reportedly was on good terms with a couple of ministers in the former Rabri Devi government, one of whom had even given him shelter. 

 Rahman was brought to Delhi by road and presented in a court, which sent him to police custody for 10 days.

 Police sources said Rahman, who operated under aliases like Ching Chong, Tanvir Ali and Chandra Mandal, has over 30 cases against him across India, including at least two murders and eight extortion cases in Mumbai.

 The don, who formed his own gang in 1998, was in the news recently in connection with the extortion case against Shilpas parents. Surendra and Sunanda Shetty allegedly hired Rahman and two others to extort Rs 2 crore from a businessman in Surat.

 Police say Rahman started his career in crime in 1988 with the kidnap of a minor girl and was jailed in Darbhanga. He began afresh after his release in 1992 and was jailed again in 1995 in Tihar. In 1997, he escaped to Kathmandu.

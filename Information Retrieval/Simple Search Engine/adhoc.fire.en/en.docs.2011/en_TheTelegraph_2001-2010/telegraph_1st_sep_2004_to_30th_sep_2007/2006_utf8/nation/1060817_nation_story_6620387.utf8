 N-experts want debate

 - Scientists ask for US-style discussions in House

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Aug. 16: On the eve of a discussion in Parliament on the Indo-US nuclear deal, top nuclear scientists today said the deal has never been debated by MPs as fully as it was in the US Congress.

 A detailed debate on the likely benefits and potential risks of this deal has never happened in Parliament, Padmanabha Iyengar, former chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, said.

 Why cant Parliament take into account expert testimonies the way the US Congress did? Iyengar, one of the eight nuclear scientists who had sought to caution parliamentarians about the deal through a statement on Monday, said.

 Iyengar said the scientists decided to make the statement because they shared concerns about elements of the Indo-US nuclear deal, including the proposed separation plan, and the absence of enough debate in Parliament.

 Another top scientist and signatory to the statement said Parliament committees should give scientists an opportunity to present their concerns. Parliamentary committees need to take these issues a lot more seriously, Adinarayan Gopalakrishnan, former chairman of the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board, said.

 Gopalakrishnan also said India should move towards ratification of government agreements by Parliament. 

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who is slated to make a statement on the Indo-US nuclear deal in the Rajya Sabha tomorrow, today met Anil Kakodar, the Atomic Energy Commission chairman, and principal scientific adviser and former AEC chairman R. Chidambaram. National security adviser M. K. Narayanan, the Prime Ministers principal secretary T.K.A. Nair and foreign secretary Shyam Saran were also present during the two-hour-long discussion.

 This was a formal review meeting, Anand Sharma, minister of state for external affairs, told reporters. 

 The joint statement by the eight scientists urged Parliament to work out and insist on ground rules for the nuclear deal at this stage itself. The scientists have expressed concerns about the implications of the separation plan on research.

 While Indian nuclear officials indicated earlier this year that there would be no firewalls between Indias civilian and military nuclear facilities which could be interpreted to mean that scientists could rotate from one site to another the US has indicated that it would not like such rotations.

 Testifying on the Indian separation plan in April, US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice had said: We would consider frequent rotation of personnel between civil- ian and military program- mes as being inconsistent with Indian commitments on separation.

 New Delhi, June 25: For the first time since he walked out of jail and into the arms of his weeping mother, Delhi police today got their hands on Rahul Mahajan again.

 Rahul and Sudhanshu Mittal, a key aide of his late father Pramod Mahajan, were questioned one after the other at Tughlaq Road police station by a team led by ACP Suman Nalwa.

 Rahul was granted bail by a special court on June 14 as the police were unable to place before the court the exact quantity of narcotics consumed/possessed by him on June 1. 

 Mittal had taken him and friend Bibek Moitra to Apollo Hospital.

 Rahuls questioning comes three days after he sought the courts permission to leave for Mumbai as his fathers 7 Safdarjung road residence will have to be vacated by July 3.

 Rahul faced the cops for almost an hour, after which he walked out with lawyer Surya Prakash Khatri. Rahul said he was fully cooperating with the police.

 Earlier, when he was in custody, the cops had said he was playing difficult and trying to cover up the events of the champagne-and-narcotics night.

 Mittal said the police had asked him to identify some 10-12 people in an effort to re-create the sequence of the events of June 1 when he had rushed Rahul and Bibek to hospital.

 They asked me the names of 10 to 12 people whom I had never met before, he said, adding the media had damaged his image by attributing conspiracy theories to him.

 Mittal had handed two plastic packets containing some powder to Apollo doctors who turned them over to the police. He had found them at 7 Safdarjung Road where Rahul was partying.

 The police are concentrating on Rahuls circle of close friends and domestic helps to gather evidence against him.

 Rahul faces a series of charges, starting from consumption and possession of drugs, using his property to abet consumption of drugs, destruction of evidence and criminal conspiracy.

 Sources said Rahul was also questioned in a related case against Apollo Hospital. 

 The police suspect Apollo played a role in destroying evidence of drug use at the party at the instance of Rahul, Mittal and another aide, Harish Sharma.

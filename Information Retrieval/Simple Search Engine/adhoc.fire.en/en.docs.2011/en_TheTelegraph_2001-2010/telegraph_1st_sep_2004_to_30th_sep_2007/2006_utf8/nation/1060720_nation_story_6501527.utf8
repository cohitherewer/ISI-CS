 Ambani: Healing touch in fathers memory

 Calcutta, July 19: Anil Ambani has shown interest in setting up a healthcare facility in memory of his father on the outskirts of the city.

 The proposed Dhirubhai Ambani Health City will be housed on 60 acres at Kalyani, near the plot in Haringhata where Anils infotech institute (a deemed university) is coming up.

 Anil has written to the chief minister seeking 60 acres for a health city near his IT project. The details will be thrashed out when he visits Calcutta and meets chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee later this month, said a senior government official.

 The Dhirubhai Ambani University of Information Technology and Communications is coming up on a 50-acre plot near Haringhata. 

 The Nadia district magistrate had been asked to carry out a land survey for the healthcare project. He has sent his report, saying 60 acres of government land is available in Kalyani, a health department official said. 

 In an ironic twist, the site was earmarked in the late nineties for a hospital to be built with assistance from the Centre, but the project never took off.

 Anils is the latest in a string of private sector proposals, including from Ratan Tata and the Salim Group, the government has received in the health segment. 

 The Association of Hospitals of Eastern India (AHEI) has plans to set up a Rs 20,000-crore health city along the proposed Eastern Expressway. The health city on six acres will have 50,000 beds and over 100 separate hospitals. Indonesias Salim Group will develop the infrastructure for the hospital and take care of maintenance.

 Tata is setting up a Cancer Hospital at New Town in Rajarhat. The 150-bed super-speciality hospital is the first such Tata group project outside Mumbai, where it has set up the Tata Memorial Cancer Research Institute. The Rs 92-crore hospital will come up on 10 acres.

 The Hyderabad-based Global Hospitals, which specialises in organ transplants, is also in talks for a Rs 60-crore unit in Rajarhat.

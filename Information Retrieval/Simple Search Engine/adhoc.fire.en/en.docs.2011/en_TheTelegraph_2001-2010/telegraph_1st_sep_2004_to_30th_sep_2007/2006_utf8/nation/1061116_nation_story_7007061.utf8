The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Cong term

 Calcutta, Nov. 15: The Bengal Congress has decided to field a candidate against the Trinamul Congress for the Islampur Assembly seat but is keeping the option of withdrawal open, reports our special correspondent.

 The party said it would not contest the seat if the Trinamul withdraws support to a no-confidence motion against the Congress chairman of the Islampur municipality.

 The Trinamuls rejection of the Congresss term would mean a breakdown of the unofficial alliance the two parties had forged for the September 16 bypolls.

 50:50 Congress licks wounds

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi, Jan. 19: Congress strategists are trying to make the best of a grim situation after what a senior leader described as H.D. Deve Gowdas deadly blow two days before the party begins its Hyderabad plenary.

 Insiders said Karnataka governor T.N. Chaturvedis decision to give chief minister Dharam Singh eight days to prove his majority has given the party a small breather.

 On the other side of the divide, BJP central leaders, who are sniffing power in the southern state, described the decision as a grave constitutional error. Raj Bhavans are not expected to allow time to cobble together a majority but give just enough time to prove majority, general secretary Arun Jaitley said.

 When the Assembly session is on, there is no need for any advance notice and the trial of strength can be even on a days notice.

 Congress sources welcomed the respite, but put the chances of the 18-month-old coalitions survival at 50:50. They said if the Congress-JD(S) alliance were to continue, it would be on Gowdas terms. This would possibly mean the JD(S) leaders son, H.D. Kumaraswamy ? who led the over 40-strong JD(S) breakaway group to Chaturvedi and staked claim to form a new government ? will become chief minister.

 The JD(S), the sources added, would also get the majority of the cabinet berths.

 The sources said such an arrangement is largely unacceptable to the rank and file and state leaders, many of whom had opposed the alliance with Gowda.

 This morning, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Congress chief Sonia Gandhi, her political secretary Ahmed Patel, cabinet ministers Pranab Mukherjee and Shivraj Patil and the general secretary in charge of Karnataka, A.K. Antony, met to discuss the situation. It is believed that among the options discussed at the meeting, in the Prime Ministers residence, was support to a JD(S) government from outside.

 The sources said the broad consensus was if the situation could be salvaged, well and good, but if a majority of JD(S) legislators were bent on going with the BJP, Dharam Singh should step down.

 In the 224-strong House, the Congress has the support of 64 members, the BJP 76 and the JD(S) 53. The BJPs support is enough for Kumaraswamy to form a government.

 We did not expect these developments because this coalition was formed only to prevent the BJP from coming to power, Antony told reporters. But we are hopeful we will be able to save the government.

 The high command has decided that Dharam Singh and state unit chief Mallikarjun Kharge should speak to Gowda in as conciliatory a language as possible and see if the former Prime Minister could prevent a split in his party.

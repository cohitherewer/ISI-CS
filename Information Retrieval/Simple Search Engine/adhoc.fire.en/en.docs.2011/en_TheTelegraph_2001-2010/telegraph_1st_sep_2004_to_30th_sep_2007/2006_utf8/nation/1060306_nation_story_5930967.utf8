 Rival stamp, with riders

 New Delhi, March 5: Three days before Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs scheduled statement in Parliament on George W. Bushs visit, the BJP stamped its seal of approval on the nuclear deal, though with several caveats.

 The Opposition partys main reservation was whether the deal would fully serve Indias national interests and not become a nightmare of the future through shoddy and inept implementation. 

 A four-page statement by Jaswant Singh, leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha, said: Indias assertions of being part of the solution, not a problem, appear to have also been compromised by the governments handling of this issue. The government must, therefore, fully satisfy the country (on) how our national interests will continue to be fully subserved. 

 Jaswant, who is a former finance and external affairs minister, said the various statements related to the issue ? the July 18, 2005, and March 2 agreements and those put out by Indian and US officials ? created disparities and caused confusion. 

 It is the duty of the government to explain (the statements) fully and to the total satisfaction of the country, he stressed.

 It was the first substantive response from the BJP and the timing surprised observers as the partys spokespersons had till yesterday said they would speak only after the Prime Minister had spoken. 

 Asked about the timing of his statement at a press briefing this evening, Jaswant said the government apparently went into an overdrive to give the impression that the deal was perfect through leaks to the press from its officials and political leaders before the Prime Minister informed Parliament. 

 Therefore, it was important to focus on the Oppositions concerns and misgivings so that these were not relegated to the background, he added.

 Claiming that the latest Bush-Singh statement was an explicit confirmation by the present UPA government of the continuing validity of the BJP-NDA government, Jaswant alleged that the government had surrendered on two important counts. 

 First, according to the reported separation plan, two-thirds of the nuclear power plants would be placed under International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards, which could result in a gap on the fissile material available for weapons purposes. 

 Second, the March 2 agreement to put the civilian nuclear reactors under the IAEA safeguards clearly contradicted the governments earlier assertion that India had been recognised as a nuclear weapons state.

 He raised a series of questions such as, if perpetual safeguards did not govern nuclear weapons states, why would they now apply to India when the government stated it was on the same high table as these states? Also, how does this protect Indias nuclear programme as also its strategic autonomy?

 Jaswant also demanded to know if India would have the same responsibilities with the IAEA as the other advanced nuclear states, whether safeguards in perpetuity will be perpetually locked in with fuel supply, what India-specific safeguards with the IAEA meant and whether the government had built exit clauses should this agreement be rejected by US Congress.

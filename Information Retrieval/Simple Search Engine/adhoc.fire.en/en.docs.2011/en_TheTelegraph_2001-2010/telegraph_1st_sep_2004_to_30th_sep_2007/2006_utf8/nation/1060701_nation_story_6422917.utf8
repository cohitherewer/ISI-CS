The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Declared innocent after death

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, June 30: A fortnight after Shankar Biswas died having spent eight years in jail and suffered from acute depression, Calcutta High Court declared him innocent. 

 The prosecution has failed to prove that Shankar Biswas was responsible for his wifes death, the court said.

 Two leaders of the CPM womens wing, Mary Mahato and Moitrayee Chowdhury, were held responsible for instigating people against Biswas, a primary school teacher.

 Convicted for abetting his wife Jayas suicide in 1998, Biswas was released from Midnapore Central Jail only last month.

 The division bench of Justices Aloke Kumar Basu and Tapas Giri today said: The women leaders forced Jayas brother Biswajit Sen and his wife Swapna to lodge an FIR against Shankar Biswas.

 In January 1992, Biswas, a resident of Raghunathpur in West Midnapores Jhargram, married Jaya, a resident of Krishnagar in Nadia. 

 Within a fortnight of marriage, Jaya consumed sleeping pills. She was hospitalised in an unconscious state and died before Biswajit and Swapna arrived.

 Immediately after the death, a mob led by the Ganatantrik Mahila Samiti leaders gheraoed Jhargram police station and Biswajit and Swapna lodged the complaint alleging that Jaya committed suicide unable to bear her husband and mother-in-laws torture. 

 In February 1998, a Midnapore additional sessions judge declared them guilty and sentenced them to eight years rigorous imprisonment.

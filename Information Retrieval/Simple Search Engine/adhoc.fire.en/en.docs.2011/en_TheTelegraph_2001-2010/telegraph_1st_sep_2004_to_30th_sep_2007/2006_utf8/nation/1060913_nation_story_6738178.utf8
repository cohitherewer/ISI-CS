 Quota chasm swallows AIIMS poll

 New Delhi, Sept. 12: Caste had split the All India Institute of Medical Sciences during the quota agitation. Caste has now mired a campus election.

 Todays polls at the AIIMS resident doctors association (RDA) whose outgoing panel had led the countrywide anti-quota protests were being called a referendum on reservation. But all they have thrown up are allegations of casteist abuse and threats.

 To begin with, the campaign pamphlet of the anti-quota group a copy is with The Telegraph mentions its intention to wipe out the disease of caste-based reservations from India.

 And today, reserved category students whom the polls would have pitted against the anti-quota lobby pulled out alleging a rise in acts of discrimination by general-category students.

 The Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe students sent copies of a letter stating their intention to boycott the polls to the Prime Ministers Office, health minister (also AIIMS president), National Human Rights Commission and the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Commission.

 These students say the caste-based harassment of the past few days has turned the atmosphere non-conducive for elections.

 Jatinder Meena, a 17-year-old first-year MBBS student from the SC category, was locked up in his room a few days ago. Sunil Jeph, gymkhana secretary, was allegedly beaten up by a gang of general-category students.

 Umakant Nagar, as reported by The Telegraph on July 5, had to leave his hostel room after abuses and threats were written on his door.

 While acts of discrimination have happened before, there has been a spurt over the past few days and the administration appears to be backing them (upper-caste students). SC/ST students have been threatened against voting, and many are too scared to come out and vote, said Dr Kapil Yadav, the pro-quota groups presidential candidate.

 Late last night, the SC/ST candidates met AIIMS director P. Venugopal to seek a postponement of the polls. He was handed letters from victimised students naming their alleged tormentors.

 Institute spokesperson Shakti Gupta confirmed that the complaints had been received but argued that there wasnt sufficient ground to put off the polls.

 Told that the withdrawal of the main opposition had turned the elections into a farce, he said: We are trying to make sure the SC/ST students do not feel discriminated (against).

 The Telegraph, however, has a copy of a letter written to the AIIMS director by the anti-quota election panel, admitting to having made provocative remarks. We apologise for having made these remarks, which have offended some people, it says.

 A senior RDA member brazenly admitted to this correspondent that he had indeed threatened Kapil Yadav over the telephone. Dont make such a big deal of it, he added.

 For the record, the anti-quota lobby won, drubbing fringe opposition.

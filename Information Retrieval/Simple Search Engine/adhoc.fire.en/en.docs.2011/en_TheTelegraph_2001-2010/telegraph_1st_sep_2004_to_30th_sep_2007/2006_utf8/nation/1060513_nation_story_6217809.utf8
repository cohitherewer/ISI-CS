The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Even if united, Mamata no match for CPM

 ASHIS CHAKRABARTI

 This was the poll arithmetic that Mamata Banerjee got all wrong. She claimed that her dream of a peoples mahajot against the Left had actually come true in 80 per cent of the 293 Assembly constituencies in Bengal. The detailed results now show that no such thing happened, except in stray cases like Jalpaiguri, Katwa and Hasan. But what if it did?

 A divided Opposition may have made it a cakewalk for the Left Front in Bengal. But the results indicate that even a combined Opposition of the Congress, Trinamul Congress and the BJP would not have been able to knock the Left out of power in these elections. 

 Add the votes of the Congress and its allies to those of the Trinamul-BJP alliance, a united Opposition tally would have stood at 112 and the Left Fronts at 173, comfortably higher than the 148 required for a simple majority. In other words, a combined Opposition would have notched up 62 more seats. Trinamul got 29 and the Congress 21 this time. 

 But then, if the BJP is thrown into a mahajot with the Congress and Trinamul, a larger share of the minority vote could have moved away from it to the Left. So could some secular votes that are traditionally anti-Left. So, the story of another possible 62 seats for a combined Opposition is more arithmetic than actual politics. 

 If these polls marked a dramatic reduction in the vote share of Trinamul, the trend had been set in the Lok Sabha elections of 2004, when the percentage of its vote dropped by 8.85 per cent in comparison with the 1999 parliamentary polls.

 The Left Fronts vote share too was almost a repeat of the same in the 2004 parliamentary polls. In 2004, it was 50.72 per cent and it dropped marginally to 50.49 per cent of the total votes in these Assembly elections. The Trinamul-BJP alliances vote this time was 28.53 per cent ? down from 29.1 per cent in 2004 and the Congress-led combines share was 15.38 per cent. 

 The results also come as further evidence that Mamatas choice of the BJP, and not the Congress, as the alliance partner cost her heavily. With the BJP as her ally, she could notch up just 28.6 per cent this time. In 2001, her alliance with the Congress got her 38.95 per cent of the votes, against the Lefts 48.99 per cent. 

 Her assumption that the Congress would further shrink under the weight of her politics was also proved wrong. Trinamul still remained the principal Opposition party, albeit much reduced in size, but the Congress held on to a large number of votes ? 58,51,123, against Trinamuls 1,04,64,718. The Lefts total votes numbered 1,97,77,259. 

 The Congresss tally and its vote could have gone up higher if it had not fared so badly in its two strongholds of Malda and Murshidabad. 

 There was yet another interesting contrast between the pictures in the winning and the losing camps. The Left onslaught was all over the state and across all sections of the population. The agrarian belts of north and south Bengal voted for the Left as enthusiastically as the industrial areas in Howrah, Hooghly, North 24-Parganas and Burdwan. 

 Contrast this with the Opposition camp. Trinamul has been a party of south Bengal, or more precisely, of Calcutta and four other districts in its hinterland. The Congress could not damage Trinamuls chances in Calcutta and South 24-Parganas as much as Trinamul hurt the Congress in north Bengal. 

 Some results confirm the other suspicion that Trinamuls alliance with the BJP had cost it a large share of the Muslim votes, especially in urban, semi-urban and industrial areas. 

 The Lefts near-clean sweep in the industrial belt in North 24-Parganas, Howrah and Hooghly, where there are large populations of Urdu-speaking Muslims, seems to indicate this. These sections have a voting behaviour distinct from that of the Bengali-speaking Muslims of the rural areas. 

 Not only did these Muslims move away from Trinamul but they also moved to the Congress wherever the latter offered a better choice. This may largely explain the victory of a lesser known Congress candidate over the CPM veteran, Mohammed Amin, at Garden Reach as well as the predictable win of the Congress old-timer, Ram Pyare Ram, in neighbouring Kabitirtha. It may not be a coincidence that Sonia Gandhis brief meetings in Calcutta were all in Muslim-dominated areas. 

 The victory of Trinamuls Javed Khan over the CPMs Rabin Dev is an exception to this pattern, due perhaps to Khans own work in the area as a mayor-in-council member in the last Calcutta Municipal Corporation board and the relatively larger presence of the anti-Left sentiment in the upper-class parts of the Ballygunge constituency.

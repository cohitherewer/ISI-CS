 Cong gets another scare, from Vaiko

 New Delhi, Feb. 14: Days after the Karnataka coalition came unstuck, the secular alliance in Tamil Nadu is threatening to splinter. 

 With about three months to go for the Assembly elections, Vaiko may walk out of the DMK-led Democratic Progressive Alliance, which swept the Lok Sabha polls in 2004. 

 Sources in Vaikos MDMK said their leader was peeved with the DMKs big brother attitude and has hinted that if he did not get the number of seats he wanted in the Assembly polls, he would join the ADMK, the DMKs arch rival.

 It is believed that Jayalalithaa, the ADMK chief and Tamil Nadu chief minister, has assured Vaiko he would get as many seats as he wants and talks have reached an advanced stage. 

 The sources close to Vaiko said he would announce his decision of severing ties with the DPA on February 25, if Karunanidhi continued to remain unaccommodating on seat sharing. 

 But the DMKs troubles do not end here. Actor and the DMKs Rajya Sabha MP Sarath Kumar may also leave it and campaign for Jayalalithaa. Jayalalithaas camp will have another star. Actor Rajnikanth has decided to canvass for her.

 Also, former state Congress chief Dindivanam K. Ramamurthy, who felt slighted when G.K. Vasan was brought in his place, is likely to go with the ADMK. 

 But Congress sources said what worried the party, also a part of the alliance, most was the prospect of Vaikos exit. If the MDMK quits the alliance, the unbeatable caste coalition would come apart. Sources said neither the M. Karunanidhi-led DMK nor the PMK, its ally, has much of a caste following in the southern districts. South of Madurai, the MDMK, with its 4 per cent vote base, was the vital add-on. 

 Jayalalithaas base among the Thevars, a dominant caste in south Tamil Nadu, and the Dalits, with Vaikos following among the Naidus is being seen as an invincible combination.

 Vaiko, who was in Delhi today, said he still remained in the alliance. The status quo continues, he said.

 However, it is believed that in his meeting with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh last night, the MDMK chief indicated he was looking at the kind of arrangement Ram Vilas Paswan had in Bihar. Paswan had contested against the UPA in many seats but continued to be part of the central alliance. 

 Vaiko reportedly told Singh even if he came out of the DPA he would not pull out of the UPA in Delhi. Congress sources said they had no choice but to accept it.

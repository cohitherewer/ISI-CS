 Model rape

 Mumbai, May 22 (PTI): A South African model, who was allegedly raped by two youths at a hotel in Ulhasnagar last December, today moved a sessions court urging it to expedite the trial.

 However, the court refused to admit the application, asking her lawyer Falguni Brahmabhatt to first get it registered in the court registry.

 Both the accused are out on bail. The case has been adjourned till July 1, and the court is yet to frame the charges.

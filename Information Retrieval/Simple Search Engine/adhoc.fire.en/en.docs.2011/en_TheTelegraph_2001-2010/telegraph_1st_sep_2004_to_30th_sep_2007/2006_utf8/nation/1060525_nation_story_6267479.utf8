 Court slaps CAS deadline on govt

New Delhi (PTI): Delhi High Court has directed the 

Centre to take a categorical stand on the introduction of the conditional access 

system (CAS) before July 5.

 We will not give you any further time. You tell us whether you can implement it or not. Otherwise, approach the Supreme Court, a division bench headed by acting Chief Justice Vijender Jain told the additional solicitor-general P.P. Malhotra, who pleaded that the government needed at least 265 more days to implement the system in New Delhi, Mumbai and Calcutta.

 The stricture followed senior counsel Ram Jethmalanis insistence that the Centre should pay a compensation of Rs 1,000 crore to the multi-system operators who have invested in the infrastructure necessary for the CAS.

 He alleged that the Centre was adopting an intransigent stance on the implementation for two years despite several assurances to the court on the same.

 1-year jail for Rs 100 bribe

 New Delhi, March 6 (PTI): A junior telecom officer was today given a years rigorous imprisonment for accepting Rs 100 as bribe seven years ago.

 Special judge Sunil Gaur found Niranjan Singh guilty under various sections of the Prevention of Corruption Act and also imposed a fine of Rs 4,000 on him.

 According to a complaint lodged by Patel Nagar resident Ashok Puri on May 10, 1999, the accused, stationed at Rajindra Bhavan exchange, demanded Rs 400 as fee for activating a newly-installed phone connection at his residence.

 Puri lodged a complaint with the anti-corruption branch, which caught him red-handed accepting Rs 100 from the complainant.

 The court has also ordered a departmental inquiry against one of the prosecution witnesses, a government official, for turning hostile. 

 In another incident in Chennai, Madras High Court today upheld the order of the commissioner of Tamil Nadu special commercial taxes dismissing a clerk for taking a bribe of Rs 10. 

 Dismissing a petition by the clerk, J. Karunanidhi, seeking to quash the order removing him from service on February 25, 1993, the high court said it had been proved that he had taken the bribe. 

 The contention that the amount involved was only Rs 10 is immaterial in view of the various decisions of the Supreme Court and other courts, it said.

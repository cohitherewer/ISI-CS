 Sonia visit in protocol storm

 - Pauper Congress spends Rs 50 lakh to welcome chief

 Bhopal, July 2: Her partymen want to make it a memorable Monday, but Sonia Gandhis visit to the city is proving to be a protocol nightmare.

 The Congress chief is scheduled to launch an urban renewal project tomorrow at a function here that governor Balram Jakhar and chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan will attend.

 The ruling BJP is upset that Sonia will be the chief guest at a programme to be presided over by a constitutional authority.

 Late in the evening, the Madhya Pradesh government received a communication from Union home secretary V.K. Duggal, who quoted Pandit Jawahar Lal Nehru as saying that in the event of the presence of an eminent person, the protocol involving high offices can be given the go-by.

 Sources said it is chief minister Chauhan who was invited by the Congress-run Bhopal Municipal Corporation to preside over the function, but some state Congress leaders intervened. They said it is Jakhar who should chair the programme, without realising the protocol implications.

 Official sources said Sonias status as member of Parliament should have been borne in mind while preparing the guest list. Following her resignation as National Advisory Council chief, she comes below the governor, the chief minister and even a minister of state.

 Sources close to Chauhan said he does not want to play up the issue and has told the state BJP leadership that Sonia is a guest and should be respected as one. The chief minister is said to have observed that he is all for cordial ties with the Congress-led Centre despite the ideological divide.

 It is learnt that a minister in the Union government was primarily responsible for the controversy. There are five central ministers from the state ? Arjun Singh, Kamal Nath, Suresh Pachauri, Kantilal Bhuria and Hansraj Bhardwaj.

 On the eve of Sonias visit, the city is awash in Congress colours: party flags and banners flutter in the wind and cutouts tower over streets. The extravaganza, by a conservative estimate, is worth at least Rs 50 lakh, never mind the acute cash crunch the state unit is going through.

 The state Congress is so poor that it has sacked dozens of employees. In fact, the coffers have run so dry that some telephone lines have been disconnected and leaders have been told to cough up Rs 1,000 if they want to use party premises for press conferences.

 But Madhya Pradesh Congress leaders have decided to be on their Monday best for their party chief who will be visiting the state capital for the first time since the United Progressive Alliance came to power at the Centre two years ago.

 All to gloss over the internal squabbles, the acute cash crunch and the failure to act as an effective Opposition to the BJP. The party has failed to lead any popular stir against the Chauhan government, preferring to issue statements rather than slugging it out in the field.

 If Sonia, who will also inaugurate a school and address a state-level party convention, chooses to take a closer look at the posters and banners, she would see a pattern.

 Not a single one carries names or photographs of all the important state leaders. In other words, if a poster welcomes Sonia on behalf of Pachauri, it will have no mention of Digvijay Singh or Arjun. If the Arjun camp is seen as rolling out the red carpet, state unit chief Subhash Yadav will be missing.

 Things have come to such a pass that many senior members of the state organisation, like leader of Opposition Jamuna Devi, are not on talking terms with Yadav.

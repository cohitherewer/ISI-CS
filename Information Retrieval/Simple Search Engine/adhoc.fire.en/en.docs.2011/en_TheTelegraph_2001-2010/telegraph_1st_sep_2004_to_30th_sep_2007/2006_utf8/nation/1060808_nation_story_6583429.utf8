 Left to keep off privilege motion

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Karat

New Delhi, Aug. 7: The Left parties today decided not to support Natwar Singhs privilege motion against the Prime Minister but said the Pathak report leak merits consideration for breach of privilege of Parliament.

 CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury claimed at a news conference that the Lefts dissociation from the motion was technical. 

 We could not associate ourselves with the privilege motion because it was moved before. Our signatures are not there. But it constitutes a breach of privilege because the report was leaked before it was tabled in Parliament.

 The CPM would wait till further investigations are done before reaching any conclusion, Yechury said.

 Natwar Singh has been exonerated as far as corruption charges are concerned. There is still the charge that he helped people make money. But Natwar has said the letters (proving the charges) are not authentic.

 On Natwar misusing his position, Yechury said: Natwar at that time was not a minister or an MP. If he misused his position, he must have done so as a Congress leader. It is, therefore, up to the Congress to decide what it wants to do with Natwar.

 Although the Left has distanced itself from the privilege motion, it had looked on Natwar as an ally when he spoke their language on the Indo-US nuclear deal as foreign minister. 

 The Left is still locked in a tussle with the government on the deal.

 Yechury also reiterated the partys demand that Reliance be probed for the alleged benefits it received in the Iraqi oil-for-food scam.

 I had raised the Reliance issue on the floor of Rajya Sabha at the time the controversy broke out. The finance minister had assured that the government will pursue the matter.

 On Saturday, CPM general secretary Prakash Karat had raked up the issue: Reliance has got the maximum number of vouchers. It has paid the maximum surcharge. But no investigation has been carried out.

 A Left leader said the leak was threatening to push the nuclear deal standoff into the background. 

 The Natwar Singh issue has overshadowed the nuclear deal issue, he said.

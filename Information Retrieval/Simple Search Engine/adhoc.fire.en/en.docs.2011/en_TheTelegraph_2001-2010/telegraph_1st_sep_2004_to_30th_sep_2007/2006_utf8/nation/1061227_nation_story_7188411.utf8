 Pipe dream whiff in Iran gas pipeline

 G.S. MUDUR

 New Delhi, Dec. 26: India may be chasing the Iran-Pakistan-India gas pipeline in futility because Iran may soon be unable to export natural gas, a new research study has indicated.

 Although Iran has the worlds second largest natural gas reserves and vast oil deposits, the country may be forced to rethink its gas exports to cope with a looming petroleum crisis, according to the study by Roger Stern, a researcher at the department of geography and environmental engineering at Johns Hopkins University in the US. 

 In an analysis of Irans oil and gas production and demand trends, Stern said the countrys oil exports may drop to zero as early as 2014-15. 

 His study, published today in the US journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, said this export extinction may be preceded by a 33 per cent decline from its 2006 exports by the year 2011. 

 The shortfall in oil production springs from investment problems, a sharp growth in domestic demand, and a shortage of gas for reinjection a technique that is used to boost capacity from old oil fields. 

 There is the lack of investment. There is political division within Iran in which conservatives seek to limit exports to preserve gas for reinjection. And there is exploding domestic demand, Stern told The Telegraph in a telephone interview. 

 The gas export problem also has several components. Energy subsidies have created a high demand growth in the country. The global rate is a litt le over 2 per cent per year, while Irans is nearly 6 per cent.

 Irans 6.4 per cent growth in its energy demand since 1980 has exceeded its 5.6 per cent growth in supply, and its oil exports have been stagnant over the past decade. 

 And Irans petroleum investment climate appears to have deteriorated since 1998-2004, a period when investment was insufficient to offset production decline, Stern said. 

 While Iran is seeking to export LNG, this effort seems a disaster in waiting because any success will further reduce gas available for reinjection, he said. 

 Remarkably, India is proceeding with an agreement for an Iran-Pakistan-India gas pipeline, apparently oblivious to what is common knowledge from Majlis (the Iranian parliament) to the trade press: Irani gas is overcommitted, Stern said. 

 He said this situation will persist even when Irans new South Pars gas becomes available. It, therefore, seems open to question whether Iran will continue gas exports should oil exports decline precipitously for lack of reinjection.

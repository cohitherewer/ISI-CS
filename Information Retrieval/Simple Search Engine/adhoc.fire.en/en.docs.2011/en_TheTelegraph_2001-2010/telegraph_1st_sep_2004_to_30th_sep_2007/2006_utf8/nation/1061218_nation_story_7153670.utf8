The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Bye-bye Bhopal, hello Bhojpal

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Bhopal, Dec. 17: After bye-bye black sheep, it may be bye-bye Bhopal.

 The BJP regime in Madhya Pradesh, which has banished English nursery rhymes like Baa, baa, black sheep from government schools to save Indian culture, wants to rename Bhopal as Bhojpal.

 And Indore as Indur, Jabalpur as Jabalipuram and Ujjain as Ujjaini.

 Unlike the renaming of Bombay, Calcutta or Bangalore which switched to names long used in their local tongues these changes are to be a historical rather than linguistic exercise.

 The BJP-ruled Jabalpur Municipal Corporation (JMC) has moved a resolution to junk the name derived from the Arabic word jabal (hill).

 Jabalipuram, mayor Sushila Singh says, is in keeping with Indian history and culture. The sage Jabali apparently lived in the area during the Ramayan era.

 The Congress is supportive. The leader of the JMC Opposition, Bahadur Singh, claimed he suggested the idea first. The mayor, instead of moving my resolution, piloted it herself to gain political mileage.

 BJP minister and senior Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh official Anil Dave said the party wants the government to rename Bhopal, Indore and Ujjain, too.

 Every race has a right to be proud of its history and historical figures. The legendary Raja Bhoj must get his due with the state capital renamed Bhojpal.

 In 2004, then chief minister Uma Bharti had mooted the new name. She had also banned liquor and meat in several temple towns.

 The Congress is against renaming Bhopal. Party MLA B.S. Rathore said the town was founded by Afghan chieftain Dost Mohammad Khan in the 18th century. Besides, whats the use of changing names? People want fresh drinking water, electricity and good roads.

 Indore, BJP activists say, must be known as Indur, the seat of Maratha dynasty Holkars power. The city, founded in 1715, derived its name from the Indreshwar temple, built in 1741.

 The whole idea (of renaming) is politically motivated. There has been no discussion or referendum, Congress spokesman Manak Aggarwal said. He added that civic bodies are not empowered to change town names.

 Jabalpur-based historian Arvind Pal said: We are not sure where and when the sage Jabali lived. He is a mythological figure. Its absurd to change the name just because the word jabal is Arabic.

 Jabalpur is located between the Vindhya and Satpura ranges at the Marble Rocks gorge on the Narmadas banks.

 Changing Ujjain to Ujjaini may not face much resistance, though. It will be a return to an ancient name, in vogue even during the Buddhas times when the city was the capital of the kingdom of Avanti.

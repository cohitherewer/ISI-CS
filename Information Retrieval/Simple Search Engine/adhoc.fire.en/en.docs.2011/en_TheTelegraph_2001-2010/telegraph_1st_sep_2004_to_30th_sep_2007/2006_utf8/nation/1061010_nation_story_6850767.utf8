 Notice on private quota clause

 New Delhi: The Supreme Court has 

 issued a notice to the Centre on a petition challenging 

 the validity of the 93rd constitutional amendment that allows 

 enactment of laws to provide reservation in private aided 

 and unaided educational institutions.

 A bench headed by Justice Arijit Pasayat also sent a notice to the Tamil Nadu government, which passed a law in force since June 7 this year reserving 69 per cent of seats in all aided and unaided institutions.

 The explanations were called for during hearings on a petition filed by a voluntary consumer organisation that sought to quash Article 15 (5). This provision, introduced through the 93rd amendment, also paved the way for the legislation passed by the Tamil Nadu Assembly.

 Bill blow to insurance firms

 New Delhi (PTI): Insurance companies 

 will find it difficult to deny claims to policy-holders 

 on flimsy grounds once Parliament approves an 

 amendment to the Consumer Protection Act, the consumer affairs 

 ministry has said.

 The proposed bill is meant to empower consumer courts to strike down what is technically called unfair terms of contract on the basis of which companies may deny due share to consumers, consumer affairs secretary Lalit Mansingh said.

 Mansingh said there is a general impression that the facility is abused by some but that cannot be a pretext for denying claims to genuine customers on flimsy clauses in the agreement.

 The ministry plans to introduce the bill in the next session of Parliament. 

 Temple RDX

 Jammu (PTI): Twenty-five kg 

 of RDX has been found buried near Sukrala temple in Doda 

 district, a few days ahead of its annual festival.

 The explosives, along with detonators, were buried in a field. Security forces suspect militants had planned a blast during the festival.

 Cracker deaths

 Kanpur (PTI): Six persons, 

 including a woman and her two children, were killed and 

 six injured, three of them seriously, when an explosion 

 took place in a slum area near the Indian Air Force station 

 at Chakeri. The incident happened when some people were 

 illegally making firecrackers in the slum.

 Newborn missing

 Kanpur (PTI): An infant has 

 been reported missing from a hospital in Kanpur two days 

 after it was born to a villager, police said. Hospital authorities 

 have launched a search for the missing baby. 

 The Goa government has signed an agreement with 

 the Centre for organising the International Film Festival 

 of India (IIFI) 2006. The event begins on November 23.

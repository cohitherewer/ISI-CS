 Mumbai, Oct. 9: Its like living in a fortress and under a curfew, and will be so over the next month for residents at Punes Sindh Cooperative Housing Society. But with Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt on the premises, they dont seem to mind too much.

 We have been asked to carry specially made passes to be allowed into the premises. Our school-going children even the household helps have to show their passes at the gates, a resident said.

 Brangelina arrived around eight in the morning and began shooting at Nayansukh bungalow, where workmen had toiled at a frenzied pace till yesterday to complete the interiors.

 This is an anti-terrorism movie, so we are not taking any chances. We are not allowing any vehicle thats without the mandatory stickers issued by the society, said the chief of security, Sindh Society, Srinivas Rao.

 The society has hired 40-odd security personnel to keep the media and the crowds of curious onlookers at bay. This is in addition to the 15 men from Tops Security and the star couples personal staff. While some reporters waited outside today, others chose to stay away. The arrangements are so strict that even vendors have been issued temporary entry passes.

 Theres a gag order too residents have been asked not to speak to the media and stay away from the Nayansukh bungalow while shooting is on.

 Better still, they have been told, they should stay at home and not step out on the road in front of Nayansukh bungalow for the duration of the shoot. The film crew is yet to provide the society with the schedule for the filming.

 Its not only the residents who have been asked to stay away. Even I cannot go there. They should understand that we are doing this for their own safety. Given the times, one has to be careful, Rao said.

 Some of the residents worry about the sudden rise in visitors to the housing society.

 We knew that as soon as the stars came in, there would be a lot of ruckus. We have 50 unoccupied bungalows here and I am worried that bad elements might slip into the premises posing as crew members, a resident said.

 There are a lot of places to hide here. Its a little difficult, but at least the security is geared to take on this added pressure.

 The security personnel have their own problems. The Bank of Maharashtra has a branch within the premises and customers keep entering and leaving through the societys gates at all times of the day. There are so many kinds of people coming to the bank we let in only those who have a passbook, Rao said.

 VP declares war on Mulayam

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Rallying together: Lalu Prasad and 

 Ram Vilas Paswan at the Jan Morcha rally on Tuesday 

 (PTI)

 Lucknow, May 30: He is on dialysis and his rivals think he is a spent force. But former Prime Minister V.P. Singh has shown that when it comes to a fight he has enough fire left in him.

 Enough to bring together squabbling allies like Lalu Prasad and Ram Vilas Paswan on the same platform against a common enemy ? Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav.

 Singh, who triggered the Mandal upheaval in the nineties, today blasted Mulayam for his governments failures as his Jan Morcha, a confederation of at least 15 parties, declared open war against the ruling Samajwadi Party.

 Even at this age, I am ready to face blows of lathis and tear gas shells for farmers, weavers and marginalised sections who are being deprived of their dues here in Uttar Pradesh, Singh told a 50,000-strong crowd at a rally on the sprawling Laxman Mela grounds.

 He (Mulayam) said (HRD minister) Arjun Singh should be sent to jail for his announcement on reservations. If he sends Arjun Singh to jail for his sins on reservation, what would he do to me for my role in 1989? He should probably send me to the gallows.

 As he spoke, flags of 15 different shades fluttered in the breeze ? a sign of the resentment that has coalesced into a force ready to take on Mulayam when the state goes to polls next year.

 Five minutes into his speech, Singh asked for a chair. The sultry afternoon had taken its toll and he could not stand before the microphone any longer. But his final words gave no hint of the physical discomfort. This, he said, is a fight through fire.

 Lalu Prasad said Mulayam calls himself a secular leader, yet splits secular votes. He has exposed himself as an agent of the BJP.

 V.P. Singh, the railway minister added, was our leader in the mid-eighties and he is still my leader. I will devote myself full time during the polls to campaign for the Jan Morcha.

 Paswan said despite all his rhetoric, Mulayam has never tried to empower the poor. 

 A new era of Dalit politics would now begin under the leadership of V.P. Singh, the architect of social change in the country, the Union minister added.

 Among the Left leaders at the rally, the CPIs A.B. Bardhan praised Singh for putting together such a massive show. That you could wait since 9 in the morning till 3 has shown the level of anger against the ruling combine, he told the gathering. Now the challenge is to translate this anger into a wave for political change.

 Among the others present were actor-turned-politician Raj Babbar and Justice Party chief Udit Raj.

 Another former Prime Minister, Chandra Shekhar, could not attend the rally because of health reasons but sent a message, which was read out.

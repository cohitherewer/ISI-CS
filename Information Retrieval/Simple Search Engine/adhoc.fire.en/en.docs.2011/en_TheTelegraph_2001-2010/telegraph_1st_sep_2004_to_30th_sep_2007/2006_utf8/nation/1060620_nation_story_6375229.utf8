 Bail for Sahil, proof blow to cops

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 19: Five days after Rahul Mahajan walked into the waiting arms of his mother, it was the turn of Sahil Zaroos family and friends to celebrate his bail.

 Sahils chief defence council, Mohammed Aslam Goni, was seen hugging his clients father even before additional sessions and district judge S.N. Gupta finished reading out the ruling.

 One of Sahils friends, Fardeen, excitedly dialled relatives in Srinagar to share the good news.

 Sahil (in picture below) will, however, have to spend at least another night in jail as his Rs 2 lakh bail bond will be accepted only tomorrow morning.

 The judge today termed the evidence given by police as completely inadequate and said he had no doubt he was right in granting Sahil bail.

 He will, however, decide on the police plea for allowing narco-analysis and brain mapping on Rahul and Sahil on Monday.

 The prosecution spent the greater part of two hours trying to convince the judge that as the two had not cooperated during questioning, these tests were necessary. 

 But the defence contended that such things could be sanctioned only after trial begins. These cannot be used by police to procure evidence as they want, Goni said.

 The judge then put the matter off to Monday.

 Sahils lawyers, led by Goni and Manoj Dattar, then went to the court of the additional commissioner metropolitan magistrate where the first hearing in the shahtoosh shawls case will be held tomorrow. 

 Mumbai police have accused Sahil under the wildlife protection act for possessing and stealing prohibited shahtoosh shawls. They claim Sahil and two friends escaped with the shawls after a raid on Sahils uncles shop in Mumbai.

 While his friends, Rafique and Aliyah, were arrested and freed on bail, Sahil had been granted anticipatory bail which was later rejected.

 A Mumbai police squad wants to take Sahil with them. But their counterparts in Delhi feel it is essential he stay in the capital.

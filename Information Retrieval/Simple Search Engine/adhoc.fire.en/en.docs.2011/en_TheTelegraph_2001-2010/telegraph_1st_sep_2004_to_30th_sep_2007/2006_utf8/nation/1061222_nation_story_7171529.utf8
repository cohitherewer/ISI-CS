 Faith cry to block polio girls marriage

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Bhopal, Dec. 21: Rickshaw-puller Peter Abraham had offered polio-affected Meena Gond, 36, a chance at a new life. Government officials and Sangh parivar activists are working together to block the marriage on the ground that the orphaned tribal woman is likely to convert after the union.

 Abraham, 38, has handed the mandatory 40-day notice to the Jabalpur marriage officer, the lone marriage registrar in the district. The notice period ended on November 13, but the official, Deepak Singh, is refusing to register the marriage.

 We have received complaints and objections, Singh said without revealing the objectors names.

 An official of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad-affiliated Dharma Sena owned up to being an objector.

 Peter is a Christian. We suspect he has lured the innocent tribal girl offering her money. Meena will later be forced to change her religion, said Sudhir Aggarwal, Dharma Sena convener in the Mahakaushal region.

 We have definite knowledge that some Christian missionaries are doling out money to men like Peter to convert tribals.

 Meenas brother Radhey Gond denied the charge, saying he was touched by Peters offer to marry his sister. She can barely walk. We had all along thought that nobody would marry her.

 Radhey scoffed at the claim that Peter had offered money to the family. He has been a daily wage earner for years. How can a poor rickshaw-puller lure a woman with money?

 Jabalpur city Congress chief Naresh Saraf said his party would ensure that inter-faith marriages take place without hindrance.

 We have told district collector Sanjay Dubey that a massive protest would be launched if the couple is not allowed to marry before the New Year.

 The Sangh parivar is blocking the marriage at a time the Madhya Pradesh BJP government is offering a cash incentive of Rs 50,000 to any non-tribal marrying a tribal.

 Peter and Meena should be getting it in addition to the Rs 10,000 that the chief ministers pet Deendayal Antoday scheme offers to every couple from below the poverty line. Shivraj Singh Chauhan, who has blessed over 5,000 brides and grooms under this scheme, has earmarked Rs 5 crore for it in the current financial year.

 In Bhopal, tribal welfare commissioner K.K. Singh admitted that the state offered a cash incentive to anyone marrying a tribal, but provided a twist saying he was not sure if Christians and Muslims were entitled to it.

 You see, the broad objective of the scheme is to end social discrimination and untouchability. How can societies that do not have untouchability be eligible for the incentive?.

 Saraf said the schemes provisions make no reference to religion. 

 I have looked it up. It says anyone marrying a tribal is entitled to the award.

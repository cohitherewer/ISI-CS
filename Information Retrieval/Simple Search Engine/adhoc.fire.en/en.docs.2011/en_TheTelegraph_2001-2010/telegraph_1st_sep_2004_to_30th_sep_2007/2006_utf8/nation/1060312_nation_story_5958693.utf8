 Manmohan speaks up for unique shield

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 11: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today virtually admitted in Parliament that India has not been recognised as a de jure nuclear weapons state under the civilian nuclear cooperation deal with the US.

 This was evident from his defence of the India-specific safeguards agreement to be negotiated with the International Atomic Energy Agency which he said would be unique. Delhi would not accept the safeguards agreement applicable to non-nuclear weapon states, he added.

 But it was also clear that India was not being offered the voluntary safeguards agreement of nuclear weapon states.

 The creation of the unique category is necessary as India is not a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and is forced to accept permanent safeguards.

 Elaborating on why Delhi has sought India-specific safeguards, Singh said under the NPT, there are only two kinds of safeguards ? for nuclear weapon states and non-nuclear ones. A third category is being created for India.

 As all nuclear weapon states have a separate safeguards agreement and India does not fall in the second category of non-nuclear weapon states, it has pressed for working out separate India-specific safeguards at the IAEA, he said in the Rajya Sabha.

 In effect, the Prime Minister was admitting that India has not been recognised as a de jure nuclear weapons state.

 Allaying apprehensions of the Left and the Opposition, he said the implementation of the nuclear deal would depend on Washington fulfilling its obligations, including its ratification by the US Congress.

 The actual implementation of the agreed separation plan will be conditional upon the US Congress amending the existing laws and upon our negotiation with the IAEA on safeguards, he said. Only when these arrangements are in place, the implementation of a separation plan will take place. There is full reciprocity.

 Under the deal, Delhi has to separate its civilian and military nuclear programmes and place the civilian part under international supervision.

 Singh said there was no question of India accepting a cap on the countrys nuclear programme which would include minimum credible deterrence. We will take all possible steps to ensure that there is no adverse fallout on our research and development activities.

 The Prime Minister also denied allegations that the deal was struck on the assurance that India would buy $5 billion dollars worth of weapons from the US. 

 There was no such temptation. No negotiations were undertaken by me during President Bushs visit or (by) any of my officials, he said.

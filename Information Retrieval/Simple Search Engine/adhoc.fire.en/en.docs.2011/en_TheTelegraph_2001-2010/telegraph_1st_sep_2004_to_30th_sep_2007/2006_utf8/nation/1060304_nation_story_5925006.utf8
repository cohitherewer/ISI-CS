 Majors wife incites jawans

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Guwahati, March 3: Taking orders from an officers wife, army jawans yesterday ransacked a weaving centre in the central Assam town of Tezpur and assaulted the owners daughter and an employee, all for a salwar-kameez. 

 The owner of the ransacked shop, Ashirwad Textiles, said in his FIR at Tezpur police station that Amrita Saran, a majors wife, incited 8-10 jawans to go on a rampage after being told that the chunni (scarf) to go with the salwar-kameez fabric she had purchased was not ready. The complainant, Nilima Bora, said Saran had visited the shop on the previous two days, too, and allegedly abused the employees.

 The district administration promptly instituted an inquiry by subdivisional officer Dilip Das. Senior police officials, however, declined to comment on the fracas.

 The incident comes close on the heels of the uproar over the custody death of Ajit Mahanta, a resident of Kakopathar in Tinsukia district. 

 Bora said Saran first came to her shop on February 26 and placed an order. She visited Ashirwad Textiles again the next day to take delivery of the salwar-kameez fabric, but was told that the chunni would take some time to complete. 

 The FIR said Saran visited Ashirwad Textiles for the fifth time ? with her husband and a group of jawans in tow ? around 10.30 am yesterday. She allegedly asked the army personnel to ransack the centre and they immediately damaged three looms and disconnected the telephone. 

 The owner of the weaving centre claimed no delivery date had been fixed, but the majors wife insisted that she be given the scarf immediately.

 I explained to her that the chunni could not be completed because of technical reasons, but she was adamant. She left after misbehaving with us, but came back with her husband and some jawans. They beat up my 17-year-old daughter and one of my employees, Bora said.

 Saran left after warning me that she would take my daughter away if the chunni is not ready by Monday, Bora said.

 The army described the incident as a personal matter of the officer. It also claimed that nobody was assaulted. People with vested interests are at work to whip up anti-army sentiments, defence spokesperson Col Narendra Singh said.

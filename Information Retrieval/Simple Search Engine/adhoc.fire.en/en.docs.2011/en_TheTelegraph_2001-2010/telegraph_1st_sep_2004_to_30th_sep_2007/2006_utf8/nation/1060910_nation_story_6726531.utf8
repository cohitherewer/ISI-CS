 Pranab no to hot pursuit

 Calcutta, Sept. 9: Pranab Mukherjee today said India would not enter Bangladesh to dismantle terrorist camps there.

 Instead, we shall continue to persuade the Bangladesh government to destroy them. How can we go to another country and destroy terrorist camps there? the defence minister asked.

 Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee is believed to have asked the Centre to look into the matter in a meeting with the Prime Minister.

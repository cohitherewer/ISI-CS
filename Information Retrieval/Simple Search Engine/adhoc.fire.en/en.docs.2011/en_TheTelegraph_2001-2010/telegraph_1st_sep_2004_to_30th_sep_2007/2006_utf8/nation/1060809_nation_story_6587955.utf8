The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Rahul at the pulpit but no miracle 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Kanpur, Aug. 8: Rahul Gandhi 

 today waded deeper into the battle for the heartland but 

 cautioned the cheering Congress congregation against expecting 

 any miracle if the people of the state remained inactive.

 The Amethi member of Parliament took his message to the youths while addressing a meeting here.

 The youths have been at the receiving end of a decaying political culture in the state in which political parties used to take advantage of the caste-ridden society. The youths in the past 15 years had tolerated this but now they should not, he told a gathering that kept chanting to his mother Sonia Gandhi to gift us Rahul.

 We are ready see the response of the people here. The soldiers are ready but they want a commander. I would ask my party president to give us Rahul as commander, Pramod Tewari, the leader of the Congress Legislative Party said before the young MP came up to speak.

 Rahul was on guard, asking the young not to expect any miracle from an outsider. Everyone has to recognise his or her weaknesses and strengths. You have to organise yourself. There is a need for reconstruction of the state. But we have to do it together. No outsider can pull off any miracle, he said.

 But he shrugged off the cloak of caution when it came to the Mulayam Singh government and launched an attack. 

 What is happening to the youths in Uttar Pradesh on the eve of the poll? The state government here has suddenly remembered the youths and began offering unemployment dole. The dole will only create a strong sense of insecurity, he said.

 Pak stuck on Wagah force and farce show 

 Notwithstanding the peace overtures, Pakistan has said it would not stop or scale down the aggressive ritual by its border guards to mark the flag-lowering ceremony at the Wagah border everyday.

 Jawans of the Pakistan Rangers will stick to their traditional drill (in picture) at the border although India last week decided to tone down the aggressive posturing on its side, Lt Gen. Hussain Mehdi, director-general of Pakistan Rangers, Punjab, said.

 The decision was conveyed last week to BSF officials at the border point, a Pakistan Rangers official was quoted as saying by local newspaper Daily Times on Monday. 

 Officials here said the issue could informally figure in tomorrows foreign secretary-level talks in Delhi.

 The flag-lowering exercise performed by Pakistan Rangers and BSF soldiers at the checkpost every evening is considered a show of force and farce that draws hundreds of spectators on both sides of the border.

 Pakistan sees the event as a major tourist attraction, for which it has developed infrastructure around the place.

 Officials of both Pakistan Rangers and the BSF, during a meeting in March 2004, had reportedly agreed to abandon the aggressive posturing following the peace process but the agreement was not implemented, the newspaper said.

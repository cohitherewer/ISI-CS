 Record win for Azad

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Srinagar, April 27: Chief minister Ghulam Nabi Azad today swept into the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly, riding a record margin.

 The Congress veteran, chosen to head the Peoples Democratic Party-Congress government under a rotational arrangement, swamped his nearest BJP rival by 58,515 votes on homeground Bhaderwah in the hilly Doda district. 

 Azad polled 66,129 votes, the highest so far in the Bhaderwah seat and the highest by any chief minister in an Assembly election in the state.

 Today I have fulfilled my dream after my election to the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly from my home constituency Bhaderwah. It was my dream to contest elections from my native constituency, he said after the bypoll win, his first in the state in 28 years.

 I, therefore, opted for election rather than selection to the Assembly within the stipulated six-month period given to a chief minister, Azad, flanked by wife Shahmeema, added.

 The victory ended a long wait. He last fought an Assembly election in the state in 1977 from Inderwal, also in Doda. He had to forfeit his security deposit then.

 Todays results also saw the PDP, the Opposition National Conference and an Independent win a seat each in the 87-member House.

 In the Valley, Shia leader Iftikhar Hussain Ansari of the PDP lost to his National Conference rival Mustafa Kamal by 2,727 votes from Pattan. Kamal is the younger brother of National Conference patron Farooq Abdullah. 

 In Rafiabad, Mohammad Dilawar Mir of the PDP defeated his National Conference rival, advocate Mohammad Maqbool, by 8,659 votes.

 In Sangrama, Shoaib Lone, the National Conference-backed Independent candidate, defeated the PDPs Javaid Hussain Baig by 6,318 votes. Baig is the nephew of deputy chief minister and senior PDP leader Muzaffar Hussain Baig.

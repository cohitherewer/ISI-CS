The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Film case

 Mumbai, May 2 (PTI): A petition filed in Bombay High Court today sought a ban on the film Tickle My Funny Bone on the ground that its advertisement posters had hurt religious sentiments of many. 

 The petition filed by advocate Gerry Coelho is slated to come up for hearing tomorrow. 

 The petition alleged that the posters and advertisements of the film showed an actor dressed as a nun and had a church in the background with a caption the story of a sexy nun.

 It urged the court to ban the film, slated for release this month, and also to order seizure of its prints and posters.

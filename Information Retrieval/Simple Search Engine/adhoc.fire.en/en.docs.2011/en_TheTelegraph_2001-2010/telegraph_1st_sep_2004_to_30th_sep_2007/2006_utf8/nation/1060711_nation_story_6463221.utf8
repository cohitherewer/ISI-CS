 Sangh frowns, BJP acts

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 10: The RSS is not too pleased with the BJP leaderships perceived inability to tide it over internal problems and exploit the series of blunders that the Sangh feels the UPA government has committed of late.

 Perhaps to correct the Sanghs impression that he has not been able to assert his authority, party president Rajnath Singh did not invite L.K. Advani and A.B. Vajpayee to a meeting of general secretaries today.

 Advani had been a regular participant in such routine meetings. Senior leaders rushed to remove the impression that Rajnath did not call Advani to gain supremacy in the party. 

 Advaniji attends the core group meetings. At such meetings, everyone ? Venkaiah Naidu, Sushmaji ? everyone is present. This is a pure general secretaries meeting. There is no necessity for Advaniji to be present, said a senior leader. 

 The meeting discussed steps to carry forward the BJPs campaign against price rise.

 But the RSS does not sound too impressed. There is an inability to exploit the situation. Any other party would have milked it, but here (in the BJP) they are still grappling with the internal crisis, a Sangh leader said.

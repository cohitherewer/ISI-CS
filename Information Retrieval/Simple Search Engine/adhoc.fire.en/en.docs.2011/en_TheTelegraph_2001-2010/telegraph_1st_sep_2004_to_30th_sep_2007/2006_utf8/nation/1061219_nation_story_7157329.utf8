 Fun-but-healthy snacks on table

 New Delhi, Dec. 18: Soft drink giant PepsiCo says it is conscious of the issue of obesity and is producing healthier drinks and snacks action that the medical community here has termed refreshing.

 The company is finding ways to reduce fats, sugar and salt in its current line of fun-for-you products and treats such as soft drinks and chips, PepsiCo president and CEO Indra Nooyi said today.

 Well be introducing healthier soft drinks with fewer calories and no caffeine along with new flavour ideas, Nooyi said in a talk delivered at the American Chamber of Commerce-India and Confederation of Indian Industry.

 Every snack produced by the company in India is made without transfats, she said.

 Transfats are partially hydrogenated vegetable oils that medical researchers say are among the most harmful of edible fats. Doctors who have been tracking Indias obesity epidemic in the past have often called on the government to regulate transfats in food products.

 Such a promise is extremely refreshing, said Anoop Misra, head of diabetes and metabolic diseases at the Fortis Hospital in New Delhi.

 If the company takes such action, it could set in motion a movement in which other manufacturers also follow suit, Misra, whose studies have shown rising levels of obesity among Indias adolescents, added.

 In her talk, Nooyi described obesity as an urgent and complex problem, one involving both consumption and expenditure of calories ... a multifaceted problem requiring multidimensional solutions.

 While controlling calorie consumption is important, we need to do more to promote programmes that encourage exercise and physical activity, particularly in schools, she said.

 To counter the malaise of sedentary lifestyles, Nooyi said, the company has partnered with a non-government organisation to educate children on proper nutrition and exercise and will continue to sponsor sports.

 Sections of the medical community in India have long been urging the government to initiate policy measures to regulate the intake of fats through food products. 

 Experience from several countries shows that government policies that promote healthy behaviour are needed to bring about changes, according to public health experts.

 The primary issue until now was whether the government is going to act to ban transfats or not, Misra said. If we have such initiatives from manufacturers, our task will become a lot easier.

 Touching on the issue of pesticides in soft drinks, Nooyi said her company and Coca-Cola are trying to validate a scientific method to measure low levels of pesticides in finished soft drinks. 

 She reiterated what soft drink companies had maintained earlier: that the accepted approach for food safety around the world is to monitor pesticides in ingredients which is done routinely and that there is no scientifically validated, internationally-recognised method to measure low levels of pesticides in finished soft drinks.

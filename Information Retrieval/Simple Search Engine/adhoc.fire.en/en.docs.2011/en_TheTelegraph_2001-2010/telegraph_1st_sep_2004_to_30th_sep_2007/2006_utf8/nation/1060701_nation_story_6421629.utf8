 Calcutta, June 30: The CPM peasants wing wants the Centre to evolve a model rule to regulate contracts between farmers and agri-business companies. 

 Krishak Sabha secretary Benoy Konar said the code should be applicable across the country. 

 The CPM leader agreed there was no alternative to contract farming for the promotion of agri-business, but underlined a difference between his outfits perception and the state governments. 

 All agreements must be tripartite with the involvement of the state government, Konar said.

 The state government, though, would prefer to leave it to the farmers and the companies. Commerce and industries minister Nirupam Sen had said the state would like to intervene only in case of distress sale.

 The Krishak Sabhas stand on contract farming, a sticky issue within the CPM-led Left Front, will be fine-tuned at its two-day national executive beginning tomorrow in Delhi. 

 We want the Centre to develop a model rule for contract farming so that farmers do not enter into arbitrary and lopsided agreements. The rule would make the contract binding on both growers and buyers, Konar said. The farmers would produce according to the specifications of the companies, who will supply agricultural inputs and advance credits to them and buy back the produce at prices fixed in the contract, irrespective of the rise or fall of market rates. 

 In case of a dispute, the Krishak Sabha wants the Centre to specify that it would be settled in a court close to the area where the farmers live. 

 A division of Pepsico India had made it binding for potato growers in Hooghly district to settle all disputes in Delhi courts. 

 This provision is unjustified as poor farmers cannot afford to go to Delhi to fight a case, Konar said. A district or block development officer should be party to the tripartite agreement and act as a primary arbitration officer in case of disputes between the growers and buyers, he added. 

 Unlike contract farming, the Krishak Sabha is opposed to the sale or lease of large tracts for commercial cultivation of cash crops or, in other words, corporate farming. 

 Konar also made it clear that his outfit would not approve of any effort to amend the land and land reforms law to relax the rural land ceiling to make room for such capital-intensive farming.

 The government had tabled a bill in the Assembly last year to amend the land and land reforms law and abolish the rural land ceiling, but withdrew it following opposition from its own ranks. 

 All said and done our steps would have to match ground reality, said Konar, explaining why neither the Sabha nor the CPM would oppose the governments move to run the 26,000-acre Cinchona plantation in Darjeeling as a joint venture with a private company cultivating medicinal herbs.

 BJP trains self-rule gun on Singh

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 26: The BJP today accused Prime Minister Manmohan Singh of internationalising the issue of self-rule in Kashmir instead of highlighting cross-border terror on the eve of President George W. Bushs visit.

 The timing of the BJPs attack was set by former Prime Minister A.B. Vajpayee who called all senior leaders, including party chief Rajnath Singh, to his residence for a closed door meeting this evening.

 The meeting was called to discuss the BJP strategy against the Kashmir initiative and Indias vote against Iran at the International Atomic Energy Agency. The BJP will raise the self-rule issue in Parliament and demand a discussion on Iran.

 After the meeting, Rajnath expressed deep concern over the Prime Ministers concluding remarks at the round-table on Jammu and Kashmir yesterday. There is a need to evolve a common understanding on the issue of autonomy and self-rule for the state of Jammu and Kashmir, Singh had said.

 Rajnath said the BJP was worried that the Prime Minister instead of dismissing outright the idea of self-rule and autonomy has sought to evolve a common understanding on these issues. This unwittingly led to Kashmir unnecessarily becoming an issue of international importance, few days before the visit of President Bush which Pakistan wanted too, he said.

 Rajnath said this was a great strategic blunder. Instead of internationalising the burning issue of terror and cross-border terrorism, the government has made Kashmir an issue of critical importance. The BJP would never support any effort which seeks to weaken the complete integration of Jammu amp; Kashmir with India, he said.

 Rajnath said entertaining any idea of autonomy and self-rule would encourage secession and separation. We need not forget that Jammu and Kashmir is an integral part of India. Decentralisation of power in favour of states for faster decision and quicker delivery is completely different, which need not be confused with autonomy and self-rule. It is indeed unfortunate that an ally of Congress, PDP, has raised the issue. 

 BJP spokesman Ravi Shankar Prasad said Singh had played into Pakistans hands by not giving an adequate response to discussions on self-rule in Kashmir. This is exactly what Pakistan wants on the eve of President Bushs visit, he said.

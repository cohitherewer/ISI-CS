 Muivah: Pointing fingers

 Bangkok, Sept. 24: Even as he left for the Netherlands early yesterday, discreetly escorted by Indian embassy officials through immigration control, Naga leader Thuingaleng Muivahs heart seemed preoccupied with the events unfolding in the Naga areas. 

 The man with a nation but no state expressed apprehension about escalating violence among the Nagas alleging that the Indian government had once again started pouring arms and money to foment violence in Nagaland. 

 There has been a fresh spurt of violence of late in Nagaland with clashes between the National Socialist Council of Nagaland (Isak-Muivah) and its rivals. 

 The main issue is that disgruntled Naga elements are being used by the Indian government to undermine the peace process. Does it make sense to weaken the party with which you are negotiating peace? asked an angry Muivah. 

 The Naga leader felt that whenever a peace process gathered momentum, there are bound to be groups and individuals who would feel marginalised and differences get exacerbated. Those feeling threatened by the peace process would desperately be searching for some kind of a role for themselves, he said. But why should they be encouraged by New Delhi to act against a peaceful settlement, he wondered. 

 I say it with full seriousness and responsibility that the government of India has started pouring arms and money into Nagaland. This is happening when the Nagas are serious about seeking a peaceful solution. Does their conscience not tell them that what they are doing is wrong? he asked. 

 Muivah alleged that within this year, automatic rifles running into a couple of hundred and ammunition to go with them have suddenly been acquired by groups opposed to the NSCN (I-M) especially to the NSCN (Khaplang). He claimed that the Khaplang group moves around escorted by Assam Rifles in their vehicles.

 He also alleged that those belonging to the so-called Federal Government of Nagaland and owing allegiance to the Naga National Council that signed the Shillong Accord of 1975 have apparently started moving out of their peace camps and are on the offensive. 

 Ruling out the hand of the home ministry in this it is facilitating the peace talks Muivah claimed that this was the handiwork of some other Indian agencies. He argued this was not possible without the consent of people at the highest level in the government. 

 If this were being done to condition the peace process, Muivah said such hopes would be belied. No body should think that we can be frightened into submission, he said. 

 It is not as if the NSCN (I-M) consists of people wedded to non-violence. There is no ceasefire between the NSCN (I-M) and NSCN (K). However, the Naga leader claimed that his organisation had shown patience by deliberately not retaliating in full measure. 

 We have been in the peace process for nine years now and we do not want to spill any more Naga blood. That is why we have desisted from retaliatory action. But there is a limit to our patience. If India does not appreciate this, then it should be prepared to take responsibility for the undesirable consequences that follow. 

 Claiming that Naga peace was indivisible, the NSCN (I-M) general secretary said: There will be peace dividend for all the Nagas. That is why entire Naga society supports the peace process. So why does the Indian government want to plunge us into violence once again?

 Bareilly, Sept. 20: Sonia Gandhi today unleashed verbal volley after volley at the utter chaos and corruption in Uttar Pradesh, prodding the people to mutiny like the sepoys of 1857 for their dignity and freedom.

 In this land of sacrifice and brave fighters, something different is happening. There is politics of caste, religion and discrimination. Leaders are busy filling their pockets with illegally earned money.

 The poor and innocent are being crushed and women tortured. It is time the brave soldiers of the land fight another battle, she said at the Government Inter College grounds here.

 Attacking the Mulayam Singh Yadav government for turning Uttar Pradesh into ulta pradesh instead of uttam pradesh, the Congress chief urged the people to be- gin a movement against the corruption rampant in the state. Jeb bharo ke khilaf jail bharo andolan karo (fill up the jails in protest against the tendency to fill pockets with bribe), she said.

 Addressing her second public meeting since the launch of the Congress campaign in Kanpur on August 8 for next years elections, she asked the people to seek a full account from Mulayam on how central funds were being used.

 We are releasing thousands of crores for various projects in Uttar Pradesh. Where is the money going? The people of the state should ask the state government, she said.

 Besides, there was no power, farmers and youth were getting frustrated and factories were closing down. Yet the Mulayam regime was unconcerned. The state is literally and figuratively steeped in darkness.

 Sonia said the region had produced great patriots who fought the British, but things had changed now and communalism is being encouraged. She urged the people to display the same zest in fighting atrocities, injustice and misrule as in 1857.

 She also struck an emotional chord with the crowd saying the Nehru-Gandhi family had close ties with the region. Our first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, was incarcerated in Bareilly central jail during the freedom struggle.

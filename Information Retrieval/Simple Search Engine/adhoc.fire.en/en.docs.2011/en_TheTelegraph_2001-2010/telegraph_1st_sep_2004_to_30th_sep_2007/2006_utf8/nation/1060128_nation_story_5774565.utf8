 Sheila and Sandeep: Demolition cloud 

 New Delhi, Jan. 27: The bulldozer today moved nearer the alleged illegal constructions of chief minister Sheila Dixit and son Sandeep with Delhi municipal corporation serving them notices in compliance with a high court order.

 The corporation served demolition notices on the duo and several others, questioning why the allegedly illegal constructions should not be pulled down.

 The leaders have been asked to reply within three days. None of them was available for comment.

 Sources said a notice for sealing property was sent to Congress MLA and Delhi Jal Board vice-chairperson, Anjali Rai.

 Notices were also sent to Speaker Chaudhary Prem Singh, Delhi Congress chief Ram Babu Sharma, urban development minister A.K. Walia, education minister Arvinder Singh Lovely, industries minister Mangatram Singhal, health minister Yoganand Shastri, mayor Satbir Singh, MCDs standing committee chairman Mukesh Goyal, Congress MLAs Prahlad Singh Sahni and Mukesh Sharma and councillor Suresh Yadav..

 BJP legislator Sahib Singh Chauhan was served a notice for allegedly running a school on government land.

 Sources close to Sheila, who is away at Davos, alleged that todays removal of the city zone deputy commissioner today and reports that files of the Congress leaders property had gone missing were an attempt to destroy her image. Sheilas house in Nizamuddin East falls under the city zone.

 They also claimed corporation officials had surveyed her house earlier this week but refused to reply to her queries on what was wrong.

 Taking cognisance of reports about politicians allegedly owning illegal constructions, Delhi High Court had directed the civic body to take action against them and submit an action taken report on January 31.

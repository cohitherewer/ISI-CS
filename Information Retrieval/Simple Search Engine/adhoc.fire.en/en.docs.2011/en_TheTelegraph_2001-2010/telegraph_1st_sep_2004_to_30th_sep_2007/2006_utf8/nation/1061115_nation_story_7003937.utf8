 States gun for police law

 Up in arms 

 New Delhi, Nov. 14: A draft law that aims to free police from political control and make them answerable to the people might have to undergo several changes before it is tabled in Parliament.

 A discussion on the draft drawn up by a committee headed by Soli Sorabjee and meant to replace the Police Act of 1861 turned stormy at a meeting called by the Union home ministry today. 

 The meeting was called to get a feedback from the states on the draft law as well as a Supreme Court order on police reforms.

 Chief secretaries and directors-general of police had objections on four points setting up of an accountability commission, fixed tenure for middle- and lower-rung officers, the organisation set-up of the state police board and powers given to the selection board within the police board.

 Stressing that law and order is their prerogative, states protested against the provision of fixed terms for superintendents and station house officers. Most said the chief minister knows best where to post which official and there can be no compromise on this.

 The idea behind fixed terms was to rid the policemen of the fear of transfers if they disobey their political masters to uphold the law. In Gujarat, for instance, R.B. Sreekumar was removed as head of the state intelligence bureau after he refused to toe the Narendra Modi line on the 2002 riots.

 While the draft law, if passed by Parliament, will be a Model Police Act that the Centre cannot force on the states, most of its provisions are echoed in a Supreme Court order issued in September which all the states must obey by the year-end. 

 Senior representatives of some states said the order, which seeks a compliance report by January 3, 2007, has put them in a difficult position and they would either ask for more time through an affidavit or file a plea seeking modifications in the order.

 Objecting to the accountability commission, the states said complaints against the police can be taken to the National Human Rights Commission, the state human rights commission or grievance cells under the government. 

 Things like appointing the leader of the Opposition party to the State Police Board and a UPSC member to the selection board for directors-general are absolutely unworkable ideas, a chief secretary said. 

 This was another suggestion to curb political control of the force, by ensuring that the chief minister did not have the sole say in postings, transfers and promotions. 

 A senior home ministry official said the states, especially the NDA-ruled Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Chhattisgarh, were very vocal in their protests and suggested they would have their own law. 

 Several states, however, agreed with the draft law that investigation and law and order duty need to be separated, especially in big cities. 

 A member of the Sorabjee committee said that if such changes are made, the draft law would lose its soul and should not be tabled in Parliament. 

 A senior home ministry official said the Centre will try to apply the draft law in the Union Territories, with minimum changes. The model Act needs to be finetuned a little before being sent to Parliament. But we would not like to modify it much.

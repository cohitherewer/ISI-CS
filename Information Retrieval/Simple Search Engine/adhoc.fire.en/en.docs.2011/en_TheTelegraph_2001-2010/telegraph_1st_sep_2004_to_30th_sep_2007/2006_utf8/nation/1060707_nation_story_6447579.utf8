Nathu-la, July 6: One man stands out in Nathu-la 

today. Postman Bhim Bahadur Tamang, 48. Every Thursday and Sunday for 22 years, 

Tamang has been crossing Nathu-la by foot to deliver the post.

 But as of this afternoon, he has not been able to go through the routine, though it is a Thursday. The reason is what is happening here today is not routine. Therefore, it has upset Tamangs schedule.

 He does not know till late whether he will go across today. He is waiting for his orders even as the weather is packing up.

 I just go up there, he says, pointing at a building on a bluff across the border in China no more than 300 metres away. Sometimes it is with just one letter, sometimes two or three. I cant remember when I had a bag full of letters to deliver.

 Despite the skirmishing and tension since the border was closed in 1962, India and China have been exchanging post regularly twice a week through Nathu-la.

 Tamang has been on the job, he says, from before 1980. He lives in Sherathang, where the Sikkim government has built the trade mart for exchanges with Chinese traders. It is seven kilometres from Sherathang to Nathu-la and Tamang then just walks across.

 It takes me no more than three minutes in that office, he says. In fact, I have to leave that office in three minutes and then get back here.

 Why so few letters?

 Not many people use the postal department these days for international postage here, he says.

 Next to Tamang, an Indian wants to photograph him and wants to hang his umbrella on the barbed wire fence that demarcates the border. An Indian soldier quickly marches in and says the umbrella has to be removed.

 Why? asks the would-be photographer.

 You ask why? the soldier shoots back. The world has been holding its breath for this, India and China have been at odds over this, we are posted here for years for this and you want to hang your umbrella on it?

 Tamang hears the exchange. He has no role to play in this. Neither can he leave. He is waiting for orders to go across.

 Ajit drives a hard bargain

 Ajit, Mulayam 

 New Delhi, Sept. 17: Ajit Singh would like Mulayam Singh Yadav to pay up if the Uttar Pradesh chief minister wants the Jat leaders friendship for the upcoming Assembly polls in the state.

 Ajit, whose Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) is an alliance partner of Mulayams Samajwadi Party in the state, has identified around one-and-a-half dozen new Assembly seats for itself and started announcing candidates for them.

 All these Assembly segments fall under the Samajwadi Partys sphere of influence and some of them have sitting MLAs belonging to Mulayams party.

 According to sources, while Mulayam has been busy in the last few weeks persuading Ajit to face the polls together, the RLD leader has concentrated on identifying constituencies he would demand from the Samajwadi chief as the price for friendship.

 At the same time, Ajit has maintained a studied silence on the alliance he would finally enter into, thus keeping both the Congress and Mulayam guessing about his plans.

 The RLD chief has decided on his partys candidates for a dozen constituencies and is likely to complete the task for the remaining seats sooner than later.

 According to RLD sources, Ajit is planning a series of public meetings in these constituencies where he would make the names of candidates public and seek votes for them.

 Sources said the RLD chief would intensify simultaneous talks with the Congress and the Samajwadi Party after formally announcing the party candidates for these seats.

 Whichever party (whether the Samajwadi Party or the Congress) we align with, we will not leave any of the seats that we have decided to contest. The Samajwadi Party has been considerably weakened in several constituencies which it represents today, a close aide of Ajit said.

 The RLD chiefs move is likely to complicate emerging political equations in Uttar Pradesh. Mulayam, who has till now left no stone unturned to persuade Ajit to enter the fray together, may find it difficult to leave for the Jat leader these seats, many of which are represented by his close aides.

 The Congress, on the other hand, will get an opportunity to lure Ajit away from Mulayam by accommodating the RLD chiefs plan.

 Of the new seats chosen by Ajit for the RLD, five have sitting Samajwadi MLAs while in the others, Mulayams party lost by small margins in the last Assembly polls. 

 The seats now represented by the Samajwadi Party include Sohawal and Milkipur in Faizabad district, Mujehna in Gonda, Aliganj in Etah and Ram Nagar in Basti district.

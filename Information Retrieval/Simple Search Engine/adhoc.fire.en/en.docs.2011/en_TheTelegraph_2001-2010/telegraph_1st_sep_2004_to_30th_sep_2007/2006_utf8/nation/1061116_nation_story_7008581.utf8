 Karats IT take: no union, no strike

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 15: CPM leader Prakash Karat has said a strike in the information technology industry is a hypothetical question as there are no unions in the sector.

 The CPM general-secretarys comments came at the end of a two-day meeting of the politburo and amid a debate within the partys labour wing, Citu, whether to include the IT sector in a general strike on December 14.

 There are no unions in the sector, Karat said, reflecting the ground situation. The IT industry has no union yet; only an association the one that was launched in Bengal yesterday has been formed so far. A company-specific union is needed to serve a strike notice. 

 But a section of Citu does not agree with Karat. Within hours of Karats comment, Citu president M.K. Pandhe said in Delhi: There are many industries where there are no unions but their workers still join a general strike.

 Citu has decided to go on strike in the IT sector, Pandhe insisted, claiming that the trade union leadership, both at the Centre and in Bengal, is with him on the issue.

 But Pandhes statement is at odds with that of the Citu Bengal unit that has adopted a less belligerent position. 

 Today, Karat had come prepared with documents to the news conference. I was expecting these questions (on IT strike). So I came prepared, he said, before reading out an extract from a document adopted by the politburo at a meeting in October last year. Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had then spurred the leadership to debate the issue. 

 The politburo acknowledged the right to form unions, collective bargaining and organise strikes. But the punch line came later: all these rights follow only after a union is formed. 

 A year down the line, Karat said much the same. If workers and employees want to join a strike, they are free to do so. Those who do not want to join a strike cannot be made to do so.

 He, however, wondered whether an IT operation should be labelled an essential service just because of a 24x7 work cycle. A 24-hour service for loans cannot be part of essential service. But services for hospitals are essential, Karat said.

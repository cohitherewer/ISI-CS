 Amarinder 

 Chandigarh, July 15: Chief minister Amarinder Singh today said confidence-building measures (CBMs) between the two Punjabs would continue in spite of the cloud hanging over the Indo-Pak peace process post 7/11, reports our correspondent.

 We will go ahead with the Indo-Pak Punjab games scheduled later this year in Lahore despite the Mumbai blasts, he said while inaugurating a bar at Chandigarh Press Club. You cannot hold back confidence-building measures after every terror attack. These attacks will continue.

 But his Haryana counterpart, Bhupinder Singh Hooda, endorsed the Prime Ministers line that terrorism and CBMs cannot go together. 

 I caution the people of this country that those foreign forces which cannot digest Indias success in the field of development have been conspiring to defeat us, he said.

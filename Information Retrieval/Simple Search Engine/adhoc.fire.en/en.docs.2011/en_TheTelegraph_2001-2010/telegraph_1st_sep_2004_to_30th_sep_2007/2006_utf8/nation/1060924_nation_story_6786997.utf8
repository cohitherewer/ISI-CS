The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Prince amp; showgirl

 A bestseller. A lawsuit threat 

 sucking in Penelope Cruz. A century on, a maharajas 

 marriage to a Spanish dancer is still igniting passions 

 At 18, the maharaja has such a 

 large tummy that he needs an elephant-keepers help 

 to make love to his queen.

 By 35, the now-slim and refined 

 globe-trotter who dines with Europes royalty has plucked 

 a 17-year-old flamenco dancer off a Madrid nightclub and 

 made her his fifth and favourite wife.

 Fifteen years later, the forward-looking 

 ruler of Kapurthala is advised on his divorce by a brilliant 

 lawyer named Mohammed Ali Jinnah when he catches his Spanish 

 queen getting pregnant by one of her stepsons.

 Racy enough for Hollywood star 

 Penelope Cruz to want to bring the tale to the worlds 

 movie theatres with herself in the lead role.

 Yet, how much is truth and how 

 much embellishment?

 The tumultuous marriage of Maharaja 

 Jagatjit Singh and Anita Delgado, regular tabloid fare during 

 their lifetimes, is igniting passions a century after their 

 fairytale union, with a Spanish novelist penning their true 

 story.

 The maharajas great-grandson, 

 Shatrujit Singh, plans to sue Passion India author Javier 

 Moro for slandering the family with his pack of lies 

 and threatens to block its filming by Cruz.

 Moros defence is that he 

 sacrificed the historic(al) truth for the truth of 

 fiction to be able to better imagine what went 

 through the heads and hearts of the characters.

 Sure enough, he is ready with 

 his take on the allure the white woman holds for Indian 

 royals: So it is not surprising that all well-born 

 Indians, swayed by the teachings of the Kamasutra, have 

 dreamed at some time or other of having relations with European 

 women. Having a white woman was considered as an exterior 

 symbol of great luxury and exotic splendour.

 But he also concedes that the 

 well-travelled Jagatjit, with his cosmopolitan tastes, would 

 have found no real companionship among his virtually purdah-bound 

 Indian queens.

 For him, it was love at first 

 sight when he saw the Madrid caf owners daughter 

 tall, with clear skin and very black hair, huge 

 sleepy eyes swirl at a club.

 Persistent requests, assurances 

 and gifts break down the Delgado familys resistance 

 to the idea of giving their daughter away to a foreigner 

 with a harem. But the ecstatic maharaja is careful to get 

 Anita groomed in etiquette, fashion and stately duties in 

 Paris before she can land in Kapurthala for the wedding 

 with his child in her womb.

 Her first few years as Maharani 

 Prem Kaur her new name though the British never accepted 

 her as Kapurthalas queen are a whirl of travel, 

 parties and jewellery.

 She makes a splash in Indian high 

 society, has the Nizam of Hyderabad eating out of her hands 

 and, over the frowns of the disapproving British rulers, 

 charms the bonnets off their wives.

 Five years later, the romance 

 is dead when the princes roving eye settles on an 

 Englishmans wife. But its almost another decade 

 before the increasingly lonely Anita falls for stepson Kamal.

 The man is a volcano of 

 activity, Moro writes. Kamal is a peoples prince. 

 He goes to the villages every morning and speaks to farmers; 

 he persuades his father to create a cooperative and a system 

 of soft credits for the farmers.

 But when the affair is out, he 

 isnt man enough to run away with Anita leaving behind 

 his privileges.

 One particularly sore point with 

 Jagatjits descendants is Moros claim that the 

 maharaja forced Anita to abort her illegitimate child, at 

 a risk to her health, before divorcing her and packing her 

 off to Europe with son Ajit and a generous allowance. There 

 she lives for nearly 40 years, a picture of Kamal always 

 at her bedside, till her death in 1962.

 Jagatjit continues to visit Anita 

 during his Europe trips, although even before her departure 

 he has taken in a French mistress, Arlette Serry. Later, 

 he marries a Czech actress. She, however, decides to jump 

 off the Qutab Minar with her two poodles a few years later.

 Jagatjits descendants think 

 Moro has done a hatchet job on the maharaja, and sure enough 

 the author delights over his and other Indian princes 

 whims, weaknesses and bizarre sexual habits.

 Patialas Bhupinder Singh 

 has an insatiable sexual appetite. More than 

 a page is devoted to his surreal tantric orgies involving 

 naked virgins the high priest pouring wine over their 

 heads for Bhupinder and his guests to suck the trickle off 

 their skin.

 Yet Jagatjit is saluted as a great 

 man who turned Kapurthala into Indias most advanced 

 state, making female education compulsory, rooting out crime 

 and corruption, keeping communal peace and even giving industry 

 a leg up.

 Moros aim of portraying 

 the India of the last days of the Raj isnt 

 worth more than a few paragraphs on Nehru and Gandhi that 

 madman to Anita. There are passing references to Amrit 

 Kaur, the maharajas niece who always stands by Anita. 

 She later joins the freedom struggle and becomes a minister 

 in Independent India.

 However lofty the objective, the 

 book is finally a tale of infatuation and incest. The Jagatjit-Anita 

 alliance has obviously caught warm-blooded Spains 

 fancy there are several other Spanish books on the subject, 

 unlike India where there isnt a single one.

 Did passion die out with the princely 

 states? Maybe itll need a Penelope Cruz to arouse 

 it again.

 GAJINDER SINGH

 Nuke talks start

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 12: India and the US today began negotiations to tie the loose ends in implementing the nuclear deal just ahead of the Bush administrations move to put it through to the US Congress for approval.

 Top Indian and US officials launched a discussion on the crucial 123 agreement, a bilateral pact for civil nuclear cooperation that is facing an onslaught from the powerful non-proliferation lobby.

 The nuclear deal was clinched in March this year after Indias plan to separate civil and military nuclear facilities got the US nod. If approved, the pact will open civil nuclear technology sales to India, thus ending its status of being a pariah in the nuclear club.

 At the first session of the three-day talks today, Delhi and Washington tried to weed out differences in the draft agreements they had exchanged some time ago. India wants to ensure that it gets an uninterrupted supply of fuel for its nuclear power plants after the deal is through.

 The talks in Delhi are being held in the backdrop of reports from the US that the Bush administration was seeking to stop future nuclear tests by India. Delhi has made it clear that it will stick to its position of unilateral moratorium on nuclear testing and would not sign a separate document seeking to put a lid on future tests. The officials said such a provision ? which nullifies the deal if India tests a device ? could not be part of the bilateral agreement.

 Washington wants the ban on tests as it would placate the Congress, which has opposed the deal citing proliferation concerns. 

 The critics of the pact do not want India to be given concessions as it has not signed the non-proliferation treaty.

 The talks are being held at the joint secretary-level with the head of the America desk in the external affairs ministry, T. Jayshankar, leading the Indian side.

 Richard Stratford, director of the department of energy, is heading the US team.

 The officials said India today sought clarifications about attempts to link the bilateral agreement with the civil nuclear deal being debated in the US Congress. 

 Washington is considering two options to present the agreement to its lawmakers. 

 One of these is to get the two chambers of the Congress to pass sense-of-the-House resolutions, which are not binding, in support of the deal and wait for the negotiations between Delhi and Washington.

 After the three-day talks, India and the US will prepare for a safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency. Top officials from the IAEA will be flying to Delhi later this month to finalise the nature of safeguards for Indian nuclear facilities.

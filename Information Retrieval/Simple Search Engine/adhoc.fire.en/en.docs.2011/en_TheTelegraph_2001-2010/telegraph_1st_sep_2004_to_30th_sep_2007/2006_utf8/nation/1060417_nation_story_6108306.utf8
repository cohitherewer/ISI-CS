 On fast, Modi sniffs Delhi games

 Ahmedabad, April 16: Narendra Modi today defended his move to go on a hunger strike, described as pointless by the Gujarat Congress, by suggesting the Centre couldnt be trusted because it was playing games.

 A group of BJP and Congress MPs had earlier met the Prime Minister and claimed to have obtained an assurance that construction at the Sardar Sarovar dam wouldnt be stopped.

 The Congress promptly called off its Gujarat bandh, and its spokesman Shaktisinh Gohil said the 51-hour fast by Modi now made no sense.

 But the chief minister alleged the Centre was hand-in-glove with the Narmada Bachao Andolan (NBA) and was conspiring behind the scenes to stop work at the dam.

 Though the Prime Minister (as claimed by some MPs) has said work at the dam will not be stopped, we cannot take any chances because a PMO (Prime Ministers Office) official was singing a different tune, he said.

 The PMO official had said no decision had been taken on stopping work.

 Modi added that even after Manmohan Singhs assurance, there have been reports that he is studying the recommendation of his water resources minister, Saifuddin Soz, to halt work at the dam.

 These things indicate that the Centre is playing games?. This is a pre-planned conspiracy by the Centre to halt the construction. But the people of Gujarat will fight till the end, Modi thundered on the university grounds where he began his fast under a shamiana erected overnight to accommodate 5,000 people.

 The chief ministers sharpest words were reserved for Soz, whom he accused of having an association with the NBA.

 He said Soz had on March 11 made a public statement that the decision to increase the height of the dam is premature.

 After that statement, demonstrations suddenly sprang up in New Delhi. This shows the minister had made arrangements with the NBA, Modi alleged.

 Yesterdays meeting between four chief ministers and two Union ministers hadnt discussed whether construction would be stopped, Modi said, yet Soz, after the meeting made an announcement that as chairman of the review committee he had decided to halt construction.

 Even now, Modi said, the ground is being prepared to stall construction by providing authentic documents to the NBA on the rehabilitation issue, which it can use in the Supreme Court.

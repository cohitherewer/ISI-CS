 Jackpot jitters 

end in smiles

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Nov. 28: When 29-year-old Mohammed Javed learnt he had won the Playwin Super Lotto jackpot, he had suffered a sudden attack of nerves.

 For the first few days, the cigarette and bidi supplier had sat tight at his home in a dingy Topsia bylane, neither discussing his windfall with anyone nor contacting the company that ran the lottery.

 That was in July. Today, as the young man received a cheque for Rs 2.12 crore, he was all smiles.

 I didnt expect in my wildest dreams that I would hit the jackpot. I am extremely thrilled today. I thank Playwin for fulfilling my dreams, Javed said.

 He said he would invest a part of the money in his business and save the rest for his family.

 Javeds lucky numbers were 3, 11, 19, 42, 44 and 48, which he had bought from Super Service Agency near Kohinoor Market in Topsia Road. 

 The agency will get a commission worth one per cent of the prize.

 On May 26, Jai Prakash Jaiswal, a scrap iron trader in central Calcutta, had won the prize, bagging the countrys biggest ever jackpot of Rs 17,29,15,375.

 Playwin has generated 67 crorepatis and 2,750 lakhpatis across India in a little less than five years, said Rahul Tangri, AVP-Business Development, Pan India Network Infravest Pvt Ltd, which owns the Playwin online lottery and gaming brand.

 We are very happy for Javed and his family. We will try to introduce more interactivity, big prize money, and new games for the participants.

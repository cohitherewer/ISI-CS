 Kashmir needs to be self-reliant, says report 

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 New Delhi, Dec. 29: The Prime Ministers task force on the development of Jammu and Kashmir, headed by C. Rangarajan, has suggested redesigning the flow of central aid to the state and advised the Centre to stop filling the non-plan revenue gap which generally covers administrative expenses.

 It said the state government should have the undivided responsibility of managing this gap and central assistance should go entirely to development where the end use can be monitored and where the outcomes can be more concretely defined.

 The report of the task force, which was submitted to Manmohan Singh on December 23, said the structural deficiencies of Jammu and Kashmirs finances were most evident from its excessive dependence on central transfers. 

 Surprisingly, it pointed out that the indicators of its own revenues were comparable, if marginally lower, to those of the other states. The states ratio of tax to gross state domestic product (GSDP) was 6.7 per cent compared with the all-state average of 7.6 per cent. 

 But its ratio of revenue (tax plus non-tax) to GSDP was 10.10 per cent. This was higher than the all-state average of 9.6 per cent. The inference was that the weakness of Jammu and Kashmir state finances emanates not from lower revenues but higher expenditures.

 The irony was that the states own revenue covered only 25 per cent of its revenue expenditure. The figure was more than 50 per cent for other states.

 Under the formula devised by the Twelfth Finance Commission, the index of self-reliance in respect of Kashmir is 0.45 compared to the normalised ratio of 1 for all states. The state was able to meet revenue expenditures far in excess of its revenue receipts through generous central transfers of 78.6 per cent, which was twice that of other states. 

 The transfers were made through tax devolutions and non-plan grants according to the finance commission award, plan assistance and assistance for central sector and centrally sponsored schemes.

 The report said the average per capita transfers to Kashmir were more than one-and-a-half times the average given to northeastern states.

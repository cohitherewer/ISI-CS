 Tokyo eyes strategic ties 

 GAUTAM DATT

 Taro Aro: Small snub

 New Delhi, Jan. 2: Japanese foreign minister Taro Aso might be in the race to become the next Prime Minister of his country but when he touches down in Delhi tomorrow, he will have to be satisfied with meeting junior foreign minister E. Ahmed.

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh politely turned down the request for an audience as he will spend the next two days in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.

 Aso is coming with a proposal to start a new strategic partnership with India. Much significance is attached to the proposal as Tokyo has such an arrangement with only two countries in the world, the US and Australia.

 Diplomatic sources said that the strategic dialogue is proposed to be held at the foreign minister level. 

 Tokyo has decided to enter into such a relationship despite the fact that it has reservations on Indias nuclear programme. In a bid to narrow the differences, Japan will propose talks on disarmament and non-proliferation, though Tokyo is sceptical whether Delhi would agree to the plan.

 Japan wants to enhance interaction with India to bring the engagement on a par with China. Diplomatic sources said that Japan has political problems with China but economically, Tokyos relationship with Beijing is 30 times bigger than its ties with Delhi. 

 An indicator is the fact that 80,000 people ferry between New Delhi and Tokyo but the volume of traffic is 25 lakh between Beijing and Tokyo. 

 Aso will hold a dialogue with the Indian side on Wednesday before leaving for Pakistan. Apart from making the proposals, he will review the progress on issues finalised during Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumis visit to Delhi last summer. He will also set the stage for Singhs visit to Tokyo later this year. 

 Diplomatic sources pointed out that Aso, who became foreign minister in October last year, wanted India to be his first destination. But as the arrangements were still being finalised, he had to go to the US before coming to India. 

 The diplomatic engagements between India and Japan follow an unusual pattern. According to norms, visits take place on a reciprocal basis. But it will be the third visit by a Japanese foreign minister without any from this side.

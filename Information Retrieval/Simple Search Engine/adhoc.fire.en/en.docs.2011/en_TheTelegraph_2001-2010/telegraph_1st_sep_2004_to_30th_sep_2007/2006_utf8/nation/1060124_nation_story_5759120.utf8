 VIP notices on Salt Lake

 OUR BUREAU AND AGENCIES

 Jan. 23: The Supreme Court has issued notices to the Bengal government, the chief minister, Jyoti Basu and his son on a public interest litigation that alleged irregularities in Salt Lake plot allotments since 1977.

 A bench headed by Justice Ruma Pal issued the notices to Basu and his son Chandan on the allegation that in 1977-78, the chief ministers discretionary quota was created by unlawful and confidential executive orders without informing the cabinet.

 The petition, filed by NGO activist Joydeep Mukherjee, names urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya and finance minister Asim Dasgupta as other respondents.

 The notice has been sent to the chief minister because Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee held the urban development portfolio from 1987 to 1992 when Basu was chief minister.

 State CPM secretary Anil Biswas said the government would comply with the directive of the Supreme Court. I have not yet gone through the apex courts directive. But the government will comply with it, he said. 

 The petitioner has contended that in 1985, the state government started carving out new residential plots from land earmarked for civic amenities and ecological balance in violation of the approved master plan.

 He said the allocation of plots was unconstitutional as well as arbitrary since 1977 and influential people from all walks of life benefited.

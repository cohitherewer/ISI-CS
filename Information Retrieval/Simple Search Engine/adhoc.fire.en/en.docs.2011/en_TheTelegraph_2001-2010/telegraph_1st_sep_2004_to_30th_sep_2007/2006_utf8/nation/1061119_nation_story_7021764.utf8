 Panaji, Nov. 18 (PTI): The Boney M band will perform in Goa after 21 years at a beach concert to be held on November 30 for the International Film Festival of India (IFFI) 2006.

 Certainly, the concert will be a crowd puller.... People love Boney M and their compositions, said Fransisco Martins, an event management official, who had organised Boney Ms first concert in Goa in 1985.

 Their 1985 show drew a huge crowd.... The tickets were priced at Rs 100, Rs 200 and Rs 300, and over 16,000 people witnessed the performance, Martins recalled.

 For IFFI, its a free show and the current generation who have heard about this iconic band would love to see them, Laury Pires, a local band leader, said.

 Boney M, a dance, pop and disco group, were popular in the 1970s.

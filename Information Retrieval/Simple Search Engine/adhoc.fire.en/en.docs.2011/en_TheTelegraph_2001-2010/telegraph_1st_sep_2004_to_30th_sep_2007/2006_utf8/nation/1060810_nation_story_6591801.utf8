The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Govt plays for nuclear tranquillity

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 New Delhi, Aug. 9: Prime 

 Minister Manmohan Singh is not likely to refer to the US 

 nuclear deal in his Independence Day address from Red Fort 

 on August 15.

 Neither is the Centre keen to have a discussion on the subject, despite pressure from the Left and the NDA, government sources said. 

 The pact has become a sore point in the tenuous Congress-Left equations. More so, after Prakash Karat and Sitaram Yechury of the CPMinsisted on bringing a parliamentary resolution along with the BJP-led NDA. The document will mirror the collective sense of the House.

 Besides, Natwar Singh, the former foreign minister who has been suspended from the Congress, is trying to use the US deal as a stick to beat the Prime Minister with. 

 The Congress feels that a full-fledged discussion may end up in a free-for-all and, perhaps, bolster the Left-NDA demand for a resolution that could tie the governments hands.

 A Rajya Sabha panel had decided to have a short-duration discussion on the nuclear deal under Rule 176 but no date was fixed. The rule does not allow a motion. 

 Going by the current timetable, financial business will keep the House busy during the remaining three days of the week. After next weeks holidays, only seven working days are left before the session ends on August 25. 

 The government has set aside two days for disruptions and adjournments and wants to use the remaining five to discuss farmers issues, floods and the amendments to the right to information bill. 

 Citing the packed schedule, the sources said it would be hard to squeeze in long discussion and a motion.

 If a debate is unavoidable, Bengal CPM leaders Jyoti Basu and Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee have assured the Prime Minister that no harm would come to his government, the sources said. 

 The CPI had also sent positive signals to Manmohan, though some of itsmembers have taken a strident stand in public.

 The sources said Yechury himself wanted to make it known to the Prime Minister that he was not part of the nuclear club of Natwar, Yashwant Sinha, Digvijay Singh and Amar Singh. But his explanation apparently cut no ice with Singh.

 If Natwar speaks in Parliament on the nuclear deal, the Congress is expected to remind him that as foreign minister in 2005, it was he who broke a deadlock after a closed-door meeting with US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice.

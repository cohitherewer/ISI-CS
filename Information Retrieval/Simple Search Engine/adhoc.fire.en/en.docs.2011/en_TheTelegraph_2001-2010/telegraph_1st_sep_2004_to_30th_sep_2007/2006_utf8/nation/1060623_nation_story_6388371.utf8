 Profit notice to Chauhan

 Bhopal, June 22: The office-of-profit row is threatening to wipe out the entire top layer of the ruling BJP in Madhya Pradesh, including chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan, reports our special correspondent.

 The state election commission, acting on a petition filed by leader of Opposition Jamuna Devi, slapped notices on Chauhan and nine of his ministers asking them why they should not be disqualified from the Assembly for holding dual posts as MLAs and heads of state-run corporations.

 The group of 10 ? Chauhan, Babulal Gaur, Himmat Kothari, Gopal Bhargawa, Jagdish Devda, Rustam Singh, Chandrabhan Singh, Vijay Shah, Tukkajirao Pawar and Ramakant Tiwari ? has been asked to respond by June 28 or face disqualification. 

 The poll panels move has sent the BJP into a tizzy. Senior party leader Sushma Swaraj, who was in Bhopal, sought general amnesty.

 Swaraj said the BJP has all along agreed with the Election Commission on the need for uniformity in defining office of profit in states and at the Centre. Till the issue is thrashed out, the panel should consider granting amnesty to all MPs and MLAs facing proceedings relating to office of profit, she added.

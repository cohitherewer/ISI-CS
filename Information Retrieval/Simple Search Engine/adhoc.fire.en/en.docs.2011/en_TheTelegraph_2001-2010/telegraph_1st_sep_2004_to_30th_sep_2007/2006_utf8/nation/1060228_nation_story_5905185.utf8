 Clinton visit charm absent

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Laura Bush: Will she shop?

 New Delhi, Feb. 27: The warmth and enthusiasm with which they had waited to hawk their wares to former US President Bill Clinton and wife Hillary is missing.

 The Kashmiri Muslim traders in the Maurya Sheraton shopping arcade are a disgruntled lot. For one, they are sick of the tight security arrangements that are in place. For another, they dont know if they will be allowed to keep their shops open.

 There is a tight atmosphere this time. The charm of the Clinton visit is missing. No one is ready for the visit at this shopping arcade. We dont even know if the arcade will be open, a shop-owner says.

 An employee working in one the shops went so far as to say that he did not want to greet Bush. I will not go out to see him. But if he comes into our shop, I will show him our products, he says.

 But there are some who are still reliving memories of how Hillary had shopped from 10 in the night to the wee hours and hoping First Lady Laura Bush would do the same.

 Saboor Wangnoo, who owns a carpet shop and is the official supplier of carpets to the king of Thailand, is the one with the happy memories. But he is clear that he will be preparing for the US delegation, not the US President.

 We have exclusive carpets from Kashmir like the Jewel of Kashmir, Shahbaz ? all which are made by weavers in Srinagar and on its outskirts, he says.

 A jewellery shop owner, Shehzad Zaveri, is the most enthusiastic of the lot. If allowed, he will keep his shop open till midnight, he says.

 He is now stocking up on white gold jewellery studded with precious and semi-precious stones. We hope to make a killing this time. We have an interesting collection. It is not completely ethnic, it has an international flavour, he says. 

 He also has a gift for the President. It is a surprise and we hope he accepts it.

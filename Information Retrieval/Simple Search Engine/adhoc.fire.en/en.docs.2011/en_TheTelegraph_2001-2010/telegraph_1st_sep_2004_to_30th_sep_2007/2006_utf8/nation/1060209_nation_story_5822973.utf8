 Dos and donts of phone-tapping

 MANAN KUMAR

 New Delhi, Feb. 8: The Centre today set the rules for phone-tapping and email interception, addressing the need to stop illegal snooping without tying the security agencies hands.

 The guidelines are meant for providers of all telecom services ? unified access, cell phone, STD, ISD and Internet ? including Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited and Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Limited.

 From now on, service providers must be on round-the-clock alert for any request for interception from police and intelligence agencies, and must issue acknowledgement letters within two hours of receipt.

 The police, intelligence agencies and service providers must each appoint nodal officers for sending and receiving the requests.

 Every 15 days, the designated nodal officers of all three parties must sit together to cross-check and confirm every requisition made during the fortnight.

 This is expected to prevent repeats of the Amar Singh phone-tapping drama involving forged signatures.

 If an emergency request for tapping arrives without approval of the competent authority, the service provider must still act on it. But the approval must be secured within three days, from the head of the agency or his number two who cannot be below the rank of inspector-general of police.

 To prevent the details of interceptions being misused by, for instance, lower-level personnel, recordings (called call data record or CDR) will not be provided unless there is a criminal case against the person being investigated.

 To make the system foolproof, the service providers will have to send the names of their nodal officers (and those who might stand in for them, if the need arose) to all security agencies along with their addresses and phone numbers.

 The information must be updated every three months and any change communicated immediately. The police and intelligence agencies will do the same.

 If a states police want to tap the mobile phone of a subscriber who lives outside the state and doesnt have roaming facility, permission will be needed from the Union home secretary or the states home secretary. Only officers of the rank of superintendent of police or above can attest that a signature is that of the states home secretary.

 The guidelines make the service providers responsible for the actions of their staff and asks them to ensure that requests for interceptions are handled only by senior officials, preferably of the rank of general manager or above.

 The companies must also be thorough in verifying customers identity to guard against possible misuse of their services by terrorists.

 The guidelines have been vetted by the Union home and law ministries, telecom department and the internal security agencies.

 They have been sent to the secretary of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India, secretary-general of the Association for Unified Access Service Licensees, director-general of the Cellular Operators Association of India and the deputy directors-general of the telecom department so that they can issue the necessary instructions to individual service providers.

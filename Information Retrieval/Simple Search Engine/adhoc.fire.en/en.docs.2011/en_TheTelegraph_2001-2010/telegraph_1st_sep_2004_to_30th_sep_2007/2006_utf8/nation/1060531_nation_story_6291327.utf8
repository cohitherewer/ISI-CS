 10 held in Pak pilgrim attack

 IMTIAZ GUL

 Islamabad, May 30: At least 10 people have been arrested for their alleged links with three unidentified gunmen who attacked a convoy of visiting Hindu pilgrims from India last Sunday in the southern province of Sindh. 

 The late night ambush left two Pakistani Hindus dead and seven, including an Indian, injured near Hayat Pipafi village in Ghotki district. The Indian, identified as Jagdesh, is said to be out of danger. 

 All the injured were admitted to hospitals in Sukkur and Ghotki. 

 On Sunday, the convoy was returning from the Hindu shrine of Shadani Darbar, 50 km north of Ghotki, when it was attacked. It is a conspiracy against Hindu pilgrims, especially those from India, and an attempt to stop them from visiting their holy shrines in Pakistan, said Utistar Lal, the leader of the Indian delegation.

 Police have begun raiding several villages around Ghotki district to arrest the three attackers and their supporters.

 Shams Bhutto, a resident of Ghotki, said at least seven persons were arrested this morning from villages in the district as a follow-up to the three arrests made last night.

 According to police officials, the 10 arrested have direct links with the attackers and they were being interrogated to track down the gunmen.

 The Indian pilgrims are likely to leave Sukkur for Lahore in the next couple of days for their return to India.

 Sundays incident was the first of its kind. No delegation of Hindu or Sikh pilgrims has come under attack anywhere in Pakistan earlier.

 Ramesh Lal, a National Assembly member who represents around 100,000 Hindus in Ghotki, said the attack was an open act of terrorism.

 Mulayam tugs at Amar ties

 - CM falls back on socialist roots

 Mulayam (top) and Amar: Growing distance 

 New Delhi, April 17: Mulayam Singh Yadav is trying to don the socialist mask and distance himself from Samajwadi Party general secretary Amar Singh, according to party sources.

 The Uttar Pradesh chief minister, wise after many controversies mostly generated by Amar, now seems to be falling back on his old socialist friends who had been pushed to the margins after Amars rise in the party.

 The ruling Samajwadi Partys general secretary has been in the news in recent months thanks to the phone-tapping controversy and a CD sting operation. 

 Amars former party colleague Raj Babbar has even alleged that the CDs were Amars own doing and called him a fixer. He was expelled from the party eventually, but the party suffered because of the mud-slinging in public, sources said.

 According to the party sources, these controversies, sometimes involving the Samajwadi Party chief himself, have sent out a message that the party is out of sync with its ideology. 

 The chief ministers move, though, is not because of a surge in his love for ideology. It has more to do with the realisation that seeking refuge in socialist moorings may help him keep at bay the controversies generated by Amar, who has of late become a liability.

 But his general secretary is not Mulayams only worry. Rival Bahujan Samaj Partys growing control over the minorities and Other Backward Classes, too, is a cause of concern for the chief minister. 

 Sources said the Samajwadi chiefs subtle shift in stance is aimed at revitalising the party to gain a grip over the OBCs and minorities before Uttar Pradesh goes to Assembly elections next year. 

 In his desperation to repackage himself, Mulayam recently struck down Amars suggestion to field an industrialist for the Rajya Sabha seat vacated by Reliance honcho Anil Ambani, the sources said. Instead, the chief minister heeded the advice of his socialist friends to send either an OBC or a Muslim face to the Rajya Sabha, they added.

 According to the sources, Mulayam takes extra care these days to be seen more with the likes of socialists in the party like Janeshwar Mishra and Beni Prasad Verma.

 For the past few years, while Mulayam increasingly came under Amars influence, the partys socialist ideals were relegated to the background and most old socialists were pushed into obscurity. 

 The reversal in the trend, though happening under the compulsion of the impending Assembly elections, is bound to get stronger in the days to come, bringing Mishra, Verma and other old socialists to the front row of the Samajwadi leadership, a senior party leader said.

 The sources said Mulayams frequent meetings with George Fernandes, the former Janata Dal (United) president, and former Prime Ministers Chandrashekhar and V.P. Singh are also part of his attempt to assuage the sentiments of the original constituency of the socialists.

 Sangh pours cold water on BJPs firewood

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 11: As the BJP gears to hit Delhis streets tomorrow against the fuel price hike, with Atal Bihari Vajpayee leading from the front, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh has said the protest lacks intellectual honesty.

 The Sangh has expressed support for the Centres request ? rejected by the BJP ? that the states slash sales tax on petroleum products to bring down prices.

 An editorial in the June 18 issue of the Sangh mouthpiece, Organiser, urges the BJP to make a beginning instead of protesting on the streets by stopping the wheels and (inflicting) a misery.

 The party can walk the talk by asking its state governments to reduce state levies on fuel. Political parties cannot have it both ways. That is why, we say, these protests lack intellectual honesty.

 BJP spokesman Prakash Javadekar said: We dont subscribe to the RSSs views (on the price hikes).

 The Organiser, of course, hasnt spared the Congress or the CPM. Though it asks the BJP to follow Congress-ruled states example (as suggested by petroleum minister Murli Deora), it says Deoras proposal is dishonest and smacks of moral double standards.

 Deora says that states like Maharashtra are levying sales tax of 33 per cent on petrol and 38 per cent on diesel. And so is the case with West Bengal and Kerala. Further, he adds that a major portion of the tax earning on fuel goes to states, the periodical says.

 Still the (central) government is refusing to absorb the burden on the common man by reducing customs and excise duties on petroleum products. Can there be a more outrageous instance of dishonesty and moral double standards?

 The editorial says the CPM is protesting as if the BJP is in power at the Centre and Sonia Gandhi, too, as though Atal Bihari Vajpayee is still running the country.

 BJP president Rajnath Singh said there was no way that BJP-ruled states would lower sales tax on petrol and diesel. We are demanding a full rollback because what the UPA government has done is unprecedented. In two years, there has been a 45 per cent increase in petrol and a 39 per cent increase in diesel prices, he said.

 A reduction of 20 or 22 paise means nothing?. The Centre should reduce the excise and customs levies on the states instead of the other way around.

 BJP sources said the partys protests have two objectives: turning media and public attention away from the Rahul Mahajan scandal and reclaiming the Opposition space.

 Many in the party feel that the Left has grabbed this space while continuing to support the ruling coalition, and that the BJP should do more to expose the Lefts duplicity.

 Vajpayee, despite his indifferent health, was asked to lead the protests in the sweltering heat to lend the show a higher profile. Janata Dal (United) leader George Fernandes, too, is expected to show up.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Now, a movie vending machine

 S. RAMACHANDRAN

 Oct. 5: Thinking of watching a movie but all the DVD shops and libraries are clo-sed? Help is at hand, or will be soon.

 In about a year, you will be able to buy or rent a film VCD or DVD at any time of the day or night.

 Easy Entertainment Pvt Ltd has launched Indias first movie vending machine, appropriately named Any Time Movie, which was unveiled yesterday at Inox in Mumbai.

 We are teeing off with two vending machines one at Inox in Nariman Point and the other at Jolly Makers Towers in Cuffe Parade, says Easy Entertainment managing director Raaj Vakil. 

 We are looking at eight more machines in Mumbai, and before the end of 2007, we hope to install over 100 vending machines all over India. Each machine will be of a different capacity and will be stocking VCDs and DVDs from 1,000 to 2,500 titles. The machine is fully automated like an ATM and can cater to customers round the clock.

 The machine not only sells or rents out films, but also music videos, games and the like. It also offers facilities such as online booking.

 The cost of a membership card for Any Time Movie starts at Rs 500, Vakil says. Consumers can buy or rent films by using their credit cards.

 Anyone can become a member. We are distribu-ting entry forms near the location of the machine. It can also be downloaded from our website and we will get back to people within a reasonable time.

 Vakil adds that people can also become members just by paying a security deposit.

 The company has already acquired 2,500 titles and is looking at more.

 We have tied up with Shemaroo, T-Series, Saregama (which officially distribute movies for several Hollywood studios), Sony Pictures Entertainment (which distributes Columbia Tristar Movies), Yashraj Films and Excel Home Video (which also distribute Hollywood productions). Talks are on with other companies and we hope to build a large bank soon, says Vakil. 

 He emphasises that the machine will not affect video libraries. 

 In fact, it will be beneficial for them. They, too, can use these vending machines after working hours and on holidays. Leading video libraries are tying up with us.

 The machine has Bollywood actress Tara Sharma as its brand ambassador.

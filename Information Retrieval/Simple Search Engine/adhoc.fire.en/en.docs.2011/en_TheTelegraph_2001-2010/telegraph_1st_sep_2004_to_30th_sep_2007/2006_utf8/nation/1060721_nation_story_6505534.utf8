 Digital music to artiste ears

 SUDESHNA BANERJEE

 Calcutta, July 20: The century-old His Masters Voice is singing a transparency tune that should be music to the ears of artistes in its repertoire and create a precedent in the countrys music industry. 

 We have started digitising all our contracts and contents, said Subroto Chattopadhyay, president amp; CEO, and managing director of RPG Enterprises entertainment sector, in Calcutta. This would allow the company to clear accounts on a monthly basis.

 We have partnered in producing 300,000 titles in 23 languages in every genre. In fact, we can be called the custodians of Indian music. It was becoming impossible to monitor it all manually.

 The push towards digitisation was also necessitated by the increased avenues of business. More people are now consuming music, be it on the cell, on the radio, in public performances or on the Net.

 For the past four months, all transactions are being electronically fingerprinted, minimising chances of mismanagement. Once the data is fed into the system, it is being monetised, proceeds are collected and the source of income is determined. Once we know who the artiste is, we pay out as we collect the proceeds. Thus royalty gets paid every month, Chattopadhyay said.

 The Saregama digital database now has about 50,000 contracts and 23,000 artistes.

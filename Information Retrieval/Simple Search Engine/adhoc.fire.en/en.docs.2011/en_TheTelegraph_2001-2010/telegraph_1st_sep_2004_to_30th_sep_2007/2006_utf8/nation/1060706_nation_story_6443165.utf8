 Govt firm on Singur takeover

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Calcutta, July 5: The industries minister today dismissed the Opposition demand to shift Tata Motors proposed small-car project from Singur and said the government was determined to go ahead with the land acquisition. 

 The identification of over 1,000 acres for the Tata Motors project will be completed in a few days and the government hopes to finish the process of land acquisition before the scheduled deadline of six months if the farmers sell their land voluntarily, Nirupam Sen said in the Assembly today. 

 Replying to questions from Trinamul Congress members, the minister said only a fourth of the land earmarked for the unit was fit for comprehen- sive (multi-crop) cultivation. The rest is mainly low-lying and mono-crop. 

 The government has tried to avoid fertile land as much as possible while selecting the site, he said. 

 Sen (picture above) also pointed out that a portion of the land at Singur, close to Durgapur Expressway, has already been sold. 

 At Singur in Hooghly district, 40 km from Calcutta, the local Trinamul MLA had yesterday said that the party would launch a movement in support of the farmers if a majority of them opposed the land acquisition.

 Sen insisted that the Tata factory and its downstream units would generate much more income and jobs for local people than their land.

 Asked if the company had sought more land than was required, he said: Neither have we the expertise nor can we decide how much land is needed for a factory to roll out two-and-a-half lakh cars a year. There also has to be provision for the units expansion to produce five lakh cars a year in the future. I dont think they have asked for too much.

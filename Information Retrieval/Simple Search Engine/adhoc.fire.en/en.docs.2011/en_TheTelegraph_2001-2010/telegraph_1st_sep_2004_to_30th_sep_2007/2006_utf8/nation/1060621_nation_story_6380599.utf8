 Chennai, June 20: The Prime Minister has promised to send the national security adviser to Chennai to discuss with the Tamil Nadu government the crisis in Sri Lanka.

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh also assured the state government that the Centre will make the efforts needed to bring about a congenial atmosphere for ensuring peace in Sri Lanka, chief minister M. Karunanidhi said here today.

 The chief minister phoned the Prime Minister after political parties in the state passed two resolutions asking the Centre to play a pro-active role to help restore peace on the island, where the Tamil Tigers and the government have renewed hostilities.

 National security adviser M.K. Narayanan, who is well-versed with the Sri Lankan situation, is expected to be in Chennai before the end of the week.

 The ruling DMK and its allies, including the Congress, had urged the Centre yesterday in a cautiously-worded resolution to take necessary steps to bring about peace in Sri Lanka.

 The issue is extremely sensitive for both the DMK and the Congress. The I.K. Gujral government was toppled by the Congress after a panel that probed the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi by Tamil Tigers made some adverse references to the DMK, a partner of the then United Front government.

 The resolutions were drafted carefully, trying to harmonise the views of different partners in the DMK-led alliance, including some of the pro-LTTE parties like the Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK) and the Dravidar Kazhagam (DK).

 A Congress leader said the party had put forward its position in a forthright manner as we in particular have been a victim in the past (of the LTTEs attack.) Karunanidhi fully appreciated our position and some modifications were made in the resolutions, he said. The resolutions have not singled out either the Lankan government or the LTTE, but said ceasefire violations on both sides have killed innocent civilians.

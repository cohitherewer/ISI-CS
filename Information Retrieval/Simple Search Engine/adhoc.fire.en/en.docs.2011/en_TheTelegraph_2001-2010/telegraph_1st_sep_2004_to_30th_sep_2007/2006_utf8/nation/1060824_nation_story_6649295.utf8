 Foreign minister target set

 - PM keen on handover 

before UN session

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 Manmohan Singh

 New Delhi, Aug. 23: If the government sticks to Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs timetable, the country should have a full-fledged foreign minister by the end of this month.

 Speculation of a new face in the foreign ministers seat gained ground after a purported piece of conversation between the Prime Minister and a confidant on August 21 did the rounds.

 Asked who will represent India in the UN General Assembly session in New York (slated to be held around September 20), Singh was quoted by a source as saying: But of course, a new foreign minister.

 The Prime Minister will not attend the UN session because he will be away in Brazil and Cuba from September 11 to 18 for the India-Brazil-South Africa and Non-Aligned Movement summits.

 Once he returns, a conference of Congress chief ministers to be hosted in Dehradun or Nainital is on the cards. The tentative dates are September 22 and 23.

 Before leaving for Latin America, the Prime Minister will travel to Orissa to monitor the implementation of social sector programmes.

 Sources said if a new foreign minister the post was taken over by the Prime Minister after K. Natwar Singhs exit had to be appointed, it would have to be soon after the monsoon session of Parliament ends on August 25. 

 The government can afford to wait only till the first week of September. The new minister needs time to familiarise himself with the ministry before representing India in the UN General Assembly, said a source.

 The names being spoken of were those of P. Chidambaram and Pranab Mukherjee.

 Chidambarams name was floated by a section of the Congress, which, while acknowledging his efficiency as finance minister, felt that the might of the liberalisation trio could be diluted a bit if he moves to the foreign ministry.

 Singh, Chidambaram and Montek Singh Ahluwalia, the deputy chairman of the Planning Commission, are seen as strong advocates of reforms. 

 However, those who claimed to know the Prime Minister well insisted that he would not let go of Chidambaram from the finance ministry.

 There was a proposal to bring Maharashtra governor and former Karnataka chief minister S.M. Krishna to the Centre.

 But a section of the Congress felt that Krishnas presence at the Centre may spell trouble for the party in Karnataka because of allegations of interference in state politics.

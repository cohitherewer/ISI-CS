 New Delhi, Oct. 24: The BJP may have moved on after Pramod Mahajans murder but his family seems keen to make fresh inroads into the party.

 Sources said Mahajans wife Rekha is eager to get a Rajya Sabha nomination while the children Rahul and Poonam are trying their best to find space in the party.

 Rahul is keen to bag a nomination from the Mumbai Northeast parliamentary constituency, a seat his father won in 1996. Kirit Somaiya contested and lost from the constituency to Congresss Gurudas Kamat in 2004.

 Rahul has been putting in appearances at various party functions. He barged in while the BJP Yuva Morcha was in the midst of its campaign last week to press for Parliament attack convict Mohammad Afzals execution to be carried out. I feel that I should be part of this campaign. I saw the news coverage of the Parliament attack. My father, too, was in Parliament at the time, he said.

 BJP leaders are not impressed. There is no question of him being given any responsibility till he is cleared of the charges in the dope case, a senior leader said.

 Poonam wants to contest the next Assembly elections from the Matunga constituency in central Mumbai. She has already started making the right noises. I and the BJP were born in the same year, in 1980. I feel I have an umbilical relationship with the party and its ideology, she told The Telegraph from Aurangabad.

 Poonam said she was doing social work in the Marathwada region, which includes funding the education of poor children. My father had helped set up a college in Osmanabad. I am engaged in similar activities in the Marathwada region. I feel there is no distinction between social and political activities, just as my father said samaj karan aur raj karan main koi antar nahin (there is no difference between social and political work), she said.

 Poonam admits no one from the BJP encouraged her at least officially in spite of her interest in social work and politics. I am doing all this on my own. As far as joining the BJP is concerned, I have told you that I consider the BJP as my home, as the party I was born into.

 While the BJP is not dismissive of Poonams not-very-subtle efforts, sources said the trend shows that the party is in no mood to oblige paratroopers.

 If anyone thought the BJP would have its own Rahul and Varun (Rahul Mahajan and Varun Gandhi), Varuns experience should be a lesson. If Poonam wants to be a leader, she has to work her way up, just like her father did, said a senior leader.

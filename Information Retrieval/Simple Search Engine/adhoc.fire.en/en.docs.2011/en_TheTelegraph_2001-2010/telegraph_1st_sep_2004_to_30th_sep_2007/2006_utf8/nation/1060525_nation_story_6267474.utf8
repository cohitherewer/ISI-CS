 IIM students back medics, plan action

 A STAFF REPORTER

 May 24: Students of the Indian Institutes of Management today said they support the medicos striking against the Other Backward Classes quota, but it would be at least a week before they can announce how they plan to show solidarity.

 Most IIM students are now doing their internships; once they are back on campus the student bodies will chalk out their plan of action.

 The students are expected to return to their respective campuses around the first week of June. Once the majority of the student body is back, we will sit down, discuss the issue in detail and plan our next move, said Srihari Bharatthi, the president of the students affairs council at the B-school in Bangalore .

 At a news conference on the Bangalore campus, students representatives from all the six IIMs issued a joint statement condemning the 27 per cent OBC quota imposed yesterday on central government-run institutions of higher education. 

 These include the IIMs, the seven Indian Institutes of Technology and medical colleges like the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi.

 The only reason all six of us are meeting is the reservation issue. We want to tell the people our stance on the subject, Bharatthi said. 

 We are completely against reservation at the graduate and postgraduate levels ? and simply increasing the number of seats is not the answer, Bharatthi added.

 The joint statement said reservation could be offered only at the primary level.

 The students clarified that these views belonged solely to the student bodies and not the IIM administration or faculty.

 We havent spoken or discussed this with the IIM faculty or administration so far, said Mohammed Akil Memon, who was representing the Calcutta campus.

 The students said they were in touch with several of the striking student bodies in Delhi as well as IIT students.

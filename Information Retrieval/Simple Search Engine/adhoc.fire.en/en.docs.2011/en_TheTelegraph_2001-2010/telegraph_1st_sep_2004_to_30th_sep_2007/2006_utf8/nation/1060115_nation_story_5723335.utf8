 Uma party to wait, first a yatra

 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY

 Ayodhya, Jan. 14: Taking a holy dip on Makar Sankranti in the Sarayu, Uma Bharti said she has been rid of the vices of a decadent BJP but refrained from launching a new party as planned.

 Instead, she called herself the real BJP in the ideological sense and announced that she would go on another padyatra next month.

 It is after I am through with this padyatra, which is expected to continue for three months, that I will announce my future political plan at Chitrakoot on the border of Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh sometime in May, said the expelled BJP leader whose Ram Roti yatra has just concluded.

 Uma said she was going on another padyatra as she wants to know if people will respond to her five-point agenda ? swabhiman (self-respect), suraksha (security), swadeshi (promotion of indigenous products), suchita (purity) and suraj (good governance).

 Unsure of the response to her proposed outfit, the firebrand leader appeared to be buying time with the three-month postponement to judge the reaction of those leaders who have supported her so far.

 On her arrival in Ayodhya yesterday, at the end of a 600-km march through Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh, Uma said her vow was not to harm the BJP but scare away the unwanted seasonal birds that have descended on the temple of the party by hurling stones at them. I am neither going to weaken the BJP nor destroy it, she said.

 Family faces eviction

 The late Pramod Mahajans official residence in Delhi

 New Delhi, June 6 (PTI): Arrested on charges of drug abuse and illegal use of government accommodation, Rahul Mahajan faces eviction from the 7 Safdarjung Road residence allotted to his father, the late Pramod Mahajan.

 Rajya Sabha house committee chairman J.P. Agarwal today said his panel was thinking of cancelling the three-month extension granted to the Mahajan family to live in the house following the death of the BJP parliamentarian last month.

 The house was allotted to Pramod Mahajan for political purposes. We granted a three-month extension to the family of the late leader to use the house on their request, Agarwal said. 

 But the events that unfolded in the past few days show the house was being used for suspected illegal activities.

 Agarwals comments came in the wake of 31-year-old Rahul being charged with allowing the house to be used for consumption of banned narcotics.

 He said the committee would soon approach Rajya Sabha chairman Bhairon Singh Shekhawat with its recommendations over misuse of the residence.

 The committee, he said, had so far allowed the Mahajans to stay in the house at a concessional rent for a month since the passing away of the Rajya Sabha member and asked them to pay rent at market rates for another two months.

 But now the situation has changed. There are serious allegations regarding the use of the house, which have prompted us to recommend that it be vacated, Agarwal said.

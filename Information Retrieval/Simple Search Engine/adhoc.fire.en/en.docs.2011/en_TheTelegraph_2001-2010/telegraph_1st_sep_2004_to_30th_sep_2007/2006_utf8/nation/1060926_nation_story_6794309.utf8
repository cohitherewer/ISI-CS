 New Delhi, Sept. 25: The BJP today contradicted Pervez Musharrafs claim that Kargil was a tactical triumph for Pakistan.

 Speaking at a public function to launch the partys weeklong programme to sing Vande Mataram across the country, BJP chief Rajnath Singh said Kargil was a diplomatic victory for India.

 We never violated the LoC, we exposed Pakistans designs to the rest of the world under the able leadership of Atal Bihari Vajpayee. It was a diplomatic victory for India, he said.

 Pakistan is our neighbour. We have always wanted good relations with them. But it was Vajpayeeji who forced them to accept that peace talks cannot be initiated till Pakistan admits and corrects its mistake of building a terror infrastructure, he added.

 Rajnath said the composite dialogue with Pakistan started only after the then BJP-led government signed an agreement to this effect on January 6, 2004. And now the UPA government wants to neutralise the years of hard work to make Pakistan agree to not let its territory be used for promoting terrorism.

 Rajnath mentioned the non-paper, the unofficial proposals Delhi allegedly handed to Islamabad offering to scale down its control over Jammu and Kashmir, and demanded that it be made public.

 Contents of the non-paper have been reported widely in the Pakistani media. The BJP is particularly disturbed by the alleged mention in the paper of restoring Kashmir to its pre-1953 status that basically means handing over all subjects barring defence, foreign affairs and communications to the Jammu and Kashmir government.

 We wish to know what the non-paper contains. What has changed so drastically in recent months that India has decided to not make cross-border terrorism a pre-requisite for peace talks? Rajnath asked.

 The BJP held a number of meetings throughout the day to launch the countrywide programme to sing the national song. All important leaders, including L.K. Advani, fanned out to various states to attend these programmes.

 While attacking Musharraf, Rajnath said after Partition, it was only the goodwill of Hindus that allowed Muslims to live with dignity in India and indirectly warned them against resisting the singing of Vande Mataram.

 Muslims lived with dignity in India after Partition mainly because of the large-heartedness of the Hindus. But those who do not respect Vande Mataram have no right to live here, he said.

 Flying coffin crashes again

 New Delhi: 

 A MiG 21 fighter of the Indian Air Force crashed near Jamnagar 

 in Gujarat on Tuesday even as the defence establishment 

 has been tomtomming that the plane is as safe as they come 

 and only last week made a big issue of a film that purportedly 

 depicts the mainstay of the fighter aircraft fleet in poor 

 light, reports our special correspondent.

 Pilot J.P.S. Bains ejected after flying the aircraft, which was on a practice sortie, beyond the limits of the Jamnagar airbase, a major forward base. 

 It is almost as if MiG 21s crash with unfailing regularity every time the IAF seeks to advertise its abilities and gives it certificates of battle-worthiness in public. 

 Only on Monday, the chief of air staff, Air Chief Marshal S.P. Tyagi, who was in Gujarat, had said the MiG 21 was one of the safest aircraft and it was unfair to describe it as a flying coffin. He said there were more crashes of the MiG 21 than any other aircraft because they made up the largest number of aircraft in the force. 

 India eyes mission to Mars

 bangalore 

 (PTI): After the mission to the moon, scheduled for 2008, 

 India wants to reach out to Mars and New Delhi is keen on 

 jumping onto a possible global bandwagon for this planetary 

 exploration. 

 Isro chairman G. Madhavan Nair said the US and Europe appear to favour a global partnership and India is more than willing to be a partner in this exercise.

 For mankind, the next interesting thing (after the moon) is Mars. Already there are indications that it is more inhabitable... and so on, Nair said. 

 Isro signed a deal with the European Space Agency for the Rs 380-crore unmanned lunar expedition, Chandrayaan-I, last year and is also in talks with Nasa. 

 Haj toll rises

 dubai (PTI): 

 The number of Indians killed in Thursdays stampede 

 in Mena has risen to 58 with six more succumbing to injuries.

 While four of them, including one couple, were from Gujarat, the rest belonged to Uttar Pradesh. Five Indian couples died in the tragedy, which claimed 367 people.

 Marriage norm

 New Delhi 

 (PTI): The National Commission for Women has told the Supreme 

 Court that a uniform law on registration of marriages would 

 weed out the loopholes in existing legislations and be of 

 critical importance to women-related issues.

 Jawans arrested

 lucknow 

 (PTI): Eight jawan recruits have been arrested in connection 

 with the clash between them and doctors on the Nauchandi 

 Express on Sunday. Medical services remained paralysed in 

 Uttar Pradesh as doctors continued their strike protesting 

 the incident. 

 Delhi 

 will host an Afro-Asian literary conference in February 

 where several writers from both the continents will take 

 part. It will focus on the literary links between Asia and 

 Africa.

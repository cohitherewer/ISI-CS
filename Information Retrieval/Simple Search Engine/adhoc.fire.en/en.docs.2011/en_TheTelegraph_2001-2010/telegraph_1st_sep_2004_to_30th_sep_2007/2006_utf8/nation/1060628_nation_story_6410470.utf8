The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Land-share policy till 2025

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta, June 27: With demand for space and pressure to convert farmland mounting, the Bengal government will embark on an exercise to find out how much land should be appropriated for industry and urbanisation while keeping the agricultural base intact.

 Industries minister Nirupam Sen, land and land reforms minister Abdur Rezzak Mollah and panchayat and rural development minister Surjya Kanta Mishra will discuss tomorrow the need for a comprehensive land policy with a perspective plan till 2025. 

 The meeting will also consider relaxing the rural land ceiling to facilitate large-scale cultivation of cash crops and medicinal plants as proposed by agro-business companies. 

 The perspective plan is the brainchild of Mollahs department, flooded with acquisition proposals from the industries and urban development departments of late.

 We cant keep expanding industry in rural areas and urbanise them when land is lying vacant in urban areas. We now have 16 decimals (24 cottahs) for every person in Bengal. To keep our food security intact, well need to maintain 12 decimals per person, a land and land reforms department official said.

 According to observers, Bengal has not yet attained actual food security. It produces 11 per cent surplus rice and 40 per cent surplus vegetables, but it is also 50 per cent deficient in wheat, 75 per cent short in pulses and has to buy 60 per cent of the oil seeds from other states. 

 A senior government official, however, said food security cannot always be a deciding factor. Many developed countries dont produce enough food but have a robust economy, given their industrial advancement. 

 When Bengals industrial scene is looking up, he added, land has to be sacrificed for the sake of industrialisation and to create new jobs.

 The three key ministers in the Bengal cabinet will also deliberate on whether a committee chaired by the chief minister should be set up to assess how much land needs to be allocated to various sectors ? industry, urban development, agriculture, municipal affairs, PWD, panchayats, fisheries and forest. 

 According to government estimates, around 50 per cent of the states population will move to urban centres by 2025. 

 We need to plan for the changes that will take place over the next two decades. We propose to identify and designate land as urban centres in six districts ? Hooghly, Howrah, North and South 24-Parganas and East and West Midnapore ? where most of the new industrial units will come up, the official said.

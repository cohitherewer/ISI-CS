 South eats into Cong RS count

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 9: The loss of Karnataka will hurt the Congresss chances of retaining its current strength in the Rajya Sabha after the biennial elections in April.

 Of the 36 members who will retire, 21 are from the Congress and its allies. There are four vacancies in Karnataka, and had the Congress held on to its alliance with the Janata Dal (Secular), it would have asked for three of them. But now the party can hope to win only one.

 The Congress is set to lose seats in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Orissa, too, but will try to make up in Andhra Pradesh, Haryana and Himachal Pradesh. As things stand, it can win 16 seats on its own steam and another two with the help of allies.

 Although the Rajya Sabha deputy chairperson, K. Rahman Khan, is expected to be renominated, some in the party are against it. They argue that since he has already done four terms, another person should be sent and Khan made a governor. The nominations to the vacant posts of governors are not likely to be announced until this matter is settled.

 But some sources said Khan should be allowed to stay on. They cited the enormous trouble and suspense the party had to go through to work out a consensus on him as House deputy chairperson after the UPA came to power.

 The BJP had nearly persuaded the Samajwadi Party to put up Jaya Bachchan against Khan and force a contest. It isnt worth its while to go through the exercise again for a new deputy chairperson, especially when relations with the Samajwadi Party have hit rock bottom, the sources said.

 Prominent among those whose terms end in the next two months are Union ministers Arjun Singh and H.R. Bhardwaj. The Congress can be confident of only one seat in Madhya Pradesh, which had returned both the ministers in 2000.

 Sources said Arjun was most likely to get that seat while Bhardwaj would have to turn to Haryana, which has one vacancy. The party has enough and more votes in Haryana.

 The party will bag five of the six vacancies in Andhra Pradesh, but must share an equal number in Maharashtra with the Nationalist Congress Party. Civil aviation minister Praful Patel will be retiring but his renomination is a foregone conclusion. The Congress will get the new power minister, Sushil Kumar Shinde, nominated from the state.

 Its Andhra unit has told the high command that most nominees should be from the state and not outsiders. 

 Rajiv Shukla, who won from Uttar Pradesh last time as a candidate of the now defunct Loktantrik Congress Party with BJP and Samajwadi support, is looking at the lone Uttaranchal seat. 

 Sanjay Nirupam, who joined the Congress from the Shiv Sena, is another hopeful from Maharashtra.

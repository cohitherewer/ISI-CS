 Chemical shield hope for colas

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Sept. 1: A technology developed by a defence laboratory to protect soldiers from chemical warfare agents might also find application in the removal of pesticides from water or cold drinks, defence scientists have said.

 The activated carbon spheroids made from a coal tar by-product called pitch is a strategic material designed to adsorb toxic chemicals and gases. But it could also be used in the purification of air or water, according to the scientists.

 The adsorbent material is among six technologies developed by the Centre for Fire Explosives and Environment Safety (CFEES) in New Delhi that have been transferred to industries for production for domestic and export markets.

 Activated carbon spheroids have a high surface area and can adsorb organic substances, including pesticides, more efficiently than filters used in industrial processes, said Pramod Rai, a CFEES scientist. Its primary use is in the production of protective equipment face masks, hoods or full-body apparel against chemical warfare agents.

 A Bhopal-based company, HEG, has acquired the technology for activated carbon spheroids. The material has not yet been evaluated for purification of pesticides, but it is a potential application, said Vijai Tripathi, research advisor with HEG. The cost of this material may be higher than conventional industrial purification technologies, but one of the goals is to reduce its cost, Tripathi said.

 An intelligent fire sensor, new classes of fire extinguishers and processes to eliminate toxic industrial effluents are the other technologies that the industries have picked up from the CFEES. Our expectation from industries is that they will scale up technologies for manufacture and make products available at reasonable costs, said M. Natarajan, scientific advisor to the defence minister.

 The Defence Research and Development Organisation has transferred some 80 technologies to industries over the past four years. Products in the market include ready-to-eat meals, mosquito repellent creams, diagnostic kits and water canons.

 The biggest hurdle in the market is the first break, said Soundappan Santhakumar, general manager with Southern Electronics in Bangalore that has decided to manufacture the intelligent fire sensors. Clients ask us references and want to know where weve installed it already, Santhakumar said.

 Centre damper on Hu House address

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 27: The government has decided against granting the Left its wish to hear Chinese President Hu Jintao address a joint sitting of Parliament.

 Although parliamentary affairs 

 minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi said today that the government 

 has requested President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam to bring forward 

 the winter session a move that coincides with the Chinese 

 Presidents visit he categorically added that Jintao 

 was unlikely to address the two Houses of Parliament. 

 Das Munshi emerged from a meeting of the cabinet committee on parliamentary affairs this afternoon to announce that the winter session would be advanced from November 27 to November 22. The session will end on December 19. 

 To a comment that the rescheduling of the Parliament session had a Chinese connection, he said: There is no connection, no link with the visit of the Chinese leader. 

 He attributed the advancement of dates to Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs preoccupations and engagements of several ministers and the Christmas holidays that follow the end of the session. 

 Another reason, said Das Munshi, was to facilitate early tabling of reports by several parliamentary standing committees so that some important bills could be introduced in the first week of December.

 Reports of Jintao addressing a joint sitting had started circulating after Das Munshi met CPI leader A.B. Bardhan earlier this week. But none of the senior ministers was in favour of inviting any controversy that would have invariably followed the joint session.

 The Left had prevailed on the Centre on not inviting US President George W. Bush to address a joint sitting in March. 

 To have Jintao do the same so soon after Bushs visit would have definitely invited criticism, particularly from the BJP. The Opposition has consistently maintained that the UPAs foreign policy is being dictated by the Left.

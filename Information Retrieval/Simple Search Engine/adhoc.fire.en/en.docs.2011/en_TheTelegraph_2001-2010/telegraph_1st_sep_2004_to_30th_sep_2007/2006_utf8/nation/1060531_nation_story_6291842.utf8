 a dilemma 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New 

 Delhi, May 30: Doctors on strike, flummoxed by 

 a Supreme Court order asking them to call off their agitation, 

 are struggling to walk a tightrope ? keep the protest alive 

 and honour the court.

 Medical students and faculty across colleges in New Delhi were huddled in meetings and in consultation with senior lawyers, trying to fathom the implications of todays court order.

 Representatives of resident doctors associations declined to say anything because the meetings were under way. 

 However, many doctors said a large section of them wanted to continue with the agitation. Senior faculty members who have been supporting the movement also declined to comment.

 No one wants to dishonour the Supreme Court. Yet, we all believe we have genuine demands and this agitation is legitimate, said a senior doctor at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences.

 Health minister Anbumani Ramadoss said the government plans to bring in army and railway doctors to restore normalcy in hospitals where health services have been crippled since the strike began 18 days ago.

 Ramadoss also said a decision has been taken to start hiring doctors from tomorrow to replace the medicos on strike.

 The doctors argue that their agitation has been spontaneous and without any leaders.

 Since we dont have a leader, who will the Supreme Court take action against? They should issue us individual notices if any action is to be taken against us, one of the resident doctors said.

 We have been faced with so many challenges before, we can handle this one, too, said Anirudh Lochan, responding to the health ministers statement on replacing the doctors on strike.

 The mood among many of us is to continue with the strike, but we really dont know what will emerge after weve consulted with our legal experts, Subrata Mandal, a resident doctor said.

 Katara case date for Bharti

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 6: Bharti Yadav, the elusive witness in the Nitish Katara murder case, has finally agreed to depose on November 25 before a trial court.

 Bharti, former MP D.P. Yadavs daughter, was initially slated to appear as a prosecution witness in 2003. But she did not appear in court despite several summons and warrants.

 Today, her counsel Subhash Bhuttan also submitted an undertaking by Bhartis uncle Bharat Singh, who would ensure her presence for recording her statement.

 Bhartis brother Vikas and cousin Vishal are the main accused in the murder.

 Her family initially denied knowledge of her whereabouts but after the court granted her a last opportunity and threatened to declare her a proclaimed offender, her uncle filed the undertaking. The government had already revoked her passport.

 Bharti had sought to depose through video conferencing from the UK, but the trial court and the high court rejected her plea. When she went to the Supreme Court, it refused to interfere. With no legal options left, Bharti decided to testify in court.

 On February 16, 2002, Bharti was present at the party in Ghaziabad from where Nitish was allegedly taken away by her brothers.

 In her statement to police, Bharti had stated that her brothers were present at the marriage party where she too was there with Nitish. Her brothers did not like her dancing or taking a photograph with him, she said.

 But her statement to the police does not conclusively prove that Nitish was taken away by Vikas and Vishal. She had said she had come to know that Nitish had been taken away by them and, thus, this was hearsay, which is not directly admissible as evidence.

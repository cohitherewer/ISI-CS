 Bangalore bomb a dud

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Kumaraswamy

Bangalore, Aug. 23: The political time bomb ticking on H.D. Kumaraswamy failed to explode as the man who claimed he had documentary evidence that the chief minister collected Rs 150 crore from mine owners in Bellary ended up washing the Gowda family linen in public.

 Suspended BJP MLC Janardhan Reddy did not have much to say, or show. In a two-and-a-half-hour news conference in Bellary that television channels beamed live, Reddy only presented conversations of mine owners shot with a camera phone and some audiotapes where unknown people made vague allegations.

 Reddy, however, said it was only part one of his disclosure and he would reveal more in Bangalore next week. He talked about Kumaraswamy and his familys businesses, including iron-ore exports, and called for a CBI inquiry.

 But the incident did have its share of drama as the political temperature in the Karnataka capital soared and members of both the JDS and the BJP partners in the ruling coalition stayed glued to TV sets.

 Before the conference began and during it, political pandits had a field day. Some predicted the collapse of the even-month government. 

 There were even suggestions that JD(S) patron and former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda was thinking of annointing his second son H.D. Revanna, also a minister, as chief minister. Gowda dismissed Reddys allegations as baseless, a PTI report said.

 Reddy has been alleging that Kumaraswamy, home minister M.P. Prakash and mines minister Chennigappa were taking bribes from Bellary miners. 

 A mine owner himself, Reddy subsequently denied that he had made any specific allegations. But after his outburst in the legislative council, where he repeated his original charges, the BJP suspended him.

 The action gave Reddy more ammunition to collect evidence, which he promised to present before the media today. But it turned out to be a damp squib.

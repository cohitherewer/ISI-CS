 Admission liberty with leash for IITs, IIMs

 New Delhi, Aug. 1 (PTI): The committee looking into the implementation of OBC quotas in centres of higher education has recommended that the criteria for admission to IITs and IIMs should be determined by these institutions alone to maintain their excellence.

 The committee recognises that those institutions of higher learning which have established global reputation (like IITs, IIMs, IISc and AIIMS) can only be maintained if the highest quality in both faculty and students is ensured, the oversight committee said in an interim report.

 The panel headed by former Karnataka chief minister Veerappa Moily hoped these institutions would keep in mind the principle of expansion, inclusion and excellence, the moving spirit behind the new reservation policy, while determining the threshold marks for admitting other backward class students.

 Care should also be taken to expand capacities in the subjects or areas with better employment opportunities, the panel said.

 The issue of the creamy layer, however, has been kept aside for the final report, which will be presented by August 31.

 The committee said plan and budgetary allocations for higher education have to be increased to ensure that the decision on reservations does not turn into a one-time affair.

 Sanjus clubbing, 4 days to D-Day

 ANANYA SENGUPTA

 Dutt: Living it up

 Mumbai, Sept. 8: Judgment day is just four days away, but Sanjay Dutt does not seem a worried man.

 Late last night, the Bollywood hunk, an accused in the 1993 Bombay blasts case, let his hair down in a suburban nightclub in Bandra.

 Bombay High Court is expected to pass its judgment on the blasts case on September 12. It was to be pronounced on August 10, but was postponed.

 Dutt has been charged with possessing an AK-56 rifle and later destroying it with help from friends.

 He confessed, then retracted his statements and witnesses in his case turned hostile.

 Dutt, who had isolated himself from the outside world since the date of the hearing was announced, drove into the Bandra club in his swank Mercedes well past midnight.

 He was dressed in a casual blue kurta and jeans. I love you all, he announced as he strolled in with two buddies and headed straight to the bar to order a bottle of Bacardi white rum for himself.

 Not only did the Munnabhai star enjoy being thronged by his fans, Dutt also went up to the DJs console and dedicated a song for them Metallicas Nothing Else Matters.

 As the crowd around him swelled, Dutts spirits soared. He sang another Metallica number Comfortably Numb before going on to render the title song of Zinda, in which he had starred.

 But the best moment came when Dutt dedicated Summer of 69 to all his fans. The crowd went into a frenzy.

 The star humoured his fans, hugging them and letting them click him on their mobiles. He joked and laughed with some youngsters and sang along.

 There was, however, one sour moment in the night out when around closing time, Dutt lost his cool and got involved in a scuffle with one of his friends. Although they quickly made up, Dutt was heard saying: I am sorry f the press!

 Dutts nightclub appearance is a definite change from his stance just a month ago when he made a trip to Shirdi before August 10, the earlier date for the verdict. Again in the last week of August, the actor went to Vaishno Devi.

 Dutt also skipped a press meet to launch his sister, MP Priya Dutts website.

 He kept away from the public eye during the promotion of his latest flick, Lage Raho Munnabhai. 

 On July 27, Dutt did not attend the music launch of his film Anthony Kaun Hai.

 The actor was so anxious about the verdict that he even cancelled his lavish birthday celebrations on July 29.

 Varsity bid shifts from Bengal to Orissa 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, April 18: Industrialist Anil Agarwal today touched down in Orissa to seek land for a $1-billion university touted as Indias version of Harvard, Stanford and Oxford.

 Agarwal, chairman of the London-based Vedanta Resources Plc, met chief minister Naveen Patnaik and his team of officials at the state secretariat this morning and made a presentation on the proposed university.

 Before coming to Orissa, Agarwal had sought land in some other Indian states, including Bengal. But the Left Front government, caught in poll preparations, could not take up the proposal.

 Representatives of AT Kearney, management consultants for the campus, accompanied the Vedanta chairman who spoke to the Orissa chief minister for over an hour. Agarwal, who expressed confidence that the university would stand Orissa in good stead, has sought 5,000 acres near a large waterbody.

 Patnaik is learnt to have shown interest in the proposal and has asked chief secretary Subas Pani to do a survey on the likely project sites.

 We want to set up a university that will be of the calibre of leading institutes such as Harvard, Stanford and Oxford, Agarwal said. The project could be located near Chilika Lake.

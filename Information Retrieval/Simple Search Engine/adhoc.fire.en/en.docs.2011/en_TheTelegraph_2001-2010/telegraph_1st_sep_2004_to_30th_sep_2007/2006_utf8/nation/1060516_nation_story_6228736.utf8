 Museum security notice to Centre

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, May 15: The Supreme Court has directed the Centre to respond within four weeks to a plea seeking time-bound implementation of recommendations to enhance security of museums.

 A bench headed by Justice Ruma Pal passed the directive after it was informed about the poor condition of museums in the country. It was hearing a PIL seeking special protection for historical assets after the theft of Rabindranath Tagores Nobel medal in March 2004. 

 Petitioner Subhash Datta said the 2005 report of the comptroller and auditor general had pointed out various shortcomings in the security arrangement for the Indian Museum, Victoria Memorial Hall and the Asiatic Society in Calcutta.

 The report said poor and inadequate security and lack of training exposed museum artefacts to high risk of damage and loss. Such lapses had resulted in the theft of a fifth-century Buddha head from the Indian Museum in December 2004, it said.

 The CAG report also blamed lack of synergy among Calcutta museums for inefficient and sub-optimal utilisation of resources. Further, there was no mechanism to assess the genuineness of the artefacts, it said.

 Datta has suggested special training for those guarding museums, involvement of outside agencies for verification of assets and shifting administrative wings outside the display areas for ensuring safety of valuables.

 Justice Pal asked the Centre to respond to Dattas suggestions within four weeks.

 The Centre has said it was not feasible to form a special force to guard museums.

 On steps taken at the Indian Museum in Calcutta, the Centre said it had introduced an in-service training for security staff, shifted offices outside gallery spaces, installed new CCTVs and conducted re-verification of antecedents of employees.

 At the Victoria Memorial, it said, physical verification of artefacts was being done on a periodic basis and antecedents of employees were being verified. The Centre further said CCTVs had also been installed at the Hazarduari Museum, Cooch Behar Palace Museum and the Tamluk Museum.

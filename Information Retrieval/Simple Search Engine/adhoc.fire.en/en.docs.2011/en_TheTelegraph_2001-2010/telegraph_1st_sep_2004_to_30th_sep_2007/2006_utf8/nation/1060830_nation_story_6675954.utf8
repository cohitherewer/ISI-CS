 Too little space for tigers in reserves

 New Delhi, Aug. 29 (PTI): The Centres ambitious Project Tiger has come under sharp criticism from the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG), which found that many tiger reserves do not even adhere to the norms for a core area or the protected zone of a sanctuary.

 While the norms lay down an average area of 1,500 sq km with at least 300 sq km as the core area, the CAG report for 2005 found that 15 of the 28 such reserves spanned less than 720 sq km.

 Six of these reserves had a core area that fell short of the requirement. The report noted that such discrepancies existed despite the knowledge that tigers breed rapidly in protected areas.

 The CAG found human settlements in core areas in half of the reserves. As a result, there has been an increase of just 20 tigers in 18 years in 15 tiger reserves created till 1984.

 The Project Tiger directorate admitted that human settlements disturb tigers but said the areas were brought under the project considering the threat to the animal.

 The CAG pulled up the directorate and state governments concerned for the delay in notifying tiger reserves as national parks.

 In many tiger reserves, the final declaration procedures of national part (core) and sanctuary (buffer) were pending as of March 2006 even though the amended Wildlife (Protection) Act, 2003 set the time limit for completion of acquisition proceedings, it said.

 The final notification declaring the area as a national park was not issued in Indravati, Kanha, Pench, Palamau, Bandhavgarh, Panna, Simlipal and Kakkad Mundanthurai till March this year despite their status as tiger reserves since 1973-75, the report added.

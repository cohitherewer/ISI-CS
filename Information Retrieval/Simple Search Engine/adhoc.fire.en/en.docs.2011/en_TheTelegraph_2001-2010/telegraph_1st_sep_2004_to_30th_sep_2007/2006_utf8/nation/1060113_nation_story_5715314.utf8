 Court nod to bar girls

 New Delhi, Jan. 12 (PTI): Women can serve liquor at pubs and bars in the capital, Delhi High Court ruled today.

 A division bench of Justices Mukul Mudgal and H.R. Malhotra said there can be no restriction on women working at establishments serving liquor and other intoxicating substances.

 They declared as unconstitutional and inoperative Section 30 of the Punjab Excise Act, 1914, which imposed restrictions on women serving liquor in licensed places.

 The bench, however, said though the order permits employment of women for the purpose of serving liquor, they cannot be compelled to do so against their consent.

 The order came on a petition by the Hotel Association of India and four others, including two women employees of the hospitality industry, challenging the restrictions.

 Senior counsel Arun Jaitley and Ravi Sikri, who appeared for the petitioners, said the provision violated Articles 14 (right to equality), 15 (right against discrimination on the basis of sex) and 19(1)(g) of the Constitution which gave every individual the right to choose his/her profession.

 The judges said the provision was outdated and far from protecting the women, it has, in fact, the effect of inhibiting and curbing the employment opportunities of modern Indian women.

 Tata cancer hospital

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Feb. 14: Ratan Tata will lay the foundation stone for the proposed cancer hospital at Rajarhat next Tuesday in the presence of chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. 

 The super-speciality hospital with 150 beds will be the first such project of the Tata group outside its home terrain Mumbai where it set up the Tata Memorial Cancer Research Institute.

 The hospital will come up on 10 acres, entailing an investment of Rs 92 crore, in one and a half years. The Tatas have sought another 15 acres for additional infrastructure in the second phase.

 At any time, 2.5 million people in the country suffer from different forms of cancer. Thousands of patients from Bengal head to Mumbai and to hospitals in the south for treatment. 

 The cancer hospital is a token of our belonging to the city. We are planning to make more investments in the state, Tata has said.

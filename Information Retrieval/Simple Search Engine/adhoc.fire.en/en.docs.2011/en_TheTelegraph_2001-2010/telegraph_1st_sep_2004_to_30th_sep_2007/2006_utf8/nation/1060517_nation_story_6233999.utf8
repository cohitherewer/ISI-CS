 Jail term for Zahira mother

 Mumbai, May 16 (PTI): A sessions court today awarded three months rigorous imprisonment to Seherunnisa Sheikh, mother of Best Bakery case prime witness Zahira Sheikh, for giving false evidence at the retrial.

 Additional sessions judge Abhay Thipsay also imposed a fine of Rs 500 on her.

 However, on her lawyers petition, the judge suspended the sentence for one month to enable her file an appeal in Bombay High Court.

It is very obvious that she had been tutored 

by somebody (before she deposed at the retrial), Thipsay observed. The 

sentence of three months, in fact, seems too less considering the offence, but 

that is the maximum punishment for a summary trial. Otherwise, this offence deserved 

two-three years sentence.

 Bulldozers raze car showroom

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, March 6: The unbelievable happened here today as bulldozers of the Patna Regional Development Authority (PRDA) razed the states only General Motors showroom run by the scion of a powerful political family of Bihar. 

 Pandey Motors, a swanky glass-exterior showroom near the Dak Bungalow crossing in the heart of the city, had come up recently in alleged violation of the PRDAs building norms and even its construction plan had not been approved.

 The PRDA had served a notice on the proprietor after lodging an FIR. On behalf of the showrooms owner, Amar Pandey, an appeal had been filed with the PRDA, but it was rejected. A 72-hour notice to dismantle the structure was issued to the landlord, which expired on Saturday.

 Amar is the son of Raghunath Pandey, a late Congress leader from Muzaffarpur in north Bihar, who had branched out into several businesses, including transport.

 The ownership of the prime land on which the showroom was built had also come under dispute as it originally belonged to the late Hasan Imam, a barrister who was elected Congress president in 1918. A local firm, Ganpati Property Developers, claimed ownership of the land.

 There was no response to the 72-hour ultimatum issued by us to dismantle the structure, PRDA engineer Satyendra Singh, who was supervising the operation, said.

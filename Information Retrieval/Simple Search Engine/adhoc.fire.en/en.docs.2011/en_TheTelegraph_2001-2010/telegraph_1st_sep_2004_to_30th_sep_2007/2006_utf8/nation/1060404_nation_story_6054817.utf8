 Pranab makes first move

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 3: The leader of the Lok Sabha and defence minister Pranab Mukherjee today sent letters to leaders of all political parties on the office-of-profit bill.

 Informing them that Parliament will sit from May 10 to 23 , Mukherjee, it is understood, solicited their views on whether they wanted amendments to the current law ? the Parliament (Prevention of Disqualification) Act of 1959 ? or a comprehen- sive new legislation which would plug the loopholes, whether the proposed amendments should have retros- pective effect and whet- her they should be discussed and passed in the coming session.

 Government sources said if the consensus view favoured a new law, it would have to go to a parliamentary standing committee which would vet the bill and suggest the amendments. Because of the delay this procedure entailed, sources said their belief was the parties would opt for amendments which can be passed expeditiously without a discussion.

 In a meeting with parliamentary affairs minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi after the ordinance fiasco, the BJPs chief whip in the Rajya Sabha, S.S. Ahluwalia, had reportedly stressed that the changes should be passed without a debate.

 It is expected that the replies to Mukherjees letter will come by the end of this week after which the government will take a view on the bill. 

 With the Rae Bareli Lok Sabha bypoll on May 8 and the Congresss belief that its president, Sonia Gandhi, would return with a record margin, sources said she would also be present in the ensuing Parliament session. Earlier, it was thought that the byelection would take place in June and Sonia would mark her attendance in the monsoon session.

 But the question on top of every Congress members mind is would the bill include the National Advisory Council, which was chaired by Sonia, in the list of offices of profit? Only Sonia and the Prime Minster have the answer, said a functionary.

 Vote hope for Gulf Indians

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Hyderabad, Jan. 7: Delhi plans to allow Indians working in West Asia to vote in elections back home as they have a vital stake in the governance of the country, the Prime Minister said today.

 Addressing overseas Indians at the Pravasi Bharatiya Divas 2006, Manmohan Singh said these expatriates, living mostly in the Gulf, were unique.

 They are NRIs who will never become naturalised citizens of those countries. Most have immediate families back in India and have thus a vital stake in local governance, including the issue of who would represent them in the state Assembly or the national parliament.

 Singh said their long-pending demand for voting in Indian elections while working in West Asia was justified and assured them he would push the move through. This proposal is at an advanced stage of consideration by our government.

 Of the 50 lakh Indian workers and professionals overseas, more than 30 lakh are in West Asia. These expatriates ploughed back $20 billion into India in 2005 against $13 billion in 2001, and Delhi is keen to tap their growing financial clout and professional talent to boost Indias economy.

 Singh said the expatriates had enhanced Indias reputation as a global knowledge economy .

 The Prime Ministers comments came less than a fortnight after his government offered overseas citizenship to millions of people of Indian origin, giving them opportunities to own land and property and invest in financial markets in India.

 The overseas citizenship of India scheme, however, does not include voting rights or the opportunity to stand in elections. Altogether, there are more than 2 crore Indian nationals or people of Indian origin in foreign countries.

 Singh presented overseas Indian citizenship certificates to several delegates to the three-day event that kicked off this morning amid chaos. The ministry of overseas Indian affairs had debited the credit cards of hundreds of delegates for their fees but failed to register them.

 Some delegates took up the matter with the departments minister, Oscar Fernandes, who looked embarrassed. The inauguration and Singhs speech were delayed by over 40 minutes to allow all the delegates to get registered.

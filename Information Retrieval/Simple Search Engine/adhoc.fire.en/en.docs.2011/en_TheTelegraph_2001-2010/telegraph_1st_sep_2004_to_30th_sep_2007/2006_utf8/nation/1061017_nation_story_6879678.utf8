The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Admirals last hurrah with sea route for future

 SUJAN DUTTA

 Admiral Arun Prakash: Goodbye gift

 New Delhi, Oct 16: In the choppy seas of his office, Admiral Arun Prakash, the chief of naval staff, is tiring steadily at the end of a torrid tenure. But the admiral today set the stage for his last hurrah in office, putting into cold print a set of doctrines to road-map a future for the navy.

 The naval aviator, hounded by allegations of corruption in the middle of his tenure and now on the fringe of the row over Barak missiles, has dared to venture into territory in a way none of his predecessors did.

 Last week, shortly after an interview to The Telegraph, the admiral with a feel for the English language was asked when he was going to pen his memoirs. No, no I have no intention of doing it for now, he shrugged. He is preparing to settle down in the foothills of the Himalayas, in Dehradun, far from the seas as if he were sick of the waters. I believe old soldiers should fade away, Prakash said.

 But today, the admiral told his senior officers that he wants the Indian Navy to be sea-faring in a way it can only imagine. The beginnings have been made with Operation Sukoon the naval evacuation of Indians out of Lebanon even as Israel bombed Beirut in July this year. That, he has explained, is an illustration of what strategic reach and continuous long-range patrolling can do for Indians.

 Prakashs road map of the navy comes at a time when the government is yet to evolve a consensus on jointness. In his interview to The Telegraph, the navy chief, who is also the chairman, Chiefs of Staff Committee, said that despite homilies, the creation of a chief of defence staff post was somewhere on the horizon but not on the radar. The post is at the apex of the integrated defence mechanism that a committee to review the military after the 1999 Kargil war recommended.

 In coming out with his road map today, the admiral is asking the navy to forge ahead irrespective of whether the other two forces are ready for its adventurous spirit. The navy is the most mobile, the most dynamic of the forces, Prakash said. We like to ideate because of our experience.

 In these days of murky deals, it is difficult to find positives in chiefs of the navy. What if there is another allegation of a scandal against Prakash on the morrow, just as there has now been against Admiral Sushil Kumar? 

 The question surely haunts Prakash more than others. The outspoken officer proved much more reticent after the naval war-room leak case emerged last year and the CBI opened investigations against a relative of his suspected to have raked in slush funds out of the Scorpene submarine deal.

 Less well-known is the story of Prakashs private outburst in the captains quarters on board the aircraft carrier, INS Viraat, off Mumbai. The agonising chief could barely conceal his hurt from a member of his extended family. He is easily one of the best we have seen, says retired Rear Admiral Harinder Singh. Unfortunately, his tenure has been a little clouded.

 The clouds cast their shadow over a senior officers conference. The conference is devoting a major section on safety. Not surprising because the navy has probably suffered its biggest peace-time loss in his tenure the sinking of the missile corvette, INS Prahaar, off Goa after it collided with the cargo carrier, MV Rajiv Gandhi, on an April evening.

 Yet, Prakash is preparing to leave the navy with a future. At the officers conference that began today, he surprised by coming out with a set of documents setting out his ideas. 

 In addition to the doctrines released earlier, he has come out with a text titled Freedom of the Seas: Indias maritime strategy. The wholly classified document details his vision of just how the navy should evolve. After laying down the theories of expansion, Prakash has gone on to compile how the ideas can be translated. 

 In an overarching document entitled Vision Statement for the Navy, a second study called What does transformation mean for the Indian Navy and a third called Strategic Guidance for Transformation, he looks at mechanisms for implementation.

 The last study called Five-year road map for foreign cooperation examines how indigenous capabilities can be harnessed for out of area operations. He told the senior officers that the recent creation of the post of a flag officer doctrine and concepts (a rear admiral) establishes the diplomacy role that the navy has to increasingly play.

 After allegations of corruption and a ship that has sunk, Admiral Prakash, who bids goodbye to his office on October 31, is ensuring that the navy has other things to remember him by.

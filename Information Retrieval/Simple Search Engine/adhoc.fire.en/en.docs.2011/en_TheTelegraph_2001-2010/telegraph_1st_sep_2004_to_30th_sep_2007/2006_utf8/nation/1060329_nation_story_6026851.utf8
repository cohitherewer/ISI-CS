 Meet Spotty, the deer

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Hyderabad, March 28: If Spotty was blessed with powers of speech, she could well have said Oh deer!

 She didnt ? conversation isnt one of her strong points ? but the fortnight-old fawn has put India alongside countries like the US and Australia in the field of artificial insemination in wild animals.

 Dr Lalji Singh, director of the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology, said a wild deer gave birth to the fawn on March 14 after an eight-month pregnancy.

 In America as well as Australia, scientists have been carrying out non-surgical insemination to conserve endangered species, though it was the cloned, Edinburgh-born Dollys bleats that first sent shock waves around the world.

 Singh said Spotty owes her birth to three scientists at the Laboratory for Conservation of Endangered Species, set up by the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology. He said the molecular biology centre and the conservation lab were working on artificial insemination in white-feathered vultures, pigeons, rabbits and had perfected the art of cloning.

 I can use a surrogate leopard to clone a cheetah, he said. 

 The experiments are set for a boost in the form of a new complex that LaCONES is getting that will house a semen, tissue, gene and egg bank for all wild, endangered species.

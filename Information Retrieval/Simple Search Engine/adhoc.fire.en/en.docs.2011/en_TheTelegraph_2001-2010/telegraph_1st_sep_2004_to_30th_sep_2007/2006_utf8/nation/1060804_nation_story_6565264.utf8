The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Microsoft city ally

 Calcutta, Aug. 3: Microsoft Research India is planning to join hands with the Indian Statistical Institute (ISI), Calcutta, to conduct research, reports our special correspondent. 

 This stream of research requires strong mathematical understanding and that is available with institutes like ISI. We have given them a proposal and are awaiting their reply, said P. Anandan, managing director, Microsoft Research India. 

 The Bangalore-based research outfit is also in the process of joining hands with IIT Guwahati. It already has a formal association with IIT Kharagpur in language research. 

 Our research agenda is built around six core areas: multilingual systems, technologies for emerging markets, digital geographics, hardware, communications and systems, rigorous software engineering and cryptography, security and algorithms, said Anandan. 

 The laboratory is the third basic research facility owned by Microsoft outside the US.

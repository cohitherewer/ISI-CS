 10-year minority black hole

 DHIRENDRA K. JHA

 Ansari

 New Delhi, March 21: The chairperson of the National Commission for Minorities has alleged that none of its reports has been tabled in Parliament for the last 10 years.

 Since 1995-96, none of the reports of the commission has been introduced in Parliament, Hamid Ansari said. This is despite the fact that the government is expected to introduce the commissions recommendations every year in both Houses and also present an action-taken report.

 The commission has to evaluate programmes meant for the development of minorities, monitor working of the legal and constitutional safeguards for these communities and address specific grievances brought to its notice. Based on these, the commission prepares a status report along with its recommendations. But every year the reports get lost in a bureaucratic black hole, the newly-appointed commission chairman said.

 While the commission gives its recommendations on time, the government fails to prepare the action-taken report. This shows apathetic attitude towards the commissions recommendations, Ansari said.

 The decade-old wait is threatening to push the minority commission into oblivion. Even the initial enthusiasm shown by the United Progressive Alliance government to add some more teeth to the panel, which was formed in 1978 and provided statutory status in 1992, seems to have vanished. Two bills introduced in Parliament for this purpose are still pending with the parliamentary standing committee of the social justice and empowerment ministry.

 Till a fortnight back, the minority commission was part of the ministry of social justice and empowerment. Now, it has been shifted to the newly-formed ministry of minority affairs. 

 But while the social justice and empowerment ministry sat on the minority commissions reports for a decade, it did not do so in the case of the SC/ST commission, the other body attached to it, Ansari said. The reports of the SC/ST commission along with the action-taken reports have been tabled regularly in Parliament by the ministry. Only the reports of the NCM have been put on hold, he claimed.

 Ansari said the commission also faces a serious handicap while undertaking studies on evaluation of programmes for development of minorities and the working of legal safeguards for them. 

 There is no separate fund for the purpose. It seems that the necessity of such studies has not been sufficiently appreciated by the government, Ansari said. The end result is that this (the evaluation and monitoring studies) is taken as an exercise which should rather not be there.

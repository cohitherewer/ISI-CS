 Life term for Dawood aide

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Nov. 6: A sessions court today sentenced Anil Parab of Dawood Ibrahims gang to life imprisonment on the charge of shooting at a witness inside a court more than 20 years ago. The verdict came weeks after the daylight shooting of a police informer near a city court.

 According to the prosecution, Parab had fired at Hansraj Shah, a key witness in a threat case in which he was an accused, inside the Andheri metropolitan magistrates court on June 6, 1984.

 The police fired back and wounded the gangster in the chest and then arrested him. A few months later, Parab was released on bail. He escaped to Dubai, from where he was deported in 2003.

 Jharkhand governor returns profit bill

 OUR BUREAU

 June 5: Following in the footsteps of President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, Jharkhand governor Syed Sibtey Razi today took the ruling party by surprise when he returned the Jharkhand office-of-profit bill to the Assembly for reconsideration.

 The bill had been sent for his endorsement two months ago.

 A one-line communiqu? issued by the Raj Bhavan in Ranchi read: The governor, while exercising the powers conferred by him under the Constitution, has, as per provisions of Article 200 of the Constitution, returned the Jharkhand Legislature (Removal of Disqualification) Bill 2006, passed by the state Assembly, for reconsideration.

 Razi has raised four points for the reconsideration. First, the retrospective effect of the bill should be examined under the provisions of the Constitution. Second, the list of offices the bill proposes for exemption needed another look. Third, the list of offices sought to be exempt and the holders of these offices included those against whom proceedings were already under way by appropriate authorities, which is the Election Commission.

 Finally, the propriety of the bill was questioned as it remained silent on the original legislation ? the Bihar Legislature (Removal of Disqualification) Act, 1950 ? which continues to be applicable to Jharkhand till a new legislation is in place.

 Chief minister Arjun Munda expressed surprise over the governors decision. The bill was passed by the Assembly in March and was sent to the governor for his assent. It is unfortunate that he sought to return the bill after more than two months, Munda said.

 Munda, who was today down with fever, said the cabinet would take up the issue at the earliest.

 The bill had been rushed through the Assembly on March 24 during the budget session to reportedly ensure protection to the chief minister and 11 other BJP MLAs who risked disqualification for holding dual posts of profit. 

 The bill sought to supersede the original legislation titled the Bihar Legislature (Removal of Disqualification) Act, 1950.

 The bill had come in the wake of two petitions filed by Independent MLA Bandhu Tirkey with the governor and the Election Commission, seeking disqualification of Munda and four BJP MLAs for holding dual posts of profit. 

 Another petition had been filed by advocate H.K. Lal with the governor seeking disqualification of 12 other MLAs.

 Parliamentary affairs minister Madhu Koda acknowledged that Raj Bhavan had returned the bill for reconsideration. There are two options before the government to deal with the situation. We can either call a special session of the Assembly and discuss the points raised by the Raj Bhavan or discuss the issue at a cabinet meeting and resend the bill. We shall discuss the matter with our chief minister and take a decision within the next few days.

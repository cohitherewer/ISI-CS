 Lucknow, Dec. 22: It could be plain protocol or it could be confirmation of a much-suspected affair between the BJP and the Samajwadi Party.

 Their rival, the Congress, prefers the more colourful interpretation of the Mulayam Singh government hosting as many as 20 senior delegates to the BJPs strategy session that started here today.

 The delegates currently being treated as state guests are chief ministers of all the BJP-ruled states Narendra Modi, Shivraj Singh Chauhan, Raman Singh, Vasundhara Raje and top leaders like L.K. Advani and Jaswant Singh plus a host of other ministers and several who have been ministers and chief ministers in the past.

 All of them are staying in a five-star hotel across the Gomati. The government is picking up the tab for the state guests. The hotel authorities are reluctant to reveal how much the government would shell out for the hospitality. 

 We have been told that a number of leaders staying here would be treated as state guests. I cant tell you how much it would cost, said a senior manager. 

 Atal Bihari Vajpayee, characteristically, has escaped criticism by maintaining the tradition of staying in Raj Bhavan. 

 The issue has triggered a controversy here with the Congress questioning why Mulayam should host delegates to a BJP event. The BJP explains it as routine protocol. 

 It is wrong to call what is happening here a BJP national executive. This is a joint event being organised by the SP and the BJP, Pramod Tiwari, the Congress Legislature Party leader in Uttar Pradesh, said. 

 The hotel business shows they are sharing resources. But it is not just that. They are sharing political strategies and issues as well. This has been going on in UP for a long time, Tiwari added. 

 While all the chief ministers and the top leaders remained closeted in a convention centre deliberating over party strategy for the next three months, general secretary Arun Jaitley countered the attack by citing protocol.

 Let us not confuse politics with government protocol. This is not Samajwadi Party hospitality but routine procedure that governments follow when chief ministers and cabinet ministers of one state travel to another state, said Jaitley. 

 BJP and SP are poles apart. Ideologically, we negate most of what the SP stands for. We are the principal Opposition party in UP. There is no question of an alliance, he added.

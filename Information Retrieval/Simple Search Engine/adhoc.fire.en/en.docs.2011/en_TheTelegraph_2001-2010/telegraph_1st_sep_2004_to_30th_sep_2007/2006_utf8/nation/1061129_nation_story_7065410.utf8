 Rs 150 crore in balance 

 ANANYA SENGUPTA

 Mumbai, Nov. 28: Bollywood has about Rs 150 crore riding on Sanjay Dutt.

 The actor stopped signing films after it was announced in July that the verdicts in the case would come within weeks. He has been working at a frenetic pace to try and complete as many pending shoots as possible.

 But the fate of at least six films, with over Rs 120 crore invested in them, is in the balance. At stake is another Rs 25 crore put into advertisements featuring Dutt, who can shoot only till December 18 when his bail expires.

 One of the six films is Mr Fraud, directed by Abbas-Mustan. Only a tenth of the big-budget film, which also features Ajay Devgan and Bipasha Basu, has been shot.

 Dutt is also slated to star in a yet-untitled Karan Johar film, to be directed by Soham.

 Sanjay has personally requested Soham not to go ahead with any production plans till the verdict is out, an industry source said.

 As of now, Sohams feeling is he would work with Dutt and no one else, an aide to the director said. The cast includes John Abraham and Kareena Kapoor.

 Dutt has shot for a day for Apoorva Lakhias Shootout at Lokhandwala, which also stars Amitabh and Abhishek Bachchan, Arbaaz Khan and Tusshar Kapoor.

 We had got the combination dates of all the leading artistes, including Amitabh, six months in advance. With Dutts cooperation, we managed to complete that part of the shooting. But he still has about 20 days of shooting left, Lakhia said.

 About a fifth of Indra Kumars Dhamaal is still to be filmed, and though Ajay Chandoks Nehle Pe Dehla is shot, Dutt is yet to start dubbing.

 Another movie facing an uncertain future is Dutts home production, Behaad. The actor is believed to have written the story for the film. Shooting was to start in January in the jungles of Madhya Pradesh.

 However, Vidhu Vinod Chopras Eklavya, which casts Dutt with Sharmila Tagore, Jackie Shroff, Saif Ali Khan and Vidya Balan, is complete and its post-production work is on. 

 Sanjay Gupta has replaced Dutt with Gulshan Grover in Woodstock Villa.

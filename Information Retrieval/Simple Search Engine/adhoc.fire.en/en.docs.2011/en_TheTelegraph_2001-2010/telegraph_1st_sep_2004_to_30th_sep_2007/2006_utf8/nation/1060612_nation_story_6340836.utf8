 Suicide bid at Fanaa theatre

 Ahmedabad, June 11 (PTI): A man today made an immolation bid at Jamnagars Amber cinema, the only one in Gujarat screening Aamir Khans film Fanaa.

 Theatres in the state have refused to screen the film in the wake of Aamirs remarks on the rehabilitation of Narmada dam oustees.

 Police identified the man as Pravin Joshi, 30, who received around 70 per cent burns and is undergoing treatment. Joshi said he tried to immolate himself for the cause of Narmada and to make the people of Gujarat aware about the enemies of the dam project on the river, the police said.

 However, the theatre has decided to continue with the screening of the film. Its manager, Mansur Sheikh, said there was adequate security on the premises and it would be tightened further.

 Joshi said in his statement that he is from Porbandar and works in a private firm in Rajkot. 

 He also told the police that he was disturbed by the screening of Fanaa in Jamnagar and decided to do something to wake up the people of Gujarat. 

 Joshi said he was not affiliated to any political party or social organisation.

 He came to Jamnagar from Rajkot and entered the cinema with kerosene and a matchbox. He went inside the toilet around 5.30 pm, poured the kerosene and torched himself, an investigating officer said.

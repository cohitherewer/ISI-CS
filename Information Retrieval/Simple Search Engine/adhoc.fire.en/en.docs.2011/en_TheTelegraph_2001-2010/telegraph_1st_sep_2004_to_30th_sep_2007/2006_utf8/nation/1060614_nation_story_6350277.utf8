 BBC sniffs for desi ads

 ASHWANI TALWAR

Indian taste

 New Delhi, June 13: Will Indian viewers get to see desi advertisements on foreign news channels like the BBC and CNN soon?

 Information and broadcasting ministry guidelines dont approve of foreign news channels carrying commercials aimed directly at the Indian viewer. 

 But the buzz is that BBC World has applied to the ministry for permission to carry India-specific advertisements. The channel, however, wouldnt confirm or deny this.

 Under the ministrys downlink guidelines, one of the conditions for allowing a foreign news channel to broadcast in this country is that it does not carry any advertisements aimed at Indian viewers. 

 The restriction protects Indian channels, which would lose revenue if the ads went to foreign networks showing in India. In a more roundabout way, the ban keeps foreign channels distinctly foreign: the government is also particular that they show only their standard bulletins and not anything designed only for India. 

 But the I amp;B guidelines carry an escape clause that says the ministry can waive or modify the India-specific ad restriction on a case-by-case basis.

 Both the BBC and CNN are understood to have mentioned the restriction on India-specific ads while applying for registration with the ministry last month.

 The registration is now mandatory and the I amp;B ministry had asked all foreign channels to apply before May 10 ? or they wouldnt be allowed to telecast in India.

 A spokesperson said the BBC World Service is telecast through the PAS 10 satellite across South and West Asia and advertisement campaigns on it are seen in several countries, including India.

 But could there be ads mainly meant for Indians? The spokesperson wouldnt clarify.

 The BBC World Service application was submitted on 10 May, 2006, and meets the requirements set out by the information and broadcasting ministry, the spokesperson said through email. The application is now with the ministry for its consideration and so it is not the right time to discuss application details.

 CNN, however, said it had not applied for a waiver.

 But at the same time ? even while welcoming the terms ? it argued that in its case a waiver was not necessary. 

 Partly echoing the BBC argument, Turner International India managing director Anshuman Misra said all CNN International content ? programmes and advertisements ? were seen in several countries, none solely in India. 

 Accordingly, CNNI considers that it is not required to apply for a waiver under the downlinking policy, he said.

 Poll to probe viewers choices

 ASHWANI TALWAR

 What do you watch?

 New Delhi, July 9: How much are you willing to spend every month on cable television? Would you shift from cable to direct-to-home (DTH) television if you had a choice? Do you have a favourite news channel?

 For answers, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) will soon commission a survey across 20 cities. 

 The planned survey is meant to assess the state of cable television services across the country; from how much people pay for their cable TV to the quality of the transmission they get. It will also capture a picture of consumer expectations.

 Trai feels it needs the information for better inputs to the government for formulating regulations concerning the industry.

 For example, the survey will try to determine how willing people are to switch from cable to platforms like DTH in which you get television through a small satellite dish at your own home. Also, what would make them switch ? specific channels a new platform might offer or the size of their new monthly bill?

 Trai is now hunting for an agency to conduct the survey in 20 cities, including Delhi, Mumbai, Calcutta, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad and the smaller Chandigarh, Varanasi, Kanpur, Kochi and Jamshedpur.

 The sample size in each city will be proportional to its population.

 On prices, the survey will track the increase in cable bills over the past two years in different cities. 

 It will quiz consumers on the maximum they are willing to spend, and for what. For example, would they pay more if they got more channels in a particular genre, like Hindi news or travel?

 If the conditional access system is implemented, would people like to pay according to the individual channels they subscribe to or would they prefer to be quoted a monthly tariff for a bouquet of channels?

 The study will determine the extent of choice cable TV viewers now have and their preferences among channels. 

 It will give Trai an idea of how well the telecom regulator itself is known, particularly among cable operators.

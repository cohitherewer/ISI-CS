 Minnow BSP holds the key

 DHIRENDRA K JHA

 New Delhi, March 15: As the final preparations are being made for the election of six Rajya Sabha members from Bihar, the spotlight has swivelled to an unlikely party: the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP).

 The numbers game has reached a point where the party with minuscule presence in the Bihar Assembly has emerged as the most sought after group in the state.

 The BSP, which has four MLAs in the 242-member Assembly, is likely to decide the fate of the sixth candidate for Rajya Sabha. 

 Of the six vacancies from the state, five have already been distributed among the major parties in the state -- four have fallen in the lap of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) and one vacancy will be filled by the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD).

 For the election of the sixth candidate, the BSPs support has become crucial.

 The RJD and the Lok Janashakti Party (LJP) of Ram Vilas Paswan have decided to field candidates for the sixth slot. Both need the backing of the BSPs four MLAs to make it to the Rajya Sabha. 

 The BSP, however, has kept its cards close to its chest, leaving both sides unsure of the path Mayavatis elephant will opt for. 

 While the RJD is yet to announce its candidate, the LJPs nominee is its vice-president Ranjan Yadav.

 The RJD-led UPA has 65 votes in the Assembly. After electing one candidate, which will require 35 votes, it will be left with 30 votes and will need five more votes from outside the UPA. If it gets the BSPs support, it can manage to fill the gap and win another seat.

 The LJP, on the other hand, has 10 seats in the Assembly. Party sources said it has mustered the support of all the 11 independent MLAs as well as smaller parties like the CPI, the CPI-ML (Liberation) and the Samajwadi Party. Together, the small parties account for 10 MLAs. 

 The LJP candidate also has a better chance of getting two spare votes of the NDA, which has a total strength of 142 seats in the Assembly and which will require 140 votes to send four candidates to the Rajya Sabha.

 Put together, the LJPs candidate will have the backing of 33 votes, falling short of two votes to complete the required number of 35. 

 As each and every vote in the state has almost got accounted for, only the BSP with its four MLAs is yet to show its inclination. Whichever side the BSP goes to will win.

 In case the BSP prefers to abstain ? which is unlikely ? the LJP candidate with 33 votes will score over the RJD nominee with 30 votes.

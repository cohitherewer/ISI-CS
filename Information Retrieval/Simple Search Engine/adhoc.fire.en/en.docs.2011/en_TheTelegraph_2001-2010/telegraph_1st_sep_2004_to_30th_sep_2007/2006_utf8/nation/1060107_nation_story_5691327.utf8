 Once-bitten mission back in Mumbai hunt

 Aziz Ahmad Khan: Hopeful

 Mumbai, Jan. 6: Pakistan high commissioner Aziz Ahmad Khan today met a building society in Mumbai where the Pakistan high commission was refused a flat to house its consulate.

 The high commissioner, who is based in Delhi, met the building society of Mittal Chambers in Nariman Point. It is not known what transpired, but there are indications that the building may reconsider its decision.

 Pakistan deputy high commissioner to India Munawar Bhatti confirmed the meeting from Delhi, but did not say what was discussed. He, however, added that there was reason to be hopeful.

 The spokesperson of the building, too, said it would look at the decision again.

 There may be much bonhomie elsewhere on Indo-Pak interaction, but in trying to find a home in Mumbai, Islamabad has been as helpless as many in the city.

 The high commission was all set to enter into a 7,000 square feet flat in Mittal Chambers, one of the costliest locations in the city. The flat is owned by Vivek Singhal, who happens to be the brother of VHP leader Ashok Singhal.

 Vivek had stressed that it was a pure business deal he was entering into with the Pakistan high commission and that his brothers ideology would have no bearing on the contract, which would be for three years. 

 But his neighbours had a problem.

 Last week, the society, which has members like Reliance Infocomm, Emirates Airlines and Bank of Maharashtra, met several times and said it objected to the presence of a consulate as it makes the building vulnerable to security threats.

 Once the consulate, which shut down in 1992, reopens, people from Maharashtra, Goa and Gujarat will not have to travel to Delhi to get visas to Pakistan. The society felt that a long line of visa-seekers that the high commission would necessarily bring could pose a danger.

 The high commission is keen on the Mittal Chambers address, as its struggle to find a place in the city has been long and hard.

 Pakistans first choice for reopening the office was Jinnah House in the city, but the Indian government refused.

 According to Pakistani newspaper Daily Times, the Maharashtra government apparently tried to sell a plot in Navi Mumbai for the relocation of the consulate. But Pakistani authorities found it unsuitable. 

 They found a plot near Santa Cruz, near the airport, for a permanent building and sought to house the consulate temporarily in another address.

 Now that has run into trouble, too.

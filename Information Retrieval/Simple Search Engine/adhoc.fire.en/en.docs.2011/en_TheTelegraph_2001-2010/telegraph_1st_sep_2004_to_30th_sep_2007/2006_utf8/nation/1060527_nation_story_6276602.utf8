New Delhi, May 26 (PTI): Two IITs today described the governments decision to increase seats in higher education institutions as disastrous. 

 Introducing reservation for OBCs, the Centre said it would keep the general category seats intact by raising the total number. 

 Contending that the governments move would adversely affect the academic quality of the premier institutes, the two IITs called for a reconsideration of the decision.

 If a sudden increase of faculty is imposed on us by a drastic increase in seats, the entire academic standing of the IITs will be compromised, the faculty of IIT Kanpur wrote in a letter to the President and the Prime Minister.

 IIT Delhi, after conducting a seminar on quotas, resolved that the proposal on modification of (the) admission procedure by introducing caste-based quota would adversely affect the quality of education in the IITs as it would disturb the campus harmony amongst the students and the faculty.

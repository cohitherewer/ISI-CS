 Bullets in engineers computer

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chennai, June 12: Two AK-47 bullets were found in the baggage of a New York-bound software engineer at the Chennai international airport this morning.

 Police sources said when a laptop that 42-year-old Srinivasan was carrying went through security check just before boarding, a beep alerted officials.

 The computer was then dismantled and the two bullets popped out. Officials later found that the bullets can be used in AK-47 rifles.

 Although Srinivasan denied any knowledge about the bullets, he was not allowed to board the Lufthansa flight to New York and was arrested. 

 The police are interrogating him for any possible militant background.

 Srinivasan, who lives in the US, was here to visit his father, the police said.

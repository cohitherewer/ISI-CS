 Freight corridor in Buddha bag

 - PM builds business bridge with CM

 Bhattacharjee, Singh: Cordial conversation 

 New Delhi, March 10: At a time when his government is under fire from the CPM on Iran, the Prime Minister today did business with the Bengal chief minister in a signal that their relations were on an even keel.

 The first was the assurance that though the railway budget had spoken of ending the new freight corridor at Sonnagar in Bihar, it would be extended to Bengal.

 Lalu Prasads budget had spoken of a Ludhiana-Sonnagar freight corridor despite earlier promises of a Delhi-Calcutta one. After pressure from Bengal MPs, Lalu Prasad had said the Centre would consider extending the corridor.

 At their half-hour meeting, Manmohan Singh also told Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee that the Sagar island port would be converted into a deep-sea port to enable bigger ships to dock there, sources in the Prime Ministers Office (PMO) said.

 The project involves huge investments and the UPA government has already sanctioned Rs 10 crore for a feasibility study.

 The Calcutta Port Trust had on its own mooted a similar proposal and unsuccessfully sought the Japanese International Cooperation Agencys help for a feasibility study. Now the Centre has taken care of it.

 Finally, the Centre ratified a memorandum of understanding the chief minister had signed with Vietnam, during his recent visit, for food-processing, fisheries development and marine economy.

 The first half of the talks was attended by officials from both sides, but the last 15 minutes constituted a one-to-one meeting between Singh and Bhattacharjee.

 PMO sources refused to disclose details but said the interaction was very cordial and covered a gamut of issues. They would not say if Iran and the Indo-US nuclear deal had figured in the discussions.

 Congress sources conceded the party was not too keen to publicise the corridor issue for fear it might blunt their campaign against the Left Front in the Assembly polls.

 The Prime Minister, too, is not interested in politicising such interactions, the sources said. 

 Singh respects the chief ministers commitment to economic reforms and development despite the ideological pulls and pressures from his party.

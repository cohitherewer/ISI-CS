 Dalits fume at enemy choice

 DHIRENDRA K. JHA

 Mayavati

Agra, Aug. 8: When the Jatavs of Durjikapura chased away their village head, they were sending a message to Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayavati.

 The Scheduled Caste villagers were angry that Shivlal Azad, their sector leader (as BSP village heads are called), was trying to persuade them to back a man they have always despised as a symbol of upper-caste oppression.

 Chhotelal Verma is the BJP legislator from Agras Fatehabad Assembly constituency whom Mayavati has decided to field from the seat in the 2007 state polls.

 The Jatavs, a dominant caste in western Uttar Pradesh, have for years offered Mayavati a solid vote bank in the Agra-Mathura region. But her backing of a hated person like Verma has brewed resentment not only in Durjikapura but many other nearby villages.

 To the extent that a downcast Shivlal says: I have stopped discussing party politics with the people (read Jatavs).

 If theres one Pandit the Jatavs hate, its Verma whose contempt for the lower castes is well known. Mayavati can embrace him; we cannot, says Khayali Ram, a Jatav from Durjikapura.

 Khayali had joined the BSP at the time of its birth in 1984, but Mayavatis embrace of Verma has prompted him to leave the party.

 Feelings are running equally high at Vajidpur, Vishai Nangla, Maade Nangla, Ashapura, Kanf Nangla and Naharkapur.

 In all these villages, the majority of Jatavs feel they are being used by Mayavati as pawns in her fight for power, says Udhav, a Dalit resident of Naharkapura.

 In recent months, Mayavati has been looking to widen her appeal by wooing the upper castes, especially the Brahmins who make up nine per cent of the states voters. 

 The BSP chief has organised Brahmin Mahasammelans and even spoken of a Dalit-Brahmin-Muslim axis.

 Its a strategy unlikely to impress those who have been her staunchest supporters in a region she had once dubbed the Dalit capital of Uttar Pradesh.

 To the Jatavs in this belt, with their long history of resistance to oppression by Jats and Brahmins, Verma is the enemy.

 We gave our full support to the BSP because it was identified with our struggle against upper caste oppression. Mayavatis latest deviation has disillusioned a large section of Jatavs. Some of them have already begun talking of voting for the Congress in the Assembly polls, says Khayali.

 Cong plays safe on UP

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 1: The Congress today attacked the Uttar Pradesh government for allegedly unleashing violence during the local bodies elections this week, but stopped short of demanding Presidents rule in the state.

 Parties like the Jan Morcha, floated by V.P. Singh and Raj Babbar, have cried foul over the reported rigging and booth capturing and called for central rule to be clamped before the Assembly polls early next year. But the Congress found it hard to explain its continued support to the Mulayam Singh Yadav government. 

 Our support is a formality. The issue is irrelevant to the party and the public. It (the support) may be to uphold the concept of keeping the BJP at bay and showing we are united against communalism. Its a kind of status quo which the leadership has decided must not be disturbed, party spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi said.

 Asked if the Mulayam government should be sacked, Singhvi said he was not in a position to comment. It is for the constitutional machinery to decide. 

 Singhvi insisted there was nothing anomalous in the Congresss support to the Samajwadi Party government, saying a lot of parties in India work together on larger issues, though internally they may be against each other. 

 Even politically, the support costs the Congress nothing. It does not get us or make us lose a single vote. So why should we withdraw? he asked.

 But the Congress shared the concern of other parties over whether the Assembly elections would be smooth. The polling yesterday can give you an idea of whats in store in the Assembly elections. This anarchical state of affairs had been seen earlier and this feeling will be generated when what matters is money and muscle power alone. If the trailer we saw yesterday can be so fearful, what is likely to be the full length film? Singhvi asked.

 The dilemma on propping up the Uttar Pradesh government is not the only one the Congress is grappling with. The other is whether Rahul Gandhi should campaign extensively. 

 Unlike Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who pitched in for the BJP in local elections, Sonia Gandhi and Rahul have stayed away despite feedback that the Congresss prospects were not too good. They didnt even enter Rae Bareli and Amethi, of which they are MPs.

 Party sources say, Rahul, mandated for a much larger role, should not involve himself in micro-level elections. 

 However, most functionaries admit the results expected over this weekend will give an idea of whats in store in the big fight ahead. If the Congresss performance is disastrous, Rahul is unlikely to be used in a big way in the Assembly campaign.

 There is little chance the Congress will project its leader, either. At best we can double our present tally, from 16 to 30, so why bring in personalities? asked a source. 

 There is clarity, however, on the need for seat adjustments with the smaller secular parties like the Jan Morcha, Ajit Singhs Rashtriya Lok Dal and the CPI.

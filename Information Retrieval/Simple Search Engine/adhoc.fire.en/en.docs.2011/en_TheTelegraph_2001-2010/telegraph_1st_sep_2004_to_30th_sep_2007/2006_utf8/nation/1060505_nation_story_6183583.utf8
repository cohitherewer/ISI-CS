 Pramod saves BJP from yatra

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 4: In Pramod Mahajans death, the BJP has finally found a legitimate reason to put an end to the embarrassment it calls the Bharat Suraksha Yatra.

 A statement issued by party president Rajnath Singh this afternoon said: In the wake of the sudden demise of Pramod Mahajan, the remaining part of the Bharat Suraksha Yatra led by both L.K. Advani and Rajnath Singh stands cancelled.

 The month-long journey, seen by most as Advanis self-promotion exercise, was still to pass through Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Haryana before culminating in a rally in Delhi on May 10.

 Significantly, it was not Advani but Singh who announced the cancellation as a belated assertion of his official status as party president.

 It is widely known in the Sangh circles that Singh was not consulted before Advani decided to launch the yatra to focus on what he referred to as the central governments dangerous minorityism.

 Most Sangh satraps believed that the newly-appointed BJP president should have been politically adept enough to counter Advani. The least he could have done was to put up a token resistance to such nonsensical plans. He could have suggested that the issue be discussed with party office-bearers before any official announcement, said an RSS source.

 It was ironic that Mahajans death was ultimately the reason for cancelling the yatra as he himself was not at all convinced that the exercise would boost the BJPs electoral prospects in the ongoing polls.

 Any such exercise helps to energise and politicise the party workers. Besides that, I can truthfully tell you there is nothing much to be gained out of this, Mahajan had said.

 Drains tease IIT brains

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chennai, Oct. 15: Forget brain drain. Its drains of a more mundane kind that are teasing brains at the Indian Institutes of Technology.

 How do we clean sewers without anybody having to get into them, IIT Chennai director M.S. Ananth challenged his audience of 200 alumni from the seven IITs here last evening.

 His question reflected the motto of the meet: that Brand IIT isnt just about the shining India of booming infotech and surging sensex. Its as much about helping those who missed out.

 Many of the former students have already taken the plunge. Balaji Sampath has helped prepare a cheap science kit for rural schools. Varadarajan of the 1966 batch is bringing the Internet to Madurais remote villages.

 But it wasnt only students and alumni who were expected to work their brains and come up with the answer to Ananths question.

 The Chennai institute has tied up with the Lemelson Foundation of the US to reward and develop grassroots innovations. It has unearthed talent in unexpected places.

 A retired government employee who never went to college has invented an efficient cooking stove. This shows that even at 60, theres still a spark left in the man, Ananth told the audience with a twinkle.

 The meeting was a warm-up for PANIIT-2006, the December 23-25 IIT global conference in Mumbai where 5,000 alumni are expected. They will debate on ways of creating jobs in the villages and easing farmers distress.

 IIT now also stands for Inspiration for and Involvement in Transforming India, quipped Ashank Desai, IIT Mumbai graduate and one of Nasscoms founders.

 Chennai alumnus Sampath has started an NGO, Aid India, with a group of IITians and other volunteers to improve the quality of Tamil Nadus school education system.

 Enrolment is no longer the problem. Thirty lakh children go to school at the primary level, but at the end of five years most cant read a single paragraph of Tamil, he said. Aid India has already provided its Rs 2,000 science kit to 400 schools.

 Varadarajan is helping an NGO, Dhan Foundation, open Internet kiosks in Madurais villages through a version of the wireless-in-local-loop (WLL) technology developed on the Chennai campus. About 200 villages in Thiruvallur will soon be covered.

 IIT Chennais rural technology action group and the initiative with Lemelson are trying to develop a bio-degradable clay cup to better both the plastic cup and the kulhar, mud blocks for low-cost housing, solar-powered fans and the like.

 The Mumbai conference will discuss how technology can reduce poverty, help governance and foster entrepreneurship, Desai said. There will be a separate track on how IITians spouses can do their bit.

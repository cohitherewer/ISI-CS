 Strike force swells

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 29: The anti-reservation agitation continued in full swing today with more educational institutions joining the striking medical students in their own ways.

 Despite a Supreme Court notice to the government to review its quota policy in eight weeks and an appeal to students to call off the agitation, the protesters said they would stay put.

 The students, however, have decided to resume parallel out-patient services following the apex court appeal, said Kushal, a senior resident doctor at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences.

 Students from the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, and Jawaharlal Nehru University launched relay hunger strikes of their own today. We are demanding a judicial review of reservation because we dont know whether reservation has served its purpose for the past 50 years, said Sanjay Pandey, who is coordinating both strikes.

 Faculty from three government hospitals ? Maulana Azad Medical College, University College of Medical Sciences and Safdarjung Hospital ? has gone on mass casual leave.

 Resident doctors of AIIMS met former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee seeking the BJPs support for their anti-reservation agitation.

 Airlines to pay for delays

 Harried passengers at Delhi airport 

 New Delhi, Dec. 24 (PTI): The state consumer commission has held that airlines operating from Delhi will have to pay domestic passengers stranded at airports owing to flight cancellations and delays caused by technical snags a compensation of Rs 10,000 each if they are made to wait over two hours.

 Every airline operating from Delhi shall pay a minimum compensation of Rs 10,000 to every domestic passenger in case there is delay in departure and arrival of two hours or more than the scheduled time... Justice J.D. Kapoor, president of the commission, said in an order.

 The commission also said all affected passengers of international flights would have to be paid Rs 20,000 each as compensation.

 Delays, flight cancellations, offloading of consumers with confirmed tickets and traffic congestion in the air and on the ground have become the order of the day, Justice Kapoor said. They cause enormous mental agony, harassment and physical discomfort which are not assessable in terms of money.

 The commission, however, observed that the delays caused by inclement weather and tyre bursts, which are beyond the control of the service providers, would not be considered for compensation.

 The order came on an appeal filed by Alliance Air Ltd against the verdict of a district consumer forum, which had asked the airline to pay Rs 6,000 as compensation to Daljit Singh Nirman who could not attend a meeting in Jammu because his flight was delayed by six hours at Delhi airport. 

 Nirmans flight to Jammu on September 26, 1999, was scheduled to leave Delhi at 10.10 am. On his arrival at the airport, he was informed that the flight would leave two hours after the scheduled time but it took off after six hours.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 KBC clips, now in Pak

 Karachi, Sept. 5 (PTI): 

 A Pakistani call-in phone company is doing brisk business 

 by using Amitabh Bachchans (in picture) voice 

 in its Kaun Banega Crorepati-like quiz show.

 Telefun, which runs the show, is luring callers by mixing voice-takes from the original KBC and its own host who sounds and speaks like the superstar.

 Bachchan features prominently in the advertisements and promotional slots for the show titled Kya Aap Banengay Crorepati (Do you want to become a millionaire?).

 Telefun had been pulled up by the local government in Karachi for putting up banners in which Bachchan invited callers to take part in the show with a Pakistani flag in the background. Telefun had to remove the flag.

 The response to our programme 

 has been very good. We find callers enjoy participating 

 in a quiz show hosted by someone who speaks and sounds like 

 Bachchan, a Telefun executive said.

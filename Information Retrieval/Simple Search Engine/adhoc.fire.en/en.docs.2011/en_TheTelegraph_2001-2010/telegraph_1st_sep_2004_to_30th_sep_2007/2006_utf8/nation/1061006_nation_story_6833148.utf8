 Bengal works on industry document

 Calcutta, Oct. 5: The Bengal government today said it would draw up a comprehensive document on its approach towards industrialisation.

 The announcement came a day after chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee convened an all-party meeting to explain the governments industrialisation policy in the wake of the controversy over land acquisition in Singur for the Tata car project.

 The proposed document is also expected to dwell on the performance of the agricultural and horticultural sectors, the governments efforts to meet targets in the two areas and its plans to strengthen industry without harming farm growth. 

 We have been stressing on the need to have such a detailed document for a long time. The paper will focus on the governments perspective towards industrialisation. The matter has been discussed at yesterdays all-party meeting, industry secretary Sabyasachi Sen said.

 Yesterday, the Congress had demanded that the government publish a white paper on industrialisation.

 The government, however, is unwilling to call the document a white paper. I dont know what is a white paper. We want to bring transparency in our activities and the document will serve this purpose, Sen said.

 Sources said the document is likely to mention locations where the government expects to set up industrial units. It will also highlight areas of development and focus on the infrastructure development required.

 There are many investors who are keen on setting up units only in and around the city. But not all of them can be provided with land at places they want. As a result, our focus will be to develop connectivity with remote districts like Purulia and Bankura and the document will mention the names of the places where we plan to build such connectivity, an official said.

 Several prospective investors have shown interest in places that are well-connected to ports. Keeping such a preference in mind, the government intends to build expressways linking the remote districts with Haldia and Calcutta. The Indonesia-based Salim Group has already agreed to construct the Barasat-Raichak expressway.

 Farmer suicide heat in UP

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mulayam: Under glare

 Lucknow, Oct. 9: Mulayam Singh Yadav has rarely missed a chance to take a swipe at Sonia Gandhi over farmer suicides in Vidarbha, part of the Congress-ruled Maharashtra.

 Now, his rivals are not lagging behind in their attempts to reap a rich political harvest as reports of the dire act pour in from a large swathe of Uttar Pradeshs dust bowls.

 Some tragedies are too close to Lucknow for the chief ministers comfort. On September 25, Munshilal, 42, and his 18-year-old son hanged themselves from a tree on their paddy field in Unnaos Safipura, only 55 km from the capital. 

 The duo was crushed under loans raised from a money lender, a cooperative bank and through a farmer credit card. The 1.75 acres they tilled hardly yielded crops enough to repay Rs 18,000. Worse, rations meant for below-poverty-line families never reached the area, said a relative.

 A week before, Bhajanlal, 53, chose to die the same way in Mahobas Rebai in Bundelkhand. He was not the only one in Mahoba to repay loans with life. Ramchandra from Madra and Kishorilal from Paroi did so before. On September 3, Kamlesh killed himself in another part of Uttar Pradesh.

 As the death count escalates, so have charges of callousness against the Mulayam regime from the Congress and V.P. Singhs Jan Morcha, whose ally CPI (ML) also joined the chorus.

 The Congress has already hit the streets with a satyagraha to press for a special package for eastern Uttar Pradesh, where it says farmer suicides have become common. It has claimed around 50 such deaths, mostly of farmers and weavers, in the districts of Chandauli, Mirzapur and Varanasi.

 Singhs Jan Morcha blames the government for ignoring farmers issues. Having attacked Mulayam for the plight of farmers in Dadri, where Anil Ambanis Reliance Energy has planned a huge power plant, the former Prime Minister warned Mulayam would face the consequences. Today he is ignoring the issue of farmer suicides, but he will have to face peoples anger soon.

 The suicides are recurring because of the disruption of poverty alleviation schemes, said Akhilesh Pratap Singh, state secretary of the CPI (ML), which mobilised supporters from 40 districts for a hunger strike.

 The party, which has support in backward Bundelkhand and in districts like Chandauli, claims couple of hundreds of farmers and weavers have committed suicide during the last two years. 

 The government admits some suicides, but is quick to point out that it extends help to farmers in trouble. In fact, it did offer Rs 20,000, and ration coupons, to Kamleshs family.

 Mulayam himself accepts farmer distress, but only in Bundelkhand, and blames it on the Centres failure to come up with a backward-area package. Most farmers are dying because of the central governments anti-farmer attitude, said Samajwadi Party secretary Ram Saran Das.

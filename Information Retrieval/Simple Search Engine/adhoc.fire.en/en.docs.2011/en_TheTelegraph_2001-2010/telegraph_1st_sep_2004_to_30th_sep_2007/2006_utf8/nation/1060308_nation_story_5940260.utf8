 New Delhi, March 7: Authorities stepped up security in Varanasi and the Centre advised the Uttar Pradesh government to maintain peace at all costs as fears of a communal flare-up hung heavy in the wake of the triple strike.

 Sources said Congress chief Sonia Gandhi has decided to rush to the pilgrim city for an on-the-spot assessment along with Union home minister Shivraj Patil tonight.

 The decision came after a meeting Sonia held with party general secretaries Ahmed Patel and Janardhan Dwivedi.

 Immediately after the blasts, top home ministry officials went into a huddle and decided to sound a red alert across all states. After the meeting, Union home secretary V.K. Duggal said as soon as he heard about the blasts, he told the Uttar Pradesh chief secretary to seal Varanasi.

 We have already five companies of the CRPF at the Uttar Pradesh governments disposal. If the need arises and the state government wants, the National Security Guards can also be flown to Varanasi any time, Duggal added.

 Sources in Varanasi said additional forces have been deployed at public places and vital installations, including the airport, railway stations and bus stands, while patrolling has been intensified throughout the city. Security has also been stepped up in and around the Kashi Viswanath temple-Gyanvapi mosque and other religious places.

 Security has also been tightened at the famous hill temple of Lord Venkateswara in Tirumala, Andhra Pradesh. Sources said all states have been sent an advisory to beef up security arrangements at religious places.

 The sources said Sonias decision to go to Varanasi along with Patil could have larger political connotations in view of the recent developments like the Mau riots, the protests against the cartoons of Prophet Mohammad. 

 The blasts also triggered accusations of minority appeasement against the Congress. 

 Former BJP chief L.K. Advani said when he heard of the blasts, he realised his apprehensions were correct.

 This is my belief that if political parties are encouraging minorityism and indulge in competition in this regard, particularly the ruling party, its results would be beneficial neither for the country nor for the community, he told reporters.

 The RSS described the explosions as shocking and disturbing and accused both the Centre and the Mulayam Singh Yadav-led state government of being incapable to deal with the menace of terrorism.

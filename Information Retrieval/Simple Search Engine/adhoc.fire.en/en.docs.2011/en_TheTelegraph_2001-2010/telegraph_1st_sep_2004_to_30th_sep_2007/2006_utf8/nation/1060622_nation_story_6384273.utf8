 Taj gift to neighbours on table

 ASHWANI TALWAR

 New Delhi, June 21: Visitors from Indias neighbouring countries would pay much less than those from the West for a view of Taj Mahal, if a tourism ministry proposal is put into practice.

 For seeing the Taj, Indians pay Rs 20 and foreigners Rs 750. But the tourism and culture ministry feels all foreign tourists are not the same and that visitors from neighbouring countries, falling under the Saarc or BIMSTEC umbrella, should pay the same as Indians.

 This proposal, which came with some others, was drafted after tourism minister Ambika Sonis recent visit to the Taj along with some officials.

 Saarc includes India and its immediate neighbours ? Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Nepal, the Maldives and Bhutan. BIMSTEC, an economic cooperation grouping of Indias eastern neighbours, has five of Saarcs seven members in addition to Myanmar and Thailand.

 India is among several countries where foreigners pay more than citizens to enter monuments and other tourist sites. China, Thailand, Nigeria, Sri Lanka, Cambodia, South Africa, Egypt, Kenya and Russia follow the practice, which at times doesnt go down well with the low-budget traveller. 

 But Indian officials point out that the single fee charged in the US and in European countries is often too high.

 Then there is also the economic argument.

 Only some 120 of the nearly 3,700 centrally protected monuments are ticketed. And most of the money spent on their conservation and maintenance comes from the Union budget. Of the Rs 260 crore spent on conservation each year, only a little over Rs 50 crore comes from the sale of tickets.

 But what foreigners pay is crucial. Of the Rs 53 crore collected from ticket sales nationwide in 2004-05, about 75 per cent came from the higher rates paid by foreigners, when a mere 20 lakh of them visited ticketed monuments compared with over 2 crore Indians.

 Still, the ministry feels that visitors from Asian countries ? perceived as poorer compared to the West ? should be spared the higher rates. 

 After Sonis visit to the Taj, the ministry announced a grand plan to spruce up the monuments surroundings.

 It also suggested an international airport at Agra and noted the problem of too many guides pestering tourists.

 The ministry does not like gun-toting security guards accompanying VIPs into the complex when rules dont allow firearms. This, it says, needs to be sorted out with the home ministry.

 But it would like to go easy on cellphones, which are now banned.

 For any proposal to be implemented, it first needs to be circulated among the other ministries concerned and then cleared by the cabinet. This has yet to be done.

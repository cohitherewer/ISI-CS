 Nitish wants say on Buta successor

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, Jan. 27: A day after Buta Singh resigned as Bihar governor, chief minister Nitish Kumar has demanded that the Centre consult him before appointing a replacement.

 So far I have not received any communication from the Union home minister?. But I favour that a neutral, honest and fair person should be appointed to the constitutional post, Nitish said today.

 There is a consensus on such an approach (of consulting the chief minister on a governors appointment) ? through the recommendations of the Sarkaria Commission, judgments of the Supreme Court, discussions of the National Integration Council and meetings of all political parties.

 Speaking to reporters after meeting the outgoing governor, Nitish emphasised that such consultations should not be a formality in which the chief minister is simply informed about the Centres choice of governor.

 I favour an agreement between the Centre and the chief minister concerned in all cases. This is necessary for good governance. I do not favour a politics of confrontation between the Centre and the states.

 Nitish, who had earlier been closeted with Buta for more than an hour, said it was a personal meeting and no political meaning should be read into it.

 I wanted to talk to him, the chief minister said a few hours before Bengal governor Gopal Krishna Gandhi was temporarily given additional charge of Bihar.

 The chief minister refused to comment on who could be the new governor, dismissing as media speculation all the talk about Sushil Kumar Shinde, C.K. Jaffer Sharief and A.R. Kidwai.

 The BJP has demanded that an apolitical person should be appointed to Raj Bhavan.

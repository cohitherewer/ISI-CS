 PM science sermon

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 6: Concurring with widespread concerns in scientific circles, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today said research standards have declined in Indian universities and warned about a disconnect between research and teaching in the sciences.

 While research has increasingly been concentrated in specialised institutes, the universities are unable to mobilise adequate financial and intellectual resources to support creative research, Singh said, speaking at the platinum jubilee celebrations of the National Academy of Sciences.

 The resulting divorce between teaching and research hampers the growth of the spirit of inquisitiveness and enquiry among students coming out of our universities.

 Singh said universities in Calcutta, Delhi and Madras once had active science departments. We need teachers who inspire students by operating on the frontiers of knowledge. It is my sincere intention to once again restore the link between research and teaching in our universities.

 But science educators and researchers have warned that such an initiative would require a cultural shift in the university system and ground realities today make it unlikely to yield results in the near future.

 One scientist said most of Indias universities have been on a slow self-destruct mode. There is no accountability, no pressure on university researchers to perform, and the few faculty who are enthusiastic about research typically run into bureaucratic brickwalls, said K.V.S. Rao, a senior biologist in a research institution in New Delhi. 

 Any change would demand a huge cultural shift, and right now where is the pressure to change?

 The Prime Minister said the government had increased financial allocations for science teaching in India and was committed to increasing the annual expenditure on science and technology from less than one per cent of the GDP to two per cent of the GDP in the next five years. 

 Singh also cited the recent launch of the new Indian Institutes of Science Education and Research as part of the governments efforts to rejuvenate science in India.

 But a senior science educator said such new institutions would only divert even more resources away from existing universities. 

 Many new institutions today operate with severe faculty shortages and lack of facilities, said K.L. Chopra, former director of the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur.

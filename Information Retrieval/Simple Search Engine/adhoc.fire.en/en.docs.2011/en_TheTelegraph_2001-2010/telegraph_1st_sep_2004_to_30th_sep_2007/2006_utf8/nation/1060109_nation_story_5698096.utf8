 German slain for property

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Jan. 8: A 72-year-old German archaeologists headless body was found at her Pune flat last night, six days after she was allegedly murdered by a real estate agent eyeing her property.

 Police broke open the doors of the flat in Koregaon Park after a friend told them on Saturday that Gudrun Koravinos had not been answering her phone for the past few days. The police found stab wounds on the body but the killer seemed to have left with the severed head.

 Her neighbours told deputy commissioner Anand Shinde and his team that the researcher, settled in Pune for several years, had been visited by several real estate agents in the past few weeks. Koravinos owned another flat in Koregaon Park and wanted to sell it.

 The police sifted among real estate agents specialising in Koregaon Park property deals and zeroed in on 26-year-old Islakh Fakir Shaikh who, they said, had been behaving suspiciously. On sustained interrogation, he reportedly confessed to the murder.

 Police sources said Shaikh, a resident of Mangalwar Peth, had visited Koravinos several times in December. According to the police version of his confession, Shaikh had dropped in again on the night of January 1 with forged documents staking claim to Koravinoss properties and tried to get her to sign the papers.

 When she refused, he stabbed her with a knife three times, killing her on the spot. Shaikh then locked the house and left.

 He returned the next day, cut off the victims head, put it in a gunny bag and threw it into a stream in the Kharadi locality.

 The following day, January 3, he entered the flat again and left with a computer and a TV set, which he sold for Rs 4,000 each to traders at Mangalwar Peth.

 Shaikh was taken to Kharadi today and the severed head was recovered, the police said.

 Shaikhs body bore marks of injury indicating that the archaeologist had fought back when he tried to force her to initial the forged documents.

 Actor Mohan Agashe, who received Koravinoss body, told reporters he knew her well and that she was doing brilliant work with Punes Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute.

 The institute was in the news in 2004 when Right-wing activists vandalised its premises and destroyed valuable documents in protest against a book published on Chhatrapati Shivaji.

 Agashe said Koravinos visited Nepal frequently in connection with a book she was writing. She was twice married and divorced.

 Cop swoop on Medha sit-in

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 26: For a government willing to talk to almost all armed groups ? Maoist, Naga or Kashmiri ? the only pariahs seem to be the few surviving Gandhians.

 The police today attacked Medha Patkar and 350 displaced farmers as they sat in a peaceful dharna in Delhi against the Gujarat governments move to raise the height of the Sardar Sarovar Dam by over 11 metres.

 The Narmada Control Authority gave Gujarat the go-ahead without any plan for rehabilitation of the 35,000 families likely to lose their homes in Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Gujarat.

 Medha had last evening met the Prime Minister, who promised to talk to the ministers concerned. He sought two days time to make enquiries.

 A day later, the police fell upon Medha and her group of mostly women protesters, who have been sitting opposite the Shram Shakti Bhavan, which houses the power ministry, for the last nine days.

 Medha was physically lifted and many of her supporters beaten up. The Parliament Street station house officer, Avnish Dwivedi, hit Cliston, a frail-looking student and researcher. I had no inkling? Dwivedi started hitting me, he said.

 We were only telling them to go to Jantar Mantar, sub-inspector M.P. Saini told reporters. Dwivedi was in no mood to answer questions. These people think they own the city. They cant be allowed to squat just about anywhere, he said, mouthing obscenities at the protesters.

 The agitators, including Medha, were dragged through the streets to Parliament Street police station where they were locked up for over five hours till 6.30 pm.

 Medha alleged the Centre is under pressure from the Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh governments not to act on the farmers complaints.

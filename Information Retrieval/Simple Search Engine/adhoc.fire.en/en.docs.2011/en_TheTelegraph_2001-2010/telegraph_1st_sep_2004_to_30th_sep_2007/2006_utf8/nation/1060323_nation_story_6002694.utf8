 Upfront cell fee draws watchdog

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 22: The telecom regulator, which froze lifetime validity rates today, was particularly bothered about the upfront payment that the subscriber had to make for the long-playing scheme. 

 Since the packages implemented by the operators do not provide for a refund of the upfront payment in cases of exit, the flexibility available for the subscriber of such schemes to freely choose any plan gets restricted, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) said.

 The forfeiture of the upfront payment while moving to other plans can in some sense be interpreted as a barrier to exit, the regulator said.

 The regulator decided to counter-balance this drawback with a tariff freeze and, thereby, protect the interests of the subscribers.

 However, the regulator did offer a glimmer of hope to the cellphone companies. Trai said if the current trend of declining costs is reversed, the provisions of this amendment can be reviewed.

 The cellphone companies had opposed the move when a consultation paper came up for discussion in February, but were non-committal on Trais decision today.

 The operators said the new Trai order would not have any adverse impact on tariffs. AirTel, which has introduced lifetime validity schemes, said the new order was unlikely to reverse the declining trend in tariffs. 

 We started the trend of low tariffs. If you see it historically, tariffs have only gone down. We dont believe there will be an exception to that in the future. Indications are the trend will continue to be towards lower tariffs, said a spokesperson for Bharti Televentures.

 Mother meets saviour child

 M.R. VENKATESH

 Chennai, Jan. 10: Jailed for life for killing Rajiv Gandhi, Nalini had a brief but emotional reunion with a 14-year-old to whom she owes her life ? her daughter.

 Harithra also met her father Murugan, on death row in the same case.

 Nalini had given birth to Harithra, the love child of Murugan, in jail soon after her arrest in the May 1991 assassination. She, Murugan and two others ? Santhan and Perarivalan ? were sentenced to death but hers was commuted on humanitarian grounds after an appeal by Sonia Gandhi not to let the child be orphaned.

 When she was three, Harithra was taken away from Nalini and placed under the care of Murugans mother, Somani, in Sri Lanka.

 The girl arrived in Chennai three days ago with Somani after Delhi cleared their visa, police sources said. From Chennai, Nalinis mother Padma accompanied them to Vellore today.

 Under court instructions, Nalini and Murugan, both lodged in Vellore jail, are allowed to meet once a fortnight. Today, Harithra joined them.

 Sources said Nalini broke down on meeting her teenaged daughter after 11 years. Nalini hugged her, tears streaming from her eyes, a source said.

 Harithras grandmothers, to avoid the girl being photographed while entering the prison, covered her face with a shroud that hung down to her knees. Security had been tightened at the prison today.

 Murugan had courted Nalini for a long time, regularly visiting her home on Chennais outskirts in the run-up to the assassination.

 As the couple fled from place to place after the assassination, they visited Tirupati where Murugan had his head shaved. The police had plastered walls across Tamil Nadu with posters containing a blow-up of Nalinis face and a computer-generated likeness of Murugan, along with pictures of one-eyed Sivarasan, the Tamil Tigers pointman in India, and Subha, the stand-by assassin. Copies were broadcast all over the country.

 Nalini and Murugan were arrested by the CBIs special investigation team in a surprise swoop as they got off a bus in Chennai.

 Murugans mercy petition is pending with the President along with those of Santhan and Perarivalan.

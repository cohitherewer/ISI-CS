 Sonia damper on iftar craze

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Oct. 1: Fashions can change even in Delhis political circles. Iftars are out with both Sonia Gandhi and President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam.

 Neither plans to throw the customary party for distinguished citizens during Ramazan. The Prime Minister, though, will be playing host to envoys of Islamic nations, Muslim leaders and others in mid-October.

 Sonia did away with the practice, begun by Indira Gandhi, four years ago. In November 2002, she had cancelled her iftar to spare the money for the drought-hit and the orphans of the Gujarat carnage.

 Kalam has never hosted an iftar as President though many of his predecessors did. A Delhi iftar is mainly a politicians way of earning Muslims goodwill, and as a Muslim himself and a non-politician, Kalam would hardly need that.

 The AICC minorities cell wants Sonia to host iftars, though. It sent her a note last week but she hasnt replied. Those familiar with her style of working say this means she doesnt favour the idea.

 Sources close to Sonia say one reason is the size of the guest list. In Sonias scheme of things, each guest requires personal attention, but gatherings of over 3,000 make that impossible.

 Experience has also shown her that rather than create goodwill, iftars often cause heartburn. Her minions fight faction wars over the guest list, which inevitably leaves out many influential Muslim leaders and clergymen.

 Many Muslims in the party are upset at Sonia giving up a good tradition. They say if she wants to raise money for charity, she can look at other avenues, such as charity dinners.

 The iftar used to be an occasion when leaders of the community interacted with her. It was a goodwill gesture, said a leader from poll-bound Uttar Pradesh. He suggested Sonia was being ill-advised.

 The Muslim clergy, though, is pleased that Sonia has buried the tamasha (farce). The shahi imams of the Delhi Jama Masjid and Fatehpuri Masjid, Maulana Syed Ahmed Bukhari and Mufti Mukarram, have issued fatwas against participation in iftars hosted by politicians.

 They say these parties are a vulgar display of material wealth and power, and compromise the spirit behind observing Ramazan.

 Whether because of the fatwas or Sonias move, iftars, the rage among Delhis politicians even a few years ago, are becoming rarer.

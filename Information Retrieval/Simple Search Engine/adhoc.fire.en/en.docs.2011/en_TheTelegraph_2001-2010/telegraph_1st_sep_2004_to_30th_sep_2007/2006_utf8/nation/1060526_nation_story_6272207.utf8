 Pak house hunt hits wall

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, May 25: Pakistans search for an address to base its consulate in Mumbai has run into trouble again.

 The Maharashtra government had suggested four new sites to Islamabad on Tuesday after members of Mittal Chambers at Nariman Point refused to house a Pakistani consulate on their premises a couple of months ago.

 But even before officials from across the border could come down to the city, the owners of two of the proposed sites have expressed reservations about letting out their property to Pakistan.

 Of the four sites suggested by the government, two are plots and two residential buildings.

 A 70-year-old Sindhi woman, who owns Shamkala Bungalow in south Mumbais Warden Road, has told the government that she would not rent it out to Pakistan.

 She was born in Pakistan but had to leave and immigrate to India after Partition. She is not agreeing to rent out her bungalow to the Pakistani consulate. We are trying to convince her, said Rameshchandra Kanade, the governments chief protocol officer. 

 The story is similar at Aman Chambers in Prabhadevi near the Siddhi Vinayak temple. The building houses residential apartments as well as commercial establishments.

 Many of the property owners are against a Pakistani consulate on the premises. We will let the government know about it in writing, said Arvind Dighe, a member of the buildings governing committee.

 Pakistans house-hunting in Mumbai has run into one hurdle after another. Its first choice was a property Islamabad had been eyeing since Partition, the Jinnah House. But India refused to part with it. 

 Recently, members of Mittal Chambers refused the country a 7,000-sq-ft property on its premises citing security concerns.

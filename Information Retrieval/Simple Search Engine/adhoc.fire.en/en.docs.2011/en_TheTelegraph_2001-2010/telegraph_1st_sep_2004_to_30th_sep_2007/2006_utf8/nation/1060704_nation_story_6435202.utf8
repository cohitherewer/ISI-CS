 Suicides, in spite of healing touch

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, July 3: Rakhi Shelgenewar didnt want to get married at the cost of her brothers education. So she killed herself.

 Police said the young woman jumped into a well on June 29, a day ahead of Manmohan Singhs Vidarbha visit and two days before the Rs 3,750-crore relief package the Prime Minister announced for the regions six districts.

 She is not the only one to have ended her life in the past few days. Three more suicides have been reported from the region. 

 One of them told his friends the package would not help farmers like him.

 Singh had personally interacted with over 100 farmers in three districts of the region. But though the healing touch translated into some hard cash, it did not meet their chief demands ? a complete loan waiver and increase in the minimum support price of cotton up to Rs 3,000 a quintal.

 Today, when the Maharashtra Assembly opened for its monsoon session, the Opposition led by the Shiv Sena-BJP combine attacked the Congress-led government for its anti-farmer policies.

 Sena member and leader of Opposition Ramdas Kadam demanded suspension of question hour for a discussion on the agrarian crisis. Chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh agreed, saying his government did not want to politicise the issue of farmer suicides.

 Kadam demanded a complete loan waiver and jobs for family members of farmers who killed themselves. But Deshmukh ruled out waiving loans.

 Rakhi, the eldest of four children of 48-year-old Shivrudra Shelgenewar, a farmer in Buldhana district, was dead against her fathers decision to discontinue her brother Rameshwars education to raise funds for her wedding. Rameshwar is completing his BSc in agriculture at a college in Yavatmal district.

 During a discussion, Shivrudra, who had run up debts from old loans, told his family he saw no other way of raising money. Rakhi had opposed the idea. A few hours later, she jumped into a well.

 In Akola, Kishore, 22, jumped under a running train. 

 The police said his debt-ridden father suffered a paralytic stroke six years ago. After repeated crop failures, Kishore couldnt take it any more.

 In Amravati district, Shrikant, 23, Kalbande killed himself yesterday. Police sources said Shrikant, who tilled a 2.5-acre plot his grandfather Ramoji owned, was in his farm last evening when fellow villagers noticed that he had consumed poison. The village sarpanch rushed Shrikant to the district hospital, but he died before he could be admitted.

 The police said he was disappointed by the Prime Ministers package. He left behind his old parents, a handicapped brother and his grandfather.

 Santosh Behade, 50, a su- garcane farmer in Nashik, also consumed poison.

 Border cracks bypassed

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 22: Chinese President Hu Jintao today made a strong pitch to remove suspicions in Sino-Indian ties and declared that Beijing has no selfish interest in South Asia. 

 He also hoped that India and China would be able to turn their borders into a bond of good neighbourliness.

 Before leaving Delhi at the end of the official leg of his visit, the President made the right noises, projecting the ties as futuristic and strategic. 

 The statement was made in his keynote address at an event organised by the Indian Council of World Affairs, a foreign office-sponsored think tank. 

 This was Hus only direct interface since he arrived in Delhi late on Monday. At yesterdays joint news conference with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, no questions were allowed.

 The much-publicised event turned out to be a low-key affair. Hu was left addressing a gathering that largely consisted of diplomats and senior service officials. No key cabinet minister was present at the conference, presided over by Vice-President Bhairon Singh Shekhawat. 

 On the dais, Hu had Shekhawat and Nalin Suri, secretary (east) in the ministry of external affairs, for company.

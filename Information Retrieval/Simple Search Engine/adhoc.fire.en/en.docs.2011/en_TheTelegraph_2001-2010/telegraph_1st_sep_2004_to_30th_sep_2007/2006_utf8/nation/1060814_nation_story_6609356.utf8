 Peek at Nizams jewels

 New Delhi, Aug. 13 (PTI): The Jacob diamond, one of the seven biggest diamonds in the world, will be among the Nizam of Hyderabads jewellery collection that will be displayed in the capital after five years.

 The exhibition is tentatively scheduled for November in the National Museum, which had hosted the first-ever public viewing of the collection in September-October 2001.

 Preparations are on to exhibit the Nizams jewellery. The work will take another couple of months and we expect the exhibition to begin in the first week of November, museum director-general A.K.V.S. Reddy said.

 To give the jewellery an appropriate backdrop, the museums interiors are being done up on the lines of Hyderabadi royal architecture, Reddy said.

 Security is also being put in place to ensure the safety of the jewellery, which was bought by the government for Rs 200 crore in 1995, he said. The jewels have not been valued since.

 We are procuring special security equipment like hi-tech cameras. Besides, there is a proposal for deployment of additional CISF personnel for the exhibition, he said.

 A budget of Rs 1.5 crore has been sanctioned by the government for the exhibition, he added.

 Naqvi: Brush with Bollywood

 New Delhi, Nov. 10: BJP MP Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi believes cinema is not about suspending disbelief, it is depicting reality in all its nakedness. 

 For the purpose, Naqvi has taken to translating his real life experiences as a politician into scripts for mainstream Bollywood films.

 Film-maker Madhur Bhandarkar credited Naqvi for assisting him in his last film Corporate. Enthused by the commercial success and critical acclaim the film generated, Bhandarkar has roped him in again for his next venture, Signal. Naqvi has been assisting Bhandarkar in writing the script.

 It is a story about traffic signals and the lives around them. But it envelopes a much bigger canvas about nexus of various groups that ferry street children around cities, beggars and gangs who operate behind them. It is a very interesting plot, Naqvi said.

 The most important aspect of his storytelling, he said, is that it is entirely inspired from his life as a politician. You see, as politicians, we get to know and understand things from a very different perspective. I am glad I have found a way of sharing these experiences with others. And cinema is such a beautiful medium to express yourself. 

 Naqvis future projects involve a full-fledged story about the life of a woman panchayat head. He calls it Vaishali, after the female protagonist. The story has already been accepted by a film-maker. 

 He, however, is not yet willing to divulge more details.

 It is the story of the subversion of the panchayati raj system. How local goons and mafia dons have captured the institution. The main character is a young, idealistic girl who is terrorised by the mafia and the story revolves around her struggle against criminalisation and corruption, Naqvi said.

 Besides, it has all the elements of a mainstream Bollywood film violence, romance, melodrama, everything, he added.

 Of course, Naqvis training as a politician from the badlands of western Uttar Pradesh helps infuse an authentic touch to the tale of a woman panchayat head fighting against criminals and corruption.

 As I said, I have turned a writer because of my extraordinary experiences as a politician. We witness an aspect of life that is rarely visible to others. With a little bit of imagination, these encounters have the potential of entertaining others. Being from UP is particularly helpful, Naqvi said.

 1000-cr package for Nepal

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 9: India today announced an economic package worth Rs 1,000 crore for Nepal. 

 Apart from releasing a one-time grant of Rs 100 crore and waiving military debts, India pledged to take up some mega infrastructure projects like setting up a gas pipeline, special economic zones, airports, roads and rail network.

 Winding up his four-day trip, Nepalese Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala said: I am quite satisfied with the outcome.

 A comprehensive package was not the only reason for the smile on Koiralas face. What did not reflect in the joint statement was Indias concession on two issues that will help him in talks with Maoists. 

 Delhi appears to have promised to release Nepalese Maoists jailed in India ? there are around 150 ? and support the UNs role in monitoring arms to pave the way for free and fair elections for the constituent assembly. While the Nepal team expressed satisfaction over an understanding reached on the two issues, Delhi chose not to speak.

 Stinker for Bangla

 New Delhi, Sept. 5: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today came down heavily on Bangladesh at the chief ministers conference on internal security.

 In his short speech addressed to the Prime Minister, home minister and fellow chief ministers, Bhattacharjee blamed Dhaka for fanning terrorism in India and altering demography of areas along the border.

 The Bengal chief ministers speech was one of the most aggressive on a platform outside his state. 

 Pointing an accusing finger at the eastern border, Bhattacharjee asked for a unified and multi-pronged approach to deal with terrorism. 

 It seems that there has been a paradigm shift in strategy and the eastern border is now the platform chosen for launching terror strikes in the Indian hinterland, he said. 

 Intelligence inputs also reveal that the hostile intelligence agencies of our neighbouring country are intent on recruiting young men from impoverished families and indoctrinating them with the poison of hatred for India. 

 Illegal infiltration into West Bengal threatens to distort the demographic pattern along the borders.

 Bhattacharjee said interrogation of agents of foreign modules has revealed, time and again, that terror operations were launched by foreign intelligence organisations from across the Bengal border, on the other side of which lies Bangladesh.

 Alleging that insurgent groups were using Bangladesh as a safe haven, he asked the Centre to take effective measures to tackle the menace. This, he said, should include completion of the border fencing even if it needs deviation from the rigid 150-yard line to include villages near the border.

 Arjun starts, Antulay smarts

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi, Dec. 2: One Union minister today kicked off action on what the Sachar committee has said about Muslims uplift; another voiced anger over what the panel wasnt allowed to say.

 Human resource development minister Arjun Singh set up a 12-member committee to work out by January how immediate action can be taken on the suggestions on Muslims education.

 Minority affairs minister A.R. Antulay said Sachar should have been allowed to count the Muslims in the defence forces. I was shocked when (the headcount) became a major controversy. Why are we afraid of the truth? Antulay asked. How can we take corrective measures unless we know the truth?

 Sachars report, tabled in Parliament two days ago, reveals the number of Muslims in various government departments but not the defence forces.

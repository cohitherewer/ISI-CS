 Another sneak-in foiled in Valley

 Srinagar, July 2 (Agencies): Indian troops today shot dead four suspected Jaish militants as they tried to cross the Line of Control, the second infiltration attempt to be foiled in three days, the army said.

 The sneak-in attempt was made in the border district of Baramulla, where a gunbattle has been raging since afternoon between security forces and militants holed up in a mosque.

 Troops guarding the LoC in Gulmarg sector spotted the foursome trying to sneak in at Budpathri in the wee hours. A gunbattle started soon after, leading to the gunning down of the Jaish-e-Mohammad quartet.

 Four AK assault rifles, 20 magazines, 300 rounds, a wireless set and 16 hand grenades were recovered from them, a defence spokesman said.

 On Friday, eight militants had been killed in Keran sector, west of Kupwara, in north Kashmir.

 An army jawan was killed in the gunbattle this afternoon, which broke out around 3.30 pm at Gamaru village in Bandipora area, 55 km from Srinagar.

 It was set off by a joint operation launched by the Rashtriya Rifles, BSF and police against the militants, believed to be two in number.

 Sources said the militants hurled grenades and opened heavy fire on the security forces from a house in the village where they were earlier hiding but shifted to a nearby house when it caught fire.

 When the second house also caught fire, the militants abandoned it and moved into a nearby mosque.

 Deafening gunshots and explosions continued to be heard till late at night although the security forces were trying to limit damage to the mosque.

 Reinforcements have reached the village and a tight cordon has been thrown to prevent the militants escape.

 Security forces say violence and infiltration has increased in recent weeks, as it does each year when snow melts, allowing easier movement.

 The infiltration has picked up, it is every year in June and July when incursions start and this year is no different, army spokesman Hemant Joneja told Reuters.

 Elsewhere, security forces shot dead four Muslim militants in separate gun battles across the region, police said. A militant was also killed in Pulwama.

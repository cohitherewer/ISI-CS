 Agni III waits for govt nod

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 3: The defence establishment is seeking the nod of the political leadership to test-fire its long-range missile, Agni III. 

 As of today, we are ready to launch it. The decision will have to come from higher levels, the scientific adviser to the defence minister and head of the Defence Research and Development Organisation, M. Natarajan, announced here today.

 Agni III is designed to carry a nuclear warhead of up to one tonne in weight. 

 Natarajans predecessor in the DRDO, V.K. Aatre, said two years ago that scientists had begun integrating Agni III. Natarajans announcement that as of today it is ready to be test-fired means that the process has been completed. 

 But the test-firing is not likely to be done in a hurry and looks improbable in the season of US President George Bushs visit.

 A decision to test Agni III that is designed to reach targets at ranges of 3,000 km-plus has large strategic and diplomatic ramifications. The range of the missile arms India with the ability to reach targets in large parts of not only Pakistan but also China from silos deep in the hinterland. 

 The test-firing will also invite charges that New Delhi is getting into a missile race. The Indian foreign office will have to account for suspicions that New Delhi is contributing to missile proliferation.

 All technical studies for the missile have been done. We are ready to launch today, Natarajan said of the missile that has been in the works for more than two years now.

 Sacrifice sermon before seat talks

 M.R. VENKATESH

 Chennai, Feb. 8: The DMK today sought to cap its allies expectations in the run-up to seat-sharing talks, saying every partner in the seven-party coalition must be prepared to make sacrifices.

 All of us should be ready to make some sacrifices in a spirit of give and take if the ruling ADMK is to be defeated in the upcoming Assembly polls, DMK chief M. Karunanidhi said.

 He cited Jayalalithaas highly successful seat-sharing model in the 2001 Assembly elections. Her party, as leader of its alliance, had contested 140 of the Houses 234 seats, won 132 and formed a government on its own.

 Karunanidhi pointed out that the Congress, CPM, CPI and S. Ramadosss PMK (as well as minor partner Indian Union Muslim League) had then been Jayalalithaas allies. With these groups now in the DMK-led alliance ? which also includes Vaikos MDMK ? there are many contenders eyeing shares of the same electoral pie.

 With more parties in our alliance this time, we should consider what is the optimum number of seats the DMK has to contest and how it would cut into the numbers of other allies, or add to some of them, to keep the alliance stable and strong, the former chief minister said.

 Karunanidhi had recently spoken of his party forming a government on its own if Jayalalithaa could be defeated, signalling that the DMK would keep a large chunk of the seats. Today, asked if he would insist on at least 140 seats as Jayalalithaa had done last time, he said: The DMK is also ready to make a small sacrifice.

 As part of Jayalalithaas alliance in 2001, the Congress had been allotted 47 seats, Ramadoss 27, the CPM and the CPI eight each, and the Muslim League and the Forward Bloc one each. Ramadoss and the Left parties expect more seats this time while Vaikos party wants parity with Ramadosss.

 Karunanidhi told reporters that each ally had been asked to submit by February 15 the list of seats it wished to contest. The DMK leadership would then sit with each ally and finalise a pact that will be announced during the partys March 3-5 conference, which Congress president Sonia Gandhi is expected to attend.

 Vaiko, emerging from todays meeting, declined to say anything except that the talks had gone off very well. Ramadoss didnt attend the meeting, sending PMK chief G.K. Mani instead.

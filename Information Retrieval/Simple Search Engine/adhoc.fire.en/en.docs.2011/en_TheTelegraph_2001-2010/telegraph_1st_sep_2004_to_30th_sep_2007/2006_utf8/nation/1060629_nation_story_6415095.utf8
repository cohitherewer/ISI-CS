 Actresss touch defiles the Lord

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Thiruvananthapuram, June 28: Keralas leading Hindu shrine, the hill temple of Sabarimala, welcomes people from all faiths ? unless they happen to be women aged between 10 and 50.

 An admission by two women celebrities ? actress Jayamala and dancer Sudha Chandran ? that they had climbed the hill and worshipped there has now shaken up the priests.

 Worse, Jayamala has admitted that during her visit in 1987, she was pushed from behind in the queue and ended up touching the idol ? which to the orthodox amounts to defilement.

 A half-disbelieving chief priest, Maheshwaru Kantararu, says its very difficult for a young woman to fool the rest of the worshippers and reach the sanctum sanctorum. He sees a conspiracy to bring ill repute to the shrine and has sought a probe into the mysterious developments.

 The temple, which stands at a height of about 1,000 metres on the Sahayadri range (Neelimala Hill), remains open from November 15 to January 19. It is surrounded by remnants of temples on 18 hills.

 Women are barred between puberty and menopause since Lord Ayyappa, to whom the temple is dedicated, was a confirmed bachelor. Also, theres a belief that allowing menstruating women into a temple would mar its sanctity.

 Jayamala made her admission in a letter to vedic astrologer Parappanangadi Unnikrishna Panicker.

 The issue has kicked off a gender row with women devotees expressing disappointment at the ban and activists vocal against the discrimination.

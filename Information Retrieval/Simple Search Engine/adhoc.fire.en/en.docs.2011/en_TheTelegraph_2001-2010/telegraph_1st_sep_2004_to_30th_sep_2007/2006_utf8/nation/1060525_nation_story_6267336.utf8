 Mutiny engulfs OIL units

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Dibrugarh, May 24: Contract workers who rose in mutiny against Oil India Ltd in Assam two days ago set ablaze a fourth effluent-treatment pit and a gas pipeline today, forcing the company to finally invite their leaders for negotiations on wages and service conditions.

 The agitation by the contract workers affected work in several oilfields across Dibrugarh and Tinsukia districts.

 Continuing from where they left off yesterday ? three effluent-treatment pits were torched in the first burst of arson ? a group of workers targeted another pit near the Tengakhat oil-collecting station No. 321 just before noon. The fire was immediately controlled. 

 Around 12.40 pm, the protesters ignited the gas pipeline connecting well No. 310 to the Kathalguri oil-collecting station, adjacent to a North East Electric Power Corporation plant. Fire-tenders doused the flames before they spread, sources said.

 In Duliajan, the OIL headquarters, one among a group of contract labourers triggered a series of incidents by pelting stones at vehicles carrying permanent employees. 

 A senior official in the Dibrugarh district administration claimed the situation was in control and that both sides had been instructed to resolve the issue amicably.

 New Delhi, Oct. 9: Whatever the subject, the impish irreverence would shine through.

 In 1995, when his alliance with Mulayam Singh Yadavs Samajwadi Party was coming apart, what did Kanshi Ram attack Mulayam for? Not his political style but his social affectations.

 Hes trying to play golf, hes learning how to use a fork and knife, but they keep slipping from his hands. Like power, Kanshi told this correspondent, eyes twinkling.

 Exactly a week later, the Bahujan Samaj Party pulled the rug from under Mulayams feet and rolled it out before the BJPs door. But not without a crucial rider: Mayavati would become chief minister, despite the BJP having 179 MLAs and the BSP only 67.

 Kanshi, who founded the BSP in 1984, had elevated political opportunism to a philosophy. He shunned the lofty phrases of those who would cloak their ambition in idealism; his talk was plain and hard-hitting. Early in his career, he had decided that agitations against price rise or for minimum wages never led to real change. Capturing power was the only way.

 His other thumb rule was that debates on Dalit identity or on the role Marxism and liberalism played in the Dalit cause were futile and diluted the political focus needed to organise a movement.

 It had taken him one look at Mayavati at a Dalit meeting to realise her potential. So he approached her parents: what plans did they have for the fresh law graduate?

 The parents wanted her to join the IAS, but Kanshi served up the clincher: if Mayavati went into politics, she would have a hundred IAS officials kow-towing to her.

 When the protege took over, she sat on a throne at party events and expected other members to sit on their haunches on a dhuree (something Congress defectors like Akbar Dumpy Ahmed couldnt stomach). In this, she was her sahibs true disciple. Kanshi was dead against inner-party democracy it created too many netas.

 How will history remember Kanshi: casteist leader, opportunist or a phenomenon?

 A fair assessment would place him almost on a par with B.R. Ambedkar, the Dalit messiah, and several notches above heartland leaders Charan Singh or Ram Manohar Lohia.

 His movement largely neutralised the feudal social structure in Uttar Pradesh that had for decades allowed the Congress to rule over the Dalits like a benign patriarch while the various socialist groups empowered sections of the backward classes while subjugating the Dalits.

 When the Dalits come out in large numbers to vote in western Uttar Pradesh, where they once wouldnt be allowed to, they always attribute the change to the moral courage inspired by Kanshi.

 Mayavati has indicated she might pass around urns containing her mentors ashes at the various Dalit community centres. Kanshi, if he were able to, would no doubt have flashed his mischievous smile and told the Dalits they should have better things to do than genuflect before the urns.

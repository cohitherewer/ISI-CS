 Mulayam lied on Dadri: Cong

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, Dec. 10: The Congress has accused Mulayam Singh Yadav of lying about the deadline for the Reliance power project at Dadri which the chief minister had promised would take off by June 2007.

 The party has made public the 29-page agreement by which 2,500 acres of prime farmland was given on 99-year lease to Reliance Industries Limited for the 3,740 mw project. 

 Signed in June 2004, it says the company agrees to make best efforts to commence commercial operation within seven years of signing the agreement, which would put the deadline at 2011. 

 Why did the chief minister mention in a press conference after the deal was signed that the production at Dadri would begin in three years? asked state Congress chief Salman Khursheed.

 Even the seven-year deadline has been qualified, he pointed out. What is this best efforts supposed to mean, he asked, pointing to the phrase in the agreement.

 According to the agreement a copy of which the Congress has obtained through the right to information law the Uttar Pradesh government would, within 365 days from the date of signing, set up and establish all connected infrastructure links with the site... and extend local tax exemptions on capital goods, plant machinery and spare parts. 

 In the entire deal, the state government has made all the commitments on deadline but the company was given the freedom to do it in seven years, Khursheed said.

 Congress spokesperson Akhilesh Singh said the confidentiality section of the agreement was intriguing. Clause 13.10 says this agreement be kept confidential and, accordingly, no party would disclose the same to any other person. Was the secrecy clause there to mislead the people? We want a debate on the agreement and people of the state must know it, Singh said. 

 Reliance Energy Limited did not react to the Congresss allegations but two Samajwadi Party ministers defended the agreement.

 Health minister Ahmad Hasan said the Congress was indulging in cheap politics by revealing the contents of the agreement when the partys own government at the Centre was responsible for delaying the project. 

 B.P. Verma, another party minister, said by making the agreement public, the Congress has shown it was not interested in the states development. Everything was done in the interest of the development of the state. No compromise was made by the state government.

 Reliance Energy has been tentative about the deadline. In 2005, Anil Ambani had announced that the project would be complete by 2006-7. Early this year, Samajwadi Party general secretary Amar Singh alleged that the project was getting delayed because of the UPA government.

 The Centre has objected to the price at which Reliance Industries, now owned by Mukesh Ambani, agreed to sell gas for the project to Reliance Energy, owned by Anil.

 No clinching proof against Pak: Delhi 

 OUR BUREAU

 Narayanan: Pretty good but 

 Oct. 22: Mumbai police are working overtime to build a case against Pakistani suspects in the rail blasts of July 11 but the national security adviser suggested today that India does not have clinching evidence to establish the hand of Islamabads spy agency.

 I would hesitate to say we have clinching evidence but we have pretty good evidence, M.K. Narayanan told a television channel, asked whether the proof against Pakistans Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) was decisive. 

 I think it is as good evidence as we can possibly get in terrorist cases. Whether it is clinching, it is for the courts (to decide). We have connectivity, linkages, confessions. We have a number of arrests which are pretty good but there are pieces of the puzzle which are not available, he added.

 Narayanan said the evidence would be shared with Pakistan after certain legal issues are clarified and hoped that this would be done before the foreign secretaries of the two countries meet in New Delhi from November 13 to 15.

 Keeping the bilateral talks in mind, Mumbai police have speeded up the process for filing a chargesheet and initiated efforts to get Interpol to issue red-corner notices to trace the Pakistani nationals alleged to have executed the blasts.

 The anti-terror squad has prepared the sketches of the nine fugitives and it is putting together dossiers on all of them. The information will be sent to Interpol, which will issue red-corner notices seeking the assistance of all member-countries, including Pakistan, in tracing the suspects.

 Mumbai police commissioner Anami Roy had announced last month that the 7/11 bombings were executed by 11 Pakistani nationals along with seven Lashkar-e-Toiba operatives.

 Roy had also hinted at the involvement of the ISI.

 The police chief said two out of the 11, who entered India through Bihar, Bengal and Gujarat, had been killed while a search was on for the others.

 The police said one of the two killed was Salim, apparently a Lahore resident, but did not explain how the identity or his roots were established beyond doubt. Initially believed to be a blast victim, his body lay unclaimed at a city hospital for nearly two months.

 The second dead Pakistani was identified as Mohammed Ali alias Abu Osama, who was gunned down in August in a police encounter at Antop Hill.

 Police sources said the fugitives include Abu Baqar, Hafizullah, Aslam Khan, Abu Obeduddin alias Abu, Ehsanullah, Ammanullah Saeed, Ammu Jaan alias Faiyyaz and Mohammed Riyaz.

 The anti-terror squads chief, K.P. Raghuvanshi, said: We still do not have complete information about their addresses. Specific information on the suspects is necessary for red-corner notices. We are working on that.

 The squad has already issued a red-corner notice for Zahibuddin Ansari alias Zaby, a key Lashkar operative wanted in connection with the Aurangabad arms haul in May 2006.

 Record turnout to bell kinder CAT

 OUR BUREAU 

 Nov. 19: Two-and-a-half hours of examination time instead of the usual two hours, 75 questions in place of the normal 90 to 120 and five options instead of the standard four choices against each question Common Admission Test (CAT) 2006 had a number of new features.

 Over 1,90,000 students a record appeared for CAT today across the country. The entrance test is the first hurdle that a student has to cross to book a berth at any of the six Indian institutes of management (IIM). There are around 1,300 seats in postgraduate management programmes at the IIMs. 

 Everyone knows it is a difficult examination. So, I was prepared for surprises as every year they incorporate some changes. I hope to cross the cut-off mark, said a smiling Ritesh Khanna, after the test. 

 But Roneeta Ghosh, graduate in mass media from Wilsons College, Mumbai, was not happy with her performance. I found the English section difficult as reading up the passages consumed a lot of time. I was not expecting such a paper, she said, taking time off discussing the likely cut-off marks with her friends. 

 The IIMs screen students for the final rounds of selection through group discussions and personal interviews using the CAT score. Many other premier management institutes also use the CAT score for admission purposes. 

 The examination was conducted peacefully and everything went according to plan. We will announce the CAT score in January, said Asish K. Bhattacharyya, representative of IIM Calcutta in the CAT Group, which conducts the nationwide test. 

 Todays turnout marked an increase of about 21,000 over the number last year.

 The candidates included 22,000 from other backward classes and about 12,500 from the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes. 

 New eligibility criteria for the test stipulated that students in the general category need to secure 50 per cent and those in the reserved categories had to secure 45 per cent during graduation.

 Varun Singh, a student in Ahmedabad, said the paper was easy but expected the cut-off marks for admission to the IIMs to be higher this time.

 The additional half hour was very useful as we had extra time to attempt each question, said Rachna Goyal.

 Manish Soni, who had come to Ahmedabad from Udaipur, said the mathematics section was easy, while the English one was tough. Overall, it was a moderate paper.

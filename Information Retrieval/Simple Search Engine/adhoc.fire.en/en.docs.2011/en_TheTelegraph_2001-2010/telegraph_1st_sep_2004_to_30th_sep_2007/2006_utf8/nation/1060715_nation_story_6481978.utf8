 Summit signal to big brother

 New Delhi, July 14: At a time when an impression is gaining ground that India has firmly hitched its wagon to the US, the trilateral summit scheduled for Monday in Russia between Russian President Vladimir Putin, Chinese President Hu Jintao and Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has assumed a special significance.

 Already, some diplomatic observers see this as an attempt to undermine the influence of the US in the oil-rich Central Asian region. Some have even talked, perhaps prematurely, of a trilateral axis or an alliance emerging against superpower hegemony based on common interests and perceptions.

 What seems clear, however, is that the three countries want to send a more complex message to the world on dealing with global challenges.

 Till now, the trilateral talks were limited to the foreign ministers of the three countries. They met in New York in 2003 and then again in Vladivostok in 2005. However, the official stamp of approval at the highest level for the trilateral cooperation had been lacking.

 Now for the first time, a summit-level meeting will take place between the leaders of the three countries in the presidential palace in St Petersburg on July 17.

 Sources in the government, however, are at pains to claim that this trilateral meeting has no bearing on its relationship with the US, Europe, Japan or any other major partner.

 They claim that India has an excellent relationship with Russia and is rapidly developing a positive relationship with China. It would, therefore, be natural for these three countries to explore what they could do trilaterally, what is beneficial to all of them and also contribute in the process to the economic growth of the region they are in, one of them claimed.

 It would be economics and not other global issues that the trilateral talks would focus on at present. 

 Issues of peace, stability and security are the basic responsibility of the UN and the Security Council. The understanding between India, Russia and China has not as yet reached a point where the trilateral forum can play a meaningful role by discussing such issues. There are still some outstanding problems between India and China, for example, an official source points out.

 But equally, the sources say, just as India and China have made rapid progress in their economic relations despite outstanding political issues, there is nothing that can prevent a synergy in trilateral economic relations notwithstanding political problems.

 One of the major issues on the agenda of the summit is energy security. Russia is already one of the largest producers of energy and is expected to become one of the key players in the future global energy supply scenario.

 On the other hand, India and China are emerging as the biggest energy consumers in the world and their demand for energy is expected to grow in the years ahead.

 Since Putins concept of energy security deals with not only its supply but also managing the demand, this issue fits in very well with the three-power configuration.

 Besides energy, the subject of international cooperation to combat terrorism, religious extremism and drug trafficking from the Pakistan-Afghanistan border to Central Asia will also be discussed. The three countries will also attempt to identify select projects in what is called the knowledge economy in which they could work together.

 Notwithstanding the Indian emphasis on the economic aspect of this trilateral meeting, some diplomatic observers are bound to see this as an initiative of the three-biggest Asian/Eurasian powers to come together and seek a role in dealing with future global challenges.

 Even if that be the case, others point out that needless fears should not be generated on this score as each of the three countries has vital stake in a stable, friendly and growing relationship with the US.

 But they add: Nevertheless, it would perhaps not be bad if the message began to be heard that there can be independent and supplementary thinking on what can be done to meet global challenges than just what the West thinks.

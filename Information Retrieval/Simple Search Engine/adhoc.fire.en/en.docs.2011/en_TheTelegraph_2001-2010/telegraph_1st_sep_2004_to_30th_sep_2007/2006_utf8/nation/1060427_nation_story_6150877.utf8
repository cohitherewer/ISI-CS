 Pepsi fined for condom in bottle

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi, April 26: The discovery of a condom in a sealed soft drink bottle has led a local consumer forum to slap PepsiCo India with a fine of Rs 1 lakh.

 The company must also pay Rs 23,000 as damages to the man who bought the bottle from a shop near the inter-state bus terminus here, the North District Consumer Forum said.

 It added that the fine ? to be deposited with the Consumer Legal Aid Fund of the State Consumer Commission ? would serve as an eye-opener for others in the soft drinks business.

 The company, which argued that the label on the bottle was fake, said it would challenge the decision before the State Consumer Commission.

 The forum had rejected Pepsis defence, saying it was the bounden duty of the company to take deterrent action against sale of spurious products in the market.

 Pepsi had said it didnt have any authorised dealer near the bus terminus at Kashmiri Gate but the forum didnt accept this defence as strong enough.

 It also ruled that a consumer neednt show a receipt as proof that he or she had bought such a product.

 Sudesh Sharma had alleged that he had bought two bottles of Pepsi from a shop near the bus terminus and fallen sick after drinking from one of them.

 He said he then checked the second bottle ? whose seal hadnt been broken ? and discovered to his horror that there was a condom inside it. He also suspected that the content of the first bottle was contaminated.

 The forum sent both bottles to the forensic laboratory at Rohini, but it said it didnt examine such cases.

 A PepsiCo spokesperson said: We havent received this particular order from the consumer court yet. But from what we hear from the media, it appears this is an erroneous order and we would be taking steps to challenge it.

 He added that the company adheres to strict PepsiCo International standards as well as all standards prevalent in the country.

 The stringent purification and packaging processes ensure that our consumers get a safe product. We are examining the matter, the spokesperson said.

 In the last three-four years, the police have conducted 30 to 35 raids against spurious manufacturers in Delhi and NCR (National Capital Region) and we have the first information reports and records of all such raids. We are constantly combating jointly with the industry and the police the menace of spurious products in the market.

 In 2003, both Pepsi and rival Coca-Cola were sucked into controversy after an NGO alleged that at least 12 brands of soft drinks marketed by them contained pesticides at least 30 times higher than international standards.
